MICHIGAN RULES OF EVIDENCE 

RULES 101–106 

Rule 101.  Scope. 

These rules govern proceedings in the courts of this state to the extent and with the 
exceptions  stated  in  Rule  1101.    A  statutory  rule  of  evidence  not  in  conflict  with 
these  rules  or  other  rules  adopted  by  the  Supreme  Court  is  effective  until 
superseded by rule or decision of the Supreme Court. 

Rule 102.  Purpose. 

These  rules  are  intended  to  secure  fairness  in  administration,  elimination  of 
unjustifiable  expense  and  delay,  and  promotion  of  growth  and  development  of  the 
law of evidence to the end that the truth may be ascertained and proceedings justly 
determined. 

Rule 103.  Rulings on Evidence. 

(a)  Effect  of  Erroneous  Ruling.    Error  may  not  be  predicated  upon  a  ruling  which 
admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected, and  

(1) Objection.  In case the ruling is one admitting evidence, a timely objection or 
motion to strike appears of record, stating the specific ground of objection, if the 
specific ground was not apparent from the context; or 

(2) Offer of proof.  In case the ruling is one excluding evidence, the substance of 
the  evidence  was  made  known  to  the  court  by  offer  or  was  apparent  from  the 
context within which questions were asked. 

Once  the  court  makes  a  definitive  ruling  on  the  record  admitting  or  excluding 
evidence, either at or before trial, a party need not renew an objection or offer of 
proof to preserve a claim of error for appeal. 

(b) Record of Offer and Ruling.  The court may add any other or further statement 
which  shows  the  character  of  the  evidence,  the  form  in  which  it  was  offered,  the 
objection  made,  and  the  ruling  thereon.    It  may  direct  the  making  of  an  offer  in 
question and answer form. 

(c)  Hearing  of  Jury.    In  jury  cases,  proceedings  shall  be  conducted,  to  the  extent 
practicable, so as to prevent inadmissible evidence from being suggested to the jury 
by any means, such as making statements or offers of proof or asking questions in 
the hearing of the jury. 

(d) Plain Error.  Nothing in this rule precludes taking notice of plain errors affecting 
substantial rights although they were not brought to the attention of the court.

Last Updated 1/6/2023 

Rule 104.  Preliminary Questions. 

(a)  Questions  of  Admissibility  Generally.    Preliminary  questions  concerning  the 
qualification  of  a  person  to  be  a  witness,  the  existence  of  a  privilege,  or  the 
admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court, subject to the provisions 
of  subdivision  (b).    In  making  its  determination  it  is  not  bound  by  the  Rules  of 
Evidence except those with respect to privileges. 

(b) Relevancy Conditioned on Fact.  When  the relevancy of evidence depends upon 
the fulfillment of a condition of fact, the court shall admit it upon, or subject to, the 
introduction  of  evidence  sufficient  to  support  a  finding  of  the  fulfillment  of  the 
condition. 

(c) Hearing of Jury.  Hearings on the admissibility of confessions shall in all cases 
be conducted out of the hearing of the jury.  Hearings on other preliminary matters 
shall be so conducted when the interests of justice require, or when an accused is a 
witness, and so requests. 

(d) Testimony by Accused.  The accused does not, by testifying upon a preliminary 
matter, become subject to cross-examination as to other issues in the case. 

(e) Weight and Credibility.  This rule does not limit the right of a party to introduce 
before the jury evidence relevant to weight or credibility. 

Rule 105.  Limited Admissibility. 

When  evidence  which  is  admissible  as  to  one  party  or  for  one  purpose  but  not 
admissible as to another party or  for another purpose is admitted, the court, upon 
request,  shall  restrict  the  evidence  to  its  proper  scope  and  instruct  the  jury 
accordingly. 

Rule 106.  Remainder of or Related Writings or Recorded Statements. 

When  a writing  or  recorded  statement  or part  thereof  is introduced  by a  party,  an 
adverse  party  may  require  the  introduction  at  that  time  of  any  other  part  or  any 
other  writing  or  recorded  statement  which  ought  in  fairness  to  be  considered 
contemporaneously with it. 

RULES 201–202 

Rule 201.  Judicial Notice of Adjudicative Facts. 

(a)  Scope  of  Rule.    This  rule  governs  only  judicial  notice  of  adjudicative  facts,  and 
does not preclude judicial notice of legislative facts. 

(b) Kinds  of  Facts.    A  judicially  noticed  fact  must  be  one  not  subject  to  reasonable 
dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of 
the  trial  court  or  (2)  capable  of  accurate  and  ready  determination  by  resort  to 
sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned. 

Michigan Rules of Evidence 

5 

Last Updated 1/6/2023 

(c) When Discretionary.  A court may take judicial notice, whether requested or not, 
and may require a party to supply necessary information. 

(d)  Opportunity  to  Be  Heard.    A  party  is  entitled  upon  timely  request  to  an 
opportunity to be heard as to the propriety of taking judicial notice and the tenor of 
the  matter  noticed.    In  the  absence  of  prior  notification,  the  request  may  be  made 
after judicial notice has been taken. 

(e)  Time  of  Taking  Notice.    Judicial  notice  may  be  taken  at  any  stage  of  the 
proceeding. 

(f) Instructing Jury.  In a civil action or proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury 
to accept as conclusive any fact judicially noticed.  In a criminal case, the court shall 
instruct  the  jury  that  it  may,  but  is  not  required  to,  accept  as  conclusive  any  fact 
judicially noticed. 

Rule 202.  Judicial Notice of Law. 

(a) When Discretionary.  A court may take judicial notice without request by a party 
of  (1)  the  common  law,  constitutions,  and  public  statutes  in  force  in  every  state, 
territory,  and  jurisdiction  of  the  United  States;  (2)  private  acts  and  resolutions  of 
the  Congress  of  the  United  States  and  of  the  Legislature  of  Michigan,  and 
ordinances  and  regulations  of  governmental  subdivisions  or  agencies  of  Michigan; 
and (3) the laws of foreign countries. 

(b) When Conditionally Mandatory.  A court shall take judicial notice of each matter 
specified  in  paragraph  (a)  of  this  rule  if  a  party  requests  it  and  (1)  furnishes  the 
court sufficient information to enable it properly to comply with the request and (2) 
has  given  each  adverse  party  such  notice  as  the  court  may  require  to  enable  the 
adverse party to prepare to meet the request. 

RULES 301–302 

Rule 301.  Presumptions in Civil Actions and Proceedings. 

In all civil actions and proceedings not otherwise provided for by statute or by these 
rules, a presumption imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of 
going forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption, but does not shift to 
such  party  the  burden  of  proof  in  the  sense  of  the  risk  of  nonpersuasion,  which 
remains throughout the trial upon the party on whom it was originally cast. 

Rule 302.  Presumptions in Criminal Cases. 

(a)  Scope.    In  criminal  cases,  presumptions  against  an  accused,  recognized  at 
common law or created by statute, including statutory provisions that certain facts 
are prima facie evidence of other facts or of guilt, are governed by this rule. 

(b)  Instructing  the  Jury.    Whenever  the  existence  of  a  presumed  fact  against  an 
accused  is  submitted  to  the  jury,  the  court  shall  instruct  the  jury  that  it  may, but 

Michigan Rules of Evidence

need not, infer the existence of the presumed fact from the basic facts and that the 
prosecution  still  bears  the  burden  of  proof  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  of  all  the 
elements of the offense. 

RULES 401–411 

Rule 401.  Definition of “Relevant Evidence”. 

“Relevant evidence” means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of 
any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or 
less probable than it would be without the evidence. 

Rule  402.    Relevant  Evidence  Generally  Admissible;  Irrelevant  Evidence 
Inadmissible. 

All  relevant  evidence  is  admissible,  except  as  otherwise  provided  by  the 
Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of Michigan, these 
rules, or other rules adopted by the Supreme Court.  Evidence which is not relevant 
is not admissible. 

Rule  403.    Exclusion  of  Relevant  Evidence  on  Grounds  of  Prejudice, 
Confusion, or Waste of Time. 

Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially 
outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading 
the  jury,  or  by  considerations  of  undue  delay,  waste  of  time,  or  needless 
presentation of cumulative evidence. 

Rule 404.  Character Evidence Not Admissible to Prove Conduct; 
Exceptions; Other Crimes. 

(a)  Character  Evidence  Generally.    Evidence  of  a  person’s  character  or  a  trait  of 
character is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith 
on a particular occasion, except:  

(1) Character of accused.  Evidence of a pertinent trait of character offered by an 
accused,  or  by  the  prosecution  to  rebut  the  same;  or  if  evidence  of  a  trait  of 
character  of  the  alleged  victim  of  the  crime  is  offered  by  the  accused  and 
admitted under subdivision (a)(2), evidence of a trait of character for aggression 
of the accused offered by the prosecution; 

(2)  Character  of  alleged  victim  of  homicide.    When  self-defense  is  an  issue  in  a 
charge of homicide, evidence of a trait of character for aggression of the alleged 
victim of the crime offered by an accused, or evidence offered by the prosecution 
to rebut the same, or evidence of a character trait of peacefulness of the alleged 
victim offered by the prosecution in a charge of homicide to rebut evidence that 
the alleged victim was the first aggressor; 

Michigan Rules of Evidence 

7 

Last Updated 1/6/2023 

(3)  Character  of  alleged  victim  of  sexual  conduct  crime.    In  a  prosecution  for 
criminal  sexual  conduct,  evidence  of  the  alleged  victim’s  past  sexual  conduct 
with the defendant and evidence of specific instances of sexual activity showing 
the source or origin of semen, pregnancy, or disease; 

(4) Character of witness.  Evidence of the character of a witness, as provided in 
Rules 607, 608, and 609. 

(b) Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts.  

(1)  Evidence  of  other  crimes,  wrongs,  or  acts  is  not  admissible  to  prove  the 
character  of  a  person  in  order  to  show  action  in  conformity  therewith.    It  may, 
however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, 
intent, preparation, scheme, plan, or system in doing an act, knowledge, identity, 
or absence of mistake or accident when the same is material, whether such other 
crimes, wrongs, or acts are contemporaneous with, or prior or subsequent to the 
conduct at issue in the case. 

(2)  The  prosecution  in  a  criminal  case  shall  provide  written  notice  at  least  14 
days in advance of trial, or orally on the record later if the court excuses pretrial 
notice on good cause shown, of the general nature of any such evidence it intends 
to  introduce  at  trial  and  the  rationale,  whether  or  not  mentioned  in 
subparagraph (b)(1), for admitting the evidence.  If necessary to a determination 
of  the  admissibility  of  the  evidence  under  this  rule,  the  defendant  shall  be 
required  to  state  the  theory  or  theories  of  defense,  limited  only  by  the 
defendant’s privilege against self-incrimination. 

Rule 405.  Methods of Proving Character. 

(a) Reputation or Opinion.  In all cases in which evidence of character or a trait of 
character  of  a  person  is  admissible,  proof  may  be  made  by  testimony  as  to 
reputation or by testimony in the form of an opinion.  On cross-examination, inquiry 
is allowable into reports of relevant specific instances of conduct. 

(b) Specific Instances of Conduct.  In cases in which character or a trait of character 
of a person is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense, proof may also be 
made of specific instances of that person’s conduct. 

Rule 406.  Habit; Routine Practice. 

Evidence  of  the  habit  of  a  person  or  of  the  routine  practice  of  an  organization, 
whether  corroborated  or  not  and  regardless  of  the  presence  of  eyewitnesses,  is 
relevant  to  prove  that  the  conduct  of  the  person  or  organization  on  a  particular 
occasion was in conformity with the habit or routine practice. 

Rule 407.  Subsequent Remedial Measures. 

When,  after  an  event,  measures  are  taken  which,  if  taken  previously,  would  have 
made  the  event  less  likely  to  occur,  evidence  of  the  subsequent  measures  is  not 
admissible  to  prove  negligence  or  culpable  conduct  in  connection  with  the  event.  

Michigan Rules of Evidence 

8 

Last Updated 1/6/2023 

This  rule  does  not  require  the  exclusion  of  evidence  of  subsequent  measures  when 
offered  for  another  purpose,  such  as  proving  ownership,  control,  or  feasibility  of 
precautionary measures, if controverted, or impeachment. 

Rule 408.  Compromise and Offers to Compromise. 

Evidence  of  (1)  furnishing  or  offering  or  promising  to  furnish,  or  (2)  accepting  or 
offering  or  promising  to  accept,  a  valuable  consideration  in  compromising  or 
attempting  to  compromise  a  claim  which  was  disputed  as  to  either  validity  or 
amount,  is  not  admissible  to  prove  liability  for  or  invalidity  of  the  claim  or  its 
amount.    Evidence  of  conduct  or  statements  made  in  compromise  negotiations  is 
likewise  not  admissible.    This  rule  does  not  require  the  exclusion  of  any  evidence 
otherwise  discoverable  merely  because  it  is  presented  in  the  course  of  compromise 
negotiations.  This rule also does not require exclusion when the evidence is offered 
for  another  purpose,  such  as  proving  bias  or  prejudice  of  a  witness,  negativing  a 
contention of undue delay, or proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation 
or prosecution. 

Rule 409.  Payment of Medical and Similar Expenses. 

Evidence of furnishing or offering or promising to pay medical, hospital, or similar 
expenses occasioned by an injury is not admissible to prove liability for the injury. 

Rule 410.  Inadmissibility of Pleas, Plea Discussions, and Related Statements. 

Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  this  rule,  evidence  of  the  following  is  not,  in  any 
civil or criminal proceeding, admissible against the defendant who made the plea or 
was a participant in the plea discussions: 

(1) A plea of guilty which was later withdrawn; 

(2) A plea of nolo contendere, except that, to the extent that evidence of a guilty 
plea  would  be  admissible,  evidence  of  a  plea  of  nolo  contendere  to  a  criminal 
charge  may  be  admitted  in  a  civil  proceeding  to  support  a  defense  against  a 
claim asserted by the person who entered the plea; 

(3)  Any  statement  made  in  the  course  of  any  proceedings  under  MCR  6.302  or 
comparable state or federal procedure regarding either of the foregoing pleas; or 

(4)  Any  statement  made  in  the  course  of  plea  discussions  with  an  attorney  for 
the prosecuting authority which do not result in a plea of guilty or which result 
in a plea of guilty later withdrawn. 

However,  such  a  statement  is  admissible  (i)  in  any  proceeding  wherein  another 
statement  made  in  the  course  of  the  same  plea  or  plea  discussions  has  been 
introduced  and  the  statement  ought  in  fairness  be  considered  contemporaneously 
with  it,  or  (ii)  in  a  criminal  proceeding  for  perjury  or  false  statement  if  the 
statement was made by the defendant under oath, on the record and in the presence 
of counsel.

Rule 411.  Liability Insurance. 

Evidence  that  a  person  was  or  was  not  insured  against  liability  is  not  admissible 
upon the issue whether the person acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully.  This 
rule  does  not  require  the  exclusion  of  evidence  of  insurance  against  liability  when 
offered  for  another  purpose,  such  as  proof  of  agency,  ownership,  or  control,  if 
controverted, or bias or prejudice of a witness.

Privilege  is  governed  by  the  common  law,  except  as  modified  by  statute  or  court 
rule. 

RULES 601–615 

Rule 601.  Witnesses; General Rule of Competency. 

Unless  the  court  finds  after  questioning  a  person  that  the  person  does  not  have 
sufficient physical or mental capacity or sense of obligation to testify truthfully and 
understandably,  every  person  is  competent  to  be  a  witness  except  as  otherwise 
provided in these rules. 

Rule 602.  Lack of Personal Knowledge. 

A  witness  may  not  testify  to  a  matter  unless  evidence  is  introduced  sufficient  to 
support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.  Evidence 
to  prove  personal  knowledge  may,  but  need  not,  consist  of  the  witness’  own 
testimony.    This  rule  is  subject  to  the  provisions  of  Rule  703,  relating  to  opinion 
testimony by expert witnesses. 

Rule 603.  Oath or Affirmation. 

Before  testifying,  every  witness  shall  be  required  to  declare  that  the  witness  will

awaken the witness’ conscience and impress the witness’ mind with the duty to do 
so. 

Rule 604.  Interpreters. 

An interpreter is subject to the provisions of these rules relating to qualification as 
an  expert  and  the  administration  of  an  oath  or  affirmation  to  make  a  true

Rule 605.  Competency of Judge as Witness.  

The  judge  presiding  at  the  trial  may  not  testify  in  that  trial  as  a  witness.    No 
objection need be made in order to preserve the point. 

Rule 606.  Competency of Juror as Witness. 

(a) At the Trial.  A member of the jury may not testify as a witness before that jury 
in the trial of the case in which the juror is sitting.  No objection need be made in 
order to preserve the point. 

(b) Inquiry into Validity of Verdict or Indictment.  Upon an inquiry into the validity 
of  a  verdict  or  indictment,  a  juror  may  not  testify  as  to  any  matter  or  statement 
occurring  during  the  course  of  the  jury’s  deliberations  or  to  the  effect  of  anything 
upon that or any other juror’s mind or emotions as influencing the juror to assent to 
or dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning the juror’s mental processes 
in  connection  therewith.    But  a  juror  may  testify  about  (1)  whether  extraneous 
prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury’s attention, (2) whether 
any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror, or (3) whether 
there was a mistake in entering the verdict onto the verdict form.  A juror’s affidavit 
or  evidence  of  any  statement  by  the  juror  may  not  be  received  on  a  matter  about 
which the juror would be precluded from testifying. 

Rule 607.  Who May Impeach.

calling the witness. 

Rule 608.  Evidence of Character and Conduct of Witness. 

(a) Opinion and Reputation Evidence of Character.  The credibility of a witness may 
be  attacked  or  supported  by  evidence  in  the  form  of  opinion  or  reputation,  but 
subject  to  these  limitations:  (1)  the  evidence  may  refer  only  to  character  for 
truthfulness or untruthfulness, and (2) evidence of truthful character is admissible 
only after the character of the witness for truthfulness has been attacked by opinion 
or reputation evidence or otherwise. 

(b) Specific Instances of Conduct.  Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for 
the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness’ credibility, other than conviction 
of  crime  as  provided  in  Rule  609,  may  not  be  proved  by  extrinsic  evidence.    They 
may,  however,  in  the  discretion  of  the  court,  if  probative  of  truthfulness  or 
untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness (1) concerning 
the  witness’  character  for  truthfulness  or  untruthfulness,  or  (2)  concerning  the 
character  for  truthfulness  or  untruthfulness  of  another  witness  as  to  which 
character the witness being cross-examined has testified.

The  giving  of  testimony,  whether  by  an  accused  or  by  any  other  witness,  does  not 
operate  as  a  waiver  of  the  accused’s  or  the  witness’  privilege  against  self-
incrimination  when  examined  with  respect  to  matters  which  relate  only  to 
credibility. 

Rule 609.  Impeachment by Evidence of Conviction of Crime. 

(a) General Rule.  For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness, evidence 
that  the  witness  has  been  convicted  of  a  crime  shall  not  be  admitted  unless  the 
evidence  has  been  elicited  from  the  witness  or  established  by  public  record  during 
cross-examination, and  

(1) the crime contained an element of dishonesty or false statement, or 

(2) the crime contained an element of theft, and 

(A) the crime was punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year or death 
under the law under which the witness was convicted, and 

(B) the court determines that the evidence has significant probative value on 
the issue of credibility and, if the witness is the defendant in a criminal trial, 
the  court  further  determines  that  the  probative  value  of  the  evidence 
outweighs its prejudicial effect. 

(b)  Determining  Probative  Value  and  Prejudicial  Effect.    For  purposes  of  the 
probative value determination required by subrule (a)(2)(B), the court shall consider 
only  the  age  of  the  conviction  and  the  degree  to  which  a  conviction  of  the  crime  is 
indicative of veracity.  If a determination of prejudicial effect is required, the court 
shall consider only the conviction’s similarity to the charged offense and the possible 
effects  on  the  decisional  process  if  admitting  the  evidence  causes  the  defendant  to 
elect  not  to  testify.    The  court  must  articulate,  on  the  record,  the  analysis  of  each 
factor. 

(c) Time Limit.  Evidence of a conviction under this rule is not admissible if a period 
of more than ten years has elapsed since the date of the conviction or of the release 
of  the  witness  from  the  confinement  imposed  for  that  conviction,  whichever  is  the 
later date. 

(d)  Effect  of  Pardon,  Annulment,  or  Certificate  of  Rehabilitation.    Evidence  of  a 
conviction is not admissible under this rule if (1) the conviction has been the subject 
of a pardon, annulment, certificate of rehabilitation, or other equivalent procedure 
based on a finding of the rehabilitation of the person convicted, and that person has 
not  been  convicted  of  a  subsequent  crime  which  was  punishable  by  death  or 
imprisonment  in  excess  of  one  year,  or  (2) the  conviction  has  been  the  subject  of a 
pardon, annulment, or other equivalent procedure based on a finding of innocence. 

(e)  Juvenile  Adjudications.    Evidence  of  juvenile  adjudications  is  generally  not 
admissible under this rule, except in subsequent cases against the same child in the 
juvenile division of a probate court.  The court may, however, in a criminal case or a 
juvenile  proceeding  against  the  child  allow  evidence  of  a  juvenile  adjudication  of a

witness  other  than  the  accused  if  conviction  of  the  offense  would  be  admissible  to 
attack  the  credibility  of  an  adult  and  the  court  is  satisfied  that  admission  is 
necessary for a fair determination of the case or proceeding. 

(f)  Pendency  of  Appeal.    The  pendency  of  an  appeal  therefrom  does  not  render 
evidence  of  a  conviction  inadmissible.    Evidence  of  the  pendency  of  an  appeal  is 
admissible. 

Rule 610.  Religious Beliefs or Opinions. 

Evidence  of  the  beliefs  or  opinions  of  a  witness  on  matters  of  religion  is  not 
admissible  for  the  purpose  of  showing  that  by  reason  of  their  nature  the  witness’ 
credibility is impaired or enhanced. 

Rule 611.  Mode and Order of Interrogation and Presentation. 

(a) Control by Court.  The court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and 
order  of  interrogating  witnesses  and  presenting  evidence  so  as  to  (1)  make  the 
interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid 
needless consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue 
embarrassment. 

(b)  Appearance  of  Parties  and  Witnesses.    The  court  shall  exercise  reasonable 
control  over  the  appearance  of  parties  and  witnesses  so  as  to  (1)  ensure  that  the 
demeanor of such persons may be observed and assessed by the fact-finder and (2) 
ensure the accurate identification of such persons. 

(c)  Scope  of  Cross-Examination.    A  witness  may  be  cross-examined  on  any  matter 
relevant to any issue in the case, including credibility.  The judge may limit cross-
examination with respect to matters not testified to on direct examination. 

(d) Leading Questions.  

(1) Leading questions should not be used on the direct examination of a witness 
except as may be necessary to develop the witness’ testimony. 

(2) Ordinarily leading questions should be permitted on cross-examination. 

(3) When a party calls a hostile witness, an adverse party or a witness identified 
with  an  adverse  party,  interrogation  may  be  by  leading  questions.    It  is  not 
necessary  to  declare  the  intent  to  ask  leading  questions  before  the  questioning 
begins or before the questioning moves beyond preliminary inquiries. 

Rule 612.  Writing or Object Used to Refresh Memory. 

(a)  While  Testifying.    If,  while  testifying,  a  witness  uses  a  writing  or  object  to 
refresh memory, an adverse party is entitled to have the writing or object produced 
at the trial, hearing, or deposition in which the witness is testifying. 

(b)  Before  Testifying.    If,  before  testifying,  a  witness  uses  a  writing  or  object  to 
refresh  memory  for  the  purpose  of  testifying  and  the  court  in  its  discretion

determines  that  the  interests  of  justice  so  require,  an  adverse  party  is  entitled  to 
have  the  writing  or  object  produced,  if  practicable,  at  the  trial,  hearing,  or 
deposition in which the witness is testifying. 

(c) Terms and Conditions of Production and Use.  A party entitled to have a writing 
or  object  produced  under  this  rule  is  entitled  to  inspect  it,  to  cross-examine  the 
witness  thereon,  and  to  introduce  in  evidence,  for  their  bearing  on  credibility  only 
unless  otherwise  admissible  under  these  rules  for  another  purpose,  those  portions 
which relate to the testimony of the witness.  If production of the writing or object 
at  the  trial,  hearing,  or  deposition  is  impracticable,  the  court  may  order  it  made 
available for inspection.  If it is claimed that the writing or object contains matters 
not  related  to  the  subject  matter  of  the  testimony  the  court  shall  examine  the 
writing or object in camera, excise any portions not so related, and order delivery of 
the  remainder  to  the  party  entitled  thereto.    Any  portion  withheld  over  objections 
shall  be  preserved  and  made  available  to  the  appellate  court  in  the  event  of  an 
appeal.    If  a  writing  or  object  is  not  produced,  made  available  for  inspection,  or 
delivered pursuant to order under this rule, the court shall make any order justice 
requires,  except  that  in  criminal  cases  when  the  prosecution  elects  not  to  comply, 
the  order  shall  be  one  striking  the  testimony  or,  if  the  court  in  its  discretion 
determines that the interests of justice so require, declaring a mistrial. 

Rule 613.  Prior Statements of Witnesses. 

(a)  Examining  Witness  Concerning  Prior  Statement.    In  examining  a  witness 
concerning  a  prior  statement  made  by  the  witness,  whether  written  or  not,  the 
statement need not be shown nor its contents disclosed to the witness at that time, 
but on request it shall be shown or disclosed to opposing counsel and the witness. 

(b)  Extrinsic  Evidence  of  Prior  Inconsistent  Statement  of  Witness.    Extrinsic 
evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible unless the 
witness  is  afforded  an  opportunity  to  explain  or  deny  the  same  and  the  opposite 
party is afforded an opportunity to interrogate the witness thereon, or the interests 
of justice otherwise require.  This provision does not apply to admissions of a party-
opponent as defined in Rule 801(d)(2). 

Rule 614.  Calling and Interrogation of Witnesses by Court. 

(a)  Calling  by  Court.    The  court  may,  on  its  own  motion  or  at  the  suggestion  of  a 
party,  call  witnesses,  and  all  parties  are  entitled  to  cross-examine  witnesses  thus 
called. 

(b) Interrogation by Court.  The court may interrogate witnesses, whether called by 
itself or by a party. 

(c) Objections.  Objections to the calling of witnesses by the court or to interrogation 
by it may be made at the time or at the next available opportunity when the jury is 
not present.

Rule 615.  Exclusion of Witnesses. 

At  the  request  of  a  party  the  court  may  order  witnesses  excluded  so  that  they 
cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses, and it may make the order of its own 
motion.    This  rule  does  not  authorize  exclusion  of  (1)  a  party  who  is  a  natural 
person,  or  (2)  an  officer  or  employee  of  a  party  which  is  not  a  natural  person 
designated  as  its  representative  by  its  attorney,  or  (3)  a  person  whose  presence  is 
shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of the party’s cause. 

RULES 701–707 

Rule 701.  Opinion Testimony by Lay Witnesses. 

If  the  witness  is  not  testifying  as  an  expert,  the  witness’  testimony  in  the  form  of 
opinions  or  inferences  is  limited  to  those  opinions  or  inferences  which  are  (a) 
rationally  based  on  the  perception  of  the  witness  and  (b)  helpful  to  a  clear 
understanding of the witness’ testimony or the determination of a fact in issue. 

Rule 702.  Testimony by Experts. 

If the court determines that scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will 
assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a 
witness  qualified  as  an  expert  by  knowledge,  skill,  experience,  training,  or 
education  may  testify  thereto  in  the  form  of  an  opinion  or  otherwise  if  (1)  the 
testimony  is  based  on  sufficient  facts  or  data,  (2)  the  testimony  is  the  product  of 
reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and 
methods reliably to the facts of the case. 

Rule 703.  Bases of Opinion Testimony by Experts. 

The  facts  or  data  in  the  particular  case  upon  which  an  expert  bases  an  opinion  or 
inference shall be in evidence.  This rule does not restrict the discretion of the court 
to receive expert opinion testimony subject to the condition that the factual bases of 
the opinion be admitted in evidence hereafter. 

Rule 704.  Opinion on Ultimate Issue. 

Testimony  in  the  form  of  an  opinion  or  inference  otherwise  admissible  is  not 
objectionable  because  it  embraces  an  ultimate  issue  to  be  decided  by  the  trier  of 
fact. 

Rule 705.  Disclosure of Facts or Data Underlying Expert Opinion. 

The  expert  may  testify  in  terms  of  opinion  or  inference  and  give  reasons  therefor 
without  prior  disclosure  of  the  underlying  facts  or  data,  unless  the  court  requires 
otherwise.  The expert may in any event be required to disclose the underlying facts 
or data on cross-examination.

Rule 706.  Court-Appointed Experts. 

(a) Appointment.    The  court  may  on  its  own  motion  or  on  the  motion  of  any  party 
enter  an  order  to  show  cause  why  expert  witnesses  should  not  be  appointed,  and 
may request the parties to submit nominations.  The court may appoint any expert 
witnesses agreed upon by the parties, and may appoint expert witnesses of its own 
selection.  An expert witness shall not be appointed by the court unless the witness 
consents to act.  A witness so appointed shall be informed of the witness’ duties by 
the court in writing, a copy of which shall be filed with the clerk, or at a conference 
in which the parties shall have opportunity to participate.  A witness so appointed 
shall advise the parties of the witness’ findings, if any; the witness’ deposition may 
be taken by any party; and the witness may be called to testify by the court or any 
party.  The witness shall be subject to cross-examination by each party, including a 
party calling the witness. 

(b)  Compensation.    Expert  witnesses  so  appointed  are  entitled  to  reasonable 
compensation in whatever sum the court may allow.  The compensation thus fixed 
is  payable  from  funds  which  may  be  provided  by  law  in  criminal  cases  and  civil 
actions  and  proceedings  involving  just  compensation  under  the  Fifth  Amendment.  
In other civil actions and proceedings the compensation shall be paid by the parties 
in such proportion and at such time as the court directs, and thereafter charged in 
like manner as other costs. 

(c)  Disclosure  of  Appointment.    In  the  exercise  of  its  discretion,  the  court  may 
authorize  disclosure  to  the  jury  of  the  fact  that  the  court  appointed  the  expert 
witness. 

(d)  Parties’  Experts  of  Own  Selection.    Nothing  in  this  rule  limits  the  parties  in 
calling expert witnesses of their own selection. 

Rule 707.  Use of Learned Treatises for Impeachment. 

To  the  extent  called  to  the  attention  of  an  expert  witness  upon  cross-examination, 
statements contained in published treatises, periodicals, or pamphlets on a subject 
of  history,  medicine,  or  other  science  or  art,  established  as  a  reliable  authority  by 
the testimony or admission of the witness or by other expert testimony or by judicial 
notice, are admissible for impeachment purposes only.  If admitted, the statements 
may be read into evidence but may not be received as exhibits.

(A)  inconsistent  with  the  declarant’s  testimony,  and  was  given  under  oath 
subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or in a 
deposition,  or  (B)  consistent  with  the  declarant’s  testimony  and  is  offered  to 
rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or

diagnosis and treatment. 

(5)  Recorded  Recollection.    A  memorandum  or  record  concerning  a  matter  about

knowledge  correctly.    If  admitted,  the  memorandum  or  record  may  be  read  into

party. 

(6)  Records  of  Regularly  Conducted  Activity.    A  memorandum,  report,  record,  or 
data compilation, in any form, of acts, transactions, occurrences, events, conditions,

(7)  Absence  of  Entry  in  Records  Kept  in  Accordance  With  the  Provisions  of 
Paragraph (6).  Evidence that a matter is not included in the memoranda, reports, 
records, or data compilations, in any form, kept in accordance with the provisions of

was  regularly  made  and  preserved,  unless  the  sources  of  information  or  other 
circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.

other  evidence  that  the  proponent  can  procure  through  reasonable  efforts,  and  (C) 
the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by 
admission  of  the  statement  into  evidence.    However,  a  statement  may  not  be 
admitted under this exception unless the proponent of the statement makes known 
to  the  adverse  party,  sufficiently  in  advance  of  the  trial  or  hearing  to  provide  the 
adverse  party  with  a  fair  opportunity  to  prepare  to  meet  it,  the  proponent’s

Rule 803A.  Hearsay Exception; Child’s Statement About Sexual Act. 

A statement describing an incident that included a sexual act performed with or on 
the declarant by the defendant or an accomplice is admissible to the extent that it 
corroborates  testimony  given  by  the  declarant  during  the  same  proceeding, 
provided: 

Michigan Rules of Evidence 

20 

Last Updated 1/6/2023 

(1) the declarant was under the age of ten when the statement was made; 

(2)  the  statement  is  shown  to  have  been  spontaneous  and  without  indication  of 
manufacture; 

(3)  either  the  declarant  made  the  statement  immediately  after the  incident  or  any 
delay  is  excusable  as  having  been  caused  by  fear  or  other  equally  effective 
circumstance; and 

(4)  the  statement  is  introduced  through  the  testimony  of  someone  other  than  the 
declarant. 

If  the  declarant  made  more  than  one  corroborative  statement  about  the  incident, 
only the first is admissible under this rule. 

A  statement  may  not  be  admitted  under  this  rule  unless  the  proponent  of  the 
statement makes known to the adverse party the intent to offer the statement, and 
the  particulars  of  the  statement,  sufficiently  in  advance  of  the  trial  or  hearing  to 
provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to meet the statement. 

This rule applies in criminal and delinquency proceedings only. 

Rule 804.  Hearsay Exceptions; Declarant Unavailable. 

(a) Definition of Unavailability.  “Unavailability as a witness” includes situations in 
which the declarant–  

(1) is exempted by ruling of the court on the ground of privilege from testifying 
concerning the subject matter of the declarant’s statement; or 

(2) persists in refusing to testify concerning the subject matter of the declarant’s 
statement despite an order of the court to do so; or 

(3) has a lack of memory of the subject matter of the declarant’s statement; or 

(4)  is  unable  to be  present  or  to  testify  at the  hearing  because of  death  or  then 
existing physical or mental illness or infirmity; or 

(5) is absent from the hearing and the proponent of a statement has been unable 
to  procure  the  declarant’s  attendance  (or  in  the  case  of  a  hearsay  exception 
under  subdivision  (b)(2),  (3),  or  (4),  the  declarant’s  attendance  or  testimony)  by 
process  or  other  reasonable  means,  and  in  a  criminal  case,  due  diligence  is 
shown. 

A  declarant  is  not  unavailable  as  a  witness  if  exemption,  refusal,  claim  of  lack  of 
memory,  inability,  or  absence  is  due  to  the  procurement  or  wrongdoing  of  the 
proponent of a statement for the purpose of preventing the witness from attending 
or testifying. 

(b) Hearsay  Exceptions.    The  following  are  not  excluded  by  the  hearsay  rule  if  the 
declarant is unavailable as a witness:  

Michigan Rules of Evidence 

21 

Last Updated 1/6/2023 

(1)  Former  testimony.    Testimony  given  as  a  witness  at  another  hearing  of  the 
same or a different proceeding, if the party against whom the testimony is now 
offered,  or,  in  a  civil  action  or  proceeding,  a  predecessor  in  interest,  had  an 
opportunity  and  similar  motive  to  develop  the  testimony  by  direct,  cross,  or 
redirect examination. 

(2) Statement under belief of impending death.  In a prosecution for homicide or 
in a civil action or proceeding, a statement made by a declarant while believing 
that the declarant’s death was imminent, concerning the cause or circumstances 
of what the declarant believed to be impending death. 

(3) Statement against interest.  A statement which was at the time of its making 
so  far  contrary  to  the  declarant’s  pecuniary  or  proprietary  interest,  or  so  far 
tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a 
claim  by  the  declarant  against  another,  that  a  reasonable  person  in  the 
declarant’s position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be 
true.    A  statement  tending  to  expose  the  declarant  to  criminal  liability  and 
offered  to  exculpate  the  accused  is  not  admissible  unless  corroborating 
circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement. 

(4) Statement of personal or family history.   

(A)  A  statement  concerning  the  declarant’s  own  birth,  adoption,  marriage, 
divorce, legitimacy, relationship by blood, adoption, or marriage, ancestry, or 
other similar fact of personal or family history, even though declarant had no 
means of acquiring personal knowledge of the matter stated; or  

(B) a statement concerning the foregoing matters, and death also, of another 
person,  if  the  declarant  was  related  to  the  other  by  blood,  adoption,  or 
marriage  or  was  so  intimately  associated  with  the  other’s  family  as  to  be 
likely to have accurate information concerning the matter declared. 

(5) Deposition Testimony.  Testimony given as a witness in a deposition taken in 
compliance with law in the course of the same or another proceeding, if the party 
against whom the testimony is now offered, or, in a civil action or proceeding, a 
predecessor  in  interest,  had  an  opportunity  and  similar  motive  to  develop  the 
testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination. 

For  purposes  of  this  subsection  only,  “unavailability  of  a  witness”  also  includes 
situations in which: 

(A) The witness is at a greater distance than 100 miles from the place of trial 
or hearing, or is out of the United States, unless it appears that the absence 
of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition; or 

(B) On motion and notice, such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it 
desirable, in the interests of justice, and with due regard to the importance of 
presenting  the  testimony  of  witnesses  orally  in  open  court,  to  allow  the 
deposition to be used. 

Michigan Rules of Evidence 

22 

Last Updated 1/6/2023 

(6) Statement by declarant made  unavailable by opponent.  A statement offered 
against  a  party  that  has  engaged  in  or  encouraged  wrongdoing  that  was 
intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant as a witness. 

(7)  Other  Exceptions.    A  statement  not  specifically  covered  by  any  of  the 
foregoing  exceptions  but  having  equivalent  circumstantial  guarantees  of 
trustworthiness,  if  the  court  determines  that  (A)  the  statement  is  offered  as 
evidence of a material fact, (B) the statement is more probative on the point for 
which  it  is  offered  than  any  other  evidence  that  the  proponent  can  procure 
through reasonable efforts, and (C) the general purposes of these rules and the 
interests  of  justice  will  best  be  served  by  admission  of  the  statement  into 
evidence.    However,  a  statement  may  not  be  admitted  under  this  exception 
unless  the  proponent  of  the  statement  makes  known  to  the  adverse  party, 
sufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing to provide the adverse party with a 
fair  opportunity  to  prepare  to  meet  it,  the  proponent’s  intention  to  offer  the 
statement  and  the  particulars  of  it,  including  the  name  and  address  of  the 
declarant. 

Note to 1978 adoption: 

MRE 804 is identical with Rule 804 of the Federal Rules of Evidence except: 

(1)  MRE  804(a)(3)  is  identical  with  Federal  Rule  804(a)(3)  except  that  the  word 
“has” is substituted for the phrase “testifies to.” 

(2) MRE 804(a)(5) is identical with Federal Rule 804(a)(5) except for the addition of 
the phrase: “and in a criminal case, due diligence is shown.” 

(3)  MRE  804(b)(3)  is  identical  with  Federal  Rule  804(b)(3)  except  that  the  phrase 
“reasonable person” is substituted for the phrase “reasonable man.” 

(4) The Michigan Rules of Evidence contain no catch-all hearsay exception such as 
found in Federal Rule 804(b)(5). 

(5) Subrule (b)(5) defines several hearsay exceptions for deposition testimony.  The 
new  subrule  combines  a  part  of  former  subrule  (b)(1)  with  parts  of  former  MCR 
2.308(A), which has been amended concurrently. 

Note to amendment of January 19, 1996: 

The  1996  adoption  of  MRE  804(b)(6)  incorporated  into  the  Michigan  Rules  of 
Evidence the residual or “catch-all” exceptions to the hearsay rule that are part of 
the Federal Rules of Evidence. 

Note to amendment of May 21, 2001: 

MRE  804(b)(6)  was  added  and  is  almost  identical  to  FRE  804(b)(6),  which  was 
added  to  the  federal  rules  effective  December  1,  1997.    The  new  subrule  creates  a 
hearsay  exception  for  prior  statements  by  a  witness  who  has  become  unavailable 

Michigan Rules of Evidence 

23 

Last Updated 1/6/2023 

due  to  wrongful  acts  committed  or  encouraged  by  the  party  against  whom  the 
statement is to be introduced. 

Rule 805.  Hearsay Within Hearsay. 

Hearsay included within hearsay is not excluded under the hearsay rule if each part 
of the combined statements conforms with an exception to the hearsay rule provided 
in these rules. 

Rule 806.  Attacking and Supporting Credibility of Declarant. 

When a hearsay statement, or a statement defined in Rule 801(d)(2)(C), (D), or (E), 
has been admitted in evidence, the credibility of the declarant may be attacked, and 
if attacked may be supported, by any evidence which would be admissible for those 
purposes if declarant had testified as a witness.  Evidence of a statement or conduct 
by  the  declarant  at  any  time, inconsistent  with  the  declarant’s hearsay  statement, 
is  not  subject  to  any  requirement  that  the  declarant  may  have  been  afforded  an 
opportunity to deny or explain.  If the party against whom a hearsay statement has 
been admitted calls the declarant as a witness, the party is entitled to examine the 
declarant on the statement as if under cross-examination.

RULES 1001–1008 

Rule  1001. 
Definitions. 

  Contents  of  Writings,  Recordings,  and  Photographs; 

For purposes of this article the following definitions are applicable: 

(1) Writings and Recordings.  “Writings” and “recordings” consist of letters, words, 
or  numbers,  or  their  equivalent,  set  down  by  handwriting,  typewriting,  printing, 
photostating, photographing, magnetic impulse, mechanical or electronic recording, 
or other form of data compilation. 

(2) Photographs.  “Photographs” include still photographs, x-ray films, video tapes, 
and motion pictures. 

(3) Original.  An “original” of a writing or recording is the writing or recording itself 
or  any  counterpart  intended  to  have  the  same  effect  by  a  person  executing  or 
issuing  it.    An  “original”  of  a  photograph  includes  the  negative  or  any  print 
therefrom.  If data are stored in a computer or similar device, any printout or other 
output readable by sight, shown to reflect the data accurately, is an “original.” 

(4)  Duplicate.    A  “duplicate”  is  a  counterpart  produced  by  the  same  impression  as 
the  original,  or  from  the  same  matrix,  or  by  means  of  photography,  including 
enlargements  and  miniatures,  or  by  mechanical  or  electronic  re-recording,  or  by 
chemical  reproduction,  or  by  other  equivalent  techniques,  which  accurately 
reproduces the original. 

Rule 1002.  Requirement of Original. 

To  prove  the  content  of  a  writing,  recording,  or  photograph,  the  original  writing, 
recording, or photograph is required, except as otherwise provided in these rules or 
by statute. 

Michigan Rules of Evidence 

27 

Last Updated 1/6/2023 

Rule 1003.  Admissibility of Duplicates. 

A  duplicate  is  admissible  to  the  same  extent  as  an  original  unless  (1)  a  genuine 
question is raised as to the authenticity of the original or (2) in the circumstances it 
would be unfair to admit the duplicate in lieu of the original. 

Rule 1004.  Admissibility of Other Evidence of Contents. 

The  original  is  not  required,  and  other  evidence  of  the  contents  of  a  writing, 
recording, or photograph is admissible if– 

(1) Originals Lost or Destroyed.  All originals are lost or have been destroyed, unless 
the proponent lost or destroyed them in bad faith; or 

(2) Original Not Obtainable.  No original can be obtained by any available judicial 
process or procedure; or 

(3) Original in Possession of Opponent.  At a time when an original was under the 
control  of  the  party  against  whom  offered,  that  party  was  put  on  notice,  by  the 
pleadings or otherwise, that the contents would be a subject of proof at the hearing, 
and that party does not produce the original at the hearing; or 

(4) Collateral Matters.  The writing, recording, or photograph is not closely related 
to a controlling issue. 

Rule 1005.  Public Records. 

The contents of an official record, or of a document authorized to be recorded or filed 
and actually recorded or filed, including data compilations in any form, if otherwise 
admissible, may be proved by copy, certified as correct in accordance with Rule 902 
or  testified  to  be  correct  by  a  witness  who  has  compared  it  with  the  original.    If  a 
copy  which  complies  with  the  foregoing  cannot  be  obtained  by  the  exercise  of 
reasonable diligence, then other evidence of the contents may be given. 

Rule 1006.  Summaries. 

The  contents  of  voluminous  writings,  recordings,  or  photographs  which  cannot 
conveniently  be  examined  in  court  may  be  presented  in  the  form  of  a  chart, 
summary,  or  calculation.    The  originals,  or  duplicates,  shall  be  made  available  for 
examination or copying, or both, by other parties at reasonable time and place.  The 
court may order that they be produced in court. 

Rule 1007.  Testimony or Written Admission of a Party. 

Contents of writings, recordings, or photographs may be proved by the testimony or 
deposition  of  the  party  against  whom  offered  or  by that  party’s written  admission, 
without accounting for the nonproduction of the original.

Rule 1008.  Functions of Court and Jury. 

When  the  admissibility  of  other  evidence  of  contents  of  writings,  recordings,  or 
photographs  under  these  rules  depends  upon  the  fulfillment  of  a  condition  of  fact, 
the  question  whether  the  condition  has  been  fulfilled  is  ordinarily  for  the  court  to 
determine in accordance with the provisions of Rule 104.  However, when an issue 
is  raised  (a)  whether  the  asserted  writing  ever  existed,  or  (b)  whether  another 
writing, recording, or photograph produced at the trial is the original, or (c) whether 
other evidence of contents correctly reflects the contents, the issue is for the trier of 
fact to determine as in the case of other issues of fact. 

RULES 1101–1102

  Proceedings  for  extradition  or  rendition; 
(3)  Miscellaneous  proceedings.

release on bail or otherwise. 

(4)  Contempt  proceedings.    Contempt  proceedings  in  which  the  court  may  act

(10) Mental Health Hearings.  In hearings under Chapters 4, 4A, 5, and 6 of the 
Mental Health Code, MCL 330.1400 et seq., the court may consider hearsay data 
that are part of the basis for the opinion presented by a testifying mental health 
expert.  

Rule 1102.  Title. 

These rules are named the Michigan Rules of Evidence and may be cited as MRE. 

The notes following the individual rules were drafted by the chair and the reporter 
of the committee which drafted the proposed rules of evidence for the benefit of the 
bench and bar and are not authoritative constructions by the Court.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
