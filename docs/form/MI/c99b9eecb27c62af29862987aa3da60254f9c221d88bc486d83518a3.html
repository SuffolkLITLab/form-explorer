 Be careful not to make mistakes. Make copies of the form based on the instructions on page 3 of either this booklet orthe booklets for forms FOC 53 or FOC 54, depending on your situation. 2. Approval by friend of the court. 
 In some courts the order has to be approved by the friend of the court before the judge will sign it.

If the order must be approved by the friend of the court, go to the friend of the court office with
 the original and five copies of the order. Leave the order with the office. Someone from the office

 After you have filled out the order, you must have it signed by the judge. If both you and the other party

 instructions on getting the order signed by the judge. Otherwise you must do either of the following: 
 a. Schedule and attend a hearing to get the order signed. 
 (Use packet for form FOC 53, Notice of Hearing to Enter Order. ) b. Notify the other party in writing that the order will be given to the judge to sign and that he or
 she has 7 days to file any written objections. If no objections are filed by the other party, the

 All items must be completed before the order can be given to the judge for his/her signature. Then fill in the correctinformation for each item on the form. Before you fill in the Case No. , get your copy of the Motion (form FOC 50 or form FOC 87) or your court papers for divorce, separate maintenance, paternity, or family support. Copy the Case No. from that paper onto both pages of this form. 
 Also use the motion or other court papers to fill in the "Plaintiff" and "Defendant" boxes. Copy the names from the motion
 or other court papers onto both pages of this form. For example, if your name is in the box that says "plaintiff, " then you
 should write your name in the "plaintiff" box on this order form. If there was a hearing, fill in the information based on what the judge or referee ordered at the hearing on the motion. If you and the other party are stipulating to the order, you have both agreed on what you want the court to order andhave not filed a motion. Since there may not be a hearing, you must fill in exactly what you agree on. Make sure you
 
 include everything you agreed on. Anything that you do not write down on this form will not be ordered even if you and
 
 the other party had agreed on it. If you filed a motion (form FOC 50 or form FOC 87) and the other party has agreed to sign the order without a hearingto enter the order, both you and the other party must sign the order. If the other party will not sign the order without a
 
 hearing to enter the order, follow the directions on scheduling a hearing in the booklet for form FOC 53, Notice of Hearing
 to Enter Order. If you and the other party are stipulating to the order, you both must sign the order. Some courts require the friend of the court to approve the order before the judge will sign it. To find out if this is require
 d, contact the friend of the court office. If it is required, see either page 3 or 5 of this booklet for directions on getting th
 efriend of the court's approval. To find out how to get the order signed, see either page 3 or 5 of this booklet for details. On the date you serve a copy on the other party, write in the date and sign your name on the remaining three copies. Return to the county clerk with two copies. You must read this booklet and other publications, such as the Michigan Child Support Formula Manualand the Friend of the Court Handbook, for assistance with the legal process. PAGE 6</div>
