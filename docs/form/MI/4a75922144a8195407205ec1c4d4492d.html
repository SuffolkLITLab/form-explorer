IMPORTANT: If you have affirmative defenses, you must state them now using the last page of this form. If you do not, the court may prohibit you from 
raising them later. An affirmative defense is a defense claiming that the plaintiff is not entitled to a judgment because other facts exist that create a lawful 
defense. Affirmative defenses allow you to provide information to the court that is not stated in the plaintiff’s complaint.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
