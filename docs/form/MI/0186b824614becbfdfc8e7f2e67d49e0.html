(a) The department determines that a parent, guardian, or legal custodian, or a person who is 18 years of age or older and who resides

        1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.2, or a similar law of another state and the parent has failed to rectify the conditions that led to the prior 
        termination of parental rights.
    (ii) The parent’s rights to another child were voluntarily terminated following the initiation of proceedings under Section 2(b) of 
        Chapter XIIA of 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.2, or a similar law of another state, the parent has failed to rectify the conditions that

(2)  In a petition submitted as required by subsection (1), if a parent is a suspected perpetrator or is suspected of placing the child at an
unreasonable risk of harm due to the parent’s failure to take reasonable steps to intervene to eliminate that risk, the department shall
 
include a request for termination of parental rights at the initial dispositional hearing as authorized under Section 19b of Chapter XIIA 
 
of 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.19b.
 
(3)  If the department is considering petitioning for termination of parental rights at the initial dispositional hearing as authorized under 
section 19b of chapter XIIA of 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.19b, even though the facts of the child’s case do not require departmental 
 
action under subsection (1), the department shall hold a conference among the appropriate agency personnel to agree upon the 
 
course of action. The department shall notify the attorney representing the child of the time and place of the conference, and the 
 
attorney may attend. If an agreement is not reached at this conference, the department director or the director’s designee shall resolve 
 
the disagreement after consulting the attorneys representing both the department and the child.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
