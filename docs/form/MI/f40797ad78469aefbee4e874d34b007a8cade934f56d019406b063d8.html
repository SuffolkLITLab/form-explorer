 How to Fill Out Garnishee Disclosure Form. CERTIFICATE OF MAILING
 GARNISHEE INSTRUCTIONSDefinitionsŁ A garnishment is a court order allowing the plaintiff (creditor) to take part or all of money owed to the defendant to pay for a
 judgment. You have been identified as a ﬁgarnishee, ﬂ a person who has control over some or all of the money that is paid to
 the defendant. Ł Periodic payments are payments you make to the defendant on a regular basis. These payments could be paychecks, rent
 payments, land contract payments, or other contract payments. Ł Nonperiodic payments include bank accounts, other property, money, goods, chattels, credits, negotiable instruments or
 effects, or earnings in the form of bonuses that are not paid to the principal defendant on a periodic basis. The rest of these
 instructions do not apply to garnishment of property, which needs to be sold before it can be applied to the judgment. 
 Responsibility to Disclose: 
 Within 14 days after being served with the writ of garnishment, you must deliver or mail copies 
 of this completed disclosure to the court, plaintiff™s attorney (or plaintiff, if no attorney) , and the defendant. This applies even if 
 you are not indebted or not obligated to make periodic payments to the defendant. No further disclosures are required. Withholding Instructions: 
 As the garnishee, you are being court ordered to withhold all or part of the money you owe the 
 defendant to pay the plaintiff™s judgment. You are required to withhold money until the plaintiff™s judgment is satisfied or the court 
 orders otherwise. If you do not do this, a judgment may be entered against you. 1. Determine when funds should be withheld. a. If item 2 b is checked, funds or other property available at the time of service of the writ must be withheld from the 
 defendant from the time of this disclosure. b. If item 2 e is checked, funds must be withheld for each period you are indebted to the defendant. For example, if the 
 defendant is your employee and he or she is paid weekly, you would withhold weekly. 
 Determine the date withholding will begin as follows. 1) For garnishees with weekly, biweekly, or semimonthly pay periods, withholding begins with the first full pay period after
 
 the writ was served. 2) For garnishees on a monthly pay period. 
 Ł 
 if the writ is served on the garnishee within the first 14 days of the pay period, withholding begins on the date the writ 
 was served. 
 
 Ł 
 if the writ is served on or after the 15 th day of the pay period, withholding begins on the next full pay period after the 
 writ was served. 
 2. Priority Writs or Orders and Multiple Writs (for periodic garnishments only) : 
 Garnishments with a higher priority than this garnishment of periodic payments are 
 Ł 
 orders of bankruptcy court. Ł orders for past due federal or state taxes. 
 Ł 
 income withholding for support of any person. Ł other general garnishments served before this writ. a. If a higher priority writ/order is currently in effect and withholding under this writ is not appropriate at this time, you must
 
 keep this writ until (1) the higher priority writ/order has been satisfied or is otherwise not applicable, (2) the defendant™s
 
 wages are sufficient for multiple writs, or (3) other circumstances change, which make funds available. Then, you must
 
 determine whether withholding can begin under this writ. b. If a higher priority writ/order is served on you while this writ is in effect and there is not enough money available for multiple
 
 writs, you must suspend withholding under this writ and inform the plaintiff of that fact. 
 c. The plaintiff may not file another writ of garnishment of periodic payments for the same defendant, garnishee, and
 
 judgment while the existing writ is pending. 3. Determine the amount to be withheld. The amount withheld cannot exceed the amount of the balance of the judgment
 specified in item 2 of the request. For periodic garnishment of earnings only, a calculation sheet (the last sheet of this multipart form) is provided to determine the amount to be withheld. You do not need to use this calculation sheet, but if you
 do, you are not required to file it with the court or provide it to the defendant and plaintiff. However, a record of payment
 calculations must be maintained and made available for review by the plaintiff, defendant, or court upon request. 
 Payment Instructions: Determine when disclosed amounts may be released. Funds available under this writ of garnishment 
 may not be released to the plaintiff or court until 28 days after you were served with the writ. After 28 days, funds must be paid
 as ordered in this writ unless otherwise notified by the court. For periodic garnishments only
 . After 28 days from the date of the service of the writ on the garnishee, the garnishee shall 
 transmit all withheld funds to the plaintiff or the court as directed by the court unless notified that objections have been filed. 
 Every time a periodic payment is withheld, the garnishee must provide the plaintiff, defendant (and the court if funds are 
 deposited with the court) with the case name, case number, date of withholding, amount withheld, and the balance due on the 
 writ. At least once every six months, the creditor must provide a statement of the balance remaining on the judgment, including 
 interest and costs. The garnishee should rely on this statement to determine when the judgment is satisfied. 
 Final Statement Instructions: 
 A final statement of withholding is required for periodic garnishments. Within 14 days after the 
 garnishee is no longer obligated to make periodic payments or the judgment is satisfied, the garnishee must file with the court 
 and mail or deliver to the plaintiff and defendant a final statement of the total amount paid on the writ. The statement must 
 include the names of the parties, the court in which the case is pending, the case number, the date of the statement, and the 
 total amount withheld. The ﬁFinal Statement on Garnishment of Periodic Paymentsﬂ form (
 Form MC 48) can be used for this. HOW TO FILL OUT THE GARNISHEE DISCLOSURE FORM
 1. Determine whether you are obligated to make periodic payments to the defendant. 2. Write in the date the garnishment was issued (found in the lower left hand corner of the Request and Writ of Garnishment) 
 and the date you received the Request and Writ for Garnishment and Garnishee Disclosure forms on line 1 of the Garnishee 
 Disclosure. Ł Determine if the writ is valid. 
 The plaintiff is required to serve the Request and Writ for Garnishment within 182 days from 
 
 the date it was issued. If the Request and Writ for Garnishment was not served within this time, it is invalid. If it is invalid, 
 
 check box 1 c. Date and sign the form and follow the instructions in item 3 below. If the writ is valid, continue on. 
 Ł If you don™t know the defendant or are not obligated to make payments to him or her
 , check boxes 1 b and 2 d. Then check
 
 the box that describes the reason you are not obligated. If you check ﬁother, ﬂ write out the reason. Date and sign the form
 
 and follow the instructions in item 3 below. 
 Ł If you know the defendant and are obligated to make payments to him or her, you must mail or deliver a copy of the 
 Request and Writ for Garnishment to the defendant. After mailing or delivering it to the defendant, check box 1 a and write
 
 in the date you mailed or delivered it. Follow the instructions in item 2 below. The term ﬁobligated to payﬂ includes 
 
 employees who may not necessarily be receiving a paycheck at the time. For example, employees may be sick, laid off, 
 
 or on leave when this writ was issued, but they are still your employees and will eventually be back to work. 3. Check box 2 e and complete the information in item 2 e as explained below. 
 Ł 
 Check either the box ﬁearningsﬂ or ﬁnonearningsﬂ so the plaintiff knows what kind of payments you make to the defendant. 
 
 If you check ﬁnonearnings, ﬂ write in the kind of payments (for example, if you make rent payments, write that on the line 
 after the ﬁnonearningsﬂ box) . Ł 
 Check the box that describes how often you make the payments to the defendant. If you check the ﬁotherﬂ box, write on 
 the line after that box how often you make the payments. Ł 
 Check whether or not you are already garnishing money from the defendant ( a higher priority writ/order) . If you check the
 
 box that a higher priority writ/order is in effect, copy from those papers the name of the court that issued that writ, the case
 
 number of that writ, the date that writ was issued, and the date it was served on you. Ł 
 If the defendant is currently due to receive payments from you from the date the writ was issued, check the box that says
 
 withholding ﬁwill begin immediately if sufficient funds are available. ﬂ If the defendant is not due to receive a payment, 
 
 check the box that says ﬁwill not begin immediately. ﬂ Then check the box that explains why payment is not due; for 
 
 
 example, defendant is laid off, sick, or on leave of absence. 
 Date and sign the form and follow the instructions in item 4. 4. Fill in the dates that you will be mailing or delivering the copies of this form. Date and sign this part of the form. Separate the
 four copies of the form. Mail the original to the court and one copy to the plaintiff. You can either mail a copy to the defendant
 or hand deliver it to him or her. Keep one copy for your records. 
 See next page for calculation sheet. You do not need to use this calculation sheet. If you do, it does not need to be filed with the court or provided to the defendant and plaintiff. 
 However, you must maintain some type of record of your payment calculations and make it available for review by the plaintiff, defendant, or 
 court upon request. 1. The employer™s current payday is
