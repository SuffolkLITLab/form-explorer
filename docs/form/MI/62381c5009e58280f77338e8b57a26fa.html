NONPERIODIC GARNISHMENTS

Definitions
Nonperiodic Garnishment - a garnishment of property or obligations made on a nonperiodic basis, including but not limited to 
bank accounts, property, money, goods, chattels, credits, and negotiable instruments or effects. Do not use this form to garnish 
income tax refunds from the State of Michigan; see Michigan statutes for specific procedures to garnish state income tax.

Additional Instructions for the Plaintiff:
You must provide information that will permit the garnishee to identify the defendant such as the defendant’s address, social
security number, account number, etc.

Instructions for Item 2:
If a civil judgment does not include judgment interest in the “total judgment” field, the interest amount reported in item 2 
should be accrued from the date the complaint was filed.

If a civil judgment includes judgment interest in the “total judgment” field (as in the forms in use before the 5/07 revisions), the
interest amount reported in item 2 should not include any postfiling interest already included in the judgment.

If the disclosure states that the garnishee holds property belonging to the defendant, you must motion the court (with notice to
the defendant and the garnishee) for an order, which will tell the garnishee to take the defendant’s property, sell it, and apply
it toward your judgment. If there are no pending objections to the garnishment and you have not filed such a motion within 56
days after the filing of the disclosure, the garnishment is dissolved and the garnishee may release the property to the 
defendant.

    judgment, income owed to you may be withheld or property belonging to you may be taken from you and sold.

    a. your income is exempt from garnishment by law,
    b. you have a pending bankruptcy proceeding,
    c.  the maximum withheld exceeds the amount allowed by law,
    d. you have paid the judgment in full,
    e. the garnishment was not properly issued or is otherwise invalid.

Additional Instructions for the Defendant:
  1. This writ has been issued because there is a judgment against you that you have not paid. In order to collect on this
 
  2. You may object to this garnishment if:
 
 
 
 
 
  3. You may send the plaintiff a written request to review postjudgment costs and fees listed in item 2 of the request. Within  
    28 days after receiving your request, the plaintiff must send an itemized list of the postjudgment costs and fees to you
 
    and the court. Within 28 days after receiving the itemized list, you may file a motion with the court to review the 
 
    postjudgment costs and fees if you believe they are wrong. If the judge rules in your favor, the judge may order the 
 
    motion fee to be deducted from the judgment balance.
 
  4. Certain income is exempt from garnishment and the law gives you the right to claim this income as exempt to prevent it
    from being used to collect on this judgment. The following are examples of some types of income that are exempt from
 
    garnishment and the citations where each type may be found in the law. This is not intended as a complete list. You may
 
    want to contact your lawyer or legal aid agency for further assistance.

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
