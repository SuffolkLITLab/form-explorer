      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: COLLECTING YOUR MONEY FROM
 A SMALL CLAIMS JUDGMENT
 If you receive a money judgment through alawsuit, you have the right to collect the money by the means allowed by law. 
 How Much can I Collect? You can collect the amount stated in your
 small claims judgment (form DC 85) plus anyinterest that accumulates during the time theother party pays off the judgment. 
 How can I Collect my Money? There are several ways to collect your money. 
 1. If the party who lost the lawsuit (called ajudgment debtor) has the money and is present
 at the trial, s/he can pay you (called a judgment 
 creditor) right then. 2. If the judgment debtor does not have themoney at that time, the judge can set up apayment schedule. If the judgment debtor is not present at thetrial, the court will send a copy of the smallclaims judgment to the judgment debtor. The
 judgment will order the judgment debtor to payyou in full within 30 days or to tell you and thecourt where the judgment debtor works and the
 location of his/her bank accounts. 3. If the judgment debtor doesn™t pay thejudgment as ordered, you can collect your 
 money through proceedings to seize property 
 or to garnish income of the judgment debtor. 
 What is Seizure of Property? Seizure of property is a court procedure that allows a court officer to seize property belonging
 to the judgment debtor that can be sold to paythe money owed to you. To file a request to
 seize property, use form MC 19, 
 Request and Order to Seize Property. 
 What is Garnishment? Garnishment is a court procedure that allows
 you to collect the money owed to you by takingin from the judgment debtor™s wages, bank
 account, or another source (such as income tax
 refunds) . To file a garnishment, contact the
 court clerk for the proper forms. Instructionsare provided with the form. How do I get an Order to Seize Propertyor a Garnishment? To get an order to seize property or for
 garnishment, you must know where thejudgment debtor lives and works, what assets s/he has and where these assets are located, and any other information that identifies the 
 judgment debtor and his/her property. 
 Ł If you already have the informationdescribed above, you can start the processfor an order to seize property or forgarnishment. Ł If you don™t have the information described 
 above, you can order the judgment debtor to appear in court for questioning through a process 
 called discovery. You can start this process by 
 filing a discovery subpoena. How to File a Discovery Subpoena You must wait 21 days after your small
 claims judgment was signed before you canfile a discovery subpoena. Use form MC 11, 
 Subpoena (Order to Appear and/or Produce) 
 . Be sure to contact the court to set anappearance date and then put that date andlocation on the form. Complete the front of the Subpoena form and the ﬁAffidavit for 
 Judgment Debtor Examinationﬂ on the backof the form. The judge must sign the 
 Subpoena before it becomes effective. After
 the Subpoena is signed, you must serve iton the judgment debtor. 
 The fee for filing the Subpoena with the court varies. The cost of serving it also varies. 
 How to File a Request to Seize Property You must wait 21 days after your small
 claims judgment was signed before you canget an order to seize property. Use form
 MC 19, Request and Order to Seize Property
 , to start the process. Complete the ﬁRequestﬂ 
 portion of form MC 19 and file it with the court. The filing fee varies. The court will issue the
 order by signing the form, and it will be executed
 (property seized) by a sheriff or court officer. 
 When do I get my Money from Seized Property? Once property is seized and sold, 
 the money will be given to you. The sheriff or 
 court officer is entitled to fees, which will be 
 deducted from the sale of the property. 
 How to File a Request for Garnishment You must wait 21 days after your small
 claims judgment was signed before you canget a garnishment. There are 
 three types ofgarnishment: 1) periodic, 2) nonperiodic, and 3) income tax intercept. Use the appropriateform MC 12, MC 13 or MC 52, Request and Writ for Garnishment, to start the garnishmentprocess. A periodic writ of garnishment (form MC 12) is used to garnish the judgment debtor™s
 wages, rent payments, land contract payments, 
 or other debt that is paid to the judgment debtor
 on a periodic basis. A periodic garnishment is
 valid until the expiration date on the writ or until 
 the judgment, interest, and costs are paid off, 
 whichever occurs first. A nonperiodic writ of garnishment (form MC 13) is used to garnish the judgmentdebtor™s bank account or other property. Once
 money has been garnished under thenonperiodic writ, the writ is no longer valid. Ifthere is a remaining balance due on the 
 judgment, you must get another writ to collectmore money. 
 An income tax writ of garnishment (form MC 52) is used to intercept the judgment debtor™s income tax refund. Once the tax refund
 has been intercepted by the Department of Treasury, the writ is no longer valid. If there is a
 remaining balance due on the judgment, you 
 must get another writ to collect more money. 
 Write or type in the names and addresses
 of the defendant (judgment debtor) and thegarnishee on the ﬁRequestﬂ part of the form. The garnishee is the person or business whohas control or possession of the judgmentdebtor™s money. After you complete the
 ﬁRequest, ﬂ you must file it with the district courtthat entered your small claims judgment. The
 filing fee is $15. The court will issue the ﬁWritﬂ (order) by
 signing the form. The 
 Request and Writ for Garnishment must be served on the garnisheealong with the Garnishee Disclosure, form MC 14. There is a $6 disclosure fee for a garnishment
 of periodic payments and income tax refund. The cost of serving the writ varies. When do I get my Money from the Garnishment? The garnishee has 14 days 
 after the writ is served to let you, the court, 
 and the judgment debtor know if any money is 
 available for garnishment. This information will 
 be provided on the Garnishee Disclosure, form MC 14. If you are trying to garnish the judgment
 debtor™s wages, you will only receive part of the
 wages, calculated by using a federal formula. If money is available, it will be withheld fromthe judgment debtor right away. However, this
 money will be held for 28 days to allow thejudgment debtor time to object. If the judgmentdebtor files no objections with the court, thewithheld money will be automatically sent to youafter 28 days. If the garnishment is for periodicpayments, money will continue to be sent to youas payments become due to the judgment debtor
 until the writ expires. What Else can I do? If your case against the judgment debtorinvolved a traffic accident, you can ask the
 court for an abstract of judgment, which wouldsuspend the judgment debtor™s Michigan driver™s
 license until s/he pays the judgment. You must
 wait 30 days after the date of judgment until youcan get an abstract of judgment. You need to
 provide the judgment debtor™s full name, date of
 birth, and Michigan driver™s license number. 
 There is no filing fee. The court clerk should
 have the necessary forms. Michigan Legal Help. org has tools that can help you with small claims cases. MCL 600. 8409 (2)
