MICHIGAN CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT 

CANON 1.   

A Judge Should Uphold the Integrity and Independence of the Judiciary. 

An  independent  and  honorable  judiciary  is  indispensable  to justice  in  our  society.  
A judge should participate in establishing, maintaining, and enforcing, and should 
personally  observe,  high  standards  of  conduct  so  that  the  integrity  and 
independence of the judiciary may be preserved.  A judge should always be aware 
that  the  judicial  system  is  for  the  benefit  of  the  litigant  and  the  public,  not  the 
judiciary.    The  provisions  of  this  code  should  be  construed  and  applied  to  further 
those objectives. 

CANON 2.   

A Judge Should Avoid Impropriety and the Appearance of Impropriety in 
All Activities. 

A. Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by irresponsible or improper conduct 
by judges.  A judge must avoid all impropriety and appearance of impropriety.  A 
judge  must  expect  to  be  the  subject  of  constant  public  scrutiny.    A  judge  must 
therefore  accept  restrictions  on  conduct  that  might  be  viewed  as  burdensome  by 
the ordinary citizen and should do so freely and willingly. 

B. A  judge  should  respect  and  observe  the  law.    At  all  times,  the  conduct  and 
manner  of  a  judge  should  promote  public  confidence  in  the  integrity  and 
impartiality  of  the  judiciary.    Without  regard  to  a  person’s  race,  gender,  or  other 
protected  personal  characteristic,  a  judge  should  treat  every  person  fairly,  with 
courtesy and respect. 

C. A  judge  should  not  allow  family,  social,  or  other  relationships  to  influence 
judicial  conduct  or  judgment.    A  judge  should  not  use  the  prestige  of  office  to 
advance  personal  business  interests  or  those  of  others,  but  participation  in 
activities allowed in Canon 4 is not a violation of this principle. 

D. A judge should not appear as a witness in a court proceeding unless subpoenaed. 

E. A judge may respond to requests for personal references. 

F. A judge should not allow activity as a member of an organization to cast doubt 
on  the  judge’s  ability  to  perform  the  function  of  the  office  in  a  manner  consistent 
with  the  Michigan  Code  of  Judicial  Conduct,  the  laws  of  this  state,  and  the 
Michigan and United States Constitutions.  A judge should be particularly cautious 
with regard to membership activities that discriminate, or appear to discriminate, 
on the basis of race, gender, or other protected personal characteristic.  Nothing in

this paragraph should be interpreted to diminish a judge’s right to the free exercise 
of religion. 

G. No  judge  may  accept  any  contribution  of  money,  directly  or  indirectly,  for  a 
campaign  deficit  or  for  expenses  associated  with  judicial  office.    Requests  for 
payment  of  membership  dues  or  fees  in  a  judicial  association  do  not  constitute 
solicitation of funds for purposes of this provision. 

CANON 3.   

A Judge Should Perform the Duties of Office Impartially and Diligently. 

The  judicial  duties  of  a  judge  take  precedence  over  all  other  activities.    Judicial 
duties  include  all  the  duties  of  office  prescribed  by  law.    In  the  performance  of 
these duties, the following standards apply: 

A. Adjudicative Responsibilities: 

(1) A judge should be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence 
in it.  A judge should be unswayed by partisan interests, public clamor, or fear 
of criticism. 

(2) A  judge  may  require  lawyers,  court  personnel,  and  litigants  to  be 
appropriately attired for court and should enforce reasonable rules of conduct in 
the courtroom. 

(3) A  judge  should  be  patient,  dignified,  and  courteous  to  litigants,  jurors, 
witnesses,  lawyers,  and  others  with  whom  the  judge  deals  in  an  official 
capacity,  and  should  require  similar  conduct  of  lawyers,  and  of  staff,  court 
officials, and others subject to the judge’s direction and control. 

(4) A  judge  shall  not  initiate,  permit,  or  consider  ex  parte  communications,  or 
consider  other  communications  made  to  the  judge  outside  the  presence  of  the 
parties concerning a pending or impending proceeding, except as follows: 

judge  may  allow  ex  parte  communications 

for  scheduling, 
(a) A 
administrative  purposes,  or  emergencies  that  do  not  deal  with  substantive 
matters or issues on the merits, provided: 

(i) the judge reasonably believes that no party or counsel for a party will 
gain  a  procedural  or  tactical  advantage  as  a  result  of  the  ex  parte 
communication, and  

(ii)  the  judge  makes  provision  promptly  to  notify  all  other  parties  and 
counsel  for  parties  of  the  substance  of  the  ex  parte  communication  and 
allows an opportunity to respond.  

(b)  A  judge  may  obtain  the  advice  of  a  disinterested  expert  on  the  law 
applicable  to  a  proceeding  before  the  judge  if  the  judge  gives  notice  to  the 

Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct

parties of the person consulted and the substance of the advice, and affords 
the parties reasonable opportunity to respond. 

(c)  A  judge  may  consult  with  court  personnel  whose  function  is  to  aid  the 
judge  in  carrying  out  the  judge’s  adjudicative  responsibilities  or  with  other 
judges. 

(d) A judge may, with the consent of the parties, confer separately with the 
parties  and  their  lawyers  in  an  effort  to  mediate  or  settle  matters  pending 
before the judge. 

(e)  A  judge  may  initiate  or  consider  any  ex  parte  communications  when 
expressly authorized by law to do so. 

(5) A judge should dispose promptly of the business of the court. 

(6) A  judge  shall  not  make  any  public  statement  that  might  reasonably  be 
expected  to  affect  the  outcome  or  impair  the  fairness  of  a  matter  pending  or 
impending in any court. 

(7) A judge shall not, in connection with cases, controversies, or issues that are 
likely  to  come  before  the  court,  make  pledges,  promises,  or  commitments  that 
are  inconsistent  with  the  impartial  performance  of  the  adjudicative  duties  of 
judicial office. 

(8)  A  judge  shall  require  court  staff,  court  officials,  and  others  subject  to  the 
judge’s direction and control to refrain from making statements that the judge 
would be prohibited from making by paragraphs (6) and (7). 

(9) Notwithstanding the restrictions in paragraph (6), a judge may make public 
statements  in  the  course  of  official  duties,  may  explain  court  procedures,  and 
may comment on any proceeding in which the judge is a litigant in a personal 
capacity. 

(10) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (6), a judge may respond directly 
or  through  a  third  party  to  allegations  in  the  media  or  other  forms  of 
communication concerning the judge’s conduct in a matter. 

(11) A  judge  should  prohibit  broadcasting,  televising,  recording,  or  taking  of 
photographs  in  or  out  of  the  courtroom  during  sessions  of  court  or  recesses 
between sessions except as authorized by the Supreme Court. 

(12) A judge may properly intervene in a trial of a case to promote expedition, 
and  prevent  unnecessary  waste  of  time,  or  to  clear  up  some  obscurity,  but  the 
judge should bear in mind that undue interference, impatience, or participation 
in the examination of witnesses, or a severe attitude on the judge’s part toward 
witnesses,  especially  those  who  are  excited  or  terrified  by  the  unusual 
circumstances  of  a  trial,  may  tend  to  prevent  the  proper  presentation  of  the 
cause, or the ascertainment of truth in respect thereto.

Conversation between the judge and counsel in court is often necessary, but the 
judge  should  be  studious  to  avoid  controversies  that  are  apt  to  obscure  the 
merits  of  the  dispute  between  litigants  and  lead  to  its  unjust  disposition.    In

litigants,  or  witnesses,  the 

A  judge  should  avoid  interruptions  of  counsel  in  their  arguments  except  to 
clarify their positions, and should not be tempted to the unnecessary display of 
learning or a premature judgment. 

(13)  A  judge  should  adopt  the  usual  and  accepted  methods  of  doing  justice; 
avoid the imposition of humiliating acts or discipline, not authorized by law in 
sentencing  and  endeavor  to  conform  to  a  reasonable  standard  of  punishment 
and  not  seek  popularity  or  publicity  either  by  exceptional  severity  or  undue 
leniency. 

(14)  Without  regard  to  a  person’s  race,  gender,  or  other  protected  personal 
characteristic,  a  judge  should  treat  every  person  fairly,  with  courtesy  and 
respect.  To the extent possible, a judge should require staff, court officials, and 
others who are subject to the judge’s direction and control to provide such fair, 
courteous, and respectful treatment to persons who have contact with the court. 

B. Administrative Responsibilities: 

(1) A judge should diligently discharge administrative responsibilities, maintain 
professional  competence

performance  of  the  administrative  responsibilities  of  other  judges  and  court 
officials.

(2) A judge should direct staff and court officials subject to the judge’s control to 
observe  high  standards  of  fidelity,  diligence,  and  courtesy  to  litigants,  jurors, 
witnesses, lawyers, and others with whom they deal in their official capacity. 

(3) A judge should take or initiate appropriate disciplinary measures against a 
judge  or  lawyer  for  unprofessional  conduct  of  which  the  judge  may  become 
aware. 

(4) A  judge  should  not  cause  unnecessary  expense  by  making  unnecessary 
appointments.  All appointments shall be based upon merit. 

(5)  A  judge  should  not  approve  compensation  beyond  the  fair  value  of  services 
rendered. 

C. Disqualification: 

A judge should raise the issue of disqualification whenever the judge has cause to 
believe that grounds for disqualification may exist under MCR 2.003(C). 

D. Waiver of Disqualification. 

A disqualification of a judge may be waived as provided by MCR 2.003(E).

CANON 4.   

A Judge May Engage in Extrajudicial Activities. 

As a judicial officer and person specially learned in the law, a judge is in a unique 
position  to  contribute  to  the  improvement  of  the  law,  the  legal  system,  and  the 
administration of justice, including revision of substantive and procedural law and 
improvement of criminal and juvenile justice.  To the extent that time permits, the 
judge  is  encouraged  to  do  so,  either  independently  or  through  a  bar  association, 
judicial conference, or other organization dedicated to the improvement of the law.  
A judge should regulate extrajudicial activities to minimize the risk of conflict with 
judicial duties. 

A judge may engage in the following activities: 

A. Law-Related Activities. 

(1) A judge may speak, write, lecture, teach, and participate in other activities 
concerning the law, the legal system, and the administration of justice. 

(2) A  judge  may  appear  at  a  public  hearing  before  an  executive  or  legislative 
body  or  official  on  matters  concerning  the  law,  the  legal  system,  and  the 
administration  of  justice,  and  may  otherwise  consult  with  such  executive  or 
legislative body or official on such matters. 

(3) A  judge  may  serve  as  a  member,  officer,  or  director  of  an  organization  or 
governmental agency devoted to the improvement of the law, the legal system, 
or  the  administration  of  justice.    A  judge  may  participate  in  the  management 
and investment of such an organization’s funds. 

(4) A  judge  may  make  recommendations  to  public  and  private  fund-granting 
agencies on projects and programs concerning the law, the legal system, and the 
administration of justice. 

B. Avocational Activities.  A judge may write, lecture, teach, speak, and consult on 
nonlegal  subjects,  appear  before  public  nonlegal  bodies,  and  engage  in  the  arts, 
sports, and other social and recreational activities, if such avocational activities do 
not  detract  from  the  dignity  of  the  office  or  interfere  with  the  performance  of 
judicial duties. 

C. Civic and Charitable Activities.  A judge may participate in civic and charitable 
activities  that  do  not  reflect  adversely  upon  the  judge’s  impartiality  or  interfere 
with  the  performance  of  judicial  duties.    A  judge  may  serve  and  be  listed  as  an 
officer,  director,  trustee,  or  nonlegal  advisor  of  a  bona  fide  educational,  religious, 
charitable, fraternal, or civic organization.  A judge should not serve if it is likely 
that  the  organization  will  be  engaged  in  proceedings  that  would  ordinarily  come 
before the judge or will be regularly engaged in adversary proceedings in any court. 

D. Fundraising  Activities.    A  judge  should  not  individually  solicit  funds  for  any 
fraternal,  or  civic  organization  or  any 
educational,  religious,  charitable, 

Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct

organization  or  governmental  agency  devoted  to  the  improvement  of  the  law,  the 
legal  system,  or  the  administration  of  justice  or  use  or  permit  the  use  of  the 
prestige of the office for that purpose.  A judge may, however, serve as a member of 
an  honorary  committee  or  may  join  a  general  appeal  on  behalf  of  such  an 
organization.    A  judge  may  speak  or  receive  an  award  or  other  recognition  in 
connection  with  an  event  of  such  an  organization.    A  judge  may  allow  his  or  her 
name or title to be used in advertising the judge’s involvement in an event so long 
as the judge does not individually solicit funds. 

E. Financial Activities. 

(1)  A  judge  should  refrain  from  financial  and  business  dealings  that  tend  to 
reflect adversely on the judge’s impartiality or judicial office, interfere with the 
proper performance of judicial duties, exploit the judicial position, or involve the 
judge in frequent transactions with lawyers or persons likely to come before the 
court on which the judge serves. 

(2) Subject  to  the  requirements  of  E(1),  a  judge  may  hold  and  manage 
investments,  including  real  estate,  and  engage  in  other  remunerative  activity, 
but  should  not  serve  as  director,  officer,  manager,  advisor,  or  employee  of  any 
business.  Provided, however, with respect to a judge holding office and serving 
as  an  officer,  director,  manager,  advisor,  or  employee  of  any  business  not 
prohibited  heretofore  by  law  or  judicial  canon,  the  effective  date  of  the 
prohibition  contained  herein  shall  be  the  date  of  expiration  of  the  judge’s 
current judicial term of office. 

(3) A  judge  should  manage  investments  and  other  financial  interests  to 
minimize the number of cases in which the judge is disqualified.  As soon as it 
can  be  done  without  serious  financial  detriment,  the  judge  should  dispose  of 
investments and other financial interests that require frequent disqualification. 

(4) Neither  a  judge  nor  a  family  member  residing  in  the  judge’s  household 
should accept a gift, bequest, favor, or loan from anyone except as follows: 

(a)  A  judge  may  accept  a  gift  or  gifts  not  to  exceed  a  total  value  of  $375, 
incident  to  a  public  testimonial;  books  supplied  by  publishers  on  a 
complimentary basis for official use; or an invitation to the judge and spouse 
to  attend  a  bar-related  function  or  activity  devoted  to  the  improvement  of 
the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice. 

(b) A judge or a family member residing in the judge’s household may accept 
ordinary  social  hospitality;  a  gift,  bequest,  favor,  or  loan  from  a  relative;  a 
wedding or engagement gift; a loan from a lending institution in its regular 
course of business on the same terms generally available to persons who are 
not  judges;  or  a  scholarship  or  fellowship  awarded  on  the  same  terms 
applied to other applicants. 

(c) A judge or a family member residing in the judge’s household may accept 
any other gift, bequest, favor, or loan only if the donor is not a party or other

person whose interests have come or are likely to come before the judge, and 
if the aggregate value of gifts received by a judge or family member residing 
in the judge’s household from any source exceeds $375, the judge reports it 
in the same manner as compensation is reported in Canon 6C.  For purposes 
of reporting gifts under this subsection, any gift with a fair market value of 
$150  or  less  need  not  be  aggregated  to  determine  if  the  $375  reporting 
threshold has been met. 

(5)  For  the  purposes  of  this  section,  “family  member  residing  in  the  judge’s 
household”  means  any  relative  of  a  judge  by  blood  or  marriage,  or  a  person 
treated by a judge as a family member, who resides in the judge’s household. 

(6) A judge is not required by this code to disclose income, debts, or investments, 
except as provided in this canon and Canons 3 and 6. 

(7) Information acquired by a judge in a judicial capacity should not be used or 
disclosed by the judge in financial dealings or for any other purpose not related 
to judicial duties. 

F.  Fiduciary  Activities.    A  judge  should  not  serve  as  an  executor,  administrator, 
testamentary  trustee,  or  guardian,  except  for  the  estate,  testamentary  trust,  or 
person of a member of the judge’s immediate family, and then only if such service 
will  not  interfere  with  the  proper  performance  of  judicial  duties.    As  a  family 
fiduciary, a judge is subject to the following restrictions: 

(1) A judge should not serve if it is likely that as such fiduciary the judge will be 
engaged  in  proceedings  that  would  ordinarily  come  before  the  judge  or  if  the 
estate, trust, or ward becomes involved in adversary proceedings in the court on 
which the judge serves or one under its appellate jurisdiction. 

(2) While acting as such fiduciary, a judge is subject to the same restrictions on 
financial activities that apply in the judge’s personal capacity. 

G. Arbitration.  A judge should not act as an arbitrator or mediator, except in the 
performance of judicial duties. 

H.  Practice  of  Law.    A  judge  should  not  practice  law  for  compensation  except  as 
otherwise provided by law. 

I.  Extra-judicial  Appointments.    A  judge  should  not  accept  appointment  to  a 
governmental  committee,  commission,  or  other  position  that  is  concerned  with 
issues of fact or policy on matters other than the improvement of the law, the legal 
system,  or  the  administration  of  justice.    A  judge,  however,  may  represent  the 
country, state, or locality on ceremonial occasions or in connection with historical, 
educational, and cultural activities.

Applicability of the Code of Judicial Conduct to Judicial Candidates. 

All judicial candidates are subject to Canon 1, Canon 2, Canon 4A-4D and Canon 7 
of  the  Code  of  Judicial  Conduct  as  applicable  during  a  judicial  campaign.    A 
successful candidate, whether or not an incumbent, and an unsuccessful candidate 
who  is  a  judge,  are  subject  to  judicial  discipline  for  campaign  misconduct.    An 
unsuccessful  candidate  who  is  a  lawyer  is  subject  to  lawyer  discipline  for  judicial 
campaign misconduct. 

CANON 5.   

CANON 6.   

A Judge Should Regularly File Reports of Compensation Received for Quasi-
Judicial and Extra-Judicial Activities and of Monetary Contributions. 

A  judge  may  receive  compensation  and  reimbursement  of  expenses  for  the  quasi-
judicial  and  extra-judicial  activities  permitted  by  this  code,  if  the  source  of  such 
payments does not give the appearance of influencing the judge in judicial duties or 
otherwise give the appearance of impropriety, subject to the following restrictions: 

A.  Compensation.    Compensation  should  not  exceed  a  reasonable  amount  nor 
should  it  exceed  what  a  person  who  is  not  a  judge  would  receive  for  the  same 
activity. 

B.  Expense  Reimbursement.    Expense  reimbursement  should  be  limited  to  the 
actual cost of travel, food, and lodging reasonably incurred by the judge and, where 
appropriate to the occasion, by the judge’s spouse.  Any payment in excess of such 
an amount is compensation. 

C. Public Reports.  A judge shall report the date, place, and nature of any activity 
for  which  the  judge  received  compensation,  and  the  name  of  the  payor  and  the 
amount  of  compensation  so  received.    The  judge’s  report  shall  be  made  at  least 
annually  and  shall  be  filed  as  a  public  document  in  the  office  of  the  State  Court 
Administrator or other office designated by law.

B. Campaign Conduct: 

(1) A candidate, including an incumbent judge, for a judicial office:

conduct that apply to the judge; 

(b)  should  prohibit  public  employees  subject  to  the  judge’s  direction  or 
control  from  doing  for  the  judge  what  the  judge  is  prohibited  from  doing 
under this canon; 

(c) shall not, in connection with cases, controversies, or issues that are likely 
to  come  before  the  court,  make  pledges,  promises,  or  commitments  about 
conduct in office that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the

(c) Such committees may solicit and accept campaign contributions from the 
public, including lawyers, as permitted by law.

contribute  campaign  funds  to  pay  some  of  the  costs  associated  with  the 
publication  of  the  endorsement  or  ranking  of  the  candidate,  provided  the 
candidate secures from the endorsing organization an assurance, before the 
endorsement or ranking is made, that the endorsing organization will not: 

(i)  demand  payment  from  the  candidate  or  the  candidate’s  agent  as  a 
condition of the endorsement or favorable ranking,  

(ii)  seek  any  assurance  from  the  candidate  before  the  endorsement  or 
ranking is made that it will be paid if it endorses or ranks the candidate 
favorably,  

(iii) add an endorsement or favorable ranking of a different candidate in 
the  event  that  the  initially  supported  candidate  decides  not  to  pay  the 
endorsing  organization  for  publicizing  its  endorsement  and  favorable 
ranking,  

(iv) prevent the candidate from publicizing the endorsement or favorable 
ranking independent of the endorsing organization, regardless of whether 
the endorsing organization itself publicizes its endorsement or  favorable 
ranking.  

(3)  No  judge  should  personally  sell  or  permit  any  court  or  public  employee 
working  for  or  assigned  to  any  court  to  sell  fund-raising  tickets  or  accept 
contributions of any kind on the judge’s behalf or on behalf of any other judicial 
candidate.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
