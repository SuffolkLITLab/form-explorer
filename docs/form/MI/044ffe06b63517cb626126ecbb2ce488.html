guardianship, placement with a fit and willing relative, or adoption.
1. No relative has been identified who is appropriate or available to assume the permanent custody of the child.
2. The current caregiver is not an adoptive resource.
3. Reasonable efforts to recruit an adoptive home have been unsuccessful.
4. The child does not want to be adopted and is of an age where due consideration must be given to his/her wishes.
5. It is contrary to the child’s best interests to break the child’s attachment to the current caregivers.
6. The current caregiver is committed to providing a permanent placement for the child.
7. The placement allows the siblings to remain together.
8. The child’s special needs can best be met in this placement.
9. The child wants to remain in the current placement, which is only available as foster care.
10.  The placement is preparing the child for transition into independent living (specify the services being provided to the

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
