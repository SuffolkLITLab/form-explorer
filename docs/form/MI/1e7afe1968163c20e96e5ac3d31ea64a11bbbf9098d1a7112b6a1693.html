 IMPORTANT NOTICE
 By using this forms packet you are representing yourself in a court action to get a personal protection order. In order to receive the protection or action you seek, you must follow the instructions in this booklet and on
 the forms. If you fail to do even one of the required steps, the order you get from the court could be ineffective
 
 and you could remain unprotected. The three most important things you will have to do are: 1) get the order signed by the judge. 
 2) provide legal notice of the court's order to the person to be restrained. 
 
 3) follow up with the law enforcement agency to make sure they entered the order on LEIN. 
 This booklet will help you with these duties. Here are some things you may need before you fill out the forms. ŁForms and instructions. ŁMoney to pay the costs of serving papers on the restrained person. Service may cost between
 $10. 00 and $100. 00. ŁInformation about the person to be restrained such as name, date of birth, age, address, placeof employment, physical description, etc. ŁCopies of divorce, annulment, separate maintenance, paternity, support, custody or any otherjudgments or orders involving you and the person you want restrained. 
 ŁNotarized, written statements from witnesses if there are any. ŁCopies of supporting documents or materials (reports from police, social agencies, 
 doctors, or hospitals) if there are any. This information is important for the judge in
 
 making a decision, but is not necessary for the judge to enter an order. Now complete the forms that fit your situation. If you don't understand something on the forms, askthe circuit court clerk to explain the terms or process to you. 
 After you have filled out the forms, go to the Table of Contents on the front of this booklet and find out
 which pages you need to read for directions on how to get your personal protection order. 
 Read theseinstructions carefully. You are acting as your own attorney and these instructions will help you
 
 with the legal process. The laws of Michigan do not allow the employees of the court or the judge
 
 to give you legal advice. If you require special accommodations to use the court because of a disability, please contact the courtimmediately to make arrangements. Page 2 Follow these steps if you have requested an ex parte order (order without ahearing) on Form CC 375 or Form CC 377. 
 1. Fill out the forms that apply to your situation
 using the instructions on the forms. 
 2. File the Petition and Order form with the county clerk. 
 Take the forms to the circuit court clerk in the county where you are seeking the order. Bring 3 sets
 of statements from witnesses and supporting documents if you have any. The circuit court clerk will finish filling out the form, will attach your written statements andsupporting documents to the proper copies, and will return copies of both forms to you. Donot lose these copies. What you should have when you leave the clerk's office: Green, Blue, Pink, and Yellow copies of CC 375 or CC 377 All 6 copies of CC 376 or CC 3803. Get the order signed.

 soon as possible. Leave the green copy of the petition form (with attachments) and all copies
 
 of the order form with the judge's staff. Ask when to come back for the signed order.

What you should have when you leave the judge's office: White, Green, Blue, Pink, Yellow, and Goldenrod copies of CC 376 or CC 380 If the judge will not sign the order without a hearing, he or she must state the reasons inwriting at that time. Ask for a copy of these written reasons. If you are told you can request
 
 a hearing and want to schedule one, return to the circuit court clerk to do so (see page 5) . 5. Return to the circuit court clerk.

 Page 6 How to Serve Copies of FormsŁTo serve the respondent in person
 , you can either pay a process server or sheriff or havea willing friend or relative do it for you. You cannot serve the respondent yourself. If you
 can't pay the service fee for a process server, have a friend or relative do it. If you choose
 
 a friend or relative to serve the papers, they must be over 18 years old. Pick a friend who will
 
 not be a witness in the case. If a friend or relative serves the papers, proof of service mustbe notarized. Personal service takes from several days to several weeks. 
 Give the process server or your friend: Blue copies - for respondent
 Goldenrod copy - for law enforcement
 Yellow copies - for proof of service Once the blue copies of the forms are delivered to the respondent, the person who did theserving must fill out the Proofs of Service and return them to the county clerk as explained
 on pages 4 through 6. If a friend or relative served the forms, get the forms notarized. If these copies come back to you instead, take them to the circuit court clerk as soon as
 possible. ŁTo serve the respondent by registered mail
 with delivery restricted to the respondent, go
 to the post office and pay to have the blue copies of the forms mailed to the respondent. 
 Service by mail is cheaper than hiring a process server. It takes from several days to a week. 
 Once the forms have been delivered, you will receive a green card (the return receipt) in themail. Make sure the respondent signed the green card. Make a copy of the return receipt. 
 
 Attach the original return receipt to the yellow copies of the petition and order form. Attach
 
 the copied return receipt to the goldenrod copy of the order. Fill out proofs of service as
 
 explained on pages 4 through 6. ŁIf you are unable to serve the respondent as indicated above, you may ask the court for
 permission to serve by first class mail or another method. 
 Ask the circuit court clerk for
 form MC 303, Motion and Verification for Alternate Service. Fill out the form and file it with
 
 the circuit court clerk. If the judge permits alternate service, Form MC 304 (Order for
 
 Alternate Service) will be prepared by the court and you can then serve the petition and/or
 other forms in the manner the court approves. If service by first class mail was approved by the court, place the blue copy of the form inan envelope. Then go to the post office to get it mailed. Ask for a postal receipt. Service
 
 by first class mail is cheaper than registered mail or personal service and takes from several
 days to a week. Fill out proofs of service as explained on pages 4 through 6. 
 Page 7 Information About the Hearing
 If you require special accommodations to use the court because of disabilities, please contact thecourt immediately to make arrangements. 1. If the circuit court clerk tells you a hearing is required, go to the judge's court room on thescheduled day and time. Dress neatly. Get there 10 or 15 minutes early. Be prepared to spend
 
 most of the morning or afternoon in court. 2. Bring all copies of your papers with you including the personal protection order form. Bring
 paper and a pencil so you can make notes. Bring witnesses willing to testify if you have any. 
 3. Go into the courtroom and tell the clerk (sitting near the judge's bench) your name, that youare there for a hearing, and you are representing yourself. Hand the personal protection order
 
 form to the clerk and then take a seat in the back of the courtroom and wait for your case to
 be called. 4. When your case is called, go to the podium and clearly tell the judge: 
 1) your name 2) that you are representing yourself
 3) that you need a personal protection order or that you are asking that a personalprotection order be modified or terminated and the reasons why 4) whether you have witnesses in court who are willing to testify Answer the judge's questions clearly and directly. If the judge wants to hear from other
 witnesses, ask them to tell the court what they saw or know regarding your situation. 5. If the other party is in court, he or she will have a chance to speak also. When the other party
 talks, take notes. Do not try to interrupt the other party. After the other party speaks, you
 
 will have another chance to talk. Taking notes will help you with this. 
 6. If the judge says that the order is granted, he or she will complete the order and sign it andreturn it to you. After the order is signed, go to the clerk and ask for true copies of the order. 
 
 Then serve the order. 7. If the judge does not grant the order, he or she will state the reasons on the record and completean Order Denying or Dismissing Petition for Personal Protection Order (form CC 383) . You
 
 will be given a copy of the signed order. Page 8</div>
