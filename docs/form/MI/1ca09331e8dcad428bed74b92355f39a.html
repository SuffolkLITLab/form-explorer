RULES FOR THE BOARD OF LAW EXAMINERS 

Rule 1.  General Requirements. 

An applicant for admission to the practice of law must 

(A) be 18 years old or older; 

(B) possess good moral character; and 

(C)  have  completed,  before  entering  law  school,  at  least  60  semester  hours  or  90 
quarter  hours  toward  an  undergraduate  degree  from  an  accredited  school  or  while 
attending an accredited junior or community college. 

Rule 2.  Admission by Examination. 

(A)  An  application  must  be  filed  by  November  1  for  the  February  examination,  or 
March  1  for  the  July  examination.    Late  applications  will  be  accepted  until 
December  15  for  the  February  examination,  or  May  15  for  the  July  examination.  
An application must be accompanied by payment of the fee.  All materials filed are 
confidential. 

(B)  Before  taking  the  examination,  an  applicant  must  obtain  a  JD  degree  from  a 
reputable and qualified law school that 

(1)  is  incorporated  in  the  United  States,  its  territories,  or  the  District  of 
Columbia; and 

(2)  requires  for  graduation  3  school years  of  study  for  full-time students,  and  4 
school years of study for part-time or night students.  A school year must be at 
least 30 weeks.  

A law school approved by the American Bar Association is reputable and qualified.  
Other schools may ask the Board to approve the school as reputable and qualified.  
In  the  event  the  law school  has  ceased  operations  since  an  applicant’s  graduation, 
the  request  for  approval  may  be  made  by  the  applicant.    The  Board  may  in  its 
discretion permit applicants who do not possess a JD degree from an ABA-approved 
law school to take the examination based upon factors including, but not limited to, 
relevant legal education, such as an LLM degree from a reputable and qualified law 
school,  and  experience  that  otherwise  qualifies  the  applicant  to  take  the 
examination. 

(C) The State Bar character and fitness committee will investigate each applicant.  
The  applicant  must  disclose  any  criminal  conviction  which  carries  a  possible 
penalty of incarceration in jail or prison that has not been reversed or vacated and 
comply with the committee’s requirements and requests.  The committee will report 
the results of its investigation to the Board.  If the committee report shows that an 
applicant  lacks  the  necessary  character  and  fitness,  the  Board  will  review  the 
application,  record,  and  report.    If  the  Board  accepts  the  report,  the  applicant  is 
entitled  to  a  hearing  before  the  Board  and  may  use  the  Board’s  subpoena  power.

examination immediately following graduation to take an earlier examination.  The 
applicant  must  have completed,  before  the  examination,  21/2  years  full-time  or  31/2 
years part-time study.  The Board will release the applicant’s grade when the school

Rule 3.  Examination Administration. 

(A) The examination shall be the Uniform Bar Examination (UBE) as prepared and

NCBE.  The UBE consists of: 

(1) The Multistate Bar Examination (MBE) 

(2) The Multistate Essay Examination (MEE) 

(3) Two Multistate Performance Test items (MPT) 

(B)  The  NCBE  will  grade  the  MBE.    The  Board  or  its  agents  will  grade  the  MEE 
and  the  MPT,  with  the  Board  having  final  responsibility.    The  Board  will  adopt 
policies for grading that are consistent with the sound testing practices followed by 
all jurisdictions that administer the UBE.  The policies shall include a provision for 
the NCBE to convert the raw scores on the written portion of the examination to the 
MBE  scale  by  the  methodology  used  for  UBE  jurisdictions.    The  Board  will 
determine a method for selecting a passing score.  

(C)  To  earn  a  portable  UBE  score  that  is  transferable  to  other  UBE  jurisdictions, 
persons taking the UBE in Michigan shall sit for and take all components of the bar 
examination in a single administration. 

(D)  An  applicant’s  raw  bar  examination  score  shall  be  provided  to  the  NCBE  to 
calculate  scaled  scores.    Upon  request  by  an  applicant,  the  NCBE  will  certify  and 
transfer  the  applicant’s  scaled  score,  scaled  MBE  score,  and  total  UBE  score  to 
other UBE jurisdictions.  The NCBE may also release to an applicant, upon request 
by  the  applicant,  the  applicant’s  scaled  MBE  score,  scaled  written  score,  and  total 
UBE score.

school in the United States, its districts, or its territories; or

States armed forces as a judge advocate, legal specialist, or legal officer.  The 
judge advocate general (or a comparable officer) or delegate must certify the

The  Board  may,  for  good  cause,  increase  the  5-year  period.    Active  duty  in  the 
United  States  armed  forces  not  satisfying  Rule  5(A)(5)(c)  may  be  excluded  when 
computing the 5-year period. 

(6) Complete any Michigan Law Component requirement set out in Rule 3a. 

(B)  An  applicant  must  submit  the  National  Conference  of  Bar Examiners’  Request 
for  Preparation  of  a  Character  Report  along  with  other  material  required  by  the 
Board and payment of the fees. 

(C) An applicant not satisfying Rule 5(A) will be notified and given an opportunity 
to appear before the Board.  The applicant may use the Board’s subpoena power. 

(D)  An  applicant  for  whom  a  certificate  of  admission  is  issued  must  take  the  oath 
and become a member of the State Bar of Michigan within three years of the date 
the certificate is issued.  Otherwise, the applicant must reapply. 

(E) An attorney 

(1)  ineligible  for  admission  without  examination  because  of  the  inability  to 
satisfy Rule 5(A)(5); and 

(2)  practicing  law  in  an  institutional  setting,  e.g.,  counsel  to  a  corporation  or 
instructor  in  a  law  school,  may  apply  to  the  Board  for  a  special  certificate  of 
qualification  to  practice  law.    The  applicant  must  satisfy  Rule  5(A)(1)-(3),  and 
comply with Rule 5(B).  The Board may then issue the special certificate, which 
will entitle the attorney to continue current employment if the attorney becomes 
an  active  member  of  the  State  Bar.    The  special  certificate  permits  attorneys 
teaching  or  supervising  law  students  in  a  clinical  program  to  represent  the 
clients of that clinical program.  If the attorney leaves the current employment, 
the special certificate automatically expires; if the attorney’s new employment is 
also institutional, the attorney may reapply for another special certificate.

foreign  country  for  at  least  3  of  the  5  years  immediately  preceding  the 
application; and

(2) possess the good moral character and general fitness requisite for a member 
of the bar of this state; and 

(3) fulfill the requirements of MCL 600.934 and 600.937; and 

(4)  be  a  resident  of  this  or  another  state  of  the  United  States,  its  territories  or 
the  District  of  Columbia and  maintain  an office  in  this  state  for  the  practice  of 
law; and 

(5) be over 18 years of age.  

(b) In considering whether to license an applicant to practice pursuant to Rule 5(E), 
the  Board  may  in  its  discretion  take  into  account  whether  a  member  of  the  bar  of 
this  state  would  have  a  reasonable and  practical  opportunity  to  establish  an  office 
for  the  giving  of  legal  advice  to  clients  in  the  applicant’s  country  of  admission  (as 
referred to in Rule 5[E][a][1]), if there is pending with the Board a request to take 
this  factor  into  account  from  a  member  of  the  bar  of  this  state  actively  seeking  to 
establish  such  an  office  in  that  country  which  raises  a  serious  question  as  to  the 
adequacy of the opportunity for such a member to establish such an office.

(1)  a  certificate  from  the  authority  in  such  foreign  country  having  final

admission  to  practice  and  the  date  thereof  and  as  to  the  good  standing  of  such 
attorney  or  counselor  at  law  or  the  equivalent,  together  with  a  duly 
authenticated English translation of such certificate if it is not in English; and 

(2) a letter of recommendation from one of the judges of the highest law court or 
intermediate  appellate  court  of  such  foreign  country,  together  with  a  duly 
authenticated English translation of such letter if it is not in English; and 

(3) the National Conference of Bar Examiners questionnaire and affidavit along 
with the payment of the requisite fee and such other evidence of the applicant’s 
educational  and  professional  qualifications,  good  moral  character  and  general 
fitness, and compliance with the requirements of Rule 5(E)(a)(1)-(5) as the Board 
may require; and 

(4) shall execute and file with the Executive Director of the State Board of Law 
Examiners, in such form and manner as the Board may prescribe, 

(i) a duly acknowledged instrument in writing setting forth the special legal 
consultant’s  address  in  the  state  of  Michigan  and  designating  the  Executive 
Director of  the  State Board  of  Law  Examiners  an  agent  upon whom  process 
may be served, with like effect as if served personally upon the special legal 
consultant, in any action or proceeding thereafter brought against the special 
legal consultant and arising out of or based upon any legal services rendered 
or offered to be rendered by the special legal consultant within or to residents 
of the state of Michigan whenever after due diligence service cannot be made 
upon  the  special legal  consultant  at  such  address  or  at  such  new  address  in

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
