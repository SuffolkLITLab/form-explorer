 INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING FORM MC 406 a FILING AND SERVING A PETITION
 »»DEFINITION: Discontinuing Sex Offender Registration An order discontinuing sex offender registration removes the obligation of an individual, who has been
 convicted or adjudicated of a listed offense as defined in MCL 28. 722, to register and update information
 about himself or herself as required by the Sex Offenders Registration Act. An order discontinuing sex
 offender registration also deletes that individual™s registration information from the Michigan State Police
 sex offender registry database and the public sex offender website. 
 An order discontinuing sex offender registry does not remove a conviction from the individual™s criminal history record. 
 »»FILING A PETITION
 1. 
 Do You Qualify to File a Petition? 
 
 A person who petitions to discontinue sex offender registration must meet certain conditions. To
 
 find out if you qualify to have your registration requirement discontinued, read the following directions. 
 
 Also, if you already filed a petition to discontinue sex offender registration and it was denied after a
 
 court hearing, you cannot file another petition. Michigan law outlines five circumstances describing 
 when an individual is eligible to petition to discontinue sex offender registration: 
 
 Ł 
 If you were convicted as an adult and are a Tier I offender, you may be eligible to petition the
 
 court. To determine what Tier you have been classified in, you can look for your name on the
 
 Michigan Sex Offender Registry Website, www. mipsor. state. mi. us. The definition of Tier I
 
 offender can be found in MCL 28. 722 (r) . If you were convicted as an adult and are a Tier I
 
 offender, answer the questions in Box A on page 4. 
 
 Ł 
 If you were adjudicated when you were a juvenile (less than 17 years of age) and are a Tier
 
 III offender, you may be eligible to petition the court. To determine what Tier you have been
 
 classified in, contact your registering authority. The definition of Tier III offender can be
 
 found in MCL 28. 722 (v) . If you were adjudicated as a juvenile and are a Tier III offender, 
 
 answer the questions in Box B on page 4. 
 
 Ł 
 If you were convicted of an offense listed in MCL 28. 722 (s) , (u) , or (w) that was the result of
 
 a consensual sexual act between you and the victim, you may be eligible to petition the 
 court. Answer the questions in Box C on page 5. 
 
 Ł 
 If you were registered under the Sex Offenders Registration Act before July 1, 2011 for an
 
 offense that required registration but that registration is no longer required on or about July
 
 1, 2011, continue to item 2 on page 5. The Michigan State Police may have made the deter-
 
 mination that you are no longer required to register. Before filing a petition with the court to
 
 discontinue your registration requirements, contact your registering authority to find out if 
 your sex offender registration requirement was already discontinued. 
 
 Ł 
 If you were adjudicated as a juvenile for an offense listed in MCL 28. 722 (s) , (u) , or (w) and
 
 you were less than 14 years of age at the time of the offense, continue to item 2 on page 5. 
 
 The Michigan State Police may have made the determination that you are no longer required
 
 to register. Before filing a petition with the court to discontinue your registration requirements, 
 
 contact your registering authority to find out if your sex offender registration requirement
 
 was already discontinued.

 of a notary public (you can find a notary at a bank) or the clerk of the court. Bring your photo 
 identification with you when you sign the petition. PAGE 5

 If you sign your petition in front of a notary public, you can sign one petition form (see item 5 a for 
 details) and make three additional copies of your petition after it is notarized. If you go to the court 
 in person, make four copies of your petition beforehand and sign all four copies of the petition form 
 (see items 5 b for details) . Either way is acceptable; however, it is a good idea to file your petition in
 
 person with the court. That way, if you have forgotten something or need to change something, you
 
 can take care of it right away. If you decide to sign your petition in front of a notary public, you can
 
 still file your petition in person with the court. 
 5 a Signing Before a Notary Public: Take the petition (form MC 406 a) that you prepared as
 
 directed in item 4 and your photo identification to a notary public. Sign the petition in front of the 
 notary public. There may be a fee for this. 
 
 5 b Signing Before the Clerk of the Court: Make four copies of the petition (form MC 406 a) . 
 Take all four copies and your photo identification to the clerk of the court where you were convicted. 
 
 Sign all four copies of the petition in front of the clerk of the court. 6. 
 Filing the Petition with the Court 
 You can file your petition (form MC 406 a) in person with the court or by mailing it to the court. If you
 
 file by mail, you must include a postage paid envelope in order for the court to return three forms to 
 you after the clerk of the court records the filing of your petition. At the time of filing, the clerk of the
 
 court will write the name of the judge assigned to your case on all four copies of your petition. 
 The clerk of the court will set a hearing date at the time of filing. The clerk of the court will complete
 
 the Notice of Hearing section on all four copies of your petition (form MC 406 a) and return the 
 remaining three copies of the petition to you. »»SERVING THE PETITION
 
 When you receive the three remaining copies of the petition (form MC 406 a) from the court, serve 
 one copy on (mail it to) the prosecuting official by first class mail no later than 30 days before the
 
 hearing date on the petition. Get the address from the clerk or see www. michiganprosecutor. org
 . 7. 
 Fill Out the Proof of Service and File With the Court
 
 You should have two copies of the petition left. One of these copies is for you to keep for your
 
 records. The other copy is for filing proof of service with the court. 
 
 On both copies of the petition, fill out the Certificate of Mailing at the bottom of the form. Write in
 
 the date that you mailed the petition to the prosecuting official. Then date and sign the 
 Certificate 
 of Mailing. 
 After you fill out and sign the Certificate of Mailing, mail one of the remaining petitions (form MC 
 406 a) with the completed Certificate of Mailing to the court. This shows the court that you mailed
 
 a copy to the prosecuting official.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. New names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them.
