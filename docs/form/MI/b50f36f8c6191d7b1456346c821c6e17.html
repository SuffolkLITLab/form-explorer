GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

These forms are for people who have been served with an ex parte order and want to object to and change that
order.  Carefully read and follow all of the instructions before filling out the forms so that you understand the
rights and duties of all parties.

You must act immediately.  The law requires that you file an objection and/or motion within 14 days after you
are served with the ex parte order.  After you file the objection and/or motion, the Friend of the Court is re-
quired to attempt to resolve the dispute.  The law requires the Friend of the Court to do this within 14 days after
they receive your objection.  If the dispute cannot be resolved by the Friend of the Court, the matter will be
scheduled by the Friend of the Court for a hearing.  You may represent yourself at the hearing or have an
attorney represent you.  The Friend of the Court office does not have to make an investigation or report unless
ordered by the court to do so.  The Friend of the Court does not represent either party at this hearing.
