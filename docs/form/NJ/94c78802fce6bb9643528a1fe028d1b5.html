The Judiciary’s recovery court program 
operates within the Superior Court to 
address non-violent drug addicted offenders. 

The program requires completion of distinct 
phases of intensive drug and alcohol 
treatment and recovery. This level of
supervision permits the program to support 
the recovery process but also allows the 
recovery court team to react quickly to 
impose appropriate therapeutic sanctions 
or to reinstate criminal proceedings when 
participants do not comply.

Drug Court name changed to Recovery Court 
in January 2022.

Recovery

Work for 
Me?

For more information about the adult recovery 
court program, go to www.njcourts.gov and 
search for recovery courts. 

Is recovery court a “set up”?
You might have been told that 
recovery court is a set up. Recovery 
court is a program that helps people 
who are abusing drugs and alcohol 
and have been convicted of a crime. 
Recovery court programs have been 
successful for many people like you. 
Recovery court can help you get your 
life back.  

Will I be accepted into recovery 
court?
To participate in New Jersey’s recovery 
court you must have an established 
New Jersey residence and have been 
assessed by a recovery court team. 
You can’t participate in recovery court 
if you have previous convictions or 
pending charges for a violent offense. 
If you have any questions, speak with 
your attorney.  

How long will I be in recovery 
court?
That is up to you. The goal is for  
you to complete the program within  
three years. 

Drug testing
Frequent random drug testing is just 
one of the ways the recovery court 
team helps you in your recovery. Drug 
tests can be taken at probation, at 
court sessions or at other approved 
locations. You can be sanctioned if 
you use drugs or alcohol after having 
stable recovery or if you alter  
drug tests.
 

Your probation officer
Your probation officer will help you 
achieve your goals and succeed in 
the program. You will meet with your 
probation officer in the probation 
office. Your probation officer also will 
visit you at your home and at your 
workplace. Tell everyone in your home 
and your supervisor at work that your 
probation officer will be visiting.  You 
will be supervised in the county where 
you live. 

Where will I go for treatment?
Based on what you need, you could be 
placed in different types of treatment. 
Treatment providers will assist you in 
your recovery by conducting group 
and individual sessions with you. 
Treatment providers are a part of the 
recovery court team. It is important 
that you attend all treatment sessions 
that are scheduled for you. You do not 
have to pay for treatment; it is funded 
by recovery court.  

What about employment and 
school?
While in the recovery court program, 
the team can work with you to get a 
job and continue your education. Many 
participants can have their driver’s 
license reinstated or get a driver’s 
license for the first time. Think about 
the personal goals you want to achieve 
and we can help you reach them.  

Court sessions
At the beginning of the recovery court 
program, you will attend court weekly. 
You will attend court less often as you 

progress in the program. You must be 
on time for court.

Peer support group meetings
During your time in recovery court, 
you will be asked to establish a clean 
and sober network. You can do this 
by attending self-help meetings such 
as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or 
Narcotics Anonymous (NA). Your 
treatment provider will discuss self-
help meeting options with you. 

Sanctions and incentives
If you don’t follow the rules of 
recovery court, you can expect to 
receive certain sanctions. If you have 
done particularly well in certain areas, 
you can expect to receive an incentive 
or reward. Whatever you do, do not 
get discouraged and quit - that will 
not help you get your life back. Only 
working through the hard times will 
produce results. 

Just because you miss a meeting or 
test positive for drugs or alcohol does 
not mean you will be terminated from  
the program. We will work with you. 
We want you to succeed.

Will my record be expunged 
after I graduate?
If you are eligible, your record could  
be expunged after you graduate 
from the recovery court program. 
Expungement is not guaranteed and 
not everyone who graduates is eligible 
for expungement. Your attorney can 
tell you at the time of sentencing if  
you are eligible.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
