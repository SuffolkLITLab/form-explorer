Parent’s Handbook  
and Planner

OVERVIEW

The Division of Child Protection and Permanency (CP&P) is New Jersey’s child 
welfare and child protection agency within the Department of Children and Families 
(DCF) As required by state law (Title 9 and Title 30), CP&P must investigate all 
reports of child abuse and neglect.

State law also requires the Superior Court of New Jersey, Family Part to review the 
decisions and actions CP&P makes and to oversee CP&P cases to ensure the safety 
and well-being of children. Family cases involving CP&P matters are a part of the 
Children in Court (CIC) case system. You are involved in CIC because CP&P filed a 
complaint with the family court stating your CP&P case needs court supervision 
because the children have been or are in danger of being harmed. When a complaint 
is filed, it becomes the responsibility of the family court to determine what is best for 
the children.

Involvement with CP&P and CIC can be overwhelming for parents, children and 
families. This handbook and planner were written to help you understand the 
CIC case system, the different roles of people in CIC and to help you keep track of 
important appointments and court dates. For more information, visit our website at 
www.njcourts.gov and search for family practice division.

Descriptions  
of Hearings

Order to Show Cause Hearing: The first hearing, usually on 
an emergency basis, where CP&P is asking the court to make 
decisions about where your child(ren) will live, who will have 
custody of them and visitation issues. This is not a final decision 
on whether you have been neglectful or abusive, merely 
whether CP&P had the right to take emergency action.

Return Order to Show Cause: The second hearing, 
approximately three weeks after the Order to Show Cause. 
During the time between the Order to Show Cause and 
the Return on the Order to Show Cause, CP&P should have 
continued to investigate the complaint and could have reached 
an agency decision on how it proposes to proceed with safety 
plans, placement options, services and, possibly,  
investigation findings. 

Fact-Finding Trial: In this hearing CP&P must prove you 
committed an act of abuse or neglect.Both CP&P and you are 
given the chance to call witnesses, question or cross-exam the 
CP&P worker and present documentary evidence to the court. 
At the end of the hearing the court will determine whether one 
or all of the children were abused or neglected.

Dispositional Hearing: If the court finds the child(ren) have 
been abused or neglected, the court then determines what the 
next step is to reunify the family or to accomplish an alternative 
goal for the child(ren). This could include the completion of 
evaluations, parenting classes, counseling or substance  
abuse treatment.

Compliance Reviews: Typically scheduled every two to three months to reassess whether the 
child(ren) can return to their parent(s)’ custody. The court also makes sure visitation is occurring  
(if ordered) and everyone is participating in all court ordered services.

Permanency Hearing: Occurs approximately one year after the complaint was filed. This hearing 
is only held if the child(ren) are still in an out of home placement (foster care or relative care). The 
court must determine whether the children can return home at that time or within a short time 
frame. If the child(ren) cannot be safely returned home, then the court will look to a permanent 
plan other than the parents, usually kinship legal guardianship (permanent placement with a 
relative) or adoption. If adoption is approved as the plan, CP&P will be ordered to file a new 
complaint asking the court to terminate your parental rights.

NotesTermination of 
Parental Rights 

Termination of Parental Rights (TPR) is the legal action 
taken to end legal and biological ties to your biological or 
adoptive child. 

TPR is final and results in you having no rights or legal 
authority in decision making for the child. CP&P pursues 
the termination of the parental rights of all parents when a 
child cannot be safely returned to either parent, is not in an 
otherwise permanent placement with relatives, and when 
TPR is necessary to achieve an adoption plan for the child.

Termination of parental rights is a serious matter. If your 
parental rights to your children are terminated, you will no 
longer have the right to visit with them, speak to them on 
the telephone, communicate with them by mail, or  
be told where they are or what is happening to them.

CHILDREN IN COURT  |  PARENT’S HANDBOOK AND CALENDARNotesNEW JERSEY COURTS  |  7

Who Will Be  
In Court

The Judge - In New Jersey, child protection cases are 
heard by family court judges. The judge decides if CP&P 
actions are timely and appropriate, requires CP&P, 
the parents and attorneys to take actions and makes 
decisions to keep the child safe.

Deputy Attorney General - The DAG is the attorney for 
CP&P. The DAG presents CP&P’s position to the court and 
must prove the state’s case.

Law Guardian - The law guardian is your child’s attorney. 
The law guardian is independent of CP&P and will 
advocate for your child in court. 

Parental Defense Attorney - You have the right to have 
a lawyer represent you in CP&P proceedings. Your lawyer 
should meet with you before every hearing or mediation 
to discuss your case, represent your interests in court and 
help you to understand your rights and obligations.

CP&P Caseworker and/or Supervisor - CP&P 
caseworkers or supervisors also must attend court to 
update the court on CP&P actions, your progress and the 
child’s well-being You should be able to meet with your 
caseworker at court to receive and provide updates.

Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) - A Court 
Appointed Special Advocate is a specially trained 
volunteer who could be appointed by the court. The CASA 
volunteer becomes familiar with your family’s case and 
finds solutions and services available to the family that 
are in the best interest of the child. The CASA volunteer 
provides a report with recommendations to the court. 
Anyone who is part of the case can request that a CASA 
volunteer be provided, but the judge must assign the 
CASA volunteer to the case.

NotesYou should begin looking for an attorney to represent you 
as soon as you are served with a summons to appear in 
family court OR as soon as you receive the Order to Show 
Cause and Verified Complaint.

NotesYou and Your 
Lawyer

Your relationship with your lawyer is very important. You 
should make every effort to make the relationship with 
your attorney work to your advantage.

Be honest with your lawyer. Keep your lawyer fully 
informed of your case and your progress. If there are things 
that you do not want CP&P to know you should inform 
your lawyer that you do not want that information shared.

Show all documents to your lawyer. Share any documents 
that are relevant to your case (evaluations, case plans, 
visitation schedule) with your lawyer.

Review court documents with your lawyer. Take time to 
discuss and review the order to show cause and complaint 
filed in your case as well as court orders with your lawyer.

Maintain contact with your lawyer. Make sure that your 
lawyer has your current contact information. Return phone 
calls from your lawyer as soon as possible.

Ask your lawyer to explain. If you have any questions 
about your case, ask your lawyer to explain.

Discuss your case with your lawyer. Talk to your lawyer 
about how you would like your case to be resolved.

Always talk with your lawyer before signing any 
documents about your case.

Your Child’s
Lawyer

The law guardian is your child’s attorney. The law 
guardian will tell the judge what your child wants and 
helps your child understand what happens in court. The 
law guardian supports your child’s wishes and protects 
his or her interests in the court proceedings and in dealing 
with the other parties to the case. 

he position of the law guardian will depend upon the 
facts of the case and the wishes, interests and needs of 
your child. The law guardian has an investigator who 
helps to prepare the case by gathering and reporting 
information. The investigator and/or law guardian will 
visit your child and interview school personnel, caregivers, 
health care professionals, and other people involved with 
your child and family. The law guardian can advocate for 
your child to receive needed services, including financial 
support for the child’s caretakers. 

he law guardian and the investigator are employees of 
the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender (OPD) and 
are independent of the Division of Child Protection and 
Permanency (CP&P). A law guardian is appointed by a 
family court judge at the beginning of each case. In most 
cases, the law guardian will remain your child’s lawyer 
until your child is returned to your care, or safely placed 
in a permanent, stable family situation or if there is a 
termination of parental rights proceeding on behalf of 
your child.

NotesDO ARRIVE ON TIME. If you are late or fail to attend, the 
judge could decide your case in your absence. 

O SHUT OFF ALL ELECTRONIC DEVICES. When entering 
the courtroom, remove all hats and turn off cell phones and 
pagers. 

O BRING RELEVANT DOCUMENTS WITH YOU. Bring 
your court notices with you. If you have any documents to 
present to the judge, you should give them to your lawyer. 

O USE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE. While addressing the 

court, you must use appropriate language. Address the 
judge as “Your Honor” and speak directly to the judge, not 
to the other party. 

O WAIT FOR A COPY OF THE COURT ORDER. After 
each party has presented his or her side, the judge will 
make a decision and issue an order. The order will contain 
important information about your case, including services 
that CP&P must provide and the tasks you must complete. 

O NOT EAT IN THE COURTROOM. Do not bring any food 

or beverages into the courtroom. 

O NOT BRING CHILDREN WITH YOU TO COURT unless 
you have been told to do so by the judge. Children who 
are in placement are entitled to attend all court hearings 
and are encouraged to attend their permanency hearings 
to share their interests and wishes with the court in person.

definition in the glossary.

What to Expect if Your Child is 
in an Out-of-Home Placement

Visitation Plan: Unless you are restricted from doing so by 
a court order, you are encouraged to visit with your child as 
often as possible on a regular schedule. Visiting regularly 
with your child has many benefits for you and your child, 
including improving the likelihood of reunification and 
continuing the important bond between parent and child. 

ase Plan: You should be involved in the development of 
your case plan with your caseworker to identify needs and 
issues that must be addressed to make sure your child can 
safely return home. 

ervices: Your caseworker will assist you to identify 
services that are needed to address safety issues preventing 
reunification. You can expect your caseworker to connect you 
with services, help you get to and from your appointments 
and help with funding services, if applicable. Services should 
address your specific needs and you are encouraged to 
communicate with your case worker regularly about your 
needs as well as the quality and helpfulness of any services 
you receive.

oncurrent Planning: In most cases, CP&P is required by law 
to provide the necessary support to safely reunify you with 
your child. CP&P is also required by law to make a permanent 
plan for your child within a specific timeframe, starting 
from the first day of placement, in case CP&P cannot safely 
return your child to you. In the first year your child is in out 
of home placement, CP&P prepares alternative permanent plans, also known as a permanency 
plan, for your child at the same time that CP&P works to reunify you with your child. This dual 
planning is called concurrent planning. CP&P could continue concurrent planning after the first 
year depending on your progress with case plan goals and services. If you do not take part 
in the services offered and do not maintain regular visits with your child, CP&P will consider 
a permanency plan other than reunification. The permanency plan could be placing the child 
permanently with relatives/family friends or proceeding with the steps to legally free the child 
for adoption. See ASFA on page 18 for more information on these timeframes and requirements. 

easonable Efforts: In most cases, New Jersey law requires CP&P to make “reasonable efforts” 
to help families stay together or be reunified. Unless your child’s safety is at immediate risk or 
unless a court determines reasonable efforts are unnecessary, prior to removal,  

  R

NotesWhat to Expect if Your Child is 
in an Out-of-Home Placement

Continued from page 13

CP&P must make reasonable efforts to prevent the placement 
of your child in out of home care. 

f your child is unable to remain in your care, CP&P must prove 
that reasonable efforts were made to prevent your child’s 
placement and must make reasonable efforts to address 
concerns to safely reunify you with your child or make another 
permanent arrangement for your child. “Reasonable efforts” 
are usually services and supports provided to the family. This 
includes the caseworker’s consistent efforts to encourage, 
assist and advocate for you and your family to access and use 
appropriate services. Reasonable efforts must be tailored to 
the specifics of your case. 

Reasonable efforts” by CP&P could include, but are not 
limited to:
• 

CP&P Identifying family problems, arranging and 
funding services to help your family stay together, 
assessing extended family and friends as supports to 
your family or as alternatives to placement, arranging 
visitation with parents and siblings, providing 
services to speed your child’s safe return home and 
providing services to achieve another permanent 
plan in a timely manner in the best interest of your 
child. 

  I

  “

“Reasonable efforts” services offered could include: 

• 

Family therapy, parenting classes, drug and alcohol 
abuse treatment/counseling, respite care, parent 
support groups, home visiting programs, child care, 
homemaker services, individual, group, and family 
counseling, health-care services, behavioral health 
evaluation and treatment, vocational counseling, 
transportation expenses, anger management 
treatment, housing services and referrals to social 
service agencies. 

Your lawyer can request services from CP&P for you and your 
children. You should talk to your lawyer about services that 
you need. 

CHILDREN IN COURT  |  PARENT’S HANDBOOK AND CALENDARNotesNEW JERSEY COURTS  |  15

Family Team 
Meetings

Whether your child is home with you or in out-of-home 
placement, you are strongly encouraged to request 
and participate in family team meetings (FTM). The 
purpose of the family team meeting is to increase your 
involvement and your family’s involvement in your case 
planning.  

TMs focus on your strengths and past successes to 
improve the likelihood of having successful outcomes for 
you and your family. Your voice and input is important in 
the development of your family’s case plan.  

ith FTMs, from the beginning of your case, you have the 

opportunity to build a support team, which can include 
interested family members, friends, resource parents, 
and others you and your family chose to invite, such as 
teachers and therapists.  

our support team can be involved in the decision-
making process and in developing a plan to best 
meet the needs of your family. The team can develop 
assigned tasks and timeframes to formulate goals and 
build solutions. The safety, protection and well-being of 
children must always be maintained.

CP&P attempts to hold a FTM before or within 45 days of 
a child’s out-of-home placement. Three additional FTMs 
are done within the first year of placement. For children 

  F

  W

  Y

who remain in placement after the first 12 months with a goal of reunification, at least 
three additional FTMs should occur within the year. For children with a goal of other than 
reunification who remain in placement after the first 12 months, at least two additional FTMs 
a year will be held. You can request a family team meeting at any time.

NotesChild Placement  
Review Board

Child Placement Review (CPR) boards are groups of 
county volunteers that review the cases of all children 
under CP&P supervision who are placed in out-of-home 
living arrangements. The CPR board conducts a detailed 
review of your child’s case once your child has been in 
care for 60 days, discusses the arrangements that CP&P 
makes for your child and then reports information and 
recommendations to the court. This is done in a meeting 
format that is less formal than a court hearing with a 
judge. You will be notified when the CPR board reviews 
your child’s case and you will have the chance to attend 
and speak at the review, with an opportunity to voice any 
concerns you might have about your child’s placement 
and needs. Relatives, foster parents, and others who are 
interested in the case have the right to attend the review 
and/or to submit written information to the CPR Board. All 
should be encouraged to participate. 

hild Welfare Mediation
Child welfare mediation is a meeting where a neutral 
person, a mediator, helps parents, caseworkers, attorneys 
and resource parents discuss issues and reach agreements 
concerning your child and your case. Anyone interested 
in the child’s well-being can attend, which could include 
relatives, CASA volunteers and the child, if appropriate. 
With few exceptions, whatever is said in mediation is

nyone involved in your case can request mediation at any point. A judge must approve the 

request. The judge also can order mediation if the judge feels mediation is best to resolve 
issues. The judge will sign an order that says everyone involved in the case must attend at 
least one session. Most sessions are one to three hours long. 

f the judge orders mediation in your case, you will receive a referral order from the judge 
giving you the date, time and place of your mediation session. If an agreement is reached, 
it will be presented to the judge for approval. If approved, the agreement will become an 
enforceable order of the court.

NotesAdoption and Safe
Families Act (ASFA)

New Jersey changed some of its laws and policies related 
to families with children in foster care to comply with the 
federal Adoption and Safe Families Act.* 

hese changes speed up how things work when children 
are placed into foster care. Generally, when children are 
first placed in foster care, CP&P is required to help the 
family get their children returned home. 

f a child remains in foster care for 12 months, CP&P must 
decide whether it thinks the child can return home. In most 
cases, if the family cannot be reunited after one year, CP&P 
must make plans for the child to be adopted or placed in 
another permanent home, such as with a relative. 

t the end of 12 months in foster care, the law requires 
that there be a court hearing (permanency hearing) to set 
a plan for the child’s future. If it is decided that the child 
should not go home and should be placed for adoption, 
CP&P will file a complaint to terminate parental rights. 

hen parents’ rights are terminated, parents and children 

lose their right to all contact with each other, including 
visits, letters and phone calls. Under current law, they can 
only stay in touch if the child’s adoptive parents allow it. 
The law says that CP&P must file its case within 15 months 
from when the child entered foster care. A judge then 
decides whether the parents’ rights should be terminated.

hese timeframes give you a limited amount of time to get your children back. It is very 
important for you to cooperate with court orders so that your children can be returned as 
quickly as possible. It is also very important for CP&P to act quickly to provide you and your 
family with the services you need after a child goes into foster care. If CP&P does not provide 
services right away or does not provide the services you think you need, you should contact 
your case worker to create a service plan that helps your family quickly. You also can ask your 
lawyer to request mediation with CP&P.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
