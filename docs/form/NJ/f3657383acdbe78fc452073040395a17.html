Success Program

JOBS

“Wayfair has been part of the JOBS 
program since its inception in 2019. We 
are participating in the JOBS program 
because we passionately believe in 
its mission of giving people a second 
chance. As a fast-growing company with 
a large presence in NJ, it also makes 
sense from a business perspective: we 
urgently need qualified employees, and 
the JOBS program provides us with a 
pool of applicants that we might not 
otherwise see. Our first set of JOBS hires 
are thriving, and we are grateful they are 
part of Wayfair.”
 
 

- Enrique Colbert 
  general counsel, Wayfair

“In addition to our responsibility as 
the statewide transit provider for New 
Jersey, we also understand our role as 
a partner in the communities we serve. 
Through the JOBS Program, NJ TRANSIT 
has the ability to literally change 
lives by providing a second chance 
to individuals who deserve one. The 
prospect of full-time employment with 
benefits and a good wage is a critical 
component to helping these clients 
become contributing members of their 
communities.”
 
 

- Kevin Corbett 
  president and CEO, NJ Transit

“Many probation clients face enormous 
barriers in their search for employment. I 
am proud of my employer, RWJ Hamilton, 
which is part of the RWJBH Health 
system, which recognizes the importance 
of the work the JOBS Committee has 
done in helping these individuals seek 
meaningful employment.”

  health promotion, Robert Wood  
  Johnson University Hospital,  
  Hamilton

A message from 
Chief Justice Rabner

“

One of the most significant ways to 
respond to the crisis of addiction and 
enable people to stay on the road to 
recovery is to help them find stable 
employment. They need our help to 
make that possible.”

For more information about this program, go to  
www.njcourts.gov and search for  
Judiciary Opportunities to Build Success Program. 

What is the Judiciary Opportunities 
for Building Success Program?
The New Jersey Judiciary’s Opportunities for 
Building Success Program (JOBS) connects 
private companies and non-profit organizations 
with successful recovery court and probation 
clients who want to rebuild their lives and want 
to work.One of the most significant barriers 
for recovery court and probation clients is to 
find stable employment, no matter what their 
education level or job experience.  

Because people on probation face added 
obstacles in their search for meaningful 
employment, the Judiciary welcomes the 
opportunity to work with the business 
community to secure stable employment for 
successful participants. 

The JOBS program presents an exceptional 
opportunity for us to strengthen the 
collaboration between government and the 
business community, while giving people a 
chance to reclaim their lives.

How does the program work?
The JOBS program is designed to connect 
probation clients to employment opportunities, 
job readiness programming and skill-building 
training opportunities.

The probation division oversees the day-to-
day operations of the program, serves as a 
continuing point of contact for employers, and 
works to determine which clients are deemed 
appropriate for the program.

When opportunities arise, probation staff will 
provide employers résumés to consider and will 
link clients and potential employers to begin 
the application process. Probation staff will be 
available to consult with employers during and 
after the selection process.

A number of employers participate in the 
program. These include Wakefern, Goya Foods, 
Inc., Atlanticare, and Stockton University, as 
well as Unite Here Local 54, which represents 

employees of the Hard Rock Café in Atlantic City. 

In addition, more than 200 other companies 
throughout the state have been identified as 
willing employers for this program.

The New Jersey Department of Workforce 
Development has partnered with the JOBS 
program and provides an array of services for 
probation clients, including job readiness training 
and access to transportation, necessary work 
equipment, and clothing. 

Who is eligible for the program?
To qualify for the employment program, 
participants must be under active probation 
supervision in recovery court, Intensive 
Supervision Program, or general community 
supervision. They must cooperate with probation 
supervision, and recovery court clients are 
routinely scheduled to see the recovery court 

judge. Recovery court clients as well as some 
non-recovery court clients are tested regularly 
to ensure they abstain from drugs and alcohol.

How are clients monitored?
The Judiciary will work closely with companies 
and non-profit organizations to ensure that 
clients are reporting to work. 

The Judiciary will monitor and track referrals 
and placements. This also will include a review 
of the effectiveness of the program, including 
using statistics to measure results. 

How can I participate?

search for Judiciary Opportunities for Building 
Success Program or email

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
