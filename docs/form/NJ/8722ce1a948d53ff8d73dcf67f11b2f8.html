How to File a Motion Before a Judge to Classify a Record as 
Confidential or Delete Documents from the eCourts Case Jackets 
(Superior Court of New Jersey) 

Who Should Use This Packet? 

Use this packet if you want to classify a document as confidential or delete documents from the 
eCourts case jacket.  You must file a WRITTEN request with the Judge in the county where 
your case is being heard. 

With limited exceptions, any paper filed with the court can be looked at by the public.  You can 
only file a motion on behalf of yourself.  You cannot file a motion for anyone else.  A Power of 
Attorney does not allow you to file on behalf of anyone else.  Motions filed on behalf of anyone 
else will be returned. 

Note: These materials have been prepared by the New Jersey Administrative Office of the 
Courts for use by self-represented litigants.  The instructions and forms will be periodically 
updated as necessary to reflect current New Jersey statutes and court rules.  The most recent 
version of the forms will be available on the Judiciary’s Internet site njcourts.gov.  However, 
you are ultimately responsible for the content of your court papers. 

Completed forms should be submitted electronically via mail, eCourts or the Judiciary 
Electronic Document Submission (JEDS) system. Learn more at njcourts.gov

Things to Think About Before You Represent Yourself in Court 

Try to Get a Lawyer 
CAUTION: Some court cases are very complex, and you should consider getting a lawyer.  
The court system can be confusing, and it is a good idea to get a lawyer if you can.  The law, the 
proofs necessary to present your case, and the procedural rules governing cases are complex.  
Most likely your adversary will be represented by a lawyer.  It is recommended that you make 
every effort to obtain the assistance of a lawyer.  If you cannot afford a lawyer, you can contact 
the legal services program in your county to see if you qualify for free legal services.  Their 
telephone number can be found online under “Legal Aid” or “Legal Services.” 

If you do not qualify for free legal services and need help in locating an attorney, you can 
contact the bar association in your county.  Most county bar associations have a Lawyer 
Referral Service.  The County Bar Lawyer Referral Service can supply you with the names of 
attorneys in your area willing to handle your particular type of case and will sometimes consult 
with you at a reduced fee. 

There are also a variety of organizations of minority lawyers throughout New Jersey, as well as 
organizations of lawyers who handle specialized types of cases.  Ask your county court staff for 
a list of lawyer referral services that include these organizations. 

If you decide to proceed without an attorney, these materials explain the procedures that must 
be followed to have your papers properly filed and considered by the court.  Failure to follow 
procedures can result in a delay with processing your documents. 

These materials do not provide information on the law governing your claims or defenses; 
information on how to conduct pretrial discovery; information on alternative dispute resolution 
procedures, such as mediation, that might be available or required in your case; information on 
the kinds of evidence you need to prove your claims or defenses at trial; or information on other 
procedural and evidentiary rules governing court cases. 

What You Should Expect If You Represent Yourself 
While you have the right to represent yourself in court, you should not expect special treatment, 
help, or attention from the court.  The following is a list of some things the court staff can and 
cannot do for you.  Please read it carefully before asking the court staff for help. 

•  We can explain and answer questions about how the court works. 
•  We can tell you what the requirements are to have your case considered by the court. 
•  We can give you some information from your case file. 

•  We can provide you with samples of court forms that are available. 
•  We can provide you with guidance on how to fill out forms. 

•  We can usually answer questions about court deadlines.

How to File a Motion to Classify a Record as Confidential or Delete Documents from eCourts 
•  We cannot give you legal advice.  Only your lawyer can give you legal advice. 

•  We cannot tell you whether or not you should bring your case to court. 
•  We cannot give you an opinion about what will happen if you bring your case to court. 
•  We cannot recommend a lawyer, but we can provide you with the telephone number of a 

local lawyer referral service. 

•  We cannot talk to the judge for you about what will happen in your case. 
•  We cannot let you talk to the judge outside of court. 

•  We cannot change an order issued by a judge. 

Keep Copies of All Papers 
Make and keep copies of all completed forms and documents related to your case.

Definitions of Words Used in This Packet 

Adversary - Your adversary in a lawsuit is the person or persons whose position is opposite 
to you.  In a case where there is only a plaintiff and a defendant and you are the plaintiff, your 
adversary is the defendant.  Likewise, if you are the defendant, your adversary is the plaintiff.  
In this packet, service on your adversary means service on the attorney(s) representing your 
adversary or adversaries and/or on any party(ies) not represented by counsel. 

Answer - An answer is a defendant’s written response to a plaintiff’s initial court filing. 

Brief - A brief is a written argument submitted to the court where you present the facts and 
the history of your case and the legal argument supporting the request you have made to the 
court in your motion. 

Caption - A caption is the name of the case; it lists the name of both the plaintiff(s) and the 
defendant(s).  For example: ABC Mortgage Company, Plaintiff v. Mary Smith, Defendant. 

Certification - A certification is statement that certain facts are true to the best of the 
knowledge of the person making the statement.  It is like an affidavit but is not sworn before a 
notary or other authorized person. 

Defendant - The defendant is the person against whom the complaint or legal action is filed. 

Discovery Motion - A discovery motion asks the court for a ruling on some point of the 
discovery process such as a motion for more specific answers to interrogatories or a motion to 
require depositions.  Before filing a discovery motion, the person who is bringing the motion 
must try to resolve the matter with the other party(ies) in the case. 

Docket Number - A docket number is the number the court assigns to a case so that it may be 
identified and located easily.  You must include the docket number on all your 
communications regarding your case.  Note: Documents without a docket number cannot 
be filed. 

File - To file means to give the court the appropriate documents, forms and fees. 

Motion - A motion is an application to the court for a specific order or ruling to be made in 
favor of the person making the motion (the movant). 

Motion Day - Courts hear motions on specified days (usually Fridays) on the court calendar 
called motion days.  You should obtain the motion schedule online from the judiciary website 
at: njcourts.gov.  It is your responsibility to contact the courthouse in the county where the 
case is filed to inquire about the motion day and to confirm if a case is scheduled for a 
hearing.

Definitions of Words Used in This Packet (continued) 

Movant or moving party - The movant or moving party is the person who is bringing the 
motion. 

Notice of Motion - A Notice of Motion is the form used to inform the court and all opposing 
parties that the person filing the motion is seeking a specific ruling or order from the court.  A 
Notice of Motion must identify the courthouse where the motion will be heard (the 
courthouse in the county where the case is filed). 

Oral Argument - Oral argument refers to the appearance in court by the parties to present 
their positions to the judge in person.  Either side may request oral argument, but the decision 
on whether there will be oral argument is up to the judge.  If oral argument is not requested by 
either of the parties or the judge, the motion will be decided “on the papers.” 

Plaintiff - The plaintiff is the person who files a complaint or brings a legal action. 

Pro se - Pro se is a Latin term that means “on one’s own behalf.”  A plaintiff or defendant in 
a court case who does not have an attorney is said to be appearing pro se. 

Proof of Mailing - Proof of mailing is the form in which you provide the dates and method 
you used to give the other parties copies of the papers that you filed in court. 

Proposed Form of Order - A proposed order is a form that the judge can use to either grant 
or deny the relief sought in the motion.  Every motion must be accompanied by a proposed 
form of order. 

Redaction - the censoring or “blacking out” of part of a text for legal or security purposes is 
called redaction.  Note: Any documents received by the Clerk’s office will be processed and 
placed in the case jacket which, with limited exceptions, is available for public view. 

Relief - Relief is the assistance or remedy sought by a complainant from a judge. 

Return date - The return date is the date on which the court will consider the motion.  If you 
request oral argument, you must appear before the judge.  If no oral argument is requested, 
the matter will be decided “on the papers.”  That is, the judge will decide the motion on what 
has been submitted in the moving papers and in the opposition papers, without having anyone 
appear in court. 

Service - Service refers to the delivery of the complaint or any other paper in a case to the 
other parties in the case.  Formal legal service requires that the service be made by an 
officially authorized person or by mail. 

Venue - the venue is the location where a case is heard.

How to File a Motion to Classify a Record as Confidential or Delete Documents from eCourts 
The numbered steps listed below tell you what forms you will need to fill out and what to do with them.  Each 
form should be typed or printed clearly on 8.5” x 11” white paper only.  Forms may not be filed on a different 
size or color paper. 

Steps to Classify a Record as Confidential or Delete Documents from eCourts 

STEP 1: Complete the Notice of Motion (Form A) 
In the Notice of Motion, you inform the court and all parties that you have asked for a specific 
ruling or order and specify the ruling you want - to classify the record as confidential or delete 
documents from the eCourts case jacket. 

Motions are heard in court on specified days.  You should obtain the motion schedule either 
from the clerk’s office or online from the judiciary website at njcourts.gov.  You should pick a 
motion day at least 3 weeks from the date you mail your motion papers, in order to give your 
adversary 16 days before the return date as required by the court rules. 

If the Motion is currently pending, contact the judge’s chambers to ask when your motion will 
be heard and how you should inform the other parties in the case that you are making the 
motion on short notice. 

STEP 2: Complete the Certification in Support of the Motion and the Certification of 
Service (Form B) 
The Certification in Support of the Motion tells the court the reasons why the court should grant 
your request.  You must also complete the Certification of Service that tells the court the date 
you mailed (or delivered) copies of the documents to the other parties in the case. 

STEP 3: Fill out the top portion of the Proposed Form of Order 
Fill out the top portion of the Order.  Do not fill out anything that appears under the text “For 
Court Use Only.”  The judge will complete the bottom half of the Order when the motion is 
decided. 

STEP 4: Mail or Deliver the Notice of Motion, Certification in Support Motion and 
Proposed Form of Order 
You must serve the other parties to the case no later than 16 days before the specified return 
date on your notice of motion.  While the court rules do not require you to use certified mail, it 
is suggested that you send your motion and supporting papers by regular and certified mail, 
return receipt requested.  You will then have the green card when it is returned to you as proof 
of service. 

STEP 5: Mail, Deliver or electronically submit the forms to the court 
You can file your documents electronically through JEDS, by mail or in person with the 
court.  To electronically submit your documentation in to new or existing cases to the court, use 
the Judiciary Electronic Document Submission (JEDS) system.  For more information about the 
JEDS system (including FAQs) and how to register to use the system go to njcourts.gov.  Note: 
Attorneys must file through eCourts.

How to File a Motion to Classify a Record as Confidential or Delete Documents from eCourts 
If you mail the papers, we recommend that you use certified mail, return receipt requested.  
Forms may be submitted via postal mail or in-person to the applicable division in the county 
where your case is filed.  Those addresses are available at njcourts.gov. 

Keep copies of all papers you provide to the court or any other party.  Make and keep for 
yourself copies of all completed forms and any canceled checks, money orders, receipts, 
bills, contract estimates, letters, leases, photographs, and other important papers that 
relate to your case. 

Step 6: Appear in Court 
The Court will notify you when the matter will be heard by the judge.  You will also be told 
whether to appear in person or virtually.  Since the applications are time sensitive, most 
appearances are conducted virtually. 

The Judiciary will provide reasonable accommodations to enable individuals with disabilities to 
access and participate in court events.  Please contact the local ADA coordinator to request an 
accommodation.  Contact information is available at njcourts.gov. 

The New Jersey Judiciary provides court-interpreting services.  If you need an interpreter, 
notify the court as soon as possible: njcourts.gov.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
