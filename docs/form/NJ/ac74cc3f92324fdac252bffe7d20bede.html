Complex Business Litigation Program (CBLP) 
Case Management Guidelines 

Overview 

The Complex Business Litigation Program (“CBLP” or “the Program”) is focused on business, commercial and 
construction cases with significant amounts in dispute or business or commercial cases involving complex 
factual or legal issues; a large number of separately represented parties; potential numerous pre-trial motions 
raising difficult or novel legal issues; case management of a large number of lay and expert witnesses or a 
substantial amount of documentary evidence (including electronically stored information); substantial time 
required to complete the trial; significant interpretation of a business, commercial or construction statute; or 
involves other contentions of a complex business, commercial or construction nature. 

Eligibility 
A case is assigned to the vicinage CBLP judge in the following situations: 

Threshold Damages 
The CBLP involves disputes with and between business entities where the claims, counterclaims, or third-
party claims allege business, commercial or construction claims and an amount in controversy of at least 
$200,000.00, unless the court determines a lesser amount is acceptable. 

Self Designation 
Attorneys or parties completing the Civil Case Information Statement will self-designate actions as 
Complex Commercial (Case Type 508) or Complex Construction (Case Type 513).  These case types will 
presumptively be assigned to the vicinage’s CBLP judge for case management. 

Complex Commercial (508) actions involve claims by, against, and among parties that arise out of business 
or commercial transactions and involve parties’ exposure to potentially significant damage awards; or where 
the business or commercial claim involves complex factual or legal issues; a large number of separately 
represented parties; potential numerous pre-trial motions raising difficult or novel legal issues; case 
management of a large number of lay and expert witnesses or a substantial amount of documentary evidence 
(including electronically stored information); substantial time required to complete the trial; significant 
interpretation of a business or commercial statute; or involves other contentions of a complex business - 
commercial nature. 

Complex Construction (513) actions involve claims by, against, and among owners, contractors, 
subcontractors, fabricators and installers, architects, engineers, design and construction consultants, and 
other similar parties associated with a construction project that involves parties’ exposure to potentially 
significant damage awards because of claimed design and construction defects, delay claims, or where the 
construction claim involves complex factual or legal issues; a large number of separately represented 
parties; potential numerous pre-trial motions raising difficult or novel legal issues; case management of a 
large number of lay and expert witnesses or a substantial amount of documentary evidence (including 
electronically stored information); substantial time required to complete the trial.  Complex construction 
does not include construction and professional payment and billing claims, change order claims, wrongful 
termination, quantum merit, construction lien or mechanics lien claims, unless associated with a complex 
construction claim as herein described. 

Actions to establish a constructive trust or impose an equitable lien to satisfy damages are also cognizable in 
the CBLP, as are cases primarily seeking legal relief in which ancillary injunctive relief is sought.  The 
CBLP encompasses both jury and non-jury matters.

CBLP Case Management Guidelines 

CBLP judges handle cases arising from the following non-exclusive list of circumstances: 

•  non-consumer Uniform Commercial Code transactions; 

• 

the purchase and sale of assets of businesses or assets of a business, including contract disputes and 
commercial landlord/tenant claims; 

•  non-consumer sales of goods or services by or to a business; 

•  non-consumer bank or brokerage accounts including loan, deposit, cash management, and 

investment accounts; 

•  purchase, sale, or lease of commercial personal property, or security interests therein; 

•  arising out of state securities laws; 

• 

intellectual property disputes; 

•  business licensing agreement disputes; 

•  unfair competition disputes; 

•  sale, purchase of a business or purchase or sale of stock, assets or liabilities of a business; 

•  mergers and acquisitions disputes; 

• 

franchisee/franchisor relationship and liabilities; 

•  business torts, including interference with prospective economic advantage, interference with 

contractual relations, tortious interference with business relationships, breach of implied covenant of 
good faith and fair dealing, fraud, fraud in the inducement, misrepresentation, and breach of 
fiduciary duty; 

• 

liability or indemnity of managers (officers, directors, managers, trustees or members or partners 
functioning as managers) of corporations, partnerships, limited partnerships, limited liability 
companies or partnerships, professional associations, business trusts, joint ventures or other business 
enterprises; 

•  Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) claims; 

•  complex commercial construction disputes; 

•  other complex disputes of a business or commercial nature. 

The CBLP retains the law and equity separation that was recognized in the 1947 Constitution.  It does not 
encroach on the cases traditionally heard in General Equity.  The CBLP does not include matters involving: 

• 

internal affairs or governance disputes over management and/or control of business entities; 

•  dissolution or liquidation rights or obligation between or among owners (shareholders, partner, 

members); 

•  statutory and custodial receivership or actions seeking the appointment of special fiscal agents; 

• 

restructuring of a business entity; 

•  shareholder derivative suits; 

restrictive covenant agreements. 

•  actions to protect the interests of a business, such as non-compete agreements, trade secrets or

CBLP Case Management Guidelines 

Also excluded from CBLP are actions primarily involving consumers, labor organizations, personal, 
physical or mental injury; mechanics’ lien actions, and condemnation proceedings.  Following is a non-
inclusive list of actions that generally are not handled by CBLP judges and are handled by judges regularly 
assigned to the Law Division, Civil Part: 

•  actions by consumers against a business and businesses against consumers; 

•  class action consumer claims; 

•  products liability actions; 

•  personal injury and wrongful death actions; 

•  commercial landlord verses consumer tenant actions; 

•  noncommercial real estate matters actions; 

•  enforcement of arbitration awards; 

•  condemnation actions; 

• 

landlord‐tenant matters involving summary dispossession; 

•  employment Law Against Discrimination actions; 

•  civil rights actions; 

•  professional malpractice actions; 

•  medical device litigation and pharmaceutical litigation; 

•  Multicounty Litigation (mass tort); 

•  environmental litigation including environmental insurance coverage actions; 

•  Conscientious Employee Protection Act actions; 

•  agreements relating to an individual or collective contract of employment; 

•  wrongful discharge actions; 

•  slander of title or product disparagement actions; 

• 

fraudulent transfers under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act; 

•  consumer residential construction actions. 

Opt-In Motion 
Parties may formally move before the CBLP judge for inclusion in the Program where a case is not 
presumptively assigned to the CBLP but involves complex business related issues and/or the amount in 
controversy is less than $200,000.  Business or commercial disputes that involve complex factual or legal 
issues; a large number of parties; discovery issues such as managing large numbers of documents, multiple 
experts; is likely to have implications for business beyond the decision in the particular case; is likely to 
result in a significant interpretation of a business or commercial statute; or involves other contentions that 
the CBLP judge finds compelling may be assigned to the Complex Business Litigation Program.  Such 
motions shall be granted for good cause shown. 

Complex Business Litigation Assignment Recommendation 
If, upon review, the Assignment Judge or the CBLP judge determines a case is appropriate for the CBLP, 
the judge may, sua sponte, assign it to the CBLP.

CBLP Case Management Guidelines 

Exclusion from CBLP 
Initial Case Review 
The CBLP judge will review actions presumptively assigned to the CBLP to determine if the case is 
appropriate for the CBLP.  If, after review, the CBLP judge determines that the complex nature of the action 
or the threshold damages claim amount is not established, the CBLP judge shall remove the case from the 
Program.  The Assignment Judge may also conduct initial CBLP eligibility reviews.  Cases removed from 
the CBLP by the Assignment Judge or the CBLP judge will be reassigned to the appropriate track for case 
management. 

Motion for Removal from the Program 
Any party may move for removal from the CBLP on the grounds that the action does not meet the eligibility 
criteria. 

Guidelines 

Assignment of Judges 
CBLP cases are assigned to a single judge that handles all aspects of the case, including discovery disputes, 
summary judgment and other motions, and trial. 

Court Rules 
Cases assigned to the CBLP are governed by Part IV, Chapter XI (“Complex Commercial & Complex 
Construction Matters”) of the New Jersey Rules of Court.  Absent an express contradictory rule contained in 
Chapter XI, Parts I and IV of the Court Rules shall otherwise apply to any case in the CBLP. 

Pre-Case Management Conference Activity 
Initial conference preparation is required pursuant to Rules 4:103-1 and 4:103-2, comparable to Federal Rule of 
Civil Procedure 26, to require attorneys to both meet with their clients as well as each other before a meeting 
with a judge. 

The initial meetings between counsel and their clients will provide an understanding of the potential data and 
information at issue and the time required to accomplish full discovery.  In conferring with counsel, attorneys 
should prepare a Joint Discovery Plan for all discovery as well as an Electronic Discovery Plan, both of which 
are to be provided to the Court in advance of the Initial Conference.  Counsel should also advise the Court of 
any unresolved discovery issues. 

Electronic discovery (eDiscovery): the attorneys should meet and confer to discuss form, scope 
preservation/destruction, and expense of production; method for asserting or preserving claims of privilege or of 
protection; confidentiality; and any other electronic discovery issues.  The Electronic Discovery Plan should set 
forth the parties’ agreements as to all eDiscovery. 

Initial Conferences 
The case will be scheduled for an Initial Conference with the CLBP Judge1.  At that Conference, counsel will 
meet with the Judge/other court representative to discuss assignment and scheduling of the case.  If it is 
determined that it should not be in the CBLP, the case may be removed at that time.  If the case remains in the 
CBLP, a comprehensive Scheduling Order, setting forth all discovery deadlines, will be entered at that time. 

                                                 
1  Should the need arise, the utilization of other judicial staff such as law clerks and/or a designated statewide case manager should be 
considered for overseeing/conducting certain conferences for CBLP cases.

CBLP Case Management Guidelines 

Model Stipulations/Orders 
The CBLP Internet website has the following model case management, discovery and protective orders: 

Joint Proposed Discovery Plan; 

Discovery Confidentiality Order (Appendix XXX to the Rules of Court); 

Clawback Stipulation and Order; 

Electronic Discovery Stipulation and Order; and 

Scheduling Order. 

Contacting Chambers 
At the time of the Initial Conference, the CBLP Judge should advise the parties the appropriate method(s) 
(phone, letter, email) and bases for contacting chambers.  The CBLP Judge should also advise whether joint 
submissions will be required. 

Case Management/Status Conferences 
As needed/requested by the parties (within reason).  There, the parties will report their discovery progress and 
address any issues.  Prior to such a conference a joint letter should be sent to the Court advising of the status of 
the case and the issues to be discussed at the Conference. 

Discovery and Motions 
The Supreme Court has approved Court Rules to govern cases in the Program.  Some aspects of discovery and 
motions in CBLP cases will be handled differently than other civil matters. 

Discovery 
See Rules 4:104-1 through 4:104-9, which provide the timing, limits and confidentiality of discovery in 
CBLP matters.  The Rules also address discovery disputes (R. 4:105-4).  The parties should first “meet and 
confer” to try to resolve the issues.  If an agreement cannot be reached, counsel should submit a letter to the 
court explaining the basis for the motion and requesting a telephone or in-court conference before the 
motion is made.  The Rule provides a process to resolve the dispute if not resolved by the court conference. 

Motions  
See Rules 4:105-1 through 4:105-9.  These Rules seek to streamline and facilitate the motion practice while 
also addressing the complexity and need for ease and flexibility of litigants to seek and to obtain extensions.  
Discovery disputes should be handled as noted above and the Dispositive Motion schedule should be set 
forth in Joint Proposed Discovery Plan. 

Settlement and CDR 
Any settlement conferences will be held at the CBLP judge’s discretion.  The CBLP judge will also advise 
whether a settlement conference memorandum is necessary as well as any content and formatting requirements. 

CBLP cases are not part of the court’s mandatory civil mediation and arbitration programs.  However, the 
CBLP judge in each vicinage, as part of case management, should encourage the parties to engage in mediation 
or some type of dispute resolution to facilitate settlement. 

Pre-trial and Trial 
All CBLP actions shall be pretried and the requirements of Rule 4:25 shall apply to the final pretrial conference, 
which should lead to the formulation of a trial plan, including a plan to facilitate the admission of evidence.  
With regard to trial exhibits, parties should prepare and submit Joint Exhibits to eliminate redundancy (it does 
not mean the parties are stipulating to its admissibility).
