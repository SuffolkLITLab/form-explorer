      <pre>New Jersey Judiciary 
Domestic Violence Economic Mediation Program 
FAQ’s for Protected Party 

 

Q:  What is “economic mediation”? 
A:  Economic mediation is a means of resolving differences related to financial issues with the help of a 
trained, impartial third party.  A mediator does not represent either side and does not offer legal 
advice.  Parties are encouraged to retain an attorney to advise them of their rights during the 
mediation process, but if they do not have an attorney, they are allowed to have someone else 
accompany them to the mediation.  The mediator helps the parties identify the issues, gather the 
information they need to make informed decisions, and communicate so that they can find a solution 
agreeable to both.  Mediation is designed to facilitate settlements in an informal, non-adversarial 
manner.  The court maintains a roster of approved mediators that have mediation training as well as 
specialized domestic violence training. 

Q:  Because I have a Final Restraining Order against the other party, is there a special process for 

me to request that the financial issues be referred to economic mediation? 

A:  Yes.  Before the court can refer the financial issues to economic mediation, several steps must be 
taken.  First, you need to read this document in its entirety.  You will then meet with a member of 
the local domestic violence organization or a trained court staff member who will speak to you about 
economic mediation.  If you have any questions about economic mediation or anything related to the 
process, you can ask them; however, they cannot give you any legal advice. 

If after reading this document and speaking to a member of the local domestic violence organization 
or a trained court staff member you would still like to have your case considered for economic 
mediation, you will be asked to read and fill out a document entitled “Certification of Plaintiff in 
Support of Request for Amendment of Final Restraining Order to Allow Economic Mediation.”  
This document is your formal request to the judge in your case asking that your case be referred to 
economic mediation.  It is also the document indicating that you understand what it means to have 
your Final Restraining Order amended to allow economic mediation to take place. 

Q:  Why do I need to file a request with the court to request economic mediation? 
A:  The law prohibits mediation because you have an active Final Restraining Order against the other 

party.  However, the Judiciary has established Domestic Violence Economic Mediation Program to 
permit referral of financial issues in a dissolution case to economic mediation where a final 
restraining order exists between the parties. 

However, under the terms of the Domestic Violence Economic Mediation Program the court can 
refer the unresolved financial issues to economic mediation only if you, as the Plaintiff in the Final 
Restraining Order, request it directly from the court. 

Q:  If I file a request for economic mediation and to amend my Final Restraining Order to allow 

economic mediation, what can I expect to happen in court? 

A:  Your request that the court refer the financial issues in your dissolution matter to economic 

mediation and that your Final Restraining Order be amended to allow mediation does not guarantee 
that the court will refer your case to economic mediation.

Domestic Violence Economic Mediation Pilot Program - FAQ’s for Protected Party 

After reviewing your request and making sure you understand what economic mediation is, the court 
will give the other party the opportunity to give their position on whether they would like to proceed 
to economic mediation.  If the other party agrees to proceed with economic mediation, the court will 
enter an order amending your Final Restraining Order to allow economic mediation under the terms 
of the Domestic Violence Economic Mediation Program. 

If the other party objects to economic mediation, they will be asked to state their objection.  The 
court will then decide whether the case is referred to economic mediation.  The court can still refer 
the case to economic mediation even over the other party's objection. 

If the court refers your case to economic mediation, you and the other party will be asked to agree 
upon a mediator.  If you are unable to agree on a mediator, the court will assign one to your case.  
The court will then enter an order referring the case to economic mediation. 

Q:  What happens if the case is not referred to economic mediation? 
A:  If the case is not referred by the court to economic mediation, the case will proceed as it would 
normally, with the court setting a date for the next event, which may be either an intensive 
settlement conference or a trial.  At the trial, both parties will have to present their testimony, 
witnesses and evidence so that the court can make decisions regarding the economic and other 
possible unresolved issues that are part of the dissolution matter. 

Q:  What does it mean to amend the Final Restraining Order to allow economic mediation? 
A:  If the court grants your request to allow economic mediation, the Final Restraining Order will be 
amended to allow economic mediation.  All other provisions of the Final Restraining Order will 
remain in place.  Any contact with you with the other party remains a violation of the Final 
Restraining Order. 

Q:  What if, after reading this document and speaking to someone about economic mediation, I 

decide I do not want my case referred to economic mediation? 

A:  Under the Domestic Violence Economic Mediation Program, the court can only refer the financial 
issues in the dissolution matter to economic mediation if you, as the protected party in the Final 
Restraining Order, file a request to participate in mediation.  If you decide that you do not want your 
case referred to economic mediation, then you should not fill out the request.  If you choose not to 
fill out the request, then your case will proceed to the next event to be scheduled. 

Under the terms of this Domestic Violence Economic Mediation Program, the other party, the non-
protected party in the Final Restraining Order, cannot request that the case proceed to economic 
mediation.  You, as the protected party in the Final Restraining Order are the only party who can 
request that the court refer the financial issues to economic mediation. 

If you choose not to request that the court refer the unresolved financial issues to economic 
mediation, please be aware that this will not be held against you in any way. 

Q:  If the financial issues are referred to economic mediation what safeguards are in place to 

protect me from the non-protected party during the mediation itself? 

A:  Some of the safeguards available are as follows: Economic mediation will only take place at the 
courthouse where trained sheriff’s officers are available.  Economic mediation is prohibited from 
taking place at the mediator’s office or at any other location.

Domestic Violence Economic Mediation Pilot Program - FAQ’s for Protected Party 

The mediator assigned to your case will use "shuttle" diplomacy to facilitate the mediation.  This 
means that you will be in one room and the other party will be in another room.  This prevents any 
direct communication from occurring.  Additionally, if the county courthouse you are in has the 
technology available, mediation can take place with the assistance of video conferencing. 

Under this program, only those mediators who have completed specific domestic violence training 
will be eligible to be chosen as a mediator for your case. 

Q:  What if during the economic mediation I feel like the other party is intimidating me or 

attempting to coerce me? 

A.  If you have an attorney, you should tell them, and you should also let the economic mediator know 
that this is how you feel.  If you choose not to continue with the economic mediation, you can 
choose to terminate the mediation.  The mediator will be required to let the judge know that the 
mediation was unsuccessful. This will not be held against you in any way. 

Q:  What if the court enters an order referring my case to economic mediation, but I change my 

mind and don't want to attend? 

A:  The judiciary understands that victims of domestic violence may not feel comfortable about 

proceeding with economic mediation, even though a number of safeguards are in place for your 
protection.  If at any point you decide that you do not want to go forward with the economic 
mediation, you may choose to end it.  It is suggested that before canceling the economic mediation 
that you speak to your attorney if you have one.  If there are concerns about your safety, please let 
your attorney and the economic mediator know at the time they arise. 

Q:  Is anyone responsible for paying the economic mediator? 
A:  The first two hours of mediation are free.  These two hours include the time it takes for a mediator to 
prepare for the actual mediation as well as a mediation session.  Travel time is not included in the 
first two hours and mediators are not allowed to charge for their travel. 

During the mediation, the mediator will let you know when the two free hours have been reached.  
Either party can then choose to end the mediation. 

If the mediation goes beyond the free two hours, the court will decide how much each party will 
have in paying the mediator. 

Q:  Can the mediator also address other issues like custody and parenting time? 
A:  No, by law and the terms of this Domestic Violence Economic Mediation Program, the only issues 

that may be discussed at mediation are financial issues.
