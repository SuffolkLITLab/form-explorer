For more information about probation services, 
go to www.njcourts.gov and search  
for probation services. 

masks, ear protectors, and reflective vests for 
jobs in which such equipment reduces risk or 
injury. Anything provided to paid staff also must 
be provided to community service workers. Tools 
or equipment provided to community service 
workers should be inspected and maintained 
regularly or repaired if needed. Equipment should 
be inspected before it is used.  

NJURIES
In the case of minor injuries such as poison ivy, 
insect bites, cuts and scrapes, workers should 
be told to seek treatment through their medical 
provider and be allowed to leave the worksite 
as needed. Emergencies such as respiratory 
distress, blunt trauma or broken bones should be 
responded to in the same manner as for a paid 
employee, including calling 911. All injuries must 
be reported immediately to the probation staff. 
You must file an accident/injury report. 

NSURANCE
There are two principle issues with which you 
should be familiar.
•  Accident Insurance: The state of New Jersey 
provides secondary accident insurance 
for the workers assigned to your agency. 
This insurance covers any injury which a 
community service worker might suffer 
while working with you. The specifics of the 
coverage and procedures to follow in case of 
an injury are available from the  
probation staff.  

•  Liability Insurance: New Jersey law 

provides specific protection against 
liability for governmental agencies 
involved with community service and more 
limited protection for private, non-profit 
organizations. Ask your attorney to review 
the provisions of the appropriate laws  
with you.

Community service workers have the right 
to a worksite that is free of sexual abuse, 
harassment or discrimination. Any complaints 
or concerns of alleged conduct must be 
reported immediately by contacting  
609-815-3810, ext. 16333. Any other inquiries 
or concerns must be directed to the local 
probation staff.

  I

  I

If a community service worker appears to be 
under the influence of alcohol or drugs, he or 
she should be dismissed from the worksite and 
probation staff should be notified. 

Child labor laws apply to those under the age 
of 18. These laws prohibit working with power 
equipment and toxic or flammable substances.  
The laws also can restrict the specific hours when 
a juvenile can work.  
A copy of the child labor law is available from:
 
Probation Community Service or 
            Office of Wage and Hour Compliance 
 
 

NJ Department of Labor  
P.O. Box 389, Trenton, NJ 08625. 

UVENILES

  J

The concern for the safety of community service 
workers at your work site is important. We 
expect that you will exercise care and caution 
in assigning and supervising jobs given to 
community service workers, just as you would 
with paid employees. If you have questions about 
the suitability or safety of work assignments, 
please discuss them with the probation staff 
before proceeding. The guidelines below offer 
examples of jobs that are not suitable. Exceptions 
must have prior approval by probation staff.

•  Operate motorized vehicles.
•  Operate power tools. NOTE: If a worker is 

experienced and capable with the equipment 
and you want to proceed, you should 
contact the probation staff and discuss the 
assignment before allowing the worker to use 
the equipment.

•  Use hazardous or toxic substances.  

ommunity service workers cannot:

•  Work on roofs or on ladders taller than  

six feet.

 C

The information above are examples including, 
but not limiting, other potentially hazardous 
duties. Use your judgment when deciding about 
work assignments. For example, a worker could 
decline a request to climb a ladder or use power 
equipment, but might agree to pick up litter on 
a trash patrol. If you have questions, contact 
the probation staff. You must provide safety 
equipment, such as goggles, hard hats, breathing

ABOUT  THE COMMUNITY SERVICE 
WORKSITE SAFETY PROGRAM
The Probation Community Service Program 
can provide you with workers referred from 
probation to do a variety of jobs for your 
agency. In return, there are a number of 
responsibilities you take on as a community 
service work site. The purpose of this brochure 
is to provide you with basic information and 
guidelines to assist you and your staff. 

CREENING

  S

The probation staff will refer workers to 
your agency based on its needs. Workers’ 
skills, schedule, offense, and background are 
considered in making referrals. When a worker is 
sent to your agency, you have the right to decide 
whether that person is suitable. In addition to 
probation’s prior screening, we recommend you 
interview the worker to determine if he or she 
meets your agency’s requirements. If you decide 
not to accept a referral, the probation staff will 
reassign that person and try to refer a more 
suitable worker to you. 

ECORDKEEPING

Since community service workers perform their 
duties as the result of a court order, it is essential 
that probation receives accurate records of the 
hours they work. We recommend that you have
workers sign in and out whenever they are at
your worksite. That way, the probation staff
person assigned to supervise can report who
worked and how many hours they completed.
The records of hours performed by individual
workers must be sent to probation staff at the
end of each month. 

UPERVISION

The community service worker has a 
responsibility to treat their assignments seriously 
and cooperate with you and your staff. If a 
worker is uncooperative or disruptive, promptly 
advise probation program staff. 

ou have the right to dismiss a worker from 

your site at any time.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
