How to Object to a Bank Account Levy 

Superior Court of New Jersey - Special Civil Part 

Who Should Use This Packet? 

You can use this packet if you received a Notice to Debtor and/or want to object to a bank account levy 
in the Special Civil Part.  You may object to the bank levy based on the fact that the funds that are 
frozen are exempt because they are social security, child support, welfare, unemployment, etc.  There is 
no fee for filing any objection to a bank account levy. 

General requirements for this packet: 
When you file an objection to a bank account levy, you must file the following documents: 

•  Certification in Objection to Levy 
•  Certification of Service; and 
•  Three months of prior bank statements for the account that was frozen (levied). 

You cannot use this packet for: 

•  a motion to vacate a judgment or 
•  an objection to a wage garnishment.  If you wish to file an objection to a wage garnishment, use 

CN 12322 - How to Object to a Wage Garnishment in a Special Civil Part Case. 

Note: These materials have been prepared by the New Jersey Administrative Office of the Courts for use by 
self-represented litigants.  The guides, instructions, and forms will be periodically updated as necessary to 
reflect current New Jersey statutes and court rules.  The most recent version of the forms will be available at 
the county courthouse or on the Judiciary’s Internet site njcourts.gov.  However, you are ultimately responsible 
for the content of your court papers. 

Completed forms are to be submitted to the county where you are filing your case.  A list of 
Special Civil Part Offices is provided at the customer counter and at njcourts.gov

ry to Get a Lawyer 

The court system can be confusing, and it is a 
good idea to get a lawyer if you can.  If you 
cannot afford a lawyer, you may wish to contact 
the legal services program in your county to see 
if you qualify for free legal services.  The 
telephone number can be found online under 
“Legal Aid” or “Legal Services.” 

If you do not qualify for free legal services and 
need help in locating an attorney, you can 
contact the bar association in your county.  Most 
county bar associations have a Lawyer Referral 
Service.  The lawyer referral service can supply 
you with the names of attorneys in your area 
who usually are willing to handle your 
particular type of case. Such attorneys are 
sometimes willing to consult with people in 
your situation at a reduced fee. 

There are also various organizations of minority 
lawyers throughout New Jersey, as well as 
organizations of lawyers who handle specialized 
types of cases.  Ask your court staff for a list of 
lawyer referral services that include these 
organizations. 

What You Should Expect If You 
Represent Yourself 
While you have the right to represent yourself in 
court, you should not expect special treatment, 
help or attention from the court.  You must still 
comply with the Rules of the Court, even if you 
are not familiar with them.  The following is a 
list of some things court staff can and cannot do 
for you.  Please read it carefully before asking 
court staff for help.

how the court works. 

•  We can tell you what the requirements are to 
have your case considered by the court. 
•  We can give you some information from 

your case file. 

•  We can provide you with samples of court 

forms that are available.

How to Object to a Bank Account Levy in a Special Civil Part Case 

Definitions of Words Used in This Packet  

Adversary - An adversary is a party whose interests are opposed to or opposite the interests of 
another party. 

Bank Levy - A bank levy is based upon a goods and chattel execution (writ) issued by the Special 
Civil Part Court that is served by a Special Civil Part Officer on your bank and it allows creditors to 
levy (freeze) and then take funds from your bank account.  Your bank is required to freeze those funds 
in your account to potentially satisfy your debts owed to your judgment creditors. 

Defendant - The defendant is the person (party) against whom the court action (complaint) was filed. 

Docket Number - The number the court assigned to this case when the complaint was filed.  The 
docket number is listed on the complaint, answer and all pleadings relative to a particular case. 

Judgment - A judgment is the official decision of a court in a case. 

Judgment Creditor - The judgment-creditor is the party to whom money is owed. 

Judgment Debtor - The judgment-debtor is the party who owes money. 

Motion - A motion is a written request in which you ask the court to issue an order or to change an 
order it has already issued. 

Oral Argument - Personally appearing in court to explain what you want the court to do. 

Party - A party is a person, business or governmental agency involved in a court action. 

Plaintiff - The plaintiff is the person (party) who starts the court action by filing the complaint. 

Pleading - A pleading is the term used for any written statements presented to the court that contain a 
party’s factual and/or legal position. 

Return Date - The return date is the date the parties are ordered to appear in court. 

Service - Service refers to the mailing or delivering copies of your papers to the lawyer for the other 
party or to the other party if they have no lawyer. 

Special Civil Part Officer - The Special Civil Part Officer was the person assigned to serve the 
goods and chattel execution (writ) upon your bank account.  They earn a 10% commission (calculated 
at 10% of all money collected) which is added onto the judgment amount. 

Wage Garnishment - A wage garnishment or wage execution is when a court issues an order 
requiring your employer to hold back a certain amount of money from your paycheck and send it 
directly to the Special Civil Part Officer on behalf of the person or institution to whom you owe 
money, until your debt (the judgment) is paid off.

How to Object to a Bank Account Levy in a Special Civil Part Case 

The numbered steps listed below tell you what forms you will need to fill out and what to do with them.  Each form should be 
typed or printed clearly on 8 ½ “x 11” white paper only.  Forms may not be filed on a different size or color paper. 

Steps to File an Objection to a Bank Account Levy 

STEP 5:  Mail or deliver your package of 
completed papers to the court 
You can deliver or mail your objection papers to 
the court.  You must personally deliver or mail a 
complete copy to all other parties in the case by 
regular and certified mail, return receipt 
requested.  If any party in the case is represented 
by an attorney, you can personally deliver or 
send by ordinary mail to that attorney. 

You will receive a green receipt card that can 
serve as proof that you mailed the copies.  Your 
local post office can tell you how to send 
certified mail, return receipt requested. 

STEP 6:  You will get a court date 
After you file your papers with the court, and if 
the Certification of Service is complete, a 
hearing will be scheduled within 7 days before a 
Judge to determine if some or all of the monies 
are exempt requiring their release.  The court 
will contact the parties advising of the exact 
date, time and the place to appear.  You must 
appear in court on this date; if you do not, your 
objection may be dismissed. 

Bring all the evidence (documents, bank 
statements, witnesses, etc.) you need to support 
your objection with you to court on your court 
date. 

If you need an interpreter or an accommodation 
for a disability for your hearing, please contact 
the court before your court date. 
 

TEP 1:  Fill out the Certification in Objection 

to Levy 
The Certification in Objection to Levy tells the 
other side and the court why you are objecting 
to having a levy (or freeze) on the bank account. 

 S

STEP 2:  Fill out the Certification of Service 
The Certification of Service tells the court 
how you got the papers to the other party or 
parties and/or their attorneys and the date you 
did so. 

STEP 3:  Where to file 
The objection paperwork must be mailed or 
delivered to the Office of the Special Civil Part 
in the county where the case was filed against 
you.  You may object to the bank levy based 
upon having an “exemption” because the money 
in the account comes from social security, child 
support, welfare, unemployment, etc.  There is 
no fee for filing any objection to a bank levy.  
The county where you must file appears on the 
Notice to Debtor form that you received from 
the Special Civil Part Officer. 

STEP 4:  Check your completed forms 
Check your forms and make sure they are 
complete.  Remove all instruction sheets.  Make 
sure you have signed the forms where you are 
asked to sign them. 

Checklist: You must have the following 
items: 
 

Certification in Objection to Levy 

Certification of Service 

Supporting documentation 
(e.g., copies of bank 
statements)
