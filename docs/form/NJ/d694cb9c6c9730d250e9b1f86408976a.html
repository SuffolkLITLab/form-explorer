defendant that was not on your original complaint, or

support, please call the Family Division Office in the county of venue for additional 
instructions.  The telephone numbers for each county Family Division Office are located on our

Things to Think About Before You Try to Represent Yourself in Court 

Try to Get a Lawyer 
The law, the proofs necessary to present your case, and the procedural rules governing cases in 
the Family Division are complex.  It is recommended that you make every effort to obtain the 
assistance of a lawyer.  If you cannot afford a lawyer, you may contact the legal services 
program in your county to see if you qualify for free legal services.  Their telephone number 
can be found online under “Legal Aid” or “Legal Services.” 

If you do not qualify for free legal services and need help in locating an attorney, you can 
contact the bar association in your county.  Most county bar associations have a Lawyer 
Referral Service. 

The County Bar Lawyer Referral Service can supply you with the names of attorneys in your 
area willing to handle your particular type of case and will sometimes consult with you at a 
reduced fee. 

There are a variety of organizations of minority lawyers throughout New Jersey, as well as 
organizations of lawyers who handle specialized types of cases.  Ask the Family Division 
Office staff in your county for a list of lawyer referral services that include these organizations. 

What You Should Expect If You Represent Yourself 
While you have the right to represent yourself in court, you should not expect special treatment, 
help or attention from the court.  The following is a list of some things court staff can and 
cannot do for you.  Please read it carefully before asking court staff for help. 

•  We can explain and answer questions about how the court works. 
•  We can tell you what the requirements are to have your case considered by the court. 
•  We can give you some information from your case file. 
•  We can provide you with samples of court forms that are available. 
•  We can provide you with guidance on how to fill out forms. 
•  We can usually answer questions about court deadlines. 

•  We cannot give you legal advice.  Only your lawyer can give you legal advice. 
•  We cannot give you an opinion about what will happen if you bring your case to court. 
•  We cannot recommend a lawyer, but we can provide you with the telephone number of a 

local lawyer referral service. 

•  We cannot talk to the judge for you about what will happen in your case. 
•  We cannot let you talk to the judge outside of court. 
•  We cannot change an order issued by a judge.

The numbered steps listed below tell you what forms you will need to fill out and what to do with them.  Each 
form should be typed or printed clearly on 8 ½ “x 11” white paper only.  Forms cannot be filed on a different 
size or color paper.  Use only the forms included in this packet.  Be sure to keep a copy for your records. 

Steps for Filing an Application to 
Amend Domestic Violence Complaint 

STEP 1: Fill out the Application to Amend Domestic Violence Complaint (Form A) 
The Application to Amend Domestic Violence Complaint is a written request in which you ask 
the court to add additional information to the domestic violence complaint that you previously 
filed with the court.  There are four reasons to amend your domestic violence complaint listed 
on the application. 

If you want to amend your complaint and/or order for any other reason, please call the Family 
Division Office of the county in which your order was granted for additional instructions.  The 
telephone numbers for each Family Division Office are listed on our website at njcourts.gov. 

STEP 2: Check your completed forms and make a copy 
Check your form and make sure it is complete.  Remove all instruction sheets.  Make sure you 
have signed and dated the form. 

STEP 3: Upload your completed paperwork 
Upload your completed packet to the Judiciary Electronic Document Submission (JEDS) 
System.  Click on the following link for more information about the JEDS system (including 
FAQs) and how to register to use the system: njcourts.gov.  You can upload your court forms at 
any time through JEDS.  You will receive a confirmation e-mail from JEDS.  However, 
Superior Court staff will only process your request during the normal business hours of 8:30 am 
to 3:30 pm.  Family Division staff will contact you by phone or email within one hour of receipt 
during the normal court hours.  For example, if you submitted your request at 2am, you will 
receive a call or an e-mail from the Family Division by 9:30am. 
When selecting a county to file your paperwork, choose the county where your Temporary 
Restraining Order was granted. 

Next steps: 
Once your email is received by the Family Division, your request will be processed, and the 
amended complaint will be sent to both you and the Defendant. 

Please ensure that your contact information (telephone number, home and email address) 
has been updated with the Family Division Office. 

Note: These applications can only be taken at the Superior Court and are not to be accepted at 
Municipal Courts and/or police departments. 

All courthouse addresses can be found on njcourts.gov.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
