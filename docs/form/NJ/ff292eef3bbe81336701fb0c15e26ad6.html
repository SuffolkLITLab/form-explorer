to the business or competitive position of the designating party. Any party to this litigation or any 
third party who is covered by this Order, who produces or discloses any Attorneys’ Eyes Only

Note: Adopted July 27, 2018 to be effective September 1, 2018, CN: 12316 

page 3 of 6 

7. 

If  counsel  for  a  party  receiving  documents  or  information  designated  as 
Confidential [or Attorneys’ Eyes Only] hereunder objects to such designation of any or all of such 
items, the following procedure shall apply: 

a. 

Counsel for the objecting party shall serve on the designating party or third 
party a written objection to such designation, which shall describe with particularity the documents 
or information in question and shall state the grounds for objection. Counsel for the designating 
party or third party shall respond in writing to such objection within ten (10) days after receipt of 
the  objection,  and  shall  state  with  particularity  the  grounds  for  asserting  that  the  document  or 
information is Confidential [or Attorneys’ Eyes Only]. If no timely written response is made to the 
objection,  the  challenged  designation  will  be  deemed  to  be  void.  If  the  designating  party  or 
nonparty  makes  a  timely  response  to  such  objection  asserting  the  propriety  of  the  designation, 
counsel shall then confer in good faith in an effort to resolve the dispute. 

b. 

If a dispute as to a Confidential [or Attorneys’ Eyes Only] designation of a 
document  or  item  of  information  cannot  be  resolved  by  agreement,  the  proponent  of  the 
designation being challenged shall present the dispute to the Court, in accordance with R. 4:105-
4, before filing a formal motion for an order regarding the challenged designation. The document 
or information  that is  the subject  of the filing shall be treated as originally designated pending 
resolution of the dispute. 

8. 

If the need arises during trial or in any application to/at any hearing before the Court 
for any party to disclose Confidential [or Attorneys’ Eyes Only] information, it may do so only 
after giving notice to the producing party, and as directed by the Court. 

9. 

To  the  extent  consistent  with  applicable  law,  the  inadvertent  or  unintentional 
disclosure  of  Confidential  material  or  Attorneys’  Eyes  Only  material  that  should  have  been 
designated as such, regardless of whether the information, document or thing was so designated at 
the  time  of  disclosure,  shall  not  be  deemed  a  waiver  in  whole  or  in  part  of  a  party’s  claim  of 
confidentiality, either as to the specific information, document or thing disclosed, or as to any other 
material or information concerning the same or related subject matter. Within a reasonable time 
after  disclosure  such  inadvertent  or  unintentional  disclosure  may  be  rectified  by  notifying,  in 
writing, counsel for all parties to whom the material was disclosed that the material should have 
been designated Confidential [or Attorneys’ Eyes Only]. Such notice shall constitute a designation 
of  the  information,  document  or  thing  as  Confidential  or  [Attorneys’  Eyes  Only]  under  this 
Discovery Confidentiality Order. 

10. 

No  information  that  is  in  the  public  domain,  or  which  is  already  known  by  the 
receiving party through proper means, or which is or becomes available to a party from a source 
other than the party asserting confidentiality, rightfully in possession of such information on a non-
confidential basis, shall be deemed or considered to be Confidential material [or Attorneys’ Eyes 
Only] material under this Discovery Confidentiality Order. 

11. 

This  Discovery  Confidentiality  Order  shall  not  deprive  any  party  of  its  right  to 
object  to  discovery  by  any  other  party  or  on  any  otherwise  permitted  ground.  This  Discovery 
Confidentiality Order is being entered without prejudice to the right of any party to move the Court 
for modification or for relief from any of its terms.  This Discovery Confidentiality Order does not 

Note: Adopted July 27, 2018 to be effective September 1, 2018, CN: 12316 

page 4 of 6 

alter the Court Rules and case law regarding the court’s obligation to conduct open hearings, or 
the  parties’  obligation  to  file  pleadings  electronically.  The  parties  further  acknowledge  that 
electronic filing system used by the New Jersey Superior Court permits free and open access for 
the public. Any petition to seal pleadings, documents, records or testimony must be subject to a 
separate court order.  

12. 

This Discovery Confidentiality Order shall survive the termination of this action 
and shall remain in full force and effect unless modified by an Order of this Court, or by the written 
stipulation of the parties filed with the Court. 

13. 

Upon final conclusion of this litigation, which includes the exhaustion of all appeals 
and/or expiration of the time within which to file therefor, each party, or other individual subject 
to the terms hereof, shall be under an obligation to assemble and to return to the originating source 
all originals and unmarked copies of documents and things containing Confidential material [or 
Attorneys’  Eyes  Only  material]  and  to  destroy,  should  such  source  so  request,  all  copies  of 
Confidential material [or Attorneys’ Eyes Only material] that contain and/or constitute attorney 
work  product  as  well  as  excerpts,  summaries  and  digests  revealing  Confidential  material  [or 
Attorneys’ Eyes Only material]; provided, however, that counsel may retain complete copies of 
all transcripts and pleadings, including any exhibits attached thereto, for archival purposes, subject 
to the provisions of this Discovery Confidentiality Order. To the extent a party requests the return 
of  Confidential  material  [or  Attorneys’  Eyes  Only  material]  from  the  Court  after  the  final 
conclusion  of  the  litigation,  including  the  exhaustion  of  all  appeals  therefrom,  and  all  related 
proceedings, the party shall file a motion seeking such relief. 

IT IS SO ORDERED.
