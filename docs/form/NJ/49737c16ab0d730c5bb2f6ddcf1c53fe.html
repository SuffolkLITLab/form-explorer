This Local Property Tax Small Claims handbook was developed to assist the taxpayer in filing an appeal with 
the Tax Court of New Jersey. 

It is not a substitute for the Rules of the Tax Court or for the advice or services of an attorney.  If you cannot 
afford a lawyer, you may contact the Legal Services program in your county.  You can also contact the county 
bar association for information on a lawyer referral service or names of attorneys in your area willing to handle 
your case. 

If you need more information on or a hard copy of any document mentioned in this booklet, contact the Tax 
Court Management Office (609-815-2922, option 1).

In general, your case will be assigned to the judge closest to your property.  You will be given the address and 
telephone number of the assigned judge when the case is scheduled for trial.  If you need that information 
before the trial is scheduled (for example, you wish to make a motion), contact the Tax Court Management

eCourts - Tax Court 
The New Jersey Judiciary uses an electronic filing system called eCourts to maintain case data.  This system 
allows parties to view and print documents filed in an electronic case jacket.  eCourts also sends email 
notifications regarding documents filed, deficiencies and court event dates. 

The Tax Court Management Office uploads documents submitted by a self-represented litigant to eCourts.  Do 
not submit any document you do not wish to be made public.  See General Information section (page 3) for 
information on removal of confidential personal identifiers. 

If you are representing yourself, you may register for a NJ Courts Online Account to view your case jacket and

What is a Local Property Tax Small Claims Case? 

A case is a small claims case if each separately assessed property included in the complaint is one of the 
following: 

•  Class 2 residential property - a lot or parcel of land on which a 1-4 family house is situated OR 

•  Class 3A farm residence - farm property not assessed under the Farmland Assessment Act OR 

•  Prior year’s tax - the property tax paid on your property for the year before the assessment year you are 

appealing must have been less than $25,000. 

Types of Appeals 

Appeal from County Board of Taxation 
You must first file with your county Board of Taxation before filing with the Tax Court when your local 
property tax appeal: 

is not for an added or omitted assessment where the total assessment for one property is $1,000,000 or 
less; OR 

is for an added or omitted assessment where the total assessment for one property is $750,000 or less. 

If you are not satisfied and wish to appeal the county Board of Taxation judgment, you would file with the Tax 
Court.  Click here for links to NJ County Boards of Taxation. 

Direct Appeal 
You may bypass filing with the county Board of Taxation and file directly with the Tax Court when your local 
property tax appeal: 

is not for an added or omitted assessment where the total assessment for one property is more than 
$1,000,000; OR 

is for an added or omitted assessment where the total assessment for one property is more than 
$750,000.

General Information 

Filing Deadlines 
If you want the Tax Court to review your final judgment of the county Board of Taxation, you must file a 
complaint with the Tax Court Management Office within 45 calendar days of the mailing date that appears on 
the county board judgment. 

A complaint for a local property tax appeal that qualifies for a direct appeal to the Tax Court must be received 
in the Tax Court Management Office on or before April 1 of the tax year you are appealing EXCEPT, in a 
taxing district where a municipal-wide revaluation or a municipal-wide reassessment has been implemented, 
complaints that qualify for direct appeal to the Tax Court must be filed on or before May 1 of the tax year you 
are appealing. 

The filed date is the date the Tax Court Management Office receives the complaint, NOT the date the complaint 
was mailed.  If the filing deadline is about to expire and you want to be sure the complaint is filed on time, you 
should bring it directly to the Tax Court Management Office in Trenton. 

Revised 10/2021, CN 10190

Small Claims Case Handbook - Local Property Tax 
At the time you file a complaint with the Tax Court, you must have paid all real estate taxes or any installments 
due for the assessment year involved in your appeal.  In addition, you must have paid any other municipal 
assessments, such as water and sewer charges, as well as all taxes and charges for prior years.  For example, if 
you file your complaint with the Tax Court in June, you must have paid the tax installments and charges due up 
to and including May 1.  If you file in September, you must have paid the tax installments and charges due up to 
and including Aug. 1. 

If you are proceeding in the Small Claims Division based on the prior year’s property tax of less than $25,000, 
you must submit proof of the amount of property tax paid.  You must submit with your complaint, a copy of the 
prior year’s final tax bill or the current year’s notice of assessment card or a statement from you certifying the 
amount of the prior year’s property taxes.  If you fail to submit the required documentation, your complaint will 
be returned as a nonconforming paper stamped “Received but not filed (date)”.  You will have 10 calendar days 
from the date of the notice returning your complaint to correct the deficiency. 

Rule 1:38-7(b) requires attorneys and self-represented litigants to remove (redact) confidential personal 
identifiers from all documents prior to filing, unless required by statute, court rule, administrative directive or 
court order.  Rule 1:38-7(a) defines a confidential personal identifier as a Social Security number, driver’s 
license number, vehicle plate number, insurance policy number, active financial account number, active credit 
card number and military status.  An active financial account number may be identified by the last four digits 
when the account is the subject of litigation and cannot otherwise be identified.  It is not the responsibility of 
court staff to remove confidential personal identifiers when included in pleadings or other documents submitted 
to the court. 

Any form, document or attachment you submit with your complaint is considered a public document.  This 
means the document as submitted will be available to the public upon request.  Therefore, do not enter personal 
identifiers on any document, such as Social Security number, driver’s license number, vehicle plate number, 
insurance policy number, active financial account number, active credit card, military status or medical records.  
Do not submit any document you do not want made public. 

Filing Fee Payment 
The fee to file a small claims complaint involving one property is $50.  The fee to file a small claims complaint 
involving multiple properties is $50 for the first property and $10 for each additional property that is contiguous 
(next to) and in common ownership with the first property, even if separated by a road.  If you are appealing 
two properties in common ownership that are not contiguous, you must file two separate complaints.  The filing 
fee must be received with your complaint.  Checks or money orders must be made payable to the Treasurer, 
State of New Jersey.  If you fail to submit the required fee, your complaint will be returned as a nonconforming 
paper stamped “Received but not filed (date)”.  You will have 10 calendar days from the date of the notice 
returning your complaint to correct the deficiency. 

If you are unable to pay the filing fee, you may request your filing fees be waived by the judge.  To request a 
waiver you must complete the Certification/Petition/Application in Support of a Fee Waiver form and submit it 
to the Tax Court Management Office. 

Proof of Service 
You must provide a copy of the complaint package you filed to the Assessor, Municipal Clerk and county 
Board of Taxation.  Methods of service may be personal or by regular, registered, or certified mail.  Complete 
the form with the date, to whom and how, a copy of the complaint was served.  The date you mail a copy of 
your complaint forms to the county Board of Taxation, the clerk and the tax assessor is the “date served” to be 
used on the Proof of Service form.  The proof of service form is sent to the Tax Court Management Office only.

Preparing Your Case 

Discovery 
Discovery is the process by which each party obtains information or evidence from the other.  In small claims 
cases, discovery is limited to the following: 

•  You are entitled to inspect and, at your cost, obtain from the municipality a copy of the property record 
card for your property.  The municipality must provide you with a copy of the property record card 
within 30 days of your request. 

•  The municipality may request a copy of a closing statement if there has been a sale of your property 

within three years of the assessing date, and it may request the cost of improvements made within three 
years of the assessing date. 

•  The municipality can request income, expense, and lease information if the property is 
income-producing (i.e. you have a tenant to whom you rent all or part of the property). 

•  Limited information can be obtained by the municipality by an onsite inspection of your property.  You 

must permit the inspection to take place. 

Requests for additional information, either by you or by the municipality, can be made only with court approval. 

Revised 10/2021, CN 10190 

page 5 of 14 

Small Claims Case Handbook - Local Property Tax 
If you need additional information from the municipality, you should apply in writing to the assigned Tax Court 
judge and state the reasons for your request. 

You and the municipality must provide each other with information about any comparable sales you will rely on 
at trial.  If an expert is to testify at trial, their report must be provided to you and the municipal attorney before 
the trial. 

Sales of Comparable Properties 
At trial, you will be required to prove to the Tax Court judge that your assessment is excessive.  You can prove 
that your assessment is excessive only by proving the fair market value of your property as of the assessing 
date.  The assessing date is Oct. 1 preceding the year for which your appeal is filed.  For example, the assessing 
date for an appeal of a 2021 assessment is Oct. 1, 2020. 

Fair market value, in general, means the price a willing buyer will pay, and a willing seller will accept.  The 
buyer and seller must be entirely independent of each other and neither compelled to buy or sell. 

You cannot prove the fair market value of your property by comparing your assessment with assessments on 
other properties or comparing your taxes with those of other properties.  Simply describing conditions affecting 
your property, such as heavy traffic or flooding, is not sufficient.  The purchase price of your property is strong 
evidence of value, but it is not conclusive. 

It is your obligation to prove to the judge that you are entitled to a reduction by proving the fair market value of 
your property. 

One method of proving the fair market value of your property is to provide information for the sales of 
comparable properties.  You may use sales of comparable properties, which occurred within a reasonable time 
before or after the Oct. 1 assessing date.  Sales of properties that are similar to your property and occurred 
closer in time to the Oct. 1 assessing date will be more persuasive.  Presenting sales of properties with 
significant differences from your property or which occurred significantly before or after the Oct. 1 assessing 
date will have little persuasiveness. 

For income producing properties, you may rely on comparable rentals.  You need to establish the amount of 
income your property could generate.  This amount must be included in an income approach, which is a 
complex method of determining value. 

If you intend to rely on sales of comparable properties or on comparable rentals, you must provide the attorney 
for the municipality with a list of such comparable sales or comparable rentals.  The municipal attorney must 
receive this list no later than 20 days before the trial date.  Please note that information you provided to the 
county Board of Taxation or the municipality in connection with your county Board of Taxation hearing 
does not satisfy your obligations to your adversary in the Tax Court proceeding. 

For each comparable sale on which you will rely, you must include the following information: 

•  Name of seller and buyer 

•  Date of sale 

•  Sales price 

county 

•  Book and page number at which the Deed is recorded in the Office of the Clerk or registrar of your 

• 

If you can obtain the information, the Form SR-1A identification number assigned to the sale by the 
New Jersey Division of Taxation. 

Revised 10/2021, CN 10190 

page 6 of 14 

Small Claims Case Handbook - Local Property Tax 
For each comparable rental upon which you intend to rely you must include the name of the landlord and tenant, 
the date of the lease and the relevant terms of the lease.  The more similar the comparable rentals are to your 
property and the closer to the Oct. 1 assessing date that the rentals occurred, the more persuasive the 
comparable rentals will be. 

If you intend to rely upon an appraisal or other valuation report, you must supply a copy of the appraisal or 
report to the municipal attorney no later than 20 days before the scheduled trial date.  If the person who 
prepared your appraisal or valuation report does not appear to testify at trial, the Tax Court judge might not rely 
on the appraisal or report. 

If the municipality will rely upon an appraisal or other valuation report, it must supply it to you no later than 
20 days before the scheduled trial date.  The person who prepared the report will testify about it and you will 
have the opportunity to cross-examine them. 

Chapter 123 Ratio 

Each year, the Director of the Division of Taxation determines the average ratio of assessed value to the true 
value of all real property in each municipality.  This ratio is known as the Chapter 123 Ratio, N.J.S.A. 54:51A-6.  
For a list of the Chapter 123 Ratios click here or contact your municipal tax assessor. 

Unless there has been a revaluation or reassessment in your municipality for the tax year under appeal, the 
Chapter 123 Ratio is used to determine whether you are entitled to a reduction in assessment, once the fair 
market value of your property is determined. 

Chapter 123 provides that a taxpayer is entitled to a reduction in assessment only if the ratio of the assessment 
on the taxpayer's property to the fair market value of the property exceeds the upper limit of the ratio.  The 
assessment is subject to increase if the ratio of the assessed value to fair market value is less than the lower limit 
of the ratio. 

The upper limit of the Chapter 123 Ratio is the ratio plus 15 percent of the ratio.  If, for example, the Chapter 
123 Ratio is 80 percent, the upper limit would be 92 percent, as determined using the following calculations: 

(Ratio) 
 

80 X .15 (15 percent of Ratio) = 12 
12 + 80 = 92 or 92 percent 

The lower limit of the Chapter 123 Ratio is the ratio less 15 percent of the ratio.  If the Chapter 123 Ratio is 80 
percent, the lower limit would be 68 percent. 

Before applying the Chapter 123 Ratio, the judge must first determine the fair market value of your property.  
Once the judge has determined the fair market value, the ratio is then applied as in the following examples. 

If, in any given year, the Chapter123 Ratio for your municipality is 80 percent with an upper limit of 92 percent 
and a lower limit of 68 percent AND the assessment on your property is $190,000 AND the judge determines 
the fair market value to be $200,000, THEN, to determine if the upper or lower limit of the ratio was exceeded, 
the following calculation is performed (based on the example above): 

$190,000 divided by $200,000 = .95 or 95 percent. 

Since 95 percent exceeds the upper limit of 92 percent, your assessment would be reduced.  To determine 
the new assessment value, multiply the fair market value times the Chapter 123 Ratio: 

$200,000 (Fair Market Value) x .80 (ratio) = $160,000 

Your assessment would be reduced from $190,000 to $160,000. 

Revised 10/2021, CN 10190 

page 7 of 14 

Small Claims Case Handbook - Local Property Tax 
If the judge in that same case had determined the fair market value of your property to be $300,000, THEN: 

$190,000 divided by $300,000 = .63 or 63 percent. 

Since 63 percent is lower than the lower limit of 68 percent, your assessment would be increased.  To 
determine the new assessment value, multiply the fair market value times the Chapter 123 Ratio: 

$300,000 (Fair Market Value) x .80 (ratio) = $240,000 

Your assessment would be increased from $190,000 to $240,000. 

If the ratio of assessment to fair market value of your property falls between the lower limit and the upper limit 
of the Chapter 123 Ratio, your assessment will not be changed.

If the county Board of Taxation correctly dismissed your case because you did not pay the required 
amount of taxes and municipal charges due at the time you appealed to the county Board of 
Taxation. 

2.  Failure to Provide Income and Expense Information 

If you are the owner of an income-producing property and you did not provide the assessor with 
requested income and expense information within 45 days of the assessor's written request.  This 
information is requested for the year before the taxes being appealed and is not information 
requested during discovery. 

3.  Prior Settlement, Withdrawal or Failure to Pursue Your Case before the county Board of Taxation 

If the Tax Court determines that, you settled or withdrew your case before the county Board of 
Taxation OR failed to present your appeal at a hearing before the county Board of Taxation.  For 
example, you did not appear on the scheduled hearing date. 

4.  Late Filing 
• 

If you did not file your petition of appeal with the county Board of Taxation or, if a direct appeal, 
with the Tax Court by the filing deadline, generally April 1 of the tax year under appeal. 
If you did not file your complaint with the Tax Court within 45 days after the date the county Board 
of Taxation judgment was mailed to you. 

The four reasons for dismissal listed above are the most common.  However, other Rules exist which may 
also result in dismissal of your case.

Other Important Items 

Do I Need An Attorney? 
You can present your own case at trial unless ownership of your property is in the name of a corporation or an 
entity other than a sole proprietor.  A New Jersey attorney must appear on behalf of a corporation or entity such 
as a trust. 

Subpoena Process 
A subpoena can be used to compel a witness to appear and testify at trial, to produce a specific important 
document or to produce other existing items of evidence.  You are responsible for issuing and serving the 
subpoena on the proposed witness within a reasonable time prior to trial.  Additionally, you incur responsibility 
for all fees associated with this process.  Sample subpoena forms are available from the Tax Court Management 
Office or clicking on these links: Subpoena Ad Testificandum (Request Someone’s Testimony in Court); 
Subpoena Duces Tecum (Request an Appearance or Documents). 

Trial Notice 
You will receive a notice from the Tax Court Management Office stating the date, time, location and the 
assigned judge for your case.  The Tax Court Management Office makes every effort to schedule a small claims 
matter within six months of the date of filing of the complaint to give you adequate time to arrange for your 
appearance. 

Motion Practice 
If you need formal action by the Tax Court prior to trial, you must file a motion directly with the judge assigned 
to your case.  If your complaint has not been assigned to a judge, the motion must be filed with the judge 
assigned to the geographical area in which your property is located.  For a complete listing of the names, 
addresses, telephone numbers and geographical assignments, click here or contact the Tax Court Management 
Office. 

A copy of the motion and all documents must be sent to the other party.  Return dates (dates the judge will 
consider the motion) for motions are generally every other Friday.  Exact dates may be obtained by calling the 
assigned judge’s chambers.  For the Notice of Motion Packet click here or contact the Tax Court Management 
Office. 

Withdrawal Process 
A complaint may be withdrawn by forwarding a Letter of Withdrawal the court.  For a sample withdrawal letter 
click here. 

Communicating with the Judge 
Copies of all letters and other written communications you send to the assigned judge must also be mailed to the 
attorney for the municipality. 

Settling Your Case before Trial 

You can reach a settlement agreement with the municipality at any time before or up to your trial.  If the tax 
assessor for your municipality does not communicate with you before the trial is scheduled, you should contact 
the assessor or the municipal attorney a few days before the scheduled trial date and ask if they are willing to 
discuss settlement of your appeal. 

If you reach a settlement agreement, the assessor or the municipal attorney will prepare a Stipulation of 
Settlement for your signature and signature by the municipal attorney.  Once the Stipulation of Settlement has 
been signed by all parties, the assessor or municipal attorney will send it to the assigned Tax Court judge. 

Revised 10/2021, CN 10190 

page 9 of 14 

Small Claims Case Handbook - Local Property Tax 
If you settle, notify the Tax Court judge immediately.  If the municipal attorney cannot notify the court, it is 
your responsibility to do so. 

You do not need to appear in court on the scheduled trial date if you settle your case.  If you do not settle by the 
trial date, a Tax Court judge will hear your case. 

The Trial 

Every effort will be made to schedule trial within six months of the filing of the complaint.  If you have any 
questions about or problems with the trial date, communicate directly with the assigned judge’s chambers.  The 
judge’s telephone number is provided on the trial notice or click here for a complete listing of addresses and 
phone numbers. 

The trial in small claims cases is conducted informally and the Rules of Evidence are not strictly applied.  All 
testimony is given under oath, and the proceedings are recorded.  You will have an opportunity to explain to the 
judge why you believe your assessment is too high and to present whatever evidence you believe supports your 
position.  You should be prepared to prove the value of your property.  If you supplied a copy of an appraisal or 
report to the municipal attorney, the person who prepared your appraisal or valuation report must appear to 
testify at trial or the Tax Court judge might not rely on the appraisal or report. 

After you and each witness testifying on your behalf finish testifying, the municipal attorney will have the right 
to ask you and each witness questions.  This is called cross-examination.  You can state your opinion as to the 
value of your property.  You also can present the in-person testimony of an expert, such as a real estate 
appraiser.  The judge might not consider an appraisal or other opinion as to value unless: 1) the person who 
prepared the appraisal or opinion testifies at the trial and 2) the appraisal or the other opinion of value is 
provided to the municipality at least 20 days before the trial. 

After you have presented your case the municipality has the right to present its case, which usually consists of 
testimony from the assessor or other expert.  After each witness presented by the municipality has finished 
testifying, you will have the right to ask that person questions, just as the municipal attorney can cross-examine 
your witnesses. 

The judge will usually render a decision at the conclusion of the trial. 

After Trial or Settlement 

The Judgment 
You will receive a judgment reflecting the decision of the court after your case has been decided or after a 
Stipulation of Settlement has been signed by all parties and received by the court. 

The Freeze Act 
After a judgment is entered in your case, pursuant to statute, N.J.S.A. 54:51A-8, you have the right to seek 
Freeze Act relief.  The Freeze Act “freezes” your tax assessment at the judgment amounts for the following two 
tax years, unless the municipality has undertaken a complete revaluation or reassessment there has been a 
change in the value of your property.  For example, you have made improvements to the property.   

If you want to apply the Freeze Act you can request it from the judge at your hearing, have it included in the 
Stipulation of Settlement, or apply afterward by submitting the Freeze Act application form.  Note: you cannot 
request freeze act relief for each year until October 1 of the prior year.  For example, you cannot request your 
2020 assessment be applied to or “frozen” for tax year 2021 until October 1, 2020.

Appeals 
If you are dissatisfied with a Tax Court decision you may appeal to the Appellate Division of Superior Court.  
Your notice of appeal to the Appellate Division must be filed within 45 days of the date of the Tax Court 
decision.  Appellate Division forms and instructions for attorneys and self-represented litigants are available on 
the Appellate Division webpage or by calling the Appellate Division Clerk's Office at 609-815-2950.. 

Requesting a Tax Court transcript for appeal and non-appeal purposes 
Transcripts are the written record of exactly what was said during court.  There are two types of transcripts: 
appeal and non-appeal.  Appeal transcripts are mandatory and are ordered during the appeal process.  Non-
appeal transcripts are used for reasons other than an appeal.  See Court Transcript Request for instructions on 
ordering Tax Court transcripts for appeal and non-appeal purposes. 

Requesting a Tax Court transcript for appeal and non-appeal purposes 
To obtain a CD or cassette tape of your Tax Court proceeding, complete the Tax Court Sound Recording 
Request Form (CN 12478).  The fee for each CD or cassette tape is $10.  Mail completed form with a check or 
money order payable to the Treasurer, State of New Jersey to the Tax Court Clerk’s Office, P.O. Box 972, 
Trenton, NJ 08625.  Note: the CD or cassette tape may not be used for appeal purposes. 

A copy of your notice of appeal to the Appellate Division should also be sent to your adversary, the assigned 
trial judge and the Tax Court Clerk/Administrator, as required by the Appellate Division Rules. 

Final Notes 

• File on time.

• Complete all forms and include the correct filing fee.

•

•

If you are an entity other than a sole proprietor, such as a corporation or a trust, you must be represented
by a New Jersey attorney.

• Be sure to submit proof of the prior year’s property tax if you are appealing based on taxes less than
$25,000.  You must submit a copy of the prior year’s final tax bill or the current year’s notice of
assessment card or a statement from you certifying the amount of the prior year’s property taxes with
your complaint.

If you intend to rely on sales or rentals of comparable properties or an appraisal report, you must supply
a list of the sales or rentals or a copy of the appraisal report to the municipal attorney not later than 20
days before the trial.

• Have your proofs ready and subpoena any witnesses for trial.
