GUIDELINES FOR COURT-APPOINTED ATTORNEYS IN GUARDIANSHIP MATTERSIntroduction

Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 3B:1-2, an “incapacitated individual” is 

an individual who is impaired by reason of mental illness or 

intellectual disability to the extent that the individual lacks 

sufficient capacity to self-govern and manage their own affairs. 

The term is also used to designate an individual who is impaired 

by reason of physical illness or disability, chronic use of drugs, 

chronic alcoholism, or other cause (except minority) to the 

extent that the individual lacks sufficient capacity to govern 

themselves and manage their affairs. 

Rule 4:86-4(a)(7) requires the court to appoint legal counsel to 

represent persons alleged to be incapacitated if they are not 

already represented by counsel. Your role as court-appointed 

attorney is critical for the protection of the most vulnerable 

citizens in our society. In representing an alleged incapacitated 

person (“AIP”), you are helping to provide fair and equal 

treatment for those who cannot protect themselves. These 

guidelines are intended to assist a court-appointed attorney 

in fulfilling the requirements of the Rules of Court in the 

representation of an AIP.

NEW JERSEY COURTS |  www.njcourts.govOverview

After a guardianship complaint is filed, the court enters 

the contents of the report, including the following:

GUIDELINES FOR COURT-APPOINTED ATTORNEYS IN GUARDIANSHIP MATTERSStandard Procedures 
for Representing an AIP

The following is a general guideline for how to approach your role as court-appointed attorney. The particular 

facts and circumstances of a case will dictate what is needed from you.

OBTAIN BACKGROUND INFORMATION
You will need to obtain copies of the complaint, Order 
for Hearing, physicians’ affidavits, Certification of Assets, 
and any other pleadings. Many guardianship plaintiffs 
are self-represented. Contact the Surrogate’s Office for 
the case file if the pleadings cannot be obtained from a 
self-represented plaintiff. If the plaintiff is represented 
by counsel, call the plaintiff’s attorney to obtain the 
pleadings and any other background information. In 
addition, confirm that the AIP was personally served with 
a copy of the order, complaint, supporting affidavits, and 
notice of right to oppose the action and demand a trial 
by jury as required by R. 4:86- 4(a)(2) and (5). 

INTERVIEW THE AIP
You must personally interview the AIP in order to 
observe and report on their condition. Attempt to 
converse with your client. Examine available medical 
records. Speak with caregivers and other persons 
familiar with the AIP’s physical and mental state and 
property. Inquire into the physician’s opinions about 
the functional abilities of the AIP.

INTERVIEW THE PROPOSED GUARDIAN
If possible, interview the person who seeks to be 
appointed the guardian. Attempt to elicit the intentions 
of the proposed guardian for the future care of the AIP, 
as well as the proposed guardian’s qualifications to 
be guardian. It is also prudent to discuss the potential 
bonding and reporting requirements to ensure that the 
person seeking guardianship appointment is capable 

6

of qualifying for a surety bond and is willing to assume 
responsibility for periodic reporting.

REVIEW BACKGROUND SCREENING RESULTS
In some guardianships, the court will provide the 
results of the proposed guardian’s background 
screening obtained pursuant to the New Jersey Judiciary 
Background Screening Policy for Proposed Guardians 
of Incapacitated Adults. This information must be 
incorporated into your report. After reviewing the 
results, return the records to the court for destruction in 
accordance with the policy and local procedures. 

IDENTIFY ASSETS
Make reasonable inquiry concerning the extent of the 
AIP’s assets. Your inquiry should include whether the 
AIP has any property interests as a beneficiary of a last 
will and testament, special needs trust, or other trust 
instrument. Identify any assets that are not mentioned 
in the plaintiff’s pleadings. If questions arise about 
the prior handling of those assets, bring them to the 
attention of the court in your report. 

Many AIPs have limited assets and no income other 
than Social Security benefits. In those cases, your report 
should identify the AIP’s Social Security representative 
payee, and the representative payee’s relationship to  
the AIP. 

NEW JERSEY COURTS |  www.njcourts.govIDENTIFY ADVANCE PLANNING DOCUMENTS
Advance planning documents executed prior to the AIP’s 
incapacity may supply insight into the AIP’s medical and 
financial condition and preferences. These may include:

•  Power of attorney
• 
• 
•  Advance directive for healthcare

Last Will and Testament
Inter vivos trust 

Determine whether your client has advance planning 
documents. If so, identify any individuals in possession 
of the documents. Obtain copies of the documents, 
review them and report on their contents to the court. 
In particular, note individuals designated as attorney-
in-fact or health care proxy, and whether they have ever 
exercised those powers. If a testamentary designation of 
guardian was made, note this as well.

DRAFT AND FILE REPORT
A form Report of Court-Appointed Counsel for the 
Alleged Incapacitated Person is provided at Appendix A.  
For the fillable Microsoft Word version of this form, go 
to www.njcourts.gov and search for “Report of Court-
Appointed Counsel” (CN 12789). Except to the extent that 
the court explicitly directs otherwise, this form must be 
used to draft the report in compliance with R. 4:86-4(b)
(2). Its provisions may be supplemented or amended as 
needed, based on the facts and circumstances of  
the case. 

File the written report with the court at least 10 days 
prior to the date of guardianship hearing. Serve a copy of 
the report on the plaintiff’s attorney and any other party 
who has appeared in the matter. 

FILE APPLICATION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES
Prior to the hearing, file and serve on interested parties 
an application for payment of attorney’s fees and 
expenses, supported by an affidavit or certification  
of services. 

APPEAR AT THE HEARING
On the date of the hearing, appear in court to represent 
the AIP. Although counsel must appear at the hearing, 
R. 4:86-5(c) allows the AIP’s appearance to be waived if 
the plaintiff and court-appointed attorney certify that the 
AIP is unable to appear because of physical or mental 
incapacity. In addition, R. 4:86-6(a) allows the court – 
with your consent – to dispense with the oral testimony 
of a person who has filed an affidavit or certification 
pursuant to R. 4:86-2(b) at the hearing and to instead 
rely on their submitted affidavits or certifications. Be 
prepared to place an oral summary of your findings and 
conclusions on the record. 

The person challenging the AIP’s capacity bears 
the burden of proving such incapacity by clear and 
convincing evidence. See In re M.R., 135 N.J. 155, 168-69 
(1994). The plaintiff must establish that the AIP is unfit 
and unable to govern themselves and to manage their 
affairs in a particular area or as to all areas. The plaintiff 
should also establish that no less restrictive form of 
intervention is reasonable that is consistent with the 
AIP’s welfare and safety. Additionally, the plaintiff should 
also present evidence that the proposed guardian is a 
fit and proper person to be appointed and that they are 
capable of carrying out the responsibilities of a guardian. 
If appropriate, be prepared to cross-examine the  
plaintiff’s witnesses. 

Finally, if the AIP possesses assets, request that the court 
consider your fee request and provide for the payment of 
attorney’s fees in the judgment. Under R. 4:86-5(e), the 
compensation of the court-appointed counsel for the AIP 
may be fixed by the court to be paid out of the estate of 
the AIP, or in such other manner as the court shall direct. 
In matters where funds are not available, the court-
appointed attorney may be appointed to serve pro bono 
with the appreciation of the court.

GUIDELINES FOR COURT-APPOINTED ATTORNEYS IN GUARDIANSHIP MATTERSPotential Issues Unique to 
Guardianship Proceedings

MAINTAINING AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE AIP 
A court-appointed attorney must be aware of the 
obligations and responsibilities inherent in the legal 
representation of an AIP. The court-appointed attorney 
acts as an advocate for the interests of the AIP and 
takes an active part in the proceedings. Matter of Mason, 
305 N.J. Super. 120, 127 (Chan. Div. 1997). The Rules of 
Professional Conduct (“RPC”) mandate that an attorney 
representing a disabled person should maintain, as 
much as possible, a normal attorney-client relationship 
with that person. RPC 1.14(a). 

Attorneys must be mindful that an adjudication of 
incapacity need not deprive the incapacitated person 
of the right to make all decisions. The primary duty of 
the attorney for an AIP is to protect their client’s rights, 
including the right to make decisions on specific matters. 

Ordinarily, an attorney should abide by the client’s 
decisions concerning the objectives of representation, 
and act with reasonable diligence in representing 
and advocating on behalf of the client. In the context 
of a guardianship case, this requires you to try to 
communicate with the AIP, and present the AIP’s 
opinions and preferences to the court, provided the 
opinions or preferences are not patently absurd or pose 
an undue risk of harm. In the Matter of M.R., 135 N.J.  
155 (1994). 

The AIP may retain counsel independently. If the AIP 
obtains other counsel, such counsel shall notify the court 
and you at least 10 days prior to the hearing date.

GUARDIANSHIPS INVOLVING THE DIVISION OF  
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES 
Individuals that are eligible for services from the Division 
of Developmental Disabilities (“DDD”) may file a verified 
complaint for guardianship pursuant to N.J.S.A. 30:4-
165.8 and R. 4:86-10 (as opposed to R. 4:86-2, which 
applies to individuals seeking guardianship that are not 
eligible for DDD services). In these cases, a copy of an 
Individualized Education Program, a certification from 
a director of the DDD, or a certification of a treating 
professional may be attached to the complaint in lieu 
of a second affidavit or certification from a physician 
or psychologist. Unless private counsel is requested, 
the Public Defender should be appointed pro bono to 
8

represent AIPs in proceedings brought under Title 30 for 
guardianship of the person only. N.J.S.A. 30:4-165.14 and 
R. 4:86-10(c). If the Public Defender is not available, a 
private attorney may be appointed pro bono. 

If you are appointed to represent an AIP who is 
eligible for services from the DDD, your duties and 
responsibilities as counsel do not change. Typically, there 
are minimal assets in the guardianship estate, so funding 
for additional expert witnesses may be limited if needed. 

TEMPORARY PENDENTE LITE GUARDIANSHIPS
A temporary pendente lite guardian may be in place while 
you are representing the AIP. A temporary pendente lite 
guardian may be requested in the verified complaint in 
accordance with N.J.S.A. 3B:12-24.1(c) if there is a critical 
need or risk of substantial harm to the AIP. Appointment 
of a temporary pendente lite guardian is not an 
adjudication of incapacity, and does not limit the rights 
of the AIP, except as specified. The temporary pendente 
lite guardianship expires after 45 days unless extended 
for good cause shown. Your investigation should include 
interviewing the temporary pendente lite guardian to 
obtain the most current information.  

CONTESTING THE GUARDIANSHIP INCAPACITY

In many cases, upon investigation, there will be little 
question of incapacity. Your report should clearly 
express this conclusion and the facts upon which it is 
based. However, there are cases in which the issue of 
incapacity is a close question of fact. 

If an AIP opposes an adjudication of incapacity and 
appointment of a guardian, then you should file an 
answer – not a report – at least 10 days before the 
hearing. R. 4:86-5(d). You may attach affidavits from 
physicians to the answer, or you may need to petition 
the court for an independent physical or psychiatric 
evaluation of the AIP by a medical or mental health 
professional. You will have to argue that the plaintiff 
has not met their burden of establishing incapacity 
by clear and convincing evidence, and that the case 
should be dismissed.  

Note: Interested parties may also contest an 
adjudication of incapacity and/or appointment of a 
guardian. 
 

NEW JERSEY COURTS |  www.njcourts.govSUBSEQUENT PROCEEDINGS IN EXISTING 
GUARDIANSHIPS 
You may be appointed in a case where a guardianship was already 
established – either in New Jersey or another jurisdiction. Your 
role as the court-appointed attorney remains the same, but your 
inquiry may change depending on the particular facts of your 
assigned case. 

In some cases, the incapacitated person may be in need of a 
substitute or successor guardian because the originally appointed 
guardian has been removed or is no longer able or willing to 
serve as guardian. In addition to evaluating the suitability of the 
proposed substitute or successor guardian, you should determine 
whether there are any changes to the capacity, assets, medical 
and/or residential/care needs of the incapacitated person since 
the guardianship was first established. In your report, include 
any other changed circumstances or relationships that should be 
brought to the court’s attention.

In other cases, a guardian may seek to transfer an out-of-state 
or – in rare instances – an out-of-country guardianship to 
New Jersey. The New Jersey Adult Guardianship and Protective 
Proceedings Jurisdiction Act, N.J.S.A. 3B:12B-1 et seq., governs 
such transfers. N.J.S.A. 3B:12B-18 outlines the procedure for 
transferring a guardianship from another state to New Jersey.
N.J.S.A. 3B:12B-4 states that a court may treat a foreign country as 
if it were a state of this country for the purpose of applying the 
act, with certain exceptions.  While rare, international transfers 
can be accomplished with great care.  In these instances, it is 
important to be sensitive to unique circumstances that may exist 
due to the absence of available guardians in the country from 
which the guardianship is transferred. 

NDING REPRESENTATION: FEES AND DISCHARGE 
A certification requesting attorney’s fees should be filed and 
served on interested parties prior to the guardianship hearing 
date. The certification may include fees for services as a temporary 
pendente lite guardian if you served in that capacity. Under R. 4:86-
5(e), the compensation of the court-appointed counsel for the AIP 
– as well as the attorney for the party seeking guardianship and 
the GAL, if any – may be fixed by the court to be paid out of the 
estate of the AIP, or in such other manner as the court shall direct. 
In rare circumstances, fees may be allocated against one or more 
parties. See I.M.O. Sally Dinoia, 2019 N.J. Super. LEXIS 194 (App. Div. 
Dec. 26, 2019) (affirming payment of attorney fees by county Adult 
Protective Services to court-appointed counsel). In matters where 
funds are not available, the court-appointed attorney may be 
appointed to serve pro bono with the appreciation of the court.

CHOICE OF GUARDIAN OR CARE PLAN
Even if incapacity is uncontested, the AIP may want to contest 
other issues. An AIP often has the ability to understand matters 
affecting their own well-being, and may express personal 
opinions and preferences – for example, about the identity of 
the proposed guardian or where they want to live. Your task is 
to identify these opinions and preferences and convey them to 
the court.

In some cases, the interested parties will argue and file 
petitions seeking to be appointed as guardian. It is your 
responsibility to interview all of the interested parties and 
include your findings in your report. 

Occasionally, a guardianship application will be filed without 
identification of a proposed guardian. In this circumstance, 
inquire as to whether any interested parties are suitable and 
willing to be appointed guardian. These may include a person 
acting as the AIP’s attorney-in-fact or health care proxy. If no 
individual is available and willing to be appointed guardian, 
determine whether another individual or entity may be 
relied upon for appointment. These may include a nonprofit 
organization, volunteer guardian, or public agency. The Office 
of Public Guardians for Elderly Adults may be appointed if the 
AIP is over 60 years old. The Bureau of Guardianship Services 
may be appointed as guardian of the person if the AIP is eligible 
or receiving services from the Division of Developmental 
Disabilities. 

 E

GUARDIAN AD LITEM 
A guardian ad litem (“GAL”) may be appointed at any time prior 
to entry of judgment where special circumstances come to the 
attention of the court. Unlike a court-appointed attorney, who has 
a duty to advocate for the expressed preferences of the AIP, a GAL 
evaluates the best interest of the AIP and presents that evaluation 
to the court. If a conflict arises between the preferences of the AIP 
and their best interests, you should inform the court of the conflict 
and the possible need for appointment of a GAL. See In the Matter 
of M.R., 135 N.J. 155 (1994); In re C.F.C., 2013 N.J. Super. Unpub. LEXIS 
1104 (App. Div. 2013); S.T. v. 1515 Broad St., LLC, 241 N.J. 257 (2020).

CONSENT ORDERS AND SETTLEMENT
A verified complaint for guardianship and supporting 
certifications establish a prima facie case of incapacity. As such, 
the matter cannot be withdrawn absent proof that the AIP has 
capacity and does not require a guardian. Withdrawal without 
court order is permitted only if the AIP dies prior to service of the 
Order for Hearing. 

An AIP cannot consent to an adjudication of incapacity or the 
appointment of a plenary guardian. See In re Guardianship of 
Macak, 377 N.J. Super. 167 (App. Div. 2005). However, certain 
aspects of a guardianship – such as residential arrangement or 
care plan – may be resolved through consent subject to  
court approval.  

Typically, the judgment will include a paragraph discharging the 
court-appointed attorney. If the judgment does not discharge you 
from the case, you will receive copies of all court-issued notices 
related to the guardianship. These notices may pertain to the 
guardian’s failure to qualify or comply with periodic  
reporting requirements.

GUIDELINES FOR COURT-APPOINTED ATTORNEYS IN GUARDIANSHIP MATTERSEthical Issues in 
Guardianship Matters

ACCEPTANCE OF APPOINTMENT AND REPRESENTATION 
OF AN ALLEGED INCAPACITATED PERSON 
The court maintains a list of attorneys for appointment 
in guardianship actions. A court-appointed attorney for 
an AIP may serve pro bono or be paid, depending on 
the guardianship estate assets and the complexity of the 
case. Mentoring by experienced attorneys and training 
though local bar associations may be available for 
attorneys interested in guardianship appointments. 

APPOINTMENT AS GUARDIAN
In rare cases in which no other individual, organization 
or public agency is available or willing to serve as 
guardian for an AIP, the court may request to appoint 
you as guardian. If you agree to the appointment, the 
judgment will end your service as court-appointed 
counsel and begin your role as guardian of the person 
and/or estate. In some cases, the judgment may set the 
length of time that you will serve as guardian.

s guardian, you are entitled to fiduciary commissions 

on the income and corpus of the guardianship estate 
under N.J.S.A. 3B:18-24 and N.J.S.A. 3B:18-25. You may 
also request court approval for attorney’s fees for any 
legal work performed. However, you may not charge the 
guardianship estate for your performance of non-legal 
guardianship tasks unless expressly authorized in  
the judgment. 

XEMPTION FROM MADDEN REQUIREMENTS FOR 
PRO BONO SERVICES
New Jersey attorneys who provide at least 25 hours of 
services in adult guardianship matters may claim an 
exemption from the Madden v. Delran, 126 N.J. 591 (1992) 
pro bono requirement for the subsequent year. 

The Madden exemption is available to attorneys who are 
appointed by the court to serve as:

(i) attorney for an alleged incapacitated person;
(ii) Guardian Ad Litem in a guardianship matter;
(iii) temporary pendente lite guardian;
(iv) permanent guardian of an adjudicated  
       incapacitated person; or
(v) special medical guardian.

n attorney who seeks to claim an exemption from 
Madden requirements based on pro bono services in 
adult guardianship matters must submit a certification  
via the Judiciary’s pro bono unit.

When accepting an appointment in a guardianship 
matter, representing an AIP in a contested guardianship, 
recommending that a GAL be appointed, and/or 
submitting a certification of attorney’s fees, consider the 
following RPCs:

RPC 1.1 (Competence);
RPC 1.3 (Diligence);
RPC 1.5 (Fees);

NABILITY TO REPRESENT ALLEGED 
INCAPACITATED PERSON
A court-appointed attorney is obligated to inform the 
court if they are unable to handle an assigned matter 
professionally due to lack of expertise and inability to 
obtain sufficient knowledge to adequately represent 
their client and are also unable to retain a substitute 
attorney knowledgeable in the practice area. See I.M.O.
