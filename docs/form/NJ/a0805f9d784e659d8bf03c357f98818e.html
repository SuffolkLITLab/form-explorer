How to Object to a Wage Garnishment 

Superior Court of New Jersey - Special Civil Part 

Who Should Use This Packet? 

You can use this packet if you received a Notice of Application for Wage Garnishment and you want to 
object to the wage garnishment, if a wage execution has already been issued and you still want to object 
to the wage garnishment or if you want to reduce the amount of money that is currently being garnished.  
A Special Civil Part wage garnishment is called a levy on wages or wage execution. 

General requirements for this packet: 
When you file an objection to a wage garnishment you must file the following documents: 

•  Objection to Wage Garnishment and 
•  Certification (Proof) of Service; 
•  Wage Garnishment Worksheet (Use this form only if money is already being taken from your 

paycheck and you believe more is being taken than allowed by law). 

You cannot use this packet for: 

• 
• 

a motion to vacate a judgment or 
an objection to a levy on a bank account or a levy on other personal items.  If you wish to file an objection 
to a bank account levy, use CN 12323 - How to Object to a Bank Levy in the Special Civil Part. 

Note: These materials have been prepared by the New Jersey Administrative Office of the Courts for use by 
self-represented litigants.  The guides, instructions, and forms will be periodically updated as necessary to 
reflect current New Jersey statutes and court rules.  The most recent version of the forms will be available at 
the county courthouse or on the Judiciary’s Internet site njcourts.gov.  However, you are ultimately responsible 
for the content of your court papers. 

Completed forms are to be submitted to the county where the judgment was entered which is the county 
where the lawsuit was filed.  A list of Special Civil Part Offices is provided at the customer counter and at 
njcourts.gov

ry to Get a Lawyer 

The court system can be confusing, and it is a 
good idea to get a lawyer if you can.  If you 
cannot afford a lawyer, you may wish to contact 
the legal services program in your county to see 
if you qualify for free legal services.  The 
telephone number can be found online under 
“Legal Aid” or “Legal Services.” 

If you do not qualify for free legal services and 
need help in locating an attorney, you can 
contact the bar association in your county.  Most 
county bar associations have a Lawyer Referral 
Service.  The lawyer referral service can supply 
you with the names of attorneys in your area 
who usually are willing to handle your 
particular type of case.  Such attorneys are 
sometimes willing to consult with people in 
your situation at a reduced fee. 

There are also various organizations of minority 
lawyers throughout New Jersey, as well as 
organizations of lawyers who handle specialized 
types of cases.  Ask your court staff for a list of 
lawyer referral services that include these 
organizations. 

What You Should Expect If You 
Represent Yourself 
While you have the right to represent yourself in 
court, you should not expect special treatment, 
help or attention from the court.  You must still 
comply with the Rules of the Court, even if you 
are not familiar with them.  The following is a 
list of some things court staff can and cannot do 
for you.  Please read it carefully before asking 
court staff for help. 

•  We can explain and answer questions about 

how the court works. 

•  We can tell you what the requirements are to 
have your case considered by the court.

How to Object to a Wage Garnishment in a Special Civil Part Case 

The numbered steps listed below tell you what forms you will need to fill out and what to do with them.  Each form should be 
typed or printed clearly on 8 ½ “x 11” white paper only.  Forms may not be filed on a different size or color paper. 

Steps to File an Objection to a Wage Garnishment 

STEP 5: Check your completed forms 
Check your forms and make sure they are complete.  
Remove all instruction sheets.  Make sure you have 
signed the forms where you are asked to sign them. 

Checklist: You must have the following items: 
Certification in Objection to Wage 
 
Garnishment 

Wage Garnishment Worksheet (when 
seeking reduction to wage garnishment) 

Certification of Service 

Any other supporting documentation 

TEP 6: Mail or deliver your package of 

completed papers to the court 
You can deliver or mail your objection papers to the 
court.  You must personally deliver or mail a 
complete copy to all other parties in the case by 
regular and certified mail, return receipt requested.  
If an attorney represents any other party in the case, 
you can personally deliver or send the copies to the 
attorney by regular mail. 

You will receive a green receipt card that can serve 
as proof that you mailed the copies.  Your local post

Certification of Service is complete, a hearing will 
be scheduled within 7 days before a Judge to 
determine if the wage garnishment should be 
reduced or eliminated.  The court will contact the 
parties advising of the exact date, time and the place 
to appear.  You must appear in court on this date; if 
you do not, your objection may be dismissed. 

Bring all the evidence (wage garnishment worksheet, 
any supporting documents, etc.) you need to support 
your objection with you to court on your court date.

disability for your hearing, contact the court before 
your court date. 

 

 

 

  S

TEP 1: Fill out the Certification in Objection to 

Wage Garnishment 
The Certification in Objection to Wage Garnishment 
tells the other side and the court why you are 
objecting to the wage garnishment or why you want 
a reduction in the wage garnishment. 

 S

STEP 2: Fill out the Wage Garnishment 
Worksheet (if applicable) 
You can use the Wage Garnishment Worksheet if 
you think that the amount you are being garnished is 
too much.  The maximum weekly garnishment is 
calculated as the lesser of: 

•  The amount by which disposable earnings 

exceed 30 times the federal minimum hourly 
wage (currently $7.25 an hour), or 

•  10 percent of disposable earnings (after 

federal, state, and local taxes and retirement 
contributions). 

The wage garnishment worksheet allows you to 
enter your gross salary and list your items that are 
exempt from (free from) wage garnishment, such as 
federal, state and local taxes, Social Security 
payments, State pension payments, payments from 
workers’ compensation, unemployment insurance, 
and public assistance or benefits, etc. to arrive at 
what you believe your garnishment should be. 

STEP 3: Fill out the Certification of Service 
The Certification of Service tells the court how you 
got the papers to the other party or parties and/or their 
attorneys and the date on which you did so. 

STEP 4: Where to file 
The objection paperwork must be mailed or 
delivered to the Office of the Special Civil Part in 
the county where the case was filed against you.  
The information should appear on your wage 
garnishment order.  There is no fee for filing any 
objection to a wage garnishment (execution) order.

Instructions for Completing the Certification in Objection to a Wage Garnishment  

1.  On the top left lines of the form, enter your name, address and daytime phone number.  Make sure to 
check the box if your address and/or phone number have changed since the initial filing.  You can 
use a P.O. Box if that is the address you use for mail. 

2.  On the upper left side of the form, labeled Plaintiff(s) and Defendant(s), enter the plaintiff’s and 
defendant’s names.  You can find this information in the wage garnishment papers you received. 

3.  On the line labeled County, enter the county where the case is filed. 

4.  On the line labeled Docket Number, enter the docket number of your case.  The forms you received 

will have the docket number on them. 

5.  In the section under, “I object to the wage garnishment because,” select the option(s) that best 

describes why are you objecting: 

•  Select the first option if you are not a defendant or judgment debtor in the case. 

•  Select the second option if you believe that you have more than one wage garnishment against 
you for the same job AND your wages are being garnished for both at the same time. 

Note: there can be more than one wage garnishment against you if you have multiple jobs (one 
wage garnishment per each job).  There can also be more than one wage garnishment against you 
if you have only one job and multiple judgments; but no more than one wage garnishment is 
allowed per job at the same time.  When the first wage garnishment has paid off one judgment 
completely, your employer must then apply the next wage garnishment to start paying off the 
next judgment. 

•  Select the third option if you believe that the amount being garnished is more than allowed by 

law.  (If you select this option, you must complete and attach the wage garnishment worksheet.)  
Your employer must apply the appropriate deductions to each of your paychecks.  Generally, the 
amount taken can be up to 10% of gross wages or 25% of net wages.  Using the wage 
garnishment worksheet can help you show the Court why you believe that the wrong amount is 
being garnished from your paycheck. 

•  Select the final option Other if none of the above options apply and/or if you have any other 
information that you want to provide to the Court to help it decide that the amount being 
garnished is incorrect, too much is being garnished or that no money should be garnished at all.  
Examples of reasons provided could be hardships, exempt income, or any other legal reason.  
Attach any supporting documentation that you believe the judge should see. 

Note: These instructions are not a full statement of all the law that applies. 

6.  Select whether you will need Interpreting services or ADA accommodations, and list the language 

and/or accommodation. 

7.  On the line above Date, clearly print or type the date on which you sign this form.  Sign your name 

on the line above Your Signature and clearly print or type your name on the line below your 
signature. 

Review all steps for completion before submitting your objection paperwork to the Court and all parties 
(or their attorneys) on your case.

How to Object to a Wage Garnishment in a Special Civil Part Case 

Instructions for Completing the Wage Garnishment Worksheet 
(Complete this form only if money is already being taken from your paycheck  
and you believe more is being taken than allowed by law) 

1.  For line #1, enter your gross salary in the box next to Gross pay per pay period.  Your gross income is your income 

before any deductions. 

2.  For line #2, list the legally required deductions on your paycheck (a. through i.): 

a.  Federal Income Tax - enter the amount taken out for federal income tax, sometimes marked as U.S. Income Tax, 

Federal Withholding, or Federal Tax. 

b.  Social Security (FICA or OASDI) - enter the amount taken out for Social Security, sometimes marked as SSA tax, 
OASDI (Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Income), FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) or Social 
Security. 

c.  Medicare - enter the amount taken out for Medicare benefits.  Typically, the amount appears as a Medicare 

deduction.  

d.  State Income Tax - enter the amount taken out for state taxes.  This deduction is allowed for any state taxes that 
are legally required to be taken out of your paycheck.  There may be situations where other states, such as 
Pennsylvania or New York, legally require withholding taxes from your pay.  You may claim these deductions. 

e.  Unemployment Insurance (SUI). 
f.  Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI). 
g.  Family Leave Insurance (FLI). 
h.  Workforce Development Fund/Supplemental Workforce (WFD/SWF) - enter the four other New Jersey payroll 
taxes.  These are the four legally required deductions or taxes from your pay under New Jersey law.  Some 
employers combine some or all of them.  A wide variety of abbreviations and markings are used from employer to 
employer.  This form gives you the ability to list the four taxes separately.  You can enter them in combination if 
that is how they appear on your paycheck. 

i.  Other (e.g. state pension, city tax) - enter the total of any other legally required payroll deductions.  Not all 
deductions from a paycheck are deductible for wage garnishment purposes.  Union dues, health insurance, 
pension loans and voluntary retirement plans are not deductions for calculating a wage garnishment.  However, a 
legally required pension plan, such as TPAF for teachers, is deductible.  Mandatory city payroll taxes, such as for 
New York City or Philadelphia, are also legally deductible. 

Note: if you are filling the form out online the following calculations will be done automatically. 

3.  For line #3, add the amounts you listed in line #2 (a-i), and enter the total in the box next to Total allowable 

deductions. 

4.  For line #4, subtract the Total allowable deductions (which is the amount in line #3) from your Gross pay per pay 
period (which is the amount you entered in line #1), and enter that amount in the box next to Net Pay.  This is your 
net pay under federal law. 

5.  For line #5, Exemption amount - select the box that represents how often you are paid and enter the corresponding 
amount in the line provided.  For example, if you are paid every 2 weeks, you would enter $435.00 in the space 
provided.  This amount cannot be garnished.  Beyond that amount, the garnishment is generally 25% of your net pay 
or 10% of your gross pay, whichever is less. 

6.  For line #6, multiply your Gross pay per pay period (which is the amount you entered in line #1) by 10% (.10) and 

enter that figure in the space provided. 

7.  For line #7, multiply your Net pay (which is amount in line #4) by 25% (.25) and enter that figure in the space 

provided. 

8.  For line #8, subtract your Exemption amount (the amount entered in line #5) from Net pay (the amount entered in line 

#4).  If zero or less, enter zero in the space provided.  If more than zero enter the figure. 

9.  For line #9, compare the amounts in lines #6, 7 and 8 and enter the figure that is the lowest out of these three.  That 

is the amount that may be lawfully deducted.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
