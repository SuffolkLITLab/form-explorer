Domestic Violence Economic Mediation Program 
FAQ’s for Non-Protected Party 

 

Q:  What is “economic mediation”? 
A:  Economic mediation is a means of resolving differences related to financial issues with the help of a 
trained, impartial third party.  A mediator does not represent either side and does not offer legal 
advice.  Parties are encouraged to retain an attorney to advise them of their rights during the 
mediation process, but if they do not have an attorney, they are allowed to have someone else 
accompany them to the mediation.  The mediator helps the parties identify the issues, gather the 
information they need to make informed decisions, and communicate so that they can find a solution 
agreeable to both.  Mediation is designed to facilitate settlements in an informal, non-adversarial 
manner.  The court maintains a roster of approved mediators that have mediation training as well as 
specialized domestic violence training. 

Q:  Is economic mediation available to parties in a divorce action where one party has an active 

Final Restraining Order against the other party? 

A:  The law prohibits any kind of mediation when there is an active Final Restraining Order.  The 

Judiciary established a Domestic Violence Economic Mediation Program to permit the referral of 
unresolved financial issues in a dissolution case. 

The court can only refer a case to economic mediation if the protected party consents to participate 
in the program. 

Q:  If the protected party files a request for to amend the Final Restraining order to permit what 

can I expect to happen in court? 

A:  The protected party’s request that the court refer the financial issues in your case to economic 

mediation and that the Final Restraining Order be amended to permit economic mediation does not 
guarantee that the court will refer your case to the program. 

After reviewing the request and making sure the protected party understands what economic 
mediation is, the court will give you the opportunity to explain whether you would like to proceed to 
economic mediation.  If you agree to proceed with economic mediation, the court will enter an order 
amending the Final Restraining Order to permit participation under the terms of the Domestic 
Violence Economic Mediation Program. 

If you object to economic mediation, you will be asked to state your objection.  The court will then 
decide whether the case is referred to economic mediation.  The court can still refer the case to 
economic mediation over your objection. 

If the court refers your case to economic mediation, you and the other party will be asked to agree 
upon a mediator.  If you are unable to agree on a particular mediator, the court will assign one to 
your case.  The court will then enter an order referring the case to economic mediation. 

Q:  What happens if the case is not referred to economic mediation? 
A:  If the case is not referred by the court to economic mediation, the case will proceed as it would 

normally, with the court setting a date for the next event, which can be either an intensive settlement 
conference or a trial.  At the trial, both parties will have to present their testimony, witnesses and

evidence so that the court can make decisions regarding the economic and other possible unresolved 
issues that are part of the divorce action. 

Q:  What does it mean to amend the Final Restraining Order to allow economic mediation? 
A:  If the court grants the protected party’s request to allow economic mediation, the Final Restraining 
Order will be amended to allow economic mediation.  All other provisions of the Final Restraining 
Order will remain in place.  Any contact by you with the protected party remains a violation of the 
Final Restraining Order. 

Q:  If the protected party does not request to participate in economic mediation but the non-

protected party wants to participate, can economic mediation occur? 

A:  No.  Under the terms of this Domestic Violence Economic Mediation Program, the non-protected 
party in the Final Restraining Order cannot request that the case proceed to economic mediation.  
The protected party in the Final Restraining Order is the only party that can request that the court 
refer the financial issues to economic mediation. 

Q:  If the unresolved financial issues proceed to economic mediation how and where does the 

mediation occur? 

A:  Economic mediation will only take place at the courthouse where trained sheriff’s officers are 

available.  Economic mediation is prohibited from taking place at the mediator’s office or at any 
other location. 

The mediator assigned to your case will use “shuttle” diplomacy to facilitate the mediation.  This 
means that you will be in one room and the other party will be in another room.  This prevents any 
direct communication from occurring.  Additionally, if the county courthouse you are in has the 
technology available, mediation can take place with the assistance of video conferencing. 

Under this program, only those mediators who have completed specific domestic violence training 
will be eligible to be chosen as a mediator for your case. 

Q:  What if court enters an order referring the dissolution matter to economic mediation, but the 

protected party changes their mind and does not want to attend? 

A:  The Domestic Violence Economic Mediation Program permits the protected party to end the 

mediation at any time. 

Q:  Is anyone responsible for paying the economic mediator? 
A.  The first two hours of mediation are free.  These two hours include the time it takes for a mediator to 
prepare for the actual mediation as well as a mediation session.  Travel time is not included in the 
first two hours and mediators are not allowed to charge for their travel. 

During the mediation, the mediator will let you know when the two free hours have been reached.  
Either party can then choose to terminate mediation. 

If the mediation goes beyond the free two hours, the court will decide how much each party will 
have in paying the mediator. 

Q:  Can the mediator also address other issues like custody and parenting time? 
A:  No, by the law and the terms of this Domestic Violence Economic Mediation Program, the only 

issues that can be discussed at mediation are financial issues.
