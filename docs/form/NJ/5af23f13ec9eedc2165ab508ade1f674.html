A victim of nonconsensual sexual contact, sexual penetration, or lewdness, (see definitions on 
page 3) or any attempt at such conduct, and who does not meet the definition of a “domestic 
violence victim” in the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act (PDVA).  
•  A victim's parent or guardian may file on behalf of the victim in any case in which the 

o  is less than 18 years of age; or  
o  has a developmental disability or a mental disease or defect that renders the victim 
temporarily or permanently incapable of understanding the nature of the victim’s 
conduct, including, but not limited to, being incapable of providing consent 

Do NOT use this packet if: 
•  You meet the definition of a “victim” under the PDVA - N.J.S.A. 2C:25-19 (d)(a) which is 

victim:

NOTE:  If  you  are  a  victim  of  domestic  violence  and  want  to  file  for  a  domestic  violence 
restraining order, please contact your local law enforcement agency. 

  If you are filing on behalf of a minor child and the person you are filing against is a parent or 
guardian of the minor child, you cannot file under the Sexual Assault Survivor Protection 
Act. You must call the Division of Permanency and Protection at: 1-877 NJ ABUSE (1-877-

Try to Get a Lawyer 

Things to Think About Before You Represent Yourself in Court 

The law, the proofs necessary to present your case, and the procedural rules governing cases in 
the Family Division are complex.  It is recommended that you make every effort to obtain the 
assistance of a lawyer.  If you cannot afford a lawyer, you may contact the legal services 
program in your county to see if you qualify for free legal services.  Their telephone number 
can be found online under “Legal Aid” or “Legal Services.” 

If you do not qualify for free legal services and need help in locating an attorney, you can 
contact the bar association in your county.  The telephone number can also be found in your 
local yellow pages.  Most county bar associations have a Lawyer Referral Service. 

The County Bar Lawyer Referral Service can supply you with the names of attorneys in your 
area willing to handle your particular type of case and will sometimes consult with you at a 
reduced fee. 

There are a variety of organizations of minority lawyers throughout New Jersey, as well as 
organizations of lawyers who handle specialized types of cases.  Ask the Family court staff in 
your county for a list of lawyer referral services that include these organizations. 
What You Should Expect If You Represent Yourself 

While you have the right to represent yourself in court, you should not expect special treatment, 
help or attention from the court.  The following is a list of some things court staff can and 
cannot do for you.  Please read it carefully before asking court staff for help. 

•  We can explain and answer questions about how the court works. 
•  We can tell you what the requirements are to have your case considered by the court. 
•  We can give you some information from your case file. 
•  We can provide you with samples of court forms that are available. 
•  We can provide you with guidance on how to fill out forms. 
•  We can usually answer questions about court deadlines. 

•  We cannot give you legal advice.  Only your lawyer can give you legal advice. 
•  We cannot tell you whether or not you should bring your case to court. 
•  We cannot give you an opinion about what will happen if you bring your case to court. 
•  We cannot recommend a lawyer, but we can provide you with the telephone number of a 

local lawyer referral service. 

•  We cannot not talk to the judge for you about what will happen in your case. 
•  We cannot let you talk to the judge outside of court. 
•  We cannot change an order issued by a judge 

Keep Copies of All Papers 
Make and keep copies for yourself, written agreements, Case Information Statements, and other

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
