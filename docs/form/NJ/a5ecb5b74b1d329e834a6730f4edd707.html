How to Ask the Court to Dismiss a Final Restraining Order 
Superior Court of New Jersey - Chancery Division - Family Part 

 

Who Should Use This Packet? 
You can use this packet if you are the defendant on a final restraining order and you want to have that order dismissed.  In 
New Jersey, a defendant asking to have a final restraining order dismissed must satisfy a two-part test established by the 
Appellate Division. 

Use this packet if you can meet the requirements of the Appellate Division conditions, which are: 
1.  Show there is “good cause” to dismiss the restraining order by meeting the 11 factors listed in Carfagno v. 

Carfagno, 288 N.J. Super. 424 (Ch. Div. 1995).  The eleven factors that should be considered in whether a defendant 
has demonstrated “good cause” for dismissing the FRO are: 

(1)  The victim’s consent; 
(2)  Whether the victim fears the defendant; 
(3)  Current relationship between the parties; 
(4)  Number of contempt convictions; 
(5)  Defendant’s use of drugs or abuse of alcohol; 
(6)  Whether the defendant is violent with others; 
(7)  Whether the defendant has attended counseling; 
(8)  Age and health of the defendant; 
(9)  Whether the plaintiff is acting in good faith in opposing the defendant’s request to dissolve the final 

restraining order; 

(10)  Whether there are any other restraining orders against the defendant; and 
(11)  Any other relevant consideration regarding the potential for dismissal. 

2.  Show that there is a substantial change of circumstances, since the time the order was granted.  Your motion 
application will be scheduled before the same judge who entered the final restraining order if they are still in the 
Family Division. 

If the judge who entered your final restraining order is no longer in the Family Division, you will need to provide the 
transcript of the proceeding so the court can understand the original basis for the restraining order (see Kanaszka v. 
Kunen, 313 N.J. Super 600 (App. Div., 1998) for more information and N.J.S.A. 2C:25-29(d)).  You can call the 
family court and ask if the judge is still in the Family division.  Once you have this information, you will need to 
order the transcript through the court.  You must know the date of your hearing when making your transcript request.   
Once the transcript is obtained, motion papers along with the transcript may be submitted to the Court and a court date 
will be set. 

You can also use this packet if you want to respond to a Motion to Dismiss a FRO.  Use the Certification in Response to 
Defendant’s Motion for Dismissal of a Final Restraining Order (Form E). 

Do NOT use this packet if you have not met the criteria above. 

Note: These materials have been prepared by the New Jersey Administrative Office of the Courts for use by self-represented 
litigants.  The guides, instructions, and forms will be periodically updated as necessary to reflect current New Jersey statutes and 
court rules.  The most recent version of the forms will be available at the county courthouse or on the Judiciary’s Internet site 
njcourts.gov.  However, you are ultimately responsible for the content of your court papers. 

Completed forms are to be submitted to the Family Court that issued the order or last heard your case.  A list of Family Court 
addresses can be found on njcourts.gov.

Keep Copies of All Papers 
Make and keep copies for yourself of any signed 
orders, written agreements, Judgments of Divorce, 
Case Information Statements, and other important 
papers that relate to your case. 
 

ry to Get a Lawyer 
The law, the proofs necessary to present your case, 
and the procedural rules governing cases in the 
Family Division are complicated.  It is 
recommended that you make every effort to obtain 
the assistance of a lawyer.  If you cannot afford a 
lawyer, you may contact the legal services program 
in your county to see if you qualify for free legal 
services.  Their telephone number can be found 
online under “Legal Aid” or “Legal Services.” 

If you do not qualify for free legal services and need 
help in locating an attorney, you can contact the bar 
association in your county.  Most county bar 
associations have a Lawyer Referral Service. 

The county bar association Lawyer Referral Service 
can supply you with the names of attorneys in your 
area willing to handle your particular type of case 
and sometimes consult with you for a reduced fee. 

There are a variety of organizations of minority 
lawyers throughout New Jersey, as well as 
organizations of lawyers who handle specialized 
types of cases.  Ask the Family court staff in your 
county for a list of lawyer referral services that 
include these organizations. 

What You Should Expect If You Represent 
Yourself 
While you have the right to represent yourself in 
court, you should not expect special treatment, help 
or attention from the court.  The following is a list 
of some things court staff can and cannot do for 
you.  Please read it carefully before asking court 
staff for help.

printed clearly on 8 ½ “x 11” white paper only.  Forms cannot be filed on a different size or color paper.  Use only the forms included 
in this packet.  Be sure to keep a copy for your records. 

Steps to File for a Court Review and Decision 

STEP 1: Fill out the Notice of Motion for 
Dismissal of a Final Restraining Order by 
Defendant (Form A) 
The Notice of Motion for Dismissal of a Final 
Restraining Order by Defendant tells the court and 
the other person in the case the things you want the 
court to do.  It also tells the other person and the 
court the date the motion will be heard. 

STEP 2: Fill out the Certification in Support of a 
Motion to Dismiss a Final Restraining Order 
(Form B) 
The Certification in Support of a Motion to Dismiss 
a Final Restraining Order, should explain the 
specific reasons why you think the court should 
dismiss your final restraining order.  The reasons 
you give to the court must be based on the facts. 

You must include with your completed Certification 
form a copy of all previous orders.  You should 
also attach copies of any other papers that will 
prove that the things you say in your Certification 
are true. 

STEP 3: Fill out the Notice to Plaintiff (Form C) 
The Notice to Plaintiff lets the other party know 
how to respond to your Notice of Motion for 
Dismissal.  This form gives the other party or the 
other party’s lawyer important instructions.  Your 
motion could be dismissed if your motion papers do 
not include the Notice to Plaintiff. 

STEP 4: Fill out the Cover Letter (Form D) 
Complete the form letter addressed to the Clerk of 
the Superior Court, Attn: Family Division Manager 
(make sure to indicate the county on the address 
line).  There is no fee to file this motion.  This

papers that you file with the court.  You must 
also include a stamped, return envelope addressed 
to yourself. 

STEP 5: Check your completed forms and make 
copies. 
Check your forms and make sure they are complete.  
Remove all instruction sheets before submitting to 
the court.  Make sure you have signed the forms 
wherever necessary.  Make three copies of the 
entire packet of the completed forms.  The original 
will be filed with the court, a copy is for the court to 
send to the plaintiff, and a copy is for your records. 

Checklist - Make sure you have all the following 
items and that they are in this order: 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 

Cover Letter (Form D).  This form must be 
the first paper in your packet of papers that 
you file with the court. 
Notice of Motion for Dismissal of a Final 
Restraining Order by Defendant (Form A). 
Certification in Support of a Motion to 
Dismiss a Final Restraining Order (Form B). 
Transcript of proceeding (if applicable).

A stamped return envelope addressed to 
yourself. 
Any papers to support your motion,

STEP 6: Mail or deliver your package of 
completed papers to the court 
If the plaintiff in the case has an attorney, mail or 
deliver copies of all letters, motions, certifications, 
orders or other papers to the plaintiff’s attorney.  If 
the plaintiff does not have a lawyer, you must 
provide the court with an additional copy of all 
your forms and paperwork, along with a postage 
paid envelope so the court can forward them to the 
plaintiff.  You may not mail anything directly to 
the plaintiff or you may be in violation of your 
restraining order.

How to Ask the Court to Dismiss a Final Restraining Order 
There are two ways in which you can submit your 
documents to the court: 

1.  Judiciary Electronic Document Submission 
(JEDS) system - Self-represented litigants 
and/or attorneys can use this system for the 
submission of documents related to new or 
existing cases.  Click on the following link for 
more information about the JEDS system 
(including FAQs) and how to register to use the 
system: njcourts.gov 

OR 

 

2.  By Mail - Self-represented litigants may send 
completed forms to the family court in the 
county that issued the order you are trying to 
change or that last heard your case.  You will 
find all family court addresses at njcourts.gov. 

If you are mailing the papers to the court, it is 
suggested that you use regular and certified mail 
with return receipt requested.  This will provide 
you with a post office receipt and green card.  
Your post office can tell you how to send 
certified mail with return receipt requested.  
Because you cannot have contact with the 
plaintiff, you cannot mail the forms directly to 
the plaintiff.  The court will send your motion 
to the plaintiff. 

Keep Copies for Yourself 
You should make and keep copies of all forms and 
documents related to your case for your personal 
records.
