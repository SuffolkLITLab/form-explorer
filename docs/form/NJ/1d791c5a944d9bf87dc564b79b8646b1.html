CEP hearing overview
A Comprehensive Enforcement Program (CEP) 
hearing gives people who have not met their 
court-ordered financial obligations or community 
service requirements a chance to establish 
a reasonable plan to meet their conditions. 
CEP can assist clients by making job and/or 
educational referrals, reducing non-mandatory 
penalties and assigning credit for drug 
enforcement and demand reduction penalties.

What is the role of probation?
Probation is responsible for monitoring payments 
and community service requirements on court-
ordered obligations to ensure cooperation. 
Probation and non-probation cases involving 
the collection of money or community service 
requirements that have not been resolved could 
be transferred to CEP. Probation officers can help 
you make payment arrangements prior to your 
CEP hearing.

Why did I receive a CEP summons?
If you received a CEP summons, you have fallen 
behind in meeting your existing court-ordered 
obligations. These obligations could include 
the payment of fines, fees, restitution or the 
performance of community service. 

What if I receive a summons for CEP 
but I am not behind on my payments?
If you receive a summons and believe your 
payments or community service hours are 
current, immediately contact the probation 
officer listed on your court notice.  If your 
appearance is not excused by probation services 
before your scheduled hearing, you must appear 
on the scheduled court date. 

What to expect at a CEP hearing
You will have the opportunity to explain any 
change in your circumstances that might affect 
your ability to pay or to perform community 
service. A hearing officer will conduct  
the proceeding.

What is the role of a hearing officer?
Hearing officers are court employees who review 
facts and evidence and then make appropriate 
recommendations that could include payment 
plan adjustments.

Do I need an attorney to represent me  
at the hearing?
You can choose to be represented by an attorney, 
but it is not required. If you need help finding an 
attorney, you can contact your local county bar 
association’s lawyer referral service. You also can 
visit the New Jersey State Bar Association website 
for information on lawyer referral services.

Your rights at the hearing
Your rights include, but are not limited to:

•  The opportunity to be heard. 
•  The right to a private hearing to discuss  

a sensitive matter (upon request).

•  The right to bypass a hearing before the 
hearing officer and request a Superior 
Court judge conduct the proceeding. 

•  The right to an attorney at any time 

during the hearing. 

•  The right to an appeal of the hearing 

officer’s recommendation.

What should I bring to a CEP hearing?
Bring any documentation that will help to establish 
your current ability to cooperate and that will help 
the hearing officer understand why you are behind 
with court-ordered obligations. 
This could include, but is not limited to:

•  Medical information such as 

hospitalization, diagnosis, prognosis and 
physical limitations.

•  Pay stubs, government benefit reward. 
•  Letters, disability status.
•  Bankruptcy fillings/status. 
•  Government benefit denial letters or 

other financial obligations.

What can a hearing officer recommend? 
Hearing officer recommendations could include, 
but are not limited to: 

•  Payment plan adjustments. 
•  Job searches or educational referrals. 
•  Wage garnishment. 
• 
Increased reporting. 
•  Civil judgment/lien.  
•  Relisted court date for cooperation.  
•  Referral to a Superior Court judge.

If an agreement is reached, the hearing 
officer’s recommendation will be sent 
to a Superior Court judge for approval, 
modification or denial. Once the judge signs 
the recommendation, the agreement becomes 
an official court order to which you will be 
bound. You will receive a copy of the court 
order, which will contain the details of  
the hearing.

What happens if I do not appear for a 
CEP hearing?
A bench warrant could be issued for your 
arrest. A default order could be issued for 
further sanctions, such as: 

•  Suspension of your driver’s 

license. 

•  A civil judgment filed against you.
•  A lien against your personal 

• 

property.
Income withholding, wages 
withholding or garnishment.
•  A tax offset that garnishes your 

state tax return. 

Who can I talk to about my case?
To discuss your case or make payment 
arrangements, contact the person named on 
your summons notice or your local  
probation office. 

If you are not on probation, but still owe 
money, you can speak to the contact person 
on your CEP notice or contact your local 
probation office. Local contact numbers are 
listed on the adjacent panel of this brochure.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
