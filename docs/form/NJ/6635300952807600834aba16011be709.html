General Considerations: 
A. Goals 
 
The  goals  of  the  Supreme  Court  Guidelines  on  Electronic  Devices  in  the 
Courts (“guidelines”) are  

to provide public access to the courts while ensuring fairness to litigants;  
to acknowledge the existence of new technology and to permit its  use in 

and around a courthouse, subject to restrictions; 

to avoid delay or interference in court proceedings and  to maintain appro-

• 
priate courtroom decorum. 

. Rationale 

 B

Advances in technology have provided not only traditional journalists but also 
members of the general public with access to a variety of easily portable elec-
tronic  devices  that  can  be  used  to  capture  news,  photographs  and/or  video. 
Gone are the days of notebooks and sketchbooks used by reporters and court-
room artists. Those tools have been replaced with smart phones and computer 
tablets which, together with new forms of media outlets, have changed the con-
cept of who is a journalist. Courts should not, in administering guidelines regu-
lating  the  use  of  electronic  devices in  and  around  courthouses,  be  required  to 
determine who qualifies as a journalist. Rather, courts should focus on the uses 
to  which  such  devices  are  put.  The  pervasiveness  of  new  electronic  devices, 
and  their  availability  to  traditional  journalists,  bloggers,  new  age  journalists 
and the  general public, requires courts to implement  guidelines  governing the 
use of electronic devices in and around a courthouse, so that their use does not 
compromise fairness to litigants, efficiency in court proceedings and/or appro-
priate courtroom decorum.  

. Applicability  

 C

These  guidelines apply  to  proceedings in the  Supreme  Court,  Appellate  Divi-
sion, Superior Court, Tax Court and Municipal Court. Whenever these guide-
lines refer to a decision to be made by “the court,” such decision shall be made 
by  the  chief  justice  or  the  Supreme  Court  clerk  for  matters  in  the  Supreme 
Court; by the presiding judge for administration or the Appellate Division clerk 
for matters in the Appellate Division; by the assignment judge for the vicinage 
where the court facility is located or by a judge designated by the assignment 
judge  for  matters  in  Superior  Court;  by  the  presiding  judge  of  the  Tax  Court 
for matters in the Tax Court; and by the presiding judge or a judge designated 
by the presiding judge for municipal court matters.  

ection I. Possession and Use of Electronic Devices  

As utilized in these guidelines, the term “electronic device” means any device, 
including  any  portable  device,  that  has  the  capability  to  transmit,  broadcast, 
record  and/or  take  photographs and  also  includes any  other  similar  electronic 
devices  whether  now  in  existence  or  later  developed  (hereinafter “electronic 
device”).  
As utilized in these guidelines, the term “electronically record” means the au-
dio  and/or  video  recording  of  events  by  means  of  an  electronic  device 
(hereinafter  “electronically  record”  and/or  “electronically  recording”  and/or 
“electronic recording (s)).”

. Courthouse Grounds, Environs and Ceremonies 

 

Except as otherwise provided in these guidelines, the use of electronic devices 
for  any  purpose,  including  photography,  electronic  recording,  broadcasting 
and/or transmitting, on the grounds outside the courthouse shall be permitted. 
However, individuals are cautioned to seek appropriate approval from facility 
security  authorities  and/or  the  owner  of  such  facility  before  doing  so  includ-
ing, but not limited to, the county sheriff’s department.  
In cooperation with appropriate facility security authorities, the court will take 
appropriate measures to ensure that the entrances and exits to the courthouse 
are kept clear in order that all participants in proceedings may enter and leave 
the courthouse safely and without undue interference.  
Permission  for  all  audio  and  visual  coverage  of  ceremonial  proceedings  in-
volving the Judiciary must first be obtained from the court subject to compli-
ance with these guidelines.   

.  Common Areas of the Courthouse 

While in common areas of a  courthouse, all persons are permitted to possess 
and  use  an  electronic  device  for  any  purpose  other  than  to  take  photographs, 
electronically record and/or broadcast. Such permitted use is subject to further 
reasonable  restrictions  by  the  court  and/or  facility  security  authorities  and/or 
facility owners, on the time, place and manner of such use that are appropriate 
to maintain safety, decorum and order. 
A  “Requestor,”  as  that  term  is  defined  in  Section  I(C)(2)(a)  infra,  who  has 
obtained  the  required  court  permission  to  photograph,  electronically  record, 
broadcast and/or transmit a court proceeding, is permitted to use an electronic 
device  to  photograph,  electronically  record,  broadcast  and/or  transmit  photo-
graphs, video and/or audio of persons in the common areas of the courthouse, 
provided that any person that the requestor seeks to photograph, electronically 
record,  broadcast  and/or  transmit,  (1)  is  involved  in  the  court  proceeding  for 
which the requestor has obtained court permission to photograph, electronical-
ly  record,  broadcast  and/or  transmit,  (2)  is  a  person  whose  photograph,  elec-
tronic recording, broadcast and/or transmission is not otherwise prohibited by 
these  guidelines  or  by  court  order,  and  (3)  consents  to  being  photographed, 
electronically  recorded,  broadcasted  and/or  transmitted  when  in  the  common 
areas  of  the  courthouse.  Any  violation  of  these  guidelines  may  be  addressed 
by the judge presiding over the proceeding for which the requestor obtained or 
failed to obtain permission to photograph, electronically record, broadcast and/
or transmit. 

. Inside the Courtroom 

(1)  Agreement for the Use of Electronic Devices 

a)  Agreement  Required  Before  Use  of  Electronic  Device  in  Courtroom.  
Before  a  person  may operate an electronic device in a  courtroom,  the person 
must  execute  an  agreement  for  the  Use  of  Electronic  Devices  ("agreement") 
and  submit  the  executed  agreement  to  the  trial  court  administrator  or  his/her 

 A

designee, if in the Superior Court law or chancery division, Municipal Court or 
Tax Court, or to the clerk of the court, if in the Appellate Division or Supreme 
Court,  to  be  dated  and  filed.  A  form  of  such  agreement  is  attached  to  these 
guidelines as Exhibit A.  

 

b) Obtaining and Submitting an Agreement.   This agreement shall be ac-
cessible  on  the  Judiciary  website,  njcourts.com.  An  executed  agreement  may 
be submitted electronically to the trial court administrator or his/her designee, 
if  in  the  Superior  Court  law  or  chancery  division,  Municipal  Court  or  Tax 
Court,  or  to  the  clerk  of  the  court,  if  in  the  Appellate  Division  or  Supreme 
Court.  The  appropriate  email  addresses  shall  be  accessible  on  the  Judiciary 
website. An executed agreement may also be submitted via mail or hand deliv-
ery to either the trial court administrator or clerk of the court, or their designee. 
A copy of the executed agreement signed and dated by the trial court adminis-
trator or the clerk of the court, or their designee, or evidence of same, shall be 
returned to the person and shall be in the possession of  the person at all times 
when  in  the  courtroom  and  shall  on  request  of  the  court  be  produced  to  the 
court  for  examination.  Displaying  a  copy  of  the  filed  agreement,  or  evidence 
of same, upon an electronic device shall satisfy this requirement, provided that 
such electronic device is capable of transmitting a copy of such agreement via 
email to the court upon request.  

c) Duration of Agreement.  The agreement shall be valid for a one-year peri-
od from the date of filing, provided all information set forth on the agreement 
shall remain complete and accurate during that period.  

d)  Permitted  Uses  Upon  Execution  and  Filing  of  Agreement.    A  person 
with  a  valid  agreement  may  use  an  electronic  device  inside  a  courtroom  to 
silently  take  notes  and/or  transcribe  and  receive  communications  and  infor-
mation,  without  obtaining  prior  authorization  from  the  court.   The court  may 
prohibit or further restrict use of electronic devices used to transcribe, transmit 
and  receive  communications  and  information,  if  such  use  interferes  with  the 
administration of justice, poses a threat  to safety or security, or compromises 
the integrity of the proceedings.  

e) Violation of Agreement.  Violation of the agreement shall subject the per-
son  to  such  sanctions  as  the  court  may  deem  appropriate  including,  but  not 
limited to, contempt of court.  

2) Request  for  Permission  to Photograph,  Electronically Record,  Broad-

cast and/or Transmit a Proceeding               

a) Permission required. A person desiring to photograph, electronically rec-
ord,  broadcast  and/or  transmit  a  court  proceeding  ("requestor")  shall  request 
permission  from the court to do so (“request”) after signing and submitting an 
agreement.  

b) Form of Request.  The request shall be in writing unless time constraints 
render  it  impracticable  to  do so  and,  in such  case,  the  court  may  entertain  an 
oral  request. The  request  shall  provide  the  following  information:  the  date  of 

 (

the  requestor's  agreement  for  the  use  of  electronic  devices;  the  matter  to  be 
covered  and  whether  permission  is  sought  for  a  specific  proceeding  or  for  all 
court proceedings open to the public in a given matter until it is concluded; and 
an agreement by the requestor to provide pooling capabilities. A form of such a 
request is attached to these guidelines as Exhibit B.  

 

c) Obtaining and Submitting a Request Form  The request shall be accessi-
ble  on  the  Judiciary  website,  njcourts.com.  A  completed  request  may  be  sub-
mitted electronically to the court, provided that the court accepts such electron-
ic  transmissions.  Otherwise,  the  request  may  be  submitted  via  mail  or  hand 
delivery.  A  requestor  should  ascertain  from  chambers  a  judge’s  preferred 
method of submission of the request. 

d) Time of Request.  The request shall be presented to the court within a rea-
sonable time prior to the commencement of the proceeding to permit the court 
adequate time to consider the request. Requests relating to a proceeding in pro-
gress shall be considered at the discretion of the court.  

e)  Consent  of  Parties  Not  Required.    Permission  to  electronically  record, 
broadcast, photograph and/or transmit public court proceedings using an elec-
tronic device shall not be conditioned upon obtaining consent of any party, any 
party’s  attorney,  or  any  witness  or  participant  in  a  proceeding.  Although  the 
consent of parties is not required, the court may, in its discretion, consider the 
views  of  such  participants  regarding  the  permission  granted  and  any  re-
strictions on same. 

f)    Decision  of  Court.    The  court  shall  decide  whether  to  grant  permission 
within 24 hours of the request or as soon as practicable, giving due considera-
tion to the number of requests, the timeliness thereof, and the requestor's need 
for  timely  access  to  the  proceeding.    The  court  shall  specify  whether  permis-
sion is granted for a specific proceeding or for all court proceedings open to the 
public in a given matter until it is concluded.  The court retains the discretion 
to modify or rescind such permission in the event that circumstances relating to 
the proceeding warrant such measures.  

 

(3)  Pro Hac Vice Attorneys  
Any attorney applying for admission pro hac vice, pursuant to R.1:21-2 in any 
matter that is pending, and desiring permission to use an electronic device in-
side a courtroom as set forth in Section I(C)(1), supra, in any court proceeding, 
in addition to the requirements set forth in R.1:21-2(b), shall execute an agree-
ment, which agreement shall be valid so long as any order granting the applica-
tion to speak pro hac vice shall be effective.   

4) Exception 
An agreement for the use of electronic devices and/or a request for permission 
to photograph, electronically record, broadcast and/or transmit a proceeding, as 
set  forth  in  this  section,  shall  not  be  required  in  the  case  of  adoptive  parents 
and  other  family  members  present  at  final  hearings  in  uncontested  adoption 
cases, provided that the judge presiding over that hearing grants those individ-

uals permission to photograph, electronically record, broadcast and/or transmit 
the hearing. 

 

ection II. Exclusions 

Photography, electronic recording, broadcasting and/or transmitting is prohib-
ited at any proceeding closed by court order, statute or Rule of Court. Attached 
hereto  as  Appendix  II  is  a  reference  to  New  Jersey  Rules  of  Court  and  New 
Jersey statutes that relate to the sealing of court proceedings and records. The 
appendix is  merely  a  guide  and  is  not  intended  to  be  an  exhaustive  list  of  all 
potentially relevant Rules of Court and statutes.    

ection III. Restrictions 

The following restrictions apply to any requestor granted permission to photo-
graph, electronically record, broadcast and/or transmit: 

 S

 S

 

◼Photographs,  electronic  recordings,  broadcasts  and/or  transmissions  of  vic-
tims of crime under 18 years of age at the time of trial and of witnesses under 
14 years of age at the time of trial shall be allowed only at the discretion of the 
court. 
◼While  photographs,  electronic  recordings,  broadcasts  and/or  transmissions 
are  prohibited  at  juvenile  proceedings,  photographs,  electronic  recordings, 
broadcasts and/or transmissions of defendants 17 years of age who are charged 
with motor vehicle violations that are heard in municipal court are permissible. 
◼There  shall  be  no  electronic  recordings,  broadcasts  and/or  transmissions  of 
conferences  between  an  attorney  and  client  or  between  co-counsel of a  client 
that occur in a courtroom or anywhere in a court facility.  Still photographs and 
silent video are permitted.  
◼There  shall  be  no  electronic  recordings,  broadcasts  and/or  transmissions  of 
side-bar conferences between the court and counsel.  Still photographs are per-
mitted. 
◼There shall be no photographs, electronic recordings or broadcasts of a jury, 
any individual juror or any other person that would permit the identification of 
any juror. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the photographing, electron-
ic recording, broadcasting and/or transmission of any juror who has been dis-
charged  from  jury  service  in  any  proceeding  unless  otherwise  ordered  by  a 
court.  

ection IV. Judicial Discretion 

 S

A. Fair Proceeding. The court retains discretion to impose such restrictions on 
the use of electronic devices necessary to implement the goals of these guide-
lines. Photographs, electronic recordings, broadcasts and/or transmissions may 
be  excluded  in  any  proceeding  where  the  court  determines  such  uses  would 
cause a substantial increase in the threat of, or the potential for, harm to a liti-
gant,  juror,  witness,  or  any  other  participant  in  the  case  or  would  otherwise 
unduly interfere with the integrity of the  proceeding. In determining whether 
such  substantial  increase  in  the  threat  of,  or  the  potential  for,  harm  exists,  a 
court  may  appropriately  consider  the  potential  for  intimidation  of  witnesses, 
victims and others when exercising its discretion in deciding whether to grant 

7 

or  deny  permission  to  photograph,  electronically  record,  broadcast  and/or 
transmit a proceeding.  

 

.  Order  to  Exclude  or  Vary  Coverage  Previously  Permitted.  The  court, 
may,  upon  reasonable  notice  with  an  opportunity  for  the  requestor  and  any 
other affected person(s) to be heard, terminate, limit, or otherwise  modify the 
conditions of the taking of photographs, electronic recordings, broadcasts and/
or transmissions permitted in any proceeding or trial. 

ection V. Pretrial Conference 

The court may, at its discretion, require a requestor to attend a pretrial confer-
ence prior to the court making a decision on a request to photograph, electroni-
cally record, broadcast and/or transmit a court proceeding or trial. The purpose 
of  such  pretrial  conference  is  limited  to  decisions  on  electronic  video/audio 
recording or still photography and not to substantive matters unrelated to these 
guidelines.  Any  such  required  pretrial  conference  shall  include  the  court,  the 
attorneys  for  the  litigants,  requestor(s)  and/or  their  attorneys,  and  any  other 
persons  identified  as  necessary  by  the  court,  with  all  matters  discussed  to  be 
consistent with these guidelines.   
At  such  pretrial  conference,  the  court  shall  review  with  all  present  the  provi-
sions  of  these  guidelines.  Any  objections  to  photographing,  electronically  re-
cording, broadcasting and/or transmitting in the particular matter shall be con-
sidered  at  this  conference.  The  court  shall  consult  with  the  requestors  and/or 
their attorneys before imposing any special limitations or restrictions on photo-
graphing, electronically recording, broadcasting and/or transmitting in the par-
ticular matter.  
No formal pretrial order is required. However, the court, subsequent to the pre-
trial  conference,  shall  reduce  to  writing  or  make  a  record  of  the  decisions 
reached  at  the  pretrial  conference,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  any  and  all 
limitations or restrictions imposed. 

ection VI. Appellate Review 

Any  requestor  aggrieved  by  any  decision  concerning  photographs,  electronic 
recordings, broadcasts and/or transmissions may  move for leave to appeal the 
decision  to  the  Appellate  Division,  where  the  decision  was  by  the Superior 
Court  law  or  chancery  division,  Municipal  Court  or  Tax  Court,  or  to  the  Su-
preme Court, where the decision was by the Appellate Division. Such motions 
shall be made promptly after any such decision.  

ection VII.  

Nothing  contained  in  these  guidelines  shall  be  deemed  to  create  any  right  of 
privacy not already existing in law.  

ection VIII. General Requirements 

Attached hereto as Appendix I and made part hereof are general requirements 
and responsibilities for requestors seeking to photograph, electronically record, 
broadcast and/or transmit specific court proceedings. 

 B

 S

 S

 S

 S

   

8 

1) Prior Permission Required. Any individual seeking to photograph, elec-
tronically record, broadcast and/or transmit a specific court proceeding or trial 
must make a specific request to the court in advance for permission to do so.  

2) Electronic Recordings. If no technologically suitable electronic recording 
system  exists in the  particular  court  facility,  or  if  the  particular  electronic  de-
vice  does  not  contain  its  own  electronic  recording  system,  any  microphones, 
cameras and related wiring shall be unobtrusive and shall be located in places 
designated in advance of any proceeding by the court. Any individual seeking 
to use any other technology to record sound or video for broadcast shall make a 
specific request to the court in advance for permission to do so.  

3) Electronic Recordings Inadmissible.   No electronic recording, broadcast 
and/or  transmission  shall  be  admissible  as evidence  or  used  in any  court  pro-
ceeding for any purpose including, but not limited to, a challenge to the accura-
cy of the official court record. The electronic recording may not be represented 
as an official transcript in any manner and/or for any purpose.  

4)  Pooling  Capability  Requirements.  Any  person  who  obtains  permission 
from the court  to photograph, electronically record,  broadcast and/or transmit 
proceedings shall  provide  pooling  capabilities so  that  others  may  share  in the 
coverage. Pooling requires, at a minimum, that the pooling supplier have avail-
able capabilities to pool by providing multiple electronic connections for other 
media representatives desiring participation by the  use of their own recording 
equipment  or  by  direct-line  hook-up.  Any  individual  who  has  obtained  court 
permission to cover proceedings shall pool his/her video/audio signals or pho-
tographs at the request of others without requiring said others to obtain further 
court approval.  

5) Pooling Arrangements. Participating users of electronic devices and par-
ticipating still photographers are to make their own pooling arrangements, in-
cluding the establishment of necessary procedures, the provision of appropriate 
pooling  equipment  as  described  in  these  guidelines,  and  selection  of  a  pool 
representative  without calling upon the court  to  mediate any dispute as to the 
appropriate media representative, costs or equipment authorized for a particular 
proceeding.  

.  EQUIPMENT, SOUND AND LIGHT CRITERIA  

1) Sound or Light Distractions. No electronic device that produces distract-
ing  sound  or  light  either  from  the  equipment  itself  or  from  its operation  shall 
be used to cover judicial proceedings. The court may, at its discretion, require 
proof  that  equipment  meets  these  guidelines  before  approving  the  equipment 
for use at a particular proceeding. Further, the court may order operation of any 
equipment to cease if that equipment does not meet these guidelines.

temporary  artificial  lighting  device  of  any  kind  shall  be  employed  in  connec-
tion with any electronic video television camera, electronic device or still pho-
tographic cameras.  

 

3) Adding Light Sources. With the approval of the court and the concurrence 
of the owner of the building in which a court facility is situated, modifications

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
