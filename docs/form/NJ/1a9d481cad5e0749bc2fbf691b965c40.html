New Jersey Judiciary 
Superior Court of New Jersey 
Law Division, Special Civil Part 

Landlord/Tenant Procedures 

The following procedures apply in cases where a landlord is trying to evict (also known as 
“lockout”) a tenant.  Please take the time to read this information and visit the Judiciary website 
at Self-help Landlord/Tenant (njcourts.gov)for more information about landlord tenant rules 
and procedures.  Both landlords and tenants can ask questions of court staff at any point during 
the process, but court staff cannot provide legal advice. 

1.  Complaint filed and served 

The landlord must file a complaint, summons, and Landlord Case Information Statement 
(LCIS).  Those documents will explain why the landlord is seeking to evict the tenant(s) and 
will be served on the tenant(s). 

Tenants must complete a Tenant Case Information Statement (TCIS).  The TCIS will explain 
the tenant’s position.  The tenant should file this with the court electronically (or by mail) at 
least five (5) days before the scheduled case management conference otherwise it will be 
required at the conference. 

Court forms for both landlords and tenants are available on the njcourts.gov website on the 
Self-Help Page: Self-help Landlord/Tenant (njcourts.gov). 

2.  Mandatory Case Management Conference 

The court will schedule a case management conference either virtually (by video) or in 
person.  Both landlord and tenant must appear at the case management conference, and 
can use Judiciary technology rooms to participate, if necessary.  Contact the Special Civil 
Part Office at                           , ext.             to arrange for a room. 

Both the Landlord and Tenant CIS forms must be received before the case management 
conference.  At the conference, court staff will ask questions to gather information for the 
judge and both sides will be able to explain their positions.  Court staff will then talk to both 
sides about trying to settle their case. 

3.  Settlement Conference 

The landlord and tenant will be asked to talk to each other to try to settle their case.  Neutral 
court staff will help both sides try to settle their case.  If the case does not settle prior to trial, 
the court will schedule a settlement conference to take place on the day of trial.  Neither the 
landlord nor the tenant is required to settle their case and both have the right to a trial. 

4.  Settlement Agreements 

If both landlord and tenant agree to settle their case, the court or court staff will review the 
terms of the settlement agreement.  Some agreements will require the judge to review and 
approve the agreement and some will also require the landlord and tenant to testify about the 

Effective 09/01/2021, CN 12822 

page 1 of 4 

Landlord/Tenant Procedures 

terms of the agreement on the record in open court.  All settlement agreements will be 
written (or placed on the record), with a copy provided to the parties, and added to the 
court’s electronic file. 

If you settle your case, please note: 

•  You should settle only if you agree with the terms.  Both landlord and tenant must 

agree to the terms for a settlement. 

•  Court staff can provide an agreement form which can be completed virtually (by 

video) or in person.  If completed in person, the signed agreement should be provided 
to the court. 

•  Court staff can also provide forms for any certification from the landlord and/or the 

•  The wording of the settlement form can be changed depending on the terms you have 

landlord’s attorney. 

agreed upon. 

•  Make sure that you understand the words in the settlement because if you are a tenant 
and agree to entry of a judgment for possession and do not comply with the terms of 
the settlement, you can be evicted. 

•  Any agreement that says a judgment for possession will or can be entered must be 

approved by a judge if a residential tenant does not have an attorney. 

5.  Trial 

If you are a tenant and you disagree with what your landlord claims, such as the amount of 
the rent that is owed, you have the right to explain your position at trial.  Most trials will be 
conducted virtually, by video.  Parties can use Judiciary technology rooms to participate, if 
necessary.  In some cases, trial may be conducted in person.  If the tenant does not appear, 
the case can be marked “DEFAULT.” This means the landlord can apply for a judgment 
against the tenant and the tenant can be evicted if the judgement is granted.  If the landlord 
does not appear, the case can be “DISMISSED.”  This means the case will not proceed. 

6.  Entry of Judgment for Possession 

At the conclusion of a trial or where a tenant does not appear at trial and the landlord proves 
their case, the court will enter a judgment for possession.  A judgment for possession is a 
written document that contains the result of the case and explains the basis for the court’s 
decision.  The judgment for possession also explains the next steps in the process. 

When the court enters a judgment for possession, the court is granting the landlord the legal 
right to possession of the rental property.  This can happen if the landlord can prove their 
case on the day of trial, if the tenant fails to appear and the case is marked as “DEFAULT,” 
or if the landlord and tenant agree to the entry of a judgment for possession.

Landlord/Tenant Procedures 
7.  Application for and Issuance of a Warrant of Removal 

After the judgment for possession is entered, the landlord can ask the court to issue a warrant 
of removal to a Special Civil Part Officer.  The warrant of removal allows the Special Civil 
Part Officer to proceed with the process of evicting a tenant from the property.  The warrant 
of removal cannot be issued less than three (3) business days after the judgment for 
possession is entered.  A Special Civil Part Officer is the person who serves (delivers) the 
warrant of removal on the tenant. 

8.  Service of the Warrant of Removal 

The warrant of removal must be served by the Special Civil Part Officer on the tenant by 
delivering or posting the warrant of removal on the door of the rental property. 

9.  Execution of the Warrant of Removal/Eviction 

Three (3) business days after the warrant of removal is served, a landlord can request that the 
Special Civil Part Officer return to the residential rental property a second time to execute 
the warrant of removal by requiring the tenant to vacate the premises and permitting the 
landlord to change the locks.  This is when the eviction (lockout) is completed. 

NOTE: Landlords cannot evict tenants by themselves.  Special Civil Part Officers are 
the only individuals authorized to evict tenants.  Tenants cannot be evicted on a 
weekend or holiday. 

Illegal Evictions 

A landlord cannot evict tenants from a rental property; only a Special Civil Part Officer can 
perform an eviction.  In order to have a Special Civil Part Officer evict a tenant, a landlord must 
first get a judgment for possession and then a warrant of removal from the court.  It is illegal 
for the landlord to force a tenant out by changing the locks, padlocking the doors, by shutting 
off gas, water or electricity.  Landlords can only remove a tenant’s belongings after an eviction 
as permitted by the Abandoned Tenant Property Act N.J.S.A. 2A:18-72 (unless otherwise 
provided for in a non-residential lease). 

Tenants who have been locked out of their homes illegally should call the police.  The New 
Jersey Office of the Attorney General has released guidance on illegal lockouts and the role of 
law enforcement agencies in preventing them.  More information is available at the following 
link: https://nj.gov/oag/dcj/agguide/directives/ag-Directive-2021-2_Illegal_Evictions.pdf. 

Tenants who have been locked out of their rental property illegally can also file a civil 
complaint at the county courthouse.  For more information on illegal evictions (lockouts) go to 
Self-help Landlord/Tenant (njcourts.gov). 

Other Options After a Judgment for Possession is Entered 

1.  Agreement.  After a judgment for possession has been entered, a landlord and tenant can 
still try to make an agreement to stop an eviction.  If the landlord and the tenant agree, the 
agreement should be in writing and a copy of the agreement can be filed with the court.

Landlord/Tenant Procedures 
2.  Paying all Rent Due and Owing.  By law, a residential tenant can pay all rent due and 

owing plus proper costs up to three (3) business days after the eviction.  The landlord must 
accept this payment and/or cooperate with a rental assistance program or bona fide 
charitable organization that has committed to pay the rent. 

3.  Asking the Court for Relief.  A tenant can apply for relief to the court.  To do so, a tenant 

must file: 
a.  An application for orderly removal requesting up to seven (7) more calendar days to 

move out if there is a good reason; 

b.  A motion requesting dismissal with prejudice of the nonpayment of rent action because 
the residential tenant paid all rent due and owing plus proper costs, or because the 
landlord refused to accept the residential tenant’s payment, within three (3) business days 
following the eviction; or an order to show cause because the landlord refused to 
cooperate with a rental assistance program or bona fide charitable organization that has 
committed to pay the rent; and/or 

c.  An application for a hardship stay, which delays the eviction based on the unavailability 
of other housing accommodations.  That delay cannot be for more than six (6) months 
from entry of the judgment for possession, and the tenant will have to pay all rent and 
proper costs. 

A tenant can also file a motion under Rule 4:50-1 requesting that the judgment for 
possession be vacated (reversed) and the complaint dismissed, if the tenant can show good 
reason such as mistake or excusable neglect, fraud, misrepresentation or other misconduct by 
an adverse party, newly discovered evidence or any other reason justifying relief from the 
judgment for possession.  For more information visit the landlord tenant page at: Self-help 
Landlord/Tenant (njcourts.gov).
