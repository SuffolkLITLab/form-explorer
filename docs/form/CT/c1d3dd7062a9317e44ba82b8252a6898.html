INTRODUCTION 
 

 
This slide presentation has been put together by the 
Appellate Advocacy Section of the Connecticut Bar Association 
and the Connecticut Judicial Branch to help self-represented 
parties deal with a part of the appellate process known as the 
Preargument Conference (also referred to as PAC).   The PAC is a 
mandatory settlement conference conducted by a judge.  The 
PAC occurs before the parties have submitted briefs.  It is 
arranged by the Court.      

This presentation explains what to expect and how best to 

prepare for your attendance at a preargument conference.   

     

DISCLAIMER 

The information contained in this handbook and the 

accompanying slide presentation is an overview of the 
preargument conference process and is not legal advice.  The 
information contained in the handbook does not replace or 
supersede any statutory or appellate rules that apply to the 
process.  The purpose of the handbook is to provide general 
information to assist self-represented parties in preparing to 
attend a preargument conference.

 

   

   

PURPOSE OF A PAC 
 

After an appeal is filed in Connecticut, the appealing party— 

 
called the “appellant”—must file a number of additional papers, 
including a “Statement for Preargument Conference” form.     

A PAC is a very important part of the appellate process.  Its 

main goals are to identify which issues in the appeal have the 
potential to win, weed out any issues that are unlikely to win, 
discuss the appellate process, and, most importantly, talk about 
resolving the case through settlement.   

 

   

 
WHO ATTENDS A PAC 

Every party must attend the PAC in accordance with 
Practice Book section 63-10; no one is excused unless the judge 
conducting the PAC excuses him or her for special circumstances.   

A judge will conduct the PAC.  Many of the PAC judges are 

former Appellate Court or Supreme Court judges.  All PAC 
judges have experience and knowledge of the appellate process, 
and they can often anticipate how an appeal will turn out.  A PAC 
judge is an important source of information, and is there to help 
the parties.  The PAC judge will have read limited information 
about your case, and will understand what the issues are and 
what happened at trial.  

       

   

   

 

HOW A PAC IS CONDUCTED 
 

Every judge conducts a PAC differently.  Most judges will 

not wear a robe during a PAC.  Some judges prefer that the 
parties talk to each other directly, while other judges like to direct 
the conversation between the parties.  Often, judges will start by 
talking to everyone in a group.  After the group discussion, the 
judge may ask to speak to each side individually.  Do not be 
surprised if the judge wants to speak to you alone.   

     

   

 

PREPARING FOR A PAC: 
Appeals Are Different From Trial 
 
The most important thing to keep in mind when preparing 
 
for your PAC is that the appeal process is very different from a 
trial.    

Unlike the trial judge or a jury, appellate judges do not 
weigh evidence or find facts.  During an appeal, there will be no 
witnesses or testimony, and you cannot offer any new evidence 
not presented to the trial court.  As a result, it is important to 
understand that an appeal is not an opportunity for either party 
to retry the case.  Instead, the appellate judges decide only issues 
of law.  They have limited ability to review many decisions made 
in the trial court, including fact determinations.   This means that 
in most cases the appellate judges’ primary role will be to review 
the trial judge’s or jury’s decision, based on the facts already 
found, and determine legal not factual issues.  Understanding this 
difference between trial and appellate courts is very important for 
you as you prepare for your PAC – you should keep them in 
mind when you think about whether you should settle your 
appeal, and if you don’t settle, what issues you plan to present as 
the appeal moves forward. 

   

   

PREPARING FOR A PAC: 
What You Need To Know 
 
To help you prepare for your PAC, we will focus on four 

1. Standard of review, or how the appellate judges will look at 

 
main areas of preparation:  
 

the issues in your case 
 

2. Remedies, or outcomes 

 

 

3. Assessing your position  

4. Settlement considerations 
 

Thinking about these four topics will help you get ready to 
actively take part in the PAC, and help you take advantage of all 
that a PAC has to offer. 

   

 
STANDARD OF REVIEW 

Before your PAC, you should try to understand how strong or weak 

 
the appeal is, and what result you can expect if the appeal is successful.  
You first need to consider whether each issue appealed was raised in the 
trial court – if it was not brought to the trial court’s attention, the Appellate 
Court’s authority to look at it on appeal is extremely limited.  Even if an 
issue was correctly brought up in the trial court, you also need to 
understand the standard of review that the appellate judges will apply to 
the issues raised on appeal.  The “standard of review” refers to the lens 
through which the appellate judges will evaluate the issues before them.   

 
The standard of review is different for different kinds of issues. The 
most difficult issues to win on appeal are those where the appellate judges 
apply the abuse of discretion standard.  The abuse of discretion standard 
applies to many trial court decisions such as rulings to admit or exclude 
evidence, whether it involves documents or testimony.  A trial judge has a 
lot of leeway in making rulings during trial.  So, the appellate judges will 
not disturb the decision unless they are convinced that the trial judge had 
no valid basis for making it.  In the case where a party claims that evidence 
should or should not have been admitted, there is another hurdle:  The 
appellant must also show that the trial judge’s decision was not harmless 
error.  In other words, after convincing the appellate judges that the trial 
judge abused his or her discretion, the appellant must then prove that the 
mistake likely affected the outcome of the decision. 

 
Findings of fact made by a judge or jury are also very difficult to 
overturn on appeal.  This is because appellate judges generally follow what 
the trial judge or jury decides, especially on issues involving witness 
credibility, that is, whether a witness lied or told the truth.  The appellate 
judges will overturn a finding of fact only if they determine it was clearly 
erroneous.  This means the appellate judges will not overturn the finding of 
fact unless the finding could not reasonably have been made based on the 
evidence admitted at trial.   

 

 
REMEDIES 
 
In addition to the standard of review, to assess the strength 

 
of your position as compared to that of your opponent’s, you 
need to understand what the outcome – called the remedy – will 
be if the appeal is successful.  Will there be a new trial or other, 
additional proceedings in the trial court, or will the appellant win 
outright?  If there would be a new trial, would the trial address 
only some issues, such as the damages to be awarded to the 
plaintiff?  You may not be able to obtain the relief you want – it 
might not be legally possible – and it is important to know your 
limitations in advance.   

 
ASSESSING YOUR POSITION 

   

Be aware that the majority of civil appeals are unsuccessful, 

 
so it is important to weigh your position realistically.  That is why 
understanding the standard of review and potential remedies is 
so important for preparing for your PAC.  Understanding these 
issues will help you to figure out the strengths and weaknesses of 
the appeal, to think through what risks each party faces, and to 
understand how long litigation may go on even after the appeal is 
over. 

The PAC offers all parties the opportunity to consider 
settlement.  By understanding each party’s strengths, weaknesses, 
and risks, you will be able to think about what a reasonable 
settlement might look like.  An appellant with a strong appeal is 
in a better position to negotiate a favorable settlement.  On the 
other hand, the weaker an appeal is, the worse position an 
appellant is in to negotiate a favorable settlement.  It is critical to 
understand where your appeal falls before you participate in a 
PAC, so you can point out the strengths of your position to the 
PAC judge, while staying realistic about your chances for success. 

After considering the strengths and weaknesses of your case, 

you should also think about the time the appeal will take, and 
how much the appeal will cost you.  Appeals are time consuming 
and can be expensive.   
 

   

   

 
SETTLEMENT CONSIDERATIONS 
 
When you think about settlement possibilities, you should 
 
keep in mind that a settlement is always a compromise.  No one 
gets everything he or she is looking for when a case settles.  Each 
side has to give in on some things to reach an agreement.  Think 
about what that means for you personally.  In your case, do you 
need to lower your demand for money, or make some payment to 
another party, in order to settle?  If your case is not about money, 
can you take some other kind of action, or keep from doing 
something so that the case can settle?  Are you willing to make 
the first offer of settlement, or should you reconsider an offer that 
has been made by the other party?   

As hard as it is to do, you need to give serious thought 

ahead of time to the compromises you are willing to make.  In 
doing so, you can be creative in proposing a resolution that may 
be acceptable to all parties involved in the appeal.  This kind of 
preparation will likely make your PAC a more worthwhile 
experience.   

You should be realistic about your expectations.  

Considering your standard of review, the remedies possible, and 
the strength of the issues on appeal will help you arrive at a 
realistic goal.   

   

   

 

 
WHAT IS DISCUSSED AT A PAC 
 
The focus of the PAC will be on the appeal – whether it is a 

 
strong appeal and whether it can be settled.   Settlement can mean 
many different things.  Depending on what your case is about, 
this might involve paying an amount of money, or agreeing to do 
certain things.  You might even be interested in going through a 
formal mediation process.  If there is a chance of settlement, the 
judge may ask the parties to write out a settlement agreement.  
Or, if more time is needed, the judge may allow the parties to pick 
another date to come back and finish the settlement discussions.  
  
 
or weaknesses of an appeal.  It is the judge’s job to encourage 
parties to settle weak appeals, or to narrow and focus the appeal 
on strong issues. Not every issue will win, and some issues are 
better than others.  It is far better to have two stronger issues than 
seven weaker ones.  Additionally, the judge can answer questions 
about the appellate process and schedule the first deadlines for 
filing briefs in the appellate courts.   

The PAC can be very useful for understanding the strengths 

 
WHAT IS NOT DISCUSSED AT A PAC 
 

A PAC, like an appeal, is not a second trial.  You may only 

 
talk about evidence or testimony that was considered at trial.  
You cannot show the PAC judge any “new” evidence, or try to 
explain background facts that were not discussed at trial.  You 
cannot bring any witness with you or try to give testimony.  An 
appeal is primarily about legal issues, and the PAC judge will ask 
you to focus on the legal issues in your case.   

The PAC judge will not give you legal advice, and you 
should not ask the judge to do so. However, the PAC judge may 
give you his or her opinion on how the appeal might turn out, but 
he or she will never tell you what to do.  You should not think of 
anything discussed during the PAC as legal advice.  

During the PAC, you should not complain about the 
personality or competence of the trial judge.  You can talk about 
any mistakes the trial judge may have made, and why those 
mistakes will create a good appeal. This is also not an opportunity 
to insult any attorney, witness, or the other party.  Doing so will 
only damage your credibility.   

Most importantly, do not forget that the main goal of the 
PAC is to figure out whether settlement is the best option for you, 
or, if not, which issues in the appeal are the most important.    

   

   

   

 
WHAT SHOULD I DO DURING A PAC 
 
It is important to behave appropriately during a PAC.   

 
Although the PAC is not a court proceeding, like a trial or 
hearing, it is a professional setting that requires appropriate and 
professional behavior.   

First, you should come to the PAC with the right attitude.  

Keep an open mind, as you might learn something about your 
case and the appeals process.  Be involved in the discussion by 
listening to everyone and participating when it is appropriate.  
You must also be ready to discuss the substance of your case, 
including the issues, the standard of review that applies to those 
issues, and what remedies you want.  It is good to talk openly 
with the judge, and to keep realistic expectations.   

Second, you should act in a professional manner.  Do not 
interrupt anyone who is talking – you will be given chances to 
talk, and you won’t want anyone else to interrupt you.  You 
should always stay calm, use neutral language, and never swear, 
raise your voice, or be sarcastic.  Do not sigh, roll your eyes, or 
use inappropriate hand gestures.  You should also dress neatly 
and modestly. That means no baseball hats or other caps (unless 
they are for religious purposes), and no dirty or ripped clothing, 
shirts with offensive words or pictures, or tank tops.  Never eat, 
drink, chew gum, or walk around the room.  Food required for a 
medical condition may be allowed during the PAC, provided you 
ask the judge first and are not disruptive while you eat or drink. 
You should also plan to arrive 15 minutes early for your PAC.   

   

   

           

FREQUENTLY ASKED 
QUESTIONS 

 
Do I have to attend the PAC – What happens 
if I don’t go?   

es.  Attorneys and self-represented parties must attend the PAC.   

Attendance is by order of the court and the failure to attend can 
result in sanctions, which might include a fine.  If you are unable 
to attend the conference on the date and time scheduled, you 
must contact the judge holding the PAC to request that it be 
rescheduled.   If you need to reschedule the PAC, you should also 
tell any opposing counsel and/or self-represented party.  Finally, 
if, prior to the date of a scheduled PAC, the appeal is settled or 
withdrawn, the parties must notify the PAC judge prior to the 
scheduled date that the matter has been resolved.       

re my discussions during the PAC 

confidential? 

es.  Statements and comments made during the PAC are 
confidential.  They may not be later discussed by the judge, 
attorneys or self-represented parties if the appeal moves forward.   
Conversations taking place during the preargument conference 
about the case are kept confidential to allow for honest 
discussions that may help reach a settlement or narrow the issues 
on appeal.

hat orders can the Judge enter regarding my 

appeal? 

he PAC judge does not enter any orders regarding the merits of 

the appeal.  The judge does not enter any orders regarding any 
appeal or trial motions.  The judge cannot decide the appeal.  The 
preargument judge can set the timetable for filing briefs in the 
Appellate Court and can recommend that a case pending in the 
Appellate Court be transferred to the Supreme Court. 

ill the PAC delay my appeal? 

he PAC is an essential part of the appeal process.  It provides an 

opportunity for the parties to think about their interests, assess 
the risks of appeal and determine whether a mutually satisfactory 
solution can be reached.   The appeal does not move forward until 
after the PAC has been held.   The appellate clerk’s office often 
extends the time for filing the appellant’s brief until after the 
PAC.   If this has not occurred, the PAC judge has the power and 
will often extend the times for filing briefs.

an I communicate directly with the Judge 

either before or after the PAC?  

arties should not independently communicate (either by phone, 

writing or e-mail) with the PAC judge concerning the substance 
or merits of their appeal.   Communication with the judge either 
before or after the PAC without the other party present should 
only concern scheduling or a matter specifically requested by the 
judge during the conference. 

hat happens next? 

 

If the appeal does not settle after the PAC, then the appeal will 
proceed.   The next step usually will be to file a brief.  A briefing 
schedule will be set and the appeal will move forward according 
to the appellate rules.   In some cases, follow up settlement 
discussions may be scheduled with the PAC judge.  Whether the 
appeal will move forward during the follow up time period will 
depend upon the specific situation and the briefing schedule 
ordered by the judge.
