v. DONALD FOSBERG
(AC 45880)

Bright, C. J., and Suarez and Seeley, Js.

Syllabus

The plaintiff landlord sought, by way of summary process, to regain posses-
sion of certain premises leased to the defendant tenant. The plaintiff
served the defendant with a notice to quit possession for violations of
statutory provisions (§ 47a-11 (c) and (g)) relating to the responsibilities
of tenants and, thereafter, served him with a summons and complaint,
seeking immediate possession of the premises. Following a trial, the
trial court rendered judgment of possession in favor of the defendant,
concluding, inter alia, that the plaintiff failed to meet its burden of proof
as to the alleged violations. The defendant subsequently filed a motion
for attorney’s fees pursuant to the statute (§ 42-150bb) that allows a
consumer to recover attorney’s fees from a commercial party when the
consumer successfully defends an action based on a lease that provides
for attorney’s fees for the commercial party. The trial court granted the
motion and awarded the defendant $3500 in attorney’s fees. Following
the denial of its motion to reargue, the plaintiff appealed to this court,
challenging the trial court’s postjudgment award of attorney’s fees. The
defendant moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdic-
tion on the ground that it was untimely. Held that this court had subject
matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff’s appeal, and, therefore, the defen-
dant’s motion to dismiss was denied; contrary to the defendant’s asser-
tion that the plaintiff’s appeal was untimely because it was not filed
within the five day appeal period set forth in the statute (§ 47a-35) that
pertains to appeals in summary process actions, this court concluded
that, when, as here, there has been no challenge to the underlying
judgment of possession, an appeal taken from a postjudgment award
of attorney’s fees does not affect the underlying judgment of possession
in any way, and the twenty day appeal period set forth in the applicable
rule of practice (§ 63-1) applies; accordingly, because the plaintiff
appealed from the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees within the appli-
cable twenty day period, its appeal was timely, and this court had
jurisdiction over it.

Opinion

BRIGHT, C. J. In this summary process action, the
plaintiff landlord, Centrix Management Company, LLC,
appeals from the trial court’s postjudgment award of
attorney’s fees to the defendant tenant, Donald Fosberg,
pursuant to General Statutes § 42-150bb. The defendant
moves to dismiss this appeal for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction on the ground that the plaintiff failed to
timely appeal pursuant to General Statutes § 47a-35. The
plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the applicable
appeal period is not five days under § 47a-35 but, rather,
twenty days under Practice Book § 63-1, as it is not
challenging the judgment of possession. We conclude
that the twenty day appeal period set forth in Practice
Book § 63-1 applies to a postjudgment award of attor-
ney’s fees in the summary process context. We there-
fore deny the motion to dismiss.

The following undisputed facts and procedural his-
tory are relevant to our review of the defendant’s
motion. The plaintiff leased the property located at 55
Spring Street, Unit 308, in New Britain (premises) to
the defendant. The defendant occupied the premises
and agreed to pay $795 per month for rent. When the
plaintiff instituted the underlying action, the parties
were in a one year lease of the premises. On August 19,
2021, the plaintiff sent the defendant a pretermination
notice for violations of General Statutes § 47a-11 (c)
and (g).1 The defendant attempted to remedy the viola-
tions. On September 17, 2021, the plaintiff served the
defendant with a notice to quit possession for violations
of § 47a-11 (c) and (g), namely, his refusal or failure to
remove garbage that created a smell that ‘‘disturb[ed]
[his] neighbor’s peaceful enjoyment of the premises or
constitute[d] a nuisance . . . .’’

The defendant did not quit possession. On September
28, 2021, the plaintiff served the defendant with a sum-
mary process summons and complaint, seeking immedi-
ate possession of the premises. The defendant filed
an answer and special defenses to the complaint on
October 13, 2021.2

After a virtual trial held on January 20 and 21, 2022,
the court rendered judgment of possession in favor of
the defendant on May 12, 2022, on the basis of the
plaintiff’s failure to meet its burden of proof as to the
alleged violations and the defendant’s having estab-
lished the applicability of the equitable doctrine of non-
forfeiture.

On June 10, 2022, twenty-nine days after the court
rendered its judgment, the defendant, relying on § 42-
150bb, filed a motion for attorney’s fees and requested
$6622.15 for 30.6 hours of work by his counsel. The
plaintiff filed an objection on June 20, 2022, arguing
that, because the amount of legal fees the plaintiff could
recover was capped in the lease at $750, that was the

most the defendant could recover pursuant to the recip-
rocal attorney’s fees language of § 42-150bb.3 On Sep-
tember 13, 2022, the court granted the defendant’s
motion and awarded $3500 in attorney’s fees. On Sep-
tember 19, 2022, the plaintiff filed a motion to reargue
the court’s award of attorney’s fees, which the court
denied on September 21, 2022.

The plaintiff filed the present appeal on October 7,
2022, challenging only the court’s postjudgment award
of attorney’s fees. On October 17, 2022, the defendant
moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction, arguing that it was untimely under § 47a-
35. The plaintiff filed an objection to the motion on
October 19, 2022.

The issue before this court is whether the five day
appeal period applicable to summary process actions
or the twenty day appeal period set forth in Practice
Book § 63-1 is applicable to the plaintiff’s appeal from
the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees. In particular,
we must decide whether the five day appeal period set
forth in § 47a-35 for judgments in summary process
actions applies to a postjudgment award of attorney’s
fees issued pursuant to § 42-150bb.

The defendant’s motion to dismiss raises a question
of statutory interpretation. ‘‘When construing a statute,
[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give
effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . In
other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned man-
ner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied
to the facts of [the] case, including the question of
whether the language actually does apply. . . . In seek-
ing to determine that meaning, General Statutes § 1-2z
directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself
and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining
such text and considering such relationship, the mean-
ing of such text is plain and unambiguous and does
not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual
evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be
considered.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Jobe
v. Commissioner of Correction, 334 Conn. 636, 648, 224
A.3d 147 (2020).

‘‘A statute is ambiguous if, when read in context, it
is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpreta-
tion.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Dominguez
v. New York Sports Club, 198 Conn. App. 854, 861, 234
A.3d 1017 (2020). When a statute is not plain and unam-
biguous, among other things, we ‘‘look for interpretive
guidance . . . to the legislative policy [the statute] was
designed to implement, and to its relationship to
existing legislation and common law principles govern-
.’’ (Internal
ing the same general subject matter .

Ins. Co., 277 Conn. 398, 405, 891 A.2d 959 (2006).

.

.

We begin our analysis with the language of § 47a-35,

which provides: ‘‘(a) Execution shall be stayed for five
days from the date judgment has been rendered, pro-
vided any Sunday or legal holiday intervening shall be
excluded in computing such five days.

‘‘(b) No appeal shall be taken except within such five-
day period. If an appeal is taken within such period,
execution shall be stayed until the final determination
of the cause, unless it appears to the judge who tried
the case that the appeal was taken solely for the purpose
of delay or unless the defendant fails to give bond, as
provided in section 47a-35a. If execution has not been
stayed, as provided in this subsection, execution may
then issue, except as otherwise provided in 47a-36 to
47a-41, inclusive.’’

In the present case, the dispositive issue is whether
the phrase ‘‘[n]o appeal shall be taken except within
such five-day period’’ in § 47a-35 applies to the defen-
dant’s appeal from the postjudgment attorney’s fees
award. We initially note that, by its plain language, § 47a-
35 clearly is directed to appeals from judgments of
possession. Subsection (b) of the statute requires that
a party appeal within five days after the judgment was
rendered, during the automatic stay of execution pro-
vided in subsection (a). General Statutes § 47a-35 (a)
and (b). Although § 47a-35 does not specify the type of
executions to which it applies, the exceptions it identi-
fies in subsection (b) all relate to executions of judg-
ments of possession. General Statutes § 47a-36 lists the
types of occupancies to which a stay of execution does
not apply. General Statutes § 47a-37 provides that a
defendant against whom judgment was rendered for
nonpayment of rent may apply for a stay if he deposits
the full amount of the rent arrearage with the court.
General Statutes § 47a-39 sets forth reasons for which
a court can grant a stay of execution, all of which relate
to the defendant’s need for possession of the premises.
In addition, the bond provided for in General Statutes
§ 47a-35a, which is required in connection with a stay
of execution, is ‘‘to guarantee payment for all rents that
may accrue during the pendency of the appeal . . . .’’
Finally, General Statutes § 47a-42 (a) provides in rele-
vant part that, ‘‘upon expiration of any stay of execution,
the plaintiff may obtain an execution upon such sum-
mary process judgment, and the defendant or other
occupant bound by the judgment . . . may be removed
by a state marshal, pursuant to such execution . . . .’’

Furthermore, as this court has stated: ‘‘The ultimate
issue in a summary process action is the right to posses-
sion . . . and [t]he relief available in summary process
actions is possession of the premises.’’ (Emphasis in
original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Centrix
Management Co., LLC v. Valencia, 145 Conn. App. 682,
691, 76 A.3d 694 (2013). ‘‘Summary process is a special
statutory procedure designed to provide an expeditious

remedy.

.

.

.

sion of leased premises without suffering the delay, loss
and expense to which, under the common-law actions,
they might be subjected by tenants wrongfully holding
over their terms.
. Summary process statutes
secure a prompt hearing and final determination. . . .
Therefore, the statutes relating to summary process
must be narrowly construed and strictly followed.’’
(Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)
Young v. Young, 249 Conn. 482, 487–88, 733 A.2d 835
(1999). ‘‘The process is intended to be summary and
is designed to provide an expeditious remedy to the
landlord seeking possession.’’
(Internal quotation
marks omitted.) HUD/Barbour-Waverly v. Wilson, 235
Conn. 650, 658, 668 A.2d 1309 (1995).

In HUD/Barbour-Waverly, our Supreme Court exam-
ined the plain meaning of § 47a-35 and the legislative
policy surrounding the enactment of the statute. Id.,
656–59. In that case, the court concluded that, ‘‘[i]n
light of the plain language of § 47a-35, the fact that the
summary process statutes are in derogation of common
law and the legislative policy in favor of the swift
resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants
regarding rights of possession, we conclude that an
appeal pursuant to § 47a-35 must be brought within five
days of the rendering of a summary process judgment.’’
(Emphasis added.) Id., 659.

It is not just that the summary process statutes are
designed to provide for prompt resolution of the issue
of possession of the leased premises; that is their sole
purpose. A plaintiff may not seek any remedy in a sum-
mary process action other than possession of the prem-
ises. In particular, it may not seek damages and it may
not seek attorney’s fees provided for in the lease. See
Centrix Management Co., LLC v. Valencia, supra, 145
Conn. App. 692 n.4 (‘‘ ‘[p]ostjudgment claims for attor-
ney’s fees by prevailing landlords can only be brought
pursuant to a specific lease provision in a separate
postjudgment civil action because they are not statuto-
rily derived’ ’’). Furthermore, it is clear that the legisla-
ture intended for remedies other than possession to be
available through an action separate from the summary
process proceeding. See General Statutes § 47a-34
(‘‘[a]ll persons claiming title to premises concerning
which any proceedings under this chapter have been
had shall be entitled to any other legal remedy in the
same manner as if such proceedings had not been had’’).
Consequently, we conclude that the phrase ‘‘[n]o appeal
shall be taken except within such five-day period,’’
when read in the context of the rest of § 47a-35, the
entire summary process chapter, and the decisions of
our Supreme Court and this court, refers only to appeals
from judgments of possession. Appeals from a postjudg-
ment ruling like that at issue in the present case are
properly governed by our general rules of practice.

Our conclusion is consistent with this court’s reason-

ing in Centrix Management Co., LLC. In that case, this
court addressed an argument made by the Connecticut
Coalition of Property Owners, as amicus curiae, that
the limited scope of summary process actions did not
permit a defendant to file a postjudgment motion for
attorney’s fees pursuant to § 42-150bb. Centrix Man-
agement Co., LLC v. Valencia, supra, 145 Conn. App.
690–91. This court rejected that argument, noting that
our Supreme Court had held that ‘‘claims for attorney’s
fees under § 42-150bb must be brought by a motion
under Practice Book § 11-21. That provision provides
that the motion must be filed within thirty days after
the final judgment of the trial court was rendered or
within thirty days after an appellate decision on the
underlying matter. Practice Book § 11-21. We see no
hindrance to preserving the expeditious nature of
summary process cases in allowing such motions.’’
(Emphasis added.) Centrix Management Co., LLC v.
Valencia, supra, 692. Implicit in this holding is that the
filing of such a motion would not delay any appeal
from the judgment of possession. It would hinder the
expeditious nature of a summary process action if a
plaintiff could delay filing its appeal until after the court
ruled on a defendant’s postjudgment motion for attor-
ney’s fees. Generally, a posttrial hearing is scheduled
for presentation of evidence in support of a claim for
attorney’s fees. See Landry v. Spitz, 102 Conn. App.
34, 59–60, 925 A.2d 334 (2007). It is virtually certain
that a defendant’s motion for attorney’s fees would not
be resolved prior to the expiration of the five day appeal
period in § 47a-35. Thus, this court necessarily recog-
nized in Centrix Management Co., LLC, that a postjudg-
ment motion for attorney’s fees pursuant to § 42-150bb
is a separate ancillary proceeding distinct from the judg-
ment of possession rendered pursuant to the summary
process statutes; see Centrix Management Co., LLC v.
Valencia, supra, 692 n.4; see also Freeman v. A Better
Way Wholesale Autos, Inc., 174 Conn. App. 649, 652
n.1, 166 A.3d 857 (‘‘a trial court’s supplemental postjudg-
ment order determining the amount of attorney’s fees
to be awarded to a prevailing party may raise a collateral
and independent claim that is separately appealable as
a final judgment’’ (internal quotation marks omitted)),
cert. denied, 327 Conn. 927, 171 A.3d 60 (2017); and
that the procedure for resolving such a motion is that set
forth in the rules of practice.4 See Centrix Management
Co., LLC v. Valencia, supra, 692.

Similarly, we conclude that when, as in the present
case, there has been no challenge to the underlying
judgment of possession, an appeal from the award of
attorney’s fees does not affect the judgment of posses-
sion in any way. Permitting the plaintiff to file its appeal
from the award pursuant to the time periods set forth
in Practice Book § 63-1 ‘‘will not thwart the purpose
behind the summary process statutes.’’ Id. Accordingly,
we are not persuaded that the plaintiff’s failure to file

this appeal within the appeal period set forth in § 47a-
35 deprives this court of jurisdiction.

In sum, when an appeal is taken from a summary
process judgment of possession, the five day appeal
period prescribed in § 47a-35 applies. However, when
an appeal is taken from a postjudgment award of attor-
ney’s fees made pursuant to § 42a-150bb, which does
not go to the merits of the underlying judgment of
possession, the applicable appeal period is twenty days
as prescribed in Practice Book § 63-1. Because the plain-
tiff filed its appeal from the court’s award of attorney’s
fees within that twenty day period, this court has juris-
diction over the appeal.

The motion to dismiss is denied.

In this opinion the other judges concurred.
1 General Statutes § 47a-11 provides in relevant part: ‘‘A tenant shall . . .
(c) remove from his dwelling unit all ashes, garbage, rubbish and other
waste in a clean and safe manner to the place provided by the landlord
pursuant to subdivision (5) of subsection (a) of section 47a-7 .
. [and]
(g) conduct himself and require other persons on the premises with his
consent to conduct themselves in a manner that will not disturb his neigh-
bors’ peaceful enjoyment of the premises or constitute a nuisance, as defined
in section 47a-32, or a serious nuisance, as defined in section 47a-15 . . . .’’
2 On December 3, 2021, the defendant filed a request to amend his special

.

defenses, which the trial court granted on the same date.

3 General Statutes § 42-150bb provides in relevant part: ‘‘Whenever any
contract or lease entered into on or after October 1, 1979, to which a
consumer is a party, provides for the attorney’s fee of the commercial party
to be paid by the consumer, an attorney’s fee shall be awarded as a matter
of law to the consumer who successfully prosecutes or defends an action
or a counterclaim based upon the contract or lease. . . .’’

4 Our conclusion is buttressed further by the fact that the defendant’s
motion for attorney’s fees was not based on any summary process statute.
In fact, the summary process statutes do not provide for such an award. The
defendant’s motion was based on § 42-150bb. Section 42-150bb is codified
in title 42 of the General Statutes, under the heading ‘‘Business, Selling,
Trading and Collection Practices,’’ which is separate and apart from the
summary process statutes, which appear in title 47a under the heading
‘‘Landlord and Tenant.’’

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
