      <pre>A Guide to  
Housing  
Matters

State of Connecticut Judicial Branch  
Superior Court

History of Housing Court
Connecticut started its housing courts in 1979 to help 
what is now the Hartford and New Britain Judicial 
Districts. Today, these courts also help the judicial 
districts of Fairfield, New Haven, Waterbury and 
Stamford-Norwalk. A list of these courts and their 
addresses and telephone numbers is in this pamphlet.

In parts of the state, housing cases are handled by 
judicial district courts instead of housing courts. A 
listing of the judicial district courts where housing 
cases are heard is in this pamphlet. You can get 
all housing forms and instructions at those court 
locations.

Housing Court Structure
In housing court there is a judge, a clerk to help 
people who are representing themselves, and housing 
mediators who only work on housing cases.

Clerk’s Office
The clerk’s office gives tenants booklets that 
explain court procedures in language that is easy to 
understand. Also, most of the forms used in housing 
court have been written in language that is easy to 
understand.

Housing Mediators
Housing mediators are court employees who help 
the court in housing cases. Their main job is to work 
out housing problems. They may work on all housing 
cases whether the parties agree or disagree.

Housing mediators help to work out problems 
between landlords and tenants and can inspect the 
premises. Not every housing problem will go to trial. 
The housing mediators may help the parties work 
out an agreement before trial. This agreement is then 
reviewed by a judge.

Housing Docket
The Housing Court is divided into five (5) parts. 
In the criminal part, a criminal case can be started 
when a housing code inspector brings housing 

complaints to the housing prosecutor who will start 
a criminal case if a violation of the housing code has 
happened. In the civil part, several types of cases may 
be decided, including actions for back rent, property 
damage, return of security deposits, injunctions, 
entry and detainer (lockouts), administrative appeals, 
and receiverships. There is no minimum or maximum 
dollar limit on cases. Most of the housing court 
cases fall into three categories: housing small claims, 
summary process (evictions), and housing code 
enforcement by tenants.

Court Entry Fees
Summary Process (Evictions) – $175.00
Small Claims – $95.00
Housing Code Enforcement – $25.00
Civil Cases Landlord/Tenant – $175.00

How to Sue in Housing Small  
Claims Court
The Housing Small Claims Court works the same 
as regular Small Claims Courts. If you have a claim 
for unpaid rent, damages to the premises, return of 
a security deposit, etc., you can start a housing small 
claims lawsuit for amounts up to $5,000.00.

Summary Process (Eviction)
When a landlord wants to remove a tenant from an 
apartment, he or she must go to housing court and 
begin an eviction. The following steps must generally 
be followed in order to evict a tenant. Sometimes the 
number of steps may be less if the tenant does not 
come to court to explain why he/she/they should not 
be evicted.

1. Notice to Quit:

The notice to quit asks the tenant to leave the 
apartment by a certain date. The notice also gives 
the tenant the reason why the tenant is being asked 
to leave. The notice to quit is only a request that the 
tenant voluntarily leave the apartment. The notice to 
quit is not an order to leave.

The Judicial Branch of the State of Connecticut 
complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act 
(ADA). If you need a reasonable accommodation, in 
accordance with the ADA, contact a Judicial Branch 
employee or an ADA contact person listed at  
www.jud.ct.gov/ada/.

2. Summons and Complaint:

A summons is an order for the tenant to come to court 
and file a written appearance form on or before the 
second day after the return date. The complaint lists 
all the reasons for eviction of the tenant. A summons 
and complaint is delivered after the date in the notice 
to quit.

3. Appearance:

Once the summons and complaint is delivered, the 
tenant may then file an appearance form with the 
court (the court has the proper form) within two (2) 
days after the return date. 

4. Answer to Complaint:

The tenant may also file an answer to the complaint. 
The answer agrees or disagrees with various portions 
of the complaint, or says that the tenant does not 
know. The answer also lists possible reasons why the 
tenant should not be evicted. These are called special 
defenses.

5. Trial:

Shortly after an answer is filed, the court will send the 
parties a notice of court hearing, which will give the 
time and date of the trial. At the trial, the landlord 
will have to show evidence to prove his or her 
complaint. The tenant should be ready to answer the 
landlord’s claims. The landlord and tenant may have 
witnesses testify and may show evidence to prove 
their claims. All parties, on the day of trial, will have 
a chance to settle their case with the help of a housing 
mediator.

6. Judgment and Execution:

If the case goes to trial, the court will let the parties 
know the judge’s decision, which is called a judgment. 
A judgment for the landlord is not an order for the 
tenant to leave the apartment. It means that the judge 
has decided the case for the landlord and the landlord 
has a right to ask for an execution requiring the 
tenant to move.

The clerk issues the execution. After the execution 
is issued, it must be given to a state marshal for 
proper service (delivery to the tenant). The marshal 
is required to use reasonable efforts to find and let 
the tenant know the date and time of the eviction. 
After the time, the marshal can physically remove the 
tenant’s possessions.

7. Stay of Execution:

A tenant may ask for more time before being evicted 
from his or her apartment by filing an application for 
a stay of execution. The length of the stay can be up 
to six (6) months in cases that do not deal with the 
nonpayment of rent, nuisance, serious nuisance, or 
where the occupant never had a right or privilege to 
occupy or be in the apartment.

In the case of nonpayment of rent, a tenant who 
deposits with the clerk of the court the full amount 
of rent due within five (5) days of the date that the 
judgment was entered may apply for a stay of up to 
three (3) months.

Housing Code Enforcement
A tenant may file a complaint against his or her landlord 
to correct certain housing code violations.

To start the case, the tenant fills out a complaint form 
at the court clerk’s office and begins paying his or her 
rent into the court clerk’s office. If the tenant wins, 
the court has the power to enforce certain orders. The 
landlord may file a counterclaim against the tenant. 
When the case is over, the court may order the rent 
that was paid to the court to be paid to the landlord or 
to the tenant or to both.

Conclusion
This pamphlet should not be used as a substitute for 
an attorney. It is meant to give people in housing 
cases a quick and easy understanding of some of the 
procedures used in Connecticut housing courts. If 
you have a housing problem, you should talk to an 
attorney. If you do not know an attorney, you may call 
a Lawyer Referral Service, which will help you find 
an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, call your 
local legal aid or legal services office.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
