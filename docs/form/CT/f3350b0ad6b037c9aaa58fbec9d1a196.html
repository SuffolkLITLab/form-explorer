Introduction

Supervised Visitation Program

The State of Connecticut Judicial Branch and 
Department of Social Services are working together 
to help support relationships between children and 
their parents who do not live with them by offering 
supportive services under the Access and Visitation 
Federal Grant. Community-based service providers, 
under contract with the Judicial Branch’s Court 
Support Services Division, offer two programs to 
help parents build relationships with their children:

•   Supervised Visitation 

•   Transitions in Parenting 

The goal of these services is to help parents who 
do not live with their children achieve meaningful, 
healthy, and productive interactions with them.

These services are offered at no cost to the clients 
for a limited amount of time. The agencies that 
provide the services are located in or around 
Bridgeport, Hartford, Norwich/New London and 
Waterbury. You may contact your local Court 
Support Services Division – Family Services office 
for more specifics.

A referral to either of these programs is only 
possible if the parents have an active case in Family 
Matters before the Superior Court. Family Services 
will make the referral to the community agency 
after a court order. A Family Relations Counselor 
will be the coordinator between the Court and the 
contracted service provider. Family Services will 
become involved if significant concerns come 
up while you are taking part in the program by 
bringing the matter back to court. 

The purpose of the Supervised Visitation Program 
is to provide a safe, substance-free, closely-
monitored and controlled environment for children 
to have contact with their parent. The Supervised 
Visitation Program is not intended to be a long-term 
solution to maintaining contact between a parent 
and child. Referrals are time-limited, with a court 
date scheduled for reviewing the matter to avoid 
putting unnecessary restrictions on a parent’s access 
to their child for long periods of time. 

When the period of supervised visits is over, 
Family Services will review the information 
provided by the visitation supervisor and help 
parents put together a long term visitation/access 
plan. The Family Relations Counselor will also 
prepare a report that lets the Court know that the 
period of supervised visitation is finished and will 
share any visitation/access plan the parents agree to 
for the future.

Transitions in Parenting

The Transitions in Parenting (TIP) program deals 
with the complex emotional issues involved when a 
parent re-enters a child’s life after a long separation 
or enters the child’s life for the first time. 

TIP is not therapy, but rather a program that 
provides a supportive environment and professional 
guidance for families during the process of 
establishing or re-establishing relationships 
between a child and a once absent parent. The 
goal is to help the parent and child to develop 
the groundwork for a relationship that is healthy, 
positive, and able to be maintained over time. 

This program is free and intended for parents 
involved in the Family Court who are struggling 
financially. Most families’ involvement in the 
program lasts for three months. If parents agree 
to participate in the TIP program the Judge will 
make that agreement a court order. The family 
is then referred to meet with a Family Relations 
Counselor who will act as a liaison between the 
court and contracted service provider. The Family 
Relations Counselor will explain the process and 
their role to the parents, connect the family with 
the contracted service provider, and will report on 
the progress being made to the court. 

As part of TIP, several meetings will be scheduled 
by the contracted provider for the parents and 
child. The TIP provider will talk about possible 
strategies for maintaining and strengthening this 
relationship. The TIP provider will also discuss 
progress with the parents at various points in the 
process. 

Most families will return to Court after the first 3 
months in TIP to review the progress being made. 
After the TIP program has ended for the family, 
the Family Relations Counselor may meet with 
the parents to see if they can agree to a regular 
visitation/access schedule. Some families may 
need to move to a more structured access plan, 
and a referral to the Supervised Visitation Program 
may be the next step. The Family Relations 
Counselor will prepare a report that lets the Court 
know that the family has finished TIP and will 
share any visitation/access plan or next steps the 
parents agree to for the future.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
