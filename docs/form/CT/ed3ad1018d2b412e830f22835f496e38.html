A joint publication of  the Connecticut 
Judicial Branch, Division of  Superior Court 
Operations and The State of  Connecticut 
Department of  Labor.

To help employees, employers, and the 
unemployed through the jury service 
process, this pamphlet has been written 
by the Connecticut Judicial Branch and 
the Connecticut Department of  Labor 
to answer some questions commonly 
asked by employees, employers, and the 
unemployed. This publication is strictly 
informational and is not intended as 
legal advice. Jury Service is vital for the 
operation of  the courts!

To make sure that jury service is 
convenient for both the employee and 
the employer, both should talk to each 
other as soon as the employee receives  
a jury summons. Many jury service issues 
can be resolved through open and frank 
communication and cooperation between 
employees and their employers.

If  you have other questions, please 
contact Jury Administration directly at 
1-800-842-8175, or the Department of
Labor at 860-263-6790.

We hope you find the information in 
this publication helpful.

ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS

Q: Why is jury service important?
A: Jury Service is one of  the cornerstones of  
a free society. By supporting their employees 
through jury service, employers are helping to 
preserve the right to a jury trial for all citizens.

Q: When does jury service begin?
A: Jury Service begins with the 1st day that a 
person reports for jury service, whether or not the 
employee is selected to serve as a juror at trial.

Q: Must employers allow their employees 
to attend jury service?
A: Yes. Connecticut law prohibits employers 
from dismissing, threatening or coercing 
employees who are summoned for jury service, 
respond to a jury summons, or serve as a juror. 
Any employer who does so is subject to criminal 
penalties. Any employer who dismisses an 
employee can be sued by the employee for lost 
wages and reinstatement. (Section 51-247a of  the 
Connecticut General Statutes.)

Q: Are jurors paid for their service?
A: Yes. Full time employed jurors (those 
normally required to work at least 30 hours 
per week) are paid their regular wages by their 
employers for the first 5 days of  jury service. 
Beginning on the 6th day of  jury service, all 
jurors are paid $50.00 per day by the state, 
regardless of  their employment status.

Q: Is there a penalty if  an employer refuses 
to pay an employee for the first 5 days of  
jury service?
A: Yes. Any employer refusing to pay a full 
time employee for jury service can be sued by 
the employee and may be subject to criminal 
penalties. (Section 51-247a of  the Connecticut 
General Statutes.)

Q: What if  an employer cannot afford to 
pay an employee who is performing jury 
service?
A: An employer may apply to the Superior 
Court for a waiver of  obligation to pay. A 
waiver form is attached to the certificate of  
juror service each juror receives. 

If  the waiver is granted, the state will pay the 
amount the court finds to be the juror’s regular 
wages, up to $50 per day, for the first 5 days 
of  jury service. On the 6th day of  jury service, 
all jurors receive $50.00 per day from the state, 
regardless of  employment status. 

Q: Should the time spent by an employee 
in jury service be counted as hours worked 
by an employer for purposes of  calculating 
overtime wages for an employee?
A: No. Connecticut law does not require an 
employer to include payments made for jury 
service into an employee’s regular rate for 
purposes of  overtime calculations. (Section 
31-76b (1) (B) of  the Connecticut General 
Statutes.)

Q: How long will jury service take?
A: Most jurors finish their service in 1 day. If  
selected for a trial, service may vary from 1 to 
several days to several weeks or longer. Long 
trials are extremely rare.

Q: May a juror be required to return to work 
if  he or she is dismissed by the court early 
in the day?
A: Yes. Potential jurors should talk to their 
supervisors as soon as possible after getting a 
summons to learn their employer’s policies about 
returning to work. In requiring an employee 
to return to work, employers should take into 
account factors such as the time of  day the juror

is released, travel time from the court and whether 
a change of  clothes might be necessary.

Q: Can an employee who works evenings or 
other non-standard work hours be required 
to report to work after performing eight 
hours of  jury service?
A: No. Any juror who has been at court 
for 8 hours of  jury service is considered to 
have worked a legal day’s work. This means 
employers cannot require their employees to 
work beyond 8 hours unless they have agreed to 
do so. (Section 51-247a (b), of  the Connecticut 
General Statutes.)

Q: May an unemployed juror continue to 
receive unemployment compensation while 
performing jury service?
A: Yes. Jurors continue to receive unemployment 
benefits while they serve. On the 6th day of  jury 
service, however, the unemployment benefit is 
reduced by 2/3 of  the amount paid by the state 
for jury service.

Q: Is there any proof  that a juror performed 
jury service on a particular day?
A: Yes. A juror service certificate is mailed to each 
juror soon after serving. If  a juror needs proof  
immediately, the jury clerk can give the juror a note 
indicating the date of  service and the time the 
juror was dismissed from the courthouse.

Q: Are self-employed individuals or sole 
proprietors required to serve?
A: Yes. No one is disqualified from serving 
based on employment status. It is possible to 
postpone jury service to a time of  year that is 
more convenient to serve. Jurors also have the 
opportunity to discuss their hardships with the 
court on the day of  their appearance.

Q: Who pays self-employed jurors?
A: Self-employed jurors may apply to the Superior 
Court for a waiver of  obligation to pay. A waiver 
form is attached to the certificate of  juror service 
each juror receives. 

If  the waiver is granted, the state will pay the 
amount the court finds to be the juror’s regular 
wages, up to $50.00 per day, for the first 5 days 
of  jury service. On the 6th day of  jury service, 
all jurors receive $50.00 per day from the state, 
regardless of  employment status.

Q: How are jurors, whose regular wages 
consist of  commissions, paid for jury service?
A: An average of  commissions paid per day is 
calculated based on the previous month’s earnings. 
The daily rate is paid to the juror by the employer 
for the first 5 days of  jury service.

Q: Where can I get more information?
A: Call Jury Administration toll-free at 1-800-842-
8175, or the Connecticut Department of  Labor at 
860-263-6790.
