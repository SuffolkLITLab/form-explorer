Laws and the Courts

Welcome from the Chief  Justice

You are now going to learn about the 
Connecticut court system. This is a very 
important area for you to learn about because 
the courts affect people’s lives in many 
different ways – even children’s.

The most important thing about our courts is 
that judges protect everybody’s rights – your 
parents, your neighbors, your teachers and 
yours too. This is a very important role in a 
democracy and our government relies on the courts to ensure that 
everyone is treated fairly under the law.

This book will tell you what you need to know about laws and why 
we need them; who makes, enforces and interprets the law; what  
the different types of  courts are and who are the people in the 
Superior Court. By the time you finish with this workbook, I am 
certain that you will not only have learned about our state courts,  
but have had a lot of  fun doing so.

Very truly yours,

Chase T. Rogers
Chief  Justice

Rule of Law

A society is a group of people living in a community.

In our society, we have a set of rules called laws. One example of a law is the law  
requiring children to attend school. Another example of a law is the law that prohibits 
people from stealing.

The government is the body that makes laws and enforces laws. This means that 
the government decides what the laws will be and makes sure that everyone follows 
them. A government can function successfully only when people respect the laws. 

Our society is based on the Rule of Law. This means that everyone is required to obey 
the law. Senators, judges, the police and even the president must follow the laws. It 
doesn’t matter what the person does for a job. Everyone must follow the laws.

We need laws to keep order and protect  
us, our property and our rights.

Laws and the CourtsWhy do we need laws?

There are many reasons why our society needs laws.

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

l	Laws protect us and our property from others. Without laws, there
  would be no written rules to protect you or your belongings from harm.

l  Laws make people responsible for their actions. This is like you being  
responsible for following the rules your parents or your teachers make.
 

l  Laws ensure order. Without laws, people could do whatever they
  wanted. Life could be very confusing and even dangerous. For example,
  what do you think it would be like if drivers ignored stop signs and    
 

stop lights?

Constitution: 

A document that explains the rules and principles of a government.

The U.S. Constitution established our  
government. It is the document that  
created the three branches of government—  
Legislative, Executive, and Judicial.

In the United States, there  
are three different levels  
of government—  
Federal, State and Local.

Laws and the CourtsWho makes, enforces, and… interprets the laws?
Three Different Branches  

Connecticut State Capitol

An example of a state law is the law that requires passengers in a car to wear seat belts. Most 
states have similar state laws, however, what is allowed in one state might not be allowed in 
another state.

Towns and cities also have local legislative bodies, known as town councils or city councils, 
that make ordinances. An example of a local ordinance is a curfew.

A curfew is a rule that restricts people from being out of their home after a given time or in 
a certain place. This means that they cannot be out on the street.

Executive Branch

The executive branch of government enforces the laws. The head of the executive branch 
for the federal government is the president of the United States. The head of the state gov-
ernment is the governor and local governments are usually led by a mayor or first selectman.

  l  The head of the executive branch for the federal government is the president. 

  l  The head for the state government is the governor. 

l  The head for the local government is the mayor or first selectman. 

Laws and the Courts

Legislative Branch

The legislative branch of government makes the laws. 
There is a legislative branch at the federal level which 
is called Congress. Laws created by Congress are called 
federal laws. These laws apply to everyone living in the 
United States.

Federal law is the highest law of the land. This means 
state and local governments cannot make laws that  
go against federal law. 

An example of a federal law is the law that makes it a 
crime to treat someone differently based on their age, 
gender or race. 

The Connecticut General Assembly is the legislative 
branch on the state level. Laws made by the General  
Assembly are called state laws. These laws apply to  
everyone inside the borders of the state of Connecticut.

of Government

Judicial Branch

The Judicial Branch of government consists of the  
courts. The role of the courts is to resolve disagreements 
and determine if someone is guilty of breaking a law.

The courts also look at the laws and determine what  
laws mean. This is called interpreting the law.

Courts exist at the federal level and at the state level. 
The highest federal court is the U.S. Supreme Court  
and the highest state court is the Connecticut  
Supreme Court.

Connecticut’s court system has three levels. 

This three-level process is how legal  
disagreements are settled in Connecticut.

It can be compared to  
a three-layer cake. 

The first level—or bottom 
layer of the cake—is called 
the Superior Court. Almost 
all court cases in our state 
start in the Superior Court.

Laws and the Courts

15

Laws and the CourtsWhat are the different types of courts?
Superior Courts

Superior Courts are where trials take place.

In a trial, a judge or a jury hears two sides of an issue. The judge or jury then decides 
which side is right based on the law and the evidence presented.

A judge is the person who is in charge of the courtroom. He or she hears both sides  
of an issue and decides who is right.

A jury is a group of people who are asked to come to the courthouse to hear both 
sides of an issue and decide who is right. 

Evidence is used to show the judge or jury what really happened. It can be a docu-
ment, a photograph, a videotape or DVD and testimony.

Testimony consists of statements that are made at the trial by witnesses. 

A Witness is a person with knowledge of what happened.

Superior Courts:  
The courts in Connecticut 
where legal cases begin. 

There are Superior 
Court Courthouses in 
many Connecticut
cities and towns.

At the end of a trial, the judge or jury makes a decision.

 

 
 

l  The decision could be who is at fault in a car accident, or

l  The decision could be whether someone is guilty of a crime  
  and must go to jail.

16

Laws and the Courts

What are the different types of courts?
The Appellate Court

An appellate court is a court that 
reviews decisions of a lower court  
to see if mistakes were made.

In Connecticut, we have two  
appellate courts - The Connecticut 
Appellate Court and the Connecticut 
Supreme Court.

The Connecticut Appellate Court 
would be the second layer of the cake.

The role of the Appellate 
Court is different from the 
role of the Superior Court.
Trials do not take place in the 
Appellate Court.

The Appellate Court is made 
up of nine judges. A panel of  
three judges review the de-
cisions made in the Superior 
Court to see if they are correct.

This is the Appellate Court in Connecticut,  
which is located in Hartford.

Laws and the Courts

17

Laws and the CourtsWhat are the different types of courts?
The Appellate Court

(continued from page 17)

The Appellate Court judges do this by reading information about the case that is 
written by the parties. This information is called a legal brief.

The judges also let the attorneys present their side of the issue in “oral argument.” 
Oral argument is an opportunity for the parties’  lawyers to explain to the judges why 
the Superior Court judge either correctly followed the law or why the judge made a 
mistake. The lawyers do this by speaking to the judges and discussing the law. 

Evidence is not presented to the Appellate Court judges. There are no juries in the  
Appellate Court. 

After the lawyers have presented their case to the Appellate Court, the judges 
write a decision. 

This decision will either “affirm” or “reverse” the decision of the Superior Court. 

If the Appellate Court decides that the Superior Court did not make any mistakes, 
it will “affirm” the decision.

If the Appellate Court decides that the Superior Court made a mistake, it will  
“reverse” the decision. 

In most instances, a decision from the Appellate Court is the end of the legal case.

The Supreme Court

Supreme Court building located in Hartford.

The Supreme Court is the highest court in Connecticut.  
Justices of the Supreme Court review decisions of the  
Superior and the Appellate courts to see if any mistakes  
were made.

We have one Supreme Court in Connecticut. It would be the top layer of the cake.

The Supreme Court is also an appellate court, because it reviews decisions of lower 
courts to see if any mistakes were made.

The Supreme Court is made up of seven judges called “justices.”

The Supreme Court listens to cases in the same way that the Appellate Court listens to cases. 

Lawyers try to persuade the justices why the Appellate Court, or in some cases the  
Superior Court, made the right or wrong decision in the case. 

Laws and the Courts

19

Laws and the CourtsWhat are the different types of courts?
The Supreme Court

(continued from page 19)

Like the Appellate Court, no evidence is presented to the Supreme Court. And, there 
are no juries in the Supreme Court. 

If the Supreme Court finds that a mistake has been made, it can order the Superior 
Court to start the case all over again, from the beginning.

Once in a while, the Supreme Court of the United States will review decisions of the  
Connecticut Supreme Court. 

But, in almost every case, it is our Connecticut Supreme Court that will have the final 
say on the law.

As you learned in Section 
Three, the Superior Court 
is the first level of the 
court system. 

When people are arrested, or when people can’t  
resolve their disagreements, they first go to the  
Superior Court.

There are different types of cases. A civil case is a 
case that involves people who disagree. An example 
of a civil case is an injured person looking for money 
from the person who caused the harm. 

A criminal case occurs when someone is arrested 
and charged with breaking a law. In these cases we 
say that the person has committed a “crime against 
the state,” and so the state brings the case against 
the person charged with the crime.

27

Laws and the CourtsWho are the people in the Superior Court?

There are many people who work in a court system  
and each person has an important job to do.

First, there is the judge. The judge wears a black robe  
and sits at the front of the courtroom behind the bench. 

The judge is like a referee at a ball game. The judge makes 
sure that everyone follows the rules in the courtroom. 
Sometimes, the judge is the person who listens to both 
parties’ arguments and decides on the best outcome.

For example, if two people come to court because they disagree about mon-
ey, the judge might be the person who finally decides who gets  
the money.

Other times, a group of people decides who wins the argument. These 
people are called jurors. Jurors are everyday people who come to court 
to listen to each side of a disagreement. Then the  
jurors decide how the disagreement will be settled.

A group of jurors is called a jury. Citizens of Connecti-
cut who are over the age of 18 can be called to serve 
on a jury.

28

Laws and the CourtsWho are the people in the Superior Court?

The prosecutor is the lawyer who tries to prove that the person accused 
of the crime is guilty. The prosecutor works for the government.

When people go to court, they often have lawyers. Lawyers give advice 
to people on the law. They also speak for someone who has to come to 
court. This is called “representing” the person.

You can probably spot the judicial marshal easily. The marshal wears a 
uniform, like a police officer’s uniform. The marshal can be found either at 
the front door of the courthouse checking people as they come inside, or in 
the courtroom to help keep order.

What would happen if you had to go to court and you didn’t understand 
what was being said? That would be very difficult and unfair. Courts have 
interpreters for people in a court case who don’t speak or understand 
English. The interpreter’s job is to translate what is said in court. 

The court recording monitor is responsible for recording what every-
body says in court with a recording device. The court monitor also types 
up what is said. This document is called a transcript. 

All courts have clerks as well. A court clerk organizes the papers about  
the cases. The clerk keeps track of the decisions or orders.

Witnesses are people who come to court to tell what they  
have seen or heard. They take a special seat and the lawyers  
ask them questions.

Connecticut courts are open to the public. So it is not 
uncommon to see members of the public in the gallery,  
or the section of the courtroom where they may sit.

Assignment

Follow the assigned script. Then, a jury will meet to decide the case.

The Case of the Missing Puppy

Facts
Mr. and Mrs. Green hired Amanda Barber, age 18, to baby-sit their 
son Mikey and their puppy Spot for the day. 

They told Amanda to play with their son, to make him lunch, and to  
be sure their dog was tied up outside for fresh air and exercise. 

While Amanda was preparing a sandwich for the child, the frisky 
dog broke free and ran away. 

The Greens blame Amanda for carelessness and want her to give 
them the cost of the puppy.

Issue
Is it Amanda’s fault that the dog got loose? Or, is it the owner’s fault for  
giving Amanda a rope that wasn’t strong enough to hold their dog?

JUDGE: Will the plaintiff’s lawyer please make his/her opening statement to the jury?

PLAINTIFFS’ LAWYER: Good morning ladies and gentlemen of the jury. My name is

In this case, we will prove that Amanda Barber was not careful and did not do the things  
she promised the Greens she would do. She lost their dog, Spot, and she is to blame.

JUDGE: Will the defendant’s lawyer please make his/her opening statement to  
the jury?

DEFENDANT’S LAWYER: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my name is _______________

PLAINTIFFS’ LAWYER: Your honor, I will first call the plaintiff, Mrs. Green.
(The Judicial Marshal brings the witness to the Court Clerk.)

COURT CLERK: Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing  
but the truth?

MRS. GREEN: I do.

PLAINTIFFS’ LAWYER: Mrs. Green, please tell us what happened.

MRS. GREEN: My husband and I needed a baby sitter. We called Amanda Barber. She  
told us that she knew how to take care of children and pets.

We told her to tie our new puppy Spot outside for a while, so he could get some exercise. 

Later she told us that the rope was worn-out and Spot got loose and ran away. 

Our Dalmatian was very expensive, and our son is very upset. This is all Amanda’s fault!  
She should pay for a new dog.

PLAINTIFFS’ LAWYER: Thank you, Mrs. Green. Your honor, next I will call a neighbor,  
Mr. Brown. (The Judicial Marshal brings the witness to the Court Clerk.)

COURT CLERK: Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing  
but the truth?

MR. BROWN: I do.

PLAINTIFFS’ LAWYER: Mr. Brown, please tell us what you saw.

MR. BROWN: On the day that the Greens’ puppy was lost, I was looking out my window.

I saw the little Green boy and his puppy playing outside in the yard. Soon, four children rode 
into the Greens’ driveway on bikes.

The baby sitter let them come in. I saw that they forgot to close the gate.

That’s probably how the dog got out, but I didn’t see it happen. Later I heard the baby sitter 
call Spot, but she couldn’t find him.

36

Laws and the CourtsPLAINTIFFS’ LAWYER: Thank you, Mr. Brown. The plaintiffs rest your honor.

JUDGE: The defense lawyer may now call his/her first witness.

DEFENDANT’S LAWYER: First I call the defendant, Amanda Barber.
(The Judicial Marshal brings the witness to the Court Clerk.)

COURT CLERK: Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth, and  
nothing but the truth?

AMANDA: I do.

DEFENDANT’S LAWYER: Amanda, please tell us what happened.

AMANDA: I am 18 years old and a very good sitter for kids and pets. When I was at the 
Greens’ house, I followed all their directions. I tied up their Dalmatian with the rope they  
left me. Then I went inside to make lunch for Mikey. 

While Mikey was taking a nap, I went outside to get Spot, but he wasn’t there. 

The worn-out rope had torn and he ran away. I looked all over for him, but I couldn’t  
go far because Mikey was in the house asleep.

 I am very sorry this happened, but it is not my fault! The Greens should have given  
me a stronger rope.

DEFENDANT’S LAWYER: Thank you, Amanda. Your honor, next I will call Mrs. Castle,  
Amanda’s Girl Scout leader. (The Judicial Marshal brings the witness to the Court Clerk.)

COURT CLERK: Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing  
but the truth?

MRS. CASTLE: I do.

DEFENDANT’S LAWYER: Mrs. Castle, please tell us about Amanda.

MRS. CASTLE: I am a Girl Scout leader. Last year Amanda Barber earned a Pet Care  
badge by taking care of my dog for two weeks.

She gave him food and water, she played with him and she gave him treats. It was easy

Laws and the Courts

37

Laws and the CourtsMRS. CASTLE:  (continued)
for me to see that she cares for animals very much and would never harm them.

I don’t think she would do anything to cause someone’s pet to be lost.

DEFENDANT’S LAWYER: Thank you, Mrs. Castle. That is all, your honor. The defense rests. 

JUDGE: We have heard the lawyers and all of the witnesses. The lawyers will now give the 
jury their closing arguments.

DEFENDANT’S LAWYER: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the plaintiff did not prove that 
Amanda was careless. 

Mrs. Castle testified that Amanda was careful with her dog. She put Spot outside like she was 
supposed to, but the Greens gave her a worn-out rope. She is not responsible for losing Spot.

PLAINTIFFS’ LAWYER: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, by listening to the evidence today, 
you should decide that Amanda Barber was not paying attention to Spot.

She never checked on the dog while he was tied outside. 

She should pay for a new puppy for the Greens.

JUDGE: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you have heard all of the evidence.

Now it is time for you to decide whether or not Amanda Barber is at fault for the loss of 
Mrs. Green’s dog.

If you find that she was at fault, you will need to decide whether she should pay to  
replace him.

Before you decide, you must ask yourself three questions: 
 
 
 
(Jury meets outside the courtroom, discusses the issues and makes a decision and returns.)

1. Was Amanda not acting responsibly?
2. Do you believe that everyone has told the truth?
3. Are you more than half sure that your decision is right?

JUDGE: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a decision?

JURY FOREPERSON: Yes, your honor.
(Decision is announced and reasons may be given.)
