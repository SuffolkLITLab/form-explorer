INSTRUCTIONS FOR DECLARATION IN SUPPORT OF ESTABLISHING PARENTAGE 
 

 

PURPOSE OF THE FORM: 
 

This declaration supplements the Uniform Support Petition to provide evidence to establish parentage.  A separate 
Declaration in Support of Establishing Parentage is required for each child needing parentage establishment.  Reminder: 
  
A person who claims to be the child’s parent may petition for parentage establishment under UIFSA.  A person should 
 
complete the form to the extent that he or she has information. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

This form includes information that may pose a significant risk to an individual if made available in a public forum or inappropriately 
 
disclosed.  This form may be filed with the petition or pleading, but should not be filed or included in a record available to the 
 
general public.  The information on this form may be disclosed to the parties in the case unless accompanied by a nondisclosure 
 
finding/affidavit. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
If you are not the intended recipient, you are hereby notified that any use, disclosure, distribution, or copying of this form or its 
contents is strictly prohibited. 

   

 

 

 

THIS FORM CONTAINS SENSITIVE INFORMATION – DO NOT FILE THIS FORM IN A PUBLIC ACCESS FILE. 
 

 

 
DO NOT COMPLETE THIS FORM IF THERE IS AN ORDER OF PARENTAGE OR A SIGNED VOLUNTARY 
ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF PARENTAGE. 

   

 
NOTE:  An order of parentage can include a divorce decree or an adoption order as well as a tribunal support order. 

 

 

 

 

 
The Personal Information Form for UIFSA § 311 must be attached. 

 

 
Italicized text that appears within a “box” refers to policy or provides additional information. 

 

 

 

 
For a foreign address, be sure to include the country and postal code as part of the address. 

 

 

 

 

Tribal IV-D programs may choose to use the federal Intergovernmental forms.  However, they are not required to use 
or accept such forms.  If you have any questions, contact the tribal IV-D agency directly using the contact information 
   
 
on the OCSE website. 
 
Where forms request a locator code, note that tribal locator codes uniquely identify tribal cases with “9” in the first 
 
 
position, 0 (zero) in the second position, and then a 3-character tribal code defined by the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
(BIA). 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   
HEADING/CAPTION: 

 
name of the tribe with which the petitioner or respondent is affiliated. 

•  Identify the petitioner and respondent by full legal name (first, middle, last, suffix), and if applicable, include the 
 
 
 

 
•  Check the appropriate box to identify the type of case: TANF, IV-E foster care, Medicaid only, former assistance, never 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
assistance, or non-IV-D. 
 

 

TANF means the obligee’s family is currently receiving IV-A cash payments.  A Medicaid only case is a case in 
which the obligee’s family receives Medicaid but does not receive TANF.  A former assistance case might be a case 
for state arrears only or for a family that previously received TANF, but is not doing so at this time. 
 

  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

•

•  In the appropriate spaces, if applicable and if known, enter the responding jurisdiction’s IV-D case identifier and tribunal 
 
 

 

 

number. 
  

The responding jurisdiction is the jurisdiction that is working the case at the request of the initiating jurisdiction.  Under 
 
“IV-D case identifier,” enter the number/identifier identical to the one submitted on the Federal Case Registry, which is 
a left-justified up to 15-character alphanumeric field, allowing all characters except asterisk and backslash, and with 
all characters in uppercase.  Under “tribunal number,” you may enter the docket number, cause number, or any other 
 
appropriate reference number that the responding tribunal may use to identify the case, if known. 
 
  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
•  In the appropriate spaces, enter the initiating jurisdiction’s IV-D case identifier and, if applicable, tribunal number.

The initiating jurisdiction is the jurisdiction that referred the case to the responding jurisdiction for services. 
 
Under “IV-D case identifier,” enter the number/identifier identical to the one submitted on the Federal Case Registry, 
 
which is a left-justified up to 15-character alphanumeric field, allowing all characters except asterisk and backslash, 
 
and with all characters in uppercase.  Under “tribunal number,” you may enter the docket number, cause number, or 
  
any other appropriate reference number that the initiating tribunal has assigned to the case. 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In the “NOTE:” section, check any of the following that apply: 
 
 

 

 

 

•  Nondisclosure Finding/Affidavit attached - If there is a finding prohibiting disclosure of a party’s or 
 
 
child(ren)’s address/identifying information or an affidavit alleging that disclosure of such information would result in 
 
risk of harm, check the box for “Nondisclosure Finding/Affidavit attached” and attach a copy of the finding/affidavit in 
 
accordance with section 312 of UIFSA.  If there is a finding/affidavit prohibiting disclosure, the information must be 
sealed and may not be disclosed to the other party or the public.  You may provide the address of the IV-D agency as 
 
 
a substitute address for the protected party. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

UIFSA requires that the petition or accompanying documents include certain identifying information regarding the 
parties and child(ren) (e.g., residential address, social security number) unless a party alleges in an affidavit or a 
pleading under oath that the health, safety, or liberty of a party or child would be jeopardized by disclosure of such 
information.  In that event, the information must be sealed. 
 
If a jurisdiction has reason to believe that information should not be released because of safety concerns, it should 
 
ensure that there is a nondisclosure finding or an allegation in an affidavit or the pleading that disclosure of 
identifying information would result in a risk of harm, as provided under section 312 of UIFSA.  In addition to 
 
identifying information included on this form, it may be appropriate to submit certain financial information under seal. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  This form sent through EDE – Check if this Declaration was also sent through the Electronic Document Exchange 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(EDE). 
 

CSENet and EDE transactions are the recommended methods for making requests or sending information to 
another state.  If CSENet is not listed as an option on the form, then it cannot be used to convey any of the 
 
requests or information provided on the form.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Supporting documentation should be sent through EDE, whenever possible. 

       

               

             

Complete a separate declaration for each child needing parentage established. 
 

 

Complete the declaration to the extent that you have the information. 
 

Section I.  Declaration:  (Information to be completed or furnished by a parent of the child.) 
 

  

 

 

 

 

Enter the full legal name (first, middle, last, suffix) of the person completing the Declaration.  Complete the form to the 
extent you have information. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

Item 1:  Check whether you are the biological or nonbiological parent of the child and indicate your gender.  Gender is defined 
as “Female”, “Male”, or “Other”.  Select “Other” if you do not identify as “female” or “male”.  A nonbiological parent may be the 
same-sex spouse or partner of a parent or the intended parent in a surrogacy.  If you are not a parent of the child, check “Other” 
and explain your relationship to the child in section IV.  For example, you may be a relative or caretaker of the child or a Foster 
 
Care or IV-D agency worker. An agency or tribunal representative (such as a Foster Care or IV-D agency worker) may complete 
and sign the form if no parent or custodian is available or cooperative. If you checked “Other,” also explain in Section IV the 
   
basis for alleging the respondent is the parent. Section II provides examples of the type of information needed.

establishment of parentage.

States, include the name of the country in this field. 
“Full term pregnancy” - Check “Yes” or “No” to indicate if the pregnancy lasted nine months.  If no, explain in section IV 
 
 
(e.g., 6 months - child born premature).

“Birth certificate attached” - Check “Yes” or “No” to indicate if the birth certificate is attached.  The birth certificate should be 
attached.  If it is not, you must explain in section IV. 
 

 

 

 

 
Item 2:  Check whether the respondent is the biological or nonbiological parent of the child named above. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

Item 3:  Enter the full legal name of the birth mother and the full legal name of the person with whom the birth mother had 
 
sexual intercourse that resulted in the conception of the child.  If the child was conceived using assisted reproduction or a 
 
surrogate parent, describe all pertinent information regarding the conception of the child in section IV. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The information in Item 4 is intended to identify whether there is a presumed parent under state law.  That individual 
 
may be the respondent or another person.  The law of the responding state will govern whether and how a 
 
 
presumption of parentage is created.  The more common grounds are covered by the following questions. The 
  
responding state may require additional information. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 
4a:  Check “Yes” or “No” to indicate whether the biological mother was married and the child was born during the 
 
marriage or within 300 days after the marriage legally ended.  If yes, and the mother’s spouse/former spouse is not 
the respondent named in this Declaration, provide the name, address, and gender of the spouse/former spouse, and 
 
explain in the space below why he/she is not the child’s parent.  Provide the dates the marriage began and legally 
 
ended and provide supporting documentation.  Identify the tribunal state and county that issued the order legally 
 
 
ending the marriage, for example, a divorce decree or annulment. 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
4b:  Check “Yes” or “No” to indicate whether a person acted as, and presented himself/herself to be, the child’s 
 
 
parent.  If yes, and the individual is not the respondent named in this Declaration, provide the individual’s name, 
address, and gender, and explain in the space below why the individual is not the child’s parent. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 
 
4c:  Check “Yes” or “No” to indicate whether a court or IV-D agency completed genetic testing to determine the biological 
parent of the child.  If yes, include the probability of parentage from the test in the space provided and attach the test 
results.  If genetic tests were completed and the individual tested is not the respondent named in this Declaration, provide 
 
the individual’s name, address, and gender, and explain in the space below why the individual is not the child’s parent. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

Item 5:  Check “Yes” or “No” to indicate whether another person, other than the birth mother, is named on the child’s birth 
  
certificate.  If yes, provide the individual’s name, address, and gender. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

Item 6:  Check “Yes” or “No” to indicate whether there is a voluntary acknowledgment of parentage, executed with regard to 
this child, which has been rescinded.  The name of the document varies, but in every state unmarried parents may sign an 
 
 
acknowledgment of parentage.  State law varies on whether same-sex parents can sign an acknowledgment of parentage in 
 
order to legally determine parentage.  If you check “Yes,” attach a copy of the rescinded acknowledgment.  Provide the name, 
address, and gender of the individual(s) who signed and later rescinded the acknowledgment.  NOTE:  If there is a signed
 
 
voluntary acknowledgment of parentage that has not been rescinded, you should not be completing this form.  You 
already have a legal determination of parentage.
