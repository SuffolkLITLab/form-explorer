SUPPORT 
ENFORCEMENT 
SERVICES

We are here to help you.

Our Mission

The mission of  Support Enforcement Services 
is to help parents in getting financial and medical 
support for their children by providing quality 
services and information to the court, our 
customers, and the community in a courteous, 
efficient, and effective manner, that is sensitive 
to the contributions both parents make to their 
children’s development.

What services do we offer?

• Monitor compliance with support orders
•  Locate noncustodial parents

•  Enforce support orders through income
withholding and contempt applications

•  Enforce medical insurance and child

care orders

•  Review support orders for modifications

•  Establish and enforce interstate

support orders

Q:   What can I do if  I cannot pay my child 

support order?

A:   If  you are having trouble making your child 
support payments, you should discuss your 
situation with a support enforcement officer. If  
you ask (through a written request or by phone), 
Support Enforcement Services (SES) can review 
your child support order to see if  it needs to 
be modified (changed). You may also start the 
modification process on your own by filing a 
motion to modify with the court. SES can give you 
a pamphlet, How to Change Your Child Support Order, 
form JDP-FM-218, to help you with the process. 
Finally, you can also hire an attorney to help you 
with a modification.

Q:   What should I do if  I am laid-off  or cannot 

work because of  an illness or injury?

A:   You should contact your support enforcement 

officer to discuss your situation. If  you were laid-
off, SES can transfer your income withholding to 
Unemployment Compensation and help start a 
review for a change to your support order.  
If  your injury or illness is work related, SES  
can transfer your income withholding to Workers’ 
Compensation.

Q:   The court ordered an income withholding. 

What is this?

A:   An income withholding is an order for your 

employer or other payer of  income to withhold 
(subtract) the amount for the child support 
directly from your pay or income. Your employer 
will send your support payments to the State 
Disbursement Unit (SDU) for processing for you.

Q:   The court ordered an income withholding, but 
my employer is not withholding the support. 
What should I do?

A:   Start by asking your employer if they got the 
withholding order. Maybe your employer did 
not get the withholding order, or maybe they are 
ignoring it. In either case, you should contact your 
support enforcement officer to talk about this 
situation. Also, it is important that you make your 
payments when the support is not withheld from 
your earnings. You can get information on how to 
make your payments by calling 1-888-233-7223.

Q:  What is a medical support order?
A:    A medical support order is a court order for 
either parent or both parents to (1) get or pay 
for health care coverage for the child through 
their employer or through the state benefit plan 
under HUSKY B, (2) pay cash medical support 
for (an amount toward the medical support 
of) the child, and/or (3) pay an amount for, or 
a percentage of, dental and medical costs for 
the child that are not covered by insurance or 
reimbursed (paid back) in any other way under 
the Connecticut Child Support Guidelines. 

Q:  How is the medical support order enforced?
A:    SES will notify (tell) your employer of  the need 
to place your child on your health insurance plan 
(if  a plan is offered) by mailing them a National 
Medical Support Notice (NMSN). In addition, 
any cash amounts that you must pay for with 
HUSKY reimbursement or cash medical 
support may be withheld from your earnings 
through an income withholding order. Finally, you 
may be summoned (called in) to court if  you 
do not pay your cash medical support, HUSKY 
reimbursement, or un-reimbursed health care 
cost orders.

Q:  How does my child care order work?
A:    The most common child care order says that 
you must pay a percentage towards the child 
care costs (for example, if  the cost of  child 
care is $100, and you are responsible for 40%, 
the dollar amount of  the order is $40). If  you 
are ordered to pay child care costs, and you 
do not, the court may change your child care 
order into a fixed amount, and add it to  
your income withholding order.

 

child support order?

Q:  How does a second family affect a  
 
A:    According to the Connecticut Child Support 
Guidelines, at the time a child support order 
is created, a noncustodial parent’s second 
family will be reflected in the support 
calculation. However, once the child  
support order has been created, a second 
family is not considered a valid reason to 
modify (change) the support order for the 
first family.

Q:   How does being incarcerated affect a  

child support order?
 

A:   The child support order continues to  

be in effect while a noncustodial parent  
is in prison. Any payments not made  
during the period of  incarceration will  
be added to the total amount of  child 
support owed. If  an inmate asks to  
modify (change) the order, Connecticut 
law requires that the inmate’s income at the 
time that the motion is made be used to 
determine the child support order. Inmates 
can call SES at 1-800-228 KIDS (5437)  
for help in modifying (changing) their 
support order.

my child support payments?

A:   The fastest and easiest way to get information 
about a support payment is to call the Child 
Support Information Line at 1-888-233-
7223. The Information Line can give you 
information about when a payment was 
made, the amount, and when your payment 
was processed. If  you need a more detailed 
accounting of  your support payments, please 
contact SES.

has many tools to enforce your child support 
order; some involve the courts and some 
do not. If  you do not make your support 
payments you may be summoned (called in) to 
court to tell the court why you have not paid. 
This is called a contempt action. The best way 
to avoid court action is to pay your support on  
time every time that it is due – including your 
medical and child care orders. 

here are also non-court related enforcement 

actions that the Child Support Enforcement 
Program may use to collect child support. 
These include intercepting (getting) your tax 
refunds, seizing (taking hold of) your bank 
accounts, reporting you as a debtor (someone

my support order?

A:   The Child Support Enforcement Program 

Who do I need to tell?

A:   The law requires that you report your new 

employer or mailing address to SES. We will 
update our records so we can keep you informed 
about your child support case. If  you have an 
income withholding order, we will mail it to your 
new employer or other payer of  income so your 
child does not go without support.

:   Can I pay the child support directly to the 

custodial parent?

  Q

Enforcement Program is managing your case, 
all child support payments must go through the 
SDU to make sure that you get the correct credit 
for your payment. However, the court may order 
you to make certain types of  payments directly 
to the custodial parent. For example, if  you are 
responsible for child care or medical costs, these 
are often paid directly to the custodial parent. 
If  you do make a court ordered direct payment, 
SES recommends getting a receipt from the 
custodial parent showing how much you paid 
and when. If  you have any questions about if  
you should make a direct payment, review your 
court order or contact SES.

Q:   When does the child support order end?
A:   In general, support created by a child support 
order ends when the child turns 18. However, 
this general rule may be different in other states. 
For example, in Connecticut, the duty to support 
may go until age 19 if  the child is still in high 
school. Please contact SES for more information 
about the length your child’s support order.

A:   In general, no. If  the Child Support
