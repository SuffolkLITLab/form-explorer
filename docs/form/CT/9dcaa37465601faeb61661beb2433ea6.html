The Role of the Courts
The judicial system in Connecticut is established to 
uphold the laws of the state. Our courts help to keep 
order in our society by:

•  Determining the guilt or innocence of persons 

accused of breaking the law

•  Resolving disputes involving civil or personal rights

•  Interpreting constitutional provisions of laws enacted 
by the legislature or deciding what is to be the law  
of the state when none exists for certain situations. 
The court decision then becomes a precedent, a 
principle established in an earlier case. If a case is 
close in facts or legal principles to an earlier case, the 
court applies the precedent unless the precedent is 
overruled or modified by the Supreme Court or the 
General Assembly. 

•  Determining whether a law violates the constitution of 
either the State of Connecticut or the United States. 

Separation of Powers
Under our constitution, the courts are one of three 
branches of government. The legislative branch (the 
Senate and House of Representatives) creates new laws. 
The executive branch (the governor and executive 
branch agencies) enforces them. The judicial branch 
interprets and upholds our laws.

State Courts vs. Federal Courts
In Connecticut, as throughout the United States, 
there are two judicial systems. One is the state system, 
established under the state constitution; the other 
is the federal system, established under the United 
States Constitution. Connecticut courts are courts of 
general jurisdiction, meaning that they handle most 
criminal matters and a variety of civil matters, including 
contracts, personal injury cases, divorce (called 
“dissolution of marriage”) and other legal disputes. 
In some instances, decisions of state courts may be 

appealed to the United States Supreme Court if there is 
a question of federal constitutional law.

Federal courts handle matters involving federal law 
and the following matters: cases brought by the United 
States, cases between two states or the citizens of two 
different states, cases between a state and a foreign state 
or its citizens, admiralty and maritime cases, and cases 
affecting ambassadors and other diplomatic personnel.

Organization of the Courts
Supreme Court

The Supreme Court is the state’s highest court. It 
consists of the Chief Justice and six associate justices. 
In addition, justices who are eligible and who have not 
yet reached the age of 70 may choose to take senior 
status. Since the September, 2009 term, the Supreme 
Court hears and decides all cases en banc, meaning 
as a full court of seven justices, unless there are 
disqualifications. When one justice is disqualified, the 
court will sit as a panel of six. When two justices are 
disqualified, the court will sit as a panel of five. When 
there are not enough Supreme Court justices or senior 
judges available because of disability, disqualification or 
unavailability, a judge or senior judge of the Appellate 
Court or a judge of the Superior Court may be chosen 
by the Chief Justice to sit as a member of the Supreme 
Court to hear a particular case.

The Supreme Court reviews selected decisions of the 
Appellate Court. It also reviews certain issues that 
cannot otherwise be appealed, such as summary 
criminal contempt judgments or a trial court ruling 
against someone who is not a party to the case.

Generally, the Supreme Court does not hear witnesses 
or receive evidence. It decides each case on:

•  The record of lower court proceedings;

•  Briefs, which are documents prepared by a lawyer or 
party on each side of a dispute to explain to the court 
the key points of each party’s case; and

•  Oral argument based on the content.

Connecticut’s Courts | 3

The state constitution defines which matters can be 
brought directly to the Supreme Court without an 
appeal, such as a challenge to redistrict the state House 
of Representatives. When a case is brought directly to 
the Supreme Court, it is described as being brought 
under its original jurisdiction.

State law specifies which types of appeals may be 
brought directly to the Supreme Court from the 
Superior Court, thereby bypassing the Appellate Court. 
These cases include, but are not limited to: decisions 
where the Superior Court has found a part of the  
state constitution or a state statute invalid and  
election disputes. 

The Supreme Court may transfer to itself any matter 
filed in the Appellate Court and may agree to review 
decisions of the Appellate Court through a 
process called certification. Except 
for any matter brought directly to the 
Supreme Court, under its original 
jurisdiction, the Supreme Court may 
transfer any matter pending before it to 
the Appellate Court. 

The Supreme Court has eight two week 
sessions over the period from September 
through May of each year. The dates of each 
session are posted on the Judicial Branch website: 
http://www.jud.ct.gov. The Supreme Court courtroom 
is located in the Supreme Court Building at 231 Capitol 
Avenue in Hartford.

Appellate Court

The Appellate Court, like the Supreme Court, reviews 
decisions made in the Superior Court to determine if 
errors of law have been committed.

There are nine Appellate Court judges, one of whom 
is chosen by the Chief Justice to be Chief Judge. The 
Connecticut General Statutes allow for ten judges of the 
Appellate Court when the Chief Court Administrator is 
a judge of the Appellate Court. In addition, judges who 
are eligible and who have not reached the age of 70 may 

choose to take senior status and remain as members of 
the court. Generally, three judges hear and decide each 
case, although the court may also sit to hear a case with 
all members. When this happens, it is called hearing a 
case “en banc.” Like the Supreme Court, the Appellate 
Court does not hear witnesses but makes its decision 
based upon the record, briefs and oral argument.

Appellate Court sessions are held in the Appellate Court 
courtroom at 75 Elm Street in Hartford.

Superior Court

The Superior Court hears all legal disputes except those 
disputes which, by law, only the Probate Court can 
decide.1 Probate Court matters may be appealed to the 
Superior Court.

The state is divided into 13 judicial districts and 
20 geographical areas. There are also juvenile 
districts statewide. In general, major 

criminal cases, civil matters and family 
cases that are not juvenile matters 
are heard at judicial district court 

locations. Other civil and criminal 
matters are heard at geographical area 

court locations. Cases involving juvenile 
matters are heard at Juvenile Court locations.

The Superior Court has four principal trial divisions: 
civil, criminal, family and housing.

Civil Division

A civil case is usually a matter in which one party 
sues another to protect personal or property rights. 
Examples of typical civil cases include landlord-tenant 
disputes, automobile accidents, personal injury, medical 
malpractice and contract disputes.

In most civil cases, the party that filed the case 
(plaintiff) seeks to recover money damages from 
another party (defendant). Cases may be decided by the 
judge or by a jury, depending on what type of case it is 
and what the parties would like.

1 See page 12.

4 | Connecticut’s Courts

The Civil Division is divided into five parts:

Housing Division

•  Landlord-tenant, including evictions  

(called “summary process”);

–  Felonies – punishable by prison sentences of more 

•  Housing code enforcement by tenants;

•  Violations, including motor vehicle – punishable by 

•  Criminal jury and non-jury, involving housing  

•  Small claims;

•  Administrative appeals;

•  Civil jury; and

•  Civil non-jury

Criminal Division

A criminal case is one in which a person (defendant) is 
accused of breaking the law. The two sides in a criminal 
case are the state, represented by a state’s attorney 
(because crimes are considered acts that violate the 
rights of the entire state), and the defendant.

The following types of cases are heard in the Criminal 
Division:

•  Crimes

than one year

–  Misdemeanors – punishable by prison sentences of 

not more than one year

fine only

•  Infractions – fine may be paid by mail without 

requiring a court appearance (for example, traffic 
tickets)

Generally, the most serious criminal matters, such as 
murder, are tried in the judicial district courts, which 
are also called J.D. courts. Geographical area courts, 
which are also called G.A. courts, typically handle all 
criminal arraignments, misdemeanors and certain 
felonies. In addition, G.A. courts handle motor vehicle 
matters, infractions and violations that require a  
court appearance.

2  The Housing Session for the Judicial District of Fairfield is located 
in Bridgeport.

3  The Housing Session for the Judicial District of Stamford-Norwalk 
is located in Norwalk.

Cases involving housing are heard in special housing 
sessions in the Fairfield,2 Hartford, New Britain, New 
Haven, Stamford-Norwalk3 and Waterbury judicial 
districts. In all other judicial districts, these cases are 
part of the regular civil docket.

Clerks in the housing session can help parties by 
providing booklets that explain court procedures, while 
housing mediators try to work out problems between 
landlords and tenants. If asked by the court, housing 
mediators can inspect where the tenant lives and assist 
the parties with finding financial help so they can do 
what is needed to follow court orders.

The following types of housing matters are heard at 
judicial district housing session locations:

•  Summary process (eviction);

•  Housing small claims (for example, for return of a 

security deposit);

•  Civil jury and non-jury (for example, actions for back 
rent, property damage and return of security deposits, 
administrative appeals and receiverships); and

code violations

Family Division

The Family Division is responsible for deciding family 
relations matters and juvenile matters in a fair and 
timely manner. Examples of family relations matters 
include: divorce (called “dissolution of marriage”), 
dissolution of civil unions, legal separation, visitation 
of children, paternity, name changes, child custody, 
relief from abuse (temporary restraining orders), and 
family support payments. Juvenile matters include 
delinquency, child abuse and neglect, and termination 
of parental rights.

Connecticut’s Courts | 5

Juvenile Matters

Community Court in Hartford

Juvenile Matters is a special subdivision of Superior 
Court and has juvenile courts statewide. It is designed to 
protect the rights of children and family relationships, 
and all records are confidential. 

Cases in Juvenile Court include: 

•  Termination of parental rights;

•  Delinquency; 

•  Neglected or uncared for children and youth;

•  Families with service needs; and

•  Emancipation of a minor 

Special Sessions of the  
Superior Court
The Superior Court has eight special sessions: 

Child Protection Session 

There are two Child Protection Sessions: one in 
Middletown and one in Willimantic. The Child 
Protection Session accepts child protection cases 
referred by local juvenile matters judges. The referral 
criteria include: age of the case, significance of the 
action (termination of parental rights is the most 
important), and complexity of the case.

Complex Litigation Docket

The Judicial Districts of Hartford, Stamford-Norwalk 
and Waterbury currently have Complex Litigation 
Dockets. This docket handles civil cases with many 
parties and/or legally challenging issues. A party can 
apply to have a case referred to this docket. If the case 
is accepted, it is assigned to an individual judge, who 
handles all aspects of the case.

Land Use Litigation Docket

The Judicial District of Hartford has a Land Use 
Litigation Docket for planning and zoning matters, 
inland/wetlands/environmental enforcement and 
miscellaneous land use litigation. In addition, certain 
affordable housing appeals are transferred to this 
docket, as appropriate.

6 | Connecticut’s Courts

The Judicial Branch and local authorities work together 
on matters in the Community Court to address “quality 
of life” crimes that impact local neighborhoods. 
Those crimes include breach of peace, criminal 
mischief, prostitution, criminal trespass, and larceny 
(shoplifting). Most defendants who are convicted of 
these crimes in the Community Court are ordered to 
perform community service, instead of being sent to 
jail and/or being ordered to pay fines. For example, 
defendants may work on street clean-up crews or help 
deliver food to the needy. The court also requires all 
defendants to meet with a member of the Community 
Court Social Services Team.

Domestic Violence Dockets

Prosecutors, family relations counselors, domestic 
violence victim advocates, and representatives of law 
enforcement work together on matters that are on this 
docket and meet regularly. Defendants are required to 
return to court frequently to make sure that they are 
following court orders.

Housing Session (See Housing Division, 
page 5)

Regional Family Trial Docket

The Judicial District of Middlesex has the Regional 
Family Trial Docket. It handles contested custody and 
visitation matters referred to it from any judicial district 
in the state. One judge presides over and manages the 
docket. The goal is to handle contested cases involving 
children quickly and without interruption. Cases are 
referred to the Regional Family Trial Docket by the 
family presiding judge when they meet the program 
criteria: involving a child focused issue; being ready for 
trial; having a family relations case study completed, the 
case is not more than nine months old; and an attorney 
has been appointed for the children.

Tax Session

The Tax Session is located in the Judicial District of 
New Britain. It handles estate and municipal tax appeals 
and appeals from state administrative agencies under 
the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act.

Steps in a Jury Trial
Selection of a Jury
  Potential jurors take an oath that they will answer 

  Presentation of evidence

–  Testimony: attorneys ask witnesses questions on 

direct and cross-examination

questions truthfully. This oath is called the “voir dire 
oath.” Voir dire means to speak the truth.

–  Exhibits

 Closing arguments

  Potential jurors are questioned by the attorneys for 
the parties, without the other jurors being in the 
room. This questioning is called “voir dire.”

  When the attorney for a party does not want 
a certain potential juror to be on the jury they 
“challenge” the potential juror. There are two types  
of challenges:

– For cause (for a reason)

–  Peremptory (without giving a reason)

  Completion of jury selection

Judge’s Charge to the Jury
  Explanation of the law to the jury

  Review of the procedures for the jury to use in 

reaching the verdict

Jury Deliberation
  Led by the jury foreperson, who is elected by 
members of the jury to deliver the verdict to  
the court

  Free discussion by jurors, who are to listen with  

–  Civil trials and most criminal trials: 6 jurors, 2 

alternates (sometimes more alternates)

open minds

–  Certain serious crimes: 12 jurors, 2 alternates 

(sometimes more alternates)

  When the jury is chosen for a case, it is “impanelled.” 
The jurors take an oath, and the judge gives them 
directions regarding their duties.

The Trial
  Opening statements: generally short statements, 

made by the attorneys for each side

The Verdict
  The verdict (the formal finding or decision of a jury) 
must be unanimous in civil and criminal cases, 
meaning all the jurors must agree

  The verdict is written in civil cases and said out loud 

by the foreperson in criminal matters

  The jury foreperson presents the verdict to the court 

by reading or saying the verdict

Connecticut’s Courts | 7

Attorneys appointed by the Chief Court Administrator 
to hear certain contract cases.

Fact Finders

Arbitrators

Attorneys appointed by the Chief Court Administrator 
to hear any civil jury action in which the judgment is 
reasonably expected to be less than $50,000.

Special Masters

Individuals designated by an administrative or 
presiding judge to conduct settlement conferences or 
mediation in areas such as tax, family relations and 
construction on a pro bono basis (free of charge).

Funding for the Courts
The Judicial Branch receives its funding as part of the 
legislatively enacted state budget. 

All fines, fees and costs collected in the courts are 
deposited into the state’s general fund and other funds 
established by the legislature.

Judges – Appointment and Terms
Judges of the Supreme Court, the Appellate Court and 
the Superior Court are nominated by the governor from 
a list of candidates submitted by the Judicial Selection 
Commission and are confirmed by the General 
Assembly. They serve eight year terms and are eligible 
for reappointment. To qualify to become a judge, a 
person must be a Connecticut resident and registered 
voter and an attorney admitted to practice law in 
Connecticut. He or she must also meet certain other 
qualifications, such as having a reputation for the truth, 
faithfulness, honesty, integrity and fair dealing.

The Connecticut Constitution provides that judges may 
not hold their offices after reaching the age of 70. At 
that time, they retire and become state referees for the 
rest of their terms. They are eligible for reappointment 
as state referees during the rest of their lives. The Chief 
Justice may choose, from among the state referees, 
judge trial referees, to whom certain cases may be 
referred. Judges who retire from full-time active service 
prior to age 70 are known as senior judges.

Non-judicial Officers

Not all legal disputes are heard by judges. They may also 
be heard by the following:

Small Claims Commissioners

Attorneys designated by the Chief Court Administrator 
to hear and decide small claims cases if the parties agree.

Attorney Trial Referees

Attorneys appointed by the Chief Justice to preside over 
civil non-jury matters. They may not render judgments 
but, rather, make findings of fact and file proposed 
decisions with the court. The court may render 
judgment in accordance with these findings.

Magistrates

Attorneys appointed by the Chief Court Administrator 
to hear small claims matters, certain motor vehicle 
infractions and violations, certain other violations and 
certain non-jury motor vehicle cases.

History of Connecticut’s Courts
The first Connecticut judicial proceedings probably were 
held on April 26, 1636, at “A Corte holden in Newton” 
(Hartford) under the commission granted to eight 
leaders by the General Court of Massachusetts Bay.

In 1638, the General Court established the Particular 
Court (often called the “Quartet Court” because it 
was required to meet every three months). While the 
General Court, later called the General Assembly, 
controlled the administration of justice, the Particular 
Court was the principal judicial body until the union 
of the New Haven and Connecticut colonies and the 
granting of the Charter from Charles II in 1662.

In 1665, with the new Charter, the Particular Court was 
abolished and two new levels of courts were established: 
the Court of Assistants in 1665, and the county courts 
one year later. Separate probate courts were established 
in 1698 to handle such matters as wills and estates.

The Court of Assistants was abolished in 1711. Its 
powers of original and appellate jurisdiction were 
assumed by the newly created Superior Court, the 
forerunner of the sole trial court of general jurisdiction 
which exists in Connecticut today.

During the period between the Revolutionary War and 
the adoption of the Connecticut Constitution in 1818, 
significant developments in the direction of creating an 
independent judiciary took place.

In 1784, the Supreme Court of Errors was created as the 
highest appellate tribunal of the state, with the power 
to review lower court cases based on a writ of error, a 
power previously held by the General Assembly.

In 1818, the first Connecticut Constitution was 
adopted, setting forth the doctrine of separation of 
powers and establishing the three separate branches 
of government. This constitution created “a Supreme 

Court of Errors, a Superior Court, and such inferior 
courts as the general assembly shall from time to time 
ordain and establish.”

County courts were abolished in 1855 and their 
functions were transferred to a strengthened Superior 
Court. As the number of cases continued to increase, 
however, the General Assembly found it necessary to 
create a series of Courts of Common Pleas.

The development of the state, county and municipal 
courts was paralleled by the important contributions of 
the justices of the peace, who first came into use about 
1686. By the end of the century, justices were commonly 
authorized to take jurisdiction over small actions, 
and they played a vital part in the judicial system for 
more than 250 years. As towns were incorporated, the 
General Assembly authorized the creation of town and 
borough courts, presided over by justices of the peace, 
to handle small cases. In 1939, the trial justice system 
was enacted, vesting the limited criminal jurisdiction 
formerly within the power of all justices of the peace in 
specially designated trial justices.

In 1921, Connecticut’s first juvenile courts were 
established in several towns, and in 1942, a statewide 
Juvenile Court came into existence.

In 1941, the General Assembly enacted legislation to 
establish a single Court of Common Pleas for the entire 
state with judges subject to periodic reassignment on a 
statewide basis. Prior to this legislation, judges sat only 
in the counties to which they had been appointed.

When the General Assembly abolished county 
government in 1960, the municipal courts and trial 
justice system were replaced by a statewide Circuit 
Court. The three level system of state, county and 
municipal courts was dissolved in favor of a completely 
state-maintained system.

On December 31, 1974, the Circuit Court was merged 
with the Court of Common Pleas. Circuit Court judges 
were elevated to the Court of Common Pleas. This 
consolidation was followed four years later by the 
merger of the Court of Common Pleas and Juvenile 
Court with the Superior Court on July 1, 1978. 
Common Pleas and Juvenile Court judges became 
judges of the Superior Court. The Superior Court thus 
became the sole trial court of general jurisdiction in the 
state and Connecticut acquired the first unified court 
system in the country.

In 1982, the state constitution was amended to establish 
the Appellate Court to help ease the caseload burden on 
the Supreme Court. The new court began hearing cases 
the following year.

Probate Court
In addition to the state-operated courts, Connecticut 
has Probate Courts. Probate Courts have the power to 
hear and make judgments in certain types of cases, such 
as: the estates of deceased persons, testamentary trusts, 
adoptions, conservators, commitment of the mentally 
ill, guardians of the persons and estates of minors  
and those with intellectual disabilities, and certain 
name changes.

Each Probate Court has one judge who is elected to a 
four year term by the electors of the probate district. 
Probate judges elected after January 5, 2011, must be 
attorneys admitted to practice law in Connecticut. 
Probate judges who are not attorneys are allowed to 
continue to serve if they were in office on January 4, 
2011. Probate judges are paid for their services from 
court fees.
