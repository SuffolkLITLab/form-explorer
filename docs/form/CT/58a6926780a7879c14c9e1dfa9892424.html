self-represented litigants. (Section 51-52 (d) of the Connecticut General Statutes). 
A list of the clerks’ offices is on page 7. 

Clerks will help you as much as they can, but they cannot act as your attorney. 
You are responsible for any actions you take when you represent yourself. The 
clerks’ offices are not responsible for any errors in the forms provided to you or in 
these instructions. 

If you feel you need more information or help, you should talk to an attorney or 
read the appropriate sections of the Connecticut General Statutes and Connecticut 
Practice Book. If you want an attorney to represent you and do not know the name 
of an attorney in your area go to page 9. Go to page 9 for the legal aid offices 
closest to where you live if you want an attorney to represent you but cannot afford 
to hire one. 

The clerks’ offices of the judicial district courts are prohibited by law from providing 
help to self-represented individuals other than the information contained in these 
instructions or in official forms. A list of the judicial district clerks’ offices is on

PROCEDURES TO FOLLOW TO REPRESENT YOURSELF IN 
AN ENTRY AND DETAINER (LOCKOUT) CASE 

1.   Read these instructions carefully and completely before filling out any of the 

forms related to this type of lawsuit.

2.   The first step in representing yourself is to fill out the form called Verified 
Lock-Out Complaint and Application for Temporary Injunction (Form  
JD-HM-24, see sample on page 4). You are known as the “plaintiff ” and your 
landlord is known as the “defendant.” Once you have read and understand 
what these papers say, fill in all the blank spaces and check off all of the boxes 
that apply to you. The complaint must be signed in front of a clerk, notary 
public, or attorney and verified by you under oath.

3.   Up to three orders will be given to the judge to review with your verified 
complaint. See Entry and Detainer Proceedings Summons and Order to 
Show Cause (Form JD-HM-23 on page 5). These orders will be filled out 
by the Clerk’s office after you fill out the top part and appearance section of 
the form. The first order, the Summons, sets a court hearing date that will 
be no more than 8 days from the date the judge signs the order. This form 
orders the defendant (landlord) to come to court at the date and time in the 
Summons. You must also be in court on that date and time. Your landlord 
may bring an attorney to represent him or her. You have the same right if  
you want an attorney to represent you. The second order is an Order to  
Show Cause which also orders the landlord to be in court on the day of  
the hearing.

PROCEDURES TO FOLLOW TO REPRESENT YOURSELF IN AN ENTRY 
AND DETAINER (LOCKOUT) CASE (continued)

 
The third order is the Ex-Parte Temporary Injunction (Form JD-HM-37, 
on page 6). This may order the landlord to let you back into your residence 
immediately after he/she receives the order from the marshal or other proper 
officer, and/or may order the landlord to do something else. If the judge signs 
the Ex-Parte Temporary Injunction, it may stay in effect until a hearing is 
held in court on the date and time in the Summons.

 
The summons and order to show cause and the ex parte temporary 
injunction, if then you decide to file it, will be given to the judge by the clerk 
with your completed verified complaint and application. It is up to the judge 
to decide whether or not he or she will sign any of these papers. 

4.   If you do not have the money to pay the entry fee for your case or the 

marshal’s or other proper officer’s fees, you may ask the court to waive these 
fees by filing a completed Application for Waiver of Fees (form  
JD-CV-120). The application must be signed in front of a clerk, notary public, 
or attorney and be verified by you under oath. These papers will be given with 
your other papers to the judge for his or her approval and signature.

5.   Once the judge gives the papers back, you must have them served on the 

defendant by a marshal or other proper officer. Unless waived by the court, 
there is a fee to have the papers served by a marshal or other proper officer 
(approximately $45.00- $60.00). You must also pay the entry fee of $175.00 at 
this time, unless the fee has been waived by the court.

6.   It is important that you get the name of the marshal or other proper officer 
who is serving (delivering) the papers for you. Also, you must have the 
papers returned to the Clerk’s office before the court hearing date. It is 
recommended that the papers be returned to the clerk’s office at least 2 full 
working days before your hearing date.

PROCEDURES TO FOLLOW TO REPRESENT YOURSELF IN AN ENTRY 
AND DETAINER (LOCKOUT) CASE (continued)

7.   On the day of the hearing listed in the Summons be in court on time and 
ready to go forward with your case (that is, to show that you have been 
locked out illegally). You should bring all witnesses and/or evidence that 
may support your claims. The evidence may consist of rent receipts, written 
leases, cancelled rent checks, or any people who may have visited you at 
the residence you claim to be locked out of. Bring anything you consider 
important or related to your case. If a witness will not agree to come to 
court, you may request that the court issue a subpoena ordering the witness 
to come to court for the hearing. You should file a completed Application 
for Issuance of Subpoena (form JDCL-136) with the clerk’s office at least 
3 days before the scheduled hearing date. The subpoena must be served 
(delivered) on your witness at least 18 hours before the time of your hearing. 
The marshal or other proper officer will charge a fee to serve (deliver) the 
subpoena. You can request this fee be waived by completing an Application 
for Waiver of Fees.

 
Your landlord has a right to be at the hearing. Both you and your landlord 
will be given a chance to give your side of the lawsuit. The judge will decide 
the case based on all the evidence.

8.   You may also wish to bring a separate small claims lawsuit if your money 

damages equal $5000.00 or less. The Clerk’s office can supply you with forms 
and instructions. If your damages are more than $5000.00, you should talk 
with an attorney to represent you in a civil action.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
