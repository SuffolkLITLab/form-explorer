      <pre>VISITOR’S GUIDE
The Connecticut Supreme Court

231 CAPITOL AVENUE, HARTFORD

The mission of the State of Connecticut 
Judicial Branch is to serve the interests of 
justice and the public by resolving matters 
brought before it in a fair, timely, efﬁcient  
and open manner.

The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is the head of the  
Judicial Branch. 

The Chief Court Administrator manages the day-to-day  
operations of the Judicial Branch.

Visiting the Supreme Court

The Supreme Court is located at 231 Capitol Avenue in Hartford. Members of the 
public are invited to attend oral arguments. The Judicial Branch provides tours of the 
Supreme Court courtroom from Monday through Friday during regular business 
hours. To obtain the schedule of cases, please visit the Judicial Branch’s website at 
www.jud.ct.gov. To arrange a tour, please call the External Affairs Division at  
(860) 757-2270.

While You Are in the Courtroom  
Observing Arguments

If you plan to observe Supreme Court arguments, please 
remember that the justices and attorneys are engaged in a 
discussion of very complex issues requiring their undivided 
attention. Therefore, please observe the following:

◆   Do not create any noise or engage in conversation.
◆   Do not bring food or beverages into the courtroom.
◆   Turn off all cell phones.
◆   Do not use cell phones, cameras, audio recorders or any 
other electronic device to take or broadcast pictures, 
videos or sound recordings in the courtroom unless you 
are a member of the media and are in compliance with 
the Connecticut Practice Book as well as the Supreme 
Court’s Guidelines for the Possession and Use of Electronic 
Devices. Please note that if you are visiting the Supreme 
Court courtroom for a tour or lecture, cameras are 
permitted.

◆   Do not engage in casual reading.
◆   Give your full attention to the court.

History of the Court

Prior to the creation of the Supreme Court in 1784, the 
power to review lower court rulings was vested in the 
General Assembly, which determined appeals by examining 
trial court records. Even after its creation, the Supreme 

Court was not completely independent of the executive  
and legislative branches, since its members included  
the Lieutenant Governor, members of the Council (or  
upper chamber of the General Assembly), and, in 1794,  
the Governor.

In 1806, the number of Superior Court judges was increased 
from ﬁve to nine and those judges, sitting together, 
constituted the Supreme Court, replacing the Governor, 
Lieutenant Governor and Council Members. The General 
Assembly, however, retained the power to overturn the 
court’s rulings. Twelve years later, in 1818, the Connecticut 
Constitution established an independent judiciary, with 
the Supreme Court of Errors as the state’s highest court. 
(The words “of Errors” were deleted in 1965). The creation 
of an independent judiciary established the third branch 
of government, which is responsible for interpreting the 
laws enacted by the legislative branch of government. The 
Connecticut Supreme Court is comprised of one chief 
justice and six associate justices.

In 1982, in response to an overwhelming Supreme Court 
docket, Connecticut’s voters approved a constitutional 
amendment creating the intermediate Appellate Court. That 
court, which consists of nine judges, is at 75 Elm Street  
in Hartford.

The Supreme Court hopes that your visit today  
is interesting, informative and rewarding.

The Supreme Court can  
transfer to itself any appeal

for any matter brought under its 
original jurisdiction under article 
sixteen, § 2, of the amendments 
to the Constitution, the 
Supreme Court may transfer  
any matter from itself to

How Do Cases Come to the  
Supreme Court?

The Supreme Court is the court of last resort for the State of 
Connecticut. Almost always, the cases heard in the Supreme 
Court have ﬁrst been decided in the Superior Court, which 
is a trial court where a judge or a jury considers conﬂicting 
stories from witnesses who describe the history of their 
dispute. The losing party in the Superior Court has the right 
to appeal to another court. Most of these appeals go ﬁrst to 
the Appellate Court, the intermediate court of appeals.

Appeals come to the Supreme Court in one of three ways. 
A person who disagrees with the judgment of the Appellate 
Court can ask the Supreme Court to take another look 
at the legal issues in dispute by ﬁling a request that the 
appeal be considered. This request is called a petition for 
certification. The Supreme Court does not grant every 
request to hear an appeal. It will grant a request only where 
there are special and important reasons. Other appeals 
come here as a result of this court’s decision to transfer 
the case to itself instead of having it heard in the Appellate 
Court. Lastly, some appeals, because of their extreme 
signiﬁcance (e.g. how voting districts are determined), are 
automatically heard ﬁrst by the Supreme Court.

After the parties are allowed to appeal, each party ﬁles a 
brief or briefs, and the court then schedules the case for oral 
argument at the next available session. On occasion, the 
court will hear a case right away, because, for example, it 
involves urgent issues, such as a pending election. 

What Happens In Oral Argument?

If you listen to an oral argument in the Supreme Court, 
you will notice that it differs from an oral argument in 
the trial court. In the trial court, the lawyer addresses a 
jury or a judge, urging the jury or judge to make certain 
ﬁndings of fact. In the Supreme Court, the lawyer requests 
the justices to reach certain conclusions of law. Before an 
oral argument, each justice has already carefully studied 
the written briefs that present each party’s legal arguments, 
as well as the factual and procedural history of the case. 

Consequently, the justices may ask many questions in 
order to fully understand the positions argued by each 
party. Although the justices sometimes ask about the facts, 
the discussion between the lawyers and the court usually 
centers on issues of law.

What Happens After Oral Argument?

After hearing oral arguments, the justices gather in their 
conference room to reach a preliminary decision about  
the outcome of each case. The Chief Justice then assigns 
each case to one of the justices in the majority to prepare  
a draft opinion.

Preparing a draft opinion takes time because it requires 
careful analysis of the law and the facts to develop a 
persuasive written document for the court and the parties.

Once the draft opinion is completed, the other justices who 
heard the case review it and make extensive comments. 
Because the cases often present difﬁcult questions of law, the 
justices may disagree and write separate opinions. A justice 
who agrees with the outcome, but not with the analysis of 
the majority opinion, writes a separate concurring opinion. 
A justice who disagrees with the outcome, in whole or in 
part, writes a separate dissenting opinion. A ﬁnal opinion 
is voted on at a court conference after all the opinions 
have been reviewed by the other justices and agreed upon. 
The majority opinion and the separate opinions are then 
sent to the Reporter of Judicial Decisions. The Reporter 
checks the opinions for technical accuracy, then sees to 
their publication on the Judicial Branch website and in the 
Connecticut Law Journal. The parties receive courtesy e-mail 
notification from the Reporter of the upcoming publication 
of the opinion in their case.

The Connecticut Law Journal is published weekly on the 
Judicial Branch website. After their initial publication in 
the Connecticut Law Journal, the opinions are published 
in bound volumes in Connecticut Reports. The Connecticut 
Law Journal and Connecticut Reports are available at Judicial 
Branch law libraries. 

The Courtroom

The Supreme Court courtroom is 43 feet wide, 56 feet long 
and 35 feet high. Most of the wood in the room is oak. The 

state seal can be seen on many 
of the wall panels, the lamps 
and the carpet. Included in the 
seal is the motto, Qui transtulit 
sustinet – “He who transplanted 
still sustains.” The portraits on 
the walls are those of the most 
recently retired chief justices.

The two murals that dominate the room were painted 
by Albert Herter and placed in the building upon its 
completion in 1913. Behind the bench is The Signing of  
the Fundamental Orders of the Constitution 1638-39.  
The Orders – the ﬁrst written constitution of the United 
States – were drawn up by Thomas Hooker, Roger Ludlow 
and John Haynes. Hooker is shown standing and addressing 
the gathering. Ludlow, the secretary, is seated, while 
Haynes stands in the background with a copy of the new 
constitution in his hand. In the corners of the mural are 
the seals of England, seventeenth-century Connecticut and 
modern Connecticut.

The ceiling mural is entitled An Allegory of Education.  
At the top, a mother is seated with the Book of Knowledge 
and Experience in her lap and her child by her side. On  
her left sits the Spirit of Wisdom, on her right, the Spirit  
of Progress.

The center portion shows two young men bearing ﬂaming 
torches that represent the Light of Education gained from 
the Book of Knowledge and Experience. They are going 
forth into life’s activities, urged on by the Spirits of Wisdom 
and Progress. The bottom portion of the mural shows two 
ﬁgures, representing Ignorance and Superstition. They 
appear confused as they fall farther and farther into the 
darkness as the light of education advances.
