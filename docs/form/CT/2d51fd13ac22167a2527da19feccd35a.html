      <pre>Getting Help from the State 
 
Child Support Program to 
 
Change Your Order 

If your court order is being enforced by Support 
Enforcement Services (SES), then you are 
part of the State of Connecticut Child Support 
Program. If so, there is another way to get your 
order changed. If you ask SES, they will gather 
income information to see if your order may 
need to be changed. If it looks like it needs to be 
changed, SES will prepare the court forms and 
tell you the court date. SES will also serve the 
court papers on the other parent. You will have 
to go to the court hearing. 

For more information, call the 
 
Child Support Call Center at

How to 
Change Your 
Child Support 
Order 

If you believe that your child support 
order is too low or too high, this 
pamphlet may help. You can get 
help from the state Child Support 
Program or do it on your own. First, 
to find out if this pamphlet can help, 
please answer these questions: 

1. What state was the original order from, and 

 
where does the other parent live? 

	  Was your child support ordered by a 
 
   
q Yes  q No 
Connecticut court? 
 
 

	  Does the other parent live 
   
 
in Connecticut? 
 

q Yes  q No 

 

 

If you answered no to either question, please 
stop. This pamphlet is not for you. For 
information on how to change an out-of-state 
child support order, call the Child Support 
Call Center at 1-800-228-KIDS (5437). 

If you answered yes to both questions, 
please continue. 

 

2. Is there a reason to change the order? 

	  Has your income changed very much 
 
   
q Yes  q No 
 
(either up or down)? 

 

	  Has the other parent’s income changed very 
   
much (either up or down)?  q Yes  q No 

 

 

	  Has the cost of taking care of your child 
   
 
 
changed very much? 

q Yes  q No 

 

 

 

	  Is your support order at least 15% higher or 
   
lower than the amount required by the child 
support guidelines because of changes to either 
parent’s income or the cost of taking care of 
q Yes  q No 
 
your child? 

 

 

 

If you answered no to all the questions – this 

booklet is not for you. 


If you answered yes to at least one question, 
then keep reading. This booklet will give you 
the steps to ask for a change in your order. 

 

Asking for a Change on Your Own 

It may seem like a lot of work, but asking for a 
change in your child support order is really just a 
set of smaller steps. The steps are: 

 Gather the proper forms 

 Fill out the forms 

 File the forms with the court clerk’s office 

 

 Get the papers “served” (officially delivered) 

 Gather information for your court hearing 

 Go to court for your hearing 

You may also want to read the Connecticut Child 
Support and Arrearage Guidelines. If the support 
order was issued by a Family Support Magistrate, 
or if you have applied for state services through 
the Department of Social Services, you may 
also want to read the Judicial Branch pamphlet, 
What Happens When You Go to Family Support 
 
Magistrate Court.

Note: You can find more information on what 
to bring if your case is in Family Support 
Magistrate Court in the Judicial Branch 
pamphlet, What Happens When You Go To 
Family Support Magistrate Court. 
 

Step 6. Go to court for 
 
your hearing 

If your hearing is with a Judge, when the Judge 
calls the name of your case, stand up and say 
“Ready, Your Honor.” Judges usually require 
both parties to meet with a family relations 
counselor, who is a trained mediator, even 
if you have reached an agreement. If you 
reach an agreement with the help of a family 
relations counselor, be sure to go back to the 
courtroom and report it to the Judge so that 
it can be approved by a Judge and become a 
court order. If you do not reach an agreement, 
return to the courtroom and tell the Judge. 

When your case is announced, go to the front 
of the courtroom with any papers that you have 
brought with you. You will have to testify in 
order to explain your case to the Judge. The 
courtroom clerk will swear you in (ask you to 
swear to tell the truth). Answer respectfully 
any questions the Judge asks and do not 
interrupt the Judge. 

If your hearing is in Family Support Magistrate 
Court, the best way to understand what will 
happen at your hearing is to read the Judicial 
 
Branch pamphlet, What Happens When You 
  
Go To Family Support Magistrate Court. 
That pamphlet answers many common 
 
questions, and it is available on line at 
www.jud.ct.gov/publications/fm209.pdf.  Ü

 

A proper officer, for example a State Marshal, 
must “serve” (officially deliver) the papers on the 
other parent. You can get a list of State Marshals 
on the Judicial Branch website at www.jud.ct.gov/ 
faq/marshals.htm or from the Clerk’s Office or 
the Court Service Center. If the court decided that 
you do not have to pay the fees, then the State will 
pay the officer, otherwise, you must pay. After the 
officer delivers the motion to the other party, he or 
she will give you back the original paperwork. You 
must return that paperwork to the Court Clerk with 
the filing fee or the Application for Waiver of Fees 
 
if the court decided that you do not have to pay 
the fees. 

At this point, your motion has been served 
(officially delivered) and you are waiting for your 
court hearing. You will need to fill out a Financial 
Affidavit form before your hearing. Gather your 
pay stubs and bills and use them to fill out the 
Financial Affidavit. The Financial Affidavit gives 
the court a detailed summary of all your income, 
assets (property), and bills (amounts you owe). 

It is a good idea to bring the following things with 
you to your court hearing: 

q Your pay stubs from the last 13 weeks, 

q Information on any benefits you get (for example, 
 
 
Social Security Benefits, SAGA cash assistance, 
 
or Unemployment Compensation), and 
 

   

q Proof of any medical reasons that may be 

  
keeping you from working. 

Step 5. Gather information for 
 
your hearing 

Pamphlets with additional information can be 
found at www.jud.ct.gov/pub.htm. 

• At the courthouse from the Court Clerk’s Office 

 
or a Court Service Center. 
The Court Service Centers also have staff that 
can help you fill out the forms and answer 
questions about how the process works. 

 

Step 2. Fill out the forms 

Sit down in a quiet place and read all the forms 
so you have an idea of the information you need. 
After you have read them, start filling them out. 

If you have any questions about what the form is 
asking for, you can ask the staff at a Court Service 
Center in the courthouse. The Court Service Center 
staff can answer basic questions about the forms 
and help you fill them out right the first time. The 
staff cannot tell you what words to use in your 
court papers, though. 

Step 3. File the forms with the court 
(give the forms to the court clerk) 

Take your forms to the Court Clerk’s Office. The 
Clerk will fill in the time and date for the hearing 
(your court date) and will sign the “order for notice 
and summons” on the Motion for Modification 
and return it to you. You will need a proper officer, 
for example a State Marshal, to serve (officially 
deliver) the court forms on the other party. Give 
the Clerk the completed Application for Waiver of 
Fees if you think that you cannot afford the State 
Marshal fees. 

the name or form number of the form you want 
into the search box. 

Step 4. Have the papers “served” 
(officially delivered) 

 

Steps 

Step 1. Gather the forms 

You need these forms for a modification (to 
change your order): 

q Motion for Modification (JD-FM-174) 

  
Used to ask the court to change your order. 

 

q Appearance form (JD-CL-12) 
 

  
Used to make sure you get notices from the 
court and to let the court know that you are 
representing yourself. 

q Application for Waiver of Fees (JD-FM-75) 

  
Used if your income is very low and you want 
to ask the court to allow you not to pay the 
 
fees and costs or to pay the fees and costs 
for you. 

 

q Financial Affidavit (JD-FM-6-SHORT or 
 

  
JD-FM-6-LONG) 
Used to show how much money you have 
coming in, and how you spend it. 

 

If your gross annual income is less than $75,000 
and your total net assets are less than $75,000, 
you must use the JD-FM-6-SHORT form. If your 
gross annual income is more than $75,000 or 
your total net assets are more than $75,000, or 
if both are more than $75,000, you must use the 
JD-FM-6-LONG form. 

q Affidavit Concerning Children (JD-FM-164) 
 
  
This form asks where your child has lived and 
if there are other court cases about your child. 

 
You can get the forms and pamphlets: 

 
• Online from the Judicial Branch Website. 
Forms can be found at www.jud.ct.gov/ 
webforms. On the forms page, click the link for 
“Family” to display all family forms, or enter
