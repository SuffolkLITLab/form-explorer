The successful . bidder must record the committee deed within 30 days of the closing. 21. The committee must file a return of sale within 14 days from the date of the closing. 22. The sale is subject to any and all liens choate and inchoate which are prior in right to the encumbrance being foreclosed. 23. A motion for supplemental judgment should be filed with the court as soon as possible after the committee conducts the closing. The motion for supplemental judgment must be filed even if the plaintiff is the successful bidder and no money will be paid into court. A copy of the original note should be submitted along with the motion. The motion should request . payment for all parties that may be eligible for payment upon disbursement of the proceeds of sale and include an affidavit . of debt for each eligible party. The plaintiff's affidavit of debt should include the annual and daily rate of interest, the . amount of the interest, the number of days and the dates used to calculate the interest period (date of entry of the . judgment of foreclosure by sale to the date of disbursement, which includes the 20 day appeal period) , principal amount . of the debt, date of the committee's conveyance, insurance premium amount, if any, and dates of coverage with . documentation, amount of any taxes paid and term covered with documentation, amounts claimed for property . preservation with documentation.
