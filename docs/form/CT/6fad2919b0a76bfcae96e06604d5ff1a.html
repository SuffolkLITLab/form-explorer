2021 Legislative Summary 

P.A. 21-2, AN ACT CREATING A RESPECTFUL AND OPEN WORLD FOR NATURAL HAIR 
Effective:  March 4, 2021 

SUMMARY 

This act, known as the CROWN Act, specifies that the term “race” includes ethnic traits historically 
associated with race, including hair texture and protective hairstyles.  “Protective hairstyles” include 
wigs, headwraps, and hairstyles such as individual braids, cornrows, locs, twists, Bantu knots, afros, and 
afro puffs.  The Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities has the authority to investigate 
complaints of discriminatory practices in employment, public accommodations, housing, credit 
practices, union membership, and state agency practices.  

P.A. 21-9, AN ACT CONCERNING TELEHEALTH 
Effective:  May 10, 2021 to June 30, 2023 

SUMMARY 

The act modifies requirements for the delivery of telehealth services and insurance coverage for 
telehealth services through June 30, 2023.  The telehealth service must conform to the standard of care 
expected for in-person care as appropriate to the patient’s age and presenting condition.  

In general, the act: 

allows certain telehealth providers to provide telehealth services using audio-only telephone;
allows certain telehealth providers to use additional information and communication
technologies in accordance with federal requirements (e.g., Apple FaceTime);
authorizes the Commissioner of Public Health to temporarily modify, waive, or suspend certain
regulatory requirements to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect the public health;
establishes the requirements for telehealth providers seeking payment from uninsured or
underinsured patients;
requires insurance coverage for telehealth providers seeking payment from uninsured or
underinsured patients;
requires insurance coverage for telehealth services and prohibits providers reimbursed for
services from seeking payment from an insured patient beyond cost sharing; and
prohibits (1) insurance policies from excluding coverage for a telehealth platform selected by an
in-network provider and (2) carriers from reducing reimbursement to a provider because
services are provided through telehealth instead of in-person.

P.A. 21-15, AN ACT CONCERNING ADOPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONNECTICUT 
PARENTAGE ACT  
Effective:  January 1, 2022, except as otherwise noted 

SUMMARY 

This act adopts the Uniform Parentage Act and generally:  

provides for equal treatment under the law for children born to same-sex couples by, among
other things, removing certain gender-specific references (e.g., changing “maternity” and
“paternity” to “parentage”);

expands recognition of non-biological parents by (1) making marital presumptions gender
neutral and (b) establishing de facto parentage (i.e. creates best interest of the child factors that
the court must consider);

provides guidance on adjudicating parentage and adjudicating competing claims of parentage
(e.g., creates best interest of the child factors that the court must consider);

provides the process for establishing acknowledged parentage through an acknowledgement
agreement;

provides for adjudicating genetic parentage and updates the rules governing parentage of
children born under a surrogacy agreement; and

establishes a procedure to enable children conceived through assisted reproduction to access
medical and identifying information about any gamete donors.

There are also conforming changes throughout the statutes addressing items such as (1) birth 
certificates; (2) human services, social services, and public health protocols and systems; (3) probate 
court matters; and (4) family relations matters.  

Key components of the act that directly impact the Probate Courts are: 

Redefinition of “parent,” “parentage” and “parent-child relationship,” which has implications for
notice in guardian of the person of a minor and termination of parental rights matters and for
notice and distributions in decedents’ estates matters;
Expansion of jurisdiction to include petitions for parentage orders in connection with non-
surrogacy assisted reproduction, gestational surrogacy agreements and gestational surrogacy
agreements validated by the Probate Court and petitions to validate a genetic surrogacy
agreement.

Section 1:  Sections 1 to 86, inclusive, are cited as the Connecticut Parentage Act. 

Section 2:  Defines “acknowledged parent,” “adjudicated parent,” “alleged genetic parent,” “assisted 
reproduction,” “child support agency,” “determination of parentage,” “donor,” “gamete,” “embryo,” 
“genetic testing,” “intended parent,” “person,” “presumed parent,” “record,” “sign,” “signatory,” 
“state,” “transfer,” and “witnessed.”  Of particular interest to the Probate Courts are the following 
definitions:

(6)

(14)

(15)

“Alleged genetic parent” means a person who is alleged to be, or alleges that the person is,
a genetic parent or possible genetic parent of a child whose parentage has not been
adjudicated.  “Alleged genetic parent” includes an alleged genetic father and alleged genetic
mother. It does not include a presumed parent, a parent whose parental rights have been
terminated or declared not to exist or a donor.

“Child” means a person of any age whose parentage may be determined under sections 1 to
86, inclusive, of the act.

“Parent” means a person who has established a parent-child relationship under section 19
of the act.

“Parentage” or “parent-child relationship” means the legal relationship between a child and
a parent of the child.

2021 Legislative Summary 

the person acknowledges parentage of the child under sections 24 to 35 of the act, unless
the acknowledgment is rescinded under section 30 of the act or successfully challenged
under section 31 of the act;

the person’s parentage is established under sections 51 to 59 of the act;

the person’s parentage is established under sections 60 to 77 of the act; or

the court is deemed to have made an adjudication of parentage pursuant to section 16(b) of
the act (proceedings for dissolution of marriage, annulment or legal separation).

Section 20:  A parent-child relationship extends equally to every child and parent, regardless of the 
marital status or gender of the parent or the circumstances of the birth of the child.  

Section 21:  Unless parental rights are terminated, a parent-child relationship established under sections 
1 to 86 of the act applies for all purposes.  

Section 22:  To the extent practicable, provisions applicable to father-child or mother-child relationship 
apply to any parent-child relationship regardless of the gender of the parent.  

Section 23:  Except as otherwise provided, in a proceeding to adjudicate competing claims of parentage 
of a child by two or more persons, the court shall adjudicate parentage in the best interest of the child, 
based on:  

the age of the child;

the length of time during which each person assumed the role of parent of the child;

the nature of the relationship between the child and each person;

the harm to the child if the relationship between the child and each person is not
recognized;

the basis for each person’s claim to parentage of the child;

other equitable factors arising from the disruption of the relationship between the child and
each person, or the likelihood of other harm to the child; and

(7)

any other factor the court deems relevant to the child’s best interests.

If parentage is challenged based on results of genetic testing, the court must also consider: 

the facts surrounding discovery that the person might not be a genetic parent of the child;
and

the length of time between the time that the person was placed on notice that the person
might not be a genetic parent and the commencement of the proceeding.

The court may adjudicate a child to have more than two parents under sections 1 to 86 of the act if the 
court finds that failure to recognize more than two parents would be detrimental to the child.  A finding 
of detriment to the child does not require a finding of unfitness of any parent or person seeking 
adjudication of parentage. The court must consider relevant factors including the harm if the child is 
removed from a stable placement with a person who has fulfilled the child’s physical needs and 
psychological needs for care and affection and has assumed the role for a substantial period.

2021 Legislative Summary 

If a court has adjudicated a child to have more than two parents, Connecticut law other than the 
Connecticut Parentage Act applies to determinations of legal and physical custody of, or visitation with, 
the child, and to obligations of support.  

Sections 24 to 35 relate to acknowledgments of parentage. In particular, Section 25 includes details to 
be set forth in the acknowledgment of parentage form created by the Department of Public Health.  

Section 36: A person is a presumed parent if:  

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

the person and the person who gave birth to the child are married to each other and the 
child is born during the marriage;  

the person and the person who gave birth to the child were married to each other and 
the child is born not later than 300 days after the date on which the marriage is 
terminated by death, dissolution or annulment, or after a decree of separation; or  

the person, jointly with another parent, resided in the same household with the child 
and openly held out the child as the person’s own child from the time the child was born 
or adopted and for a period of at least two years thereafter, including any period of 
temporary absence.  

In a Probate Court proceeding under C.G.S. §§ 45a-603 to 45a-622 or C.G.S. §§ 45a-715 to 45a-717, if 
notice is given to a presumed parent and the presumed parent’s parentage has not been established by 
a court adjudication or valid acknowledgement of parentage, the Probate Court has jurisdiction to 
determine the presumed parent’s parentage.  

Section 37:  A proceeding to determine whether a presumed parent is a parent may be commenced 
(1) before the child reaches 18; or (2) after the child reaches 18, but only if the child initiates the 
proceeding.  

Except as otherwise provided, a presumption of parentage cannot be overcome after the child turns two 
unless the court determines (1) the presumed parent is not a genetic parent, never resided with the 
child, and never held out the child as the presumed parent’s child; or (2) the child has more than one 
presumed parent; or (3) the alleged genetic parent did not know of the potential genetic parentage of 
the child and could not reasonably have known on account of material misrepresentation or 
concealment, and the alleged genetic parent commences a challenge to presumption of parentage 
under section 36 of the act not later than one year after the date of discovering the potential genetic 
parentage.  If the person is adjudicated to be the genetic parent, the court may not disestablish a 
presumed parent.  

The following rules apply in a proceeding to adjudicate a presumed parent’s parentage:  

(1) 

(2) 

If no party to the proceeding challenges the presumed parent’s parentage, the court shall 
adjudicate the presumed parent to be a parent.  

If the presumed parent is identified under section 45 of the act as a genetic parent and that 
identification is not successfully challenged, the court shall adjudicate the presumed parent 
to be a parent.  

 

 

PAGE 6 
 

2021 Legislative Summary 

(3) 

If the presumed parent is not identified under section 45 of the act as a genetic parent and 
the presumed parent or the person who gave birth to the child challenges the presumed 
parent’s parentage, the court shall adjudicate parentage in the best interest of the child 
based on the factors under sections 23(a) and (b) of the act.  

A presumption of parentage under section 36(a)(3) of the act can be challenged if the other parent 
openly held out the child as the presumed parent’s child due to duress, coercion or threat of harm.  

Sections 38 to 39 relate to adjudicating de facto parentage.  In general, a de facto parent is adjudicated 
by the Superior Court.  

Sections 40 to 50 relate to genetic testing of a person in a proceeding to adjudicate parentage, whether 
the person (1) voluntarily submits to testing; or (2) is tested under an order of the court or child support 
agency. Genetic testing may not be used to (1) challenge parentage of a person who is a parent under 
sections 51 to 77 of the act; or (2) establish parentage of a person who is a donor.  

Sections 51 to 59 relate to assisted reproduction.  

Section 59:  A party consenting to assisted reproduction, a person who is a parent pursuant to sections 
53 to 55 of the act, an intended parent or parents or the person giving birth may commence a 
proceeding in the Probate Court to obtain an order:  

(1) 

(2) 

declaring that the intended parent or parents are the parent or parents of the resulting child 
immediately upon the birth of the child and ordering that parental rights and responsibilities 
vest exclusively in the intended parent or parents immediately upon the birth of the child; 
and  

designating the contents of the birth certificate and directing the Department of Public 
Health to designate the intended parent or parents as the parent or parents of the resulting 
child.  

A proceeding may be commenced before or after the birth of the child; however, an order issued before 
the birth of the child does not take effect unless and until the child is born. This section does not limit 
the court’s authority to issue other orders under any other provision of the general statutes.  

Sections 60 to 77 relate to assisted reproduction under a surrogacy agreement.  

Section 70:  Allows a party to a gestational surrogacy agreement to initiate a proceeding to determine 
parentage of a child conceived pursuant to the agreement any time after the agreement has been 
executed by all parties.  

The petition for a judgment of parentage must include (1) certification from the attorney representing 
the intended parent or parents and the attorney representing the surrogate that the requirements of 
sections 61 to 63 of the act have been met; and (2) a statement from all parties that they entered into 
the surrogacy agreement knowingly and voluntarily. The certification and the statement must be signed 
under penalty of false statement.  

Service of process may be waived if each party consents to waiver of service of process.  

If the court finds that the parties have satisfied the certification and statement requirement, the court 
shall issue a judgment (1) declaring any intended parent of the child is a parent and ordering that 

PAGE 7 
 

2021 Legislative Summary 

parental rights, duties and custody vest immediately upon birth of the child; (2) declaring the person 
acting as the gestational surrogate (and the surrogate’s spouse or former spouse) is not a parent of the 
child; (3) declaring that the intended parent or parents have responsibility for the child immediately 
upon birth; (4) designating the contents of the birth certificate and directing the Department of Public 
Health to designate any intended parent as a parent of the child; and (5) if necessary, ordering that the 
child be surrendered to the intended parent or parents. The order may be issued before or after the 
birth of the child, but must be stayed if issued before birth.  

If the parties cannot make the certification or statement required because of a technical issue, then the 
court may enforce the agreement if the agreement is in substantial compliance.  

Section 72:  A proceeding to validate a genetic surrogacy agreement is filed in the Probate Court and 
must be filed before the assisted reproduction related to the surrogacy agreement occurs. Upon 
examination of the parties, the court may issue an order finding that the requirements of sections 61 to 
63 are satisfied and all parties entered the agreement voluntarily and understood the terms.  

A person who terminates a genetic surrogacy agreement under section 73 of the act must file notice of 
the termination with the court.  On receipt of the notice, the court vacates the order validating the 
agreement.   

Section 74:  Provides that upon the birth of a child conceived by assisted reproduction under a genetic 
surrogacy agreement validated by the Probate Court, each intended parent is a parent of the child by 
operation of law.  

Upon the birth of the child, the intended parent or parents must file a notice with the court that 
validated the surrogacy agreement.  The court must, immediately or as soon as practicable, issue an 
order without notice and hearing (ex parte) (1) declaring any intended parent of the child is a parent and 
ordering that parental rights, duties and custody vest immediately upon the birth of the child; (2) 
declaring the person acting as the gestational surrogate (and the surrogate’s spouse or former spouse) is 
not a parent of the child; (3) declaring that the intended parent or parents have responsibility for the 
child immediately upon birth; (4) designating the contents of the birth certificate and directing the 
Department of Public Health to designate any intended parent as a parent of the child; and (5) if 
necessary, ordering that the child be surrendered to the intended parent or parents.   

If it is alleged that the child was not conceived by assisted reproduction, the court may, upon sufficient 
findings, order genetic testing to determine the genetic parentage of the child and designate which 
party must pay for the testing.  If the child was not conceived by assisted reproduction, then parentage 
is determined under sections 1 to 50 of the act, and the surrogate is not entitled to nonexpense-related 
compensation paid for serving as surrogate unless the agreement provides otherwise.  

The surrogate may file a notice with the court, not later than 60 days after the date of birth of the child, 
that the child has been born to a surrogate if the intended parent or parents fail to do so. On proof of a 
court order under section 72 or 75 of the act, the court shall order that any intended parent is a parent 
of the child.  

Section 75:  Provides that a genetic surrogacy agreement that is not validated under section 72 of the 
act is enforceable only to the extent provided in sections 75 and 77 (breach of surrogacy agreement) of 
the act.   

PAGE 8 
 

2021 Legislative Summary 

If all parties agree, a court may validate a genetic surrogacy agreement after assisted reproduction has 
occurred but before the child is born if, upon examination of the parties, the court finds that the 
requirements of sections 61 to 63 are satisfied and all parties entered the agreement voluntarily and 
understand the terms. 

A person who terminates the agreement must file a notice of termination with the court; provided, 
however, that a gamete or embryo transfer has not resulted in a pregnancy.  Upon receipt of the notice, 
the court vacates the order validating the agreement.  

If a child conceived by assisted reproduction under a genetic surrogacy agreement that is not validated 
is born, the person acting as surrogate is not automatically a parent.  The court must adjudicate 
parentage based on the best interest of the child taking into account the factors listed in section 23(a) of 
the act and the intent of the parties at the time of execution of the agreement.  

Sections 78 to 83 relate to information collected by a gamete bank or fertility clinic regarding an 
anonymous donor of gametes.  These provisions apply to gametes collected on or after January 1, 2022.

must be given to the need to promote uniformity of the law among states that have enacted the 
uniform law.  

Section 85:  Provides that sections 1 to 86 of the act modify, limit or supersede the Electronic Signatures 
in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq., but not 15 U.S.C. 7001(c) nor do they 
authorize electronic delivery of any notices described in 15 U.S.C. 7003(b).  

Section 86:  Provides that sections 1 to 86 of the act apply to a proceeding in which no judgment has 
entered before January 1, 2022 with respect to a person’s parentage that has not already been 
adjudicated or determined by operation of law.  

Sections 87 to 98 make technical changes to statutes under Titles 7, 17a, 17b and 19a consistent with 
the Connecticut Parentage Act.  

Section 99:  Amends C.G.S. § 45a-106a to replace “paternity” with “parentage” and to include petitions 
to validate a genetic surrogacy agreement as petitions that require a $250 filing fee.

reproduction” as defined in section 2 of the Connecticut Parentage Act.

Section 102:  Amends C.G.S. § 45a-437 to remove references to “born out of wedlock” and replace

Section 103:  Amends C.G.S. § 45a-438 providing that a child and the child’s legal representatives qualify 
for inheritance from or through the parent if parentage is established in accordance with the provisions 
of the Connecticut Parentage Act or by adoption.  

Section 104:  Amends C.G.S. § 45a-438b providing that a parent and the parent’s kindred qualify for

Adjournment 

The notice and agenda must be posted not less than 24 hours prior to the meeting in accordance with 
C.G.S. § 1-225(d).  The notice and agenda must include instructions for the public to attend and provide

applicable or permitted by law.

The vote of any member participating by electronic equipment must be taken by roll call, unless the 
vote is unanimous.  Minutes must list members attending in person and members attending by means 
of electronic equipment.  

If a meeting conducted by electronic equipment is interrupted by the failure, disconnection or, in the 
chairperson’s determination, unacceptable degradation of the electronic means, or a member necessary 
to form a quorum loses the ability to participate, the agency may, not less than 30 minutes and not

other document the commissioner or designee deems necessary.  The commissioner or designee may 
require witnesses, production of documents and may issue subpoenas.  The commissioner must adopt 
regulations governing rules of procedure for disposition of appeals.  Any party aggrieved by the decision 
of the commissioner or designee may appeal the decision to the Hartford Superior Court or the Superior
