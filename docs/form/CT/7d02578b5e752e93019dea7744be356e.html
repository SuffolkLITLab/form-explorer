      <pre>A Guide to 
Understanding  
The Americans With 
Disabilities Act
Questions and Answers for 
Members of the Public

The Connecticut Judicial Branch is 
committed to carrying out the objectives 
of the Americans with Disabilities Act 
(ADA). Title II of the ADA requires 
public entities, such as the Connecticut 
Judicial Branch, to accommodate 
individuals with disabilities by providing 
equal access to their services, 
programs, and activities. This brochure 
is designed to assist members of the 
public with reliable, easy to find ADA 
information. Please note that words that 
are underlined are “hyperlinked” to  
online versions of forms and other 
available information.

Under the ADA, a disability is a physical or 
mental impairment that substantially limits a 
major life activity, if you have a history of such 
an impairment, or are perceived to have an 
impairment. Major life activities include, but 
are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing 
manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, 
walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, 
breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, 
thinking, communicating, and working.

In this brochure, you will find answers to common 
questions about the ADA and the courts. If you 
have other questions, you may speak to your local 
ADA contact person.

1: I will be visiting a Judicial Branch 
building. Will there be an accessible 
entrance?

A: Yes. Every Judicial Branch facility has 
an accessible entrance. Please visit the court 
Directions page on the Branch’s website,  
jud.ct.gov, to find out where it is located. If you 
don’t have Internet access, please contact the 
Clerk’s office.

2: May I request an accommodation 
before I come to court?

A: Yes. While a request for an accommodation 
can be made at any time, it is best to make the 
request as far in advance as one can. If possible, 
you should give a minimum of 10 days’ notice.

3: I will be visiting a courthouse, 
but I do not have a court case. 
Can I still make a request for an 
accommodation?

A: Yes. Anyone with a disability can make a 
request, whether that person is an attorney, a 
party to a case, a juror, or a member of the public 
who simply wants to observe court proceedings.

4: How do I make a request for 
accommodation?

A: A request can be made in many different 
ways. You can fill out the Request for 
Accommodation By Persons With Disabilities 
form that is on the Judicial Branch website, or 
you can call the court Clerk’s office or Court 
Service Center in the facility that you will be 
visiting. In addition, you may call or write a 
contact person at each facility who can assist 
you by answering specific questions about 
access to services and by processing requests for 
accommodations. The list of Contact people and 
their email addresses is on the Judicial Branch 
website.

5: Are ADA-related forms and 
information available in alternative 
formats?

A: Yes. The information can be made available  
in other formats such as Braille, large print,  
and audio. However, this is done by request  
only and may take some time. Ask your local 
Contact person.

6: Can I get help filling out the form?

A: Yes. Feel free to ask the local contact person 
or any other court personnel to help you fill out 
the form. However, they are unable to provide you 
 
with legal advice. 

7: What is the role of the ADA  
Contact person?

A: An ADA Contact Person is available at each 
Judicial Branch facility to ensure that members 
of the public have an individual at each location 
who can provide specific information about 
accommodations available at that location. The 
Contact person is not qualified, nor authorized, to 
act as an ADA attorney, expert, advocate, or ADA 
compliance officer.

8: What information should I include on 
my Request for Accommodation form?

A: The accommodation request must include the 
full name, address and contact information of the 
person making the request. If known, the request 
should state your court date, the docket number, 
and whether it is a civil or criminal matter.

9: Do I have to tell you the nature of my 
disability?

A: Yes, the request should state the nature of the 
disability that makes an accommodation necessary 
and include a suggestion as to what would be 
a reasonable accommodation for the disability. 
Providing this information will allow the person 
reviewing your request to better understand the 
limitation or limitations you are facing, and 
provide you the most appropriate reasonable 
accommodation.

10: Do I need to prove that I have  
a disability?

14: Can I request services or devices 
of a personal nature?

A: Most requests for an accommodation do not 
require proof. In some cases, however, it may be 
necessary to provide additional information or 
medical documentation from a qualified licensed 
professional for the Judicial Branch to determine 
whether you are a “qualified” person with a 
disability under the ADA and/or to help identify 
the most appropriate reasonable accommodation.

11: If I provide information about my 
disability, is it confidential?

A: Yes. The Judicial Branch is committed to 
preserving confidentiality. The information will 
only be used to determine if an accommodation 
is needed and identify the most appropriate 
reasonable accommodation.

12: Can I request specific equipment or 
services to assist me?

A: Yes. The Judicial Branch can make assistive 
listening devices, sign language interpreters, 
printed material in alternate formats, and real time 
transcription services available when appropriate. 
For a list of some available equipment and services, 
please visit the Judicial Branch’s website, or 
contact a person at the facility that you will  
be visiting.

13: Can I request that an attorney be 
provided for my court case?

A: No. The ADA does not require the Judicial 
Branch to provide a lawyer as an accommodation. 
However, we invite you to visit or call any of our 
Court Service Centers or a Public Information Desk 
for information on more resources. Additionally, 
you can find resources on the Judicial Branch Law 
Libraries website or on the Judicial Branch ADA 
Resource page.

A: No. The ADA does not require the Judicial 
Branch to provide services or devices of a 
personal nature, such as wheelchairs or other 
mobility devices, or legal representation, 
secretarial services, and transportation.

15: How long will it take for my 
request to be reviewed?

A: All requests are reviewed immediately. 
However, in some instances, a request will 
require further consideration. You will be notified 
of the decision as soon as possible.

16: Can my request be denied?

A: Yes. Although the Judicial Branch is 
committed to ensuring that persons with 
disabilities have equal access to the courts, some 
requests may  
be denied.

17: Why would my request be denied?

A: The ADA does not require that an 
accommodation be provided to someone who 
is not a “qualified” person with a disability. 
In addition, the ADA does not require actions 
that would cause a “fundamental alteration of a 
program or service” or would present an “undue 
financial or administrative burden.” Additionally, 
the individual’s physical or mental impairment  
that substantially limits a major life activity  
must be directly related to the accommodation 
being sought.

18: If my request is denied, can I 
appeal the denial?

A: Yes. If your request for an accommodation 
is denied, you will be given information on 
how to file a Grievance/Complaint, including 
information about how that process works. The 
grievance must be filed no later than 10 days 
after the denial has been made on your request. 

For additional information about the grievance 
process and to find the grievance/complaint 
form, please visit the Judicial Branch website or 
ask for assistance at the courthouse.

19: I don’t like the Judge’s ruling in 
my case. Can I file an ADA complaint? 

A: No. The ADA Complaint process is used only 
when a request for accommodation has been 
denied. It is not the correct way to challenge a 
Judge’s decision.

20: Is there a cost for any of  
these services?

A: No. It is the Judicial Branch’s responsibility 
to provide a reasonable accommodation at no 
cost to all qualified individuals.

21: If I receive Supplemental 
Security Income (SSI), does that 
guarantee that my request for an 
accommodation will be granted?

A: No. The definition of disability under the 
Social Security Administration is not the same 
as the definition of disability under the ADA. 
The Social Security Administration defines 
disability in terms of “inability to perform 
substantial gainful activity,” by which it means 
“work paying minimum wage or better.” The 
ADA defines it as having a record of or being 
perceived as having a “physical or mental 
impairment that substantially limits a major  
life activity.”

22: I have a disability and have 
been summoned for jury service. 
How do I make a request for an 
accommodation?

A: If you have been summoned for jury service 
and need a reasonable accommodation, you may 
call Jury Administration at 1-800-842-8175, or 
711 if you have a hearing or speech disability, 
or you may complete the Juror Accommodation 
Form, JD-JA-030.

23: What is the Judicial Branch  
doing to improve access for people 
with disabilities?

A: The Judicial Branch recognizes the 
importance access plays in our court system 
and the ADA initiative is always ongoing. 
An Advisory Board on the Americans with 
Disabilities Act was created in 2011 to 
oversee the ongoing implementation of the 
recommendations approved by the Office of 
the Chief Court Administrator and to offer new 
recommendations as appropriate.

24: Who do I contact if I have any 
suggestions for improvement?

A: You may call the Superior Court Operations 
Division Coordinator at 860-706-5310 or  
you may email your suggestions to  
ADA.Program@jud.ct.gov. Please limit 
suggestions to general observations about 
programs or processes. Suggestions relating  
to specific cases will not be considered.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
