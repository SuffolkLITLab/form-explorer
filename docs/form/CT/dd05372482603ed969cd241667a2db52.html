Introduction

The Conflict Resolution Conference 
(CRC) is a confidential service that 
helps parents solve parenting issues in a 
cooperative and positive manner. In this 
process the parents are able to keep their 
decision-making roles in solving family 
disputes with the assistance of a Family 
Relations Counselor (FRC). Attorneys of 
record may be included in the meetings 
and relevant information from community 
resources/agencies involved with the 
family will be made part of the process. 

It is important that parents work together 
to make joint decisions for their children’s 
care and development. The CRC supports 
this process by guiding and educating the 
parents. This usually results in a parenting 
plan that is successful and less stressful for 
all involved. 

The main issues dealt with in this 
process are child custody and/or access 
arrangements. However, if the parents and 
the attorneys agree, some financial and 
property issues may also be addressed.

What to Expect

To take part in the Conflict Resolution 
Conference, parents must be referred 
by the Family Court. At the start of the 

process the parents may be asked to sign 
Authorization for Release of Information 
forms. The FRC assigned to the case can then 
get information from professional sources, 
such as schools, therapists or doctors, which 
may help in resolving the issue. 

If the parents reach an agreement during 
the CRC, the terms of that agreement 
are reported to the Court, the parents, 
and attorneys of record. The agreement 
becomes legally binding upon order of  
the Court. 

The CRC is a confidential process. 
Exceptions to this will be discussed in the 
first session. There may be up to two, 3-hour 
sessions in all, and the attorneys of record 
may be brought into the process at any time. 

One role of the FRC is to provide a neutral, 
supportive, and structured place for 
discussions to occur. The counselor helps 
to keep the focus of the meetings on the 
best interests of the children while allowing 
the needs and desires of the parents to be 
considered. The FRC may also provide 
education about alternative parenting plans 
and how they are impacted by the stages of 
child development. It is also possible that 
the FRC will consider information received 
from other resources, in an attempt to help 
the parents resolve their differences. While 
the parents keep their roles as the decision-
makers in this process, the FRC may offer 
their verbal assessment of the situation 
and ultimately share recommendations 
they believe will resolve the issues. These 
assessments and recommendations are not 
reported to the Court. 

Even when an agreement is not reached 
during the sessions, the CRC process is 
still helpful. Parents often leave with a 
greater understanding of different parenting 
plans and how they might meet the needs 
of their children. 

Parenting plans may need to change 
several times over the years for a variety of 
reasons. If parents need help in resolving 
issues about their children after the CRC 
process is completed, they may contact the 
Court Support Services Division – Family 
Services for direction. 

Tips for Success

Your participation and cooperation 
throughout the CRC process is essential. 

We know that the process may be a 
stressful and emotional one. However, it 
is helpful to listen to what everyone has 
to say and to share your opinions and 
concerns in a way that shows respect for 
everyone in the process.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
