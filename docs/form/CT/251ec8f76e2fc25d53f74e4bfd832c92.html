Parental Kidnapping-2 

Introduction 

 
“The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction generally requires courts in the United States to order children 
returned to their countries of habitual residence, if the courts find that the 
children have been wrongfully removed to or retained in the United States.” 
Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, 168, 133 S. Ct. 1017, 1021, 185 L. Ed. 2d 1, 8 
(2013).  
 

•  International parental kidnapping (18 USC Part I – Crimes). “Whoever 

removes a child from the United States or attempts to do so, or retains a child 
(who has been in the United States) outside the United States with intent to 
obstruct the lawful exercise of parental rights shall be fined under this title or 
imprisoned not more than 3 years or both.” 18 U.S.C. § 1204(a). 

“Congress enacted the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA), 28 
U.S.C. § 1738A, to avoid jurisdictional competition and conflict in matters of child 
custody and visitation and to promote cooperation between state courts. See 
Pub. L. No. 96-611, 94 Stat. 3569, § 7 (c).” Scott v. Somers, 97 Conn. App. 46, 
47, 903 A.2d 663 (2006). 

“The purposes of the UCCJEA are to avoid jurisdictional competition and 
conflict with courts of other states in matters of child custody; promote 
cooperation with the courts of other states; discourage continuing controversies 
over child custody; deter abductions; avoid re-litigation of custody decisions; and 
to facilitate the enforcement of custody decrees of other states. . . . The UCCJEA 
addresses inter-jurisdictional issues related to child custody and visitation.”  
In re Iliana M., 134 Conn. App. 382, 390, 38 A.3d 130 (2012). 

 

 

•  Custodial interference in the second degree: Class A misdemeanor. “(a) A 
person is guilty of custodial interference in the second degree when: (1) Being a 
relative of a child who is less than sixteen years old and intending to hold such 
child permanently or for a protracted period and knowing that he has no legal 
right to do so, he takes or entices such child from his lawful custodian; (2) 
knowing that he has no legal right to do so, he takes or entices from lawful 
custody any incompetent person or any person entrusted by authority of law to 
the custody of another person or institution; or (3) knowing that he has no legal 
right to do so, he holds, keeps or otherwise refuses to return a child who is less 
than sixteen years old to such child's lawful custodian after a request by such 
custodian for the return of such child. (b) Custodial interference in the second 
degree is a class A misdemeanor.” Conn. Gen. Stat. § 53a-98 (2023).  

  Custodial interference in the first degree: Class D felony. “(a) A person is 
guilty of custodial interference in the first degree when he commits custodial 
interference in the second degree as provided in section 53a-98: (1) Under 
circumstances which expose the child or person taken or enticed from lawful 
custody or the child held after a request by the lawful custodian for his return to 
a risk that his safety will be endangered or his health materially impaired; or (2) 
by taking, enticing or detaining the child or person out of this state.” Conn. Gen. 
Stat. § 53a-97 (2023).

and from the United States, with specific emphasis on 
Connecticut courts.  
 
•  Section 4: Family Violence and Parental Kidnapping 

•  Avendano v. Smith, 806 F. Supp. 2d 1149, 1163-1164 
(D.N.M. 2011). “The Hague Convention ‘seeks to deter 
parents who are dissatisfied with current custodial 
arrangements from abducting their children and seeking a 
more favorable custodial ruling in another country.’ Navani 
v. Shahani, 496 F.3d 1121, 1124 (10th Cir. 2007) (citing 
Shealy v. Shealy, 295 F.3d 1117, 1121 (10th Cir. 2002)). 
The Hague Convention ‘creates an international legal 
mechanism requiring contracting states to promptly return 
children who have been wrongfully removed to, or 
wrongfully retained in, their jurisdiction, without deciding 
anew the issue of custody.’ Navani v. Shahani, 496 F.3d at 
1124 (citing de Silva v. Pitts, 481 F.3d 1279, 1282 (10th Cir. 
2007)). The International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 42 
U.S.C. §§ 11601 through 11610 (“ICARA”), implements the 
Hague Convention, and grants federal and state courts 
‘concurrent original jurisdiction of actions arising under the 
Convention.’ 42 U.S.C. § 11603(a).” 
 

•  Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 

Abduction 

Article 13: “Notwithstanding the provisions of the 

preceding Article, the judicial or administrative authority of 
the requested State is not bound to order the return of the 
child if the person, institution or other body which opposes 
its return establishes that — 

a)  the person, institution or other body having the care of 

the person of the child was not actually exercising the 
custody rights at the time of removal or retention, or had 
consented to or subsequently acquiesced in the removal or 
retention; or 

b)  there is a grave risk that his or her return would 

expose the child to physical or psychological harm or 
otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation. 

 The judicial or administrative authority may also refuse to 

order the return of the child if it finds that the child objects 
to being returned and has attained an age and degree of 
maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its 
views. 

In considering the circumstances referred to in this Article, 

the judicial and administrative authorities shall take into 

Parental Kidnapping-4 

account the information relating to the social background of 
the child provided by the Central Authority or other 
competent authority of the child's habitual residence.”  
 

•  Habitual residence: “To determine the habitual residence, 
the court must focus on the child, not the parents, and 
examine past experience, not future intentions.” Friedrich  v.  
Friedrich, 983 F.2d 1396, 1401 (6th Cir. 1993). 
 

•  Comity: “…judgments of courts of foreign countries are 

recognized in the United States because of comity due to the 
courts and judgments of one nation to another. Such 
recognition is granted to foreign judgments with due regard 
to international duty and convenience, on the one hand, and 
to rights of citizens of the United States and others under 
the protection of its laws, on the other hand.” Litvaitis v. 
Litvaitis, 162 Conn. 540, 544, 295 A.2d 519 (1972).  
 

•  Full Faith and Credit: “Full faith and credit shall be 

accorded by the courts of the States and the courts of the 
United States to the judgment of any other such court 
ordering or denying the return of a child, pursuant to the 
Convention, in an action brought under this chapter.”  
22 U.S.C. § 9003(g).

under The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of 
International Child Abduction made under factual 
circumstances in substantial conformity with the

notice and opportunity to be heard to all affected persons, as 
a child custody determination of another state under

LEGISLATIVE: 

n exercising this discretion, courts often consider whether 
any ‘ameliorative measures,’ undertaken either ‘by the 
parents’ or ‘by the authorities of the state having jurisdiction 
over the question of custody,’ could ‘reduce whatever risk 
might otherwise be associated with a child's repatriation.’ 
Blondin v. Dubois, 189 F.3d 240, 248 (C.A.2 1999) (Blondin 
I). The Second Circuit has made such consideration a 
requirement, mandating that district courts independently 
‘examine the full range of options that might make possible 
the safe return of a child’ before denying return due to grave 
risk, even if the party petitioning for the child's return has 
not identified or argued for imposition of ameliorative 
measures. Blondin v. Dubois, 238 F.3d 153, 163, n. 11 
(C.A.2 2001) (Blondin II). 

he Second Circuit's categorical requirement to consider all 
ameliorative measures is inconsistent with the text and other 
express requirements of the Hague Convention.”

Ed. 2d 203 (2022).  “Under the Hague Convention on the 
Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, Mar. 26, 1986, 
T. I. A. S. No. 11670, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99–11 (Treaty 
Doc.), if a court finds that a child was wrongfully removed 
from the child's country of habitual residence, the court 
ordinarily must order the child's return. There are, however, 
exceptions to that rule. As relevant here, a court is not 
bound to order a child's return if it finds that return would 
put the child at a grave risk of physical or psychological 
harm. In such a circumstance, a court has discretion to 
determine whether to deny return.

Convention, we hold that a child's habitual residence 
depends on the totality of the circumstances specific to the 
case. An actual agreement between the parents is not 
necessary to establish an infant's habitual residence. We 
further hold that a first-instance habitual-residence 
determination is subject to deferential appellate review for 
clear error.” (p. 723) 

The Convention's return requirement is a ‘provisional’ 
remedy that fixes the forum for custody proceedings. 
Silberman, Interpreting the Hague Abduction Convention: In 
Search of a Global Jurisprudence, 38 U. C. D. L. Rev. 1049, 
1054 (2005). Upon the child's return, the custody 
adjudication will proceed in that forum. . . To avoid delaying 
the custody proceeding, the Convention instructs contracting 
states to ‘use the most expeditious procedures available’ to 
return the child to her habitual residence. Art. 2, Treaty 
Doc., at 7. See also Art. 11, id., at 9 (prescribing six weeks 
as normal time for return-order decisions).” (pp. 723-724) 

The habitual-residence determination thus presents a 
task for factfinding courts, not appellate courts, and should 
be judged on appeal by a clear-error review standard 
deferential to the factfinding court. . . . Clear-error review 
has a particular virtue in Hague Convention cases. As a 
deferential standard of review, clear-error review speeds up 
appeals and thus serves the Convention's premium on 
expedition. See Arts. 2, 11, Treaty Doc., at 7, 9. Notably, 
courts of our treaty partners review first-instance habitual-
residence determinations deferentially.” (p. 730) 

Although agreeing with the manner in which the Court has 
resolved the two questions presented, the United States, as 
an amicus curiae supporting neither party, suggests 
remanding to the Court of Appeals rather than affirming that 
court's judgment. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 
28. Ordinarily, we might take that course, giving the lower 
courts an opportunity to apply the governing totality-of-the 
circumstances standard in the first instance.  

nder the circumstances of this case, however, we decline to 

disturb the judgment below. . . . Nothing in the record 
suggests that the District Court would appraise the facts 
differently on remand. 

 remand would consume time when swift resolution is the 

Convention's objective. . .  Given the exhaustive record 
before the District Court, the absence of any reason to 
anticipate that the District Court's judgment would change 
on a remand that neither party seeks, and the protraction of 
proceedings thus far, final judgment on A.M.T.'s return is in 
order.” (p. 731)

Thus, because the Convention did not enter into force 
between the United States and Thailand until April 1, 2016, 
after the allegedly wrongful retention of the Children in New 
York on October 7, 2015, the Convention does not apply to 
Marks's claim and the district court did not err in dismissing 
his petition.” (p. 424) 

  Tann v. Bennett, 807 F.3d 51, 52-53 (2nd Cir. 2015). 
“Indeed, one of the primary purposes of the Hague 
Convention was to prevent situations where ‘a family 
member would remove a child to jurisdictions more 
favorable to [his or her] custody claims in order to obtain a 
right of custody from the authorities of the country to which 
the child ha[d] been taken.’” Mota v. Castillo, 692 F.3d 108, 
112 (2d Cir.2012) (quoting Gitter, 396 F.3d at 129).” 
 

•  Lozano v. Montoya Alvarez, 572 U.S. 1, 5, 134 S. Ct. 1224, 
1229, 188 L. Ed. 2d 200 (2014). “The return remedy is not 
absolute. Article 13 excuses return where, for example, the 
left-behind parent was not ‘actually exercising’ custody 
rights when the abducting parent removed the child, or 
where there is a ‘grave risk’ that return would ‘place the 
child in an intolerable situation.’ Hague Convention, Arts. 
13(a)–(b), Treaty Doc., at 10. A state may also refuse to 
return the child if doing so would contravene ‘fundamental 
principles ... relating to the protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms.’ Art. 20, id., at 11. 

his case concerns another exception to the return remedy. 

Article 12 of the Convention states the general rule that 
when a court receives a petition for return within one year 
after the child's wrongful removal, the court ‘shall order the 
return of the child forthwith.’ Id., at 9. Article 12 further 
provides that the court, 

where the proceedings have been commenced after the 
expiration of the period of one year [from the date of the 
wrongful removal], shall also order the return of the 
child, unless it is demonstrated that the child is now 
settled in its new environment.’ Ibid.

•  Marks v. Hochhauser, 876 F.3d 416 (2nd Cir. 2017). 

“Accordingly, we conclude that the Convention contemplates 
that ‘retention’ occurs on a fixed date. Here, that date was 
October 7, 2015, when Hochhauser advised Marks that she 
would not be returning with the Children to Thailand. We 
therefore agree with the district court's conclusion that any 
wrongful retention occurred on October 7, 2015. We now 
turn to the question of when the Convention became binding 
between the United States and Thailand, as the Convention 
applies only to wrongful retentions occurring after the 
Convention's ‘entry into force in those States.’ Convention, 
art. 35.” (p. 422)

Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction generally 
requires courts in the United States to order children 
returned to their countries of habitual residence, if the courts 
find that the children have been wrongfully removed to or 
retained in the United States. The question is whether, after 
a child is returned pursuant to such an order, any appeal of 
the order is moot.” 
 

•  Souratgar v. Lee, 720 F.3d 96, 102 (2nd Cir. 2013). “The 

removal of a child under the Convention is deemed 
‘wrongful’ when ‘it is in breach of rights of custody attributed 
to a person . . . under the law of the State in which the child 
was habitually resident immediately before the removal.’ 
Abbott, 130 S.Ct. at 1989 (quotation marks omitted). Under 
the Convention, when a parent wrongfully removes a child 
from one contracting state which is the child's country of 
habitual residence to another contracting state, the other 
parent may initiate a proceeding to repatriate the child to 
the first state. In the United States, the petitioning party 
bears the burden of proving that the child was wrongfully 
removed. 42 U.S.C. § 11603(e)(1)(A).” 
 

•  Abbott v. Abbott, 560 U.S. 1, 22, 130 S. Ct. 1983, 176 L. 
Ed. 2d 789 (2010). “While a parent possessing a ne exeat 
right has a right of custody and may seek a return remedy, a 
return order is not automatic. Return is not required if the 
abducting parent can establish that a Convention exception 
applies. One exception states return of the child is not 
required when ‘there is a grave risk that his or her return 
would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or 
otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.’ Art. 
13(b), Treaty Doc., at 10. If, for example, Ms. Abbott could 
demonstrate that returning to Chile would put her own 
safety at grave risk, the court could consider whether this is 
sufficient to show that the child too would suffer 
‘psychological harm’ or be placed ‘in an intolerable situation.’ 
See, e.g., Baran v. Beaty, 526 F.3d 1340, 1352–1353 
(C.A.11 2008); Walsh v. Walsh, 221 F.3d 204, 220–221 
(C.A.1 2000). The Convention also allows courts to decline to 
order removal if the child objects, if the child has reached a 
sufficient ‘age and degree of maturity at which it is 
appropriate to take account of its views.’ Art. 13(b), Treaty 
Doc., at 10. ” 
 

 

 

Parental Kidnapping-9 

Connecticut Supreme and Appellate Court Decisions 

  Nietupski v. Del Castillo, 196 Conn. App. 31, 42-43, 228 A.3d 
1053 (2020). “The plaintiff also challenges the propriety of 
the court's order permitting international travel. At trial, the 
plaintiff claimed that travel to Peru is unsafe and that, if 
Matthew visited that South American country with the 
defendant, there was a risk they would not return to the 
United States. He renews those claims on appeal. . .  
. . . The plaintiff presented no evidence at trial indicating that 
the defendant harbored any intent to remain in Peru with 
Matthew. 
 

In her testimony, the guardian ad litem stated that she was 
‘in support of Matthew being able to travel internationally.’ 
She also testified that there currently were ‘no travel 
advisories’ for Peru and emphasized that Peru, like the 
United States, is a signatory to the Hague Convention, which 
she considered ‘a protection against [the defendant] just 
moving to Peru and staying there.’ 

hat evidence supports the court's findings that the 

defendant wanted to take Matthew to Peru ‘to meet her 
extended family and to allow him to immerse himself in her 
culture.’ The court credited the recommendation of the 
guardian ad litem, who was in favor of permitting Matthew to 
travel internationally with his parents. The court further 
found that Peru's status as a signatory to the Hague 
Convention provided the plaintiff with an avenue of redress 
in the event that the defendant refused to return to the 
United States. 

ravel orders involving minor children rest in the sound 

discretion of the trial court. See Stancuna v. Stancuna, 135 
Conn. App. 349, 354-57, 41 A.3d 1156 (2012).” 

•  Turner v. Frowein, 253 Conn. 312, 337, 752 A.2d 955 

 

(2000). “As stated previously, a trial court is authorized 
under article 13b to deny a petition for the child's return 
upon a showing, by clear and convincing evidence, that 
‘there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the 
child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the 
child in an intolerable situation.’ Our task, therefore, is to 
determine whether a finding that the child would be subject 
to a grave risk of harm if returned to the petitioning parent 
is, without more, sufficient to justify a trial court's decision to 
decline to order the child's return to his or her country of 
habitual residence. In doing so, we are mindful of the 
overarching conviction that inheres in the Hague Convention 
itself, that is, in adjudicating matters under the Hague 
Convention, ‘the interests of the child are stated to be the 
guiding criterion....’ E. Perez-Vera, Explanatory Report:

Connecticut Trial Court Decisions 

  Reynolds v. Reynolds, Superior Court, Judicial District of 

Middlesex at Middletown, No. FA 15-5011170-S (Dec. 12, 
2018) (2018 Conn. Super. LEXIS 5906). “’The Hague 
Convention [on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction, hereinafter the Hague Convention] targets 
international child abduction; it is not a jurisdictional-
allocation or full faith and credit treaty. It does not provide a 
remedy for the recognition and enforcement of foreign 
custody orders or procedures for vindicating a wronged 
parent's custody rights more generally. Those rules are 
provided in the Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and 
Enforcement Act.’ Redmond v. Redmond, 724 F.3d 729, 741 
(7th Cir. 2013). In other words, the Convention does not 
supersede local law as to jurisdiction. Pursuant to Article 16 
of the Convention, once raised, application of the Convention 
must be resolved first; other proceedings must be stayed. 22 
U.S.C. §9001, (1988) and Convention, Article 16. The Hague 
Convention, implemented legislation known as the 
International Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), which 
is set forth in 22 U.S.C. §§9001 through 9011, (1988). The 
court, therefore disagrees with the parties' position that the 
Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act 
(UCCJEA) is inapplicable to this case and will discuss both 
the applicable UCCJEA statute on forum non conveniens, as 
well as the common-law doctrine.” 
 

Tolland at Rockville, No. FA 07-4006469 S (Feb. 21, 2007) 
(42 Conn. L. Rptr. 814) (2007 Conn. Super. LEXIS 595) 
(2007 WL 826536). “The applicant, Josef R. Wittmann 
initiated this action pursuant to the International Child 
Abduction Remedies Act, 42 U.S.C. 11601, commonly known 
as the Hague Convention (hereinafter ICARA)….The 
petitioner husband has alleged that the respondent wife 
wrongfully removed and retained the children in the United 
States and that he has formally requested their return to 
Germany. He alleges that he has custody rights under 
German law. . . . The question presented is whether the 
court should appoint an attorney or Guardian ad litem for the 
minor children . . .  . For the foregoing reasons, attorney 
Matthew Potter is appointed as guardian ad litem for the 
minor children.”  

  Cruz v. Cruz, Superior Court, Judicial District of Danbury, 
No. CV 00-0341008-S (Dec. 27, 2002) (33 Conn. L Rptr. 
594) (2002 Conn. Super. Lexis 4195) (2002 WL 31955020).

  1. Has there been a wrongful removal or retention? 
  2. Is the child under the age of 18 years? 
  3. Has the child been removed or retained from his or 

her habitual residence? 

  4. Was the removal or wrongful retention of the child 

committed in violation of the ‘custody rights’ of the ‘left 
behind’ parent? 

 

The Court's analysis of this case has been limited to 
determining whether the minor child has been removed or 
retained from his ‘habitual residence’ in violation of the 
custody rights of the ‘left behind’ parent.” 

 

 

Cases from Other Jurisdictions 

  Mendez v. May, 778 F.3d 337, 344 (1st Cir. 2015). “We 
begin and end with the question of C.F.F.M.'s habitual 
residence at the time of removal. See Redmond v. Redmond, 
724 F .3d 729, 742 (7th Cir.2013) (‘[E]very Hague 
Convention petition turns on the threshold determination of 
the child's habitual residence; all other Hague determinations 
flow from that decision.’); Tsai–Yi Yang v. Fu–Chiang Tsui, 
499 F.3d 259, 271 (3d Cir.2007) (same).” 

  Ohlander v. Larson, 114 F.3d 1531, 1534 (10th Cir. 1997). 
“The Convention is meant to provide for a child’s prompt 
return once it has been established the child has been 
‘wrongfully removed’ to or retained in any affiliated state.” 

•  Mohsen v. Mohsen, 715 F. Supp. 1063, 1065 (D. Wyo. 

1989). “In light of the fact the petitioner’s daughter was last 
habitually resident in Bahrain, a noncontracting state, the 
court concludes that the petitioner has no rights under the 
Convention and is therefore not entitled to seek redress 
under its remedial provisions.”

.   The children must be “habitual resident(s) in a Contracting State immediately 

before any breach of custody or access right.” (The Convention, art. 4); 
 

.   The children must be under the age of sixteen. (The Convention, art. 4); and 

.   The children’s removal or retention in a country other than their place of 

habitual residence must have been wrongful, e.g. “it is in breach of rights of 
custody attributed to a person . . . . , either jointly or alone, under the law of 
the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the 
removal or retention.” (The Convention, art. 3(a)).

1) The defendant acted within the provisions of a valid court order granting 
the defendant legal custody or visitation rights and that order was obtained 
pursuant to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act or the Uniform Child 
Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act and was in effect at the time of the 
offense; 

  (

c) It shall be an affirmative defense under this section that -  

(2) the defendant was fleeing an incidence or pattern of domestic violence; or 

(3) the defendant had physical custody of the child pursuant to a court order 
granting legal custody or visitation rights and failed to return the child as a 
result of circumstances beyond the defendant’s control, and the defendant 
notified or made reasonable attempts to notify the other parent or lawful 
custodian of the child of such circumstances within 24 hours after the 
visitation period had expired and returned the child as soon as possible.

•   Scott v. Somers, 97 Conn. App. 46, 55, 903 A.2d 663 

(2006). “Because Somers continues to reside in Florida, the 
Florida court has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction over its 
custody determination, under Florida law, until a Florida 
court determines that significant connections do not exist in 
Florida. Thus, a party seeking to modify Florida's custody 
determination must obtain an order from Florida stating 
that it no longer has jurisdiction. This was not done in the 
present case and, therefore, Connecticut did not have 
jurisdiction to modify Florida's order.”

onnecticut Trial Court Decisions 

  Perez v. Negron, Superior Court, Judicial District of Hartford 
at Hartford, No. HHD FA14-4072256-S (Oct. 22, 2014) (59 
Conn. L. Rptr. 170) (2014 WL 6476926) (2014 Conn. Super. 
LEXIS 2572). “Jurisdiction in this case therefore comes down 
to the question of whether a court in Puerto Rico or a court 
in Connecticut, each having the authority to do so, first 
made a custody determination entitled to the other's full 
faith and credit. The following section of the PKPA is critical 
to resolving that question:  

     (e) Before a child custody or visitation determination is          
      made, reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard   
      shall be given to the contestants, any parent whose  
      parental rights have not been previously terminated and  
      any person who has physical custody of a child. 

8 U.S.C. §1738A(e). In this case, both courts have entered 

child custody orders. Under the PKPA, the order entitled to 
full faith and credit is not simply the first one entered, but 
the first one entered with the benefit of the due process 
protections stated in 28 U.S.C. §1738A(e).” 
 

•  Lebejko v. Lebejko, Superior Court, Judicial District of 

Windham at Putnam, No. FA06-4004870-S (Feb. 8, 2007) 
(42 Conn. L. Rptr. 760) (2007 WL 824452) (2007 Conn. 
Super. LEXIS 602). “The purpose behind the PKPA was to 
eliminate the four ‘bases’ or ‘factors’ in the original UCCJA 
which had resulted in all of the conflicts and resulting 
inconsistencies which had created an unworkable and non-
uniform interstate act. Instead, enforceability under the 
PKPA was to be based on the priority of home state 
jurisdiction. That provision of the uniform act was adopted in 
Connecticut as Conn. Gen. Stat. § 46b-115k.” 
 

•   Venditti v. Plonski, Superior Court, Judicial District of 

Ansonia-Milford at Milford, No. FA01-0076354-S (Feb. 5, 
2002) (2002 WL 241376) (2002 Conn. Super. LEXIS 339).

•   Brown v. Brown, 195 Conn. 98, 119-120, 486 A.2d 1116 
(1985). “The PKPA provides that the courts of every state 
enforce a child custody determination of another state if 
made ‘consistently’ with the PKPA provisions. 28 U.S.C. § 
1738A (c). Geared as the PKPA is toward establishing 
national jurisdictional standards that endeavor to reduce 
interstate child abductions, the application of the PKPA to 
this case initially turns on the definition of a ‘custody 
determination.’ We believe that the orders of the Florida 
court which, in effect, generated this Connecticut action, fall 
squarely within the PKPA definition of a ‘custody 
determination.’ 28 U.S.C. § 1738A (b) (3).” 

“Even though the facts may be unclear as to the defendant's 
permanent intentions, this court does not need-to find that 
Arizona is in fact the home state of the minor child. Using 
the significant connections test, it is clear that the child has 
more ties to Arizona and that jurisdiction should reside in 
that state. The plaintiff will have full opportunity to contest 
custody and to present all evidence necessary for a 
thoughtful custody and visitation determination in that state. 
Therefore, the motion to dismiss is granted.” 
 

•   Rowland v. Rowland, Superior Court, Judicial District of 

Ansonia-Milford at Milford, No. FA97-0057152-S (Aug. 19, 
1999) (1999 WL 669794) (1999 Conn. Super. LEXIS 2282). 
“The language of the federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention 
Act of 1980 (PKPA), 28 U.S.C. § 1738A must now be 
examined. That act requires the states to give full faith and 
credit to the custody decisions of other states that are 
consistent with federal law. The requirement, of course, is 
mandatory because of the Supremacy Clause of the federal 
constitution.” 

ther States 

•   Wilson v. Gouse, 263 Ga. 887, 889, 441 S.E.2d 57, 59 (Ga. 
1994). “As a preliminary matter, we find the PKPA applies in 
all interstate child custody disputes.”  
 

•   Murphy v. Woerner, 748 P.2d 749, 750 (Alaska 1988). “To 
the extent that the PKPA and the UCCJA conflict, the PKPA 
preempts state law.”

•   Devone v. Finley, 148 Conn. App. 647, 653-54, 87 A.3d 

1120 (2014). “The Georgia Superior Court, in accordance 
with the law prescribed by its state, issued a temporary 
custody order giving the defendant immediate custody of 
the minor child. That court found that the plaintiff failed to 
legitimize the child and thus concluded that the defendant is 
the only party entitled to custody of the child. The full faith 
and credit clause requires our courts to recognize and 
enforce the judgment of the Georgia Superior Court. In so 
doing, the trial court held that the plaintiff, who has no 
recognized custody rights over the minor child, lacked 
standing to bring a custody application in this state.” 

 

•   In re Iliana M., 134 Conn. App. 382, 390, 38 A.3d 130 

(2012). “At the outset, we note our agreement with the 
decisions of the Superior Court that have set forth the goals 
of the UCCJEA. ‘The purposes of the UCCJEA are to avoid 
jurisdictional competition and conflict with courts of other 
states in matters of child custody; promote cooperation 
with the courts of other states; discourage continuing 
controversies over child custody; deter abductions; avoid 
re-litigation of custody decisions; and to facilitate the 
enforcement of custody decrees of other states. . . . The 
UCCJEA addresses inter-jurisdictional issues related to child 
custody and visitation.’” 
 

•   In re Deleon J., 290 Conn. 371, 377-378, 963 A.2d 53 

(2009). “In addressing the issue of jurisdiction, the court 
noted that it had made an initial child custody 
determination, pursuant to General Statutes § 46b-115k, 
when it ordered protective supervision of the child on 
September 21, 2000, and that it subsequently had modified 
that disposition on April 22, 2002, when it ordered 
guardianship of the child to be transferred to the 
grandmother. The court further determined that the 
respondent and the grandmother both reside in 
Connecticut. The court concluded, therefore, that its 
exclusive, continuing jurisdiction had not expired pursuant 
to § 46b-115l(a)(1).”

•   Temlock v. Temlock, 95 Conn. App. 505, 520-521, 898 A.2d 
209 (2006). “Even when a Connecticut trial court does not 
have exclusive jurisdiction over a child custody matter, it 
still may maintain concurrent jurisdiction under the UCCJEA 
pursuant to General Statutes § 46b-115l (b), but only ‘if it 
has jurisdiction to make an initial determination under 
section 46b-115k.’ General Statutes § 46b-115l(b).”

•   Carrubba v. Carrubba, Superior Court, Judicial District of 

Hartford at Hartford, No. FA17-4084958-S (Sep. 12, 2017) 
(2017 Conn. Super. LEXIS 4477) (2017 WL 5015142). “In 
addition to arguing the court's exercise of temporary 
emergency jurisdiction should be vacated, the petitioner 
argues the court has no jurisdiction to entertain the motion 
to return the minor child or for contempt. The plaintiff's 
claim that the court no longer has jurisdiction over Laina is 
correct. The court exercised temporary emergency 
jurisdiction for a finite period, which has since passed. The 
petitioner's claim that the court does not have jurisdiction 
over him is misplaced. The petitioner submitted himself to 
the jurisdiction of this court when he filed an appearance 
and a motion to enforce the New York custody judgment. 
Thus, the court had in personum jurisdiction.”

Connecticut court must treat a foreign custody

the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act

custody order of a foreign country shall be treated in the

decree or other order of a court or tribunal of competent 
jurisdiction of a foreign state providing for legal custody, 
physical custody or visitation with respect to a child.’ 
Section 46b-115ii provides that ‘[a] court of this state shall

as a child custody determination of another state under 
sections 46b-115 to 46b-115t, inclusive, unless such

•   Perez v. Negron, Superior Court, Judicial District of Hartford 
at Hartford, No. HHD FA 14-4072256 (Oct. 22, 2014) (59 
Conn. L. Rptr. 170, 173-174) (2014 Conn. Super. LEXIS 
2572). “The father argues that, as an emergency 
determination, the order of the Puerto Rico court is only 
temporary and must give way now to the jurisdiction of 
Connecticut, which can claim home state status. That might 
have been the case if Puerto Rico had adopted Connecticut's 
version of the UCCJEA, which provides for emergency orders 
to remain in effect only until orders are issued in a state 
having jurisdiction under another basis (such as being the 
child's home state). Section 46b-115n of the Connecticut 
General Statutes. But the present jurisdictional assessment 
must be made on the basis of the law of Puerto Rico, which 
has not adopted the UCCJEA and its limitations on 
emergency jurisdiction. Scott v. Somers, 97 Conn.App. 46, 
52 (2006). And nothing in the PKPA itself imposes a 
temporal limit on the jurisdiction that a state acquires in an 
emergency situation described in 28 U.S.C. 
§1738A(c)(2)(C). The order entered in Puerto Rico on May 
21, 2014, while designated as temporary, is stated by its 
terms to be in effect for one year. Connecticut must give the 
order full faith and credit, and PKPA does not permit this 
state to shorten the duration of Puerto Rico's order by 
applying Connecticut law.” 

  Desjardins v. Charity, Superior Court, Judicial District of New 

London, No. FA 11-4115761 (Apr. 19, 2011) (2011 WL 
1886492) (2011 Conn. Super. LEXIS 1057). “It is this court's 
obligation to determine under the Uniform Child Custody and 
Jurisdiction Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) that it has jurisdiction 
to make an initial determination as to the children's custody. 
Scott v. Somers, 97 Conn. App. 46 (2006). This duty 
implicates the subject matter jurisdiction of the court and 
hence must be raised and determined by the court on its 
own motion if not formally raised by the parties. Absent a 
statutory basis for such exercise of jurisdiction, the parties 
cannot by agreement confer jurisdiction upon the court.

competition and conflict with courts of other states in 
matters of child custody; promote cooperation with the 
courts of other states; discourage continuing controversies 
over child custody; deter abductions; avoid re-litigation of 
custody decisions; and to facilitate the enforcement of 
custody decrees of other states . . . The UCCJEA addresses 
inter-jurisdictional issues related to child custody and 
visitation. The UCCJEA allows a Connecticut court to maintain 
exclusive, continuing jurisdiction over child custody 
determinations until one of the enumerated events under § 
46b-115l occurs . . . In subsection (a) of § 46b-115l, the 
decree-granting state retains exclusive continuing jurisdiction 
until: (1) A court of this state or a court of another state 
determines that the child, the child's parents and any person 
acting as a parent do not presently reside in this state; or (2) 
a court of this state determines that (A) this state is not the 
home state of the child, (B) a parent or a person acting as a 
parent continues to reside in this state but the child no 
longer has a significant relationship with such parent or 
person, and (c) substantial evidence is no longer available in 
this state concerning the child's care, protection, training and 
personal relationships. Subsection (b) provides: A court of 
this state which has made a child custody determination but 
does not have exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under this 
section may modify that determination only if it has 
jurisdiction to make an initial determination under section 
46b-115k." (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks 
omitted.)  

 

•   Davis v. Kania, 48 Conn. Sup. 141, 145-146, 836 A.2d 480 
(2003). “Because both the plaintiff and defendant were 
parties to the California action and the judgment neither 
contravenes Connecticut policy nor violates its laws, the 
plaintiff can, therefore, enforce his legal right in the state of 
Connecticut.” 
 

•   Lord v. Lord, Superior Court, Judicial District of Fairfield at 

Bridgeport, No. CV01 0380279 (Aug. 20, 2002) (33 Conn. L. 
Rptr. 88, 90) (2002 Conn. Super. LEXIS 2748) (2002 WL 
31125621). “If parties could consent to jurisdiction in any 
forum, provisions of the UCCJEA itself would be meaningless. 
General Statues § 46b-115k provides that ‘a court of this 
state has jurisdiction to make an initial child custody 
determination if’ certain facts are present. Notably, an 
agreement by the parties that a court shall have subject 
matter jurisdiction is not one of those factors. General 
Statues § 46b-115l provides that ‘a court of this state which 
has made a child custody determination pursuant to sections 
46b-115k to 46b-115m, inclusive, has exclusive, continuing 
jurisdiction over the determination until’ certain 
determinations are made by Connecticut or other state 
courts. Again, not included in this determination is whether

Danbury, No. FA01-0344498 S (March 22, 2002) (2002 
Conn. Super. LEXIS 898) (2002 WL 653241). “Connecticut is 
not the ‘home state’ of the minor child as that term is 
defined by § 46b-115a(7) of the Connecticut General 
Statutes. 

Under the provisions of the UCCJEA, the court has 
exercised temporary jurisdiction in this matter and has 
entered the temporary emergency orders recited above in 
what it found to be the best interests of the minor child and 
to address the concerns raised by the plaintiff regarding 
alleged efforts by the defendant to deny the plaintiff access 
to his minor child.” 

 

•  Guillory v. Francks, Superior Court, Judicial District of 

Windham at Willimantic, No. FA01-0065736S (Feb. 14, 
2002) (2002 Conn. Super. LEXIS 628) (2002 WL 442145). 
“From the record before this court the court concludes that 
the Florida court continues to exercise jurisdiction in the 
case . . . . This court is convinced, based upon the 
continuing activity in the Florida court, that Samantha's 
presence here in Connecticut is due to a temporary custody 
order in favor of the plaintiff and thus pursuant to § 46b-
115(7) Florida remains the home state of Samantha.” 

  Graham v. Graham, Superior Court, Judicial District of 

Middlesex at Middletown, No. FA92-65185 (Feb. 6, 2002)  
(2002 Conn. Super. LEXIS 288) (2002 WL 241493). “Under 
the UCCJEA, jurisdiction largely depends on the status of the 
involved individuals on the date of the commencement of the 
proceeding. Jurisdiction attaches at the commencement of a 
proceeding. C.G.S. § 46b-115a (5).” 

  Gilman v. Gilman, Superior Court, Judicial District of New 
London at Norwich, No. 0121957S (May 22, 2001) (2001 
Conn. Super. LEXIS 1453) (2001 WL 688610). “The new act 
represents a marked difference from what had been 
Connecticut General Statute § 46b-93. Under the former 
statute, a court of this state could exercise jurisdiction if this 
state was the home state of the child at the time the 
proceeding was commenced or it was in the best interest of 
the child that the court exercise jurisdiction because the 
child and his parents had a significant connection to the 
state. The UCCJEA alters the analysis of the initial 
determination of child custody. Specifically, the new act 
requires that the ‘home state’ determination be made as a 
condition precedent to an examination as to whether the 
child and parent have significant connections with this state. 
The new act also eliminates that analysis on the basis of ‘the

(PKPA) 

Abduction 

Article 13: “Notwithstanding the provisions of the 

preceding Article, the judicial or administrative authority of 
the requested State is not bound to order the return of the 
child if the person, institution or other body which opposes 
its return establishes that — 

[Article 13]b  there is a grave risk that his or her return

otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.” 
(Emphasis added) 

 

•  Grave Risk of Harm: “Article 13(b) of the Convention 

requires that the child be placed in a ‘grave risk’ of harm. 
Webster's New World Dictionary, 2nd. College Edition defines 
grave as: ‘of a threatening nature; indicating great danger; 
ominous [a grave illness]’. In the psychological context this 
court accepts Dr. Grenier's definition that ‘grave’ ... ‘would 
be that their day-to-day functioning and their ability to 
function at all would be most urgently wiped out or done 
away with to the point that the person could not conduct a 
normal kind of life.’” Renovales v. Roosa, Superior Court, 
Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, No. 
FA91-0392232 (Sep. 27, 1991) (5 Conn. L. Rptr. 609, 610) 
(1991 Conn. Super. LEXIS 2215). 
 

•  Temporary Emergency Jurisdiction: “(a) A court of this 
state has temporary emergency jurisdiction if the child is 
present in this state and (1) the child has been abandoned, 
or (2) it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child 
because the child, a sibling or a parent has been, or is under 
a threat of being, abused or mistreated. As used in this 
subsection with respect to a child, ‘abused’ has the same 
meaning as provided in section 46b-120.” Conn. Gen. Stat.  
§ 46b-115n (2023). 

 

Parental Kidnapping-39 

•  Abused: “A child may be found ‘abused’ who (A) has been 

inflicted with physical injury or injuries other than by 
accidental means, (B) has injuries that are at variance with 
the history given of them, or (C) is in a condition that is the 
result of maltreatment, including, but not limited to, 
malnutrition, sexual molestation or exploitation, deprivation 
of necessities, emotional maltreatment or cruel 
punishment;” Conn. Gen. Stat. § 46b-120(5) (2023). 

  Undertakings: “Return plus conditions (‘undertakings’) can 
in some, maybe many, cases properly accommodate the 
interest in the child's welfare to the interests of the country 
of the child's habitual residence. Often the bulk of the 
evidence concerning risk of harm will be found in that 
country and the left-behind parent's defense to charges of 
abuse may be more difficult and costly to prepare and 
present in the country to which the abducter has fled. But in 
cases of child abuse the balance may shift against return 
plus conditions.” Van De Sande v. Van De Sande, 431 F.3d 
567, 571-72 (7th Cir. 2005).

him to a zone of war, famine, or disease; or (2) in cases of 
serious abuse or neglect, or extraordinary emotional 
dependence, when the court in the country of habitual 
residence, for whatever reason, may be incapable or 
unwilling to give the child adequate protection.’ Blondin IV, 
238 F.3d at 162 (quotation marks omitted). The potential 
harm to the child must be severe, and the ‘[t]he level of risk 
and danger required to trigger this exception has 
consistently been held to be very high.’ Norden-Powers v.

Beveridge, 125 F. Supp. 2d 634, 640 (E.D.N.Y. 2000) (citing 
cases). The grave risk involves not only the magnitude of 
the potential harm but also the probability that the harm will 
materialize. Van de Sande v. Van de Sande, 431 F.3d 567, 
570 (7th Cir. 2005).” 
 

•  Turner v. Frowein, 253 Conn. 312, 351, 752 A.2d 955 

(2000). “We emphasis that we do not disturb or modify the 
trial court’s finding that returning the child to the defendant 
would expose him to a ‘grave’ risk of harm, within the 
meaning of article 13b. Thus, if the trial court remains 
unable to find any reasonable means of repatriation that 
would not effectively place the child in the defendant’s 
immediate custody, either expressly or de facto, it should 
deny the petition under the Hague Convention.” 
 

•  Blondin v. Dubois, 189 F.3d 240, 249 (2nd Cir. 1999). 

“Under the circumstances presented, we think it appropriate 
to remand this matter to the District Court for further 
consideration of the range of remedies that might allow both 
the return of the children to their home country and their 
protection from harm, pending a custody award in due 
course by a French court with proper jurisdiction.” 
 

•  State v. Vakilzaden, 251 Conn. 656, 663, n.8, 742 A.2d 767 
(1999). “Thus, a parent who temporarily ‘abducts’ a child in 
an effort to safeguard that child from an abusive situation, 
but seeks appropriate legal redress under § 46b-93 (a) (3) 
(B) as soon as is feasible under the circumstances, could not 
meet the necessary mens rea for custodial interference 
because he or she would have the legal right to take the 
child to protect him or her. We are confident that our law 
enforcement authorities and our courts will be sensitive to 
this reality.”

  Dreiling v. Dreiling, Superior Court, Judicial District of 

Hartford at Hartford, Nos. FA-155040055S, FA-154080175S 
(Apr. 14, 2016) (2016 WL 1728242) (2016 Conn. Super. 
LEXIS 779). “A Connecticut court may have temporary 
jurisdiction to make a decision regarding custody if the child 
is within this state and it is necessary in an emergency to 
protect the child because the child or a sibling has been 
under a threat of being abused or mistreated. § 46b-
115n(a)(2). If there is no previous child custody 
determination enforceable under the UCCJEA and a child 
custody proceeding has not been commenced in a court 
having jurisdiction under a provision substantially similar to 
§ 46b-115k, § 46b-115l, or § 46b-115m, a child custody 
determination made pursuant to § 46b-115n will remain in 
effect until an order is obtained from a court that has 
jurisdiction under a provision substantially similar to § 46b-

New London, Regional Family Trial Docket at Middletown, 
No. FA 99-0551913S (Apr. 24, 2003) (2003 Conn. Super. 
LEXIS 1243) (2003 WL 21040430). “Children need - it is 
their best interest - to have a custodial parent who is 
physically and emotionally safe. Implicit in our laws is the 
notion that one parent must be free from abuse at the hands 
of the other. State and federal law recognize the legitimacy 
of domestic violence victims relocating with their children to 
escape abuse.”  
 

•  Harliwich v. Harliwich, Superior Court, Judicial District of 

Tolland at Rockville, No. FA 98-68306 S (Dec. 3, 1998) 
(1998 Conn. Super. Lexis 3401) (1998 WL 867328). "There 
was no substantial evidence that the child's return would 
expose him to physical or psychological harm or otherwise 
place him in an intolerable situation." 
 

 

•  Pantazatou v. Pantazatos, Superior Court, Judicial District of 
Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, No. FA 960713571S (Sept. 
24, 1997) (1997 Conn. Super. LEXIS 2617) (1997 WL 
614519). “Did the respondent mother prove by clear and 
convincing evidence that there was grave risk of 
psychological harm of the child if returned to Greece? The 
answer is yes. The Court was clearly convinced that to return 
the child without the mother would create a grave risk of 
psychological harm to the child and more particularly to 
remove Nicole back to Greece without her mother would 
create greatest risk of serious psychological harm both short 
and long term.” 
 

•  Renovales v. Roosa, Superior Court, Judicial District of 

Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, No. FA 91-0392232 (Sept. 
27, 1991) (1991 Conn. Super. Lexis 2215) (1991 WL 
204483). "The court finds that the respondent has failed to 
prove by 'clear and convincing' evidence that the children 
will be ' exposed' to grave risk of either physical or 
psychological harm or that they will be placed in an 
intolerable situation." 

  Van de Sande v. Van de Sande, 431 F.3d 567, 571 (7th Circ. 

2005). “If handing over custody of a child to an abusive 
parent creates a grave risk of harm to the child, in the sense 
that the parent may with some nonnegligible probability 
injure the child, the child should not be handed over, 
however severely the law of the parent's country might 
punish such behavior. In such a case, any order divesting 
the abducting parent of custody would have to be 
conditioned on the child's being kept out of the custody of

returning the children to Sweden would create a grave risk 
of psychological harm and an intolerable situation for them.”

knowing that he has no legal right to do so, he takes or

(2022).  “To the extent that the Appellate Court suggests 
that § 53a-98 (a) (3) imposes a requirement that an 
individual ‘compel’ a child to return to his or her lawful 
custodian, we disagree. A ‘compel’ requirement is too strong 
of a characterization of an individual's obligation under the 
statute. Rather, we conclude that an individual is required to 
use efforts commensurate with the situation to satisfy the 
requirements of § 53a-98 (a) (3). The effort required in any 
given situation, and whether an individual has satisfied the 
mandates of § 53a-98 (a) (3), will vary and be dependent 
on any number of facts and considerations, including, 
without limitation, the age of the child and the relationship 
between the individual and the child. As the defendant

location, or take some other action to physically return the 
child to his or her lawful custodian. Although parents of an 
older child may not have the same ability to physically move 
their child, the acknowledgment that parents of a young 
child may need to physically return the child highlights the 
obligation of a parent to do something to effectuate the 
return of the child, regardless of the child's age. For parents 
of an older child, there may be fewer coercive measures at 
their disposal, beyond verbal commands, but there is still an 
obligation to do something to effectuate the return of the 
child. However, the successful return of the child to his or 
her lawful custodian may not be necessary to satisfy the 
requirements of § 53a-98 (a) (3). See footnote 2 of this 
opinion. Because, as we will explain, the defendant took no 
steps to return the children to their father, we need not 
decide, in this case, the more difficult question of what 
additional steps an individual may be required to take when 
he or she has taken some action to return the children but 
the children do not comply.” 
 

•  Bouchard v. Sundberg, 80 Conn. App. 180, 201-02, 834 
A.2d 744 (2003). “In Vakilzaden, the Supreme Court 
considered for the first time whether the tort of child 
abduction or custodial interference applied to a parent who 
had joint custody of the subject child. State v. Vakilzaden, 
supra, 251 Conn. at 662. That case did not, as the plaintiff 
argues, abrogate the requirement of an extralegal taking of 
custody for the tort of custodial interference. The Supreme 
Court expressly decided that a parent enjoying joint custody 
could be liable for the crime of custodial interference and, in 
that respect, overruled Marshak. See id., at 664.”

Superior Court, Judicial District of Waterbury, Complex 
Litigation, No. X01 CV-02-0179481-S (Nov. 3, 2003) (48 
Conn. Supp. 554, 554-555) (36 Conn. L. Rptr. 69). “This 
action concerns the claimed abduction of the plaintiff's two 
(2) minor children by the children's father, the plaintiff's ex-
husband. The claim is that he, with the assistance of the 
other named defendants, removed the children from the 
United States to Egypt via Ireland. The other named 
defendants are the owner and/or carrier for the 
international flight, a global aviation and manufacturing 
business, and a private airline charter service. The mother 
and the father share joint legal custody; the plaintiff mother 
has physical custody. The complaint asserts four (4) causes 
of action: 1) Interference with Custodial Relations; 2) 
Negligence; 3) False Imprisonment; and 4) Emotional 
Distress.”

•   State v. Vakilzaden, 251 Conn. 656, 662, 742 A.2d 767 

(1999). “. . .a joint custodian is not inherently immune from 
criminal prosecution based solely on his or her status as 
joint custodian if the state can prove all elements of the 
custodial interference statute, including both knowledge and 
intent, beyond a reasonable doubt.”  

 
•   Brown v. Brown, 195 Conn. 98, 119-120, 486 A.2d 1116 

(1985). “Geared as the PKPA is toward establishing national 
jurisdictional standards that endeavor to reduce interstate 
child abductions, the application of the PKPA to this case 
initially turns on the definition of a ‘custody determination.’ 
We believe that the orders of the Florida court which, in 
effect, generated this Connecticut action, fall squarely within 
the PKPA definition of a ‘custody determination.’ 28 U.S.C. § 
1738A (b) (3).”  

  Agnello v. Becker, 184 Conn. 421, 432-433, 440 A.2d 172 
(1981). “The defendant also claims that the ‘reprehensible 
conduct’ of the plaintiff, in taking the child from the home of 
the defendant and allegedly ‘concealing’ her from the 
defendant, supports the trial court’s conclusion that the New 
Jersey decree should not be recognized . . . . We initially 
note that this provision [Conn. Gen. Stats. §46b-98(a) and 
N.J. Stat. Ann. §2A:34-36(a)] does not set forth any new 
bases for jurisdiction. Secondly, under this section, the 
determination of whether the plaintiff’s conduct was 
reprehensible was more properly a question for the New 
Jersey court. Thirdly, we point out that the act does not 
require a state to decline to exercise its jurisdiction over the 
matter for such conduct.”

Parental Kidnapping-53 

…the court's conclusion that the concern over possible 
abduction was ‘wither[ing]’ and that, as a consequence, the 
foreseeability of abduction was ‘decreasing’ is not 
supportable. The question is not whether the risk 
of abduction was low or had diminished over time, but 
whether it remained foreseeable that Saba could be abducted 
by her father. See Lodge v. Arett Sales Corp., 246 Conn. 563, 
572, 717 A.2d 215 (1998).” 
 

In Vakilzaden, the Supreme Court considered for the first 
time whether the tort of child abduction or custodial 
interference applied to a parent who had joint custody of the 
subject child . . . . That case did not, as the plaintiff argues, 
abrogate the requirement of an extralegal taking of custody 
for the tort of custodial interference. The Supreme Court 
expressly decided that a parent enjoying joint custody could 
be liable for the crime of custodial interference and, in that 
respect, overruled Marshak.”  
 

The state argues that we should overrule Marshak and allow 
joint custodians to be held criminally liable if, in abducting 
their own child, their intent is to deprive the other joint 
custodian of his or her equal parental rights permanently or 
for a protracted period of time in accordance with General 
Statutes § 53a-98.  We agree that Marshak should be 
overruled and that a joint custodian is not inherently immune 
from criminal prosecution based solely on his or her status as 
joint custodian if the state can prove all elements of the 
custodial interference statute, including both knowledge and 
intent, beyond a reasonable doubt.”

Custodial interference in the first degree: Class D 
felony. “(a) A person is guilty of custodial interference in 
the first degree when he commits custodial interference in 
the second degree as provided in section 53a-98: (1) Under 
circumstances which expose the child or person taken or 
enticed from lawful custody or the child held after a request 
by the lawful custodian for his return to a risk that his 
safety will be endangered or his health materially impaired; 
or (2) by taking, enticing or detaining the child or person 
out of this state.”  

Custodial interference in the second degree: Class A 
misdemeanor. “(a) A person is guilty of custodial 
interference in the second degree when: (1) Being a 
relative of a child who is less than sixteen years old and 
intending to hold such child permanently or for a protracted 
period and knowing that he has no legal right to do so, he 
takes or entices such child from his lawful custodian; (2) 
knowing that he has no legal right to do so, he takes or 
entices from lawful custody any incompetent person or any 
person entrusted by authority of law to the custody of 
another person or institution; or (3) knowing that he has no 
legal right to do so, he holds, keeps or otherwise refuses to 
return a child who is less than sixteen years old to such 
child's lawful custodian after a request by such custodian 
for the return of such child.”  

Attempted Kidnapping, George Coppolo, Connecticut 
General Assembly, Office of Legislative Research Report, 
2004-R-0272 (February 27, 2004).  

“ . . . in 1995, the legislature increased the penalty, from a 
class A misdemeanor to a class D felony for ‘detaining’ a 
child under 16 out of state when, knowing he has no legal 
right to do so, someone refuses to return the child to his 
lawful custodian after the custodian requests his return (PA 
95-206)(See CGS § 53a-97). Generally, refusing to return a 
child after a request is second-degree custodial 
interference, a class A misdemeanor. Prior law it first-
degree custodial interference, a class D felony, only for 
‘taking’ or ‘enticing the child out of state.’”

•   Indian child: “means any unmarried person who is under 
age eighteen and is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe 
or (b) is eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is 
the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe;” 25

Secretary because of their status as Indians, including any 
Alaska Native village as defined in section 1602(c) of title 
43;" 25 U.S.C. § 1903(8). 
  

•   Exclusive jurisdiction: "An Indian tribe shall have 

jurisdiction exclusive as to any State over any child custody 
proceeding involving an Indian child who resides or is 
domiciled within the reservation of such tribe, except where 
such jurisdiction is otherwise vested in the State by existing 
Federal law. Where an Indian child is a ward of a tribal 
court, the Indian tribe shall retain exclusive jurisdiction, 
notwithstanding the residence or domicile of the child." 25

after a visit or other temporary relinquishment of 
custody, the court shall decline jurisdiction over such

provides a higher standard of protection to the rights of 
the parent or Indian custodian of an Indian child than the 
rights provided under this subchapter, the State or 
Federal court shall apply the State or Federal standard.” 

 1922. Emergency removal or placement of child; 

termination; appropriate action. “Nothing in this 
subchapter shall be construed to prevent the emergency 
removal of an Indian child who is a resident of or is 
domiciled on a reservation, but temporarily located off 
the reservation, from his parent or Indian custodian or 
the emergency placement of such child in a foster home 
or institution, under applicable State law, in order to 
prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child. 
The State authority, official, or agency involved shall 
insure that the emergency removal or placement 
terminates immediately when such removal or placement 
is no longer necessary to prevent imminent physical 
damage or harm to the child and shall expeditiously 
initiate a child custody proceeding subject to the 
provisions of this subchapter, transfer the child to the 
jurisdiction of the appropriate Indian tribe, or restore the 
child to the parent or Indian custodian, as may be 
appropriate.” 
 

  §

•  Conn. Gen. Stat. (2023) 

Chapter 815p – Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and 
Enforcement Act.   

Application to Indian tribes. “A child custody proceeding 
that pertains to an Indian child as defined in the Indian 
Child Welfare Act, 25 USC Section 1901 et seq., is not 
subject to this chapter to the extent that it is governed 
by the Indian Child Welfare Act.” Conn. Gen. Stat. § 46b-
115c (2023). 

 

"Section 110 [25 U.S.C. §1920] establishes a 'clean 
hands' doctrine with respect to petitions in State court 
for the custody of an Indian child by a person who 
improperly has such child in physical custody. It is aimed 
at those persons who improperly secure or improperly 
retain custody of the child without the consent of the 
parent or Indian custodian and without the sanction of 
law. It is intended to bar such person from taking 
advantage of their wrongful conduct in a subsequent 
petition for custody. The child is to be returned to the 
parent or Indian custodian by the court unless such 
return would result in substantial and immediate physical 
damage or threat of physical danger to the child. It is not 
intended that any such showing be by or on behalf of the 
wrongful petitioner.”

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
