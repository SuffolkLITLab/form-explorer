INSTRUCTIONS FOR 
 

PURPOSE OF THE FORM: 
 
 
Either the initiating or responding IV-D agency may use this transmittal form to request or provide additional information or services 
 
in previously-referred IV-D intergovernmental cases.  Do not use the CSE Transmittal #2 for making initial referrals.  Send the 
CSE Transmittal #2 to the local entity working the case, unless directed otherwise by the state’s central registry or the local entity 
 
working the case is unknown.  Also, when an obligor has contested debt certification in the federal collection and enforcement 
 
program and requested an administrative review in the order-issuing state, the submitting state that has an intergovernmental case 
 
with the order-issuing state should use this form to ask the order-issuing state to provide the arrears balance and explain in section 
III.  To request administrative review in an order-issuing state where there is no open intergovernmental case, use CSE Transmittal 
 
 
#3. 
 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The information on this form may be disclosed as authorized by law. 
 

 

If you are not the intended recipient, you are hereby notified that any use, disclosure, distribution, or copying of this form or its 
contents is strictly prohibited. 
 

 

 

 

 
Italicized text that appears within a “box” refers to policy or provides additional information. 

 

 

 

 
For an address outside the United States, be sure to include the foreign country and postal code. 

 

Tribal IV-D programs may choose to use the federal Intergovernmental forms.  However, they are not required to 
use or accept such forms.  If you have any questions, contact the tribal IV-D agency directly using the contact 
 
information on the OCSE website. 
 

  

 

 

 

If this is a tribal IV-D case, note that tribal locator codes uniquely identify tribal cases with “9” in the first position, 
 
0 (zero) in the second position, and then a 3-character tribal code defined by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

HEADING/CAPTION:

•   Check the appropriate box to identify the type of  IV-D case: TANF,  IV-E foster care,  Medicaid  only,  former assistance,  

or  never assistance.  

 
 

TANF means the obligee’s family is currently receiving IV-A cash payments.  A Medicaid only case is a case in 
 
which the obligee’s family receives Medicaid but does not receive TANF.  A former assistance case might be a case 
 
for state arrears only or for a family that previously received TANF, but is not doing so at this time.

tribunal number. 
 

 

The responding jurisdiction is the jurisdiction that is working the case at the request of the initiating jurisdiction. 
  
Under “IV-D case identifier”, enter the number/identifier identical to the one submitted on the Federal Case Registry, 
 
 
which is a left-justified up to 15-character alphanumeric field, allowing all characters except asterisk and backslash,

any other appropriate reference number that the responding tribunal may use to identify the case, if known. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  In the space marked “From:”, list the name and address (street, PO Box, city, state, and zip code) of the agency that is 
 
 

 

 

sending the CSE Transmittal #2.

The initiating jurisdiction is the jurisdiction that referred the case to the responding jurisdiction for services. Under 
 
“IV-D case identifier”, enter the number/identifier identical to the one submitted on the Federal Case Registry, which 
is a left-justified up to 15-character alphanumeric field, allowing all characters except asterisk and backslash, and 
with all characters in uppercase.  Under “tribunal number”, you may enter the docket number, cause number, or any 
 
  
other appropriate reference number that the initiating tribunal has assigned to the case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Enter the payment locator code and state to which payments should be sent. 
  
 

 

 

 

 

In the “NOTE:” section, check any of the following that apply: 
 
 

 

 

 

•  Nondisclosure Finding/Affidavit attached – If there is a finding prohibiting disclosure of a party’s or 
 
 
child(ren)’s address/identifying information or an affidavit alleging that disclosure of such information would result in 
risk of harm, check the box for “Nondisclosure Finding/Affidavit attached” and attach a copy of the finding/affidavit in 
 
accordance with section 312 of UIFSA.  If there is a finding/affidavit prohibiting disclosure, the information must be 
sealed and may not be disclosed to the other party or the public.  You may provide the address of the IV-D agency as 
 
a substitute address for the protected party. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

UIFSA requires that the petition or accompanying documents include certain identifying information regarding the 
parties and child(ren) (e.g., residential address, social security number) unless a party alleges in an affidavit or a 
pleading under oath that the health, safety, or liberty of a party or child would be jeopardized by disclosure of such 
information.  In that event, the information must be sealed. 
 
If a jurisdiction has reason to believe that information should not be released because of safety concerns, it should 
 
ensure that there is a nondisclosure finding or an allegation in an affidavit or the pleading that disclosure of 
identifying information would result in a risk or harm, as provided under section 312 of UIFSA.  In addition to 
 
identifying information included on this form, it may be appropriate to submit certain financial information under seal. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  This form sent through EDE – Check if this form was sent through the Electronic Document Exchange (EDE). 
 
 
 
•  This request or information sent through CSENet – Check if this request or information was sent through 
 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CSENet and EDE transactions are the recommended methods for making requests or sending information to 
another state.  If CSENet is not listed as an option on the form, then it cannot be used to convey any of the 
requests or information provided on the form.  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Supporting documentation should be sent through EDE, whenever possible.

•  Check item 1 “The initiating agency has closed its IV-D intergovernmental case because ________.” to inform the 
 
responding agency you have closed the case.  List the reason for the closure in the space provided.  See 45 CFR

agency failed to provide __________.” if the initiating agency failed to provide requested information necessary to 
process the case.  Since this is a 60-day notice, as required by federal regulations, the date you list must be at least 60

Support Enforcement.  Other electronic means, such as encrypted attachments to e-mails may be used if the encryption 
 
method is compliant with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2 (FIPS PUB 140-2).

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
