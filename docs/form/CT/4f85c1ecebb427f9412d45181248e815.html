Syllabus

The defendant mother appealed to this court from the judgment of the trial
court granting an application for relief from abuse filed on behalf of
the minor plaintiff, V, by her father and issuing a restraining order
protecting V against the defendant. The parents’ marriage had been
dissolved in New York, and, in the dissolution decree, the court incorpo-
rated by reference their agreement that they would have joint legal
custody of V and that they would share parenting time with V in accor-
dance with a detailed schedule. The parents and V later moved to Con-
necticut and the foreign dissolution judgment was registered in this
state. Shortly thereafter, following motions filed by both parents, the
dissolution judgment was modified, the father was awarded sole physical
custody of V, and the mother’s parenting time with V was limited to
supervised visitation at the father’s discretion. Thereafter, the father
filed an application for relief from abuse on behalf of V against the
mother, alleging that the mother had attempted to abduct V from her
home and her private school despite the court order providing the
mother parenting time with V only when supervised and at the father’s
discretion. After a hearing, the court granted the application and issued
a restraining order with an expiration date one year later. Shortly after
the expiration date of the first restraining order, the father filed a new
application for relief from abuse, stating that, upon expiration of the
prior restraining order, the mother began appearing, uninvited, at V’s
home, at the private school she attended, and at her gymnastics classes
and that the mother’s behavior had been escalating. He also alleged that
the mother’s actions caused V to be anxious and fearful that the mother
was trying to abduct her. The trial court, after a hearing, granted the
application and issued a new restraining order, again with an expiration
date one year later. Held that, contrary to the mother’s claim, the trial
court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction as the father had standing
to pursue a restraining order on behalf of V, as her next friend: the
interests of the father and V were not adverse and, to the contrary, were
aligned because, at the time the father filed the second application for
relief from abuse on behalf of V, he had sole physical custody of V and
had been granted the discretion to determine whether or not to permit
the mother to have supervised visitation with her, and this authority
necessarily resulted from a determination that it was in the best interest
of V that the father be responsible for her, and the trial court specifically
credited the testimony of V’s guardian ad litem that the father was a
perfectly capable custodian for V and that it was in V’s best interest
that the restraining order be issued; moreover, the mother offered no
specific basis for her contention that the father’s interests were adverse
to those of V and, conversely, her argument contradicted the evidence
the court credited at the hearing.

Argued October 6, 2022—officially released March 14, 2023

Procedural History

Application for relief from abuse, brought to the
Superior Court in the judicial district of New Haven,
where the court, Grossman, J., granted the application
and issued an order of protection, and the defendant
appealed to this court. Affirmed.

V. V., self-represented, the appellant (defendant).

Opinion

SHELDON, J. The self-represented defendant, V. V.,
appeals from the judgment of the trial court granting
the application for relief from abuse filed by E. V. (E),
on behalf of the plaintiff, V. V. (V), the minor daughter
of the defendant and E,1 pursuant to General Statutes
§ 46b-15.2 On appeal, the defendant claims that the court
lacked subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that
E lacked standing to bring the application on behalf of
V, as her next friend, because E’s interests were adverse
to those of V.3 We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the
judgment of the trial court.

The following undisputed facts and procedural his-
tory are relevant to our resolution of this appeal.4 E
and the defendant were married in April, 2013, and
have one minor child, V, born in December, 2013. On
September 10, 2015, the Supreme Court of the state of
New York, county of New York, dissolved the marriage
between the defendant and E. In the dissolution decree,
the court incorporated by reference the parties’ June
18, 2015 agreement, in which the parties agreed that
they would have joint legal custody of V and that they
would share parenting time with V in accordance with
a detailed parenting time schedule. The defendant, V,
and E subsequently relocated to the New Haven area.

On May 7, 2019, E, pursuant to General Statutes § 46b-
71 (a),5 registered the foreign dissolution judgment in
the Superior Court in the judicial district of New Haven.
Subsequently, the defendant and E each filed several
motions in the Superior Court, seeking to modify their
custody and visitation rights with respect to V. V. V. v.
E. V., Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven,
Docket No. FA-19-4073157-S. In May, 2019, the court
modified the dissolution judgment, awarded E sole
physical custody of V, and ordered that the defendant’s
parenting time with V be limited to supervised visitation
at E’s discretion. V. V. v. E. V., supra (May 21, 2019).

On December 11, 2020, E, on behalf of V, filed a prior
application for relief from abuse against the defendant
in a proceeding in the Superior Court. V. V. v. V. V.,
Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket
No. FA-20-5049453-S. In support of this application, E
averred that the defendant, who suffers from bipolar
disorder with psychosis, had attempted to abduct V
from her home and her private school despite the court
order providing the defendant parenting time with V
only when supervised and at E’s discretion. On Decem-
ber 23, 2020, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss
this application on the ground, inter alia, that E lacked
standing to bring the action on behalf of V, which was
denied summarily by the court on the same date. Also
on December 23, 2020, the court, after a hearing, granted
the application for relief from abuse and issued a
restraining order, set to expire on December 23, 2021,

requiring the defendant: to surrender or transfer all
firearms and ammunition; not to assault, threaten,
abuse, harass, follow, interfere with, or stalk V; to stay
away from the home of V and wherever V shall reside;
not to contact V in any manner; and to stay 100 yards
away from V.6

On July 9, 2021, in Docket No. FA-19-4073157-S, the
court modified the December 23, 2020 restraining order
to allow the defendant to participate in therapeutic
visitation sessions with V and a therapist, Kacian Fab-
ish. On that same date, the court also appointed, pursu-
ant to the parties’ agreement, Attorney Corrine Boni-
Vendola to serve as guardian ad litem for V.

On January 27, 2022, E, on behalf of V, filed the
application for relief from abuse against the defendant
that is the subject of this appeal, together with a per-
sonal affidavit of supporting facts. In the application,
E contended that V had been subjected to a continuous
threat of present physical pain or physical injury, stalk-
ing, a pattern of threatening, and/or coercive control
by the defendant. The application requested that the
court issue a restraining order mandating that the defen-
dant: not assault, threaten, abuse, harass, follow, inter-
fere with, or stalk V; stay away from V’s home or wher-
ever she shall reside; not contact V in any manner,
including by written, electronic or telephonic means;
not contact V’s home, workplace, or other persons with
whom the contact would be likely to cause annoyance
or alarm to V; and stay 100 yards away from V. The
application further requested that the court issue the
restraining order ex parte on the ground that E believed
there was an immediate and present physical danger
to V.

In E’s affidavit of facts submitted in support of the
application for relief from abuse, he averred that, fol-
lowing the entry of the December 23, 2020 order of
protection, V no longer had nightmares and was no
longer afraid. E further averred that, after the expiration
of the December 23, 2020 restraining order, the defen-
dant began appearing, uninvited, at V’s home, at the
private school she attended, and at her gymnastics
classes, and that the defendant’s ‘‘behavior ha[d] been
escalating.’’ E concluded his affidavit by averring that
V ‘‘was thriving. Now that [the defendant] is stalking
her, she is anxious when leaving school or going to
gymnastic[s] class. She has a fear that [the defendant]
is trying to take her.’’

On January 27, 2022, the court issued an ex parte
restraining order against the defendant and scheduled
a hearing for February 4, 2022. On February 2, 2022,
the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the application
for a domestic violence restraining order on the ground,
inter alia, that the court lacked subject matter jurisdic-
tion. In her memorandum of law in support of the
motion to dismiss, the defendant argued, in part, that E

lacked standing to bring the application for a restraining
order on behalf of V. The defendant’s motion to dismiss
was not adjudicated.7

On February 4, 2022, the court held a hearing on the
application for a restraining order. The court heard
testimony at the hearing from E, Boni-Vendola, and the
defendant. E testified that V had been doing much better
while the prior restraining order was in effect, for then
‘‘[e]verything was very calm’’ and there were ‘‘no issues’’
between V and the defendant. E further testified, how-
ever, that after the expiration of the prior restraining
order, the defendant stopped attending therapeutic visi-
tation with V and Fabish and began appearing, uninvited
and unannounced, in places and at events where V was
present. Specifically, E testified regarding a series of
incidents that occurred between January 5 and 26, 2022,
in which the defendant came to V’s school when E was
picking her up, followed E and V home from school,
repeatedly rang their home doorbell, and walked her
dog back and forth in front of their home for more than
one hour. E also testified that the defendant attended
and recorded V’s gymnastics classes and attempted to
take V from her school. E testified that these incidents
caused V to be terrified of the defendant, to become
very unhappy, and to suffer emotional distress. In addi-
tion, he testified that the defendant’s disruptive conduct
near V’s school threatened V’s continued enrollment in
the school.

Boni-Vendola’s testimony at the hearing corroborated
E’s description of the defendant’s conduct at or near
V’s school. Boni-Vendola also testified that she met
with the defendant before her behavior escalated and
expressed her concerns that the defendant was not
in treatment and that she had ceased her therapeutic
visitation. She then testified that it was in the best
interests of V for the restraining order to be issued, and
she recommended that an exception to the restraining
order be crafted to permit the defendant to see V during
therapeutic visits with Fabish.

The defendant in her testimony disputed that she had
engaged in most of the conduct that served as the basis
for the restraining order, and, alternatively, she testified
that her actions on several of those occasions did not
negatively impact the psychological well-being of V. The
defendant further testified that it was her understanding
that she was permitted to be within 100 yards of V
because the prior restraining order had expired. When
asked whether E had given her permission to have
parenting time with V on those occasions, as required by
the current custody and visitation order, the defendant
stated that she misunderstood the requirements of the
court’s custody and visitation order.

On February 4, 2022, the court granted the application
for relief from abuse and issued a restraining order
protecting V from the defendant. The court stated on

the record at the hearing that it found the testimony of
E and Boni-Vendola to be credible, but it did not credit
the testimony of the defendant. The court found, inter
alia, that ‘‘there have been six incidents since the lapse
of the last restraining order. So, that would be six inci-
dents from December of 2021 to today in which the
[defendant] has appeared at [V’s] school, at [E’s] home,
and at [V’s] events. All of those are events in which the
[defendant] was not expected and not invited, and [E]
testified credibly that those events for which [V] was
present caused [V] a great deal of distress that she is
scared of being taken by [the defendant], that she finds
[the defendant’s] presence to be unnerving and unpre-
dictable. That [V], as a result of the [defendant’s] unex-
pected appearance at these—on these six occasions,
has sort of had some backsliding in terms of her mental
health. That she’d become more anxious; that she has
become more fearful.’’ The court also found that E ‘‘has
demonstrated in his testimony and the guardian [ad
litem] has also recommended that he is a perfectly
capable custodian, that he includes the [defendant]
when it’s appropriate, that he excludes the [defendant]
when it’s appropriate, and under the criteria of [§] 46b-
15, he does meet the requirements to have—be the
sole legal custodian for the period of time while the
restraining order is in place.’’ Consequently, the court
concluded that the credible evidence established that,
pursuant to § 46b-15, V would be at risk of psychological
harm if the requested restraining order were not issued.

Also on February 4, 2022, the court issued a written
order outlining the terms and conditions of
the
restraining order.8 The order required the defendant: to
surrender or transfer all firearms and ammunition; not
to assault, threaten, abuse, harass, follow, interfere
with, or stalk V; to stay away from the home of V and
wherever V shall reside; not to contact V in any manner,
including by written, electronic or telephonic means;
not to contact V’s home, workplace, or any other per-
sons with whom the contact would likely cause annoy-
ance or alarm to V; and to stay 100 yards away from
V. As an additional term and condition, the court
ordered that the defendant ‘‘at all times must stay 100
yards away from [V’s] school, the home of [V] and the
locations where [V] participates in swim and gymnas-
tics. The only exception is court-ordered therapeutic
access with Kacian Fabish, MS LPC. [E] is granted sole,
physical and legal custody of [V].’’ The court set the
restraining order to expire one year later, on February
4, 2023.9 This appeal followed.

On appeal, the defendant claims that the court lacked
subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that E lacked
standing to bring the application for a domestic violence
restraining order on behalf of V, as her next friend,
because E’s interests were adverse to those of V.10 We
disagree.

We begin with the standard of review and relevant
legal principles. ‘‘The issue of standing implicates a
court’s subject matter jurisdiction and is subject to ple-
nary review.’’ Channing Real Estate, LLC v. Gates, 326
Conn. 123, 137, 161 A.3d 1227 (2017). ‘‘Standing is the
legal right to set judicial machinery in motion. One
cannot rightfully invoke the jurisdiction of the court
unless he [or she] has, in an individual or representative
capacity, some real interest in the cause of action, or
a legal or equitable right, title or interest in the subject
matter of the controversy.
. When standing is put
.
in issue, the question is whether the person whose
standing is challenged is a proper party to request an
.’’ (Internal quotation
adjudication of the issue .
marks omitted.) Rodriguez v. Kaiaffa, LLC, 337 Conn.
248, 274, 253 A.3d 13 (2020). ‘‘Standing is not a technical
rule intended to keep aggrieved parties out of court; nor
is it a test of substantive rights. Rather it is a practical
concept designed to ensure that courts and parties are
not vexed by suits brought to vindicate nonjusticiable
interests and that judicial decisions which may affect
the rights of others are forged in hot controversy, with
each view fairly and vigorously represented.’’ (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) Wolfork v. Yale Medical Group,
335 Conn. 448, 471, 239 A.3d 272 (2020). ‘‘It is well
established that, in determining whether a court has
subject matter jurisdiction, every presumption favoring
jurisdiction should be indulged.’’ (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) Jenzack Partners, LLC v. Stoneridge
Associates, LLC, 334 Conn. 374, 382, 222 A.3d 950
(2020).

‘‘A next friend is a person who appears in a lawsuit
to act for the benefit of . . . [a] minor plaintiff . . . .
It is well established that a child may bring a civil action
only by a guardian or next friend, whose responsibility
it is to ensure that the interests of the ward are well
represented.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Har-
ris v. Neale, 197 Conn. App. 147, 149 n.1, 231 A.3d 357
(2020). ‘‘Next friend standing essentially allows a third
party to advance a claim in court on behalf of another
when the party in interest is unable to do so on his or her
own.
. The ‘next friend’ does not himself become
a party to the action in which he participates, but simply
pursues the action on behalf of the real party in inter-
est.’’ (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omit-
ted.) Nonhuman Rights Project, Inc. v. R.W. Commer-
ford & Sons, Inc., 192 Conn. App. 36, 42, 216 A.3d 839,
cert. denied, 333 Conn. 920, 217 A.3d 635 (2019). ‘‘[T]he
proper test for determining whether a person is the
proper party to bring an action on behalf of a minor child
as a guardian or next friend is whether that person’s
interests are adverse to those of the child .

Applying these principles, we conclude that E had
standing to pursue a restraining order on behalf of V,
as her next friend, because E’s interests were not
adverse to those of V. It is evident that the interests of
E and V were aligned for two reasons. Primarily, at the
time that E filed the present application for relief from
abuse on behalf of V, he had sole physical custody of
V and had been granted the discretion to determine
whether or not to permit the defendant to have super-
vised visitation with her. The postdissolution court’s
award of sole physical custody and visitation discretion
to E necessarily resulted from a determination that it
was in the best interest of V that E, her father, be
responsible for her. See generally J. Y. v. M. R., 215
Conn. App. 648, 657–59, 283 A.3d 520 (2022) (court is
required to consider best interest of child when making
or modifying any order regarding custody, care, educa-
tion, visitation, and support of child). Second, the court
in the present case specifically credited the testimony
of Boni-Vendola, V’s guardian ad litem, that it was in
the best interest of V that the restraining order be issued
and that E was a ‘‘perfectly capable custodian’’ for V.
As stated previously, Boni-Vendola had been appointed
by the postdissolution court to be the guardian ad litem
for V on the basis of the agreement of the parties. Boni-
Vendola’s testimony at the restraining order hearing
was made on behalf of V because ‘‘[i]t is well established
that the role of the guardian ad litem is to speak on
behalf of the best interest of the child.’’ In re Tayquon
H., 76 Conn. App. 693, 704, 821 A.2d 796 (2003).

It is not made clear in the defendant’s appellate brief
what is the specific basis for her contention that E’s
interests were adverse to those of V. The defendant,
however, contends that E ‘‘brought this restraining
order action to advance his nonjusticiable interests that
are adverse to [V’s] interests and meant to subject [V] to
his maltreatment ‘continuously’ . . . and in retaliation
against [the defendant] because she filed a Title IX
complaint against [E] at .
. Yale University.’’ (Cita-
.
tion omitted.) The defendant offers no support for her
contention that E continuously mistreated V. Con-
versely, her argument contradicts the evidence that the
court credited at the hearing.

In sum, indulging every presumption in favor of juris-
diction, we conclude that E had standing to apply for
a domestic violence restraining order against the defen-
dant on V’s behalf, while acting in the capacity of her
next friend. As V’s father, and the person to whom the
court previously had granted sole physical custody with
respect to her, E’s interests were not only not adverse
to those of V but in fact were well aligned with those
interests, as confirmed by her guardian ad litem, who
opined at the hearing that the issuance of the restraining
order was in the best interest of V. Therefore, E had
standing to apply for the order here challenged as the

next friend of V.

The judgment is affirmed.

In this opinion the other judges concurred.

the father, E, and the daughter, V, individually by their first initials in this
opinion. Additionally, neither E nor V has participated in this appeal. Thus,
we decide this appeal on the basis of the record, the defendant’s appellate
brief, and the defendant’s oral argument.

2 General Statutes § 46b-15 provides in relevant part: ‘‘(a) Any family or
household member, as defined in section 46b-38a, who is the victim of
domestic violence, as defined in section 46b-1, by another family or house-
hold member may make an application to the Superior Court for relief under

In turn, General Statutes § 46b-1 (b) provides: ‘‘As used in this title, ‘domes-
tic violence’ means: (1) A continuous threat of present physical pain or
physical injury against a family or household member, as defined in section
46b-38a; (2) stalking, including, but not limited to, stalking as described in
section 53a-181d, of such family or household member; (3) a pattern of
including, but not limited to, a pattern of threatening as
threatening,
described in section 53a-62, of such family or household member or a third
party that intimidates such family or household member; or (4) coercive
control of such family or household member, which is a pattern of behavior
that in purpose or effect unreasonably interferes with a person’s free will
and personal liberty. ‘Coercive control’ includes, but is not limited to, unrea-
sonably engaging in any of the following:

‘‘(A) Isolating the family or household member from friends, relatives or

other sources of support;

‘‘(B) Depriving the family or household member of basic necessities;
‘‘(C) Controlling, regulating or monitoring the family or household mem-
ber’s movements, communications, daily behavior, finances, economic
resources or access to services;

‘‘(D) Compelling the family or household member by force, threat or
intimidation, including, but not limited to, threats based on actual or sus-
pected immigration status, to (i) engage in conduct from which such family
or household member has a right to abstain, or (ii) abstain from conduct
that such family or household member has a right to pursue;

‘‘(E) Committing or threatening to commit cruelty to animals that intimi-

dates the family or household member; or

‘‘(F) Forced sex acts, or threats of a sexual nature, including, but not
limited to, threatened acts of sexual conduct, threats based on a person’s
sexuality or threats to release sexual images.’’

3 The defendant’s appellate brief additionally claims that (1) the court
lacked personal jurisdiction, (2) the court’s issuance of a domestic violence
restraining order improperly modified the parties’ settlement agreement
regarding custody that was incorporated into a foreign divorce decree that
was registered in Connecticut, (3) the court violated the statutory bill of
rights for psychiatric patients, General Statutes §§ 17a-540 through 17a-550,
by permitting the defendant to have contact with V at joint therapeutic
sessions with a psychologist, (4) the court’s issuance of a restraining order
infringed on the defendant’s civil liberties as the parent of V, (5) the court
improperly denied her motion to reargue and set aside the restraining order,
and (6) the court manifested bias and prejudice toward her. We carefully
have considered each of the defendant’s six additional claims in light of the
record before us and conclude that they are unfounded and do not merit
substantive discussion. See, e.g., McCullough v. Rocky Hill, 198 Conn. App.
703, 705 n.1, 234 A.3d 1049 (summarily disposing of unfounded claims), cert.
denied, 335 Conn. 985, 242 A.3d 480 (2020).

4 We take judicial notice of the court files in two prior actions between
the parties; V. V. v. E. V., Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven,
Docket No. FA-19-4073157-S; V. V. v. V. V., Superior Court, judicial district
of New Haven, Docket No. FA-20-5049453-S; only to the extent that the
contents of those files are not borne out by the record of the present appeal.
See Plainville v. Almost Home Animal Rescue & Shelter, Inc., 182 Conn.

App. 55, 60 n.3, 187 A.3d 1174 (2018) (appellate court may take judicial
notice of court files in other actions between same parties).

5 General Statutes § 46b-71 (a) provides: ‘‘Any party to an action in which
a foreign matrimonial judgment has been rendered, shall file, with a certified
copy of the foreign matrimonial judgment, in the court in this state in which
enforcement of such judgment is sought, a certification that such judgment
is final, has not been modified, altered, amended, set aside or vacated and
that the enforcement of such judgment has not been stayed or suspended,
and such certificate shall set forth the full name and last-known address of
the other party to such judgment and the name and address of the court in
the foreign state which rendered such judgment.’’

6 The defendant filed two appeals from the judgments rendered in this
prior restraining order action, and this court dismissed those appeals. See
V. V. v. V. V., Connecticut Appellate Court, Docket No. AC 44583 (appeal
dismissed April 20, 2021) (failure to file required appellate documents); see
also V. V. v. V. V., 215 Conn. App. 737, 741, 283 A.3d 1045 (2022) (appeal
dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction).

7 We note that ‘‘[o]nce the question of lack of jurisdiction of a court is
raised, [it] must be disposed of no matter in what form it is presented. . . .
The court must fully resolve it before proceeding further with the case.’’
(Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Ajadi v. Commis-
sioner of Correction, 280 Conn. 514, 535, 911 A.2d 712 (2006); but see
Conboy v. State, 292 Conn. 642, 653 n.16, 974 A.2d 669 (2009) (‘‘[w]hen the
jurisdictional facts are intertwined with the merits of the case, the court
may in its discretion choose to postpone resolution of the jurisdictional
question until the parties complete further discovery or, if necessary, a full
trial on the merits has occurred’’). Although the trial court did not rule on
the defendant’s motion to dismiss, this fact does not impact the resolution
of the present appeal because ‘‘[t]he subject matter jurisdiction requirement
may not be waived by any party, and also may be raised by a party, or by
the court sua sponte, at any stage of the proceedings, including on appeal
. . . .’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Wolfork v. Yale Medical Group,
335 Conn. 448, 459, 239 A.3d 272 (2020).

8 The court, sua sponte, issued a corrected restraining order, which also
is dated February 4, 2022. The only substantive distinction between the
original and corrected orders is the addition in the corrected order of the
provision granting E sole physical and legal custody of V.

9 Despite the expiration of the restraining order on February 4, 2023, the
defendant’s appeal is not moot. See, e.g., L. D. v. G. T., 210 Conn. App. 864,
869 n.4, 271 A.3d 674 (2022) (expiration of domestic violence restraining
order issued pursuant to § 46b-15 does not render appeal from that order
moot due to adverse collateral consequences). Additionally, we note that
E, on January 17, 2023, filed two motions to extend the restraining order that
is the subject of this appeal. The trial court has not acted on these motions.
10 Although the defendant’s principal appellate brief is not a model of
clarity, we pause to define the contours of the defendant’s standing claim
on appeal. The defendant does not contest the general proposition that the
parent of a minor child can bring an application on behalf of the minor
child, as next friend, seeking a domestic violence restraining order against
another parent. See, e.g., Carrubba v. Moskowitz, 274 Conn. 533, 552, 877
A.2d 773 (2005) (‘‘[u]nder normal circumstances,’’ parents of minor child
have standing as next friends of minor child ‘‘because they are presumed
to act in the best interests of the minor child’’); see also L. L. v. M. B., 216
Conn. App. 731, 733, 286 A.3d 489 (2022) (parent commenced application
for domestic violence restraining order on behalf of child against other
parent); L. D. v. G. T., 210 Conn. App. 864, 866, 271 A.3d 674 (2022) (same);
D. S. v. R. S., 199 Conn. App. 11, 13, 234 A.3d 1150 (2020) (same). The
defendant also does not argue that, because Boni-Vendola was appointed
as the guardian ad litem for V, no ‘‘exceptional circumstances’’ existed to
warrant the bringing of the action by E. See, e.g., Perry v. Perry, 312 Conn.
600, 611, 95 A.3d 500 (2014) (outlining certain exceptional circumstances
in which action may be brought on behalf of child by next friend notwith-
standing existence of guardian appointed to protect interests of that child).
11 In support of her standing claim, the defendant relies only on Orsi v.
Senatore, 31 Conn. App. 400, 626 A.2d 750 (1993), rev’d, 230 Conn. 459, 645
A.2d 986 (1994). This court’s judgment in Orsi v. Senatore, supra, 31 Conn.
App. 400, has no precedential value because it was reversed by our Supreme
Court in Orsi v. Senatore, 230 Conn. 459, 645 A.2d 986 (1994). See Harris
v. Commissioner of Correction, 271 Conn. 808, 827–28, 860 A.2d 715 (2004)
(Supreme Court’s reversal of Appellate Court judgment deprives Appellate

Court judgment of any precedential value). For that reason, we do not apply
Orsi v. Senatore, supra, 31 Conn. App. 400.
