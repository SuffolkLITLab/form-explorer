JEFFREY STEWART ET AL. v. OLD REPUBLIC
NATIONAL TITLE INSURANCE COMPANY
(AC 44925)

Bright, C. J., and Alvord and Seeley, Js

Syllabus

The defendant title insurance company denied coverage with respect to the
respective title insurance policies it had issued to the plaintiffs, N Co.,
and J and A, involving their properties. J and A purchased a property
in the town of Greenwich on B Street and, thereafter, N Co., whose
sole member was J, purchased an adjacent property. Neighbors who
also owned property on B Street brought an action against N Co., which
alleged that N Co. had obstructed an easement, which granted rights
to other homeowners to pass over a private portion of B Street. N Co.
allegedly obstructed the easement by, inter alia, extending the lawn,
installing a raised drainage system, and removing a pillar which demar-
cated the private and public portion of the street. The defendant denied
N Co. coverage for defending the neighbors’ action on the basis that
the policy insured N Co.’s title to the land, which did not convey to N
Co. exclusive rights and ownership of the easement at issue, and thus
the policy did not insure N Co.’s exclusive rights to ownership of the
easement. The action against N Co. was settled by an agreement and
subsequently withdrawn, and the defendant refused to pay N Co.’s
expenses in defending it. In a separate incident, J and A thereafter
sought indemnification coverage from the defendant after the town
began proceedings to acquire an abandoned cemetery, pursuant to stat-
ute (§ 19a-308a), which allegedly was on or adjacent to J and A’s prop-
erty. The defendant noted that its policy with J and A excluded actions
resulting from governmental police power and condemnation. Without
notifying the defendant, J and A then brought an action against the
town, seeking a declaratory judgment to quiet title to the driveway
portion of their property that allegedly passed over the cemetery. After
the town acquired the cemetery and quitclaimed the driveway back to
J and A, J and A sought to recover their litigation expenses from the
defendant. The defendant disclaimed coverage, noting, inter alia, that
it did not approve their litigation expenses as required by the policy.
Subsequently, the plaintiffs collectively filed the present action against
the defendant, claiming that it had breached its policies in failing to
provide funds for the costs of defending the actions involving the plain-
tiffs and sought indemnification for costs and attorney’s fees. The defend-
ant thereafter filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial
court granted, finding that there were no genuine issues of material fact
and that the defendant had not breached its duty to defend. On the
plaintiffs’ appeal to this court, held:

1. The trial court properly granted the defendant’s motion for summary
judgment with respect to the claim brought by N Co., as there was no
genuine issue of material fact that the claim for which N Co. sought
coverage was not covered under its title insurance policy, the defendant
had no duty to defend N Co. in the neighbors’ action, and, thus, the
defendant had no duty to indemnify N Co. for losses it incurred in
defending the action: the allegations within the complaint brought
against N Co. clearly and unambiguously established the applicability
of the relevant policy exclusions to any claim for which there might
otherwise be coverage under the defendant’s policy, as the allegations
did not dispute that N Co. had exclusive ownership of the private portion
of the street or challenge N Co.’s title to that property, but, instead,
alleged claims that N Co.’s various actions had obstructed the use and
enjoyment of the easement, and the relief requested in the complaint
sought to guarantee the neighbors’ ability to exercise their rights to
use the easement, thus, the allegations were properly understood as
disputing N Co.’s exclusive interest in the easement and alleging that
N Co. had prevented the full use and enjoyment of others’ rights to the
easement; moreover, N Co.’s reliance on facts beyond the complaint to
establish that title was, in fact, at issue in the neighbors’ action was

without merit, the determination of an insurer’s duty to defend is limited
to the provisions of the insurance policy and the allegations of the
underlying complaint, and, accordingly, this court declined to consider
what actions the parties took during the pendency of the action to
determine whether the complaint disputed the ownership of the private
portion of the street; furthermore, even if the allegations of the complaint
contested N Co.’s ownership of the private portion of the street, the
title insurance policy clearly and unambiguously excluded N Co.’s claim
from coverage, as the allegations arose from N Co.’s own actions in
obstructing the easement and were alleged to have occurred after the
purchase of the property, allegations that clearly and unambiguously
were excluded from coverage.

2. The trial court properly granted the defendant’s motion for summary
judgment with respect to J and A, as there was no genuine issue of
material fact that the claims for which J and A sought coverage were
excluded under their title insurance policy, and, therefore, the defendant
had no duty to defend: contrary to J and A’s assertion that the town
was attempting to take title to real property owned by J and A, their
complaint against the town sought a declaratory judgment for the pur-
pose of having a court decide whether their property contained a ceme-
tery, such that the town could acquire it, and the determination as to
whether there was a cemetery on the property was a condition of the
property and not a matter of title; moreover, a municipality’s acquisition
of property pursuant to § 19a-308a is an exercise of governmental police
power and constitutes an acquisition by condemnation, and, thus, the
exclusions in the title policy pertaining to governmental police power
and the condemning of property clearly and unambiguously applied to
J and A’s claims and established that the defendant did not have a duty
to defend J and A’s action against the town; furthermore, any action
taken by the town with respect to the property would have occurred
after the date the policy was issued and thus be excluded from coverage,
which exclusion was plain and unambiguous.

Argued November 15, 2022—officially released March 21, 2023

Procedural History

Action to recover damages for, inter alia, breach of
contract in connection with a title insurance policy
issued by the defendant to the plaintiffs, and for other
relief, brought to the Superior Court in the judicial dis-
trict of Stamford-Norwalk, where the court, Hon.
Edward T. Krumeich II, judge trial referee, granted the
defendant’s motion for summary judgment and ren-
dered judgment thereon, from which the plaintiffs
appealed to this court. Affirmed.

Opinion

BRIGHT, C. J. The plaintiffs, 9 Byram Dock, LLC
(company),1 and Jeffrey Stewart and Andrea Stewart
(Stewarts), appeal from the summary judgment ren-
dered in favor of the defendant, Old Republic National
Title Insurance Company. On appeal, the plaintiffs claim
that the court improperly concluded that, pursuant to
the plaintiffs’ title insurance policies, the defendant had
no duty to defend the plaintiffs in two actions involving
the plaintiffs’ properties. We disagree and, accordingly,
affirm the judgment of the trial court.

The following facts, which are undisputed, and proce-
dural history are relevant to our resolution of this
appeal. The plaintiffs’ complaint set forth two counts.
Count one was asserted on behalf of the company. The
company alleged that on October 31, 2014, it purchased
real property located at 9 Byram Dock Street in Green-
wich. On that date, the company also purchased an
owner’s policy of title insurance from the defendant for
that property (company policy). In December, 2016,
Robert M. Kennedy, James R. Kennedy, Peter J. Ken-
nedy and Barbara M. Kennedy (Kennedys), owners of
14 Byram Dock Street—a house on the opposite side
of the street from 9 Byram Dock Street—sued the com-
pany, alleging that they ‘‘have a right of way appurtenant
to their land, to pass and repass over the land owned
by and in the possession of the owners of a parcel of
.
land known as Shore Island (the ‘[e]asement’).
The [e]asement grants the rights to pass and repass
motor vehicles over Byram Dock Street to access the
various homes along said street.’’ There are two sec-
tions of Byram Dock Street, a public portion and a
private portion. The easement provides access to Shore
Island over the private portion of Byram Dock Street.
The Kennedys further alleged that the company had
obstructed the easement (Kennedy action).

.

.

Without notifying the defendant about the lawsuit,
the company retained counsel to defend it in the Ken-
nedy action. In May, 2017, the Kennedys filed a revised
complaint to provide greater detail of the company’s
alleged obstruction. According to the revised complaint,
the company had obstructed the easement by extending
a lawn over part of the private portion of Byram Dock
Street, installing a raised drainage system, and removing
a stone pillar which had ‘‘demarcate[d] the entrance to
the private portion of Byram Dock Street.’’ In June,
2017, the company sent a notice of claim letter to the
defendant informing it of the pending action and seek-
ing representation and indemnification. Therein the
company provided the defendant with the Kennedys’
original and revised complaints and described the Ken-
nedys’ allegations as ‘‘[challenging] the [company’s]
right to make .
. changes [to the private portion of
Byram Dock Street] by questioning the [company’s]
the private portion of Byram Dock
ownership of

.

Street.’’

On July 13, 2017, the defendant denied the company
coverage of the Kennedy action, concluding that the
allegations within the revised complaint did not create
the potential for coverage under the company policy,
and, thus, the defendant had no obligation to defend
the company in the action. In particular, the defendant
maintained that the company policy insures title to the
land described in Schedule A, which does not convey
to the company exclusive rights and ownership of the
subject easement, and thus the company policy does
not insure the company’s exclusive rights to ownership
of the easement. The defendant further stated that, in
addition to several exceptions in Schedule B of the
policy, ‘‘which clearly apply to remove coverage for this
claim, there is also the applicable exclusions 3 (a) and
3 (d), which exclude post policy acts of the [company].
Exclusion 3 (a) excludes matters the [company] has
caused (‘created’), permitted (‘suffered’), taken subject
to (‘assumed’), or to which it has consented to be bound
(‘agreed to’). This exclusion applies to remove coverage
for [the Kennedys’] allegations in the revised complaint
which relate to actions of the [company] in obstructing
the easement. In addition, exclusion 3 (d) applies to
remove coverage for matters arising after the date of
policy. The date of [the policy] is October 31, 2014. The
allegations of [the Kennedys] relate to acts . . . ‘start-
ing in 2016. . . .’ See Revised Complaint ¶¶ 5, 6. There-
fore this matter falls within the matters excluded by
exclusions 3 (a) and (d).’’2

The Kennedys again amended their complaint on
October 10, 2017.3 Thereafter, ‘‘[t]he Kennedy [action]
was settled by withdrawal of the [action] and an
agreement by [the Kennedys] to pay for certain restor-
ative work on the easement together with payment of
$10,000 to the [company], which settlement did not
require any payment by the [company] or the Stewarts.’’
The defendant later declined to pay the company’s
expenses for defending the Kennedy action, reaffirming
its previous declination of coverage. Thus, in count one
of the complaint in the present action, the company
alleged that the defendant breached the terms of the
company policy by refusing to reimburse it for such
expenses.

Count two of the plaintiffs’ complaint in the present
action alleged a claim on behalf of the Stewarts. The
Stewarts alleged that they purchased 11 Byram Dock
Street, adjacent to 9 Byram Dock Street, on August 5,
2013. In connection with that purchase, the Stewarts
obtained an owner’s title insurance policy from the
defendant for the property that provides coverage from
August 6, 2013 (Stewart policy). In April, 2016, the Town
of Greenwich Conservation Commission (commission)
recommended to the town of Greenwich (town) that it
acquire, pursuant to General Statutes § 19a-308a,4 an

abandoned African American cemetery, believed to be
on or adjacent to 11 Byram Dock Street.

On September 22, 2016, a public forum was held
before the town’s Board of Selectmen regarding the
acquisition of the cemetery parcel. The Stewarts’ attor-
neys appeared at the hearing and expressed their con-
cern over the lack of evidence as to whether the prop-
erty at issue constituted a cemetery and requested time
to conduct further study, including radar imaging to
detect possible remains. That day, the Stewarts’ attor-
neys also sent a formal letter to the commission and
the town stating that the driveway to 11 Byram Dock
Street, included in the Stewarts’ deeded rights, crossed
over the purported cemetery site and, ‘‘if the parcel
is more definitively established to be an actual burial
ground, [the Stewarts] object to any efforts made by
the [town] . . . to seek to take away or diminish [the
Stewarts’] property rights in the driveway. We further
note that we are speaking of the deeded rights that
as a matter of law cannot be simply extinguished or
diminished through the statutory process being under-
taken by the [t]own at this time.’’ In January, 2016, the
commission submitted a proposal and report to the
town recommending that the town acquire the aban-
doned cemetery. The Stewarts thereafter submitted two
additional formal objection letters to the town.

On May 19, 2017, the Stewarts sent a letter to the
defendant notifying the defendant that their ‘‘ownership
of the [d]riveway [e]asement has recently been called
into question by the [town]. It is expected that the
[town] will, at some point in the near future, formally
challenge the validity of the [d]riveway [e]asement.’’ In
its response on June 29, 2017, the defendant noted that,
although the commission had made a proposal to the
town recommending the town acquire the abandoned
cemetery pursuant to § 19a-308a, the town had not yet
made a ruling or determination to do so. The defendant
declined coverage stating that ‘‘the alleged cemetery
would be a condition of the property and not affect
title to the property.’’ Further, it pointed to language
in the Stewart policy stating that the Stewarts ‘‘are not
insured against loss, costs, attorneys’ fees, and expenses
resulting from: 1. Governmental police power, and the
existence or violation of those portions of any law or
government regulation concerning: a. building; b. zon-
ing; c. land use; d. improvements on the [l]and; e. land
division; and f. environmental protection,’’ ‘‘3. [t]he right
to take the [l]and by condemning it,’’ and ‘‘4. [r]isks
. . . d. that first occur after the [p]olicy [d]ate . . . .’’
The defendant maintained that ‘‘[a]ny action taken by
the [t]own and . . . [c]ommission with respect to the
[p]roperty would certainly occur after the date of [the]
[p]olicy and would [be] excluded from coverage by
[e]xclusion 4d. Additionally, should the [t]own acquire
the [p]roperty pursuant to [§ 19a-308a], it would operate
to [p]ublic
as a [g]overnmental

[t]aking pursuant

[h]ealth and [w]ell-[b]eing and thereby be excluded
from coverage from [e]xclusion 1 and/or [e]xclusion 3.’’
Because no final determination had been made by the
town with respect to the property, the defendant left
open the possibility that it might revisit its decision to
decline coverage on the basis of subsequent events.

.

.

On October 2, 2017, ‘‘[w]ithout notifying [the defend-
ant], the Stewarts sued the town seeking a declaratory
judgment concerning the application of
. § 19a-
308a to the African American cemetery and to quiet title
to the driveway or to acquire title thereto by prescriptive
easement or adverse possession (‘the Greenwich
[action]’). The Greenwich [action] was later settled by
the town acquiring the cemetery and quitclaiming the
driveway back to the Stewarts. The Stewarts made a claim
to recover their litigation expenses on the Greenwich
[action] and [the defendant] again disclaimed coverage,
noting that it did not approve the expenses and attor-
ney’s fees incurred in initiating and defending the
Greenwich [action] as required under the Stewarts’ pol-
icy.’’ (Footnote omitted.) Specifically, the defendant
stated that it ‘‘was first notified of litigation concerning
11 Byram Dock Street via email from [the Stewarts’
attorney] on [March 26, 2019]. . . . The pleadings . . .
provided that the [c]emetery access issue had been
litigated by [the Stewarts] filing a [c]omplaint against
the town on [October 2, 2017], and resolving the litiga-
tion via [o]rder dated August 9, 2018. . . . [I]t is indis-
putable that [the defendant] was not made aware of
the litigation until [March 26, 2019], at the earliest. . . .
Condition 9c [of the Stewart policy] unambiguously
provides that [the defendant] is only required to repay
those attorneys’ fees and expenses that [it] approve[s]
in advance. [The defendant] did not approve these fees
as [it was] never made aware of the litigation until
nearly a year after it was resolved and roughly [seven-
teen] months after it was initiated.’’

On January 3, 2020, the plaintiffs instituted the under-
lying action against the defendant, alleging that the
defendant breached the company policy and the Stew-
art policy because it (1) ‘‘failed to provide any funds
for the costs of defense of the [Kennedy action]’’ and
(2) ‘‘failed to provide any funds for the costs of defense
of [the Greenwich action].’’ In count one, the plaintiffs
claimed that when the Kennedys revised their complaint
to raise an issue as to the ‘‘ownership’’ of the private
portion of Byram Dock Street subject to the alleged
easement, that raised a title issue within the coverage
of the company policy that triggered the defendant’s
duty to defend. In count two, the plaintiffs claimed that,
in the Greenwich action, the town made claims that
implicated the Stewarts’ title to the property and
thereby triggered the defendant’s duty to defend under
the Stewart policy. The plaintiffs sought indemnifica-
tion for costs and attorney’s fees in the amount of
$205,843.97 in connection with the Kennedy action and

$205,845.38 in connection with the Greenwich action.

The defendant filed an answer and alleged several
special defenses, including, inter alia, as to count one,
that the Kennedy action constituted a cause of action
that alleged matters not insured under the company
policy. As to count two, the defendant alleged that (1)
the plaintiffs’ claims were barred by exclusions in the
Stewart policy precluding coverage for governmental
action taking place after the issuance of the policy,
governmental police power, and/or condemnation, and
(2) the Stewarts failed to provide it with notice about
their commencement of the Greenwich action until
almost one full year after the Stewarts had settled it.
The defendant then moved for summary judgment on
both counts.

The court, Hon. Edward T. Krumeich II, judge trial
referee, rendered summary judgment in favor of the
defendant. As to count one, the court found that the
Kennedy action did not challenge the company’s title
to the private portion of Byram Dock Street but, rather,
its right to exclusive use of the easement. Consequently,
the court concluded that, ‘‘[o]n its face, the complaint
in the Kennedy [action] did not concern matters on
which [the defendant] had a duty to defend under the
[company policy].’’ The court further concluded that
‘‘the gravamen of the Kennedy [action] was the affirma-
tive conduct of the [company] that occurred after the
policy was issued and therefore was excluded from
coverage under the policy.’’ For these two reasons, the
court concluded that the defendant ‘‘has borne its bur-
den to prove there is no genuine issue of fact to be
tried and it is entitled to summary judgment that [it]
did not breach its duty to defend the Kennedy [action].’’

With respect to the Greenwich action, the trial court
found that (1) because the Stewarts brought the action
themselves, they could not be said to have incurred
costs in defending title to the property, (2) the possible
presence of the cemetery was a condition of the prop-
erty, not a matter of title, (3) the town would have to
acquire the property by eminent domain, a governmen-
tal police power, which would subject the claim to
exclusions from coverage for postissuance events and
governmental takings, and (4) the Stewarts breached
the policy by depriving the defendant of its right to
control the defense by failing to provide timely notice
of the action. The court, accordingly, found that the
defendant met its burden to prove that there were no
genuine issues of material fact and that it was entitled
to summary judgment because the defendant did not
breach its duty to defend the Stewarts in the Greenwich
action. This appeal followed.

Our standard of review as to a trial court’s decision
to grant a motion for summary judgment is well settled.
‘‘Practice Book § 17-49 provides that summary judg-
ment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affida-

.

.

.

vits and any other proof submitted show that there is
no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial
court must view the evidence in the light most favorable

summary judgment has the burden of showing the
absence of any genuine issue of material fact .
.
[T]he party moving for summary judgment is held to a
strict standard. [The moving party] must make a show-
ing that it is quite clear what the truth is, and that
excludes any real doubt as to the existence of any
genuine issue of material fact.
. A material fact is
a fact that will make a difference in the result of the
case.
. Because the court’s decision on a motion
for summary judgment is a legal determination, our
review on appeal is plenary. . . . [W]e must [therefore]
decide whether [the trial court’s] conclusions are legally
and logically correct and find support in the facts that
appear in the record.’’ (Citation omitted; internal quota-
tion marks omitted.) 10 Marietta Street, LLC v. Melnick
Properties, LLC, 216 Conn. App. 262, 270–71, 285 A.3d
82 (2022).

.

.

On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the court improp-
erly determined that the defendant had no duty to
defend (1) the company in the Kennedy action pursuant
to the company policy and (2) the Stewarts in the Green-
wich action pursuant to the Stewart policy. We con-
clude, on the basis of the submissions presented to
the court in connection with the motion for summary
judgment, that there is no genuine issue of material fact
that the claims for which the plaintiffs sought coverage
were not covered under the pertinent title insurance
policies. We therefore hold that the defendant had no
duty to defend or indemnify the plaintiffs in connection
with the Kennedy and Greenwich actions.5

To prevail on a motion for summary judgment on a
claim for breach of the duty to defend, an ‘‘insurer must
establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact
either that no allegation of the underlying complaint
falls even possibly within the scope of the insuring
agreement or, even if it might, that any claim based on
such an allegation is excluded from coverage under an
applicable policy exclusion. In presenting countervail-
ing proof, the insurer, no less than the insured, is neces-
sarily limited to the provisions of the subject insurance
policy and the allegations of the underlying complaint.
Therefore, it is only entitled to prevail under a policy
exclusion if the allegations of the complaint clearly
and unambiguously establish the applicability of the
exclusion to each and every claim for which there might
otherwise be coverage under the policy.

‘‘An insured, in turn, may rebut an insurer’s claim

that it has no duty to defend him in the light of an
applicable policy exclusion by showing that at least one
of his allegations, as pleaded states a claim that falls
even possibly outside the scope of the exclusion or
within an exception to that exclusion. Unless the allega-
tions of any such underlying claim fall so clearly and
unambiguously within a policy exclusion as to eliminate
any possible coverage, the insurer must provide a
defense to its insured.’’ Lancia v. State National Ins.
Co., supra, 134 Conn. App. 691.6 We now address each
of the plaintiffs’ claims in turn.

I

The plaintiffs first claim that the court improperly
determined that the defendant had no duty to defend
the company in the Kennedy action. In particular, the
plaintiffs claim that the court erred in interpreting the
Kennedys’ May, 2017 complaint as not challenging the
company’s ownership of the private portion of Byram
Dock Street. On the basis of our review of the policy
language and the Kennedys’ complaint, we disagree.

notion that pleadings should be read in a hypertechnical
manner. Rather, [t]he modern trend, which is followed
in Connecticut, is to construe pleadings broadly and
realistically, rather than narrowly and technically.
. . . [T]he complaint must be read in its entirety in such
a way as to give effect to the pleading with reference
to the general theory [on] which it proceeded, and do
substantial justice between the parties. . . . Our read-
ing of pleadings in a manner that advances substantial
justice means that a pleading must be construed reason-
ably, to contain all that it fairly means, but carries with
it the related proposition that it must not be contorted
in such a way so as to strain the bounds of rational
comprehension.’’ (Emphasis in original; internal quota-
tion marks omitted.) Carpenter v. Daar, 346 Conn. 80,
128, 287 A.3d 1027 (2023).

We begin with the relevant language in the operative
Kennedy complaint—the May, 2017 revised complaint
on which the company relies for its claim of coverage:7

.

.

‘‘1.

. Robert M. Kennedy, James R. Kennedy,
Peter J. Kennedy, and Barbara M. Kennedy .
. own
real property located at 14 Byram Dock Street, Green-
wich, CT 06830 (‘14 Byram Dock Street’).

.

‘‘2. [The company] is a Connecticut limited liability
company with its principal place of business located
at 11 Byram Dock Street, Greenwich, Connecticut (‘11
Byram Dock Street’). [The company], whose sole man-
aging member is Jeffrey M. Stewart (‘Stewart’), is the
owner of the real property located at 9 Byram Dock
(‘9 Byram Dock
Street, Greenwich, Connecticut

Street’). . . .

‘‘4. [The Kennedys] have a right of way appurtenant
to their land, to pass and repass over the land owned
by and in the possession of the owners of a parcel of
land known as Shore Island (the ‘easement’).

‘‘5. The easement grants the rights to pass and repass
motor vehicles over Byram Dock Street to access the
various homes along said street.

‘‘6. The easement is recorded on the Greenwich, Con-

necticut land records. . . .

‘‘7. Starting in 2016, [the company], without cause or
other proper justification, and despite actual notice of
the easement, intentionally, wilfully, and wrongfully
obstructed, and continues to obstruct, the easement in
a manner that prevents [the Kennedys] from enjoying
and using it. Specifically, among other things, [the com-
pany] extended the front lawn of 9 Byram Dock Street
by planting grass and other landscaping over a portion
of the easement, which is the private portion of the
road known as ‘Byram Dock Street,’ and also installed
a raised drainage system on a portion of the easement
(collectively, the ‘landscaping’). In addition, [the com-
pany] removed a stone pillar that was located on the
easement—which, for decades, has served to demar-
cate the entrance to the private portion of Byram Dock
Street, and to provide a measure of privacy and security
to homeowners with residences on the private portion
of that street, including [the Kennedys] and their prede-
cessors—and moved it and an adjoining stone wall to
a location that does not separate the public and private
portions of the street. [The company] took such unilat-
eral action notwithstanding the fact that the [company]
does not have exclusive ownership or easement rights
to the real property where the stone pillar was pre-
viously situated, and took such action without the con-
sent or approval of [the Kennedys].

‘‘8. As a result of the foregoing, [the Kennedys] are
directly and substantially damaged with regard to their
use and enjoyment of the easement on the [private
portion of] Byram Dock Street. Specifically, the land-
scaping has narrowed the easement in such a way as
to substantially restrict the ability of [the Kennedys]
and/or fire or safety vehicles to access the easement,
and the passage of two-way traffic on the easement.
Further, [the company], by removing and relocating
the pillar and adjoining stone wall, has removed the
demarcation between the public and private portions
of Byram Dock Street, thereby interfering with the
safety and security of [the Kennedys] and their property.
Both the landscaping and the relocation of the stone
pillar and adjoining stone wall have adversely affected
the value of 14 Byram Dock Street. . . .

‘‘9. As a result of the foregoing, [the Kennedys] seek
a declaratory judgment finding: (i) the existence of the

easement over the [private portion of] Byram Dock
Street; and (ii) the acts of
[the company] have
obstructed the easement preventing [the Kennedys]
from fully exercising their rights thereto. . . .’’

The plaintiffs characterize the complaint as alleging
that the company did not have exclusive ownership of
the private portion of Byram Dock Street, and thus
challenged the company’s title to that property. In par-
ticular, they argue that the allegation in paragraph 7
‘‘that the [company] does not have exclusive ownership
or easement rights to the real property where the stone
pillar was previously situated’’ called into question its
ownership of a portion of 9 Byram Dock Street.8 The
plaintiffs accordingly claim that the Kennedy action
falls within the coverage of the company policy, which
provides insurance against a loss ‘‘by reason of .
.
[t]itle being vested other than as stated in Schedule A
[to the company policy].’’ In particular, they contend
that ‘‘Schedule A [to the company policy] identified
deeds in the chain of title that defined the real property
it was insuring; those deeds identify the property at
issue [in the Kennedy action] as part of the property
set out in Schedule A. [The defendant] had a duty to
defend against the allegation that the [company] did
not have title to property that was within the metes
and bounds of 9 Byram Dock [Street] as delineated in
the policy in [Schedule A].’’ We are not persuaded.

.

Construing the complaint broadly and realistically, it
is clear that the complaint alleged claims contending
that the company’s actions obstructed the Kennedys’
use and enjoyment of the easement rather than in any
way disputing the ownership of the private portion of
Byram Dock Street. For example, paragraph seven of
the complaint specifically alleges that the company
‘‘without cause or other proper justification .
.
obstructed, and continues to obstruct, the easement in
a manner that prevents [the Kennedys] from enjoying
and using it.’’ (Emphasis added.) Similarly, in para-
graph eight, the Kennedys allege that, as a result of the
company’s obstruction, they were ‘‘directly and sub-
stantially damaged with regard to their use and enjoy-
ment of the easement on the roadway known as Byram
Dock.’’ (Emphasis added.) Notably, they do not claim
that they or anyone else has an ownership interest in
the land underlying the easement. Aside from the refer-
ence to ownership in paragraph 7, which the plaintiffs
take out of context, ownership of the private portion
of Byram Dock Street is not discussed in the complaint.

.

In addition, the relief requested by the Kennedys
sought to guarantee their ability to exercise rights to
use the easement. In particular, the Kennedys sought
‘‘[e]ntry of a declaratory judgment that the easement
exists and [the Kennedys] have been prevented from
using the easement, or a portion thereof’’ and ‘‘[a] tem-
porary and permanent injunction against [the company]

with regard to the continuing violative conduct by it
in interfering, disturbing or obstructing in any manner
directly or indirectly, with regard to full access and use
of the easement’’ by the Kennedys. (Emphasis added.)
Thus, a plain reading of the allegations in paragraph
seven, in the context of their entire revised complaint,
leads us to conclude that the allegations are properly
understood as disputing the company’s exclusive inter-
est in the easement and asserting a claim that, due
to the company’s landscaping changes to the private
portion of Byram Dock Street, the Kennedys have been
prevented from the full use and enjoyment of their
alleged right to the easement. Accordingly, reading the
complaint in its entirety, as we must; see Grenier v.
Commissioner of Transportation, 306 Conn. 523, 536–
37, 51 A.3d 367 (2012); it is clear that the Kennedy
complaint did not dispute ownership of the private
portion of Byram Dock Street to which the easement
is attached.

Consequently, we conclude that the revised com-
plaint did not involve a challenge to the company’s
title as set forth in Schedule A of the company policy.
Accordingly, the Kennedy complaint, on its face, did
not set forth allegations which possibly fell within the
coverage of the company policy, and, therefore, the
defendant had no duty to defend the company in the
action. See Kling v. Hartford Casualty Ins. Co., supra,
211 Conn. App. 714 (‘‘an insurer has a duty to defend
only if the underlying complaint reasonably alleges an
injury that is covered by the policy’’ (emphasis in origi-
nal; internal quotation marks omitted)).

Moreover, the plaintiffs’ reliance on facts beyond the
four corners of the complaint is without merit. The
plaintiffs point our attention to certain expert witnesses
separately engaged by the company and the Kennedys
in the pendency of the Kennedy action who opined on
the fee ownership of the private portion of Byram Dock
Street. The plaintiffs accordingly claim that, because
‘‘title to real property remained an issue throughout
the Kennedy [action],’’ ‘‘[t]hese facts cannot be ignored
when determining when an allegation falls ‘even possi-
bly’ within the coverage [of the policy]. [See Lancia v.
State National Ins. Co., supra, 134 Conn. App. 691.]’’
In essence, the plaintiffs argue that, because ownership
of the land was actually litigated in the Kennedy action,
the Kennedy complaint necessarily raised the issue of
ownership over the private portion of Byram Dock
Street and therefore fell within coverage of the company
policy. We disagree.

As acknowledged by the plaintiffs’ counsel at oral
argument before this court, the determination of an
insurer’s duty to defend is ‘‘limited to the provisions
of the subject insurance policy and the allegations of
the underlying complaint.’’ (Emphasis added.) Lancia
v. State National Ins. Co., supra, 691; see also Allstate

Ins. Co. v. Jussaume, 35 F. Supp. 3d 231, 238 (D. Conn.
2014) (citing Lancia to reject insured’s attempt to look
beyond underlying complaint in duty to defend dispute).
Moreover, our Supreme Court has stated that ‘‘[t]he
obligation of the insurer to defend does not depend on
whether the injured party will successfully maintain a
cause of action against the insured but on whether he
has, in his complaint, stated facts which bring the
injury within the coverage. If the latter situation pre-
vails, the policy requires the insurer to defend, irrespec-
tive of the insured’s ultimate liability. . . . It necessar-
ily follows that the insurer’s duty to defend is measured
by the allegations of the complaint.’’ (Emphasis added;
internal quotation marks omitted.) Security Ins. Co. of
Hartford v. Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., 264
Conn. 688, 711–12, 826 A.2d 107 (2003). Therefore, we
reject the plaintiffs’ invitation to consider what actions
the parties took during the pendency of the Kennedy
action to determine whether the May, 2017 complaint
disputed the company’s ownership of the private por-
tion of Byram Dock Street and, accordingly, whether
the defendant had a duty to defend the company in
that action.

Furthermore, we conclude that, even if the Kennedy
complaint contested the company’s exclusive owner-
ship of the private portion of Byram Dock Street, the
company policy clearly and unambiguously excluded
the company’s claim from coverage. Paragraph 3 of the
‘‘Exclusions From Coverage’’ in the company policy
specifically excludes from coverage: ‘‘Defects, liens,
encumbrances, adverse claims, or other matters .
.
(a) created, suffered, assumed, or agreed to by the [com-
. [and] (d) attaching or created subsequent
pany] .
to [October 31, 2014] . . . .’’

.

.

The Kennedy complaint alleges that the action was
brought due to actions taken by the company including
extending the lawn of 9 Byram Dock Street, installing
a raised drainage system, installing Belgian block, and
installing an elevated manhole cover on the private
portion of Byram Dock Street. Accordingly, the Kenne-
dys’ adverse claims arose from the company’s own
actions and, therefore, were ‘‘created . . . by the [com-
pany].’’ Therefore, exclusion 3 (a) clearly and unambig-
uously precludes coverage for the Kennedys’ claims.
Moreover, exclusion 3 (d) excludes from coverage mat-
ters arising after October 31, 2014. Because it is undis-
puted that the company first made changes to the pri-
vate portion of Byram Dock Street after its purchase
of the property on October 31, 2014, the allegations
necessarily relate to matters arising after that date.
Thus, exclusion 3 (d) also clearly and unambiguously
precludes coverage for the Kennedys’ claims. In short,
we conclude that each of the Kennedys’ claims was
based on allegations clearly and unambiguously
excluded from coverage under the company policy.

The plaintiffs, however, urge us to ignore the clear
language of the exclusions. According to the plaintiffs,
because the Kennedy complaint disputed their exclu-
sive ownership of the private portion of Byram Dock
Street, ‘‘[a]ll of the other defenses put forth in [the
defendant’s] motion for summary judgment disappear
after a finding is made that any allegation, even possibly,
could fall within the scope of coverage; [the defendant]
pointing to claims to which it has no duty to indemnify
is immaterial to any analysis of [the defendant’s] duty
to defend.’’ This claim is without merit.

In support of this claim, the plaintiffs rely on the
following statement by our Supreme Court in Imperial
Casualty & Indemnity Co. v. State, 246 Conn. 313,
332, 714 A.2d 1230 (1998): ‘‘The fact that the complaint
alleges a claim that is excluded by the policy does not
excuse [the] insurer from defending [the] insured where
other counts of the claim fall within the provisions of
the policy.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.). See
also Capstone Building Corp. v. American Motorists
Ins. Co., 308 Conn. 760, 805 n.47, 67 A.3d 961 (2005)
(same). The plaintiffs, however, misconstrue this state-
ment. To be sure, ‘‘[a]n insurer’s duty to defend is trig-
gered if at least one allegation of the complaint ‘falls
even possibly within the coverage’ ’’ of the pertinent
policy. (Emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks
omitted.) Id., 805. Nevertheless, the statement on which
the plaintiffs rely simply stands for the proposition that
an insurer may not rely on an exclusion to disclaim its
duty to defend its insured with respect to an entire
complaint if the complaint also contains allegations that
fall outside the exclusion. Ultimately though, when an
allegation of the underlying complaint ‘‘falls even possi-
bly within the scope of the insuring agreement,’’ an
insurer is entitled to summary judgment if ‘‘any claim
based on such an allegation is excluded from coverage
under an applicable policy exclusion.’’ Lancia v. State
National Ins. Co., supra, 134 Conn. App. 691; New Lon-
don County Mutual Ins. Co. v. Bialobrodec, 137 Conn.
App. 474, 479, 48 A.3d 742 (2012) (insurer may rely on
policy exclusions to rebut charge it had duty to defend).

In the present case, the allegations within the Ken-
nedy complaint clearly and unambiguously establish
the applicability of the relevant exclusions to any claim
for which there might otherwise be coverage under the
company policy. Furthermore, as discussed previously
in this opinion, the Kennedy complaint did not dispute
the company’s ownership of the private portion of
Byram Dock Street and therefore did not allege a claim
covered by the company policy. Consequently, the
defendant had no duty to defend the company in the
Kennedy action and, thus, the defendant has no duty to
indemnify the company for losses incurred in defending
the Kennedy action. Accordingly, the court properly
granted the defendant’s motion for summary judgment

as to count one.

II

The plaintiffs next claim that the court improperly
concluded that the defendant did not have a duty to
defend the Stewarts in connection with the Greenwich
action. On the basis of our review of the policy language
and the circumstances of the Greenwich action, we
disagree.

The following additional facts are relevant to our
resolution of this claim. On or around April 12, 2016,
the commission passed a resolution recommending that
the town acquire, pursuant to § 19a-308a, the aban-
doned cemetery, which included a portion of the Stew-
arts’ northern driveway area. In May, 2016, the acquisi-
tion of the cemetery was approved by the town’s Board
of Selectmen and, thereafter, the commission submitted
a municipal improvement request to the town’s Plan-
ning and Zoning Commission which was approved in
July, 2016. The town then published notices relating to
the proposed acquisition of the abandoned cemetery,
advising the public that a hearing would be held on
September 22, 2016. At the public hearing, the Stewarts
‘‘objected to the acquisition of the [cemetery] parcel
and northern driveway area based on the absence of
any physical evidence that this area was ever used as
a cemetery . . . .’’ The Stewarts also submitted a for-
mal written objection ‘‘to the [t]own’s acquisition on
behalf of [themselves as] deeded property owners of a
portion of the cemetery parcel.’’ The Stewarts reiterated
their objection in writing on October 20, 2016, and
November 11, 2016.

On May 19, 2017, the Stewarts sent a notice of claim
letter to the defendant claiming that the Stewarts’ ‘‘own-
ership of the driveway easement has recently been
called into question by the [town]. It is expected that
the [town] will, at some point in the near future, formally
challenge the validity of the [d]riveway [e]asement.’’ In
its response on June 29, 2017, the defendant denied
coverage of the claim, noting that, although the commis-
sion had made a proposal to the town recommending
the town acquire the abandoned cemetery subject to
§ 19a-308a, the town had not yet made a ruling or deter-
mination.

On October 2, 2017, without notifying the defendant,
the Stewarts commenced an action against the town
pursuant to General Statutes § 47-31, seeking a declara-
tory judgment as to the application of § 19a-308a to the
abandoned cemetery believed to be on or adjacent to
11 Byram Dock Street and to quiet title to the Stewarts’
driveway which crossed over a portion of the cemetery
or to acquire title thereto by prescriptive easement or
adverse possession. Therein, the Stewarts alleged that:

‘‘22. In or around April, 2016, [the town] formally
commenced the process of acquiring the Lyon Cemetery

and Byram Cemetery, including the [African American
Cemetery parcel (AAC parcel)] and [the Stewarts’]
. § 19a-308a,
northern driveway area, pursuant to .
which grants municipalities the authority to acquire
‘abandoned cemeteries’ and further provides the pro-
cess for such acquisitions.

.

‘‘23. [Section] 19a-308a does not define ‘cemetery.’

. . .

.
‘‘26. Starting in late 2014, the [town], through .
the town’s [commission], made it known that the town
would seek to acquire the Lyon Cemetery, Byram Ceme-
tery, and the Byram African American Cemetery—
including the northern driveway area—pursuant to
. . . § 19a-308a.

.

‘‘27. On or around April 12, 2016, the [commission]
passed a resolution recommending that
the town
acquire the Lyon Cemetery, the Byram Cemetery and
the subset Byram African American Cemetery parcel,
which includes the northern driveway area.

‘‘28. On or around May 12, 2016, the acquisition of the
cemetery parcels was approved by the [town’s] Board
of Selectmen.

‘‘29. On or around May 16, 2016, the [commission]
submitted a Municipal Improvement Request to the
[town’s] Planning and Zoning Commission (hereinafter
‘P&Z’), with said application being assigned File No.
PLPZ-2016-00281.

‘‘30. On or around July 6, 2016, P&Z approved the

Municipal Improvement Request. . . .

‘‘33. A public hearing was held on September 22,
2016, wherein [the commission] and members of the
community spoke in favor of the town’s proposed acqui-
sition of the Lyon Cemetery, the Byram Cemetery, and
the subset AAC parcel and northern driveway area.
. . .

‘‘45. Upon information and belief, the acquisition has
not yet been heard [or acted upon] by the [town’s Repre-
sentative Town Meeting] pursuant to [article 9, § 100,
of the Greenwich Town Charter]. . . .

‘‘46. [The town] intends to acquire the AAC parcel
and [the Stewarts’] northern driveway area pursuant to
. . . § 19a-308a.

‘‘47. [The town’s] proposed acquisition of the AAC
parcel and northern driveway area is not supported by
sufficient evidence to conclude that the parcels consti-
tute a ‘‘cemetery’’ such that the town has the authority
to acquire them as an ‘‘abandoned cemetery’’ pursuant
to . . . § 19a-308a.

‘‘48. If the acquisition proceeds, [the Stewarts] are in
danger of losing certain property rights, including but
not limited to, deeded ownership of the northern drive-
way area, use of a driveway extending north from their

property, which sits on the northern driveway area . . .
diminution of the value of [the Stewarts’] property, and
impaired marketability of title to [the Stewarts’] prop-
erty, which is located immediately adjacent to the AAC
parcel. . . .

‘‘56. Accordingly, [the Stewarts] seek the following

relief:

‘‘1. Declaratory judgment as to whether the AAC par-

cel constitutes a ‘cemetery’;

‘‘2. Declaratory judgment as to whether the northern

driveway area constitutes a ‘cemetery’;

‘‘3. Declaratory judgment as to whether the AAC par-
cel or the northern driveway area can be acquired by
the town . . . pursuant to . . . § 19a-308a;

‘‘4. If it is declared that the AAC parcel is not a ‘ceme-
tery’ subject to acquisition by [the town] pursuant to
.
. § 19a-308a, declaratory judgment as to the true
owner of the AAC parcel, and the rights and responsibil-
ities of that party or parties;

.

‘‘5. Declaratory judgment as to the boundaries and

location of the AAC parcel;

‘‘6. Declaratory judgment whether [the Stewarts] are
the owners of the northern driveway area as conveyed
in their warranty deed;

‘‘7. If it is determined that [the Stewarts] are not
the owners of the northern driveway area, declaratory
judgment as to who owns the northern driveway area
and whether [they] have a right of way over the northern
driveway area;

‘‘8. If [the Stewarts] have such right of way, the extent
of permissible use over the northern driveway area,
including whether and to what extent [they] may main-
tain a driveway; and

‘‘9. If it is determined that [the Stewarts] hold actual
title to the northern driveway area or alternatively have
a right of way over the parcel, declaratory judgment
fixing and determining the location of the northern
driveway area. . . .

‘‘59. [The town] intends to acquire the AAC parcel and
the northern driveway area pursuant to the statutory
authority granted to municipalities by . . . § 19a-308a.

‘‘60. By virtue of this proposed acquisition, [the town]
claims an interest in the northern driveway area which
is adverse to the title of [the Stewarts].’’

The Greenwich action was resolved by a stipulated
judgment dated August 9, 2018, in which the town
acquired the abandoned cemetery and quitclaimed the
driveway back to the Stewarts. The defendant was
never notified of any discussions between the Stewarts
and the town before the stipulated judgment was
rendered.

On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the Greenwich
action fell within the coverage of the Stewart policy
because ‘‘[t]he [town] was trying to take title to real
property owned by the Stewarts’’ and, accordingly, the
defendant had a duty to defend that challenge to the
Stewarts’ title.9 The plaintiffs further claim that policy
exclusions within the Stewart policy do not apply
because (1) the town’s acquisition of an abandoned
cemetery pursuant to § 19a-308a is not an exercise of
eminent domain and, even so, speculation that the town
would take the property pursuant to § 19a-308a did not
relieve the defendant of its duty to defend as it could
result in the Stewarts losing title to a portion of their
property, and (2) the Greenwich action concerned title
to, not the condition of, the Stewarts’ property.

The defendant argues that certain policy exclusions
within the Stewart policy are plain and unambiguous
as applied to the allegations within the Stewarts’ com-
plaint. Specifically, it argues that (1) the central issue
of the complaint, as alleged, arose out of the town’s
possible use of its governmental police power and emi-
nent domain to acquire a portion of the Stewarts’ land
via § 19a-308a, which is excluded from coverage, and
(2) the town’s purported planned acquisition of the
cemetery would be conduct occurring after August 6,
2013, which is excluded from coverage. Consequently,
the defendant argues that the claim is clearly excluded
from coverage and that the defendant owed no duty to
defend the Stewarts in the Greenwich action. We agree
with the defendant.

The Stewart policy insures against ‘‘actual loss from
any risk described under [c]overed [r]isks if the event
creating the risk exists on [August 6, 2013], or, to the
extent expressly stated in [c]overed [r]isks, after
[August 6, 2013].’’ The covered risks include: ‘‘Someone
.
else owns an interest in [the Stewarts’] [t]itle.
Someone else has a right to limit [the Stewarts’] use of
the [l]and. . . . [Or, the Stewarts’] [t]itle is defective.’’
The Stewart policy expressly excludes from coverage
the ‘‘loss, costs, attorneys’ fees, and expenses resulting
from: 1. [g]overnmental police power, and the existence
or violation of those portions of any law or government
regulation concerning: a. building; b. zoning; c. land
use; d. improvements on the [l]and; e. land division;
and f. environmental protection,’’ ‘‘3. [t]he right to take
the [l]and by condemning it,’’ and ‘‘4. [r]isks .
. d.
that first occur after [August 6, 2013] . . . .’’

.

.

.

We first note that § 19a-308a allows a municipality
to ‘‘acquire an abandoned cemetery, including owner-
ship of any occupied or unoccupied lots or grave sites
in such cemetery.’’ General Statutes § 19a-308a (b). The
Stewarts’ complaint clearly alleges that they brought
the action against the town with the purpose of having
a court decide whether the parcel at issue contained a
‘‘cemetery’’ such that the town could acquire it via § 19a-

308a (b). We conclude that whether an abandoned cem-
etery is situated on a piece of property has nothing to
do with the current title to that property. Put simply,
the determination of whether a property contains an
‘‘abandoned cemetery’’ does not impact who at that
point in time owns title to the property containing the
abandoned cemetery. The determination that an aban-
doned cemetery is present simply triggers a municipali-
ty’s right to acquire title to the property in the future
via § 19a-308a. Accordingly, the Stewarts’ complaint
concerned a potential physical condition of the Stew-
arts’ property that could result in the town having
authority to acquire said property under § 19a-308a.
Thus, we agree with the court’s determination that the
presence of a cemetery on the property is a condition
of the property, not a matter of title.

Moreover, the Stewarts’ complaint focused squarely
on the town’s potential acquisition of a portion of 11
Byram Dock Street via § 19a-308a. Despite the plaintiffs’
contention to the contrary, a town’s acquisition of prop-
erty pursuant to § 19a-308a is both an exercise of gov-
ernmental police power and would constitute an acqui-
sition by condemnation. First, although the town had
not yet acted on the commission’s recommendation to
acquire the abandoned cemetery, such an act would
have been pursuant to the public health and well-being
of the town by ‘‘protecting and commemorating’’ the
cemetery. See, e.g., Smith v. Pulaski County, 269 Ga.
688, 688, 501 S.E.2d 213 (1998) (Georgia Abandoned
Cemeteries Act authorized counties to preserve and
protect abandoned cemeteries pursuant to their govern-
mental police powers); Wunderlin v. Lutheran Ceme-
tery, 49 Misc. 2d 836, 837, 268 N.Y.S.2d 514 (1966)
(police power promotes public welfare to ‘‘prevent cem-
eteries from falling into disrepair and dilapidation and
thereby becoming a burden on the entire community’’),
modified, 27 App. Div. 2d 861, 278 N.Y.S.2d 544 (1967);
Powell Grove Cemetery Assn. v. Multnomah, 228 Or.
597, 600, 365 P.2d 1058 (1961) (legislature has power,
in promotion of public health, safety, and welfare, to
cause abandonment of cemetery and removal of bodies
therein); see also Fairlawns Cemetery Assn. v. Zoning
Commission, 138 Conn. 434, 441, 86 A.2d 74 (1952) (‘‘it
is generally held that the public welfare reasonably
demands the regulation and, at times, even the prohibi-
tion of cemeteries’’).

Second, if the town had acquired a portion of 11
Byram Dock Street pursuant to § 19a-308a, it would
have done so by using the power of eminent domain.
‘‘Eminent domain refers to a legal proceeding in which a
government asserts its authority to condemn property.’’
(Internal quotation marks omitted.) Bauer v. Waste
Management of Connecticut, Inc., 234 Conn. 221, 249
n.15, 662 A.2d 1179 (1995). Furthermore, property
acquired through eminent domain is typically referred
to as the condemned property. See, e.g., Hall v. Weston,

167 Conn. 49, 63, 355 A.2d 79 (1974). Similarly, Black’s
Law Dictionary defines ‘‘condemnation’’ as ‘‘[t]he deter-
mination and declaration that certain property (esp.
land) is assigned to public use, subject to reasonable
compensation; the exercise of eminent domain by a
government entity.’’ Black’s Law Dictionary (11th Ed.
2019) p. 364. Thus, if the town acquired any part of 11
Byram Dock Street pursuant to § 19a-308a it would be
taking the land through condemnation. Such takings are
expressly excluded from coverage under the Stewart
policy. Consequently, we conclude that the Stewart pol-
icy exclusions pertaining to government police power
and the condemning of property are clear and unambig-
uous as applied to the Stewarts’ claims. Accordingly,
those exclusions unambiguously establish that the
defendant did not have a duty to defend the Stewarts
in the Greenwich action.

In addition, as correctly stated by the defendant in its
response to the Stewarts’ notice of claim letter, ‘‘[a]ny
action taken by the town and [the commission] with
respect to the property would certainly occur after the
date of [the Stewart] [p]olicy and would [be] excluded
from coverage by [e]xclusion 4 d.’’ Thus, we conclude
that exclusion 4. d. was plain and unambiguous as
applied to the claims within the Stewarts’ complaint.
Because the applicability of the exclusions to the allega-
tions within the complaint were unambiguous, the
defendant had no duty to defend the Stewarts in the
Greenwich action.10

For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the court
properly granted the defendant’s motion for summary
judgment as to count two.

The judgment is affirmed.

In this opinion the other judges concurred.
1 Jeffrey Stewart is the sole member of 9 Byram Dock, LLC.
2 The defendant’s letter declining coverage also relied on certain exclu-
sions to coverage set forth in Schedule B to the company policy, which
provides in relevant part that it ‘‘does not insure against loss or damage,
and [the defendant] will not pay costs, attorneys’ fees, or expenses that
arise by reason of . . . .

‘‘12. [The] Agreement dated January 24, 1963 and recorded in Volume 681

at Page 450 of the Greenwich Land Records.

‘‘13. Terms and conditions as set forth in a deed dated January 25, 1963 and
recorded in Volume 681 at Page 445 of the Greenwich Land Records. . . .

‘‘16. Rights of others in and to Gaertner’s Island, so-called.’’
As the defendant noted in its declination of coverage, the property at
issue in the Kennedy action, the private portion of Byram Dock Street, was
included in the January 25, 1963 deed. Further, the complaint in the Kennedy
action specifically alleged that it was brought pursuant to the Kennedys’
alleged rights in Shore Island, otherwise known as Gaertner’s Island. Thus,
the defendant asserted that ‘‘the [exclusions] from [c]overage in Schedule
B . . . clearly apply to remove coverage for this claim.’’ Because the defend-
ant did not rely on the exclusions when it moved for summary judgment
as to the company’s claims, the court did not address the exclusions, and
the defendant has not relied on them as an alternative ground for affirmance,
we do not discuss their applicability.

3 The defendant did not receive notice of, or information pertaining to,

the amended complaint until discovery for the present action began.

4 General Statutes § 19a-308a provides in relevant part: ‘‘(a) As used in
this section, ‘abandoned cemetery’ means a cemetery (1) in which no burial

has occurred during the previous forty years and in which the lots or graves
have not been maintained during the previous ten years except for mainte-
nance rendered by the municipality in which such cemetery is located, (2)
in which one burial has occurred in the past forty years, for which a permit
was issued under section 7-65 after such burial, or (3) in which no lots have
been sold in the previous forty years and in which most lots and graves have
not been maintained during the previous ten years except for maintenance
rendered by the municipality in which such cemetery is located.

‘‘(b) Any municipality may acquire an abandoned cemetery, including
ownership of any occupied or unoccupied lots or grave sites in such ceme-
tery. . . .’’

5 The defendant also raises two alternative grounds for affirmance in
which it claims that it is ‘‘unclear on whose behalf [each count of the
plaintiffs’ complaint] is asserted. Given that count one does not specify
otherwise, it is conceivable that the [company] and/or the Stewarts assert
it. If the Stewarts assert it, [the defendant] is entitled to summary judgment
against them because they lack standing to assert a claim for an alleged
injury to the [company].’’ Similarly, the defendant claims that, ‘‘[g]iven that
count two does not specify otherwise, it is conceivable that the [company]
and/or the Stewarts assert it. If the [company] asserts it, [the defendant] is
entitled to summary judgment against it because it lacks standing to assert
a claim for an alleged injury to the Stewarts.’’ Because standing implicates
the court’s subject matter jurisdiction, we address the defendant’s arguments
briefly. It is clear to us that the parties and the court treated the company
as the only plaintiff in count one and the Stewarts as the only plaintiffs in
count two. In particular, the trial court rendered judgment for the defendant
and against the company on count one and for the defendant and against
the Stewarts on count two.

Moreover, construing the complaint to allege that the company and the
Stewarts were asserting claims in both counts would be unreasonable. ‘‘[W]e
long have eschewed the notion that pleadings should be read in a hypertech-
nical manner. Rather, [t]he modern trend, which is followed in Connecticut,
is to construe pleadings broadly and realistically, rather than narrowly and
technically. . . . [T]he complaint must be read in its entirety in such a way
as to give effect to the pleading with reference to the general theory upon
which it proceeded, and do substantial justice between the parties.
.
Our reading of pleadings in a manner that advances substantial justice means
that a pleading must be construed reasonably, to contain all that it fairly
means, but carries with it the related proposition that it must not be contorted
in such a way so as to strain the bounds of rational comprehension.’’ (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) Grenier v. Commissioner of Transportation, 306
Conn. 523, 536, 51 A.3d 367 (2012).

.

.

The operative revised complaint, filed on March 12, 2020, did identify
both the company and the Stewarts as plaintiffs. Nevertheless, count one
contains explicit language that refers to the company as the plaintiff seeking
indemnification under the company policy. Count two contains similar lan-
guage referring to the Stewarts as asserting that count in connection with
the Stewart policy. Given that each count addresses a different policy with
different insureds, to read either count as being asserted by a plaintiff other
than the insured would ‘‘strain the bounds of rational comprehension.’’ Id.
Accordingly, we conclude that there is no standing issue that needs to
be resolved.

6 We note that the defendant argues that we should apply the clearly
erroneous standard of review to the court’s determination on summary
judgment that neither of the plaintiffs’ claims was covered by the policies.
This is incorrect. The comparison of the allegations of the complaint to the
policy, at the summary judgment stage, to determine if there is a reasonable
possibility of coverage involves no fact-finding whatsoever. It is a pure
question of law to which we apply plenary review.

7 Despite the fact that the Kennedys amended their complaint in October,
2017, throughout their appellate briefs, the plaintiffs refer to and rely on
the Kennedys’ May 22, 2017 revised complaint because that complaint is
the one that the company relied on in its June, 2017 notice of claim letter
to the defendant. In addition, the defendant referenced the May, 2017 com-
plaint in its declination of coverage letter. Accordingly, our discussion cen-
ters on allegations made within that document. Nevertheless, the two com-
plaints are largely the same and our analysis of the October, 2017 amended
complaint would not differ from our analysis of the May, 2017 revised com-
plaint.

8 In their principal appellate brief, the plaintiffs also refer to paragraph 4

of the May, 2017 complaint, which alleges: ‘‘[The Kennedys] have a right of
way appurtenant to their land, to pass and repass over the land owned by
and in the possession of the owners of a parcel of land known as Shore
Island (the ‘easement’).’’ They fail to explain how this allegation in anyway
implicates the company’s ownership of the private portion of Byram Dock
Street. In the absence of any cogent argument by the plaintiffs to the contrary,
we conclude that this language is immaterial to our analysis.

9 We observe that this case comes to us in the unusual posture of the
insured instituting an action that it claims its insurer had a ‘‘duty to defend.’’
Our well established precedent indicates that, when determining an insurer’s
duty to defend, we must look to the allegations within the complaint made
by a third party against the insured. See Lift-Up, Inc. v. Colony Ins. Co.,
206 Conn. App. 855, 863, 867, 251 A.3d 825 (2021) (‘‘an insurer’s duty to
defend, being much broader in scope and application than its duty to indem-
nify, is determined by reference to the allegations contained in the [underly-
ing] complaint,’’ and, further, ‘‘[t]he obligation of the insurer to defend does
not depend on whether the injured party will successfully maintain a
cause of action against the insured but on whether he has, in his complaint,
stated facts which bring the injury within the coverage’’ (emphasis added;
internal quotation marks omitted)).

In the present case, there was no complaint made by a third party against
the Stewarts. Rather, the Stewarts were the complaining party in the Green-
wich action. Nevertheless, because we conclude that policy exclusions
within the Stewart policy are plain and unambiguous as applied to the
allegations within the Stewarts’ complaint, we need not address this issue.
10 The defendant also claims that the Stewarts materially breached the
Stewart policy by failing to ‘‘provide timely notice of commencement and
later settlement of the Greenwich [action]’’ thus depriving it ‘‘of its contrac-
tual right to control the defense, including its right to authorize defense costs,
and to select counsel.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Accordingly, the
defendant argues that, ‘‘even if [it] had a duty to defend the Stewarts . . .
the aforementioned material breaches discharged it.’’

‘‘Connecticut requires two conditions to be satisfied before an insurer’s
duties can be discharged pursuant to the ‘notice’ provision of a policy: (1)
an unexcused, unreasonable delay in notification by the insured; and (2)
resulting material prejudice to the insurer.’’ (Internal quotation marks omit-
ted.) Arrowood Indemnity Co. v. King, 304 Conn. 179, 198, 39 A.3d 712
(2012); id., 199 (duty to notify arises when ‘‘facts develop which would
suggest to a person of ordinary and reasonable prudence that liability may
have been incurred’’ (internal quotation marks omitted)). ‘‘[T]he insurer
bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of evidence, that it has
been prejudiced by the insured’s failure to comply with a notice provision.’’
Id., 201.

In the present case, the trial court found that ‘‘the Stewarts breached the
[Stewart] policy by depriving [the defendant] of its contractual right to
control the defense, including its right to authorize defense costs, and to
select counsel, by the Stewarts’ failure to provide timely notice of commence-
ment and later settlement of the Greenwich [action].’’ Significantly, the court
did not state whether the Stewarts’ delay in providing the defendant with
notice of the Greenwich action was unexcused or unreasonable or whether
the delay resulted in material prejudice to the defendant. Consequently, we
do not rely on the Stewarts’ failure to provide notice of the Greenwich
action in affirming the court’s judgment.
