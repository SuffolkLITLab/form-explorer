Legal Effects of a Termination of Parental Rights Decree 

 CONFIDENTIAL 

Termination of parental rights means “the complete severance by court order of the legal relationship, with all of its rights 
and responsibilities between the child and his parent or parents so that the child is free for adoption except it shall not 
affect the right of inheritance of the child or the religious affiliation of the child.” C.G.S. section 45a-707(8). (Inheritance 
rights cease upon adoption.) No action taken with respect to the termination of parental rights of one parent affects the 
parental rights of the other parent. 

Upon a decree of termination of parental rights, the parent will NO LONGER have the following rights and responsibilities 
with respect to the minor child who is the subject of the decree: 

•

•
•
•

•

The legal right to custody, guardianship or control of the minor child. The parent will have no legal right to
care for the minor child or to make any decisions on behalf of the minor child.
The legal right to the minor child's birth certificate.
The legal right to any state and federal benefits the parent may have been receiving for the minor child.
The legal responsibility to support the minor child and to pay for the minor child's maintenance, medical and
other expenses, but the parent MAY be responsible for support of the minor child until the effective date of the
termination.
The legal responsibility to care for the minor child or make any decisions on his or her behalf.

Furthermore, upon a decree of termination, the minor child will be legally free for adoption, and the parent will have no 
right to notice of the adoption proceedings nor any right to participate in the proceedings.
