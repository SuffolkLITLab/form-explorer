      <pre>Hiring a Lawyer for  
Part of Your Legal Matter 
(“Limited Scope  
Representation”)

What is limited scope representation 
and how can it help me?

Limited scope representation means 

that you and an attorney agree in 
writing that the attorney will do some 

of the work on your court case or other 

legal matter, and you will do the rest. 

You pay the attorney only for the part 

you have agreed that the attorney  

will handle, so you can get legal help 

and keep your costs down. 

What are examples of limited scope  
representation?

Some examples of what you and an attorney might 
agree to are:  

•   The attorney will fill out certain paperwork to be 

filed with the court. 

•   The attorney will advise you on how to prepare 
documents yourself, or review documents you 
have prepared.

•   The attorney will advise you on how to represent 

yourself in court.

•   The attorney will file a “limited appearance” to 

represent you at a court event or proceeding in a 
civil, foreclosure, housing, small claims, family or 
family support magistrate case.

It is important to discuss the choices with the 
attorney to determine the best choice for  
your situation. 

What is a “limited appearance”?

You and the attorney may agree that the attorney 
will file what is known as a “limited appearance” 
to represent you in court for a specific event or 
proceeding in a civil, foreclosure, housing, small claims, 
family or family support magistrate case.

It is important to understand that if you are going to 
have an attorney represent you in court for a specific 
event or proceeding, you must also file your own 
Appearance, form JD-CL-12, with the court if you have 
not already filed that form. 

Only an attorney can file a Limited Appearance form 
JD-CL-121. Self-represented parties must use the 
general Appearance form JD-CL-12.

What if I need more services from the attorney 
at a later date?

You may need help with new or unexpected legal 
issues at any time. You may also find that you need or 
want more help than you thought with your case or 
with another legal issue. If these things happen, you 
and the attorney can enter into a new agreement for 
the additional services. 

What if I decide I want the attorney to handle 
my whole case?

After going to court on your own, even with good 
advice from an attorney, you may decide that you 
would rather have the attorney represent you for 
the whole case. Even if you have agreed that the 
attorney would only represent you for a specific event 
or proceeding, you may agree at any time that the 
attorney will handle the whole case. That is between 
you and the attorney to decide.

How will I know when the attorney is no 
longer representing me?

How do I find an attorney who will provide 
me with limited scope representation?

You and the attorney should be very clear in a 
written agreement about when the attorney’s 
representation of you will end. Make sure that you 
understand the scope of the representation so that 
there are no questions about when it ends. 

If your agreement with the attorney is that the 
attorney will represent you at one or more court 
event(s) or proceeding(s), the court will consider 
the attorney’s limited appearance withdrawn and 
the representation over when the attorney has 
filed a Certificate of Completion, form JD-CL-122, 
with the court. The Certificate of Completion states 
that the attorney has completed his or her limited 
representation of you for the events or proceedings 
defined on the Limited Appearance. You will not be 
able to object to the Certificate of Completion.

Word of mouth is often a helpful way to find an 
attorney. Talk to your friends or relatives about  
a lawyer they may have used and who they  
can recommend.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
