To the Governor, General Assembly  

and the Citizens of Connecticut,

I have enjoyed my role as Chief Court Administrator since February 2006 and am pleased to present this 2004-2006 

biennial report to you. I would especially like to draw your attention to developments in the area of juvenile justice, 

a particularly significant and dynamic topic of discussion among all three Branches of government. 

At the top of  the list is the question of  whether to raise the age of  juvenile 

matters jurisdiction to include 16- and 17-year-olds. The impetus to do this has 

been growing over the past several years, and the Legislature last year created 

the Juvenile Jurisdiction Planning and Implementation Committee, which has a 

charge of  planning for the implementation of  any changes required in order to 

extend jurisdiction in delinquency matters to 16- and 17-year-olds. In addition, 

the Legislature also created the Families With Service Needs Advisory Board. 

Its mission is to monitor the progress being made regarding children who are 

members of  families with service needs, to provide advice as requested and 

to make written recommendations. Judges and staff  of  the Judicial Branch are 

members of  both panels, as they both dramatically affect the Branch’s role in 

juvenile justice. 

As I have said many times before, the key to all of  these changes is providing 

the resources and money necessary to fulfill any legislative mandate. One of  

my greatest successes this past year was getting additional resources to fund services for 16- and 17-year-olds. 

This is a distinct and challenging age group that needs developmentally appropriate treatment and mental health 

services. We could not possibly hope to provide these services without appropriate funding. 

On another front regarding children, two additional child protection sessions were established in Danbury and 

Willimantic. The purpose of  these sessions is to assist juvenile courts around the state with managing their 

termination of  parental rights and child protection dockets. In addition, a second Regional Family Trial Docket 

– the first was in Middletown – was established in Waterbury. These dockets allow highly contested child protection 

and family cases to be resolved in a more timely manner. 

The Judicial Branch anticipates many more changes and developments within juvenile justice. I am both impressed 

and humbled by the talents and gifts of  those who have come to the table, all with the goal of  helping our 

children become healthy and responsible adults. To that end, I look forward to working with the Legislative and 

Executive Branches, and the many others who are committed to juvenile justice.

Very truly yours,

William J. Lavery 

Chief  Court Administrator

To the Governor, General Assembly  
and the Citizens of Connecticut,

It is with great pleasure and a sense of  accomplishment that I present to you this 
biennial report on the Connecticut Judicial Branch. 

The past two years have brought significant changes to the Judicial Branch. Chief  
among them is our emphasis on making the court system open, transparent and 
accountable to the residents it serves in this fine state. For this, I am extremely 
grateful to our state’s judges, who work tirelessly every day to protect the interests 
of  all the individuals who come before them. 

I  also  want  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  Executive  and  Legislative 
Branches of government for the leadership and assistance that they have provided 
over the past two years. While I believe strongly in separation of powers, I also 
know that none of  the three Branches operates in a vacuum. We depend on each 
other, and I look forward to our continued collaboration.

Very truly yours,

David M. Borden 
Senior Associate Justice

SUPREME COURT

The Supreme Court is the state’s highest court. It consists of  the Chief  
Justice and six Associate Justices. A panel of  five justices hears and decides 
each case. On occasion, the Chief  Justice summons the court to sit en banc 
as a full court of  seven to hear particularly important cases.

The  Supreme  Court  reviews  decisions  made  in  the  Superior  Court  to 
determine if  any errors of  law have occurred, as well as decisions of  the 
Appellate Court.

Seated (left to right): Justice Flemming L. Norcott, Jr.,  
Senior Associate Justice David M. Borden, and Justice Joette Katz.

Standing (left to right): Justice Peter T. Zarella, Justice Richard N. Palmer,  
Justice Christine S. Vertefeuille, and Senior Justice William J. Sullivan.

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the 
Supreme Court During the Biennium

State v. Iban C., 275 Conn. 624 (2005)

The defendant in this case was convicted on two counts of  
risk of  injury to a minor in connection with two separate 
incidents involving sexual contact with a young girl. He 
raised  several  claims  on  appeal,  including  a  claim  that 
the  trial  court  improperly  had  appointed  a  guardian  ad 
litem for the victim for the purpose of  compelling her to 
testify against her parents’ wishes. The court reversed the 
defendant’s conviction on one of  the counts of  risk of  
injury to a minor on the basis of  an improper evidentiary 
ruling.  The  court  then  determined  that,  although  the 
defendant  did  not  have  standing  to  raise  the  claim 
pertaining to the guardian ad litem, it should address the 
issue because it was likely to arise on remand. The court 
concluded  that  the  parents  had  a  fundamental  liberty 
interest in making decisions for their child, but that the 
state also had an important interest in law enforcement. 
The  court  further  concluded  that  the  trial  court  was 
required to hold a hearing at which it should balance those 
interests in determining whether a guardian ad litem should 
be appointed for the child. If  the trial court determined 
that appointment of  a guardian ad litem was necessary, 
then the guardian ad litem must be afforded a reasonable 
opportunity to asses the child’s interests before the child 
could be compelled to testify.

Clerk of  the Superior Court v. Freedom of  
Information Commission, 278 Conn. 28 (2006)

The  Freedom  of   Information  Act,  General  Statutes  § 
1-200 et seq., applies to records retained by the judicial 
branch  of   the  state  government,  but  only  with  respect 
to its administrative functions. This appeal required the 
Supreme  Court  to  determine  the  scope  and  meaning 
of  the phrase “administrative functions” under the act. 
The  majority  determined  that,  in  order  to  protect  the 
independence of the judiciary, the legislature intended

Clerk of  the Superior Court v. Freedom of  
Information Commission, 278 Conn. 28 (2006) 
Continued

that the phrase would have a narrow meaning. Accordingly, 
it concluded that the act applies only to records pertaining 
to budget, personnel, facilities and physical operations of  
the courts. Justice Palmer issued a concurring opinion in 
which he emphasized his agreement with the majority’s 
point that, although the act does not apply to documents 
relating to the courts’ adjudicatory functions, the public 
has a presumptive right of  access to all court records under 
the first amendment. Justice Norcott issued a dissenting 
opinion, in which Justice Borden and Justice Katz joined, 
arguing that the act has a broader scope and applies to 
some records generated in the adjudicative process that 
are  related  entirely  to  the  internal  management  of   the 
court system.

Hanks v. Powder Ridge Restaurant Corp.,  
276 Conn. 314 (2005)

The central issue in this appeal was the enforceability of an 
exculpatory agreement purporting to release a snowtubing 
operator  from  prospective  liability  for  personal  injuries 
sustained as a result of the operator’s negligent conduct. 
The  majority  concluded  that,  because  there  was  virtually 
unrestricted public access to the snowtubing operation, the 
operator had sole control over the snowtubing conditions 
and  the  agreement  was  a  standardized  adhesion  contract, 
the  agreement  violated  public  policy  and,  therefore,  was 
unenforceable. Justice Norcott issued a dissenting opinion, 
in which Justices Borden and Palmer joined, arguing that, 
because  the  operation  was  not  of  a  type  thought  suitable 
for  regulation,  was  not  an  important  public  service  or  an 
essential  activity  and  patrons  did  not  place  themselves 
or  their  property  under  the  sole  control  of  the  operator, 
the  release  agreement  did  not  violate  public  policy  and  
was enforceable.

State v. Ross, 272 Conn. 577 (2005);  
State v. Ross, 273 Conn. 684 (2005)

State v. Ross, 272 Conn. 577 (2005);  
State v. Ross, 273 Conn. 684 (2005) Continued

The defendant was sentenced to death for the rape and 
murder of  four young women. After the Supreme Court 
affirmed the death sentences in State v. Ross, 269 Conn. 
213  (2004),  the  defendant  waived  further  appeals  and 
collateral attacks on the death sentences. The office of  the 
chief  public defender (office) then attempted to appear 
in the case as the defendant’s next friend, alleging that the 
defendant was incompetent to waive further proceedings. 
In State v. Ross, 272 Conn. 577 (2005), the Supreme Court 
concluded that the office had not presented meaningful 
evidence that the defendant was incompetent and affirmed 
the  trial  court’s  denial  of   its  motion  to  appear  as  next 
friend. The office then filed a petition for a writ of  habeas 
corpus on behalf  of  the defendant in the United States 
District Court for the District of  Connecticut, raising the 
same claims. The District Court issued a stay of  execution 
pending  resolution  of   the  claims,  which  ultimately  was 
vacated by the United States Supreme Court. Thereafter, 
the District Court received allegedly new evidence relating 
to the defendant’s competence and convened a telephone 
conference to discuss the matter with the parties. During 
the conference, the District Court advised the defendant’s 
attorney that he should consider the new evidence very 
seriously. As a result, the defendant’s attorney requested 
a stay of  execution, which the Supreme Court granted. 
The state then requested a hearing in the Superior Court 
on  the  question  of  whether  the  District  Court’s  action 
had  prevented  the  defendant’s  attorney  from  vigorously 
advocating the defendant’s position that he was competent. 
Ultimately, the Superior Court appointed special counsel to 
advocate the position that the defendant was incompetent 
and held a new competency hearing. At the hearing, special 
counsel  argued  that  the  defendant’s  waiver  of  further 
proceedings was involuntary because his volitional capacity 
was impaired. The court found the defendant competent. 
In  State  v.  Ross,  273  Conn.  684  (2005),  the  Supreme 
Court concluded that whether a waiver of  constitutional 
rights was voluntary and whether a defendant’s volitional 
capacity was so impaired as to render him incompetent 
were  distinct  legal  questions  and  there  was  no  issue  as 
to  the  voluntariness  of   the  defendant’s  waiver  in  this 
case. The court affirmed the trial court’s finding that the 
defendant was competent to waive further challenges to 
the death sentences.

Judge  Dranginis  issued  a  concurring  opinion  in  which 
she argued that there was no need to decide in this case 
that an unimpaired volitional capacity was not a necessary 
prerequisite for a finding of  voluntariness. Justice Norcott 
issued a concurring and dissenting opinion in which he 
expressed  his  ongoing  opposition  to  the  death  penalty. 
The defendant was executed on May 13, 2005.

State v. Skakel, 276 Conn. 633 (2006)

The defendant was convicted of  murder in connection 
with the bludgeoning death of  his neighbor. The murder 
occurred in 1975, when the defendant was fifteen years 
old, but the defendant was not charged until twenty-five 
years  later.  The  defendant  raised  numerous  claims  on 
appeal  to  the  Supreme  Court,  including  claims  that  his 
case  improperly  was  transferred  from  the  docket  for 
juvenile  matters  to  the  regular  docket  of   the  Superior 
Court and that his prosecution was time barred by the five 
year statute of  limitations for felonies that was in effect 
at the time of  the murder, which had been subsequently 
amended to except all class A felonies, including murder. 
The majority concluded that the trial court properly had 
transferred  the  case  to  the  regular  docket  because  the 
department of  children and families was the state agency 
solely  responsible  for  the  detention  and  treatment  of  
juveniles and state law prohibited the department from 
accepting for placement anyone over the age of  eighteen. 
The  majority  also  rejected  the  defendant’s  claim  that 
his  prosecution  was  time  barred.  It  reasoned  that  the 
amendment to the statute of  limitations was retroactive 
because  statutes  of   limitation  are  not  penal  provisions 
subject to strict construction, but are remedial, they are 
generally considered to be procedural rules and they create 
no  legitimate  expectancy  interest  in  the  application  of  
the limitations period. The court overruled its contrary 
decision in State v. Paradise, 189 Conn. 346 (1983). In a 
concurring opinion, Justice Katz argued that there was no 
need to reach the question of  whether the amendment 
excepting murder from the five year statute of  limitations 
was retroactive because the statute in effect in 1975 did 
not apply to murder.

APPELLATE COURT

The Appellate Court, like the Supreme Court, reviews decisions of  the 

Superior Court to determine if  errors of  law have occurred.

There are ten Appellate Court judges*, one whom is designated by the 

Chief   Justice  to  be  the  Chief   Judge.  Generally,  three  judges  hear  and 

decide a case, although the court also may sit en banc, which means that 

the entire court participates in the decision.

* On February 1, 2007, Judge William J. Lavery  

  became the Chief  Court Administrator. Pursuant  

 

to Subsection (b) of  Section 51-197c, the 

  Appellate Court shall consist of  10 judges.

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the 
Supreme Court During the Biennium

Continued from page 7

State v. Miranda, 274 Conn. 727 (2005)

State v. Sawyer, 279 Conn. 331 (2006)

This  case  previously  had  come  before  the  Supreme 
Court on two occasions. In State v. Miranda, 245 Conn. 
209  (1998)  (Miranda  I),  the  court  concluded  that  the 
defendant properly had been convicted of  assault under 
General Statutes § 53a-59 (a) (3), even though he was not 
the  perpetrator  of   the  physical  assaults  on  the  victim, 
when he had a familial relationship with the perpetrator, 
had assumed responsibility for the victim and considered 
himself  the victim’s stepfather. The court remanded the 
case to the Appellate Court to consider the defendant’s 
evidentiary and constitutional claims. In State v. Miranda, 
50 Conn. App. 298 (2000), the Appellate Court concluded 
that application of  the statute to the defendant violated 
his  due  process  rights.  In  State  v.  Miranda,  260  Conn. 
92 (2002), the Supreme Court reversed the decision of  
the Appellate Court, concluding that the application of  
the  statute  to  the  defendant’s  conduct  was  reasonably 
foreseeable.  Following  a  resentencing  proceeding,  the 
defendant  brought  this  appeal  to  the  Supreme  Court 
claiming  that  the  judge  trial  referee  who  presided  over 
the proceeding lacked authority to do so and abused his 
discretion in imposing the sentence. The court asked for 
supplemental briefs on the question of  whether it should 
reconsider  its  decision  in  Miranda  I.  The  court  issued 
two  plurality  opinions,  authored  respectively  by  Justice 
Borden and Justice Vertefeuille, concluding, for different 
reasons, that Miranda I had been wrongly decided and that 
§ 53a-59 (a) (3) did not apply to the defendant’s conduct. 
In dissent, Justice Katz argued that Miranda I had been 
correctly decided.

The  defendant  was  convicted  under  various  criminal 
statutes after he entered the victim’s home and sexually 
assaulted her. The Appellate Court affirmed his conviction. 
On appeal to the Supreme Court, the defendant claimed 
that the Appellate Court improperly had concluded that 
the trial court had not abused its discretion in permitting 
the  state  to  introduce  into  evidence  certain  uncharged 
misconduct evidence and that, even if  the evidence was 
improperly admitted, any error was harmless. The majority 
concluded  that  the  trial  court  improperly  had  admitted 
evidence  of   the  defendant’s  prior  misconduct  and  that 
the  error  was  harmful.  In  reaching  this  conclusion, 
the  majority  reconciled  two  competing  standards  for 
establishing harm  in  criminal  cases  involving  claims  of  
improper evidentiary rulings and adopted a new standard 
under which a nonconstitutional error is deemed harmless 
when an appellate court has a fair assurance that the error 
did not substantially affect the verdict. Justice Katz issued 
a concurring opinion in which she stated that, unlike the 
majority,  she  would  reach  the  question  of   whether  the 
Connecticut Code of  Evidence constrains the Supreme 
Court  from  changing  codified  rules  of   evidence  and 
would answer that question affirmatively. Justice Borden 
issued a concurring and dissenting opinion in which he 
agreed with Justice Katz’s concurring opinion and further 
argued  that  only  part  of   the  misconduct  evidence  was 
inadmissible, and the trial court’s admission of that evidence 
was harmless.

Superior Court to determine if  errors of  law have occurred.

There are ten Appellate Court judges*, one whom is designated by the 
Chief   Justice  to  be  the  Chief   Judge.  Generally,  three  judges  hear  and 
decide a case, although the court also may sit en banc, which means that 
the entire court participates in the decision.

* On February 1, 2007, Judge William J. Lavery  
  became the Chief  Court Administrator. Pursuant  
 
to Subsection (b) of  Section 51-197c, the 
  Appellate Court shall consist of  10 judges.

cert. denied, 280 Conn. 909 (2006)

Argued September 23, 2005 
Released December 13, 2005

Argued March 28, 2006 
Released June 27, 2006

The defendant appealed his conviction and sentence on 
two counts of  assault in the second degree, arising from 
an altercation in which he stabbed the victim twice, once 
in the leg and once behind his shoulder. The Appellate 
Court held that the conviction violated the defendant’s 
rights  under  the  double  jeopardy  clause  of   the  fifth 
amendment to the United States constitution because the 
conduct constituted one continuous assault perpetrated 
against one victim in a short period of  time at the same 
location, not two assaults. In reaching this holding, the 
court distinguished this conviction under § 53a-60 (a)(2) 
from cases involving sexual assault, where the legislature 
has expressed a clear intention that each act of  penetration 
be charged as a separate offense. The court rejected the 
state’s argument that the use of  the term “injury” in the 
singular, as used by the statute, indicates an intent to punish 
each act of  causing a physical injury during an assault as 
a separate offense.

The  defendants,  the  city  of   Derby  and  its  workers’ 
compensation insurer, appealed from the decision of  the 
workers’ compensation review board (board) ordering the 
payment of  death benefits to the plaintiff, the widow of  
the decedent. The decedent died of  a heart attack while 
attending  a  contentious  board  of   education  meeting 
in  his  capacity  as  the  superintendent  of   schools.  The 
Appellate Court affirmed the decision of  the board. In 
reaching the decision, the court examined §§ 31-275 (16) 
(B)  (ii)  and  (iii).  The  court  held  that  these  statutes  do 
not  preclude  compensation  for  stress  related  physical 
injuries, such as this fatal cardiac event, under the Workers’ 
Compensation  Act.  This  decision  makes  it  clear  that 
physical  impairments,  such  as  heart  attacks,  regardless 
of   whether  they  precipitated  by  direct  physical  trauma 
or by some type of  nonphysical, work-related mental or 
emotional stress, are not exempt from coverage under the 
Workers’ Compensation Act.

cert. denied, 280 Conn. 923 (2006)

Argued May 16, 2006 
Released June 5, 2006

The plaintiff, after being acquitted on charges of  molesting 
the defendants’ minor child, brought a civil action against 
the defendants alleging, in part, that the defendants have 
falsely accused various individuals, including the plaintiff, 
of  sexually molesting their children. The plaintiff  appealed 
the trial court’s order permitting the defendants to proceed 
anonymously  and  sealing  any  pleading  referring  to  the 
defendants or their minor child by name. After recognizing 
its  jurisdiction  for  review  of   the  matter  under  General 
Statutes § 52-164x (c), the Appellate Court vacated the 
order  and  held  that  the  trial  court  did  not  follow  the 
procedural mandates of  Practice Book § 11-20A because 
it failed to determine the existence of  a substantial privacy 
interest that outweighed the public interest in open judicial 
proceedings and failed to articulate factual findings that 
would support such a conclusion. Instead, the trial court 
had  improperly  addressed  the  motion  on  the  basis  of  
the  implicit  assumption  that  because  the  proceedings 
arose from a prior criminal case involving allegations of  
sexual assault of  a minor child, the use of  pseudonyms 
to protect the child’s privacy would be proper as a matter 
of  course.

THE STATE JUDICIARY

“Judges  rule  on  the  basis  of  law,  not 
public opinion, and they should be totally 
indifferent to pressures of the times.” 

– The Honorable Warren E. Burger 
Former Chief Justice of  the U.S. Supreme Court

Connecticut’s  state  judges  come  from  a  variety  of 
backgrounds; some from private practice, others from 
state service. When they come onto the bench, however, 
a  common  mission  binds  them:  to  resolve  matters 
brought before the courts in a fair, timely, efficient and 
open manner. 

As judges, it is their sworn duty to uphold the Constitution 
of both the United States and the state of Connecticut, and 
to make sure that individual rights and liberties are protected 
through established law. By enforcing the rule of law and 
maintaining a strong, fair and impartial court system, judges 
keep social order and ensure that our democracy continues. 
Judges  take  seriously  their  responsibility  to  ensure  that 
our state court system is transparent and accountable, and 
uphold  on  a  daily  basis  our  core  democratic  values  of  
fairness and the safeguarding of  rights. As important is 
a judge’s duty to ensure access to justice for all.

These guiding principles play out every day in Connecticut’s 
courtrooms.  While  the  cases  may  be  difficult  and 
sometimes  generate  public  criticism,  our  courts  are 
dedicated to their role as guardians of  the constitutional 
rights we value so dearly.

As  recently  noted  by  Superior  Court  Judge  Christine  E. 
Keller,  Administrative  Judge  for  the  Hartford  Judicial 
District:  “I  think  most  of  my  colleagues  achieve  or 
accomplish  something  every  day  simply  by  doing  their 
job and doing it diligently. Many take on extra or difficult 
assignments  –  Rules  Committee,  task  forces,  board 
memberships, controversial and difficult cases, presiding 
over  administrative  responsibilities,  judging  moot  court 
competitions and speaking engagements. In a variety of  
ways, Connecticut’s judges are engaged and involved.”

spoken to various civic groups around the state on issues 
regarding the courts.

During  the  biennium,  the  Office  of   the  Chief   Court 
Administrator, the Judges’ Education Committee, and the 
Office of  Continuing Education produced plenary sessions 
and elective courses for the annual Judges Institute, which 
is  held  in  June.  The  Judges  Institute  provides  a  unique

profession, speak candidly with colleagues, and reflect upon 
their role within the judiciary.

In  2005,  family  support  magistrate  decisions  became 
available on the Judicial Branch website. Before then, the 
decisions were available only in local law libraries.

The Continuing Education Office arranged various training 
programs for judge trial referees and judges to assist in 
providing coverage when family support magistrates are 
unavailable. The judge trial referees have since provided 
invaluable service to the magistrate court.

The Administrative Service Division provides 
essential centralized services to assist the judges 
and the Judicial Branch’s almost 4,000 employees. 
Such services include: development, management, 
monitoring and analysis of the Branch’s General 
Fund  budget;  payroll  administration,  revenue 
and  expenditure  accounting,  and  payment  of 
the  Branch’s  financial  obligations;  coordination 
of  personnel  and  labor  relations  functions  and 
employee benefits administration; capital budget 
development and oversight and facilities planning, 
design and repair; fleet and materials management, 
purchasing and warehousing; and internal auditing 
and investigation.

The  planning  and  management  of  facilities 
is  among  the  most  visible  responsibilities  of 
administrative services.

HIGHLIGHTS OVER THE PAST BIENNIUM INCLUDE:





The  identification  of  land  to  purchase  a  new, 
160,000-square-foot  courthouse  in  Torrington. 
The  Branch  hopes  that  the  building  will  be 
completed by 2010.

A  major  restoration  and  renovation  of  the 
Kendrick Avenue courthouse in Waterbury was 
completed  in  March  2006.  The  building  now 
houses juvenile court. 

The long-delayed new juvenile detention center 
in Bridgeport finally moved forward. Demolition 
of  the  old  buildings  on  the  site,  located  at  the 
corner of Congress Street & Huntington Avenue, 
has been completed and the new facility should 
open in late 2008.

A $2.5 million addition to the New Haven Juvenile 
Detention Center greatly expanded recreation and 
program space.

The parking garage at the Judicial District courthouse 
in Stamford opened in September 2005.

The  new  Appellate  Court  building  at  75  Elm

The Court Support Services Division (CSSD) 

oversees  Pre-Trial  Services,  Family  Services, 

and supervision options for adults and juveniles 

as  well  as  Juvenile  Detention  Services.  A  key 

component  of  its  function  is  to  provide  judges 

with information they use in making decisions.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE  

BIENNIUM INCLUDE:



In  2006,  the  American  Correctional  Association 

(ACA) accredited CSSD’s Adult Probation Services, 

making it only the 12th probation program in the 

nation to receive this recognition. Also in 2006, the 

ACA audited the three juvenile detention centers 

operated by CSSD (Bridgeport, Hartford and New 

Haven) and recommended re-accreditation.



From July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2006, CSSD 

hired 117 new adult probation officers; in January 

2007, it had 490 adult probation officers in the 

field. Higher staffing levels have led to increased 

restitution  collections  and  an  increase  in  the 

number of offenders who successfully complete 

probation. In addition, longitudinal studies show 

a reduction in recidivism. 



In  2006,CSSD  funded  a  new  gender-specific 

transitional  housing  facility  in  New  Haven  for 

court-referred  women  statewide.  Named  The

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE BIENNIUM INCLUDE:



CSSD strengthened the Alternative to Incarceration 
Center model in 2005 to reflect research-based 
best practices in effective programming, principles 
and services in the areas of cognitive behavioral 
therapy,  anger  management,  substance  abuse 
treatment and employment assistance. 

In  2005,  CSSD  implemented  statewide  a  new 
assessment tool to be used by family relations 
counselors on the civil side. The tool, called the 
Intake Assessment Screen, was developed over the 
past three years with the help of  national experts, 
and it facilitates early and in-depth identification 
of  parenting conflicts. The information assists 
family relations counselors in achieving a better 
match between the needs of the family and the 
level of intervention provided. Initial outcome 
measures  have  demonstrated  a  5  percent 
increase in agreement rates by the parties at the 
conclusion of the identified service. 

Also  in  2005,  CSSD  expanded  the  family  civil 
services  menu  to  include  conflict  resolution 
conferences and issue-focused evaluations. These 
services offer clients alternative ways of resolving 
their  custody  disputes.  The  new  services,  when 
paired  with  the  Intake  Assessment  Screen,  are 
demonstrating a 72 percent agreement rate. This 
benefits the court with earlier resolutions and final 
dispositions in referred matters, thus decreasing the 
time needed for trials. 

Juvenile probation services have been enhanced as 
a result of the Emily J. consent judgment. Under an 
agreement with the state Department of Children 
and  Families,  CSSD  juvenile  probation  officers 
collaborate with DCF child welfare social workers 
regarding the development of probation treatment 
plans for detainees.  

In  2005,  CSSD  expanded  the  Juvenile  Risk 
Reduction  Center  model  to  reflect  a  research-
based approach that focuses on providing gender-
specific risk reduction and treatment services to

children.  In  addition,  the  expansion  established 
juvenile  sex  offender  services  for  the  Hartford 
and  Waterford  courts.  Also  in  2005,  CSSD 
implemented  a  new  program,  the  Center  for 
Assessment,  Respite  and  Enrichment  (CARE), 
which was developed as a diversion initiative for 
status-offender girls.

In January 2005, CSSD and DCF, in collaboration 
with  many  public  and  private  partners  and 
stakeholders,  undertook  a  long-term  joint 
strategic  planning  process  regarding  juvenile 
services.  The  plan,  released  in  August  2006, 
focuses  on  prevention,  and  partnerships  with 
parents, schools and the community.

In  2004,  CSSD  developed  and  implemented 
two  new  programs  –  the  Probation  Transition 
Program  (PTP)  and  the  Technical  Violation 
Unit (TVU), in accordance with Section 26(a) of  
Public Act 04-234. PTP is in place in Bridgeport, 
Hartford,  New  Haven,  New  London  and 
Waterbury, and targets inmates who have terms 
of  probation following their discharge from the 
state Department of  Correction. The TVU—in 
Bridgeport, Hartford, New Britain, New Haven, 
New  London  and  Waterbury—is  intended  to 
reduce  the  number  of   probationers  sentenced 
to incarceration because of  technical violations. 
Preliminary  findings  from  both  programs  are 
yielding promising results. 

Also in 2004, 29 new family relations counselors 
were sworn in, the first group to receive a formal 
swearing in and certificate ceremony. Since then, 
17  additional  family  relations  counselors  have 
been hired. 

CSSD  in  2004  implemented  the  Hartford 
Youth Offender Project, which seeks to provide 
age-appropriate  services  and  more  intensive 
supervision to 16- and 17-year-olds on probation. 
Currently,  two  adult  probation  officers  are 
assigned to this program.

Throughout  the  biennium,  External  Affairs 
coordinated  programs  designed  to  provide 
members of  the public with information about 
the law and how the court system in Connecticut 
functions. These programs include the Supreme 
Court Tour program, Seniors & The Law, and 
the Branch’s Speakers Bureau.

them  into  internships.  These  internships  were  at  a 
wide variety of  Judicial Branch work locations, such 
as Jury Administration, probation, small claims, clerks’ 
offices, and Community Court. This program provides 
a meaningful opportunity for students to learn about the 
Judicial Branch while providing the Branch with valuable 
volunteer hours. 

The Volunteer/Intern Program also started the Job 
Shadow Program, which offers high school students 
the  opportunity  to  “shadow”  work  place  hosts  in 
court or a Judicial Branch facility, as they go through 
their normal work day. Several area high schools have 
participated in the program.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PAST TWO YEARS INCLUDE:

Over the past year, IT has upgraded services for 
Judicial PC and laptop users. These enhancements 
include the migration of  more than 4,000 Judicial 
Branch employees to a Microsoft Exchange e-mail 
and calendar system, which when completed in 
January 2006, capped one of  the largest rollouts 
of   new  technology  since  the  Y2K  project. 
Microsoft  Exchange  provides  users  the  ability 
to  share  electronic  collaboration  tools  among 
several groups.



In  October  2005,  scheduling  information  was 
added to the Case Lookup section of  the Branch’s 
website, allowing easy access to members of  the 
public and attorneys.







In February 2006, e-filing case types expanded to 
include property and contract case types. With 
the addition of  these case types, 85 percent of  all 
cases filed in the clerks’ offices are now eligible to 
be electronically filed. Currently, more than 308 
e-filed documents are received each day.



Enhancements  continue  to  be  made  to  the  
e-filing program. In May 2006, several correction 
functions were added for the courts, including the 
ability to correct scanning errors and the improper 
placement of  electronic documents, as well as the 
ability to change pro se address information on 
the  web  immediately.  In  June  2006,  electronic 
check capability was added for attorneys.

The  Criminal/Motor  Vehicle  system  was 
extensively  modified  in  response  to  legislation 
that  automatically  assigns  certain  16-  and  17-
year-olds  to  youthful  offender  status.  The 
system includes a new YO docket that meets the 
requirements of  the new law.

violence dockets in the New Britain, Norwalk and 
New London Geographical Area courts.

In 2006, the Branch, as part of  an initiative by Gov. 
M. Jodi Rell, established three special gun dockets in 
the GA courts serving Hartford, New Haven and 
Bridgeport. With these dockets, a dedicated judge in 
each location presides over all GA cases involving 
the illegal use or possession of  a firearm. 

As a result of  a three-year effort, the Commission 
on  Accreditation  for  Law  Enforcement  Agencies 
granted  the  Judicial  Marshal  Training  Academy 
accreditation status in July 2005.  The academy had 
to  comply  with  182  standards  to  gain  the  initial 
accreditation, which lasts three years. The academy

In  2006,  the  Judicial  Branch  added  two  Child 
Protection Sessions (one in Danbury, the other 
in Willimantic) to assist Juvenile Matters sessions 
statewide  with  managing  their  termination  of  
parental rights and child protection trial dockets.

HIGHLIGHTS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS INCLUDE:









In 2005, two additional judges were assigned to the 
Complex Litigation Docket (CLD). This provided 
the opportunity to consolidate and improve the 
complex litigation dockets, with an aim toward 
the more efficient use of  personnel, facilities, and 
equipment. As a result, New Britain’s complex 
litigation  docket  moved  in  March  2006  to  the 
Hartford Judicial District courthouse, and New 
Haven’s docket moved to the Waterbury Judicial 
District courthouse.

The  division’s  e-filing  initiative  continued  to 
grow.  As  of   Nov.  13,  2006,  approximately  88 
percent of  newly initiated cases may be e-filed 
and 27,945 documents have been e-filed by 351 
attorneys/law firms. There were four times as 
many  e-filed  documents  as  of   Nov.  13,  2006, 
as there were on June 30, 2006. In addition, as 
of  Nov. 13, 2006, 150 onsite presentations had 
been made to more than 1,300 attorneys and law 
office staff, and 80 classroom sessions had been 
scheduled with 450 participants registered. 

The  Court  Operations  Division  completed 
implementation  of   the  Paperless  Rearrest 
Warrant Network (PRAWN) in every municipal 
police  department  in  the  state.  Roll-out  to 
Connecticut State Police troops has begun and 
is scheduled to be completed by spring 2007.  

The  Judicial  Branch  now  uses  digital  audio 
recording in 72 courtrooms to record proceedings 
and  produce  transcripts.  Digital  recording 
provides superior audio quality, faster access to 
records and a centralized backup of all recordings 
and notes. The Branch will continue installing 
digital audio recording in additional courtrooms 
and hearing rooms.



A  new  Court  Service  Center  opened  in  the 
New  Haven  Judicial  District  Courthouse  in 
2006, bringing the total number of centers to 
nine statewide.







The Office of  Victim Services hired four victim 
services advocates to fill vacancies at the Bristol, 
New Haven, Norwich and Derby geographical area 
courts. In addition, OVS’ notification program is 
collaborating with the Department of  Correction’s 
Victim Services Unit and the Board of  Pardons and 
Parole Victim Services Unit to improve services 
provided to victims of  incarcerated offenders. 

Support Enforcement Services (SES) worked with 
the Office of  the Chief  Court Administrator to 
improve the rate of  capias executions. SES also 
provided  enhanced  customer  service  in  three 
pilot  locations  under  a  $100,000  federal  grant 
award  entitled  “Customer  Service  Outreach.” 
Introductory  phone  calls,  reminder  phone  calls 
and more user-friendly notices of  case and court 
events were used. 

SES    also  launched  a  special  law  enforcement 
initiative  in  2005,  targeting  more  than  5,000 
noncustodial parents who had not paid anything 
on  their  child  support  order  for  at  least  three 
months, and many of  them for three to 10 years. 
Three months later SES had collected $203,977 
from 14 percent of  these cases. The initiative was 
repeated in August 2006. 

The work of the Statewide Bar Counsel’s Office 
and  the  Office  of  Chief  Disciplinary  Counsel 
in  implementing  new  rules  concerning  attorney 
discipline has resulted in a significant decrease in the 
amount of time it takes for a grievance complaints 
to  go  through  the  system.  The  Statewide  Bar 
Counsel reports that in calendar year 2005, it took 
114 days on average from the filing of a complaint 
to a finding of probable cause; the national average 
is 285 days. Also in calendar year 2005, it took 253 
days from the filing of a complaint to disposition 
by  the  Statewide  Grievance  Committee;  the 
national average is 447 days.

The Law Libraries’ website won the Justice Served 
2006  Web  Award.  It  was  chosen  from  among 
more than 3,500 court websites worldwide.

Jury  Administration  expanded  its  Outreach 
Program during the biennium and visited high 
schools  in  every  judicial  district  in  the  state. 
Response to this program has been positive with 
many teachers calling for return presentations by 
outreach staff. Analysis of data collected from 
the schools shows that 66 percent of students 
surveyed  had  a  positive  overall  attitude  about 
jury service prior to the outreach presentations. 
Positive attitudes toward jury service increased 
to 80 percent after the presentation.

Programming was completed for a new computer 
system that will be used by Jury Administration 
and  the  courts  for  summoning  and  managing 
jurors. The system will allow Jury Administration 
to  be  more  responsive  to  the  needs  of   the 
public and the court. It is anticipated that the 
new system will be fully operational at the close 
of  2007.

New jury publications were developed as part 
of  Jury Administration’s overall outreach efforts. 
These publications were developed for college 
students and Spanish-speaking individuals in an 
effort to provide specialized information about 
jury duty for these target audiences.

Also  during  the  biennium,  the  jury  summons 
envelope was re-designed to include a message 
in Spanish instructing recipients to contact Jury 
Administration via telephone for assistance with 
the summons.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
