IN RE ANTHONY S.*
(AC 45549)

Alvord, Moll and Cradle, Js.

Syllabus

The respondent mother appealed to this court from the judgment of the
trial court terminating her parental rights with respect to her minor
child, A. The mother was incarcerated following an incident in 2016,
during which A was exposed to an unsafe environment. As a result, the
Department of Children and Families placed A in a department licensed
home with a maternal cousin and her family. The trial court granted an
order of temporary custody filed by the petitioner, the Commissioner
of Children and Families, and, thereafter, A was adjudicated neglected
and committed to the custody and care of the petitioner. The trial
court ordered specific steps for the mother to take to facilitate her
reunification with A. In 2019, the trial court approved a permanency
plan with a recommendation of termination of the mother’s parental
rights, and the petitioner filed a petition for the termination of the
mother’s parental rights. A’s father had died prior to the filing of the
petition for termination. Held:

1. The trial court properly determined by clear and convincing evidence that
the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify the respondent
mother with A: the record contained ample evidence to support the
trial court’s conclusion, including that the department had referred the
mother to multiple providers of substance abuse and mental health
treatment, even after she informed the department that she would not
participate in the dialectical behavior therapy that was recommended
to her following a court-order psychiatric evaluation, provided her on
two occasions with a security deposit and the first month’s rent for an
apartment to help her obtain and secure housing after she had been
evicted for nonpayment of rent, provided her with transportation and/
or bus passes so that she could travel to her appointments and her visits
with A, and provided her with supervised visitation with A in a myriad
of formats and arrangements despite frequent disruptions during those
visits due to her inappropriate and aggressive behavior.

2. The trial court properly determined that the respondent mother had failed
to achieve the requisite degree of personal rehabilitation, as required
by statute (§ 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (i)), to reasonably encourage a belief
that she could, within a reasonable time, assume a responsible position
in A’s life: in its decision, the trial court detailed each of the specific
steps that the mother had failed to follow and the corresponding facts
that supported its determination that the petitioner had proven by clear
and convincing evidence that the mother had failed to rehabilitate,
namely, her failure to fully comply with the specific steps, her inappropri-
ate behavior during her visitations with A, and her failure to engage in
appropriate mental health treatment to develop an understanding of
A’s needs, in particular, the impact of an unsafe environment on his
mental health.

3. The trial court’s determination that termination of the respondent mother’s
parental rights was in A’s best interest was factually supported and
legally sound: the trial court made findings relating to each of the seven
factors set forth in § 17a-112 (k) before making its determination on
the basis of the totality of the circumstances; moreover, in its decision,
the trial court emphasized that A had been living in his foster care
placement for five years, he was thriving there, and he was very attached
to his foster family, it explicitly stated that it balanced A’s need for
stability and permanency against the potential benefit of maintaining a
connection with the mother, and it noted that A’s counsel and guardian
ad litem both recommended termination of the mother’s rights; further-
more, although there was some evidence that the mother and A loved
each other, such evidence was insufficient for this court to conclude
that the trial court improperly determined that it was in A’s best interest
to terminate the mother’s parental rights.

Opinion

ALVORD, J. The respondent mother, Agnes W.,
appeals from the judgment of the trial court terminating
her parental rights with respect to her minor child,
Anthony S.1 On appeal, the respondent claims that the
trial court improperly determined that (1) the Depart-
ment of Children and Families (department) made rea-
sonable efforts toward reunification between the
respondent and Anthony, (2) the respondent had failed
to rehabilitate to such a degree as to reasonably encour-
age a belief that she could assume a responsible position
in the life of her child, and (3) the termination of the
respondent’s parental rights was in the best interest of
Anthony.2 We affirm the judgment of the trial court.

The following facts, which the court found by clear
and convincing evidence, and procedural history, are
relevant to this appeal. On November 8, 2016, the
department invoked a ninety-six hour administrative
hold on behalf of Anthony ‘‘due to the [respondent]
being incarcerated and exposing [Anthony] to an unsafe
environment.’’3 That same day, Anthony was placed in
a department licensed relative home with a maternal
cousin and her husband.

On November 10, 2016, the petitioner, the Commis-
sioner of Children and Families, sought an order of
temporary custody, which the court granted, and filed
a neglect petition on behalf of Anthony because the
respondent remained incarcerated. On November 18,
2016, the court sustained the order of temporary cus-
tody.

On January 30, 2017, Anthony was adjudicated
neglected and committed to the care and custody of
the petitioner. He continued to reside in the relative
foster care placement. The court ordered specific steps
for the respondent to take to facilitate her reunification
with Anthony. The steps required her, inter alia, to keep
all appointments set by or with the department; to coop-
erate with visits by the child’s court-appointed attorney
and/or guardian ad litem; to take part in counseling
services referred to her by the department; to accept
and engage in-home support services referred to her
by the department; to refrain from using illegal drugs or
abusing alcohol or medicine; to cooperate with service
providers’ recommendations for parenting, individual,
and family counseling, in-home support services and/
or substance abuse assessment or
to
enhance her parenting skills and ensure the safety of
her home environment; to address her mental health
issues and understand the impact of an unsafe home
environment on Anthony; to cooperate with court-
ordered evaluations or testing; to obtain and/or main-
tain adequate housing and a legal income; and to visit
with Anthony as often as the department permits.4

treatment;

On July 25, 2019, the court approved a permanency

plan with a recommendation of termination of the
respondent’s parental rights and adoption. On August
14, 2019, the petitioner filed a petition for the termina-
tion of the respondent’s parental rights as to Anthony.5

The termination of parental rights trial was held on
June 21, August 13, September 2, September 10, and
October 26, 2021. During the trial, the petitioner pre-
sented testimony from Jennifer Bushnell, a department
social worker assigned to the case from April, 2018, to
June, 2019; Kevin Paquette, a permanency clinician at
Klingberg Family Centers (Klingberg), a child welfare
agency; Stacey Shanahan, a department social worker
assigned to the case in June, 2019; Ralph Balducci, a
psychologist who testified as an expert in the area of
children and families and conducted a court-ordered
evaluation of the respondent and Anthony in 2018;
Melissa Silagy, Anthony’s therapist since June, 2017;
and Emilia Anello, Anthony’s guardian ad litem since
the fall of 2018. The respondent testified and presented
testimony from her former partner, Leodardo Serrano,
who previously had lived with the respondent and
Anthony, and the respondent’s stepfather, Mario Perez
Cruz (Perez).

On April 8, 2022, the court issued a memorandum of
decision in which it terminated the respondent’s paren-
tal rights.6 After setting forth the legal principles govern-
ing a termination of parental rights proceeding,7 the
court stated that it ‘‘has carefully considered the peti-
tions, all the evidence and testimony presented, and
the arguments of counsel, according to the standards
required by law. The court has observed all the wit-
nesses and determined the validity and credibility of
their testimonies.’’

Relevant to the adjudicatory phase of the termination
proceeding, the court found ‘‘by clear and convincing
evidence that the department has made reasonable
efforts to reunify the child with the respondent.’’ Addi-
tionally, the court found that the respondent had failed
to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation
pursuant to General Statutes § 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (ii).
In support of its determination, the court stated that,
at the time of the adjudication of neglect on January
30, 2017, the respondent’s ‘‘presenting problems were
[her] unaddressed mental health, substance abuse,
domestic violence, criminal activity, and parenting con-
cerns.’’ Moreover, the court recognized that, on January
30, 2017, the court ordered the respondent to comply
with specific steps to facilitate the return of Anthony
to her care. The court proceeded to set forth each spe-
cific step with which the respondent had failed to com-
ply and provided factual support for each enumeration.
The court concluded that the respondent ‘‘is unable to
safely care for her child despite services offered, due
to her mental health issues and unpredictable and
explosive behaviors. [The respondent] will not be able

to assume a responsible position in the life of the child
within a reasonable period of time.’’

In support of its decision, the court also made the
following relevant findings regarding the respondent,
Anthony, and their history of visitation. The court found
that the respondent ‘‘has a history of domestic violence
with her ex-husband, Johnny K.’’ The court noted that
‘‘Anthony continues to present as anxious and fearful
when discussing the events that took place while he was
residing with [the respondent] and her ex-husband.’’
See footnote 3 of this opinion. Additionally, the court
found that the respondent ‘‘has not been consistent
with attending individual therapy.’’ The court also noted
that the respondent provided proof to the department
of her medical marijuana card; however, it ‘‘expired
on June 8, 2019, and she is still testing positive for
[tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)].’’ The court stated that
the respondent’s ‘‘last positive urine drug [THC] screen
was on August 2, 2019.’’

.

The court stated that the respondent ‘‘report[s] that
she is able to effectively parent Anthony’’ and she
‘‘denies utilizing physical discipline .
.’’ The court
noted that ‘‘it has been reported by Anthony’s therapist
that Anthony has disclosed to her that [the respondent]
has hit him. Anthony compiled a list of questions to
process with [the respondent including] . . . ‘Why do
you hit me?’ ’’ The court further noted that the respon-
dent ‘‘has knowledge of Anthony’s questions and contin-
ues to deny that she has used physical discipline.’’

.

.

.

The court found that Anthony was eleven years old at
the time of trial. The court noted that, since November
8, 2016, Anthony has been residing in a department
licensed relative foster home with a maternal cousin,
her husband, and her two daughters. The court found
that ‘‘Anthony has adjusted well since the placement’’
. that he loves
and that he ‘‘has his own bedroom .
.
.’’ Additionally, the court found that ‘‘Anthony
enjoys playing outdoors, playing video games, building
Lego sets and building his own Lego creations. Anthony
also enjoys going to school and is involved in soccer,
which he reported that he enjoys playing.’’ Moreover,
the court stated that, on ‘‘June 27, 2017, Anthony partici-
pated in an intake for individual therapy services with
. . . Silagy, a clinician . . . [whom] [h]e continues to
meet with . . . on a weekly basis.’’8

.

In regard to visitation, the court found that the
respondent ‘‘is sometimes inconsistent with being pres-
ent for her supervised visits.’’ Additionally, the court
found that, when the respondent and Anthony engaged
in visitation, the visits occasionally ‘‘had to end prema-
turely due to [the respondent’s] inappropriate, aggres-
sive, and argumentative behaviors. For example, during
a supervised visit on March 14, 2019, Anthony was sit-
ting on [the respondent’s] lap looking at pictures on
her cell phone. When Anthony returned to his foster

home that evening, he reported to his foster mother that
he was scrolling through pictures on [the respondent’s]
phone and saw nude photos of her ‘bathing suit area,’
‘front area,’ ‘butt and breasts.’ Anthony said he kept
scrolling, and that there were ‘so many of them.’
Anthony indicated that [the respondent] did not stop
him from looking at the photos. This [interaction]
resulted in a report to the department’s Careline.9

[The respondent]

‘‘Also on May 24, 2019 . . . the visitation room that
[was] usually reserved was full and occupied, so [the
respondent] was told that the visit would need to be
in a different room. [The respondent] then walked up
to the doors of the visitation rooms, while occupied,
and was pulling the visitation charts off the doors and
was reading them. Bushnell asked her to stop, as that
information is confidential.
then
yelled at Bushnell
in the waiting room in front of
Anthony, other clients, and social workers, ‘You thought
I was going to give up on my son!’ She then started
yelling inside the visitation room, ‘You told me I can’t
have my visit at Chuck E. Cheese. The judge knows.’
[The respondent] then commented on how Bushnell
and Shanahan were late to the supervised visit. Bushnell
informed her that she is always given her time, and it
is always made up if needed to equal one hour. [The
respondent] then said, ‘No you don’t. It is only an hour.’
At this point, she was yelling and standing up at the
table while Anthony was sitting at the table looking
down at the floor. Bushnell asked her to stop yelling,
as it appear[ed] as though it was making her son uncom-
fortable. [The respondent] then said, ‘You don’t know
my son!’ Bushnell asked [the respondent] to focus on
her visit and indicated that her behaviors were inappro-
priate. [The respondent] then yelled, ‘How am I being
inappropriate?’ [The respondent] then said, ‘What about
his report card?’ Bushnell gave [her] the report card.
[The respondent] said, ‘Wow you actually did your job
for once’ and ‘You are a drug addict, and everybody
knows about you, girl.’ At this point in time, the super-
vised visit had to end.

‘‘After the visit ended, Bushnell and Shanahan spoke
to Anthony about the visit and the reason it ended.
Anthony pointed on his emotions chart that he felt
‘hurt.’ Anthony pointed to ‘hot and cold, stomachache,
sweating, and fast heart rate’ on his physical feelings
chart. Anthony then said that he did not feel safe and
doesn’t like when [the respondent] yells.’’ (Footnote
added.)

In the dispositional phase; see footnote 7 of this opin-
ion; the court considered the seven statutory factors
of § 17a-112 (k)10 before finding that, ‘‘in considering the
child’s sense of time, need for a secure and permanent
environment, need to avoid future placements, and the
totality of circumstances, the court concludes that ter-
mination of the parental rights of the respondent . . .

is in the best interests of the minor child.’’ This appeal
followed. Additional facts and procedural history will
be set forth as necessary.

Before turning to the respondent’s claims, we set
forth the following relevant legal principles. ‘‘Proceed-
ings to terminate parental rights are governed by § 17a-
112. . . . Because a respondent’s fundamental right to
parent his or her child is at stake, [t]he statutory criteria
must be strictly complied with before termination can
be accomplished and adoption proceedings begun.’’
(Internal quotation marks omitted.) In re Tresin J., 334
Conn. 314, 322–23, 222 A.3d 83 (2019). Section 17a-112
(j) provides in relevant part that ‘‘[t]he Superior Court,
upon notice and hearing as provided in sections 45a-
716 and 45a-717, may grant a petition filed pursuant to
this section if it finds by clear and convincing evidence
that (1) the Department of Children and Families has
made reasonable efforts to locate the parent and to
reunify the child with the parent in accordance with
subsection (a) of section 17a-111b, unless the court
finds in this proceeding that the parent is unable or
unwilling to benefit from reunification efforts, except
that such finding is not required if the court has deter-
mined at a hearing pursuant to section 17a-111b, or
determines at trial on the petition, that such efforts are
not required, (2) termination is in the best interest of
the child, and (3) . . . (B) the child (i) has been found
by the Superior Court or the Probate Court to have
been neglected, abused or uncared for in a prior pro-
ceeding, or (ii) is found to be neglected, abused or
uncared for and has been in the custody of the commis-
sioner for at least fifteen months and the parent of
such child has been provided specific steps to take to
facilitate the return of the child to the parent pursuant
to section 46b-129 and has failed to achieve such degree
of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief
that within a reasonable time, considering the age and
needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsi-
ble position in the life of the child . . . .’’

I

The respondent first claims that the court improperly
the department made reasonable

determined that
efforts to reunify her with Anthony. We disagree.

The following legal principles and standard of review
are relevant to our resolution of this claim. ‘‘Section
17a-112 (j) (1) requires that before terminating parental
rights, the court must find by clear and convincing evi-
dence that the department has made reasonable efforts
to locate the parent and to reunify the child with the
parent, unless the court finds in this proceeding that
the parent is unable or unwilling to benefit from reunifi-
cation efforts provided such finding is not required if
the court has determined at a hearing .
. that such
efforts are not appropriate .
. Thus, the depart-
ment may meet its burden concerning reunification in

.

one of three ways: (1) by showing that it made such
efforts, (2) by showing that the parent was unable or
unwilling to benefit from reunification efforts or (3) by
a previous judicial determination that such efforts were
not appropriate.
[I]n determining whether the
department has made reasonable efforts to reunify a
parent and a child .
. the court is required in the
adjudicatory phase to make its assessment on the basis
of events preceding the date on which the termination
petition was filed. . . . This court has consistently held
that the court, [w]hen making its reasonable efforts
determination . . . is limited to considering only those
facts preceding the filing of the termination petition or
the most recent amendment to the petition . . . .

.

.

.

‘‘Our review of the court’s reasonable efforts determi-
nation is subject to the evidentiary sufficiency standard
of review.
. Under this standard, the inquiry is
whether the trial court could have reasonably con-
cluded, upon the facts established and the reasonable
inferences drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect
of the evidence was sufficient to justify its [ultimate
conclusion].
. When applying this standard, we
construe the evidence in a manner most favorable to
sustaining the judgment of the trial court.
. The
court’s subordinate findings made in support of its rea-
sonable efforts determination are reviewed for clear
error.’’ (Citations omitted;
internal quotation marks
omitted.) In re Ryder M., 211 Conn. App. 793, 808–809,
274 A.3d 218, cert. denied, 343 Conn. 931, 276 A.3d
433 (2022).

.

.

.

.

The court properly determined by clear and convinc-
ing evidence that the department had made reasonable
efforts to reunify the respondent with Anthony. In sup-
port of its determination, the court stated that the
department engaged in ‘‘reasonable and active efforts,’’
which included ‘‘providing case management and sup-
port services’’ to the respondent; referring the respon-
dent ‘‘to Southwest Community Health Services to be
evaluated for and to receive substance abuse and men-
.
tal health treatment,’’ ‘‘Therapeutic Family Time .
services via the Community Mental Health Affiliates,’’
and to ‘‘dialectical behavior therapy . . . providers in
Waterbury, Hartford, and Southington’’; offering a ‘‘Per-
manency Placement Service Program through Kling-
berg’’; and providing the respondent with ‘‘weekly super-
vised visits with her son,’’ offering ‘‘supervised visits in
a clinical setting,’’ and providing ‘‘thirty-one day bus pas-
ses’’ to her.

.

On appeal, the respondent argues that the court
improperly found that appropriate services had been
offered to her to assist in reunification. Specifically,
the respondent argues that ‘‘the court pointed to the
respondent’s mental health issues and behavior. How-
ever, this does not take into consideration the impact
on the respondent and the child of their separation and

the ensuing stress, anxiety and anger that it caused.’’11
The petitioner responds that ‘‘[t]he record is full of
evidence showing the department’s consistent and tar-
geted efforts to help [the respondent] overcome the
impediments to reunification, including her untreated
to
mental health issues, substance abuse, refusal
acknowledge the full extent of Anthony’s trauma, and
history of unstable housing.’’ We agree with the peti-
tioner.

‘‘[O]ur courts have consistently held that [t]he word
reasonable is the linchpin on which the department’s
efforts in a particular set of circumstances are to be
adjudged, using the clear and convincing standard of
proof. Neither the word reasonable nor the word efforts
is, however, defined by our legislature or by the federal
act from which the requirement was drawn. . . . [R]ea-
sonableness is an objective standard . . . and whether
reasonable efforts have been proven depends on the
careful consideration of the circumstances of each indi-
vidual case.
[R]easonable efforts means doing
everything reasonable, not everything possible.’’ (Cita-
tions omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) In re
Unique R., 170 Conn. App. 833, 855, 156 A.3d 1 (2017).

.

.

.

The record contains ample evidence to support the
court’s determination that the department engaged in
reasonable efforts to reunify the respondent with
Anthony. To assist the respondent in obtaining sub-
stance abuse and mental health treatment, the depart-
ment referred her to the Southwest Community Health
Center, Tides of Mind Counseling (Tides of Mind), the
Institute of Living, and St. Vincent’s Behavioral Health.
Pursuant to a recommendation from Dr. Balducci, who
conducted a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation of the
respondent, the department made several referrals for
the respondent to participate in dialectical behavior
therapy12 (DBT). The court found that, ‘‘[o]n August 29,
2018, Bushnell made a referral to Tides of Mind for
DBT . . . . On October 26, 2018, [the respondent] still
had not participated in her intake with Tides of Mind
due to cancelling and rescheduling multiple appoint-
ments and going to the wrong address.’’ The court fur-
ther found that Tides of Mind ceased activity on the
respondent’s referral because she ‘‘miss[ed] so many
scheduled intake appointments and [was] difficult to
get ahold of .
.’’ The court noted that, thereafter,
Bushnell ‘‘called the Institute of Living DBT program
in Hartford, [a] DBT private practice provider . .
. in
. Apple Valley Behavioral Health in
Southington .
Plantsville, and [also] Wilcox Wellness in Southington
to inquire about their DBT programs.’’ The court stated
that the respondent subsequently informed Bushnell
and Paquette that ‘‘she was not going to participate in
DBT anywhere.’’ The court further found that, despite
the respondent’s expressed refusal to engage in DBT
services, the department ‘‘re-referred [her] to DBT pro-
vider, St. Vincent’s Behavioral Health . . . .’’ Addition-

.

.

.

ally, the court found that the department assisted the
respondent in obtaining stable and secure housing by
providing her with a security deposit and first month’s
rent for two successive apartments and notifying her
of Section 8 rental assistance program openings. The
court stated that the respondent, however, was evicted
from two apartments for nonpayment of rent during
the department’s involvement. Additionally, the court
found that the department assisted the respondent’s
travel to her appointments and to visits with Anthony
by providing her with transportation or bus passes.

Moreover, the record supports the court’s finding that
the department actively sought reunification between
the respondent and Anthony by providing supervised
visitation in a myriad of formats and arrangements
despite frequent disruptions due to the respondent’s
behavioral outbursts. In April, 2018, the department
provided the respondent with weekly supervised visita-
tion with Anthony in the community. However, in June,
2018, the department moved the supervised visits to
the department’s offices where security was available
due to concerns that the respondent was ‘‘argumenta-
tive’’ with the supervisor and had made the supervisor
‘‘uncomfortable.’’ Then, due to several incidents where
the respondent ‘‘was raising her voice, [and] was caus-
ing a scene in the waiting room’’ at the department’s offices,
the department sought to conduct supervised visitation
between the respondent and Anthony in yet another
format, with therapeutic providers. The department uti-
lized a variety of providers, including Anthony’s thera-
pist, Silagy,13 Therapeutic Family Time, and Klingberg.
After the respondent was ‘‘unsuccessfully discharged’’
from Klingberg’s therapeutic reunification program in
the spring of 2019, the department resumed supervised
visits between the respondent and Anthony at the depart-
ment’s offices.

On the basis of the evidence in the record and the
reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, the court rea-
sonably could have concluded that the evidence was
sufficient to justify its determination that the depart-
ment had made reasonable efforts to reunify the respon-
dent and Anthony.

II

The respondent next claims that the court improperly
determined that she had failed to rehabilitate to such
a degree as to reasonably encourage a belief that she
could, within a reasonable time, assume a responsible
position in Anthony’s life. We disagree.

We begin by setting forth the following relevant legal
principles and standard of review. ‘‘The trial court is
required, pursuant to § 17a-112, to analyze the [parent’s]
rehabilitative status as it relates to the needs of the
particular child, and further .
. such rehabilitation
must be foreseeable within a reasonable time. . . . The

.

statute does not require [a parent] to prove precisely
when [she] will be able to assume a responsible position
in [her] child’s life. Nor does it require [her] to prove
that [she] will be able to assume full responsibility for
[her] child, unaided by available support systems. It
requires the court to find, by clear and convincing evi-
dence, that the level of rehabilitation [she] has achieved,
if any, falls short of that which would reasonably
encourage a belief that at some future date [she] can
assume a responsible position in [her] child’s life.’’
(Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)
In re Shane M., 318 Conn. 569, 585–86, 122 A.3d 1247
(2015). ‘‘Personal rehabilitation as used in [§ 17a-112
(j) (3) (B) (i)] refers to the restoration of a parent to
[her] former constructive and useful role as a parent.
.
. [I]n assessing rehabilitation, the critical issue is
not whether the parent has improved [her] ability to
manage [her] own life, but rather whether [she] has
gained the ability to care for the particular needs of the
[children] at issue. . . .

.

.

.

‘‘[The] completion or noncompletion [of the specific
steps], however, does not guarantee any outcome. . . .
Accordingly, successful completion of expressly articu-
lated expectations is not sufficient to defeat a depart-
ment claim that the parent has not achieved sufficient
rehabilitation.
. Whereas, during the adjudicatory
phase of a termination proceeding, the court is generally
limited to considering events that precede the date of
the filing of the petition or the latest amendment to the
petition, also known as the adjudicatory date, it may
rely on events occurring after the [adjudicatory] date
. . . when considering the issue of whether the degree
of rehabilitation is sufficient to foresee that the parent
may resume a useful role in the child’s life within a
reasonable time. . . .

‘‘A conclusion of failure to rehabilitate is drawn from
both the trial court’s factual findings and from its
weighing of the facts in assessing whether those find-
ings satisfy the failure to rehabilitate ground set forth in
§ 17a-112 (j) (3) (B). Accordingly . . . the appropriate
standard of review is one of evidentiary sufficiency,
that is, whether the trial court could have reasonably
concluded, upon the facts established and the reason-
able inferences drawn therefrom, that the cumulative
effect of the evidence was sufficient to justify its [ulti-
mate conclusion].
. When applying this standard,
we construe the evidence in a manner most favorable
to sustaining the judgment of the trial court. . . . We
will not disturb the court’s subordinate factual findings
unless they are clearly erroneous. . . . A factual find-
ing is clearly erroneous when it is not supported by
any evidence in the record or when there is evidence
to support it, but the reviewing court is left with the
definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been
made.’’ (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal
quotation marks omitted.) In re G. H., 216 Conn. App.

.

.

671, 684–85, 286 A.3d 944 (2022).

The respondent argues, inter alia, that ‘‘the trial court
erred in finding that [she] had failed to rehabilitate’’
because the ‘‘testimony presented clearly demonstrates
that the respondent has been engaged in services, and
is willing to reengage in services so that she can provide
for her son.’’14 Additionally, she argues that, other than
the child’s therapist,
‘‘everyone involved with the
respondent and the child . . . noted the respondent’s
issues and at times her difficulties in interactions with
others, but they all agreed that the respondent and child
each loved each other and cared for each other, and
that the child wanted to still have continuing contact
with the respondent.’’ We disagree.

In its memorandum of decision, the court detailed
each of the specific steps that the respondent had failed
to follow and the corresponding facts supporting its
determination that the respondent had failed to rehabili-
tate. Specifically, the court noted that the respondent
(a) has not kept all appointments set by or with the
department; (b) has been inconsistent at times with
therapy and the counseling services referred by the
department; (c) has failed to accept and cooperate with
in-home services referred to by the department, specifi-
cally participation in DBT; (d) has continued to test
positive for marijuana, despite having an expired medi-
cal marijuana card; (e) has failed to cooperate with
service providers for parenting, individual, and family
counseling, to enhance her parenting skills, to ensure
the safety of her home environment, and to understand
the impact of an unsafe home environment on the child;
(f) has not cooperated with all court-ordered testing
evaluations, specifically a competency evaluation; (g)
has failed to obtain or maintain adequate housing and
a legal income; and (h) is ‘‘sometimes inconsistent with
. [which]
being present for her supervised visits .
have also had to end prematurely due to [her] inappro-
priate, aggressive, and argumentative behaviors.’’
Thereafter, the court concluded that the respondent
‘‘is unable to safely care for her child despite services
offered, due to her mental health issues and unpredict-
able and explosive behaviors. [The respondent] will not
be able to assume a responsible position in the life of
the child within a reasonable period of time.’’

.

Construing the record before us in the manner most
favorable to sustaining the judgment of the trial court,
as we are obligated to do; see In re G. H., supra, 216
Conn. App. 685; we conclude that the record contains
sufficient evidence to support the court’s conclusion
that the petitioner had proven by clear and convincing
evidence that the respondent had failed to rehabilitate
considering the age and needs of Anthony. Although ‘‘[a]
finding of rehabilitation is not based on a mechanistic
tabulation of whether a parent has undertaken specific
steps ordered’’; (internal quotation marks omitted) In

.

.

re Yolanda V., 195 Conn. App. 334, 347 n.12, 224 A.3d
182 (2020); the court appropriately emphasized the
respondent’s lack of consistent engagement in individ-
ual counseling, reluctance to participate in DBT as rec-
ommended by the court-appointed psychologist, and
‘‘inappropriate, aggressive, and argumentative behav-
iors’’ during visitations in finding that the respondent
has failed to gain the insight and ability to care for
Anthony. See id. The court noted that Anthony is diag-
.
nosed with ‘‘post-traumatic stress disorder
impulse control, and conduct disorder . . . as well as
parent-child relational problem[s].’’ The court found
that five years after Anthony was removed from the
respondent’s care, he ‘‘continues to present as anxious
and fearful when discussing the events that took place
while he was residing with [the respondent] and her
ex-husband.’’ Moreover, the court found that, on at least
one occasion when the respondent acted in an ‘‘inappro-
priate, aggressive, and argumentative’’ manner during
supervised visitation with Anthony, he reported that ‘‘he
did not feel safe and doesn’t like when [the respondent]
yells.’’ Accordingly, it was imperative that the respon-
dent engage in appropriate mental health treatment to
develop an understanding of Anthony’s needs, particu-
larly the impact of an unsafe home environment on his
mental health. See In re Ryder M., supra, 211 Conn.
App. 814 (‘‘[i]n assessing rehabilitation, the critical issue
is .
. whether [the parent] has gained the ability to
care for the particular needs of the child at issue’’ (inter-
nal quotation marks omitted)). The court properly con-
cluded that the respondent had failed to do so.

.

The evidence in the record does not support the
respondent’s assertion that she ‘‘has been engaged in
services, and is willing to reengage in services so that
she can provide for her son.’’ Dr. Balducci testified that,
on the basis of the reports and documents he received as
part of his court-ordered evaluation of the respondent
in June, 2018, he recommended that the respondent
engage in DBT to learn ‘‘strategies for distress toler-
ance, interpersonal effectiveness, emotional regulation
and mindfulness.’’ Despite the court finding that the
department referred the respondent to numerous men-
tal health and DBT providers, the respondent ‘‘did not
accept DBT .
.’’ Additionally, the court found that
the respondent ‘‘is inconsistent at times with therapy,’’
both in attendance and engagement. The court found
that the respondent’s therapist, Jessica Davis, reported
that the respondent’s ‘‘therapy sessions with her have
been ‘bashing’ sessions for months, in which she will
arrive to vent and express displeasure about [the depart-
ment], the court, Anthony’s foster mother, and her sister
. [and the respondent] claimed she was given the
.
wrong information about DBT and was being ‘set up’
and sent to the wrong place.’’ Furthermore, the record
reflects that, ‘‘[t]o the department’s knowledge, [the
respondent] was not engaged in any mental health ser-

.

.

.

.

vices from January, 2020, until March, 2021.’’ There-
after, the record reflects that the respondent engaged
in some individual counseling with a provider at Tides
of Mind and attended a DBT group therapy session
that ‘‘was a bad fit for [the respondent], [as] she was
overwhelmed and ‘was triggered.’ ’’ The respondent tes-
tified that she ‘‘was receiving therapy but [is] not having
any contact with her [therapist] right now .
.
because she lied to me’’ and that she has subsequently
been discharged from Tides of Mind because she
stopped attending. Despite the fact that the respondent
acknowledges in her brief that ‘‘there is clearly a need
for [her] to be able to engage in appropriate individual
counseling and in DBT therapy,’’ she has failed to
engage in the requisite treatment to address her mental
health issues for the past five years that Anthony has
been in the department’s care. See In re Shane M.,
supra, 318 Conn. 589 (‘‘respondent’s failure to acknowl-
edge the underlying personal issues that form the basis
for the department’s concerns indicates a failure to
achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation’’
(internal quotation marks omitted)).

.

.

Moreover, the respondent’s behavior during visita-
tions with Anthony further supports the court’s determi-
nation that she failed to ‘‘[gain] the insight and ability
to care for .
. her child given the age and needs of
the child within a reasonable time.’’ In re Victor D., 161
Conn. App. 604, 617, 128 A.3d 608 (2015). As set forth
previously, the court found that ‘‘[s]upervised visits
have . . . had to end prematurely due to [the respon-
dent’s] inappropriate, aggressive, and argumentative
behaviors,’’ including showing Anthony nude photos of
herself and yelling ‘‘in the waiting room in front of
Anthony, other clients, and social workers . . . .’’ The
court found that, following the visit during which the
respondent was yelling at the department social work-
. said that he did not feel safe and
ers, ‘‘Anthony .
doesn’t like when [the respondent] yells.’’ Additionally,
Paquette testified that, while he was conducting super-
vised visitation between the respondent and Anthony,
‘‘there were times when [the respondent] would say
things and accuse her son of being a liar and during
the .
. [Paquette] was concerned that
that [behavior] was harming her relationship with her
son.’’ By way of example, Paquette testified that the
respondent often called Anthony a liar when they dis-
cussed ‘‘an incident that [Anthony] described that hap-
pened in the home where he thought [the respondent]
was in serious physical jeopardy of being harmed by
her husband so he called the police,’’ the incident that
led to Anthony’s removal from the respondent’s care.
See footnote 3 of this opinion. Thereafter, Paquette
testified that he did not recommend reunification
because the respondent ‘‘struggled with being able to
really understand her son’s experience and to validate
his experience in what he had been through.’’ See In

. visits .

.

.

re G. H., supra, 216 Conn. App. 688 (‘‘[i]t is well estab-
lished that [i]n a case tried before a court, the trial judge
is the sole arbiter of the credibility of the witnesses
and the weight to be given specific testimony’’ (internal
quotation marks omitted)).

On the basis of the foregoing evidence, including the
respondent’s reluctance to address her mental health
issues, her failure to fully comply with the specific steps
ordered by the court, and her inappropriate behaviors
during visits with Anthony, we conclude that the court
properly determined that the respondent had failed to
achieve the requisite degree of personal rehabilitation
as required by § 17a-112 (j) (3) (B). See In re A’vion
A., 217 Conn. App. 330, 353, 288 A.3d 231 (2023).

III

Last, the respondent claims that the court improperly
determined that termination of her parental rights was
in the best interest of Anthony. We disagree.

We first set forth the relevant principles and the stan-
dard of review. ‘‘In the dispositional phase of a termina-
tion of parental rights hearing, the emphasis appropri-
ately shifts from the conduct of the parent to the best
interest of the child. . . . It is well settled that we will
overturn the trial court’s decision that the termination
of parental rights is in the best interest of the [child]
only if the court’s findings are clearly erroneous. . . .
The best interests of the child include the child’s inter-
ests in sustained growth, development, well-being, and
continuity and stability of [his] environment.
. In
the dispositional phase of a termination of parental
rights hearing, the trial court must determine whether
it is established by clear and convincing evidence that
the continuation of the [respondent’s] parental rights
is not in the best interest of the child. In arriving at this
decision, the court is mandated to consider and make
written findings regarding seven statutory factors delin-
eated in [§ 17a-112 (k)].
. The seven factors serve
.
simply as guidelines for the court and are not statutory
prerequisites that need to be proven before termination
can be ordered. . . . There is no requirement that each
factor be proven by clear and convincing evidence.’’
(Internal quotation marks omitted.) In re Brian P., 195
Conn. App. 558, 579, 226 A.3d 159, cert. denied, 335
Conn. 907, 226 A.3d 151 (2020).

.

.

.

‘‘It is axiomatic that a trial court’s factual findings
are accorded great deference. Accordingly, an appellate
tribunal will not disturb a trial court’s finding that termi-
nation of parental rights is in a child’s best interest
unless that finding is clearly erroneous. . . . A finding
is clearly erroneous when either there is no evidence
in the record to support it, or the reviewing court is
left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake
has been made.
. On appeal, our function is to
determine whether the trial court’s conclusion was fac-

.

.

tually supported and legally correct. . . . In doing so,
however, [g]reat weight is given to the judgment of
the trial court because of [the court’s] opportunity to
observe the parties and the evidence. . . . We do not
examine the record to determine whether the trier of
fact could have reached a conclusion other than the
one reached. . . . [Rather] every reasonable presump-
tion is made in favor of the trial court’s ruling.’’ (Citation
internal quotation marks omitted.) In re
omitted;
Davonta V., 285 Conn. 483, 488, 940 A.2d 733 (2008).

The respondent argues that the ‘‘court erred in finding
that it was in the best [interest] of the child to grant
the petition for termination of parental rights .
.
[because] [i]n this case, it is undisputed that there is a
bond between the respondent and her son, and that
they both love and care for each other.’’ The respondent
asserts, therefore, that ‘‘[t]he proper determination for
the child’s best [interest] is not to terminate parental
[rights but] rather, to institute a vigorous therapeutic
program toward rebuilding the relationship between
the parent and the child.’’15 We are unpersuaded.

.

The court considered and made findings under each
of the seven statutory factors of § 17a-112 (k) before
determining that, under the totality of the circum-
stances, a termination of the respondent’s parental
rights was in the best interest of Anthony. In setting
forth its findings, the court emphasized that Anthony
‘‘is thriving in [his department licensed relative foster
care] placement and is extremely attached to his foster
parents and their children’’ and has stated that ‘‘he
enjoys the fact that there is no violence in this home.’’
Additionally, the court stated that it ‘‘examined multiple
relevant factors, including the child’s interests in sus-
tained growth, development, well-being, stability, and
continuity of [his] environment; his length of stay in
foster care; the nature of his relationship with [his]
foster parents and biological parent; the degree of con-
tact maintained with his biological parent; and [his]
genetic bond to the respondent.’’ Moreover, the court
explicitly stated that it ‘‘also balanced the child’s intrin-
sic need for stability and permanency against the poten-
tial benefit of maintaining a connection with his biologi-
cal parent.’’ Finally, the court noted that ‘‘counsel for
the child recommends termination of the respondent’s
parental rights, as does the guardian ad litem for the
minor child.’’ In conclusion, the court stated that, ‘‘con-
sidering the child’s sense of time, need for a secure and
permanent environment, need to avoid future place-
ments, and the totality of circumstances, the court con-
cludes that termination of the parental rights of the
respondent .
. is in the best [interest] of the minor
child.’’

.

‘‘Our appellate courts have recognized that long-term
stability is critical to a child’s future health and develop-
ment . . . .’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In re

.

Anthony H., 104 Conn. App. 744, 767, 936 A.2d 638
(2007), cert. denied, 285 Conn. 920, 943 A.2d 1100
(2008); see also In re Davonta V., supra, 285 Conn.
494 (our Supreme Court recognizing that ‘‘[v]irtually all
experts, from many different professional disciplines,
agree that children need and benefit from continuous,
stable home environments’’ (internal quotation marks
omitted)). The court found that Anthony was removed
from the respondent’s care on November 8, 2016, and
placed with his current relative foster placement at the
age of six. At the time of the trial, Anthony, who was
then eleven years old, had been living with his foster
family for five years, and the trial court found that he
‘‘is extremely attached to his foster parents,’’ loves
them, and ‘‘wants to be adopted by [them].’’16 See Gen-
eral Statutes § 17a-112 (k) (4) and (5). Moreover, the
trial court’s findings were supported by the testimony
of Anthony’s guardian ad litem, who testified that it is
‘‘in Anthony’s best interest to remain in the foster home
and be adopted by the foster family . . . because they
have been providing his basic needs .
. [t]hey have
his best interests in mind . . . [and they take] care of
him as if he was their own.’’ See In re Kadon M., 194
Conn. App. 100, 107, 219 A.3d 985 (2019) (‘‘a guardian
ad litem must promote and protect the best interest of
a child’’ (internal quotation marks omitted)). In support
of her argument, the respondent asserts that ‘‘it is undis-
puted that there is a bond between the respondent and
her son, and that they both love and care for each
other.’’ Although there was some evidence for the
court’s consideration that the respondent and Anthony
love one another, such evidence is insufficient for this
court to conclude that the trial court improperly deter-
mined that it is in Anthony’s best interest to terminate
the respondent’s parental rights. See In re Ryder M.,
supra, 211 Conn. App. 821 (‘‘[t]hat a bond may exist
between the respondent and [the child] does not under-
cut the court’s best interest determination in light of
the myriad of other considerations taken into account
by the court’’ (emphasis added)); In re Anthony H.,
supra, 765–66 (‘‘[o]ur courts consistently have held that
even when there is a finding of a bond between parent
and a child, it still may be in the child’s best interest
to terminate parental rights’’ (internal quotation marks
omitted)). Accordingly, we conclude that the court’s
determination that termination of the respondent’s
parental rights was in Anthony’s best interest was factu-
ally supported and legally sound.

The judgment is affirmed.

In this opinion the other judges concurred.

2 Pursuant to Practice Book §§ 67-13 and 79a-6 (c), the attorney for the
minor child filed a statement adopting the brief filed by the petitioner, the
Commissioner of Children and Families.

3 The record reflects that the department received a call from the Bridge-
port Police Department indicating that the police were called to the respon-
dent’s home on a neighbor’s report of a domestic dispute between the
respondent and her partner at the time, Johnny K. Upon obtaining a search
warrant, the police found ‘‘a large amount of [c]ocaine . . . in the bedroom
area . . . [and] drug paraphernalia was found in the kitchen, such as mate-
rial to ‘cut’ the cocaine and a scale . . . .’’ The police observed the respon-
dent to have ‘‘a small laceration on her forearm and swelling on the left
side of her face’’ and that Anthony, age six, was in the home with another
child. The respondent and Johnny were ‘‘arrested on charges of [p]ossession
with [i]ntent to [s]ell, [p]ossession [w]ithin 1500 [f]eet of a [s]chool, [d]isor-
. [and Johnny] was
derly [c]onduct, and [r]isk of [i]njury to a [m]inor .

4 The respondent’s complete specific steps were (1) to keep all appoint-
ments set by or with the department and to cooperate with the department’s
home visits, announced or unannounced, and visits by Anthony’s court-
appointed attorney and/or guardian ad litem; (2) to let the department and
her and Anthony’s attorneys know her and Anthony’s whereabouts at all
times; (3) to take part in counseling and make progress toward the identified
treatment goals, specifically, to ‘‘[e]nhance parenting skills and ensure [the]
safety of [the] home environment; address mental health issues [and] under-
stand [the] impact of [an] unsafe home environment [on] children’’; (4) to
accept the in-home support services referred by the department and cooper-
ate with them; (5) to submit to a substance abuse evaluation and follow
the recommendations about treatment, including inpatient treatment if nec-
essary, aftercare and relapse prevention; (6) to submit to random drug
testing, the time and method of testing to be determined by the department;
(7) not to use illegal drugs or abuse alcohol or medicine; (8) to cooperate
with service providers recommended for parenting, individual, and family
counseling, in-home support services and/or substance abuse assessment
and/or treatment, including a ‘‘[p]arenting program, to be referred/individual
therapy/substance abuse treatment, Southwest Community Health Center
[and] AIC program-Community Solutions’’; (9) to cooperate with court-
ordered evaluations or testing; (10) to sign releases allowing the department
to talk to service providers to check on attendance, cooperation, and prog-
ress toward identified goals and for use in future proceedings with the court;
(11) to sign releases allowing Anthony’s attorney and guardian ad litem to
review his medical, psychological, psychiatric and/or educational records;
(12) to get or maintain adequate housing and a legal source of income; (13)
to immediately inform the department of any changes in the makeup of the
household to make sure that the change does not hurt the health and safety
of the child; (14) to have no further involvement with the criminal justice
system and to follow conditions of probation or parole; (15) to cooperate
with Anthony’s therapy; (16) to visit Anthony as often as the department
permits; (17) to notify the department in writing of the name, address, family
relationship, and birthdate of any person(s) whom the department should
investigate and consider as a placement resource for Anthony; and (18) to
tell the department the names and addresses of Anthony’s grandparents.

5 The petitioner had previously filed a petition for termination of parental
rights as to Anthony on August 24, 2018, which was withdrawn on May
14, 2019.

6 In its memorandum of decision, the court also denied two of the respon-
dent’s motions: (1) a motion to revoke commitment of Anthony filed on
July 29, 2020, to which the petitioner filed an objection on November 9,
2020, and (2) a motion for posttermination visitation filed on August 18, 2021,
to which the petitioner and counsel for Anthony filed separate objections
on September 1, 2021.

On her appeal form, the respondent purports to appeal from the court’s
denial of her motions. The respondent, however, has not briefed any specific
claims of error with respect to these rulings and, thus, has abandoned those
aspects of her appeal. See Casiraghi v. Casiraghi, 200 Conn. App. 771, 772
n.1, 241 A.3d 717 (2020). ‘‘It is necessary to this court’s review of a party’s
claims on appeal that [her] brief contain, inter alia, argument and analysis
regarding the alleged errors of the trial court, with appropriate references

to the facts bearing on the issues raised.’’ Zappola v. Zappola, 159 Conn.
App. 84, 86, 122 A.3d 267 (2015).

7 ‘‘Proceedings to terminate parental rights are governed by [General Stat-
utes] § 17a-112. . . . Under § 17a-112, a hearing on a petition to terminate
parental rights consists of two phases: the adjudicatory phase and the dispo-
sitional phase. During the adjudicatory phase, the trial court must determine
whether one or more of the . . . grounds for termination of parental rights
set forth in § 17a-112 [(j) (3)] exists by clear and convincing evidence. . . .
If the trial court determines that a statutory ground for termination exists,
then it proceeds to the dispositional phase. During the dispositional phase,
the trial court must determine whether termination is in the best interests
of the child. .
. . The best interest determination also must be supported
by clear and convincing evidence.’’ (Citation omitted; internal quotation
marks omitted.) In re Shane M., 318 Conn. 569, 582–83 n.12, 122 A.3d
1247 (2015).

8 The court noted that, ‘‘[a]ccording to Silagy, Anthony is diagnosed with
post-traumatic stress disorder . . . child physical abuse, confirmed, other
specified disruptive, impulse control, and conduct disorder (to include inap-
propriate sexualized behaviors) as well as parent-child relational problems.’’
Additionally, the court stated that ‘‘[s]ome of Anthony’s long-term goals are
to recall the traumatic event without becoming overwhelmed with negative
emotions; interact normally with friends and family without irrational fears
or intrusive thoughts that control behavior; return to pre-trauma level of
functioning without avoiding people, places, thoughts, or feelings associated
with the traumatic event; display a full range of emotions without experienc-
ing loss of control; and develop and implement effective coping skills that
allow for carrying out normal responsibilities and participating in relation-
ships and social activities.’’

9 ‘‘Careline is a department telephone service that mandatory reporters
and others may call to report suspected child abuse or neglect.’’ In re
Katherine H., 183 Conn. App. 320, 322 n.4, 192 A.3d 537, cert. denied, 330
Conn. 906, 192 A.3d 426 (2018).

10 General Statutes § 17a-112 (k) provides: ‘‘Except in the case where
termination of parental rights is based on consent, in determining whether
to terminate parental rights under this section, the court shall consider and
shall make written findings regarding: (1) The timeliness, nature and extent
of services offered, provided and made available to the parent and the child
by an agency to facilitate the reunion of the child with the parent; (2)
whether the Department of Children and Families has made reasonable
efforts to reunite the family pursuant to the federal Adoption and Safe
Families Act of 1997, as amended from time to time; (3) the terms of any
applicable court order entered into and agreed upon by any individual or
agency and the parent, and the extent to which all parties have fulfilled
their obligations under such order; (4) the feelings and emotional ties of
the child with respect to the child’s parents, any guardian of such child’s
person and any person who has exercised physical care, custody or control
of the child for at least one year and with whom the child has developed
significant emotional ties; (5) the age of the child; (6) the efforts the parent
has made to adjust such parent’s circumstances, conduct, or conditions to
make it in the best interest of the child to return such child home in the
foreseeable future, including, but not limited to, (A) the extent to which
the parent has maintained contact with the child as part of an effort to
reunite the child with the parent, provided the court may give weight to
incidental visitations, communications or contributions, and (B) the mainte-
nance of regular contact or communication with the guardian or other
custodian of the child; and (7) the extent to which a parent has been
prevented from maintaining a meaningful relationship with the child by
the unreasonable act or conduct of the other parent of the child, or the
unreasonable act of any other person or by the economic circumstances of
the parent.’’

11 Additionally, as part of the respondent’s argument that the department
failed to offer appropriate services to her, she asserts that ‘‘[t]he [department]
never made a referral for a neutral family therapist.’’ The respondent’s
argument falters on the fact that she has failed to direct us to any evidence
that tends to support her claim; rather, she merely asserts that the child’s
therapist was ‘‘not ‘a neutral party.’ ’’ We are unpersuaded by the respon-
dent’s argument because, ‘‘[e]ven if the evidence had established that addi-
tional family therapy might have been beneficial, such evidence does not
render the trial court’s finding clearly erroneous.’’ In re Melody L., 290 Conn.
131, 147, 962 A.2d 81 (2009), overruled in part on other grounds by State

v. Elson, 311 Conn. 726, 91 A.3d 862 (2014).

12 ‘‘Dialectical [b]ehavior [t]herapy is an evidence-based psychotherapy to
treat borderline personality disorder and is useful in treating patients seeking
change in behavioral patterns such as substance abuse and domestic or
non-domestic violence against others. It is a process in which the therapist
helps the patient find and employ strategies and ultimately synthesize them
to accomplish consistently the defined ultimate goal and is used to treat
borderline personality disorders and addictive personality disorders. To be
successful, it demands honesty both from the patient and the clinician.’’
(Internal quotation marks omitted.) In re Aubrey K., 216 Conn. App. 632, 661
n.14, 285 A.3d 1153 (2022), cert. denied, 345 Conn. 972, 286 A.3d 907 (2023).
13 In support of her claim that the court improperly determined that the
department had made reasonable efforts toward reunification, the respon-
dent argues that ‘‘[t]he [department] did not offer appropriate services to
[her] and, if anything, contributed to the deterioration of the parent-child
relationship by allowing the child’s therapist to exert inappropriate control
of the visitation between the respondent and her child.’’ The respondent
furthers asserts that ‘‘the child’s therapist actively undermined the relation-
ship between the respondent and her son,’’ ‘‘[t]he involvement of the child’s
therapist to supervise visits and/or to provide family therapy was entirely
inappropriate,’’ and ‘‘[t]he child’s therapist took a difficult situation regarding
the increasing strain and anxiety of the relationship during visits between
the respondent and her child and made it worse.’’

In response, the petitioner asserts that the respondent ‘‘glosses over the
dispositive fact that Ms. Silagy only supervised her visits with Anthony for
one month out of the six years [that] Anthony has been in the department’s
care. So any concerns about Ms. Silagy’s supervision would not be a basis
for reversing the trial court’s finding that the department’s reunification
efforts on the whole were reasonable.’’ Additionally, the petitioner notes
that, ‘‘[a]s soon as [the respondent] expressed concerns about Ms. Silagy,
the department secured a new provider, Klingberg, to supervise the visits.’’
We agree with the petitioner’s response.

‘‘[O]ur courts are instructed to look to the totality of the facts and circum-
stances presented in each individual case in deciding whether reasonable
efforts have been made.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In re Ryder
M., supra, 211 Conn. App. 811. The totality of the circumstances reveals
that the department made extensive efforts to support visitation between
the respondent and Anthony prior to its decision to utilize Silagy as a
therapeutic services provider, the department utilized her therapeutic ser-
vices for a very short period of time, and, following cessation of her services,
the department continued to make reasonable efforts toward reunification
between the respondent and Anthony by making alternative arrangements
for therapeutic services. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the depart-
ment’s use of Anthony’s therapist as a visitation supervisor rendered the
entirety of the petitioner’s efforts inappropriate.

14 As set forth in her principal appellate brief, the majority of the respon-
dent’s arguments in support of her failure to rehabilitate claim simply restate
her arguments in support of her reasonable efforts claim. For example, as
a general proposition, the respondent maintains that ‘‘there is insufficient
evidence to support the court’s finding that the respondent has failed to
rehabilitate herself, especially when considering the limitation of services,
as well as interference by the child’s therapist in the reunification process.’’
We have already concluded that the court properly found that the department
made reasonable efforts to reunify Anthony with the respondent; see part
I of this opinion; accordingly, we decline to address the respondent’s argu-
ments premised on the department’s efforts. Additionally, for the same
reasons, we reject the respondent’s arguments premised on the alleged
‘‘interference’’ of the child’s therapist. See footnote 13 of this opinion.

15 In her reply brief, the respondent argues, for the first time, that ‘‘[t]here
[was] a clear alternative to termination of parental rights especially when
the child is placed with a family member . . . [and the court] can find that
it is appropriate to have a permanent transfer of guardianship rather than
a termination of parental rights as being in the [child’s] best [interest].’’
During oral argument before this court, the respondent’s appellate counsel
conceded that, because this argument was not raised in the respondent’s
principal brief, this court need not review it. We decline to review the
respondent’s argument because not only was it not raised in her principal
appellate brief, but it also was not raised before the trial court. See In re
Sequoia G., 205 Conn. App. 222, 234–35, 256 A.3d 195, cert. denied, 338
Conn. 904, 258 A.3d 675 (2021).

16 In support of her argument, the respondent asserts that she ‘‘raised her
child for seven years and according to the testimony of Mr. Serrano and
Mr. Perez, the respondent was loving, kind, attentive and met her son’s
needs when he was in her care.’’ Additionally, the respondent cites to In
re Kezia M., 33 Conn. App. 12, 17–18, 632 A.2d 1122, cert. denied, 228 Conn.
915, 636 A.2d 847 (1993), for the proposition that ‘‘the commonly understood
general obligations of parenthood entail these minimum attributes . . . 1.
Expressions of love and affection; 2. Personal concern for the health, educa-
tion and well-being of the child; 3. Supplying food, clothing, medical care,
etc. for the minor child; 4. Providing adequate housing for the child; and 5.
Providing social and religious guidance for the child.’’ (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) Thereafter, she asserts that she ‘‘undeniably has expressed
her love and affection for her son, she has expressed interest in her son’s
health, education and well-being by bringing gifts and food to the visits, she
has bought him food, clothing and gifts, she can provide adequate housing,
and she has attempted to provide social and religious guidance as well.’’

The court in In re Kezia M. cited to ‘‘[t]he commonly understood general
obligations of parenthood’’ as part of its analysis of whether the parent had
abandoned his child pursuant to what is now § 17a-112 (j) (3) (A), which
is not at issue in this appeal. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In re
Kezia M., supra, 33 Conn. App. 18. Accordingly, we are unpersuaded by the
respondent’s argument.
