If the main office is not within your county, but a branch office of the institution is within your county, make demand on an employee of such branch office as long the employee and the branch office have been designated by the financial institution in accordance with regulations adopted by the commissioner of banking. Only upon demand of a financial institution which does not have any main office or branch office in this state, demand may be made by certified mail, return receipt requested. After having made demand you are directed to serve a true and attested copy of this execution, together with the attached affidavit and Exemption Claim form, Financial Execution (form JD CV 24 A) , with your doings endorsed thereon, upon the financial institution officer upon whom the demand was made. Receive the sum paid by the financial institution and apply it on this execution in accordance with the provisions of General Statutes § 52 367 b. Do not serve more than one financial institution execution per Judgment Debtor at a time, including copies. After service of an execution on one financial institution, do not serve the same execution or a copy on another financial institution until receiving confirmation from the preceding financial institution that the Judgment Debtor had insufficient funds available for collection to satisfy the execution. However, any additional service . of an execution must not be made later than 45 days from your initial receipt of the execution. Also, after service of an execution, do not serve the same execution or a copy on the financial institution if an electronic direct deposit from a readily identifiable source described in General Statutes § 52 376 b (c) was made to the Judgment Debtor's account within the look back period described in General Statutes § 52 376 b (c) (2 months or, with regard to federal benefits, such greater period as required by federal law) .

Remove from the Judgment Debtor's account the amount of any debts due from you to the Judgment Debtor not exceeding the total amount included in box 9 of the application on page 1 of this form, plus postjudgment interest, if ordered by the . court, and the serving officer's fee.

If no such deposits have been . made to the Judgment Debtor™s account during the look back period, or if such readily identifiable funds are less than . $1, 000, leave in the account as exempt pursuant to General Statutes § 52 352 b (18) , the lesser of the account balance or . $1, 000 in the aggregate. To the extent that such funds are left in the account as exempt pursuant to General Statutes § . 52 352 b (18) , the provisions of that section shall not be the basis for a claim of exemption pursuant to this section in . response to a levy of execution. However, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit your right or obligation to . remove such funds from the Judgment Debtor's account if required by any other provision of law or by a court order. The . Judgment Debtor shall have full and customary access to any funds left in the account. You may notify the Judgment . Creditor that funds have been left in the Judgment Debtor's account pursuant to this provision.

If you do not receive the Exemption Claim Form, Financial Institution Execution form or secured party claim notice within 15 days of mailing the required documents to the Judgment Debtor and any secured party, you must, upon demand, pay the . serving officer the amount removed from the Judgment Debtor's account. 6. If no Exemption Claim Form, Financial Institution Execution form or secured party claim notice is filed or if the court orders you to pay the serving officer an amount removed from the Judgment Debtor's account not exceeding the amount due on . the execution and you fail or refuse to do so, you shall be liable in an action to the Judgement Creditor (s) named in the . execution for the amount of nonexempt monies which you fail or refuse to pay, excluding funds of up to $1, 000 which you . in good faith allowed the Judgment Debtor to access pursuant to General Statutes § 52 367 b (c) . 7.
