OF CORRECTION
(AC 41663)

Alvord, Prescott and Elgo, Js.

Syllabus

The petitioner, who had been convicted, on a plea of guilty, of various
crimes and other offenses, sought a writ of habeas corpus, claiming,
inter alia, that certain legislative changes to a risk reduction earned
credit program had been improperly applied to him by the respondent,
the Commissioner of Correction. The habeas court, sua sponte and
without providing the petitioner with prior notice or an opportunity to
be heard, dismissed the petitioner’s amended petition pursuant to the
rule of practice (§ 23-29), concluding that it lacked subject matter juris-
diction over the petition and that the amended petition failed to state
a claim on which habeas corpus relief could be granted. On the granting
of certification, the petitioner appealed to this court. Held:

1. Contrary to the respondent’s claims, the petitioner’s appeal was not moot:
although the petitioner was no longer incarcerated, he was serving a
seven year period of special parole with an end date in 2027, and, if the
petitioner were to prevail on his appellate claim, the benefit to the
petitioner would be the retroactive modification of his definite sentence
so as to incorporate his risk reduction earned credits, thereby advancing
his effective release date and reducing the amount of time he is required
to spend on special parole; moreover, the petitioner’s opportunity to be
heard regarding the dismissal of his claims by virtue of his appeal
before this court did not constitute an adequate substitute to make an
appropriate record before the habeas court; furthermore, read broadly,
the petitioner’s petition for habeas corpus did not address whether the
petitioner had received all of the risk reduction earned credits to which
he claimed to be entitled or only a portion thereof, thus, the respondent,
without pointing to anything else in the factual record, could not prevail
on his claim that the petitioner’s appeal was moot as he had already
received the benefits of the risk reduction earned credits underlying
his petition.

2. In light of our Supreme Court’s recent decisions in Brown v. Commis-
sioner of Correction (345 Conn. 1), and Boria v. Commissioner of
Correction (345 Conn. 39), this court concluded that, although the
habeas court was not obligated to conduct a hearing before dismissing
the amended petition, it was required to provide to the petitioner prior
notice of its intention to dismiss, on its own motion, the amended
petition and an opportunity to submit a brief or a written response
addressing the proposed basis for dismissal, which it did not do; accord-
ingly, on remand, should the habeas court again elect to exercise its
discretion to dismiss the amended petition on its own motion pursuant
to Practice Book § 23-29, the court must comply with Brown and Boria
by providing the petitioner with prior notice and an opportunity to
submit a brief or written response addressing the proposed basis for dis-
missal.

Argued January 11—officially released March 21, 2023

Procedural History

Amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus,
brought to the Superior Court in the judicial district of
Tolland, where the court, Hon. Edward J. Mullarkey,
judge trial referee, rendered judgment dismissing the
petition, from which the petitioner, on the granting of
certification, appealed to this court. Reversed; further
proceedings.

Naomi T. Fetterman, assigned counsel, with whom,
on the brief, was Temmy Ann Miller, assigned counsel,

for the appellant (petitioner).

Zenobia G. Graham-Days, assistant attorney general,
with whom, on the brief, were William Tong, attorney
general, and Clare Kindall, former solicitor general, for
the appellee (respondent).

Opinion

PRESCOTT, J. The petitioner, Donald Leffingwell,
appeals, following the granting of his petition for certifi-
cation to appeal, from the judgment of the habeas court
dismissing sua sponte, pursuant to Practice Book § 23-
29,1 his amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
In that petition, he claimed, inter alia, that his federal
and state constitutional rights were violated as a result
of legislative changes pertaining to the administration
and application of risk reduction earned credits (RREC).2
On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court improp-
erly dismissed his petition without first providing him
with notice and an opportunity to be heard. In accor-
dance with our Supreme Court’s decisions in Brown v.
Commissioner of Correction, 345 Conn. 1, 282 A.3d 959
(2022), and Boria v. Commissioner of Correction, 345
Conn. 39, 282 A.3d 433 (2022), we conclude that the
habeas court should not have dismissed the habeas
petition pursuant to § 23-29 without first providing the
petitioner with notice and an opportunity to submit a
brief or other written response addressing the proposed
basis for dismissal. Accordingly, we reverse the judg-
ment of the habeas court and remand for further pro-
ceedings in accordance with this decision.

The following procedural history is relevant to this
appeal. The petitioner pleaded guilty to multiple robber-
ies and other offenses that he committed in 2010. He
received a total effective sentence of eleven and one-
half years of incarceration followed by seven years of
special parole. On August 18, 2014, the petitioner filed a
petition for a writ of habeas corpus as a self-represented
party. He simultaneously filed a request for the appoint-
ment of counsel and an application for waiver of fees,
both of which the court granted on August 21, 2014. The
court subsequently issued the writ. Appointed counsel
filed an appearance on behalf of the petitioner on Octo-
ber 19, 2015. An amended petition for a writ of habeas
corpus was filed on January 26, 2017. The petitioner
filed a fourteen count revised amended petition on
October 31, 2017, which constitutes the operative peti-
tion.

By order dated March 23, 2018, the court, Hon.
Edward J. Mullarkey, judge trial referee, sua sponte
dismissed the habeas action pursuant to Practice Book
§ 23-39 (1), (2) and (5). Prior to dismissing the action,
the court did not provide the petitioner with an opportu-
nity to be heard with respect to the dismissal.3 The
petitioner filed a petition for certification to appeal in
accordance with General Statutes § 52-470 (g), which
the court granted. This appeal followed.

On October 1, 2021, this court granted the parties’
joint motion to stay the appeal pending a final resolution
of the appeals in Brown v. Commissioner of Correction,
supra, 345 Conn. 1, and Boria v. Commissioner of Cor-

rection, supra, 345 Conn. 39, which were then pending
before our Supreme Court and involved similar claims.
After our Supreme Court officially released its decisions
in Brown and Boria, we ordered the parties to file
supplemental briefs ‘‘addressing the effect, if any, of
[Brown and Boria] on this appeal, including whether,
if the judgment of dismissal is reversed, the habeas
court should be directed on remand ‘to first determine
whether any grounds exist for it to decline to issue the
writ pursuant to Practice Book § 23-24.’ ’’4 The parties
complied with our supplemental briefing order.

The petitioner argued in his supplemental brief that
the record clearly demonstrates that the habeas court
dismissed the underlying operative petition sua sponte
without affording the petitioner proper notice and an
opportunity to be heard. He further argued that, pursu-
ant to the Supreme Court’s holdings in Brown and
Boria, he was entitled, at minimum, to an opportunity
to submit a brief or a written response prior to the
dismissal of his petition, and, therefore, the court’s judg-
ment of dismissal must be reversed. Regarding whether
the habeas court should be instructed on remand to
consider whether to decline to issue the writ pursuant
to Practice Book § 23-24, the petitioner took the posi-
tion that the habeas court should be permitted to screen
the petition in accordance with § 23-24 because the
judgment of dismissal occurred before our Supreme
Court’s decision in Gilchrist v. Commissioner of Cor-
rection, 334 Conn. 548, 223 A.3d 368 (2020), and, there-
fore, fell within the directive of our Supreme Court in
Brown. See Brown v. Commissioner of Correction,
supra, 345 Conn. 17 n.11.

The respondent argued in his supplemental brief that
the decisions in Brown and Boria had no effect on the
present appeal ‘‘because the court is deprived of subject
matter jurisdiction.’’ According to the respondent, the
present appeal should be dismissed as moot because
the petitioner had been ‘‘entirely discharged from cus-
tody, and the courts can no longer grant him any practi-
cal relief.’’ Alternatively, the respondent argued that the
appeal was moot because the petitioner already had
been provided with the remedy mandated by Brown and
Boria by virtue of the present appeal. The respondent
explained: ‘‘[The] [p]etitioner here received the oppor-
tunity to be heard that [Practice Book] § 23-29 requires,
albeit before [the Appellate Court] and not the habeas
court. And he has seized that opportunity by fully pre-
senting his arguments on the merits through a brief and
a reply brief. Further, his claims involve pure questions
of law that are controlled by established precedents
that Brown and Boria neither questioned nor overruled:
his claims relating to [RREC] and parole eligibility are
foreclosed as a matter of law by Perez v. [Commis-
sioner of Correction, 326 Conn. 357, 163 A.3d 597
(2017)] and Petaway v. [Commissioner of Correction,
160 Conn. App. 727, 125 A.3d 1053 (2015), cert. dis-

missed, 324 Conn. 912, 153 A.3d 1288 (2017)].’’ The
respondent argued that any error was harmless and a
remand in this matter is both unnecessary and a waste
of judicial resources. Finally, the respondent took the
position that, if we were to reverse and remand, it is
clear in the present case that the habeas court accepted
the initial petition and issued the writ, and, therefore,
Practice Book § 23-24 no longer applies and ‘‘the habeas
court will instead be required to dismiss the petition
under [Practice Book] § 23-29.’’

Oral argument before this court was scheduled for
January 11, 2023. On December 14, 2022, this court
notified the parties ‘‘to be prepared to address [at oral
argument] whether this appeal is moot because the
petitioner has been released from custody but appears
to be on special parole with an end date of April 16,
2027.’’ At oral argument, in addition to the mootness
arguments raised in his supplemental brief, the respon-
dent asserted a new argument as to why the appeal
was moot. Specifically, the respondent argued that the
petitioner had in fact received all the RREC to which
he claimed he was entitled.

Because they nominally implicate the subject matter
jurisdiction of this court, we first address the respon-
is moot.
dent’s arguments that the current appeal
‘‘Under our well established jurisprudence, [m]ootness
presents a circumstance wherein the issue before the
court has been resolved or had lost its significance
because of a change in the condition of affairs between
the parties. . . . In determining mootness, the disposi-
tive question is whether a successful appeal would ben-
. In other words,
efit the [appellant] in any way.
the ultimate question is whether the determination of
the controversy will result in practical relief to the com-
plainant.
. Mootness implicates [this] court’s sub-
ject matter jurisdiction and is thus a threshold matter
for us to resolve.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

App. 862, 865, 138 A.3d 440 (2016).

.

The respondent first argues that the appeal is moot
because the petitioner has been ‘‘entirely discharged
from custody, and the courts can no longer grant him
any practical relief.’’ The respondent’s argument is
wholly without merit. In Dennis v. Commissioner of
Correction, 189 Conn. App. 608, 614–17, 208 A.3d 282
(2019), this court explained that a petitioner’s claim
pertaining to presentence confinement credits was not
rendered moot by the petitioner’s release from incarcer-
ation to a period of special parole because, if the peti-
tioner were to prevail on his appellate claim, an order
modifying the original sentence to include the credits
sought likely would ‘‘lead to the advancement of his
release from special parole by approximately that same
amount of time.’’ Similarly, here, although the petitioner
is no longer incarcerated, he is serving his seven years

of special parole, which has a current end date of April
16, 2027. The petitioner could still benefit from any
retroactive modification of his definite sentence due to
RREC because it would advance his effective release
date from prison and reduce the amount of time he is
required to spend on special parole. The respondent’s
arguments to the contrary are unavailing.5

The respondent next argues that the appeal is moot
because the petitioner already has received the remedy
mandated by Brown and Boria by virtue of the present
appeal. Although not cloaked in the guise of mootness,
this court rejected a similar argument in Hodge v. Com-
missioner of Correction, 216 Conn. App. 616, 621 n.7,
285 A.3d 1194 (2022), in which the respondent argued
‘‘that Brown and Boria do not require this court to
reverse the judgment of dismissal and to remand the
case to the habeas court because the petitioner has
received an opportunity to be heard regarding the dis-
missal of his claims, which involve pure questions of
law, by virtue of this appeal, and this court is best
positioned to address the merits of the petitioner’s
claims.’’ As this court explained in Hodge, however,
‘‘we construe Brown and Boria to mandate a reversal
of the judgment of dismissal and a remand to the habeas
court. Indeed, in Boria, one of the claims raised by the
petitioner was [an RREC] challenge claim, which the
habeas court dismissed for lack of subject matter juris-
diction pursuant to Practice Book § 23-29 (1).’’ (Empha-
sis added.) Id. In other words, the Supreme Court cer-
tainly did not construe the opportunity for appellate
argument as an adequate substitute for an opportunity
to make an appropriate record before the habeas court.

The final mootness claim of the respondent, made
for the first time at oral argument, is that the petitioner
has already received the benefits of the RREC underly-
ing his petition, and, accordingly, he can be afforded
no additional practical relief. In support of this argu-
ment, the respondent directs us to allegations in the
operative petition that the respondent would have us
construe as admissions by the petitioner that he had
received the credits sought. Reading the petition
broadly, however, we do not construe it as addressing
whether the petitioner has received all of the credits
he claims he is entitled to or only a portion thereof.
Because the respondent has not pointed to anything
else in the factual record before us that supports his
argument, we reject it without prejudice to the respon-
dent raising it on remand to the habeas court along
with the necessary evidentiary support for his position.

Turning finally to the merits of the present appeal,
we agree with the petitioner that our Supreme Court’s
decisions in Brown and Boria govern our resolution of
the present appeal and require a reversal of the habeas
court’s judgment of dismissal. In Brown, our Supreme
Court held ‘‘that [Practice Book] § 23-29 requires the

habeas court to provide prior notice of the court’s inten-
tion to dismiss, on its own motion, a petition that it
deems legally deficient and an opportunity to be heard
on the papers by filing a written response. The habeas
court may, in its discretion, grant oral argument or a
hearing, but one is not mandated.’’ Brown v. Commis-
sioner of Correction, supra, 345 Conn. 4; see also Boria
v. Commissioner of Correction, supra, 345 Conn. 43
(adopting reasoning and conclusions set
forth in
Brown). Here, the court dismissed the petitioner’s
amended appeal without providing him with an oppor-
tunity to submit either a brief or a written response.
Accordingly, the proper remedy is for us to reverse the
court’s dismissal of the operative petition and to remand
the case to the habeas court for further proceedings.
If the habeas court on remand again chooses to consider
dismissal of the operative petition on its own motion
pursuant to Practice Book § 23-29, the court must com-
ply with the procedures set forth in Brown and Boria
by providing the petitioner with prior notice of its pro-
posed basis for dismissal and affording the petitioner
an opportunity to provide a written response.

With respect to whether we should permit the court
another opportunity to consider declining to issue the
writ pursuant to Practice Book § 23-24, we decline to
include this as part of our remand order. The court’s
dismissal in the present case occurred prior to our
Supreme Court’s decision in Gilchrist. In the present
case, however, counsel had been appointed and filed
a revised amended petition on behalf of the petitioner
prior to the habeas court’s dismissal. As this court pre-
viously has clarified in declining to apply footnote 11
of Brown in similar cases, ‘‘[i]t would strain logic to
construe footnote 11 of Brown as advising that we
should direct the habeas court on remand to consider
declining to issue the writ under § 23-24 vis-a` -vis the
amended petition, which was filed after the writ had
been issued. Moreover, affording the habeas court on
remand another opportunity to consider declining to
issue the writ under § 23-24 vis-a` -vis the original habeas
the
petition,
amended petition, which is not an outcome that we
in Brown intended.’’
believe our Supreme Court
(Emphasis omitted.) Hodge v. Commissioner of Correc-
tion, supra, 216 Conn. App. 623–24; see also Villafane
v. Commissioner of Correction, 216 Conn. App. 839,
850–51, 287 A.3d 138 (2022).6 ‘‘Although the present
dismissal occurred prior to Gilchrist, we are not per-
suaded that we should apply the rationale in footnote
11 of Brown to the present case. Unlike in Brown and
Boria, the dismissal in the present case occurred not
merely after the writ had issued but after counsel had
appeared on the petitioner’s behalf and an amended
petition was filed. . . . The fact that an amended peti-
tion had been filed at the time of the court’s dismissal
in this case leads us to conclude that the proper course

in effect, would vitiate the filing of

on remand is not for the court to first consider whether
declining to issue the writ under .
. § 23-24 is war-
ranted.’’ (Footnote omitted.) See Villafane v. Commis-
sioner of Correction, supra, 216 Conn. App. 849–50.

.

The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded

for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

In this opinion the other judges concurred.
1 Practice Book § 23-29 provides in relevant part: ‘‘The judicial authority
may, at any time, upon its own motion or upon motion of the respondent,
dismiss the petition, or any count thereof, if it determines that: (1) the court
lacks jurisdiction; (2) the petition, or a count thereof, fails to state a claim
upon which habeas corpus relief can be granted . . . (5) any other legally
sufficient ground for dismissal of the petition exists.’’

2 On July 1, 2011, General Statutes § 18-98e became effective and author-
ized the Commissioner of Correction, in his discretion, to award a maximum
of five days per month of RREC to reduce a sentence. In 2013, the legislature
amended General Statutes § 54-125a (b) (2), to preclude RREC from being
applied to advance certain incarcerated persons’ parole eligibility dates. See
Public Acts 2013, No. 13-3, § 59.

3 In its decision dismissing the action, the habeas court, citing to Perez
v. Commissioner of Correction, 326 Conn. 357, 163 A.3d 597 (2017), and
Petaway v. Commissioner of Correction, 160 Conn. App. 727, 125 A.3d 1053
(2015), cert. dismissed, 324 Conn. 912, 153 A.3d 1288 (2017), provided the
following reasons for dismissing the petition: ‘‘[T]he present petitioner’s
offense date precedes the enactment of RREC and the effective date of § 18-
98e. Because the petitioner has no right to earn and receive discretionary
RREC, and any changes, alterations and even the total elimination of RREC
at the most can only revert the petitioner to the precise measure of punish-
ment in place at the time of the offense, the court concludes that it lacks
subject matter jurisdiction over the habeas corpus petition and that the
petition fails to state a claim for which habeas corpus relief can be granted.’’
(Emphasis in original.)

.

.

4 In Brown, our Supreme Court had directed this court to remand the
case to the habeas court with direction to first consider whether any grounds
existed for it to decline to issue the writ under Practice Book § 23-24.
Furthermore, in footnote 11 of its opinion, the court in Brown also stated:
‘‘We are aware that there are other cases pending before this court and the
Appellate Court that were decided without the benefit of this court’s decision
in Gilchrist [v. Commissioner of Correction, 334 Conn. 548, 561, 223 A.3d
368 (2020) (analyzing interplay between Practice Book §§ 23-24 and 23-29)].
In cases decided prior to Gilchrist, the most efficient process to
.
resolve those cases is to remand them to the habeas court to determine
first whether grounds exist to decline the issuance of the writ.’’ (Citation
omitted.) Brown v. Commissioner of Correction, supra, 345 Conn. 17 n.11.
5 We note that, in response to an earlier order from this court requesting
simultaneous memoranda addressing why this appeal should not be dis-
missed as moot because the petitioner no longer was incarcerated, the
respondent and the petitioner submitted a joint response arguing that this
case was not moot in light of Dennis v. Commissioner of Correction, supra,
189 Conn. App. 615–16, stating: ‘‘The parties agree that if the petitioner were
to successfully prevail on his claim, the benefit to the petitioner would be
the retroactive modification of his definite sentence so as to incorporate
. thereby advancing his effective release date from prison and
RREC .
reducing the amount of time he is required to spend on special parole.’’ It
is unclear why the respondent elected to change his prior position.

.

6 In Howard v. Commissioner of Correction, 217 Conn. App. 119, 287
A.3d 602 (2022), we expanded upon our reasoning in Hodge and Villafane.
In Howard, although counsel had been appointed for the petitioner, no
amended petition was filed prior to the habeas court dismissing the petition
sua sponte pursuant to Practice Book § 23-29 without providing notice and
an opportunity to be heard. Id., 132. This court concluded that the appoint-
ment of counsel alone provided a compelling reason not to apply footnote
11 of Brown, explaining: ‘‘Our Supreme Court has explained that the purpose
of appointing counsel in habeas actions, following the issuance of the writ,
is so that any potential deficiencies can be addressed in the regular course
after the proceeding has commenced. . . . In the present case, the habeas
court appointed counsel to represent the petitioner, and counsel will have
an opportunity to address any potential deficiencies in the original petition

that he filed in a self-represented capacity. In light of this fact, and the
length of time in which the habeas action has been pending on the court’s
docket, we conclude that permitting the court on remand to decline to issue
the writ pursuant to Practice Book § 23-24 could lead to an unjust outcome
that our Supreme Court would not have intended.’’ (Citation omitted; internal
quotation marks omitted.) Id., 133.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
