Many people have contributed to the history and success of the Appellate Court.  

The Hartford County Bar Association arranged for the printing of our history.  Its 

president, Attorney Steven M. Greenspan, and executive director, Janice L. Ambruso, 

were especially helpful.  The Appellate Court's committee for the celebration consisted 

of Chief Judge William J. Lavery and Judges Anne C. Dranginis, Thomas A. Bishop and 

Antoinette L. Dupont.  The history was written by Judge Dupont, with the assistance of 

Attorney Molly LeVan and Judge Ian McLachlan.  Special thanks go to Attorneys 

Joseph D'Alesio, Jill Begemann and Chief Court Administrator, Judge Joseph H. 

Pellegrino.  The following persons, not mentioned in the history or in the separate lists 

attached to the history, in alphabetical order, are part of the Court's history and deserve 

mention:  Attorneys Michele Angers, Donald Dowling, Frank Drumm, Patricia Friedle, 

Gail Gieson, Louise Hallas, Emily Lebovitz, Kevin Loftus, Jamie Porter, and Barbara 

Rodgers; others include Marie DeCarlo, Cheryl Fraychak-Kanaple, Martine Halle Fusco, 

Robin McShane, Karen Netherton, Deborah Pakalnis, Ellen Prezch, Maggie 

Santangelo, Karen Viklinetz and Florence Weinstein.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
