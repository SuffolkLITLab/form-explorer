JANE DOE v. QUINNIPIAC UNIVERSITY ET AL.
(AC 44938)

Elgo, Moll and Suarez, Js.

Syllabus

Pursuant to the accidental failure of suit statute (§ 52-592 (a)), if any action,
commenced within the time limited by law, has failed one or more
times to be tried on its merits because the action has been otherwise
avoided or defeated for any matter of form, the plaintiff may commence
a new action for the same cause at any time within one year.

Pursuant further to statute (§ 52-584), an action for negligence shall be

brought within two years from the date the injury is sustained.

The plaintiff sought to recover damages from the defendants, a university
and a fraternity, alleging that they were negligent in failing to prevent
certain individual members of the fraternity from sexually assaulting
her on October 27, 2017. The plaintiff had filed a previous action against
the defendants in 2019, serving the fraternity and the university on
October 28 and 31, 2019, respectively. The trial court granted the defen-
dants’ motions to dismiss the 2019 action for lack of personal jurisdiction
because the complaint that the plaintiff filed with the court was never
served on the defendants. The plaintiff then commenced the present
action in 2021 pursuant to the applicable savings statutes (§§ 52-592 and
52-593). The defendants again moved to dismiss the present action on
the ground that the summons and complaint served on them were differ-
ent than the summons and complaint that the plaintiff had filed with
the court, depriving the court of personal jurisdiction over them. The
university additionally argued that, because the 2019 action had not
been commenced within the two year statute of limitations set forth in
§ 52-584, § 52-592 (a) did not apply to save the 2021 action. The trial court
granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss, and the plaintiff appealed
to this court. Held that, because the plaintiff did not challenge on appeal
every independent basis on which the trial court relied in granting the
defendants’ motions to dismiss, the appeal was moot: the plaintiff failed
to challenge the specific ground on which the trial court relied with
respect to the applicability of § 52-592, namely, that her failure to com-
mence the 2019 action within the two year statute of limitations set
forth in § 52-584, precluded § 52-592 from saving the present action, the
plaintiff’s counsel acknowledged at oral argument before this court
that the 2019 action had not been commenced within the statute of
limitations, and, thus, this court was incapable of providing her any
practical relief.

Argued November 14, 2022—officially released March 14, 2023

Procedural History

negligence, and for other relief, brought to the Superior
Court in the judicial district of New Haven, where the
court, Young, J., granted the defendants’ motions to

Opinion

SUAREZ, J. The plaintiff, Jane Doe, brought the
underlying action against the defendants, Alpha Sigma
Phi Fraternity, Inc. (fraternity), and Quinnipiac Univer-
sity (Quinnipiac), pursuant to two savings statutes, Gen-
eral Statutes §§ 52-592 (accidental failure of suit stat-
ute) and 52-593 (wrong defendant statute). In her
complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants were
negligent in that they failed to prevent members of the
fraternity from sexually assaulting her. The plaintiff
appeals from the judgment of the trial court granting the
motions to dismiss filed by the defendants. On review
of the arguments presented on appeal, we interpret
the plaintiff’s claims to be that the trial court erred in
concluding that (1) the process filed with the court
never was served on the defendants, (2) the plaintiff’s
service of process and filing of process violated General
Statutes §§ 52-461 and 52-46a,2 and (3) § 52-5923 does
not save the plaintiff’s action.4 We dismiss the plaintiff’s
appeal as moot.

The following procedural history is relevant to our
resolution of this appeal. The plaintiff served the frater-
nity and Quinnipiac on October 28 and 31, 2019, respec-
tively, with a summons and a complaint in which she
asserted claims against the defendants and certain indi-
vidual members of the fraternity arising from an alleged
sexual assault of the plaintiff by those members of the
fraternity that took place on October 27, 2017. With
respect to the defendants, the plaintiff alleged that they
negligently failed to prevent the sexual assault. Subse-
quently, the plaintiff reached a settlement with the indi-
vidual fraternity members, pursuant to which the plain-
tiff signed a nondisclosure agreement to protect their
identities.

On November 27, 2019, the plaintiff filed with the
court a different summons and complaint (2019 action)
from those served on the defendants in October, 2019.
In the complaint that the plaintiff filed with the court,
fraternity members were no longer
the individual
named as defendants, and the counts that were brought
against them in the original complaint were removed
as a result of the settlement agreement.

The complaint that the plaintiff filed with the court
was never served on the defendants. On this ground,
the fraternity and Quinnipiac, on December 10, 2019,
and January 10, 2020, respectively, filed motions to dis-
miss the actions against them for lack of personal juris-
diction. On April 27, 2020, the court granted both of
the defendants’ motions to dismiss.

On March 1, 2021, the plaintiff filed, inter alia, a sum-
mons and complaint (2021 action) naming the fraternity
and Quinnipiac as defendants. The complaint, dated
February 17, 2021, stated that it was ‘‘brought pursuant
to [Connecticut’s saving statutes] . . . § 52-592—acci-

dental failure of suit, allowance of a new action, [and]
. . . § 52-5935—action against wrong defendant, allow-
ance of new action.’’ (Footnote added.) In her 2021
complaint, the plaintiff brought the same claims against
the fraternity and Quinnipiac as she had in the 2019
action. The summons and complaint filed with the court
contained a return date of March 16, 2021. Process was
then served on the fraternity and Quinnipiac on March
10 and 11, 2021, respectively.

Quinnipiac and the fraternity, on April 23 and 26,
2021, respectively, filed motions to dismiss the 2021
action. In their memoranda in support of their motions
to dismiss, both defendants asserted that, in several
respects, the summons and complaint served on them
were different from the summons and complaint that
the plaintiff had filed with the court, including having
different return dates. Given that the defendants were
not served with the same process that was filed with
the court, they argued that the plaintiff failed to comply
with §§ 52-46 and 52-46a, depriving the court of personal
jurisdiction over them. The defendants further argued
that the plaintiff could not thereafter amend the return
date in an attempt to comply with §§ 52-46 and 52-46a.
The fraternity, in its memorandum in support of its
motion to dismiss, also argued that § 52-592 did not
apply because the 2019 action was not dismissed ‘‘for
any matter of form’’; General Statutes § 52-592; rather,
the fraternity argued, it was dismissed because the
plaintiff ‘‘chose not to file or return the original writ to
court .
.’’ (Emphasis added.) Additionally, the fra-
ternity argued that, because the court had not dismissed
the 2019 action for the plaintiff’s failure to name the
correct defendant, § 52-593 did not apply to the 2021
action.

.

.

On June 11, 2021, the plaintiff responded by filing a
motion to amend the return date from March 16, 2021,
to March 23, 2021. On June 14, 2021, the plaintiff filed
objections to the motions to dismiss with accompanying
memoranda of law.

On June 22, 2021, Quinnipiac filed a supplemental
memorandum of law in support of its motion to dismiss.
Quinnipiac argued, consistent with the fraternity’s argu-
ment, that the plaintiff had willingly abandoned the
2019 action, thereby making § 52-592 inapplicable to
the 2021 action. Quinnipiac further asserted that the
2019 action was not commenced within the relevant
statute of limitations, namely, General Statutes § 52-
584,6 and that, because § 52-592 applies only to eligible,
previously failed actions ‘‘commenced within the time
limited by law,’’ § 52-592 did not apply to the 2021
action.

Quinnipiac filed a reply to the plaintiff’s objection to
its motion to dismiss on June 28, 2021. On July 27, 2021,
the court held a hearing on the motions to dismiss.

.

. occurred on October 27, 2017.

On August 24, 2021, the court issued a memorandum
of decision granting the defendants’ motions to dismiss.
In its memorandum of decision, the court first con-
cluded that the summons and complaint that were filed
with the court in the 2021 action were not identical to
the summons and complaint served on the defendants
and, accordingly, it lacked personal jurisdiction over
the defendants. Second, the court reasoned that the
plaintiff’s service of process in the 2021 action did not
comply with § 52-46 or § 52-46a and that amending the
return date would not remedy the noncompliance, fur-
ther depriving the court of personal jurisdiction over
the defendants. Third, the court concluded that the
‘‘alleged incident and corresponding acts of negligence
.
. Assuming
arguendo that there was identical service of the filed
process and complaint upon the defendants, that ser-
vice was not made until March 10 [and] 11, 2021, by
the marshal, long after the expiration of the statute of
limitations, depriving the court of jurisdiction.’’ Relat-
edly, the court concluded that the plaintiff’s reliance
on § 52-592 was misplaced because § 52-592 applies
only to save eligible, previously failed actions ‘‘com-
menced within the time limited by law . . . .’’ (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) The court concluded that the
2019 action did not commence until after the relevant
statute of limitations, § 52-584, had expired and, there-
fore, the 2021 action could not be saved under § 52-
592. Moreover, the court concluded that the plaintiff’s
reliance on § 52-593 was misplaced because ‘‘[t]he
[2019] action was not dismissed for failure to name the
right defendant.’’ This appeal followed.

.

.

In this appeal, the plaintiff principally claims that the
trial court erred in dismissing the 2021 action on the
grounds that (1) the process filed with the court was
never served on the defendants and (2) the process served
on the defendants was not, and could not have been,
timely returned to the court. Finally, the plaintiff curso-
rily claims that the court erred by failing to conclude
that the 2021 action is saved under § 52-592, noting that
§ 52-592 is ‘‘remedial in nature and therefore warrants
broad construction.’’ (Internal quotation marks omit-
ted.) The plaintiff, however, does not challenge one of
the independent grounds on which the court dismissed
the 2021 action, namely, that the plaintiff’s failure to
commence the 2019 action within the relevant statute
of limitations precludes § 52-592 from applying to the
2021 action.7

Because the plaintiff does not challenge every inde-
pendent basis on which the court granted the defen-
dants’ motions to dismiss, we consider whether the
present appeal is moot.8 ‘‘Mootness is a question of
justiciability that must be determined as a threshold
matter because it implicates [this] court’s subject mat-
. A determination regarding . . .
ter jurisdiction . . .

[this court’s] subject matter jurisdiction is a question
of law . . . [and, therefore] our review is plenary. . . .
[I]t is not the province of appellate courts to decide
moot questions, disconnected from the granting of
actual relief or from the determination of which no

.
practical relief can follow.
ness, the dispositive question is whether a successful
appeal would benefit the plaintiff or defendant in any
way. . . .

.

‘‘Where an appellant fails to challenge all bases for
a trial court’s adverse ruling on [her] claim, even if this
court were to agree with the appellant on the issues
that [she] does raise, we still would not be able to
provide [her] any relief in light of the binding adverse
finding[s] [not raised] with respect to those claims. . . .
Therefore, when an appellant challenges a trial court’s
adverse ruling, but does not challenge all independent
bases for that ruling, the appeal is moot.’’ (Citation
omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Bongiorno
v. J & G Realty, LLC, 211 Conn. App. 311, 322, 272 A.3d
700 (2022).

As stated previously in this opinion, the plaintiff does
not challenge the specific ground on which the court
concluded that § 52-592 did not apply to save the other-
wise time barred 2021 action, namely, her failure to
commence the 2019 action within the applicable statute
of limitations. Indeed, counsel for the plaintiff acknowl-
edged at oral argument before this court that the 2019
action was not commenced within the statute of limita-
tions. In particular, although the defendants’ alleged
negligence occurred on or before October 27, 2017, they
were not served with the summons and complaint in
the 2019 action until October 28, 2019, with respect to
the fraternity, and October 31, 2019, with respect to
Quinnipiac, outside of the two year statute of limitations
prescribed in § 52-584. To invoke the court’s jurisdic-
tion, it was incumbent on the plaintiff to demonstrate
that one or both of the savings statutes on which she
relied applied. Thus, even if we were to agree with the
plaintiff with respect to the other claims that she raises
on appeal, her failure to challenge the specific ground
on which the court relied with respect to the applicabil-
ity of § 52-592 renders us incapable of providing her
any practical relief. See, e.g., State v. Carter, 194 Conn.
App. 202, 203, 208, 220 A.3d 882 (2019) (defendant’s
failure to challenge all independent bases for court’s
dismissal of motion to set aside judgment of conviction
rendered appeal moot); see also, e.g., State v. Lester,
324 Conn. 519, 527–28, 153 A.3d 647 (2017) (defendant’s
appeal claiming that court improperly applied rape
shield statute when it excluded evidence was moot
for failure to challenge all independent bases for trial
court’s exclusion of evidence). Accordingly, the appeal
is moot.

The appeal is dismissed.

In this opinion the other judges concurred.
1 General Statutes § 52-46 provides in relevant part: ‘‘Civil process .

.
if returnable to the Superior Court, at least twelve

shall be served .
days, inclusive, before [the day of the sitting of the court].’’

.

.

.

.

.

. shall be returned .

2 General Statutes § 52-46a provides in relevant part: ‘‘Process in civil
actions .
if returnable to the Superior Court,
.
except process in summary process actions and petitions for parentage and
support, to the clerk of such court at least six days before the return day.’’
3 General Statutes § 52-592 provides in relevant part: ‘‘(a) If any action,
commenced within the time limited by law, has failed one or more times
to be tried on its merits because of insufficient service or return of the writ
due to unavoidable accident or the default or neglect of the officer to whom
it was committed, or because the action has been dismissed for want of
jurisdiction, or the action has been otherwise avoided or defeated by the
death of a party or for any matter of form . . . the plaintiff . . . may com-
mence a new action .
. for the same cause at any time within one year
after the determination of the original action or after the reversal of the
judgment.’’

.

4 We note that, in her statement of issues, the plaintiff characterized the
claims raised on appeal as follows: ‘‘(1) Whether the trial court was correct
in entering dismissal of the plaintiff’s claims as detailed in the court’s memo-
randum of decision on August 24, 2021, and/or as the issue has been briefed
by the parties.

‘‘(2) Any issues that are identified after a review of the record.’’
We have reframed the claims in this appeal to more accurately reflect
the arguments set forth in the body of the plaintiff’s brief. See, e.g., Festa
v. Board of Education, 145 Conn. App. 103, 106 n.1, 73 A.3d 904, cert. denied,
310 Conn. 934, 79 A.3d 888 (2013).

5 General Statutes § 52-593 provides in relevant part: ‘‘When a plaintiff in
any civil action has failed to obtain judgment by reason of failure to name
the right person as defendant therein, the plaintiff may bring a new action
and the statute of limitations shall not be a bar thereto if service of process
in the new action is made within one year after the termination of the
original action. . . .’’ (Emphasis added.)

6 General Statutes § 52-584 provides in relevant part: ‘‘No action to recover
damages for injury to the person . . . caused by negligence, or by reckless
. shall be brought but within two years from
or wanton misconduct .
the date when the injury is first sustained or discovered . . . .’’ (Empha-
sis added.)

.

7 The plaintiff also does not challenge the trial court’s conclusion that
§ 52-593 does not apply because the 2019 action was not dismissed for
failure to name the right defendant.

.

. namely, that .

8 Following oral argument in this appeal, this court ordered the parties
to file supplemental briefs addressing ‘‘whether this appeal should be dis-
missed as moot in light of the fact that the plaintiff has failed to challenge
on appeal an independent basis for the trial court’s decision to grant the
defendants’ motions to dismiss .
. § 52-592 did not
apply because the underlying action the plaintiff sought to revive was not
timely commenced within the relevant statute of limitations.’’ The parties
complied with our supplemental briefing order and we have considered
their arguments in our resolution of the appeal. The defendants argue that
the appeal should be dismissed as moot. The plaintiff argues that the appeal
is not moot. We note that, in her supplemental brief, the plaintiff fails to
squarely address the effect of the court’s conclusion in its memorandum of
decision that § 52-592 does not apply to the 2021 action because the process
that was served on the defendants in connection with the 2019 action did
not commence the 2019 action within the relevant statute of limitations.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
