Our Role in Family Civil Court

Case Management Services:

The role of Family Services is to assist the Court 
and clients in the timely and fair resolution of 
family and interpersonal conflicts through a 
comprehensive program of alternative dispute 
resolution services, case management, evaluation 
and education. With this purpose in mind the 
Family Relations Counselors will utilize the Family 
Civil Intake Screen to identify the appropriate 
service to assist your family.

Alternative Dispute Resolutions 
Services:

•   Pre-trial Settlement Negotiations – In all 

Judicial Districts, Family Relations Counselors 
conduct pre-trial and final judgment settlement 
conferences with attorneys and litigants in 
conjunction with their attendance at Family Short 
Calendar and other Family Civil Court dockets.

•   Mediation – Family Relations Counselors 

mediate custody and access disputes for up to 
three 2-hour sessions. These efforts are geared 
toward assisting parents in resolving differences 
in a self-determining, non-coercive, and 
confidential manner. 

•   Conflict Resolution Conference – This is 
a confidential, directive process utilizing 
negotiation and mediation techniques to resolve 
the primary issues of custody and access. Parents 
and attorneys participate in the conferences and 
information from professional sources may be 
included. The Family Relations Counselor may 
offer recommendations to the parents at the 
conclusion of the process if the parties are unable 
to resolve their dispute. These recommendations 
are not provided to the Court.

•   General Case Management – A Family 

Relations Counselor will be assigned distinct 
responsibilities to assist parties in resolving their 
parenting issues with a report back to the Court. 
Some components include gathering specific 
information regarding the family, monitoring 
compliance with court orders, facilitating 
settlement conferences to develop parenting 
plans, conducting home visits, or completing 
other court-ordered tasks.

•   Intensive Case Management – This service 
offers litigants in the early stages of post 
judgement court involvement the opportunity 
to enhance collaboration between the parents 
and formulate mutual decisions regarding the 
well-being/care of their children. The role of the 
Family Relations Counselor is to work with the 
parents as needed to reduce conflict, offer skills 
for enhanced communication, reinforce positive 
parenting, and report progress to the Court.

Evaluative Services:

•   Issue-Focused Evaluation – This is a non-
confidential process of assessing a limited 
issue impacting a family and/or parenting plan. 
The goal of an Issue-Focused Evaluation is to 
explore the defined parenting dispute, gather 
information regarding only this issue and provide 
a recommendation to the parents and the Court. 
This evaluation format is limited in scope, 
involvement, and duration.

•   Comprehensive Evaluation – This is an in-

depth, non-confidential assessment of the family 
system by the Family Relations Counselor. 
The information gathered by the counselor, 
the assessment of the family, and the resulting 
recommended parenting plan is shared with the 
parents and attorneys. This recommendation 

may be used to form the basis of an agreement. 
At the conclusion of the process, a report with 
recommendations is filed with the Court.

Education:

•   Parent Education Program (PEP) – Family 

Services contracts with community and private 
agencies throughout the state to provide this 
program. The PEP is a six-hour statutorily-
mandated, psycho-educational course for 
separating and divorcing parents that provides 
information about the impact of family re-
structuring on children. 

Our Role In Criminal Court

The role of Family Services is to assist the Court 
and clients in the timely and fair disposition 
of family violence criminal cases through a 
comprehensive assessment and intervention plan 
to prevent, reduce, and stop the frequency and 
severity of violence against victim/complainants.

•   Family Violence Arraignment Proceedings –  

Family Relations Counselors conduct pre-
arraignment family violence intake assessments 
and screen all family violence arraignment 
cases. This process includes:

–  Collecting demographic information

–  Reviewing criminal histories

–  Reviewing the Protective Order Registry

–  Screening for handguns and firearms 

–  Screening for risk of continued violence

–  Interviewing the defendant and victim 

–   Coordinating with Family Violence Victim 

Advocates

– Recommending the level of Protective Orders

– Recommending treatment/services

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
