INSTRUCTIONS FOR GENERAL TESTIMONY 

 
PURPOSE OF THE FORM: 
 
The General Testimony provides a framework for stating the detailed information and evidence necessary to support the action 
requested in the Uniform Support Petition.  The sections in the General Testimony may or may not apply to all cases.  Before 
 
completing the form, carefully consider the status of the individual petitioner completing the testimony and his/her relationship to the 
 
respondent, the relief you plan to request in the petition, and other case characteristics to determine what information should be 
 
provided. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
These instructions should be provided to the petitioner as part of the form. 

 

THIS FORM CONTAINS SENSITIVE INFORMATION – DO NOT FILE THIS FORM IN A PUBLIC ACCESS FILE. 

 

 

 

 

 

 
This form includes information that may pose a significant risk to an individual if made available in a public forum or inappropriately 
 
 
disclosed.  This form may be filed with the petition or pleading, but should not be filed or included in a record available to the general 
public.  The information on this form may be disclosed to the parties in the case unless accompanied by a nondisclosure 
 
finding/affidavit. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
If you are not the intended recipient, you are hereby notified that any use, disclosure, distribution, or copying of this form or its 
  
contents is strictly prohibited. 

 

 

 

 
Italicized text that appears within a “box” refers to policy or provides additional information. 

 

 

 

 

NOTE:  All section headings contain a checkbox to be used when additional comments/remarks are appropriate.  These 
 
  
comments/remarks should be placed in section IX (Other Pertinent Information). 

  

 

 

 

 

 
HEADING/CAPTION: 

 
• Identify the petitioner and respondent by full legal name (first, middle, last, suffix) and, if applicable, include the name of the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

tribe with which the petitioner and/or respondent is/are affiliated.

 

 

 

 
• Identify if the petitioner is the obligee or the obligor.  This will clarify who is submitting the petition.
 
 
 
 
• Identify if the respondent is the obligee or the obligor.
 
• Check  the  appropriate  box  to  identify  the  type  of  case:  TANF,  IV-E  foster  care,  Medicaid  only,  former  assistance,  never
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance, or non-IV-D.
 

  

 

 
 

TANF means the obligee’s family is currently receiving IV-A cash payments.  A Medicaid only case is a case in 
 
which the obligee’s family receives Medicaid but does not receive TANF.  A former assistance case might be a case 
 
for state arrears only or for a family that previously received TANF, but is not doing so at this time. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
• In the appropriate spaces, if applicable and known, enter the responding jurisdiction’s IV-D case identifier and tribunal number.
 

 

 

 

  

The responding jurisdiction is the jurisdiction that is working the case at the request of the initiating jurisdiction.
Under “IV-D case identifier,” enter the number/identifier identical to the one submitted on the Federal Case Registry, 
 
 
which is a left-justified up to 15-character alphanumeric field, allowing all characters except asterisk and backslash, 
 
and with all characters in uppercase.  Under “tribunal number”, you may enter the docket number, cause number, or 
 
 
any other appropriate reference number that the responding tribunal may use to identify the case, if known. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
• In the appropriate spaces, enter the initiating jurisdiction’s IV-D case identifier, and, if applicable, tribunal number.
 

 

 

The initiating jurisdiction is the jurisdiction that referred the case to the responding jurisdiction for services.  Under 
 
“IV-D case identifier,” enter the number/identifier identical to the one submitted on the Federal Case Registry, which 
is a left-justified up to 15-character alphanumeric field, allowing all characters except asterisk and backslash, and 
with all characters in uppercase.  Under “tribunal number”, you may enter the docket number, cause number, or any 
 
  
other appropriate reference number which the initiating tribunal has assigned to the case.

In the “NOTE” section, check any of the following that apply: 
 
 
• Nondisclosure  Finding/Affidavit  attached  - If  there  is  a  finding  prohibiting  disclosure  of  a  party’s  or 
 
 
 
child(ren)’s address/identifying information or an affidavit alleging that disclosure of such information would result in risk of 
harm, check the box for “Nondisclosure Finding/Affidavit attached” and attach a copy of the finding/affidavit in accordance 
 
with section 312 of UIFSA.  If there is a finding/affidavit prohibiting disclosure, the information must be sealed and may not 
 
be disclosed to the other party or the public.  You may provide the address of the IV-D agency as a substitute address for 
 
the protected party.  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

UIFSA requires that the petition or accompanying documents include certain identifying information regarding the 
parties and child(ren) (e.g., residential address, Social Security Number) unless a party alleges in an affidavit or a 
pleading under oath that the health, safety, or liberty of a party or child would be jeopardized by disclosure of such 
information.  In that event, the information must be sealed. 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If a jurisdiction has reason to believe that information should not be released because of safety concerns, it should 
ensure that there is a nondisclosure finding or an allegation in an affidavit or pleading that disclosure of identifying 
 
information would result in a risk of harm, as provided under section 312 of UIFSA.  In addition to identifying 
information included on this form, it may be appropriate to submit certain financial information under seal. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

• This form sent through EDE - Check if this form was sent through the Electronic Document Exchange (EDE). 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

CSENet and EDE transactions are the recommended methods for making requests or sending information to another 
 
state.  If CSENet is not listed as an option on the form, then it cannot be used to convey any of the requests or 
 
information provided on the form.  

 

 

 

 

 
Supporting documentation should be sent through EDE, whenever possible. 

 

•  Identify who is providing the testimony.  Fill in the full legal name (first, middle, last, suffix) of the individual providing the 
 

 

 

 

 
testimony and signing the form under penalty of perjury. 

 

 

 
Note that testimony is given under penalty of perjury.

currently does not have health care coverage, skip to item 4.  
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Item 1:  Check the appropriate box to indicate the source of the petitioner’s health care coverage.  If health care coverage is 
 
 
provided through Medicaid, skip to item 4.  If health care coverage is provided through TRICARE or Indian Health Service,

is paid bi-weekly, the monthly cost is calculated by multiplying the bi-weekly cost by 26 and dividing by 12. If the premium is paid 
 
semi-monthly, the monthly cost is calculated by multiplying the semi-monthly cost by 2.  If the premium is paid quarterly, the 
monthly cost is calculated by dividing the quarterly cost by 3. If the premium is paid annually, the monthly cost is calculated by 
 
 
 
 
dividing the annual cost by 12.

Item 1:  Check the appropriate box to indicate the source of the respondent’s health care coverage.  If health care coverage is 
 
provided through Medicaid skip to item 4.  If health care coverage is provided through TRICARE or Indian Health Service, 
 
indicate which one and skip to part D.  Otherwise, select whether the coverage is provided through an employer or an individual 
 
policy, which includes policies obtained through the federal or a state exchange/marketplace.  Check “Other person” if someone 
 
 
other than the respondent is providing the health care coverage and enter that person’s name and relationship to the 
respondent, for example, spouse or parent. 
 
 
Item 2:  In the appropriate spaces, enter the name and address of the health care provider through which the respondent is

When establishing a support order, the law of the responding jurisdiction determines whether and how past and 
ongoing medical expenses are included in the support order.  For example, some states consider only expenses 
 
above a threshold amount or those costs that are for specific ongoing costs.  The expenses in parts D through F 
 
may not be reimbursable or allowed in all jurisdictions.

have special needs or extraordinary medical expenses not covered by insurance.  This includes special medical needs, medical 
 
equipment, counseling, special schooling, etc.  If yes, provide information in section IX (Other Pertinent Information) about the 
child(ren) involved, the type(s) of need/expense, and the related costs.  Attach documentation of the special medical need, such as a 
 
doctor’s statement.  If special needs are indicated, explain in detail any agreement between the petitioner and respondent to cover 
 
these costs, including agreements that are verbal, written, or part of any court or administrative order.  If you do not know, check 
 
 
“Unknown.” 
 

 
 

  

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Part E - Check the appropriate box to indicate whether the petitioner is requesting reimbursement from the respondent for any 
 
medical expenses paid.  If yes, enter the balance and the date accrued.  Provide the date, type of expense (such as doctor visit, 
 
prescriptions), and cost in section IX (Other Pertinent Information). 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Part F - Check the appropriate box to indicate whether the petitioner is asking the tribunal to order the respondent to share the cost of 
 
an ongoing medical expense being paid by the petitioner and not covered by insurance, such as dental services co-payments and 
allergy shots.  If yes, enter the type of medical expense and the amount and frequency of the cost.  Provide additional information in 
 
 
section IX (Other Pertinent Information) about the child(ren) involved and attach supporting documentation of the need and expense. 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section VI.  Additional Information for Child Support Calculation: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This information may be used by the responding tribunal to establish a support order or modify an existing one.  State child support 
 
guidelines vary in whether the information is relevant to the calculation.  Complete the appropriate section depending on the action 
 
 
sought. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

Part A - Establishment: 
 

 

Complete this section if the petitioner is requesting the responding tribunal to set a current support obligation for the child(ren) listed in 
section IV and no support order exists. 
 

 

 

 

 

 
Some state child support guidelines consider the amount of time the child(ren) spend with the obligor.  Generally, 
 
 
states use the number of overnights the child(ren) spends with the obligated parent to calculate any applicable 
 
adjustment/deviation.  States may require a court order or binding separation agreement indicating 
custody/parenting time terms.  Items 1-3 request information that may be relevant to the responding tribunal. 
 

   

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  
 

Item 1:  Check the appropriate box to indicate whether a custody/parenting time order exists.  If yes, provide the issuing tribunal 
 
number and the date the order was issued.  A copy of the custody/parenting time order must be attached to the General 
 
Testimony. 
 
Item 2:  If a custody/parenting time order does not exist, check the appropriate box to indicate whether there is a written 
agreement between the parties on custody/parenting time.  If yes, a copy of the agreement must be attached to the General 
 
  
Testimony. 
 
Item 3:  Indicate how many overnights the child(ren) have spent with the obligee and with the obligor in the 12 months prior to 
filing this action or since separation, whichever is the shorter period. 
  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The award of support for a period of time prior to the date of filing the support petition is not required under federal 
 
law but may be appropriate in accordance with state law.  Not all states have authority to establish support orders 
 
  
for prior periods.  However, the period of time the family received TANF benefits may be a relevant factor in setting 
 
an award for a prior period; this section provides space for this information. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

When establishing an order, a state must use its child support guidelines as a rebuttable presumption.  States may 
 
establish child support awards covering a prior period, but such awards must be based on guidelines and take into 
 
consideration the obligor’s earnings and income during the prior period. 
 

  

 

 

Item 4:  Check the appropriate box to indicate whether child support is sought for a period prior to the date the Uniform Support 
 
Petition was signed.  If yes, complete the following questions and section VIII (Financial Information): 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

Item a:  Provide the date from which the obligee seeks retroactive support, for example, the date of birth of the child, or the 
 
date the parties separated. 
Item b:  Check the appropriate box to indicate whether the child(ren) resided with the obligor during any period for which 
 
retroactive support is sought beyond the time specified in a custody/parenting time order or agreement.  If yes, detail the 
additional time.  For example, if there is no order or agreement and the child spent 6 months of the past year residing with the 
 
obligor, report that information here and in section IX (Other Pertinent Information) if additional space is needed. 
Item c:  Check the appropriate box to indicate whether the obligor provided payments directly to the obligee for the 
 
child(ren)’s support.  If yes, provide an affidavit of payments showing those direct support payments. 
 
Item d:  Check the appropriate box to indicate whether public assistance was paid for the child(ren) during the period 
 
retroactive support is sought.  If yes, check the appropriate box(es) and provide the period of the public assistance benefit 
 
 
and the state.  If there are multiple dates, explain and include documentation in section IX (Other Pertinent Information).

This information is used to justify the support arrears (past-due support), if any, claimed in the petition. 
 
Part A - Check the appropriate box to indicate whether there is an order for divorce or legal separation involving the children 
 
in this action.  If the answer is yes, provide a copy of the order.

made by military allotment that did not go through the SDU. 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Part C - Check the appropriate box to indicate whether the support order requires the obligor to make additional payments directly to 
 
the obligee, child care provider or health care provider; a private school for tuition, books or fees; or the obligee for a share of the 
 
 
 
health insurance premium or medical expense.  If the answer is yes, complete part D below. 
 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Part D - Check the appropriate box to indicate whether the obligor has made any direct payments pursuant to the order noted in part 
 
C.  If payments have been made, attach an affidavit of payments that lists the dates, amounts, and purpose of such payments, as well

This section is used to obtain the petitioner’s financial information needed to apply the responding jurisdiction’s child support guidelines 
 
to determine the appropriate amount of support.  If the petitioner is a caretaker without legal custody of the child(ren), this section does 
 
 
 
not need to be filled out. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is important to disclose all the information.  Failure to disclose information may seriously affect the legal proceedings

Item a:  “Mandatory retirement” means amounts that are required by law to be withheld or paid directly from a party’s income 
and deposited in a retirement account or fund. 
 
Item b:  “Nonmandatory retirement” means amounts that are voluntarily withheld or paid directly from a party’s income and 
 
deposited in a retirement account or fund. 
 
Item c:  “Medical insurance” means medical insurance premiums withheld or paid from a party’s income. 
 
Item d:  “Union dues” means mandatory union dues that are withheld or paid directly from a party’s income. 
 
Item e:  “Other (specify)” includes all other deductions, such as support obligations listed in section I.D or II.D; state 
 
unemployment insurance tax and disability insurance premiums, where applicable; and certain employment-related 
expenses that are deducted directly from income.  Include an explanation in the space provided. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Item 5:  Enter the individual petitioner’s gross income for the prior year. 
 

 

 

 

Section IX.  Other Pertinent Information: 

  

 

 

 

 

In this section, provide additional information that may be useful to the responding jurisdiction.  For example, if there are multiple 
periods of public assistance, you may use this section to provide that information.  If the petitioner is an obligee caretaker, you may use 
this section to provide financial information about the non-party parent.  Additional information may also include information about a 
 
party’s real estate, bank accounts, IRA accounts, or money market accounts.  If the additional information is related to a previous 
 
section, identify the section, part, and item number as appropriate.  Check “Continued on attached sheet(s), incorporated by 
 
reference.” if you have more information than will fit into the space provided. 
 

 
  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section X.  Attached and Incorporated by Reference: 
 

  

 

Check the appropriate box(es) to indicate all documents attached.  If a support order was not issued by the responding jurisdiction, 
  
you will generally need to attach one certified copy and one copy.  If the order was issued by the responding jurisdiction, you may 
  
 
 
not need to include a copy of the order, but it can be helpful to the responding jurisdiction. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

Check “Additional attached document(s), incorporated by reference.” for documents other than those listed. 
 

 

 
Section XI.  Declaration: 
 

 

The person providing the testimony – the individual petitioner or agency or tribunal representative – must sign under penalty of perjury 
 
and date the General Testimony at the bottom of the page.  By this signature, the individual or agency or tribunal representative is 
 
 
confirming that the information and facts provided in the testimony and all attached documents are true to the best of his/her 
knowledge and belief.  An agency or tribunal representative (such as a Foster Care or IV-D agency worker) may complete and sign the 
form if no parent or custodian is available or cooperative.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
