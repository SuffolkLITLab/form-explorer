      <pre>What Happens  
When You  
Go To Small  
Claims Court

The Small Claims Court has simpler 
rules than the regular civil court with 
forms and procedures designed to 
be more easily understood by people 
without legal training. However, you 
may still be uncertain about what 
will happen on the day you come to 
the Court. This brochure will answer 
questions on what happens when 
you come to Small Claims Court. For 
more information go to http://www.
jud.ct.gov/faq/smallclaims.html. 

Is there a dress code or any 
requirements about what I can  
wear to Court?

The Court is a formal setting so you should 
dress appropriately. For example, you should 
probably not wear t-shirts or jeans with holes 
in them, tank tops, halter tops, or revealing 
clothing. 

Can I bring my children to Court?

Try not to bring your children to court. The 
day can be long for young children, and if 
they become noisy, it will distract people in 
the courtroom, interrupt the proceedings, and 
make it hard to hear.

What time should I come to  
the courthouse?

You will want to be at the courthouse at least 
15 minutes before the time of your hearing, 
which is in the Notice of Hearing. For 

example, if the time in the notice is 9:30 AM, 
you should be at the courthouse no later than 
9:15 AM. You must enter the courthouse through 
a metal detector, so it may take extra time to 
enter the building.

Where can I park?

Some courthouses have parking, but many 
do not. You may need to park in a nearby 
lot or garage or find on-street parking. For 
information, please call the Clerk’s Office or 
check the website: http://www.jud.ct.gov/
directory/court_directions.htm. 

What will happen when I get to  
the courthouse?

The courthouse doors open at 8:30 AM. 
Please be prepared to wait briefly in a line at 
the entrance. When you enter the courthouse, 
you will have to go through a metal detector. 
The metal detector is operated by the Judicial 
Marshals, who provide security for the 
courthouse. 

Any metal items can set off the metal detector. 
You will have to empty your pockets of all 
metal objects before walking through the metal 
detector, and anything you bring with you will 
be scanned. If your belt has a large metal buckle 
or your jacket has large metal buttons or zippers, 
for example, you may be asked to take them 
off. Things that could be used as a weapon (for 
example, a pocket knife) will be taken from you 
Ü
so please do not bring them with you. 

The Judicial Branch of the State of Connecticut complies 
with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). If you 
need a reasonable accommodation, in accordance with 
the ADA, contact a Judicial Branch employee or an ADA 
contact person listed at www.jud.ct.gov/ada/.

JDP-CV-118 (New 3/12)

How long will I be at the Court?

What is a Magistrate?

How long you will be at court depends on the 
number of cases in the court that day, how 
long the other hearings take, or whether you 
make an agreement with the other side. You 
should plan on being at the court for the whole 
day. The court staff will try to get you out as 
quickly as possible. 

Do I need a Lawyer/Attorney?

The Small Claims Court has been set up to 
allow you to handle your own case from start 
to finish. However, attorneys are allowed in 
the Small Claims Court. If you decide that you 
want a lawyer, you will have to hire one. The 
court will not appoint a lawyer for you. 

Where do I go once I get into  
the courthouse?

Once you have gone through the metal 
detector, look for signs saying where the Small 
Claims Court will be. If you don’t see a sign, 
ask a Marshal or someone in the Clerk’s Office 
where the Small Claims Court is.

If court has not started when you enter the 
courtroom, go to the clerk and show the clerk 
the notice you received or tell the clerk your 
name or the name of your case. If you come 
into court late, let the Magistrate or the Clerk 
know you are there when there is a break 
between cases. If you do not let them know 
you are in court, you may lose your case 
because no one knew you were there.

A magistrate is an attorney who is appointed 
to hear and decide small claims cases. Some 
court locations may have attorneys who 
have volunteered to act as hearing officers 
(commissioners) to assist the court in hearing 
small claims cases. These volunteer attorneys 
have been approved by the court and, if both 
you and the other party agree, your case may be 
decided by a hearing officer.

What do I need to do after I tell the 
clerk I am in the courtroom?

When court begins, the Magistrate will sit 
behind the bench and will read the list of cases 
to be heard that day. When you hear the name of 
your case, stand up and let the Magistrate know 
that you are there. If you do not hear the name of 
your case, tell the Magistrate when he or she is 
finished reading the list.

What are the basic rules of  
courtroom conduct?

Before you enter the courtroom, please:

•  Turn off any cell phone, beeper, and pager you 

may have

•  Throw away all food, drinks and gum

•  Take off any hat you are wearing unless you 

wear it for religious reasons 

When you are in the courtroom, please:

•  Stay in the courtroom quietly until it is your 

turn to speak

•  Stand when the magistrate enters or leaves the 
courtroom and when you are speaking with the 
magistrate

•  Refer to the Magistrate as “Magistrate” or 

•  Be sure to answer out loud when you are asked 

•  Do not interrupt other people when they are 

“your honor.”

any questions.

speaking.

What should I bring with me to court 
on the day of my hearing?

On the day of your hearing, unless you and the 
other party make an agreement, you will have a 
trial on that date. Before you come to court, you 
may want to write some notes about what you 
want to tell the court about your case. You will 
also want to have:

•  Your notice of hearing;

•  Any papers that support your claim, such as 
pictures, canceled checks, letters, paid bills, 
receipts, damage estimates, or agreements. 
Bring copies for the other party and the 
Magistrate. 

Also, if other people saw what happened 
or have information that will support your 
claim (witnesses), bring them with you on 
the date of your hearing. You may want to 
have specific questions for those people 
(your witnesses). The Magistrate or hearing 
officer will swear in all the witnesses before 
anyone asks questions.

When do I find out the  
Magistrate’s decision?

The Magistrate might give the decision from 
the bench. If not, the court will send you a 
notice telling you the decision.

What if I don’t agree with the 
Magistrate’s decision?

The Magistrate’s decision is final and 
you cannot appeal a Small Claims Court 
decision. 

Does the court collect my money?

No, but you may go to the Clerk’s Office or 
the Court Service Center for help with forms 
and ways to collect your money.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
