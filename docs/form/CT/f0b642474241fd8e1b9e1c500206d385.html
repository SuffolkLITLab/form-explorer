EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY PLAN 
EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2015 – DECEMBER 31, 2016 
 
________________________________________________________________________ 
 
POLICY STATEMENT OF COMMITMENT 

   

It is hereby reaffirmed that it is the policy of the Judicial Branch of the State of 
Connecticut to provide equal employment opportunity to all employees and job 
applicants, regardless of race, color, religious creed, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital 
status, national origin, ancestry, learning disability, present or past history of mental 
disorder, mental retardation, genetic history, or physical disability, including, but not 
limited to, blindness, or criminal record, unless the provisions of §46a-80(b) or 46a-81(b) 
of the Connecticut General Statutes are controlling or there is a bona fide occupational 
qualification excluding persons in one of the above protected classes. This policy applies 
to all aspects of the employer/employee relationship, including recruitment, selection, 
appointment, upgrading and promotion, evaluation, conditions and privileges of 
employment, training, educational assistance, compensation, benefits, transfer, discipline, 
layoff, recall and termination of employment. 

he Judicial Branch complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act and with all 

federal and state law pertaining to individuals with disabilities. The terms "disability" or 
"disabled" as used in this policy statement and elsewhere in the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Plan shall be construed in a manner consistent with the ADA and other 
pertinent federal and state laws. To this end the Judicial Branch has appointed division 
representatives to the ADA Committee to ensure continued compliance with the ADA 
and an ongoing forum to see that needs are identified and addressed throughout the 
Branch. "Equal Employment Opportunity", as defined by law and governmental 
regulations, requires affirmative action to overcome the effects of past and present 
discriminatory practices, policies or other barriers to equal employment opportunity and 
to ensure the full and fair utilization of women and minorities in all levels of the work 
force.  The goal of the Judicial Branch is to achieve a work force population that is 
properly balanced and fully represented by women and minorities throughout the 
organization and to ensure true equality of employment and a work environment that is 
free of discrimination. Further, the Judicial Branch will make every reasonable 
accommodation to satisfy the needs of its applicants and employees with disabilities. If 
employees feel they have been discriminated against, they should contact the 
Administrative Services Division Human Resource Management Unit, Office of the 
Chief Court Administrator. The Administrative Service Division Human Resource 
Management Unit is authorized to review and investigate such complaints and identify 
and mitigate discriminatory practices.  

he accompanying Equal Employment Opportunity Plan for 2015-2016 sets forth the 

continuing course of action the Judicial Branch will take during this period in order to put 
forth a good-faith effort to attain the goals indicated within the fiscal constraints faced by 

  T

  T

the State. All managers and supervisors are responsible for implementing the provisions 
herein.   

he Equal Employment Opportunity Plan will be updated and revised periodically to 
reflect changes in federal and/or state anti-discrimination laws. All employees of the 
Judicial Branch have the right to review and comment on the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Plan posted on the Judicial Branch Intranet Webpage. Any questions relating 
to details of this Plan should be referred to the Administrative Services Division Human 
Resource Management Unit (860-706-5280).

OBJECTIVES FOR ACHIEVEMENT 
 

While the Connecticut Judicial Branch is prepared to take the steps set forth below to 
achieve the goals that have been established, we must acknowledge that our opportunities 
to recruit new members of the workforce are limited and promotional activity has been 
curtailed by the fiscal constraints under which state government continues to operate.  
Given such constraints on recruiting from outside the Branch, we will focus our efforts 
on filling critical vacancies primarily through the promotion and transfer of existing 
employees. When opportunities to fill positions arise, every effort will be made to 
achieve the goals set forth above through promotion of existing employees in the targeted 
racial or ethnic group. 

FFICIALS AND ADMINISTRATORS: 

The Connecticut Judicial Branch will make every effort to promote minorities or recruit 
as appropriate, for the officials/administrators openings as set forth in the EEOP Goals on 
the preceding page. This recruitment effort will include the utilization of Career Builder, 
which incorporates major newspaper advertisers and minority targeted advertisers. 
Whenever appropriate, recruitment will be done regionally and/or nationally by 
advertising in professional publications and newspapers. The Branch will also continue 
recruitment efforts at state colleges and universities, including law schools, and through 
the Internet.

DISSEMINATION 
 

The Judicial Branch will take the necessary steps to ensure that it’s Equal Employment 
Opportunity Plan and EEO and sexual harassment policies are disseminated throughout 
all its facilities. These steps will include the following: 
 

•  Upon its approval, the Equal Employment Opportunity Plan will be posted on the 

Judicial Branch Intranet and Internet Webpages. 

•  The EEO policy statement, non-discrimination and sexual harassment policy 
statements will be distributed to all facilities and posted on bulletin boards 
throughout each location. The plan will also be posted on the Judicial Branch 
Intranet Website for review by employees throughout the year.  The Human 
Resource Management Unit will continue to provide support and training to 
employees and supervisory staff. 

•  All new employees will be given a copy of the EEO policy statement of 
commitment and informed as to the location of the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Plan on the Judicial Branch Intranet. 

•  The Executive Directors will continue to stress the importance of the EEO 
program and require managers and supervisors to undertake conscious and 
deliberate steps toward overcoming adverse practices to achieve the goals set 
forth in the Equal Employment Opportunity Plan. The Judicial Branch 
Administrative Policies and Procedures Manual sets forth that EEO goals are in 
place and that all managers and supervisors must work for their achievement. 

•  Written comments addressing the Equal Employment Opportunity Plan are 
encouraged. These comments should be directed to the Human Resource 
Management Unit, Connecticut Judicial Branch, 90 Washington Street, Hartford, 
Connecticut. 

  S

  S

   

•  All EEO internal communications and written comments received will be dated 

and maintained within the Human Resource Management Unit. 

•  The Human Resource Management Unit will continue to provide assistance to 

Equal Employment Opportunity Compliance Coordinators. Training needs were 
assessed and training was developed for Coordinators and refresher courses will 
be offered each year. These Coordinators are Judicial Branch employee 
volunteers chosen by their division executive directors. Their mission is to 
monitor all employment interviews to assure that the hiring and promotional 
standards of the Branch are upheld. 

EXTERNAL DISSEMINATION 
 
The  Judicial  Branch  is  committed  to  the  goals  of  equal  employment  opportunity  and 
affirmative action and has initiated activities to ensure that Equal Employment Opportunity is 
more than a paper commitment. The Equal Employment Opportunity Plan is on file with the 
Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities. Written expression of the commitment of 
the Judicial Branch to Equal Employment Opportunity and notices of job availability are sent 
regularly  to  recruiting  sources  and  organizations  that  are  capable  of  referring  qualified 
applicants for employment. In addition to maintaining  frequent contact with protected class 
members  and  resource  agencies,  the  Judicial  Branch  is  engaged  in  discussions  designed  to 
foster ongoing relationships and develop additional recruiting sources. 

n addition, employment advertising omits references to age or gender, except in the case 
of  bona  fide  occupational  qualification  or  need,  and  clearly  conveys  the  desire  of  the 
Judicial Branch to employ members of protected classes. 

he  Judicial  Branch  is  firmly  committed  to  meeting  the  requirements  of  the  Connecticut 
Supplier  Diversity  Program  as  mandated  by  the  Connecticut  General  Statutes.  The 
Department  of  Administrative  Services  (DAS)  and  the  Commission  on  Human  Rights  and 
Opportunities (CHRO) monitor adherence to these regulations. 

nder the Administrative Policies and Procedures of the Judicial Branch, the Materials 

Management Unit shall comply with the State policies for Supplier Diversity. CHRO 
guidelines require that the Judicial Branch make a good faith effort to award 25% of all non-
exempt state contracts with State Certified Small Business Enterprises (SBE). Of that 
amount, 25% must be awarded to Minority-owned Business Enterprises (MBE) which 
include businesses owned by women and mentally and or physically disabled persons. A 
record of the performance of the Judicial Branch against established SBE goals may be found 
on the Department of Administrative Services’ website at 
http://www.ct.gov/chro/cwp/view.asp?a=2525&Q=315900&chroPNavCtr=|#45679  or a 
copy is available for inspection by contacting the office of the Director of Materials 
Management. 

n addition, the Judicial Branch refrains from knowingly doing business with any bidder, 
contractor, subcontractor or supplier of materials barred from participation in any federal or 
state contract program or found to be in violation of any state or federal antidiscrimination 
law. All purchase orders sent to contractors or suppliers doing business with the Judicial

Branch contain the requirement that the contractor or supplier comply with all state and 
federal laws concerning non-discrimination and warrants that the contractor or supplier will 
not discriminate or permit discrimination against any person or group of persons on the 
grounds of race, color, religious creed, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, national 
origin, ancestry, present or past history of mental disorder, mental retardation, genetic 
history, or physical disability, including but not limited to, blindness, or criminal record, 
unless the provisions of §46a-80(b) or 46a-81(b) of the Connecticut General Statutes are 
controlling or there is a bona fide occupational qualification excluding persons in one of 
the above protected classes. Each contractor or supplier is also required, on request, to 
provide the Judicial Branch with information concerning employment practices and 
procedures. All Contractors and suppliers must also agree to make a good faith effort to 
employ minority-owned business enterprises as subcontractors. The Judicial Branch 
maintains files containing the name and address of bidders, contractors and sub-contractors 
receiving notice of its policy and contract provisions.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
