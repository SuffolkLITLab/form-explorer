INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT TRANSMITTAL #1 - INITIAL REQUEST 
 

   

 

 

  

 
PURPOSE OF THE FORM: 
 
The CSE Transmittal #1-Initial Request form is required for initiating an intergovernmental case to any responding state’s 
 
central registry.  It contains basic case information and space for indicating which services are requested.  The form can 
be used to request a number of different actions, including establishment of parentage and/or a support obligation, 
 
modification, and/or enforcement.  It does not take the place of, and therefore must be accompanied by, the appropriate 
standard intergovernmental forms (e.g., Uniform Support Petition, Personal Information Form for UIFSA §311, General 
 
Testimony, Declaration in Support of Establishing Parentage, Letter of Transmittal Requesting Registration) and 
supporting documentation.  Whenever possible, a Transmittal #1 request should be sent electronically using the 
appropriate CSENet transaction.  However, some states also require a paper Transmittal #1. 
 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The information on this form may be disclosed as authorized by law. 
 

 

 

If you are not the intended recipient, you are hereby notified that any use, disclosure, distribution, or copying of this 
 
form or its contents is strictly prohibited. 
 
 

 

 

 

 
Italicized text that appears within a “box” refers to policy or provides additional information. 

 

 

 
For an address outside the United States, be sure to include the foreign country and postal code. 

 

 

Tribal IV-D programs may choose to use the federal Intergovernmental forms.  However, they are not required to 
use or accept such forms.  If you have any questions, contact the tribal IV-D agency directly using the contact 
 
information on the OCSE website. 
 

  

 

 

 

 
 
If this is a tribal IV-D case, note that tribal locator codes uniquely identify tribal cases with “9” in the first position, 
0 (zero) in the second position, and then a 3-character tribal code defined by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The Child Support Agency Confidential Information Form must be attached. 

 

  
HEADING/CAPTION: 
 

•  The initiating jurisdiction determines the heading. 
•  Identify the petitioner and respondent by full legal name (first, middle, last, suffix) and, if applicable, include the 
 
 

name of the tribe with which the petitioner or respondent is affiliated. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Check the appropriate box to identify the type of IV-D case: TANF, IV-E foster care, Medicaid only, former 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assistance, or never assistance. 

 

 

TANF means the obligee’s family is currently receiving IV-A cash payments.  A Medicaid only case is a case in 
which the obligee’s family receives Medicaid but does not receive TANF.  A former assistance case might be a case 
 
for state arrears only or for a family that previously received TANF, but is not doing so at this time. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  In the space marked “To:”, list the name and address (street, PO Box, city, state, and zip code) of the agency to 

 

 

 

 

which you are sending the CSE Transmittal #1. 

 

 

Once an initial referral in a IV-D case has been made to the responding state’s central registry (using a CSE 
Transmittal #1), subsequent communication should occur with the agency/court/jurisdiction that is actually working 
 
the case (using a CSE Transmittal #2). 

 

 

 

 

•  In the appropriate spaces, enter the responding jurisdiction’s locator code, state, and, if applicable and known, IV-D 

 

case identifier and tribunal number.

The responding jurisdiction is the jurisdiction that is working the case at the request of the initiating jurisdiction. 
  
 
Under “IV-D case identifier”, enter the number/identifier identical to the one submitted on the Federal Case 
 
 
Registry, which is a left-justified up to 15-character alphanumeric field, allowing all characters except asterisk and 
backslash, and with all characters in uppercase.  Under “tribunal number”, you may enter the docket number, 
 
cause number, or any other appropriate reference number that the responding tribunal may use to identify the 
  
case, if known. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

•  In the space marked “From:” list the  initiating  agency’s  name and address  (street,  PO  Box,  city, state, and  zip 

•  In  the  appropriate  spaces,   enter  the  initiating  jurisdiction’s   locator   code,   state,  IV-D   case  identifier,  and,   if 

code). 

applicable, tribunal number. 

 

 

  
The initiating jurisdiction is the jurisdiction that referred the case to the responding jurisdiction for services. 
Under “IV-D case identifier”, enter the number/identifier identical to the one submitted on the Federal Case Registry, 
 
which is a left-justified up to 15-character alphanumeric field, allowing all characters except asterisk and backslash, 
 
and with all characters in uppercase.  Under “tribunal number”, you may enter the docket number, cause number, or 
 
  
any other appropriate reference number that the initiating tribunal has assigned to the case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  In the space marked “Send Payments To:”, list the name and address (street, PO Box, city, state, and zip code) 

of your agency’s support disbursement unit (SDU) if it is not the same information as listed in “To:” above. 

 

 

 

 

 

•  In the appropriate spaces, enter the locator code and state where payments should be sent. 

 

 
In the “NOTE:” section, check any of the following that apply: 
 

 

 

• Nondisclosure Finding/Affidavit attached – If there is a finding prohibiting disclosure of a party’s 
or child(ren)’s address/identifying information or an affidavit alleging that disclosure of such information would 
result in risk of harm, check the box for “Nondisclosure Finding/Affidavit” and attach a copy of the finding/affidavit in 
accordance with section 312 of UIFSA.  If there is a finding/affidavit prohibiting disclosure, the information must be 
sealed and may not be disclosed to the other party or the public.  You may provide the address of the IV-D agency 
as a substitute address for the protected party. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

UIFSA requires that the petition or accompanying documents include certain identifying information regarding the 
parties and child(ren) (e.g., residential address, social security number) unless a party alleges in an affidavit or a 
pleading under oath that the health, safety, or liberty of a party or child would be jeopardized by disclosure of such 
information.  In that event, the information must be sealed. 
 
If a jurisdiction has reason to believe that information should not be released because of safety concerns, it should 
ensure that there is a nondisclosure finding or an allegation in an affidavit or the pleading that disclosure of 
identifying information would result in a risk or harm, as provided under section 312 of UIFSA.  In addition to 
identifying information included on this form, it may be appropriate to submit certain financial information under seal. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

• This form sent through EDE – Check if this form was sent through the Electronic Document Exchange (EDE). 
 
• This request or information sent through CSENet – Check if this request or information was sent through 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CSENet. 

CSENet and EDE transactions are the recommended methods for making requests or sending information to 
another state.  If CSENet is not listed as an option on the form, then it cannot be used to convey any of the 
requests or information provided on the form. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Supporting documentation should be sent through EDE, whenever possible. 

Section I.  Action: 
 
  

 

Check the appropriate box(es) to indicate which actions are requested.  Multiple actions may be requested, as appropriate.  You 
may acknowledge receipt of the Transmittal #1 via CSENet or by returning the separate Transmittal #1 Acknowledgment form. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

•  Check item 1 “Establish parentage” when parentage has not been legally determined.  Be sure to attach a separate

“Declaration in Support of Establishing Parentage” for each child whose parentage is at issue. 

 

•  Check item 2 “Establish and enforce order, and forward payment to the initiating jurisdiction’s SDU for” to request the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
establishment of an order.  Indicate the type of order by checking the appropriate box(es). 
 

•  Check item 2A “Current child support, including medical support” to request the initial establishment of a new 
 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
child support order. 

•  Check item 2B “Retroactive child support” to request support for a prior period. 
   
 

 

 

 

 

States may establish child support awards covering a prior period, but such awards must be based on the 
 
responding state’s child support guidelines.  The award of retroactive support is not required under federal rules, but 
 
may be appropriate in accordance with state law.  Not all states have authority to establish support orders for prior 
 
 
periods.  The law of the responding state governs the extent to which retroactive support is available.  A medical 
 
support provision must be included in any new or modified order in a IV-D case. 
 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Check item 2C “Medical support only” in a Medicaid case in which a child support order does not exist and is 
 
 
not sought.  If seeking to add medical support to an existing child support order, check either item 3.B or 4.B 
 
(modify and enforce) depending on whether the order being modified was issued by the responding tribunal 
 
or is being registered for modification in the responding jurisdiction. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Check item 3 “Take the following action(s) on the responding tribunal’s order and forward payment to the initiating 
 
 
jurisdiction’s SDU:” when the responding tribunal has already issued a support order.  More than one action can 
 
be chosen. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Check item 3A “Enforce” to enforce the support order. 
 
 
•  Check item 3B “Modify and enforce” to modify and enforce the support order. 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

You may ask a responding state to modify its order if either the obligor, the individual obligee or the child(ren) reside 
 
in the responding state and the individual parties have not filed a consent in a record in the responding tribunal for 
 
another state to assume jurisdiction to modify.  You may ask a responding state to modify its order, even if it is not 
 
the residence of the obligor, individual obligee, or the child so long as the parties have consented in a record or in 
open court that the tribunal may continue to exercise jurisdiction to modify its order.  You may also ask a responding 
state to modify its order if one party resides in another state and the other party resides outside the United States. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Check item 3C “Modify then close this intergovernmental IV-D case” to modify the support order and then close 
 
 
the IV-D case because additional services are not needed in this intergovernmental case.  If you select this 
action, you are not requesting enforcement or the forwarding of payments. Do not check this box if you want the 
responding jurisdiction to also enforce the modified order. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Check item 3D “Enforce arrears only” to enforce the collection of arrears only.  Do not check this if you are also 
 

 

 

requesting enforcement of current support. 
  

•  Check item 3E “Change person/entity entitled to receive funds and enforce” to change the person or agency 
 
 

 

 

 

 

entitled to receive child support payments. 

 

   

 

 

 

This action is used when the initiating agency asserts that the person/entity entitled to receive child support 
 
 
payments has changed from the person/entity designated in the existing support order due to a change in custody or 
 
foster care status.  Some IV-D agencies have administrative authority to make the change; in other jurisdictions, a 
 
 
court action is required.  The initiating agency should confer with the responding IV-D agency to determine what 
 
 
documentation or pleading is required for the responding jurisdiction to consider the requested action. 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

•
 

 

 

•  Check item 4 “Take the following action on a support order of another jurisdiction and forward payment to the initiating 
 
 
jurisdiction’s SDU:” when the responding jurisdiction has not issued the support order that you are seeking to modify 
 
and/or enforce. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Check item 4A “Register and enforce” to register and enforce the support order. 
 
   
 

 

 

 

 

Under section 507(b) of UIFSA, the support enforcement agency, without initially seeking to register the order under 
 
 
Article 6, shall consider and, if appropriate, use any administrative procedure authorized by the law in the responding 
state to enforce a support order or an income withholding order, or both. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

     

 

•  Check item 4B “Register, modify, and enforce” to register, modify, and enforce the support order.  Once the 
 
responding jurisdiction modifies the registered order, the responding jurisdiction’s order controls and must be

Do not ask a responding state to modify the order of another state unless the following facts exist: 
 
•  Neither the obligor, the individual obligee, nor the child(ren) resides in the state that issued the order; AND 
 
 
•  The individual seeking to register the order for modification does not reside in the responding state; AND 
 
 
•  The responding state has or may obtain personal jurisdiction over the non-registering party; 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  The responding state is the residence of the child, or the responding state has or may obtain personal jurisdiction 
 

 

 

over an individual party; AND 
 
All of the individual parties have filed consents in a record in the tribunal that issued the order for the tribunal in 
the responding state to modify the support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction. 
OR 
 

   

 
 

•  All of the individual parties reside in the responding state and the child does not reside in the state that issued the 
 

 

OR 
 

 
order. 
 

 

 

 

•  Check item 4C to “Register, modify, then close this intergovernmental IV-D case” to register, modify, then close 
 
 

the IV-D case because additional services are not needed in this intergovernmental case.  If you select this action, 
 
 
you are not requesting enforcement or the forwarding of payments.  Do not check this box if you want the 
responding jurisdiction to also enforce the modified order. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Check item 4D to “Register and enforce arrears only” to enforce the collection of arrears only.  Do not check this if 
 
 
   

you are also requesting enforcement of current support. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Federal regulations allow case closure when the initiating agency has notified the responding agency that its 
 
intergovernmental services are no longer needed. An initiating agency must instruct the responding agency to close 
its interstate case and to stop any withholding order or notice  before the initiating state transmits a withholding order 
 
or notice, with respect to the same case, to the same or another employer unless the two states reach an alternative 
agreement on how to proceed. 
 

 

 

 

 

•  Check item 5 “Other” for an action that is not listed and describe the action requested. 
   
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Section II.  Case Summary: 
 
 

 

 

 

 

•  NOTE:  This is a summary document.  Refer to the order for additional information. 
 
 
•  Enter: 
 
 
•  Date of support order 
 
 
•  State and county, tribe, or foreign country issuing order 
 
 
 
•  Tribunal number 
 
 
 
•  Support amount/frequency 
 
 
•  Date of last payment 
  
 
•  Total amount of arrears 
 
 
•  Period of computation - enter the month, day, and year for both the beginning and ending dates. 
  
 

 

 

 

 

 

•  NOTE:  For a breakdown of “Total amount of arrears,” refer to the order and, if applicable, the Letter of Transmittal 
 
 

 

 

 

 

Requesting Registration. 
 

•  Check whether the order is for current support or arrears only. 
 
 
•  Check “Additional orders or information attached” if you are sending more than two orders or additional information 
 

 

 

 

 

 

to the responding jurisdiction. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This section allows a IV-D agency to include information about more than one order for current support.  For example, 
 
there may be separate orders for different children involving the same obligor and obligee.  The rarer situation will be 
multiple current support orders that may have been improperly entered.  The initiating jurisdiction may use this section to 
provide information about the multiple orders.  It should then check item 5 “Other” under Section I Action and request that 
 
 
the responding jurisdiction determine the validity of the orders. 
 
This section allows a IV-D agency to include information about an arrears only order.  For example, in some states, 
 
administrative orders for current child support are later superseded by a judicial order in the same state, such as a divorce 
 
decree, that does not recognize, incorporate, or modify the administrative order.  While under state law the judicial order 
 
controls current support, arrears accrued under the superseded administrative order and not included in the judicial order 
 
remain collectible under the administrative order.  This section also allows the IV-D agency to provide information about 
 
the enforceable arrears under the administrative order.  It also allows a IV-D agency to provide information about a money 
 
judgment for arrears or an order that only addresses support for a prior period.

At the bottom of page 2, provide a specific contact person’s name, a direct telephone number (with extension if 
 
 
necessary), a fax number, and an e-mail address to expedite communication between jurisdictions. 
 
Encryption Requirements: 
 
 
When communicating this form through electronic transmission, precautions must be taken to ensure the security of the data. 
  
 
Child support agencies are encouraged to use the electronic applications provided by the federal Office of Child Support 
 
Enforcement.  Other electronic means, such as encrypted attachments to e-mails may be used if the encryption method is 
 
 
compliant with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2 (FIPS PUB 140-2). 
 
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-13) 
 
 
 
Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 0.21 hours per response, including the time for 
 
reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and reviewing the collection of information. 
 
 
An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays 
 
 
a currently valid OMB control number.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
