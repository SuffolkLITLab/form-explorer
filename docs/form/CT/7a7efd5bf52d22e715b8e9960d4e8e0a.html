INTRODUCTION
(answers to basic questions)

What is “Small Claims Court”?

•  The “Small Claims Court” is a part of Connecticut’s court system 

where a person may sue for up to $5,000.00 in money damages only. 
This amount is set by state law and may change from time to time. To 
find out the current amount, you may contact any court clerk’s office. 
You may find contact information for clerk’s offices in Sections  
7 through 9 of this booklet.

•   While you may only sue for $5,000.00 or less, there are situations 
when you may be awarded an amount greater than $5,000.00. 
Specifically, you may be awarded fees and costs for your case in 
addition to the amount you have sued for. You may also be awarded 
an amount greater than $5,000.00 if you are suing for the return of a 
security deposit held by your landlord and you ask the court to double 
the damages in your case. For more information on how to request 
fees and costs or double damages in a security deposit case, review the 
Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit (form JD-CV-40).

•   The Small Claims Court does not hear libel and slander cases.

•   Most small claims cases are heard and ruled on by magistrates.

•   Small claims cases are not recorded, so there is no transcript of  

the proceedings.

•   Information about specific small claims cases can be found at:  

https://jud.ct.gov/jud2.htm. That information may be searched by 
party name, docket number, court calendar, attorney case list, attorney 
calendar, and attorney search.

•   If you lose your small claims case and you are ordered to pay money 
to the other person in the case (plaintiff or defendant), your ability 
to get credit may change. Small claims judgments (decisions) are 
public information and could show up on your credit report. The laws 
that control Consumer Credit Reports are in Section 36a-695 of the 
Connecticut General Statutes and the sections that follow that section 
of the statutes. If you need paperwork from the court file to clarify with 
or to ask the Consumer Credit Reporting Agency for a change to an 

1

item on your credit report, you may get copies from the court file in 
your case. $1.00 per page is charged by the court clerk for most copies.

•   If you have a complaint about a Consumer Credit Reporting Agency 

you may complain to the Connecticut Banking Department, Consumer 
Credit Division, 260 Constitution Plaza, Hartford, CT 06103-1800.

•   There is no appeal from small claims judgments.

NOTE: By law, you must start your case within a certain amount of 
time. If you wait too long to start your case, you may lose your case. 
Please look at Chapter 926 of the Connecticut General Statutes for 
information.

How is the Small Claims session different from other 
court sessions?

The Small Claims session of the Superior Court has simpler rules than 
the regular civil session of that court. Small Claims forms are designed 
to be understood without legal training. The rules and forms are designed 
to allow the person or company suing (the plaintiff) to sue a person or 
company (the defendant) without the help of an attorney. Those rules and 
forms do not cover all situations. 

You may file a small claims lawsuit against a person who lives out of 
state only if that person owns property in the state of Connecticut. A 
statement that the out-of-state person owns property must be included in 
the claim. You may also file a small claims lawsuit against out-of-state 
businesses, corporations and limited liability companies (LLCs).

Do I need to hire an attorney?

No. Attorneys may represent you in small claims court, but every part of 
the Small Claims Court has been designed so a person can handle his or 
her own case from the start of the case to the end of the case. 

Therefore, if you are an individual, you may represent yourself. Also, in 
small claims, certain members of a business may represent the business 
in court, even if they are not an attorney. Review Section 24-6 of the 
Connecticut Practice Book for more information.

2

If you are representing yourself in your case, you must show the court all 
your proof. The court and the clerk’s office will help you with the various 
steps in the case (the court process), but they can only help with the 
process. They cannot give you legal advice.

Section 1
THE PLAINTIFF’S CASE
(person who starts the case)

How do I start a small claims case (lawsuit)?

Under the Small Claims Rules of Practice in the Connecticut Practice 
Book, the person who files the case (the plaintiff) must serve (deliver 
– by an approved method) the lawsuit to each person they are suing 
(defendant) by 1 of the following 4 ways:

•   priority mail with delivery confirmation;

•   certified mail, return receipt requested;

•   a nationally recognized courier service, with delivery confirmation, or;

•   service (delivery – by an approved method) by a proper officer (for 

example, a state marshal).

Service (delivery) by a proper officer is required when the defendant 
is an out-of-state business (a business organized under the laws of a 
state other than Connecticut). There are also special service (delivery) 
requirements when the plaintiff sues an out-of-state insurance company.  
See How to Serve (Deliver to Defendant) a Small Claims Writ and Notice 
of Suit (Form JD-CV-122) in Section 12 of this booklet. The plaintiff 
must pay the cost of service but can get the cost back from the defendant 
if the plaintiff wins the small claims case and is able to collect the money 
awarded in the judgment from the defendant. 

The statute of limitations is a time limit on how long a plaintiff has to 
start a case. If the claim is a debt or obligation incurred primarily for 
personal, family or household purposes, the plaintiff will need to give the 
reasons why the plaintiff believes that the statute of limitations time limit 
has not run out. For more information, see ch 926 of the Connecticut 
General Statutes.

3

The plaintiff must also show how he or she knows that the address given 
for each defendant is accurate and how the address was checked within 
the 6 months before starting the lawsuit. The following documents must 
be completed first.

1.  Complete the Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit (Form JD-CV-40) 
form. The form should be typed or printed neatly so it can be read. Please 
remember that the form is a legal document. The clerk’s office will not 
accept your case if any copies of the form cannot be read. The name of 
the person or business you are suing (the defendant) must be its exact, 
correct legal name. If you make a mistake and put the wrong name on the 
form, you may not get your money. You may not use initials, nicknames, 
or abbreviations of any person or business you are suing. For example, 
“Richard Jones” cannot be sued as “R. Jones” or “Dick Jones.” If you 
leave out any part of any name on the form, you may not get your money. 
(See the sample Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit (form JD-CV-40 
in Section 11 of this booklet.)

On the Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit, there are numbered 
Instructions to Plaintiff to help you fill out each part of the form. Forms 
that are not complete and forms that cannot be read will be returned to 
you for you to complete or correct and those forms will have to be served 
again by you. You will have to pay the costs to have the form delivered 
again. If you win the small claims case, a magistrate will decide if you 
can be awarded the costs for the additional delivery.

If there are two or more people who start the case (the plaintiffs) or two 
or more people who are sued (the defendants) in your case, check the box 
under Defendants 1 and 2 and list the additional plaintiffs or defendants 
on the Continuation of Parties (form JD-CV-67).  

2.  If your claim is against a business, you must find out if that business 
is a DBA (person “doing business as” a company, also known as 
a“trade name”), a corporation, a limited liability company (LLC), or a 
partnership. To find out if the business is incorporated and who the legal 
documents for the case can be delivered to (served on), call the Secretary 
of the State, Commercial Recording Corporation Information, 30 Trinity 
Street, Hartford, CT 06106 at (860) 509-6002 or go to the Secretary of 
State’s website at: www.sots.ct.gov (Commercial Recording Division).  

4

Information about DBAs can be found at the office of the town clerk 
where the party is doing business. 

If the business is an out-of-state business (a business that is not 
organized under Connecticut laws), the original Small Claims Writ and 
Notice of Suit must be served by a proper officer. Information about the 
business and its agent for service will be required by the officer you hire 
to deliver the Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit. If the claim is against 
an in-state business (a business that is organized under Connecticut 
laws), you may serve that business by any of the 4 ways that are allowed 
for serving the claim (see above).

3.  Attach copies of any documents or papers about your case to the 
Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit, for example, leases, statements, 
invoices, and bills. Keep the originals; you may bring them to your 
hearing.

4.  You must sign and notarize the Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit 
before serving it. Your signature must be notarized. You must sign the 
claim in front of the person who is notarizing it. You must also print your 
name clearly and your title, if you have a title, in the box provided. Your 
oath must be taken at the time you sign the claim and the person who 
took your oath (the Clerk, a Notary, or a Commissioner of the Superior 
Court) must also sign. Attorneys are Commissioners of the Superior 
Court. Remember to keep copies of all documents and papers  
for yourself.

5.  You must serve or have a proper officer serve a copy of the completed 
original Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit on each defendant along 
with the Instructions to Defendant (Notice to Person Being Sued) (form 
JD-CV-121) before filing it with the court. See How to Serve a Small 
Claims Writ and Notice of Suit (form JD-CV-122) for instructions. 
Samples of all forms are in Section 11. A copy of all papers that you 
are going to file with the court, including all attachments to the original 
Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit, must be served. After service is 
completed, file the original papers and a Statement of Service (form  
JD-CV-123) for each defendant with the court. Keep a copy of all 
papers for your records.  

5

You must also give the entry fee to the clerk’s office. See Section 10 of 
this booklet for a list of court fees in Small Claims cases. The entry fee 
will be added to the amount of your judgment against the defendant if 
you win. Do not add the entry fee to the amount you are suing for.

What happens after I file (start) the claim?

After you file your case, the clerk will pick a date the defendant has to 
answer your claim by. That date is called the “answer date.” The clerk 
will mail a number assigned to the case called a docket number and the 
answer date to all the plaintiffs or their representatives. The clerk will 
send an answer form that includes the docket number of the case and  
the answer date to each defendant at the address given to the clerk by  
the plaintiff.

Do not come to court on the answer date.

Where do I file (start) the Small Claims Case?

Small Claims cases may be mailed or hand delivered to the proper local 
court which can be found by looking at Section 7 or 8 of this booklet 
for all cases except landlord-tenant matters. For landlord-tenant matters, 
look at Section 9 of this booklet.

If the plaintiff is a person and not a business and the case does not 
involve a landlord-tenant matter, the place where the hearing (trial) will 
take place (venue), if a hearing is necessary, will be a court in one of 
the following places: (1) where you live; (2) where the party you are 
suing (the defendant) lives or does business; or (3) where the thing or 
injury you are suing about took place. If the claim is a landlord-tenant 
matter, the trial will be in the court location where the house or apartment 
(premises) is located.

If the plaintiff is a corporation organized under Connecticut laws, a 
United States corporation, a foreign corporation (organized under the 
laws of another state) or a limited liability company, the place where 
the hearing will take place (venue), if a hearing is necessary, will be  
in the court which serves the town in which the defendant lives or is 
doing business or where the thing or injury the plaintiff is suing about 
took place.

6

Reminder: You cannot sue a person in Small Claims Court if 
that person does not live in Connecticut unless that person owns 
property in Connecticut. You must say in the Small Claims Writ and 
Notice of Suit that the person you are suing owns property  
in Connecticut. 

What happens if the defendant files an answer?

1.  Each defendant must send a copy of his or her answer to each attorney 
or other representative of the plaintiff, or if the plaintiff is representing 
himself or herself, to the plaintiff.

•   If a defendant does not agree with (denies) the claim, a trial will be set 
up and you will be notified by mail of the time and date of the trial.

•   If a defendant agrees with (admits) the claim and offers to pay you 
a certain amount of money for a certain period of time, you may 
agree to the defendant’s offer of payment. The case will be given to 
a magistrate who will review the case and may enter an agreed on 
(stipulated) judgment.

•   If the defendant admits the claim but desires time in which to pay, 
he or she may state that fact in the answer, with reasons to support 
this request, on or before the time set for answering, and may suggest 
a method of payment which he or she can afford. The request for 
a proposed method of payment shall be considered by the judicial 
authority in determining whether there shall be a stay of execution to 
permit deferred payment or an order of payment. The judicial authority 
in its discretion may require that a hearing be held concerning  
such request.

•   If you do not agree to any part of the defendant’s offer of payment, a 

trial may be scheduled.

2.  If the defendant files an answer and a counterclaim or setoff (a claim 
that the defendant makes against you or a claim by the defendant that 
your claim should be reduced in some way), the clerk’s office will send 
you a form on which you can reply to the counterclaim or setoff.  You 
should send the completed form back to the clerk’s office on or before 
the counterclaim/setoff answer date on the form.

7

Because of the filing of a counterclaim or setoff, you may file a motion to 
transfer the case to the regular docket of the Superior Court on or before 
the counterclaim/setoff answer date if you choose. (See page 12 for 
more details on the transfer of cases to the regular docket.)

What happens if the defendant does not file an 
answer?

If your claim is against a person, you must say, under oath, whether the 
person is or is not in the military or naval service and how you know 
that. You will not be able to get a judgment against a defendant who has 
not answered unless you file an affidavit (a paper signed under oath) 
with the court that states facts showing that the defendant is not in the 
military or naval service. You can find out if the person you are suing is 
in the military or naval service from the Defense Manpower Data Center 
(see mailing address on this page) or by using the following website if 
you have the first and last name of the person and one of the following: 
the person’s date of birth or the person’s social security number. The 
web address is: https://scru.dmdc.osd.mil, and must be typed exactly, 
including the “s” after the http. There is no fee for using this service.  
The statement provided by the website must be attached to an affidavit 
stating that the defendant is not in the military or naval service. If you 
cannot access this website, you may contact the Defense Manpower Data 
Center at 1-800-538-9552.

If you cannot find out if the person is in the military or naval service, you 
must inform the court, and describe your efforts to find out.  You will not 
be able to get a judgment until you tell the court if the person is or is not 
in the service or until you post (give) a bond (an amount of money or 
a legal document promising to pay an amount of money) to protect the 
legal rights of the person you sued if that person is in the service.  The 
amount of time the bond is kept depends on the kind of judgment that is 
entered. 

8

If you do not know the date of birth and social security number of the 
person you are suing, you must find out the military status of that person 
by asking a person who knows the person you are suing well to complete 
an affidavit (written statement under oath), or by giving the place of the 
defendant’s full time employment in an affidavit. For the affidavit, you 
can use court form JD-FM-178, Affidavit Concerning Military Service, 
(form JD-FM-178) which you can get on the Judicial Branch website at: 
http://www.jud.ct.gov/webforms/forms/fm178.pdf, or at the clerk’s office 
or court service center. 

If you say under oath that you cannot determine if the person is in the 
military or naval service, you may not be able to get a judgment. 

Based on the kind of case you have, if the defendant does not file an 
answer the court may enter a judgment against the defendant (called a 
“default judgment”) for the full amount of your claim plus costs, or the 
court may schedule the matter for a trial to decide how much is owed  
to you.

The clerk’s office will notify you if you must come to court to prove your 
claim. Whether or not you have to come to court is made on a case-by-
case determination.

If the party you are suing pays you all the money you claim is owed 
before the court enters judgment, you should end the case (withdraw the 
action) by filing a Withdrawal (JD-CV-70) form with the clerk. You can 
get the Withdrawal form from the following website: www.jud.ct.gov/
webforms/forms/cv070.pdf.

Be sure that you have actually gotten payment (for example, the check 
has cleared) before you withdraw the case. You can mail the Withdrawal 
form to the court where your case is pending. Make sure you include on 
the Withdrawal form the docket number of your case, the answer date or 
hearing date and the names of the parties. Fill out the certification at the 
bottom of the Withdrawal form and send a copy of it to the defendant.

Section 2
THE DEFENDANT’S CASE
(person being sued)

How do I answer the claim?

1.  If you want to respond to the claim of the person who is suing you 
(the plaintiff), you must file an Answer. You will get an Answer form 
from the court shortly after the Small Claims case has been served on 
(delivered to) you by the plaintiff and the plaintiff has filed the case 
with the court. You should complete the Answer form and return it to 
the court. You must send a copy of the Answer to each attorney or other 
representative of the plaintiff, or if the plaintiff is representing himself or 
herself, to the plaintiff and certify on the Answer form that you have done 
so. 

If you do not agree with the plaintiff’s claim, you should explain why 
you do not owe the money. Your answer does not have to be long because 
you will have a chance to explain your case at the trial. If you attach any 
papers as part of your answer, you must send a copy of all of the papers 
to the plaintiff(s).

2.  If you think that the plaintiff owes you money, you may file a 
“counterclaim” against the plaintiff. If you file a counterclaim, you must 
pay a filing fee of $95.00 to the clerk’s office. The filing fee will be 
added to the amount of your judgment against the plaintiff if you win. Do 
not add the filing fee to the amount you claim the plaintiff owes you.

Be clear about the amount of money you are claiming and the reasons 
for your counterclaim. If the amount of the counterclaim is more than the 
amount that can be sued for in small claims, see Transfer of Cases to 
the Regular Docket on page 12 for more information on moving your 
case to the regular Superior Court.

10

3.  The answer must be in writing and must be given to the court on or 
before the Answer Date.

4.  Even if you think you owe the plaintiff some money, but you disagree 
with or are unsure about the amount that you owe, you should file an 
answer. Filing an answer will give you a chance to come to court for a 
trial so that a magistrate can decide the amount you owe the plaintiff.

5.  If you are sure that you owe the plaintiff the entire amount claimed 
but you want time to pay, you should file an answer telling the reasons 
why you need more time to pay. You may suggest a payment amount 
and schedule for such payments (a period of time for you to make the 
payments.)  If the plaintiff does not accept your request, you may have to 
come to court for a trial on your request for additional time to pay.

SPECIAL NOTE: Do not send payments to the court.

Will I have my hearing (trial) on the answer date?

No. Do not come to court for trial on the answer date. You will be told 
the date and time of your hearing (trial) by mail.

What happens if I do not file an answer?

If you do not file an answer, the court may enter a judgment against you 
(called a “default judgment”) for the full amount of the plaintiff’s claim 
plus costs, or the court may schedule the matter for a trial to decide how 
much you owe (a “hearing in damages”).

If you do not file an answer by the answer date, the court may determine 
that (1) you do not want to argue about the reasons why the plaintiff 
claims you owe the money and (2) you do not want to argue about the 
amount of money that the plaintiff claims you owe. The court may then 
enter a default judgment against you.

Section 3
TRANSFER OF CASES TO THE REGULAR DOCKET 
(Moving small claims cases from Small Claims Court to the regular 
Superior Court)

A case filed in Small Claims Court (on a small claims docket) may be 
moved (transferred) to the regular docket of the Superior Court or to the 
regular docket of the Housing Court.

One reason a case may be moved is because the defendant, or the 
plaintiff in a case where the defendant has filed a counterclaim, wants 
the case transferred.  If that is the reason, the person who wants the case 
moved must file a motion to transfer the case to the regular docket on or 
before the answer date with a certification that the motion was delivered 
to every party involved in the action. 

Another reason a case may be moved is because the court grants a 
motion to open judgment claiming a lack of actual notice of the case. 
If this happens, the motion to transfer, all appended documents, and 
the proper fee must be filed within 15 days after the notice granting the 
motion to open was sent.

The motion to transfer must be filed with (1) a counterclaim in an amount 
that is more  than the amount that can be asked for in small claims court, 
(2) an affidavit (sworn statement) saying that a good defense exists to the 
claim and giving clearly the type of defense, or (3) an affidavit saying 
that the case has been correctly claimed for trial by jury. If the court finds 
that one of these conditions applies, the motion to transfer the case to the 
regular docket may be granted without the need for a court hearing.

The party who has filed the motion to transfer the case to the regular 
docket must pay all required fees at the time the motion to transfer is 
filed, including any jury fees if a claim for a jury trial is filed. Currently, 
the fee for a motion to transfer is $125.00 and the jury fee is $440.00. 
These amounts can change. Contact any clerk’s office for the amounts or 
check “Fees” on the Judicial Branch website at www.jud.ct.gov.

12

Section 4
WHAT TO DO WHILE YOU ARE WAITING FOR A HEARING 
(TRIAL) DATE
Get all of your papers and other documents ready.

The most important thing to do before the trial date is to collect and 
organize all papers that have to do with your claim. Those papers may 
include invoices, letters, statements of account, estimates of damage, 
paid bills, leases, canceled checks, and any other records. Be sure to 
bring them with you when you come to court.  You should bring an extra 
set of copies to the trial.

Figure out who your witnesses will be and if they will come to court 
on their own or if they will have to be ordered to come to court.

Sometimes a friend, relative or neighbor saw what happened. You should 
bring this person to court with you. If the person is not willing to come to 
court, you may ask the clerk of the Small Claims Court for a Subpoena 
form (JD-CL-43) (order to come to court). (See sample Subpoena form 
in Section 11.)

You must fill out the form and give it to the clerk. The clerk will review 
the Subpoena and, if appropriate, sign it. It may not be possible for you 
to make a witness who does not live in Connecticut come to the trial. You 
must have the Subpoena delivered by a proper officer at least 18 hours 
before the hearing date. (There is a charge for this delivery which you 
will have to pay the proper officer.) Sworn statements (affidavits) may 
not be filed with the magistrate instead of the testimony of a witness;  
if you file such an affidavit, the magistrate may not use it to decide  
your case.

Make an outline of the facts of your case.

Write down the facts of your case for your own use. It is important to 
remember that the magistrate or other person hearing the case (judicial 
authority) was not there when the thing you sued the defendant for 
happened. Because of that, the magistrate’s view of the matter can only 
be based on what is said and what is brought to the trial. You should 
organize the facts of the case, and you should not give opinions to  
the magistrate.

13

Determine if you will need an interpreter at the hearing.

Persons who have limited English proficiency may request an interpreter 
be present at the hearing. If you would like an interpreter, contact the 
clerks office as soon as possible.

Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

If you require an accommodation based on a disability covered by the 
ADA, you should contact the court as soon as possible. You should give 
a minimum of ten (10) days’ notice, if possible. In emergency situations, 
the ten-day requirement can be waived, but you should make your 
request as soon as you know that you may need an accommodation. 
A request can be made in any court clerk’s office, court service center, 
over the telephone, or by email. For more information on how to request 
and accommodation and who to contact, please visit jud.ct.gov/ADA or 
contact the clerk’s office where your case will be heard.

What if I need the date of my trial changed to  
another day?

If it is impossible for you to come to court on the day your case has been 
scheduled, you should first call the other party or that party’s attorney 
and tell that person why you want the trial on another day. Moving the 
date of a trial or hearing is called a “continuance.”

1.  If the person you called agrees to have the case continued, you must 
send or fax a written Motion for Continuance to the court where your 
case is pending.

2.  If the other party does not agree to a continuance of the case you may 
still send or fax a written Motion for Continuance (form JD-CV-21) to 
the court where your case is pending.

3.  The Motion for Continuance must include the reason for the 
continuance, when the notice to the other party was given, how notice 
was given and whether or not the party agreed to the continuance.

14

4.  You must send copies of the Motion for Continuance to all other 
parties in the case.

5.  Oral Motions for Continuance requests that are not put in writing are 
only permitted in special circumstances. 

6.  Motions for Continuance made before the trial date will be decided by 
the clerk. Motions for Continuance made on the day of the trial will be 
decided by the magistrate. If the request is granted, the clerk will pick a 
new date for the trial and notify all the parties in the case.

Section 5 
THE HEARING (TRIAL) PROCESS
(how the trial works)

What do I do on the day of the hearing (trial)?

1.  On the day of the hearing (trial), you should be at the courthouse 
before the time the trial starts. You should find out what courtroom small 
claims cases will be heard in, and you should go to that courtroom.

2.  When your name is called, tell the court that you are ready.

3.  Your case will be given to a magistrate who will swear in all the 
witnesses (require that they promise to tell the truth). A magistrate is 
an attorney who hears and decides small claims cases. Also, at some 
locations, some attorneys have volunteered to act as “Commissioners” 
(hearing officers) to help the court by hearing and deciding small claims 
cases. These attorneys (Commissioners) have been approved by the court 
and, if both parties agree, the case may be decided by these attorneys.

4.  The court may ask you to give your documents to the other party and 
the other party to give you their documents before the court hearing. You 
should bring an extra set of copies to the hearing.

5.  All parties in the case will be able to tell the court about their case and 
will be able to ask the other party’s witnesses questions.

15

How long will I be in court and when will I know the 
court’s decision?

This depends on the number of hearings heard by the court on the day of 
your hearing.

Hearings are scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. on the day 
scheduled for small claims at that location.

You should plan to be in court for 1 to 4 hours.

Unless the court tells you the decision at your trial, the decision will be 
written down and mailed to you. The magistrate has up to 45 days to rule 

on a case.

Can I appeal if I lose the case?

No. The decisions and judgments of the Small Claims Court are final and 
may not be appealed to a higher court.

See page 12 for more information about transferring a case to  
the regular docket if you want to keep your right to appeal to a 
higher court.

What can I do if a default judgment enters against 
me or if I find new evidence that I did not have for 
the trial?

If there is a default judgment against you, you may file a Motion to 
Open judgment. There is a fee for filing this motion. As of the date of the 
printing of this booklet, the fee to file a Motion to Open (form JD-CV-51) 
was $75.00.  You may contact the clerk’s office to find out what the  
fee is or you may check “Fees” on the Judicial Branch website at  
www.jud.ct.gov. You may get the form for filing a Motion to Open 
judgment from the clerk’s office, the court service center, or the judicial 
branch website at www.jud.ct.gov under “Forms.” A Motion to Open 
the judgment may be filed at any time after the date of judgment if you 
are claiming you did not get actual notice of the case or within 4 months 
of the date of the judgment for any other reason. The court may also 
open any judgment decided after you were defaulted at any time within 

16

4 months after the date that an execution was made (legal order giving 
a state marshal or other proper officer the right to take defendant’s 
property). See the next section – Collecting the Judgment.

Section 6
COLLECTING THE JUDGMENT 
(how do you get the money you are owed if you win the case)

A judgment in small claims is good for 10 years. However, you may start 
a lawsuit based on the judgment within 15 years after the date of the 
original judgment.

The court cannot collect the money for you. The court hears the case, 
makes the decision, and gives you permission to collect the money you 
are owed.

If a judgment is made against a person, the court may order that person 
to make periodic (usually weekly) payments to the person who won 
the case. When this booklet was printed, the minimum weekly order of 
payments was $35.00. This amount can change. The Notice of Judgment 
form will tell you how much is to be paid to you each payment period 
and when the payments are to start. If you feel that the other party is able 
to make higher payments and you have evidence of his or her wages, you 
may ask the court for an increase in the amount of the periodic payments. 
If you are planning on asking for a wage execution (see page 18), you 
must first have an order from the court for periodic payments.

If a judgment is made against a business or a landlord, the court will 
enter judgment for the full amount. No order of periodic payments will 
be made.

What if the person who lost the case and was 
ordered to pay money cannot pay the periodic 
payment ordered by the court?

The losing party ordered to pay money is called the judgment debtor.  
If the judgment debtor cannot pay the periodic payment ordered by the 
court, that person may ask the court to reduce the amount. The judgment 
debtor will be required to prove his or her financial situation to the court 
before the amount will be reduced.

17

How do I collect my judgment if payment is not  
made voluntarily (person who is ordered to pay  
does not pay)?

If payment is not made as ordered by the court, there are several ways 
to collect your judgment. One way is to get an execution (legal hold 
so that the owner cannot sell or use property) to attach wages, personal 
property, or accounts at financial institutions (savings accounts, checking 
accounts and others). You must have an order for periodic payments on 
the judgment before you can get a wage execution. If you did not get an 
order for periodic payments before, you may file a motion for an order 
for periodic payments. If the judgment debtor does not make the periodic 
payments that were ordered, you may ask for a wage execution.

No execution will be issued if the court has issued a stay of execution. 
No wage execution will be issued if the judgment debtor is making 
periodic payments required by the court.

1.  A wage execution can be given to you and used against a person who 
has a job if that person is not self-employed. You must find out if the 
debtor has a job and, if the debtor has a job, you must find out where he 
or she works. The court cannot find this out for you.

2.  A property execution attaches the personal property, not real 
property (such as real estate), to pay the judgment. You must find out 
where the property is. The court  cannot find this out for you.

3.  Financial Institution executions attach certain accounts at financial 
institutions (for example, banks). You must find out where the account is 
located. The court cannot find this out for you.

You must pay a fee if you want to apply for an execution.  See Section 10 
of this booklet for a list of fees payable in small claims cases. 

How to get an execution (order to hold and turn 
over property of person who owes judgment):

(a)  To file an application for an execution, you will need all the 
information on the Notice of Judgment form. And you will need a 
correct record of payments made (if any) by the debtor to you up until 
the time you apply for the execution.

18

(b)  You can get applications for executions online at: www.jud.ct.gov/
webforms/ or at clerk’s offices and court service centers.

(c)  Once an execution is reviewed and signed by the clerk and given back 
to you, you must hire a state marshal or other proper officer to deliver 
(serve) the execution on the debtor. (A list of state marshals is on the 
Judicial Branch website at: www.jud.ct.gov/faq/marshals.htm. The list 
may also be viewed at any clerk’s office or court service center.) You 
must give the officer the information he or she will need to be able to 
get the money that you are owed by the debtor. That information should 
include the debtor’s current address, bank, or employer. 

Samples of Wage, Financial Institution and Property executions are in 
Section 12 at the end of this booklet.

Can I collect the costs I spent to get the judgment 
and can I collect interest on the judgment from the 
time the judgment was decided?

Yes. Under the Connecticut General Statutes, the judgment creditor (the 
person who won the case) may collect all costs and statutory fees paid in 
getting the judgment. If the court orders it, interest on the judgment from 
the time the judgment was decided (postjudgment interest) may also be 
collected at a rate of interest decided by the court.

If postjudgment interest is ordered by the court, it continues to add up 
and increase the amount owed until the debt is paid in full.

If an execution is issued and delivered, and if the court ordered it, the 
amount of postjudgment interest that can be collected will be figured out 
by the officer who delivered the execution.

Satisfaction of the Judgment (payment of the  
full amount)

If the full amount of the judgment is paid to the judgment creditor, he 
or she must file a written Notice of Satisfaction (payment in full) with 
the clerk of the court within 90 days.  The magistrate may, if a motion is 
filed, decide that the judgment has been satisfied (paid).

19

Examination (Asking questions) of Judgment 
Debtor

If an execution has been given back to the court and has not been paid in 
full or if post-judgment interrogatories (questions asked of the judgment 
debtor after judgment) are not answered within 30 days, you may ask the 
court to issue a Petition for Examination of Judgment Debtor (form JD-
CV-54) and a subpoena, requiring the judgment debtor to come to court. 
This will give you a chance to ask the judgment debtor questions under 
oath about the judgment debtor’s property, assets or financial institution 
accounts. If you do not know what to ask the judgment debtor, you 
may want to look at the list of questions in the Postjudgment Remedies 
Interrogatories in Section 11 of this booklet for help. You may get  
the Petition for Examination of Judgment Debtor at the clerk’s  
office, at a court service center, or on the Judicial Branch website at 
www.jud.ct.gov/webforms/. (See sample at the end of this booklet  
in Section 11.)

REMINDER

You do not need an attorney in the Small Claims session but you have to 
follow the proper procedures.

If you are the plaintiff (person who started the case):

Make sure that you fill out your claim form completely and accurately 
and that you are suing the right defendant. You must serve (deliver) in an 
appropriate manner the claim on each defendant before filing the claim 
with the court.

If you are the defendant (person who is being sued):

1.  You may lose your case if you do not file an Answer.

2.  Your Answer must be in writing and must be received by the small 
claims clerk’s office on or before the answer date. You must send a copy 
of your Answer to each plaintiff.

where a person can sue for money damages only up to $5,000.  
That amount is set by state law and may change from time to time. 
You may also be able to get interest and costs. 
When a tenant (renter) of residential real estate property sues a 
landlord for the return of a wrongfully withheld security deposit, the 
Judicial Authority (Magistrate) may award the tenant twice the 
amount of the security deposit even if the total amount of damages 
and costs, combined, is greater than $5,000. Read sections 51-15(d) 
and 47a-21 of the Connecticut General Statutes for more information. 
The small claims court does not hear libel and slander cases. 
The instructions below are numbered. The numbers are the same as 
the numbered sections of the Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit 
(form JD-CV-40). These instructions are to help you correctly fill out 
each section of the Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit. For more 
information, get a copy of How Small Claims Court Works           
(form JDP-CV-45) from the Clerk's Office or from our website at 
www.jud.ct.gov/faq/smallclaims.html. 
Note: Unless you are hiring a state marshal to serve (deliver) the 
Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit for you, you must deliver a copy 
of the completed original Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit to  
each defendant with the Instructions to Defendant (form JD-CV-121), 
before filing those documents with the court. See How to Serve 
(Deliver to Defendant) a Small Claim Writ and Notice of Suit (form 
JD-CV-122) for instructions. You must deliver a copy of all the 
documents you want to file with the court, for example, all 
attachments to the original writ must be delivered. After all of those 
documents have been delivered, file the original Small Claims Writ 
and Notice of Suit and copies of your supporting documents (for 
example, a lease or a contract) with the court, with the appropriate 
entry fee and Statement of Service (form JD-CV-123) for each 
defendant. Keep a copy of the Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit 
and the Statement of Service for your records. Keep the original of 
any supporting documents. 
1. Information That Will Determine Where The Trial Will Be 

The information you give in this section will determine where the 
trial will be held as long as the information complies with the law. 
If you are suing as a Landlord or Tenant, enter the town where 
the rental property is located. 
If you are an Individual Plaintiff, choose and enter one of the 
following: the town (a) where you live, (b) where the defendant 
lives or where the defendant's business is located, or (c) where the 
transaction or injury occurred. If you leave this section blank, the 
town where you live will determine the trial location. 
If you are a Business Entity, including a domestic or United 
States corporation or a limited liability company, choose and enter 
one of the following: the town (a) where the defendant lives,        
(b) where the defendant is doing business, or (c) where the 
transaction or injury occurred. If you leave this section blank, the 
town where the defendant lives will determine the trial location. 
Note: An out-of-state Individual Defendant must own real or 
personal property in Connecticut to be sued in small claims court.

3.  Claim Between Landlord and Tenant (Renter) 

If the claim is between a landlord and a renter (tenant), then  
select the box for "Yes". If not, then select the box for "No".  

4.   Rental Property Location 

If you answered "Yes" to question 3, then write the name of the 
town where the rental property is located. 

5.   Plaintiff(s) 

You are the plaintiff because you are the person suing the other 
party. If there is more than 1 plaintiff, use the Continuation of 
Parties (form JD-CV-67). Enter the complete and correct legal 
name, address, and telephone number of each plaintiff. For 
each plaintiff, select the box for the type of plaintiff filing. 

6.   Attorney Information 

To be filled out by an attorney only if representing the plaintiff. 

7.   Defendant(s) 

8.   Statute of Limitations 

The defendant is the person you are suing. If you are suing 
more than 1 person, use 1 box for each defendant. For more 
than 2 defendants, use the Continuation of Parties              
(form JD-CV-67). Enter the complete and correct legal name, 
address, and telephone number of each defendant. For each 
defendant, select the box for the type of defendant being sued.  
Note: The name of the person or business you are suing must 
be exact. If you make a mistake and list the wrong name, or 
leave out any part of any name, your claim may not be allowed. 

P L E

A statute of limitations is a time limit on how long you have to 
start a case. The time limit is different for each type of case. 
More information can be found in Chapter 926 of the 
Connecticut General Statutes. If you claim the defendant(s)   
owe(s) a consumer debt, which is a debt or obligation made 
primarily for personal, family, or household reasons, you must 
give the reasons why you believe that the statute of limitations 
time limit has not run out. See section 52-350a(2) of the 
Connecticut General Statutes. 

9.   Address Verification 

Select all boxes that apply showing how you know the address 
you give for each defendant is accurate and provide the date 
you checked the addresses. 

10. Amount Claimed 

Enter the amount of money you are claiming the defendant 
owes you. The amount may not be more than the statutory limit 
for small claims matters. If you claim pre-judgment interest or 
that you should be awarded double damages because you are 
a tenant and your landlord wrongfully withheld your security 
deposit, select the box(es) that apply. 
Do not include the filing fee, amount of pre-judgment interest, 
or double damages for a wrongfully withheld security deposit.  

11. Reason for Claim 

Give a clear, brief description of your case. You may attach 
additional pages, if needed. The claim must be for money 
damages only. Interest and/or the amount for double damages 
for a wrongfully withheld security deposit must be listed in this 
section. You may attach exhibits or documents to support your 
case (for example, a lease or contract). However, do not attach 
original versions; attach only copies. Attachments may not be 
returned to you. You may bring original documents to your 
hearing. 

12. Signature and Oath 

Your signature must be under oath. You must sign the writ in 
front of the person who is taking your oath. You must also 
clearly print your name and title, if applicable, in the box 
provided. Your oath must be taken at the time you sign the writ, 
and the person who took your oath (the Clerk, a Notary, or a 
Commissioner of the Superior Court) must also sign. Attorneys 
are Commissioners of the Superior Court. 

Keep a copy of all documents for your records.

A SMALL CLAIMS WRIT AND NOTICE OF SUIT

P.B. 24-10

STATE OF CONNECTICUT 
SUPERIOR COURT 
www.jud.ct.gov

To start a small claims case, you must fill out a Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit (form JD-CV-40), and attach copies of 
any related documents you wish to file with the court. Keep the original Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit and attached 
documents. You, or your representative, must then serve (deliver) a copy of the Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit to each 
defendant using one of the four methods listed below. 

1. Service (delivery) by United State Postal Service (USPS) Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation: 

Mail to each defendant via USPS Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation a copy of the Small Claims Writ and Notice of 
Suit, attached documents, and the Instructions to Defendant (form JD-CV-121). For each copy you have mailed, the USPS 
will send you a delivery confirmation. When you receive delivery confirmation, file the original Small Claims Writ and Notice 
of Suit, copies of the attached documents, a Statement of Service (form JD-CV-123) for each defendant, and the delivery 
confirmation(s) with the court. 

2. Service (delivery) by USPS Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested or electronic delivery confirmation: 

Mail  to  each  defendant  via  USPS  Certified  Mail  with  Return  Receipt  Requested  a  copy  of  the  Small  Claims  Writ  and 
Notice  of  Suit,  attached  documents,  and  the  Instructions  to  Defendant.  For  each  copy  you  have  mailed,  the  USPS  will 
send  you  a  return  receipt  slip  or  an  electronic  delivery  confirmation.  When  you  receive  the  signed  return  receipt(s)  or 
electronic delivery confirmation, file the original Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit, copies of the attached documents, a 
Statement of Service for each defendant and the signed return receipt(s) or electronic delivery confirmation with the court.

Claims  Writ  and  Notice  of  Suit,  copies  of  the  attached  documents,  a  Statement  of  Service  for  each  defendant,  and  the 
delivery confirmation(s) with the court.

Defendant. After the proper officer serves (delivers) the Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit, he or she will return the 
original Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit and copies of the attached documents to you, along with his or her return of 
service (a written statement describing how the documents were served) for filing with the court, unless you have arranged 
for the proper officer to file them for you. 

4. Service by a proper officer, such as a state marshal: 

Exceptions: 

Out-of-State Businesses: 

S

For  each  defendant  who  is  an  out-of-state  business  (a  business  organized  under  the  laws  of  a  state  other  than 
Connecticut), you must use Method 4 above, service by a proper officer. 

Out-of-State Insurance Companies: 

There are special requirements for service on (delivery to) out-of-state insurance companies. You can find information on 
these requirements in Chapter 697, Title 38a of the Connecticut General Statutes and through the Connecticut Insurance 
Department website at: www.ct.gov/cid. 

The Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit must be returned to the court not later than one month after the date of 
service (delivery). 

When the court receives the Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit, the clerk will set an answer date and will send a notice to 
all plaintiffs or their representatives of the docket number (case number) and answer date. The clerk will also send an answer 
form that includes the docket number and answer date to each defendant at the addresses provided by the plaintiff.

INSTRUCTIONS TO DEFENDANT 
(NOTICE TO PERSON BEING SUED) 
JD-CV-121   Rev. 2-18

STATE OF CONNECTICUT 
SUPERIOR COURT 
www.jud.ct.gov

Please read the instructions carefully.

For more information, get a copy of How Small Claims Court Works (form JDP-CV-45) from a Clerk's Office, Court 
Service Center or on the Judicial Branch website, at www.jud.ct.gov/publications/CV045. 

You may also find information on the Small Claims Frequently Asked Questions page on the Judicial Branch website at 
www.jud.ct.gov/faq/smallclaims.html or by contacting the clerk's office or a Court Service Center.

What is the Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit (form JD-CV-40) that I have received? 
The person suing you (called the plaintiff) has delivered to you (served on you) a copy of the Small Claims Writ and 
Notice of Suit (form JD-CV-40) and any documents related to your case. The Small Claims Writ and Notice of Suit 
contains the plaintiff's complaint, which explains how much money the plaintiff claims you owe them and the reasons 
why the they think you owe them. 

How do I defend my case? 
In order to respond to the plaintiff's complaint, you must complete an Answer form and return it to court. The court will 
send you an Answer form. The Answer form will tell you the court house where you must return the form and the 
date by which you must return it. 
You should receive an Answer form within six (6) weeks, but if you do not, call the clerk's office to ask why you have 
not received it yet. Do not file a response until you receive an Answer form. 
The Answer form contains an Answer section, where you respond to the plaintiff's claims, and a Counterclaim section, 
where you can make claims against the plaintiff. The Answer section must be completed. It is up to you whether you 
complete the Counterclaim. There is a fee for filing a counterclaim, which is discussed below. 

How do I respond to the plaintiff's claims?  - Filing an Answer 
The Answer is your chance to respond or reply to the plaintiff's claim. You may admit or deny all or part of the plaintiff's 
claim. Your Answer should be specific, but brief. Complete the form and sign it. Keep a copy for yourself and send a 
copy to each attorney or other representative of the plaintiff or, if the plaintiff is representing themselves, send a copy 
to the plaintiff. If you are not filing a Counterclaim, send the original Answer form to the court at the address listed on 
the form by mail, fax or hand delivery. The court must receive your Answer form on or before the Answer Date. If 
you are filing a Counterclaim, see the discussion on Counterclaims, below. 

P L E

What if I know I owe the plaintiff some money? 
If you know you owe the plaintiff something, but do not agree on the amount in the claim or are not sure how much you 
owe, you should file an Answer. This gives you a chance to come to court for a hearing (also called a trial) to question 
how the plaintiff added up the amount claim or to say why you think the amount should be different. 

What if I admit that I owe the plaintiff all of the money they are asking for but want time to pay? 
If you are sure that you owe the entire amount claimed by the plaintiff but want or need more time to pay, you may say 
this on the Answer form and file it with the court. You may ask for a period of time during which you can make 
payments in an amount that you suggest. If you ask for more time, but do not ask for a specific time period or amount, 
the court will enter a judgment with an order of payments of $35 each week until the judgment is paid. If you ask to pay 
less than $35 per week, and the plaintiff does not agree, a hearing will be scheduled. A judgment against a business 
and a judgment against a landlord for return of a security deposit will be ordered to be paid in a lump sum. 

M

A

What if I pay the full amount plus costs, if any, before the Answer Date? 
If you pay the plaintiff, plaintiff's representative, or plaintiff's attorney the full amount of the claim plus costs, if any, 
before the Answer Date, you should say that on the Answer form and file it with the court.  
Do not send payment(s) to the Court. 

What should I do if the plaintiff owes me money?  - Filing a Counterclaim 
If you claim that the plaintiff owes you money, you may wish to file a Counterclaim. First, you should complete the 
Answer portion of the Answer form. Then you may complete the Counterclaim section of the Answer form. In that 
section, explain why you think the plaintiff owes you money and how much money you claim the plaintiff owes you. 
When you have completed the form, sign it. Keep a copy for yourself and send a copy to each attorney or other 
representative of the plaintiff or, if the plaintiff is representing themselves, send a copy to the plaintiff. Send the original 
Answer form to the court at the address listed on the form by mail or hand delivery along with a filing fee of $95. The 
court must receive your answer form on or before the answer date. You cannot fax a Counterclaim and its 
filing fee to the court.

S

45

What happens if I do not file an Answer? 
If you do not file an Answer in writing with the court, a money judgment may be entered against you. This is called a 
default judgment. After the Answer Date has passed, your case will be reviewed by a Magistrate, who will decide 
whether a judgment should enter without a hearing or if a hearing must be scheduled. The Magistrate may award the 
plaintiff the full amount of their claim, plus court costs. 

What happens if I file an Answer? Will I have a trial? 
If you file an Answer, the Court will schedule a hearing (also called a trial), if one is required. The court will send you 
a notice letting you know exactly when and where your case will be heard. Do not come to court for a hearing 
on the Answer Date listed on the Answer form. Cases are scheduled for hearing as quickly as possible. 

What happens if I file a Counterclaim? Will I have a trial? 
If you file a Counterclaim with your Answer, a notice will be sent to you and the plaintiff letting everyone know that a 
Counterclaim has been filed and telling the plaintiff when they must file their Answer to the Counterclaim. After the 
Counterclaim Answer Date has passed, the court will schedule a hearing (also called a trial), if one is required. The 
court will send you a notice letting you know exactly when and where your case will be heard. Do not come to 
court for a hearing on the Answer Date listed on the Answer form. Cases are scheduled for hearing as quickly as 
possible. 

What do I need to bring to Court for my hearing (trial)? 
On the day of your hearing, you should bring all of your witnesses and any evidence you have. This may include bills, 
invoices, checks, damage estimates, pictures or other documents. Evidence may also include any defective or 
damaged goods that can be brought safely and easily into the court. Be prepared and organized so that you can 
present your complete case. A small claims judgment cannot be appealed.

Do not file the interrogatories, the notice of interrogatories or the objections to the interrogatories with the court. 
The person who received these interrogatories must answer and return them within 30 days of the date of their service 
(delivery) to the person named above. 

If the person who received these interrogatories does not answer and return them within 30 days or does not within 30 days 
disclose assets of the judgment debtor that are enough for execution, or if the person who received the interrogatories objects 
within 30 days, the judgment creditor may ask the court for additional discovery orders that may be necessary to make sure 
that disclosure is made including (1) an order for compliance with the interrogatories or (2) an order authorizing additional 
interrogatories. The judgment creditor may ask for and get discovery, including the taking of depositions, from any person 
served with interrogatories under the procedures for discovery in civil actions without the court ordering it. The court may 
order additional discovery as justice requires. If the person asked for discovery does not disclose the judgment debtor's 
assets, that person may be held in contempt of court. Attorney's fees may be allowed for counsel at a contempt hearing 
necessary to enforce a court order and for counsel at any discovery hearing required because these interrogatories were not 
answered.

Important Notice To Employer
You are being served with a wage execution, a court order requiring you to withhold non-exempt wages from a person employed by you. This execution is being served on you 
because your employee, the Judgment Debtor (on page 1), has had a judgment entered against him/her by the Superior Court requiring him/her to pay judgment, costs and fees to 
the Judgment Creditor (on page 1) and has not made payment of the total amount of the judgment plus any costs and fees as shown on page 1. This notice is to inform you of the 
actions you must take in order to comply with the law regarding wage executions. Please read each section carefully.

executions are to be satisfied in the order in which you are served with them. (Income 
withholdings and voluntary wage deductions for support of a family, if there are any, 
must be paid before this execution. Family support income withholdings and voluntary 
wage deductions are issued on Form JD-FM-1.) 

V.  Maximum  amount  deducted  —  The  maximum  amount  which  can  be  legally 
withheld from your employee's wages is 25% of his/her disposable earnings for each 
week. The amount to be withheld to pay this execution may be less than 25%, but it 
can never be more. The computations you complete below will allow you to calculate 
the exact amount which should be withheld from this employee's wages. 

Unless  the  court  orders  that  this  execution  is  to  be  for  a  smaller  amount,  you  must 
withhold  and  pay  over  the  maximum  amount  which  you  figure  out  using  the 
computations  below.  Your  employee  has  a  right  to  request  the  court  to  reduce  the 
amount  withheld,  but  until  you  receive  notice  that  the  court  has  agreed  to  allow  the 
amount to be reduced, you must withhold the maximum amount. 

VI.  Your  duty  to  comply  with  this  execution  —  You  have  a  legal  duty  to  make 
deductions from your employee's wages and pay any amounts deducted as required 
by  this  execution.  If  you  do  not,  legal  action  may  be  taken  against  you.  If  you  are 
found  to  be  in  contempt  of  a  court  order,  you  may  be  held  liable  to  the  Judgment 
Creditor for the amounts of wages which you did not withhold from your employee. 

VII.  Discipline  against  your  employee  —  You  may  not  discipline,  suspend  or 
discharge your employee because this wage execution has been served upon you. If 
you do unlawfully take action against your employee, you may be liable to pay  him all 
of his lost earnings and employment benefits from the time of your action to the time 
that the employee is reinstated. 

The  law  allows  you  to  take  disciplinary  measures  against  the  employee  if  you  are 
served with more than 7 wage executions against his/her wages in any calendar year.

I. You must notify the employee —  Your employee has certain legal rights which 
may allow him/her to request the court to change or stop this execution upon his/her 
wages. A notice of his/her rights and how  to get a hearing in court is attached to the 
second copy of the  wage execution given to you by the officer. You must complete 
your portion of the wage execution and your portion of the exemption and modification 
claim  form  and    deliver  or  mail,  postage  prepaid,  a  copy  of  these  papers  to  your 
employee immediately  so that your employee can make any claims allowed by law. 

II. Execution not effective for 20 days —  This execution is not effective until after 
20  days  from  the  day  the  officer  served  these  papers  on  you.  No  money  should  be 
deducted from your employee's wages until the first wages you pay to your employee 
after  the  20-day  period  ends.  If  your  employee  elects  within  the  20-day  period  to 
make  a  claim  to  the  court  that  his/her  wages  are  partially  or  totally  exempt  from 
execution to pay this judgment or he/she seeks to have the amount of this execution 
changed, wages are not to be withheld from the employee until the court decides the 
claims or determines the rights of your employee in this case. If you are not notified 
that  your  employee  has  filed  papers  with  the  court,  the  execution  is  to  be  enforced 
after 20 days from the date of service on you. 

III. Stay of execution  — No earnings claimed to be exempt or subject to a claim for 
modification  may  be  withheld  from  any  employee  until  determination  of  the  claim  by 
the court. 

IV. Only one execution issued under section 52-361a of the General Statutes is 
to be satisfied at a time  — You must make deductions from your employee's wages 
and  pay  over  the  withheld  money  against  only  one  execution  issued  under  General 
Statutes  section  52-361a  at  a  time.  If  you  are  served  with  more  than  one  execution 
issued under General Statutes section 52-361a against this employee's wages, the

Section IV - Notice to judgment debtor (person who must pay money)

Because a judgment entered against you, the attached execution has been issued against wages earned by you from the employer 
named above. Beginning twenty (20) days from the Date of Service of Wage Execution on Employer indicated above, the employer will 
remove from your weekly earnings an amount of money which leaves you with (a) seventy-five percent (75%) of your disposable earnings 
OR (b) forty (40) times the higher of the minimum hourly wage set by federal law or state law; whichever is the larger amount. On page 2 of 
this form are the sections of the Connecticut General Statutes which your employer must follow to figure out (calculate) the weekly amount 
that may be taken out of your wages to agree with the wage execution. If you think that your employer has not calculated the weekly 
amount correctly, you should tell your employer. 

Your earnings may be exempt from execution (do not have to be taken)  — Any wages earned by a person who gets public 
assistance under an incentive earnings or similar program are exempt from (may not be taken from you) execution. (Section 52-352b(d) of 
the Connecticut General Statutes). 

How to claim an exemption allowed by law  — If you want to claim that your earnings are exempt by law from execution you must fill 

out and sign the Claim of Exemption on page 2 of this form and return this exemption and modification claim form to the Superior Court at 
the above address. 

When the clerk of the Superior Court gets this form, the clerk will notify you and the judgment creditor of the date on which the court will 
have a hearing to figure out the issues raised by your claim. If this form is received by the court no later than twenty (20) days from the Date 
of Service of Wage Execution on Employer indicated above, the employer will not begin withholding  (removing) your earnings from your 
wages until after your claim is figured out by the court. A claim may also be filed after the twenty (20) day period. No earnings claimed to be 
exempt may be withheld from any employee until the claim has been figured out. 

Modification of execution  — If you have reasonable cause to believe that you have a right to a modification (change) of the wage 
execution and you want to ask for a modification (to have less money taken from your wages), you must fill out the Claim for Modification on 
page 2 of this form and return this exemption and modification claim form to the Superior Court 
at the address listed above.

General Statutes
1. The following is the part of section 52-361a(f) of the Connecticut General Statutes which says what part of your wages can be removed by the employer 
and given to the judgment creditor. 

"The maximum part of the aggregate weekly earnings of an individual which may be subject under this section to levy or other withholding for payment of 
a judgment is the lesser of (1) twenty-five (25) percent of his disposable earnings for that week, or (2) the amount by which his disposable earnings for that 
week exceed forty (40) times the higher of (A) the minimum hourly wage prescribed by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. 
Section 206(a)(1), or (B) the full minimum fair wage established by subsection (i) of section 31-58, in effect at the time the earnings are payable." 

2. The following is the part of section 52-350a(4) of the Connecticut General Statutes which defines disposable earnings and which defines what parts of 
your wages which can not be included in your total earnings when figuring out (calculating) the weekly amount which is subject to execution. 

"'Disposable earnings' means that part of the earnings of an individual remaining after the deduction from those earnings of amounts required to be 

withheld for payment of federal income and employment taxes, normal retirement contributions, union dues and initiation fees, group life insurance 
premiums, health insurance premiums and federal tax levies."

Section 4 — Notice To Judgment Debtor

As a result of a judgment entered against you the attached execution has been issued against your personal property. 
Some of your personal property may be exempt from execution — Certain classes of personal property may be protected 
from execution by state statutes or other laws or regulations of this state or of the United States. A checklist and description of 
the most common classes of personal property of a natural person exempt from execution are listed on page 2 of this form. 
How to claim an exemption established by law — If you want to claim that the property levied on by the levying officer is 

exempt by law from execution you must fill out and sign the Claim of Exemption on page 2 of this form and return this 
exemption claim form to the clerk of the Superior court at the address above. The form must be received by the clerk of 
the Superior Court within 20 days after levy on the property. 

Upon receipt of this form, the court clerk will send you and the judgment creditor the date of the court hearing on your 

claim. 

Right to request installment payment order — If you are a consumer judgment debtor, you may seek to have the court 
issue an installment payment order with a provision that compliance with the order prevents a levy on your property. (Section 
52-356d of the Connecticut General Statutes.) An installment payment order is a court order that you pay a weekly amount to 
the judgment creditor until the judgment is satisfied. 

"Consumer Judgment" means a money judgment of less than $5,000 against a natural person resulting from a debt or 

obligation incurred primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. 

Setting aside the judgment — If the judgment was rendered against you because you did not come to court, you may ask 

the court to set aside the judgment rendered against you within four months of the date judgment was rendered and upon 
belief that you have reasonable cause. (Section 52-212 of the Connecticut General Statutes.)

Financial Institution Execution
To any proper officer, 
Whereas on said Date of Judgment the above-named Judgment Creditor(s) recovered judgment against the above-named Judgment Debtor(s) before the above-
named court for the amount of judgment, costs and fees stated above, as appears of record, whereof execution remains to be done.  
These are, therefore, by authority of the state of Connecticut to command you: 
Within seven days from your receipt of this execution, make demand upon the main office of any financial institution having its main office within your county, or if such 
main office is not within your county and such financial institution has one or more branch offices within your county, upon an employee of such a branch office, such 
employee and such branch office having been designated by the financial institution in accordance with regulations adopted by the commissioner of banking, for 
payment to you pursuant to section 52-367b(b) of the General Statutes of any nonexempt debt due said Judgment Debtor(s), which sum shall not exceed the total 
unpaid judgment, costs and fees as stated above, plus postjudgment interest as ordered by the court, if applicable, plus the application fee and other court ordered 
postjudgment costs and fees and your own fee. After having made such demand you are directed to serve a true and attested copy of this execution, together with the 
attached affidavit and exemption claim form, with your doings endorsed thereon, with the financial institution officer upon whom such demand was made.  Said sum 
shall be received by you and applied on this execution in accordance with the provisions of section 52-367b of the General Statutes. You shall not serve more than one 
financial institution execution per judgment debtor at a time, including copies thereof. After service of an execution on one 
financial institution, you shall not serve the same execution or a copy  thereof upon another financial institution until receiving 
confirmation from the preceding financial institution that the judgment debtor had insufficient funds at the preceding financial  
institution available for collection to satisfy the execution, provided any such additional service is made not later than forty-five 
days from the receipt by you of such execution. After service of an execution, you shall not serve the same execution or a  
copy thereof upon such financial institution if an electronic direct deposit from a readily identifiable source described in  
section 52 -376b (c) of the General Statutes was made to the judgment debtor's account within the look-back period  
described in section 52 -376b (c) of the General Statues (sixty days or, with regard to federal benefits, such greater period as 
required by federal law). If no such deposit was made, you may subsequently serve the same execution or a copy thereof  
upon such institution, provided the execution has not expired or otherwise become unenforceable.
Hereof fail not, and make due return of this writ with your doings thereon, according to law.

ordered postjudgment costs or fees and the serving officer's fee, before your midnight deadline, as defined in section 42a-4-104 of the

the Exemption Claim Form or notice of exemption or a secured party claim notice to the clerk of the court, you must return the funds to 
the judgment debtor's account. 

S

secured  party  of  the  execution  and  Exemption  Claim  Form  you  must,  upon  demand,  forthwith  pay  the  serving  officer  the  amount 
removed from the judgment debtor's account. 

6. If no exemption claim or secured party claim notice is filed or if the court orders you to pay the serving officer an amount removed from 
the judgment debtor's account not exceeding the amount due on the execution and you fail or refuse to do so, you shall be liable in an 
action therefor to the judgement creditor(s) named in the execution for the amount of nonexempt monies which you fail or refuse to pay

the General Statutes, you shall be liable in an action therefor to the judgment debtor for any exempt monies so paid. If you pay exempt 
monies  from  the  account  of  the  judgment  debtor  contrary  to  these  instructions,  or  the  provisions  of  section  52-367b  of  the  General 
Statutes, you shall be liable in an action therefor to the judgment debtor for any exempt monies so paid and you shall refund or waive 
any charges of fees by you, including, but not limited to, dishonored check fees, overdraft fees or minimum balance service charges and

Note Regarding Exemption for Alimony and Support 
Alimony and Support, other than child support, are exempt only to the following extent: 
The amount of alimony and support, other than child support, that may be subject to levy or other withholding for payment of a judgment is 
the lesser of (1) twenty-five percent of the individual's disposable earnings for that week, or (2) the amount by which the individual's 
disposable earnings for that week exceed forty times the higher of (A) the federal minimum hourly wage under Section 6(a)(1) of the Fair 
Labor Standards Act of 1938, U.S.C. Title 29, Section 206(a)(1), or (B), the state minimum hourly wage under subsection (i) of Section 
31-58, in effect at the time the earnings are payable.

Financial Institution Execution
To Any Proper Officer, 
Whereas on said Date of Judgment the above-named Judgment Creditor(s) recovered judgment against the above-named Judgment 
Debtor(s) before the above-named court for the amount of judgment, costs and fees stated above, as appears of record, whereof execution 
remains to be done. These are, therefore, by authority of the State of Connecticut to command you: 

Make demand upon the main office of any financial institution having its main office within your county, or if such main office is not within 
your county and such financial institution has one or more branch offices within your county, upon an employee of such a branch office, 
such employee and such branch office having been designated by the financial institution in accordance with regulations adopted by the 
commissioner of banking, for payment to you of any debt due said Judgment Debtor(s), which sum shall not exceed the total unpaid 
judgment, costs and fees as stated above, plus post judgment interest as ordered by the court, if applicable, plus the application fee and 
other court ordered postjudgment costs and fees, and your own fees. Said sum shall be received by you and applied on this execution. 
After having made such demand you are directed to serve a true and attested copy hereof, with your doings thereon endorsed, with the 
financial institution officer upon whom such demand was made. You shall not serve more than one financial institution execution per 
judgment debtor at a time, including copies thereof. After service of an execution on one financial institution, you shall not serve the same 
execution or a copy thereof upon another financial institution until receiving confirmation from the preceding financial institution that the 
judgment debtor had insufficient funds at the preceding financial institution available for collection to satisfy the execution. If you do not 
receive within twenty-five days of the service of the demand a response from the financial institution that was served indicating whether or 
not the judgment debtor has funds at the financial institution available for collection, you may 
assume that sufficient funds are not available for collection and you may proceed to serve 
another financial institution in accordance with section 52-367a of the General Statutes.

For Court Use Only

Hereof fail not, and make due return of this writ with your doings thereon,
according to law.

Instructions To Financial Institution Upon Receipt Of A Financial Institution 
Execution When Judgment Debtor is Not A Natural Person

1. You must remove from the judgment debtor's account the amount of any debts due from you to the judgment debtor not exceeding the 
Total  Amount  Unpaid  as  appears  on  page  1  of  this  form,  plus  interest  and  the  Application  Fee  for  Financial  Institution  Execution  and 
court ordered postjudgment costs or fees and the serving officer's fee. 

2.  Except  as  provided  in  #4  below,  you  must  immediately  pay  to  the  serving  officer  the  amount  removed  from  the  judgment  debtor's 
account. Nothing herein shall be construed to affect any other rights or obligations of the financial institution with regard to the funds in 
the judgment debtor's account. 

3. You must act on this execution according to section 42a-4-303 of the general statutes, before your midnight deadline. 

4. If the deposit account is subject to a security interest of a secured party, other than you, pursuant to a control agreement between you 
and such secured party under article 9 of title 42a, and if any funds removed from the judgment debtor's account pursuant to subsection 
(c)  of  section  52-367a  of  the  general  statutes  you  shall  forthwith  mail  a  copy  of  the  execution  when  received  from  the  serving  officer, 
postage prepaid, to the judgment debtor and to such other secured party at the last known address of such parties  with respect to the 
affected accounts on your records. You shall hold the amount removed from the judgment debtor's account for twenty days from the date 
of the mailing to the judgment debtor and such other secured party, and during such period you shall not pay the serving officer. Such 
other secured party shall give notice of its prior perfected security interest in such deposit account, by delivering to the clerk of the court 
that issued the execution a written claim for determination of interests in property pursuant to section 52-365c and by delivering a copy of 
such claim to the financial institution upon which such execution is served. 

5. If a written claim for determination of interests in property is made pursuant to subsection (e) of section 52-367a of the general statutes, 
you shall continue to hold the amount removed from the judgment debtor's account until a court order is received regarding disposition of 
the funds. If no written claim for determination of interests in property is made you shall, upon demand, forthwith pay the serving officer 
the  amount  removed  from  the  judgment  debtor's  account,  and  the  serving  officer  shall  thereupon  pay  such  sum,  less  such  serving 
officer's fees, to the judgment creditor, except to the extent otherwise ordered by a court.
