 CONFIDENTIAL 

 

 

 Instructions: 1) An adult relative may use this form to petition for the appointment of an immediate temporary custodian of 

a minor child, if a petition for: a) removal of guardian, b) termination of parental rights, or c) appointment of a 
guardian of a minor child who has no guardian has been filed with the court. This form may also be used by an 
attorney for a minor child or by an adult who is not a relative, but who has actual physical custody of the minor 
child at the time the petition is filed.
2)The petition should be filed in the court for the probate district in which the minor child resides, is domiciled, or is 
located at the time of filing the petition. If the petitioner is requesting immediate temporary custody pending 
termination of parental rights, the petition may also be filed where the petitioner resides.
3)A Custodian’s  Affidavit/Immediate Temporary Custody, PC-510, must be filed with the petition unless the minor 
child is in the custody of a parent and is hospitalized with a serious injury or illness, and the parent is refusing  or 
unable to consent to treatment. In this case, a Physician’s Certificate/Immediate Temporary Custody, PC-550, must be 
filed instead of the PC-510. In addition, a birth certificate (long form) and JD-FM-164, Affidavit Concerning Children, 
should be filed with the petition. Also file Confidential Sheet, PC-501CI, with confidential social security numbers.
4)Contact the court regarding payment of service of process and, if applicable, payment of newspaper notice 
publication.
5)For more information, see C.G.S. sections 45a-607, 45a-603 et seq., 45a-706 et seq., 46b-115 et seq. and 52-231a.

The petitioner represents that: 

C O N N  E C T I C U T  PR O B A  T E  C O U R  T S

 CONFIDENTIAL 

A petition is pending in this court for the removal of one or both parents as guardians or for the removal of the 
guardian of the minor child; OR 

A petition is pending in this court for the termination of parental rights with respect to the minor child; OR 

The petitioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the minor child has no guardian of his or her person, and a 
petition for appointment of a guardian is pending.   

The petitioner further represents that: 

The minor child is in the current physical care of a person other than the parent or other guardian, subject to the 
petition for removal of guardianship or termination of parental rights. (If this box is checked, Custodian’s 
Affidavit, PC-510, must be filed with this petition.) 

   AND 

The child was not taken or kept from the parents or guardians, AND there is a substantial likelihood that 
the child will be removed from this jurisdiction prior to a hearing for temporary custody; OR 

To return the child to the parents or guardians would place the child in circumstances that would result in 
serious physical illness or injury, or the threat thereof, or imminent physical danger prior to a hearing for 
temporary custody; OR 

The minor child is hospitalized as a result of serious physical illness or serious physical injury and is in need 
of immediate medical or surgical treatment, the delay of which would be life-threatening, AND the parents or 
guardians refuse to consent or are unable to consent to such treatment. (If this box is checked, Physician's 
Certificate/Immediate Temporary Custody, PC-550, from two physicians must be filed with this petition.)

unable to consent to such treatment. (If this box is checked, Physician's  Certificate/Immediate Temporary 
Custody, PC-550, from two physicians must be filed with this petition.) 

The petitioner further represents that the parents or other guardians have performed acts of omission or commission as 
set forth in C.G.S. section 45a-610: 

The minor child has been abandoned by the parents or guardians in the sense that the parents or guardians have 
failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest, concern, or responsibility for the child’s welfare.   

The minor child has been denied the care, guidance, or control necessary for his or her physical, educational, 
moral, or emotional well-being as defined by law.  

The minor child has had physical injuries inflicted upon him or her by a person responsible for such child’s health, 
welfare, or care, or by a person given access to such child by such responsible person, other than by accidental 
means, or has injuries which are at variance with the history given of them or is in a condition which is the result of 
maltreatment such as, but not limited to, malnutrition, sexual molestation, deprivation of necessities, emotional 
maltreatment, or cruel punishment.   

The minor child has been neglected or uncared for, as defined in C.G.S. section 46b-120. 

AND BECAUSE OF SUCH ACTS, THE CHILD IS SUFFERING FROM SERIOUS PHYSICAL ILLNESS, SERIOUS 
PHYSICAL INJURY, OR THE IMMEDIATE THREAT THEREOF, OR IS IN IMMEDIATE PHYSICAL DANGER.
