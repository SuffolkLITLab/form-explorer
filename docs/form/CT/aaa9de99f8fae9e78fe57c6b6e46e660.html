      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found:  (Page 1 of 2) Length of delinquency (if applicable) Delinquency NOTICE AND CLAIM FORM SUPPORT INCOME WITHHOLDING JD FM 68 Rev. 11 12 . C. G. S. § 46 b 231, 52 362 Delinquency Š If the "Delinquency" box above is checked, you are past due on the payments that you owe under a support order. The amount you are past due is shown above. The amount is greater than or equal to what you are supposed to pay for 30 days of support plus any other amounts that added up until the date the withholding order went into effect. Withholding Order Š There is a withholding order against your income (income may include Unemployment Compensation) . The withholding order applies to any current employer or period of employment or any future employer or period of employment. The withholding order makes sure the money you owe now, money you haven't paid in the past, and any other money the court may decide you owe in the future, is paid. Asking For A Court Hearing Š You have 15 days from when you received this notice to ask for a hearing in the superior court or in the family support magistrate division. If you want a hearing, fill out the claim form on page 2 of this notice and return it to the court or family support magistrate division at the above address. You must do this within 15 days after you received this notice. At the hearing, you can argue that you do not owe any money, are not past due on any money you owe, or should not have money taken from your pay or income. You can also ask the court to change the withholding order. Not All Of Your Income Can Be Withheld Š The only money that may be taken out of your pay for support is the money that is left after you pay required federal, state and local income taxes, employment taxes, normal retirement contributions, union dues and initiation fees and group life and health insurance premiums. and only some of the leftover money can be taken out. Having other dependents (or not) and being past due on your support payments can affect the amount withheld. The chart below shows how much can be taken from your pay after money is taken out for required federal, state and local income taxes, employment taxes, normal retirement contributions, union dues and initiation fees and group life and health insurance premiums. You can tell the court that money is being taken out of your pay for required federal, state and local income taxes, employment taxes, normal retirement contributions, union dues and initiation fees and group life and health insurance premiums. You can also tell the court about other state or federal exemptions that apply to income withholding orders. Modification Of Support Order Š You also have a right to ask to have your support order changed or to tell the court that there should not be a support order. This is different from asking the court to change or decide you should not have a withholding order. You can do this by filing a separate motion (form JD FM 174) with the court or family support magistrate division. You must pay a fee when the motion is filed although in some cases the court may decide that you do not have to pay the fee.
