Educational Advocacy for children in foster care and/or juvenile justice system

CENTER FOR CHILDREN’S ADVOCACY

Give a short (1-paragraph) case example

Who provides the training?

Johnny is 12 and is in foster care. He is failing all 
his courses and did poorly on the mastery tests, 
in part because he has been moving from school

school system has properly identified him or given 
him what he is legally entitled to.

Staff at the Center.

the training last?

At U. of Ct. School of Law... one day.

When is the next training (after October 1) 
and how often is training offered?

Does this pro bono work require full 
admission to practice in Connecticut?

Not yet scheduled.

Yes.

Can the training be attended remotely 
(webinar or teleconference)?

If it is important that a pro bono lawyer 
already have particular legal background or 
training please describe.

No.

THE CHILDREN’S LAW CENTER OF CT, INC.

NAME OF NON-PROFIT AGENCY
The Children’s Law Center 
of CT, Inc.

NAME OF PRO BONO PROJECT  
OR OPPORTUNITY
The Truancy Intervention 
Project

Who are the clients?

Middle school-aged children who are experiencing 
problems with school attendance. 

What legal problem do these clients face?

Potential for filing of a Family With Services  
Needs petition.

What legal strategies do the pro bono 
lawyers use to assist the clients?

Attorneys have three major roles:

1)  Prioritizing the importance of education as 
a role model to, and advocate for, the child 
in matters related to or affecting school 
attendance.

2)  Problem solver for the family assisting in 

identifying and utilizing community resources.

3)  Representing the child in truancy and  

related proceedings.

What are the outcome goals of this 
assistance?

Improvement in child’s school attendance. 

Why is this assistance important to  
these clients?

High school drop-outs have a higher incidence 
of incarceration and are more likely to be life-
long victims of poverty than their graduating 
peers. Educators report that the best predictor of 

whether a student will become a drop-out is their 
history of school attendance. Truancy is frequently 
an early warning signal of stress affecting their 
family, and also their first encounter with the 
judicial system. The Project matches middle 
school-aged students with attorney volunteers 
who provide early intervention before truancy-
related problems become intractable. 

What time commitment is required to do this 
pro bono work ?

Weekly contact with the child totaling 3-4 hours 
or more per month, much of which will be outside 
normal work hours.

Where is the pro bono work done? (at a  
legal aid office, at the pro bono attorney’s 
office, etc.)?

Locations are determined by volunteer and child 
(with parental consent). For example: the library, 
the child’s school/home. 

If the pro bono attorney will be appearing 
for the client, in what court or other forum is 
that appearance?

Juvenile Court.

At what time of day is the pro bono work 
done (evening clinic, etc.)

The times are arranged through mutual 
agreement between the volunteer and the child.

Case example

Anna, age fourteen, had 17 unexcused absences 
when she entered the Truancy Project. As 
her attorney volunteer got to know Anna and 
her family, it was discovered that Anna was 
responsible for waking herself up in the morning 
for school. Certainly not an unreasonable 
responsibility for someone her age, but there 
was no alarm clock, no clock radio and no person 
in the morning at home to wake Anna on time. 
Anna’s volunteer decided to touch base with 
her every day in addition to their weekly time 
together. So every morning the volunteer called 

6

The Truancy Intervention Project

THE CHILDREN’S LAW CENTER OF CT, INC.

High school drop-outs have a higher incidence of 
incarceration and are more likely to be life-long victims 
of poverty than their graduating peers.

Anna  at 7 a.m. (to wake her up) wished her a 
great day at school, and through brief discussion 
encouraged her to make good choices (i.e. to get 
to school on time), and reminded her to take her 
medication (for ADHD). The arrangement had a 
profound effect on the child’s attendance. 

Does this pro bono work require full 
admission to practice in Connecticut?

Yes.

If no:  how are those without full admission 
partnered and supervised to ensure avoidance of 
issues regarding unlicensed practice? The Truancy 
Intervention Project has experienced attorney 
volunteers who will supervise if the person is not 
fully admitted. 

If it is important that a pro bono lawyer 
already have particular legal background or 
training please describe. 

The program is designed to be comfortable for 
attorneys who are not litigators, have little or 
no courtroom experience and are not seeking a 
volunteer experience in a courtroom setting. 

What training is provided to pro bono 
lawyers doing this work?

Training topics include special education law, 
understanding issues of culture and poverty, 
learning about community and state services 
available to clients and their families, and 
procedures in Family with Service Needs cases. 
In addition, non-compulsory supplemental 

training on such topics as mentoring and 
adolescent psychological development is offered. 
We also have experts in areas such as special 
education law, juvenile law, benefits law, and 
child protection, who serve as resources to our 
volunteers. Consultants are available to provide 
assistance with identifying available social service 
programs.

Who provides the training?

Training is delivered by attorneys and other 
service providers who are designated as subject 
matter experts.

Where is the training held? How long does 
the training last?

Training is on a Saturday at the CBA in New 
Britain. Training is for six hours.

When is the next training (after October 1) 
and how often is training offered?

Next training is October 22, 2011. Training is 
offered annually in the fall.

Can the training be attended remotely 
(webinar or teleconference)?

Not as yet.

Who are the clients?

Low income adults who are or are perceived to 
have a psychiatric disability.

Depends upon cases.

What are the outcome goals of this 
assistance?

CLRP seeks to both protect the individual civil 
rights of clients and promote systemic change 
to dispel the stigma and discrimination against 
persons with mental illness.

Why is this assistance important to  
these clients?

Housing and employment are fundamental to the 
stability and recovery of our clients, and their 
ability to be self-sufficient and participate as full 
members of the community.

What time commitment is required to do this 
pro bono work ?

Where is the pro bono work done? (at a  
legal aid office, at the pro bono attorney’s 
office, etc.)?

Private attorney’s office.

CLRP seeks to both 
protect the individual 
civil rights of clients and 
promote systemic change

discrimination against 
persons with mental 
illness.

CONNECTICUT LEGAL RIGHTS PROJECT, INC.

NAME OF NON-PROFIT AGENCY
Connecticut Legal Rights 
Project, Inc.

NAME OF PRO BONO PROJECT  
OR OPPORTUNITY
Co-Counsel for Civil Rights

What legal problem do these clients face?

In addition to the challenges imposed by poverty, 
our clients regularly encounter discrimination, 
particularly in housing and employment.

Who are the adverse parties (if any) for this 
type of work (e.g. landlords, spouses, banks, 
government entities)?  

Generally, landlords and private employers and 
some state agencies, such as Department of 
Mental Health and Addiction Services and the 
Bureau of Rehabilitative Services.

What legal strategies do the pro bono 
lawyers use to assist the clients?

CLRP is seeking co-counsel for litigation. Cases 
are usually based on state and federal fair housing 
statutes and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 
but also raise related civil rights claims, such as 
Section1983 and constitutional issues.

The Equal Protection Clause of the Connecticut 
Constitution explicitly protects persons with 
physical and psychiatric disabilities.

Co-Counsel for Civil Rights

CONNECTICUT LEGAL RIGHTS PROJECT, INC.

Housing and employment are fundamental to the 
stability and recovery of our clients, and their ability  
to be self-sufficient and participate as full members of 
the community.

If the pro bono attorney will be appearing 
for the client, in what court or other forum is 
that appearance?

If it is important that a pro bono lawyer 
already have particular legal background or 
training please describe. 

Most often, federal court.

At what time of day is the pro bono work 
done (evening clinic, etc.)

Depends upon nature of the collaboration.

Give a short (1-paragraph) case example

A client has been denied services from a job 
training agency because it has determined that 
the person cannot benefit from their services, but 
did not follow federally mandated procedures for 
making such a determination. 

Does this pro bono work require full 
admission to practice in Connecticut?

Yes.

Litigation experience is critical, and a familiarity 
with civil rights is helpful.

What training is provided to pro bono 
lawyers doing this work?

There is no specific training, but CLRP’s Legal 
Director would be actively involved as co-counsel.

CONNECTICUT LEGAL SERVICES, INC., GREATER HARTFORD LEGAL AID, INC.,  
NEW HAVEN LEGAL ASSISTANCE ASSOCIATION, INC.

What are the outcome goals of  
this assistance?

The primary goal of all of the assistance we 
provide is the resolution of the client’s problem.

Why is this assistance important to  
these clients?

We provide access to justice. Without our legal 
counsel and representation, the promise of 
“justice for all” is an empty phrase. Many low-
income people are unable to represent themselves 
adequately in legal matters or even recognize 
that their problem has a legal component for 
which they can obtain assistance. We help them 
make informed decisions, resolve their civil legal 
problem, and provide them with the necessary 
information to take action in the future.  

What time commitment is required to do this 
pro bono work ?

Minimum of one day/week to volunteer in-office.

Where is the pro bono work done? (at a  
legal aid office, at the pro bono attorney’s 
office, etc.)? 

CLS has service offices in Willimantic, New 
London, New Britain, Waterbury, Bridgeport and 
Stamford.

Greater Hartford Legal Aid has its office in 
Hartford.

New Haven Legal Assistance Association has its 
office in New Haven.

If the pro bono attorney will be appearing 
for the client, in what court or other forum is 
that appearance?

Varies depending on the individual case. 

At what time of day is the pro bono work 
done (evening clinic, etc.)

Normal business hours.

abusive spouses.

What legal strategies do the pro bono

Give a short (1-paragraph) case example

Some in-house volunteers are trained and 
supervised to handle federal disability benefit 
appeals. Others help elderly clients with nursing 
home or consumer problems. Others represent 
people being evicted from their apartments who 
have defenses to the eviction; others represent 
victims of domestic violence.

John and Katherine are an elderly married couple 
and their only sources of income are John’s 
pension and social security, which are deposited 
into a joint bank account. When a judge ordered 
Katherine to pay a debt from years earlier, the 
creditor executed on the couple’s joint bank 
account. Katherine filled out a form to have the 
income from John’s pension and social security 
payments—the couple’s only income—exempt 
from the execution as specified by law. They were 
granted a hearing. The judge at the hearing asked 
a lawyer in the courtroom to help the creditor 
and Katherine and John come to an agreement. 
Under the agreement, Katherine and John 
agreed to pay over $1,500 plus additional fees. 
Feeling that this agreement was unfair, John and 
Katherine contacted CLS for guidance. Their CLS 
attorney reviewed their case, and helped John 
and Katherine request the return of their money. 
When the courts granted John and Katherine a 
second hearing, they had the assistance of their 
CLS attorney. The judge ruled in favor of John 
and Katherine and ordered that their money be 
returned to them.

They have not been paid wages and overtime 
for work they have performed in violation of 
Connecticut and federal wage and hour laws.

Who are the adverse parties (if any) for this

letters, small claims writs, answers, executions 
and judgment liens; sometimes representation in 
small claims court.

What are the outcome goals of this 
assistance?

To make the workers whole for the work that they 
have performed, to educate workers on ways to 
protect themselves against this wage abuse in the 
future, and to collect double damages to prevent 
the employers from continuing to cheat workers.

Stamford Day Laborer Wage Clinic

Why is this assistance important to  
these clients?

These are low-wage workers who often do not 
have savings or other resources to fall back on if 
they are not paid. Without timely payment of their 
wages they cannot fulfill their and their family’s 
subsistence needs. Their housing is at risk and 
their ability to feed their family is compromised.

What time commitment is required to do this 
pro bono work ?

The clinics are held on the second and fourth 
Wednesday of each month. We take clients from 
6pm to 8pm but work is not usually completed 
until 9 or 9:30 pm. The Monday prior to each 
clinic volunteers receive an email asking if they 
will be attending that week’s clinic. We ask that 
volunteers attend a minimum of 6 clinics per year. 
A 2-3 hour training is required before attendance 
at a clinic. If an attorney accepts a case for small 
claims representation: reviewing the file, meeting 
with the client, preparing the case and the client 
and representing the client in small claims court 
should take a total of approximately six hours. 

Where is the pro bono work done? (at a legal 
aid office, at the pro bono attorney’s office, 
etc.)?

The evening clinic is held at the Stamford office 
of Connecticut Legal Services, Inc. at 20 Summer 
Street in Stamford. Small claims representation: 
you can meet with clients at Connecticut Legal 
Services’ Stamford office at 20 Summer Street 
or at your office, whichever is more convenient 
for you and the clients. We will mail you the file. 
The hearing takes place in the Superior Court in 
Stamford on Hoyt Street.

If the pro bono attorney will be appearing 
for the client, in what court or other forum is 
that appearance?

Small claims court in Stamford.

done (evening clinic, etc.)

The evening clinic is every other Wednesday 
from 6pm to about 9-9:30 pm. The small 
claims calendar is called at either 10 am or 2 
pm. You can schedule meetings with the clients 
and perform any necessary case work at your 
convenience. 

Give a short (1-paragraph) case example

Mr. Diaz worked for a veterinarian in New Canaan. 
He was never paid overtime. His pay stubs 
corroborated many, many hours of overtime. 
A demand letter was sent to the employer 
demanding payment. The employer’s bookkeeper 
responded. She said the worker was not owed 
overtime pay because he ‘voluntarily worked 
overtime’. She was told that was not the law. They 
checked with their attorney and soon after mailed 
a check to the worker. 

Does this pro bono work require full 
admission to practice in Connecticut?

No.

If no:  how are those without full admission 
partnered and supervised to ensure 
avoidance of issues regarding unlicensed 
practice?

All clinic volunteers are trained and supervised 
by Connecticut Legal Services (CLS) attorneys  
who are present at each clinic. All the work that 
is produced at each clinic is reviewed by CLS 
attorneys. Attorneys represented clients in small 
claims court must be fully admitted.

CONNECTICUT LEGAL SERVICES, INC.

to get a group together. Trainings usually last  
2-3 hours. 

When is the next training (after October 1) 
and how often is training offered?

Training is held on an ad hoc basis when there are 
at least 2 or 3 new volunteers to be trained.

Serving Connecticut’s 
Veterans

Who are the clients?

Connecticut Veterans Legal Center exists to help 
military veterans recovering from homelessness 
and mental illness overcome legal barriers to 
stable housing and income. 

What legal problem do these clients face?

Veterans recovering from homelessness and 
mental illness face a huge array of issues 
including, but not limited to, family, tax, criminal, 
pardon, DMV, immigration, child support, landlord-
tenant, foreclosure, consumer and student debt, 
consumer fraud, and social security benefits and 
overpayments. The CVLC also helps veterans 
secure medical, educational and compensatory 
benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs 
and corrections to military records from the 
Department of Defense.

Who are the adverse parties (if any) for this 
type of work (e.g. landlords, spouses, banks, 
government entities)?  

Adverse parties include landlords, banks, 
insurance companies, spouses, various state 
agencies, federal and state prosecutors, the IRS, 
the VA, and third party debt collectors.

What legal strategies do the pro bono 
lawyers use to assist the clients?

Pro bono lawyers volunteering with the CVLC have 
provided full representation to veterans, advice 
to CVLC staff attorneys in handling cases and 
investigation into possible claims.

What are the outcome goals of this 
assistance?

To help veterans recovering from homelessness 
and mental illness remove legal barriers to stable 
housing and income.

Why is this assistance important to  
these clients?

CVLC’s clients are actively engaged in treatment 
and recovery from serious mental illness and 
substance abuse. While they are doing the hard 
work of personal transformation, we provide 
support to alleviate the stress of legal problems 
like criminal records, outstanding traffic violations, 
or a dispute with a landlord, which can derail 
recovery.

What time commitment is required to do this 
pro bono work ?

CVLC clients have a range of issues, so there 
are lots of options ranging from a single court 
appearance or meeting to longer-term client 
relationships.

Where is the pro bono work done? (at a  
legal aid office, at the pro bono attorney’s 
office, etc.)?

CVLC meets with clients at a VA community 
mental health facility. CVLC hopes all of its 
volunteers will come to see the special facility 
where we work and how this arrangement serves 
our clients. We also offer space for pro bono 
attorneys to meet with clients. However, most pro 
bono work happens at the volunteer’s office.

Serving Connecticut’s Veterans

CONNECTICUT VETERANS LEGAL CENTER

If the pro bono attorney will be appearing 
for the client, in what court or other forum is 
that appearance?

Small claims, civil, housing, support enforcement, 
family, Department of Veterans Affairs, Social 
Security and other administrative hearings. 

At what time of day is the pro bono work 
done (evening clinic, etc.) 

CVLC is co-hosting a series of estate-planning 
events for veterans across the state in 2011-2012 
with the Estate and Probate Section of the CBA. 
Those events are held in the evenings. Otherwise, 
pro bono work is done at the volunteer’s 
convenience.

Veterans recovering from 
homelessness and mental 
illness face a huge array 
of issues.

Case example

Recently a formerly homeless female veteran who 
had been deployed with the first unit sent to Iraq 
was facing eviction in Waterbury due to $300 
in unpaid rent when her employer reduced her 
hours. A volunteer attorney in her town quickly 
jumped into the case and negotiated a settlement 
that let the veteran and her five-year-old daughter 
avoid homelessness and pay back the outstanding 
debt at a pace she could manage. Great outcome!

Does this pro bono work require full 
admission to practice in Connecticut? 

Not necessarily. There are several types of 
assistance CVLC provides that do not require 
admission, including assistance with discharge 
upgrades and pardons.

If no:  how are those without full  
admission partnered and supervised to 
ensure avoidance of issues regarding 
unlicensed practice?

In some instances, in-house counsel not  
licensed in Connecticut have partnered with 
outside-counsel to represent veterans. In  
limited circumstances CVLC would assume 
representation so that a lawyer without full 
admission could assist.

If it is important that a pro bono lawyer 
already have particular legal background or 
training, please describe. 

CVLC volunteer attorneys have had great success 
representing veterans in areas of the law that 
were new to them. 

What training is provided to pro bono 
lawyers doing this work?

advocates interested in helping veterans seeking 
a discharge upgrade or other correction to their 
military records.

Give a short (1-paragraph) case example

LFCA is fortunate to have many capable and 
experienced attorney volunteers. We are 
especially grateful to have Attorney Sheila 
Huddleston, a partner with the Hartford firm of 
Shipman & Goodwin, LLP as a volunteer. Attorney 
Huddleston represented the legal interests of one 
of our child clients not only at the Connecticut 
Appellate Court but all the way to the Connecticut 
Supreme Court. The decision handed down by 
the Supreme Court in this case clarifies the issue 
of out-of-court statements made by children 
during abuse/neglect investigations and their 
admissibility in court.

At the initial neglect trial the psychologist 
deemed it to be harmful for the child to testify 
in court about the statements made to police, 
social workers and the psychologist during the 
investigation. The Department of Children and 
Families’ position was that the children can be 
harmed by the very system that is designed to 
protect them. The statements were allowed in 
without the child having to testify.

LAWYERS FOR CHILDREN AMERICA

Under the rules of evidence, out-of-court 
statements are not allowed unless the person 
who made them is unavailable under the rules 
or testifies where they can be cross-examined 
by counsel preserving the constitutional right of 
confrontation. Testifying in court is upsetting for 
anyone but for a child it could be very damaging 
psychologically especially when the statements 
are made against a parent or caretaker. 

The issue before the court in this case involved 
the admissibility of the out-of-court statements 
the child made during the investigative phase 
of an abuse/neglect allegation against the 
child’s custodial parent and whether one of the 
permissible exceptions to the rule applied. 

Both of the children reported witnessing domestic 
violence and substance abuse by the mother 
and her boyfriend, which included driving under 
the influence with the children in the car, being 
subjected to verbal and physical abuse and  
being locked in a room as punishment by the 
mother’s boyfriend. 

A report was made to the DCF hotline and an 
investigation was opened. The children were found 
to have been neglected. The mother appealed the 
trial court’s decision to the state appellate court. 
The Appellate Court, relying on the rationale 
that the testimony of abused children requires 
special consideration agreed with the trial court’s 
decision. The mother appealed to the Connecticut 
Supreme Court which concluded that the Appellate 
Court correctly found that the statements made 
by the children were admissible at the trial. 

When a case is appealed and goes to the 
Appellate and then the Supreme Court it requires 
an enormous time commitment and legal 
expertise. The outcome here will benefit all child 
victims and prevent them experiencing the harm 
and the trauma of having to testify in court when 
they tell a caring adult about abuse or neglect 
they are experiencing at home.

Children need individual 
representation during child 
protection proceedings 
to ensure that their best 
interests are served.

Does this pro bono work require full 
admission to practice in Connecticut?

Yes.

What training is provided to pro bono 
lawyers doing this work?

Full-day core training mandatory, optional 
continuing trainings, continued mentoring 
provided throughout case lifetime by Lawyers for 
Children America staff.

Who provides the training?

Lawyers for Children America staff and Yale Child 
Study Center Staff.

Where is the training held?  How long does 
the training last?

STATE OF CONNECTICUT JUDICIAL BRANCH

NAME OF NON-PROFIT AGENCY
State of Connecticut 
Judicial Branch

NAME OF PRO BONO PROJECT  
OR OPPORTUNITY
Volunteer Attorney 
Program

Who are the clients?

The clients are any self-represented party 
who needs legal help in the area of family or 
foreclosure law. The  criteria for participation is 
that the client must have a legal issue or question 
in the subject area and may not be represented 
by an attorney at the time they meet with the 
volunteer attorney. The program does not income-
qualify participants and the participant needn’t 
have a case pending or a case pending in the 
Judicial District court location where the program 
is running. 

What legal problem do these clients face?

As the Volunteer Attorney Programs are available 
in the areas of family or foreclosure law, clients 
may be facing a range of problems including but 
not limited to divorce, custody, child support, 
contempt, civil unions, grandparent rights, loan 
modifications, foreclosure, foreclosure mediation.

Who are the adverse parties (if any) for this 
type of work (e.g. landlords, spouses, banks, 
government entities)?  

The adverse parties include banks, landlords, 
spouses, custodial/non-custodial parents, 
boyfriend, girlfriend, etc. 

What legal strategies do the pro bono 
lawyers use to assist the clients?

The volunteer attorneys provide the self-
represented parties with a range of options that 
may be appropriate to help resolve their problem. 
They advise them on specific legal procedures and 

20

Volunteer Attorney Program

answer specific legal questions about ‘should I?’ 
or ‘what would happen if?’ types of questions. The 
attorneys utilize the other resources provided by 
the Judicial Branch such as the Law Libraries and 
the Court Service Centers to further assist parties.  

What are the outcome goals of  
this assistance?

The participants are able to get their legal 
questions answered and leave the session with a 
clear idea of what options are available to them 
and what the consequences of those options are. 
The self-represented party leaves the session 
more informed and educated. 

Why is this assistance important to  
these clients?

Even though the Volunteer Attorney Program does 
not income-qualify the participants, these parties 
do not have access to competent legal counsel. 
Many have lost their jobs or are under-employed 
and are forced to make the choice between 
paying their mortgage or hiring an attorney. The 
economic turndown has created a new class of 
indigent self-represented parties, many of whom 
have some means to support their families, but 
have little or no access to discretionary funds. 

What time commitment is required to do this 
pro bono work ?

Depending on the Judicial District court location, 
the program runs either once a week or two-
times per month for a 2-hour period. Volunteer 
attorneys are generally asked to select between 
three and five dates over a 1-year period. 

Where is the pro bono work done? (at a  
legal aid office, at the pro bono attorney’s 
office, etc.)?

The Volunteer Attorney Program runs in the 
Judicial District courthouse in a courtroom (if 
available) or a hearing room.

If the pro bono attorney will be appearing 
for the client, in what court or other forum is 
that appearance?

The Volunteer Attorney Program does not require 
the attorneys to file appearances on behalf of the 
parties they meet with and provide advice to. 

STATE OF CONNECTICUT JUDICIAL BRANCH

At what time of day is the pro bono work 
done (evening clinic, etc.)

The Volunteer Attorney Programs run from 
9-11am.

Give a short (1-paragraph) case example

A party to a divorce action may not understand 
what their rights are to the marital assets or what 
type of relief they can seek from the court. The 
volunteer attorneys advise them on such issues 
as the automatic orders and what they mean, 
as well as available options  in terms of what 
motions they can file and what types of pendente 
lite or post-judgment relief they may be able to 
ask the court to order. Similarly, in a foreclosure 
action, the volunteer attorneys may advise clients 
on such issues as Foreclosure Mediation, loan 
modifications, foreclosure scams, HAMP Affidavits 
and HUD certified counselors. Depending on 
the circumstances of the foreclosure action, the 
volunteer attorneys may discuss whether the 
client has a viable defense to the foreclosure, or 
may simply advise them on how to negotiate a 
graceful exit.  

Does this pro bono work require full 
admission to practice in Connecticut?

Yes. The volunteer attorneys must be a member 
of the bar in good standing in accordance with 
Practice Book section 2-65. 

If it is important that a pro bono lawyer 
already have particular legal background or 
training, please describe. 

The application process for the Volunteer Attorney 
Program asks the attorney to indicate how many 
years they have been practicing law and how 
many years of experience they have in the subject 
area. The attorneys are also asked to provide the 
name of a professional reference. The Program 
does not require a minimum number of years of 
experience in the subject area, but the volunteers 
are required to demonstrate some experience. 

What training is provided to pro bono 
lawyers doing this work?

Training was provided for the volunteers in 
the New Haven foreclosure Volunteer Attorney 
Program through the CT Fair Housing Center 

as the number of attorneys experienced in 
foreclosure defense in the New Haven bar was 
insufficient to support the needs of the program. 
Historically, training has not been provided in the 
family programs.

Who provides the training?

The CT Fair Housing Center provided the training 
to the New Haven volunteer attorneys. 

Where is the training held?  How long does 
the training last?

CT Fair Housing conducts regular foreclosure 
clinics for defendant homeowners in foreclosure 
cases. The Center offered to provide this same 
training for the New Haven volunteer attorneys. 
The training was 2 hours. 

When is the next training (after October 1) 
and how often is training offered?

The CT Fair Housing Center conducts foreclosure 
clinics for homeowners. The training was adapted 
for the volunteer attorneys in New Haven. 
Attorney Jeff Gentes, Foreclosure Prevention 
Attorney at the CT Fair Housing Center, conducts 
the Foreclosure Prevention Clinics. Currently, 
clinics are being offered in Hartford County on 
October 18, November 15 and December 20, 2011 
and in Fairfield County on October 19, November 
16 and December 21, 2011. There are also 
training materials that are available as handouts. 
Additional clinic dates for 2012 will be announced 
as they’re scheduled. 

Can the training be attended remotely 
(webinar or teleconference)?

The foreclosure training cannot be attended 
remotely via teleconference or webinar. However, 
regional training sessions are scheduled to 
accommodate participants from different parts of 
the State.

State and federal procedural protections leading

Avoid expulsion or minimize sanctions. 

Why is this assistance important to

The Pro Bono Expulsion Project seeks to address 
the unmet legal need of meaningful representation 
for low income students facing significant loss 
of time in school. Despite the state and federal 
protections, the majority of low income children 
go unrepresented at these proceedings. 

What time commitment is required to do this 
pro bono work?

The duration of the case. 

Where is the pro bono work done? (at a  
legal aid office, at the pro bono attorney’s

At the attorney’s office, the client’s home and on 
the school premises.

If the pro bono attorney will be appearing

work with the client and family on evenings and 
weekends if desired. 

Case example

“Garry” is a 16 year old who lived most of his life 
in foster care until moving in with his sister last 
year. He was suspended for 10 days on suspicion 
of carrying narcotics  and his DCF worker was 
notified that the school was pursuing expulsion. 
His school assessment showed that while Garry  is 
currently an F student, by all accounts he could 
be getting A’s but for the fact he is hanging out 
with bad influences. Garry has no other history 
of problems other than his poor grades in school. 
Garry’s pro bono attorney got the school to agree 
to an educational plan that avoided expulsion but 
did include more oversight with DCF and regularly 
scheduled meetings with his sister. Garry’s grades 
have improved and his newer circle of friends 
are more interested in music and art rather than 
hanging out and getting into trouble.

for the client, in what court or other forum is 
that appearance?

United States Tax Court.

At what time of day is the pro bono work 
done (evening clinic, etc.)

Anytime that works for both the pro bono attorney 
and the client, unless the pro bono attorney has 
to meet with an IRS or DRS employee. This is 
usually set up during the day. 

Without the assistance, 
many low income 
taxpayers would not have 
the tax refunds, wages 
or social security benefits 
necessary to pay their 
ordinary and necessary 
living expenses.

Tax Clinic-low income taxpayer legal clinic 39

UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCHOOL OF LAW TAX CLINIC

Give a short (1-paragraph) case example

The Tax Clinic represents between 60 to 100 low 
income taxpayers every year.

‘I was amazed at the spectrum of issues our Tax 
Clinic clients faced. Witihin weeks of enrollment, 
I was applying a wide range of substantive and 
procedural tax law to my clients’ needs. We 
worked on challenging cases.’

–  Brennan Price, ‘04, Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider, 

LLP, Hartford, CT.

Clients are provided high quality legal 
representation at three levels before the  
Internal Revenue Service and the Connecticut 
Department of Revenue Service.

1.  Audits: Students prepare for and represent 
clients in connection with audits of income  
tax returns.

2.  Appeals: Students represent clients with 

regards to the appeal of an adverse audit, the 
exercise of due process rights after the IRS 
first tries to collect a past tax by a levy or a 
lien or the denial of an offer in compromise, or 
the appeal of an adverse determination of the 
request for innocent spouse; and

3.  Collection during the process of proposing an 
alternative payment plan or a compromise of 
tax liabilities.

The Tax Clinic also represents its clients in 
litigation. The Tax Clinic appears before the United 
States Tax Court with respect to litigation of tax 
matters, including adverse audit determinations 
or denials of collection alternatives and generally 
once a semester attends the United States Tax 
Court trial session in Hartford, CT. The Tax Clinic 
also represents clients before the United States 
District Court for the District of Connecticut, 
the United States Court of Federal Claims, and 
the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit 
with respect to refund actions and Freedom of 
Information litigation.

The Tax Clinic does not fill out tax returns or 
provide other accounting services. The Law School 
sponsors a Volunteer Income Tax Assistance 
(VITA) site that is operated in Hartford during the 
tax filing season. Students interested in enrolling 
in the Tax Clinic or in providing tax-related public 
service are encouraged to participate.

Does this pro bono work require full 
admission to practice in Connecticut?

No. But it does require the pro bono attorney to 
be in good standing with the IRS.

If no:  how are those without full admission 
partnered and supervised to ensure 
avoidance of issues regarding unlicensed 
practice?

they must abide by the IRS rules of practice. The 
Tax Clinic director will supervise those not licensed 
to practice in CT.
