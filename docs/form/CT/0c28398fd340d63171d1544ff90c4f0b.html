INSTRUCTIONS FOR UNIFORM SUPPORT PETITION 
 

 
PURPOSE OF THE FORM: 

 

The Uniform Support Petition is a legal pleading needed to initiate an action in the responding tribunal.  Its purposes are to 
 
assert that the tribunal has jurisdiction, to show enough facts to notify the respondent of the claim being made, and to provide 
the petitioner with a means to request specific action or relief.  The petitioner can provide additional information in the 
  
 
accompanying affidavits and other attachments. 
 
 
If you are not the intended recipient, you are hereby notified that any use, disclosure, distribution, or copying of this form or its 
contents is strictly prohibited. 
 
 
The Personal Information Form for UIFSA § 311 must be attached. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Italicized text that appears within a “box” refers to policy or provides additional information. 

 

 

 

 
For an address outside the United States, be sure to include the foreign country and postal code. 

HEADING/CAPTION: 
 

   

•  Identify the petitioner and respondent by full legal name (first, middle, last, suffix) and, if applicable, include the name of the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
tribe with which the petitioner or respondent is affiliated. 

 
•  Identify if the petitioner is the obligee or the obligor.  This will clarify who is submitting the petition. 
 
 
 
•  Note that a Personal Information Form for UIFSA § 311 must be attached. 
  
 
•  Check the appropriate box to identify the type of case: TANF, IV-E foster care, Medicaid only, former assistance, never 
 
 

 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
assistance, or non-IV-D. 
 

 

TANF means the obligee’s family is currently receiving IV-A cash payments.  A Medicaid only case is a case in 
which the obligee’s family receives Medicaid but does not receive TANF.  A former assistance case might be a case 
 
for state arrears only or for a family that previously received TANF, but is not doing so at this time. 

  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  In the appropriate spaces, if applicable and known, enter the responding jurisdiction’s IV-D case identifier and tribunal number. 
 
 

 

 

 

Tribal IV-D programs may choose to use the federal Intergovernmental forms.  However, they are not required to 
use or accept such forms.  If you have any questions, contact the tribal IV-D agency directly using the contact 
 
information on the OCSE website. 
 
 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 
Where forms request a locator code, note that tribal locator codes uniquely identify tribal cases with “9” in the first 
position, 0 (zero) in the second position, and then a 3-character tribal code defined by the Bureau of Indian 
 
 
Affairs (BIA). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The responding jurisdiction is the jurisdiction that is working the case at the request of the initiating jurisdiction. 
  
Under “IV-D case identifier,” enter the number/identifier identical to the one submitted on the Federal Case Registry, 
 
 
which is a left-justified up to 15-character alphanumeric field, allowing all characters except asterisk and backslash, 
 
and with all characters in uppercase. Under “tribunal number,” you may enter the docket number, cause number, or 
 
  
any other appropriate reference number that the responding tribunal may use to identify the case, if known. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  In the appropriate spaces, enter the initiating jurisdiction’s IV-D case identifier, and, if applicable, tribunal number. 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The initiating jurisdiction is the jurisdiction that referred the case to the responding jurisdiction for services. 
Under “IV-D case identifier,” enter the number/identifier identical to the one submitted on the Federal Case Registry, 
 
which is a left-justified up to 15-character alphanumeric field, allowing all characters except asterisk and backslash, 
 
and with all characters in uppercase.  Under “tribunal number,” you may enter the docket number, cause number, or 
 
  
any other appropriate reference number that the initiating tribunal has assigned to the case.

Uniform Support Petition Instructions 

   

   

    

                           

           

In the “NOTE:” section, check any of the following that apply: 
 
 

 

 

 

•  Nondisclosure Finding/Affidavit attached - If there is a finding prohibiting disclosure of a party’s or 
 
 

 
 
child(ren)’s address/identifying information or an affidavit alleging that disclosure of such information would result in risk 
of harm, check the box for “Nondisclosure Finding/Affidavit attached” and attach a copy of the finding/affidavit in 
 
accordance with section 312 of UIFSA.  If there is a finding/affidavit prohibiting disclosure, the information must be 
 
sealed and may not be disclosed to the other party or the public.  You may provide the address of the IV-D agency as a 
substitute address for the protected party. 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

UIFSA requires that the petition or accompanying documents include certain identifying information regarding the 
parties and child(ren) (e.g., residential address, social security number) unless a party alleges in an affidavit or a 
pleading under oath that the health, safety, or liberty of a party or child would be jeopardized by disclosure of such 
information.  In that event, the information must be sealed. 
 
If a jurisdiction has reason to believe that information should not be released because of safety concerns, it should 
ensure that there is a nondisclosure finding or an allegation in an affidavit or the pleading that disclosure of 
 
identifying information would result in a risk of harm, as provided under section 312 of UIFSA.  In addition to 
identifying information included on this form, it may be appropriate to submit certain financial information under seal. 
  

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  This form sent through EDE - Check if this form was sent through the Electronic Document Exchange (EDE). 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

CSENet and EDE transactions are the recommended methods for making requests or sending information to 
another state.  If CSENet is not listed as an option on the form, then it cannot be used to convey any of the 
requests or information provided on the form.  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Supporting documentation should be sent through EDE, whenever possible. 
 

 

By signing the petition, the petitioner asserts that the respondent in this action and/or the respondent’s property is subject to the 
 
jurisdiction of the responding tribunal. 
List the child(ren) on whose behalf the action in the petition is sought.  Include each child’s full legal name (first, middle, last, 
 
suffix).  Additional identifying information is provided in the Personal Information Form for UIFSA § 311. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Body of the Form: 
 

 
Section I.  Action: 
  

 

 
•  Check the appropriate box(es) to indicate the action(s) requested.  Multiple actions may be requested, as appropriate. 
  
•  Check “Establishment of parentage” to request that parentage be established.  Attach a “Declaration in Support of 
 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

Establishing Parentage” for each child whose parentage is at issue. 
  

 

•  Check “Establishment of an order for” to request that an order be established.  Indicate the type of order by checking the 
 

  

 

 

 

appropriate box(es).  The options are: 
 

 

 
order. 
 
 

retroactive support is sought. 
 

•  Check “Current child support, including medical support” to request the establishment of a new child support 
 
 

 

 

 

 

•  Check “Retroactive child support” to request support for a prior period.  Provide the time period from which 
 
 

  

 

 

 

 

Jurisdictions may establish child support awards covering a prior period, but such awards must be based on the 
responding jurisdiction’s child support guideline and take into consideration either the current earnings and income at 
 
the time the order is set, or the obligor’s earnings and income during the prior period.  The award of retroactive support 
 
is not required under federal rules, but may be appropriate in accordance with the responding jurisdiction’s law.  The 
time period for any award of retroactive support will also be based on the responding jurisdiction’s law.  Not all 
 
jurisdictions have authority to establish support orders for prior periods.  A medical support provision must be included 
 
in any new or modified order in a IV-D case. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

   

         

•  Check “Medical support only” in a Medicaid case to request medical support where a child support order does 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

not exist and is not sought.  If seeking to add medical support to an existing child support order, check “Modification 
of a support order.” 
 

 

 

 

•  Check “Spousal support” to request establishment of a spousal support order.  NOTE:  Do not check this item in a 
 
IV-D case.  Establishment of spousal support is not a IV-D child support agency function, and a IV-D child support 
 
agency will not assist. 
 

  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Check “Costs and fees” to request an order for expenses, such as location costs and genetic testing fees. 
 
  

 

 

 

 

 

Complete the General Testimony to detail the type and amount of these costs and fees.

Uniform Support Petition Instructions 

   

   

 

             

 

           

 

 
•  Check “Modification of a support order” to request modification of an existing order. 
 
•  Check “Other remedy sought” to request an action not listed in section I.  Specify in the space provided the remedy the 
 
 
 

   

 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

petitioner is requesting. 
 
 

Section II.  Grounds Supporting the Remedy Sought in Section I: 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Check “Parentage of the child(ren) named in this petition has not been established.  (Attach a Declaration in Support 
 
 
of Establishing Parentage for each child.)” when the parentage of the child(ren) has not been established.  Attach the 
Declaration in Support of Establishing Parentage form for each child. 
 
 

•  Check “The parents have a duty to support the child(ren) named in this petition” when parentage is not an issue. 
 
 
 
•  If you are requesting retroactive support, check the applicable box.  Check “[  ] Respondent has not provided

provided.  Check “[  ] Petitioner has not provided support since:  _______ (date)” if the petitioner has not provided 
 
support and identify the last time support was provided.  NOTE:  The petitioner can be the obligor. 
 
 

•  Check “It has been 3 years (or the time frame permitted by the laws of the responding jurisdiction) since the last 
 
 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

review or modification” when the petitioner seeks modification of the existing support order based on the passage of time 
permitted under the laws of the responding jurisdiction.  
 
 

 

 

 

•  Check “There has been a change in circumstances since the order was entered.  (Explain.): ______” when the 
 

 

 

petitioner seeks modification of the existing support order based on a change of circumstances since entry of the most recent 
 
order.  Explain the change in the space provided. 

 

 

 

 

 
 

•  Check “Additional grounds” when the basis for the remedy sought is not listed on the form.  Provide information about the 
 
 

  

 

 

 

    
 

basis for the remedy sought. 

 
   

Section III.  Servicemembers Civil Relief Act: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In any civil action or proceeding, including any child support proceeding, in which the respondent does not make an appearance, 
 
the tribunal, before entering judgment for the petitioner, must require the petitioner to file with the tribunal an affidavit (A) stating 
 
whether or not the respondent is in military service and showing necessary facts to support the affidavit; or (B) if the petitioner is 
 
unable to determine whether or not the respondent is in military service, stating that the petitioner is unable to determine whether 
 
or not the respondent is in military service. 50 U.S.C. 3931(b)(1). 
 
 
The term “military service” includes the following: active duty service as a member of the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, 
 
Marine Corps, or Coast Guard; service as a member of the National Guard under a call to active service authorized by the 
 
President or the Secretary of Defense for a period of more than 30 consecutive days for purposes of responding to a national 
 
emergency; active service as a commissioned officer of the Public Health Service or of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
 
Administration; any period of service during which a servicemember is absent from duty on account of sickness, wounds, leave, 
 
or other lawful cause. 50 U.S.C. 3911(2). 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As of the date the petition is signed, check the appropriate box to indicate the respondent’s military service. 
 
   

•  Check “The respondent is in military service.” if the respondent is currently in military service. 
 
 
•  Check “The respondent is not in military service.” if the respondent is currently not in military service. 
 
 
 
•  Check “I am unable to determine whether the respondent is in military service.” if you are unable to determine if the 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respondent is currently in military service.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
