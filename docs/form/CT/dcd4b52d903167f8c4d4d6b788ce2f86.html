INSTRUCTIONS FOR LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL REQUESTING REGISTRATION  

PURPOSE OF THE FORM:  
 
The Letter  of Transmittal Requesting Registration is completed by the initiating jurisdiction to request registration of an  
existing order for enforcement  and/or  modification in the responding jurisdiction.  The purpose of the form is to provide  
specific order information to the responding jurisdiction.  This form  can be used in IV-D  and non-IV-D intergovernmental  
cases.   It  should be included with the other appropriate forms and, in  IV-D cases,  directed to the responding jurisdiction’s  
central  registry.    

THIS FORM CONTAINS SENSITIVE INFORMATION –  DO NOT FILE THIS FORM  IN A PUBLIC ACCESS FILE.   
This form  includes  information that  may pose a significant risk to an individual  if  made available in a public forum or  
inappropriately disclosed.  This form  may be filed with the tribunal, but should not be filed or included in a record available  
to the general  public.   The information on this  form  may  be di
  sclosed to the parties in the case,  unless accompanied by  a 
nondisclosure finding/affidavit.  

If you are not  the intended recipient, you are hereby notified that any use, disclosure, distribution, or  copying of  this form  
or its contents  is  strictly prohibited.  

To open an intergovernmental IV-D  case, attach a T

Italicized  text that appears within a “box” refers to policy or provides  additional  information.  

For an address outside the United States, be sure to include the foreign country and postal  code.  

Tribal IV-D programs may choose to use the federal Intergovernmental forms.   However, they are not required to use 
or accept such forms.  If  you have any questions,  contact the tribal IV-D agency directly using the contact information  
on the OCSE website.  
 Where forms  request  a locator code, note that  tribal locator  codes uniquely identify tribal cases with “9” in the first  
position, 0 (zero) in the second position,  and then a  3-character tribal code defined by the Bureau of Indian Affairs  
(BIA).  

  
HEADING/CAPTION: 
 
In the appropriate spaces, if applicable and if known, enter  the responding jurisdiction’s IV-D case identifier  and tribunal  
number.  

The responding jurisdiction is the jurisdiction that is working the case at the request of the initiating jurisdiction.   Under  
“IV-D case identifier,” enter the number/identifier identical to the one submitted on the Federal Case  Registry,  which is 
l characters except asterisk and  backslash, and with 
a left-justified  up to  15-character  alphanumeric  field,  allowing al
all characters  in uppercase. Under “tribunal  number,” you may enter the docket number,  cause number, or any  other  
appropriate reference number  that the responding tribunal  may use to identify the case, if known.   

 

In the appropriate spaces, enter the Initiating jurisdiction’s IV-D case identifier, and, if  applicable, tribunal number.   

The initiating jurisdiction is the  jurisdiction that referred the case to the responding jurisdiction for  services.  
Under “IV-D case identifier,” enter the number/identifier  identical to the one submitted on the Federal Case 
Registry, which is a left-justified  up to 15-character alphanumeric field, allowing all  characters except asterisk  
and backslash, and with all characters  in uppercase.   Under “tribunal  number,” you may enter the docket  
number, cause number,  or any  other appropriate reference number  that  the initiating tribunal has assigned to  
the case.

ACTION: 
Check the appropriate box indicating whether you are registering this order for enforcement, enforcement of arrears 
 
only, modification, or modification and enforcement.  If registering the order for enforcement of arrears only, check the 
appropriate box(es) for assigned arrears and/or non-assigned arrears. 
  
 
In the “NOTE” section, check any of the following that apply: 
 
 
•  Nondisclosure Finding/Affidavit attached - If there is a finding prohibiting disclosure of a party’s 
 
 
or child(ren)’s address/identifying information or an affidavit alleging that disclosure of such information would 
result in risk of harm, check the box for “Nondisclosure Finding/Affidavit attached” and attach a copy of the 
 
finding/affidavit in accordance with section 312 of UIFSA.  If there is a finding/affidavit prohibiting disclosure, the 
information must be sealed and may not be disclosed to the other party or the public.  You may provide the 
 
address of the IV-D agency as a substitute address for the protected party. 
 

 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

UIFSA requires that the petition or accompanying documents include certain identifying information regarding the 
parties and child(ren) (e.g., residential address, Social Security Number) unless a party alleges in an affidavit or a 
pleading under oath that the health, safety, or liberty of a party or child would be jeopardized by disclosure of such 
information.  In that event, the information must be sealed. 
 
If a jurisdiction has reason to believe that information should not be released because of safety concerns, it should 
 
ensure that there is a nondisclosure finding or an allegation in an affidavit or the pleading that disclosure of 
 
identifying information would result in a risk of harm, as provided under section 312 of UIFSA.  In addition to 
 
identifying information included on this form, it may be appropriate to submit certain financial information under 
 
seal.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
