Biennial Report 2010-2012    1

To the Governor, General Assembly  
and the Residents of Connecticut: 

It is once again my pleasure to present to you this Biennial Report on the 
Connecticut Judicial Branch for the years 2010-2012. We have dedicated 
this edition to “Ensuring Access to Justice in Difficult Times.” 

The role of the courts in a democracy cannot be overstated. It is  
the responsibility of the judiciary to ensure that all individuals have 
meaningful access to justice, regardless of the state’s financial situation. 
Our challenge has been finding ways to enhance access cost-effectively,  
and we have succeeded.

Let me provide you with just two examples. First, the Judicial Branch 
has improved access for people with limited English proficiency through 
the installation of Language Lines in all clerks’ offices and Court Service 
Centers. This service provides near-instant translation over the telephone  
in more than 170 languages and has served thousands of people.

Additionally, the Judicial Branch has established Volunteer Attorney 
Programs in the Hartford, Waterbury and Stamford family courts and in 
the New Haven and Fairfield Judicial Districts for foreclosure cases. This 
program has been very successful, due to the willingness of members of 
the Bar to donate their services. Thousands of self-represented parties have 
been assisted. 

Clearly, there is still much more to be done, but ensuring access to justice 
has always been – and will continue to be – our top priority. 

Very truly yours,

Chase T. Rogers  
Chief Justice

Chief Justice’s Letter

2    Biennial Report 2010-2012

Chief Court Administrator’s Letter

To the Governor, General Assembly  
and the Residents of Connecticut:

Responding to the budget shortfall was a major focus of the past two years, 
although it was not the Judicial Branch’s only focus. 

On the positive side, 16-year-olds were effectively integrated into Juvenile 
Court on July 1, 2010. While many people were concerned that bringing in 
the 16-year-olds would overwhelm the juvenile system, I am happy to report 
that it has not. We can attribute this to all the hard work that our judges 
and staff did to prepare for this change. Currently, this age group constitutes 
approximately 25 percent of all delinquency cases. Moreover, because of 
the strong foundation that was laid two years ago for the 16-year-olds, we 
anticipate that the integration of 17-year-olds, effective July 1, 2012, will go 
smoothly as well.

The juvenile justice initiatives initiated by the Legislature also made possible 
the closing of the New Haven Juvenile Detention Center, because of the 
successful diversion of youths from the court system. The closing saved us 
significant resources amid the difficult budgetary decisions we faced during 
the 2010-2012 biennium.

Those decisions included reducing the number of days that our judge trial 
referees could work by 15 percent as well as the number of days that our 
temporary assistant clerks could work. We replaced only about one out of  
every seven employees who left the Branch, resulting in shortages in the 
number of courtroom staff. We also eliminated state police coverage outside 
certain courthouses.

Our law libraries have been particularly hard hit. It should be noted that the 
Branch’s law libraries are an essential resource, not only for attorneys, but 
also for members of the public and for self-represented parties. The patron 
count traffic reveals that more than 250,000 people use the law libraries on 
an annual basis. Unfortunately, we are no longer able to provide the services 
that we once did. 

It has been a challenging two years, yet we have met our mission to resolve 
disputes in a fair, timely, efficient and open manner, in large part because of 
the cooperation among the three branches of government. I would like  
to thank the Executive and Legislative Branches for their willingness to 
discuss these difficult issues of mutual concern and to work together for an 
equitable solution.

Very truly yours,

Barbara M. Quinn 
Chief Court Administrator

Supreme Court

Seated, L to R: Justice Flemming L. Norcott, Jr., Chief Justice Chase T. Rogers and Justice Richard N. Palmer

Standing, L to R: Justice C. Ian McLachlan (now retired), Justice Dennis G. Eveleigh, Justice Peter T. Zarella, Justice Lubbie Harper, Jr. 
(now retired) and Senior Justice Christine S. Vertefeuille 

The Supreme Court is the state’s highest court. It 
consists of the Chief Justice, six associate justices and 
one senior justice. 

Led by the Chief Justice, the Supreme Court reviews 
rulings made in the Appellate and Superior Courts to 
determine if any errors have occurred. The Court sits 
en banc – in panels of seven – in cases in which there 
are no disqualifications. When one justice has recused 
him or herself from hearing a matter, the Court sits as 
a panel of six. If there are two disqualifications, the 
Court sits as a panel of five. In all death penalty 
cases, the Court sits en banc. 

The Supreme Court goes “on circuit” annually and 
schedules arguments at a school, where students get 
a first-hand look at how an appellate court works. The 
sessions are held in the same way as they would be 
held in the Supreme Court’s courtroom. Educators and 
students are supplied with advance materials, including 
the briefs filed. Informational talks are held for the 
students, after the arguments, with the counsel who 
argued the cases. 

Over the biennium, the Court visited the University of 
Connecticut’s School of Law, Western Connecticut 

State University and New Haven’s Wilbur 

Cross High School. 

Biennial Report 2010-2012    5

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Supreme Court  
During the Biennium

State v. Kitchens, 299 Conn. 447 (2011).

Raftopol v. Ramey, 299 Conn. 681 (2011).

In this case, the court considered the circumstances 
under which an unpreserved claim that the trial court 
improperly had instructed the jury may be reviewed 
on appeal under the court’s case law governing the 
reviewability of unpreserved constitutional claims. 
Justice Zarella authored the majority opinion concluding 
that instructional claims are not reviewable on appeal 
when the trial court provided counsel with a copy of 
the proposed jury instructions, allowed a meaningful 
opportunity for their review, solicited comments 
from counsel and counsel affirmatively accepted the 
instructions. The court reasoned that such conduct 
constitutes an implicit waiver of the constitutional 
right to challenge the instructions on direct appeal. 
Justice Katz authored a concurring opinion, in which 
Justice Palmer and Justice Norcott joined, arguing that 
a defendant should not be deemed to have waived a 
challenge to a jury instruction unless the defendant 
induced the error or the record clearly reflects that 
the defendant was aware of the particular challenged 
aspect of the instruction and expressed satisfaction 
with it. Justice Palmer authored a concurring opinion, in 
which Justice Katz and Justice Norcott joined, arguing 
that counsel cannot be deemed to have waived the 
defendant’s right to an adequate jury instruction in the 
absence of a record demonstrating, either expressly 
or impliedly, that counsel knew that the charge was 
constitutionally infirm and, nevertheless, decided in the 
exercise of his professional judgment, not to object to 
the charge.

The issue raised in this case was whether Connecticut 
law permits an intended party who is neither the 
biological nor the adoptive parent of a child to become 
a legal parent of that child by means of a valid 
gestational agreement. The plaintiffs, who were an 
unmarried domestic couple, entered into a gestational 
agreement with the named defendant whereby the 
defendant agreed to act as the gestational carrier 
of embryos resulting from the fertilization of eggs 
provided by third party donor with sperm contributed 
by one of the plaintiffs. The gestational carrier also 
agreed to terminate her parental rights in the children 
and to consent to their adoption by the plaintiff who 
was not their biological father. Before the children 
were born, the plaintiffs brought an action seeking a 
declaratory judgment that they were the children’s legal 
parents and seeking a replacement birth certificate 
to reflect that fact. The defendant, the department of 
public health (department), contended that the trial 
court lacked jurisdiction to terminate the parental 
rights of the gestational carrier, the egg donor and any 
husbands that either party might have and, therefore, 
could not declare that the plaintiff who was not the 
biological parent was the children’s parent. The trial 
court rendered judgment for the plaintiffs. On appeal, 
the court concluded, in an opinion authored by Justice 
McLachlan, that the gestational carrier was not the 
children’s parent because she was not their biological 
parent, she had not adopted them and she did not 
come within the artificial insemination statutes. The 
court also concluded that the Superior Court had 
jurisdiction to determine whether a certain state statute 
provided a means for a non-biological parent to obtain 
parental status by gestational agreement. Finally, 
the court concluded that the state statute conferred 
parental status on nongenetic, intended parents of a 
child who are parties to a valid gestational agreement 
and that the department was authorized to issue a 
replacement birth certification identifying such persons 
as the child’s parent. 

6    Biennial Report 2010-2012

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Supreme Court During the Biennium

State v. Lenarz, 301 Conn. 417 (2011).

The defendant in this case claimed that the prosecutor 
had intruded into communications between him and 
his attorney that were subject to the attorney-client 
privilege, thereby violating his constitutional right to 
counsel. Accordingly, the defendant filed a motion 
to dismiss the charges against him. The trial court 
concluded that there was no sixth amendment violation 
because the intrusion had not been intentional and 
the defendant had not been prejudiced, and therefore 
denied the motion. On appeal, Chief Justice Rogers 
authored an opinion in which a majority of the court 
concluded that prejudice may be presumed when a 
prosecutor has read privileged materials containing 
trial strategy, regardless of whether the intrusion 
was intentional. The majority also concluded that the 
burden is on the state to rebut the presumption of 
prejudice by clear and convincing evidence and, if it 
fails to do so, to prove that the prejudice can be cured 
by a less drastic remedy than dismissal. The majority 
held that, because the state had failed to meet this 
burden, the charges must be dismissed. Justice Palmer 
authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Zarella 
joined, arguing that prejudice should not be presumed 
when the state’s invasion of the attorney-client 
privilege was not intentional. He further argued that the 
dismissal of the charges was not an appropriate remedy 
under the circumstances of the case.

Bennett v. New Milford Hospital, 300 Conn. 1 
(2011).

A state statute requires plaintiffs who bring a medical 
malpractice action to attach to their complaint an 
opinion letter from a similar health care provider 
stating that there appears to be evidence of medical 
negligence. A separate statute defines “similar health 
care provider” and also sets forth the requirements for 
a health care provider to qualify as an expert witness. 
In this case, the court considered whether the opinion 
letter could be prepared by a health care provider 
who was qualified to testify in the case as an expert 
witness, but who did not meet the statutory definition 
for a “similar health care provider.” The court, in an 
opinion authored by Justice Norcott, concluded that 
the opinion letter must be prepared by a person who 
meets the statutory definition for a similar health care 
provider. The court also concluded that dismissal of the 
action was the proper remedy when the plaintiff has 
failed to attach to the complaint an opinion letter by 
a similar health care provider. The court recognized, 
however, that there were several mechanisms by which 
nonfrivolous, but procedurally flawed, actions could be 
protected from dismissal.

Bedrick v. Bedrick, 300 Conn. 691 (2011).

In this case, the court considered for the first time 
whether postnuptial agreements are valid and 
enforceable in Connecticut. In an opinion authored 
by Justice McLachlan, the court concluded that 
postnuptial agreements are not inconsistent with the 
public policy of the state. In light of the nature of the 
marital relationship, however, the court concluded 
that such agreements require stricter scrutiny than 
prenuptial agreements. The court held that postnuptial 
agreements may be enforced if they are fair and 
equitable at the time of execution; they are made 
voluntarily without any undue influence, fraud, coercion 
or duress; and both spouses had given full, fair and 
reasonable disclosure of their assets, obligations  
and income.

Biennial Report 2010-2012    7

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Supreme Court During the Biennium

Gould v. Commissioner of Correction, 301 
Conn. 544 (2011).

In this case, the court considered whether the 
recantation of trial testimony that provides the sole 
evidence of guilt can constitute clear and convincing 
evidence of actual innocence for purposes of a petition 
for a new trial pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus. In 
an opinion authored by Justice Eveleigh, a majority of 
the court concluded that the recantation of testimony 
by itself is not sufficient to establish actual innocence, 
but the petitioner must present affirmative proof of 
actual innocence, such as proof that the petitioner 
could not have committed the crime, that a third 
party committed the crime or that no crime occurred. 
In a concurring opinion, Justice Palmer argued that, 
if the recantation of testimony is highly credible, the 
petitioner’s own credible testimony denying guilt should 
constitute sufficient evidence to support a finding of 
actual innocence.

Watts v. Chittenden, 301 Conn. 575 (2011).

The continuing course of conduct doctrine requires a 
plaintiff to establish the breach of a duty that remained 
in existence after the commission of the original wrong 
in order for the statutory limitations period to be 
extended in negligence actions. In this case, the court 
considered whether this principle applies to claims of 
intentional infliction of emotional distress. In an opinion 
authored by Justice Eveleigh, a majority of the court 
concluded that, because the existence of a duty is not 
an element of an intentional infliction of emotional 
distress claim, the existence of an original duty was not 
necessary to apply the continuing course of conduct 
doctrine to such claims. The majority also concluded 
that, if no conduct forming the basis for an intentional 
infliction of emotional distress claim has occurred 
within the three-year limitations period, the claim will 

be barred. Justice McLachlan authored a dissenting 
opinion, in which Justice Zarella joined, arguing that, 
when considering whether the continuing course of 
conduct doctrine applies to a claim of intentional 
infliction of emotional distress, the court should 
examine the facts of the particular case to determine 
whether the cause of action accrued at the time that 
the defendant committed each discrete wrongful act 
or, instead, it accrued only when the defendant had 
completed the last wrongful act. 

Episcopal Church v. Gauss, 302 Conn. 308 
(2011).

The case involved a property dispute between members 
of a local parish of the Episcopal Church and the 
Episcopal Church itself. After the Church members 
informed the Church that they had affiliated themselves 
with the Convocation of Anglicans of North America, 
which was not part of the Church, the Church brought 
an action claiming that the members had wrongfully 
failed to relinquish certain real property that had been 
held in trust for the Church. The trial court rendered 
summary judgment for the Church and the Church 
members appealed. In an opinion authored by Justice 
Zarella, the court noted that the United States Supreme 
Court had used two distinct approaches to church 
property disputes. Under one approach, the court must 
determine whether the church structure is hierarchical. 
If so, then the court must defer to the decision of the 
higher church authorities. Under the second approach, 
the court resolves the dispute by applying neutral 
principles of property law. The court concluded that 
applying neutral principles of law was the preferable 
approach because it provides a more level playing field. 
The court held that, under this approach, the Church 
was entitled to the property.

8    Biennial Report 2010-2012

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Supreme Court During the Biennium

Yeager v. Alvarez, 302 Conn. 772 (2011).

The primary issue in this case was whether the trial 
court has the authority to strike an otherwise valid 
offer of compromise from the case file as a sanction 
for the violation of a discovery order. In an opinion 
authored by Justice Harper, the court concluded that 
the existence of such authority is consistent with the 
public policy goals expressed in the statute governing 
offers of compromise and the court’s inherent powers 
to impose sanctions. The court further concluded that, 
because the plaintiff had not intentionally withheld 
information or subverted the discovery process, and 
because the defendants had not established that they 
had suffered any prejudice as the result of the plaintiff’s 
inadvertent failure to provide certain information, the 
trial court improperly had struck the plaintiff’s offer of 
compromise from the court file.

Gross v. Rell, 304 Conn. 234 (2012).

In this case, the court considered the following 
questions certified to the court by the United 
States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit: (1) 
Under Connecticut law, does absolute quasi-judicial 
immunity extend to conservators appointed by the 
Connecticut Probate Court?; (2) Under Connecticut 
law, does absolute quasi-judicial immunity extend 
to attorneys appointed to represent respondents in 
conservatorship proceedings or to attorneys appointed 
to represent conservatees?; and (3) What is the 
role of conservators, court-appointed attorneys for 
conservatees and nursing homes in the Connecticut 
probate court system? In an opinion authored by 
Chief Justice Rogers, the court concluded that a 
conservator is entitled to quasi-judicial immunity 

only when the conservator is executing an order 
of the Probate Court or the Probate Court ratifies 
the conservator’s action; absolute quasi-judicial 
immunity does not extend to attorneys appointed to 
represent respondents in conservatorship proceedings 
or conservatees, because the primary role of such 
attorneys is to advocate for their clients, not to assist 
the Probate Court to determine the best interests of 
their clients; and nursing homes are not entitled to 
absolute quasi-judicial immunity when they provide 
care to conservatees because, in doing so, they are 
neither executing the orders of the Probate Court nor 
performing a function comparable to that of the  
Probate Court.

State v. Payne, 303 Conn. 538 (2012).

The primary issue in this case was whether the 
court should continue to adhere to its jurisprudence 
recognizing a presumption in favor of joinder in 
criminal cases. In an opinion authored by Chief Justice 
Rogers, the court concluded that the presumption 
was inappropriate because it was inconsistent 
with the principle that the admission of evidence 
of a defendant’s previous crimes or misconduct is 
presumptively prejudicial. Accordingly, the court held 
that, when the state requests the joinder of charges 
that are set forth in separate informations, the state 
bears the burden of proving that the defendant will not 
be substantially prejudiced by joinder. The state may 
satisfy this burden by proving either that the evidence 
in the separate cases is cross admissible or by proving 
that the cases involve easily distinguishable facts, the 
crimes were not violent or shocking and joinder would 
not result in an unduly long or complex trial.

Biennial Report 2010-2012    9

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Supreme Court During the Biennium

Pereira v. State Board of Education, 304 
Conn. 1 (2012).

Schumann v. Dianon Systems, Inc., 304 
Conn. 585 (2012).

Pursuant to state statute, the state board of education 
may authorize the commissioner of education to 
reconstitute a local or regional board of education if 
certain conditions are met. The statute provides that 
the state board may not grant such authority to the 
commissioner unless the state board has required 
the local or regional board of education to complete 
certain training requirements. This case required the 
court to determine whether a local board of education 
could waive the training requirement by passing a 
resolution requesting its own reconstitution. In an 
opinion authored by Justice Zarella, a majority of the 
court concluded that training provision was intended to 
benefit not only local boards of education, but also the 
local electors of the boards and the democratic process. 
In addition, the legislature intended that, in the rare 
event that the state board determines that a local board 
of education should be reconstituted, the reconstitution 
should occur in a deliberate and transparent manner. 
Accordingly, the majority concluded that the local board 
could not waive the training provision. Justice Harper 
authored a concurring opinion in which he disagreed 
with Justice Palmer’s argument in his dissenting opinion 
that permitting a local board of education to waive 
preconditions to state intervention honors the principle 
of local control of schools. Justice McLachlan agreed 
with Justice Harper’s argument in a separate concurring 
opinion. Justice Palmer argued in his dissenting opinion 
that the training provision was waivable. 

The United States Supreme Court has held that, when 
a public employee engages in speech pursuant to 
the employee’s official duties, the first amendment 
to the United States constitution does not insulate 
the employee from employer discipline because the 
employee is not speaking as a citizen. In this case, the 
court considered whether this principle is applicable 
in an action against a private employer brought 
pursuant to a state statute prohibiting employers from 
disciplining employees for exercising their constitutional 
speech rights. Justice Norcott authored the majority 
opinion concluding that the principle recognized in the 
United States Supreme Court case applies in actions 
brought against a private employer under the state 
statute because private employers, no less than public 
employers, need a significant degree of control over 
their employees’ job-related speech. The majority 
also rejected the plaintiff’s claim that, even the United 
States Supreme Court case limited the scope of a 
private employee’s first amendment rights, it did not 
bar his statutory cause of action because employees 
have greater speech rights under the state constitution. 
The majority concluded that, even under the rule that 
the plaintiff urged the court to apply, his speech would 
not have been protected under the state constitution. 
In a concurring opinion, Justice Palmer disagreed with a 
point made by the majority concerning the reviewability 
of the plaintiff’s state constitutional claim. Justice 
Zarella authored a separate concurring opinion in which 
he argued that the state statute protects only speech 
that otherwise would be protected under the state and 
federal constitutions, which would not include speech 
by a private sector employee in the workplace.

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Supreme Court During the Biennium

Sapko v. State, 305 Conn. 360 (2012).

In this case, the court considered whether its case 
law holding that, subject to certain exceptions, 
the superseding cause doctrine no longer serves a 
useful purpose in negligence cases applies to claims 
arising under the workers’ compensation act. Justice 
Palmer authored the opinion of the court concluding 
that, because, unlike negligence cases in which the 
jury is charged with apportioning liability pursuant 
to state statutes governing comparative fault and 
apportionment, the workers’ compensation scheme 
imposes a form of strict liability on employers; and 
because workers’ compensation claims are not decided 
by juries and, therefore, there is no potential for 
confusing the jury with a superseding cause instruction, 
the superseding cause doctrine continues to serve a 
purpose in workers’ compensation cases.

State v. Guilbert, 306 Conn. 218 (2012).

This case required the court to reconsider its previous 
case law holding that the admission of expert 
testimony on the fallibility of eyewitness identification 
is disfavored. In an opinion authored by Justice 
Palmer, a majority of the court concluded that, in 
light of recent studies confirming that mistaken 
eyewitness identification testimony is a leading cause 
of wrongful convictions, and in light of recent scientific 
studies showing that eyewitness identifications are 
potentially unreliable in a variety of ways that are 
unknown to the average juror, expert testimony on 
the reliability of eyewitness testimony does not invade 
the province of the jury to determine what weight 
or effect to give to evidence. The majority further 
concluded that the scientific studies that provided 
the basis for its conclusion satisfied the threshold 
admissibility requirement for scientific evidence. In a 
concurring opinion, Justice Zarella, joined by Justice 
McLachlan, argued that, although expert testimony 
on the reliability of eyewitness testimony should be 
admissible under certain circumstances, it should not 
be presumptively admissible in all cases.

Standing, L to R: Judge Carmen E. Espinosa, Judge Bethany J. Alvord, Judge Stuart Bear and Judge Michael R. Sheldon

The Appellate Court reviews decisions of the Superior 
Court to determine if errors of law have occurred. 
There are nine Appellate Court judges, one of whom is 
designated by the Chief Justice to be the Chief Judge. 

Generally, three judges hear and decide a case. The 
Court may, however, sit en banc, which means that the 
entire Court participates in the ruling. After an appeal 
has been decided by the Appellate Court, the Supreme 
Court can certify it for further review, upon the petition 
of an aggrieved party or by the Appellate Court panel 
that decided the case, if three justices of the Supreme 
Court vote for certification.

The Appellate Court also conducts off-site oral 
argument of cases from its regular docket at 
Connecticut high schools. The sessions are held in 
the same way as they would be held in the Appellate 
Court’s courtroom. Teachers and students are supplied 
with advance materials, including the briefs filed. 
Informational talks are held for the students, after 
the arguments, with the counsel who argued the 
cases. Over the biennium, the Court visited Stamford’s 
Westhill High School and Branford High School.

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Appellate Court  
During the Biennium

Atkinson v. Santore, 135 Conn. App. 76, cert. 
denied, 305 Conn. 909 (2012).

Komondy v. Zoning Board of Appeals, 127 
Conn. App. 669 (2011).

The plaintiff brought this action against the defendant 
pursuant to General Statutes § 22-357, commonly 
known as the dog bite statute. The plaintiff claimed 
that, while babysitting for the defendant’s children, 
she was potentially exposed to the rabies virus 
due to her contact with the defendant’s dogs after 
she found them in the vicinity of a rabid raccoon in 
the defendant’s yard. The plaintiff claimed that the 
defendant was strictly liable for such potential exposure 
and its consequences, including the cost of and the 
pain associated with the resulting administration 
of her antirabies injections. The trial court granted 
summary judgment for the defendant, finding that the 
only conduct by which the defendant’s dogs might be 
claimed to have exposed the plaintiff to the rabies virus 
was entirely passive, and, thus, completely innocent 
and involuntary rather than volitional, vicious  
or mischievous. 

On appeal, the Appellate Court upheld the decision 
of the trial court that strict liability under § 22-357 
does not extend to damage caused by a dog’s merely 
passive, and, thus, innocent or involuntary, behavior. 
In so holding, the Appellate Court noted that strict 
liability appropriately is imposed on dog owners and 
keepers for damage caused by volitional and vicious 
or mischievous conduct of their dogs because it is 
reasonably foreseeable that dogs as a species will 
engage in such inherently dangerous behavior. Strict 
liability is not imposed, by contrast, for damage caused 
by the involuntary or innocent behavior of dogs because 
no special risk of harm foreseeably arises from such 
passive, nonaggressive behavior. The Appellate Court 
further disagreed with the plaintiff’s contention that, 
assuming the court employed the proper legal analysis 
in evaluating the defendant’s statutory liability, there 
was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the 
plaintiff’s potential exposure to rabies resulted from the 
defendant’s dogs’ affirmative conduct. 

The plaintiff owned property in an R-1 residential 
district in the town of Chester. After the residence 
on the property was destroyed by a fire, the plaintiff 
applied for and was granted a six-month use permit 
to install a temporary mobile home on the property 
during the reconstruction of her home. The permit 
was granted pursuant to section 113B.5 of the town 
zoning regulations, which permits the temporary use 
of a mobile home on property during the construction 
of a permanent dwelling. That section expressly limits 
the use to a period of six months. Approximately one 
year and four months after the permit was granted, the 
zoning enforcement officer issued a cease and desist 
order regarding the use of the mobile home on the 
property. The zoning enforcement officer subsequently 
denied the plaintiff’s request for an extension of the 
permit. The plaintiff then filed an appeal with the 
zoning board of appeals from both the cease and desist 
order and the denial of her request for an extension. 
She also applied for a variance from the six-month 
time limit contained in § 113B.5. Following a public 
hearing, the board voted to deny both the appeal from 
the decisions of the zoning enforcement officer and the 
application for a variance from § 113B.5. The plaintiff 
then appealed to the Superior Court, which rejected 
the plaintiff’s claim that the board acted illegally in 
allowing an unseated alternate to participate in the 
public hearing and the board’s deliberations. Following 
the dismissal of her appeal, the plaintiff appealed 
to the Appellate Court, challenging only the court’s 
determination regarding the unseated alternate’s 
participation in the public hearing and the board’s 
deliberations. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the 
unseated alternate’s participation in the proceedings 
rendered the board’s action on her applications illegal.

Biennial Report 2010-2012    13

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Appellate Court During the Biennium

The Appellate Court first concluded that because 
participation in the public hearing is neither a power nor 
duty set forth in the General Statutes relating to zoning 
boards of appeal and their members, the participation 
of an unseated alternate in the public hearing portion of 
the board’s proceedings is not precluded. The Appellate 
Court further held, however, that General Statutes § 
8-5 (a) does preclude the participation of an unseated 
alternate in board deliberations following the close of 
the public hearing. In so holding, the Appellate Court 
analogized the unseated alternate board member to an 
alternate juror. Finally, the court clarified the standard 
to apply in determining whether such impropriety 
mandates reversal of the Superior Court. 

State v. Lahai, 128 Conn. App. 448, cert. 
denied, 301 Conn. 934 (2011).

The defendant appealed from the judgment of 
conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of assault in 
the third degree. He also appealed from the judgment 
of conviction on Part B of the information of being a 
persistent offender in violation of General Statutes 
(Rev. 2007) § 53a-40d. On appeal, the defendant 
argued, inter alia, that he was deprived of his 
constitutional right to confrontation under the sixth 
amendment to the United States constitution during the 
second part of the Part B proceeding, which addressed 
whether an enhanced sentence would best serve the 
public interest. Specifically, the defendant argued 
that the court improperly admitted into evidence a 
police incident report and allowed the state to adduce 
testimony of an inspector for the state related thereto. 
The defendant argued that the police report and 
testimony constituted testimonial hearsay violative of 
his right of confrontation. 

The Appellate Court began by noting that according to 
Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 61, 124 S. Ct. 
1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004), the sixth amendment 
prohibits the use of an out-of-court testimonial 
statement against a criminal defendant unless the 
witness is unavailable and the defendant was afforded 
a prior opportunity to cross examine him. The Appellate 
Court, therefore, considered whether police reports are 
testimonial in nature, thereby implicating a defendant’s 

right of confrontation. The court held that a police 
report is a quintessential example of an extrajudicial 
statement contained in a formalized testimonial 
material, and observed that the statement of a law 
enforcement official memorialized under oath in a police 
report is one made under circumstances, which would 
lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the 
statement would be available for use at a later trial. 
The court further noted that police reports routinely 
are submitted as evidence in criminal prosecutions 
throughout the state. Accordingly, the court held that 
the police report was testimonial in nature. The court 
further held, however, although the admission of the 
police report in question violated the defendant’s right 
of confrontation, the state met its burden of proving 
that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

State v. Legrand, 129 Conn. App. 239, cert. 
denied, 302 Conn. 912 (2011).

After observing the defendant operating a vehicle 
in an erratic manner, a police officer effectuated a 
stop of the defendant. The defendant failed certain 
field sobriety tests and was taken into custody. Police 
officers conducted a search of the defendant’s vehicle 
and found seven pills, five of which were narcotics, 
in the center console. At trial, the defendant claimed 
as a defense that any narcotics in his system did not 
have an intoxicating effect because he had become 
stabilized and tolerant of the medications. In support 
of this theory, the defendant presented the testimony 
of Herbert Reiher, his treating physician and an expert 
regarding the effect of the defendant’s medication 
on his ability to operate a motor vehicle safely. In 
anticipation of Reiher’s testimony, the state served a 
subpoena on Reiher seeking both his presence and 
all medical records of treatment and medications for 
the defendant for a specified time period. The trial 
court found that the defendant was not taking his 
medications as prescribed but rather, was taking them 
in excess of the amount prescribed. The court found the 
defendant guilty of operating a motor vehicle under the 
influence of drugs and failure to keep a narcotic drug 
in the original container. The defendant subsequently 
admitted to being a repeat offender. 

14    Biennial Report 2010-2012

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Appellate Court During the Biennium

On appeal, the defendant first argued that the state’s 
use of a subpoena rather than a search warrant to 
seize his medical records violated his federal and state 
constitutional rights. Examining the defendant’s claim 
that the subpoena issued by the prosecutor was in 
violation of fourth amendment to the United States 
constitution, the Appellate Court first reviewed the key 
differences between a search warrant and a subpoena. 
Next, applying precedents from other state and 
federal courts, the Appellate Court concluded that the 
subpoena issued by the prosecutor was reasonable, and 
therefore did not violate the fourth amendment. The 
Appellate Court next considered whether the state’s use 
of a subpoena rather then a search warrant violated 
the defendant’s rights under article first, § 7 of the 
state constitution. In this regard, the court analyzed 
the six factors set forth in State v. Geisler, 222 Conn. 
672, 684-85, 610 A. 2d 1225 (1992), for analyzing 
an independent claim under the state constitution. 
Applying these factors to the present case, the 
defendant could not prevail on his claim of enhanced 
protection under the state constitution. Accordingly, the 
Appellate Court concluded that the defendant’s rights 
under article first, § 7, of the Connecticut constitution 
were not violated.

Appellate Court Courtroom, 75 Elm St., Hartford

The defendant next argued that the disclosure of his 
medical records was in violation of the protections 
afforded to communications between a patient and a 
psychiatrist pursuant to General Statutes §§ 52-146d 
and 52-146e, as well as § 17a-688. Assuming that the 
trial court improperly admitted the medical records, 
the Appellate Court concluded that the defendant 
had failed to establish that such error was harmful. 
Specifically, the court noted that the state used other 
evidence outside of the mental health records to prove 
that the defendant had been abusing his narcotic 
medication and therefore was intoxicated as a result of 
this misuse. The court also held that any error in the 
admission of the records did not substantially affect the 
outcome and, accordingly, the defendant had failed to 
demonstrate how he was harmed by the admission of 
this evidence.

The Appellate Court also considered the defendant’s 
claims regarding his conviction of failure to keep a 
narcotic drug in the original container in violation of 
General Statutes § 21a-257. First, notwithstanding the 
defendant’s argument to the contrary, the Appellate 
Court held that the evidence was sufficient to support 
the defendant’s conviction of this offense. The Appellate 
Court next held that General Statutes § 21a-257 is not 
unconstitutionally vague despite the lack of knowledge 
or intent requirement, as the legislature may define 
crimes, which depend on no mental element, but 
consist only of forbidden acts or omissions. The court 
also rejected the defendant’s argument that, due to 
the rarity of prosecutions for this offense, the statute 
is also unconstitutionally vague due to the doctrine 
of desuetude. Although there is not a significant 
amount of reported cases that cite to this statute or 
its predecessors, such cases do exist. Further, the 
record was devoid of evidence that § 21a-257 has been 
openly, notoriously and pervasively violated without 
prosecution for a long period of time or that there has 
been a conspicuous policy of nonenforcement. 

Biennial Report 2010-2012    15

that would require petitioners to state that biological 
material is incontrovertibly present. Accordingly, the 
court held that in order to satisfy § 54-102kk (a), a 
petitioner must make a preliminary showing supported 
by a reasonable basis in fact that the evidence sought 
to be tested likely contains biological material. Applying 
this standard to the present case, the Appellate Court 
concluded that the trial court properly determined that 
the petitioner failed to satisfy § 54-102kk (a).

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Appellate Court During the Biennium

State v. Solman, 131 Conn. App. 846, cert. 
denied, 303 Conn. 915 (2011).

The petitioner was convicted of assault in the first 
degree, burglary in the first degree, risk of injury 
to a child and criminal possession of a firearm. The 
petitioner filed a postconviction petition for DNA testing 
of the live .22 caliber bullet recovered from the crime 
scene, pursuant to General Statutes § 54-102kk (a). 
That statute provides, in relevant part, that “any 
person who was convicted of a crime and sentenced to 
incarceration may... file a petition with the sentencing 
court requesting the DNA testing of any evidence 
that is in the possession or control of the Division of 
Criminal Justice... The petitioner shall state under 
penalties of perjury that the requested testing is related 
to the investigation or prosecution that resulted in the 
petitioner’s conviction and that the evidence sought to 
be tested contains biological evidence.”

The petitioner alleged that the bullet was in evidence, 
it was capable of being subjected to DNA testing, it 
had not previously been subjected to DNA testing, and 
there was a reasonable probability that the petitioner 
would not have been prosecuted or convicted if 
exculpatory results had been obtained through DNA 
testing of the bullet. At the hearing before the trial 
court, the petitioner stipulated, inter alia, that it was 
unlikely that the bullet actually contained any testable 
biological material. The trial court denied the petition 
for DNA testing, concluding that the petitioner failed to 
satisfy the statutory condition that the evidence sought 
to be tested contains biological evidence. 

On appeal, the petitioner argued that General Statutes 
§ 54-102kk (a) merely requires that petitions be 
accompanied by statements under oath that the 
petitions are being filed in good faith. The Appellate 
Court rejected the petitioner’s argument in light of the 
statutory requirement that “the evidence sought to 
be tested contains biological evidence.” The Appellate 
Court also rejected a construction of § 54-102kk (a)

Ensuring Access to Justice in Difficult Times

The Judicial Branch, along with the Executive 
and Legislative branches, has worked 
hard over the past two years to meet its 
constitutional responsibilities, while at the 
same time shouldering its fair share of 
budget cuts. This has not been an easy task, 
but through innovation and dedication the 
Branch has enhanced access to justice for the 
residents of Connecticut.

The Access to Justice Commission was 
established in 2011 to oversee and 
coordinate all of the Branch’s efforts in this 
area. While its charge is broad, a key area 
the Commission is addressing is one of our 
court system’s biggest challenges – providing 
access to self-represented parties. 

v  Information Officers  

(Courthouse Greeter Program) 

There are Information Officers (“Greeters”) in four 
Judicial District court locations: New Haven, Milford, 
Norwich and Hartford at 90 Washington St. This 
program provides court patrons with access to a 
knowledgeable court employee who can answer their 
questions and put them at ease as they enter the 
facility. To date, nearly 25,000 court patrons have 
been assisted by the Information Officers. 

For the calendar year 2011,  
the Court Service Centers and  
Public Information Desks provided  
assistance and services to more than 
264,000 self-represented parties.

Here are some of the other ways that the Judicial 
Branch has improved access to our courts:

v  Court Service Centers and Public  

Information Desks

v  Creation and expansion of the Judicial Branch 

Volunteer Attorney Program

This program has been established in five Judicial 
District court locations in the areas of family and 
foreclosure law to provide legal advice and assistance 
to self-represented parties who need legal help. 
The family programs are in the Hartford, Waterbury 
and Stamford Judicial Districts, and the foreclosure 
programs operate in the New Haven and Bridgeport 
courts. More than 100 volunteers have signed up to 
participate in these programs. Collectively, they have 
assisted nearly 3,000 self-represented parties with 
their family or foreclosure questions. There are plans 
to expand these programs to other Judicial Districts. 

For the calendar year 2011, the Court Service 
Centers and Public Information Desks provided 
assistance and services to more than 264,000  
self-represented parties, nearly 42,000 attorneys and 
more than 29,600 other individuals, such as social 
service providers, witnesses, jurors and marshals. 

v  Pro Bono Summit

In October 2011, the Judicial Branch’s Pro Bono 
Committee sponsored its first-ever Pro Bono Summit, 
which more than 100 attorneys attended. As part 
of this effort, a catalogue describing all of the pro 
bono opportunities in Connecticut was developed 
and made available to the Bar. Since the summit, 
a number of law firms and bar associations have 
heeded the call and developed new initiatives to 
assist people in need of legal assistance.

v  Limited English Proficiency Initiatives

v  Advisory Board on the Americans with 

Disabilities Act

–  More than 500 requests by members of the public 

for ADA accommodations were processed, including 
those from jurors, parties to cases and attorneys;

–  Visits were conducted with each Judicial Marshal 

Services’ office in all 13 Judicial Districts to identify

–  ADA sensitivity and problem-solving training 

was developed as a pilot program for the Judicial 
Marshal Services Unit. 

Connecticut state courts have made significant 
progress in assisting individuals for whom English  
is not their primary language. 

The Committee on Limited English Proficiency is 
continuing its efforts to eliminate barriers to facilities, 
processes and information so that the LEP population 
has meaningful access to justice. 

Activities of the Committee on Limited English 
Proficiency include:

–  LEP training programs for Branch employees;

–  Engaging in outreach efforts to the LEP population 
through community and media organizations; and 

–  Expanding language assistance through telephonic 
services. A related recommendation to “emphasize 
and continue to encourage use of telephonic 
bilingual services, particularly during non-court 
hours and weekends” has been implemented as 
well. Also, information regarding the available 
telephonic bilingual services is included in the LEP 
training to all employees.

October 2011. The project maintained the integrity 
of the historical facade, while the new windows will 
allow for greater energy efficiency. 

v  New London Judicial District Courthouse 

exterior restoration: The historic courthouse, 
originally built in 1784, is the oldest operating court 
in the country. The exterior restoration began in 
August 2011 and was near completion in September 
2012 when a fire broke out in the attic. Extensive 
damage occurred, and completion of the project 
is delayed while repair work is being designed 
and implemented. Included in the project is the 
replacement of the slate roof, repairing the cupola, 
installing a replica of the original weathervane, 
structural repairs and replacing the clapboards.

v  Leasing: The Judicial Branch relocated its Danielson 
Adult Probation Office in April 2012 to a better suited 
location that allows for better ADA accessibility. In 
addition, the Branch terminated two leases in cost-
saving measures – the Danbury parking lease in 
September 2011 and an administrative office lease in 
Hartford a month later. Also, the Middletown Juvenile 
Courthouse lease expired in June 2012; cases and 
personnel transferred to the Middlesex Judicial 
District Courthouse. 

v  Branchwide Learning Management System 

(LMS): This initiative was rolled out after 
approximately two years of development. The 
system provides scheduling and evaluation tools for 
training, notifications to staff and supervisors and 
also electronic transcripts. LMS has a centralized 
electronic database for training histories of 
employees and has proven an integral tool for staff 
pre-service and continuing education requirements.

The Court Support Services Division (CSSD) oversees pretrial 
services, family services and probation supervision of adults 
and juveniles as well as juvenile detention services. CSSD 
also prepares pre-sentence investigation reports, which 
judges may order for use when sentencing defendants. In 
addition, CSSD administers a network of statewide contracted 
community providers that deliver services to court-ordered 
clients. 

Highlights of the past two years include: 

v  In concert with the rollout of Results Based Accountability in 2009, 

CSSD set risk reduction performance goals for each operating unit, with 
the primary goal of reducing re-arrest rates. Since 2010, the 24-month 
adult probationer re-arrest rate has dropped by two percentage points 
and six percentage points since 2007. Similarly, the 24-month juvenile 
probationer re-arrest rate has dropped three percentage points. In 
the domestic violence area, CSSD continues to see re-arrest rates for 
offenders hold steady at 12 to 13 percent in the 12 months following 
supervision, which is low compared with other states and published 
literature. Alternative in the Community (AIC) re-arrest rates in the 12 
months following services have dropped two percentage points since 
2010 and by more than five percentage points since 2007.

v  The transfer of 16- and 17-year-olds to the juvenile justice system was 
completed in two phases; 16-year-olds entered effective Jan. 1, 2010, 
and 17-year-olds, July 1, 2012. With funding from the Legislature, 
additional juvenile probation officers, detention officers and clinical 
coordinators were hired, and CSSD also expanded community-based 
services. 

v  CSSD partnered with the Center for Children’s Law and Policy of 
Washington, D.C. and the Center for Children’s Advocacy at the 
University of Connecticut School of Law to initiate disproportionate 
minority contact reduction efforts in Hartford and Bridgeport. This 
resulted in decreases in school-based arrests and the implementation of 
a revised graduated response system that includes both sanctions and 
incentives, and increased diversion from court. 

v  CSSD created a pilot program to help address the increased involvement 
of youth in gang-related activities. “Reaching, Engaging, Strengthening 
Teens to Build Opportunities and Relationship to End Violence” (RESTORE) 
will be piloted in the New Haven, Bridgeport and Hartford areas.

v  Adult Probation established domestic violence units 
in every office. Probation officers assigned to these 
units received specialized training and work closely 
with the court locations that have DV dockets. These 
officers also work closely with victim advocates and 
domestic violence treatment programs.

v  The Alert Notification/GPS program was piloted in 
three court locations (Bridgeport, Danielson and 
Hartford). The goal of the Alert Notification/GPS pilot 
was to enhance the surveillance of high-risk family 
violence cases in Connecticut. The court ordered 
a total of 172 defendants to participate in the 
program, and results demonstrated increased victim 
safety. The program includes 24/7 monitoring of the 
defendant, increased case management service and 
enhanced response regarding  
violations of court-ordered 
conditions. The Legislature 
in turn has appropriated 
continued funding for  
the project. 

automated process for real-time entry of bail no 
contact orders into the protective order registry. This 
information can be accessed 24/7 by local and state 
police and enhances victim safety. 

v  In response to legislation, new intensive probation 
alternatives have been implemented in every adult 
probation office. This program facilitates the release 
of inmates from the Department of Correction 
and includes three programs: intensive pretrial 
supervision, alternative sentencing plans  
and sentence modifications. More than 300 
individuals have been released from DOC to one  
of these programs. 

v  Due to the success of CSSD’s Women Case 

Management model in four pilot sites, the model 
has been expanded and implemented in all adult 
probation offices. This gender responsive approach 
to supervision has been well received and has been 
very successful in meeting the needs of women  
on probation.

v  CSSD expanded its specialized mental health units to 
all probation offices in the state. These clients have 
benefited greatly from the supervision and treatment 
plans created with their probation officers.

v  Adult probation offices in Hartford and New Haven 
have partnered with state, local and federal law 
enforcement agencies to address gun violence 
occurring in these communities. Weekly meetings 
are held with local law enforcement officials and 
with probation officers assigned to monitor high-risk 
probationers who have a history of gun violence. 
Reporting sites have been established in the  
affected neighborhoods and home visits are regularly 
conducted with the police. These units have been 
effective in helping reduce gun violence in  
these cities.

Department. This pilot allows staff to conduct 
interviews for individuals held on bond at the  
Enfield Police Department from either the Hartford  
or New Britain bail offices. This process eliminates 
hours of travel time and allows bail staff to interview 
more individuals held on bond during evening 
and weekend shifts. This pilot program has been 
expanded to the Manchester and West Haven police 
departments as well as a number of Department of 
Correction facilities.

The External Affairs Division furnishes and facilitates the 
exchange of information about the Judicial Branch to the 
Legislative and Executive Branches, the public, community 
organizations, schools and the news media. The division  
also manages the volunteer and intern, job shadow and  
court aide programs and oversees the design of Judicial 
Branch publications.

Highlights of the past two years include:

v  The review of thousands of bills, many of which affect the Judicial 

Branch. Provisions of note that passed include:

–  An increase in certain court filing fees; 70 percent of the funds 

generated will be used to provide legal services to the poor and the 
remaining 30 percent will be used to fund technology projects within 
the Judicial Branch.

–  The establishment of a commission to make recommendations 

regarding judicial compensation.

–  Authorization for the use of electronic communication of court orders. 

–  Indemnification for attorneys who are appointed by the court to act 
as trustees to handle the pending cases of attorneys who have been 
suspended or disbarred, or who have resigned. 

–  Authorization to expand the use of video conferencing to conduct bail 
interviews of persons who have been arrested and are being held at a 
police station.

–  Elimination of the $100 deductible that had been required before a 

crime victim can benefit from the compensation program. 

v  The External Affairs Division assisted a total of 49 judges and judge trial 

referees through the legislative reappointment process.

v  The External Affairs Division has played an integral role in implementing 
rules adopted by the Superior Court judges in 2011 regarding the use of 
electronic devices in courtrooms by the news media. The Hartford Pilot 
Program, which had been in effect since January 1, 2008, was expanded 
statewide effective January 1, 2012. In the first half of 2012, External 
Affairs processed more than 400 media requests to have cameras in  
the courts.

v  The biennium marked the highest number of camera requests submitted 
by the media and granted by judges. In the last biennium, during 2008 
and 2009, for example, judges granted 491 requests throughout the 
state. This biennium, judges granted a total of 994 requests, nearly 
doubling the amount of requests granted from the previous two years.

v  Over the past two fiscal years, the External Affairs 

Division has addressed nearly 5,000 media inquiries. 
The division also provided a staff liaison to the 
Judicial Media Committee and assisted the Branch’s 
second Journalism School for Judges in 2011, and 
the Branch’s third Law School for Journalists in 2012.

v  The External Affairs Division established a Twitter 
account for the Judicial Branch; the account has 
more than 1,100 followers. Information is sent out 
regularly about new initiatives as well as courthouse 
closings and delayed openings.

v  The Speakers Bureau remains the Branch’s primary 
outreach effort to civic organizations, senior groups 
and other community groups. Judges spoke about 
the role of the Judicial Branch, their experiences on 
the bench and other relevant topics at more than 250 
Speakers Bureau events over the biennium. 

v  The External Affairs Division provides students and 
members of the public with the opportunity to visit 
the Supreme Court courtroom and to learn about 
its role in our democracy. More than 300 tours 
and presentations have been conducted over the 
biennium including the popular summer program 
entitled Day Trips with Kids. This program is  
co-sponsored by the State Capitol, the Museum  
of Connecticut History and the Old State House,  
and provides families with the opportunity to visit  
all three branches of government.

v  The External Affairs Division enhanced the Branch’s 
outreach to schools by participating in Read Across 
America Day, the national celebration of reading, 
which takes place each year on Dr. Seuss’ birthday. 
In 2012, a total of 44 justices, judges, family support 
magistrates and probate court judges read to more 
than 2,600 students in 43 schools.

v  The Intern Program administered by the External 

Affairs Division continues to be an integral part of the 
Judicial Branch’s outreach to students. In calendar 
year 2010, 369 college students successfully 
completed their internships; in calendar year 2011, 
327 college students successfully completed their 
internships. These students collectively provided 
115,986 hours to the Judicial Branch with a net value 
of just under $2.5 million. 

The External Affairs Division  
established a Twitter account for  
the Judicial Branch; the account  
has more than 1,100 followers.

v  The External Affairs Division provides opportunities 
for high school students to learn about the Judicial 
Branch through a variety of programs and recently 
developed a brochure to promote these programs. 
They include the Court Aide Program, where high 
school seniors can volunteer to work in the courts 
and accumulate community service hours that can be 
put toward graduation requirements. Additionally, the

The Information Technology Division (ITD) is responsible 
for the Judicial Branch’s data processing and publication 
services through the implementation and support of a 
statewide network and computing platform, enterprise class 
data storage systems, desktop resources and a full-service 
printing and publications office. The division also manages a 
technology services HelpDesk and performs a crucial role in 
the development and maintenance of the Branch’s website.

Highlights over the past two years include:

v  During this biennium, the division continued improving the Branch’s For 
the Record (FTR) digital equipment recording system, which provides 
accurate and timely recordings of court proceedings. For example, FTR 
was upgraded in 30 juvenile and 108 adult courtrooms. In June of 2012, 
the State Bond Commission approved $1.48 million in bond funding 
for the FTR project. This funding provides the resources necessary 
to complete the rollout of FTR technology to 85 more courtrooms, to 
purchase emergency backup FTR systems for every courthouse and to 
purchase software that will allow for centralized interpreting and the 
monitoring of multiple courtrooms from one FTR device. An innovative 
development using the FTR technology is the current pilot program 
at the Middletown Child Protection Session that makes digital audio 
recordings and log notes of court proceedings available over the Internet 
to attorneys associated with the case – including lawyers from the 
Attorney General’s and Department of Children and Families’ offices – 
after they have securely logged into e-services.

v  In the continuing effort to move from paper to electronic files, one 

significant milestone reached was the completion of a nearly two-year 
project in June 2012 that enabled the permanent shutdown of the 
40-year old Civil/Family Case Management System. All of that legacy 
system’s remaining data and functionality was moved into the current 
state-of-the-art Civil/Family Case Management and e-filing system. 
As a result, for example, restrictive barriers on the number of parties 
involved in a case and the number of motions and orders that can be 
accommodated were eliminated. Equally significant, all case updates 
happen in real time and are available for online viewing immediately by 
the public as well as attorneys and others associated with the case. 

v  The addition of Small Claims e-filing for attorneys and self-represented 
parties to e-services has improved the processing of those cases in a 
relatively short time. Expanding e-filing to self-represented parties also 
lays the foundation for a similar expansion in civil and family e-filing.

v  Significant technology improvements have been implemented for 
the appellate courts including the creation of a Public Web Inquiry 
application that provides case information for Supreme and Appellate 
Court cases filed after Jan. 1, 1991.

Information Technology Division

v  A major technology refresh is underway to replace 
near-obsolete electronic data storage equipment 
with new equipment capable of meeting the Judicial 
Branch’s growing needs and providing crucial fault-
tolerant capabilities. This new technology delivers 
10 times more storage capacity and can copy critical 
data to the Alternate Processing Center (APC) in 
Waterbury so it is available in the event of a Data 
Center disaster. The new technology is also more 
efficient and compact requiring less physical space, 
but providing a higher degree of performance. This 
technology refresh is expected to be complete by 
early 2013.

v  The Judicial Branch continues to expand its use 
of video conferencing technology; almost every 
Judicial Branch facility now has video conferencing 
capabilities. These range from the full-featured, 
large screen systems with high definition monitors 
and state-of-the-art audio equipment found in all 
Judicial Districts and juvenile courts, and selected 
other locations, to the PC-based systems at smaller 
sites. Video conferencing technology also is used by 
Support Enforcement Services for hearings and the 
Court Support Services Division for interviews and 
proceedings with inmates.

v  The fully operational Centralized Infractions Bureau 
(CIB) E-Pay website not only allows the payment 
of infraction tickets online, but also was upgraded 
to accept “Not Guilty” pleas and to process multiple 
infraction tickets with one transaction. Currently, CIB 
E-Pay is averaging 390 payments per week for an 
average of $63,000.

v  ITD also implemented a system to process electronic 
citations instead of paper tickets. There are currently 
40-plus state and local agencies participating, 
including the State Police and the Capitol Region 
Council of Governments (CRCOG). The average 
ticket issue-to-entry (for electronic tickets) has been 
reduced from 32.4 days to 7.5 days. Over 70,000 
tickets have been processed via e-citations to date.

v  The division participated with other Criminal Justice 
Information System (CJIS) agencies in the creation 
and launch of the Connecticut Impaired Driving 
Records Information System (CIDRIS). CIDRIS 
provides electronic information on OUI (operating 
under the influence) arrests from law enforcement 
to court personnel for the electronic creation of court 
cases in the Criminal Motor Vehicle System.

v  ITD created and implemented the Child Protection 

Docket Access web application that allows real time 
access to information maintained by the legacy 
Child Protection application for attorneys and other 
agencies associated with a child’s case.

ITD also implemented a system  
to process electronic citations  
instead of paper tickets.

v  Between June 2010 and April 2011, ITD Desktop 

and Field Technicians, along with technicians from 
the Superior Court Operations and Court Support 
Services Divisions, formed an expanded team for 
a statewide refresh of desktop computers. During 
this time, the team replaced over 2,000 of the 
Branch’s oldest computers with the latest technology 
available. The refresh, which represents one-third 
of the Branch’s desktop computers, will ensure that 
those Judicial Branch personnel have the technology 
needed to support critical business functions today 
and many years into the future.

The Superior Court Operations Division assists the Judicial Branch in the 
administration of justice by providing quality services and information to 
the court, its users and the community in an effective, professional and 
courteous manner. The division provides judges and support staff with the 
resources needed to process cases. 

Highlights of the past two years include: 

v  Beginning in November 2011, notices sent by the court on most civil 

cases became available to the public via the Internet. This amounts to 
approximately 1.5 million notices. 

v  In 2012, a Land Use Litigation Docket was established in the Hartford 
Judicial District. The following land use case types are considered for 
transfer to the docket: planning, zoning, inland, wetlands, environmental 
enforcement and miscellaneous land use litigation. 

v  Backlogs in small claims cases have been eliminated, and attorneys and 

self-represented parties can take advantage of e-filing. 

v  The short calendar system was enhanced to streamline notices mailed 
to self-represented parties and to provide clerks with more accurate 
information regarding motions scheduled for upcoming calendars.

v  Orders to incarcerate, issued by judges for willful non-payment of 

fines, were added to the Paperless Rearrest Warrant Network (PRAWN). 
Additionally, orders to incarcerate, failure to appear and violation of 
probation warrants are now available to the public through the Judicial 
Branch’s website.

v  Staff assigned to the six Housing Session court locations were fully 

trained on the use of the Criminal Motor Vehicle System (CRMVS) for 
processing criminal cases that are prosecuted in these courts. These 
previously had been processed manually. 

v  A short calendar pilot program has been implemented in family matters 

to reduce delays and improve case management. Self-represented 
parties now appear in court at later times than the attorneys to allow the 
self-represented parties sufficient time to prepare for their hearings. 

v  Juror confirmations are now available via the Judicial Branch’s website, 

and approximately 60 jurors per day access the website to confirm their 
service dates. Additionally, jurors may now postpone their jury service 
via the Judicial Branch’s website at any time – day or night.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
