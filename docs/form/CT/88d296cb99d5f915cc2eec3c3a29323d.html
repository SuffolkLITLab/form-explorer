(AC 45434)

Moll, Clark and DiPentima, Js.

Syllabus

The respondent mother appealed to this court from the judgment of the
trial court terminating her parental rights with respect to her minor
child, K. The mother came to the United States from Jamaica on a tourist
visa and, two months later, gave birth to K in Hartford. The mother
returned to Jamaica with K but later sent K to live with relatives in
Connecticut when she was unable to care for K. The Department of
Children and Families became involved with K when one of the relatives
physically abused K, and the mother, at that time living in Nevada,
remained unable to care for K or to identify another caretaker to the
department. Thereafter, the court adjudicated K neglected following a
petition filed by the petitioner, the Commissioner of Children and Fami-
lies, and ordered final steps for the mother. The mother returned to
Connecticut, where she was unable to obtain a job or housing due to
her lack of citizenship or documentation as her tourist visa had expired
but she did attend in-person visits and maintain telephone or virtual
contact with K as well as attend counseling. Subsequently, the mother
moved to Mississippi, and she continued to have regular video or tele-
phone contact with K for approximately two years, although she declined
to continue therapy. While in Mississippi, the mother gave birth to
another child, D. The department, on learning of D’s birth, verified D’s
well-being through contact with the child protective services agency in
Mississippi. Thereafter, the department filed a petition for termination
of the mother’s parental rights as to K. The department subsequently
learned that the mother had moved to Nevada with D, where she received
counseling and assistance with immigration though a homeless shelter
and, ultimately, obtained employment and her own apartment. The trial
court found that the mother had failed to rehabilitate sufficiently to
satisfy the requirements of the applicable statute (§ 17a-112 (j) (3) (B)
(1)). On appeal, the mother claimed, inter alia, that the trial court violated
her rights to due process by ordering K’s attorney to call an additional
witness at trial after the close of evidence and it was precluded from
finding that she failed to rehabilitate because the department interfered
with her parent-child relationship by threatening to remove D if she
returned to Connecticut. Held:

1. Contrary to the respondent mother’s claim, the evidence before the trial
court was sufficient to support its factual finding, by clear and convincing
evidence, that the department made reasonable efforts to reunify the
mother with K: the evidence before the court included the department’s
referral of the mother to mental health services, the commencement of
supervised, in-person visitation with K in Connecticut, referrals of the
mother to agencies to assist her with housing, immigration and employ-
ment issues, the department’s continual efforts to contact the mother
after she had left the state, its offers to pay for mental health treatment
outside of Connecticut, and encouragement to communicate with K’s
therapist; moreover, although some of the department’s efforts to assist
the mother with housing and employment were unsuccessful due to the
mother’s immigration status, the department was persistent in making
referrals for the mother to assistive services and made reasonable efforts
under the circumstances of this case; furthermore, it was reasonable,
under the circumstances, for the department to defer providing psycho-
education services to the mother until she addressed her own mental
health issues, and, when the department arranged for K’s therapist to
provide such services to the mother, she specifically declined.

2. This court declined to address the respondent mother’s unpreserved claim
that the trial court erred in finding that the department was not required
to make reasonable efforts to reunify her with K pursuant to statute
(§ 17a-111b (a) (2)), which she claimed was unconstitutional as applied
in this case, as this court concluded that the trial court properly found
that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify the mother

with K, and Connecticut courts follow the basic judicial duty to eschew
unnecessary determinations of constitutional questions.

3. The respondent mother could not prevail on her claim that the evidence
was insufficient to support the trial court’s finding that she had failed
to reach the requisite degree of rehabilitation to assume a responsible
position in K’s life:
a. Although the court made findings that the mother had successfully
addressed housing, employment, and mental health issues regarding her
ability to care for K, additional evidence, including testimony from K’s
therapist about the mother’s limited involvement and participation in
K’s treatment and her shortcomings in addressing K’s attachment issues,
supported the court’s subordinate findings.
b. The mother’s claim that the trial court was precluded from finding that
she had failed to achieve the requisite degree of personal rehabilitation
because the department’s conduct in threatening to remove D if she
returned to Connecticut amounted to improper interference with her
ability to maintain a relationship with K was unavailing: even assuming,
arguendo, that the exception preventing a petitioning party from termi-
nating parental rights on the basis of no ongoing parent-child relationship
when the petitioning party engaged in conduct that caused the lack of
relationship applied in failure to rehabilitate cases, the exception was
inapplicable under the facts of this case because the department social
worker’s statements were not threats but simply honest responses to
the respondent’s queries, as the information known to the department
at the time suggested legitimate child-protection issues, and, although
at one time a department employee told the mother that the removal of
D was a realistic possibility, the department later determined that D was
safe in her care and indicated that it would not attempt to remove him;
moreover, the mother’s lack of in-person visits and inability to meet K’s
particularized needs were exhibited well before the department indicated
to the mother that it would possibly remove D from her care if she
returned to Connecticut.

4. The respondent mother could not prevail on her unpreserved claim that
the trial court violated her rights to due process in asking K’s attorney
to call a witness at trial after she and the petitioner had rested their
cases: the mother’s counsel engaged in conduct clearly demonstrating
agreement and assent to the court’s conduct, as counsel did not object
when the court requested K’s attorney seek a witness to provide addi-
tional testimony, and counsel not only declined the court’s invitation
to withdraw its request but he actively participated in setting the parame-
ters for the inquiry, thoroughly cross-examined the witness and made
the strategic decision to call the witness as his own, thus, the mother
waived her due process claim pursuant to State v. Golding (213
Conn. 233).

Opinion

.

.

CLARK, J. The respondent mother, Isheika P., appeals
from the judgment of the trial court rendered in favor
of the petitioner, the Commissioner of Children and
Families, terminating her parental rights with respect
to her minor child, Kylie P. (Kylie).1 On appeal, the
respondent claims that the trial court (1) violated her
‘‘right to a fair trial by an impartial tribunal
. as
guaranteed by the due process clause to the United
States constitution’’ when it purportedly ordered Kylie’s
attorney to call an additional witness at trial after the
close of evidence, (2) was precluded from finding that
she failed to rehabilitate because the Department of
Children and Families (department) improperly inter-
fered with her parent-child relationship by threatening
to remove her youngest child if she returned to Connect-
icut, (3) erred in concluding that the department made
reasonable efforts to reunify her with Kylie, (4) erred
in concluding that the department was not required to
make reasonable efforts pursuant to General Statutes
§ 17a-111b (a) (2) because it already had approved a
permanency plan for termination of parental rights, and
(5) erred in finding that she failed to rehabilitate
because there was insufficient evidence on which to
make that finding. We affirm the judgment of the
trial court.

The following facts, as found by the trial court, and
procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The
respondent was born and raised in Jamaica. In 2015,
she came to the United States while pregnant with Kylie,
her fourth child, who was born in 2016 in Hartford.2
Two months later, the respondent returned to Jamaica
with Kylie.

In May, 2017, the respondent sent Kylie back to Con-
necticut to live with the respondent’s second cousin,
Lennox P. (Lennox), and his wife, Karla Y.-P. (Karla),
because the respondent was unable to care for Kylie
at that time. Kylie remained in the care of Lennox and
Karla for approximately ten months.

In early 2018, Kylie came to the department’s atten-
tion as a result of an application for temporary custody
filed in Probate Court by Lennox and Karla, which
stated that the respondent was living in Jamaica and
unable to care for Kylie. The Probate Court asked the
department to assess the application. While the depart-
ment was conducting its assessment of the matter, Len-
nox’s daughter, Shanice M. (Shanice), reported to the
department that her stepmother, Karla, was physically
abusing Kylie and provided photographs and specific
examples of abuse, including an allegation that Karla
slammed Kylie’s head while the two of them were in the
bathroom together, leaving a bruise above Kylie’s eye.

The department was able to contact the respondent
to inform her of Kylie’s injuries. It learned that the

respondent had moved from Jamaica to Nevada in June,
2017. During the respondent’s communications with the
department, she explained that she was not in a position
to care for her daughter and was unable to identify
another caretaker for her at that time.

Department social workers met with Karla, who
denied the allegations. The department social workers
concluded that the bruising they saw on Kylie’s face
and the injuries shown in the photographs that Shanice
provided were not consistent with the account provided
by Karla. On February 2, 2018, the department invoked
a ninety-six hour hold on Kylie, removing her from the
custody of the respondent and from the care of Lennox
and Karla.

On February 7, 2018, the petitioner filed an applica-
tion for an ex parte order of temporary custody, which
the court granted, and a neglect petition. The court
sustained the order of temporary custody following a
preliminary hearing on the ex parte order.3 On May
10, 2018, the court adjudicated Kylie as neglected and
ordered specific final steps for the respondent.

Arriving back in Connecticut, the respondent stayed
with relatives or lived in motels and hotels while she
tried to find a job and cope with the distress she was
experiencing about the abuse of Kylie and her inability
to provide a home for her daughter. The department
offered her regular supervised in-person visits and per-
mitted the foster parent to allow additional telephone
or virtual contact. Although Kylie did not initially recog-
nize the respondent, the department continued to offer
the respondent regular in-person visits, and a relation-
ship began to develop between them, although slowly
and sometimes painfully. For example, during the initial
visits, Kylie would gravitate toward the case aide rather
than the respondent. Although the respondent missed
almost one half of her scheduled visits, and the depart-
ment believed that she spent too much of her visitation
time on her phone or introducing Kylie to her relatives
and siblings, their relationship began to improve.

At some point, the respondent told the case aide that
she knew she needed to have her own housing in order
to get Kylie back but that it was hard for her to get her
own place because she did not have a job or citizenship.
As will be discussed in greater detail in part I of this
opinion, the department assisted the respondent in
addressing the barriers to her reunification with Kylie.

In September, 2018, the respondent moved to Missis-
sippi. She told the department that she was going there
for a short time to work as a maid and planned to return
to Connecticut. However, she stayed in Mississippi, not
informing the department that she actually had lived
there for several months. The respondent’s move to
Mississippi ended her in-person supervised visits with
Kylie, but she continued to have regular video or tele-

phone contact with her daughter facilitated by the foster
parents until sometime in 2020. Although the depart-
ment encouraged her to engage in therapy in Mississippi
like that she had been receiving in Connecticut and
even agreed to pay for the therapy, the respondent
declined to do so. Contact with the respondent became
sporadic between December, 2018, and March, 2019, as
the respondent would not answer or respond to the
department’s telephone calls.

Beginning on March 26, 2019, the respondent called
the department and spoke by telephone with depart-
ment staff four times over the following three weeks. In
one of those calls, the respondent informed department
staff that she had neither employment nor any funds
to return to Connecticut and was still unable to care
for Kylie. She had no more telephone contact with the
department until October, 2019.

In October, 2019, the respondent and a department
social worker connected by telephone. During that call,
the social worker heard a baby in the background and
asked her if she was babysitting someone’s child. She
informed the social worker that she had given birth to
a baby boy, Davonte, three months earlier. At that time,
the department had very little information about the
respondent’s situation. The social worker informed the
respondent that he would need to contact the local
child protective agency in Mississippi to have someone
verify Davonte’s well-being. A week later, Mississippi
child protection services informed the department that
it had made contact with the respondent and the new-
born child and that it had no concerns with respect to
Davonte’s safety and well-being.

On December 10, 2019, the petitioner filed a petition
for termination of parental rights alleging failure to
rehabilitate as to the respondent and abandonment and
no ongoing parent-child relationship as to the putative
father, Orlando F. An initial hearing on the termination
petition was held on January 30, 2020, which the respon-
dent attended in person. The respondent disclosed that,
at some point in late 2019, she had left Mississippi and
begun staying with relatives in Massachusetts. She told
the department that she left Mississippi because of an
incident between her and Davonte’s father, but she was
guarded in her statements to the department.

On February 11, 2020, the department learned that
the respondent had moved to Nevada. She informed
them that she was going to start college at the end of
March and rejected any referrals for parenting services,
mental health treatment, or legal aid. She emphasized
that she did not want any help from the department
and said that she was considering entering a shelter in
Reno for herself and her son. The department experi-
enced the same difficulty in maintaining contact with
the respondent that it had in 2019, with the respondent
not answering or responding to telephone calls and

communicating only by text message. At some point,
the department learned that the respondent was living
in a homeless shelter where she received the types of
services that the department had previously implored
her to seek: counseling from a licensed professional,
case management services to help her adjust to living
safely with her son in Nevada, and immigration counsel-
ing.4 By the end of 2020, the respondent was employed,
was residing in her own apartment in Nevada, and had
her son in child care while she was working.

On December 29, 2020, the respondent filed a motion
to revoke commitment of Kylie. She also filed a motion
for posttermination visitation in May, 2021. On June 3,
2021, the petitioner filed a motion to review perma-
nency plan. A hearing on those motions was consoli-
dated with a trial on the termination petition, which
took place over ten nonconsecutive days between May
25 and August 15, 2021.

On February 15, 2022, the court, Hon. Stephen F.
Frazzini, judge trial referee, issued an eighty-nine page
memorandum of decision terminating the respondent’s
parental rights and appointing the petitioner as Kylie’s
statutory parent. The court found, by clear and convinc-
ing evidence, that Kylie had been adjudicated neglected
on May 10, 2018, and that the respondent had failed to
rehabilitate sufficiently to satisfy the requirements of
General Statutes § 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (i). The court also
found that the department had made reasonable efforts
to locate the respondent and to reunify her with Kylie
and also that the respondent was unwilling or unable
to benefit from reunification services. Last, the court
found that termination of the respondent’s parental
rights was in Kylie’s best interests. The court denied
the respondent’s motion for revocation but granted her
motion for posttermination visitation. This appeal fol-
lowed. Additional facts with be set forth as necessary.

I

The respondent claims on appeal that the court erred
in concluding that the department made reasonable
efforts to reunify her with Kylie.5 Specifically, she
argues that the department identified several barriers
to reunifying her with her daughter, including her (1)
immigration status, (2) housing and employment, (3)
mental health, and (4) parenting skills and relationship
with Kylie. In the respondent’s view, the department
referred her to only a handful of services, such as in-
person visitation and individual counseling. The respon-
dent therefore contends that the evidence is insufficient
to establish that the department made reasonable
efforts to assist her in addressing her immigration sta-
tus, housing and employment, or her parenting skills
and relationship with Kylie. We are not persuaded.

Before addressing the respondent’s claim, we pause
to identify the pertinent legal principles and standard

of review. ‘‘Section 17a-112 (j) (1) requires that before
terminating parental rights, the court must find by clear
and convincing evidence that the department has made
reasonable efforts to locate the parent and to reunify
the child with the parent, unless the court finds in this
proceeding that the parent is unable or unwilling to
benefit from reunification efforts provided such finding
is not required if the court has determined at a hearing
. . . that such efforts are not appropriate . . . . Thus,
the department may meet its burden concerning reunifi-
cation in one of three ways: (1) by showing that it made
such efforts, (2) by showing that the parent was unable
or unwilling to benefit from reunification efforts or (3)
by a previous judicial determination that such efforts
were not appropriate.’’ (Internal quotation marks omit-
ted.) In re Ryder M., 211 Conn. App. 793, 808, 274 A.3d
218, cert. denied, 343 Conn. 931, 276 A.3d 433 (2022).
‘‘[I]n determining whether the department has made
reasonable efforts to reunify a parent and a child . . .
the court is required in the adjudicatory phase to make
its assessment on the basis of events preceding the date
on which the termination petition was filed. . . . This
court has consistently held that the court, [w]hen mak-
ing its reasonable efforts determination . . . is limited
to considering only those facts preceding the filing of
the termination petition or the most recent amendment
to the petition . . . .’’ (Emphasis omitted; internal quo-
tation marks omitted.) In re Cameron W., 194 Conn.
App. 633, 660, 221 A.3d 885 (2019), cert. denied, 334
Conn. 918, 222 A.3d 103 (2020).

‘‘The reasonableness of the department’s efforts must
be assessed in the context of each case. The word
reasonable is the linchpin on which the department’s
efforts in a particular set of circumstances are to be
adjudged, using the clear and convincing standard of
proof. Neither the word reasonable nor the word efforts
is, however, defined by our legislature or by the federal
act from which the requirement was drawn. . . . [R]ea-
sonable efforts means doing everything reasonable, not
everything possible. . . . [R]easonableness is an objec-
tive standard . . . and whether reasonable efforts have
been proven depends on the careful consideration of
the circumstances of each individual case.’’ (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) In re Gabriella A., 154 Conn.
App. 177, 182–83, 104 A.3d 805 (2014), aff’d, 319 Conn.
775, 127 A.3d 948 (2015).

Our review of the court’s reasonable efforts determi-
nation is subject to the evidentiary sufficiency standard
of review; see In re Corey C., 198 Conn. App. 41, 59,
232 A.3d 1237, cert. denied, 335 Conn. 930, 236 A.3d
217 (2020); that is, ‘‘whether the trial court could have
reasonably concluded, upon the facts established and
the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, that the
cumulative effect of the evidence was sufficient to jus-
tify its [ultimate conclusion].’’ (Internal quotation marks
omitted.) In re Harmony Q., 171 Conn. App. 568, 575,

157 A.3d 137, cert. denied, 325 Conn. 915, 159 A.3d 232
(2017). In so doing, ‘‘we construe the evidence in a
manner most favorable to sustaining the judgment of
the trial court’’ and ‘‘will not disturb the court’s subordi-
nate factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.’’
(Internal quotation marks omitted.) In re Leilah W.,
166 Conn. App. 48, 68, 141 A.3d 1000 (2016).

.

In the case at hand, the court found that the depart-
ment identified several barriers to reunifying Kylie with
the respondent, including the respondent’s immigration
status, which made it difficult for her to obtain employ-
ment, funds to support herself, or suitable housing;
her own mental health; her parenting skills; and her
relationship with Kylie. The court then set out in its
memorandum of decision a lengthy account of the vari-
ous reunification efforts made by the department. After
describing the efforts and the events that transpired,
the court concluded that ‘‘[t]he evidence proved clearly
and convincingly that [the department] made reason-
able reunification efforts with regard to the barriers
.’’ In summation, the
preventing reunification .
court explained that ‘‘[t]he department initially referred
[the respondent] to individual counseling. After her
relocation to Mississippi ended her therapy with Jenni-
fer Daigle, [a licensed clinical social worker] in Con-
necticut, [the department] continued to encourage the
[respondent] to engage with mental health providers,
and even agreed to pay for counseling. It encouraged
her to seek immigration services for her undocumented
status that was a formidable barrier to obtaining
employment, and it provided and fostered in-person and
virtual visitation with Kylie so that she could maintain
a relationship with the child. But the evidence shows
that Kylie’s own mental health issues necessitate her
parent knowing how to respond to those issues. Very
early in this case, [Kylie’s multidisciplinary evaluation]
identified psychoeducation for the [respondent] as one
way to meet that need. The reports of the [respondent’s]
depression and its interference with her visitations war-
ranted [the department’s] belief in 2019 that she needed
to address her own issues first before beginning psy-
choeducation services. With regard to the [respondent’s]
difficulty finding suitable housing, the department’s
obligation to make reasonable efforts at reunification
does not require it to provide a parent with housing, but
the department should refer the parent to any resources
that could assist the parent in obtaining housing, and
[the department] did that here. When the housing refer-
rals to Chrysalis Center and Liberty Garden Apartments
were unsuccessful because of the [respondent’s] undoc-
umented status, the department encouraged her to seek
housing from a homeless shelter, which the evidence
shows could have offered a possible pathway to housing
and housing subsidies for her.’’

Although the respondent claims that the ‘‘department
only referred [her] to a handful of services, such as in-

person visitation and individual counseling,’’ and, that
‘‘the evidence is insufficient to establish that [the
department] made reasonable efforts to assist [the
respondent] in addressing her immigration status, hous-
ing and employment, or her parenting skills and rela-
tionship with Kylie,’’ the record belies this assertion.
The evidence in this case shows that, whether the
respondent was in Connecticut, Mississippi, or Nevada,
and regardless of her varying degrees of cooperation,
the department made reasonable efforts to reunify the
respondent with Kylie.

To illustrate the extent of the department’s involve-
ment, we recite some of its efforts and the evidence
that supports a finding of those efforts. The evidence
shows that, at some point in early 2018, the respondent
told the department that she had entered the country
on a visitor’s visa that was first issued to her in 2015.
The respondent’s testimony confirmed that she over-
stayed her visa and that she no longer had legal status
in the United States, which made it difficult for her to
receive certain governmental financial assistance, made
her ineligible for certain housing and other programs,
and limited her employment prospects and ability to
support herself and Kylie. Testimony by Monica Gould,
a social work supervisor with the department, confirms
that, while the respondent was in Connecticut, the
department referred her to Community Health Services
for mental health services, where she began therapy
with Daigle, a licensed clinical social worker. She was
diagnosed with depression and prescribed medication,
which she did not take because she found it unhelpful.
Additionally, in order to help reestablish her relation-
ship with Kylie, both documentary and testimonial evi-
dence show that the department commenced super-
vised in-person visitation, which incorporated the
Therapeutic Family Time parent coaching model. Although
the respondent attended many of the visitation sessions,
she also missed many of them for various reasons,
including leaving the state to visit family in Nevada or
going out of touch where the department could not
reach her.

The evidence confirms that,

in March, 2018, the
department referred the respondent to an agency called
the Chrysalis Center for help with her housing, immigra-
tion, and employment issues. Despite the department’s
efforts, it later learned that the respondent was ineligi-
ble for services there because she did not have a Social
Security number. In April, 2018, the department con-
tacted Liberty Gardens Apartments, a state affiliated
housing program, but was informed that the respon-
dent’s undocumented status and lack of Social Security
number precluded her from participating in that pro-
gram as well. Colleen Drummond, a social work supervi-
sor for the department, testified that the respondent
was then provided with information regarding the 2-1-
1 Connecticut information line,6 which could assist the

respondent with housing and employment services in
the community. It was also recommended that she seek
shelter housing, as doing so could have been a route
to more permanent housing and a state funded housing
subsidy despite her undocumented status. The respon-
dent was not willing to stay in a shelter.

There is no question that the respondent’s immigra-
tion status created a barrier to her ability to obtain
housing and employment. Drummond further testified
that, to assist with her immigration status, the depart-
ment provided the respondent with forms to apply for
a tax identification number, which would function like
a Social Security number and assist in employment
and housing. The department followed up with Catholic
Charities regarding a tax identification number and its
ability to assist the respondent with her immigration
issues. The department also remained in contact with
the respondent’s child protection attorney, who was
assisting her in applying for a work visa. Indeed, on
multiple occasions, department social workers con-
nected with the respondent’s attorney about how to
address her immigration issues. They repeatedly encour-
aged the respondent to follow up with her attorney on
her immigration concerns.

Drummond testified that she personally contacted the
department’s director of multicultural affairs, inquiring
about services for the respondent and how the respon-
dent could change her visa to a working visa or obtain
citizenship. The director reported that, if she had over-
stayed her visa, there was not much recourse unless
she returned to her country of origin and applied for a
work visa. He reported that she needed an employer
in the United States to sponsor her.

The department also encouraged the respondent to
participate in a general equivalency diploma program
at the Urban League, which the department believed
might offer her the possibility of obtaining an education
visa. She did enroll in that program in May, 2018, but
dropped out soon afterward, telling the department that
she could not concentrate.

The department’s efforts did not end there. Even after
the respondent moved to Mississippi, where she pro-
vided little information to the department regarding her
circumstances and refused its referrals, the department
continued to reach out by telephone and text messaging
to discuss services. Department social workers urged
the respondent to continue her mental health treatment
while she resided in Mississippi and even told her that
the department would pay for mental health treatment
there. The department encouraged the respondent to
seek immigration services, providing her information
for the immigration office in Mississippi. The depart-
ment also provided and fostered in-person and virtual
visitation with Kylie so that the respondent could main-
tain a relationship with the child.

When the respondent resided in Nevada, the depart-
ment again encouraged her to seek mental health ser-
vices. Although the respondent generally refused ser-
vices, the department encouraged her to communicate
with Kylie’s therapist, who could have provided the
psychoeducation previously recommended to the respon-
dent to assist Kylie with her individualized health needs.
Communications with the respondent, however, were
sporadic until the spring of 2020, at which time the
respondent informed the department in a text message
that she had not spoken to Kylie for a while. The depart-
ment thereafter took over supervised visits between
Kylie and the respondent due to communication issues
between the respondent and Kylie’s foster parents. Sub-
sequently, the department coordinated with the respon-
dent’s shelter in Nevada regarding services, reached
out to Catholic Charities regarding the respondent’s
immigration status, and coordinated with the respon-
dent’s mental health provider.

On appeal, the respondent focuses on a few alleged
shortcomings in the department’s reunification efforts.
Her primary argument is that the department failed to
provide adequate services to assist with her immigra-
tion status. In particular, she argues that the depart-
ment’s own policy manual states that ‘‘the Social Worker
shall assist undocumented adult clients with issues
related to their immigration status. ‘Assist’ means, for
example, to help fill out forms and provide a referral
to an immigration attorney.’’ (Emphasis in original.)
She argues that the department did not make a referral
for her to meet with an immigration attorney, nor did
it help her fill out immigration forms, and for this reason
alone, the department failed to make reasonable efforts
to reunify her with Kylie.

The respondent’s argument is unavailing for a number
of reasons. First, the respondent fails to point to any
authority to support her contention that the department
was required by law to provide her with immigration
counsel or to help her fill out particular paperwork in
order to satisfy the reasonable efforts requirement. See
In re Gabriella A., supra, 154 Conn. App. 186 n.9 (‘‘[t]he
respondent has failed to cite legal authority for the
proposition that the department’s many responsibilities
include providing assistance as to immigration issues’’);
see also In re Oreoluwa O., 321 Conn. 523, 562, 139
A.3d 674 (2016) (Espinosa, J., dissenting) (‘‘I agree with
the Appellate Court, which properly concluded that the
department was not required to provide the respondent
with immigration counsel in order to satisfy the ‘reason-
able efforts requirement’ ’’).7 Second, the department’s
internal policy does not mandate, as the respondent
contends, that the department make a referral to an
immigration attorney or fill out particular immigration
forms in every instance. By its clear language, the policy
provision simply provides examples to department

social workers on possible ways to assist undocu-
mented adult clients. Assistance, of course, will vary
depending on the particular circumstances of a case.
Third, our inquiry is not whether the department fol-
lowed its own internal policy but whether the depart-
ment satisfied its statutory obligation to make reason-
able efforts to reunify the respondent with Kylie under
the particular circumstances of this case.

As previously set forth, the evidence before the trial
court was sufficient to support its factual finding, by
clear and convincing evidence, that the department
made reasonable efforts to reunify the respondent with
Kylie. To the extent the department was even required
to provide immigration assistance to the respondent, it
is clear that its efforts were reasonable. The department
assisted the respondent by, among other things, con-
sulting with her child protection attorney, who was
assisting the respondent with obtaining a work visa. The
department also made various referrals to organizations
that could assist with immigration and housing issues,
and it provided the respondent with forms to apply for
a tax identification number, which would function like
a Social Security number to assist her in obtaining
employment and housing. The fact that some of the
department’s efforts were unfruitful does not necessar-
ily render them unreasonable.

The respondent next argues that the department
‘‘failed to provide services that were designed to provide
assistance with housing or employment.’’ This argu-
ment is also belied by the record. The department made
numerous referrals to services for housing and employ-
ment. Although some of these efforts were unsuccessful
because of the respondent’s immigration status, the
department was persistent in its efforts to assist the
respondent on this front. While trying to help get the
respondent’s immigration situation in order, the respon-
dent was referred to the 2-1-1 information line and a
shelter placement, which could have been the means for
establishing more permanent housing and employment.
Indeed, testimony in the record confirmed that the
undocumented immigration status and lack of a Social
Security number typically would not impact the ability
of a shelter resident or homeless person to access per-
manent supportive housing, which is affordable housing
coupled with support services provided through case
management. The respondent, however, refused the
services because she was not willing to stay in a shel-
ter.8

The respondent also claims that the department did
not even attempt to use special ‘‘WRAP funds’’9 to pay
for her housing. But nothing in the record even indicates
that this type of funding was available to the respondent
for housing. To the contrary, the petitioner introduced
evidence that such funding was not available for the
respondent’s housing. The department’s efforts were

reasonable under the particular circumstances of this
case.

Last, the respondent argues that the department failed
to make reasonable efforts to assist her in repairing
her relationship with Kylie and improving her parenting
skills. She argues that, although the department pro-
vided her with supervised in-person visitation, ‘it failed
to take additional steps recommended by psychiatric
experts,’’ namely, the provision of psychoeducation
around child development. We are not persuaded.

The trial court found that, on February 27, 2018, the
department took Kylie to Community Human Resources,
Inc., for a multidisciplinary evaluation (MDE) to under-
stand and address her various needs. In light of the
MDE, the court found that Kylie’s own mental health
issues necessitated that the respondent know how to
respond to those issues. To that end, Kylie’s MDE made
numerous recommendations involving the respondent,
including, inter alia, that the respondent engage with
Kylie in trauma focused work and engage in her own
individual psychotherapy so that she would be in a
position to meet Kylie’s needs. The court found that
the department deferred providing psychoeducation
services to the respondent because of reports of the
respondent’s depression and its effect on her visitation
with Kylie. It determined that the respondent first
needed to address her own mental health issues before
beginning psychoeducation services. The court found
found that
reasonable and further
this deferral
‘‘[w]hether [the department] would have concluded that
the [respondent’s] progress
in therapy and her
[improvement] warranted the beginning of the psychoe-
ducation recommended by the MDE will never be
known, however, because of the [respondent’s] limited
contact with the department from the fall of 2018 until
the end of 2019.’’ The court additionally found that,
when the department arranged for Kylie’s therapist to
provide psychoeducation to the respondent, the respon-
dent specifically declined further discussions with the
therapist.

In short, the evidence supports the court’s finding
that it was reasonable, under the circumstances, for
the department to defer the provision of these services
in 2018, and further supports the other factual findings
set forth by the court in support of its determination
that the department had made reasonable efforts to
reunify the respondent with Kylie. Accordingly, we find
no merit in the respondent’s claim.10

II

The respondent next claims that the trial court erro-
neously found that the department was not required to
make reasonable efforts pursuant to § 17a-111b (a) (2)
because it already had approved a permanency plan for
the termination of her parental rights. The respondent

claims that § 17a-111b (a) (2) ‘‘is unconstitutional as
applied in this case because it relieves [the petitioner]
of the obligation to prove that it made reasonable efforts
to reunify under § 17a-112 (j) (1) if the trial court has
already approved a permanency plan other than reunifi-
cation by a preponderance of the evidence.’’ The
respondent claims that this court may address her new
argument under State v. Golding, 213 Conn. 233, 239–40,
567 A.2d 823 (1989), as modified by In re Yasiel R., 317
Conn. 773, 781, 120 A.3d 1188 (2015).11

Because we conclude in part I of this opinion that
the court properly found, on the basis of clear and
convincing evidence, that the department did in fact
make reasonable efforts to reunify the respondent and
Kylie, we need not address the respondent’s claim. As
a jurisprudential matter, Connecticut courts ‘‘follow the
recognized policy of self-restraint and the basic judicial
duty to eschew unnecessary determinations of constitu-
tional questions.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.)
In re Brayden E.-H., 309 Conn. 642, 656, 72 A.3d 1083
(2013). Addressing the respondent’s claim would be
contrary to that policy and this court’s basic judicial
duty. We decline to do so.

III

The respondent next claims that the trial court erred
in finding that she failed to rehabilitate because the
evidence is insufficient to support that conclusion. We
disagree.

.

We begin by setting forth the established principles
of law and the standard of review. ‘‘Section 17a-112 (j)
(3) (B) requires the court to find by clear and convincing
. the parent of [the] child has been
evidence that .
provided specific steps to take to facilitate the return
of the child to the parent . . . and has failed to achieve
such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encour-
age the belief that within a reasonable time, considering
the age and needs of the child, such parent could
assume a responsible position in the life of the child
. . . .’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In re Karter
F., 207 Conn. App. 1, 20–21, 262 A.3d 195, cert. denied,
339 Conn. 912, 261 A.3d 745 (2021).

.

.

‘‘Personal rehabilitation as used in [§ 17a-112 (j) (3)
(B)] refers to the restoration of a parent to his or her
former constructive and useful role as a parent.
.
The statute does not require [a parent] to prove pre-
cisely when [she] will be able to assume a responsible
position in [her] child’s life. Nor does it require [her]
to prove that [she] will be able to assume full responsi-
bility for [her] child, unaided by available support sys-
. Rather, [§ 17a-112] requires the trial court
tems.
to analyze the [parent’s] rehabilitative status as it relates
to the needs of the particular child, and further, that
such rehabilitation must be foreseeable within a reason-
able time. . . . [The statute] requires the court to find,

.

.

by clear and convincing evidence, that the level of reha-
bilitation [the parent] has achieved, if any, falls short
of that which would reasonably encourage a belief that
at some future date [she] can assume a responsible
position in [her] child’s life.’’ (Internal quotation marks
omitted.) In re Lillyanne D., 215 Conn. App. 61, 87,
281 A.3d 521, cert. denied, 345 Conn. 913, 283 A.3d
981 (2022).

The court’s determination that a parent has failed
to rehabilitate is subject to the evidentiary sufficiency
standard of review. See In re Shane M., 318 Conn. 569,
588, 122 A.3d 1247 (2015). We look to see ‘‘whether the
trial court could have reasonably concluded, upon the
facts established and the reasonable inferences drawn
therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence
was sufficient to justify its [ultimate conclusion]. . . .
When applying this standard, we construe the evidence
in a manner most favorable to sustaining the judgment
of the trial court.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.)
Id. The court’s subordinate factual
findings are
reviewed for clear error. See id., 587.

We turn now to the court’s findings. As to Kylie’s
particularized needs, the court found that, ‘‘[d]uring
Kylie’s short life, she has lived with her mother, with
her mother’s second cousin and his wife, and in three
foster homes. In two of those homes, she was physically
mistreated. When she was less than eighteen months
old, her mother sent her to live with the cousin and his
wife, and she was physically abused in that home. After
Kylie was placed into [the department’s] care, she
quickly bonded with her first foster family and within
weeks was calling them ‘mommy and daddy.’ But they
did not protect her from other foster children, who
caused more injuries—[though] much less severe—to
Kylie. Then, after approximately six months with the
first foster family, she was placed with the family she
calls ‘Gigi’ and ‘Papa,’ and afterward, in March, 2021,
with their grown daughter, whom Kylie calls ‘Auntie
Neesha.’

‘‘[The department’s] earliest visits to the first foster
home found her happy and comfortable there, but there
were already signs that she had been affected by the
turmoil of her early life. A status report submitted by
the department after two months stated that ‘Kylie has
displayed behaviors which include screaming and hit-
ting. Kylie demonstrates anxiety around new people.
She will scream, cry, and pull away from new individu-
als.’
. The neglect social study filed shortly after-
ward similarly said that ‘Kylie presents as clingy and
frightened with a serious demeanor. Kylie becomes
extremely anxious when introduced to new people.
Kylie is also frightened of cords and cries and screams
at night, when it is bedtime.’ . . .

.

.

‘‘After she was placed with Gigi and Papa, Kylie ini-
tially appeared to thrive, and a social work supervisor

wrote in the running narrative in October, 2018, that
the foster parents, [the respondent], and the department
all had no concerns about her behaviors. . . . Early in
the following year, however, she began having problems
in her foster home and at the daycare, and there were
more comments about her ‘flat affect.’ The foster par-
ents took Kylie in March, 2019, to licensed professional
counselor Laurie Landry, who worked with her and her
foster family.
. Landry testified that, in 2019, she
helped address Kylie’s issues by providing psychoedu-
cation to the foster parent, and with that help the prob-
lems soon subsided. But the evidence shows that, after
that, Kylie periodically again exhibited behavioral prob-
lems. By early 2021, the foster family had taken her
back to Landry, who has been seeing Kylie and one of
the foster family adults weekly ever since.

.

.

‘‘Landry’s testimony at trial was helpful, credible, and
persuasive in explaining Kylie’s behavior[s] and their
likely origins. She explained many of Kylie’s symptoms
in terms of the child’s sense of safety. She said that she
was not able to identify the specific source of Kylie’s
behaviors but that they were sometimes typical symp-
toms of past trauma. She also testified that the various
disruptions in where Kylie was living would be trau-
matic to any child; ‘when kids are removed and placed
in different places that’s a traumatic event’ and that ‘a
break in attachment from a caregiver is a trauma.’ . . .
Landry has diagnosed Kylie as having anxiety, based
on her symptoms, and reactive attachment disorder,
based primarily on Kylie’s ‘history of broken attach-
ments.’ . . .

‘‘Landry described her therapy with Kylie now as
primarily ‘symptom management.’ Kylie’s behaviors
have improved since she resumed therapy, but Landry
testified credibly that providing permanency to Kylie is
the only way for her trauma to begin to be healed. She
also testified that, despite the improvements, ‘there’s a
lot of work that still needs to be done with Kylie.’ ’’
(Citations omitted; footnote omitted.) The court found
that, ‘‘[b]ecause of her recurring behavioral problems
that are symptoms of underlying anxiety and other men-
tal health problems, [Kylie] needs continuing therapy
to help her heal from the traumas she has experienced,
as well as a parent or caregiver who will understand
that these issues require professional help and who will
work closely and collaboratively with those profession-
als.’’

The court went on to find that, ‘‘[a]s of the adjudica-
tory date, clear and convincing evidence offered at trial
established that [the respondent] was not ready then
or within a reasonable time thereafter to assume a
responsible position in Kylie’s life, in view of that child’s
age and needs. As of the date that the petition was
amended and a new adjudicatory date created .
.
[the respondent] remained without her own place to

.

live, income, or means to support or house her daughter,
and she still had her own mental health issues affecting
her well-being. She had left the Mississippi home where
she had lived with her infant son’s father but had not
yet told [the department] about that departure. [The
respondent] explained at trial that she then lived tempo-
rarily with relatives in Massachusetts but that she did
not attempt to reunify with Kylie at that time because
‘Massachusetts is not a place where .
. immigrants
. Sometime between November and
can get job.’
February, she then relocated to Nevada, where she
stayed for a few months with a friend, where she had
to share a bed with her infant son and the friend. At
that point, reunification was not feasible and she was
not ready to assume a responsible position then in
Kylie’s life or in the reasonable future.’’ (Citation omit-
ted.)

.

.

.

The court, however, did find that a substantial change
had occurred in many aspects of the respondent’s situa-
tion between the adjudicatory date and the time of trial.
It therefore exercised its discretion and considered
developments after the adjudicatory date. It stated: ‘‘As
of the time of trial, ending in August, 2021, the [respon-
dent] had successfully attended and been discharged
from mental health counseling, attended many hours
of parenting education, found suitable housing, and
obtained employment with which she can support her-
self and both children. Her immigration status has not
changed but also has not prevented her from finding a
job in Nevada and does not present itself as a child
protection issue. This drastic turnaround in the [respon-
dent’s] situation resulted primarily from her willingness
to do what [the department] had encouraged her but
she had previously been [unwilling] to do: entering a
shelter that could provide a segue to housing, employ-
ment and other services.’’

Although the court found that there was ‘‘no reason
to believe that [the respondent] cannot today meet all
the basic material needs of a six year old child or Kylie’s
need to have a safe and stable home,’’ it found that
‘‘Kylie has special and individualized needs’’ beginning
‘‘with helping her recover from the traumas and abuse
that she has endured.’’ The court found that Kylie needs
‘‘a parent or caregiver who will understand that [her]
behaviors, anxiety, and traumas are sufficiently severe’’
to require professional help but that the respondent’s
‘‘actions do not show any genuine recognition of Kylie’s
needs or, just as importantly, any willingness to work
with a therapist treating Kylie.’’ The court stated that
‘‘[t]he statutory standard for rehabilitation is that the
parent is ready to assume a responsible position in the
life of a particular child, or will be in a reasonable time,
both assessed in terms of the age and needs of the
particular child. All the evidence overwhelmingly dem-
onstrates, however, that the present is not such a time;
nor is there a reasonable time in the future when that

is foreseeable.’’

A

Turning to the respondent’s claim, she argues that
evidence in this case demonstrates that she has rehabili-
tated. In support of her argument, she identifies certain
favorable findings made by the court about her prog-
ress. For example, she identifies the court’s finding that,
‘‘as of the time of trial, the [respondent] had successfully
attended and been discharged from mental health coun-
seling, attended many hours of parenting education,
found suitable housing and obtained employment with
which she can support herself and her children. Her
immigration status has not changed but also has not
prevented her from finding a job in Nevada and does
not present itself as a child protection issue.’’ The
respondent also relies on the finding that she had
‘‘addressed successfully the housing, employment, and
her own mental health issues that were legitimate con-
cerns in 2018 regarding her ability to care for Kylie.’’

But what the respondent fails to recognize is that
‘‘[o]ur focus in conducting a review for evidentiary suffi-
ciency is not on the question of whether there exists
support for a different finding—the proper inquiry is
whether there is enough evidence in the record to sup-
port the finding that the trial court made.’’ (Emphasis
omitted.) In re Jayce O., 323 Conn. 690, 716, 150 A.3d
640 (2016). The respondent’s arguments ignore the great
deal of evidence in the record that supports the court’s
finding that she had failed to rehabilitate to a level
required under the statute, including, inter alia, testi-
mony from Landry, Kylie’s therapist, about the respon-
dent’s limited involvement and participation in Kylie’s
treatment. The respondent is essentially inviting this
court to reweigh the evidence that was presented to
the trial court so that we might reach a conclusion that
differs from the one reached by the trial court. We
decline her invitation. See Pennymac Corp. v. Tarzia,
215 Conn. App. 190, 206, 281 A.3d 469 (2022) (declining
to reweigh evidence on appeal).

In advancing her argument, the respondent also takes
issue with a few of the trial court’s subordinate factual
findings, including the finding that Kylie has specialized
and individualized needs, such as recovering from
trauma and abuse; that Kylie’s attachment with the
respondent was an issue; and that the respondent does
not show recognition of Kylie’s needs. Her argument,
however, simply highlights favorable evidence in chal-
lenging each finding while disregarding the unfavorable
evidence. Our review confirms that there is evidence in
the record to support the court’s subordinate findings,
and we are not left with a definite and firm conviction
that a mistake has been committed. Landry’s testimony,
among other evidence, elucidated Kylie’s particularized
and individualized needs, including the respondent’s
shortcomings in addressing Kylie’s attachment issues.12

These findings were also supported by the testimony
of department staff who described in detail various
visits between the respondent and Kylie and how there
seemed to be a disconnect, as the respondent would
become preoccupied with other distractions that pre-
vented her from recognizing Kylie’s interests and needs.

Construing the evidence in the manner most favor-
able to sustaining the court’s judgment, as we must, we
conclude that the evidence was sufficient to justify the
court’s ultimate conclusion that the respondent failed
to reach the requisite degree of rehabilitation to assume
a responsible position in Kylie’s life.

B

This brings us to the respondent’s related claim. She
contends that the court was precluded from finding
that she failed to rehabilitate because ‘‘[the department]
threatened to remove [her] youngest child from her
custody if she ever returned to Connecticut, and thus
effectively prevented her from returning to Connecticut
for in-person visits with Kylie.’’ She argues that the
department’s conduct amounted to improper interfer-
ence with her ability to maintain a relationship with
Kylie and that this court should apply the interference
exception that applies in cases in which the alleged
statutory ground for termination is the lack of an ongo-
ing parent-child relationship even though in this case
the court terminated her parental rights in this case
because she failed to rehabilitate. For the reasons that
follow, the respondent’s claim fails.

In recent years, our Supreme Court has clarified the
proper legal test to apply when a petitioner seeks to
terminate a parent’s rights on the basis of no ongoing
parent-child relationship. See In re Tresin J., 334 Conn.
314, 323, 222 A.3d 83 (2019); In re Jacob W., 330 Conn.
744, 764, 200 A.3d 1091 (2019). In order to terminate
parental rights on that basis, a petitioner must first
‘‘prove the lack of an ongoing parent-child relationship
by clear and convincing evidence. In other words, the
petitioner must prove by clear and convincing evidence
that the child has no present memories or feelings for
the natural parent that are positive in nature. If the
petitioner is unable to prove a lack of an ongoing parent-
child relationship by clear and convincing evidence, the
petition must be denied and there is no need to proceed
to the second step of the inquiry. If, and only if, the
petitioner has proven a lack of an ongoing parent-child
relationship, does the inquiry proceed to the second
step, whereby the petitioner must prove by clear and
convincing evidence that to allow further time for the
establishment or reestablishment of the relationship
would be contrary to the best interests of the child.
Only then may the court proceed to the disposition
phase.’’ In re Jacob W., supra, 762–63.

The court also has clarified the test’s two attendant

exceptions. The first exception, which is not at issue
in the present case, applies when the child in question
is an infant. Id., 763. Instead of looking to the present
feelings and memories of the infant child, whose pres-
ent feelings can hardly be discerned with any reason-
able degree of confidence, courts are instead required
at the first step to focus on whether the parent has
positive feelings toward the child. Id.

The second exception, which is relevant to the
respondent’s claim in this case, ‘‘applies when the peti-
tioner has engaged in conduct that inevitably has led
to the lack of an ongoing parent-child relationship
between the respondent parent and the child.’’ Id. In
such instances, the ‘‘exception precludes the petitioner
from relying on the lack of an ongoing parent-child
relationship as a basis for termination.’’ Id.

The applicability of the so-called interference excep-
tion under the facts of this case presents a question
of law over which we exercise plenary review. In re
November H., 202 Conn. App. 106, 132, 243 A.3d 839
(2020).

The respondent does not point to a single Connecticut
case that has held that the interference exception
applies to a case where the statutory ground for termi-
nation is failure to rehabilitate. Nor has she articulated
why the rationale for the so-called interference excep-
tion, which is aimed at preventing a petitioning party
from terminating a parent’s rights on the basis of no
ongoing relationship when the petitioning party
engaged in conduct that caused the lack of relationship,
should apply in failure to rehabilitate cases, where the
focus is on whether the parent is in a position to respon-
sibly care for the child within a reasonable time consid-
ering the age and needs of the child. It is unnecessary
to resolve this question today, however, because, even
assuming arguendo that the interference exception
applies, as a matter of law, to the failure to rehabilitate
ground for termination, we conclude that the exception
is otherwise inapplicable under the facts of this case.
See id. (even if interference exception applied to failure
to rehabilitate ground, exception was inapplicable to
facts of case).

In support of her argument that the department
‘‘threatened’’ to remove her newborn child if she returned
to Connecticut and, thus, interfered with her ability to
rehabilitate with Kylie, the respondent points to testi-
mony from several witnesses at trial. The first exchange
she identifies is between the respondent’s counsel and
Heather Czerwinski, a social worker with the depart-
ment, about a telephone call that the respondent had
with Czerwinski while the respondent was living in
Mississippi:

‘‘Q. I think [the respondent] expressed to you—and
I think you testified to this on direct examination—that

[the respondent] was—she expressed to you that she
was afraid to come to Connecticut because she thought
the department might remove her son from her care.
Do you remember that?

‘‘A. Yes, I do remember that.

‘‘Q. And you let her know that that was a realistic

probability, correct?

‘‘A. I—I did say that—that there—that there was a

realistic probability, yes.’’

The next

identified exchange was between the

respondent’s counsel and Landry:

‘‘Q. [A]re you aware that, in November of 2019, [the
respondent] expressed that she was afraid to come back
to Connecticut as she was afraid the department would
remove her son and that Miss Czerwinski, the current
social worker on the case, told her that this was a
realistic concern and that she was probably right? Were
you aware of that?

‘‘A. No.

‘‘Q. Sorry?

‘‘A. No.

‘‘Q. Okay. And would that have possibly given [the
respondent] pause, in your estimation as a family thera-
pist and a counselor and a mental health clinician, in
wanting to return to the state to see her daughter
because of the fear of potentially losing another child
to the—to the department . . . system?

* * *

‘‘A. So, can you ask the question again?

‘‘Q. Sure. I said it is it reasonable—

‘‘A. Okay.

‘‘Q. Sure. After [the respondent] learned that informa-
tion, would that have, perhaps, provided plausible
explanation as to [the respondent’s] hesitancy or reluc-
tance or mistrust in to return to Connecticut to bring
her son and to see Kylie in person?

‘‘A. So, would I think it’s reasonable that fear would

be a barrier to her visiting?

‘‘Q. Yes.

‘‘A. Yeah.’’

The respondent also highlighted an exchange
between the respondent’s counsel and Gould, a social
work supervisor with the department:

‘‘Q. [Y]ou knew [the respondent] was concerned

about immigration authorities, right?

‘‘A. Yes.

‘‘Q. You knew that you—actually, your team called

Mississippi [Child Protective Services] and sent them
to [the respondent’s] doorstep, yes?

‘‘Q. Your team contacted Nevada [Child Protective
Services] and had them contact the [respondent], yes?

‘‘Q. Your team told [the respondent] that it was a
realistic possibility that the department would remove
Davonte from her care should she return to Connecti-
cut, yes?

‘‘A. Yes.

‘‘A. Yes.

‘‘A. Yes.

‘‘Q. So it’s reasonable for [the respondent] to have
a—some caution in dealing with the department in rela-
tion to fearing for the consequences of deportation or
removal of her child, correct?

‘‘A. Yes, cautious—‘‘

The respondent’s claim that the department inter-
fered with her ability to rehabilitate is misplaced. As
an initial matter, we must address the respondent’s
allegation that the department ‘‘threatened’’ to take her
newborn child away if she were to return to Connecti-
cut. The evidence shows that Czerwinski’s statements
were not threats; they were simply honest responses
to the respondent’s queries. Indeed, the trial court found
that Czerwinski’s responses to the respondent’s ques-
tions about her potential return to Connecticut were
‘‘probably . . . truthful and pragmatic,’’ as the informa-
tion known to the department at the time suggested
legitimate child protection issues. In fact, when Czer-
‘‘[the respondent] was
winski made this statement,
unemployed, relying for housing and other necessities
on an unidentified father of her newborn, refusing to
participate in mental health services but had been teary
to the point of being inaudible in a recent conversa-
tion . . . .’’

More importantly, the focus of the interference
exception is not the intent of the conduct at issue but
whether ‘‘the actions of the petitioner rendered inevita-
ble the initial lack of a relationship.’’ (Emphasis in
original; internal quotation marks omitted.) In re Tresin
J., supra, 334 Conn. 332 n.12. Although the court did
not make a finding that there was no ongoing parent-
child relationship because, as explained, this is a failure
to rehabilitate case, it did find that one of the numerous
reasons that the respondent failed to rehabilitate was
because the virtual contact the respondent had with
Kylie was insufficient to address Kylie’s attachment
issues. The respondent’s lack of in-person visits (and
her inability to meet Kylie’s particularized needs), how-
ever, were exhibited well before Czerwinski’s statement
to the respondent. It is undisputed that the department
became involved in early 2018, after Kylie was left in
the care of her relatives, at which time the respondent

had limited contact with Kylie. Additionally, after
returning to Connecticut, it was the respondent who
made the decision to move to Mississippi, effectively
terminating the regular in-person visits that she had
with Kylie.

But even if the respondent’s limited in-person visits
and contact with Kylie did not exist prior to Czer-
winski’s statements, we still would not conclude that
the department’s statements rendered inevitable the
respondent’s inability to maintain sufficient interac-
tions with Kylie in order to meet her needs. Although
it is understandable that the respondent, who had one
child removed by the department, was cautious in her
interactions with the department and may have feared
that the same could happen to Davonte, the department
did not prevent
from eventually
the respondent
returning to Connecticut, satisfying the specific steps
identified for her, and availing herself of the services
recommended by the department. Of particular signifi-
cance, the record shows that in or around January,
2020, a social worker with the department connected
with the respondent by telephone, indicating that the
department had spoken with the Mississippi child pro-
tection agency, which determined Davonte was safe in
her care, and that the department would not attempt
to remove Davonte if she returned to Connecticut. Thus,
as of January, 2020, less than two months after the
conversation the respondent claims constituted inter-
ference, the department had made clear to her that she
was free to return to Connecticut and resume regular
in-person visitation with Kylie.

Accordingly, even assuming arguendo that the inter-
ference exception is applicable in failure to rehabilitate
cases, it has no application under the particular facts
of this case for the reasons explicated. See id.13

IV

The respondent’s last claim targets the court’s deci-
sion to ask Kylie’s attorney to call a witness after the
petitioner and the respondent had rested their cases.
She contends that the court’s conduct violated her
‘‘right to a fair trial by an impartial tribunal
. as
guaranteed by the due process clause to the United
States constitution.’’ The defendant requests review of
her unpreserved claim pursuant to State v. Golding,
supra, 213 Conn. 239–40. See footnote 11 of this opinion.
We conclude that, although the record is adequate to
review the claim presented and the claim is of constitu-
tional magnitude, the respondent cannot prevail under
the third prong of Golding because she affirmatively
waived this claim.

.

.

We begin by setting forth additional facts and proce-
dural history relevant to the respondent’s claim. At the
termination of parental rights trial, the respondent testi-
fied that, when she was in Connecticut, she went to

Mercy House shelter for housing, but stated that Mercy
House required a letter from the department in order
for her to obtain housing there. She testified that the
department did not provide her with such a letter,
despite several requests.

The department offered rebuttal evidence to the con-
trary. It recalled social worker Czerwinski, who testified
that, based on her experience with Mercy House, she
has never been required to provide a letter in order for
a client to obtain housing. The respondent’s counsel
objected numerous times throughout the testimony,
stating that Czerwinski lacked the qualifications and
personal knowledge to testify regarding Mercy House’s
‘‘Unless
policies. The respondent’s counsel stated:
Mercy [House] is here as a witness declaring what their
qualifications are or not that would be the party appro-
priate to put on rebuttal evidence.’’ He subsequently
stated that ‘‘[r]ebuttal would have to come from Mercy
House themselves, not from this witness,’’ and that ‘‘[i]t
would have to be the same time period, back in 2018.’’

After testimony concluded regarding Mercy House,
the court addressed the parties, indicating that it was
‘‘bothered by the lack of detail about Mercy [House],’’
and that it would ‘‘like to ask counsel for the minor child
to investigate this issue and to either offer testimony
or if the parties could offer stipulation about whether
anyone presently has knowledge .
. at Mercy—
Mercy [House] currently has knowledge about what
their policies on this question would have been back
in the relevant time period.’’ The court then stated that
it was looking for a witness who can say what the policy
was at that time or, if no one knows, a stipulation that
no one can provide such information.

.

The respondent’s attorney then began to speak. The
court, however, interrupted counsel to inform him that
the court would withdraw the request if the respon-
dent’s counsel wanted it to. In particular, the court
stated: ‘‘So I just said to [the respondent’s attorney], if
he doesn’t want me to make this—direct this to the
counsel for the child, I’ll withdraw that request.’’ The
respondent’s attorney then stated that it was ‘‘fine . . .
for the minor child’s counsel
to undertake that
endeavor’’ but requested ‘‘that . . . the contact be simi-
lar to the status—the respondent’s status at the time,
which is not having a Social Security number and being
undocumented and not having health insurance.’’

After a brief colloquy between the parties and the
court, the court requested Kylie’s attorney to ask for
the time frame of when the previous social worker was
on the case; whether there were any circumstances at
that time where Mercy House would ask an applicant
for housing for documentation from the department
that there was an active case; and ask what Mercy
House would tell an individual who did not have legal
immigration status, was undocumented, and did not

have a Social Security number.

The assistant attorney general, on behalf of the peti-
tioner, objected to the court’s inquiry on the basis of
facts not in evidence. The court nevertheless proceeded
with its request to have Kylie’s attorney obtain informa-
tion from Mercy House. The respondent’s counsel then
asked the court to include some additional questions,
including asking whether anyone can come into the
shelter or whether an identification or a birth certificate
is required. The court indicated that, if such a person
exists at Mercy House, then the respondent’s counsel
would have plenty of chances to ask those questions
of the witness. The court explained to the respondent’s
counsel: ‘‘I’m not gonna make your case for you. I’m
just concerned about my obligation to review the rea-
sonableness of [the department’s] reunification efforts.
And this is a piece of information that came up late
and I want it . . . tracked down.’’

In compliance with the court’s request, Kylie’s attor-
ney called Kara Capone, chief executive officer of Com-
munity Housing Advocates, an organization that over-
sees Mercy House. Capone testified, among other
things, that there was no method for the department
to refer someone to Mercy House and no requirement
that the department provide a letter. She also testified
that the lack of a Social Security number would not
impact an individual’s ability to access supportive hous-
ing. A person’s immigration status may impact the avail-
ability of certain subsidies, but if someone is undocu-
mented, the shelter may use state provided subsidies.

During cross-examination by the respondent’s coun-
sel, the petitioner’s attorney objected several times on
the basis that the questioning by the respondent’s coun-
sel went beyond the scope of the direct examination.
After those objections were sustained, the respondent’s
counsel then stated that he would call the witness as
his own. He then called Capone on direct examination
and questioned her about supportive housing and family
reunification vouchers.

On appeal, the respondent argues that her right to a
fair trial was violated because the trial court crossed
the line between impartiality and advocacy when it
directed Kylie’s counsel to call an additional witness
in order to obtain additional testimony on a material
element of the department’s petition to terminate her
parental rights. The petitioner, on the other hand,
argues that the respondent expressly waived her consti-
tutional claim. She argues that, ‘‘[u]nlike the depart-
ment, which did object, [the respondent’s] counsel
failed to object when the trial court made the request’’
and actually approved of the court’s conduct by aligning
with the court and participating in the substance of the
court’s request. We agree with the petitioner.

‘‘[A] constitutional claim that has been waived does

.

not satisfy the third prong of the Golding test because,
in such circumstances, we simply cannot conclude that
injustice [has been] done to either party . . . .’’ (Cita-
tions omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) State
v. Grasso, 189 Conn. App. 186, 226, 207 A.3d 33, cert.
denied, 331 Conn. 928, 207 A.3d 519 (2019). ‘‘[W]aiver
is an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a
known right or privilege.
. It involves the idea of
.
assent, and assent is an act of understanding. . . . The
rule is applicable that no one shall be permitted to deny
that he intended the natural consequences of his acts
and conduct.
. In order to waive a claim of law
. . . [i]t is enough if he knows of the existence of the
claim and of its reasonably possible efficacy. . . . Con-
necticut courts have consistently held that when a party
fails to raise in the trial court the constitutional claim
presented on appeal and affirmatively acquiesces to the
trial court’s order, that party waives any such claim
[under Golding].’’ (Citation omitted; internal quotation

279 (2012).

In the present case, the respondent never objected
when the court indicated that it wanted Kylie’s attorney
to investigate to see if there was a person at Mercy
House who could testify about its policies and whether
a letter was required from the department in order
for the respondent to receive housing services. In fact,
when the court indicated that it would withdraw its
request if the respondent wished, the respondent’s
attorney made a strategic decision at that time to
decline the court’s invitation to withdraw its request
and actively participated in setting the parameters for
the inquiry. Nor did the respondent’s counsel object
when Kylie’s attorney called Capone from Mercy House
to testify.
Instead, he thoroughly cross-examined
Capone and made a strategic decision to call Capone
as the respondent’s own witness.

On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude
that the respondent, through counsel, engaged in con-
duct clearly demonstrating her agreement and assent
to the court’s conduct, thereby waiving her due process
claim. See State v. Fabricatore, 281 Conn. 469, 481–82,
915 A.2d 872 (2007) (defendant waived claim that trial
court improperly included duty to retreat exception by
failing to object to state’s original request to charge,
failing to object to instruction as given, expressing satis-
faction with instruction, failing to object at trial when
state referred to duty to retreat in closing argument, and
referring to duty to retreat in his own closing argument).
Accordingly, the respondent cannot satisfy the third
prong of Golding.

The judgment is affirmed.

In this opinion the other judges concurred.
* In accordance with the spirit and intent of General Statutes § 46b-142
(b) and Practice Book § 79a-12, the names of the parties involved in this
appeal are not disclosed. The records and papers of this case shall be open
for inspection only to persons having a proper interest therein and upon
order of the court.

** March 6, 2023, the date that this decision was released as a slip opinion,

is the operative date for all substantive and procedural purposes.

1 The operative termination of parental rights petition also named as
respondents putative father Orlando F. and putative father John Doe. The
court terminated the parental rights of both putative fathers. Because neither
putative father is involved in this appeal, any references in this opinion to
the respondent are to the respondent mother only.

We also note that counsel for the minor child filed a statement adopting
the brief of the petitioner in this appeal pursuant to Practice Book §§ 67-
13 and 79a-6 (c).

2 The respondent has three older children, who are currently in the care

of their fathers or paternal relatives in Jamaica.

3 The court found that it was not entirely clear how much contact the
respondent had with Kylie between the time Kylie returned to the United
States and the order of temporary custody. Although the respondent told
the department in 2018 that she had gone straight from Jamaica to Nevada,
the respondent testified that, before going to Nevada, she first spent a few
weeks in Connecticut and that, after moving to Nevada, her cousin Lennox
let her have weekly video chats with Kylie. Kylie, who was quite young
during this time, did not recognize the respondent early in 2018 after going
into the petitioner’s custody.

4 The court found that, while the respondent was living in Connecticut,
‘‘[the department] had encouraged her to seek housing at a shelter, which
[the department] told her could provide possible access to employment
assistance and more permanent housing—and testimony from Kara Capone,
the chief executive officer of Mercy Housing Advocates, an umbrella organi-
zation for two shelters in the Hartford area—later confirmed that residing
in a Connecticut shelter can [be] a gateway here to housing, even for undocu-
mented residents; but [the respondent] at the time had declined, saying that
she would not be able to comply with shelter rules.’’

5 For purposes of judicial economy, we address the respondent’s claims

in a different order from that in her principal appellate brief.

6 2-1-1 is a free, confidential information and referral service that connects

people to essential health and human services.

7 The majority opinion in In re Oreoluwa O., supra, 321 Conn. 523, did
not address the question of whether the department was required to provide
the respondent with immigration counsel in order to satisfy its statutory
obligation.

8 We note that, although the respondent faults the department for encour-
aging her to obtain shelter placement while she was in Connecticut, shelter
housing is precisely what led to her obtaining stable housing, immigration
assistance, and mental health services after she moved to Nevada. The
record reveals that, in mid-2020, after moving to Nevada, the respondent
moved into a shelter with Davonte. The respondent worked closely with a

case manager while at the shelter, who ultimately helped her find day care
for her son and stable housing and also made referrals for parenting classes,
immigration assistance, and mental health treatment. This further supports
the conclusion that the respondent’s efforts were reasonable.

9 The respondent introduced evidence of the department’s ‘‘Immigration
Practice Guide,’’ which provided, among other things, ‘‘Specific Information
Regarding Use of DCF’s Wraparound Funds.’’ The guide provides: ‘‘Given
that clients who are undocumented immigrants do not qualify for most
public services, they may be eligible, on a case-by-case basis, for services
financed by DCF’s WRAP funding. Please know that, at this time, the purpose
for which WRAP funding are used are left to the discretion of each Area
Office. Therefore, please consult with your supervisor about appropriate
use and availability of funding.’’

10 The respondent also claims that the court improperly determined that
she was unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification efforts under § 17a-
112 (j) (1). Because we have concluded that the court properly found,
on the basis of clear and convincing evidence, that the department made
reasonable efforts to reunify the respondent and Kylie, we need not reach
the respondent’s claim regarding the court’s finding that she was unable or
unwilling to benefit from reunification efforts. See In re Ryder M., supra,
211 Conn. App. 808 n.7.

11 The Golding doctrine provides that ‘‘a defendant can prevail on a claim
of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following
conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim
of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation
of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation .
. exists
and . . . deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless
error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged
constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any
one of these conditions, the defendant’s claim will fail. The appellate tribunal
is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant’s claim by focusing on which-
ever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.’’ (Emphasis
in original; footnote omitted.) State v. Golding, supra, 213 Conn. 239–40, as
modified by In re Yasiel R., supra, 317 Conn. 781.

.

12 For example, the following colloquy took place between the assistant

attorney general and Landry:

‘‘[Assistant Attorney General]: And you know that Kylie maintains video
contact with her mother. As it relates to the issues of attachment, is video
contact with her mother sufficient as it relates to issues of attachment
for Kylie?

‘‘[Landry]: I don’t think so, no.
‘‘[Assistant Attorney General]: Okay.
‘‘[Landry]: I think it certainly maybe quells Kylie’s fears about her mom,
making sure that her mom is okay and still out there—you know, and—
and still engaged in her—her life in—in that way. But in terms of a—a—
securing a firm, secure attachment, I—it’s really difficult to do any relation-
ship, really, by video. No.’’

13 We also note that truthful answers provided by the department in
response to a respondent’s queries are not the type of ‘‘interference’’ that
we historically have found improper. See, e.g., In re Carla C., 167 Conn.
App. 248, 250, 255, 143 A.3d 677 (2016) (interference exception was applica-
ble when petitioner mother, who was custodial parent, obtained order from
prison in which respondent father was incarcerated barring him from all
oral or written communication with her and child, discarded cards and
letters that he sent to child, and filed motion to suspend child’s visitation
with father on ground that it was ‘‘unworkable’’).

14 ‘‘The fundamental rights that a defendant personally must waive typically
are identified as the rights to plead guilty, waive a jury, testify on his or
her own behalf, and take an appeal.’’ State v. Gore, 288 Conn. 770, 779 n.9,
955 A.2d 1 (2008).
