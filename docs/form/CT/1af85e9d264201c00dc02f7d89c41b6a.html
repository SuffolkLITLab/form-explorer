“If a party fails to comply with an order of a judicial authority or a citation to 
appear or fails without proper excuse to appear in person or by counsel for 
trial, the party may be nonsuited or defaulted by the judicial authority.” Conn. 
Practice Book § 17-19 (2022). 
 
“. . . there is a clear distinction between a default . . . and a judgment upon 
default. A default is not a judgment. It is an order of the court the effect of 
which is to preclude the defendant from making any further defense in the 
case so far as liability is concerned. A judgment upon default, on the other 
hand, is the final judgment in the case which is entered after the default and 
after a hearing in damages.” Automotive Twins, Inc. v. Klein, 138 Conn. 28, 
33, 82 A.2d 146, 149 (1951). 
 
“A default ‘admits the material facts that constitute a cause of action’; 
Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Rubin, 209 Conn. 437, 445, 551 A.2d 1220 
(1988); and ‘entry of default, when appropriately made, conclusively 
determines the liability of a defendant.’ Ratner v. Willametz, 9 Conn. App. 
565, 579, 520 A.2d 621 (1987). Despite the entries of default, had the 
defendants sought to challenge the right of the plaintiffs to maintain their 
action, or had they intended to prove any matter of defense, they would have 
been permitted to do so at the hearing in damages upon written notice to the 
plaintiffs. See Practice Book § 367 [now 17-34]. Moreover, pursuant to 
Practice Book § 374 [now 17-40], the defendants would have been permitted 
to appear and offer evidence to reduce the amount of damages claimed 
without giving any notice.” LaRosa v. Kline, 36 Conn. App. 501, 503-504, 651 
A.2d 1324, 1326 (1995).

be entered for failure to appear.” Conn. Practice Book §

“The motion shall be granted by the clerk if the party who 
is the subject of the motion has not filed an appearance.” 
Conn. Practice Book § 17-20(d) (2022). 

“If the defaulted party files an appearance in the action 
prior to the entry of judgment after default, the default 
shall automatically be set aside by operation of law.”

complaint also named other defendants, including Wells 
Fargo, and alleged that these defendants may claim an 
interest in the property.” (p. 7) 

We also reject the determination underlying the court’s 
finding of diligence that Wells Fargo was entitled to notice 
of the supplemental judgment proceedings despite its 
default for failure to appear ‘in the first part of the 
foreclosure action.’ Our rules of practice do not require 
service of motions on nonappearing, defaulted parties.” 
(p. 16) 
 

•  Appleton v. J&M Plumbing & Constr., LLC, Superior Court, 
Judicial District of New London at New London, No. CV18-
6037552 (September 3, 2019) (2019 WL 4739123) “On 
December 7, 2018, the defendants Michael Watkinson and 
Sean P. Tatro were defaulted for failure to appear. On 
December 17, 2018, the defendant J&M was defaulted for 
failure to appear. A hearing in damages was held on 
August 6, 2019. None of the defendants appeared for, or 
participated in, the hearing. For the following reasons, the 
court finds this matter in favor of the plaintiff, and awards 
fair, just and reasonable damages.” 
 

•  Little v. Mackeyboy Auto, LLC, 142 Conn. App. 14, 20, 62 
A.3d 1164 (2013). “. . . the defendant never claimed that 
it had not received notice of the plaintiff’s action. As 
reflected in the record, the plaintiff’s counsel certified that 
copies of the motion for default for failure to appear . . . 
were mailed to the defendant at its business address in 
New Haven. The court noted . . . that the defendant never 
claimed that it had not received those copies. The court, 
then, reasonably could have determined that the 
defendant had legal and actual notice of the plaintiff’s 
action.” 
 

•  Abbott Terrace Health Center, Inc. v. Parawich, 120 Conn. 
App. 78, 85-86, 990 A.2d 1267, 1272 (2010). “In the 
present case, the defendant was defaulted pursuant to 
Practice Book § 17-20 due to his failure to enter an 
appearance. As we recently observed, ‘[c]ase law makes 
clear . . . that once the defendants had been defaulted 
and had failed to file a notice of intent to present 
defenses, they, by operation of law, were deemed to have 
admitted to all the essential elements in the claim and 
would not be allowed to contest liability at the hearing in 
damages.’ Richey v. Main Street Stafford, LLC, 110 Conn. 
App. 209, 218, 954 A.2d 889 (2008); see also 1 E. 
Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure (3d Ed. 1997) § 
96, p. 282 (‘[t]he entry of a default constitutes a technical 
admission by the defendant of the truth of the facts 
alleged in the complaint’). ‘A default admits the material 
facts that constitute a cause of action . . . and entry of 
default, when appropriately made, conclusively

determines the liability of a defendant.’ (Emphasis added; 
internal quotation marks omitted.) Schwartz v. Milazzo, 
84 Conn. App. 175, 178, 852 A.2d 847, cert. denied, 271 
Conn. 942, 861 A.2d 515 (2004). Accordingly, ‘the entry 
of default against the defendant commands the rendering 
of judgment in favor of the plaintiff.’ Peterson v. 
Woldeyohannes, 111 Conn. App. 784, 791, 961 A.2d 475 
(2008). Following the entry of a default, all that remains 
is for the plaintiff to prove the amount of damages to 
which it is entitled. DeBlasio v. Aetna Life & Casualty Co., 
supra, 186 Conn. 401. At a minimum, the plaintiff in such 
instances is entitled to nominal damages. See id.; 
Cardona v. Valentin, 160 Conn. 18, 26, 273 A.2d 697 
(1970).” 
 

•  Angiolillo v. Buckmiller, 102 Conn. App. 697, 715, 927 

A.2d 312 (2007). “‘The rule concerning appearances is a 
rule of convenience, and as such should be observed . . . 
however, there may be an actual appearance for all the 
purposes of a defense without an entry on the docket. . . . 
Additionally, [t]he entry of an appearance need not 
necessarily be made by filing a formal appearance form. . 
. . The rules of practice will be interpreted liberally in any 
case where it shall be manifest that a strict adherence to 
them will work an injustice.’ . . . Fontaine v. Thomas, 
supra, 51 Conn. App. 81. The fact that Corona was 
included in an answer that was filed on behalf of several 
of the defendants does not indicate that he had made an 
appearance in fact and is distinguishable from cases 
concluding that such an appearance had been made.” 
 

•  Beardsley v. Beardsley, 144 Conn. 725, 730-731, 137 

A.2d 752 (1957). “The entry of an appearance need not 
necessarily be made by filing a formal appearance form. 
The conduct of a party may operate as a general 
appearance. Ives v. East Haven, 48 Conn. 272, 286; 
Schoonmaker v. Albertson & Douglass Machine Co., 51 
Conn. 387, 393; Rommell v. Walsh, 127 Conn. 16, 18, 15 
A.2d 6. ‘A general appearance may arise by implication 
from the defendant's seeking, taking, or agreeing to, 
some step or proceeding in the cause, beneficial to 
himself or detrimental to the plaintiff, other than one 
contesting the jurisdiction only.’ 3 Am. Jur. 787, § 10; 
People v. Estep, 6 Ill. 2d 127, 128, 126 N.E.2d 637. The 
defendant's letter came within the scope of this rule. The 
court was entitled to consider the whole course of conduct 
of the defendant, both in filing the general appearance 
forms and in writing the letter, in determining whether he 
had voluntarily submitted himself to the in personam 
jurisdiction of the court. It concluded that he had. This 
conclusion cannot be disturbed.”

Conn. Practice Book § 17-20(d) (2022). 

“A motion to set aside a default where no judgment has 
been rendered may be granted by the judicial authority 
for good cause shown upon such terms as it may impose

•  Ventura Law v. Ganim Legal, P.C., Superior Court, Judicial 
District of Danbury at Danbury, No. DBDCV20-6035299-S 
(October 30, 2020). “Practice Book §17-42, which 
governs the opening of a default where judgment has not 
been rendered, provides in relevant part that a ‘motion to 
set aside a default where no judgment has been rendered 
may be granted by the judicial authority for good cause 
shown upon such terms as it may impose.’ See Rowe v. 
Goulet, 89 Conn. App. 836, 841, 875 A.2d 564 (2009). In 
deciding whether good cause has been shown, as 
contemplated by Practice Book §17-42, the court, in its 
discretion, ‘may consider not only the presence of mistake 
accident, inadvertence, misfortune or other reasonable 
cause . . . factors such as the seriousness of the default, 
its duration, the reasons for it and the degree of 
contumacy involved; . . . but also the totality of the 
circumstances, including whether the delay has caused

•  Ryan v. Cassella, 180 Conn. App. 461, 465, 184 A.3d 311 
(2018). “On June 16, 2014 the plaintiff filed a motion for 
default due to the defendant’s failure to appear. By order 
dated June 24, 2014, the trial court clerk granted that 
motion…The order further indicated that if the defendant 
filed an appearance before judgment was rendered, ‘the 
default for failure to appear shall automatically be set 
aside by operation of law.’ A copy of that order was sent 
to the defendant. When the defendant did not file an 
appearance or otherwise respond to the order, the 
plaintiff, on July 25, 2014 filed a certificate of closed 
pleadings and a claim for a hearing in damages on the 
previously entered default.” 
 

•  Deutsche Bank National Trust Company v. Bertrand, 140 
Conn. App. 646, 648, 59 A.3d 864, 866 (2013). “On 
March 6, 2009, the plaintiff filed a motion to default the 
defendant for failure to appear, which the clerk of the 
court granted on March 9, 2009. See Practice Book § 17-
20 (d). That same day, the defendant filed an appearance 
as a self-represented party, which automatically set aside 
the default as a matter of law. See Practice Book § 17-20 
(d).”

Court, Judicial District of Ansonia-Milford At Milford, No.

6926160). “‘[I]t is axiomatic that the right to move to 
open and vacate a judgment assumes that the party who 
is to exercise the right be given the opportunity to know 
that there is a judgment to open. [The Appellate Court] 
ha[s] indicated that for the purpose of opening a default 
judgment . . . a delay in notifying the defendant of the 
judgment would . . . extend the time in which the 
defendant could move to set aside the judgment.’

Before Judgment 
 
“. . . an appearance for a party after the entry against 
such party of a . . . judgment after default for failure to 
appear shall not affect the entry of . . . any judgment 
after default.” Conn. Practice Book § 3-2 (2022). 
 
“Any judgment rendered or decree passed upon a default 
or nonsuit may be set aside within four months 
succeeding the date on which notice was sent, and the 
case reinstated on the docket on such terms in respect to 
costs as the judicial authority deems reasonable, upon the 
written motion of any party or person prejudiced thereby, 
showing reasonable cause, or that a good cause of action 
or defense in whole or in part existed at the time of the 
rendition of such judgment or the passage of such decree, 
and that the plaintiff or the defendant was prevented by 
mistake, accident or other reasonable cause from 
prosecuting or appearing to make the same.” Conn. 
Practice Book § 17-43(a) (2022). 
 
“A default is not a judgment. It is an order of the court 
the effect of which is to preclude the defendant from 
making any further defense in the case so far as liability is 
concerned. A judgment upon default, on the other hand, 
is the final judgment in the case . . .” Automotive Twins, 
Inc. v. Klein, 138 Conn. 28, 33, 82 A.2d 146 (1951). 
 
“A judgment rendered upon a default or nonsuit may be 
set aside only if the moving party demonstrates that he 
has been prejudiced by the judgment, that ‘reasonable 
cause’ or a ‘good cause of action or defense . . . existed at 
the time of the rendition of the judgment’ and that the 
movant was prevented by ‘mistake, accident or other 
reasonable cause from prosecuting the action or making 
the defense.’” Steve Viglione Sheet Metal Co. v. 
Sakonchick, 190 Conn. 707, 712, 462 A.2d 1037 (1983).

on the defaulted party, and [t]he judgment should not 
ordinarily be opened if his failure to appear ... resulted 
from his own negligence.’ (Internal quotation marks 
omitted.) People's Bank v. Horesco, 205 Conn. 319, 323, 
533 A.2d 850 (1987). ‘A court should not open a default 
judgment in cases where the defendants admit they 
received actual notice and simply chose to ignore the 
court's authority. ... Negligence of a party or his counsel 
is insufficient for purposes of § 52–212 to set aside a 
default judgment.’  (Citations omitted.) State v. Ritz 
Realty Corp., 63 Conn. App. 544, 548–49, 776 A.2d 1195 
(2001). Because the failure to satisfy either prong of § 
52–212 is fatal, and the defendant failed to satisfy the 
reasonable cause prong, we need not address the good 
defense prong. See Weinstein & Wisser, P.C. v. Cornelius, 
151 Conn. App. 174, 180, 94 A.3d 700 (2014) (movant 
must satisfy both prongs of § 52–212; failure to meet 
either prong is fatal). Accordingly, we conclude that the 
court did not abuse its discretion in denying the 
defendant's motions to open.” 
 

•  Oquendo v. Club Assist Rd. Serv. U.S., Inc., Superior 
Court, Judicial District of New Britain, HHB-CV14-
6026540-S (Aug. 9, 2016) (2016 Conn. Super. Lexis 
2195) (2016 WL 5012349). “General Statutes § 52-212 
(a) sets forth the requirements of a motion to open a 
judgment upon default or nonsuit if filed within four 
months on which the judgment was rendered or passed. 
Practice Book § 17-43 (a) tracks the language of General 
Statutes § 52-212 (a) and adds language that the four 
months runs succeeding the date notice was sent. The 
1997 comment to the rule change clearly states that this 
notice is sent by the court. The rule and comment do not 
require the notice to be sent by the court to nonappearing 
defendants. The JDNO only goes to appearing parties. 
Therefore, no court notice is sent to nonappearing 
defendants nor is there any obligation on the court to do 
so.  
    Practice Book § 17-22, however, does obligate the 
prevailing party to send notice of the judgment after 
default for failure to enter an appearance to the party 
against whom it is directed, which necessarily, is the 
nonappearing party. Service must be made in accordance 
with Practice Book § 10-14 with a copy filed with the 
clerk’s office. Section 10-14 requires the certification to a 
nonappearing party be made in accordance with Practice 
Book § 10-12 (a) and (b) and specify the address upon 
which it is made. . . . 
     In McLaughlin v. Smoron, 62 Conn. App. 367, 771 
A.2d 201 (2001), the court determined that the 
defendants’ motion to open, although filed more than two 
years later, was timely because the plaintiff did not send 
proper notice of the default judgment required by Practice 
Book § 17-22. See also Tyler E. Lyman, Inc. v. Lodrini, 63

have not received notice of the default judgment . . . the 
time within which they may move to set aside the 
judgment is extended by the delay in notification.’ 
[Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.]) 
With McLaughlin in mind, because the plaintiff did not 
send notice as required by Practice Book § 17-22, the 
defendant’s four month period is extended, and the 
motion is timely.” 
 

•  710 Long Ridge Operating Company II, LLC v. Randolph 
Stebbins, 153 Conn. App. 288, 295-296, 101 A.3d 292, 
297 (2014). “The statutory limitation imposed on motions 
to open judgments does not implicate the court’s 
jurisdiction. Rather, our Supreme Court has explained 
that General Statutes ‘§ 52-212a operates as a constraint, 
not on the trial court’s jurisdictional authority, but on its 
substantive authority to adjudicate the merits of the case 
before it.’ Kim v. Magnotta, 249 Conn. 94, 104, 733 A.2d 
809 (1999) . . . In the present case, the trial court lacked 
authority to open the judgment because the defendant 
never filed a motion to open pursuant to § 52-212 . . . 
Although the defendant filed his motion to dismiss within 
the four month time limit imposed by § 52-212, the 
motion to dismiss did not satisfy the requirements of § 
52-212 (a), specifically as to ‘reasonable cause, or that a 
good cause of action or defense in whole or in part existed 
at the time of the rendition of the judgment or the 
passage of the decree, and that the plaintiff or defendant 
was prevented by mistake, accident or other reasonable 
cause from prosecuting the action or making the 
defense.’” 
 

•  Chambers v. Tyles, Superior Court, Judicial District of 
Hartford at Hartford, No. HHDCV106011127S (July 2, 
2012) (2012 Conn. Super. Lexis 1720) (2012 WL 
3089736). “The defendant argues that the court should 
open the default judgment because the court lacked 
personal jurisdiction to render the judgment against him 
due to insufficiency of service of process . . . In the 
present case, the marshal’s return of service . . . states 
that the marshal made personal service on the defendant 
. . . In the defendant’s motion to open, the defendant 
argues that on the date recited in the marshal’s return, he 
was in New York, New York, and, therefore, was not 
personally served by the marshal . . . For the foregoing 
reasons, the defendant has satisfied the statutory 
requirements set forth in General Statutes § 52-212(a) 
and Practice Book § 17-43, and the court grants the

The court determined that state fleet operations had 
received notice of the plaintiff's motion for default for 
failure to appear because the plaintiff had mailed a copy 
of that motion to the attorney general's office. The 
plaintiff also mailed her motion for judgment after default 
and certificate of closed pleadings to the attorney 
general's office. The court concluded that the plaintiff 
properly had addressed those pleadings to the attorney 
general's office rather than to state fleet operations 
because state fleet operations had not filed an appearance 
and the attorney general's office is state fleet operations' 
agent for service of process. In support of its conclusion, 
the court cited General Statutes § 52-64, which provides 
that ‘service of civil process in any civil action or 
proceeding maintainable against . . . the state or against 
any institution, board, commission, department or 
administrative tribunal thereof . . . may be made by 
leaving a true and attested copy of the process, including 
the declaration or complaint, with the Attorney General or 
at his office in Hartford.’” (p. 869-870) 

Section 52-64, however, concerns civil process, not 
subsequent pleadings. Civil process is the manner in 
which civil actions are commenced. General Statutes § 
52-45a provides that civil process ‘consists of a writ of 
summons or attachment, describing the parties, the court 
to which it is returnable, the return day, the date and 
place for the filing of an appearance and information 
required by the Office of the Chief Court Administrator. 
The writ shall be accompanied by the plaintiff's complaint. 
. . .’ Service of subsequent pleadings is not by process, 
but instead usually by mail. See Practice Book § 10-13. 
The court therefore improperly relied on General Statutes 
§ 52-64. The court should have relied on Practice Book § 
10-12 (b), which provides: ‘It shall be the responsibility of 
counsel or a pro se party at the time of filing a motion for 
default for failure to appear to serve the party sought to 
be defaulted with a copy of the motion. Upon good cause 
shown, the judicial authority may dispense with this 
requirement when judgment is rendered.’” (p. 870)

operations (state fleet operations), appeals from the 
judgment of the trial court denying its motion to open the 
judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff, JoLynn Wilson, 
after it had been defaulted for failure to appear. . .  On 
appeal, state fleet operations claims that the court

not receive actual notice of the plaintiff's motion for 
default for failure to appear . . .  We agree with the first 
claim and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial

SUPERIOR COURT 

JEFF DZIEDZIC 

J.D. OF NEW LONDON 

PINE ISLAND MARINA, LLC 

NOVEMBER 9, 2011 

AT NEW LONDON 

: 

: 

: 

: 

MOTION TO OPEN JUDGMENT UPON DEFAULT 

The Defendant, Pine Island Marina, LLC, respectfully requests that the Default 

granted on September 28, 2011 be opened pursuant to Prac. Book §§ 17-43. Prac. 

Book §§ 17-43 allows “any judgment rendered…upon a default or non-suit may be 

set aside within four months succeeding the date on which notice was sent.” In this, 

case Notice was sent on July 12, 2011. That is less than four months from the filing 

date of this motion. The Defendant was ill advised that it should take no action in 

this case on the basis that no judgment could be rendered against it because of the 

dissolution. This was obviously error and is why the Defendant failed to file an 

appearance. 

 

The Defendant has a number of good faith defenses to present. In this case 

the Defendant will allege that the limited liability company was dissolved prior to the 

claim being submitted. The Defendant will claim that the Plaintiff breached contract 

with the Defendant in that he did not properly manage the company as was his duty. 

The Defendant will also claim that the Plaintiff failed to act in the best interest of the 

business by soliciting interference from a manager at People’s United Bank which 

interfered with the relationship between the Plaintiff and the Defendant. The Plaintiff 

failed to give the Defendant full disclosure in accounting with regards to financial 

matters nor did the Plaintiff advise the Defendant of the financial decline of the 

business. Further, the Plaintiff failed to run the business in accordance with the 

quality and standards recognized and promulgated by the marina and boating

community, the Company and applicable federal, state, and local laws and 

ordinances. Finally, the Plaintiff failed to outline to the court that the employment 

agreement which is at the core of this lawsuit is subject to binding arbitration rather 

than judgment by the court. The Defendant may claim this right. 

Given that the Defendant has numerous good faith defenses to this case, the 

Defendant respectfully requests that the Judgment against them be opened.

“Although it is established that entry of default 
conclusively establishes the liability of a defendant, the 
plaintiff offers no authority to support its position that 
entry of default conclusively establishes the subject 
matter jurisdiction of the court. Moreover, we disagree 
with this position because it essentially posits that a party 
can waive a subject matter jurisdiction challenge by virtue 
of a pleading deficiency, namely, a failure to reply to 
jurisdictional allegations during the pleading stage.”

motion for default which shall be acted on by the clerk not 
less than seven days from the filing of the motion, without

was required to set aside a default judgment as a matter 
of law when the default had been rendered improperly. 
After the defendants in that case had filed answers and 
counterclaims to the plaintiff's complaint, the plaintiff filed 
a request to revise the defendants' counterclaim. Id., 
769-70. The plaintiff subsequently moved for default for 
failure to plead when the defendants did not respond to 
the request to revise the counterclaim. Id., 770. The court

Judgment upon Default for Failure to Plead 
 
“If a party who has been defaulted under this section files 
an answer before a judgment after default has been 
rendered by the judicial authority, the default shall 
automatically be set aside by operation of law unless a 
claim for a hearing in damages or a motion for judgment 
has been filed. If a claim for a hearing in damages or a 
motion for judgment has been filed, the default may be 
set aside only by the judicial authority. A claim for a 
hearing in damages or motion for judgment shall not be 
filed before the expiration of fifteen days from the date of 
notice of issuance of the default under this subsection.” 
Conn. Practice Book § 17-32(b) (2022). 
 
“A motion to set aside a default where no judgment has 
been rendered may be granted by the judicial authority 
for good cause shown upon such terms as it may impose. 
As part of its order, the judicial authority may extend the 
time for filing pleadings or disclosure in favor of a party 
who has not been negligent. Certain defaults may be set 
aside by the clerk pursuant to Sections 17-20 and 17-32.”

•  Motion for Set Aside Default, Connecticut Appellate Court 
Records and Briefs (October 1994). Whalen v. Ives, 37 
Conn. App. 7, 654 A.2d 798 (1995). Figure 4. 
 

•  Kaye v. Housman, 184 Conn. App. 808, 821-822, 195 
A.3d 1168 (2018).” In the present case, the defendant 
filed an answer and four special defenses, which the 
plaintiff did not ask him to revise, before the court 
granted the plaintiff’s motion for default. “[T]here is ... 
support for the proposition that a court commits plain 
error if, prior to rendering a judgment on default, the 
court fails to accept for filing a defaulted party’s pleading 
solely on the ground that the pleading is untimely.... 
General Statutes § 52-121 (a) provides in relevant part: 
Any pleading in any civil action may be filed after the 
expiration of the time fixed by statute or by any rule of 
the court until the court has heard any motion for 
judgment by default ... for failure to plead which has been 
filed in writing with the court in which the action is 
pending.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) People’s 
United Bank v. Bok, supra, 143 Conn. App. at 268, 70 
A.3d 1074. “Moreover, ‘[o]ur Supreme Court has 
expressed a policy to bring about a trial on the merits of a 
dispute whenever possible to secure for the litigant his 
day in court.’” Id., quoting Connecticut Light & Power Co. 
v. St. John, supra, 80 Conn. App. at 775, 837 A.2d 841. 
The court, therefore, was without authority to grant the 
motion for default against the defendant and, thus, should 
have granted his motion to strike the matter from the 
hearing in damages list. “ 
 

•  Bank of New York Mellon v. Talbot, 174 Conn. App. 377, 
383, 165 A.3d 1253 (2017). “‘General Statutes § 52-119 
provides that [p]arties failing to plead according to the 
rules and orders of the court may be . . . defaulted . . . . 
Section 10-18 of our rules of practice essentially mirrors 
that language.’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.)  
People's United Bank v. Bok, supra, 143 Conn. App. 268. 
‘[T]he effect of a default is to preclude the defendant from 
making any further defense in the case so far as liability is 
concerned . . . .’ Practice Book § 17-33 (b). Practice Book 
§ 17-33 (b) provides that when a party is in default for 
failure to plead, ‘the judicial authority, at or after the time 
it renders the default . . . may also render judgment in 
foreclosure cases . . . .’ If the defaulted party has filed an 
answer before judgment is rendered, however, the default 
is automatically set aside by operation of law. Practice 
Book § 17-32 (b). If a motion for judgment already has 
been filed by the adverse party at the time the defaulted 
party files his answer, however, ‘the default may be set 
aside only by the judicial authority.’ Practice Book § 17-32

RECORDS & 
BRIEFS: 
 

A.3d 524 (2015). “‘The defendant Patrick Treglia argues 
first that the default must be opened as a matter of right 
because Connecticut Practice Book section 17-32 requires 
the clerk to set aside a default entered for failure to plead 
if the defaulted party files an answer before a judgment 
after default has been rendered. However, the court finds 
that it is the second sentence of section 17-32 (b) that 
controls. 'If a claim for [a] hearing [in] damages or a 
motion for judgment has been filed, the default may be 
set aside only by the judicial authority.' In the case at bar 
the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment on 
August 11, 2012, almost three months before [Patrick 
Treglia] filed his motion to open the default. . . . 
Accordingly, the decision of whether or not to open the 
default is one that is within the court's discretion. In 
determining whether or not to exercise that discretion the 
court is guided by Practice Book section 17-42 which 
states 'a motion to set aside a default when no judgment 
has been rendered may be granted by the judicial 
authority for good cause shown.' . . . In the instant case 
[Patrick Treglia] has offered no credible justification for 
the failure to plead within the time allowed by law, or for 
failure to move to open the default within a reasonable 
time thereafter." (p. 7-8) 

The plaintiff argues that ‘there is no reason courts should 
distinguish between motions for judgment and motions for 
summary judgment in this context.’ We disagree.” (p. 13) 

  “

  “

We conclude that, under the facts of the present case, a 
‘motion for judgment’ for the purposes of § 17-32 (b) 
does not encompass a motion for summary judgment. We 
further conclude that, because Patrick Treglia filed an 
answer to the plaintiff's complaint and the plaintiff never 
filed a motion for judgment upon default, the clerk, 
pursuant to § 17-32 (b), was required to set aside the 
default entered against Patrick Treglia, and there was no 
need for judicial discretion to be employed. Once the 
default was opened, the court did not have discretion over 
Patrick Treglia's motion to set aside the default and 
improperly denied it. The judgment of strict foreclosure 
against Patrick Treglia must be reversed and the clerk 
must set aside the default against him.” (p. 13-14) 
 

•  Spilke v. Wicklow, 138 Conn. App. 251, 267-268, 53 A.3d 
245, 254-255 (2012). “The defendants then filed a motion 
to open the default for failure to plead on October 18, 
2010. In the motion, the defendants argued that the 
default was due to miscommunication between the 
defendants and their attorney as well as their attorney's 
chronic illness . . . The court stated that, although the 
defendants had apprised it that their attorney had health 
issues in late 2009, that ‘does not answer, or even 
address, the question of how or why defaults which

entered in March, 2007, were permitted to stand 
unchallenged for more than three years. The only 
explanation given, essentially that [the defendants] had 
instructed [their counsel] to try to handle their case “on 
the cheap” ... is hardly “good cause” for allowing three 
years ... or even the first two of those years, before [the 
defendants’ attorney’s] health problems created additional 
problems ... to pass without taking any action with 
respect to the defaults.’ The court therefore determined 
that there was no good cause to set aside the default and 
denied the defendants’ motion.” 
 

•  Giano v. Salvatore, 136 Conn. App. 834, 46 A.3d 996 

(2012). “It is this court's ‘well settled jurisprudence that 
[a] court should not open a default judgment in cases 
where the defendants admit they received actual notice 
and simply chose to ignore the court's authority. . . . 
Negligence is no ground for vacating a judgment, and it 
has been consistently held that the denial of a motion to 
open a default judgment should not be held an abuse of 
discretion where the failure to assert a defense was the 
result of negligence. . . . Negligence of a party or his 
counsel is insufficient for purposes of § 52-212 to set 
aside a default judgment.’” (p. 843) 

The defendant's mistaken belief that the plaintiff would 
be withdrawing the case is no excuse for her failure to 
plead after she received actual notice of the default and of 
the impending judgment. See Nelson v. The Contractor 
Group, LLC, supra, 127 Conn. App. 50-51 (trial court did 
not abuse discretion in denying motion to open after 
defendant failed to raise defense because of mistaken 
belief that plaintiff's counsel would contact him before 
moving forward with litigation). Accordingly, this claim 
fails.” (p. 844) 
 

•  Snowdon v. Grillo, 114 Conn. App. 131, 138, 968 A.2d 
984, 989 (2009). “The distinction between whether 
Practice Book § 17–32 applies or Practice Book § 17–42 
applies is whether a claim for a hearing in damages is 
filed before, or after, a motion to set aside the default is 
filed.”

automatically set aside by the filing of an answer. Practice

‘Section [17-32] . . . mandates that the clerk set the

pleadings by filing an answer prior to judgment" Id., 13; 
see also Wright v. USAA Casualty Insurance, supra, 
Superior Court, Docket No. CV 03 0069913. . . . In the 
present case, the defendant is in default for failure to

Section 2b: Judgment upon Default for 
Failure to Plead  

A Guide to Resources in the Law Library 
 

SCOPE: 

Bibliographic resources relating to a judgment after default 
for failure to plead, and opening or setting aside a judgment 
upon default for failure to plead. 

SEE ALSO:  
 

•  Setting Aside or Opening a Default for Failure to Plead 

Before Judgment 

 

 

DEFINITIONS: 

• 

“Any judgment rendered . . . upon a default . . . may be 
set aside within four months succeeding the date on 
which notice was sent, and the case reinstated on the 
docket on such terms in respect to costs as the judicial 
authority deems reasonable, upon the written motion of 
any party or person prejudiced thereby, showing 
reasonable cause, or that a good cause of action or 
defense in whole or in part existed at the time of the 
rendition of such judgment . . . and that the plaintiff or 
the defendant was prevented by mistake, accident or 
other reasonable cause from prosecuting or appearing to 
make the same.” Conn. Practice Book § 17-43(a) (2022). 
 
“A default is not a judgment. It is an order of the court 
the effect of which is to preclude the defendant from 
making any further defense in the case so far as liability is 
concerned. A judgment upon default, on the other hand, 
is the final judgment in the case . . .” Automotive Twins, 
Inc. v. Klein, 138 Conn. 28, 33, 82 A.2d 146, 149 (1951).

two part showing that (1) a good defense existed at the 
time an adverse judgment was rendered; and (2) the 
defense was not at that time raised by reason of mistake, 
accident or other reasonable cause.... The party moving 
to open a default judgment must not only allege, but also 
make a showing sufficient to satisfy [that] two-pronged 
test .... [B]ecause the movant must satisfy both prongs of 
this analysis, failure to meet either prong is fatal to its 
motion.’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Little v.

Haven, No. NNHCV08-5025041-S (Nov. 21, 2016) (Not 
Reported) (2016 WL 7655969). “This matter was heard 
before this court on October 19, 2016. The purpose of the 
hearing was to conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding 
the remand of this case from the Appellate Court decision 
of Kearse v. Taylor, 165 Conn. App. 780, 140 A.3d 389 
(2016).” (p. 1) 

The Appellate Court remanded the case regarding the 
following: ‘The issue of whether the defendants received 
notice of the rendering of the default judgment, and, if so, 
when they received that notice, is a question of fact for 
the fact finder.’ Id., at 790-91.” (p. 1) 

The defendant filed her Motion to Open Judgment on 
March 27, 2015. (See #138 Court File.) March 27, 2015 is 
more than four (4) months after actual notice provided to 
the plaintiff on February 10, 2014 of this court's order. . .  
The court concludes that the Motion to Open the 
Judgment was untimely. Therefore, the court denies the 
Motion to Open the Judgment.” (p. 5-6)

•  Dawson v. Britagna, 162 Conn. App. 801, 806, 133 A.3d

limit[s] the authority [of the trial court] to open 
judgments to a four month period, [this statute does] not 
preclude the opening of a default judgment that is 
rendered without jurisdiction over a defendant . . . . As a 
matter of law, in the absence of jurisdiction over the 
parties, a judgment is void ab initio and is subject to both 
direct and collateral attack . . . . A trial court’s authority 
to open such judgments does not arise from . . . § 52-
212(a) or Practice Book [§17-43] but from its inherent 
power to open a judgment rendered without jurisdiction 
. . . . In other words, a court always has the inherent 
authority to open a default judgment, irrespective of the 
four month rule and the valid defense and good cause 
requirement in Practice Book § 17-43 and General 
Statutes § 52-212(a), if the judgment was rendered 
without jurisdiction of the parties or of the subject

Wisser, P.C. v. Cornelius, 151 Conn. App. 174, 180-81, 94 
A.3d 700 (2014).” 
 
Insurance Co. of Pennsylvania v. Waterfield, 102 Conn. 
App. 277, 284-285, 925 A.2d 451, 456 (2007). “The 
defendant argues that the court improperly refused to 
open the judgment. Specifically, the defendant argues 
that the court failed to follow General Statutes §§ 52–120 
and 52–121(a) and (c) . . . Section 52–120, which 
requires a written agreement, is inapplicable because no 
such agreement exists. The defendant argues that the 
federal scheduling order was the written agreement. He 
neither cites, nor does our research reveal, however, any 
legal support for his argument. Likewise, § 52–121(c) is 
not applicable in this case because the court did not 
impose a penalty on the defendant for failure to plead, 
but rather rendered judgment of default for failure to 
plead pursuant to General Statutes § 52–121(b). Finally, 
§ 52–121(a) does not result in an automatic grant of a 
motion to open, as the defendant claims; rather, the 
granting of a motion to open is within the court’s 
discretion. The defendant had ample time to respond to 
the amended complaint, which was filed on May 7, 2004. 
Furthermore, the fact that the defendant filed a third 
motion for an extension of time is irrelevant to the court’s 
denial of the defendant’s motion to open. In this case, on 
the basis of the detailed time line, which reveals that the 
defendant’s dilatory tactics permeate this litigation, the 
court was well within its discretion to handle the situation 
as it did.” 
 

215, 217 (1999). “An examination of the transcript of the 
hearing in damages, held on May 17, 1996, discloses that 
the defendants offered an answer to the trial court, which 
they were attempting to file that morning. The trial court 
ruled, however, that it would not permit the defendants to 
file the answer at that time. It noted that it had been 
almost one year since the default had been entered 
against them and ruled that to permit the filing of the 
answer, the result of which would have been to set aside 
the default under Practice Book § 17-32, would have been 
‘highly improper.’ The trial court found that the attempted 
filing of the defendants’ answer at that time was ‘a patent 
attempt to stall unfairly and unreasonably a matter that 
has already been defaulted.’ Our review of the record 
reveals that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in 
refusing to accept the defendants’ answer or in refusing to 
set aside the default judgment for failure to plead.”

MOTION TO OPEN JUDGMENT UPON DEFAULT 

    D

. 

  V

   

The Defendant in the above-captioned case, hereby requests this Honorable 

Court to open the judgment upon default entered by the Court on August 4, 2005. 

This Court has jurisdiction because this motion is timely filed within the four months 

allowed by Conn. Gen. Stat. §52-212 (2005) and the $70 filing fee required by Conn. 

Gen. Stat. § 52-259c (2005) has been paid. 

 

This is not a case where I placed my head in the sand and hoped for the best. 

I have diligently opposed the Plaintiff’s claims, at every step of the litigation. The 

August 30, 2004 default was granted on the same day that my motion to extend the 

time to Respond to Plaintiffs’ Revised Complaint was denied. As explained above, 

subsequent to the State Court’s denial of my request for an extension within which 

to respond to the plaintiff’s complaint, while in Federal Court, the parties signed an 

agreement to give me an extension. I have not ignored this litigation, and I request 

the opportunity to clear my name of these scandalous, unfounded larceny charges, 

and to prove my Special Defenses and Counterclaims, all of which is in the best 

interests of justice.

orders may include the following: (5) An order of 
dismissal, nonsuit or default.” Conn. Practice Book § 13-
14 (2022). 
 

•  Disclosure of Defense: “In any action to foreclose or to 
discharge any mortgage or lien or to quiet title, or in any 
action upon any written contract, in which there is an 
appearance by an attorney for any defendant, the plaintiff 
may at any time file and serve in accordance with 
Sections 10-12 through 10-17 a written demand that such 
attorney present to the court, to become a part of the file 
in such case, a writing signed by the attorney stating 
whether he or she has reason to believe and does believe 
that there exists a bona fide defense to the plaintiff’s 
action and whether such defense will be made, together 
with a general statement of the nature or substance of 
such defense. If the defendant fails to disclose a defense 
within ten days of the filing of such demand in any action 
to foreclose a mortgage or lien or to quiet title, or in any 
action upon any written contract, the plaintiff may file a 
written motion that a default be entered against the 
defendant by reason of the failure of the defendant to 
disclose a defense. If no disclosure of defense has been 
filed, the judicial authority may order judgment upon 
default to be entered for the plaintiff at the time the 
motion is heard or thereafter, provided that in either 
event a separate motion for such judgment has been filed. 
The motions for default and for judgment upon default

(2021). “Thereafter, on March 26, 2018, the plaintiff filed 
a motion for default for the defendant's failure to appear 
at his deposition. In support of his motion for default, the 
plaintiff attached the deposition notice, as well as a brief 
transcript of the deposition's preliminary proceeding on 
March 14, 2018, in which his attorney recounted the 
events leading up to the deposition. The motion simply 
asserted that the defendant had notice, and was aware of 
the scheduled deposition and failed to appear. In granting 
the plaintiff's motion for default, the court, Shapiro, J., 
stated: "The defendant filed no objection in response to 
the motion for default. Since the defendant failed to 
attend his scheduled deposition, a default may enter 
against the defendant." Notice of the default was issued

CASES: 

•  Gutierrez v. Mosor, 206 Conn. App. 818, 261 A.3d 850 

The defendant claims that the trial court abused its 
discretion in defaulting him as a sanction for his failure to 
attend the deposition. Specifically, the defendant claims 
that the court's imposition of the sanction of default was 
an abuse of discretion because (1) there was nothing in 
the record demonstrating that he acted in bad faith, that 
his failure to attend the deposition resulted from wilful 
misconduct, or that he engaged in a repeated pattern of 
misbehavior, (2) his conduct did not rise to the level of 
being contumacious, and (3) the sanction imposed was 
disproportionate to the conduct at issue. We agree.” (p. 
825) 
 

  “

by the court on April 11, 2018.” (p. 821-822) 

•  Spatta v. American Classic Cars, LLC, 150 Conn. App. 20, 
23-24, 90 A.3d 318, 320-321 (2014). “‘In the course of 
ruling on the motion for sanctions, the court did not 
impose the sanction of default that was threatened in the 
court’s July 25, 2011 order. Instead, the court ... gave the 
defendants another opportunity to meet their discovery 
obligations . . . The responses to all seven requests for 
production are woefully deficient and suggest bad faith by 
the defendants . . . In view of the history regarding 
discovery issues in this case, the inadequate responses by 
the defendants justify the imposition of sanctions at this 
time. [See] Practice Book [§] 13–14(b).’” 
 

•  Thompson v. Orcutt, 70 Conn. App. 427, 442, 800 A.2d 

530, 541 (2002). “Entry of a default for failure to appear 
for trial is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial 
court. Brunswick School, Inc. v. Hutter, 53 Conn. App. 
455, 459, 730 A.2d 1206 (1999). Practice Book § 17–19 
provides in relevant part: ‘If a party ... fails without 
proper excuse to appear in person or by counsel for trial, 
the party may be nonsuited or defaulted by the judicial 
authority.’ In response to the defendants’ motion for 
articulation, the trial court stated that the bankruptcy 
trustee had been defaulted for failure to appear at trial. 
Apart from the entry of a formal appearance on February 
23, 1999, O’Neil did not submit any pleadings in the case, 
did not appear on the scheduled trial date and has not 
filed a motion to open the default. We conclude that the 
court did not abuse its discretion in defaulting O’Neil for 
his failure to appear at trial.”

they failed to attend the pretrial is governed by Practice 
Book § 17-42: ‘A motion to set aside a default where no 
judgment has been rendered may be granted by the 
judicial authority for good cause shown upon such terms 
as it may impose.’ The record clearly demonstrates that 
the only notice defendants received of the May 15, 2008 
pretrial was Attorney Miller’s certified letter informing 
them of his intention to seek leave to withdraw as their 
counsel. Attorney Miller mentions the pretrial on the 
second page of his letter and it is understandable 
defendants may have overlooked it or simply did not 
realize what a pretrial was or that they had to attend. This 
is particularly plausible in light of the evidence that the 
letter was sent as a result of a deteriorated relationship 
between defendants and Attorney Miller. As a result, the 
court finds that good cause existed for defendants’ failure 
to attend the pretrial and the default entered on May 15, 
2008 is hereby set aside.” 
 

Reopening judgment upon default 
• 

Jaconski v. AMF, Inc., 208 Conn. 230, 237-238, 543 A.2d 
728 (1988). “In Eastern Elevator Co. v. Scalzi, supra, 
131-32, we reiterated that in granting or denying a 
motion to open a judgment, the trial court is required to 
exercise a sound judicial discretion and its decision will be 
set aside only for an abuse of such discretion. We noted in 
Jaquith v. Revson, supra, that the denial of a motion to 
set aside a nonsuit should not be held to be an abuse of 
discretion in any case in which it appears that a plaintiff 
has not been prevented from prosecuting the claim by 
mistake, accident or other reasonable cause. Further, we 
have long held that negligence is no ground for vacating a 
judgment, and that the denial of a motion to open a 
nonsuit judgment should not be held an abuse of 
discretion where the failure to prosecute the claim was the 
result of negligence. People's Bank v. Horesco, 205 Conn. 
319, 323-24, 533 A.2d 850 (1987); Jaquith v. Revson, 
supra, 432; Automotive Twins, Inc. v. Klein, 138 Conn.

A.2d 146, 149-150 (1951). “An application to open a 
judgment upon default is, when not based on a pure error 
of law, addressed to the sound discretion of the court. 
Jartman v. Pacific Fire Ins. Co., 69 Conn. 355, 362, 37 A. 
970. For this discretion to be exercised in favor of the 
defaulted party, it must be shown that he was prevented 
from appearing by ‘mistake, accident or other reasonable 
cause.’ The judgment should not ordinarily be opened if 
his failure to appear or procure a continuance resulted 
from his own negligence. Schoonmaker v. Albertson & 
Douglass Machine Co., supra, 392.  
     The defendant’s excuse for not appearing was that he 
was engaged in trial elsewhere. We are cognizant of the

custom which has grown up of adjourning the trial of a 
case if, when it is reached, counsel for any party is 
actually engaged in the trial of another case. Such an 
adjournment, however, is not a matter of right. It is a 
matter of courtesy - a courtesy extended by both 
opposing counsel and the court. Its exercise calls for the 
reciprocal courtesy on the part of the lawyer engaged 
elsewhere of at least communicating the fact of his 
engagement to both opposing counsel and the court in 
advance of the time set for the trial. Under ordinary 
circumstances, an attorney who fails so to advise of his 
inability to attend the trial thereby evinces a lack of 
proper respect for the court. If a default results from such 
failure, he has no ground for complaint. The default is the 
result of his own neglect.”

  § 47a-26a. Failure to plead. Judgment. “If the defendant 
appears but does not plead within two days after the return 
day, the complainant may file a motion for judgment for 
failure to plead, served upon the defendant in the manner

is filed with the clerk, the judicial authority shall, not later 
than the first court day after the filing of such motion, enter 
judgment that the plaintiff recover possession or occupancy 
of the premises with costs, and execution shall issue subject

that the plaintiff recover possession or occupancy with 
costs.” 
 

•  § 17-30(c). “In summary process actions, a motion for 
judgment by default that is sent to the court either 
electronically or is hand-delivered to the court shall be 
deemed to be filed on the third business day following such 
delivery unless the party filing the motion for judgment by 
default certifies that the motion has also been sent 
electronically or hand-delivered on the same day to all 
opposing parties or their counsel.” 

  § 17-32(a). Where a defendant is in default for failure to

plead pursuant to Section 10-8, the plaintiff 
may file a written motion for default which shall 
be acted on by the clerk not less than seven days 
from the filing of the motion, without placement 
on the short calendar. 
 

•  § 17-32(b). If a party who has been defaulted under this 

section files an answer before a judgment after 
default has been rendered by the judicial authority, the 
default shall automatically be set aside by 
operation of law unless a claim for a hearing in 
damages or a motion for judgment has been filed. 
If a claim for a hearing in damages or a motion 
for judgment has been filed, the default may be 
set aside only by the judicial authority. A claim for 
a hearing in damages or motion for judgment shall 
not be filed before the expiration of fifteen days 
from the date of notice of issuance of the default 
under this subsection. 

 

•  § 17-33(b). “Since the effect of a default is to preclude the 
defendant from making any further defense in the case so 
far as liability is concerned, the judicial authority, at or after 
the time it renders the default, notwithstanding Section 17-
32 (b), may also render judgment in foreclosure cases, in 
actions similar thereto and in summary process actions, 
provided the plaintiff has also made a motion for judgment 
and provided further that any necessary affidavits of debt or 
accounts or statements verified by oath, in proper form, are

present case, however, the court did not deny the 
defendant's motion to strike because it was untimely. 
The court denied the motion because it could not act on 
it while the default was still in effect. ‘In an action at 
law, the rule is that the entry of a default operates as a 
confession by the defaulted defendant of the truth of the 
material facts alleged in the complaint which are 
essential to entitle the plaintiff to some of the relief 
prayed. . . . [I]ts effect is to preclude the defaulted

theory that he has admitted such of the facts alleged in 
the complaint as are essential to such a judgment. . . . 
Thus, [a] default admits the material facts that 
constitute a cause of action . . . and entry of default, 
when appropriately made, conclusively determines the 
liability of a defendant.’ (Citation omitted; internal 
quotation marks omitted.) Connecticut Light & Power 
Co. v. St. John, 80 Conn. App. 767, 775, 837 A.2d 841

could not consider the defendant's motion to strike until 
the default was set aside.” 
 
Deustche Bank National Trust Co. v. Thompson, 163 
Conn. App. 827, 835, 136 A.3d 1277 (2016). “Although 
it is established that entry of default conclusively 
establishes the liability of a defendant, the plaintiff offers 
no authority to support its position that entry of default 
conclusively establishes the subject matter jurisdiction 
of the court. Moreover, we disagree with this position 
because it essentially posits that a party can waive a 
subject matter jurisdiction challenge by virtue of a 
pleading deficiency, namely, a failure to reply to 
jurisdictional allegations during the pleading stage.” 
 
U.S. Bank National Association v. Works, 160 Conn App. 
49, 60, 124 A.3d 935 (2015). “The court then had to 
decide whether to set aside the default entered against 
the defendant. ‘A default is not a judgment. It is an 
order of the court the effect of which is to preclude the 
defendant from making any further defense in the case 
so far as liability is concerned.’ Automotive Twins, Inc. 
v. Klein, 138 Conn. 28, 33, 82 A.2d 146 (1951). In 
setting aside the default, the court permitted the 
defendant to file an answer and any special defenses 
and, in fact, instructed her to do so. The court's ruling 
setting aside the default was interlocutory, as it did not 
result in a final judgment, and therefore we may not 
review it at this time.”

•  § 24-16(a). “A defendant, unless the judicial authority shall 
otherwise order, shall be defaulted and judgment shall enter 
in accordance with the provisions of Section 24-24, unless 
such defendant shall, personally or by representative, not 
later than the answer date, file an answer or file a motion to 
transfer pursuant to Section 24-21. The answer should state 
fully and specifically, but in concise and untechnical form, 
such parts of the claim as are contested, and the grounds 
thereof, provided that an answer of general denial shall be 
sufficient for purposes of this section. Each defendant shall 
send a copy of the answer to each plaintiff and shall certify 
on the answer form that the defendant has done so, 
including the address(es) to which a copy has been mailed. 
Upon the filing of an answer, the clerk shall set the matter 
down for hearing by the judicial authority.” 

  § 24-24. “(a) In any action based on an express or implied 
promise to pay a definite sum and claiming only liquidated 
damages, which may include interest and reasonable 
attorney’s fees, if the defendant has not filed an answer by 
the answer date and the judicial authority has not required 
that a hearing be held concerning any request by the 
defendant for more time to pay, the judicial authority may 
render judgment in favor of the plaintiff without requiring 
the presence of the plaintiff or representative before the 
court, provided the plaintiff has complied with the provisions 
of this section and Section 24-8. Nothing contained in this 
section shall prevent the judicial authority from requiring 
the presence of the plaintiff or representative before the 
court prior to rendering any such default and judgment if it 
appears to the judicial authority that additional information 
or evidence is required prior to the entry of judgment. 

(b) In order for the judicial authority to render any 
judgment pursuant to this section at the time set for 
entering a judgment whether by default, stipulation or other 
method, the following affidavits must have been filed by the 
plaintiff. . .”

•  Veterans Memorial Medical Center v. Townsend, 49 Conn. 

App. 198, 202-203, 712 A.2d 993, 995-996 (1998). “Small 
claims proceedings are governed by Practice Book § 547 et 
seq., now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) § 24–1 et seq. These 
rules establish a procedure in the event that the defendant 
does not file an answer by the answer date, as occurred in 
the present case. Pursuant to these rules, a defendant shall 
be defaulted unless he answers the small claims complaint 
by the answer date . . . 

Therefore, under § 24–24, the trial court could have 
rendered judgment for the plaintiff because the defendant 
did not answer by the answer date or, if it appeared to the 
trial court that additional information or evidence was 
required, it should have held a hearing prior to rendering 
judgment.”

party suffering from a default judgment may bring a writ of 
error where no statutory right of appeal exists. We reach 
this conclusion relying upon our test, now well established, 
for determining when a party is aggrieved: ‘The 
fundamental test for determining aggrievement 
encompasses a well-settled twofold determination: first, 
“the party claiming aggrievement must successfully 
demonstrate a specific personal and legal interest in the 
subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a 
general interest, such as is the concern of all members of 
the community as a whole. Second, the party claiming 
aggrievement must successfully establish that this specific 
personal and legal interest has been specially and 
injuriously affected by the decision.” . . .’ (Citations

The court will next consider whether the defendants have met 
their burden of showing reasonable cause for granting the 
motion to open. As stated earlier, ‘[t]he power of a court to set 
aside a default judgment is governed by § 52–212(a). Section 
52–212 requires a party moving for the opening of a judgment 
to make a two part showing that: (1) a good defense existed at 
the time an adverse judgment was rendered; and (2) the 
defense was not at that time raised by reason of mistake, 
accident or other reasonable cause.’ (Internal quotation marks 
omitted.) Tsitaridis v. Tsitaridis, 100 Conn. App. 115, 119, 916 
A.2d 877 (2007) . . . The defendants assert that they had a 
defense of comparative negligence; the plaintiffs do not dispute 
this, but rather focus on whether there was a reasonable cause 
for the defendants’ failure to cure the default. The plaintiffs also 
extensively discuss the discovery history in this case, claiming 
that the defendants’ frequent delays in producing evidence and 
witnesses for depositions justify the court denying the motion to 
open.” 
 

The defendants question the validity of the service of the 
motion for default and motion for judgment by citing Practice 
Book §§ 10-12 through 10-14 and Triton Assocs. v. Six New 
Corp., 14 Conn. App. 172, 178, 540 A.2d 95 (1988). Practice 
Book § 10-12(b) provides that a motion for default for failure to 
appear be served upon the pro se party. The defendants 
incorrectly cite Triton Associates v. Six New Corp., 14 Conn. 
App. 172, 540 A.2d 95 cert. denied 208 Conn. 806, 545 A.2d 
1104 (1988) for the proposition that a motion for default for 
failure to appear must be served upon a party's agent for 
service of process. Triton, holds that a notice of entry of default 
and a motion for judgment were properly served on a non-
appearing party's agent for service; it does not hold that a 
motion for default must be so served on the agent rather than 
the party. In a subsequent case, the Appellate Court explained 
that its holding in Triton was based on the fact that the 
defendant in Triton had actual notice of both the entry of default 
and motion for judgment even though the pleadings had not 
been sent directly to them. Wilson v. Troxler, 91 Conn. App. 
864, 872-73, 883 A.2d 18 (2005). In that case the court 
distinguished between service of process initiating an action and 
service of pleadings after a case has been initiated. . .”

default under this section.’ The plaintiffs claim, having been 
filed only four days after the granting of his request for a 
default, was thus filed too early. The same Practice Book 
section also provides that ‘[i]f a claim for a hearing in damages 
or a motion for a judgment has been filed the default may be 
set aside only by the judicial authority.’ Practice Book § 17-32 
(b). Construing these two provisions together, it would appear 
that a defendant’s remedy when, as here, a claim for a hearing 
in damages is filed too early is to move to set aside the default 
under Practice Book § 17-42. This section provides that ‘[a] 
motion to set aside a default where no judgment has been 
rendered may be granted by the judicial authority for good 
cause shown upon such terms as it may impose.’ Certainly the 
plaintiff’s premature filing of a claim for a hearing in damages 
may constitute the ‘good cause’ that would justify setting aside 
the default under this section. Because, in this case, the 
defendant failed to file a motion to set aside the default, the 
court will not relieve him of his default for failure to plead.” 
 

Concerning the determination as to whether to open a default, 
rule of practice § 17-42 states: ‘[a] motion to set aside a default 
may be granted by the judicial authority for good cause shown 
upon such terms as it may impose.’ The court, in its discretion, 
may consider the presence of mistake, inadvertence, misfortune 
or other reasonable cause. See Higgins v. Karp, 243 Conn. 495, 
508, 706 A.2d 1 (1998) (previously cited by the court in its 
November 3, 2000 order). It may consider ‘factors such as the 
seriousness of the default, its duration, the reasons for it and 
the degree of contumacy involved . . . [as well as] the totality of 
the circumstances, including whether the delay has caused 
prejudice to the nondefaulting party.’ (Internal quotation marks 
and citation omitted.) Id. 

s noted, except for its procedural arguments, which the court 

addressed above, and its advancement of what it claims are 
meritorious defenses, which the court addresses below, Seraya 
has advanced no argument explaining why the defaults should 
be vacated. It has not even contended, for example, that the 
November, 1997 default was the result of mistake, 
inadvertence, misfortune or other reasonable cause. Instead, it 
has chosen to act as though that court action, taken over three 
years ago, did not exist. It has done so in the face of being put 
on notice of it again, by the court, on the record, on September 
18, 2000. Deercliff also pleaded the existence of this default in 
its objection to the September, 2000 motion to open the April. 
2000 default for failure to plead.”

pleaded. The limit of its effect is to preclude the defaulted 
defendant from making any further defense and to permit 
the entry of a judgment against him on the theory that 
he has admitted such of the facts alleged in the complaint 
as are essential to such a judgment. It does not follow 
that the plaintiff is entitled to a judgment for the full

how much of the judgment prayed for in the complaint he 
is entitled to receive.’ (Internal quotation marks omitted

damages) without first having obtained a default for 
failure to plead. Wooding v. Zasciurinskas, 14 Conn. App.

cannot be conducted unless there has been compliance

party of a right to which there is entitlement under the
