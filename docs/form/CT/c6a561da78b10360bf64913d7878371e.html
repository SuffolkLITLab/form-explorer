Issue  Focused 
Evaluation  process  is  essential.    It  is  very 
important  that  a  commitment  be  made  to 
cooperate  with  the  Family  Services  in  the 
following ways:

1.  Keep scheduled appointments and arrive 
on time for all meetings.

2. Do not bring your children to appointments 
that are scheduled for you.

3.  Fill  out  the  Issue  Focused  Evaluation 
Questionnaire  completely  and  accurately 
before  the  first  appointment  and  bring  it 
with you to the first appointment.

4.  Sign  the  necessary  Authorization  for 
Release of Information forms and bring all 
requested information to appointments.

5.  Make  the  children  available,  both  at 
home and at the Family Services Office, if 
requested by the FRC.

6. If your children are going to be interviewed, 
explain to them that the FRC wants to meet 
them, but let them know that they will not be 
asked to choose between their parents.

For additional information, contact your local 
Court Support Services Division - Family 
Services Office.  Contact information is available 
at the Superior Court – Court Service Center.

Issue Focused 
Evaluation

JDP-FM-214, New 9/10

Introduction

Raising  children  is  not  easy.  However, 
caring  for  children  when  parents  are  no 
longer together can be even more difficult.  
Although parents may try to work out their 
differences  regarding  the  care  of  their 
children, visitation schedules, or parenting 
responsibilities, this is not always possible.  
In some instances, the Court’s involvement 
is needed to help make the final decisions.  
Family  Services  offers  the  Issue  Focused 
Evaluation  (IFE)  as  a  way  of  helping 
parents solve a specific concern through an 
evaluation  that  limits  the  extent  and  time 
the family is involved in the process.

For  many  parents,  the  evaluation  process 
becomes  a  learning  experience  that  helps 
them  settle  their  differences  without  the 
need for a court hearing.  This resolution also 
works towards the development of a healthy 
parenting  arrangement  that  contributes  to 
the positive growth and development of the 
children.

What to Expect

To take part in an Issue Focused Evaluation 
you must be referred from the Family Court.  
The  Judge  will  enter  an  order  defining 
the  concern  that  will  be  evaluated  and/
or  the  limits  of  what  will  be  dealt  with  in 
the  process.    Because  the  the  evaluation  is 

limited, our involvement in the matter will be 
brief.  
Shortly  after  the  court  referral,  the  case  will 
be assigned to a Family Relations Counselor 
(FRC).   A  letter  from  the  FRC  will  be  sent 
scheduling  the  first  appointment.    In  most 
cases, the first meeting is held with the parents 
together.  This gives both parents a chance to 
share  their  concerns  and  proposals  with  the 
FRC  and  each  other.    NOTE:    If  you  have 
safety  concerns  about  meeting  with  your 
child’s other parent, you should contact your 
FRC when you get the appointment letter to 
talk about those concerns.

The FRC’s role in this process is to explore and 
assess the concerns of each parent and to make 
recommendations about a parenting plan that 
will benefit the children.  To do this, the FRC 
will  gather  information  from  both  parents 
and  contact  professionals  involved  with  the 
family  (such  as  teachers,  doctors,  therapists, 
and others)  The IFE is not confidential, which 
means  that  this  information  will  be  shared 
with the parents, the attorneys, and Guardians 
Ad Litem (GAL) involved in the matter, and 
the Court. 

So that information can be shared between the 
professional  providers  and  Family  Services, 
Authorization  for  Release  of  Information 
forms  must  be  signed.    If  either  party  has 
copies  of  records/reports  they  may  also 
submitted to the FRC.  However, the person 
who wrote the record/report must be available 

to  the  FRC  during  the  evaluation  process 
to answer any questions the FRC may have 
about the report/record.

schedule 

additional 

During the course of the IFE, the counselor 
may 
individual 
appointments  with  one  or  both  of  the 
parents.  Arrangements may also be made to 
meet with the children at one or both of the 
parents’  homes  and/or  the  Family  Services 
Office.  This part of the evaluation process 
will  be  decided  by  the  FRC  based  on  the 
issue that was referred.

At  the  time  the  counselor’s  work  in  the 
IFE in done, a final conference will be held 
with the parents and the attorneys/GALs in 
the  case.    When  it  is  not  possible  to  meet 
together, other arrangements will be made.

The  final  conference  is  when  the  FRC  will 
share  relevant  information  gathered  during 
the  IFE,  present  an  assessment  of  the 
referred issue, and provide a recommended 
plan to resolve the matter.  A written report 
summarizing  the  information  shared  in  the 
final  conference  will  also  be  handed  out  in 
this meeting and given to the Court. 

If this information and report does not help 
the parents come to an agreement, the matter 
will most likely go to trial.  At that time, the 
FRC’s  recommendations  and  report  may 
be used as evidence and the counselor may 
testify.
