Tips for Success

Your involvement and cooperation 
throughout the ICM service is 
necessary. It is very important that 
you work with your Family Relations 
Counselor in the following ways:

1.  Keep scheduled appointments and 
arrive on time for all meetings.  

2.  Make sure you complete the  
on-line Skills for Cooperative 
Parenting program as soon as  
you can and attend all additional 
agreed upon supportive services.

3.  Stay open to suggestions and ideas 
that are different from your own.  

4.  Be open to doing things differently

5.  Be respectful of each other as well 
as all professionals with whom you 
may be working.

Introduction

The Intensive Case Management (ICM) 
service is a post-judgment service to help 
divorced, or never-married parents who do 
not live together, learn how to make their 
court-ordered parenting plans work. The 
focus of this service is to teach parents the 
skills they need to help them reach more 
lasting parenting agreements. This will 
happen by learning better ways to talk to 
each other and work together. When this 
happens the parents will be better able to 
solve their own differences and lessen the 
need to return to court.

Likely outcomes:

•   stronger co-parenting skills 

•   stable and long-lasting  

parenting plans

•   less court involvement

•   parents being able to solve their  

own differences

•   children exposed to less conflict

How it Works

The ICM service is provided by the Judicial 
Branch – Court Support Services Division – 
Family Services Office; your participation is 
voluntary. To become involved in the ICM 
service there must be a current post-judgment 
motion before the court about an existing 

parenting access schedule. Family Services will 
conduct a screen to see if your case is appropriate 
for this service. If it is, both parents will be asked 
if they want to participate. If both parents do, the 
court will order the referral to the ICM service. 
Once referred, the parents will be assigned to a 
Family Relations Counselor (FRC) who will work 
with them and manage their conflicts throughout 
the process. The service provided by the FRC is 
free of charge.

The FRC will work closely with parents to try to 
improve the way they act towards each other. The 
role of the FRC is to:

•   provide help and education about how to  

co-parent in a positive way

•   help parents learn new ways to problem solve 

with each other

•   help parents to understand that what they say  
and do impacts how the other parent will act 
towards them

•   encourage team work between the parents

What You Can Expect

Parents are involved in the ICM service for up to 
six months. During this time, you will be asked 
not to file any new Court motions regarding your 
parenting plan without first trying to resolve the 
conflict with your FRC. 

During the course of the ICM service, you 
and your child’s other parent will have at least 
two office visits with the Family Relations 
Counselor. Other office visits will be scheduled 
as needed. Most of your contact with your FRC 
will be over the phone during business hours.

Parents will also have to complete the on-line 
Skills for Cooperative Parenting program. This 
is a five session educational program that will 
teach new skills to help you better manage your 
communication with the child’s other parent. 
Your FRC will remind you of these new skills as 
they continue their work with you. The Skills for 
Cooperative Parenting has a cost per parent that 
is paid directly to the on-line provider. If you 
cannot afford to pay for the program you should 
contact the provider to discuss this concern. All 
decisions regarding the program cost will be 
up to the provider. There is also an opportunity 
for the parents to voluntarily sign-up for 
additional on-line sessions. Some community-
based contracted supportive resources are also 
available that your FRC may ask you to attend 
if they think you could benefit from them. These 
resources will have either no or low cost. 

Finally, there will be two scheduled court dates 
when you and your FRC will meet with a Judge. 
The purpose of these meetings is to let the court 
know about the progress you are making and 
to enter any parenting plan agreements you and 
your child’s other parent reach as court orders.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
