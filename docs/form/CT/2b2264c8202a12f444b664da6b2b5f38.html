      <pre>INTRODUCTION

One  of  the  manifestations  of  linguistic  diversity 
in  the  United  States  is  the  frequent  use  of 
interpreters  in  the  court  system.  In  2008,  there 
were 95,991 events for Spanish required interpreter 
services.  Most  states,  some  more  than  others, 
are experiencing the effects of the ever-growing 
population that is limited in its English proficiency 
(LEPs). Although government agencies have long 
used interpreters, the importance of professional 
interpreters in the court system has only recently 
been recognized.

How Do Self-Represented (Pro Se) Parties Request 
Interpreting and Translating Services? A person 
who is not represented by an attorney and who 
needs interpreting and translating services should 
be  directed  to  the  Clerk’s  Office,  Court  Service 
Center, or other Judicial Branch staff member to 
request interpreting and translating services for 
a court hearing.

INTERPRETER AND  
TRANSLATOR SERVICES (continued)
It is the firm belief of the Judicial Branch that in order 
to protect the rights of the fast-growing LEP speaking 
population in Connecticut, and the integrity of court 
proceedings, language services should be fortified and 
brought to a professional level whenever possible.

As evidence of the Judicial Branch’s commitment 
to this issue, the Branch joined the National Center 
for State Courts Consortium (NCSC) for State Court 
Interpreter Certification in 2001.

Under the auspices of the NCSC, the primary focus 
of  the  Consortium  is  to  provide  comprehensive, 
statewide mechanisms for ensuring that interpreters 
possess the appropriate minimum skills required for 
interpreting in a legal setting.

Without  those  standards,  equal  access  to  justice 
by a LEP remains an unfulfilled obligation of the 
American system of justice.

INTERPRETER AND  
TRANSLATOR SERVICES

ROLE & FUNCTION  
OF THE INTERPRETER

Interpreter  and  Translator  Services  is  a  unit 
of  the  Superior  Court  Operations  Division.  It 
was  established  to  serve  the  judiciary  in  court-
related  proceedings  at  no  cost  to  the  parties. 
Interpreters are provided for defendants, victims, 
witnesses, and family members in criminal cases. 
Fundamental fairness in court proceedings requires 
that every participant be able to understand and 
communicate  effectively.  A  paramount  concern 
of  Judges,  attorneys,  and  citizens  taking  part  in 
legal actions should be that no person be denied 
this  ability  by  reason  of  impairment.  Skilled 
interpretation by court interpreters enables courts 
to accurately gather all the facts in order to arrive 
at the truth in reaching informed decisions. State 
and federal court opinions, such as United States 
ex. rel. Negrón v. State of New York, 434 F.2d 386 
(2d  Cir.1970);  cf.  28  U.S.C.§  1827  (1988  –  Court 
Interpreters’ Act), established that the right to an 
interpreter is protected under the Constitution.

The Judicial Branch of the State of Connecticut 
believes  that  competent  language  service  is  a 
crucial component of 21st century justice.

The  interpreter’s  function  is  to  ensure  that 
every  participant  in  a  judicial  process  is  able 
to  communicate  effectively  whenever  the  case 
involves a LEP.

It  is  the  interpreter’s  role  to  put  the  LEP  on  the 
same footing as any English speaker who comes 
before the court.
  
Briefly  stated,  the  interpreter’s  job  is  to  interpret 
everything that the defendant, Judge, attorneys, and 
others present in court would hear if no language 
barrier  existed.  Qualified  court  interpreters  are 
highly  skilled  language  specialists  who  perform 
simultaneous, consecutive, and sight interpretations. 
Interpreters  render  the  meaning  of  the  speaker’s 
words into the language of the listener. 

Interpreters  are  never  the  authors  of  the  speech; 
however, they must grasp the meaning and style 
of discourse rapidly, find an equivalent in the other 
language, and be able to articulate it accurately.

 

 

 

ELEMENTS NEEDED FOR  
EFFECTIVE INTERPRETATION

Professional  interpreter  organizations  and 
language experts have identified the following 
elements needed for effective interpretation:

	 High standards of professionalism and ethics.
	 Comprehensive knowledge of the source  
  and target language.
	 Ability to listen, comprehend, and discern 
  the message conveyed in the source language.
	 Ability to grasp and maintain communication  
 
logic and distinguish between primary and  
  secondary points.
	 Technical ability for short-term memory,  
  simultaneous listening, and note taking.
	 Extensive vocabulary, specialized termino- 
 
logy, and general knowledge of many   
  subject areas.
	 Message production, good diction, and  
  pronunciation.
	 Knowledge of and familiarity with various  
  dialects, colloquialisms, regionalisms, and
  cultural differences.
	 Ability to preserve language register, formal 
  to formal and informal to informal, for a  
  variety of speakers with diverse educational  
  backgrounds.
	 Knowledge of idiomatic expressions in  
  both languages.

MODES OF INTERPRETATION

Simultaneous:  Simultaneous  interpretation  is  the 
technique used to render everything said in the 
source  language  into  the  target  language  as  it 
is spoken. It is performed within seconds of the 
original speech. The simultaneous mode is used 
by interpreters when interpreting proceedings in 
the courtroom for LEP defendants and witnesses. 
Simultaneous  interpretation  requires  that 
interpreters listen and speak almost concurrently 
with the primary speaker whose words are being 
translated. In effect, interpreters are performing 
two tasks simultaneously in the field of language 
communication  that  otherwise  are  always 
practiced separately: speech and understanding.

It  is  important  to  note  that  interpreters  are  not 
performing  a  word-for-word  interpretation, 
but  rather  are  transferring  thoughts  and  ideas 
accurately  and  completely  from  a  source  to  a 
target language. As a consequence, there is a time 
lag that may vary from a fraction of a second to a 
few seconds. Concentrated listening is crucial for 
an exact rendering of the original message. Thus, it 
is important to have adequate listening conditions, 
acoustics, use of microphones by the speakers and 
availability of appropriate equipment.

Consecutive:  Consecutive  interpretation  is 
the  “question-and-answer”  mode  in  which 
the  speaker  completes  a  statement  and  the 
interpreter begins to interpret after the statement 
is completed. The consecutive mode is utilized 
with  witnesses  on  the  stand.  Traditionally, 
consecutive  interpreting  is  divided  into  long 
and  short  versions.  While  the  long  method  is 
generally reserved for some forms of conference 
interpreting, in the legal setting, the short method 
is preferred because it emphasizes the verbatim 
rendition required in legal proceedings. In short, 
consecutive  interpretation  is  a  mode  by  which 
interpreters relay a message in the target language 
in a sequential manner after the speaker.

MODES OF INTERPRETATION
(continued) This mode requires that the primary 
speaker pause at intervals, not in mid-sentence, 
to allow the interpreter to convey the utterances. 
It  is  used  for  testimony  in  trials,  depositions, 
sentencings,  and  other  legal  proceedings. 
For  instance,  when  a  LEP  witness  testifies, 
the  interpreter,  who  is  located  next  to  the 
witness,  interprets  questions  from  English  for 
the  witness.  After  the  witness  answers,  the 
interpreter  renders  the  English  interpretation 
of  the  response  for  the  benefit  of  all  English-
speaking  individuals  in  the  courtroom.  It  is 
the  interpreter’s  rendition  in  English  and  not 
the  witness’  source  language  utterance  that 
constitutes the official court record.

Sight:  Sight  interpretation  is  a  mode  of 
interpreting in which the interpreter is provided  
with a written document in the source language. 
The interpreter must take sufficient time to read 
and  review  the  document  before  rendering  it 
aloud  in  the  target  language,  while  reading  it 
silently in the source language.

LANGUAGES

Interpreter and Translator Services of the State of 
Connecticut Judicial Branch maintains a staff of 
34 full-time Spanish court interpreters, as well as 
over 21 temporary hourly court interpreters for 
languages such as Polish, Spanish, Portuguese 
and many others.

LANGUAGE SKILLS

A  common  misconception  is  the  belief 
that  a  person  who  knows  two  languages 
can  interpret  by  virtue  of  being  bilingual. 
Interpreters must be bi-cultural and possess a 
mastery  of  both  source  and  target  languages, 
as  well  as  the  technical  ability  to  interpret.

CODE OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY  
FOR COURT INTERPRETERS IN CONNECTICUT

Court interpreters are appointed to serve the court. This is the Code of Professional Responsibility 
for Court Interpreters that Court Interpreters in Connecticut are required to follow:

 

Canon  1.  Court  interpreters  shall  act  strictly  in  the

Canon 2. Court interpreters shall reflect proper court 
decorum and behave with dignity and respect toward 
the court officers and personnel.

Canon 3. Court interpreters shall avoid professional or 
personal conduct that could discredit the court.

Canon  4.  Court  interpreters  shall  not  disclose  any 
information of a confidential nature about court cases 
obtained while performing interpreting duties.

Canon 5. Court interpreters shall respect the restraints 
imposed upon them by the need for confidentiality and 
secrecy as protected under applicable state and federal 
law. Interpreters shall disclose to the court and parties 
any prior involvement with a case or involvement with 
parties or others significantly involved in a case.

Canon 9. Court interpreters shall refrain from giving 
advice  of  any  kind  to  any  party  or  individual 
concerning court procedures and legal matters, and 
shall  not  express  personal  opinions  concerning  any 
matter before the court.

Canon 10. Court interpreters shall perform to the best 
of their ability to assure due process for the parties, 
accurately state their professional qualifications, and 
refuse any assignment for which they are not qualified 
or  assignments  in  which  conditions  substantially 
impair their effectiveness.

Canon  11.  Court  interpreters  shall  accept  no 
remuneration, gifts, gratuities, or valuable consideration 
in  excess  of  their  authorized  compensation  in  the 
performance  of  their  official  interpreting  duties.

the appearance thereof.

Canon 8. Court interpreters shall maintain impartiality 
by avoiding undue contact with witnesses, attorneys, 
defendants  and  their  families,  and  by  avoiding  any 
contact with jurors. This should not limit, however, 
those  appropriate  contacts  necessary  to  prepare 
adequately for their assignment.

Canon 13. Court interpreters shall support other court 
interpreters by sharing knowledge and expertise with 
them  to  the  extent  practicable  in  the  interest  of  the
