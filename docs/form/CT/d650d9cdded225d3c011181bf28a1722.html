To the Governor, General Assembly and the Residents of the State of Connecticut:

I am pleased to present to you this Biennial Report on the Connecticut Judicial Branch for the 
years 2014-2016. We have titled this edition Committed to Public Service Excellence and have 
included photos of our dedicated employees, who every day help members of the public navigate 
our state courts. 

Our judges and employees are on the front line as we continue to seek innovative and 
cost-effective ways of improving how we do business. One of our top priorities has 
been the re-engineering of how we handle civil cases, and we recently opened two 
mediation centers, one in Hartford and the other one in Waterbury. Recognizing 
that well over 90 percent of all civil cases settle before trial, we believe that it is 
imperative to offer effective alternative dispute resolution options that are cost-free 
to the parties, especially since the ultimate beneficiaries are the litigants seeking a 
resolution to their case. 

The Judicial Branch’s ongoing effort to improve the family court process also occurred 

during this biennium and has resulted in many significant changes. For example, the process of 
obtaining a divorce has been simplified for parties who meet certain criteria. In another area, we 
made significant improvements regarding the appointments of guardians ad litem and attorneys 
for the minor child. Additional changes will be noted in other sections of this biennial, and I 
am grateful to all of the individuals who have worked so hard to make both our civil and family 
processes better for those involved. 

Year after year, our outstanding employees and judges rise to meet whatever challenge is ahead, 
and the entire state benefits from their commitment to public service excellence. We look forward 
to working with both the Legislative and Executive Branches as we move forward.

Very truly yours,

Chase T. Rogers 
Chief Justice

To the Governor, General Assembly and the Residents of the State of Connecticut: 

Under the leadership of Chief Justice Chase T. Rogers, the Judicial Branch continues to reshape 
the Judicial Branch so that it best meets the needs of the public in the 21st century. This task has 
become more difficult with the budgetary crises we have faced and continue to face. We have lost 
hundreds of dedicated employees through layoffs, retirements and other attrition. The Branch has 
also closed two courthouses and severely curtailed the hours of its law libraries throughout  
the state. 

Nevertheless, we cannot retreat from our constitutional obligations. Our long-term 
strategic plan has served as an invaluable foundation as we seek ways to enhance 
access to justice. We have implemented hundreds of initiatives that have made a 
positive difference. Of special interest over the biennium has been the continued 
re-engineering of our civil and family dockets with particular emphasis on 
streamlining the process for parties.

Regarding civil re-engineering, I noted in my previous biennial letter that we had 
implemented individual calendaring in three locations. I’m pleased to report that individual 
calendaring has since been rolled out to all of our judicial districts. Our hope is that this process 
will provide consistency and predictability and that it will also reduce the cost of litigation. 
Currently, we are evaluating the program to assess its impact and to get feedback from counsel, 
self-represented parties and litigants. 

Additionally, we are piloting individual calendaring in the Norwich Family Court, with the same 
goals of enhanced predictability and consistency and less cost to the parties. Under the pilot, each 
case on the regular family docket (excluding restraining orders unless specifically assigned to a 
judge) is assigned to a particular judge who will take responsibility for the case up to the time 
of trial and including pretrial. If a case does not settle before trial, the case will be assigned at 
the time of trial to another judge who will assume responsibility for that case from the time trial 
commences, through any post-judgment proceedings. It is contemplated that other family court 
locations, perhaps with slight variations in the model, will pilot individual calendaring in the  
near future. 

We are excited about the initiatives I’ve highlighted and many others. We are also grateful to our 
judges and staff for their diligence in making these programs work. In closing, I can assure you 
that our efforts to improve the court system will continue, as we remain guided by our mission to 
resolve disputes in a fair, timely, efficient and open manner. 

Very truly yours,

Judge Patrick L. Carroll III
Chief Court Administrator

SUPREME COURT

Front L-R: Justice Richard N. Palmer, Chief Justice Chase T. Rogers, Justice Peter T. Zarella

Back L-R: Justice Carmen E. Espinosa, Justice Andrew J. McDonald, Justice Dennis G. Eveleigh, Justice Richard A. Robinson, Senior Justice Christine S. Vertefeuille 

The Supreme Court is the state’s highest court. It 

consists of the chief justice, six associate justices 
and one senior justice. 

The Supreme Court reviews rulings made in the Appellate 
and Superior Courts to determine if any errors have 
occurred. The court sits en banc – in panels of seven – in 
cases in which there are no disqualifications. 

The Supreme Court goes “on circuit” annually and 
schedules actual arguments at a school, where students 
get a first-hand look at how an appellate level court works. 

The sessions are held in the same way as they would be 
held in the Supreme Court’s courtroom. Educators and 
students are supplied with advance materials, including 
the briefs filed. After the arguments, informational talks 
are held for the students with the counsel who argued  
the cases. 

Over the biennium, the court visited Fairfield Warde 
High School in October 2014 and the University of 
Connecticut School of Law in October 2015.

NOTEWORTHY CASES HEARD BY   
THE SUPREME COURT DURING THE BIENNIUM

Dan v. Dan, 315 Conn. 1 (2014).

The issue raised in this appeal 
was whether the trial court may 
modify a judgment rendered 
in accordance with a stipulated 
alimony award solely on the basis 

of an increase in the income of 
the supporting spouse. In a majority 

opinion authored by Justice Zarella, the court 

observed that the primary purposes of alimony awards 
are either to maintain the supported spouse’s standard of 
living at the level he or she enjoyed during the marriage 
or to provide temporary support in order to allow the 
supported spouse to become self-sufficient. The court 
concluded that, when the sole change in circumstances is 
an increase in the income of the supporting spouse, and 
when the initial award was and continues to be sufficient 
to fulfill its intended purpose, the supported spouse is not 
entitled to a modification of the award based solely on the 
supporting spouse’s increased income. When the initial 
award was not sufficient to fulfill its underlying purpose, 
however, an increase in the supporting spouse’s salary, in 
and of itself, may justify an increase in the award.

State v. Riley, 315 Conn. 637 (2015).

In Miller v. Alabama, __ U.S. __, 132 S. Ct. 2455, 183 
L. Ed. 2d 407 (2012), the United States Supreme Court 
held that mandatory sentencing schemes that impose 
a term of life imprisonment without parole on juvenile 
homicide offenders, thus precluding consideration of 
the offender’s youth as a mitigating factor, violate the 
eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual 
punishment. The defendant in this case was convicted 
of murder and attempted murder and was sentenced 
to 100 years imprisonment, the effective equivalent of 
life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The 
defendant appealed to the Appellate Court claiming 
that Connecticut’s sentencing scheme was in violation 
of Miller even though it was discretionary because it 
does not require the sentencing court to consider the 
defendant’s age. That court determined that, because 
Miller requires only that a defendant be afforded the 
opportunity to present mitigating evidence relating 

to his age and that the court be permitted to impose a 
lesser sentence than life imprisonment without parole, 
Connecticut’s discretionary sentencing scheme was 
constitutional. On appeal to this court, a majority of 
the court, in an opinion authored by Justice McDonald, 
concluded that Miller did not hold only that sentencing 
schemes that mandate life imprisonment for juveniles 
are unconstitutional, but also held that, if the sentencing 
scheme is discretionary, the sentencing court is required 
to consider the defendant’s age and the hallmark features 
of that age. Because Connecticut’s sentencing scheme 
did not impose such a requirement, and because there 
was no evidence that the sentencing court in fact 
adequately considered the defendant’s age, the court 
concluded that the defendant’s sentencing proceeding was 
unconstitutional and he was entitled to a new proceeding 
that conformed to the dictates of Miller. Justice Espinosa 
authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Zarella 
joined, arguing that, because the sentencing court 
is free to consider a juvenile defendant’s age under a 
discretionary scheme, such schemes do not violate the 
eighth amendment.

State v. Menditto, 315 Conn. 861 (2015).

In 2011, the legislature changed the penalty for possessing 
less than one-half ounce of marijuana from a potential 
term of imprisonment and/or a large fine to a fine of 
$150 for a first offense and a fine of between $200 and 
$500 for subsequent offenses. Pursuant to another 
Connecticut statute, when any person has been convicted 
of an offense that was subsequently decriminalized, the 
convicted person may petition the Superior Court for 
an order directing that all public records pertaining to 
the conviction be destroyed. The issue in this case was 
whether the 2015 change in the penalty for possession 
of less than one-half ounce of marijuana constituted 
a decriminalization of the offense for purposes of 
the erasure statute. In an opinion authored by Justice 
Espinosa, the court concluded that, for purposes of 
the erasure statute, the word “decriminalize” is not 
synonymous with the word “legalize,” but means the 
replacement of criminal sanctions by civil fines. The 
court further concluded that the 2015 change in the 

6   |   BIENNIAL REPORT

NOTEWORTHY CASES HEARD BY   
THE SUPREME COURT DURING THE BIENNIUM

punishment for possession of less than one-half ounce of 
marijuana changed the status of the offense from a crime 
to a minor civil violation, which is not the type of conduct 
to which society attaches substantial moral opprobrium 
or that society takes into account when making important 
decisions, such as hiring employees. Accordingly, the 
court concluded that possessing less than one-half ounce 
of marijuana has been decriminalized for purposes of the 
erasure statute.

which he contended that Padilla is retroactive because 
it did not announce a new constitutional rule, but was 
merely an application of the well established standard 
governing ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Justice 
Eveleigh authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justice 
McDonald joined, arguing that the court should not 
follow federal law in determining the retroactivity of 
constitutional holdings, but should adopt a more lenient 
standard. Justice Eveleigh further contended that, under 
that standard, Padilla applies retroactively.

Thiersaint v. Commissioner of Correction, 316 Conn. 
89 (2015).

The petitioner in this case, who was a citizen of Haiti and 
a legal permanent resident of the United States, pleaded 
guilty in 2007 to possession of narcotics with intent 
to sell and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. 
Immediately upon his release from prison, the federal 
government took him into custody and commenced 
deportation/removal proceedings against him. In 2010, 
the United States Supreme Court ruled in Padilla v. 
Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 130 S. Ct. 1473, 176 L. Ed. 2d 
284 (2010), that an attorney’s failure to advise a client of 
the deportation consequences of a guilty plea constitutes 
constitutionally deficient assistance of counsel. Thereafter, 
the petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus 
claiming ineffective assistance of counsel under Padilla 
on the ground that his attorney had failed to advise him 
that his guilty plea and subsequent conviction would 
subject him to deportation. The habeas court granted 
the petition, and the respondent appealed. In an opinion 
authored by Justice Zarella, a majority of the court 
concluded that, as a matter of federal law, Padilla does 
not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review; in 
determining the retroactivity of constitutional holdings 
under state law, the court applies the same standard 
as the federal courts; and, under that standard, the 
constitutional rule that the United States Supreme Court 
adopted in Padilla was a new rule in this state and, 
therefore, the rule does not apply retroactively to cases 
on collateral review. Accordingly, the majority reversed 
the judgment of the habeas court and directed that court 
to deny the petitioner’s petition for a writ of habeas 
corpus. Justice Palmer authored a dissenting opinion in 

Lapointe v. Commissioner of Correction, 316 Conn. 
225 (2015).

The petitioner in this case was convicted of capital 
felony and arson murder, among other charges, in 
connection with the killing of his wife’s grandmother. 
He subsequently filed an application for a writ of habeas 
corpus in which he claimed that his counsel in a previous 
habeas proceeding had rendered ineffective assistance by 
failing to pursue a claim that the state had not disclosed 
certain exculpatory evidence that would have allowed 
the petitioner to present expert testimony in support 
of his alibi claim if it had been timely disclosed. The 
habeas court ultimately dismissed the claim on the 
ground that it was not reasonably probable that the jury 
at the petitioner’s criminal trial would have credited the 
testimony of the petitioner’s expert witnesses. On appeal, 
the Appellate Court concluded that the defendant was 
entitled to a new trial at which the jury would decide 
how much weight to give the testimony. Accordingly, 
the Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the habeas 
court, and the respondent appealed. In an opinion 
authored by Justice Palmer, a majority of the court 
concluded that, although a reviewing court ordinarily 
accords deference to the habeas court’s credibility 
determinations, when that determination is not based 
on a witness’s demeanor, conduct on the witness stand, 
untruthfulness, bias, poor memory or substandard 
powers of observation, but is based solely on the habeas 
court’s evaluation of the foundational soundness of 
the witness’s professional opinion, the reviewing court 
is as well situated as the habeas court to assess the 
testimony, and no deference is required. The majority 

7   |   BIENNIAL REPORT

NOTEWORTHY CASES HEARD BY   
THE SUPREME COURT DURING THE BIENNIUM

further concluded that the jury reasonably could have 
credited the testimony of the petitioner’s experts, and the 
testimony was material because it undermined confidence 
in the guilty verdict. Accordingly, the majority affirmed 
the judgment of the Appellate Court. Chief Justice Rogers 
authored a concurring opinion in which she criticized 
the majority’s reliance on secondary materials postdating 
the petitioner’s criminal trial as part of its assessment of 
the strength of the state’s evidence. Chief Justice Rogers 
also emphasized that the majority’s conclusion that it 
need not defer to the habeas court’s credibility assessment 
should apply only under the narrow circumstances of 
this case. Justice Zarella authored a dissenting opinion, 
in which Justice Espinosa joined, contending that the 
court should defer to the credibility findings of the habeas 
court because it lacks constitutional authority to find 
facts. In addition, he contended that the issue of whether 
the court should defer to the habeas court’s credibility 
determinations was unreviewable because it had not been 
raised by the parties. Justice Zarella further contended 
that, because the habeas court’s factual findings were 
not clearly erroneous, its judgment should be affirmed. 
Justice Espinosa authored a dissenting opinion in which 
she contended that the majority had usurped the habeas 
court’s fact-finding role, improperly raised issues sua 
sponte on appeal and acted as an advocate for  
the petitioner.

In re Yasiel R., 317 Conn. 77 (2015).

The issue in this case was whether the due process 
clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United 
States constitution requires the trial court to canvass 
a parent subject to a parental termination proceeding 
about his or her decision not to contest the evidence 
and to waive his or her right to present a case at trial. 
In an opinion authored by Justice Eveleigh, a majority 
of the court concluded that parents have an important, 
constitutionally protected interest in retaining their 
parental rights; requiring the trial court to canvass parents 
prior to terminating their rights would not substantially 
decrease the risk of an erroneous deprivation of those 

rights; and that the administrative interest in lessening the 
cost of termination proceedings and in ensuring a speedy 
and accurate resolution in order to promote the interests 
of the child weighed neither for nor against recognizing 
a right to a canvass. Balancing these considerations, the 
court concluded that constitutional due process principles 
do not require the trial court to canvass a respondent 
who is represented by counsel. The court also concluded, 
however, that public confidence in the integrity of the 
judicial system would be enhanced by a rule requiring a 
brief canvass of all parents immediately before a parental 
rights termination trial to ensure that the parents 
understand the trial process, their rights during the trial 
and the potential consequences. Accordingly, the court 
exercised its supervisory power to require such a canvass. 
Because the respondent parent in this case had not 
been canvassed, the court concluded that the judgment 
terminating her parental rights must be reversed and 
that she was entitled to a new termination proceeding. 
Justice Zarella authored a concurring and dissenting 
opinion in which he contended that the court’s exercise 
of its supervisory authority in this case was unwarranted 
and that the court should never exercise its supervisory 
authority to reverse a judgment in the absence of 
independent grounds for reversal. Rather, supervisory 
rules should have only prospective application. Justice 
Espinosa authored a concurring and dissenting opinion 
in which she contended that the court should exercise 
its supervisory authority to adopt procedural rules with 
prospective application only when the proposed rule is 
central to safeguarding the interests implicated by an 
issue of vital importance to the perceived fairness of the 
judicial system and there are no significant countervailing 
interests. She further contended that such rules should be 
applied to the case in which the rule is announced only 
when doing so is justified by exceptional circumstances. 
Applying these standards to this case, Justice Espinosa 
concluded that the new supervisory rule was unwarranted 
and, even if it were warranted, there were no exceptional 
circumstances justifying the reversal of the judgment.

NOTEWORTHY CASES HEARD BY   
THE SUPREME COURT DURING THE BIENNIUM

Doe v. Hartford Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., 317 
Conn. 357 (2015).

Tilcon Connecticut, Inc. v. Commissioner of 
Environmental Protection, 317 Conn. 628 (2015).

The plaintiff brought a civil action against the defendant, 
the Hartford Roman Catholic Diocesan Corporation, 
claiming that it had acted negligently and recklessly 
when it assigned a priest, who had previously admitted 
to molesting other boys, to serve as the priest-director 
of an elementary school in a different town, where he 
sexually abused the plaintiff from 1981 through 1983. 
The plaintiff ’s claim would have been barred by the 
statute of limitations for sexual abuse claims had the 
legislature not revived the claim when it extended the 
limitations period to thirty years from the date the 
plaintiff attained the age of majority. After a jury trial, 
the plaintiff received a verdict of more than $1 million 
in damages. The defendant appealed, claiming that the 
retroactive application of those amendments to the 
statute of limitations to revive the lapsed claim violated 
its due process rights under article first, §§ 8 and 10 of 
the Connecticut constitution. In an opinion authored 
by Justice Robinson, a majority of the court concluded 
that the retroactive application of the extended statute of 
limitations to revive the plaintiff ’s otherwise time-barred 
claims did not violate the defendant’s substantive due 
process rights under our state constitution. The court 
concluded that Connecticut’s constitutional history did 
not support the defendant’s claim that it should provide 
greater protection to the defendant than is provided 
under the United States constitution, which permits the 
revival of time-barred claims. The court also concluded 
that the legislature had a rational basis for reviving 
time-barred claims arising from sexual abuse, including 
the unique psychological and social factors that often 
result in delayed reporting of childhood sexual abuse, 
which frustrated the ability of victims to bring an action 
under earlier revisions of the statute of limitations. 
Justice Zarella authored a concurring opinion in which 
he agreed with the result, but suggested modifications to 
the framework for analyzing state constitutional claims 
announced in State v. Geisler, 222 Conn. 672, 684–85 
(1992). 

This case required the court to determine the scope of the 
authority granted to the Department of Environmental 
Protection (department) under the Connecticut Water 
Diversion Policy Act (act), General Statutes § 22a-
265 et seq. The plaintiff submitted to the department 
five applications for water diversion permits, one for 
each of its earth materials excavation and processing 
facilities. Three years later, the department requested 
comprehensive information about all of the plaintiff ’s 
excavation activities at the facilities for the twenty-five 
year duration of the permits. In response, the plaintiff 
contended that it was required to submit information 
only with regard to those portions of the properties that 
could reasonably be expected to be affected by a diversion 
of water and that it was unable to predict the extent of 
its operations twenty-five years in the future. In turn, the 
department told the plaintiff that it had jurisdiction over 
all activity at the plaintiff ’s facilities and requested still 
more information. The plaintiff then filed a petition for a 
declaratory ruling to the commissioner of the department 
seeking clarification of the scope of the department’s 
authority. The commissioner concluded that all of the 
department’s requests for information were authorized 
by the act. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed the 
ruling in part and reversed it in part, and the plaintiff 
appealed. In an opinion authored by Justice Eveleigh, 
the court concluded that the act does not empower the 
department to request information to determine the 
extent and environmental effects of diversions other than 
those for which a permit is sought; the department had 
exceeded its authority in requesting a wetlands mitigation 
plan; and that the department was not authorized to delay 
processing the plaintiff ’s National Pollutant Elimination 
System permit due to a pending water diversion permit 
application. Accordingly, the court reversed the judgment 
of the trial court and directed that court to sustain the 
plaintiff ’s appeal.

State v. Santiago, 318 Conn. 1 (2015).

After the defendant in this case was sentenced to death, 
the legislature abolished the death penalty for any crimes 
committed after the effective date of the repealing 
legislation. On appeal, the defendant claimed, among 
other things, that executing him after the prospective 
repeal would deprive him of his due process right under 
the Connecticut constitution to be free from cruel and 
unusual punishment because the death penalty no longer 
comports with contemporary standards of decency and 
no longer serves any legitimate penological purpose. 
In an opinion authored by Justice Palmer, a majority of 
the court concluded that the legislature’s prospective 
abolition of the death penalty reflected its belief that the 
death penalty no longer is an appropriate or necessary 
punishment and, therefore, it does not comport 
with this state’s contemporary standards of decency. 
The majority further concluded that, in light of the 
prospective repeal, the death penalty no longer had any 
deterrent value, nor did it serve a meaningful retributive 
purpose. Accordingly, the majority concluded that the 
death penalty is unconstitutional. Justices Norcott and 
McDonald authored a concurring opinion expressing 
their concerns about persistent allegations of racial and 
ethnic discrimination in capital charging and sentencing 
decisions. Justice Eveleigh authored a concurring opinion 
in which he contended that executing the defendant 
following the prospective repeal of the death penalty 
would violate both the due process provisions of the 
state constitution and the eighth amendment of the 
United States constitution. Chief Justice Rogers authored 
a dissenting opinion in which she contended that, in 
reaching its decision, the majority had considered issues 
that the defendant had not raised and relied on extra-
record materials that the parties had not reviewed. She 
further contended that, with respect to the issues that 
the defendant had raised, he had failed to establish that 
the death penalty was unconstitutional under either the 
state or the federal constitution. Justice Zarella authored 
a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Espinosa joined, 
contending that the majority had misapplied the law 
governing the interpretation of the state constitution and 
that, under a proper application of that law, the death 

penalty is constitutional. Justice Espinosa authored a 
separate dissenting opinion in which she contended that 
the majority decision violated constitutional separation of 
powers principles by usurping the legislature’s authority to 
determine the appropriate punishment for a crime.

Lawrence v. O and G Industries, Inc., 318 Conn. 641 
(2015).

The issue in the case was whether construction companies 
owe a duty of care to workers employed on a job site 
who suffer purely economic harm, such as lost wages, 
as a result of an accident caused by the construction 
companies’ negligence. The plaintiffs brought an action 
claiming that they were gainfully employed in various 
trades at a power plant construction site until a gas 
explosion allegedly caused by the defendants’ negligence 
resulted in the termination of their employment. The 
trial court granted the defendants’ motions to strike, 
concluding that the defendants owed the plaintiffs no 
duty of care, and the plaintiffs appealed. Justice Robinson 
authored an opinion in which the court concluded 
that, because the plaintiffs’ economic losses were a 
remote and attenuated result of the defendants’ alleged 
negligence, and because the plaintiffs had the statutory 
remedy of unemployment insurance, the parties had 
no reasonable expectation that the defendants would 
be liable for this type of injury. The court further 
concluded that recognizing such claims would cause an 
increase in litigation that would not be accompanied by 
a corresponding increase in safety, because parties like 
the defendants are already subject to extensive regulation 
and civil liability for a wide variety of claims. Finally, 
the court observed that a majority of federal and state 
courts have rejected claims like the plaintiffs’ pursuant 
to the economic loss doctrine, under which defendants 
are shielded from unlimited liability for the purely 
economic consequences of their negligent acts because 
holding them liable would subject them to losses far out 
of proportion to their culpability. Accordingly, the court 
concluded that the defendants did not owe a duty of  
care to the plaintiffs and affirmed the judgments of the 
trial court.

NOTEWORTHY CASES HEARD BY   
THE SUPREME COURT DURING THE BIENNIUM

Trusz v. UBS Realty Investors, LLC, 319 Conn.  
174 (2015).

In this case, the United States District Court for the 
District of Connecticut certified the following question 
to the court: “Does the rule announced by the United 
States Supreme Court in Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 
126 S. Ct. 1951, 164 L. Ed. 2d 689 (2006), i.e., that when 
employees make statements pursuant to their official 
duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for 
first amendment purposes, and the constitution does not 
insulate their communications from employer discipline, 
apply to a claim that an employer violated General 
Statutes § 31-51q by subjecting an employee to discipline 
or discharge on account of the exercise by such employee 
of rights guaranteed by §§ 3, 4 or 14 of article first of the 
constitution of the state?” In an opinion authored by 
Justice Palmer, a majority of the court first addressed the 
question of whether the Garcetti standard, which applies 
to claims against a public employer pursuant to the first 
amendment of the federal constitution, was the proper 
standard for such claims under the state constitution 
or, instead, the more flexible test set forth in Connick v. 
Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 103 S. Ct. 1684, 75 L. Ed. 2d 708 
(1983), and Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 
563, 88 S. Ct. 1731, 20 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1968), under which 
employee speech is protected if it involves a matter of 
public concern and the employee’s interest in speaking 
outweighs the employer’s interest in promoting an 
efficient workplace, applies. The majority concluded that 
a modified form of the Pickering/Connick balancing test, 
under which employee speech pursuant to the employee’s 
official duties is protected from discipline by a public 
employer if it concerns certain matters of significant 
public interest, applies under the state constitution. The 
majority then concluded that this standard also applies 
to claims against private employers pursuant to § 31-51q. 
Accordingly, the majority concluded that the answer to 
the certified question was “no.” Justice Zarella authored a 
concurring opinion in which he contended that § 31-51q 
does not protect any employee speech by a private sector 
employee in a private workplace. Because that claim had 
not been raised by the parties, however, Justice Zarella 
concurred in the majority opinion.

In re Gabriella A., 319 Conn. 775 (2015).

The respondent, a citizen of Jamaica, gave birth to a child, 
Gabriella A., while on a visit to Connecticut in 2011. 
Approximately six weeks later, the respondent returned 
to Jamaica, leaving Gabriella, as well as Gabriella’s ten 
year old half-sister, Erica M., in the Connecticut home of 
an acquaintance. Thereafter, the Department of Children 
and Families (department) discovered evidence that 
Gabriella was being sexually and physically abused. The 
department filed a motion for an immediate order of 
temporary custody with respect to Erica and Gabriella, 
which the trial court granted, as well as a neglect petition. 
Ultimately, the trial court adjudicated Gabriella neglected 
and committed her to the care of the department. At 
the same time, the court ordered specific steps that the 
respondent should take to regain custody of Gabriella. As 
part of its reunification plan, the department referred the 
respondent to various therapists. During therapy, it was 
revealed that the respondent had suffered severe trauma 
as a child, including sexual abuse and abandonment. In 
2013, the department filed a petition for termination of 
parental rights on behalf of Gabriella. During trial, one of 
the respondent’s therapists testified that the respondent 
may not have received the appropriate type of therapy, 
namely, trauma focused, cognitive behavioral therapy. 
The therapist also testified that the respondent’s belief 
that she did not need to change made it unlikely that she 
would benefit from any therapy. Based in large part on 
this testimony, the trial court granted the department’s 
petition for termination of parental rights, and the 
Appellate Court affirmed that judgment. On appeal 
to this court, the respondent contended that there 
was insufficient evidence to support the trial court’s 
finding that she would be unable to benefit from further 
reunification services, because her therapist testified 
that she had never received the appropriate therapeutic 
treatment. In an opinion authored by Justice Espinosa, a 
majority of the court concluded that the trial court was 
free to credit or to discredit any part of the therapist’s 
testimony, and that his testimony that the respondent 
likely would not benefit from any further therapy was 
sufficient to support the conclusion that she was unable 

11   |   BIENNIAL REPORT

NOTEWORTHY CASES HEARD BY   
THE SUPREME COURT DURING THE BIENNIUM

to benefit from further reunification services. Justice 
Robinson authored a dissenting opinion, in which Justice 
Zarella joined, contending that the department had not 
proved that it made reasonable efforts to reunify the 
respondent and Gabriella because it had not provided 
trauma therapy until one year after the respondent started 
therapy, and then sought to terminate the respondent’s 
parental rights without determining whether she had 
made progress in that therapy.

State v. Berrios, 320 Conn. 265 (2016).

In this case, the court considered the continuing vitality 
of the presumption of prejudice in jury tampering 
cases articulated by the United States Supreme Court in 
Remmer v. United States, 347 U.S. 227, 74 S. Ct. 450, 98 
L. Ed. 655 (1954). The question of whether Remmer was 
still good law in the wake of Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 
209, 102 S. Ct. 940, 71 L. Ed. 2d 78 (1982), and United 
States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 123 L. Ed. 
2d 508 (1993), had divided state and federal courts for 
more than thirty years. In an opinion authored by Justice 
Robinson, the court observed that the court in Remmer, 
which had involved a possible bribe to a juror, had held 
that, in a criminal case, any private communication, 
contact or tampering, directly or indirectly with a juror 
during trial about the matter pending before the jury 
was presumptively prejudicial and a heavy burden rested 
on the government to establish that the contact was 
harmless. In Phillips, one of the jurors had an application 
pending for a job with the office of the district attorney 
that was prosecuting the defendant. The court held in that 
case that the remedy for allegations of juror partiality is 
a hearing in which the defendant has the opportunity to 
prove actual bias. Finally, in Olano, which involved the 
presence of alternate jurors during jury deliberations, the 
court held that, although there were cases in which a jury 
intrusion should be presumed prejudicial, a presumption 
of prejudice did not change the ultimate inquiry, namely, 
whether the intrusion affected the jury’s deliberations and 
its verdict. After reviewing the federal and state cases that 
had attempted to reconcile the apparent conflict between 
these cases, the court concluded that Phillips and Olano 
were factually distinguishable from Remmer, and that 
the Remmer presumption is still good law with respect to 

external interference with the jury’s deliberative process 
via private communication, contact, or tampering with 
jurors that relates directly to the matter being tried. The 
burden is on the defendant, however, to show prima facie 
entitlement to the presumption by producing evidence of 
an improper intrusion.

Lewis v. Clarke, 320 Conn. 706 (2016).

The issue in this case was whether tribal sovereign 
immunity barred an action against an individual 
defendant who was acting within the scope of his 
employment by an Indian tribe when the claim was 
brought against the defendant in his individual capacity. 
In an opinion authored by Justice Eveleigh, the court 
observed that it is well established that the doctrine of 
tribal sovereign immunity extends to individual tribal 
officials acting in their representative capacity and 
within the scope of their authority. Although at least 
one other court had concluded that the doctrine of 
tribal sovereign immunity did not bar claims against 
individual defendants when any damages would be paid 
by the individual, not by the tribal treasury, the court 
concluded that that case was distinguishable because it 
involved claims of gross negligence, which are deemed 
to be outside the scope of employment by the tribe and, 
therefore, are not subject to sovereign immunity. Because 
there was no claim that the defendant in this case was 
acting outside the scope of his employment by the tribe, 
the court concluded that the action was barred by the 
tribal sovereign immunity.

Izzarelli v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 321 Conn. 172 
(2016).

In this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the 
Second Circuit certified the following question to the 
court: “Does the Restatement (Second), Torts, § 402A, 
comment (i), preclude a suit premised on a strict products 
liability against a cigarette manufacturer based on 
evidence that the defendant purposefully manufactured 
cigarettes to increase daily consumption without regard 
to the resultant increase in exposure to carcinogens, 
but in the absence of evidence of adulteration or 
contamination?” In an opinion authored by Justice 

12   |   BIENNIAL REPORT

NOTEWORTHY CASES HEARD BY   
THE SUPREME COURT DURING THE BIENNIUM

McDonald, a majority of the court observed that, under 
existing law, there were three standards for establishing 
strict product liability in tort: (1) the ordinary consumer 
expectation test, derived from § 402A, comment (i), of the 
Restatement, under which the product must be dangerous 
to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated 
by a consumer with the ordinary knowledge of the 
community regarding the product’s characteristics; (2) 
the multifactor risk-utility balancing test; and (3) the 
modified consumer expectation test, under which the 
jury would weigh the product’s risks and utility and then 
inquire whether a reasonable consumer would consider 
the product design unreasonably dangerous. This court 
previously had applied the first and third standards, 
without clearly explaining the circumstances in which 
each test should be applied. The majority clarified that 
the ordinary consumer expectation test is reserved 
for those few cases in which a product fails to meet a 
consumer’s legitimate, commonly accepted minimum 
safety expectations. In all other cases, including the 
present case, the modified consumer expectation test 
applies. The majority then concluded that § 402A, 
comment (i) of the Restatement did not preclude recovery 
under the modified consumer expectation test if an 
ordinary consumer would be aware of the product’s 
risks because, even if the risks would be obvious to an 
ordinary consumer, the manufacturer could be held 
liable if the risks could be reduced without significantly 
reducing the utility of the product. Accordingly, the 
majority answered the certified question in the negative. 
Justice Zarella authored a concurring opinion, joined 
by Justice Espinosa, in which he contended that, in light 
of problems with our existing design defect tests and 
subsequent developments in the law, this court should 
abandon those tests in favor of the risk-utility test from §§ 
1, 2, and 4 of the Restatement (Third), Torts.

State v. Dickson, 322 Conn. 401 (2016).

The issue raised in this case was whether a witness who 
has not successfully identified the defendant in a fair 
identification procedure prior to trial constitutionally 
may identify the defendant in court during trial. In an 
opinion authored by Chief Justice Rogers, a majority 
of the court concluded that, because first time in-court 

identifications are extremely suggestive; mistaken 
eyewitness identifications are a significant source of 
erroneous convictions; in-court identifications are 
no less the result of state action than unnecessarily 
suggestive out-of-court identifications; and the rationale 
for excluding identifications that are the result of 
unnecessarily suggestive out-of-court procedures is 
equally applicable to in-court procedures, first time 
in-court identifications deprive defendants of their 
due process right to a fair trial. Accordingly, in cases in 
which the identity of the defendant is an issue, if the state 
intends to ask a witness to identify a defendant in court, 
the state must conduct a prior, out-of-court identification 
procedure in accordance with the statutory guidelines 
for such procedures. Justice Zarella authored a dissenting 
opinion, in which Justice Espinosa joined, arguing that, 
because first time in-court identifications take place in the 
presence of the judge, jury and defense counsel and are 
subject to cross-examination, argument and cautionary 
jury instructions, the jury is capable of determining 
the reliability of such identifications. Accordingly, he 
contended that first time, in-court identifications do not 
violate due process principles. Justice Espinosa authored 
a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Zarella joined, 
arguing that the supervision of identification procedures 
and the managing of evidence should be left to the trial 
court. Justice Robinson authored a concurring opinion in 
which he contended that, because the majority ultimately 
concluded that the improper admission of the in-court 
identification was harmless, the majority should not have 
reached the merits of the defendant’s constitutional claim. 

Harrington v. Freedom of Information Commission, 
323 Conn. 1 (2016).

This case required the court to determine the 
extent to which the attorney-client privilege covers 
communications relating to both nonlegal and legal 
advice. The plaintiff filed a freedom of information 
request with the defendant, Connecticut Resources 
Recovery Authority (CRRA), seeking disclosure of 
communications between the CRRA and Thomas 
Ritter, an attorney who was employed as the defendant’s 
outreach consultant and community liaison, and 
communications between the CRRA and Peter Boucher, 

13   |   BIENNIAL REPORT

NOTEWORTHY CASES HEARD BY   
THE SUPREME COURT DURING THE BIENNIUM

an attorney who provided legal services to the CRRA. 
Ritter and Boucher were also registered lobbyists. When 
CRRA failed to promptly produce the communications, 
the plaintiff filed a complaint with the Freedom of 
Information Commission (FOIC). Thereafter, CRRA 
produced many of the requested communications, but 
withheld hundreds of others, claiming that they were 
exempt from disclosure because they were subject to 
the attorney-client privilege. A hearing officer reviewed 
the withheld documents in camera and recommended 
that the FOIC find that they were privileged. The FOIC 
accepted this recommendation and concluded that the 
documents were exempt from disclosure requirements. 
The FOIC’s decision was affirmed by the Superior Court. 
On appeal, the plaintiff claimed that the documents 
were not exempt because Ritter and Boucher were 
not consistently acting in their capacity as attorneys 
for the defendant, but were providing business and 
legislative advice and lobbying services. In an opinion 
authored by Justice McDonald, the court concluded that 
communications between an attorney and a client are 
privileged only if the primary purpose of the consultation 
is to provide legal assistance. Because the FOIC had not 
applied this standard, the court concluded that the case 
must be remanded to the FOIC for further proceedings.

Doe v. Boy Scouts of America Corp., 232 Conn. 303 
(2016).

The plaintiff in this case brought an action against the 
defendant, the Boy Scouts of America, claiming, among 
other things, that he had been sexually abused by a 
fellow member of the Boy Scouts in the mid-1970s and 
the defendant was liable for his injuries because it had 
negligently or recklessly failed to take adequate steps 
to prevent them. The defendant contended that it had 
no duty to protect the plaintiff from the intentional 
misconduct of a third party; that the plaintiff had failed to 
prove that the defendant had caused his injuries; and that 
the plaintiff ’s claim was barred either by the three year 
statute of limitations for torts or by the two year statute 
of limitations for actions for injury to persons caused 

by negligence or misconduct. The trial court concluded 
that the thirty year statute of limitations applicable to 
actions for injury to a minor caused by sexual abuse 
applied to the plaintiff ’s claim. At trial, the trial court 
denied the defendant’s request to instruct the jury that 
the defendant could not be held liable for the intentional 
misconduct of the perpetrator of the sexual abuse unless 
the jury found that the defendant’s conduct created or 
increased the risk that the plaintiff would be harmed by 
such intentional misconduct and the defendant failed 
to take appropriate precautions to protect him. Instead, 
the court gave a standard negligence instruction to the 
jury. The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff, and the 
defendant appealed. In an opinion authored by Chief 
Justice Rogers, a majority of the court concluded that 
the trial court had improperly denied the defendant’s 
requested jury instruction because it was an accurate 
statement of the governing law. Accordingly, the majority 
concluded that the judgment must be reversed. The 
majority also concluded that the plaintiff had made out a 
prima facie case under the proper standard and the case 
should, therefore, be remanded for a new trial. Finally, 
the majority concluded that the trial court properly 
concluded that the thirty year statute of limitations for 
injury to a minor caused by sexual abuse did not apply 
exclusively to actions against the perpetrator of the 
sexual abuse, but also applied to actions against persons 
whose negligent conduct legally caused the abuse. Justice 
Eveleigh authored a concurring and dissenting opinion, 
in which Justice McDonald joined, contending that the 
trial court’s improper denial of the defendant’s request 
for a jury instruction was harmless and the judgment in 
favor of the plaintiff should, therefore, be affirmed. Justice 
Zarella authored a concurring and dissenting opinion, in 
which Justices Espinosa and Robinson joined, contending 
that the thirty year statute of limitations for injury to 
a minor caused by sexual abuse applies exclusively to 
actions against the perpetrators of the abuse and the 
action against the defendant was barred by the two year 
statute of limitations applicable to actions for injury to a 
person caused by negligence.

Back, L-R: Judge Eliot D. Prescott, Judge Michael R. Sheldon, Judge Christine E. Keller, Judge Raheem L. Mullins

The Appellate Court reviews decisions of the 

Superior Court to determine if errors of law have 
occurred. There are nine Appellate Court judges, 
one of whom is designated by the chief justice to be the 
chief judge. 

Generally, three judges hear and decide a case. The court 
may, however, sit en banc, which means that the entire 
court participates in the ruling. After an appeal has been 
decided by the Appellate Court, the Supreme Court 
can certify it for further review, upon the petition of an 
aggrieved party or by the Appellate Court panel that 
decided the case, if three justices of the Supreme Court 
vote for certification.

The Appellate Court also goes “on circuit” annually and 
schedules actual arguments at a school, where students 
get a first-hand look at how an appellate level court works. 
The sessions are held in the same way as they would be 
held in the Appellate Court’s courtroom. Teachers and 
students are supplied with advance materials, including 
the briefs filed. After the arguments, informational talks 
are held for the students with the counsel who argued  
the cases. 

Over the biennium, the court visited Bridgeport’s 
Fairchild Wheeler Interdistrict Magnet School in October 
2014, the University of Connecticut School of Law in 
April 2015 and Litchfield’s Tapping Reeve Law School in 
October 2015.

Farren v. Farren, 162 Conn. App. 

51 (2015).

The plaintiff (wife) filed a 
personal injury action against 
the defendant (husband), seeking 
damages for injuries she suffered 
as a result of a brutal beating by the 
defendant. After four years of litigation, 

the defendant failed to appear on a scheduled trial date 
due to an involuntary commitment and the trial court 
entered default judgment against him. Following a jury 
trial, a verdict on the issue of damages was entered for the 
plaintiff and the defendant moved to open the judgment. 
The trial court denied the defendant’s motion. 

The defendant appealed from both the denial of his 
motion to open and the entry of default judgment. He 
claimed that the trial court erred by misunderstanding 
the law in relation to involuntary commitments under 
General Statutes § 17a-502 when it failed to conclude that 
his involuntary commitment was a reasonable cause for 
not attending trial. The defendant further claimed that 
his due process rights were violated when the trial court 
continued the personal injury trial during the pendency 
of his collateral criminal proceeding.

In an opinion consolidating the two appeals, the Appellate 
Court held that an involuntary commitment does not 
necessarily constitute reasonable cause, and that a trial 
court is not required to find reasonable cause from an 
involuntary commitment standing alone, but can consider 
surrounding circumstances such as a pattern of dilatory 
tactics. It further held that the defendant’s due process 
rights were not violated by the trial court’s refusal to 
continue the personal injury trial until the completion of 
a collateral criminal proceeding as the defendant failed 
to attend trial and was not forced to choose between his 
constitutional rights and presenting a defense in the  
civil action.

Verrillo v. Zoning Board of Appeals, 155 Conn. App. 
657 (2015).

The defendant property owners filed an application 
with the defendant Zoning Board of Appeals requesting 
variances from the regulations in order to expand an 

existing nonconforming structure. With respect to 
hardship, the application noted that the property “is 
a preexisting legal nonconforming lot, upon which is 
located a legal preexisting nonconforming residence. 
The lot is substantially undersized (1605 sq. ft. in a 
zone requiring 4000 sq. ft.), leaving very little room for 
horizontal expansion and thereby requiring vertical 
expansion to improve the property by making it 
safer, more code compliant and provide reasonable 
and adequate living and storage space, parking and 
mechanical equipment.”  Following a public hearing, 
the board unanimously voted to grant the variances. 
The plaintiff, an abutting property owner, appealed the 
board’s decision to the Superior Court, which sustained 
the appeal. The Appellate Court thereafter granted the 
defendants’ petition for certification to appeal and this 
appeal followed.

On appeal, the Appellate Court conducted a 
comprehensive review of the law governing the granting 
of variances in this state. It concluded, inter alia, that 
none of the hardship allegations asserted at the public 
hearing provided a proper basis for granting the requested 
variances to expand the nonconformity of the existing 
structure. Specifically, the Appellate Court held that the 
existence of a legally existing nonconformity cannot, 
in itself, justify the granting of variances to expand that 
nonconformity. The Appellate Court further held that 
neither the applicants’ personal desire to expand their 
existing nonconforming structure to obtain additional, 
more comfortable space nor their desire to modernize 
that structure constitute legal hardship under our law. In 
rejecting the claim that the scope of the variances sought 
was minimal, the Appellate Court noted that this was not 
a valid basis for granting a variance; it further noted that 
the administrative record did not support a finding that 
the requested variances were de minimis in scope. The 
Appellate Court held that the administrative record did 
not substantiate a finding that the hardship arose from 
an inability to comply with any fire or building codes and 
rejected the claim that the existence of an easement gave 
rise to a claim of hardship. The Appellate Court further 
concluded that the record did not substantiate the claim 
that the applicants were being completely or almost 
completely deprived of the use of the value of that land 

16   |   BIENNIAL REPORT

NOTEWORTHY CASES HEARD BY THE   
APPELLATE COURT DURING THE BIENNIUM

and, therefore, a denial of the variances did not amount 
to a practical confiscation, nor was it tantamount to 
confiscation. Although the defendants did not allege that 
application of the regulations to the property destroyed 
the value of the property for all reasonable uses, they 
argued that a more reasonable use existed – namely, 
an expanded and modernized residential structure. 
In rejecting this argument, the Appellate Court noted 
that the preference of, and convenience to, a particular 
property owner is irrelevant to the hardship question and 
that disappointment in the use of the property does not 
constitute hardship under our law. Finally, the Appellate 
Court held that the small buildable area on the property 
that resulted from the application of the regulations 
was an affliction shared by several other properties in 
the district and, therefore, was not a unique hardship 
warranting exercise of the variance power. 

State of Connecticut v. George Michael Leniart, 166 
Conn. App. 142 (2016).

The defendant drove the fifteen year old victim and 
her friend, another teenager, to a secluded area in the 
woods and sexually assaulted the victim. After dropping 
the victim’s friend off, the defendant forced the victim 
to run into the woods with him, where he killed her 
and disposed of her body in an unknown location. The 
victim’s remains have never been found. The defendant 
appealed from the judgment of conviction of murder 
and capital felony, claiming, inter alia, that the evidence 
was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that 
the victim was dead because the only evidence of her 
death was the testimony of four of the state’s witnesses 
that the defendant separately confessed to each of them 
that he had killed the victim and disposed of her body. 
Under those circumstances, the defendant argued that 
the common-law corpus delicti rule prevented him from 
being convicted of murder and capital felony solely on 
the basis of his uncorroborated confessions and in the 
absence of independent extrinsic evidence of the fact of 
the death of the alleged victim. In rejecting this claim, 
the Appellate Court, in an opinion authored by Judge 
Prescott, reviewed the purpose, history and scope of the 
corpus delicti rule in Connecticut. It then concluded that 
the corpus delicti rule is an evidentiary rule regarding the 

admissibility of confessions rather than a substantive rule 
of criminal law to be applied in reviewing the sufficiency 
of the state’s evidence. Accordingly, because the defendant 
did not challenge the admission of the confessions, the 
Appellate Court held that it may consider the confessions 
in analyzing the sufficiency of the state’s evidence without 
reference to the corpus delicti rule. The Appellate Court 
further held that, even if the defendant was permitted to 
raise the corpus delicti rule as part of his insufficiency of 
the evidence claim, the sufficiency claim failed because 
substantial evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, was 
admitted at trial to corroborate both the trustworthiness 
of his confessions and the fact of the victim’s death. 

The Appellate Court next considered the defendant’s 
claim that the trial court improperly excluded from 
evidence a videotape of an interview that the police 
conducted of the victim’s friend immediately prior to his 
taking a polygraph examination. The defendant argued 
that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding the 
videotape of the pretest interview because the videotape 
contained relevant evidence of the friend’s bias and 
motive for testifying for the state. The state countered 
that the pretest interview was an inseverable component 
of the polygraph examination, and, therefore, the court 
properly excluded the videotape in accordance with 
the Supreme Court’s decision in State v. Porter, which 
reaffirmed Connecticut’s per se ban on the admissibility 
of polygraph evidence. The Appellate Court disagreed 
that the video of the pretest interview was “polygraph 
evidence” as used by the court in Porter, and agreed with 
the defendant that, by excluding the tape on that basis, 
the court improperly excluded relevant evidence of bias. 
Because this evidentiary error pertained to the veracity 
of a crucial state’s witness, it was harmful and, therefore, 
reversible error. 

The issue regarding the exclusion of the videotape was 
dispositive of the defendant’s appeal. Nevertheless, 
because they were likely to arise again on remand, the 
Appellate Court also considered the defendant’s claims 
that the court improperly admitted prior misconduct 
evidence and improperly precluded the defendant from 
presenting expert testimony concerning the reliability 
of jailhouse informants. With regard to the admission 

17   |   BIENNIAL REPORT

NOTEWORTHY CASES HEARD BY THE   
APPELLATE COURT DURING THE BIENNIUM

of certain evidence, the Appellate Court held that the 
challenged evidence was properly admitted. With regard 
to the exclusion of expert testimony, the defendant 
claimed  that, because the case against him depended 
heavily upon the testimony of jailhouse informants, 
some if not all of whom benefitted from cooperating 
with the state, the court should have permitted him to 
present expert testimony to the jury concerning the 
general unreliability of such evidence. The defendant 
argued that the information he sought to present was 
not within the knowledge of the average juror, nor was 
it supplied to them through other evidence or by the 
court’s instructions. The Appellate Court concluded that 
the trial court had abused its discretion by precluding 
expert testimony offered by the defendant and held that 
expert testimony concerning the reliability of informant 
testimony should be admitted if the court on remand 
determines that the expert is qualified and the proffered 
testimony is relevant to the specific issues in the case.

Judge Flynn authored a separate opinion concurring 
in the result. Although agreeing with the majority that 
there was sufficient independent evidence of the victim’s 
death, Judge Flynn dissented from that portion of the 
opinion that held that the corpus delicti rule was merely 
evidentiary and that independent proof of death was 
unnecessary in a murder case. 

State of Connecticut v. Tauren Williams-Bey, 167 
Conn. App. 744 (2016).

The defendant, Tauren Williams-Bey, appealed from 
the judgment of the trial court, in which it dismissed 
his motion to correct an illegal sentence. On appeal, the 
defendant claimed that the court erred by concluding 
that it did not have jurisdiction over his motion after it 
determined that his sentence did not violate the eighth 
amendment to the United States Constitution and article 
first, §§ 8 and 9, of the Constitution of Connecticut.  
The Appellate Court concluded that the trial court 
improperly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to 
consider the defendant’s motion, but properly concluded 
that the defendant’s federal and state constitutional rights 
were not violated.

On January 4, 2000, the defendant pleaded guilty to 
murder as an accessory in violation of General Statutes 
(Rev. to 1997) § 53a-54a and General Statutes § 53a-48. 
On February 25, 2000, the court sentenced the defendant 
to thirty-five years in prison. At the time of sentencing, 
the crime of which the defendant was convicted made 
him ineligible for parole. If he were to serve the full 
sentence, the defendant would not be released until he 
was fifty-two years old. 

The defendant filed an amended motion to correct 
an illegal sentence on April 2, 2014, asserting that his 
sentence violated the eighth amendment to the United 
States Constitution as explicated in Graham v. Florida, 
560 U.S. 48 (2010), and Miller v. Alabama, 132 S. Ct. 2455 
(2012). The defendant claimed that his sentence violated 
the eighth amendment to the United States Constitution 
because “the sentence and the manner in which it is 
imposed fail to provide for a meaningful opportunity 
to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and 
rehabilitation . . . .”  Following oral argument, the court 
issued a written memorandum of decision on July 29, 
2014, concluding that because the defendant was not 
serving a mandatory life without parole sentence, Graham 
and Miller were inapplicable. It, therefore, dismissed the 
motion, concluding that “the defendant’s case did not fall 
within the narrow confines of Graham or Miller, and the 
relief sought exceeded the jurisdiction of this court.”    

At the time the trial court ruled, neither State v. Riley, 
315 Conn. 637 (2015), nor Casino v. Commissioner of 
Correction, 317 conn. 52 (2016), Connecticut’s leading 
cases on juvenile sentencing, had been decided. Riley and 
Casino applied Miller retroactively to discretionary life 
without parole sentences and term of years sentences that 
are the functional equivalent of life sentences. 

The Appellate Court concluded that the trial court 
properly determined that the defendant’s sentence did 
not violate the eighth amendment to the United States 
Constitution as interpreted by Miller v. Alabama, supra, 
132 S. Ct. 2469. Furthermore, it concluded that even if 
the sentence violated the eighth amendment pursuant 
to Miller, in light of the United States Supreme Court’s 

18   |   BIENNIAL REPORT

NOTEWORTHY CASES HEARD BY THE   
APPELLATE COURT DURING THE BIENNIUM

decision in Montgomery v. Louisiana, U.S. 136 S. Ct. 718 
(2016), which held that conferring parole eligibility on a 
juvenile offender is a constitutionally adequate remedy for 
a sentence that violates Miller’s teachings upon retroactive 
application, and the fact that the defendant will be parole 
eligible under § 1 of No. 15-84 of the 2015 Public Acts 
(Public Act 15-84), codified at General Statutes § 54-125a 
(f), the defendant and those similarly situated have been 
provided with a constitutionally adequate remedy. 

As to the court’s jurisdiction to consider the defendant’s 
motion to correct, the Appellate Court held that the 
motion challenged the manner in which the sentence 
was imposed, namely, that the court did not consider 
the Miller factors during sentencing and whether the 
defendant was entitled to a later meaningful opportunity 
for the release. Because the motion to correct challenged 
the manner in which the sentence was imposed, rather 
than the legality of the sentence, the defendant’s claim 
was properly raised by a motion to correct pursuant to 
Practice Book § 43-22. The court’s conclusion that it  
could not provide the defendant a remedy did not 
implicate the court’s authority to determine whether 
the sentence had been imposed in an illegal manner. 
The form of the judgment, therefore, was improper. The 
Appellate Court reversed the judgment and remanded 
the case with direction to deny the motion to correct an 
illegal sentence. 

William Francini v. Goodspeed Airport, LLC et al., 164 
Conn. App. 279 (2016).

The plaintiff owned a parcel of land in East Haddam. 
The parcel’s only access to a public highway was over an 
abutting property, owned by the defendant. The defendant 
took title to its property by warranty deed in 1999 subject 
to a right-of-way easement enjoyed by the plaintiff as well 
as several of the plaintiff ’s neighbors, landowners who 
also owned land abutting the defendant’s property. In 
2001, the defendant entered an agreement with several of 
the plaintiff ’s neighbors, who also shared the plaintiff ’s 
right-of-way across the defendant’s property, to allow 
the neighbors to improve the right-of-way by installing 
and maintaining a utility distribution system under the 

existing right-of-way easement. As a result, a commercial 
utility system was constructed under the existing right-of-
way and provides electricity to the plaintiff ’s neighbors. 
In exchange for the utility easement, each of the plaintiff ’s 
neighbors paid the defendant $7500. The plaintiff and 
the defendant never reached an agreement regarding the 
utility easement. Without an agreement, the plaintiff, 
whose house is powered by a generator, does not  
enjoy an easement for commercial utilities and his 
property is currently landlocked from access to 
commercial electricity. 

The plaintiff commenced this declaratory judgment 
action seeking an easement by necessity for access to 
commercial utilities across the same right-of-way that he 
already owned and that already provided his neighbors 
with commercial electric power. The trial court granted 
the defendant’s motion for summary judgment and 
concluded, as a matter of law, that easements by necessity 
may not be granted for any purpose other than to provide 
physical access to a landlocked property. On appeal, the 
Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court, 
concluding that easements by necessity may provide 
not only physical access to landlocked property, but 
a property landlocked from commercial utilities may 
likewise receive an easement by necessity to access utility 
services. The Appellate Court noted that easements by 
necessity are not artifacts of a more ancient era and must 
serve their intended purpose, to render land useful, in the 
present day as beneficial use of land conforms to modern 
innovations and needs. The Appellate Court further 
concluded that access to utilities is reasonably necessary 
to the reasonable use and enjoyment of property, 
especially, as in this case, residential property.      

Villages, LLC v. Longhi, 166 Conn. App. 685 (2016).

This appeal concerns the immunity afforded a member 
of a planning and zoning commission who engages in 
ex parte communication with respect to applications 
pending before the commission. In 2009, the plaintiff 
landowner filed applications for a special use permit 
and to develop a residential subdivision in the town of 
Enfield. The town planning and zoning commission 

19   |   BIENNIAL REPORT

NOTEWORTHY CASES HEARD BY THE   
APPELLATE COURT DURING THE BIENNIUM

denied both applications, and the plaintiff appealed to 
the trial court. In its appeal, the plaintiff alleged that 
its applications were denied because the commission 
illegally and arbitrarily predetermined the outcome 
of the hearing due to the bias and personal animus of 
the defendant, who was a member of the commission. 
Following a trial, the trial court, Hon. Richard M. 
Rittenband, found that the defendant had played a 
significant role in the commission’s deliberations, had a 
personal bias against one of the plaintiff ’s principals, and 
had engaged in an ex parte communication regarding the 
applications. The court sustained the plaintiff ’s appeal 
on the basis of the defendant’s ex parte communication 
and concluded that the commission’s acts in denying the 
plaintiff ’s applications were not honest, legal, and fair. 
The commission appealed to the Appellate Court, which 
affirmed the judgment of the trial court.

The plaintiff thereafter commenced the present action 
against the defendant, alleging intentional fraudulent 
misrepresentation and intentional tortious interference 
with business expectancy. The defendant filed a motion 
to dismiss the action asserting that she was entitled 
to absolute immunity because she was acting in an 
administrative capacity and performing a quasi-judicial 
function when she voted on the plaintiff ’s applications. 
The trial court, Wiese, J., granted the motion to dismiss, 
finding that the commission was a quasi-judicial body 
acting in a quasi-judicial capacity when it considered 
the plaintiff ’s applications. The court concluded that 
the members of the commission were protected by the 
litigation privilege, a subset of absolute immunity, and 
granted the motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter 
jurisdiction. The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court.

On appeal, the plaintiff claimed, among other things, 
that the defendant’s liability was grounded not on her 
statements made during the commission’s deliberations, 
but on her internal bias and ex parte communication. The 
Appellate Court agreed that the trial court should not 
have dismissed the plaintiff ’s case on the basis of absolute 

immunity or the litigation privilege. It found that absolute 
immunity and the litigation privilege were not implicated 
by the allegations of the plaintiff ’s complaint. The trial 
court and the defendant had conflated the immunity 
provided to those who make statements before quasi-
judicial boards and the immunity provided to members of 
municipal agencies for exercising their decision-making 
responsibilities. The issue is controlled by General Statutes 
§ 52-557n (c). 

Section 52-557n (c) provides in relevant part that any 
person serving as an uncompensated member of a 
municipal commission shall not be personally liable 
for damage or injury resulting from any act, error or 
omission made in the exercise of such person’s policy 
or decision-making responsibilities “if such person was 
acting in good faith . . . and was not acting in violation 
of any state, municipal or professional code of ethics 
regulating the conduct of such person . . . . The provisions 
of this subsection shall not apply if such damage or injury 
was caused by the reckless, wilful or wanton misconduct of 
such person.”  The Appellate Court, therefore, concluded 
that the statute provides uncompensated members of 
municipal commissions with qualified immunity because 
it excepts from its purview conduct that is not undertaken 
in good faith, violates any state, municipal or professional 
code of ethics, or is reckless, wilful or wanton. 

The plaintiff ’s complaint alleged that the defendant had 
engaged in ex parte communication with respect to its 
applications. Connecticut law prohibits a municipal 
agency from using information that has been supplied to 
it by a party to a contested hearing on an ex parte basis. 
Given the allegations of ex parte communication by 
the defendant in the plaintiff ’s complaint, the Appellate 
Court stated that the trial court should have considered 
§ 52-557n (c), not the common-law litigation privilege, 
when adjudicating the defendant’s motion to dismiss. The 
Appellate Court concluded that the motion to dismiss 
was improperly granted and reversed the judgment and 
remanded the matter for further proceedings.

COMMIT TED TO PUBLIC SERVICE EXCELLENCE

As with each biennium, the past two years have been 
a time of great change for the Connecticut Judicial 
Branch. Significant budgetary reductions have affected 
the Branch deeply, but also strengthened its resolve to 
achieve its mission: to serve the interest of justice and 
the public by resolving matters brought before it in a 
fair, timely, efficient and open manner.

The Branch’s goals would be impossible to reach, however, 
without the commitment to public service excellence by 
its judges and employees. Their efforts and hard work 
have been especially important as the Branch continues 
to re-engineer how it processes civil and family cases. In 
addition, the Branch has continued to focus on ways to 
enhance meaningful access to justice through ongoing 
collaboration with the Connecticut Bar Association and 
local and affinity bar associations. The sum total of these 
efforts has ultimately benefited the public the most. 

provides the judge to which the case is assigned with the 
flexibility to manage the cases as required from initiation 
to disposition.

Another successful civil re-engineering initiative has been 
the opening of two mediation centers, one on the fourth 
floor of the Waterbury courthouse at 400 Grand St. and 
the other on the fourth floor of the Hartford Judicial 
District courthouse at 95 Washington St. These mediation 
centers are open to all civil judges who may want to 
schedule an alternative dispute resolution event. 

Other achievements in the area of civil matters include: 

  Housing sessions began e-filing on March 1, 2016.

  In September 2015, the Workgroup of Libraries and 
the Access to Justice Commission held a “Justice 
Fair” focusing on access to justice issues that face 
Connecticut’s self-represented population. 

The Branch in January 2016 completed the statewide 
rollout of the individual calendaring program for civil 
matters. With this program, cases are divided into two 
categories based upon the degree of judicial intervention 
that is most effective in leading to an efficient and timely 
resolution. But regardless of the category to which a case 
is assigned initially, the individual calendaring program 

  In addition to the Branch’s existing volunteer attorney 
programs in foreclosure and small claims (the latter in 
conjunction with the Connecticut Bar Association), 
five new volunteer attorney programs were established 
in March 2016 for contract collections cases in the 
Bridgeport, Hartford, New Haven, New London and 
Waterbury judicial districts.

25   |   BIENNIAL REPORT

COMMIT TED TO PUBLIC SERVICE EXCELLENCE

  An e-services inbox has been developed through the 
e-filing system that will allow attorneys and parties to 
receive their court notices electronically. The Branch 
expects to roll out this convenient case management 
feature in early 2017. 

Litigants in family matters have benefited from numerous 
enhancements as well. This ongoing effort includes the 
following achievements over the biennium: 

  As a result of a legislative proposal from the Judicial 

Branch, state law now allows parties who meet certain 
criteria to file a joint petition for nonadversarial 
divorce. This is a simplified process whereby the joint 
petitioners will not have to appear in court and their 
divorce will be finalized in approximately 30 days. 

  State law also was amended to allow parties to attest, 

under oath, that they have an agreement as to all terms 
of their divorce or legal separation and that they would 
like to waive the waiting periods required.

As a result of a legislative proposal from 
the Judicial Branch, state law now allows 
parties who meet certain criteria to file a 
joint petition for nonadversarial divorce.

  The Judicial Branch implemented improvements 
to the law regarding the appointment process of 
guardians ad litem and attorneys for minor children 
in family matters. In addition, a Practice Book rule 
taking effect in January 2017 authorizes the chief court 
administrator to form a standing committee to handle 
such things as eligibility and qualifications to be a GAL 
or AMC and the training requirements. 

that were closed with an agreement in 2015, 82 percent 
have not returned to court for child-related motions. 
For General Case Management, more than 300 cases 
were resolved without the need for additional court 
hearings. A series of research initiatives are under way 
to study the long-term effectiveness of these programs. 

  In response to the Legislature’s Public Act 16-105, 
CSSD’s Family Services enhanced and modified 
current practice regarding the restraining order 
extension hearing process. Specifically, Family Services 
will review relevant records including existing or prior 
orders of protection, pending criminal cases, prior 
convictions for a violent crime, outstanding warrants, 
pending or disposed Family Court matters and the 
outcome of a risk assessment. A formal report will be 
made available to both the applicant and respondent 
for review, and is provided to the judge as directed 
prior to a hearing. The judge has the discretion to 
consider the information gathered by Family Services 
when determining the extension of a restraining order.

  Also as a result of Public Act 16-105, the Judicial 
Branch created new forms and enhanced others, 
making them more user-friendly for restraining 
order applicants in family court. In addition, a new 
restraining order forms packet with a one-page plain 
language instruction helps guide applicants through 
the process. 

  The Family Volunteer Attorney Program continues 
to be offered based on the availability of volunteer 
attorneys in Hartford, Waterbury and Stamford. This 
program offers individuals who are not represented 
by an attorney to meet with a volunteer attorney for 
advice with their family matters case. 

  In 2015, the Court Support Services Division’s Family

interventions for family civil court matters. The goal 
of these innovative services is to provide judges with 
additional options to assist families with ongoing 
parenting disputes. Intensive Case Management was 
rolled out in several phases beginning in 2015 and will 
be fully implemented in all courts at the end of 2016.

The form has been used since July 1, 2015, and allows 
the Branch to track when supervised visitation orders 
are entered either with or absent an agreement of 
the parties. It also allows the Judicial Branch to track 
whether the supervised visitation is ordered to take 
place at a visitation center.

  Family e-filing began in December 2014 and was 
expanded in 2016 to include additional case types.

The Administrative Services Division provides centralized services to 
assist judges and Judicial Branch employees. Such services include: 
management and analysis of the Branch’s General Fund budget; payroll 
administration; revenue and expenditure accounting and payment 
of the Branch’s financial obligations; coordination of personnel and 
labor relations functions and employee benefits administration; capital 
budget development and oversight; facilities planning; design and repair; 
materials management; purchasing and warehousing; and internal 
auditing. 

Highlights of the biennium include: 

  The Department of Construction Services completed a major project at the 
Danbury Judicial District/Geographical Area No. 3 Courthouse, replacing 
the window system in the glass-walled facility. The $2.6 million project was 
completed in late winter 2015.

  During the biennium, the 1970s Fairfield Judicial District Courthouse saw 
the completion of two major projects: the rebuilding of the ramp accessing 
the underground parking garage; and the redesign and renovation of the 
front entry stairs and plaza.

  Exterior building façade repairs were completed in October 2015 at 

Hartford Community Court. This $581,000 project repaired the exterior of 
the 1930s-era building.

  The State Bond Commission approved $71 million of funding in May 2014 
for the Litchfield Judicial District Courthouse at Torrington. Construction 
on the new 174,000-square-foot facility began in early 2015. Occupancy is 
expected to occur during the spring of 2017.

  At the Middlesex Judicial District/Geographical Area No. 9 Courthouse, 

repairs to correct deteriorating concrete in the parking garage and 
sidewalks were completed in October 2015. 

  Obsolete mechanical systems in all seven elevators located in the nine-story 
New Haven Judicial District Courthouse were replaced with upgraded 
units. The Department of Construction Services administered the $1.9 
million project. 

  The Judicial Branch continued to submit project requests to the “Lead 
by Example” program administered by the Department of Energy and 
Environmental Protection. Two lighting fixture replacement projects at a 
total cost of $500,000 were completed in the Fairfield Judicial District – 
one at the Fairfield Judicial District Courthouse on Main Street and the 
other at the Geographical Area No. 2 Courthouse on Golden Hill Street. 

29   |   BIENNIAL REPORT

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES DIVISION

In addition, a utility-sponsored energy conservation 
project was completed at New Britain Superior Court. 
With substantial costs funded through the utility’s 
“Retro Commissioning” program, occupancy sensors 
for lighting were installed and significant changes were 
made to the HVAC and energy management systems. 

  The Facilities Unit administered the replacement of 
fire panels in: Danielson’s Geographical Area No. 
11 Courthouse; the Hartford Juvenile Detention 
Center; and the Middletown Judicial District/
Geographical Area No. 9 Courthouse. In addition, 
energy management controls were upgraded at: the 
Danielson G.A. Courthouse, the Fairfield Judicial 
District Courthouse; the Hartford Juvenile Detention 
Center; the State Supreme Court/State Library; and the 
Appellate Court. Other HVAC associated equipment – 
including air handlers, rooftop units, heat pumps and 
a cooling tower – were replaced in Litchfield, Norwalk 
and Norwich. 

  Access control equipment was installed to restrict 

specific floor access via the Fairfield Judicial District 
court’s public elevators. Overhead doors or sliding 
gates also were replaced at: the Bridgeport Juvenile 
Detention Center; the Commission on Official Legal 
Publications at Enfield’s Geographical Area No. 13 
Courthouse; Hartford’s Geographical Area No. 14 
Courthouse; and Milford’s Geographical Area No. 
22 Courthouse. During the biennium, numerous 
security upgrades, additions and replacements were 
implemented at various court locations statewide. 
These upgrades/enhancements included the purchase 
of new walk-through and hand-held weapon detection 
devices, as well as the installation of new video 
surveillance systems, duress alarm systems, intrusion 
alarm systems and electronic guard tour systems. 

  In the area of property accounting, the Materials 
Management Unit completed the development, 
testing and implementation of an application for 
online equipment transfers among office supervisors. 
Originally designed with help from the Information 
Technology Division, this user-friendly application 
allows supervisors to document temporary or 
permanent equipment transfers. The new system will 
in part replace paper transfers that had to be signed 
and scanned by the participating supervisors and 

then transmitted to the Property Accounting Office 
via email. Often, there were delays in the receipt and 
matching up of the paper transfers. By eliminating 
delays, it is anticipated that the automation effort 
will improve documentation for more than 4,000 
equipment moves in the Judicial Branch each fiscal 
year. 

  The Human Resource Management Unit assumed full 
fiscal responsibility for the Workers’ Compensation 
Program effective July 1, 2015, with the introduction 
of a new line item in the Judicial Branch budget. The 
unit is now involved in fiscal decisions and settlement 
negotiations in order to responsibly administer these 
funds.

  The HR unit initiated and completed several 

information technology improvements that produced 
significant labor savings. One of the technical 
improvements allows HR staff to quickly generate an 
individualized packet for every Family Medical Leave 
Act applicant. Another example is the automation of 
the monthly vacancy report, used internally to track 
variations in the Judicial Branch workforce. 

  The HR unit also partnered with the Information 
Technology Division in the review of technical job 
applications in order to expedite the recruitment 
process. The knowledge and expertise provided by ITD 
increased the accuracy and speed with which qualified 
candidates could be identified.

The Court Support Services Division (CSSD) oversees pretrial services, 
family services and probation supervision of adults and juveniles as well as 
juvenile detention services. CSSD also prepares presentence investigation 
reports, which judges may order for use when sentencing defendants. In 
addition, CSSD administers a network of statewide contracted community 
providers that deliver services to court-ordered clients. 

Highlights of the biennium include: 

  In the spring of 2015, Bail Services – in collaboration with judges, 
prosecutors, public defenders, the Department of Correction and a 
community treatment provider – implemented a pilot program in the 
Bridgeport court called the Treatment Pathway Program. The program 
is designed to provide eligible defendants entering the criminal justice 
system at arraignment with the opportunity to obtain an immediate clinical 
assessment. The assessment’s focus is on clients with alcohol and opiate 
dependencies who would be better served by a treatment diversion option 
rather than being held in jail. To date, the program has been very successful 
and has accepted approximately 155 clients as a court-ordered condition 
of release at arraignment. Of that number, 122 were placed in the regional 
network of programs within 24 hours. Most promising is that 75 percent 
of the defendants in the program did not receive a period of incarceration 
when their case was disposed. Expansion of this diversionary program 
is in the planning stage for the New London Geographical Area No. 10 
Courthouse. 

Pursuant to Public Act 14-27, Adult Probation began 
issuing Certificates of Employability in January 2015 to 
probation applicants in good standing (compliant with 
probation conditions).

  Pursuant to Public Act 14-27, Adult Probation began issuing Certificates 

of Employability in January 2015 to probation applicants in good standing 
(compliant with probation conditions). The goal of the legislation is 
to promote the public policy of rehabilitation through employment of 
individuals with criminal convictions. When CSSD issues the certificate, 
it indicates to potential and current employers and/or licensing agencies 
that CSSD believes the individual’s prior convictions should not prevent 
that person from getting a job or professional license. During 2015, CSSD 
reviewed 123 applications for the certificate and granted 73, for a 60 
percent grant rate. Through the first six months of 2016, CSSD reviewed 52 
applications and granted 34 of them, for a 65 percent grant rate. 

31   |   BIENNIAL REPORT

COURT SUPPORT SERVICES DIVISION 

In 2015, CSSD began developing an in-house training program for all adult 
probation officers in consultation with Central Connecticut State University. 

  CSSD’s Adult Probation, Bail and Family Services 

units implemented a notification process that provides 
clients with an opportunity to receive an automated 
reminder, either by text message or telephone call, 
of an upcoming court date or other appointment. 
All clients have the option of opting in or out of the 
notification service. If the client opts in, he or she 
selects the method of delivery that best suits his or  
her situation. 

  The Case Data Record, which is Connecticut’s pretrial 
bail decision risk assessment, was revalidated in 2015 
by Central Connecticut State University (CCSU). 
CCSU initially validated the tool in 2003 based solely 
upon the statutory requirement that the least restrictive 
conditions of release be set to ensure a defendant’s 
appearance in court. The Legislature in 2012 added a 
second prong, community safety, to the bail decision-
making process, and CSSD subsequently revised its 
uniform weighted release criteria to include criteria 
specific to public safety. CSSD in 2015 again contracted 
with CCSU to revalidate the Case Data Record for both 
appearances in court and community safety. Following 
a rigorous analysis of bail data, CCSU Professor 
Jennifer Hedlund found that the uniform weighted 
release criteria were predictive of appearance in court 
and public safety. Dr. Hedlund also recommended that 
certain criteria be weighted differently to better predict 
appearance and safety, and CSSD will implement these 
recommendations in 2017. 

  In 2015, CSSD began developing an in-house training 
program for all adult probation officers in consultation 
with CCSU. The training program is the result of 
a grant that CSSD, CCSU and the University of 
Southern Maine received in 2012 from the Bureau 
of Justice Assistance. The grant sought to enhance 
the supervision skills of probation officers through 
a Forensic Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Training 
Program (FCBT), which is based on the premise 

that altering a probationer’s cognitive processing can 
modify imbalances in their emotions and behavior 
and change criminal thinking patterns that affect 
recidivism. Under the grant, CCSU professors provided 
training and staff from the University of Southern 
Maine evaluated whether probationer recidivism rates 
decreased for probation officers who received the 
training. Evaluators noted that officers who completed 
the training had lower recidivism rates compared with 
their pre-training rates. Moreover, officers from the 
first group of trainees who demonstrated the most 
proficiency with FCBT supervision services had much 
lower recidivism rates compared with others who 
completed the training. 

Nine officers from the first group of trainees were 
chosen to serve as coaches and assist in training the 
second group. In addition, CSSD in 2015 promoted 
one of the coaches to oversee the training initiative 
and to work with CCSU in developing the in-house 
program. CSSD also implemented regular booster 
sessions for FCBT program graduates and near the end 
of 2015 applied for a second federal grant to further 
develop and enhance the program. In September 
2016, CSSD learned it had been selected to receive 
an additional three-year federal grant to once again 
partner and collaborate with CCSU and other criminal 
justice experts to fully implement the program in the 
delivery of adult probation supervision services. 

  During the biennium, CSSD staff participated 

extensively in the subcommittees and working groups 
of the legislatively mandated Juvenile Justice Policy and 
Oversight Committee (Connecticut General Statutes. 
56b-121n). This work led to the adoption of Public Act 
16-147, which made significant changes to the juvenile 
justice process in Connecticut. The implementation 
of these changes required substantial effort, and CSSD 
staff worked to ensure that theses changes would be 

32   |   BIENNIAL REPORT

COURT SUPPORT SERVICES DIVISION 

implemented by their effective dates. Most significant 
among the changes was narrowing the grounds upon 
which a child can be held in a juvenile detention center, 
and the development of the Detention Risk Screen 
required by the legislation. The legislation will also lead 
to changes in the types of contracted programs that 
will be needed, and CSSD engaged in the process of  
redesigning and rebidding those contracts.

  During the biennium, CSSD worked on enhancing 
a family engagement pilot program in the Hartford 
Juvenile Detention Center to provide support and 
advocacy training to “difficult to engage” families. 
CSSD partnered with AFCAMP (family advocacy 
organization in Hartford) to pilot the use of a family 
empowerment specialist to engage parents who were 
historically difficult for probation to engage. The 
parents either had children involved with multiple 
systems and other related stressors, or were very 
mistrustful of the court system. The key to program 
success was the family empowerment specialist 
meeting with the family on the day of court and 
engaging the family to understand that the specialist 
was offering support and not more demands. The 
specialists were successful in supporting the parents 
such that 33 out of 35 families successfully discharged 
from the program. From August 2014 through April 
2016, the 33 parents reported increased collaboration 
with Probation (92 percent), with DCF (80 percent), 
with school (79 percent) and with the Court  
(73 percent) to achieve better outcomes for their 
children and themselves. 

  CSSD also improved room confinement procedures at 
both the Hartford and Bridgeport Juvenile Detention 
centers to reduce the amount of time juveniles spend in 
their rooms. The adoption of the Positive Intervention 
and Support (PBIS) system, a nationally recognized, 
research-based, systems approach to improve school 
climate and create safer and more effective schools, 
has led to both a decrease in room confinement and 
elimination of prone restraints at the detention centers. 
This initiative was highlighted at the Northeast  
PBIS Forum. 

  CSSD’s implementation of a trauma-informed model in 
youth detention, and the model’s subsequent success, 
was highlighted in the Winston Churchill Memorial 
Trust Fellowship report from Australia. CSSD has been 
using the TARGET model, a psychoeducational group 
curriculum developed by Dr. Julian Ford at UCONN 
Health Center, Department of Psychiatry, to teach 
youth about the biological effects of trauma, trauma 
reaction triggers, and skills to regulate emotions and 
responses. Participating youth have demonstrated 
an improved ability to control their emotions and 
behaviors, which has led to significant decreases in 
disciplinary incidents and the use of room time. 

  CSSD is working with the Department of Children 

and Families on the Anti-Trafficking Response Team 
as part of a multi-agency effort through the Governor’s 
Task Force on Justice for Abused Children to combat 
human trafficking. CSSD staff has been trained on 
human trafficking and work to identify client victims 
and refer them for services. Additionally, CSSD offers 
in its detention centers an education prevention 
curriculum developed by LOVE 146 for at-risk youth.

The mission of the External Affairs Division is to promote public trust 
and confidence in the Judicial Branch by fostering relationships with the 
Legislative and Executive Branches, the media and the community at large; 
informing students, community groups, professional organizations and the 
public about the role and mission of the Judicial Branch; and providing 
high school and college students with the opportunity to explore careers 
within the Judicial Branch through its Experiential Learning Program.

Legislative/Government Relations

During the 2015 and 2016 legislative sessions, representatives from External 
Affairs worked to ensure that the Judicial Branch’s voice was heard by 
members of the General Assembly by carefully reviewing all proposed 
legislation and submitting testimony on dozens of bills. As in years past, 
External Affairs collaborated with legislators, the Governor’s office and 
numerous other agencies to ensure that the concerns of the Judicial Branch 
were addressed in a wide array of legislation affecting the court system. While 
the state’s fiscal crisis took up much of the Legislature’s agenda during the past 
two sessions, External Affairs also shepherded the Branch’s own proposals 
through the legislative process. These included An Act Concerning Court 
Operations in both 2015 and 2016, and An Act Concerning A Nonadversarial 
Dissolution of Marriage in 2015.

While the state’s fiscal crisis took up much of the 
Legislature’s agenda during the past two sessions, 
External Affairs also shepherded the Branch’s own 
proposals through the legislative process.

During the course of the previous two legislative sessions, External Affairs also 
assisted with nearly 50 judicial reappointments.

 

  

  

Furthermore, since the beginning of 2016, 
External Affairs has begun producing weekly 
Legislative Updates during the session, and 
has worked with legislators, the Office of 
Legislative Research and other agencies to 
resolve over 100 constituent issues.

Camera Requests

From July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2016, the division handled 
1,341 requests from the media to take photographs or to 
videotape a court proceeding. Of those numbers, judges 
approved 1,223 requests, which represent 91 percent of 
all requests. The majority of the denials were because the 
requests did not comply with the rules outlined in the 
Connecticut Practice Book.

The Information Technology Division (ITD) is dedicated to providing 
state-of-the-art data processing and publication services to the Judicial 
Branch and its customers in the legal community, outside agencies and  
the public. 

ITD helps the Judicial Branch fulfill its mission through the design, 
development and maintenance of a sophisticated, secure and reliable network, 
computing and printing infrastructure. This infrastructure provides for the 
gathering, transmission, storage, retrieval, backup, display and publication 
of data and information processed most often through automated systems 
developed in-house and deployed to support the Branch’s operating and 
administrative divisions. This includes providing public information access, 
enhanced “self-service” support for self-represented parties, as well as access 
to interactive forms, technological improvements in courtrooms and an 
improved ability to interact with the courts remotely. 

Highlights of the 2014 – 2016 biennium include:

  Judicial Branch Data Centers: With minimal impact or interruption to the 
court system, the Judicial Branch’s primary Data Center was relocated in 
2015 from East Hartford to Groton. The successful result was the product 
of an intense six-month effort involving ITD staff from several disciplines 
along with support from the Materials Management, Facilities and Fiscal 
Administration units. The effort also involved close cooperation with the 
Executive Branch Bureau of Enterprise and Systems Technology (BEST). 
The move required the design, acquisition, installation and testing of 
new network and data storage equipment in Groton and an upgrade of 
equipment in the secondary Data Center in Waterbury.

With minimal impact or interruption to the court 
system, the Judicial Branch’s primary Data Center was 
relocated in 2015 from East Hartford to Groton.

High speed redundant fiber optic connections link the two data centers in 
a “ring” topology so the connection cannot be interrupted by a cable cut 
along the route. The two data centers are designed to share the Branch’s IT 
workload, but either is capable of serving all of the Branch’s workload in an 
emergency or for planned maintenance.

All courthouses and Judicial Branch offices are connected via wide area 
network to both data centers and both maintain up-to-the-second exact 
copies of all Branch data to prevent loss. In the event of a disaster that 
renders one of the data centers inoperable, all processing can be shifted to 
the surviving data center in a matter of minutes.

on the “View the File” page. It also provides an indicator 
if a document is sealed, if it was filed by a state agency or 
if a financial affidavit is sealed. 

There were 1,967,812 Civil/Family/
Housing documents e-filed during  
the biennium.

  Criminal Rewrite: ITD began work on a major 

Criminal Rewrite initiative – part of a Federal NICS 
Act Record Improvement Program (NARIP) grant – 
that will make the system more efficient and effective. 
A SQL data model was implemented and loaded with 
pertinent information to report to the Protection 
Order Registry Adjudication Reporting Module (POR-
ARM). This will help prevent an additional 15,000 
felons from possessing firearms. The transmission of 
data is being automated to the POR-ARM system and 
will speed up the reporting process.

  Appellate e-filing Applications: In September 2014, 
attorneys were provided the capability to file briefs for 
Supreme and Appellate Court matters electronically 
using e-Briefs Upload. Since that time, 8,604 brief 
filings have been submitted.

On January 1, 2016, e-filing by attorneys for 
Supreme and Appellate Court matters was released 
to production. Throughout the first half of 2016, 
additional releases provided a few necessary 
enhancements and laid the groundwork for the third 
quarter 2016 release of e-filing by self-represented 
parties for Supreme and Appellate Court matters.

During its first six months of operation – January 1 
to June 30, 2016 – there were 13,798 Supreme and 
Appellate Court electronic filing transactions with 
14,242 electronic documents filed and 394 payments 
processed. 

  Civil/Family/Housing e-filing: This development 
added the ability for attorneys and self-represented 
parties to electronically file many family case types 
including dissolution of marriage, legal separation, 
annulment and civil union. Other improvements 
include:

•  Documents can now be viewed electronically by 

parties involved in the case;

•  The ability for Support Enforcement Services to file 
documents on these cases where applicable; and 

•  The addition of e-filing capability to housing case 
types for attorneys and self-represented parties for 
most courts and housing sessions.

Of note: there were 1,967,812 Civil/Family/Housing 
documents e-filed during the biennium. Over the last 
two years, 15,485 self-represented parties registered  
for e-filing.

  Edison/Clara (statistics tracking): Since July 2014, six 
major releases of the internal software Edison and Clara 
were implemented. Edison is for use by judges, caseflow 
and staff for monitoring electronic civil, family and 
housing cases. Major features of these releases include 
the ability to view up to three documents simultaneously

  Detention Center Medical Records: In April 2016, 
ITD approved the application architecture presented 
by the Court Support Services Division (CSSD) and 
configured the necessary hardware and software to 
support a new electronic Medical Records Application 
for the Juvenile Detention centers in Bridgeport  
and Hartford.

  Security Awareness Training: Implemented Branch-
wide SANS Security Awareness Training – mandatory 
for all Judicial Branch staff – to help protect the 
integrity of Judicial Branch data and to reduce the 
incidents of PC infection or the theft of Personally 
Identifiable Information.

  For the Record (FTR): FTR is now in 270-plus 

courtrooms statewide with 50 rolling carts – at least 
one per courthouse – to ensure business continuity in 
the event of equipment failure. Other enhancements 
include:

•  Rolled out handheld digital recording technology 

(Philips Digital Recorders) to various jury assembly 
rooms statewide;

•  Deployed ancillary units for court monitors to use for 

remote proceedings in each judicial district;

•  Expanded FTR to include certain types of special 

proceedings typically covered by court reporters; and 

•  Enhanced the FTR eCourt website to offer new 

categorization of cases, improved search capabilities 
and the ability to track transcript production.

  Digital Signage Prototype: Launched a Digital 

Signage Prototype at the geographical area No. 19 
courthouse in Rockville. A large television monitor 
connected to a computer in the lobby displays civil and 
family case information to be heard on that day. The 
prototype, intended to provide members of the public 
with enhanced access to case information, went live in 
October 2015. 

Additionally, work began on a new criminal web 
system that allows data to be replicated to the web from 
the legacy Criminal Motor Vehicle System (CRMVS) 
and then sent back to the CRMVS after processing 
through the new website.

  State Marshals Tracking Application: ITD designed 

and developed an application that allows state marshals 
to submit service of process information online 
for restraining orders and civil protection orders 
using a computer or mobile device. The application 
incorporates changes pursuant to Public Act 16-34 that 
required additional reporting data on served orders.

  Child Protection e-filing: The Department of 

Children and Families may now e-file child protection 
documents, such as Orders of Temporary Custody, 
directly from its office, eliminating the need to drive to 
the court. Additionally, information flows directly from 
the electronic documents into the child protection 
database, and there is no need to re-enter data.

   Judicial Branch website: The division designed and 

developed new Supreme and Appellate Court, Victim 
Services and Law Libraries websites with improved 
navigation for all related court information. All sites 
are mobile friendly.

SUPERIOR COURT OPERATIONS DIVISION

The Superior Court Operations Division assists the Judicial Branch in the 
administration of justice by providing quality services and information 
to the Court, its users and the community in an effective, professional 
and courteous manner. The division, the largest in the Judicial Branch, 
also provides judges and support staff with the resources needed to 
process cases in a timely and efficient manner. In addition, the division 
coordinates the Judicial Branch’s implementation of the Judicial Branch’s 
strategic plan. 

Highlights of the past two years include:

  The Sandy Hook Workers Assistance Program, administered by the Office 
of Victim Services, statutorily ended on Aug. 31, 2015, with more than 
$272,000 being disbursed to applicants since its establishment on April 1, 
2013. The program assisted certain professionals who suffered a mental or 
emotional impairment as a result of their response or scheduled response 
to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

  The Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners (SAFE) Program celebrated its 
5th anniversary of providing sexual assault forensic examining services 
to sexual assault victims who go to a participating hospital. During 
this biennium, the program responded to 431 cases of sexual assault at 
participating hospitals with 86 percent of the victims consenting to a 
forensic exam and evidence collection.

  Nearly 70 percent of all infractions issued are being 
transmitted electronically to the Judicial Branch’s 
Centralized Infractions Bureau from the Connecticut 
State Police, the Department of Motor Vehicles and 
55 local law enforcement agencies. A new citation 
form was introduced and enforcement efforts have 
been expanded to include written warnings and the 
collection of racial profiling information. Interfaces 
with the Department of Motor Vehicles and Central 
Connecticut State University were developed to 
facilitate the transmission of data related to written 
warnings and racial profiling. 

  Support Enforcement Services (SES) developed a new, 
five-year strategic plan with measurable performance 
goals and performance indicators. SES created 
management and production reports to help staff focus 
on goals and to incorporate them into staff evaluations. 
By the close of Year 2, child support collection rates 
increased more than 3.3 percentage points (to  
61.3 percent). 

  SES fully implemented a 2011 law authorizing judicial 
marshals to execute child support capias warrants 

within courthouses. Judicial marshals executed 17 
percent of child support capias executions in FY 15 
and 33 percent of all child support capias executions in 
FY 16, saving the state up to $239,000. The backlog of 
capiases dropped to 2,337, compared with more than 
3,000 at the start of the biennium. 

  SES developed and piloted in Bridgeport a customer 
satisfaction survey in Family Support Magistrate 
Court. Ninety-one percent of all parties responded that 
they were treated professionally. Ninety-three percent 
responded that they were treated with respect by  
SES staff.

  SES enrolled two staff members in a nine-month 

cultural competency training program offered by the 
Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services; 
offered a half-day curriculum on the Culture of 
Poverty and Transgender Basics as part of the Judicial 
Branch’s Diversity Week; and made regular bimonthly 
appearances on Spanish-language radio shows and 
other community presentations through CULTURA, 
the Hispanic outreach team at SES.

  The Pillars of Excellence Program, under the 

direction of the Staff Development Unit, continues 
to offer workshops to employees of the Supreme 
and Appellate courts and all divisions of the Branch, 
furthering the Branch’s commitment to public service 
as demonstrated by the four core values of integrity, 
fairness, respect and professionalism. Since the last 
biennial report, more than 1,400 employees have 
participated in the core-value focused workshops that 
were uniquely designed for two distinct audiences: 
managers/supervisors and frontline staff. 

  The Judicial Branch’s Judge Support Services Unit 

continued to provide quality educational opportunities 
for judges and family support magistrates. A significant 
continuing education accomplishment was the 
facilitation of a judicial training program by Dr. 
Jacquelyn Campbell, a nationally renowned leader 
in domestic violence research and advocacy, and the 
foremost expert in determining dangerousness and 
lethality in such situations. Dr. Campbell provided 
training for the judges on lethality factors and the 
practical application of a lethality assessment when 
ruling on restraining orders, protective orders and 
civil orders of protection in family, criminal and civil 
courts. Judges attending the full-day training program 
participated in exercises and scenarios. 

  More than 45 programs were held for judges and 

family support magistrates during the biennium. These 
education programs included divisional programs; 
domestic violence programs and roundtables; 
computer technology and e-filing programs; diversity 
awareness and sexual harassment programs; and 
foreclosure roundtables. 

  The Legal Services Unit provided counsel to numerous 
Branch committees and commissions, including but 
not limited to: 

•   The Rules Committee, as it recommended and the 
judges adopted various rules, including mandatory 
continuing legal education; 

•   The Jury Communications Committee, which 

reviews, revises and updates all jury notices that are 
used in communicating with the public, including 

the jury summons, request for postponements,  
etc. online;

•   The Code of Evidence Oversight Committee of 

the Supreme Court, which is charged with making 
recommendations to the Supreme Court for the 
orderly development of evidence law in Connecticut; 
and 

•   The Committee of Judicial Ethics, which has held 25 

meetings and issued 48 advisory opinions. 

  Interpreters assisted with 40,806 court appearances 
and interviews in fiscal year 2015 and 41,850 court 
appearances and interviews the following fiscal year. 
Telephonic interpretations totaled 14,324 in FY 15 
and 16,140 in FY 16. Also in FY 15, there were a total 
of 159 translations, 91 of which were evidentiary. 
Evidentiary translations are related to case-specific 
information that must be translated before a matter 
goes forward – a victim’s statement for example. The 
remaining 68 translations involved vital documents 
such as Branch forms, brochures, pamphlets and 
intranet pages. In FY 16, there were 85 evidentiary 
translations and 98 vital documents translations. 

Between July 1, 2014 and June 30, 2016, 
the Judicial Branch received at least 
1,395 requests for ADA accommodations. 

  Between July 1, 2014 and June 30, 2016, the Judicial 
Branch received at least 1,395 requests for ADA 
accommodations. These accommodations included 
vendor-provided services, such as sign language 
interpretation and real-time transcription, and those 
that involve more complicated requests for assistance. 

  The Branch received $60,000 in two annual grants of 
$30,000 in 2014 and 2015, from the federally funded 
State Justice Institute to present training on interacting 
with people with hidden disabilities and vicarious 
trauma. Some 1,520 staff members from all five 
divisions attended these trainings during  
the biennium.

  The Branch in 2016 purchased software for the creation 

of an online training program on service animals, 
which is being developed by staff with information 
from the U.S. Department of Justice. Additionally, 
725 employees received this training in person from 
Branch staff. 

  A Juror Accessibility Study was conducted at the 

state’s 18 oldest courthouses. The study, which was 
completed in March 2016, will require the expenditure 
of several million dollars to improve accessibility to 
jury assembly rooms, common areas, restrooms and 
juror boxes. The Branch will focus its immediate efforts 
on improving ADA access to jury assembly areas and 
restrooms in six locations – Bridgeport, Danbury, 
Hartford, New Haven, New London and Waterbury. 
The Branch is seeking $2.5 million annually from the 
state budget to continue improving juror accessibility. 

  Judicial Marshal Services, in an effort to assist in 

combating the growing opioid epidemic and to ensure 
continued public safety of Judicial Branch courthouses, 
has conducted training in the use and administration 
of Intranasal Naloxone. All Judicial Marshals have 
received education and training in the use and 
administration of Intranasal Naloxone. Each Judicial 
Branch courthouse has a minimum of two Intranasal 
Naloxone doses per facility.

Judicial Marshal Services, in an effort to 
assist in combating the growing opioid

has conducted training in the use and 
administration of Intranasal Naloxone. 

  The Judicial Marshal Academy continues to provide 
professional education and training to Judicial 
Marshal Services and agencies internal and external 
of the Judicial Branch. Charter Oak State University 
conducted a review of the Judicial Marshal Academy 
pre-service education and training program. The 
faculty assessment team members reviewed the 
academy’s application, resources and materials to 
ensure the program materials were inclusive of all key 
theories, topics and concepts. The faculty assessors 
were very impressed with the quality of the training 
and the significant enhancements since their initial 
review in 2005. Charter Oak State University’s 
assessment team certified, approved and awarded the 
Judicial Marshal Academy 17 academic credits.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
