KYLLE BREWER v. COMMISSIONER
OF CORRECTION
(AC 41635)

Prescott, Moll and Cradle, Js.

Syllabus

The petitioner, who had been convicted of the crime of manslaughter in
the first degree and other offenses, sought a writ of habeas corpus,
claiming, inter alia, that certain legislative changes to a risk reduction
earned credit program had been improperly applied to him by the respon-
dent, the Commissioner of Correction. The habeas court, sua sponte
and without providing the petitioner with prior notice or an opportunity
to be heard, dismissed the petitioner’s amended petition pursuant to
the rule of practice (§ 23-29), concluding that it lacked subject matter
jurisdiction over the petition and that the amended petition failed to
state a claim on which habeas corpus relief could be granted. On the
granting of certification, the petitioner appealed to this court. The
respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, argued on appeal that,
because the petitioner was no longer incarcerated and was serving a
probationary period, the appeal was moot. Held that, pursuant to this
court’s reasoning and conclusions in Leffingwell v. Commissioner of
Correction (218 Conn. App. 216), the appeal was not moot and the
habeas court was required to provide to the petitioner prior notice of
its intention to dismiss, on its own motion, the amended petition and
an opportunity to submit a brief or a written response addressing the
proposed basis for dismissal, which it did not do; accordingly, on remand,
should the habeas court again elect to exercise its discretion to dismiss
the amended petition on its own motion pursuant to Practice Book § 23-
29, the court must comply with Brown v. Commissioner of Correction
(345 Conn. 1), and Boria v. Commissioner of Correction (345 Conn.
39), by providing the petitioner with prior notice and an opportunity
to submit a brief or written response addressing the proposed basis
for dismissal.

Argued January 9—officially released March 21, 2023

Procedural History

Amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus,
brought to the Superior Court in the judicial district of
Tolland, where the court, Hon. Edward J. Mullarkey,
judge trial referee, rendered judgment dismissing the
petition, from which the petitioner, on the granting of
certification, appealed to this court. Reversed; further
proceedings.

Naomi T. Fetterman, assigned counsel, with whom,
on the brief, was Temmy Ann Miller, assigned counsel,
for the appellant (petitioner).

Zenobia G. Graham-Days, assistant attorney general,
with whom, on the brief, were William Tong, attorney
general, and Clare Kindall, former solicitor general, for
the appellee (respondent).

Opinion

CRADLE, J. The petitioner, Kylle Brewer, appeals,
following the granting of his petition for certification
to appeal, from the judgment of the habeas court dis-
missing sua sponte, pursuant to Practice Book § 23-29,1
his amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus. In
that petition, he claimed, inter alia, that his federal and
state constitutional rights were violated as a result of
legislative changes pertaining to the administration and
application of risk reduction earned credits (RREC).2
On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court improp-
erly dismissed his petition without first providing him
with notice and an opportunity to be heard. In accor-
dance with our Supreme Court’s decisions in Brown v.
Commissioner of Correction, 345 Conn. 1, 282 A.3d 959
(2022), and Boria v. Commissioner of Correction, 345
Conn. 39, 282 A.3d 433 (2022), we conclude that the
habeas court should not have dismissed the habeas
petition pursuant to § 23-29 without first providing the
petitioner with notice and an opportunity to submit a
brief or other written response addressing the proposed
basis for dismissal. Accordingly, we reverse the judg-
ment of the habeas court and remand for further pro-
ceedings in accordance with this decision.

The following procedural history is relevant to this
appeal. The petitioner was convicted of manslaughter
in the first degree with a firearm and other offenses
and received a total effective sentence of thirty years of
incarceration, execution suspended after fifteen years,
followed by five years of probation. On August 21, 2014,
the petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus
as a self-represented party. He simultaneously filed a
request for the appointment of counsel and an applica-
tion for waiver of fees, both of which the court granted
on August 28, 2014. The court subsequently issued the
writ. An amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus
was filed on September 30, 2014. Appointed counsel
filed an appearance on behalf of the petitioner on Janu-
ary 9, 2017.

By order dated March 19, 2018, the court, Hon.
Edward J. Mullarkey, judge trial referee, sua sponte
dismissed the habeas action pursuant to Practice Book
§ 23-39 (1), (2) and (5). Prior to dismissing the action,
the court did not provide the petitioner with an opportu-
nity to be heard with respect to the dismissal.3 The
petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration on the
grounds that the dismissal ‘‘improperly precluded [him]
from amending his petition [filed in a self-represented
capacity] and denied [him the] right to be present for
arguments on a dispositive matter.’’ On April 13, 2018,
the court summarily denied that motion. The petitioner
filed a petition for certification to appeal in accordance
with General Statutes § 52-470 (g), which the court
granted. This appeal followed.

On September 24, 2021, this court granted the parties’
joint motion to stay the appeal pending a final resolution
of the appeals in Brown v. Commissioner of Correction,
supra, 345 Conn. 1, and Boria v. Commissioner of Cor-
rection, supra, 345 Conn. 39, which were then pending
before our Supreme Court and involved similar claims.
After our Supreme Court officially released its decisions
in Brown and Boria, we ordered the parties to file
supplemental briefs ‘‘addressing the effect, if any, of
[Brown and Boria] on this appeal, including whether,
if the judgment of dismissal is reversed, the habeas
court should be directed on remand ‘to first determine
whether any grounds exist for it to decline to issue the
writ pursuant to Practice Book § 23-24.’ ’’4 The parties
complied with our supplemental briefing order.

In addition to the issues that we asked the parties to
address in their supplemental briefs, the respondent
raised a number of arguments suggesting that the appeal
is now moot.5 At oral argument before this court, the
respondent raised an additional mootness argument not
contained in his supplemental brief.

The arguments asserted by the parties in their supple-
mental briefs and at oral argument, as to the effect of
Brown and Boria on this appeal and the respondent’s
mootness arguments, are identical to those considered
in Leffingwell v. Commissioner of Correction, 218
Conn. App. 216,
(2023), which we also
decide today. We conclude that our examination of
the same issues in Leffingwell thoroughly resolves the
claims in the present appeal and that there is nothing
in this case that would mandate a different result.
Accordingly, we adopt the reasoning and conclusions
in Leffingwell in resolving the issues raised in the pres-
ent appeal.

A.3d

We also adopt the following reasoning and conclusion
set forth in Leffingwell as to the remand order. ‘‘With
respect to whether we should permit the court another
opportunity to consider declining to issue the writ pur-
suant to Practice Book § 23-24, we decline to include
this as part of our remand order. The court’s dismissal in
the present case occurred prior to our Supreme Court’s
decision in Gilchrist [v. Commissioner of Correction,
334 Conn. 548, 223 A.3d 368 (2020). In the present case,
however, [the petitioner had filed an amended petition
and] counsel had been appointed .
. prior to the
habeas court’s dismissal. As this court previously has
clarified in declining to apply footnote 11 of Brown in
similar cases, ‘[i]t would strain logic to construe foot-
note 11 of Brown as advising that we should direct the
habeas court on remand to consider declining to issue
the writ under § 23-24 vis-a` -vis the amended petition,
which was filed after the writ had been issued. More-
over, affording the habeas court on remand another
opportunity to consider declining to issue the writ under
§ 23-24 vis-a` -vis the original habeas petition, in effect,

.

.

.

would vitiate the filing of the amended petition, which
is not an outcome that we believe our Supreme Court
. Hodge v. Commissioner of
in Brown intended.’
Correction, [216 Conn. App. 616, 623–624, 285 A.3d 1194
(2022)]; see also Villafane v. Commissioner of Correc-
tion, 216 Conn. App. 839, 850–51, 287 A.3d 138 (2022).6
‘Although the present dismissal occurred prior to Gilch-
rist, we are not persuaded that we should apply the
rationale in footnote 11 of Brown to the present case.
Unlike in Brown and Boria, the dismissal in the present
case occurred not merely after the writ had issued but
after counsel had appeared on the petitioner’s behalf
and an amended petition was filed. . . . The fact that
an amended petition had been filed at the time of the
court’s dismissal in this case leads us to conclude that
the proper course on remand is not for the court to
first consider whether declining to issue the writ under
. . . § 23-24 is warranted.’ . . . See Villafane v. Com-
missioner of Correction, supra, 216 Conn. App. 850.’’
(Footnote in original.) Leffingwell v. Commissioner of
Correction, supra, 218 Conn. App. 286–88.

The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and
this court’s decision in Leffingwell v. Commissioner
of Correction, 218 Conn. App.
(2023).

A.3d

,

In this opinion the other judges concurred.
1 Practice Book § 23-29 provides in relevant part: ‘‘The judicial authority
may, at any time, upon its own motion or upon motion of the respondent,
dismiss the petition, or any count thereof, if it determines that: (1) the court
lacks jurisdiction; (2) the petition, or a count thereof, fails to state a claim
upon which habeas corpus relief can be granted . . . (5) any other legally
sufficient ground for dismissal of the petition exists.’’

2 On July 1, 2011, General Statutes § 18-98e became effective and author-
ized the Commissioner of Correction, in his discretion, to award a maximum
of five days per month of RREC to reduce a sentence. In 2013, the legislature
amended General Statutes § 54-125a (b) (2), to preclude RREC from being
applied to advance the parole eligibility dates of certain incarcerated per-
sons. See Public Acts 2013, No. 13-3, § 59.

3 In its decision dismissing the action, the habeas court, citing to Perez
v. Commissioner of Correction, 326 Conn. 357, 163 A.3d 597 (2017), and
Petaway v. Commissioner of Correction, 160 Conn. App. 727, 125 A.3d 1053
(2015), cert. dismissed, 324 Conn. 912, 153 A.3d 1288 (2017), provided the
following reasons for dismissing the petition: ‘‘[T]he present petitioner’s
offense date precedes the enactment of RREC and the effective date of
[General Statutes] § 18-98e. Because the petitioner has no right to earn and
receive discretionary RREC, and any changes, alterations and even the total
elimination of RREC at the most can only revert the petitioner to the precise
measure of punishment in place at the time of the offense, the court con-
cludes that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the habeas corpus peti-
tion and that the petition fails to state a claim for which habeas corpus
relief can be granted.’’ (Emphasis in original.)

4 In Brown, our Supreme Court had directed this court to remand the
case to the habeas court with direction to first consider whether any grounds
existed for it to decline to issue the writ under Practice Book § 23-24.
Furthermore, in footnote 11 of its opinion, the court in Brown also stated:
‘‘We are aware that there are other cases pending before this court and the
Appellate Court that were decided without the benefit of this court’s decision
in Gilchrist [v. Commissioner of Correction, 334 Conn. 548, 561, 223 A.3d
368 (2020) (analyzing interplay between Practice Book §§ 23-24 and 23-29)].
In cases decided prior to Gilchrist, the most efficient process to
.
resolve those cases is to remand them to the habeas court to determine
first whether grounds exist to decline the issuance of the writ.’’ (Citation
omitted.) Brown v. Commissioner of Correction, supra, 345 Conn. 17 n.11.
5 Although the petitioner is no longer incarcerated, he is on probation

A.3d

until November 1, 2024. In response to an earlier order from this court
requesting simultaneous memoranda addressing why this appeal should not
be dismissed as moot because the petitioner no longer was incarcerated,
the respondent and the petitioner, like the parties in Leffingwell v. Commis-
sioner of Correction, 218 Conn. App.
(2023), submitted
a joint response arguing that the appeal was not moot in light of Dennis v.
Commissioner of Correction, 189 Conn. App. 608, 615–16, 208 A.3d 282
(2019), stating in relevant part: ‘‘The parties agree that if the petitioner were
to successfully prevail on his claim, the benefit to the petitioner would be
the retroactive modification of his definite sentence so as to incorporate
RREC .
. thereby advancing his effective release date from prison and
reducing the amount of time he is required to spend on [probation].’’ In
Dennis, this court cited to our Supreme Court’s decision in Murray v. Lopes,
205 Conn. 27, 529 A.2d 1302 (1987), in which, during the pendency of his
appeal from the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the
petitioner was released from confinement and began serving a period of
probation. Dennis v. Commissioner of Correction, supra, 615. In addressing
a mootness argument similar to that asserted in Dennis, we noted that our
Supreme Court in Murray had concluded that ‘‘the petitioner’s appeal was
not moot, despite his release from confinement, because, although no longer
‘confined,’ he was still serving the probationary portion of his sentence.’’
Id. The court in Murray reasoned that it could afford the petitioner practical
relief because an order directing the respondent to recalculate the petition-
er’s sentence with the credits sought by the petitioner would affect the
period of probation and result in the petitioner completing his probationary
period sooner by advancing his release date. Murray v. Commissioner of
Correction, supra, 30–31. Accordingly, the fact that the petitioner in this
case is on probation, and the petitioner in Leffingwell was serving a period
of special parole, does not impact our analysis of the respondent’s mootness
claims in this appeal. It is unclear why the respondent elected to change
its prior position.

6 ‘‘In Howard v. Commissioner of Correction, 217 Conn. App. 119, 287
A.3d 602 (2022), we expanded upon our reasoning in Hodge and Villafane.
In Howard, although counsel had been appointed for the petitioner, no
amended petition was filed prior to the habeas court dismissing the petition
sua sponte pursuant to Practice Book § 23-29 without providing notice and
an opportunity to be heard. Id., 132. This court concluded that the appoint-
ment of counsel alone provided a compelling reason not to apply footnote
11 of Brown, explaining: ‘Our Supreme Court has explained that the purpose
of appointing counsel in habeas actions, following the issuance of the writ,
is so that any potential deficiencies can be addressed in the regular course
after the proceeding has commenced. . . . In the present case, the habeas
court appointed counsel to represent the petitioner, and counsel will have
an opportunity to address any potential deficiencies in the original petition
that he filed in a self-represented capacity. In light of this fact, and the
length of time in which the habeas action has been pending on the court’s
docket, we conclude that permitting the court on remand to decline to issue
the writ pursuant to Practice Book § 23-24 could lead to an unjust outcome
that our Supreme Court would not have intended.’ . . . Id., 133.’’ Leffingwell
v. Commissioner of Correction, supra, 218 Conn. App.
