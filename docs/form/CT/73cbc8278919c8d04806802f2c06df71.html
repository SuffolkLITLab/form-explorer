FROM:  

All CSSD Staff 
July 1, 2006 
William H. Carbone, Executive Director 

t  is  my  pleasure  to  share  with  you  our  third  Court  Support  Services  Division 
(CSSD) Strategic Plan for FY 2006-09.  We have come a long way since our first 
plan  in  2000.    At  that  time,  the  Judicial  Branch  had  just  completed  a  year  long 
process of intense reorganization, and CSSD was created.  The Division was still 
developing new procedures and consolidating our new operational units when we 
decided to develop our first Strategic Plan.   

he  planning  process  began  in  1999  with  a  focus  group  project  that  collected 
feedback from our external and internal stakeholders and staff.  This information 
was used to create our first Vision, Mission and the Core Strategic Goals which 
have  guided  our  efforts  over  the  past  five  years  and  through  the  two  strategic 
plans which have been issued during that time.  The accomplishments of CSSD 
since then have been enormous.   

  CSSD initiated a new direction in the delivery of our assessment, supervision, 
monitoring and rehabilitation services for juvenile and adult clients, based on 
the principles of probation risk reduction and recidivism reduction as outlined 
in our strategic core goals.  The same best practice efforts have improved our 
handling  of  individuals,  families  and  children  in  our  family  civil  and  criminal 
work.   

  We  witnessed  a  tremendous  investment  in  resources  which  has  helped 
CSSD  achieve  our  goal  of  improving  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  our 
services as well as caseload reductions. Staff performance in many areas has 
improved,  and  we  are  able  to  provide  the  court  with  more  complete 
information,  more  quickly.  Funding  for  our  contracted  services  network  has 
grown  to  over  $80  million  to  support  expansions  that  address  service  gaps 
and to incorporate evidence based interventions and program models.

(cid:132)  The  CSSD  Training  Academy  was  created  which  delivers  a  full  schedule  of 
pre  and  in-service  training  as  well  as  professional  enhancement  and  skill 
building opportunities for supervisors and field staff.   

  Major  technology  advances  were  made  –  every  CSSD  employee  now  has 
access  to  computers  for  use  in  their  everyday  work.    We  successfully 
achieved  information  based  management  throughout  the  division  with  the 
implementation  of  our  automated  case  management  information  system 
(CMIS) and enhancements to quality assurance efforts.     

  Finally,  our  successes  have  been  recognized  with  national  accreditation 
awarded  to  Juvenile  Detention  and  Adult  Supervision  services.    Family 
Services  has  been  recognized  nationally  as  a  pioneer  in  providing  best 
practice interventions and development of research based assessment tools. 
We  have  made  great  strides  in  our  provision  of  gender  specific  services  for 
juveniles and young women in our system.   

or  the  development  of  the  FY  06/09  Strategic  Plan,  we  went  back  to  our 
stakeholders  for  an  updated  picture  of  where  the  agency  is  now.    In  December 
2005 we initiated another focus group project and held nine meetings with over 
100  representatives  of  line  and  supervisory  field  staff,  as  well  as  management 
which  included  Central  Office  Program  Managers,  Regional  Managers  and 
CSSD Administration from all of our business functions.  A summary of the focus 
group results is included in this document for your review.    

  think  that  you  will  agree  that  what  we  found  out  underscores  the  fact  that  our 
individual  business  units  have  come  together  under  CSSD,  acknowledging  the 
new principles and directions in criminal justice and family civil and criminal best 
practice that have been introduced over the past five years. We also learned that 
our  employees  are  clear  about 
to  providing  effective 
rehabilitative services to our clients as well as high quality and efficient services 
to the judges of the Superior Court.   The Plan format was changed to reflect the 
importance of planning and project management that we believe will be critical as 
we continue doing business in the 21st century.       

their  commitment 

  Section I contains the revised Mission and Vision Statements as well as the 
Core Strategic Goals.  The original six goals developed in 2000 have been 
revised and expanded to cover eight core strategic goal areas.  These were 
updated to reflect the ideas and comments from the focus groups which were 
discussed and reviewed by Executive Management.   

  Section II presents the Operational Initiatives for each of our business units, 

developed to accomplish the long term strategic goals for this planning cycle.  
I am particularly pleased with the planning process that went into the 
development of these initiatives; it was inclusive both within each unit and 

  (cid:132)

also across units to ensure collaboration and enhanced communication for 
the best possible project outcomes.   

he overall 2006-09 Strategic Plan effort reflects the input and hard work of our 

entire staff.  It is relevant to all to our employees as well.  Each business unit 
within CSSD – Adult, Juvenile, Juvenile Detention, Family, Operations, Staff 
Development and Administration – has an identified set of tasks and goals.  
Management and field staff have an important part to play in seeing that these 
goals are achieved.  The Plan is meant to be a “working” document that will be 
used to direct and evaluate our activities over the next three years and provide a 
framework for CSSD as we continue to consolidate and build on the successes 
of our present which will prepare us to face the challenges of the future.

CSSD Core Strategic Goals for the 2006-2009 Strategic Plan 

hese Core Strategic Goals describe the eight areas in which CSSD will concentrate its efforts over 
the next three years in order to achieve the Division’s Vision and Mission, which in turn supports the 
Mission of the Judicial Branch to resolve matters brought before it in a fair, timely and cost effective 
manner.  

1:  Supervision and Sanctions 
To promote compliance with court ordered conditions and sanctions through effective supervision practices. 
This includes implementation of activities to achieve recidivism reduction, services to victims and 
families and use of restorative sanctions.  

2:  Services and Interventions 
To provide the court with quality assessments and service alternatives that offer a continuum of evidence 
based program interventions that maximize positive outcomes for individuals, families and victims of crime. 
This includes utilization of research based services and assessments targeted to client needs in 
order to achieve risk reduction, resolve conflict and improve processing of court business. 

3:  Quality Assurance 
To maintain and strengthen the effectiveness of all operational and administrative functions through a 
comprehensive process that establishes consistent definitions of performance standards that are reinforced 
by ongoing management systems.  This includes implementation of best practices, training, technical 
assistance, coaching, and routine feedback to ensure fidelity to agency practices and processes.

To strengthen CSSD’s capacity to collect, analyze, disseminate and use information to measure results of 
service delivery and business functions. This includes but is not limited to evaluation of operations 
functions and contracted services, the conduct of research through literature reviews and 
development of formal relationships with researchers/academic institutions, and improved internal 
and external dissemination of research.    

5: Support of Staff    
To assure that each unit of CSSD and its staff have efficient tools and adequate support to achieve the 
agency’s goals and objectives. This includes but is not limited to improved implementation of data 
collection and information technology enhancements, reporting tools, and policy and procedure 
development and dissemination. 

6:  Community Based Service Delivery Network 
To develop, promote and integrate services in a public/private partnership that supports judicial decision 
making and provides assistance to individuals and families.  This recognizes the need to deliver a 
continuum of gender specific, culturally appropriate and research based services and includes 
identification of regional service gaps and underserved populations in order to address these 
issues.  

7:  Organizational Development 
To support and promote organizational proficiency by enhancing communication and collaboration, 
strengthening the infrastructure and fostering a diverse and dynamic workforce.    This goal focuses on 
strengthening internal communications, supporting collaborative efforts, emphasizing a team 
approach to integrating all units within CSSD and increasing public outreach and external 
stakeholder awareness of the agency’s projects and initiatives.   

8:  Professional Development 
To sustain and enhance a comprehensive program of professional development that promotes individual 
employee growth through training, mentoring, and career development.  This recognizes the need to 
provide an environment that encourages adequate opportunities for pursuit of individual career 
paths and staff retention.
