Introduction

Mediation is a confidential service that 
brings parents together with a mediator 
to work on solving their parenting 
differences in a positive way.  The parents’ 
role as the decision makers, when it comes 
to their children’s future, is very important 
to this process.  Taking part in the 
decision-making has positive and lasting 
results for parents and children.  Parents 
are more likely to stay with a parenting 
plan they have created together, instead of 
one that is decided for them by the Court.  

Research indicates that the successful 
adjustment of children during times of 
family-related stress is directly related to 
two factors:

	the level of cooperation between 

parents

	the continued involvement of both 

parents in their lives   

Mediation, therefore, encourages 
participants to see themselves as the co-
parents who share in the responsibility of 
their children’s future care.

What to Expect

The main goal of mediation is for parents 
to work together to find a solution to their 

parenting disputes.  The mediator tries to 
help parents to see beyond their personal 
feelings and focus on the interests and needs 
of their children. 

The mediator may provide educational 
information about:

	the needs of children at different 
stages in their development
	other ways to solve the parents’ 

issues

	the court process 

The role of the mediator is to provide a 
neutral, supportive environment while 
keeping in mind the importance of the 
children’s relationships with both parents.  
The main focus of the meetings is on the 
best interests of the children, while also 
considering the needs and wants of the 
parents.  Parents are encouraged to discuss 
their opinions about the children’s needs to 
try to find positive, successful solutions to 
their parenting concerns.  

How it Works

Mediation offered by CSSD-Family Services 
is a free service that parents can use either 
through a referral from the Court or at the 
direct request of both parents.  Family 
Services will review all requests and referrals 
before the start of mediation to decide if 

this is the best way to solve the parents’ 
differences and to make sure that it is safe 
for the two parents to meet together.  

To keep the parents’ main role as the 
decision-makers in this process, only the 
parents and the mediator(s) take part in 
the mediation.  It is possible to have up to 
three, 2-hour mediation sessions in all.

Mediation is a confidential service; 
therefore, what is said during the sessions 
is not discussed with attorneys or others.  
There are exceptions to this that the Family 
Relations Counselor will tell you about in 
the first session.

If you reach an agreement during the 
mediation, the terms of that agreement 
are given to the Court, the parents, and 
all attorneys involved in the case.  If the 
Court orders it, the agreement becomes 
legally binding on you.  If you do not 
reach an agreement during the mediation, 
a report is given to the Court with that 
information.  

Even if you do not come to an agreement, 
the mediation process is still valuable.  
Parents learn about different parenting 
plans, the developmental needs of their 
children, and what the Court expects them 
to do for their children.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
