Page 1 of 4 

 

 

          

         

 

 

   

 

 

 

UIFSA requires that the petition or accompanying documents include certain identifying information regarding the 
parties and child(ren) (e.g., residential address, social security number) unless a party alleges in an affidavit or a 
pleading under oath that the health, safety, or liberty of a party or child would be jeopardized by disclosure of such 
information.  In that event, the information must be sealed. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If a jurisdiction has reason to believe that information should not be released because of safety concerns, it should 
ensure that there is a nondisclosure finding or an allegation in an affidavit or the pleading that disclosure of identifying 
 
information would result in a risk of harm, as provided under section 312 of UIFSA.  In addition to identifying 
 
information included on this form, it may be appropriate to submit certain financial information under seal. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
• This form sent through EDE – Check if this form was sent through the Electronic Document Exchange (EDE).
 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

CSENet and EDE transactions are the recommended methods for making requests or sending information to 
another state.  If CSENet is not listed as an option on the form, then it cannot be used to convey any of the 
requests or information provided on the form. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Supporting documentation should be sent through EDE, whenever possible. 

 

Section 1.  Action: 
 

  

 

         

     

 

             

The following facts exist for this request: 
 
The obligee receives IV-D services from the requesting agency;
 
A tribunal in the requested state issued the support order; and
 

 
•
 
•
• Neither the obligor, the individual obligee, nor the child(ren) reside in the order-issuing state.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

NOTE:  The requesting agency should contact the order-issuing state and check federal resources (e.g., QUICK, the Federal 
 
Case Registry) prior to sending this form to ensure the limited grounds for UIFSA section 319(b) are met. 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pursuant to section 319(b) of UIFSA, the requesting agency asks that the support enforcement agency or tribunal in the 
 
order-issuing state change the payment location of its order to the requesting state’s state disbursement unit (SDU); and 
issue and send to the obligor’s employer either a conforming income withholding order or an administrative notice of change 
of payee, reflecting the redirected payments.  The order-issuing state’s laws will determine the appropriate authority and 
procedure.  The requesting agency also requests a copy of the tribunal order or administrative notice redirecting the support 
 
payments to the SDU in the requesting state, and a copy of the conforming income withholding order or administrative notice 
of change of payee. 
  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Check if the requesting agency seeks a certified arrears calculation (if available) or a payment record at the same
 
time the order-issuing state agency returns a copy of the tribunal order or administrative notice redirecting the
support payments and the conforming income withholding order or administrative notice of change of payee.  If you
 
are requesting an arrears calculation from the order-issuing state, you need to provide documentation of any
 
payment that the custodial party received that did not go through the order-issuing state's SDU.
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•
 

 

The requesting IV-D agency must provide the following information about the order (if known): 
 

 

Check if a copy of the existing support order is attached.  Attaching a copy may expedite the request where the case is non-
 
IV-D in the order-issuing state.
 

 

 

 

This section provides basic information about the obligee, to whom the requesting agency is providing IV-D services.  
Check the appropriate box to indicate if the obligee is the parent or caretaker.  Provide the obligee’s full legal name (first, 
 
middle, last, suffix).  If the obligee is the caretaker, indicate the caretaker’s relationship to the child(ren) (e.g., grandmother, 
 
cousin).  Check “Has legal custody/guardianship of child(ren)” if the caretaker has legal custody/guardianship of the 
child(ren).  This information is necessary to assist the order-issuing state’s agency identify the order for which the 
requesting IV-D agency seeks a change of payment location.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
