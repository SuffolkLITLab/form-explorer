INTRODUCTION

This pamphlet is designed to inform you of the basic 
steps in an Eviction (Summary Process) action. It is not 
a substitute for the advice of an attorney. The Judicial 
Branch is not responsible for any errors or omissions in 
this pamphlet. If you feel you need more information 
or assistance, you should either consult an attorney 
or read the appropriate sections of the Connecticut 
General Statutes and Connecticut Practice Book. The 
material in this booklet does not address the specific 
law pertaining to commercial property leases, and, 
therefore, should not be relied upon in cases involving 
commercial property disputes.

Note: This pamphlet refers to a single landlord, 
tenant or defendant for ease of reading only. 
Actual eviction cases may involve multiple
landlords, tenants and/or defendants. 

NOTICE TO QUIT

The first step in the Summary Process (Eviction) 
procedure is the Notice to Quit. The form you may 
use for the Notice to Quit, which the court will 
provide upon request, must be completed with the 
exact name and address, including the apartment 
number, floor number or other designation, if any, of 
each adult tenant you want to evict and must be signed 
by you as the landlord. There must be an original 
Notice to Quit and sufficient additional copies for 
each tenant who lives at the premises. You should 
also keep one copy for your records (see JD-HM-7 on 
page 14).

The Notice to Quit must include at least one reason 
for eviction. The most frequently used reasons are 
non-payment of rent and termination of lease by lapse  
of time. These materials are designed to assist you  
in those types of cases. Evictions for other reasons 
may be more complex cases and are not addressed  
in this publication.

The Notice to Quit must include the names of all 
adults living in the premises. If you know there are 
adults living in the premises, but you do not know 
their names, you may characterize them as John Doe 
and/or Jane Doe, as appropriate. 

The Notice to Quit must allow the tenant at least 3 
(three) full days to move. This means that there must 
be 3 (three) full days between the date the Notice 
to Quit is served on your tenant and the last day 
specified in the Notice to Quit for the tenant to vacate 
the premises.

1

The first and last days are not counted in computing the 3 
(three) days. (For example, if the Notice specifies that the 
tenant must move out by May 15, the state marshal must 
serve the Notice no later than May 11.)

Tenants have until midnight of the last day given to 
them in the Notice to Quit to vacate the premises before 
you may proceed with the Summons and Complaint, as 
explained below. 

Month-to-Month Tenancy. In nonpayment of rent 
situations involving oral or written month-to-
month tenancies, the Notice to Quit cannot be served 
until the tenth day after the date the rent was due, not 
counting the due date. (For example, if the rent is due 
on May 1, the Notice to Quit cannot be served until 
May 11.) 

The Notice to Quit may also be served during the month 
immediately following the nonpayment of rent in a 
month-to-month tenancy. (For example, if the rent due on 
May 1 is not paid, the Notice to Quit may be served at any 
time from May 11 through the end of June.)

Week-to-Week Tenancy. In nonpayment of rent situations 
involving oral or written week-to-week tenancies, 
the Notice to Quit cannot be served until the fifth day 
after the rent was due, not counting the due date. (For 
example, if the rent is due on May 10, the Notice to Quit 
cannot be served until May 15.)

The Notice to Quit may also be served during the week 
immediately following the nonpayment of rent

2

in a week-to-week tenancy. (For example, if the rent due 
on May 10 is not paid, the Notice to Quit may be served  
at any time from May 15 through the end of the next 
week, which would be May 23.) 

Lapse of Time. In cases when an oral or written lease 
has terminated by lapse of time (“without cause evic-
tion”), the tenant must be given at least 3 (three) full  
days and at least until the end of the time period he or 
she would normally have been entitled to vacate the 
premises. (For example, in an oral month-to-month lease 
running from May 1 to May 31, if the Notice to Quit is 
served on May 20, it must give the tenant at least until 
the last day of the month, which is May 31. If, however, 
the Notice to Quit is served on May 28, it must give the 
tenant until June 1 to vacate.)

The Notice to Quit must be formally served. Service by 
a state marshal will satisfy this requirement. The fee 
charged by the state marshal for service is approximately 
$35.00 to $45.00. After the state marshal serves the Notice 
to Quit, the original will be returned to you, with the state 
marshal’s completed return of service, indicating that 
service was made. 

SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT

If your tenant still has not moved after the last day given 
in the Notice to Quit, you must deliver to the clerk’s office 
the original Notice to Quit, the State Marshal’s Return  
of Service, and a completed Summons and Complaint

3

(see JD-HM-32 on page 15 for an example of a Summons 
and JD-HM-8 on page 16 for an example of a Complaint.) 
You will need to make 1 (one) original and a copy for each 
of the tenants/defendants. In addition, you should keep 
1 (one) copy of everything for your records. Be sure to 
indicate in the Complaint whether you and the defendant 
had an oral or written week-to-week, month-to-month, or 
year-to-year lease. 

You must return the completed Summons and 
Complaint to the court for the clerk’s review and 
signature on the Summons. Also, bring the original 
Notice to Quit with the State Marshal’s Return of 
Service. The clerk will set the return date on the 
Summons. The return date is a date from which certain 
time periods are measured, such as when the defendant 
must file an Appearance or a Pleading (Response). The 
return date can be any day of the week except Sundays 
and holidays. It is not necessary for you to appear in 
court on the return date because there will be no hearing 
on that date. After the clerk sets the return date and 
signs the Summons, you should keep 1 (one) copy of all 
papers for yourself and give the original and sufficient 
copies for each defendant to the state marshal, who will 
serve a copy on each defendant and return the original 
to you. The fee for this service is approximately $45.00 
to $60.00, depending on the number of people served, 
mileage cost, etc.

Once the state marshal returns the original Summons and 
Complaint to you with a completed Return of Service, 
you must file them, and the original Notice to Quit, with 
the clerk’s office at least 4 (four) days before the return

4

date on the Summons. When filing these papers, you 
must pay an entry fee to the clerk. As of the date of 
printing, this fee is $175.00. Payment must be made at the 
time of filing by cash or check payable to Clerk, Superior 
Court. 

Always have the case name and docket number available 
when inquiring about your case.

DEFAULT JUDGMENTS

The defendant has 2 (two) full days after the return date 
to file an Appearance in the case. If no Appearance is 
filed by the third day after the return date, you may file 
a Default Judgment for Failure to Appear (see JD-HM-9 
on page 18). In order to obtain the Default Judgment for 
Failure to Appear, you must file a Motion for Default 
Judgment for Failure to Appear and a Military Affidavit. 
The military affidavit must be signed in the presence of 
a notary, clerk, or Commissioner of the Superior Court. 
The clerk will give you this form. You must mail a copy 
of this Motion to the defendant and file the original 
with the court. Keep 1 (one) copy for your records. If no 
appearance is filed and all papers are in order, a judge 
may enter a Default Judgment in your favor without 
the necessity of a hearing. You will be notified by mail – 
please do not call the clerk’s office.

If, however, the defendant files only an Appearance but 
no response to your Complaint (pleading), you should 
file a Motion for Default Judgment for Failure to Plead (see  
JD-HM-10 on page 19). The clerk will give you this form. 

5

This Motion requires the defendant to file some type 
of response to your Complaint within 3 (three) days, 
not counting Sundays and holidays, after the Motion is 
filed with the clerk’s office. A copy of the Motion must 
be mailed to the defendant or the defendant’s attorney, if 
there is one, and the original must be filed with the court. 
Keep 1 (one) copy for your records. If no pleading is 
filed within this 3 (three)-day period and all papers are 
in order, a judge may enter a Default Judgment without 
the necessity of a hearing. You will be notified by mail –
please do not call the clerk’s office. 

When the defendant is represented by an attorney, all 
court documents must be sent to the attorney and not to 
the defendant. 

TRIALS

If the defendant files a response (pleading), you will 
receive a copy. If the pleading is an Answer and Special 
Defense(s), you must file with the clerk a Reply to the 
Special Defense(s), and mail a copy to the defendant 
or the defendant’s attorney. The clerk will give you the 
form. A trial will then be scheduled at which time the 
case may be heard by a judge. You will be notified of the 
date and time of the hearing by mail. It is important to 
be on time and bring all witnesses, receipts, and related 
documents to the hearing or else you may lose your 
case for lack of proof. If a witness will not come to court 
voluntarily, you may apply for a subpoena at the clerk’s

6

office at least 2 (two) days before the scheduled hearing 
date. If a judge grants the application, a subpoena will 
be issued. The subpoena must be served on your witness 
at least 18 (eighteen) hours before your hearing date and 
time. The state marshal will charge you a fee to serve the 
subpoena.

On the day of the trial, your case will be called by the 
courtroom clerk. When your case is called, tell the clerk 
that you are present. After your case is called, you will 
meet with a specially trained Housing Mediator who 
will discuss the case with you and the defendant. The 
Housing Mediator will assist you and the defendant in 
working out a fair settlement. If you and the defendant 
agree on a settlement, the agreement will be reviewed by 
the judge. If it is approved by the judge, it will be entered 
on the record as a “Stipulated Judgment.” You will be 
given a copy of the agreement, which you should keep.

You are under no obligation to settle your case. If you 
do not work out an agreement, there will be a trial. The 
judge will hear the case and make a decision based 
on all of the evidence presented. The judge will either 
announce the decision in court, or you will be notified  
by mail.

EXECUTION

If a judgment for immediate possession is entered in your 
favor, either by default or after a hearing, the defendant has 
a 5 (five)-day stay of execution, not counting intervening 
Sundays, legal holidays, and the date of judgment.

7

However, in cases of nonpayment only, the defendant 
can apply to the court for up to an additional 3 (three) 
months in which to stay, if the full amount of the back 
rent and/or use and occupancy is paid to the court 
within 5 (five) days of judgment, and an Application for 
a Stay of Execution is filed. In cases of termination of lease 
by lapse of time, the defendant can file an Application for 
Stay of Execution for up to an additional 6 (six) months 
from the date of judgment. A hearing will be scheduled 
to establish the actual amount of time the defendant will 
receive, if any, and the conditions, if any. You will be 
notified by mail of the date and time of the hearing on 
the Application for a Stay of Execution.

If the defendant has neither vacated the premises 
after the 5 (five) full days expire, nor applied for an 
additional stay, as outlined above, you may obtain from 
the clerk’s office a Summary Process Execution (see 
JD-HM-2 on page 20). The execution must be completed 
by you and given to the clerk for signature. After the 
execution is returned to you, you must give it to a state 
marshal for service on the defendant. The execution 
requires the defendant to vacate the premises within 
at least 24 (twenty-four) hours, or else be physically 
removed from the premises. If the defendant’s 
possessions and personal effects are also not removed, 
they will be removed by the marshal and stored. If the 
defendant does not claim those belongings, they may be 
sold by the town.

In order to obtain an Execution in cases where a 
payment condition of a stipulated judgment has been 
violated, you must file an Affidavit of Non-Compliance, 
available at the clerk’s office, stating exactly which 
payment has not been made (see JD-HM-22 on page 21). 
You may also file a completed Execution form at this

8

time. You must immediately mail a copy of the affidavit to 
the defendant or the defendant’s attorney. An execution 
will not issue until the third business day after the filing of 
the affidavit.

If the defendant files an Objection, a hearing may be 
scheduled. If no Objection is filed, an Execution may  
be signed and issued to you at the appropriate time.

In cases where a non-monetary condition of a stipulated 
judgment has been violated, an affidavit must be filed 
stating the condition that was violated. A hearing before 
the judge may be scheduled. The judge will decide 
whether an execution should issue. 

An execution may only issue for six months from the 
date of judgment or from the termination date of a court-
approved stay of execution, whichever is later.

LAWYER REFERRAL SERVICE

If you need additional assistance, legal advice, or legal 
representation, you should consult an attorney. You 
may obtain an attorney by contacting a Lawyer Referral 
Service office. (See Appendix IV for a listing of Lawyer 
Referral Service offices.)

Note:

1. If  there  is  more  than  1  (one)  plaintiff,  all  plain-
tiffs may be required to sign pleadings and to appear for 
all proceedings.

2. Only the clerk’s offices of the Housing Sessions are
authorized by C.G.S. §51-52(d) to assist parties  
representing themselves.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
