Biennial Report and Statistics 2006 - 2008

To the Governor, General Assembly  
and the Residents of Connecticut

It is with great pleasure that I present to you this Biennial Report on the Connecticut Judicial Branch for 
the years 2006-2008. In it, we celebrate the 200th anniversary of  the Supreme Court, and I hope that 
you enjoy the photos and reproductions of  postcards that are placed throughout the publication.

You will find that the past two years have brought tremendous change to the Branch, both for the 
judiciary and for the thousands of  individuals who use our courts. Since becoming Chief  Justice in 
April 2007, I have witnessed first-hand the extraordinary work done by our judges and employees. 
Of  special note is the development of  the Judicial Branch’s first-ever strategic plan, crafted by the 
Public Service and Trust Commission that I appointed shortly after becoming Chief  Justice. This 
impressive blueprint for progress will guide us over the next three to five years.

Yet our core values remain the same: to provide each and every person who walks into our courts 
a fair and impartial forum, with a judge who makes his or her ruling based on the facts of  the case 
and the rule of  law. I am extremely proud of  our judges, who ensure that this basic constitutional 
safeguard and right is applied every day.

This task has grown more difficult as our resources have diminished throughout the State’s ongoing 
financial crisis. Rest assured, however, that the Judicial Branch remains committed to serving the 
thousands of  people who seek redress through our courts every year. 

I recognize that the next couple of  years will be challenging and I look forward to working with the 
Executive and Legislative Branches of  government to meet these challenges.

 

 
 

 

 
 

Very truly yours,

Chase T. Rogers 
Chief  Justice

Connecticut Judicial Branch

To the Governor, General Assembly  
and the Residents of Connecticut

I first want to say what a great honor it is to serve as Connecticut’s Chief  
Court Administrator. We have accomplished a great deal over the past two 
years, and I am pleased to present this 2006-2008 Biennial Report to you.

Our greatest achievement has been the development of  a strategic plan 
that already has led to concrete and visible improvements at courthouses 
throughout the state. By way of  background, Chief  Justice Chase T. Rogers 
in 2007 appointed a 42-member Public Service and Trust Commission. 
She charged it with the task of  creating a strategic plan to enhance the 
public’s  trust  and  confidence  in  the  Judicial  Branch  by  improving  the 
services offered to the thousands of  people who interact with the Branch 
every day. In response, commission members obtained input from those 
who interact with the Branch, judges and Branch employees through more 
than 90 focus groups, two public hearings and two surveys.

From this input, commission members created the strategic plan, which Chief  Justice Rogers approved. 
We are now in the first phase of  implementing many improvements, and the challenge is both exciting 
and daunting. We look forward to providing regular updates in the Judicial Branch’s website.

We also face the challenge during these economic times of  properly distributing our resources 
so that we may best meet all of  the responsibilities that fall to the Branch. Our job has become 
increasingly complex as legislation is enacted, seeking to address some of  society’s problems through 
the courts. It is essential that we have the resources to implement these policies; otherwise I fear 
that good intent will fall short of  effective action.

In a time of  tight budgets and scarce resources, we at the Judicial Branch recognize the necessity 
of  working together to accomplish what is in the best interests of  the people we serve. To that 
end, we look forward to continuing to work with you.

 

 
 

 

 
 

Very truly yours, 

Barbara M. Quinn
Chief  Court Administrator

         he Supreme Court is the state’s highest court. It consists of  the Chief  
      Justice and six Associate Justices. A panel of  five justices hears and decides 
  each case. On occasion, the Chief  Justice summons the court to sit en banc 
as a full court of  seven to hear particularly important cases.

The Supreme Court reviews rulings made in the Superior Court to determine 
if  any errors of  law have occurred, as well as rulings of  the Appellate Court.

History of the Supreme Court Building

As our nation entered the 20th century, pressure mounted in Hartford and 
across the State of  Connecticut for a building that would provide the much-
needed space for the State Library and Supreme Court. Further, the citizenry 
and its leaders believed that the building should also serve as a monumental 
edifice to the legal, historical and intellectual fabric of  Connecticut.

With this in mind, noted New York Architect Donn Barber created an  
imposing structure of  Italian Renaissance design, with symbolic statuary 
groups above the portico, that is reached by wide steps from the street level. 

The building opened in 1909. At the laying of  the cornerstone Chief   
Justice Simeon E. Baldwin said, “Set by itself, in all the majestic dignity 
which architecture can command, is rising before our eyes the splendid 
home which Connecticut has prepared for her highest court of  justice  
and for the books that teach what justice is and give it form.” The  
magnificent granite structure faces north on Capitol Avenue, directly  
across the street from the State Capitol, which was erected in 1878.

The statuary above the building features four female figures by 
noted French sculptor Michel Louis Tonnetti, whose works  
include statues in the Library of  Congress and on the facades 
of  the New York Public Library. The figures, Justice, History, 
Art and Science, were added to the building in October 1913.

The West Wing of  the building contains the Supreme Court 
courtroom and the Justices’ chambers while the East Wing 
houses the Library. The Museum of  Connecticut History  
occupies Memorial Hall, which is located between the two wings.

The Supreme Court courtroom is 43 feet wide, 56 feet long 
and 35 feet high. Two murals by Albert Herter accentuate the 
stately courtroom. Behind the bench is The Signing of  the Fun-
damental Orders of  the Constitution 1638-39. Included in the mural are 
famous Connecticut founders Thomas Hooker, Roger Ludlow and John 
Haynes. The other mural, An Allegory of  Education, covers the ceiling of  
the courtroom and provides a visually enlightening metaphor.

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the 
Supreme Court During the Biennium

Batte-Holmgren v. Commissioner of  Public Health, 281 
Conn. 277 (2007).

State v. Davis, 283 Conn. 280 (2007). 
Continued

In this case, the plaintiff  restaurant owners claimed that an 
amendment to General Statutes § 19a-342 that prohibited 
smoking in restaurants, cafes and other public facilities, but 
not in casinos and most private clubs, violated the equal pro-
tection provisions of  the state and federal constitutions. The 
trial court granted the defendants’ motion to strike the com-
plaint on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to make  
allegations sufficient to establish an equal protection violation. 
The court then rendered judgment for the defendants. On 
appeal to this court, the majority concluded that the state had 
a rational basis for excluding private clubs from the smoking 
ban because club members had a legitimate expectation that 
they would be able to maintain their privacy and establish 
conditions for the operation of  the club that suited their 
needs and desires. The majority further concluded that the 
state had a rational basis for excluding casinos because the 
state reasonably could have believed that enforcement of  the 
ban would be unduly complicated by the sovereign status of  
the tribes that own and operate the casinos. Accordingly, the 
majority concluded that the amendment was constitutional 
and affirmed the judgment of  the trial court. In his dissent-
ing opinion, Justice Sullivan argued that the amendment was 
unconstitutional because the exemption of  the private clubs 
and casinos was not rationally related to the statute’s purpose 
of  protecting employees from the adverse health effects of  
secondhand smoke.

State v. Davis, 283 Conn. 280 (2007).

The principal issue in this appeal was whether a criminal 
defendant has a right under article first, § 7, of  the state con-
stitution to challenge the legality of  a search, notwithstanding 
the fact that the defendant had no reasonable expectation 
of  privacy in the subject of  the search, if  the defendant (1) 
was legitimately on the searched premises or (2) was charged 
with an offense of  which possession of  the seized item is an 
element (the automatic standing doctrine). The United States 
Supreme Court had adopted both of  these constitutional 
rules in Jones v. United States, 263 U.S. 257, 80 S. Ct. 725, 4 L. 
Ed. 2d 697 (1960). That court subsequently abandoned the

“legitimately on the premises” doctrine in Rakas v. Illinois, 
439 U.S. 128, 143, 99 S. Ct. 421, 58 L. Ed. 2d 387 (1978), and 
overruled the automatic standing doctrine in United States v. 
Salvucci, 448 U.S. 83, 95, 100 S. Ct. 2547, 65 L. Ed. 2d 619 
(1980). The defendant in Davis urged this court to adopt 
both doctrines as a matter of  state constitutional law. This 
court concluded that the state constitution embodied neither 
the automatic standing doctrine nor the legitimately on the 
premises doctrine.

Fish v. Fish, 285 Conn. 24 (2008).

This appeal involved a custody dispute over a minor child. 
After a protracted custody battle, the trial court awarded 
joint custody to the child’s mother and the child’s paternal 
aunt and directed that the child’s primary residence be with 
the aunt. The Appellate Court affirmed the custody award 
and the child’s father appealed to this court, claiming that 
the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant the aunt’s motion 
to intervene in the proceedings and improperly had awarded 
custody to her because she had failed to prove by clear and 
convincing evidence that she had a relationship with the 
child akin to that of  a parent and that the child would suffer 
real and substantial emotional harm if  the aunt were not 
awarded custody. The father contended that this jurisdictional 
standard, which applies to cases involving third party requests 
for visitation under this court’s decision in Roth v. Weston, 259 
Conn. 202 (2002), also applied to cases involving third party 
requests for custody. The majority concluded that, to avoid 
constitutional infirmity in the custody statutes, a third party 
seeking custody of  a child must allege, as a standing prereq-
uisite, the he or she has a parent-like relationship with the 
child. The majority also concluded, however, that, because 
the primary focus in custody proceedings is on the welfare of  
the child rather than the rights of  the parents, and because, 
in custody proceedings, the parents themselves have placed 
their rights in issue, the Roth standard did not apply. Rather, 
to prevail on a custody request, a third party must prove by a 
preponderance of  the evidence that he or she has a parent-
like relationship with the child, that parental custody clearly

would be detrimental to the child and, upon a finding of   
detriment, that third party custody would be in the child’s 
best interest. Because the trial court had not applied this 
standard, the majority reversed the judgment awarding  
custody to the child’s aunt and remanded the case for further 
proceedings. Justice Katz authored a concurring opinion, 
in which Justices Borden and Palmer joined, arguing that, 
because third party custody orders are more intrusive on 
parental rights than third party visitation orders, the Roth 
standard should apply to such orders.

State v. Randolph, 284 Conn. 328 (2007).

The defendant in this case was convicted of  one count of  
felony murder, two counts of  robbery in the first degree, one 
count of  conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree 
and one count of  criminal possession of  a firearm. The 
dispositive issue on appeal to this court was whether the trial 
court improperly had consolidated for trial two separate cases 
against the defendant and instructed the jury that the evidence 
in each case was cross admissible under the common scheme 
or plan exception to the rule barring evidence of  uncharged 
misconduct. This court noted that there had been some 
confusion in the cases applying the common scheme or plan 
exception as to what factors governed the admissibility of  
the evidence. Some cases had held that, to be admissible, 
the prior misconduct must imply an overall scheme or plan 
in the defendant’s mind, while other cases had held that the 
misconduct must be so similar to the charged conduct that it 
gives rise to an inference that the person who engaged in the 
prior conduct also committed the charged crime. This court 
clarified that, when evidence of  prior misconduct is admitted 
on the basis of  its similarity to the charged conduct, the state 
must produce evidence sufficient to support an inference 
that both crimes were related to an overall goal in the defen-
dant’s mind. Because the state had not met that burden, this 
court concluded that the trial court improperly had admitted 
the evidence and the defendant was entitled to a new trial.

The defendant in this case was convicted of  kidnapping in 
the second degree, unlawful restraint in the first degree and 
risk of  injury to a child. On appeal to this court, the defen-
dant claimed, inter alia, that this court should reconsider its 
holding in State v. Luurtsema, 262 Conn. 179 (2002), that a 
person may be convicted of  kidnapping even though the 
restraint involved in the kidnapping is incidental to the com-
mission of  another offense. The majority agreed and con-
cluded that, to be convicted of  kidnapping in conjunction 
with another crime, a defendant must have intended to pre-
vent the victim’s liberation for a longer period of  time or to a 
greater degree than was necessary to commit the other crime. 
Because the jury had not been instructed under this newly 
adopted standard, the majority reversed the defendant’s 
conviction on the kidnapping charge and ordered a new trial. 
In a concurring opinion, Justice Borden argued that, because 
the majority’s analysis was premised on a very slight ambigu-
ity in the kidnapping statute, it brought into question the 
constitutionality of  General Statutes § 1-2z, which prohibits 
courts from consulting legislative history when interpreting 
unambiguous statutes. In a concurring and dissenting opin-
ion joined by Justices Vertefeuille and Sullivan, Justice Zarella 
disagreed with the standard adopted by the majority and 
argued that unlawful restraint requires the state to prove a 
general intent to restrain the victim while kidnapping requires 
the state to prove a specific intent to prevent the victim’s 
liberation by specified means. 

Finan v. Finan, 287 Conn. 491 (2008).

The principal issue in this appeal was whether a trial court 
fashioning financial orders in a dissolution case may consider 
a party’s preseparation dissipation of  marital assets. This court 
concluded that an action that occurred prior to a couple’s 
physical separation may be treated as the dissipation of  marital 
assets as long as the action was taken: (1) in contemplation of  
divorce or separation; or (2) when the marriage was in serious 
jeopardy or undergoing an irretrievable breakdown.

Connecticut Judicial Branch

Curry v. Allan S. Goodman, Inc., 286 Conn. 390 (2008).

State v. DeJesus, 288 Conn. 418 (2008). Continued

The plaintiff  in this case brought an action claiming that the 
defendant, his former employer, had discriminated against 
him on the basis of  his physical disability in violation of  
General Statutes § 46a-60. The trial court granted the defen-
dant’s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the 
plaintiff  had not established a prima facie case that he was 
qualified for the position that he sought or that the defen-
dant had failed to accommodate his disability as required by  
§ 46a-60. On appeal, this court addressed as a threshold 
question whether employers are required to provide reasonable
accommodations to disabled employees under § 46a-60 
and concluded that they are. Once a disabled employee has 
requested a reasonable accommodation, the employer must 
engage in an informal and interactive discussion with the  
employee to identify the employee’s limitations and poten-
tial accommodations by the employer. Because there was 
evidence that the defendant had refused to engage in this 
process, as well as evidence that the plaintiff  was capable of  
performing his job even without any accommodation, this 
court concluded that there was a genuine issue of  material 
fact as to whether the defendant had discriminated against 
the plaintiff  and reversed the judgment of  the trial court.

State v. DeJesus, 288 Conn. 418 (2008).

On appeal from his conviction of  two counts of  sexual 
assault in the first degree, the defendant claimed that this 
court should reconsider the liberal standard for admission 
of  uncharged misconduct in sexual assault cases, which had 
been incorporated into the Connecticut Code of  Evidence 
as one aspect of  the scheme or plan exception to the rule 
barring evidence to prove a defendant’s criminal tendencies. 
He further contended that the Code of  Evidence, which had 
been adopted by the judges of  the Superior Court, was not 
binding on this court. The majority concluded that, although 
the language of  the Code of  Evidence was ambiguous as to 
whether the judges had intended to divest this court of  its  
inherent authority to change and develop the rules of  
evidence, the history surrounding the adoption of  the code 
demonstrated that they had not intended to do so. The 
majority then concluded that, although, under this court’s 
decision in State v. Randolph, 284 Conn. 328 (2007), discussed 
above, uncharged misconduct in sexual assault cases gener-
ally is not admissible to establish a common scheme or plan, 
there is a limited exception in sex crime cases to the rule 
barring the admission of  evidence of  uncharged misconduct 
to establish propensity when the state demonstrates that the 
evidence is relevant and its probative value outweighs its 
prejudicial effects. Accordingly, the majority affirmed the

judgment of  conviction on the sexual assault charges. In 
a concurring opinion, Justice Palmer argued that the Code 
of  Evidence unambiguously was not intended to divest 
this court of  its authority to modify the rules of  evidence 
and that the judges of  the Superior Court would have no 
constitutional authority to do so. Joined by Justice Sullivan, 
Justice Zarella authored a concurring opinion in which he 
also argued that the judges of  the Superior Court have no 
constitutional authority to divest this court of  its power to 
modify evidentiary rules. He disagreed, however, with Justice 
Palmer’s conclusion that this court’s power to modify rules 
of  evidence and its power to make procedural rules were 
analogous. Justice Katz issued a dissenting opinion in which 
she argued that the Code of  Evidence was intended to divest 
this court of  its power to modify evidentiary rules and that 
the judges of  the Superior Court had the constitutional  
authority to do so.

Kerrigan v. Commissioner of  Public Health, 289 Conn. 
135 (2008).

In this appeal, the plaintiffs, eight same sex couples, chal-
lenged the constitutionality of  the state statutory prohibition 
against same sex marriage under the state constitution. The 
majority concluded that sexual orientation is a quasi-suspect 
classification under the state constitution and, therefore, the 
state was required to demonstrate that the prohibition on 
same sex marriage was necessary to the achievement of  a 
compelling state interest. The majority also concluded that 
the state had not met that burden. Accordingly, the majority 
concluded that the statutory ban on same sex marriage was 
unconstitutional. Justice Borden issued a dissenting opinion 
in which he argued that sexual orientation is not a suspect 
classification under the state constitution and that the statu-
tory ban on same sex marriage satisfied rational basis review. 
Justice Vertefeuille joined Justice Borden’s dissenting opinion 
and issued a separate dissenting opinion in which she argued 
that the plaintiffs had not met their burden of  proving that 
the statutory ban on same sex marriage was unconstitutional 
beyond a reasonable doubt. Justice Zarella issued a dissent-
ing opinion in which he argued that, because the purpose of  
the laws governing traditional marriage between one man 
and one woman was to privilege and regulate procreation, 
same sex couples and opposite sex couples were not similarly 
situated with respect to those laws and the equal protection 
provisions of  the state constitution were not implicated. He 
further argued that the ban on same sex marriage satisfied  
rational basis review under substantive due process principles.

 he Appellate Court, like the Supreme Court, reviews decisions of  the 

 
  Superior Court to determine if  errors of  law have occurred.

There are 10 Appellate Court judges, one of  whom is designated by the 
Chief   Justice  to  be  the  Chief   Judge.  Generally,  three  judges  hear  and 
decide a case, although the court also may sit en banc, which means that 
the entire court participates in the decision.

Connecticut Judicial Branch

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the 
Appellate Court During the Biennium
Blasko v. Commissioner of  Revenue Services, 98 Conn. 
App. 439 (2006). Continued

State v. Khadijah, 98 Conn. App. 409 (2006), appeal 
dismissed, 284 Conn. 429 (2007).

The defendant was charged with possession of  narcotics, 
possession of  a controlled substance (less than four ounces 
of  marijuana) and risk of  injury to a child. Following the 
defendant’s failure to appear in court for the second day of  
jury selection, the state, by substitute information, added 
a charge of  failure to appear in the first degree. The state 
nolled the first three counts of  the information, and the case 
proceeded on the charge of  failure to appear. The defendant 
testified at trial that she was working two jobs at the time of  
the court appearance. When she returned home from one 
of  the jobs at 8:00 a.m., she sat on her couch and asked her 
boyfriend to wake her, should she inadvertently fall asleep. 
At some point, she did fall asleep and did not wake until her 
attorney telephoned her from the courthouse. The defendant 
immediately departed for the court and arrived later that 
morning. The jury returned a verdict of  guilty on the count 
of  wilful failure to appear in the first degree. The defendant 
appealed this conviction to the Appellate Court, arguing that 
the evidence was insufficient to establish that she wilfully 
failed to appear at jury selection in her criminal trial. In 
reversing the defendant’s conviction, the Appellate Court 
noted that working late the night before a court appearance, 
pursuant to a regularly kept work schedule, failing to set 
an alarm clock or asking a friend to awaken her from a 
potentially inadvertent doze does not amount to purposefully 
and intentionally absenting oneself  from the courthouse. 

Blasko v. Commissioner of  Revenue Services, 98 Conn. 
App. 439 (2006).

The defendant, the commissioner of  revenue services, 
appealed from the judgment of  the trial court determining 
that the plaintiffs were entitled to claim and use the 
Connecticut alternative minimum tax credit accrued from 
1997 to reduce their Connecticut income tax liability for 1998. 
In affirming the judgment of  the trial court, the Appellate 
Court considered the threshold issue of  the plaintiffs’ 
eligibility to apply a tax credit for taxes paid on “deemed” 
income, not actually received, when that income was actually 
realized and taxed as ordinary income in the following year. 
This required an analysis of  General Statutes § 12-700a (d) 
(2), which provides that the credit allowable for a taxable 
year is limited under this subdivision to the amount, if  any, 
by which the tax imposed under § 12-700, less the credit, if  
any, allowed under General Statutes § 12-704, exceeds the 
“Connecticut minimum tax,” determined without regard to 
whether the individual is subject to and required to pay for 
that taxable year the federal alternative minimum tax under

§ 55 of  the Internal Revenue Code, less the credit, if  any, 
allowed under subsection (e) of  § 12-700a. The plaintiffs 
argued that § 12-700a (d) (2) is written in such a way that it is 
impossible that their regular Connecticut income tax liability 
for a given year, which is roughly 4.5 percent of  their federal 
adjusted gross income, will ever exceed their Connecticut 
minimum tax, which is based on roughly 5 percent of  their 
federal adjusted alternative minimum taxable income and, 
therefore, they will never be able to recoup the credit. The 
Appellate Court agreed that § 12-700a (d) (2), on its face, 
appears to create a mathematical impossibility or, at best, 
a profound improbability that an individual taxpayer will 
ever be able to recoup a credit in subsequent years. Since 
the plaintiffs will not, in all likelihood, recoup the credit 
earned in 1997, the plaintiffs effectively were taxed twice 
on the same income by the same taxing authority. Because 
the intended purpose of  § 12-700a (d) (2), as amended in 
1997, was to bring the Connecticut alternative minimum tax 
into conformity with the federal alternative minimum tax 
scheme, as well as to avoid the possibility of  double taxation 
by the same taxing authority, the trial court properly applied 
General Statutes § 12-730 in granting equitable relief  to the 
plaintiffs on the basis of  the factual record before the court.

State v. Russell, 101 Conn. App. 298, cert. denied, 284 
Conn. 910 (2007).

The defendant and the victim met in 2001 and dated on 
again, off  again, until January, 2003, when the victim broke 
off  the relationship. The victim obtained a protective order 
barring the defendant from having contact with her. In October 
of  2003, the defendant went to a remote campsite where the 
victim, a Girl Scout leader, was on an outing with the Girl 
Scout troop. In January of  2004, the defendant entered the 
victim’s home when she was not present. The defendant was 
charged with two counts of  violation of  a protective order, 
two counts of  stalking in the third degree and one count of  
burglary in the third degree in connection with these incidents. 
The files pertaining to the campground incident and the 
home entry incident were consolidated for trial. Following 
trial, the defendant was convicted of  the aforementioned 
charges. On appeal, the Appellate Court held, inter alia, that 
the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant’s convic-
tion for stalking in the third degree in violation of  General
Statutes § 53a-181e in connection with the campground inci-
dent. Specifically, the jury reasonably could have found that 
the defendant’s presence at the campsite was a purposeful 
maneuver to place himself  near the victim, i.e., that he acted

wilfully. Although the defendant had testified that the 
encounter with the victim was mere coincidence, the jury was 
free to find that testimony not credible and to infer, from the 
other evidence presented, that the defendant’s presence was 
wilful. Further, the evidence established that the defendant 
was sufficiently proximate to the victim, for a long enough 
period of  time, to establish following as required by statute. 
In particular, undisputed testimony established that the 
defendant was within twenty-five feet of  the victim, with no 
obstacles between them, thus establishing physical proximity. 
The victim’s testimony that she saw the defendant established 
visual proximity, regardless of  the lack of  evidence that 
the defendant looked directly back at her. The ten minutes 
that the defendant was present at the campsite constituted 
a substantial enough period of  time to establish following 
under the statute. The Court rejected the defendant’s 
contention that the campground incident and a prior incident 
occurring seven months earlier, in which the defendant 
was outside the victim’s window, were too remote in time 
to establish that he followed the victim “repeatedly,” as the 
statute contains no explicit requirements as to the temporal 
interval between acts. The Appellate Court further held that 
the evidence was insufficient to prove that the defendant 
committed burglary in the second degree in connection with 
the home entry incident. With regard to that incident, the 
state charged that the defendant entered the victim’s house 
with the intent to commit a crime therein, i.e., to criminally 
violate a protective order by entering the house. In reversing 
the judgment of  conviction as to burglary, the court held that 
the state had charged and prosecuted the defendant solely on 
the basis of  the predicate offense of  violating a protective 
order by entering a dwelling and that this was not a legally 
cognizable formulation of  the crime of  burglary. The court 
held that the crime of  trespass or any other crime comprised 
of  breaking and entering actions may not be considered 
by the court to be the predicate crime whose intended 
commission within a dwelling forms the basis of  a burglary 
charge, because a defendant necessarily commits those 
crimes when committing burglary. The Appellate Court also 
rejected claims of  jury instructional error and evidentiary 
impropriety raised by the defendant.

Wyatt Energy, Inc. v. Motiva Enterprises, LLC, 104 
Conn. App. 685 (2007), cert denied, 286 Conn. 901 (2008).

In 1999, the plaintiff, Wyatt Energy, Inc., decided to solicit pur-
chasers for its New Haven gasoline distribution terminal.
At that time, Wyatt was in the second year of  a ten year  
contract (terminalling agreement) that granted to the defen- 
dants certain exclusive and nonexclusive rights to the use of  
its New Haven deepwater terminal. Williams Energy Services 
made an offer to purchase the Wyatt terminal, but Motiva 
Enterprises, LLC, as the assignee of  one of  the defendants 
under the terminalling agreement, had a contractual right of

first refusal to purchase. While the sale negotiations were 
pending between Wyatt and Williams, Motiva purchased 
a competing terminal facility located in New Haven and, 
subsequently, Motiva declined to purchase the Wyatt terminal. 
When Wyatt sold its terminal to Williams, it did not make 
the sale subject to Motiva’s rights to use the terminal under 
the terminalling agreement. Wyatt then brought this action 
against the defendants to recover damages for negligent mis-
representation, fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of  con-
tract, breach of  implied covenant of  good faith and fair deal-
ing, and violations of  the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices 
Act (CUTPA) and the Connecticut Antitrust Act. Motiva filed 
an answer, special defenses and a counterclaim to Wyatt’s 
complaint, one count of  which alleged breach of  contract. In 
response, Wyatt asserted a special defense of  illegality arising 
from Motiva’s claimed antitrust violations. The court, holding 
that the illegality defense failed as a matter of  law because 
the terminalling agreement was capable of  execution without 
violating the law, granted summary judgment for Motiva on 
Wyatt’s illegality defense and the case proceeded to trial.

In reversing the judgment of  the trial court, the Appellate 
Court noted that the trial court had relied upon the general 
rule that the unlawfulness of  a contract is usually deter-
mined as of  the time of  its making and is not affected by 
subsequent changes of  facts. However, in this case, in which 
antitrust violations were alleged as a special defense, the 
legality of  the terminalling agreement and the determina-
tion concerning its capability of  being performed lawfully 
could not be ascertained by looking only to the time of  its 
formation. Assessing the legality of  a contract only at the 
time of  its formation would undermine the policies behind 
the antitrust statutes. The Appellate Court further noted 
that unlawful control over a given market area need not arise 
from only one contract or acquisition. On the contrary, the 
more likely scenario is that such illicit control results from 
a series of  contracts or acquisitions which, at some point in 
the progression, cause one party to possess an unreasonable 
power over a defined market. A contract that provides for 
exclusive marketing rights over a certain terminal might not 
violate the antitrust laws at the time of  its formation. That 
initial contract, however, arguably could become violative of  
those same laws when one of  the contracting parties later 
gains unlawful dominance and control by the purchase of  a 
competing facility within the same market. Such an accretion 
of  market power, subsequent to the formation of  the first 
contract, is the evil that the antitrust laws prohibit.

The court concluded that there was a reasonable issue of  fact 
about whether there was a relevant market and whether  
Motiva’s purchase of  a competing terminal gave Motiva  
monopoly dominance over that market and remanded for a 
new trial.

THE STATE JUDICIARY

Judges rule on the basis of law,  
not public opinion, and they 
should be totally indifferent to 
pressures of the times. 
The Honorable Warren E. Burger, 
Former Chief Justice, U.S. Supreme Court

It  has  been  a  time  of   great  change  within  Connecti-
cut’s judiciary, beginning in April 2007, when the Hon-
orable Chase T. Rogers became the state’s 37th Chief  
Justice  of   the  State  of   Connecticut.  The  ceremonial 
swearing  in  occurred  on  June  14,  2007,  and  brought 
together Governor M. Jodi Rell, who nominated Chief  
Justice  Rogers,  and  the  Honorable  Ellen  Ash  Peters, 
who served as Connecticut’s first female Chief  Justice 
from 1984 through 1996.

Chief  Justice Rogers quickly set about to put in place her 
priorities and goals for the Judicial Branch, among them 
transparency, openness and accountability. They included:

Appointing a 42-member Public Service and Trust 
Commission. Chaired by Appellate Court Judge 
Alexandra D. DiPentima, the commission was 
charged by the Chief  Justice with developing the 
first-ever strategic plan for the Judicial Branch.

Announcing the review of  family and civil cases 
that were sealed prior to July 1, 2003, the effective 
date of  the rule changes regarding the sealing of  
a file. Judicial Branch personnel completed the 
review in 2008.

Building upon a mentoring program for new judges 
and extending it from six months to two years.

Creating the Committee on Judicial Ethics and appoint-
ing the Honorable Barry R. Schaller as chairman.

istrative judge of  juvenile matters, and the Honor-
able Lynda B. Munro as chief  administrative judge 
of  family matters.

The Public Service and Trust Commission Gets Under Way

… if we don’t have your input, we can’t succeed. If we don’t have the 
input of our diverse legal and public community at large, we fall short 
of our goals.  As I have said many times before, if we’re doing something 
right, tell us. If something can be done better, please feel free to give us 
some ideas. And if we’re failing somewhere, we need to know. 

The Honorable Chase T. Rogers, Chief Justice, Connecticut Supreme Court

The Public Service and Trust Commission met for the 
first  time  in  September  2007.  At  that  time,  Chief   Jus-
tice Rogers charged it with developing a plan to enhance 
the public’s trust and confidence in the Judicial Branch 
by  improving  the  services  offered  to  the  thousands  of  
people who interact with the Branch every day.

Commission  members  obtained  input  from  those  who  
interact  with  the  Branch  and  from  Branch  members 
through more than 90 focus groups, two public hearings 
and two surveys. The information obtained consisted of  
the trends that will affect the Branch over the next three 
to  five  years,  the  impacts  those  trends  will  have  on  the 
Branch and possible strategies to address those impacts. 
The  commission  then  analyzed  all  of   the  information 
and grouped it into five major areas: access to the courts, 
changing demographics, delivery of  Branch services, col-
laboration of  the Branch with those who interact with it or 
have an interest in its activities, and accountability on the 
part of  the Branch to the people it serves. Commission 
members were then assigned to one of  five committees 
tasked  with  developing  goals  and  strategies  for  each  of  
these areas based upon the trends, impact and strategies 
that were identified.

The  commission  and  its  committees  met  separately 
and together 50 times to develop a strategic plan that  
addresses  all  five  areas  and  provides  a  framework  to 
guide  the  Branch  over  the  next  three  to  five  years.  In 
June of  2008, the plan was submitted to the Chief  Justice, 
who adopted the commission’s recommendations and

directed  Chief   Court  Administrator  Barbara  Quinn  to 
develop an implementation plan.

The  plan  is  being  implemented  in  phases,  with  initia-
tives  prioritized  based  on  a  number  of   factors,  includ-
ing the recurring themes mentioned in focus groups and  
surveys, the breadth and impact of  an initiative, and the  
allocation of  finite Branch resources. As a result of  the  
prioritization,  the  first  phase  of   the  implementation  
process includes initiatives that led to the creation of  the 
following committees: Alternatives to Court Appearances; 
Court  Security;  Expectations  of   the  Public;  External  
Affairs Advisory Board; Judicial Performance Evaluation 
Program; Jury; Self-represented Parties; and Uniformity 
of   Court  Procedures.  Also  in  this  first  phase,  existing 
committees, commissions and  programs  are  addressing 
issues in many different areas.

Essential to the success of  the plan is the involvement of  
the judges: at last count, about 80 of  them were involved 
in implementing the strategic plan, many of  them serv-
ing as co-chairs of  committees or subcommittees.

The adoption of  this road map by the Chief  Justice was 
just  the  beginning  of   the  strategic  planning  process. 
Its  implementation  will  require  the  sustained  commit-
ment  of   the  Judicial  Branch  and  involvement  from  all 
stakeholders in our state court system. As it must be, this  
implementation plan is a living document, so that it achieves 
the ambitious goals adopted in the strategic plan.

In addition, and in conjunction with the strategic plan, 
these other developments have occurred:













The doors of  all Superior Court courthouses now 
open at 8:30 a.m., although business begins at 9 a.m., 
resulting in shorter lines at the metal detector.

Camera cell phones are now allowed into the court-
houses, which also contributes greatly to shorter 
lines at the metal detector because judicial marshals 
no longer have to “bag and tag” these items.

The Judicial Performance Committee has met and 
is re-examining the way that judges are presently 
evaluated. The committee will explore evaluation 
beyond the existing program, including the pos-
sibility of  posting information on the website and 
establishing an advisory board.

The Complex Litigation Committee has completed 
its work and has made numerous recommendations 
to improve the functioning of  this docket. The 
Judicial Branch is in the process of  implementing 
these recommendations.

The Alternatives to Court Appearances Commit-
tee is exploring the expansion of  use of  video and 
teleconferencing to areas such as arraignments, 
child protection, status and settlement conferences, 
and interpreters.

The Jury Committee is examining every aspect of  
juror service including juror orientation, the voir 
dire process, revising the juror video and providing 
Internet access for jurors.

During the biennium, the Supreme and Appellate Courts 
continued  their  “On  Circuit”  visits.  At  these  events, 
the  justices  and  judges  hear  actual  arguments  in  cases  
before audiences of  either high school or college students. 
The goal is to educate our young people about the role and 
responsibilities  of   the  courts.  The  Chief   Justice,  mean-
while,  continues  to  encourage  the  many  Superior  Court 
judges who address community groups and civic organi-
zations to continue this very important outreach.

Another form of  outreach has been the increased pres-
ence  of   cameras  in  Connecticut’s  state  courtrooms.  In 
2007, the state’s Superior Court judges voted to expand 
the rules regarding cameras in the courts, starting Janu-
ary  1,  2008.  Throughout  2008,  the  judges  granted  236 
requests for cameras, the bulk of  which involved arraign-
ments of  defendants in criminal court. Included in the 
granted requests were two criminal trials—one for insur-
ance fraud and the other for murder. 

he Judicial Branch also has greatly expanded the infor-
mation available to the public on its website, and has an 
extensive section devoted to agendas and minutes of  the 
many committees and subcommittees that meet in public 
regarding court business and issues.

Award competition.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE  
BIENNIUM INCLUDE:


In 2007, CSSD, the Department of  Correction and 
the Board of  Pardons and Paroles began collaborating 
to  improve  their  exchange  of   information.  As  a 
result,  CSSD  in  February  2008  made  available  a 
computer application, the Judicial Electronic Bridge 
(JEB), to provide access to adult/youthful offender 
probation and juvenile information to pardons and 
parole  and  the  DOC.  The  application  promotes 
public safety and welfare by providing immediate 
access to selected offender information, including 
pre-sentence investigations.



Also  in  2008,  CSSD  automated  all  violation  of  
probation  warrants  into  the  Paperless  Re-arrest 
Warrant  Network  (PRAWN).  Law  enforcement 
personnel  statewide now  have  electronic  access 
and  the  ability  to  service  electronically  any 
violation  of   probation  warrant.  In  addition, 
information regarding outstanding arrest warrants 
for violation of  probation is now posted on the 
Judicial  Branch’s  Internet  website,  pursuant  to 
Section  21  of   Public  Act  08-01  of   the  January 
Special Session.  (Continued on page 22)

In 2008, CSSD created a computer application 
to  provide  law  enforcement  personnel  with 
access  to  adult  probation  information.  The 
purpose  of   Municipal  Access  to  the  Judicial 
Electronic  Bridge  (MA  JEB)  is  to  promote 
public  safety  and  welfare  by  providing  access 
to  offender  information  including  addresses, 
photos, charges, conditions of  probation, and 
DNA information.

CSSD  in  2008  completed  a  three-year  formal 
evaluation of  the Family Civil Intake Screen in 
conjunction with the Association of  Family and 
Conciliation Courts. The research demonstrated 
that  there  has  been  a  significant  increase 
in  agreement  rates  for  the  Family  Services 
interventions. In addition, the Family Civil Intake 
Screen  was  selected  as  a  “Top  50”  program  in 
the 2008 Innovations in American Government 
Award  competition  sponsored  by  the  Kennedy 
School of  Government at Harvard University. 

Also  in  2008,  CSSD  completed  an  18-month 
recidivism  study  regarding  the  family  violence 
risk  assessment.  This  research  established 
the  continuum  of   risk  scores  for  the  State  of  
Connecticut  and  revealed  that  the  higher  the 
risk score, the greater the probability of  family 
violence  recidivism  and  non-compliance  with 
court  orders.  A  significant  finding  was  that  73 
percent of  cases referred to Family Services for 
pre-trial supervision were compliant with court 
orders. Of  those compliant, 82 percent were not 
re-arrested for family violence 18 months after the 
administration of  the risk assessment.

During 2006/2007, Juvenile Detention Services 
acquired national accreditations/standards for its 
three state juvenile detention facilities. In 2006, 
all  of   the  detention  centers  were  reaccredited 
through the American Correctional Association. 
In  2007,  all  of   the  detention  centers  were 
reaccredited through the National Commission 
on Correctional Health Care.

CSSD  in  2008  entered  into  a  Memorandum  of  
Agreement with the Department of  Children and 
Families and the Department of  Social Services to 
gain statewide access to Intensive In-home Child and 
Adolescent Psychiatric Services for court-involved 
children  and  youth  with  significant  psychiatric 
disabilities.  This  community-based  service  model 
has proved successful in treating children and youth 
at-risk  for  institutionalization  or  to  support  their 
return to the community post discharge.

CSSD in 2007 expanded the Technical Violation 
Units  and  the  Probation  Transition  Program 
to each office in the state. Both programs have 
reduced technical violations of  probation, resulting 
in fewer probationers being re-incarcerated. The 
same  year,  CSSD  placed  Mental  Health  Units 
in five Adult Supervision offices. The program 
allows  specially  trained  probation  officers  to 
supervise a reduced caseload of  sentenced clients 
with mental health disorders.

In  2007,  CSSD  implemented  the  Women’s 
Offender Case Management Model pilot program. 
CSSD  has  dedicated  eight  probation  officers 
over  four  sites,  (New  Britain,  Hartford,  New 
Haven and Bridgeport), who supervise a reduced 
caseload of  women only. The officers have been 
trained in a gender responsive supervision model 
that uses evidence-based best practice techniques 
to more effectively supervise high-risk women.

In  2008,  CSSD  successfully  piloted  Intensive 
Pre-Trial Supervision services in five locations, 
for  defendants  who  are  detained  pre-trial  and 
awaiting  placement  in  a  residential  treatment 
facility.  This  program  provides  judges  with  an 
option of  probation supervision in conjunction 
with  intensive  outpatient  treatment  in  lieu  of  
pre-trial incarceration.

Executive  Branches,  the  public,  community 
organizations and the news media. The division 
also operates the volunteer and intern, and job 
shadowing programs.

The American Bar  
Association honored the 
Branch for having one 
of  the best Law Day 
programs in the nation.

External  Affairs  played  a  significant  role  in  the 
Law Day Award the Judicial Branch received in 
2008  from  the  American  Bar  Association.  The 
award honored the Branch as having one of  the 
best  Law  Day  programs  in  the  nation.  Among 
the  Branch’s  activities:  Chief   Justice  Chase  
Rogers  sent  the  State’s  high  school  and  middle 
school  social  studies  chairs  resources  to  teach 
students  about  the  rule  of   law;  public  service  
announcements about the Branch were produced 
and aired; and 25 justices and judges spoke to stu-
dents about the importance of  the rule of  law.

egislators and legislative staff  attended a series 
of  programs as part of  the division’s “Opening 
Our  Doors”  initiative.  Subjects  included  fam-
ily court, technological developments within the 
Branch, criminal court, and adult probation.

The  Volunteer  Program  administered  by  External 
Affairs has maintained 38 volunteers placed in vari-
ous offices throughout the Branch. 

A Job Shadow Program offered high school students 
the  opportunity  to  “shadow”  work  place  hosts  in 
court or at a Judicial Branch facility, as they go through 
their normal work day. Several area high schools and 
approximately 80 students participated in the program 
during 2007 and 2008.

The Court Aide Program administered by External 
Affairs  is  designed  for  college-bound  high  school 
seniors who must complete community service hours 
as part of  their graduation requirements or who will 
major  in  the  legal/criminal  justice  field  in  college. 
Qualified students are placed in offices to assist staff  
with the day-to-day operations while observing and 
learning  court  processes.  Since  2006,  15  students 
have participated in the program and in June 2008, it 
became a permanent educational component of  the 
Branch’s Volunteer/Intern Program.

Utilizing our publication process since 2005, External 
Affairs  approves,  develops,  designs,  facilitates  print-
ing, maintains print history of  Judicial Branch publi-
cations, and posts and maintains publications on the 
Judicial Branch’s publication web page. Some of  the 
major  publications  developed  and  produced  include 
the Biennial Report and the Branch Directory.

Throughout  the  biennium,  External  Affairs 
coordinated programs designed to educate the 
public about our state courts. These programs 
include the Supreme Court Tour program, the 
Speakers  Bureau,  and  Seniors  and  The  Law. 
In 2008, External Affairs staff  began working 
with judges on the External  Affairs Advisory 
Board to enhance public education about the 
court  for  all  of   Connecticut’s  residents.  The 
advisory board is an outgrowth of  the Public 
Service  and  Trust  Commission  appointed  by 
Chief  Justice Rogers.

Over the past two years, External Affairs handled 
well over 2,000 inquiries from the news media, 
a number that expanded after judges changed 
the  Practice  Book  rules  regarding  cameras  in 
courts.    The  division  also  served  as  staff  
liaison to the Judicial-Media Committee, helped 
compile a survey of  judges and journalists and 
assisted with the Branch’s first Law School for 
Journalists.

The Intern Program administered by External 
Affairs  continues  to  thrive.  The  program 
provides thousands of  hours worth of  valuable 
services  to  Judicial  Branch  employees,  who 
gain  the  opportunity  to  act  as  mentors  to  
college  students,  while  also  benefiting  from 
the  contributions  that  can  be  made  by  these 
individuals. In 2007, 460 interns were placed in 
various offices throughout the Branch; in 2008, 
491  interns  were  placed.  Interns  during  both 
years contributed more than 60,000 hours.

The  division  assisted  in  coordinating  several 
events,  including  the  twice-yearly  swearing  in 
of new lawyers before the Supreme Court, the 
final  round  of  the  High  School  Mock  Trial 
Competition,  and  visits  by  dignitaries  from 
around the world.

T

he  Information  Technology  Division  (ITD) 
consists of Judicial Information Systems (JIS) and 
the Commission on Official Legal Publications. 
The division designs, develops, implements and 
maintains the Judicial Branch’s complex network 
of  data  and  information  processing,  storage, 
retrieval, dissemination and printing systems for 
the Branch, the legal community and the public. 
ITD also manages the HelpDesk, which provides 
assistance to thousands of users. In addition, the 
division performs a crucial role in the development 
and maintenance of the Branch’s website.

Since 2001, the 
number of  visitors to 
the Judicial Branch 
website has grown by 
50 percent annually.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PAST 
TWO YEARS INCLUDE:


Since 2001, the number of  visitors to the Judicial 
Branch website has grown by 50 percent per year. 
The number of  pages viewed per month is another 
key indicator demonstrating increased use of  the 
Branch’s  website.  As  of   December  2008  there 
were 6,315,619 pages viewed for the month on 
the  interactive  website—a  100  percent  increase 
from the year previous.





The online criminal dockets also showed a marked 
increase of  page views with 1,603,371 at the end 
of  2008, which accounted for a 50 percent  
increase since March 2008.

The division helped develop and implement many 
enhancements to the Branch website that greatly 
expanded public access. They include: a pending 
criminal case inquiry capability; a criminal daily



docket inquiry capability; a conviction and bond 
forfeiture disposition inquiry capability; a Judicial 
committee section to post minutes, agendas and 
notices; a new section on the website with fillable 
PDF  court  forms;  and  a  section  that  includes 
various publications in Spanish.

The Court Support Services Division’s (CSSD) 
active Violation of  Probation Warrants (VOPs) 
were  added  to  PRAWN  (Paperless  Rearrest  
Warrant Network) along with the added PRAWN 
functionality  to  give  local  and  state  police  the 
ability to view and serve these warrants. These 
enhancements include an electronic connection 
between PRAWN and other Judicial case man-
agement  systems  to  keep  the  VOP  data  up  to 
date.  Additionally,  the  Criminal  Motor  Vehicle 
System (CRMVS) was (Continued on page 26 )

modified to automate a formerly manual process, 
allowing failures to appear and violations of  pro-
bation to be smoothly docketed and presented in 
any court in the state rather than just in the court 
associated with the arresting agency.

The  Information  Technology  Division  con-
tinues  to  work  as  an  indispensable  partner  in 
the development of  the Judicial Branch’s elec-
tronic  filing  program,  which  allows  attorneys 
to file certain civil cases via the Internet. As of   
December 2008, 35,315 lawyers and firms had 
enrolled  in  E-services.  Also  as  of   December 
2008, 17,459 cases and 323,293 documents had 
been  electronically  filed.  The  Judicial  Branch 
first introduced electronic filing in May 2004.

This  division  also  implemented  essential 
infrastructure  and  support  improvements 
that  make  Connecticut’s  courtrooms  more 
electronically  savvy  and  accessible.  These 
improvements  included  significant  wide-area 
network upgrades to fiber optic technology at four 
sites and the addition of  a full-time technician to 
work on “For the Record,” the Branch’s digital 
audio courtroom recording software.

A  laptop  encryption  project  was  initiated  and 
completed over the past two years. The project, 
which was completed in June 2008, involved the 
encryption of  1,100 Judicial laptop computers. 
This process secures laptop data by converting 
plain text into a difficult-to-interpret form and 
allows only authorized individuals to access it.

Building  upon  a  successful  pilot  program  in 
Bridgeport,  video  conferencing  capabilities  for 
hearing  habeas  and  family  support  matters  have 
been  expanded  to  courtrooms  in  Hartford, 
New  Haven,  Stamford  and  Waterbury.  The  
cases  involve  motions  for  modification  of   child 
support filed by inmates from various correctional 
facilities  across  the  state.  Family  magistrates  can 
now hear these cases by connecting directly through 
Judicial  Branch  IP  networks  to  Department  of  
Correction locations. This new initiative provides





significant savings by eliminating transportation 
costs,  reducing  the  strain  on  existing  resources 
and decreasing the amount of  overtime pay re-
quired.  An  additional  benefit  is  minimizing  the 
risk  to  public  safety  by  keeping  inmates  within 
DOC control at DOC facilities. 

Wireless  LAN  access  in  courthouse  lockup  
areas—a  Court  Support  Services  Division 
(CSSD) pilot program—has been implemented 
in  the  lockup  and  bail  areas  of   the  New  Brit-
ain and Waterbury courthouses. This allows bail 
and probation personnel conducting interviews 
and entering data on tablet computers to walk 
within  and  between  cells  while  continuing  to 
maintain a connection to their centralized Case 
Management  System.  A  third  site,  Hartford’s 
GA 14, is currently in the process of  being out-
fitted  with  wireless  capability  and  will  be  the  
final pilot site.

ITD’s Network and Security Services unit rolled 
out a new Virtual Private network (VPN) 
solution. This solution provides Judicial Branch 
employees with secure remote access to applica-
tions and systems on the Judicial network when 
away  from  the  office.  The  VPN  uses  a  token 
that hangs on a keychain and displays a number 
that changes every 60 seconds. The VPN user 
simply inputs his/her username and PIN along 
with  the  token  code  to  get  connected.  A  user 
with a laptop or desktop PC can use the VPN 
anywhere  an  Internet  connection  is  available 
such as at home, conference centers or wireless 
“hot spots” available  in  many hospitality busi-
ness establishments. Access to applications such 
as  the  Protective  Order  Registry,  the  Criminal 
Motor  Vehicle  System  and  Judicial  e-mail  are 
available through VPN and the Internet. VPN 
is very useful to judges and employees, allowing 
them to view and control their office PCs and 
giving them remote access to data and applica-
tions as if  they were sitting at their desk.

providing quality services and information to the 
court, its users and the community in an effective, 
professional and courteous manner. Overall, the 
division provides judges and support staff with 
resources needed to process cases for trial, and 
to process cases and matters that may be resolved 
without a trial. The division, the Branch’s largest, 
is  composed  of:  Judge  Support  Services,  the 
Court Operations Unit, the Legal Services Unit, 
the  Administration  Unit,  the  Office  of  Victim 
Services,  Judicial  Marshal  Services  and  Support 
Enforcement Administration. 

HIGHLIGHTS OVER THE PAST 
TWO YEARS INCLUDE:


In  accordance  with  its  five-year  improvement 
action  plan,  interpreter  and  translator  services 
established  a  more  comprehensive  training 
program  that  includes  proficiency  testing  that 
leads to certification in Spanish, Russian, Polish 
and Portuguese.

Transcript  services  put  into  production  the 
Sentencing  Hearing  Transcripts  application, 
which provides state officials with ready transcript 
information on parole applicants. There are some 
10,000 transcripts currently in the database.

Legal  Services  began  integrating  plain  language 
into official Judicial Branch forms and publications 
that are used by the public. This initiative will make 
the court system more accessible to the public by 
making the forms more understandable and easier 
to complete.

Legal Services also implemented the Practice 
Book rule providing for the random inspections 
and audits of  attorney trust fund accounts.

With the assistance of  Judge Support Services, both 
collections of  the civil and criminal jury instructions 
were  expanded,  revised  and  updated  under  the 
leadership of  Judge Edward Mullarkey, Jr. (criminal) 
and Judge Jane Scholl (civil). Posted on the Branch’s 
website, the two collections are intended as a guide 
for judges and attorneys in constructing charges 
and requests to charge.  (Continued on page 28)

As  a  result  of   legislation  in  2008,  the  Court 
Operations  Unit  established  a  Foreclosure 
Mediation  Program  in  actions  to  foreclosure 
mortgages on residential real property. Foreclosure 
units are in 14 of  the 15 Judicial District courthouses 
and  include  office  clerks,  caseflow  coordinators 
and mediation specialists. The program has proven 
a  great  help  in  easing  the  foreclosure  crisis  that 
homeowners, as well as lenders, are facing in these 
difficult economic times.

Support  Enforcement  Administration  worked 
with  representatives  from  the  Department 
of   Correction  and  the  Branch’s  Information 
Technology  Division  to  expand  the  number 
of   Judicial  District  locations  offering  video 
conference  hearings  for  incarcerated  parents 
filing  motions  for  modification  of   their  child 
support orders. This effort has improved access 
to  the  courts  and  saved  both  the  Branch  and 
Correction Department the costs associated with 
processing and transporting inmates to court.

Support  Enforcement  also  launched  a 
community  outreach  program,  with  trained 
staff  members who make presentations on child 
support services.

The Judicial Marshal Academy was reaccredited 
in 2008 by the Commission on Accreditation for 
Law Enforcement Agencies. The Academy met 
182 professional standards and throughout all 
aspects of  the audit, commission representatives 
acknowledged  the  Academy’s  high  level  of  
commitment to training.

In  2008,  the  Connecticut  Credit  Assessment 
Program  audit  team  awarded  nine  academic 
credits,  through  Charter  Oak  State  College, 
based on successful completion of  the Judicial 
Marshal Pre-Service Academy.

The  centralized  transportation  unit  within 
Judicial Marshal Services enables effective and 
efficient  transportation  of   prisoners  to  and 
from courthouses.

By  December  2008,  digital  audio  recording 
systems supplied by For The Record were in use 
in 110 courtrooms in 30 courthouses in all Judicial 
Districts. All Juvenile Matters courtrooms employ 
this technology.

The division worked closely with the Information 
Technolog y  Division  to  post  conviction 
information,  daily  docket  information,  and 
pending case information on the Judicial Branch 
website. The two divisions also have collaborated 
closely on e-filing.

Jury  Administration,  in  collaboration  with  the 
Department of  Labor, produced an informational 
brochure  about  employee/employer  issues, 
which is mailed with the jury summons. The jury 
information page of  the Branch’s website also was 
redesigned in early 2008 to allow jurors to respond 
to their summonses via e-mail.

An  education  program  for  new  and  experienced 
attorneys  on  “Connecticut  Legal  Research  and 
Courthouse Resources” was offered in several Judicial 
Districts during both years of  the biennium.

The Office of  Victim Services hosted the National 
Association  of   Crime  Victim  Compensation 
Boards’ Eastern Regional Conference.

In  compliance  with  Public  Act  07-04,  an  Act 
Implementing  the  Provisions  of   the  Budget 
Concerning General Government, OVS contracted 
with  organizations  to  develop  a  coordinated 
response system to assist trafficking victims. OVS 
also is overseeing the development of  a brochure 
on the topic in seven languages.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
