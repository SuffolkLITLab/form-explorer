Benefits to Surviving Families of Police 
Officers  
 
By: Rute Pinho, Chief Legislative Analyst 
March 2, 2023 | 2023-R-0081 

Summarize the benefits available to surviving families of police officers killed in the line of duty in 
Connecticut and other Northeast states. This report updates OLR Report 97-R-1244. 

In Connecticut, the surviving families of police officers killed in the line of duty may be eligible for a 
range of state and municipal benefits, including (1) weekly workers’ compensation death benefits, 
(2) a burial benefit through the workers’ compensation system, (3) a lump sum benefit through the 
Police Association of Connecticut, (4) tuition waivers by the state’s colleges and universities, (5) 
state health insurance benefits, and (6) a property tax abatement. This report encompasses only 
those state and municipal benefits that are established in state law. It does not include other 
benefits established in collective bargaining agreements and retirement plans. Several of the 
benefits described in this report are also available to the surviving families of firefighters and other 
emergency responders. 

he other Northeast states generally offer the same types of benefits. Concerns of Police Survivors, 
a nonprofit organization, compiles these benefits on its website. The state-by-state summaries 
briefly describe the state death, workers’ compensation, pension, education, funeral, and other 
miscellaneous benefits available in each state. Below, we briefly highlight the state death and 
workers’ compensation benefits in the Northeast states.

In addition to these state and local benefits, a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report 
describes two federal benefits programs for which police officers’ and other first responders’ 
surviving family members may be eligible. They include (1) cash benefits through the Public Safety 
Officers’ Benefits (PSOB) program and (2) higher education assistance through the Public Safety 
Officers’ Educational Assistance (PSOEA) program. 
  
Connecticut State Benefits  

Workers’ Compensation Benefits 

A surviving spouse or other eligible dependent of a police officer may receive a weekly workers’ 
compensation benefit. The benefit is up to 75% of the deceased officer’s average weekly take-
home pay for the 52 weeks preceding the injury, up to a statutory maximum. Benefits are subject to 
an annual cost-of-living adjustment. As of October 1, 2022, the maximum compensation rate is 
$1,509 (Workers’ Compensation Commission, Memorandum No. 2022-09). 

he surviving spouse receives benefits until death or remarriage, after which surviving dependent 
children generally receive the benefits until they turn age 18 or 22, depending on whether they 
attend school full-time. If a physical or mental condition prevents the dependent child from earning 
a living, he or she continues to receive the benefits while incapacitated (CGS §§ 31-275(19) & -
306(a)(2)). Some unions negotiate workers’ compensation benefits for paid public safety officers 
that are higher than those set by law. 

he workers’ compensation law also provides a $12,000 burial benefit (annually adjusted for 
inflation) for any individual who dies from a work-related injury. For 2023, the benefit amount is 
$13,454.70 (CGS § 31-306(a)(1)). 

urvivors’ Benefits for State Employees and State Police 

Death Benefits for State Employees. In addition to the workers’ compensation benefits 
described above, the spouse and dependent children under age 18 of a police officer who was a 
state employee and was injured in the scope of his or her employment (other than by his or her own 
wanton or willful act) and dies as a result, receive a death benefit totaling $100,000. It is payable in 
equal monthly installments over a period of at least 10 years. If the spouse dies or remarries within 
10 years, the monthly payments cease, except for a $50-per-month payment to each child until he 
or she reaches age 18. If the employee leaves a spouse but not children under 18, the benefit is 
$50,000 payable in the same manner. If the employee leaves no spouse or children under 18 but 
leaves a dependent parent or parents, the benefit is $50,000 payable to the parents in equal

monthly installments over a minimum of 10 years. If one parent dies, the other continues to receive 
the full monthly payment, but if both parents die within 10 years, payments cease (CGS § 5-144). 

y law, these benefits are paid upon the recommendation of the employee’s appointing authority and 
with the attorney general’s approval. The Connecticut Supreme Court has ruled that, to be eligible, a 
state employee’s death must occur while he is employed by the state and be in some way caused 
by his duties as a state employee (Phipps v. Niejadlik, 175 Conn. 424). 

tate Police Survivors’ Benefits. The surviving spouse and dependent unmarried children of 
eligible state police officers who die from any cause before retiring are eligible for certain benefits. 
The benefits, which are payable from the State Employees Retirement Fund, are specified in law, 
but must conform to the terms of the State Police bargaining agreement. The statutory benefits 
consist of a monthly allowance of (1) $550 for the spouse for his or her lifetime and (2) $250 for 
one child, $500 for two children, and $575 for three or more. When there is only one dependent 
child remaining, the benefit payable to the spouse or guardian for that child is $250. The benefits 
for dependent children cease when they reach age 18 or marry, whichever is earlier. The benefits 
are subject to an annual cost of living adjustment of up to 3% (CGS § 5-146).  

n general, dependents of current officers are eligible for benefits if the officer did not participate in 
Social Security (and whose dependents are therefore ineligible for Social Security survivors’ 
benefits). State law generally allows dependents to collect both state police survivors’ benefits and 
state employee survivor benefits, if they satisfy the applicable requirements of both (CGS § 5-149). 

olice Association of Connecticut Relief Payments 

By law, the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection (DESPP) commissioner must 
pay relief to the surviving spouse or child of a police officer who is killed in the line of duty and a 
member of the association (CGS § 3-122). To obtain the benefits, the association must submit 
adequate proof to the commissioner that the person is eligible. The benefits are specified by the 
association, under the provisions of its constitution and bylaws, but are statutorily limited to 
available appropriations. According to the association’s website, the line-of-duty death benefit is 
$20,000, plus $100 per week per child to the guardian of all dependent children from the date of 
death to that child’s 18th birthday. 

roup Hospitalization and Medical and Surgical Insurance Plan 

The comptroller, with the attorney general and insurance commissioner’s approval, must arrange 
and procure state health insurance, including group hospitalization, medical, and surgical plan 
coverage, for the surviving spouses and dependent children of police officers who die from injuries

received while on duty. A dependent child’s policy terminates when he or she receives coverage 
from an employer or turns 26, whichever happens first (CGS § 5-259(a)(6)). 

uition Waivers 

State law requires the community-technical colleges, the Connecticut State University system, and 
UConn to waive tuition for the dependent children of paid and volunteer police officers killed in the 
line of duty (CGS §§ 10a-77(d), 10a-99(d), & 10a-105(e)). 

onnecticut Municipal Benefits 

Survivor Pension Benefit 

State law permits the surviving spouse and dependents of a police officer who died in the line of 
duty to receive any survivor pension benefit offered under the employee’s municipal plan in 
addition to workers’ compensation (CGS § 7-433b(a)). But the law sets the limit for this combined 
benefit at no more than 100% of the weekly pay that employees in the same position as the 
deceased employee receive during the compensable period. The law also requires that the 
municipal survivor pension benefit continue to the surviving spouse after remarriage. (The workers’ 
compensation benefit ends at remarriage.) 

roperty Tax Abatement 

State law authorizes municipalities to establish a program, by ordinance, to abate all or part of the 
property tax on the principal residence owned by the surviving spouse of a police officer killed in the 
line of duty (CGS § 12-81x). 

olice & Firefighter Survivors’ Benefit Fund 

Some municipalities participate, by local ordinance, in the state-administered Policemen and 
Firemen Survivors’ Benefit Fund. Participating officers and firefighters contribute 1% of their pay to 
the fund. If a participant dies, a surviving spouse receives 30% of the deceased member’s monthly 
compensation. If the member had one dependent child, the benefit is increased by 15%; if he or 
she had two or more dependent children, it is increased by 30%. 

enefits equaling the deceased’s contributions without interest are payable to named beneficiaries 

if there are no surviving dependents. If there are no named beneficiaries, the money goes to the 
executor or estate administrator (CGS §§ 7-323c to 7-323e).

Police Reserve Fund 

In towns with a police reserve fund established pursuant to referendum, the board of police 
commissioners or police committee may approve up to $300 per year for up to 10 years from the 
fund for the surviving spouse or children of an officer killed in the line of duty. The benefit is 
payable to the children if the officer leaves no surviving spouse or the surviving spouse dies or 
remarries. It is payable to children until they reach age 18 and to surviving spouses until they die or 
remarry (CGS §§ 7-295 to 7-297). 

enefits in Other Northeast States 

Table 1 briefly describes some of the state death and workers’ compensation benefits highlighted 
in the Concerns of Police Survivors database for the other Northeast states, updated by OLR, and 
for each provides the relevant statutory citation. The table does not provide an exhaustive list of the 
benefits that may be available in these states. As the table shows, five of the eight states provide a 
death benefit to surviving families and all of the states offer workers’ compensation survivors’ 
benefits of varying amounts.
