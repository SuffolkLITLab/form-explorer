INTRODUCTION

This pamphlet is designed to inform you of the 
basic steps in an eviction action, which is also 
known as a summary process action. It is not 
intended as a substitute for the advice of an 
attorney. The Judicial Branch is not responsible 
for any errors or omissions in this pamphlet. 
If you feel you need more information or 
assistance, you should talk to an attorney 
or read the appropriate sections of the 
Connecticut General Statutes and Connecticut 
Practice Book.

APPEARANCE AND ANSWER

After you are served with an eviction summons  
and complaint, the first step in representing yourself 
is to file a form known as an Appearance (see  
form JD-CL-12 on page 10) no later than 2 days  
after the Return Date on your summons. The 
appearance form is available online at  
https://www.jud.ct.gov/webforms/forms/CL012.pdf, 
or at the clerk’s office. Your appearance lists your 
name, address, telephone number and signature. 
Your landlord is the Plaintiff, and you are the 
Defendant.

After completing your appearance form, you may 
file an Answer (see form JD-HM-5 on page 12) to the 
complaint. The answer form is available online at  
https://www.jud.ct.gov/webforms/forms/HM005.pdf, 
or at the clerk’s office. You must read each numbered 
paragraph of the complaint and select your response 
on the answer form. Responses include “Agree,” 
“Disagree,” or “Do Not Know”. There are also 
several special defenses listed on the answer form. 
You may check any that apply to you and fill in the 
blanks, as appropriate. Additional comments may  
be written at the bottom of the form. Be sure to sign 
the form.

In addition to filing the original appearance and 
answer, you must also immediately mail a copy of 
them to your landlord or your landlord’s attorney, 
if there is one; failure to do this may result in you 
losing the case. If you have selected any applicable 
special defenses, the landlord must file a reply to 
them before a mediation and trial is scheduled.

1

A mediation with a Housing Mediator and a trial 
before a judge will be scheduled in your case. These 
two events may be scheduled on the same day: if 
you and your landlord do not settle your case in 
mediation, you may proceed directly to a trial. The 
clerk’s office will notify you of the trial date by 
mailing you a Notice of Court Hearing.

TRIALS

Unless your trial will be held virtually, it is important 
that you come to court on the trial date listed on the 
Notice of Court Hearing, or you may lose your case. 
You must be at the court on time. You must  bring 
any witnesses, papers or receipts that you may have; 
without these things you may lose your case. If a 
witness will not come to court voluntarily, you may 
apply for a subpoena at the clerk’s office at least 2 
days before the scheduled trial date. If a judge grants 
the application, a subpoena will issue. The subpoena 
must be served on your witness at least 18 hours 
before your trial date and time. The state marshal will 
charge you a fee to serve the subpoena.

Unless your trial will be held virtually, on the day 
of your mediation and trial, your case will be called 
by the courtroom clerk. When this happens, you 
must tell the clerk you are present. After your case is 
called, you and your landlord or landlord’s attorney 
will meet with a Housing Mediator. The Housing 
Mediator will help you and your landlord come to a 
written agreement. The agreement will be reviewed 
by the judge. If the judge approves of the agreement, 
then a copy of the agreement will be given to you.

2

You are not required to reach an agreement with your 
landlord during mediation. If you do not reach an 
agreement, there will be a trial. The judge will hear 
the case and make a decision based on the evidence. 
The judge will either announce the decision in court 
or notify you by mail.

If you need an interpreter, you must contact the 
clerk’s office at least 2 days before any hearing date.

JUDGMENTS

After trial, if the judge rules in your favor, you may 
stay in the premises. If you lose the case, you will 
have 5 days to leave the premises, not including the 
date of judgment, Sundays and legal holidays.

If the judgment against you is based on nonpayment 
of rent, you may apply for a stay of execution for up 
to 3 months. The execution is used to remove you 
from the premises. In order to receive a stay, you 
must do both of the following things within 5 days 
from the date of judgment, not including the date of 
judgment, Sundays and legal holidays.

A.  Deposit with the court, in person, the full amount 

of the arrearage (back rent and/or use and 
occupancy) owed to your landlord. This can 
be paid only by certified check or money order 
payable to Clerk of the Superior Court, or by cash, 
and

B.  When making this deposit, file a completed  

Stay of Execution Application (form JD-HM-21), 
available online at  
https://www.jud.ct.gov/webforms/forms/HM021.pdf, 
or at the clerk’s office.

3

A court hearing may then be scheduled on the Stay 
of Execution Application. If so, you will be notified 
of the date and time of hearing either immediately 
in person by the clerk, or by mail. At the hearing, the 
amount of time you may stay in the premises may be 
decided by the judge.

If the judgment against you is based on lapse of time, 
or that a previous right or privilege to occupy the 
premises has terminated, you also have the right to 
apply for a stay. You may file a Stay of Execution  
Application. A court hearing may then be scheduled. 
If so, you will be notified of the date and time of 
hearing either immediately in person, or by mail.
At the hearing, the length of your stay of execution, 
up to a maximum of 6 months, may be decided by 
the judge. 

If you do not move voluntarily when your stay of 
execution period ends, or if you have violated any 
conditions, the court may issue an execution.

If you do not make a payment that was agreed to 
or ordered by the court, the landlord must file an 
affidavit, and send a copy to you, before an execution 
may issue.

4

If you disagree with the landlord’s affidavit, you  
may promptly file an Objection (form JD-HM-26).  
The objection form is available online at  
https://www.jud.ct.gov/webforms/forms/HM026.pdf, 
or at the clerk’s office. If you do nothing, an execution 
may issue as early as the 3rd business day after 
the affidavit is filed. Your belongings may then be 
physically removed by the state marshal and delivered 
to a designated place of storage. If your belongings 
are removed and stored, and within 15 days you do 
not claim them and pay the storage expenses, those 
belongings may be sold by the town.

LEGAL AID AND  
LAWYER REFERRAL

If you need additional assistance, legal advice or 
representation, you should contact an attorney. You 
may get an attorney by contacting a Lawyer Referral 
Service office, or, if you qualify, a Legal Aid Office. 
(See page 7 for a listing of these services.)

Note: Only the clerk’s offices of the Housing Sessions 
may provide procedural assistance to self-represented 
parties.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
