INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHILD SUPPORT AGENCY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION FORM 

 

 

 

  
PURPOSE OF THE FORM: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

This form is for Child Support (IV-D) Agency use only and is not to be filed with a tribunal or provided to the other 
 
party.  The Child Support Agency Confidential Information Form is intended to safeguard the privacy of individuals by 
 
providing a means to record their personally identifiable information on a separate document that is not served on the 
parties or filed with a tribunal.  The information contained in the form is governed by federal and state safeguarding 
and privacy requirements.  This form must always be included with a Child Support Enforcement Transmittal #1 
request to open a IV-D intergovernmental case and a Child Support Agency Request for Change of Support Payment 
 
Location Pursuant to UIFSA § 319.  The Child Support Agency Confidential Information Form is needed for most 
 
actions being requested on the Child Support Enforcement Transmittal #2 and the Child Support Enforcement 
 
Transmittal #3, since most of the identifying information has been removed from those forms.  It should be included 
 
with the Child Support Enforcement Transmittal #3 if the IV-D case identifier or tribunal number in the assisting state 
is unknown. 
 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The information on this form may be disclosed only as authorized by law. 
 

 

 

If you are not the intended recipient, you are hereby notified that any use, disclosure, distribution, or copying of this 
 
form or its contents is strictly prohibited. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 
Italicized text that appears within a “box” refers to policy or provides additional information. 

 

 

 

 
For an address outside the United States, be sure to include the foreign country and postal code. 

 

Tribal IV-D programs may choose to use the federal Intergovernmental forms.  However, they are not required to 
 
use or accept such forms.  If you have any questions, contact the tribal IV-D agency directly using the contact 
 
information on the OCSE website. 
 

  

 

 

 

 
Where forms request a locator code, note that tribal locator codes uniquely identify tribal cases with “9” in the first 
 
position, 0 (zero) in the second position, and then a 3-character tribal code defined by the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
(BIA). 
 

 

 

 

 

 

In the “NOTE:” section, check any of the following that apply: 
 
 
• 
 

This form sent through EDE – Check if this form was sent through the Electronic Document Exchange 
(EDE). 
  

   

 

 

 

 

CSENet and EDE transactions are the recommended methods for making requests or sending information to 
another state.  If CSENet is not listed as an option on the form, then it cannot be used to convey any of the requests 
 
or information provided on the form.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Supporting documentation should be sent through EDE, whenever possible.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
