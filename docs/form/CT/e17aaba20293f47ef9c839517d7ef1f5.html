Introduction

When  the  structure  of  a  family  changes,  the 
people  involved  may  experience  a  period  of 
uncertainty.  Changes often cause differences of 
opinion about the sharing of parenting time and 
responsibilities.    During  these  times,  families 
can often benefit from the help of professionals 
in setting up a parenting plan that would be in 
the children’s best interests. 

is 
The  Comprehensive  Evaluation  process 
designed to provide that help.  For many parents, 
the  process  becomes  a  learning  experience.  
Parents discover more about the needs of their 
children  and  their  own  reactions  to  the  family 
situation.  

the 

that 

is  hoped 

information  and 
It 
recommendations  that  are  shared  during  this 
process  will  help  parents  resolve  the  issues 
and  move  forward  with  a  healthy  parenting 
arrangement  for  their  children.    Resolving  the 
conflict  will  also  allow  the  children  to  make  a 
successful  adjustment  to  the  changes  in  their 
lives.

What to Expect

A Comprehensive Evaluation is only conducted 
after  it  is  ordered  by  the  Court.    A  Family 
Relations  Counselor  (FRC)  is  then  assigned 
to  the  case.    During  the  process,  information 
is  collected  from  the  parents  and  various 
professionals in order to better understand what 
might help the family and the children.  

The comprehensive evaluation is not a confidential 
process. This means the information gathered by 
the FRC is shared with the parents, the attorneys, 
and  Guardians  Ad  Litem  (GAL)  in  the  case, 
and  possibly  the  Court  at  the  conclusion  of  the 
evaluation.  

In  addition  to  providing  the  parties  with  an 
assessment of the family, the FRC will also make 
recommendations about a parenting plan that best 
meets the needs of the children.    Often, parents 
may  come  to  an  agreement  on  the  issues  during 
the  evaluation  process  or  at  its  end.    When  this 
happens, there is no need for a trial.  

The Process

the  Comprehensive  Evaluation 
All  parts  of 
are  important  and  help  the  FRC  in  making 
recommendations  about 
the  best  possible 
parenting  arrangement  for  the  children.    The 
process includes the following:

•	 The  Comprehensive  Evaluation  usually 
begins  with  both  parents  meeting 
together with the FRC who will conduct 
the  evaluation.    This  gives  both  parents 
a  chance  to  share  their  concerns  and 
proposals  to  the  FRC  and  each  other.  
NOTE:  If you have safety concerns about 
meeting  with  your  child’s  other  parent, 
you  should  contact  your  FRC  when  you 
get  the  appointment  letter  to  talk  about 
those concerns.

•	 The  evaluation  process  will  also  include 
individual appointments, home visits, and 
meetings with the children.  

•	

•	

from 
Information  will  be  collected 
professionals (schools, doctors, therapists, 
and others) who have been involved with 
the family.  Parents will be asked to sign 
Authorization for Release of Information 
forms  for  each  professional  source  that 
will be contacted to allow an exchange of 
information. 
 Parents will be required to give 3 personal 
references  from  people  who  know  them 
as parents.

•	 The  Comprehensive  Evaluation  will 
end  with  a  final  conference.    Whenever 
possible,  the  meeting  will  be  scheduled 
for the parents and the attorneys together.  
In this meeting, the FRC will share their 
assessment  of  the  information  gathered 
during the process, their conclusions, and 
their recommendations.  

The information shared at the end of the 
Comprehensive Evaluation may help the parents 
in resolving the issues.  If there is an agreement, 
the Court is then notified of that by Family 
Services.  If an agreement is not reached, the 
FRC will send a written evaluation to the Court.  
The written report includes a summary of the 
facts, the counselor’s assessment of the family 
and recommendations.  This report may be used 
as evidence at a trial and the counselor may 
testify.
