FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Q. I need a lawyer. Where can I get one?
A. If  you were arrested and cannot afford an attorney, you may
apply for a public defender in Room 204. If  you do not qualify,
call the Lawyer Referral Service of the Hartford County Bar
Association at 860-525-6052, or check the Yellow Pages. If  you
have low income and have a family or housing legal problem,
you may qualify for help from Statewide Legal Services. Call
860-344-0380  (English  and  Spanish),  Monday-Wednesday,  9
a.m.-3 p.m.; Tuesday, Thursday, Friday 9 a.m.-4 p.m.

If you have been arrested, and on your court date you do not
have an attorney, AND the public defender has not been
appointed to represent you, please speak to the State’s Attorney,
in Room 114.

Q. I want to start a lawsuit. Where do I go?
A. The Civil Clerk’s Office, Room 200, on the second floor can
provide you with any available court forms and information
about the fees to file lawsuits in this court. The staff cannot
help you write your lawsuit. The Law Library, Room 208, has
form books and copies of the court rules. In addition, the
Court Service Center located in the lobby can assist you with
completing forms for temporary restraining orders, financial
affidavits, pro se divorces, custody and support modifications,
and summary process/eviction actions and can provide notary
services and court calendar and docket information.

Q. How do I reopen an old traffic ticket?
A. You must pay a $60 fee to reopen a closed court case at the
Criminal Clerk’s Office, Room 100. The clerk will give you a
court date and instructions on how to get your driver’s license
restored. If  your driver’s license was suspended by the Depart-
ment of  Motor Vehicles, you also may have to pay $125 to
DMV to restore your license.

Q. How may I pay fines and fees?
A. Pay fines and fees at the Clerk’s Office on or before the due
date by cash, money order or personal check, payable to “Clerk,
Superior Court” or by MasterCard or Visa. Personal checks
must be pre-printed with your current name and address. Valid
picture ID is required. Checks cannot exceed $800.

Q. How can I get child support?
A. The state can help you get a child support order or enforce an
existing order. Contact the Department of Social Services closest
to where you live. The Middletown DSS office may be reached at
704-3100. You may also consult an attorney or pursue child
support on your own. The Law Library, Room 208, has informa-
tion and court forms that may help you in some situations.

Q.  Where  is  the  public  copier?
A. Photocopies can be made for $0.10 in the Law Library, Room 208.

Q. I want to bail someone out of  jail. What do I do?
A. After the court sets the amount of the bond, you have
these options:
(cid:132) You may post a cash bond; which means you must pay the
exact amount of  the bond in cash to the Criminal Clerk’s
Office  (Room  100).

(cid:132) You may hire a bail bondsperson who will charge you a
fee based on the total amount of the bond required.
(cid:132) You may, in accordance with Connecticut Practice Book
Section 38-9, post a real estate bond, in the Criminal Clerk’s
Office (Room 100), using the equity in property you own to
guarantee the appearance of the defendant in court.

(cid:132) In a civil or family case, you may post a cash bond with

the Civil Clerk’s Office in Room 200.

Q. How do I get my bond money back?
A. If a cash appearance bond is posted for a criminal or motor
vehicle matter, the Criminal Clerk’s Office can return your
money upon final disposition of the case; upon the defendant
entering a diversionary program; or upon the Court ordering
the cash bond released.  However, money paid to a bail bonds-
person, is not refundable through the Clerk’s Office. The Civil
Clerk’s Office can only return an appearance bond if  ordered to
do so by the Judge or Magistrate. The clerk will need the orig-
inal receipt for the money you posted in order to return the
bond money to you. If your original receipt is lost, you must
fill out an Affidavit of Lost Bond Receipt (form is available at
the Civil and Criminal Clerk’s Offices) and you must present a
valid photo ID.

Q. How do I get a copy of  my divorce decree?
A. Requests can be made in person at the Civil Clerk’s Office,
Room 200, or through the mail. Send written requests to:
Civil Clerk, Superior Court, One Court Street, Middletown,
CT 06457. Include the docket number of your case, the names
of both the parties, the year the case was filed and the date of
judgment. Please include a check for $25 for a certified copy
($15 for a regular copy), made payable to “Clerk, Superior
Court,” and a stamped, self-addressed envelope.

Q.  Where  do  I  go  for  a  restraining  order  to  prevent
family  violence?
A. The Civil Clerk’s Office, Room 200. The Court Service
Center located in the lobby can assist you with completing
forms for temporary restraining orders.

Q. I want to talk to a judge about my case. Who is
available?
A. The Code of Ethics prohibits a judge from speaking to you
about any pending criminal or civil case or any lawsuit you
wish to bring. Judges will listen to your comments on a case
only at a scheduled hearing.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
