Why Should I Read This Book?

Probation is a time that you can use to learn 
how to make good choices. It is your chance 
to stay in the community with conditions 
instead of going to jail. You will be assigned 
a Probation Officer who will help you. If 
you follow all of the court’s conditions and 
your Probation Officer’s conditions, you will 
successfully complete your probation. However, 
if you choose not to follow the conditions 
of your probation you may be arrested for a 
Violation of Probation, and possibly go to jail.

Adult Probation would like to see you 
successfully complete your probation and end 
your involvement with the criminal justice 
system. This handbook was created to help you  
do this. Many people do well on probation and 
never find themselves in legal trouble again. 
When this happens, everyone benefits, including 
you. If you think of your probation period as an 
opportunity, rather than a punishment, you will 
have more success.

You should ask questions so you can completely 
understand what you need to do. This handbook 
will answer some common questions and 
explain some probation conditions. If you have 
difficulty understanding the handbook, please 
ask your Probation Officer to read or explain it 
to you.

Adult Probation

Frequently Asked Questions

Contacting/Meeting with Your  
Probation Officer:

1.   I was just released from prison, what is the first 

thing I should do? 
Your probation begins on the day that you finish your 
prison sentence, and you are expected to contact 
your probation officer immediately. If you were 
given instructions by a probation officer before your 
release, you must follow those instructions.

2.   What should I bring to my first appointment with 

my probation officer? 
•   Photo ID (Driver’s License or State ID card). 
•   Proof of where you live (mail, for example, a utility 

bill, which lists your name and address). 

•   Proof of employment (pay stub or letter from  

your employer). 

•   Proof of changes, if any, to your name, address, 

and/or telephone number.  

•   Proof of any completed charitable contributions, 
community service, restitution and/or treatment.

3.   What should I not bring to an appointment with 

my probation officer? 
You will pass through a metal detector and may 
be searched, so you should not bring a weapon or 
anything that can be used as a weapon.

4.   What if I cannot report to the Probation Office 

because of my job or school? 
Tell your probation officer, and he or she will see if 
there are other options.

5.   What if I cannot keep a scheduled appointment 

with my probation officer? 
Contact your probation officer immediately. If your 
probation officer is not available, ask to talk to  
a supervisor.

Adult Probation: Frequently Asked Questions

Conditions of Probation:

1.   What are my conditions of probation? 

They are the standard conditions of probation that 
apply to everyone and any special conditions ordered 
by the judge in your case. Additional conditions 
will be required if you were convicted of certain sex 
offenses. You will get a copy of the conditions of 
your probation in writing.

2.   Do I have to give a sample for an alcohol/drug test 

if the judge did not order that I be tested? 
Yes. There is a standard condition of probation 
that you must submit to “any medical and/or 
psychological examination, urinalysis, alcohol and/
or drug testing, and/or counseling sessions required 
by the Court or the Probation Officer.” The reason for 
this condition is so that your probation officer  
can help you get treatment if you have an alcohol or 
drug problem.

3.   Can my probation officer add a condition to  

my probation? 
Yes. Your probation officer may add conditions if 
he or she feels that those conditions will help you 
successfully complete probation.

4.   What do I do if I am arrested? 

If you are arrested, charged with any offense, or  
have any police contact, tell your probation officer  
as soon as possible. You may do this in person or  
by telephone.

5.   Can I travel out of the state? 

You cannot travel out of Connecticut without 
permission from your probation officer.

6.   Can I move to another US state or territory? 

Maybe. There are national rules, called the Interstate 
Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, that control 
whether you can move to another state or territory 
when you are on probation. The state or territory 
that you want to move to must agree to take over 

2

your supervision before you can move. If you have 
a reason to move to another state or territory, talk to 
your probation officer, and, if you are doing well on 
your probation, your probation officer will look into 
transferring your probation so you can move.

7.   Where do I send my restitution payments? 

If you were ordered by the judge to pay restitution, 
you will be given instructions about how to make 
payments, and Probation will send you a monthly 
restitution statement with a payment coupon. 
Payments must be in the form of a bank check or 
money order and mailed to CSSD Restitution Unit, 
936 Silas Deane Highway, 3rd Floor, Wethersfield, 
CT 06109. You must include the payment coupon that 
Probation sends to you with your payment. 

8.   Can I possess a firearm or other type of weapon? 

You cannot possess a firearm or other type of  
weapon if: 
•   You have been convicted of a felony or a 

misdemeanor crime of illegal possession of drugs, 
domestic violence involving the use or threatened 
use of physical force, or of having a deadly 
weapon. 

•   You have been convicted of certain other 
misdemeanors, as listed in your standard 
Conditions of Probation. 

•   You are subject to a Protective Order and/or a 

Restraining Order, or other court orders you not to 
possess any weapons.

9.   Do I have to give a DNA sample? 

Maybe. If you are required to give a DNA sample, 
you will get a letter telling you to give a DNA 
sample. You must follow all of the instructions in 
the letter about whom to contact for an appointment. 
You will need to bring two forms of identification to 
the appointment. If you are required to give a DNA 
sample and you do not, it is a Class D Felony, and it 
is a violation of your probation.

Adult Probation: Frequently Asked Questions

10.   What is a violation of probation?  

When you do not follow the conditions of your 
probation, or if you are arrested for a new offense, 
you have violated your probation. When this 
happens, your probation officer may bring your case 
back to court; this might include you being arrested 
on a Violation of Probation Warrant. If your case is 
brought back to court, there may be a hearing, and,  
if you are found in violation of your probation, you 
may be sentenced to jail. 

11.   What if I have a condition of No Contact with  

a person? 
You must not have, or attempt to have, any contact 
with the person. If that person tries to contact you, 
tell your probation officer immediately.

12.   Where do I do my community service hours? 

If the judge has not specifically told you where to do 
your community service, your probation officer will 
give you information about where you can do your 
community service.

13.   What if I have to attend a victim impact panel 

(VIP)? 
If the judge has ordered you to attend a VIP, your 
probation officer will give you information about 
VIPs and when you have to go. On the date that 
you are scheduled to attend the VIP, you should 
check the Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) 
website to make sure that the VIP has not been 
canceled. Do not call the VIP location or  
MADD directly. For the MADD website, go  
to http://www.madd.org/local-offices/ct/.

Other Regulations/Restrictions while  
on Probation:

1.   Who must register as a Deadly Weapon Offender? 
If you have been convicted of an offense involving 
a deadly weapon, you must register with the State 
Police. At the time that you were sentenced, the 
judge would have told you that you must register as a 
Deadly Weapon Offender or before you were released 
from incarceration, the Department of Correction 
would have told you that you must register. If you are 
required to register as a Deadly Weapon Offender and 
you do not, it is a Class D Felony, and it is a violation 
of your probation.

2.   Who must register as a Sex Offender? 

If you have been convicted of certain sexual offenses, 
you must register with the State Police. At the time 
that you were sentenced, the judge would have told 
you that you must register as a Sex Offender. If you 
are required to register as a Sex Offender and you  
do not, it is a Class D Felony, and it is a violation of 
your probation.

3.   Who must have an Ignition Interlock Device (IID) 

installed in their vehicle? 
Generally, if you have been convicted of Operating 
Under the Influence, you must have an IID installed 
in any vehicle that you own or drive if you choose  
to get your license reinstated. If you are required  
to have an IID installed, and you drive a car that  
does not have an IID, you face the same criminal 
penalty as you would for operating a motor vehicle 
with a suspended license, and it is a violation of  
your probation.

Adult Probation: Frequently Asked Questions

Receiving Services while on Probation:

1.   What is a case plan? 

It is a plan that you and your probation officer make 
together to help you meet your treatment and/or 
service needs and to successfully complete probation.

2.   Will my probation officer help me get health 
insurance and/or other state assistance? 
Yes. At the beginning of your probation, your 
probation officer will help you apply for health 
insurance through the state (Husky D) or other state 
assistance for which you may be eligible to help pay 
for any treatment and/or needs that you may have.

3.   Are there services for veterans? 

Yes. If you are a veteran, you can ask your probation 
officer about services for veterans, and your probation 
officer can refer you to the state and/or federal 
Department of Veterans’ Affairs for services that are 
available to veterans.

4.   Why is it important that I get treatment? 

Your probation officer may refer you to a treatment 
program. There are many different types of treatment. 
These programs will help you improve your situation; 
they are not a punishment. However, if you do not 
cooperate with treatment, it may result in a Violation 
of Probation. You may not want to go to treatment. 
This is normal. Programs require your time and 
effort. The most important first step for you is to go. 
Once there, if you look at treatment as an opportunity, 
you will get the most out of it. Give yourself the best 
chance for success. 

5.   Why do I have to sign a Release of Information? 
You must sign a Release of Information so that your 
probation officer can get information about how you 
are doing at the treatment program and proof that you 
finished the program.

6

6.   How can I get information about services in  

the community? 
You can dial 2-1-1 (United Way 2-1-1) 24 hours a 
day, every day of the year, to get information about 
local services. The call specialists speak several 
languages. The hearing impaired may use a TDD 
or dial 7-1-1, and you can get information on the 
internet at http://www.211ct.org. United Way 2-1-
1 can help you with referrals for housing, financial 
needs, health insurance, substance abuse and mental 
health treatment, social services, benefits, suicide 
prevention, and help in a crisis.

Other Probation Supervision  
Information:

1.   What does it mean when Probation’s 

Administrative Monitoring Program supervises 
my case? 
If your case is being monitored by the Administrative 
Monitoring Program, you will not be required to 
report to a probation officer, but you will be required 
to provide proof that you have completed the 
conditions that were ordered by the court. During 
your intake, you will be given information on 
programs that you can use to meet the conditions of 
your probation. If you have any questions, you can 
contact the Administrative Monitoring Program.

2.   Can I finish my probation early? 

Maybe. State law allows certain sentences of 
probation to be reviewed to see if they should end 
early. Your probation officer will tell you if your 
case can be reviewed under this law. In making a 
recommendation about ending your probation early, 
your probation officer will consider how you have 
done in several areas, including following your 
conditions of probation, taking part in programs, and 
showing improvement in areas that caused you to get 
in trouble in the past.

Adult Probation: Frequently Asked Questions

Certificates of Employability:

1.   What is a Certificate of Employability? 

A Certificate of Employability is a document that tells 
employers and licensing agencies that CSSD thinks 
that your prior conviction(s) should not keep you 
from getting a job or a professional license. If you are 
on probation, you can apply to CSSD for a Certificate 
of Employability. If CSSD grants your application, 
CSSD may issue you a certificate that covers all of 
the barriers and forfeitures (reasons why an employer 
or licensing agency could deny your application) that 
come about when you get a conviction, or, depending 
on your situation, CSSD could issue you a certificate 
that covers only some of the barriers and forfeitures, 
or only some of your convictions. 

2.   Does a Certificate of Employability erase my 

criminal record? 
No. A Certificate of Employability only tells 
employers and licensing agencies that they cannot 
deny your application just because you have a 
conviction. It does not erase your criminal record, and 
it does not guarantee that you will get the job or the 
license that you are applying for. It also will not allow 
you to get a job in law enforcement, or allow you to 
keep, or to be eligible to run for, public office.

3.   How do I apply for a Certificate of Employability? 
If you are on probation, you can get an application 
for a Certificate of Employability on the Judicial 
Branch website or you can ask your probation 
officer for one. If you want more information about 
Certificates of Employability or if you need help 
getting or filling out an application for a Certificate 
of Employability, talk to your probation officer. Once 
you complete your probation, if you want to apply for 
a Certificate of Employability, you must apply for one 
from the Board of Pardons and Paroles. CSSD cannot 
issue Certificates of Employability to anyone other 
than individuals who are currently on probation.

Pardons:

1.   What is a pardon? 

A pardon is something issued by the Board of 
Pardons and Paroles (BOPP) that works to cancel out 
your conviction and allows the records related to that 
conviction, including police and court records, to be 
erased (made non-disclosable to anyone but you) as 
long as the BOPP makes the pardon “absolute” (with 
no conditions). If you get an absolute pardon from the 
BOPP, you can say, even under oath, that you were 
never convicted of the crime that was pardoned.

2.   Am I eligible for a pardon? 

You may be eligible or a pardon if enough time has 
gone by since your last conviction, and you do not 
have any criminal charges pending in Connecticut or 
anywhere else. You must wait at least three years after 
your last misdemeanor conviction and at least five 
years after your last felony conviction before you are 
eligible for a pardon.

3.   How do I apply for a pardon? 

If you want to apply for a pardon, you must send an 
application to the BOPP. Your probation officer does 
not have the authority to grant a pardon. At the end of 
your probation, your probation officer will give you 
information about applying for a pardon. Or, you can 
get information about applying for a pardon at the 
BOPP website: www.ct.gov/bopp, or you can contact 
the BOPP by phone at (203) 805-6643 or by e-mail at 
ct.bpp@ct.gov.

Adult Probation: Frequently Asked Questions

Rights While on Probation:

1.   Can I vote? 

Maybe. If you want to vote, you must be registered 
in the town where you live. If you were incarcerated 
before you went on probation, you may have to 
get your voting rights back before you can register 
to vote. If you have any questions, contact the 
Connecticut Secretary of State Elections Office:  
(860) 509-6100, Toll Free (800) 540-3764, TDD 
(860) 509-6191. 

2.   What are my rights as a probationer? 

You have the right to be treated in a respectful and 
professional manner that is free of any form of 
harassment, bias, or discrimination because of your 
race, color, age, religion, sex, gender identity or 
expression, sexual orientation, marital status, place of 
birth, ancestry, or disability. 

3.   What do I do if I feel that my rights have  

been violated? 
•   First, talk to your probation officer, and try to 

resolve the problem with your officer. 

•   If you feel that you cannot resolve the problem  
with your probation officer, ask to speak to your 
officer’s supervisor. 

•   If you still cannot resolve the problem, you can call

936 Silas Deane Highway, 3rd Floor, Wethersfield, 
CT 06109. 

10

•   Your probation will not be affected if you file  

a complaint or a grievance. 

•   Filing a complaint or a grievance does not 

excuse you from continuing to follow all of your 
conditions of probation.

Tips for Success

conditions of probation. If you have 
questions, ask your probation officer.

people who really want to see you do 
well, such as friends, family, co-workers, 
and formal support groups. 

•   Take ownership of your probation by 

becoming an active participant. 
•   Be open to the guidance from your  

•   The responsibility for making changes in 

probation officer. 

your life is yours.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
