Chief Justice’s Letter 

To the Governor, General Assembly and the Residents of the State of Connecticut: 

As it has been in previous years, it is again my pleasure to present to you this 
Biennial Report on the Connecticut Judicial Branch for the years 2012-2014. We 
have dedicated this edition to “Keeping Courts Relevant in a Changing Society.” 

It goes without saying that it’s imperative for our state courts to remain relevant 
for the people we serve. Thus, the Judicial Branch is amid an ambitious 
restructuring of how civil matters are processed. Additionally, we are currently 
examining existing processes in our family court, with the goal of better meeting 
the needs of the people we serve. 

Our focus on civil matters has already led to substantial improvements that this 
year’s biennial report will highlight. I should also note that the issues we face in 
this area are mirrored across the country, as other state court systems grapple 
with the increasing costs of litigation, the greater complexity of substantive issues 
in cases, the growing number of self-represented parties and the challenges of 
providing the appropriate type of dispute resolution. Moreover, we’ve learned 
 
that despite the good that technology has brought about – electronic filing, 
 
for example – it is not a “fix-all” solution and more often than not creates 
new challenges. 

The Judicial Branch, however, will meet the challenge, assisted by its excellent 
judges and staff. I look forward to working with the Legislative and Executive 
branches as we move forward. 

Very truly yours, 

Chase T. Rogers 
Chief Justice

Chief Court Administrator’s Letter 

To the Governor, General Assembly and the Residents of the State of Connecticut: 

At the direction of Chief Justice Chase T. Rogers, the Judicial Branch has spent 
much of the past two years re-engineering how we process civil matters. I’m 
pleased to report that we already have seen many improvements from this 
ongoing effort and vision for the future. 

The Branch – through a series of focus groups with the bar and judges – 
identified four areas that are the focus of our civil re-engineering efforts. They 
are: improving civil litigation management; confronting current discovery issues; 
enhancing alternative dispute resolution options; and addressing the needs and 
impact of self-represented parties. 

I draw your attention to one initiative in particular: individual calendaring. 
We believe that this method of processing civil matters will not only improve 
consistency and predictability but will also reduce the costs of litigation. With 
individual calendaring, one judge is assigned to a case from start to finish. We’ve 
implemented this process in Waterbury, New Britain and Stamford and hope to 
have it statewide by the end of the year. The advantages are many: to start with, 
we anticipate that the cost to parties will be reduced. In addition, individual 
calendaring will increase the possibility of settlement at an earlier stage of the 
proceedings. Granted, some disputes cannot be resolved short of trial but in 
those cases where it is reasonable and feasible, an earlier resolution benefits 
everyone involved. 
 

The Judicial Branch also continues to address the increase of self-represented 
parties. These efforts are an integral part of the re-engineering efforts because 
it is imperative that we ensure access to justice for self-represented litigants. At 
the same time, we must ensure that court officials and employees do not provide 
legal advice to these litigants. Specific accomplishments in this area will be 
highlighted in this report. 

We will continue to make improvements to the court system, always guided by 
our mission to resolve disputes in a fair, timely, efficient and open manner. I hope 
that you find this report to be useful. 

Very truly yours, 

Judge Patrick L. Carroll III 
Chief Court Administrator

The Supreme Court is the state’s highest court. It 

consists of the chief justice, six associate justices 
and one senior justice. 

The Supreme Court reviews rulings made in the Appellate 
and Superior courts to determine if any errors have 
occurred. The court sits en banc – in panels of seven – 
in cases in which there are no disqualifications. When 
one justice has recused him or herself from hearing a 
matter, the court sits as a panel of six. If there are two 
disqualifications, the court sits as a panel of five. In all 
death penalty cases, the court sits en banc. 

The Supreme Court goes “on circuit” annually and 
schedules actual arguments at a school, where students 
get a first-hand look at how an appellate court works. The 
sessions are held in the same way as they would be held in 
the Supreme Court’s courtroom. Educators and students 
are supplied with advance materials, including briefs. 
After the arguments, informational talks are held for the 
students, with counsel who argued the cases. 

During the biennium, the Court visited New Haven’s 
Wilbur Cross High School in October 2012 and Tolland 
High School in October 2013.

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Supreme Court 

 
During the Biennium
 

Ulbrich v. Groth, 310 Conn. 375 (2013). 

The named plaintiff purchased certain real estate and 
personal property at a combined foreclosure sale and 
secured party auction conducted pursuant to Article 9 
of the Connecticut Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). 
Thereafter, the plaintiffs discovered that there were 
conflicting claims to the ownership of the property 
and that they would not receive many of the items 
that they had believed were included in the sale. The 
plaintiffs brought an action against the owners of the 
property, the bank that had held security interests in 
the property and the company that had conducted the 
auction of the property, claiming, among other things, 
that the defendants knew, but had failed to inform the 
plaintiffs, of the conflicting claims. The plaintiffs alleged 
that this failure constituted negligence and negligent 
misrepresentation, breach of the warranty of title in 
violation of the UCC and a violation of the Connecticut 
Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA). The jury returned 
a verdict for the plaintiffs and awarded substantial 
damages. On appeal, the defendants claimed, among 
other things, that the plaintiffs’ tort and CUTPA claims 
were barred by the economic loss doctrine, which bars 
negligence claims for commercial losses arising from 
the defective performance of contracts; a secured party 
seller and an auctioneer at a secured party sale owe no 
common-law duty of care to the buyer; the plaintiffs 
could not prevail on the breach of warranty of title claim 
when the bank had disclaimed any warranty of title; 
the trial court had improperly instructed the jury on 
the standard for CUTPA claims; and the evidence was 
insufficient to support a finding of a CUTPA violation. 
In an opinion authored by Justice Vertefeuille, a majority 
of the court concluded that (1) the defendants had no 
common law duty to ensure that they had the authority 

to sell the property that was separate and distinct from 
their warranty of title obligations under the UCC; (2) 
because the plaintiffs’ tort claims were premised on the 
same alleged conduct as their contract claims pursuant 
to the UCC, the tort claims were barred by the economic 
loss doctrine; (3) the economic loss doctrine did not bar 
the plaintiffs’ CUTPA claims; (4) quitclaim language in 
the bills of sale was inadequate to constitute a disclaimer 
of the warranty of title under Article 9 of the UCC; (5) 
the defendants’ claim that the trial court improperly had 
instructed the jury on the standard for CUTPA claims 
was unpreserved; and (6) evidence that the defendants 
had known about the conflicting claims to the property, 
that they believed that they had an obligation to disclose 
the conflicting claims and that they deliberately chose 
not to disclose what they knew was sufficient to support 
the finding of a CUTPA violation. The court ordered the 
trial court to grant the defendants’ motion to set aside the 
verdict on the tort counts, but affirmed the verdicts on 
the other counts. Justice Zarella authored a concurring 
and dissenting opinion, in which Justice Palmer joined, 
contending that the language in the bills of sale was 
adequate to disclaim the warranty of title under the UCC, 
that the defendant’s claim that the trial court improperly 
had instructed the jury on CUTPA was preserved and 
that the court should modify its CUTPA jurisprudence 
by bringing into alignment with the approach taken by 
federal authorities. 

Dowling v. Szymczak, 309 Conn. 390 (2013). 

This state’s child support guidelines reflect the principle 
that the proportion of household income spent on 
children declines as household income increases. 
Specifically, the guidelines’ schedule of basic child support 
obligations supplies presumptive levels of support on 

6   |  Biennial Report 2012-2014 

   

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Supreme Court During the Biennium 

maximum permissible amount that may be awarded. On 
the basis of the principle that the percentage of income 
spent on children declines as income rises, however, the 
court previously had held that child support payments for 
households with net weekly incomes exceeding $4,000 
presumptively should not exceed the maximum percent 
for households with income at that level. Because the 
family support magistrate’s calculation of the total child 
support obligation did not exceed that percentage, the 
court concluded that the magistrate had not abused 
 
his discretion. 

Lopez v. Board of Education, 310 Conn. 576 (2013). 

The plaintiffs, taxpayers of the city of Bridgeport, brought 
a quo warranto action against the defendant, the acting 
superintendent of the city’s public schools, claiming that 
he was not qualified to act as superintendent because 
he was not certified as a school superintendent and he 
had failed to satisfy certain statutory requirements that 
would allow the commissioner of education to waive the 
certification requirement. The defendant contended that 
action must be dismissed because a quo warranto action 
cannot be used to challenge a state administrative agency’s 
licensing determination that serves as a prerequisite for 
a particular public office. After the trial court rendered 
judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, the defendant 
appealed. In an opinion authored by Justice Flemming 
L. Norcott, Jr.*, the court concluded that a quo warranto 
action may not be used to attack a licensing decision that 
is committed by the legislature to a state agency. Rather, 
the proper way to attack the agency’s decision was in an 
administrative forum. Accordingly, the court ordered that 
the action be dismissed. 

* Justice Norcott became a judge trial referee during the biennium, having reached the 

 
mandatory retirement age of 70.

the basis of the parents’ combined net weekly income, 
but only up to $4,000 of such income. The minimum 
weekly combined child support obligation for one child 
at that income level is $473 per week and the maximum 
proportion of total net income is 11.83 percent. The 
primary issue presented in this case was whether the 
family support magistrate properly determined that the 
parties’ total child support obligation was 11.83 percent 
of the parties’ combined net weekly income of $14,154, 
or $1,674 per week. The defendant claimed that this 
determination violated the principle that, as income 
level rises, the proportion of income dedicated to child-
related spending decreases. The court concluded, in an 
opinion authored by Justice McDonald, that, while the 
guidelines provide the presumptive minimum amount of 
the award in high income cases, they do not address the

Blumberg Associates Worldwide, Inc. v. Brown & 
Brown of Connecticut, Inc., 311 Conn. 123 (2014). 

In this case, the court was required to determine the 
circumstances under which a reviewing court, on its 
own initiative, may raise and decide an issue that was not 
raised by the parties on appeal. The plaintiff had brought 
a breach of contract action against the defendants, 
alleging, among other things, that the named defendants’ 
termination of a contract between the parties was a 
breach of contract because (1) the defendants’ conduct 
had prevented the plaintiff from satisfying a contractual 
condition, on which failure the defendants had relied 
in terminating the contract and (2) the defendants had 
breached a contractual provision requiring the parties 
to cooperate with each other. The trial court rendered 
summary judgment for the defendants on the ground 
that the plaintiff had not proved that the defendants had 
prevented the plaintiff from satisfying the contractual 
condition and that, even if the defendants’ conduct had 
contributed to the plaintiff ’s breach, that conduct could 
not constitute a breach of the contractual cooperation 
requirement because it had occurred before the parties 
entered into the contract. The plaintiff appealed to the 
Appellate Court, which, on its own initiative, ordered 
supplemental briefs on the question of whether the 
plaintiff ’s breach of contract claim based on its prevention 
theory should fail because the defendants’ conduct had 
occurred prior to the execution of the contract. The 
plaintiff contended that the Appellate Court should not 
address that issue because the defendants had not raised 
it. The Appellate Court ultimately addressed the issue 
and concluded that plaintiff ’s claim under the prevention 
theory must fail because the alleged conduct by the 
named defendants had occurred before the contract was 
executed. The plaintiff then appealed to the Supreme 
Court alleging that the Appellate Court improperly 
had resolved the appeal on the basis of an issue that the 
defendants had not raised. In an opinion authored by 
Justice Palmer, the court first reviewed the jurisprudential 

principles underlying the court’s reluctance to address 
claims that have not been raised by the parties below or 
on appeal and the numerous cases in which appellate 
courts had, nevertheless, reviewed such claims. The 
court concluded that a reviewing court is justified in 
raising an unpreserved issue on its own initiative when 
the issue implicates subject matter jurisdiction, plain 
error or constitutional error, as long as the reviewing 
court provides the parties with an opportunity to brief 
the issue. The court further concluded that, if none of 
these circumstances is present, the reviewing court may 
raise an unpreserved issue on its own initiative only if (1) 
exceptional circumstances exist that would justify review 
of the issue if raised by a party, (2) the court provides 
an opportunity for the parties to be heard on the issue 
and (3) no party would be unduly prejudiced by review 
of the issue. Applying these principles to the plaintiff ’s 
claim that the Appellate Court had improperly raised and 
addressed the issue on its own, the court concluded that 
the Appellate Court had not abused its discretion because 
the issue implicated the Appellate Court’s subject matter 
jurisdiction, because the issue likely would have arisen 
on remand had the plaintiff prevailed on appeal and 
because the failure to raise the issue could have resulted in 
confusion in the law. Addressing the merits of the issue, 
the court concluded that the Appellate Court properly 
had determined that the plaintiff ’s prevention claim failed 
as a matter of law. 

Greenwald v. Van Handel, 311 Conn. 370 (2014). 

The plaintiff brought a professional negligence action 
against a licensed clinical social worker alleging that the 
defendant had negligently failed to treat the plaintiff after 
he disclosed to the defendant that he had viewed child 
pornography. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant’s 
failure to treat him had caused him to be subjected to a 
police task force raid and had led to emotional distress 
and other injuries due to potential criminal prosecution.

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Supreme Court During the Biennium 

interpretation of a regulation implementing the applicable 
state law as providing greater benefits than federal law 
was not entitled to deference by the court because the 
interpretation was not time-tested, reasonable or the 
result of formal rule-making. Applying the federal law 
to the plaintiff ’s claim, the court concluded that the trial 
court properly had determined that the plaintiff was 
not entitled to compensation for his commuting time. 
Justice McDonald authored a concurring opinion, in 
which Justice Palmer joined, in which he argued that 
the applicable federal law was not more generous than 
state law and, therefore, did not preempt state law. Justice 
McDonald would have concluded, however, that the 
plaintiff was not entitled to compensation under state law. 

Justice McDonald authored an opinion in which a 
majority of the court concluded that the trial court 
properly had struck the plaintiff ’s complaint pursuant 
to the common-law principle that a plaintiff cannot 
maintain a tort action for injuries that are sustained as 
the direct result of the plaintiff ’s knowing and intentional 
participation in a criminal act. The court declined to 
consider certain limitations on this rule applied in 
other jurisdictions, as none of them permitted recovery 
under the facts of the present case, wherein the plaintiff 
admitted to conduct constituting a serious felony, the 
conduct had a direct causal connection to the alleged 
injuries, the defendant had not participated in the illegal 
conduct, and no statute allowed persons similarly situated 
to the plaintiff to recover for the alleged injuries. Justice 
Eveleigh authored a dissenting opinion in which he 
contended that the wrongful conduct rule is ill suited 
to tort actions, undermines the comparative negligence 
statute and is outdated. Accordingly, he would have 
concluded that the trial court improperly had struck the 
plaintiff ’s complaint. 

Sarrazin v. Coastal, Inc., 311 Conn. 581 (2014). 

The plaintiff brought an action against his employer 
pursuant to a state statute seeking payment of overtime 
wages for, among other things, time spent commuting 
between his home and job sites in a company vehicle. 
The trial court concluded that a federal law governing 
travel time and overtime preempted the applicable state 
law and that, under the federal law, the plaintiff was not 
entitled to overtime compensation. On appeal, a majority 
of the court concluded, in an opinion authored by Justice 
Espinosa, that, because the applicable federal law required 
compensation for an employee’s regular commute under 
certain circumstances and the applicable state law did not, 
the federal law was more generous than the state law and, 
therefore, preempted it. In reaching this determination, 
the court concluded that the state Department of Labor’s

Robbins v. Physicians for Women’s Health, LLC, 311 
Conn. 707 (2014). 

The plaintiff brought a medical malpractice action against 
certain physicians, the professional corporation that 
employed the physicians and two corporate defendants 
who had purchased the professional corporation after 
the occurrence of the events that had led to the lawsuit. 
The plaintiff ultimately settled her claims against the 
physicians and the professional corporation, entered 
into two covenants not to sue them and withdrew the 
action against them. The corporate defendants then filed 
a motion for summary judgment arguing that they could 
not be liable to the plaintiff under a theory of successor 
liability because any such liability was purely derivative of 
the professional corporation’s liability, and the covenant 
not to sue had completely discharged the professional 
corporation from liability. The trial court granted the 
motion, and the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court. 
A divided Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the 
trial court, and the corporate defendants appealed to the 
Supreme Court arguing that, unlike a release, a covenant 
not to sue does not release nonsettling parties and the 
covenant not to sue the professional corporation had been 
intended to preserve the claims against the corporate 
defendants. In an opinion authored by Justice Zarella, the 
court concluded that successor liability is limited to the 
existing liability of the predecessor corporation. Because 
a covenant not to sue terminates the liability of the party 
against whom a right of action could have been brought, 
the plaintiff ’s covenant not to sue the professional 
corporation in perpetuity foreclosed her right of action 
against the successor corporate defendants. In reaching 
this conclusion, the court distinguished cases holding that 
joint tortfeasors and employers who are vicariously liable 
for their employees’ torts may be held liable even when 
the plaintiff has entered a covenant not to sue the active 
wrongdoer because joint tortfeasors and employers are 
directly connected to the wrongful conduct. Accordingly,

the court reversed the judgment of the Appellate Court 
and affirmed the judgment of the trial court in favor of 
the defendants. 

State v. Elson, 311 Conn. 726 (2014). 

The defendant in this case appealed from his criminal 
conviction to the Appellate Court claiming that the 
trial court had deprived him of his constitutional right 
to due process when it considered certain improper 
factors at the time of sentencing, including the fact that 
he had not pleaded guilty to the charges against him, 
but had exercised his constitutional right to a jury trial. 
A majority of the Appellate Court ultimately concluded 
that the defendant’s claim was not reviewable because 
he had not raised it before the trial court and he had 
not affirmatively requested review pursuant to State v.

Golding, 213 Conn. 233 (1989), which sets forth the 
conditions under which an appellate court may review 
unpreserved constitutional claims. The defendant then 
appealed to the Supreme Court, which, in an opinion 
authored by Justice Norcott, overruled the cases holding 
that a defendant must make an affirmative request for 
review of an unpreserved constitutional claim pursuant 
to Golding. Rather, the court concluded, to obtain review 
of an unpreserved constitutional claim, a defendant need 
only raise the claim in his main brief, present a record 
that is adequate for review and affirmatively demonstrate 
that a fundamental constitutional right was violated. 
Because the defendant’s brief satisfied these requirements, 
the court addressed the merits of his constitutional claim 
and concluded that he had not proved that the trial court 
penalized him for exercising his constitutional right 
to a jury trial. Nevertheless, because the trial court’s 
comments at sentencing had created the appearance 
that it might have considered the defendant’s election of 
a trial in determining his sentence, the court exercised 
its supervisory authority to grant the defendant a new 
sentencing proceeding. 

Kortner v. Martise, 312 Conn. 1 (2014). 

The named plaintiff, acting as the conservator of 
her daughter’s person, brought an action against the 
defendant alleging that he had committed sexual battery, 
civil assault and intentional infliction of emotional 
distress against the daughter. The jury returned a verdict 
for the defendant and the trial court rendered judgment 
accordingly. On appeal, the plaintiff contended that 
the trial court improperly had denied her motion to 
set aside the verdict because a document that had not 
been admitted into evidence had been given to the jury 
during its deliberations. In addition, she claimed that the 
trial court had improperly had allowed the defendant 
to raise her daughter’s consent to the sexual activity as 

an affirmative defense because, as a conservatee, the 
daughter did not have the legal capacity to consent. In his 
cross-appeal, the defendant claimed that the trial court 
improperly had instructed the jury that it could consider 
the daughter’s conservatee status when determining 
her ability to consent. After the appeal and cross-appeal 
were heard by this court, the court ordered supplemental 
briefing on the question of whether the named plaintiff 
had standing to commence an action in her daughter’s 
name as conservator of her person and, if not, whether, 
after the death of the daughter, the plaintiff ’s motion to 
substitute herself as the plaintiff as administratrix of the 
daughter’s estate cured the jurisdictional defect. In an 
opinion authored by Justice Eveleigh, a majority of the 
court concluded that: (1) even if the named plaintiff did 
not have standing to bring the action as conservator of 
her daughter’s person, any jurisdictional defect was cured 
by her substitution as the plaintiff; (2) the submission to 
the jury of the document that had not been admitted as 
evidence was improper and constituted harmful error; 
(3) in light of the public policy that conserved persons 
should retain as much decision-making authority and 
independence as possible and that a conservator’s role 
should be limited to as to accomplish that objective, the 
trial court properly concluded that the daughter was not 
unable to consent to sexual conduct as a matter of law; 
and (4) the trial court properly instructed the jury that 
it could consider the daughter’s status as a conservatee 
when determining whether she had consented to the 
sexual conduct. In a concurring opinion. Justice Palmer 
argued that the plaintiff had waived her right to challenge 
the submission to the jury of the document had not 
been admitted as evidence because she agreed to have it 
marked as an exhibit and submitted to the jury, but that 
the court clerk’s failure to inform the trial court about 
the jury’s concerns about the document rendered the 
submission of the document to the jury improper.

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Supreme Court During the Biennium 

Justice McDonald authored a concurring and dissenting 
opinion in which he contended that the named plaintiff 
had standing to bring suit because the daughter had 
effectively ratified the action; the plaintiff had waived any 
challenge to the submission to the jury of the document 
that had not been admitted as an exhibit, but that the 
court clerk’s conduct rendered the submission improper; 
and the submission of the document to the jury was 
harmless error. Justice Vertefeuille authored a concurring 
and dissenting opinion in which she agreed with Justice 
McDonald’s conclusion that the submission of the 
document to the jury was improper, but harmless. 

Commissioner of Public Safety v. Freedom of 
Information Commission, 312 Conn. 51 (2014). 

This case involved the scope of a law enforcement 
agency’s disclosure obligations under the Freedom 
of Information Act with respect to pending criminal 
prosecutions. A newspaper reporter requested that the 
plaintiff provide her with access to the police report of 
a particular incident pursuant to a specific provision of 
the act governing arrest records during the pendency 
of a criminal case. The plaintiff declined to provide the 
police report, but provided a press release describing 
the incident, as required by the provision. The reporter 
appealed to the defendant, which ordered the plaintiff 
to disclose additional records. The defendant reasoned 
that, when the specific provision of the act mandating 
disclosure of arrest records during the pendency of 
a criminal proceeding did not apply to a request for 
particular records, the general provisions of the act 
applied. The plaintiff appealed to the trial court, which 
concluded that disclosure of the press release was 
sufficient to comply with the act. On appeal, the Appellate 

Court affirmed the ruling of the trial court. The defendant 
then appealed to the Supreme Court. In an opinion 
authored by Justice Robinson, the court concluded that 
the plaintiff ’s disclosure obligations under the act during 
a pending prosecution were exclusively governed by the 
specific provision of the act governing disclosure of arrest 
records. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment of 
the trial court. 

State v. Wang, 312 Conn. 222 (2014). 

The defendant, who was indigent, had waived the right to 
counsel and was representing himself in his criminal case 
with the assistance of standby counsel. He claimed that he 
was constitutionally entitled to public defender or other 
public funds to secure the assistance of an investigator 
and/or experts whose services were reasonably necessary 
to formulate and present a defense. This matter came 
before the court pursuant to a statute that authorizes the 
trial court to reserve questions of law to the Supreme 
Court. Chief Justice Rogers authored an opinion in which 
the court concluded that the federal constitution requires 
the state to provide an indigent self-represented criminal 
defendant with expert or investigative assistance when 
the defendant has made a threshold showing that such 
assistance is reasonably necessary for the preparation and 
presentation of a defense. The court also held that the 
legislature had authorized the Public Defender Services 
Commission to fund reasonably necessary ancillary 
defense costs incurred by court-appointed standby 
counsel at the request of an indigent self-represented 
defendant. Finally, the court concluded that the Public 
Defender Services Commission, not the trial court, must 
make the determination as to whether such defense costs 
are reasonably necessary.

The Appellate Court reviews decisions of the 

Superior Court to determine if errors of law have 
occurred. There are nine Appellate Court judges, 
one of whom is designated by the chief justice to be the 
chief judge. 

Generally, three judges hear and decide a case. The court 
may, however, sit en banc, which means that the entire 
court participates in the ruling. After an appeal has been 
decided by the Appellate Court, the Supreme Court 
can certify it for further review, upon the petition of an 
aggrieved party or by the Appellate Court panel that 
decided the case, if three justices of the Supreme Court 
vote for certification. 

The Appellate Court also goes “on circuit” annually and 
schedules actual arguments at a school, where students 
get a first-hand look at how the Appellate Court works. 
The sessions are held in the same way as they would be 
held in the Appellate Court’s courtroom. Teachers and 
students are supplied with advance materials, including 
briefs. After the arguments, informational talks are held 
for the students, with counsel who argued the cases. 

During the biennium, the Court visited Branford High

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Appellate Court 

 
During the Biennium
 

Vazquez v. Buhl, 150 Conn. App. 117 (2014). 

The plaintiff brought this action against NBC Universal 
Media, LLC (defendant) for, inter alia, defamation, 
in connection with online news articles containing 
defamatory statements about the plaintiff that the 
defendant Teri Buhl had published on her website. A 
senior editor of a website owned and operated by the 
defendant also published an online article that urged 
viewers to read Buhl’s online article and included a 
hyperlink to Buhl’s online articles that contained the 
allegedly defamatory statements. The defendant filed a 
motion to strike the plaintiff ’s complaint on the ground 
that the Communications Decency Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. 
§ 230 et seq., which immunizes providers of interactive 
computer services from civil liability in tort with respect 
to material disseminated by them but created by others, 
barred all counts alleged against it. The trial court granted 
the defendant’s motion to strike. The plaintiff appealed. 

On appeal, the Appellate Court upheld the decision of 
the trial court. The Appellate Court disagreed with the 
plaintiff ’s claim that the defendant could only invoke 
the protection of § 230 (c) (1) if Buhl had directly 
transmitted the allegedly defamatory statements to the 
defendant in its role as an interactive computer service 
provider, but not where the defendant itself discovered 
the articles and posted a hyperlink to them on its website. 
The Appellate Court further held that it was immaterial 
that the defendant amplified, adopted or endorsed Buhl’s 
statements because it played no role in their composition. 
The allegations addressed only the defendant’s conduct 
after the actionable statements were conceived, written 
and published by Buhl and, without more, the allegations 
did not fall within the meaning of “development in part,” 
as defined in the case law interpreting the language of 
§ 230 (f) (3); accordingly the defendant was entitled 
to the protection of § 230 (c) (1) because it was not an 
“information content provider.” 

Devone v. Finley, 148 Conn. App. 647, cert. denied, 
312 Conn. 912 (2014). 

The plaintiff father filed an application in Connecticut 
for custody of the parties’ minor child, who was born out 
of wedlock in Georgia, where he resided primarily with 
the defendant mother. The plaintiff, who also resided in 
Georgia until late 2011, had shared parenting time with 
the defendant. In 2012, the plaintiff, who was then living 
in Connecticut, had requested and was granted by the 
defendant a three week visit with the child in this state. 
The plaintiff subsequently refused to return the child to 
the defendant in Georgia and ultimately surrendered 
himself in Connecticut on a warrant for a felony charge 
of interstate interference with custody. Thereafter, the 
defendant obtained an emergency temporary custody 
order from the Georgia Superior Court, in which that 
court ordered that the defendant shall have immediate 
custody of the minor child. The trial court subsequently 
granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss for lack of 
subject matter jurisdiction and rendered judgment 
thereon, from which the plaintiff appealed. 

On appeal, the plaintiff claimed that the trial court 
improperly afforded full faith and credit to Georgia law, 
under which the defendant had sole right to the custody 
of the parties’ child. He argued that the court should have 
determined where the child lived or had recently lived 
in order to determine the home state of the child and 
the jurisdictional law that it should apply. The Appellate 
Court held that the trial court properly dismissed the 
plaintiff ’s application for custody for lack of subject 
matter jurisdiction, as the plaintiff had no recognized 
custody rights over the minor child and lacked standing 
to bring a custody application in this state. The court 
reasoned that the Georgia Superior Court, in accordance 
with the law prescribed by its state, had issued a 
temporary custody order giving the defendant immediate 
custody of the minor child and found that because the 
plaintiff had failed to legitimize the child, the defendant 
was the only party entitled to custody of the child, and 
the full faith and credit clause of the federal constitution 
requires our courts to recognize and enforce the judgment 
of the Georgia Superior Court.

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Appellate Court During the Biennium 

Brye v. State, 147 Conn. App. 173 (2013). 

The plaintiff, an inmate, brought a negligence action 
against the state of Connecticut seeking to recover 
damages for personal injuries he allegedly had sustained 
at a correctional facility. The plaintiff was on a stage 
area in a gym facility when a plywood cover over a 
portion of the stage on which he was standing collapsed, 
causing him to fall. The trial court determined that 
the plaintiff, inter alia, failed to offer expert testimony 
that the use of the plywood created the dangerous 
condition. The Appellate Court held that the trial court 
properly determined that the plaintiff failed to provide 
the necessary expert testimony to prove that the state 
had breached the standard of care in installing one-
quarter inch plywood over the lighting pit; even if, as 
claimed by the plaintiff, the trial court expressed an 
improper standard when it stated that it must apply its 
own experience and its extremely limited knowledge of 
carpentry, structural concepts and engineering principles, 
expert testimony was needed in this case because it was 
not within the ken of the average fact finder 
that the use of one-quarter inch plywood 
to cover the lighting pit would create a 
dangerous condition. 

Mackenzie v. Planning and Zoning Commission of 
the Town of Monroe, 146 Conn. App. 406 (2013). 

Real Time Investments, LLC (defendant), owned a 
4.027 acre parcel at 579 Main Street in Monroe. In 2010, 
it filed an application with the Planning and Zoning 
Commission of the Town of Monroe requesting a zone 
change for a 1.15 acre portion of its property from 
Residential and Farming District C to Design Business 
District 1 and requesting a special exception and site plan 
approval in order to construct a McDonald’s restaurant 
on that property. During the initial public hearing on 
the application, residents voiced concerns that the 
architectural design of the restaurant was unappealing, 
and it was discussed that the planned parking area 
violated the setback and landscape buffer requirement 
of the zoning regulations. When the public hearing 
reconvened, the defendant presented an alternate plan 
for a more colonial style building and a parking area 
that fully complied with the regulations, but it argued 
that the commission had the authority to waive or vary 

its regulations pursuant to §§ 117-1103 and 

117-900 (E) of the regulations. Following 
the conclusion of the public hearing, 

the commission voted unanimously to 
approve the zone change application.

Appellate Court Courtroom 

The commission then discussed whether the original 
plan, which violated the setback and landscaping buffer, 
or the plan that fully complied with the regulations, 
but was less appealing, should be granted. By a vote of 
four to one, the commission voted to grant the special 
exception pursuant to the original plan, though subject to 
the revised landscaping plan submitted by the defendant. 
Several area homeowners, all of whom owned property 
within 100 feet of the defendant’s property, filed a timely 
appeal to the Superior Court, claiming in relevant 
part that the waiver of the parking area setback and 
landscaping buffer were invalid. On appeal, the Superior 
Court concluded that the commission acted within 
its authority. 

 

After certification was granted, the Appellate Court 
examined §§ 117-1103 and 117-900 (E) of the Monroe 
zoning regulations, which, the commission argued, 
gave it the authority to vary the buffer and setback 
requirements on a case by case basis. Section 117-1103 
sets forth the dimensional requirements applicable to 
design business districts, and it also provides that in 

certain instances the commission “may modify lot area, 
frontage, minimum square and yard requirements…” 
Section 117-900 sets forth certain general requirements 
applicable all design districts, and it provides that 
when a site plan is in substantial compliance with the 
regulations that the commission may approve the plan 
“with such minor variations from the strict application 
of the provisions of these regulations as will provide for 
the most appropriate use of land and as will protect the 
public health and safety and preserve property values and 
as will provide for the most orderly development of land.” 
The Appellate Court reversed in part the judgment of the 
Superior Court after concluding that these regulations 
improperly gave the commission more authority than 
the General Statutes permitted. The court then held that 
the commission, in granting the special exception after 
varying the regulations, acted in excess of the authority 
vested in it by the General Statutes, essentially giving onto 
itself the authority to grant variances where the legislature 
specifically has vested such authority in the zoning board 
of appeals.

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Appellate Court During the Biennium 

State v. Cayo, 143 Conn. App. 194 (2013). 

The defendant was issued a ticket for the infraction of 
operating a motor vehicle with an obstructed windshield 
in violation of General Statutes § 14-99f (c). The 
ticket contained, in bold capitalized letters, the words: 
“COMPLAINT TICKET.” The defendant returned the 
ticket by mail and pleaded not guilty, and the matter was 
placed on the magistrate docket. The defendant requested 
that the infraction be dismissed, but that request was 
denied. Soon thereafter, at the request of the state, the 
magistrate entered a nolle prosequi on the infraction 
ticket. Thereafter, the defendant filed a written demand 
for a trial de novo pursuant to General Statutes § 51­
193u (d) and a written motion objecting to the nolle. The 
Superior Court clerk’s office notified the defendant that 
his demand for trial de novo was improper because no 
trial previously had been conducted by the magistrate. 
The court subsequently denied the defendant’s motion 
objecting to the entry of the nolle and to dismiss the 
infraction. The defendant appealed claiming that the 
court had violated his rights under § 54-56b by entering 
a nolle over his objection. The state countered that the 
decision to enter a nolle is a discretionary decision vested 
solely in the prosecutor and that it is not a “decision of the 
magistrate” as that phrase is used in § 51-193u (d).

 Section 54-56b provides in relevant part: “a nolle 
prosequi may not be entered as to any count in a 
complaint or information if the accused objects to the 
nolle prosequi and demands either a trial or dismissal…” 
Section 51-193u (d) provides in relevant part: “A decision 
of the magistrate… shall become a judgment of the court 
if no demand for a trial de novo is filed. Such decision 
of the magistrate shall become null and void if a timely 
demand for a trial de novo is filed…” 

On appeal, the Appellate Court held that the entry of the 
nolle by the magistrate was a “decision of the magistrate” 
within the context of § 51-193u (d) from which the 
defendant had a right to demand a trial de novo. The 
Appellate Court further held that the defendant’s rights 
pursuant to § 54-56b were violated when the magistrate 

entered a nolle over the defendant’s objection, as he was 
entitled to either a trial or to a dismissal of the infraction 
ticket. The ticket was a complaint, as it clearly stated in 
bold, capitalized letters, within the purview of § 54-56b. 
The magistrate was required to conduct a trial de novo 
or to dismiss the infraction ticket upon the defendant’s 
timely objection to the entry of the nolle by the magistrate 
and his demand for a trial or a dismissal. 

State v. Boswell, 142 Conn. App. 21 (2013). 

In 2004, the defendant pleaded guilty under the Alford 
doctrine to sexual assault in the second degree (statutory 
rape) under General Statutes (Rev. to 2001) § 53a-71 (a) 
(1), which made it a crime to engage in sexual intercourse 
with another person who is thirteen years old or older, but 
under sixteen years old, when the actor is more than two 
years older than such other person. The defendant was 
two years and five months older than the other person. 
In 2007, the legislature amended the statute, changing 
the difference in age from two years to three years. In 
2011, the defendant filed a petition for destruction of the 
record of his 2004 statutory rape conviction pursuant to 
§ 54-142d, which permits the erasure and destruction 
of all judicial records, police records and prosecution 
records when the legislature decriminalizes an offense of 
which the defendant previously was convicted. The trial 
court denied the defendant’s motion after considering 
the victim’s testimony that the defendant had brandished 
a knife at the time of the incident and that the sexual act 
was not consensual. 

The Appellate Court held that the trial court improperly 
had denied the defendant’s petition for the destruction 
of the records of his decriminalized offense. The court 
explained that the plain language of § 54-142d, read 
in context with the definition of offense in § 53a-24, 
required that, upon the defendant’s petition, the trial 
court order erasure and destruction of records related to 
 
the defendant’s conviction of the crime that later 
was decriminalized.

Keeping Courts Relevant in a Changing Society 


The past two years have transformed the way the 
Judicial Branch does business in civil matters, and 
similar changes are expected regarding family 
matters. The re-engineering of how cases are handled 
is the direct result of Chief Justice Chase T. Rogers’ 
 
commitment to keeping courts relevant in a changing 
society, so that residents have full access to justice. For 
example, significant changes to the Judicial Branch’s 
Alternative Dispute Resolution program have led to a 
more streamlined and simplified process for parties in a 
civil case. 

Another component of the re-engineering effort has been 
improving access to justice for self-represented litigants 
and particularly those who cannot afford an attorney. 
Several achievements have occurred in this area, among 
them the creation of LawyerCorps Connecticut. 

The Chief Justice first broached the idea of such a 
program two years ago as she thought of ways to engage 
the state’s business community in enhancing access to 
justice. She envisioned a program similar to Teach Across 
America for new attorneys and initiated discussions 
among business leaders. As a result, United Technologies 
Corp. and General Electric, as well as other corporations 
in Connecticut, subsequently agreed to sponsor 
LawyerCorps Connecticut. The program will provide new 
attorneys with the opportunity to receive a fellowship to 
work for a legal services organization for a defined period 
of time. The funding for these positions will come from 
the business community, and legal services providers will 
supervise the new attorneys. In turn, the new attorneys 
will provide much-needed legal assistance to individuals 
in need. 

Another component of the re-engineering 
effort has been improving access to justice 
for self-represented litigants and particularly 
those who cannot afford an attorney. 

Other achievements over the biennium include: 

 The Judicial Branch continued encouraging attorneys 

  
to donate their time to people in need of legal 
representation. For example, many attorneys attended 
a Pro Bono Summit in May 2014. This was the second 
summit sponsored by the Branch; the first occurred 
in 2011. The summits are a tremendous resource 
for attorneys, and there is also a pro bono catalog 
on the Branch’s website that provides a list of many 
organizations that do pro bono work. 

 The Judicial Branch’s Volunteer Attorney Program in 
  
the areas of family and foreclosure law has expanded. 
Attorneys volunteer two hours of their time meeting 
one-on-one at a courthouse with self-represented 
parties, regardless of income. For family matters, the 
program is in the Hartford, Waterbury and Stamford 
judicial districts; for foreclosure matters, the program 
is in the Bridgeport, Hartford, New Haven, New 
London, Stamford and Waterbury judicial districts. 
Thousands of people have been assisted through the 
program, which now has a full-time coordinator.

Videoconferencing technology can be used for 
all aspects of the court process, including trials 
and pro bono programs. 

 Pursuant to Practice Book Section 3-8(b), a Limited 
  
Appearance Pilot Program was established for all 
family matters and family support magistrate matters 
statewide. The pilot program began Jan. 1, 2014, and 
allows an attorney to represent a client for a specific 
event or proceeding. The forms for the program and an 
informational pamphlet are available on the Branch’s 
website (www.jud.ct.gov), at Court Service centers, law 
libraries and clerks’ offices. 

 The Access to Justice Commission has created four 
  
workgroups with the common goal of increasing 
meaningful access for self-represented parties: 

– The Workgroup on Modest/Moderate Means 

 
Programs is exploring and assessing implementation 
of a program that would allow attorneys to provide 
their services to those in need at a reduced hourly 
rate. 
 

– The Workgroup on Libraries and Access to Justice 
 
is charged with developing a sustainable, long­
term collaborative relationship with Connecticut’s

Administrative Services
 

The Administrative Services Division provides centralized services to assist 
judges and Judicial Branch employees. Such services include: management 
and analysis of the Branch’s General Fund budget; payroll administration; 
revenue and expenditure accounting and payment of the Branch’s financial 
obligations; coordination of personnel and labor relations functions and 
employee benefits administration; capital budget development and 
oversight; facilities planning; design and repair; materials management; 
purchasing and warehousing; and internal auditing. 

Highlights of the biennium include: 

 The division developed and implemented HR Online, a user-friendly online 
  
system for job applicants. The system is an external site that allows job 
applicants to create one application that can be used to apply for multiple 
jobs. The previous system required users to re-enter data to apply for each 
job opportunity. Now, the application can be easily modified and updated 
by the applicant. In addition, HR Online replaces the outdated paper 
workflow for job postings, applicant qualification review and qualified 
applicant list distribution. Human Resources now can track all applicants 
and applications in the system and generate reports quickly and easily. 

The division developed and implemented HR Online, 
a user-friendly online system for job applicants. 

 

 The division initiated a continuous recruitment process for positions 

  
in high demand in order to more promptly fill vacancies and eliminate 
overtime. Potential candidates for juvenile detention officer trainee, judicial 
marshal trainee and office clerk positions may apply on an ongoing basis. 
Candidates remain in the applicant pool for one year and may renew their 
application after that time. Applicants may initiate their online application, 
save their work, and return at any time to complete their submission. 

 The division was involved with several projects regarding Judicial Branch 

  
facilities, including: 

– The replacement of the original 1970s jury seating in the Fairfield 


 
Judicial District Courthouse in the fall of 2013.
 

– The installation of railings at the Bridgeport Juvenile Detention Center as 

 
part of a $165,725 safety upgrade in June 2014. 

– Repairs to the facade, gutter and roof line at the historic 1928 Hartford 

 
Judicial District Courthouse in the spring of 2014.

Architectural rendering of the new Litchfield Judicial District Courthouse in Torrington 

– The completion by the Department of Construction 
 

  
Services of the third and final phase in the renovation 
 
of 20,810 square feet in the lower level of the 
 
Hartford Community Court facility. The renovation 
 
allowed for the relocation of Centralized Small 
 
Claims, Internal Audit, Judge Support technology 
 
staff and Administrative Services storage. 
 

– The new Litchfield Judicial District Courthouse 
 
at Torrington. The courthouse will contain eight 
courtrooms, and two hearing rooms for civil, 
criminal and juvenile matters. The Request for 
Proposal was released to the design-build teams 
in November 2013 with proposals due to the 
Department of Construction Services in March 
2014. The Office of Policy and Management 
allocated the remaining funding needed for the 
project and the design-build agreement award was 
executed in August 2014. Design development 
documents are under way and site work has 
begun. The target occupancy date for the new 
180,000-square-foot courthouse is July 2016. 

– The completion of exterior repairs at the Milford 

 
Geographical Area No. 22 Courthouse. 

– Extensive work on the exterior of the historic 1913 

 
New Haven GA Courthouse. In August 2012, 
funding was approved to award a contract to begin 
the $5.6 million Phase I of the two-phase project. 
This work includes repairs to the masonry facade, 
windows, doors, skylights, roofing, entry stairs 

and exterior stone work. The repairs to the main 
entrance columns and stairs allowed for the removal 
of scaffolding that had been present for nearly a 
decade. Phase I was determined to be substantially 
complete in October 2014. 

 
– The completion of construction to rehabilitate 
the leaky lower plaza and entry ramp at the 
Stamford-Norwalk Judicial District Courthouse. 
The project consisted of newly designed drainage 
and replacement of existing membrane beneath the 
granite pavers. This $1.3 million project began in 
April 2014. 

 Various upgrades and replacements to HVAC systems 
  
occurred during the biennium. For example, the boiler 
was replaced at the historic 1784 Judicial District 
Courthouse in New London; a new air conditioning 
unit was installed at Hartford Juvenile Court; and 
between April and October 2013, the boilers in the 
Waterbury Judicial District Courthouse were converted 
from oil to gas fired. 

 The Branch also made several compliance repairs in 

  
accordance with the Americans With Disabilities Act. 
Upgrades and cylinder replacements were completed 
to the handicapped elevators in the Hartford Judicial 
District and New London GA courthouses, additional 
grab bars were added to accessible bathrooms at 
the New Haven Judicial District courthouse and 
appropriate signage was added to the New Haven and 
Danbury Judicial District courthouses.

The Court Support Services Division (CSSD) oversees pretrial services, 
family services and probation supervision of adults and juveniles as well as 
juvenile detention services. CSSD also prepares presentence investigation 
reports, which judges may order for use when sentencing defendants. In 
addition, CSSD administers a network of statewide contracted community 
providers that deliver services to court-ordered clients. 

Highlights of the biennium include: 

 In response to the Judicial Branch’s internal research that shows a 

  
significantly higher recidivism rate for males ages 18-24 years old under 
probation supervision, CSSD’s Adult Probation Unit established a pilot 
program to address the unique concerns and issues this population 
presents. The program – called Utilizing New Initiatives with Today’s Youth 
(UNITY) – is a specialized approach to supervising young men, by officers 
who have received age-specific training through CSSD’s Youth Institute. 
Probation staff and the Branch’s contracted network have collaborated 
to establish a team approach to providing supervision, intervention and 
treatment services that are age appropriate for this target population. 
UNITY is being piloted in five sites – Bridgeport, Hartford, Manchester, 
New Haven and Stamford. 

 CSSD’s Bail Services Unit continued its efforts to help manage and reduce 
  
the pretrial population. In addition, a significant change to the Jail Re­
interview Program in 2013 has enabled bail staff to re-interview more 
than 95 percent of those defendants held on bond within five business 
days of admission, as opposed to 62 percent of those detained before the 
implementation of this new management strategy. The continued success 
of the Jail Re-interview Program is a credit to the strong collaboration 
between the Judicial Branch and the Department of Correction over the 
past 15 years. 

CSSD’s Bail Services Unit continued its efforts 

 
to help manage and reduce the pretrial population.

In 2014, CSSD became the first statewide 
pretrial system in the country to become 
accredited by the National Association 
 
of Pretrial Services Agencies. 

 In 2014, CSSD became the first statewide pretrial 
  
system in the country to become accredited by the 
National Association of Pretrial Services Agencies, 
which is the national professional association in the 
criminal justice field for the areas of pretrial release 
and diversion. 

 CSSD’s Family Services Unit collaborated with two 
  
experts to expand and further refine the assessment 
of risk in the area of life threatening intimate partner 
violence. As a result, Family Services has partnered 
with family advocates from the Coalition Against 
Domestic Violence in administering the Supplemental 
Risk Indicators at the time of arraignment to both 
the defendant and victim. This information has been 
incorporated into the Family Services Arraignment 
Assessment Report and recommendations, alerting the 
court to cases with the potential of escalating violence. 

 In 2013, the Legislature enacted legislation that 

  
mandated an evaluation to assess the effectiveness of 
the Judicial Branch’s domestic violence programs and 
to also conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine 
if program changes were necessary. The study 
determined three key findings: first, each program 
had completion rates similar to or higher than other 
domestic violence programs nationwide; second, 
program participants and especially those who 
completed the program were significantly less likely to 
be arrested after program discharge than offenders in 
the comparison group; and third, that the programs are 
effective at reducing recidivism.

 In 2013, CSSD partnered with the state Department of 
  
Children and Families to address the needs of children 
ages 12 and under who were referred to court for either 
delinquency or as a Family with Service Needs case. 
This collaboration resulted in the implementation of a 
validated risk assessment designed to identify risk in 
these children. Another result has been the diversion 
of children from juvenile court, while at the same 
time addressing the child and family’s needs and risk 
of recidivism.

The American Probation and Parole 
Association in 2013 reaccredited the Juvenile 
Probation Unit, after the unit achieved a 
score of 100 percent on all 169 standards. 

 In 2014, CSSD was one of five jurisdictions selected 
  
by The National Youth Screening & Assessment 
Partners to pilot and help validate a first-of-its­
kind domestic violence risk tool developed for the 
juvenile population. The tool will be used to identify 
adolescents at risk to recidivate in situations of violence 
toward parents. Juvenile probation offices in Hartford 
and New Britain identified two probation officers in 
each location to receive training regarding adolescent 
violence toward parents and to pilot the screening tool. 

 The American Probation and Parole Association in 
  
2013 reaccredited the Juvenile Probation Unit, after 
the unit achieved a score of 100 percent on all 169 
standards. In addition, the National Commission on 
Correctional Health Care reaccredited the two juvenile 
detention centers CSSD operates. This was the fourth 
time the NCCHC has accredited the centers. 

 There has been a significant decrease in the referral 

  
of cases to juvenile court. This is the result of multiple 
initiatives over the past several years, including the 
School-Based Diversion Initiative in conjunction 
with the Department of Education and DCF; the new 
Juvenile Probation Returned Referrals Intake Policy; 
collaboration with the Connecticut Juvenile Justice 
Alliance; and the expansion of juvenile review boards 
through Connecticut youth service bureaus. As an 
example, school-based arrests typically involve minor 
school policy violations, fighting or disturbing the 
 
peace. School-based arrests constituted 19 percent 
of court referrals during the 2011-2012 school year. 
The percentage dropped to 14 percent for the 2012­
2013 school year and to 10 percent for the 2013-2014 
school year.

 CSSD has worked in collaboration with DCF and the 
  
state Department of Education to implement Public 
 
Act 13-234, sections 123 and 124, Improving School 
Outcomes for Children and Young People in the Care 
of the State, also known as “Raise the Grade.” This 
effort to improve academic achievement involves the 
inclusion of education measures and activities in the 
juvenile probation case plan, as well as additional 
education coordinators to access and review records to 
advise probation on strategies for school improvement. 
The Judicial Branch also submitted to the Legislature 
 
the Raise the Grade Facilities and Programs Plan to 
work in conjunction with the education providers 
in the detention centers and residential programs. 
The plan is intended to improve the coordination of 
services and support; strengthen the programs and 
professional development of teachers in the facilities; 
and to support the successful transition of juveniles 
back to their home school districts.

External Affairs
 

The External Affairs Division furnishes and facilitates the exchange of 
information about the Judicial Branch to the Legislative and Executive 
branches, the public, community organizations, schools and the news 
media. The division also manages the Intern, Job Shadow and Court Aide 
programs and oversees the design of Judicial Branch publications. 

Highlights of the biennium include: 

 Representatives of the External Affairs Division continued to play an active 
  
role in ensuring that the Judicial Branch’s voice is heard at the State Capitol. 
Over the past two years, the Legislature passed a biennial budget that 
included a 5.3 percent salary increase for judicial officers, effective July 1, 
2013, and July 1, 2014. In addition, the division reviewed thousands of bills, 
many of which affected the Judicial Branch, and delivered or submitted 
testimony on scores more. Of note, the Judicial Branch’s An Act Concerning 
Court Operations – which contains numerous provisions intended to 
improve the Branch’s efficiency and effectiveness – passed in each year of 
the biennium. Two other Judicial Branch bills, An Act Concerning Court 
Support Services and An Act Concerning Adoption of the Connecticut Code of 
Evidence by the Supreme Court, passed in the second year of the biennium. 

 

Representatives of the External Affairs Division 
continued to play an active role in ensuring that the 
Judicial Branch’s voice is heard at the State Capitol. 

 

 

 During the 2013 legislative session, the division assisted with the 

  
reappointments of 22 judges and judge trial referees; in 2014, it assisted 
with the reappointments of 34 judges and judge trial referees. 

 In calendar year 2012, the division handled 882 media requests to have 
  
a camera or audio equipment at a court proceeding. Of those numbers, 
judges approved 784 (89 percent). In 2013, the division handled 694 media 
requests to have a camera or audio equipment at a court proceeding, with 
judges approving 598 (86 percent). For the first six months of 2014, the 
media submitted 343 requests to have a camera or audio equipment at a 
court proceeding, and judges approved 306 (89 percent). In each year of the 
biennium and the first six months of 2014, this represents an approval rate 
of 88 percent. The overwhelming majority of denials was because requests 
did not meet the rules outlined in the Connecticut Practice Book. 

 Over the past two fiscal years, the External Affairs Division addressed 
  
more than 4,600 requests from the media, including camera requests. 
 
The division also served as staff liaison to the Branch’s Journalism School 
for Judges in 2013 and its Law School for Journalists in 2014. At the 2014 
program, the Branch worked with the Department of Correction to

 Forty-two justices and judges visited schools in 2013 as 
  
part of Read Across America, a national celebration of 
reading held annually on March 2, Dr. Seuss’ birthday. 
In 2014, a total of 36 justices and judges read to more 
than 4,000 students at 38 different schools throughout 
the state. Read Across America is very popular among 
students, teachers and the justices and judges. 

 

In 2013, External Affairs established a 

YouTube page for the Judicial Branch. 


 The Intern Program administered by the division 
  
continued to play an important role in outreach to 
college students interested in a law-related career. 
During 2013, 330 students successfully completed 
their internships, and during the first six months of 
2014, 206 successfully completed their internships. 
Collectively, these students provided 81,205 hours 
to the Judicial Branch. It should also be noted that 
the Connecticut Judicial Branch offers one of the 
only experiential internship programs for both 
undergraduate and graduate students. 

 Throughout the biennium, External Affairs oversaw 

  
the design of 176 publications, including the 2010-2012 
Biennial Report, the 2012 and 2013 Judicial Branch 
directories, the Application for Clerkship brochure, 
the Diversity Day Save the Date card, and the Judicial 
Branch Law Library poster.

organize a visit to the York Correctional Institution, so 
that journalists could see what happens after someone 
is sentenced to prison. 

 In 2013, External Affairs established a YouTube page 
  
for the Judicial Branch. The page, which the division 
manages, makes available several videos covering 
a range of topics. In addition, the Twitter account 
managed by the division continues to grow, with more 
than 2,000 followers. 

   

   

 In 2013, 61 justices, judges and family support 
  
 
 
magistrates participated in the Judicial Branch’s 
 
Speakers Bureau, speaking at 92 events and to more 
 
than 5,000 people. During the first six months of 2014, 
34 judges, justices and magistrates spoke at 42 events to 
about 2,000 people. The Speakers Bureau is the Branch’s 
 
primary outreach effort to civic organizations, senior 
groups and other community groups. Additionally, 
External Affairs provided 116 tours of the Supreme 
 
Court courtroom to 4,655 people in 2013 and 64 tours 
 
to 2,633 people during the first six months of 2014.

The Information Technology Division is dedicated to providing state-of­
the-art data processing and publication services to the Judicial Branch 
and its customers in the legal community, outside agencies and the 
public. The division accomplishes this commitment through the design, 
development and maintenance of a sophisticated, secure and reliable 
network, computing and printing infrastructure. This infrastructure 
provides for the transmission, storage, retrieval, display and publication of 
data and information processed most often through automated systems 
developed in-house and deployed to support the Branch’s operating and 
administrative divisions. 

Highlights of the biennium include: 

 The Legislature in March 2013 unanimously passed legislation that 
  
provided coverage for all workers suffering mental or emotional 
impairment from the Sandy Hook School shooting in December 2012. 
The legislation took effect on April 1, 2013, giving the division less than 
a month to provide an automated solution to support the processing of 
claims by the Branch’s Office of Victim Services. Division staff worked 
closely and effectively with staff and management at OVS to plan, build and 
implement, on time, a new application for processing and paying claims. 

 E-filing 5.0 expanded access of e-filing to the public and allows self-

  
represented parties to file new cases, review documents on existing cases 
to which they are a party and file documents on those cases. As of July 
2014, there had been 5.2 million documents filed electronically since 
e-filing’s inception in 2004 and 38,757 attorneys/firms who have enrolled 
for e-services through the Judicial Branch website. Since civil e-filing access 
for self-represented parties was launched in May 2013, 587 self-represented 
parties have been approved to e-file on existing cases and have filed 2,263 
documents. In addition, the Small Claims e-filing system was expanded to 
allow attorneys and registered self-represented parties to file small claims 
executions. Since its launch in July 2013, there have been 42,568 execution 
documents filed through small claims.

 To improve communication with the public, judges 

  
and attorneys and to cut costs and reduce the workload 
of the courts, a new Civil/Family e-filing website 
was created. The public or anyone logged into the 
e-filing system can navigate to a case and sign up to 
receive email notification when there is activity on 
a civil or family case. Notifications are emailed each 
night to subscribers summarizing the day’s activity 
for each case. Additionally, write-ins that are added 
to the calendar after calendars are published are now 
included in the list of Scheduled Events on the Civil/ 
Family Case Lookup/Case Detail page available to the 
public and attorneys. 

 The Branch’s digital audio recording technology, For 
 

  
the Record (FTR), continues to help fulfill the mission 
of the Judicial Branch by providing accurate and timely 
records of daily court procedures. The State Bond 
Commission approved $1.48 million in bond funding 
for FTR in 2012 and several initiatives were completed 
including the rollout of FTR in all courtrooms 
statewide, the design and building of a dedicated 
FTR training room and the deployment of 50 rolling 
emergency rescue carts, at least one per courthouse 
statewide, to ensure business continuity in the event 
of equipment failure. A docket program that enables 
dockets to be associated with FTR recordings also 
was developed.

To improve communication with the public, 
judges and attorneys and to cut costs and 
reduce the workload of the courts, a new 
Civil/Family e-filing website was created. 

 The use of videoconferencing in civil, family 

  
and juvenile matters continues to grow rapidly 
and now virtually every Judicial Branch facility 
has videoconferencing capabilities. Use of 
videoconferencing allows greater access to the 
courts as well as greater efficiency in court 
proceedings. During the biennium, videoconferencing 
was used 140 times in geographical area courts, 
2,753 times in judicial district courts and 173 times 
in juvenile courts. Videoconferencing is also used by 
Support Enforcement Services for hearings and the 
Court Support Services Division for interviews and 
proceedings with inmates. 

 

 To further the mission and goals of the Public Trust 

  
and Service Commission, the division has worked with 
a number of committees to ensure that the Branch’s 
website, applications and facilities comply with the 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). These efforts 
include developing testing procedures to check for 
ADA compliance for new public applications and 
developing an online signage application that allows 
Judicial Branch personnel the ability to order or print 
approved signage for all Branch facilities.

 The Windows 7 Refresh project upgraded all of the 
  
Branch’s PCs and laptops to the Microsoft Windows 
7 operating system before Microsoft ended support 
of its Windows XP operating system. The upgrade 
was necessary to ensure that the Judicial Branch’s 
computers were not subject to security threats 
and viruses. 

 

Biennial Report 2012-2014   |   35 

 

 As traffic on the network increases, the division 

  
has implemented several initiatives, including the 
expansion of wireless technology. A pilot was launched 
in 2013 to investigate the potential use of wireless 
networking, and initial implementations of wireless 
capabilities include wireless connectivity at the Branch’s 
two juvenile detention centers and at law libraries in 
Hartford and Middletown. Future deployments are 
pending but planned for all law libraries. 

 The volume of tickets processed through the fully 
  
operational Centralized Infractions Bureau E-Pay 
website continues to grow – from July 2013 to July 
 
2014, there were 58,350 tickets processed, 40,968 
were paid online and 17,382 had a not guilty plea 
processed online. 

   

As traffic on the network increases, 
the division has implemented several 
initiatives, including the expansion 
of wireless technology. 

 The division develops and supports the Branch’s 

  
website (www.jud.ct.gov) and provides interactive 
web applications such as Attorney/Firm Enrollment, 
Self-Represented Party Enrollment, Civil e-filing for 
Attorneys and Self-Represented Parties, Attorney 
Registration, Attorney Advertising, Short Calendar 
Markings, Client Security Fund Payments, Small 
Claims e-filing for Attorneys, Firms and Self-
Represented Parties, Juror Attendance Confirmations, 
Juror Postponements, Child Protection Docket Access 
and Juvenile Docket Access for Juvenile Matters. The 
Branch introduced its new award-winning website 
redesign in early 2013 and, since that time, the 
division has implemented various changes to increase 
adaptability, accessibility and user functionality.

The Superior Court Operations Division assists the Judicial Branch in the 
administration of justice by providing quality services and information to 
the court, its users and the community in an effective, professional and 
courteous manner. The division, the largest in the Judicial Branch, also 
provides judges and support staff with the resources needed to process 
cases in a timely and efficient manner. In addition, the division coordinates 
the Judicial Branch’s implementation of the Judicial Branch’s strategic plan. 

Highlights of the biennium include: 

 The use of electronic signatures on documents submitted to court by law 

  
enforcement agencies was authorized and implemented within the Judicial 
Branch’s criminal division. The chief court administrator developed 
procedures and technical standards to enable law enforcement agencies to 
electronically prepare and sign documents that are submitted to court. 

The use of electronic signatures on documents submitted 
to court by law enforcement agencies was authorized and 
implemented within the Judicial Branch’s criminal division. 

 In 2014, the Judicial Branch implemented new procedures to make all 
  
bench warrants (a warrant issued for violation of probation, failure to 
appear in court or failure to pay or plead and any judgment mittimus issued 
for willful nonpayment of a fine) available for instant national background 
checks on people applying to purchase firearms and explosives. 

 In 2013, the Judicial Branch implemented procedures to electronically 

  
notify mental health professionals and firearms regulatory authorities of a 
person found to possess a firearm and who is deemed to pose an imminent 
risk of physical injury under Section 29-38c of the General Statutes. All 
records known to the Judicial Branch have now been reviewed and indexed. 

 CAPS (Criminal Adjudication Processing and Scheduling System) is a 

  
new computer application that is the first phase of a larger project that will 
ultimately replace the 30-plus-year-old criminal/motor vehicle system used 
by clerks’ offices in the criminal courts. It was piloted in the Rockville and 
Manchester Geographical Area courts, and is being rolled out to additional 
locations. It enables the offices to capture more information than the old 
system. The application enables the offices to capture more information 
than did the old system, including information that is transmitted to 
regulatory agencies for use in firearms eligibility investigations. Court 
Operations is working on the project in conjunction with the Information 
Technology Division.

 Since October 2012, people who have been summoned 
  
for jury service may either confirm or postpone their 
service date online. Jurors also may now use their 
mobile devices to automatically link via a Quick 
Response Code to the Jury Administration webpage, 
where they can confirm or postpone their service 
online, as well as email Jury Administration. The QR 
Code is on the jury summons form. 

 Spanish language has been added to the portion of the 
  
jury summons that allows a summoned individual to 
request a disqualification due to an inability to speak 
or understand English. This inclusion makes it easier 
for Spanish-speaking people to understand what 
information is necessary for their disqualification 
request to be successfully processed. 

 In conjunction with the Centralized Infractions Bureau 

  
(CIB) and Centralized Small Claims, the division 
eliminated 52 magistrate sessions by combining the 

CIB docket with the centralized small claims docket. 
The annual savings totals $10,400. 

 All disclosable documents in civil cases with a return 
  
date on or after Jan. 1, 2014, became electronically 
accessible to the public. As of May 2013, self-represented 
 
parties were given the option to enroll and e-file in 
their civil case. 

 An “Ethics Alert” feature was created for the webpage 

  
of the Judicial Ethics Committee. The feature is 
accessible to the public and is intended to bring 
advisory opinions that are likely to have a broad impact 
on the bench to the attention of all judicial officials in a 
timely manner.

The Pillars of Service Excellence Program, 
a public service training initiative based 
on the Branch’s four core values of respect, 
fairness, professionalism and integrity, 
 
continues to excel.

 The Statewide Bar Counsel worked with the Office of 

  
the Chief Disciplinary Counsel to have various Practice 
Book rules changed so that disciplinary counsel has the 
ability to file for disciplinary action once an attorney 
is found guilty of a crime (previously it was only after 
sentencing). The rule will be particularly useful in 
cases where attorneys are found guilty of a crime in 
federal court, where sentencing may occur long after a 
guilty plea. Statewide Bar Counsel and the Office of the 
Chief Disciplinary Counsel also worked to implement 
a comprehensive revision to another section of 
the Practice Book that governs the reinstatement 
process for attorneys who are suspended, disbarred 
or who resign. The amendments create a consistent 
application and process for these attorneys to apply 
for reinstatement. They also place the burden on the 
applicant to prepare a thorough, uniform application 
before submitting it to the standing committee and 
the court. 

 

 The Bar Examining Committee adopted significant 
  
changes to its mental health and substance abuse 
questions on various applications and relevant forms. 
The changes are designed to ensure compliance 
with the Americans with Disabilities Act and will 
be effective for the February 2015 bar examination 
application. 

 The Pillars of Service Excellence Program, a public 
  
service training initiative based on the Branch’s 
four core values of respect, fairness, professionalism 
and integrity, continues to excel. More than 1,600 
employees attended Leading the Way, the introductory 
program, and more than 600 have participated in the 
core-value focused workshops of respect, integrity and 
professionalism. Curriculum design and development 
is ongoing, with additional workshops for managers, 
supervisors and employees who are not supervisors. 

 Training for employees continued throughout the 
 

  
 
biennium on how to better serve the limited-English 
 
proficiency population. Employees also received training 
 
regarding the Americans with Disabilities Act. In 
 
addition, judges and family support magistrates received 
 
training in June 2013 regarding LEP and ADA issues. 

 Support Enforcement Services piloted an early 

  
intervention program in Hartford’s Family Support 
Magistrate Court. The pilot was designed to test 
whether personal interaction by Support Enforcement 
staff with obligors at the time their court orders 
are set would help secure consistent child support 
payments. SES also reviewed court procedures used 
in modification hearings statewide and developed a 
standard presentation form for staff, ensuring uniform 
quality and consistent delivery of services. 

 Support Enforcement Services developed and 

  
published a comprehensive family violence policy 
and procedural guidance for staff on handling child 
support cases involving family violence. A full-day 
training curriculum was created, and 92 employees 
participated in the training. 

 During 2013, the Connecticut Statewide Automated 
  
Victim Information and Notification service (CT 
SAVIN) was expanded to provide automated 
notifications to registered crime victims and others 
regarding changes to an offender’s custody status 
with the Connecticut Department of Correction. In 
addition, VINEMobile, a free smartphone application, 
launched, allowing the use of smart phones and tablets 
to register for and receive CT SAVIN notifications. 

 The Branch’s Office of Victim Services in March 2013 
  
was named administrator of the Sandy Hook Workers 
Assistance Program, which financially assists certain 
individuals who suffered a mental or emotional 
impairment as a result of their response to the Sandy 
Hook School shooting. From February 2013 through 
July 2014, OVS also served as the administrator of the 
Immediate Needs Fund, established by the United Way 
of Western Connecticut and the Newtown Rotary Club 
Foundation to provide financial assistance to certain 
individuals affected by the shooting. In addition, OVS 
during 2013-2014 assisted Newtown administrators 
in applying for federal funding under the U.S. 
Department of Justice, Antiterrorism and Emergency 
Assistance Program for Crime Victim Assistance Grant 
(AEAP). A grant award of $1.5 million was awarded in 

Superior Court Operations Division 

December 2013 to reimburse several organizations for 
costs incurred as a result of the shooting. An additional 
$7.1 million in AEAP grant funds was awarded in June 
2014 to support mental health services in the Newtown 
community and to establish a recovery and resilience 
plan for the town. 

 In 2014, the Judicial Marshal Services Academy was 

  
awarded its third accreditation from the Commission 
on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, a 
national organization that recognizes professional 
excellence. 

In its effort to enhance awareness of mental 
health issues, the Judicial Marshal Services 
Academy developed the training program 
Hearing Voices That Are Distressing. 

 In its effort to enhance awareness of mental health 
  
issues, the Judicial Marshal Services Academy 
developed the training program Hearing Voices That 
Are Distressing. The simulated experience enables court 
personnel to recognize more readily that a person may 
be suffering from mental health issues and lack basic 
interactive skills to follow simple commands. More 
than 300 people took the training during the biennium.

Effective July 1, 2012, P.A. 09-7 (sections 81-89, 91) and P.A. 11-157 (sections 12, 18-19) removed the “Youth in Crisis” case type and added 17-year olds to juvenile 
court jurisdiction for “Delinquency” and “Family with Service Needs” proceedings. Accordingly, there are no longer numbers associated with “Youth in Crisis”.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
