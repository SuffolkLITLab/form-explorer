DELACRUZ-GOMEZ
(AC 44356)

Bright, C. J., and Moll and Vertefeuille, Js.

Syllabus

Convicted, after a jury trial, of the crimes of assault of public safety personnel
and interfering with an officer, the defendant appealed to this court,
claiming that the trial court had improperly admitted into evidence
certain prejudicial, uncharged misconduct evidence. Police officers
working with the Violent Fugitive Task Force of the United States Mar-
shals Service came to the defendant’s apartment to execute an arrest
warrant that contained outstanding charges against him of assault in
the first degree and criminal possession of a firearm. The officers, includ-
ing C, had their weapons drawn as they searched the apartment for the
defendant, who was found hiding in a bedroom. As C placed a handcuff
on the defendant’s wrist, the defendant lunged at him, causing C to fall
backward into a nightstand, fracturing his ribs and puncturing a lung.
During their testimony at trial, officers identified by name the charges
against the defendant in the arrest warrant and the name and purpose
of the task force as the entity that executed the arrest warrant. On
appeal, the defendant claimed, inter alia, that evidence of the names of
the charges in the warrant and the identity and purpose of the task
force were indicative to the jury of his propensity for criminal conduct
and that he was violent and dangerous and that the probative value of
that evidence was not outweighed by its prejudicial effect. Held:
1. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting as uncharged
misconduct evidence the officers’ testimony as to the names of the
charges in the arrest warrant: the names of the charges were relevant
to the jury’s determination as to whether the officers were acting in the
performance of their duties and whether the force they used during the
execution of the arrest warrant was reasonable, there was no evidence
that the uncharged misconduct, which did not include details of the
prior assault charge, was more severe than the crimes with which the
defendant was charged, the officers’ testimony was limited to the names
of the charges in the warrant and did not include any details of those
charges, and the officers mentioned the charges only in the context of
explaining why they used certain tactical gear and had their weapons
drawn; moreover, the court reduced any prejudicial impact the evidence
might have had when it instructed the jury during C’s testimony and in
its final charge that evidence of the names of the charges could be
considered only on the issue of the reasonableness of the force used
by the officers, that the evidence was not admitted to demonstrate a
criminal propensity on the part of the defendant and that details involved
in the warrant were not pertinent and should not be considered.
2. The defendant could not prevail on his claim that the trial court abused
its discretion when it permitted police officers to identify the name and
purpose of the Violent Fugitive Task Force: the officers’ brief testimony
about the name and purpose of the task force was relevant to whether
they were acting in the performance of their duties when they executed
the arrest warrant, it explained why the officers were at the defendant’s
apartment and the nature of the task force, as evidenced by its name
and its purpose to apprehend violent fugitives, and the officers’ testi-
mony helped explain why they executed the arrest warrant in the manner
that they did, including why they had their weapons drawn when they
searched the apartment; moreover, the evidence was not unduly prejudi-
cial, as the name and purpose of the task force was not likely to arouse
the emotions of the jurors any more than the officers’ testimony about
the nature of the charges contained in the arrest warrant.

Opinion

VERTEFEUILLE, J. The defendant, Raikes Y. Dela-
cruz-Gomez, appeals from the judgment of conviction,
rendered after a jury trial, of assault of public safety
personnel in violation of General Statutes § 53a-167c
(a) (1) and interfering with an officer in violation of
General Statutes § 53a-167a (a). On appeal, the defen-
dant claims that the trial court improperly admitted
into evidence (1) testimony as to the names of felony
charges contained in a prior outstanding warrant for
the defendant’s arrest as prior uncharged misconduct
evidence, and (2) testimony naming the task force that
had executed that warrant, specifically, the Violent
Fugitive Task Force.1 We affirm the judgment of the
trial court.

The jury reasonably could have found the following
facts. On November 18, 2016, officers working with the
United States Marshals Service’s Violent Fugitive Task
Force arrived at 8 Elmer Street in Waterbury to execute
arrest warrants for the defendant and his son, Hendimb-
ert Delacruz (Hendimbert). Both warrants contained
charges for violent felony offenses, and the defendant,
more specifically, had outstanding charges of assault
in the first degree and criminal possession of a firearm.
The task force had received information that the defen-
dant and Hendimbert were residing in an apartment at
that address.

The apartment was a two-story end unit, which had
front and rear entrances. After setting up a perimeter
around the area, the entry team of the task force posi-
tioned itself at the front door of the apartment. The
entry team included James Masterson, a member of the
United States Marshals Service, and Detectives Daniel
Chalker, Edward Mills, and Jeffrey Taylor of the Water-
bury Police Department. All of the officers wore tactical
vests that displayed markings of their respective agen-
cies and clearly identified them as law enforcement
personnel.

The members of the entry team knocked on the front
door of the apartment for at least five minutes, while
announcing, ‘‘police with a warrant,’’ but they received
no response. After Masterson and Mills saw the defen-
dant looking out a window on the second floor, Mills
attempted to force entry into the apartment using a
battering ram, but he was unsuccessful. They heard a
woman’s voice from inside the apartment, telling them
to ‘‘wait a minute.’’ The woman, later identified as the
defendant’s wife, opened the back door of the apart-
ment and let the officers inside.

The officers then entered the kitchen area of the
apartment. They detained the defendant’s wife and,
when they asked her who else was in the apartment,
she told them that her children were there. When the
officers showed her a photograph of the defendant, she

nodded her head to indicate that he also was there, and
she pointed upstairs. The officers did a quick search
of the first floor, then yelled for anyone who was on
the second floor to come downstairs. Several people
came downstairs, including a man and some children,
but the defendant and Hendimbert did not.

Masterson, carrying a ballistic shield,

then led
Chalker, Mills, and Taylor upstairs to the second floor
of the apartment, while Timothy McMahon, a probation
officer assisting the task force, remained on the first
floor with the individuals in the kitchen area. When
they reached the top of the stairs, Masterson stayed in
the hallway to protect the other officers with the shield
while they began to search the rooms for the defendant
and Hendimbert, as well as for any firearms or other
weapons.

After searching a bathroom, Chalker, Mills, and Tay-
lor entered a bedroom located to the left of the stairs
with their guns drawn. The room was small and ‘‘very
cluttered’’ with a king-size bed that took up three quar-
ters of the room and a nightstand next to it. A large
pile of clothing was on the floor at the foot of the
bed between the bed and a wall. The pile appeared to
contain ‘‘an extreme amount’’ of clothing, which was
approximately the same height as the bed.

Chalker holstered his weapon, got onto the bed, and
began to remove clothing from the pile to determine
whether someone was hiding underneath. After remov-
ing a couple of items of clothing, Chalker could see
part of a person’s body. Chalker yelled, ‘‘[s]how me
your hands, show me your hands,’’ but the person did
not move. After seeing the person’s eyes, Chalker recog-
nized him as the defendant. Chalker grabbed the defen-
dant’s left hand, started to pull him up onto the bed, and
placed a handcuff on his wrist in the process. Chalker
continued to provide instructions to the defendant,
informing him that he was under arrest, but the defen-
dant provided no assistance or effort in getting up and,
instead, acted as ‘‘dead weight.’’

When the defendant was pulled halfway up onto the
bed, he used his feet to push off the wall and lunge at
Chalker. The defendant’s head and shoulder hit Chalker
in his chest. As a result, Chalker fell backward off the
bed, striking the right side of his back on the nightstand.
He dropped onto the floor in severe pain and had diffi-
culty breathing.

Taylor yelled for help from the other task force mem-
bers. McMahon immediately ran upstairs and observed
that Chalker ‘‘appeared to be [in] excruciating pain . . .
cowering toward his side . . . and seemed to be gasp-
ing for air.’’ He assisted Chalker back down the stairs,
out of the apartment building, and into a police car.
Mills and Taylor holstered their weapons and finished
handcuffing the defendant, then continued searching

for Hendimbert, whom they also found hiding under-
neath the pile of clothing.2

After transporting the defendant to the police station,
Taylor brought Chalker to Saint Mary’s Hospital in
Waterbury. At the hospital, Chalker learned that he had
sustained multiple fractures of his ribs and a punctured
lung. He also suffered from shoulder pain and, as a
result of the injuries to his ribs, continued to experience
pain for several months.

The defendant subsequently was charged by way of
a substitute information with one count of assault of
public safety personnel in violation of § 53a-167c (a)
(1) and one count of interfering with an officer in viola-
tion of § 53a-167a (a). The jury found the defendant
guilty on both counts, and the trial court sentenced the
defendant to a total effective term of eight years of
incarceration followed by two years of special parole.
This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural
history will be set forth as necessary.

.

. for an abuse of discretion.

We begin by setting forth our standard of review
governing both of the defendant’s claims, which are
evidentiary in nature. ‘‘We review the trial court’s deci-
sion to admit evidence, if premised on a correct view
. We
of the law .
will make every reasonable presumption in favor of
upholding the trial court’s ruling, and only upset it for
a manifest abuse of discretion.
. In determining
whether there has been an abuse of discretion, the
ultimate issue is whether the court could reasonably
conclude as it did.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

cert. denied, 330 Conn. 911, 193 A.3d 50 (2018). We
address the defendant’s claims in turn.

.

.

I

The defendant first claims that the court improperly
admitted into evidence the testimony of several police
officers who named the felony offenses contained in the
defendant’s arrest warrant as uncharged misconduct
evidence. Specifically, the defendant contends that the
probative value of the evidence was outweighed by its
prejudicial effect. We are not persuaded.

Prior to trial, the state filed a notice of its intent to
introduce evidence of uncharged misconduct pursuant
to § 4-5 (c) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.3 Spe-
cifically, the state advised the defendant that it intended
to present evidence that ‘‘the Violent Fugitive Task
Force was in possession of an arrest warrant charging
the defendant with, among other things, assault in the
first degree and criminal possession of a firearm.’’ The
state clarified that it was ‘‘not seeking to introduce the
other charges on the warrant, nor [was] it seeking to
introduce the underlying conduct that led to the arrest
warrant being issued.’’

The defendant filed a written objection to the uncharged

misconduct evidence, arguing that such evidence would
be unduly prejudicial because it was inflammatory, con-
fusing, and would create a side issue about the facts
underlying the charges in the warrant. He also argued
that there was a high risk that the jury improperly would
consider it as propensity evidence. He acknowledged
that the jury would likely wonder why the police were at
his apartment to arrest him but argued that a sufficient
explanation could ‘‘be accomplished simply by instruct-
ing the jury [that] there was an arrest warrant for him
without addressing the charges.’’

Prior to the start of evidence, a hearing on the admis-
sibility of the prior uncharged misconduct evidence was
held before the court, Klatt, J. The prosecutor argued
that he was offering the uncharged misconduct evi-
dence to prove an element of both of the crimes
charged—specifically, that the officers were acting in
the performance of their duties at the time that the
assault and interference occurred—and to corroborate
crucial prosecution testimony. The prosecutor con-
tended that he sought to introduce the evidence to
provide an explanation for the amount of force that the
officers used, and to explain ‘‘their conduct for the
entry, for the ballistic shield, and for holding the defen-
dant at gunpoint.’’ Defense counsel argued that the evi-
dence was ‘‘highly prejudicial’’ and that it was likely
that the jury would improperly consider it as propensity
evidence because the charges in the defendant’s arrest
warrant and the charges then at issue in the present case
both involved assault. He maintained that the evidence
should be limited to the fact that the officers were
executing a warrant and that the court should instruct
the jurors that ‘‘they’re not to be concerned as to what
the charges were . . . .’’

The court then made the following oral ruling: ‘‘Well,
it appears from both parties that you’re all in agreement
that the fact that the officers were there to serve a
warrant is something that’s admissible. I’m going to
allow the state’s motion regarding naming the two
charges. From the argument that I heard from both
parties, it would appear to be relevant evidence on the
charge of interference. It goes to the reasonable belief
of the officers, and it does . . . help establish the pros-
ecution testimony, as well as complete the story of why
they’re there.

‘‘I do find, listening again to the argument of both
parties, that it would appear to be more probative than
prejudicial, and that any prejudice could be eliminated
through an appropriate jury charge. So, I’ll allow the
state’s offer as it exists.’’

Subsequently, during trial, Masterson and Chalker
testified that the defendant’s arrest warrant contained
charges of assault in the first degree and criminal pos-
session of a firearm, and that such charges fell within
the purview of the task force.

The officers also provided testimony explaining how
the nature of these charges influenced the manner in
which they executed the arrest warrants.4 For example,
they testified that Masterson was carrying a ballistic
shield due to the defendant’s firearm charge. Masterson
explained that there were a large number of officers
involved in securing and searching the apartment
because ‘‘this is someone .
. [who] is wanted for a
violent felony charge.’’ Mills testified that he had a bat-
tering ram with him at the front door of the apartment
because, ‘‘for a felony warrant of this type, it’s normal
for that procedure.’’ Mills and Taylor further explained
that they began to search the bedroom with their guns
drawn due to the nature of the case and, more specifi-
cally, the defendant’s firearm charge.

.

During defense counsel’s cross-examination of
Chalker,5 the court provided the following limiting
instruction to the jury:
ladies and gentlemen,
‘‘So,
there’s certain rulings that the court made, and there
are reasons for those rulings and they’re based on the
principles that I’ve already instructed you on many
times. The officers were there to serve a warrant, that’s
their testimony, that the charges were for assault one
and criminal possession of a firearm, which are classi-
fied as violent felon[ies]. That is not to say that the
defendant committed these offenses; he enjoys the
same presumption of innocence as to any warrant that’s
being served. But the officers’ testimony reflect[s] their
preparation for the service of a violent . . . of a war-
rant that charges a violent felony. That’s it, nothing
more. The details involved in that warrant are not perti-
nent to this, not relevant, and should not be considered
by you.’’

Defense counsel continued to question the officers
about whether they had used their firearms to hit or
strike the defendant.6 Ultimately, however, defense
counsel conceded during his closing argument that the
officers had been acting in the performance of their
duties when executing the arrest warrant.

.

.

In its final instructions to the jury, the trial court
. offered evidence
charged that ‘‘[t]he state has .
.
. that there was a warrant for the defendant for
the charge of assault in the first degree and criminal
possession of a firearm as an act of misconduct of the
defendant. This evidence is not being admitted to prove
the bad character, propensity or criminal tendencies of
the defendant. Such evidence is being admitted solely
to show or establish an element of the .
. crimes
charged . . . .

.

‘‘You may not consider such evidence as establishing
a predisposition on the part of the defendant to commit
any of the crimes charged or to demonstrate a criminal
propensity. You may consider such evidence if you
believe it and further find that it logically, rationally

and conclusively supports the issue for which it is being
offered by the state, but only as it may bear on the
issue of reasonableness of force as used by the peace
officers.

‘‘On the other hand, if you do not believe such evi-
dence, or even if you do, if you find that it does not
logically, rationally and conclusively support the issue
for which it is being offered by the state, namely, reason-
ableness of force used, then you may not consider that
testimony for any other purpose.

‘‘You may not consider evidence of other misconduct
of the defendant for any purpose other than the one
I’ve just told you because it may predispose your mind
uncritically to believe that the defendant may be guilty
of the offense here merely because of the alleged other
misconduct. For this reason, you may consider this
evidence only on the issue of reasonableness of force
used and for no other purpose.’’ (Emphasis added.)

On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court
erred by admitting testimony about the names of the
charges contained in the defendant’s arrest warrant
because the probative value of the evidence was out-
weighed by its prejudicial effect. The state responds
that the court properly admitted the uncharged miscon-
duct evidence because of the significant probative value
of the evidence in proving an element of the charged
offenses, the limited nature of the evidence, and the
court’s cautionary instructions to the jury. We agree
with the state and conclude that, under the circum-
stances of the present case, the trial court did not abuse
its discretion in admitting the testimony as to the names
of the felony offenses with which the defendant was
charged.

‘‘Although [e]vidence of a defendant’s uncharged mis-
conduct is inadmissible to prove that the defendant
committed the charged crime or to show the predisposi-
tion of the defendant to commit the charged crime,
such evidence is admissible if it is offered to prove
intent, identity, malice, motive, a system of criminal
activity or the elements of a crime. . . . To determine
whether evidence of prior uncharged misconduct is
admissible for a proper purpose, we have adopted a
two-pronged test: First, the evidence must be relevant
and material to at least one of the circumstances encom-
passed by the exceptions. Second, the probative value
of such evidence must outweigh the prejudicial effect
of the other crime evidence.’’ (Citation omitted; internal
quotation marks omitted.) State v. Patrick M., 344 Conn.
565, 597, 280 A.3d 461 (2022); see Conn. Code Evid. § 4-
5 (a) and (c) (‘‘[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs or
acts of a person is inadmissible to prove the bad charac-
ter, propensity, or criminal tendencies of that person’’
but is admissible for other purposes, ‘‘such as to prove
intent,
identity, malice, motive, common plan or
scheme, absence of mistake or accident, knowledge, a

system of criminal activity, or an element of the crime,
or to corroborate crucial prosecution testimony’’).

.

.

‘‘The admission of evidence of prior uncharged mis-
conduct is a decision properly within the discretion of
the trial court.
. [E]very reasonable presumption
should be given in favor of the trial court’s ruling. . . .
[T]he trial court’s decision will be reversed only [when]
abuse of discretion is manifest or [when] an injustice
appears to have been done.’’ (Internal quotation marks
omitted.) State v. Patrick M., supra, 344 Conn. 598.

We first consider the probative value of the prior
uncharged misconduct evidence. In the present case,
the state bore the burden of demonstrating that the
officers were ‘‘acting in the performance of [their]
duties’’ to prove the elements of the charged offenses
of assault of public safety personnel and interference
with an officer. General Statutes § 53a-167c (a); see also
General Statutes § 53a-167a (a). The state was required
to prove, in connection with this element, that the offi-
cers had used a reasonable amount of force during the
incident underlying the defendant’s current charges.
See State v. Davis, 261 Conn. 553, 572, 804 A.2d 781
(2002) (jury must determine whether use of physical
force by officers was justified such that it was within
performance of their duties); see also State v. Outlaw,
179 Conn. App. 345, 351, 179 A.3d 219 (‘‘an officer’s
exercise of reasonable force is inherent in the perfor-
mance of duties, and therefore unreasonable and unnec-
essary force by a police officer would place the actions
outside the performance of that officer’s duties’’ (inter-
nal quotation marks omitted)), cert. denied, 328 Conn.
910, 178 A.3d 1042 (2018).

The uncharged misconduct evidence at issue here
was relevant to the jury’s determination of whether the
officers had exercised a reasonable amount of force
while executing the defendant’s arrest warrant. Specifi-
cally, the testimony regarding the nature of the criminal
charges the defendant faced as set forth in the arrest
warrant provided an explanation for the manner in
which the officers conducted themselves while they
were at the apartment, such as their reason for using
certain tactical gear, like the battering ram and ballistic
shield, and why they had their weapons drawn.7 Accord-
ingly, the court properly determined that the charges
in the defendant’s arrest warrant were relevant for the
purpose of establishing that the officers were acting in
the performance of their duties at the time of the inci-
dent underlying his conviction.8

We next turn to the issue of whether the probative
value of the prior misconduct evidence outweighed its
prejudicial effect. See State v. Daniel M., 210 Conn.
App. 819, 832, 271 A.3d 719, cert. denied, 343 Conn. 906,
273 A.3d 234 (2022). ‘‘Section 4-3 of the Connecticut
Code of Evidence .
. provides that [r]elevant evi-
dence may be excluded if its probative value is out-

.

weighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or surprise,
confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by
considerations of undue delay, waste of time or need-
less presentation of cumulative evidence. [T]he deter-
mination of whether the prejudicial impact of evidence
outweighs it probative value is left to the sound discre-
tion of the trial court judge and is subject to reversal
only where an abuse of discretion is manifest or injus-
tice appears to have been done.
. [Our Supreme
Court] has previously enumerated situations in which
the potential prejudicial effect of relevant evidence
would counsel
its exclusion. Evidence should be
excluded as unduly prejudicial: (1) where it may unnec-
essarily arouse the jury’s emotions, hostility or sympa-
thy; (2) where it may create distracting side issues; (3)
where the evidence and counterproof will consume an
inordinate amount of time; and (4) where one party is
unfairly surprised and unprepared to meet it.’’ (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) Id.

The defendant argues that the uncharged misconduct
evidence ‘‘was likely to unduly arouse the emotions and
hostilities of the jur[ors], especially given the severity
of the charges and the similarity between the assault
charge in the warrant and the assault of Detective
Chalker.’’ The defendant also contends that the evi-
dence ‘‘created a side issue that risked the jur[ors’]
engaging in speculation about the underlying facts of the
two charges.’’ The defendant’s arguments are unavailing.

At the outset, we acknowledge that ‘‘evidence of dis-
similar acts is less likely to be prejudicial than evidence
of similar or identical acts’’; (internal quotation marks
omitted) State v. Vega, 259 Conn. 374, 398, 788 A.2d
1221, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 836, 123 S. Ct. 152, 154 L.
Ed. 2d 56 (2002); and, in the present case, the uncharged
misconduct and the charged crimes were similar insofar
as they both involved assaults.

Nevertheless, our review of the record indicates that
the uncharged misconduct evidence did not include
any details of the prior assault charge that would have
increased the risk of undue prejudice to the defendant.
See, e.g., State v. Morlo M., 206 Conn. App. 660, 693–94,
261 A.3d 68 (uncharged misconduct, although similar
to crimes of which defendant was convicted, was not
unduly prejudicial given lack of details about incidents
of prior misconduct), cert. denied, 339 Conn. 910, 261
A.3d 745 (2021). There was no evidence to indicate that
the uncharged misconduct was more severe than the
crimes of which the defendant was charged; see State
v. Patterson, 344 Conn. 281, 298, 278 A.3d 1044 (2022)
(‘‘[t]he prejudicial impact of uncharged misconduct evi-
dence is assessed in light of its relative viciousness in
comparison with the charged conduct’’ (internal quota-
tion marks omitted)); or that the underlying facts of
the assaults contained similarities or common charac-
teristics. Cf. State v. Raynor, 337 Conn. 527, 563–66,

254 A.3d 874 (2020); see id., 564 (uncharged misconduct
evidence was unduly prejudicial when it ‘‘was not lim-
ited only to the fact that there was a shooting, with no
other details regarding the surrounding events,’’ and
details demonstrated, inter alia, common characteris-
tics of incidents).

Instead, the uncharged misconduct evidence in the
present case was limited to testimony regarding the
names of the charges in the warrant, thus minimizing
the risk of prejudice to the defendant. See State v.
Griggs, 288 Conn. 116, 140–42, 951 A.2d 531 (2008)
(trial court minimized risk of prejudice to defendant by
excluding details surrounding his prior convictions and
permitting state to introduce only limited evidence
about number and nature of convictions); State v. Wil-
son, 209 Conn. App. 779, 824, 267 A.3d 958 (2022)
(uncharged misconduct evidence did not create unduly
distracting side issue due to restricted nature of testi-
mony); see also State v. Patterson, supra, 344 Conn.
296 (finding significant ‘‘the degree to which the trial
court exercised its discretion to limit the extent of the
evidence of the prior shootings it admitted’’).

Moreover, in addition to limiting the scope of their
testimony about the prior uncharged misconduct, the
officers mentioned the defendant’s charges only in the
context of explaining why they used certain tactical
gear and had their weapons drawn during their execu-
tion of the arrest warrant, which highlighted the limited
purpose for which the evidence was admitted.9

Finally, the fact that the court provided a limiting
instruction during Chalker’s testimony, as well as in its
final charge to the jury, reduced any prejudicial impact
the evidence might have had. See State v. Daniel M.,
supra, 210 Conn. App. 834–35 (limiting instruction dur-
ing testimony and in final charge reduced any prejudi-
cial impact that uncharged misconduct evidence might
have had); see also State v. Pereira, 113 Conn. App.
705, 715, 967 A.2d 121 (‘‘[p]roper limiting instructions
often mitigate the prejudicial impact of evidence of
prior misconduct’’ (internal quotation marks omitted)),
cert. denied, 292 Conn. 909, 973 A.2d 106 (2009). The
court repeatedly instructed the jurors that they could
consider such evidence only on the issue of reasonable-
ness of force used by the officers and that the evidence
was not admitted to demonstrate a criminal propensity
on the part of the defendant. Moreover, although the
defendant argues that the jurors would have ‘‘engag[ed]
in speculation about the underlying facts of the two
charges’’ and ‘‘wonder[ed] what gave rise to’’ the
charges, the court specifically told the jurors that ‘‘[t]he
details involved in that warrant are not pertinent . . .
and should not be considered by you.’’ We presume
that the jury followed these instructions. See, e.g., State
v. Wilson, supra, 209 Conn. App. 827.

Accordingly, considering the manner in which the

testimony was limited and the cautionary instructions
provided to the jury, we conclude that the court did
not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of the
names of felony charges contained in the defendant’s
arrest warrant.

II

The defendant also claims that the court abused its
discretion by admitting evidence that the Violent Fugi-
tive Task Force was the entity that executed the warrant
for his arrest. Specifically, he argues that testimony
concerning the name and purpose of the task force was
unfairly prejudicial. We are not persuaded.

Prior to the start of evidence, immediately after the
court overruled the defendant’s objection regarding the
charges set forth in his arrest warrant, defense counsel
orally moved to exclude evidence ‘‘that these police
officers and this federal marshal were part of this Vio-
lent [Fugitive] Task Force . . . this special task force
for violent offenders,’’ on the ground that such evidence
would be highly prejudicial. Defense counsel argued
that it would be sufficient for the officers to testify that
they were at the defendant’s apartment to execute an
arrest warrant. The prosecutor objected to the defen-
dant’s motion because the name of the task force
explained the reason why the officers were at the defen-
dant’s apartment and the manner in which they exe-
cuted the warrant.

The court denied the defendant’s motion, explaining
that ‘‘[i]t’s an acronym for .
. you can explore it on
cross-examination regarding any prejudice you think
might exist because of the name of the unit. It’s simply
. the court feel[s] that
.
identifying themselves and .
that’s relevant and probative.’’

.

During trial, the officers testified that they were
assigned to the Violent Fugitive Task Force at the time
they executed the arrest warrants for the defendant
and Hendimbert.10 The officers also provided testimony
about the purpose of the task force and its role in
apprehending the defendant. For example, Masterson
testified that the ‘‘Fugitive Task Force’’ works with state
and local agencies ‘‘to apprehend individuals wanted
on violent felonies .
.’’ Chalker similarly testified
that the ‘‘Violent Fugitive Task Force’’ works with the
United States Marshals Service in ‘‘locating violent fugi-
tives and apprehending them.’’

.

.

On appeal, the defendant argues that evidence of
the name and purpose of the task force was unfairly
prejudicial because it was likely to unduly arouse the
jurors’ emotions and hostilities and ‘‘portrayed the
defendant as a violent, dangerous individual.’’ The state
responds that the name and purpose of the task force
helped explain the manner in which the officers exe-
cuted the arrest warrant. In addition, the state contends
that ‘‘[t]he name and purpose of the task force did not

prejudice the defendant any more than the names of
the felony charges on the warrant . . . because it was
the latter that explained the task force’s connection to
the defendant.’’ We agree with the state.

As explained in part I of this opinion, to the extent
that the challenged testimony constitutes uncharged
misconduct evidence,11 it ‘‘must be relevant and mate-
rial to at least one of the circumstances encompassed by
the exceptions’’ set forth in § 4-5 (c) of the Connecticut
Code of Evidence, and ‘‘the probative value of such
evidence must outweigh the prejudicial effect of the
other crime evidence.’’ (Internal quotation marks omit-
ted.) State v. Patrick M., supra, 344 Conn. 597.

In the present case, the officers’ brief testimony about
the name and purpose of the Violent Fugitive Task
Force, like the evidence regarding the charges against
the defendant, was relevant to the issue of whether
Chalker and the other officers were acting in the perfor-
mance of their duties. See part I of this opinion. Specifi-
cally, the officers’ testimony about their association
with the Violent Fugitive Task Force, and the purpose
of that task force, provided an explanation for why
Chalker and the other officers were at the defendant’s
apartment. In addition, the nature of the task force, as
evidenced by its name and its purpose of apprehending
‘‘violent fugitives,’’ helped explain, even if only to a
slight degree, why the officers executed the arrest war-
rants in the manner that they did, including why they
had their weapons drawn when they searched the apart-
ment. See, e.g., State v. Collins, 299 Conn. 567, 587
n.19, 10 A.3d 1005 (‘‘Evidence is relevant if it has any
tendency to make the existence of any fact that is mate-
rial to the determination of the proceeding more proba-
ble or less probable than it would be without the evi-
dence.
. All that is required is that the evidence
tend to support a relevant fact even to a slight degree,
[as] long as it is not prejudicial or merely cumulative.’’
(Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omit-
ted.)), cert. denied, 565 U.S. 908, 132 S. Ct. 314, 181 L.
Ed. 2d 193 (2011).

.

.

Moreover, the evidence was not unduly prejudicial.
As the state points out, any prejudice arising from the
challenged testimony pertained to its implication that
the defendant was considered a ‘‘violent’’ fugitive who
had an outstanding warrant for ‘‘violent’’ felonies. Thus,
the testimony about the name and purpose of the task
force was not likely to arouse the emotions of the jurors
any more than the testimony about the nature of the
charges in the defendant’s arrest warrant, which, as we
have explained in part I of this opinion, also was prop-
erly before the jury. See State v. James G., 268 Conn.
382, 400, 844 A.2d 810 (2004) (evidence is less likely to
unduly arouse jurors’ emotions when similar evidence
has been presented to jury); see also State v. Gray-
Brown, 188 Conn. App. 446, 462–63, 204 A.3d 1161

(admission into evidence of electronic scale, which
tended to show that defendant was involved in sale of
drugs, was unlikely to shock jury because witness later
testified without objection that defendant used and sold
drugs), cert. denied, 331 Conn. 922, 205 A.3d 568 (2019).
Therefore, the court reasonably concluded that the evi-
dence was relevant and that its probative value out-
weighed any undue prejudice to the defendant.

The judgment is affirmed.

In this opinion the other judges concurred.
1 In his principal appellate brief, the defendant also claims that the trial
court erred in its instruction to the jury on the charge of assault of public
safety personnel in violation of § 53a-167c (a) (1). Specifically, the defendant
contends that the court improperly failed to instruct the jury to consider
whether the law enforcement officers, in arresting the defendant, used a
reasonable and necessary amount of physical force, which pertains to the
second element of § 53a-167c (a) (1), namely, whether the officers were
acting in the performance of their duties. The defendant effectively aban-
doned this claim, however, as he conceded, in his reply brief and at oral
argument before this court, that any claimed error was harmless beyond a
reasonable doubt because (1) defense counsel conceded during closing
arguments that the officer acted in accordance with his official duties, and
(2) there was no evidence that the officers used unwarranted or excessive
force. Therefore, we decline to review this claim. See State v. Gray, 342
Conn. 657, 685 n.12, 271 A.3d 101 (2022); see also Moutinho v. 500 North
Avenue, LLC, 191 Conn. App. 608, 612 n.4, 216 A.3d 667, cert. denied, 333
Conn. 928, 218 A.3d 68 (2019).

2 At trial, the defendant testified that, when he learned that the police
were at his apartment, he helped cover Hendimbert with clothing before
hiding himself.

3 Section 4-5 (c) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides: ‘‘Evidence
of other crimes, wrongs or acts of a person is admissible for purposes other
than those specified in subsection (a), such as to prove intent, identity,
malice, motive, common plan or scheme, absence of mistake or accident,
knowledge, a system of criminal activity, or an element of the crime, or to
corroborate crucial prosecution testimony.’’

4 The officers testified that they had discussed the defendant’s charges at

a briefing that took place prior to their arrival at the apartment.

5 Defense counsel began to question Chalker about whether he knew the
outcome and underlying facts of the assault and firearm charges contained
in the arrest warrant. During a discussion conducted outside the presence
of the jury, defense counsel explained that he sought to explore the reason
why Chalker had characterized the defendant as a ‘‘violent felon’’ when he
testified that Masterson was leading the officers upstairs with the ballistic
shield ‘‘[b]ecause [they were] serving a warrant on a violent felon that’s
been charged with a gun charge.’’ The court noted that defense counsel
had not objected to Chalker’s testimony characterizing the defendant as a
‘‘violent felon,’’ warned defense counsel that that line of questioning may
open the door to testimony about the underlying facts of the uncharged
misconduct, and offered to provide the limiting instruction that followed.
6 The defendant, testifying on his own behalf, claimed that an officer had
pulled him from the pile of clothing and started to hit him in the back of
the head with a gun, but he did not recognize Chalker as that officer.
Hendimbert testified that he could not see what was happening during that
time, but he could hear the defendant say, ‘‘ow,’’ and then ask the officers
why they were hitting him. The officers, however, denied hitting or striking
the defendant.

7 The defendant contends that ‘‘the state’s purported reason for introduc-
ing [the challenged] evidence to establish that the police were acting in the
performance of their duties was satisfied by simply admitting evidence that
the police were there to execute a warrant for the defendant’s arrest,’’ and,
therefore, the evidence should have been limited to that fact. We disagree.
The fact that the officers were serving an arrest warrant explains their
presence at the defendant’s apartment in the first instance, but it does not
shed light on the reasonableness of any force used during the execution
of that warrant, which the defendant disputed throughout trial until his
closing argument.

8 Notably, the defendant does not dispute that the uncharged misconduct
evidence was relevant to the jury’s determination of whether the officers
were acting in the performance of their duties and used a reasonable degree
of force in their execution of the defendant’s arrest warrant.

9 In its closing argument, the state similarly tied the misconduct evidence
to the issue of whether Chalker was acting in the performance of his duties
and whether the officers had utilized a reasonable amount of force in their
execution of the arrest warrant.

10 The evidence demonstrates that Masterson, Mills, and Taylor were mem-
bers of the Violent Fugitive Task Force, while Chalker and McMahon were
not official ‘‘deputized’’ members but, nevertheless, had been assigned to
assist the task force that day.

11 On appeal, both the defendant and the state characterize the testimony
concerning the name and purpose of the task force as uncharged miscon-
duct evidence.
