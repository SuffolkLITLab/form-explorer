Moll, Seeley and Lavine, Js.

Syllabus

The plaintiff lessor sought, inter alia, reformation of a commercial lease
between the plaintiff and the defendant lessees, J and I, based on unilat-
eral or mutual mistake. The parties negotiated the long-term lease of a
car wash facility owned by the plaintiff. Except for J’s initial offer, all
of the proposals contained rental payments on a triple net basis, wherein
the defendants would be responsible for expenses related to insurance,
maintenance, and real estate taxes in addition to base rent. After the
parties signed a letter of intent that included a triple net provision, the
plaintiff instructed its attorney to prepare a formal lease incorporating
the material terms of the letter of intent. In doing so, the plaintiff’s
attorney mistakenly omitted the triple net provision in the lease. The
parties signed the lease and, thereafter, the plaintiff sent J an invoice
that included reimbursement for real estate taxes, which J refused to
pay. After a bench trial, the court found in favor of the plaintiff on its
reformation claim, primarily based on the ground of mutual mistake
but, in the alternative, on the ground of unilateral mistake coupled with
inequitable conduct on the part of the defendants. The court subse-
quently ordered that the lease be reformed to account for the triple net
rent and that the defendants reimburse the plaintiff for the real estate
taxes in accordance therewith. On the defendants’ appeal to this
court, held:

1. This court declined to consider the merits of the defendants’ claim that
the trial court improperly granted reformation of the contract based on
the ground of unilateral mistake because there was no clear, substantial,
and convincing proof of inequitable conduct on the part of the defen-
dants, as that claim was moot: the trial court concluded that the plaintiff
satisfied both alternative grounds alleged in the complaint for reforma-
tion, mutual mistake and unilateral mistake, and, because the defendants
failed to challenge on appeal the court’s finding of mutual mistake, this
court, even if it agreed with the defendants’ claim regarding unilateral
mistake, could not provide them with any practical relief; moreover,
although the plaintiff specifically urged the court to order reformation
based on unilateral mistake in its posttrial brief, the defendants failed
to show that doing so constituted a withdrawal of the mutual mistake
ground, as the plaintiff’s complaint, which asserted a claim for reforma-
tion on both grounds, was never amended; furthermore, contrary to the
defendants’ claim, it was not logically impossible for the trial court to
find mutual mistake and, alternatively, unilateral mistake coupled with
inequitable conduct, because, even if a party testifies that a mistake
was not common to both parties, as J testified, the trial judge can find
that testimony to be lacking credibility, find testimony in support of the
contrary to be reliable, and, consequently, grant reformation on the
ground of mutual mistake, and, simultaneously, the trial court could
determine that the ground of unilateral mistake was alternatively satis-
fied because, even if the plaintiff failed to establish that J was also
mistaken, there was sufficient evidence of inequitable conduct by J.
2. The defendants could not prevail on their claim that the plaintiff’s miscon-
duct prior to the execution of the lease precluded the plaintiff from
prevailing on its claim for reformation: it is well settled that the unques-
tionable negligence of the party seeking relief, such as the failure to
read the written instrument and notice the mistake, does not bar its
claim for reformation, and, here, the trial court’s factual findings directly
refuted the underpinnings of the defendants’ argument that the plaintiff’s
behavior prior to the execution of the lease was reckless, rather than
merely negligent, and, accordingly, it was not an abuse of the trial court’s
discretion or an injustice for the court to have granted the plaintiff
equitable relief in the form of reformation.

Opinion

SEELEY, J. The present appeal arises out of an action
brought by the plaintiff lessor, Stamford Property Hold-
ings, LLC, against the defendant lessees, Dorian Jashari
(Jashari) and Ismet Jashari,1 seeking, inter alia, reforma-
tion of a commercial lease between the parties based
on unilateral or mutual mistake. The defendants appeal
from the trial court’s judgment in favor of the plaintiff.
On appeal, they claim that the court (1) improperly
granted reformation of the contract based on the ground
of unilateral mistake because, contrary to the court’s
conclusion, there was no clear, substantial, and con-
vincing proof of inequitable conduct on the part of
the defendants, and (2) erred by granting the plaintiff
equitable relief because the plaintiff’s misconduct
before the parties executed the lease barred its claim
for reformation. We conclude that the defendants’ first
claim is moot, and we are not persuaded by their second
claim. Accordingly, we dismiss as moot the portion
of the appeal related to the first claim and affirm the
judgment of the trial court.

The following facts, which either were found by the
trial court or are undisputed, and procedural history
are relevant to our review of this appeal. In May, 2019,
Jashari, a then twenty-one year old recent college gradu-
ate who was a ‘‘moderately sophisticated, well educated
entrepreneur,’’2 was in search of a business venture
when he learned that the plaintiff was offering a long-
term lease of its car wash facility located at 249 Green-
wich Avenue in Stamford. Jashari subsequently con-
tacted the brokers on the listing, Jeff Snell and Andrew
Paul of Pyramid Realty Group.3 Paul emailed Jashari
a brochure about the property that advertised a ‘‘key
money’’4 amount of $400,000 and provided that ‘‘[g]oing
forward the tenant will be responsible for payment of
the [real estate] taxes, approximately [$]35,270 (2018).’’
Later that month, Jashari began negotiations with Gregg
Mercede, the plaintiff’s sole member and manager,
through the brokers.

Jashari’s first offer to Mercede to lease the car wash
was for $200,000 in key money and $12,000 per month in
rent. On June 6, 2019, Mercede counteroffered at
$300,000 in key money with rental payments at $12,000
per month triple net for three years, escalating at the rate
of 2 percent per year thereafter. Mercede’s counteroffer,
unlike Jashari’s initial offer, contained rental payments
on a triple net basis, also referred to as ‘‘NNN,’’ which,
as explained by Snell at trial, meant that, in addition to
base rent, the tenant would be responsible for certain
expenses of the property, including the payment of
insurance premiums, maintenance expenses, and nota-
bly, for purposes of the present appeal, real estate taxes.5
Mercede and Jashari continued to negotiate and make
offers to one another, all of which included, among
other things, triple net rent. In mid-June, Jashari and

Mercede signed a letter of intent that, in relevant part,
provided for a key payment of $300,000 and rent of
$9500 per month triple net for the first two years,
increasing in the years thereafter. The letter also con-
tained a provision that provided Jashari with a right,
exercisable within six months, to lease an additional
adjacent property for $2600 per month.

After Jashari signed the letter of intent, he prepared
a pro forma profit and loss projection (projection) for
the plaintiff so that it could obtain approval from its
lender. During this time, the plaintiff instructed its attor-
ney, Bruce Cohen, to prepare a formal lease incorporat-
ing the material terms of the letter of intent. In doing
so, Cohen mistakenly omitted the triple net provision
in the lease. The lease then was circulated among the
parties. Jashari proposed three technical changes that
did not alter the terms of the lease, which were accepted
by Mercede and incorporated into the final agreement.
The lease was signed without any comments from the
parties as to the missing triple net provision. When
Jashari signed the lease, he paid the $300,000 in key
money and a security deposit to Mercede. The closing
took place on September 17, 2019.6 At the closing, Jash-
ari signed a second lease addendum (addendum), which
required Jashari to purchase specific equipment, sup-
plies, and a billboard lease from the plaintiff. That same
day, Jashari paid Mercede the prorated rent and utilities
owed for September and prepaid for the month of Octo-
ber. Mercede did not ask Jashari to pay real estate taxes
for September or October on that day.

On September 30, 2019, approximately two weeks
after Jashari took possession of the property, the plain-
tiff sent Jashari an invoice that included a charge for
reimbursement of real estate taxes. That same day,
Jashari emailed Snell the following: ‘‘We have a major
issue with the rent. The contract does not reflect the
current invoice billed. Please contact me as soon as
possible.’’ Snell responded that he needed ‘‘to review
against the lease’’ and would call Jashari in the morning.
Snell then advised Jashari to reach out to Mercede.
Mercede emailed Jashari and Cohen an ‘‘invite’’ to a
meeting ‘‘to have a discussion regarding the misunder-
standing [of] the taxes.’’ The evidence in the record
does not confirm whether this meeting took place or,
if it did, what was discussed. Ultimately, Jashari refused
to pay the real estate taxes, and, thereafter, the plaintiff
commenced this action on October 21, 2019. The plain-
tiff’s complaint sought reformation of the lease because
it did ‘‘not conform to the real contract agreed upon
. . . and was executed as the result of a mutual mistake
of the parties’’ or, alternatively,
‘‘[a] mistake of the
[plaintiff] coupled with actual or constructive inequita-
ble conduct on the part of [the defendants].’’7

A two day bench trial was held on May 13 and 14,
2021, at which Jashari, Mercede, Cohen, Snell, and Paul

.

.

testified. Jashari testified8 that he was aware at the time
he signed the lease that it did not contain the triple net
provision and, consequently, under the terms of the
lease, he was not obligated to pay the real estate taxes.
He further testified that, before the lease was drafted,
he had discussed his concern about paying the real
estate taxes with Snell and Paul, and they told him on
multiple occasions that the plaintiff would pay the
taxes. The plaintiff’s counsel asked Jashari when this
conversation took place and how many times, to which
Jashari responded: ‘‘Could have been three. Could have
been five. This is an ongoing conversation that we had.
. . . Could have been around June time, I believe. Might
.’’ Although Jashari confirmed
have been in July .
that there was no written documentation that corrobo-
rated those conversations, he testified that he was one
‘‘[h]undred percent’’ sure that they took place. Jashari
was asked to explain how it was that in June, when he
signed the letter of intent, he agreed to pay the real
estate taxes, but then by the time the lease was signed
in September he was no longer responsible for real
estate taxes. He testified: ‘‘During this time the actual
known financials of the car wash were not clear-cut.
My biggest thing was, am I going to make money when
I take over this business.
. The real estate taxes,
.
the numbers were all over the place. The only thing I
could base it off of was three years prior for $35,000.
.
. So when I’m working out my updated expenses,
I come to the conclusion that I’m going to end up with
a loss, or I’m going to end up working just to pay my
rent. I could not do so.’’

.

.

The plaintiff’s counsel pointed out to Jashari that, in
the projection, which Jashari himself wrote in July,
2019, the line item for rent listed $156,000 for the first
year, which was $42,000 more than the rent listed in
the lease. Jashari testified that the difference was not
intended to account for the real estate taxes; rather, he
was accounting for the additional property that the
lease provided him the option of renting for $2600 a
month. Counsel further pointed out that the additional
$2600 a month would not bridge the difference, to which
Jashari responded: ‘‘I may not have computed it a hun-
dred percent, but at the time the expenses were not
known, so I was not trying to nickel and dime the
expenses.’’

Contrary to Jashari’s testimony, Mercede testified
that ‘‘from day one to the very end’’ it was his under-
standing that the rent was to be triple net and, therefore,
Jashari was responsible for the payment of the real
estate taxes. He further testified that he never had a
discussion with Jashari, a representative of Jashari, or
the brokers in which his understanding that the rent
was to be triple net was changed and that the first time
he learned that there was a misunderstanding on the
issue of real estate taxes was when Jashari refused to
pay them. Mercede was asked by the defendants’ coun-

sel about the projection and the missing taxes, to which
he stated: ‘‘I noticed there was a—the missing taxes,
but then I saw the rent was beefed up,’’ so he ‘‘believed
the taxes were in there.’’ Mercede admitted that,
although he was provided with the initial draft of the
lease, the minor revisions made to the lease, and the
final version, he did not notice the missing triple net
provision. He testified, ‘‘Yeah. I—you know—I made a
mistake. I missed it. I hired Bruce Cohen because I had
been out of it for six, seven, eight years. I mean—it’s
been a long time since I was looking at leases. . . . It’s
my fault for missing it.’’

Cohen confirmed that he failed to include the triple
net term in the lease, and, therefore, the lease did not
impose upon Jashari the obligation to pay the real estate
taxes. He agreed that the lease did not ‘‘conform to the
letter of intent that [he was] using as the guideline
for the preparation of the lease.’’ He explained that
he ‘‘overlooked the [triple net provision] as [he] was
drafting the lease’’ and that he accepted responsibility
for the mistake.

.

The brokers, Snell and Paul, each testified. Snell
explained that the offers at the outset all contained
triple net provisions because ‘‘that was a requirement
. the tenants would be
of the owner landlord that . .
responsible for payment of those additional expenses.’’
The plaintiff’s counsel asked Snell, ‘‘did [Jashari] ever
express to you any resistance or reluctance .
. to
pay the real property taxes attributable to the demised
premises?’’ Contrary to Jashari’s testimony, Snell
responded, ‘‘[n]o.’’ Snell testified that he was ‘‘under
the assumption that this was a triple net lease’’ and that,
although he did have a meeting with Jashari between
the time of the signing of the letter of intent and the
closing, there was no discussion at the meeting about
the real estate taxes; rather, it had to do with the terms
of the lease addendum relating to inventory. Snell was
also asked by the defendants’ counsel whether Jashari
had ever told him that he could not pay the real estate
taxes because he did not know what they would be, to
which Snell responded: ‘‘No, I don’t recall him ever
saying that.’’ Paul testified similarly. The plaintiff’s
counsel asked Paul, ‘‘[t]hroughout the entire process,
from beginning to end, what was your understanding
as to who was responsible to pay the real property taxes
attributable to the demised premises?’’ Paul responded:
‘‘The proposed tenant. It was always .
. the tenant.
You know the real estate taxes were going to be in
addition to the base rent.’’ Counsel then followed up
with, ‘‘[a]nd did that ever change, right up through the
time when [Jashari] took possession of the premises?’’
to which Paul responded, ‘‘[n]o.’’ Paul, like Snell, testi-
fied that he could not remember any conversation in
which Jashari said that he did not want to pay the taxes.

.

The court found in favor of the plaintiff on its reforma-

tion claim based on both theories advanced: unilateral
mistake and mutual mistake. It noted that it ‘‘primarily’’
determined that there was a mutual mistake but, alter-
natively, it held that the unilateral mistake ground was
satisfied as well. Overall, the court found that Jashari’s
testimony lacked credibility.9 It concluded that this was
‘‘not a ‘close call’ as to whether the plaintiff [had] proven
its case by clear and convincing evidence’’ and that
‘‘[t]he evidence and reasonable inferences [left] virtu-
ally no reasonable room for doubt.’’ The court’s specific
findings were extensive. It reasoned that the ‘‘most obvi-
ous and critical evidence presented to the court’’ was
that Jashari had, at all times, offered to pay more than
what the lease required as executed without the triple
net provision, including in the letter of intent that he
signed. The court pointed out that, as executed, the
lease provides for a total monthly payment of $9500,
yet ‘‘no one EVER contemplated a final agreement that
provided for a total monthly payment of $9500’’ and
‘‘[h]owever disingenuous [Jashari] has been, even he
appears to lack the audacity to claim (explicitly) that
there ever had been a discussion of a total rent of that
magnitude, much less an agreement . . . .’’ The court
further reasoned that there was no evidence or conceiv-
able reason—‘‘and one probably could not have been
proffered with a straight face—as to why the plaintiff
might have suddenly waived approximately $3000 of
monthly revenue, dropping [the triple net] requirement’’
without offsetting the basic rent. It ultimately deter-
mined that Jashari’s ‘‘refusal to acknowledge that there
had been a material mistake in the drafting of the lease’’
by omitting the triple net provision was ‘‘patently unrea-
sonable,’’ for ‘‘that there had been a mistake is a factual
matter that probably would satisfy even a beyond a
reasonable doubt standard (if it were applicable).’’
Accordingly,
the lease be
the court ordered that
reformed to account for the triple net rent and that the
defendants reimburse the plaintiff for the real estate
taxes in accordance therewith. This appeal followed.

I

The defendants first claim that the court improperly
granted reformation of the contract based on the ground
of unilateral mistake because, contrary to the court’s
conclusion, there was no clear, substantial, and con-
vincing proof of inequitable conduct on the part of the
defendants. We determine that this claim is moot and,
therefore, decline to consider its merits.

The following additional facts are relevant to our
discussion. On the first day of trial, counsel for the
plaintiff stated to the court that the plaintiff’s claim
for reformation was ‘‘based alternatively upon mutual
mistake or unilateral mistake coupled with inequitable
conduct.’’ After trial, the parties submitted their post-
trial briefs to the court. In its posttrial brief, the plaintiff
again noted that its complaint asserted alternative

.

.

grounds for reformation, but it focused its brief on
unilateral mistake. The plaintiff reasoned:
‘‘It soon
became obvious in this case that Jashari would never
admit a mistake in the lease terms dealing with the
obligation to pay real property taxes attributable to the
demised premises. Instead, he clearly wants to take
. The plaintiff, there-
advantage of the mistake .
fore, urges reformation based on the second alternative
ground—mistake of one party coupled with inequitable
conduct of the other party.’’ (Emphasis added.) The
defendants addressed both unilateral mistake and
mutual mistake in their posttrial brief. As previously
mentioned in this opinion, the court found that both
grounds were satisfied. It stated in relevant part: ‘‘The
court concludes that the plaintiff has proven both
approaches to establishing a right to reformation. Pri-
marily, the court has concluded that there was a
mutual mistake, insofar as the lease that was executed
did not reflect the actual agreement of the parties, mate-
rially departing from the agreement of the parties requir-
ing the defendants to reimburse the plaintiff for prop-
. [And] [t]o the extent that [Jashari]

contends that the lease as executed comports with his
intent as to the final terms of the agreement between the
parties—which the court, admittedly, has unreservedly
rejected as a proposition—then there would have been
a unilateral mistake by the plaintiff coupled with ineq-
uitable conduct by [Jashari].’’ (Emphasis added.)

.

.

On appeal, the defendants’ first claim challenges the
court’s decision only as to the unilateral mistake
ground. The defendants did not specifically challenge
the court’s finding of reformation on the basis of mutual
mistake but, rather, argued in their principal appellate
brief that ‘‘[i]n its posttrial brief, the plaintiff withdrew
its claim for reformation based on mutual mistake.’’
The plaintiff responded in its brief to this court that it
did not withdraw its claim for reformation based on
the mutual mistake ground and that, because the defen-
dants failed to challenge that ground on appeal, they
abandoned any claim on appeal pertaining to it. The
defendants argued in a footnote in their reply brief: ‘‘The
plaintiff also improperly parses the English language
by claiming .

not pursuing its claim [before the trial court] for relief

[posttrial] brief.

. . . urges reformation based on the second alternative
ground—mistake of one party coupled with inequitable
conduct of the other party.’
It is true that the
[previous] sentence does not contain the word with-
draw, but the entirety of the plaintiff’s argument to the
trial court was directed solely to its claim of unilateral
mistake. Perhaps the defendants should have written
that the plaintiff abandoned its claim of mutual mistake.
Nevertheless, the effect of the plaintiff’s conduct is
unaffected by the language describing it.’’ (Citations

Prior to oral argument, we issued an order and
requested that the parties be prepared to address the
issue of mootness.10 During oral argument, counsel for
the defendants argued that their claim concerning the
court’s finding of reformation on the ground of unilat-
eral mistake is not moot for three reasons: (1) the plain-
tiff, in essence, withdrew its claim based on mutual
mistake in its posttrial brief, and, as a result, the defen-
dants’ counsel ‘‘had no notice’’ that the court was going
to look at mutual mistake; (2) it is logically impossible
to have mutual mistake simultaneously with unilateral
mistake; and (3) based on the facts that the trial court
found in its decision, there was no mutuality of agree-
ment at the time the lease was signed, and, therefore,
the court could not have found both unilateral and
mutual mistake. Counsel for the plaintiff argued that,
contrary to the defendants’ contentions, the plaintiff
did not withdraw its claim for mutual mistake, and,
because the defendants failed to address that ground
in their first claim, that claim is therefore moot. We
agree with the plaintiff.

A trial court’s grant of reformation can be based on
mutual mistake, unilateral mistake coupled with fraud
or inequitable conduct, or, as in this case, primarily
one, with the other in the alternative. See Lopinto v.
Haines, 185 Conn. 527, 531, 441 A.2d 151 (1981) (‘‘[a]
cause of action for reformation of a contract rests on
the equitable theory that the instrument sought to be
reformed does not conform to the real contract agreed
upon and does not express the intention of the parties
and that it was executed as the result of mutual mistake,
or mistake of one party coupled with actual or construc-
tive fraud, or inequitable conduct on the part of the
other’’ (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omit-
ted)). Thus, if reformation is granted based on one
ground and the other in the alternative, and an appellate
claim challenges only one ground, the resolution of that
claim will not result in practical relief, and, conse-
quently, the claim is moot.

We are not convinced by the defendants’ first argu-
ment that the plaintiff essentially withdrew its claim
for reformation based on mutual mistake. Although the
defendants are correct that the plaintiff ‘‘urged’’ unilat-
eral mistake in its posttrial brief, the defendants have
failed to persuade us that doing so constituted a with-
drawal of the mutual mistake ground. The complaint,
which asserted a claim for reformation based on both
unilateral mistake and mutual mistake, never was
amended. See Costello & McCormack, P.C. v. Manero,
194 Conn. App. 417, 426, 221 A.3d 471 (2019) (‘‘The
principle that a plaintiff may rely only [on] what he has
alleged is basic. . . . It is fundamental in our law that
the right of a plaintiff to recover is limited to the allega-
tions [in the] complaint.’’ (Internal quotation marks
omitted.)). Moreover, the plaintiff represented to the
court at trial that it was seeking relief on the reformation
claim based on both grounds, and it mentioned both
grounds in its posttrial brief. Perhaps most importantly,
the trial court did not interpret the plaintiff’s focus on
unilateral mistake as a withdrawal of the mutual mis-
take ground, and it appears that neither did the defen-
dants. Rather, the court primarily concluded that there
was a mutual mistake, and, although the defendants’
counsel claimed at oral argument before this court that
he ‘‘had no notice’’ that the court was going to consider
mutual mistake and that ‘‘both parties presented their
arguments to the trial court based on unilateral mistake,
not mutual mistake,’’ the defendants’ posttrial brief
it
addressed the mutual mistake ground.
addressed both grounds under separate headings and
in similar lengths.

In fact,

We also are not convinced by the defendants’ second
or third arguments in support of their contention that
their first claim on appeal is not moot. The defendants’
counsel maintained at oral argument before this court
that it is ‘‘logically impossible’’ to have reformation

based on both mutual mistake and unilateral mistake
in the alternative, and, therefore, their claim cannot be
moot for failing to challenge mutual mistake because
it was impossible for the trial court to have found both
in the first place. The defendants’ counsel further
argued that, based on the facts found by the court,
Jashari knew at the time he signed the lease that there
was a mistake, which, according to the defendants,
would support only a claim of unilateral mistake and
inequitable conduct; see Traggis v. Shawmut Bank
Connecticut, N.A., 72 Conn. App. 251, 805 A.2d 105,
cert. denied, 262 Conn. 903, 810 A.2d 270 (2002); and,
consequently, the court could not have additionally
found the basis of a mutual mistake.11 We determine
that these arguments are indistinguishable and unper-
suasive.

A mutual mistake exists ‘‘where, in reducing to writ-
ing an agreement made or transaction entered into as
intended by the parties thereto, through mistake, com-
mon to both parties, the written instrument fails to
express the real agreement or transaction.’’ (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) Lopinto v. Haines, supra,
185 Conn. 532. For example, this court affirmed refor-
mation of a deed due to mutual mistake in Derby Sav-
ings Bank v. Oliwa, 49 Conn. App. 602, 714 A.2d 1278
(1998). In Derby Savings Bank, the defendant executed
a mortgage deed and note to the plaintiff, but, due to
a mistake by the attorney who drafted the mortgage
documents, the deed had a description of the wrong
property. Id., 602–603. The court, relying on the fact
that the parties previously had signed a commitment
letter that contained a description of the property that
was intended to be covered by the mortgage, granted
reformation based on mutual mistake, and we affirmed
that decision. Id., 603. A unilateral mistake is a ‘‘mistake
of one party,’’ and to be a ground for reformation, it
must be ‘‘coupled with actual or constructive fraud, or
inequitable conduct on the part of the other.’’ Lopinto
v. Haines, supra, 531. Inequitable conduct exists where
one party has ‘‘such knowledge as makes it ‘inequitable’
for [him] to retain his advantage.’’ Id., 535. In Traggis
v. Shawmut Bank Connecticut, N.A., supra, 72 Conn.
App. 251, for instance, this court affirmed reformation
based on unilateral mistake coupled with inequitable
conduct where the defendant seller intended for the
parties’ contract to provide for a closing of the property
sale on August 15, 1994, but a secretary mistakenly
wrote August 15, 1995, and the plaintiff buyer, although
aware that it was a mistake, sought to enforce it regard-
less. Id., 253–57. The court concluded, and we affirmed,
that the plaintiff had engaged in inequitable behavior
because he knew that it was a typographical error but
demanded the benefit of the contract despite his knowl-
edge. Id., 259–60.

We determine that it is possible for a trial court to find
mutual mistake and, alternatively, unilateral mistake

coupled with inequitable conduct. ‘‘It is well established
that [i]n a case tried before a court, the trial judge is
the sole arbiter of the credibility of the witnesses and
the weight to be given specific testimony.’’ (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) In re Aubrey K., 216 Conn.
App. 632, 658, 285 A.3d 1153 (2022), cert. denied, 345
Conn. 972, 286 A.3d 907 (2023). Thus, even if a party testifies
that the mistake was not common to both parties, as
was the case here, the judge can find that testimony to
be lacking credibility, find testimony in support of the
contrary to be reliable, and, consequently, grant refor-
mation on the ground of mutual mistake. See Lopinto
v. Haines, supra, 185 Conn. 536 (‘‘[w]e hasten to point
out that we fully realize that the trier is the judge of
credibility and, specifically, that what the terms of the
agreement were was a question of fact for the trier’’
(footnote omitted)). That is precisely how the court
in this case primarily found mutual mistake. It found
Jashari’s testimony that he believed the lease was inten-
tionally executed without the triple net provision to be
lacking credibility and the brokers’ testimony to the
contrary reliable. The finder of fact also can determine
simultaneously that, even if it were a unilateral mistake,
that ground is alternatively satisfied because there was
sufficient evidence of inequitable conduct. In this case,
for example, the court concluded that, even if the plain-
tiff had failed to establish that Jashari was also mis-
taken, ‘‘then there would have been a unilateral mistake
by the plaintiff coupled with inequitable conduct by
[Jashari]’’ because he was ‘‘attempting to rely upon and
ratify an error which could not have been reasonably
perceived to be an agreement of the plaintiff such that
the defendant is attempting to take inequitable advan-
tage of an obvious mistake by the plaintiff.’’

Moreover, assuming, arguendo, that the defendants
are correct that reformation based on both mutual mis-
take and unilateral mistake is logically impossible, in
this case the court ‘‘primarily’’ found ‘‘that there was
a mutual mistake.’’ (Emphasis added.) Unilateral mis-
take—which is the ground that the defendants focus
on entirely in this appeal—was the alternative basis.
Thus, even if we were to agree with the defendants
and, as a result, hold that the court erred in concluding
that the unilateral mistake ground was also alternatively
satisfied, that does not change the fact that the defen-
dants have not challenged on appeal mutual mistake,
which, in that circumstance, would be the court’s sole
basis for reformation. Therefore, this argument by the
defendants, even if it were persuasive, does not support
their contention that their claim is not moot.

In sum, because the defendants have failed to chal-
lenge mutual mistake in addition to unilateral mistake
in their first claim on appeal, we conclude that, even
if we agreed with the defendants’ first claim, we could
not provide them with any practical relief. Accordingly,
the defendants’ first claim is moot.

II

We now turn to the defendants’ second claim. The
defendants argue that the court erred by granting the
plaintiff equitable relief because the plaintiff’s miscon-
duct before the parties executed the lease barred its
claim for reformation. Specifically, the defendants
argue that, pursuant to Essex v. Day, 52 Conn. 483, 1 A.
620 (1885), the court should have precluded the plaintiff
from prevailing on its claim for reformation because
Mercede’s conduct amounted to recklessness.12 We are
not persuaded.

We first set forth the standard of review that governs
this claim and the substantive law relevant to when
conduct can bar a claim for reformation. ‘‘A cause of
action for reformation of a contract rests on the equita-
ble theory that the instrument sought to be reformed
does not conform to the real contract agreed upon and
does not express the intention of the parties and that
it was executed as the result of mutual mistake, or
mistake of one party coupled with actual or construc-
tive fraud, or inequitable conduct on the part of the
other.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Lopinto v.
Haines, supra, 185 Conn. 531. ‘‘We will reverse a trial
court’s exercise of its equitable powers only if it appears
that the trial court’s decision is unreasonable or creates
an injustice. . . . [E]quitable power must be exercised
equitably . . . [but] [t]he determination of what equity
requires in a particular case, the balancing of the equi-
ties, is a matter for the discretion of the trial court.
. . . In determining whether the trial court has abused
its discretion, we must make every reasonable presump-
tion in favor of the correctness of its action. . . . Our
review of a trial court’s exercise of the legal discretion
vested in it is limited to the questions of whether the
trial court correctly applied the law and could reason-
ably have reached the conclusion that it did.’’ (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) Bank of New York Mellon v.
Madison, 203 Conn. App. 8, 15, 247 A.3d 210 (2021).
‘‘When a decision in an equitable matter lies within the
trial court’s discretion, an appellate court will reverse
that decision only when an abuse of discretion is mani-
fest or where an injustice appears to have been done
.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Traggis v.
.
Shawmut Bank Connecticut, N.A., supra, 72 Conn.
App. 264.

.

.

It is settled law in Connecticut that the unquestion-
able negligence of the party seeking relief, such as the
failure to read the instrument and notice the mistake,
does not bar its claim for reformation. The seminal case
for this principle is Essex v. Day, supra, 52 Conn. 483.13
In Day, the town of Essex sought to issue bonds that
were to be payable at the option of the town in ten
years and due in twenty years, but, due to a printing
error, mistakenly issued bonds that were payable in
twenty years and did not contain the option clause. Id.,

.

.

485 (preliminary statement of facts). Although many of
the town’s agents assisted in executing and issuing the
bonds, none of them noticed the mistake until years
later, and the treasurer, ‘‘who was charged more espe-
cially with the duty of vigilance in every thing affecting
the finances of the town, signed the bonds without
reading them, supposing that they were payable at the
option of the town in ten years .
.’’ Id., 492. The
town filed suit, seeking reformation to correct the
bonds when the defendant, who knew about the mis-
take when he purchased the bonds, refused to surrender
them at the end of the ten year period. Id., 494. Our
Supreme Court assessed whether the town had been
guilty of ‘‘fatal negligence’’ such that it should be pre-
cluded from equitable relief. Id., 492. The court recog-
nized that there was ‘‘unquestionably a reprehensible
carelessness; a lack of intelligent attention to the matter
that must be regarded as not only unreasonable but
culpable.’’ Id. Nonetheless, the court noted that ‘‘[t]he
question however, as we conceive, is not so much
whether a culpable negligence existed, as it is, whether
such negligence should operate to bar the plaintiffs
from relief against this defendant. This negligence is
not of the extremist kind which the courts sometimes
characterize as the equivalent of fraud. It was not reck-
lessness; it was mere want of care. There was no indif-
ference to the effect; it was simply an honest assump-
tion that all was right. It is to be classed only with
those incautious and unbusiness-like acts which are
constantly presenting themselves and would not have
been noticed but for some mischief that they have
wrought. Thus a man carelessly signs a note for [$1000]
which he supposed to be for [$100]. Through a mistake
of the scrivener it is thus written, when he had directed
that it be written [one] hundred, and he signs it without
reading it. This is certainly gross carelessness; but
should it debar him from all remedy against a party
who receives the note knowing of the mistake? Would
not a court of equity enjoin the holder who took it with
full knowledge against its collection? Would it be good
in any court admitting of equitable
in his hands,
defenses, for more than [$100]? We think therefore that
the negligence of the plaintiffs in the execution and
issuing of the bonds, was not of such a character as to
preclude all equitable relief against the present defen-
dant.’’ Id., 492–93.

In the present case, the defendants argued that,
although under Day a party will not be barred from
reformation if the party is merely negligent, here, ‘‘the
plaintiff acted recklessly’’ and went ‘‘far beyond’’ the
conduct in Day, and, therefore, the plaintiff should have
been barred from reformation. Specifically, the defen-
dants argued that, although Day involved a ‘‘single mis-
take that no one involved’’ saw, in the present case,
Mercede ‘‘had at least six and possibly more chances
to see and correct his so-called ‘mistake’ ’’; ‘‘knew even

before his lawyer started drafting the lease that who
was to pay taxes was an issue between himself and
Jashari’’; ‘‘was consciously aware that there was no line
item in Jashari’s [projection] demonstrating that the
tenant would pay property taxes, but he did nothing to
clarify that’’; ‘‘pro-rated rent, but not taxes’’ at the clos-
ing; and overall was ‘‘aware of and consciously ignored
the facts that were obviously arrayed before him.’’

.

The court was not persuaded by the defendants’ argu-
‘‘The most plausible observation
ment. It reasoned:
made by the defendants is that [Mercede] .
. was
remiss in not having caught the error sooner. That,
however, is likely an almost-always applicable observa-
tion in contract reformation—why didn’t the plaintiff
catch the error sooner (before execution)? As reflected
in the cases cited by the defendants, [Essex v. Day,
supra, 52 Conn. 483, and Voll v. Lafayette Bank & Trust
Co., 223 Conn. 419, 429, 613 A.2d 266 (1992)], negli-
gence—even ‘gross’ negligence—is not an automatic
disqualifier for reformation. With refreshing candor,
counsel for the plaintiff, involved in the drafting of the
lease, admitted responsibility for the disparity between
the actual agreement of the parties as reflected by the
letter of intent and the lease he drafted ostensibly based
on that letter of intent.’’ (Footnote omitted.) The court
additionally noted that, despite the defendants’ efforts,
it had ‘‘great difficulty distinguishing’’ from the present
case Day and Voll, in which cases the parties who
sought relief were merely negligent.

The court also made factual findings that directly
refuted the underpinnings of the defendants’ argument
that Mercede was reckless. The defendants argued that
Mercede was reckless because he knew that who was
going to pay taxes was an issue, yet the court concluded
that ‘‘[t]here is no documentary evidence, and no plausi-
ble/credible testimony (if at all), to the effect that the
defendants had ever communicated ‘second thoughts’
about a triple net provision in the lease to the plaintiff.
Even if [Jashari] had communicated to the brokers his
concerns about how much taxes might escalate over
the years, the court cannot find any credible basis for
any contention that [Jashari] had communicated with
the plaintiff in any way suggesting a reluctance to pro-
ceed on a triple net basis.’’

The defendants also argued that Mercede was reck-
less because he ‘‘was consciously aware’’ that the pro-
jection did not have a line item for real estate taxes
and ‘‘did nothing to clarify that,’’ yet the court, like
Mercede, found that the projection’s line item for rent
must have incorporated real estate taxes within it. The
court determined: ‘‘If the argument is that there was
no explicit or separate ‘provision for real estate taxes’
on [the projection], that statement would appear to be
correct (in a literal sense). However, the aggregate
rental expense shown on that document for the first

two years is $156,000 and $162,000, respectively. With
a base rent of $9500 per month for each of those years,
and if it were assumed that there were no triple net
requirement,
the aggregate annual rent would be
$114,000 (12 x $9500), leaving a difference between
‘true’ rent and the total rent expense shown on the form
of $42,000 for the first year and $48,000 for the second
year. Those disparities are well in excess of the annual
tax for the 2018-2019 fiscal year ($35,270), such that
even if there were a modestly substantial increase in
taxes for the first year of the lease (2019-2020), the
discrepancy in figures would be adequate to cover it.
There may well be other expenses characterized in
terms of being related to rent, but the only apparent
and plausible explanation for the sizeable discrepancies
would seem to be that the defendants did, in fact,
include tax reimbursement as part of the aggregate
rental expense on the document.’’ (Footnote omitted.)

Although the court noted that the defendants’ argu-
ment about Mercede having adjusted for rent but not
for taxes at the closing was ‘‘[t]he only portion of the
defendants’ narrative that potentially could support the
defendants’ position,’’ it concluded that it would only
support the position ‘‘if there were any evidence of an
intent to change the terms of the lease.’’ But ‘‘[t]here
was no credible evidence, if any at all, to [that] effect.’’

On appeal, the defendants make the same argument
that they did to the trial court. They state in their brief
that ‘‘[r]esearch has not located a single case in Con-
necticut, or elsewhere for that matter, in which a party
seeking relief under unilateral mistake has been so
oblivious to its rights as was the plaintiff in this case’’
and ‘‘[t]he closest analogous case to the one at bar is
[Essex v. Day, supra, 52 Conn. 483],’’ which ‘‘does not
come close to approaching the sloppiness with which
Mercede claims he acted.’’ They further argue that ‘‘the
facts demonstrate that Mercede’s conduct was at least
reckless, if not intentional.’’ Specifically, they contend
that Mercede was reckless because ‘‘[he] knew or could
certainly have known that Jashari did not intend to pay
real estate taxes and intentionally ignored that fact’’;
‘‘[he] alone had multiple opportunities to discover the
mistake and had actual evidence that Jashari did not
share his understanding on the real estate taxes,’’
whereas in Day, ‘‘numerous town actors were involved
in creating and perpetrating the mistake’’; and he did
not catch the mistake when he saw that the projection
did not have a line item for taxes or when he adjusted
for rent at the closing.

We are not persuaded that the court’s decision to
grant reformation was an abuse of discretion or caused
an injustice. The defendants have failed to cite to any
evidence in the record to support their contentions that
Mercede ‘‘knew or could certainly have known that
Jashari did not intend to pay real estate taxes and inten-

tionally ignored that fact’’ and ‘‘had actual evidence that
Jashari did not share his understanding on real estate
taxes.’’ Upon our review, these unsupported assertions
are the very antithesis of the trial court’s findings. We
also are not persuaded by the defendants’ attempt to
distinguish Day from the facts of this case. Rather,
we agree with the trial court’s conclusion that Day is
indistinguishable.

As previously mentioned in this opinion, our Supreme
Court held in Day that, although it was ‘‘certainly gross
carelessness’’ for the town to miss the error on the
bonds, ‘‘[i]t was not recklessness’’ and did not preclude
equitable relief. Essex v. Day, supra, 52 Conn. 493. In
the present case, the defendants have failed to persuade
us that Mercede’s conduct was any different from that
involved in Day. We are not convinced by the defen-
dants’ non sequitur argument that, because in Day,
‘‘numerous town actors were involved in creating and
perpetrating the mistake’’ whereas here, Mercede acted
alone, he was therefore reckless. If anything, one would
surmise that the more hands a mistake passes through
without it being caught, the greater the negligence. The
defendants in their brief and at oral argument adamantly
relied on the fact that the lease passed through Mer-
cede’s hands on multiple occasions without him reading
the lease and recognizing the mistake, but ‘‘it has never
been the law of this state that the mere omission to
read [the written instrument], or to know all its con-
tents, would bar any relief by way of reformation of
such instrument.’’ Fidelity & Casualty Co. v. Palmer,
91 Conn. 410, 418, 99 A. 1052 (1917). That is exactly
what happened in Day—multiple town officials and
the treasurer failed to read the bonds and notice the
mistake—and that is exactly what our Supreme Court
held was not enough to constitute recklessness so as
to bar reformation. As the trial court in the present
case correctly pointed out, negligence in the form of
failing to read the instrument and recognize the mistake,
although still negligence, is ‘‘almost always applicable’’
to this context and has never been, and is not now, ‘‘an
automatic disqualifier for reformation.’’

The only arguments by the defendants that may be
somewhat persuasive are that Mercede did not inquire
into the projection despite the fact that it did not have
a line item for real estate taxes and that he did not
account for the taxes when he adjusted for the rent at
the closing. We are required to make every reasonable
presumption in favor of the correctness of the court’s
actions. See Bank of New York Mellon v. Madison,
supra, 203 Conn. App. 15. In doing so, we conclude that
the court’s rejection of those arguments, as discussed
earlier in this opinion, was reasonable.

For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that it was
not an abuse of discretion or an injustice for the court
to have granted the plaintiff equitable relief in the form

of reformation.

The portion of the appeal related to the claim that
the trial court improperly granted reformation of the
contract on the ground of unilateral mistake is dis-
missed as moot; the judgment is affirmed.

In this opinion the other judges concurred.
1 Ismet Jashari, Dorian’s father, acted as the guarantor on the lease that
is at issue in this appeal. Ismet Jashari was not materially involved in the
events that are relevant to this appeal.

2 Jashari graduated with high honors from Manhattanville College, where
he majored in both legal studies and economics and minored in psychology.
During college, Jashari engaged in freelance work relating to e-commerce,
stocks, and cryptocurrency, ‘‘[ran] the financials’’ for a mechanic shop of
a gas station that his father co-owned, and assisted his father with his
construction business. Additionally, around the time that Jashari graduated
college, his father transferred his ownership interest in several town houses
to Jashari ‘‘for court purposes’’ so that Jashari could commence eviction
proceedings. Jashari was a self-represented party in those proceedings.

3 Although Pyramid Realty Group initially represented only the interests
of the plaintiff, the parties later entered into an agreement that it represented
both sides of the transaction.

4 At trial, Jashari testified that ‘‘key money’’ refers to ‘‘[t]he money needed
in order to acquire the business.’’ Although the parties have not further
explained this term with any additional specificity, it is apparent from the
context of the record that it refers to a lump sum of money paid to a landlord
by a tenant to secure a commercial tenancy.

5 See also Walgreen Eastern Co. v. West Hartford, 329 Conn. 484, 488,
187 A.3d 388 (2018) (‘‘[t]he developer entered into a ‘triple net’ or ‘NNN’
lease with the plaintiff under which the plaintiff was responsible for the
payment of all insurance, maintenance, and property tax expenses’’).

6 Although the parties refer to this date as the ‘‘closing,’’ Paul clarified in
his testimony that it was not a formal closing because, by that point, the
lease had been signed and checks had been delivered. Nonetheless, for
purposes of clarity, we will refer to it as the closing as well.

7 The plaintiff also asserted a claim for unjust enrichment. Because the
trial court found in favor of the plaintiff on its claim for reformation, it
concluded that it would be legally inconsistent to find in favor of the plaintiff
on its unjust enrichment claim, and, therefore, it found in favor of the
defendants on that claim. Thus, the unjust enrichment claim is not at issue
in this appeal.

8 As discussed throughout this opinion, the trial court found Jashari’s

testimony overall to be lacking in credibility.

9 ‘‘[I]t is the exclusive province of the trier of fact to weigh the conflicting
evidence, determine the credibility of witnesses and determine whether to
accept some, all or none of a witness’ testimony.’’ (Internal quotation marks
omitted.) Delena v. Grachitorena, 216 Conn. App. 225, 231, 283 A.3d 1090
(2022).

10 We notified the parties that ‘‘counsel of record shall be prepared to
address whether this appeal is moot; see State v. Lester, 324 Conn. 519,
526–27 [153 A.3d 647] (2017); for failure to challenge the trial court’s conclu-
sion that the plaintiff established its right to reformation on the ground of
mutual mistake, which conclusion is an independent alternative basis for
the trial court’s judgment. See Lopinto v. Haines, 185 Conn. 527, 531 [441
A.2d 151] (19[8]1).’’

‘‘Although the parties did not raise the issue of mootness in this appeal,
we do so sua sponte because mootness implicates the court’s subject matter
jurisdiction and is, therefore, a threshold matter to resolve.’’ State v. Arpi,
75 Conn. App. 749, 751, 818 A.2d 48 (2003).

11 To the extent that this argument could be construed as an independent
challenge to the court’s finding of mutual mistake, we note that such an
argument would be unavailing. The fact that the defendants did not challenge
the court’s finding of mutual mistake in their first claim is the very reason
that we determine this claim to be moot.

12 In their principal appellate brief, the defendants also rely heavily on
§ 157 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts and case law from other
jurisdictions interpreting it. Section 157 provides: ‘‘A mistaken party’s fault
in failing to know or discover the facts before making the contract does
not bar him from avoidance or reformation under the rules stated in this

Chapter, unless his fault amounts to a failure to act in good faith and
in accordance with reasonable standards of fair dealing.’’ 1 Restatement
(Second), Contracts § 157, p. 416 (1981). The defendants argue that Mercede
did not act in ‘‘good faith’’ or comport himself ‘‘in accordance with reasonable
standards of fair dealing,’’ and, therefore, the court should have rejected
the plaintiff’s claim for reformation. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) No
Connecticut court has cited to, let alone adopted, § 157 of the Restatement
(Second) of Contracts. The defendants acknowledge that it is nonbinding
secondary authority but assert that we should look to it for guidance because
‘‘[t]he law has changed since the Supreme Court issued its decision in [Day],
yet neither it nor this court in the ensuing 137 years has had cause to address
a fact pattern similar to the one presented in this case.’’

.

Day, despite its age, remains good law, and this court and other courts
have continued to rely on it. See Traggis v. Shawmut Bank Connecticut,
N.A., supra, 72 Conn. App. 267–68; Office Furniture Rental Alliance, LLC
v. Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co., 981 F. Supp. 2d 111, 122 n.7 (D. Conn.
2013). Moreover, ‘‘[i]t is axiomatic that, [a]s an intermediate appellate court,
we are bound by Supreme Court precedent and are unable to modify it.
.
. [W]e are not at liberty to overrule or discard the decisions of our
Supreme Court but are bound by them. . . . [I]t is not within our province
to reevaluate or replace those decisions.’’ (Internal quotation marks omit-
ted.) State v. Yury G., 207 Conn. App. 686, 693–94 n.2, 262 A.3d 981, cert.
denied, 340 Conn. 909, 264 A.3d 95 (2021). Thus, we decline the defendants’
invitation to look to § 157 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts for
guidance and, instead, we address the defendants’ claim only as it relates
to Day.

13 See also Voll v. Lafayette Bank & Trust Co., 223 Conn. 419, 429, 613
A.2d 266 (1992) (affirming that mere negligence cannot defeat claim for
reformation because holding otherwise ‘‘would reward fraudulent conduct
at the expense of one whose mere carelessness had caused him unwittingly
to agree to terms not contemplated by the parties’’ and ‘‘[e]quity should not
sanction such an unconscionable result’’); Cherkoss v. Gasser, 123 Conn.
368, 371, 195 A. 737 (1937) (holding that negligence of parties seeking relief
did not preclude them from obtaining reformation); Geremia v. Boyarsky,
107 Conn. 387, 392, 140 A. 749 (1928) (holding that defendants were entitled
to decree canceling contract despite their negligence in calculating their
bid, when plaintiff, before he signed contract, had good reason to believe
substantial error had been made in amount of bid and, while contract was
still executory, refused to permit correction of error and attempted to take
unconscionable advantage of it).

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
