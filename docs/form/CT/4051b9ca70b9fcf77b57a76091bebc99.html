      <pre>WHAT TO EXPECT ON THE RESOLUTION PLAN DATE  
IN YOUR DIVORCE, CUSTODY OR VISITATION CASE 
 

As of January, 2021, Connecticut has a new process for custody, visitation, dissolution of 
 
marriage, and legal separation cases.  It was developed with the help of the National Center for 
State  Courts  based  on  research  and  experience  in  other  states.    The  process  is  designed  to 
encourage parties to concentrate on resolving their cases by agreement, instead of engaging in 
lengthy litigation.  It seeks to give each case the level of court resources it needs sooner than was 
possible under the old process, and reduce the number of necessary court appearances.  

The Resolution Plan Date 

After your case has been filed, it will be scheduled for a “Resolution Plan Date.”   If your case 
involves  financial  issues  like  child  support,  alimony,  or  dividing  marital  property,  you 
should complete and file a Financial  Affidavit before your Resolution Plan Date.  Forms 
and instructions for financial affidavits may be found on the Family Forms Page. 

On  this  date,  you  will  learn  how  the  court  process  works  and  have  an  opportunity  to  ask 
questions.    A  Family  Relations  Counselor,  who  is  an  employee  of  the  court  trained  in  family 
matters, will review your case with you and the other party (and your attorneys, if you have them) 
to identify:  

o 

the areas where you agree and disagree, 

o  how likely you are to reach an agreement on any disputed issues, and  

o 

the kind of help you need to resolve your case as a whole.  

The Family Relations Counselor will then recommend an action plan to the court based on the 
level of help your case needs to come to a conclusion.  The plan will include any recommended 
services  to  support  your  resolution  of  the  outstanding  issues.    Possible  services  include 
information-gathering  or  evaluations  by  Family  Services,  mediation  with  a  Family  Relations 
Counselor, court hearing time, or the assignment of a designated Family Relations Counselor or 
judge to your case for its duration.  

After you meet with a Family Relations Counselor, a judge will make a scheduling order 
that fits the action plan, including future court dates and what you are expected to do in between 
them.  The Resolution Plan Date is not the time for a contested hearing or trial before a 
judge.  However, if you agree on all of the issues in your case, a judge may be able to hear 
your case that day and approve your agreement, finishing the case.  You may also appear 
before a judge that day to address issues about future scheduling or whether certain services are 
appropriate in your case.  

If you are the plaintiff or applicant and you do not appear for your Resolution Plan Date 
 
(either by remote video or in person, depending on how the event is scheduled), your case may 
be dismissed. If you are the defendant or the respondent and you do not appear, court orders or 
a final judgment may be entered against you. 

After the Resolution Plan Date 

 

1 

If your case is not completely resolved on the Resolution Plan Date, the court will enter a 
 
scheduling order that sets out the important events for the rest of the case.  The schedule may 
include one or more Case Dates, a date for a pretrial settlement conference, and a date for a trial 
if the parties prove unable to reach a full agreement.   

A Case Date is a hearing before a judge to address matters like motions for temporary 
orders on custody, child support, or other subjects, to be in effect while your case is pending.  The 
judge may also hear reports on the progress of services that have been ordered in your case.  
Under the old process, each time a motion was filed in a case it was scheduled for a hearing on 
a “short calendar,” when motions in dozens of other cases were also scheduled for the same time.  
This  required  parties  to  appear  in  court  repeatedly  as  each  motion  was  filed  in  their  case.  
Because of the number of cases scheduled on a short calendar, there was often insufficient time 
to devote to each one.  Under the new process, a Case Date will afford a longer dedicated period 
of time to address all of the pending issues in the case, rather than dealing with them piecemeal 
at a series of short calendars. 

Case Dates are not for the final trial of your case.  They are intended as checkpoints along 
the way to final resolution, to keep your case on track and to conduct brief hearings on issues that 
need orders in place before there is a final agreement or trial.  There will likely be one or two Case 
Dates  scheduled  in  your  matter.    The  number  and  length  of  the  Case  Dates  in  your  case  will 
depend on the level of services determined to be appropriate on your Resolution Plan Date.  Of 
course, if the parties have reached a full and final agreement at a Case Date, the agreement may 
be considered and approved by the judge, finishing the case at that time.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
