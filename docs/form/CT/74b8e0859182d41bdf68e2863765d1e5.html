What are my legal rights in detention? 

•	  You have the right to have your own lawyer. 

•	  You have the right to know what crimes you are accused of. 
 

•	  You have the right to choose not to talk to police or anyone else 
 

 
about your charges.1 

•	  You have the right to have your parents with you when police question you.2 
 

•	  Detention staff must notify your parent or guardian when you are brought 

 

to detention.3 

3 

What does my lawyer do?
 

•	  Your lawyer represents you. 
  

Your lawyer does not represent the state, the prosecutor, or your parents. 

•	  Your lawyer will listen to what you want and will speak for you in court. 
 

•	  Your lawyer will answer your questions about your case and your rights. 
 

•	  Everything you and your lawyer talk about is confidential. 

 

 
Your lawyer cannot tell someone what you say unless you say it’s okay.4 

•	  You have a right not to tell anyone what you and your lawyer talk about. 

How do I contact my lawyer? 

•	  If you don’t know your lawyer’s name or phone number, ask detention staff to find 
 
out for you, or call a Public Defender’s office (the phone number is on page 27). 

•	  The fastest way to get in touch with your lawyer is to call. You can also write letters 
to your lawyer. Write your lawyer’s name and contact information on the Important 
 
Contacts Card you got with this book so you will have it when you need it. 

•	  If your lawyer doesn’t return your phone calls, and your lawyer is a public defender, 
you can call the Office of the Public Defender and ask to talk to the supervising 
 
attorney. See page 27 for phone numbers for Public Defenders’ offices. 

 

•	  If you don’t hear from your lawyer when you call and write letters, you can write to 

the court (addresses are on page 25) and ask the court to appoint a different lawyer 
to represent you. You should explain why you are asking for a different lawyer.

•	  You did not show up at another court hearing of yours. 
 

•	  You did not follow all the requirements of a suspended detention order. 

A court order for detention can last up to 15 days.

After you have been in detention for 3 days, your brothers and sisters will be allowed 

to visit you without getting special permission.

permission from the Detention Superintendent.

normal visiting hours. 

•	  You should be allowed to visit with your family on weekends and holidays.

This is called a grievance. See page 19 for information on how to file a grievance. 
You should also tell your lawyer.

in your presence, but can never be read.
 

When you write to your lawyer:

18 

What if I have a complaint about something that happened 
 
to me at the Detention Center? 

If you have a complaint about something that happened to you, like the way staff talks to 
you, things that got stolen, kids bothering you, or if staff breaks the rules in this book: 
 

•	  You can talk to a Shift Supervisor or Deputy Superintendent, or fill out a Request 

Form that tells them what you are complaining about; or 
 

•	  You can make a written complaint. This is called a grievance.26 

•	  Tell your lawyer about the complaint. 

How do I file a written complaint or grievance? 
 
 
Fill out a Grievance Form. 
 
You have to write down your complaint and what you want done about it.27 

•	  If you don’t know where to get a grievance form or if you need help with it, ask staff 

or your attorney for help. 

•	  Within 48 hours (not counting weekends and holidays), the Detention Superinten-

dent must tell you, in writing, what will be done about your complaint.28 
 

•	  If you don’t like what the Detention Superintendent did about your complaint, or you 
don’t get an answer in 48 hours (not counting weekends and holidays), or you do not 
want to go to the Detention Superintendent first, you can send the Grievance Form 
to the Deputy Director of Juvenile Residential Services at the Court Support Services 
Division (CSSD)29 at the address on page 20. 

 

 

•	  If you need help filling out the form, ask a staff member or your attorney to help. 
 

•	  You can contact the Ombudsman at any time about your complaint. 
 

The Ombudsman does not work for Detention. His or her job is to try to help you with 
your complaint. You can also file a grievance with the Ombudsman by filling out a 
Grievance Form and putting it in the locked boxed that says Ombudsman. Staff will 
show you where these boxes are. 

19 

Can I file with Court Support Services (CSSD)? 

Yes. 

You can file a grievance with Juvenile Residential Services at the Court Support Ser-
vices Divsion (CSSD). There are two ways to send your grievance to the Deputy 
Director of Juvenile Residential Services at CSSD:30 

•	  If the Detention Center has a sealed box for grievances to the Deputy Director of 

Juvenile Residential Services, you can put your grievance in that box. 
 

•	  If the Detention Center does not have a sealed box for this, mail the form to: 

Deputy Director of Juvenile Residential Services

Court Support Services Division

Central Office and Operations

936 Silas Deane Highway

Wethersfield, CT 06109


         

Can I get in trouble for filing a complaint or grievance? 

No. 
 
The staff cannot threaten, coerce, or punish you 
for filing a complaint or grievance.31

Can I go back to school when I get out of detention? 

You have the right to go back to the school you went to before detention. 

If you are going back to your old school, talk to you guidance counselor about getting 
back into classes. If your old school does not have the right grade for you, they should 
place you in another school in your town or district. 

If you are going to school in a new district, go the the main office to enroll. 

You have the right to start school again right away. 

Detention should send your education records to the school when the school tells them 
you have re-enrolled. You have the right to start school right away even if the school has 
not gotten your education records from detention yet.32 

The school cannot make you wait for statewide testing, exams or finals are over. 

If the school says you cannot attend because you are no longer a resident, they must 
give you written notice of this. You have the right to ask for a hearing about your resi-
dency and your right to go to school there.33 

Can I be expelled for the offense I went to detention for? 

No. 

When you go back to school, you cannot be expelled for an offense you already spent 
time in detention for.34 

21 

Can I talk to someone about being LGBTQI?
(Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning, Intersex) 

You can talk with any detention staff about questions you have or information you want. 
You can also ask to talk to healthcare staff about this. 

Detention staff, including healthcare staff, may tell each other that you talked about this 
but they cannot tell anyone who is not on staff. 

How will I be treated if I am LGBTQI? 

You have the right to be treated equally and respectfully by other juveniles and by staff. 

Detention staff should talk with you as soon as possible after you are admitted to be 
sure that you feel safe and that your privacy is respected. 

If you you do not feel safe with your roommate, tell detention staff. Ask them to give you 
a single room. 

You should not be forced to undress or shower in front of others if it makes you feel 
uncomfortable. 

What can I do if someone bothers me because I am LGBTQI? 

If you are harrassed because you are LGBTQI, tell your CPO or supervisor right away. 
You can also file a written complaint. This is called a grievance. See page 19 for how 
 
to do this. 

Where can I get books or videos about being LGBTQI? 

Ask your CPO or look in the library for reading materials and information about support 
groups and organizations. 

True Colors helps LGBTQI youth. The phone number is on page 27. 

22 

What should I do if someone makes sexual advances or 
 
comments or touches me in a way I don’t want? 

You have a right to be free from sexual advances from other youth or from staff. 
Other youth and staff have the right to be free from sexual advances from you.35 

The Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) says there is zero tolerance for sexual abuse 
or sexual harrassment in juvenile detention.
 

Examples of sexual advances that are not allowed include:
 

•	  When a staff member makes sexual comments to you 
 

•	  When someone touches the private parts of your body without your permission 
 

•	  When someone forces you to touch the private parts of his or her body 
 

•	  Having sex 
 

•	  Forcing you to have sex with someone else 
 

•	  Asking you to trade sexual acts for favors 

23 

What should I do if someone pressures me for sex?
 

If you feel pressured for sex, do not wait for an assault to happen. 
Tell staff right away. 

Tell a Juvenile Detention Officer (JDO), Classification and Program Officer (CPO), 
supervisor, teacher, medical or mental health staff. 

You can talk to a professional outside of detention, like your probation officer, lawyer, 
public defender DCF worker or judge. 

You can file a written grievance. See page 19 for information on how to do this. 
 
If you are worried about your safety, write EMERGENCY on the form and tell staff. 

Do not use the bathroom, brush your teeth, shower or change your clothes. 
 

4.  Get support from mental health services or victim services. 

 

 

Your CPO will help you.See page 17 about how to see a therapist. 

2.  Report the abuse to someone you trust. Call or tell them in person. 
 

1.  Report the abuse to staff. 

   

3.  Save the evidence. 

 

 

If you were sexually abused, do these four things immediately: 

To report an assault, call the Sexual Assault Crisis Service

Footnotes 

1 In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1 (1967) Petition for writ of habeas corpus filed 
byparents to secure release of their 15-year old son who had been 
committed as juvenile delinquent to state industrial school. The United 
States Supreme Court held that juvenile has right to notice of charges, 
to counsel, to confrontation and cross examination of witnesses, and to 
privilege against self-incrimination. 

2 Conn. Gen. Stat. § 46b-137 (making any admission, confession or 
statement made by a youth under the age of 18 to a police officer or 
Juvenile Court official inadmissible in any proceeding concerning the 
alleged delinquency unless made by such youth in the presence of a 
parent or guardian, after the parent or guardian has been advised of the 
youth’s Miranda rights, including the right to an attorney. An exception to 
this exists for youth who are 16 or 17 whose case has been transferred 
back to Juvenile Court from the  youthful offender, adult criminal or motor 
vehicle docket who made a written or oral statement or admission prior to 
the transfer.

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
