      <pre>What Happens  
When You Go To 
Housing Court

Going to court for any reason can be an 
unsettling experience. This pamphlet will 
give you answers to questions that you 
might have about what you can expect 
when you come to the Housing Court.

What should I wear to court?

The court is a formal setting so you should 
dress appropriately. For example, you should 
probably not wear t-shirts or jeans with holes in 
them, tank tops, halter tops, shorts, or revealing 
clothing. If you are bringing people with you to 
court, please remind them to dress appropriately 
too. The marshal may ask anyone who is not 
appropriately dressed to leave the courtroom.

Can I bring my children to court?

Try not to bring your children to court. The 
day can be long for young children, and if they 
become noisy, they will distract people in the 
courtroom, interrupt the proceedings, and make 
it hard to hear the recording that is made of all 
court hearings.

What time should I come to  
the courthouse?

You will receive a notice telling you the date and 
time you must come to court. You should be 
at the court at least 15 minutes before the time 
written in your notice. For example, if the court 
papers say to appear at court at 9:30 AM, you 
should plan to arrive at the courthouse no later 
than 9:15 AM. Courts have metal detectors at 
their entrances, so it may take extra time to enter 
the building.

Where can I park?

Some courthouses have parking, but many 
do not. You may need to park in a nearby 
lot or garage, or find on-street parking. For 
information, please call the Clerk’s Office or 
check the website: http://www.jud.ct.gov/
directory/court_directions.htm. 

What will happen when I get to  
the courthouse?

The courthouse doors open at 8:30 AM. Please 
be prepared to wait briefly in a line at the 
entrance. When you enter the courthouse, you 
will have to walk through a metal detector, 
which is operated by the Judicial Marshals, who 
provide security for the courthouse. 

Any metal items can set off the metal detector. 
You will have to empty your pockets of all 
metal objects before walking through the metal 
detector, and anything you bring with you 
will be scanned. If your belt has a large metal 
buckle or your jacket has large metal buttons or 
zippers, for example, you may be asked to take it 
off. Things that could be used as a weapon (for 
example, a pocket knife) will be taken from you 
so please do not bring them with you.

How long will I be at the court?

It is hard to answer this question because it 
depends on the number of cases in the court that 
day, how long the other hearings take, or if you 
make an agreement. Most cases are finished by 
lunch time, but you should plan on being at the 
court for the whole day. The court staff will try to 
get you out as quickly as possible.

Do I have to make an agreement?

Do I need a Lawyer?

No, you do not need a lawyer. You will have 
to decide if you want to have a lawyer but if 
you decide you want one, you may hire one 
on your own. Since this is a civil case, the 
court will not appoint one for you. That only 
happens in criminal cases and some other 
cases where you could be put in jail. The Clerk’s 
Office, the Court Service Center, or the Public 
Information Desk can give you phone numbers 
and websites for various legal services. These 
services will decide if they can take your case. 

Where do I go once I get into  
the courthouse?

You should go into the courtroom and sit 
down. The clerk will read off a list of case 
names (docket call). When you hear your 
name, please speak out loud to tell the clerk 
that you are in the courtroom. The clerk will 
then mark your case “Ready.” The clerk will 
then tell you to see the housing mediator. 
You may be asked to take a seat outside of 
the courtroom to wait, or you may be sent 
immediately to see the housing mediator.

What if I get to court late and I don’t 
hear the list of cases?

If you get to the court late, you may miss the 
list of cases (docket call) and you may lose 
your case for not coming to the trial. If you are 
late, please wait until the judge takes a break 
(recess) and talk to the clerk.

What if I don’t hear my name when the 
clerk reads the list of cases?

If you do not hear your name, wait until the 
judge takes a break. Then you can go up to the 
clerk and ask for help. You may be told to go to 
the Clerk’s Office to check your file.

What are the basic rules of  
courtroom conduct?

Before you enter the courtroom, please:

may have

•  Throw away all food, drinks, and gum 

•  Take off any hat you are wearing, unless you 

wear it for religious reasons

When you are in the courtroom, please:

•  Sit in the courtroom quietly until it is your turn  

to speak

•  Stand when the judge enters or leaves the 

courtroom and when you are speaking with  
the judge

•  Refer to the judge as “judge” or “your honor”

•  Be sure to answer all questions out loud. If you 
nod your head, the person making the record 
of the proceedings will have to ask you to speak 
so that your answer can be recorded

•  Do not interrupt other people when they  

are speaking.

What is a housing mediator?

What happens if I make an agreement?

A housing mediator is a trained employee of 
the court. The mediator will meet with you and 
the other parties in your case to try to work out 
an agreement (also called a settlement) so you 
do not need to have a trial. After your case is 
called in court, you will be asked to wait in the 
lobby until a mediator calls you for mediation (a 
discussion with you and the other parties in  
the case).

No, you don’t have to make an agreement,  
and no one will ever force you to make an 
agreement to settle a case. But many cases do 
settle after people have the chance to talk with 
the housing mediator. 

What if the attorney for the other side 
wants to talk to me?

Attorneys often talk with the other parties in 
a case to try to settle it without waiting to see 
a housing mediator. You can make a private 
agreement with the attorney and bring it to the 
judge for approval. If you have an attorney, you 
should tell the attorney to talk to your attorney. 
If you do not have an attorney, and at any time 
you feel pressured or intimidated, you can stop 
talking to the attorney and wait to be called by 
the housing mediator.

If you and the other parties in your case can 
agree, either with the help of the housing 
mediator or by talking to each other, you will 
be asked if you understand and are willing to 
agree to the terms of the agreement. This is 
called a “canvass”, and is done by the judge, 
the housing mediator, or the clerk. The judge 
will then enter an order in your case, which is 
called a stipulated judgment. Once the judge 
enters the stipulated judgment, everyone has 
to follow the terms of the agreement, just like a 
judgment after a trial.

What happens if I do not make  
an agreement?

If you do not make an agreement, your case 
will be decided by the judge. Both you and the 
other party may present your witnesses and tell 
the court your story.

Be ready to give a short summary of your side 
of the case to the judge. Bring to court with you 
any papers or pictures that support your case. 
Also, if you have witnesses, bring them with 
you in the event you have a trial. You should 
have specific questions for your witnesses.
