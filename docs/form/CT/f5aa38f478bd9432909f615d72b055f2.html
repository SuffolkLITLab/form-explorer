Foreword

The Connecticut Code of Evidence was adopted by the judges of the Superior Court on
June 28, 1999, to be effective January 1, 2000. The adoption of the Code signified the
culmination of work that had been in progress since 1993 when Supreme Court Justice David
M. Borden was asked to chair a committee of the Connecticut Law Revision Commission
charged with drafting a proposed code of evidence for Connecticut. The members of this
drafting committee included: Professor Colin C. Tait of the University of Connecticut School
of Law; Supreme Court Justice Joette Katz; Appellate Court Judge Paul M. Foti; Superior
Court Judges Julia L. Aurigemma, Samuel Freed and Joseph Q. Koletsky; Attorneys Robert
B. Adelman, Jeffrey Apuzzo, Joseph G. Bruckmann, William Dow III, David Elliot, Susann E.
Gill, Donald R. Holtman, Houston Putnam Lowry, Jane S. Scholl, and Eric W. Wiechmann;
Law Revision Commission members Jon P. FitzGerald, Representative Arthur J. O’Neill,
Superior Court Judge Elliot N. Solomon, and Senator Thomas F. Upson; and Law Revision
Commission Senior Attorney Jo A. Roberts and Staff Attorney Eric M. Levine.

The drafting committee completed its work in September, 1997. After receiving public
comment, the drafting committee submitted its work product to the full Law Revision Commis-
sion, which voted to adopt the proposed code and commentary in December, 1997. Thereafter,
the proposed code and commentary were submitted to the Judiciary Committee of the General
Assembly for consideration during the 1998 legislative session. Before commencement of
the session, however, certain members of the General Assembly had suggested that, for
various reasons, a code of evidence should be adopted, if at all, by the judges of the Superior
Court pursuant to their rule-making authority rather than by legislation. Thus, the Judiciary
Committee urged then Supreme Court Chief Justice Robert J. Callahan to have the judges
of the Superior Court consider adopting the proposed code as rules of court.

In response, Chief Justice Callahan appointed a committee to consider and review the
proposed code and its commentary for adoption by the judges of the Superior Court. This
committee was chaired by Justice Katz and included Appellate Court Judge Barry R. Schaller,
Superior Court Judges Aurigemma, Thomas A. Bishop, Thomas J. Corradino, Freed, John
F. Kavanewsky, Jr., Koletsky, and William B. Rush, Professor Tait, and Attorneys Roberts
and Levine. This committee reviewed the proposed code and commentary from June, 1998,
until September, 1998, made changes to various parts thereof and then submitted its final work
product to the Rules Committee for approval. The Rules Committee unanimously approved
the proposed code and commentary. Thereafter, the proposed code and commentary were
subject to a public hearing in June, 1999, and finally were adopted by the judges on June
28, 1999.

An oversight committee was created by the judges of the Superior Court when they adopted
the Code, for the purpose of monitoring the development of the Code and making recommenda-
tions for future revision and clarification. The membership of the committee included: Justice
Katz (chair), Superior Court Judges Bishop, Corradino, Beverly J. Hodgson, Kavanewsky,
Koletsky, and Michael R. Sheldon, Attorneys Adelman, Bruckmann, Gill, Jack G. Steigelfest,
Wiechmann, and Levine (liaison, Office of the Reporter of Judicial Decisions), and Professor
Tait. The oversight committee convened in October, 1999, and recommended minor changes
to the Code and commentary based primarily on recent developments in the law. Those
recommended changes were approved by the Rules Committee, then by the judges of the
Superior Court, and were reflected in periodic amendments to the Code and commentary.

In 2008, the Connecticut Supreme Court issued its decision in State v. DeJesus, 288 Conn.
418, 953 A.2d 45 (2008), in which the court asserted its common-law supervisory authority
to fashion a rule of evidence contrary to an applicable provision of the Code. In DeJesus,
the court also clarified that the judges of the Superior Court, in their rule-making authority
over the Code, do not have the ability to enact rules contrary to Supreme Court precedent.
Following DeJesus, and Justice Katz’ resignation from the oversight committee, Judge Bishop,
then of the Appellate Court, was appointed to chair the committee. Pursuant to the holding
of DeJesus, the committee recommended changes to Section 4-5, regarding the admission
of evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts. The committee also recommended an addition
to Section 8-10, regarding hearsay, to harmonize the Code with legislation enacted by the
General Assembly, permitting certain evidence from an alleged victim, twelve years or younger,
of sexual assault or other sexual misconduct. Both of these recommendations were approved
by the Rules Committee and the judges of the Superior Court and became part of the Code.

In 2014, pursuant to a proposal from the Judicial Branch, the General Assembly enacted
No. 14-120 of the 2014 Public Acts (P.A. 14-120), which authorized the Supreme Court to
adopt the Code. This legislation, codified at General Statutes § 51-14a, also provides that, if
the Supreme Court does, in fact, adopt the Code, the Chief Justice shall appoint a standing
advisory committee of judges and lawyers to study the field of evidence law and periodically
make recommendations to the Supreme Court regarding any proposed amendments. Addition-
ally, the legislation includes a provision requiring the advisory committee to make periodic
reports on its activities to the Judiciary Committee. Finally, the legislation contains a provision
making it clear that, notwithstanding this evidence rule-making authority, the Supreme Court
retains its common-law authority over the law of evidence, and the General Assembly retains
its legislative authority, as well.

Following the passage of P.A. 14-120, the Supreme Court adopted the Code on June 18,
2014, and, shortly thereafter, the following judges and lawyers were appointed to its Code
of Evidence Oversight Committee: Judge Bishop, Chair; Appellate Court Judges Eliot D.
Prescott and Sheldon; Superior Court Judges Thomas D. Colin, Steven D. Ecker, Barbara
B. Jongbloed, and Angela C. Robinson; and Attorneys Adelman, Leonard C. Boyle, Brian S.
Carlow, John R. Gulash, Kimberly P. Massicotte, Steigelfest, Lawrence J. Tytla, and Wiech-
mann. Additionally, Professor Julia Simon-Kerr agreed to serve as academic advisor to the
committee in place of Professor Tait, who had retired, Attorney Levine served as liaison to
the Office of the Reporter of Judicial Decisions, and Attorney Lori Petruzzelli of the Legal
Services Division of the Judicial Branch was appointed to serve as counsel to the committee.

During the fall and winter of 2014–2015, the committee studied whether to recommend
amendments to the Code and its commentary regarding computer related evidence. Following
the committee’s recommendations to the Supreme Court and a period for public comment,
the Supreme Court adopted the committee’s recommendations on May 20, 2015. As an
ongoing function, the committee continues to study the Code and the field of evidence to
determine whether to make recommendations to the Supreme Court for any changes or
additions to the Code.

Since the publication of the 2018 edition of the Evidence Code, Supreme Court Justice
Raheem L. Mullins was appointed as chairperson of the Code of Evidence Oversight Commit-
tee of the Supreme Court, and, between 2018 and 2022, committee members included
Supreme Court Justice Ecker, Appellate Court Judges Prescott and Sheldon, Superior Court

Judges Karen A. Goodrow, Jongbloed, Massicotte, and Lisa K. Morgan, and Attorneys Adel-
man, Bruckmann, Timothy F. Costello, Michael Gailor, Gulash, Steigelfest, Tytla and Wiechmann.
Additionally, Professor Simon-Kerr and Attorneys Levine and Petruzzelli continued to serve
in their respective roles.

Between 2018 and 2021, the committee conducted studies concerning, among other topics,
the authentication of business records and public records by certification. In 2021, the commit-
tee submitted recommendations to the Supreme Court regarding the amendment of sections
1-1 and 1-3 and the accompanying commentary, a technical amendment to the title of section
4-11, amendments to the commentary to sections 9-1 and 9-3, and the adoption of new
sections, namely, 4-12, incorporating portions of General Statutes § 52-180c, and 9-3A,
relating to the authentication of business entries by certification. Following a period of public
comment, the Supreme Court adopted the committee’s recommendations on March 29, 2022.

Sec. 1-1. Short Title; Application

(a) Short title. These rules shall be known and
may be cited as the Code of Evidence. The Code
of Evidence is hereinafter referred to as the
‘‘Code.’’

(b) Application of the Code. The Code and
the commentary apply to all proceedings in the

except as otherwise provided by the Code, the
General Statutes or any Practice Book rule
adopted before June 18, 2014, the date on which
the Supreme Court adopted the Code.

(c) Rules of privilege. Privileges shall apply at

all stages of all proceedings in the court.

(d) The Code inapplicable. The Code, other
than with respect to privileges, does not apply in
proceedings such as, but not limited to, the fol-
lowing:

(1) Proceedings before investigatory grand
juries, as provided for in General Statutes §§ 54-
47b through 54-47f.

(2) Proceedings involving questions of fact pre-
liminary to the determination of the admissibility
of evidence as provided in Section 1-3 (a) of
the Code.

(3) Proceedings involving sentencing.
(4) Proceedings involving probation.
(5) Proceedings involving small claims matters.
(6) Proceedings involving summary contempt.

ute or decisional law that the rules of evidence
do not apply.

(Amended Dec. 14, 2017, to take effect Feb. 1, 2018;

amended March 29, 2022, to take effect June 13, 2022.)

COMMENTARY

(b) Application of the Code.
When the Code was initially adopted by the judges of the
Superior Court in 1999 and then readopted by the Supreme
Court in 2014, the adoption included both the rules and the
commentary, thereby making both equally applicable. See
State v. Pierre, 277 Conn. 42, 60, 890 A.2d 474, cert. denied,
547 U.S. 1197, 126 S. Ct. 2873, 165 L. Ed. 2d 904 (2006).
The Code is broadly applicable. The Code applies to all civil
and criminal bench or jury trials in the Superior Court. The
Probate Assembly adopted Probate Rule 62.1, effective July
1, 2013, making the Code applicable to all issues in which

facts are in dispute. The Code applies, for example, to the
following proceedings:

(1) court-ordered fact-finding proceedings conducted pursu-
ant to General Statutes § 52-549n and Practice Book § 23-
53; see General Statutes § 52-549r;

(2) probable cause hearings conducted pursuant to General
Statutes § 54-46a, excepting certain matters exempted under
General Statutes § 54-46a (b); see State v. Conn, 234 Conn.
97, 110, 662 A.2d 68 (1995); In re Ralph M., 211 Conn. 289,
305–306, 559 A.2d 179 (1989);

(3) juvenile transfer hearings conducted pursuant to General
Statutes § 46b-127 as provided in subsection (b) of that provi-
sion; In re Michael B., 36 Conn. App. 364, 381, 650 A.2d 1251
(1994); In re Jose M., 30 Conn. App. 381, 384–85, 620 A.2d
804, cert. denied, 225 Conn. 921, 625 A.2d 821 (1993);

(4) juvenile proceedings; however, adoption of subsection
(b) is not intended to abrogate the well established rule that
the court may relax its strict application of the formal rules of
evidence to reflect the informal nature of juvenile proceedings
provided the fundamental rights of the parties are preserved;
In re Juvenile Appeal (85-2), 3 Conn. App. 184, 190, 485 A.2d
1362 (1986); see Anonymous v. Norton, 168 Conn. 421, 425,
362 A.2d 532, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 925, 96 S. Ct. 294, 46
L. Ed. 2d 268 (1975); Practice Book § 32a-2 (a); and

(5) proceedings involving family relations matters enumer-

ated under General Statutes § 46b-1.

The Code is not intended to apply to matters to which the
technical rules of evidence traditionally have not applied. Thus,
for example, the Code would be inapplicable to hearings on
the issuance of bench warrants of arrest or search warrants
conducted pursuant to General Statutes §§ 54-2a and 54-33a,
respectively; see State v. DeNegris, 153 Conn. 5, 9, 212 A.2d
894 (1965); State v. Caponigro, 4 Conn. Cir. Ct. 603, 609,
238 A.2d 434 (1967).

Matters to which the Code specifically is inapplicable are

set forth in subsection (d).
(c) Rules of privilege.
Subsection (c) addresses the recognition of evidentiary privi-
leges only with respect to proceedings in the court. See Article
V—Privileges. It does not address the recognition of eviden-
tiary privileges in any other proceedings outside the court,
whether legislative, administrative or quasi-judicial, in which
testimony may be compelled.
(d) The Code inapplicable.
Subsection (d) specifically states the proceedings to which
the Code, other than with respect to evidentiary privileges, is
inapplicable. The list is intended to be illustrative rather than
exhaustive, and subsection (d) should be read in conjunction
with subsection (b) in determining the applicability or inapplica-
bility of the Code. The removal of these matters from the
purview of the Code generally is supported by case law, the
General Statutes or the Practice Book. They include:

(1) proceedings before investigatory grand juries; e.g., State
v. Avcollie, 188 Conn. 626, 630–31, 453 A.2d 418 (1982),

Sec. 1-1

Connecticut Code of Evidence

cert. denied, 461 U.S. 928, 103 S. Ct. 2088, 77 L. Ed. 2d
299 (1983);

(2) preliminary determinations of questions of fact by the
court made pursuant to Section 1-3 (a); although there is no
Connecticut authority specifically stating this inapplicability, it
is generally the prevailing view. E.g., Fed. R. Evid. 104 (a);
Unif. R. Evid. 104 (a), 13A U.L.A. 16–17 (1999);

(3) sentencing proceedings following trial; e.g., State v.
Huey, 199 Conn. 121, 126, 505 A.2d 1242 (1986); see also
State v. Pena, 301 Conn. 669, 680–83, 22 A.3d 611 (2011)
(in sentencing, trial court may rely on evidence bearing on
crimes of which defendant was acquitted). The Code, however,
does apply to sentencing proceedings that constitutionally
require that a certain fact be found by the trier of fact beyond
a reasonable doubt before the defendant is deemed eligible
for a particular sentence. See, e.g., Apprendi v. New Jersey,
530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000)
(‘‘[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that
increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statu-
tory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond
a reasonable doubt’’); Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U.S. 430,
446, 101 S. Ct. 1852, 68 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1981) (‘‘many of the
protections available to a defendant at a criminal trial also are
available at a sentencing hearing . . . in a capital case’’);

(4) hearings involving the violation of probation conducted
pursuant to General Statutes § 53a-32 (a); State v. White, 169
Conn. 223, 239–40, 363 A.2d 143, cert. denied, 423 U.S.
1025, 96 S. Ct. 469, 46 L. Ed. 2d 399 (1975); In re Marius
M., 34 Conn. App. 535, 536, 642 A.2d 733 (1994);

(5) proceedings involving small claims matters; General

Statutes § 52-549c (a); see Practice Book § 24-23;

(6) summary contempt proceedings; see generally Practice

Book § 1-16; and

(7) certain criminal pretrial proceedings; see, e.g., State v.
Fernando A., 294 Conn. 1, 26–30, 981 A.2d 427 (2009); see
also General Statutes § 54-64f (b) (hearing on revocation of
release).

Nothing in subsection (d) (2) abrogates the common-law
rule that in determining preliminary questions of fact upon
which the application of certain exceptions to the hearsay rule
depends, the court may not consider the declarant’s out-of-
court statements themselves in determining those preliminary
questions. E.g., State v. Vessichio, 197 Conn. 644, 655, 500
A.2d 1311 (1985) (court may not consider coconspirator state-
ments in determining preliminary questions of fact relating to
admissibility of those statements under coconspirator state-
ment exception to hearsay rule; see Section 8-3 (1) (E)), cert.
denied, 475 U.S. 1122, 106 S. Ct. 1642, 90 L. Ed. 2d 187
(1986); Robles v. Lavin, 176 Conn. 281, 284, 407 A.2d 958
(1978) (in determining whether authorized admissions against
party opponent exception to hearsay rule applies, authority to
speak must be established before alleged agent’s declarations
can be introduced; see Section 8-3 (1) (C)); Ferguson v.
Smazer, 151 Conn. 226, 231, 196 A.2d 432 (1963) (in
determining whether hearsay exception for statements of pedi-
gree and family relationships applies, declarant’s relationship
to person to whom statement relates must be established
without reference to declarant’s statements; see Section 8-
6 (7)).

Sec. 1-2. Purposes and Construction

(a) Purposes of the Code. The purposes of the
Code are to adopt Connecticut case law regarding
rules of evidence as rules of court and to promote
the growth and development of the law of evi-
the Code and
dence through interpretation of

through judicial rule making to the end that the
truth may be ascertained and proceedings justly
determined.

(b) Saving clause. Where the Code does not
prescribe a rule governing the admissibility of evi-
dence, the court shall be governed by the princi-
the common law as they may be
ples of
interpreted in the light of reason and experience,
except as otherwise required by the constitution
of the United States, the constitution of this state,
the General Statutes or the Practice Book. The
provisions of the Code shall not be construed as
precluding any court from recognizing other evi-
dentiary rules not
inconsistent with such pro-
visions.

(c) Writing. Any reference in the Code to a
writing or any other medium of evidence includes
electronically stored information.

(Amended May 20, 2015, to take effect Aug. 1, 2015.)

COMMENTARY

(a) Purposes of the Code.
Subsection (a) provides a general statement of the purposes
of the Code. Case-by-case adjudication is integral to the
growth and development of evidentiary law and, thus, future
definition of the Code will be effected primarily through inter-
pretation of the Code and through judicial rule making.

One of the goals of drafting the Code was to place common-
law rules of evidence and certain identified statutory rules of
evidence into a readily accessible body of rules to which the
legal profession conveniently may refer. The Code sometimes
states common-law evidentiary principles in language different
the cases from which these principles were
from that of
derived. Because the Code was intended to maintain the status
quo, i.e., preserve the common-law rules of evidence as they
existed prior to adoption of the Code, its adoption is not
intended to modify any prior common-law interpretation of
those rules. Nor is the Code intended to change the common-
law interpretation of certain incorporated statutory rules of
evidence as it existed prior to the Code’s adoption.

In some instances, the Code embraces rules or principles
for which no Connecticut case law presently exists, or for
which the case law is indeterminate. In such instances, these
rules or principles were formulated with due consideration of
the recognized practice in Connecticut courts and the policies
underlying existing common law, statutes and the Practice
Book.

Although the Code follows the general format and some-
times the language of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the
Code does not adopt the Federal Rules of Evidence or cases
interpreting those rules. Cf. State v. Vilalastra, 207 Conn.
35, 39–40, 540 A.2d 42 (1988) (Federal Rules of Evidence
influential
in shaping Connecticut evidentiary rules, but not
binding).

Unlike the Federal Rules of Evidence, which govern both
the admissibility of evidence at trial and issues concerning the
court’s role in administering and controlling the trial process,
the Code was developed with the intention that
it would
address issues concerning the admissibility of evidence and
competency of witnesses, leaving trial management issues to
common law, the Practice Book and the discretion of the court.

(b) Saving clause.
Subsection (b) addresses the situation in which courts are
faced with evidentiary issues not expressly covered by the

Connecticut Code of Evidence

Code. Although the Code will address most evidentiary mat-
ters, it cannot possibly address every evidentiary issue that
might arise during trial. Subsection (b) sets forth the standard
by which courts are to be guided in such instances.

Precisely because it cannot address every evidentiary issue,
the Code is not intended to be the exclusive set of rules
governing the admissibility of evidence. Thus, subsection (b)
makes clear that a court is not precluded from recognizing
other evidentiary rules not inconsistent with the Code’s pro-
visions.

(c) Writing.
The rules and principles in the Code are intended to govern
evidence in any form or medium, including, without limitation,
written and printed material, photographs, video and sound
recordings, and electronically stored information. As a result
of advances in technology, the widespread availability and
use of electronic devices for storage and communication, and
the proliferation of social media, courts are frequently called
upon to rule on the admissibility of electronically stored infor-
mation. That term, as used in the Code, refers to information
that is stored in an electronic medium and is retrievable in
perceivable form. See Practice Book § 13-1 (a) (5).

Sec. 1-3. Preliminary Questions

(a) Questions of admissibility generally.
Preliminary questions concerning the qualification
or competence of a person to be a witness, the
existence of a privilege or the admissibility of evi-
dence shall be determined by the court.

(b) Relevance conditioned on fact. If the rele-
vance of evidence depends upon whether a fact
exists, evidence must be admitted sufficient to
support a finding that the fact does exist. The
court may admit the proffered evidence on the
condition that the connecting evidence be intro-
duced subsequently.

(Amended March 29, 2022, to take effect June 13, 2022.)

COMMENTARY

(a) Questions of admissibility generally.
The admissibility of evidence, qualification of a witness and
applicability of a privilege are preliminary questions to be deter-
mined by the court. Often, such a determination is dependent
upon the existence of foundational facts. Was the declarant’s
statement made under the stress of excitement? Is the alleged
expert a qualified social worker? Was a third party present
during a conversation between husband and wife? In each of
these examples, the court’s determination will turn upon the
answer to these foundational questions of
In most
instances, subsection (a) makes it the responsibility of the
court to find these preliminary facts. See, e.g., State v. Stange,
212 Conn. 612, 617, 563 A.2d 681 (1989); Manning v. Michael,
188 Conn. 607, 610, 453 A.2d 1157 (1982); D’Amato v. John-
ston, 140 Conn. 54, 61–62, 97 A.2d 893 (1953).

fact.

Pursuant to Section 1-1 (d) (2), courts are not bound by the
Code in determining most preliminary questions of fact under
subsection (a). Accordingly, in finding these facts, the court
may consider nonprivileged evidence that would otherwise be
inadmissible under the Code. In such instances, the court acts
as the fact finder in determining whether the foundational facts
exist by a fair preponderance of the evidence. The court may
assess the credibility of the foundational evidence, including
any testimony offered by the proponent of the evidence.

The Code does apply, however, to factual determinations
regarding the existence of an evidentiary privilege; see Section

1-1 (d); and to questions of conditional relevance, including
whether evidence has been sufficiently authenticated. See
Section 1-3 (b).

(b) Relevance conditioned on fact.
Frequently, the relevance of a particular fact or item of evi-
dence depends upon evidence of another fact or other facts,
i.e., connecting facts. For example, the relevance of a witness’
testimony that the witness observed a truck swerving in and
out of the designated lane at a given point depends upon other
testimony identifying the truck the witness observed as the
defendant’s. Similarly, the probative value of evidence that A
warned B that the machine B was using had a tendency to
vibrate depends upon other evidence establishing that B actu-
ally heard the warning. When the relevance of evidence
depends upon evidence of connecting facts, subsection (b)
authorizes the court to admit the evidence upon admission
of the connecting facts or subject to later admission of the
connecting facts. See, e.g., State v. Anonymous (83-FG), 190
Conn. 715, 724–25, 463 A.2d 533 (1983); Steiber v. Bridge-
port, 145 Conn. 363, 366–67, 143 A.2d 434 (1958).

If the proponent fails to introduce evidence sufficient to sup-
port a finding of the connecting facts, the court may instruct
the jury to disregard the evidence or order the earlier testimony
stricken. State v. Ferraro, 160 Conn. 42, 45, 273 A.2d 694
(1970); State v. Johnson, 160 Conn. 28, 32–33, 273 A.2d
702 (1970).

The authentication of evidence is another example of an
instance in which the relevance of evidence to the case
depends upon the existence of another fact or other facts.
Evidence can be relevant for the purpose for which it is being
offered only if it is what the proponent claims it to be. As a
preliminary matter, the court must decide whether the propo-
nent has offered a satisfactory foundation from which the finder
of fact could reasonably determine that the evidence is what
it purports to be. The court makes this preliminary determina-
tion in light of the authentication requirements of Article IX. In
conducting its preliminary inquiry, the court does not assess
the credibility of the evidence proffered in support of authenti-
cation but simply determines whether the evidence, if credited,
is sufficient to support a finding that the proffered evidence is
what the proponent claims it to be. State v. Porfil, 191 Conn.
App. 494, 519–21, 215 A.3d 161 (2019), appeal dismissed,
338 Conn. 792, 259 A.3d 1127 (2021). If the court determines
that a prima facie showing of authenticity has been made, the
evidence, if otherwise admissible, goes to the fact finder. It
is for the fact finder ultimately to decide whether evidence
submitted for its consideration is what the proponent claims
it to be. See, e.g., State v. Carpenter, 275 Conn. 785, 856,
882 A.2d 604 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1025, 126 S. Ct.
1578, 164 L. Ed. 2d 309 (2006); State v. Colon, 272 Conn.
106, 188–89, 864 A.2d 666 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S.
848, 126 S. Ct. 102, 163 L. Ed. 2d 116 (2005); State v. Shah,
134 Conn. App. 581, 593, 39 A.3d 1165 (2012); see also
Section 9-1, commentary.

The Code applies in making determinations required by

Section 1-3 (b).

Sec. 1-4. Limited Admissibility

Evidence that is admissible as to one party but
not as to another, or for one purpose but not for
another, is admissible as to that party or for that
purpose. The court may, and upon request shall,
restrict the evidence to its proper scope.

COMMENTARY
Section 1-4 is consistent with Connecticut law. See Blanch-
ard v. Bridgeport, 190 Conn. 798, 805, 463 A.2d 553 (1983);
State v. Tryon, 145 Conn. 304, 309, 142 A.2d 54 (1958).

Sec. 1-4

Connecticut Code of Evidence

Absent a party’s request for a limiting instruction, upon the
admission of evidence, the court is encouraged to instruct the
jury on the proper scope of the evidence or inquire whether
counsel desires a limiting instruction to be given. See Rokus
v. Bridgeport, 191 Conn. 62, 67, 463 A.2d 252 (1983); cf.
State v. Cox, 7 Conn. App. 377, 389, 509 A.2d 36 (1986).
Nothing precludes a court from excluding evidence offered for
a limited purpose or taking other action it deems appropriate
when a limiting instruction will not adequately protect the rights
of
the parties. See Blanchard v. Bridgeport, supra, 190
Conn. 805.

Sec. 1-5. Remainder of Statements

(a) Contemporaneous introduction by pro-
ponent. When a statement is introduced by a
party, the court may, and upon request shall,
require the proponent at that time to introduce
any other part of the statement, whether or not
otherwise admissible, that the court determines,
considering the context of the first part of the state-
ment, ought in fairness to be considered contem-
poraneously with it.

(b) Introduction by another party. When a
statement is introduced by a party, another party
may introduce any other part of the statement,
whether or not otherwise admissible, that the court
determines, considering the context of the first
part of the statement, ought in fairness to be con-
sidered with it.

COMMENTARY

(a) Contemporaneous introduction by proponent.
Subsection (a) recognizes the principle of completeness.
Sometimes, one part of a statement may be so related to
another that, in fairness, both should be considered contempo-
raneously. Subsection (a) details the circumstances under
which a court may or shall require a proponent of one part of

a statement to contemporaneously introduce the other part.
See Clark v. Smith, 10 Conn. 1, 5 (1833); Ives v. Bartholomew,
9 Conn. 309, 312–13 (1832); see also Practice Book § 13-31
(a) (5) (depositions); cf. Walter v. Sperry, 86 Conn. 474, 480,
85 A. 739 (1912).

The basis for the rule is that matters taken out of context
can create misleading impressions or inaccuracies and that
waiting until later in the trial to clear them up can be ineffectual.
See, e.g., State v. Arthur S., 109 Conn. App. 135, 140–41, 950
A.2d 615, cert. denied, 289 Conn. 925, 958 A.2d 153 (2008).
‘‘Statement,’’ as used in this subsection, includes written,
recorded and oral statements. Because the other part of the
statement is introduced for the purpose of placing the first
part into context, the other part need not be independently
admissible. See State v. Tropiano, 158 Conn. 412, 420, 262
A.2d 147 (1969), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 949, 90 S. Ct. 1866,
26 L. Ed. 2d 288 (1970).

(b) Introduction by another party.
Unlike subsection (a), subsection (b) does not involve the
contemporaneous introduction of evidence. Rather, it recog-
nizes the right of a party to subsequently introduce another
part or the remainder of a statement previously introduced in
part by the opposing party under the conditions prescribed in
the rule. See State v. Paulino, 223 Conn. 461, 468–69, 613
A.2d 720 (1992); State v. Castonguay, 218 Conn. 486, 496–97,
590 A.2d 901 (1991); Rokus v. Bridgeport, 191 Conn. 62, 69,
463 A.2d 252 (1983); see also Practice Book § 13-31 (a)
(5) (depositions).

Although the cases upon which subsection (b) is based deal
only with the admissibility of oral conversations or statements,
the rule logically extends to written and recorded statements.
Thus, like subsection (a), subsection (b)’s use of the word
‘‘statement’’ includes oral, written and recorded statements. In
addition, because the other part of the statement is introduced
under subsection (b) for the purpose of putting the first part
into context, the other part need not be independently admissi-
ble. See State v. Paulino, supra, 223 Conn. 468–69; State v.
Castonguay, supra, 218 Conn. 496; cf. Starzec v. Kida, 183
Conn. 41, 47 n.6, 438 A.2d 1157 (1981).

is not required to, take notice of matters of fact,
in accordance with subsection (c).

(c) Kinds of facts. A judicially noticed fact must

erally in the ordinary course of human experience,
or (2) generally accepted as true and capable of
ready and unquestionable demonstration.

(d) Time of taking judicial notice. Judicial
notice may be taken at any stage of the pro-
ceeding.

(Amended June 29, 2007, to take effect Jan. 1, 2008.)

COMMENTARY

(a) Scope of section.
Section 2-1 addresses the principle of judicial notice, which
relieves a party from producing formal evidence to prove a
fact. E.g., Beardsley v. Irving, 81 Conn. 489, 491, 71 A. 580
(1909); Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Napert-Boyer Partner-
ship, 40 Conn. App. 434, 441, 671 A.2d 1303 (1996). Section
2-1 deals only with judicial notice of ‘‘adjudicative’’ facts. Adju-
dicative facts are the facts of a particular case or those facts
that relate to the activities or events giving rise to the particular
controversy. See Moore v. Moore, 173 Conn. 120, 122, 376
A.2d 1085 (1977); K. Davis, ‘‘Judicial Notice,’’ 55 Colum. L.
Rev. 945, 952 (1955).

This section does not deal with judicial notice of ‘‘legislative’’
facts, i.e., facts that do not necessarily concern the parties in
a particular case but that courts consider in determining the
constitutionality or interpretation of statutes or issues of public
policy upon which the application of a common-law rule
depends. See Moore v. Moore, supra, 173 Conn. 122; K.
Davis, supra, 55 Colum. L. Rev. 952. The Code leaves judicial
notice of legislative facts to common law.

(b) Taking of judicial notice.
Subsection (b) expresses the common-law view that
‘‘[c]ourts are not bound to take judicial notice of matters of
fact.’’ DeLuca v. Park Commissioners, 94 Conn. 7, 10, 107
A. 611 (1919).

(c) Kinds of facts.
Subsection (c) is consistent with common-law principles of
judicial notice. See, e.g., West Hartford v. Freedom of Informa-
tion Commission, 218 Conn. 256, 264, 588 A.2d 1368 (1991);
State v. Tomanelli, 153 Conn. 365, 369, 216 A.2d 625 (1966).
Both the fact that raw pork must be cooked thoroughly to
kill parasites; see Silverman v. Swift & Co., 141 Conn. 450,
458, 107 A.2d 277 (1954); and the fact that the normal period
of human gestation is nine months; Melanson v. Rogers, 38
Conn. Supp. 484, 490–91, 451 A.2d 825 (1982); constitute
examples of facts subject to judicial notice under category

(1). Examples of category (2) facts include: scientific tests
or principles; State v. Tomanelli, supra, 153 Conn. 370–71;
geographical data; e.g., Nesko Corp. v. Fontaine, 19 Conn.
Supp. 160, 162, 110 A.2d 631 (1954); historical facts; Gannon
v. Gannon, 130 Conn. 449, 452, 35 A.2d 204 (1943); and
times and dates. E.g., Patterson v. Dempsey, 152 Conn. 431,
435, 207 A.2d 739 (1965).

Within category (2), the court may take judicial notice of the
existence, content and legal effect of a court file, or of a specific
entry in a court file if that specific entry is brought to the
attention of the court, subject to the provisions of Section 2-
2. Judicial notice of a court file or a specific entry in a court
file does not establish the truth of any fact stated in that court
file. The rules governing hearsay and its exceptions determine
the admissibility of court records for the truth of their content.
See Fox v. Schaeffer, 131 Conn. 439, 447, 41 A.2d 46 (1944);
see also O’Connor v. Larocque, 302 Conn. 562, 568 n.6, 31
A.3d 1 (2011).

Although a judicially noticed fact is one not subject to reason-
able dispute, the trier of fact in a criminal case is not required
to accept the fact as conclusive. See State v. Tomanelli, supra,
153 Conn. 369; see also Fed. R. Evid. 201 (f). Other parties
may offer evidence in disproof of a fact judicially noticed in a
criminal case. See State v. Tomanelli, supra, 369. In a civil
case, the jury must accept the noticed fact as conclusive. See
Fed. R. Evid. 201 (f). The effect of this rule is to reject dictum
to the contrary found in Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Napert-
Boyer Partnership, supra, 40 Conn. App. 441, and to bring
the rule into harmony with the Federal Rules of Evidence and
the Connecticut civil jury instructions.
(d) Time of taking judicial notice.
Subsection (d) adheres to common-law principles. Drabik
v. East Lyme, 234 Conn. 390, 398, 662 A.2d 118 (1995); State
v. Allen, 205 Conn. 370, 382, 533 A.2d 559 (1987). The Code
does not govern the taking of judicial notice on appeal.

Sec. 2-2. Notice and Opportunity To Be

Heard
(a) Request of party. A party requesting the
court to take judicial notice of a fact shall give
timely notice of the request to all other parties.
Before the court determines whether to take the
requested judicial notice, any party shall have an
opportunity to be heard.

(b) Court’s initiative. The court may take judi-
cial notice without a request of a party to do so.
Parties are entitled to receive notice and have an
opportunity to be heard for matters susceptible of
explanation or contradiction, but not for matters
of established fact, the accuracy of which cannot
be questioned.

Sec. 4-1. Definition of Relevant Evidence

‘‘Relevant evidence’’ means evidence having
any tendency to make the existence of any fact
that is material to the determination of the pro-
ceeding more probable or less probable than it
would be without the evidence.

COMMENTARY
Section 4-1 embodies the two separate components of rele-
vant evidence recognized at common law: (1) probative value;
and (2) materiality. State v. Jeffrey, 220 Conn. 698, 709, 601
A.2d 993 (1991); State v. Dabkowski, 199 Conn. 193, 206,
506 A.2d 118 (1986).

Section 4-1 incorporates the requirement of probative value
by providing that the proffered evidence must tend ‘‘to make
the existence of any fact
. . . more probable or less probable
than it would be without the evidence.’’ See, e.g., State v.
Prioleau, 235 Conn. 274, 305, 664 A.2d 793 (1995); State v.
Briggs, 179 Conn. 328, 332, 426 A.2d 298 (1979), cert. denied,
447 U.S. 912, 100 S. Ct. 3000, 64 L. Ed. 2d 862 (1980).
Section 4-1’s ‘‘more probable or less probable than it would be
without the evidence’’ standard of probative worth is consistent
with Connecticut law. See, e.g., State v. Rinaldi, 220 Conn.
345, 353, 599 A.2d 1 (1991) (‘‘[t]o be relevant, the evidence
need not exclude all other possibilities; it is sufficient if it tends
to support the conclusion, even to a slight degree’’ (emphasis
added)); State v. Miller, 202 Conn. 463, 482, 522 A.2d 249
(1987) (‘‘[e]vidence is not inadmissible because it is not conclu-
sive; it is admissible if it has a tendency to support a fact
relevant to the issues if only in a slight degree’’ (emphasis
added)). Thus, it is not necessary that the evidence, by itself,
conclusively establish the fact for which it is offered or render
the fact more probable than not.

Section 4-1 expressly requires materiality as a condition to
relevancy in providing that the factual proposition for which
the evidence is offered must be ‘‘material to the determination
of the proceeding . . . .’’ See State v. Marra, 222 Conn. 506,
521, 610 A.2d 1113 (1992); State v. Corchado, 188 Conn.
653, 668, 453 A.2d 427 (1982). The materiality of evidence
turns upon what is at issue in the case, which generally will
be determined by the pleadings and the applicable substantive
law. See Williams Ford, Inc. v. Hartford Courant Co., 232
Conn. 559, 570, 657 A.2d 212 (1995).

Sec. 4-2. Relevant

Evidence
Irrelevant Evidence

Generally
Inad-

Admissible;
missible
All relevant evidence is admissible, except as
the

otherwise provided by the constitution of

United States, the constitution of the state of Con-
necticut, the Code, the General Statutes or the
common law. Evidence that is not relevant is inad-
missible.

(Amended Dec. 14, 2017, to take effect Feb. 1, 2018.)

COMMENTARY
Section 4-2 recognizes two fundamental common-law prin-
ciples: (1) all relevant evidence is admissible unless otherwise
excluded; e.g., Delmore v. Polinsky, 132 Conn. 28, 31, 42
A.2d 349 (1945); see Federated Dept. Stores, Inc. v. Board
of Tax Review, 162 Conn. 77, 82–83, 291 A.2d 715 (1971);
and (2) irrelevant evidence is inadmissible. Williams Ford, Inc.
v. Hartford Courant Co., 232 Conn. 559, 569, 657 A.2d 212
(1995); see State v. Mastropetre, 175 Conn. 512, 521, 400
A.2d 276 (1978).

Reference in Section 4-2 to the federal and state constitu-
tions includes judicially created remedies designed to preserve
constitutional rights, such as the exclusionary rule. See State v.
Marsala, 216 Conn. 150, 161, 579 A.2d 58 (1990) (construing
exclusionary rule under Connecticut constitution).

Sec. 4-3. Exclusion of Evidence on Grounds
of Prejudice, Confusion or Waste of Time
Relevant evidence may be excluded if its proba-
tive value is outweighed by the danger of unfair
prejudice or surprise, confusion of the issues, or
misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue
delay, waste of time or needless presentation of
cumulative evidence.

COMMENTARY
Section 4-3 establishes a balancing test under which the
probative value of proffered evidence is weighed against the
harm likely to result from its admission. See, e.g., State v.
Rinaldi, 220 Conn. 345, 356, 599 A.2d 1 (1991); Farrell v. St.
Vincent’s Hospital, 203 Conn. 554, 563, 525 A.2d 954 (1987);
State v. DeMatteo, 186 Conn. 696, 702–703, 443 A.2d 915
(1982). The task of striking this balance is relegated to the
court’s discretion. E.g., State v. Paulino, 223 Conn. 461, 477,
613 A.2d 720 (1992).

The discretion of a trial court to exclude relevant evidence
on the basis of unfair prejudice is well established. E.g., State
v. Higgins, 201 Conn. 462, 469, 518 A.2d 631 (1986). All
evidence adverse to an opposing party is inherently prejudicial
because it is damaging to that party’s case. Berry v. Loiseau,
223 Conn. 786, 806, 614 A.2d 414 (1992); Chouinard v. Mar-
jani, 21 Conn. App. 572, 576, 575 A.2d 238 (1990). For exclu-
sion, however, the prejudice must be ‘‘unfair’’ in the sense that
it ‘‘unduly arouse[s] the jury’s emotions of prejudice, hostility

or sympathy’’; State v. Wilson, 180 Conn. 481, 490, 429 A.2d
931 (1980); or ‘‘tends to have some adverse effect upon [the
party against whom the evidence is offered] beyond tending
to prove the fact or issue that justified its admission into evi-
dence.’’ State v. Graham, 200 Conn. 9, 12, 509 A.2d 493
(1986), quoting United States v. Figueroa, 618 F.2d 934, 943
(2d Cir. 1980).

Common law recognized unfair surprise as a factor to be
weighed against the probative value of the evidence. See,
e.g., State v. Higgins, supra, 201 Conn. 469; State v. DeMat-
teo, supra, 186 Conn. 703. When dangers of unfair surprise
are claimed to outweigh probative value, nothing precludes
the court from fashioning a remedy other than exclusion, e.g.,
continuance, when that remedy will adequately cure the harm
suffered by the opposing party.

Section 4-3 also recognizes the court’s authority to exclude
relevant evidence when its probative value is outweighed by
factors such as confusion of the issues or misleading the jury;
Farrell v. St. Vincent’s Hospital, supra, 203 Conn. 563; see
State v. Gaynor, 182 Conn. 501, 511, 438 A.2d 749 (1980);
State v. Sebastian, 81 Conn. 1, 4, 69 A. 1054 (1908); or
by considerations of undue delay, waste of time or needless
presentation of cumulative evidence. See, e.g., State v. Parris,
219 Conn. 283, 293, 592 A.2d 943 (1991); State v. DeMatteo,
supra, 186 Conn. 702–703; Hydro-Centrifugals, Inc. v. Craw-
ford Laundry Co., 110 Conn. 49, 54–55, 147 A. 31 (1929).

Sec. 4-4. Character Evidence Not Admissi-
ble To Prove Conduct; Exceptions; Methods
of Proof; Cross-Examination of a Charac-
ter Witness
(a) Character evidence generally. Evidence
of a trait of character of a person is inadmissible
for the purpose of proving that the person acted
in conformity with the character trait on a particular
occasion, except that the following is admissible:
(1) Character of the accused. Evidence of a
specific trait of character of the accused relevant
to an element of the crime charged offered by
an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut such
evidence introduced by the accused.

(2) Character of the victim in a homicide or
criminal assault case. Evidence offered by an
accused in a homicide or criminal assault case,
after laying a foundation that the accused acted
in self-defense, of the violent character of the vic-
tim to prove that the victim was the aggressor, or
by the prosecution to rebut such evidence intro-
duced by the accused.

(3) Character of a witness for truthfulness or
untruthfulness. Evidence of the character of a wit-
ness for truthfulness or untruthfulness to impeach
or support the credibility of the witness.

(4) Character of a person to support a third-

party culpability defense.

(b) Methods of proof. In all cases in which
evidence of a trait of character of a person is
admissible to prove that the person acted in con-
formity with the character trait, proof may be made
by testimony as to reputation or in the form of
an opinion. In cases in which the accused in a

homicide or criminal assault case may introduce
evidence of the violent character of the victim, the
victim’s character may also be proved by evidence
of the victim’s conviction of a crime of violence.
(c) Specific instances of conduct on cross-
examination of a character witness. A charac-
ter witness may be asked, in good faith, on cross-
examination about specific instances of conduct
relevant to the trait of character to which the wit-
ness testified to test the basis of the witness’
opinion.

(Amended Dec. 14, 2017, to take effect Feb. 1, 2018.)

COMMENTARY
(a) Character evidence generally.
Subsection (a) adopts the well established principle that
evidence of a trait of character generally is inadmissible to
show conforming conduct. See, e.g., Berry v. Loiseau, 223
Conn. 786, 805, 614 A.2d 414 (1992) (civil cases); State v.
Moye, 177 Conn. 487, 500, 418 A.2d 870 (criminal cases,
character traits of defendant), vacated on other grounds, 444
U.S. 893, 100 S. Ct. 199, 62 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1979); State v.
Miranda, 176 Conn. 107, 109, 405 A.2d 622 (1978) (criminal
cases, character traits of victim).

Subsection (a) enumerates four exceptions to the general
rule. Subdivision (1) restates the rule from cases such as State
v. Martin, 170 Conn. 161, 163, 365 A.2d 104 (1976). The
language in subdivision (1), ‘‘relevant to an element of the
crime charged,’’ reflects a prerequisite to the introduction of
character traits evidence recognized at common law. E.g.,
State v. Blake, 157 Conn. 99, 103–104, 249 A.2d 232 (1968);
State v. Campbell, 93 Conn. 3, 10, 104 A. 653 (1918).

Subdivision (2) restates the rule announced in State v.
Miranda, supra, 176 Conn. 109–11, and affirmed in its prog-
eny. See, e.g., State v. Smith, 222 Conn. 1, 17, 608 A.2d 63,
cert. denied, 506 U.S. 942, 113 S. Ct. 383, 121 L. Ed. 2d 293
(1992); State v. Gooch, 186 Conn. 17, 21, 438 A.2d 867
(1982). Subdivision (2) limits the admissibility of evidence of
the victim’s violent character to homicide and assault prosecu-
tions in accordance with Connecticut law. E.g., State v. Carter,
228 Conn. 412, 422–23, 636 A.2d 821 (1994) (homicide
cases), overruled in part on other grounds by Label Systems
Corp. v. Aghamohammadi, 270 Conn. 291, 852 A.2d 703
(2004); State v. Webley, 17 Conn. App. 200, 206, 551 A.2d
428 (1988) (criminal assault cases); see also State v. Gooch,
supra, 21 (assuming without deciding that evidence of victim’s
violent character is admissible in assault prosecutions to prove
victim was aggressor).

Subdivision (2) does not address the admissibility of evi-
dence of the victim’s violent character offered to prove the
accused’s state of mind, where the accused’s knowledge of
the victim’s violent character would be necessary. See State
v. Smith, supra, 222 Conn. 17; State v. Padula, 106 Conn.
454, 456–57, 138 A. 456 (1927). The admissibility of such
evidence is left to common-law development.

Subdivision (3) authorizes the court to admit evidence of a
witness’ character for untruthfulness or truthfulness to attack
or support that witness’ credibility. See, e.g., State v. George,
194 Conn. 361, 368, 481 A.2d 1068 (1984), cert. denied, 469
U.S. 1191, 105 S. Ct. 963, 83 L. Ed. 2d 968 (1985). Section
6-6 addresses the admissibility of such evidence and the
appropriate methods of proof.

Subdivision (4) concerns proof of third-party culpability. See
State v. Hedge, 297 Conn. 621, 648, 1 A.3d 1051 (2010)
(once third-party evidence is allowed, evidence introduced by

9

Sec. 4-4

Connecticut Code of Evidence

accused could include evidence of third person’s character,
past criminal convictions or other prior bad acts).

Subsection (a) does not preclude the admissibility of charac-
ter evidence when a person’s character is directly in issue as
an element to a charge, claim or defense. See, e.g., Smith v.
Hall, 69 Conn. 651, 665, 38 A. 386 (1897). When a person’s
character or trait of character constitutes an essential element
to a charge, claim or defense, Section 4-5 (c) authorizes proof
by evidence of specific instances of conduct.

Character traits evidence admissible under subsection (a)
nevertheless is subject to the relevancy standards and balanc-
ing test set forth in Sections 4-1 and 4-3, respectively. See
State v. Martin, supra, 170 Conn. 165–66.

(b) Methods of proof.
Subsection (b) adopts the recognized methods of proving
evidence of a trait of character. E.g., State v. Martin, supra,
170 Conn. 163; State v. Blake, supra, 157 Conn. 104–105.
Generally, neither the accused nor the prosecution may
prove a character trait by introducing evidence of specific
instances of conduct. State v. Gooch, supra, 186 Conn. 21;
State v. Miranda, supra, 176 Conn. 112. However, subsection
(b) must be read in conjunction with subsection (c), which
authorizes, during cross-examination of a character witness,
the introduction of specific instances of conduct relevant to
the character trait to which the witness testified in order to
test the basis of the witness’ opinion. See State v. McGraw,
204 Conn. 441, 446–47, 528 A.2d 821 (1987); State v.
DeAngelis, 200 Conn. 224, 236–37, 511 A.2d 310 (1986).

Notwithstanding the general exclusion of evidence of spe-
cific instances of conduct to prove a person’s trait of character,
subsection (b) sets forth one narrow exception recognized in
State v. Miranda, supra, 176 Conn. 113–14, and its progeny.
See State v. Webley, supra, 17 Conn. App. 206 (criminal
assault cases). The convictions that form the basis of the
evidence introduced under this exception must be convictions
for violent acts. State v. Miranda, supra, 114. Evidence of
violent acts not having resulted in conviction is not admissible.
State v. Smith, supra, 222 Conn. 18.

(c) Specific instances of conduct on cross-examination

of a character witness.

Subsection (c) is based on the rule set forth in State v. Martin,
supra, 170 Conn. 165, which permits the cross-examiner to
ask a character witness about relevant instances of conduct to
explore the basis of the character witness’ direct examination
testimony. Accord State v. DeAngelis, supra, 200 Conn.
236–37. The conduct inquired into on cross-examination must
relate to the trait that formed the subject of the character
witness’ testimony on direct. State v. Turcio, 178 Conn. 116,
127, 422 A.2d 749 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1013, 100
S. Ct. 661, 62 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1980); State v. Martin, supra,
165–66. Moreover, inquiries must be undertaken in good faith.
A court, in its discretion, may limit or proscribe such inquiries
where the probative value of the specific instance evidence
is outweighed by unfair prejudice or other competing concerns.
State v. Turcio, supra, 178 Conn. 128; see Section 4-3.

Where the term ‘‘victim’’ is used in this section and else-
where in the Code, the term includes an alleged victim in those
circumstances in which a person’s status as a victim is subject
to proof.

Sec. 4-5. Evidence of Other Crimes, Wrongs

or Acts Generally Inadmissible
(a) General rule. Evidence of other crimes,
wrongs or acts of a person is inadmissible to prove

the bad character, propensity, or criminal tenden-
cies of that person except as provided in subsec-
tion (b).

(b) When evidence of other sexual miscon-
duct is admissible to prove propensity. Evi-
dence of other sexual misconduct is admissible
in a criminal case to establish that the defendant
had a tendency or a propensity to engage in aber-
rant and compulsive sexual misconduct if: (1) the
case involves aberrant and compulsive sexual
misconduct; (2) the trial court finds that the evi-
dence is relevant to a charged offense in that the
other sexual misconduct is not too remote in time,
was allegedly committed upon a person similar
to the alleged victim, and was otherwise similar
in nature and circumstances to the aberrant and
compulsive sexual misconduct at issue in the
case; and (3) the trial court finds that the probative
value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial
effect.

(c) When evidence of other crimes, wrongs
or acts is admissible. Evidence of other crimes,
wrongs or acts of a person is admissible for pur-
poses other than those specified in subsection (a),
such as to prove intent, identity, malice, motive,
common plan or scheme, absence of mistake or
accident, knowledge, a system of criminal activity,
or an element of the crime, or to corroborate cru-
cial prosecution testimony.

(d) Specific instances of conduct when char-
acter in issue. In cases in which character or a
trait of character of a person in relation to a
charge, claim or defense is in issue, proof shall
be made by evidence of specific instances of the
person’s conduct.

(Amended June 20, 2011, to take effect Jan. 1, 2012.)

(a) Evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts gener-

COMMENTARY

ally inadmissible.

Subsection (a) is consistent with Connecticut common law.
E.g., State v. Santiago, 224 Conn. 325, 338, 618 A.2d 32
(1992); State v. Ibraimov, 187 Conn. 348, 352, 446 A.2d 382
(1982). Other crimes, wrongs or acts evidence may be admis-
sible for other purposes as specified in subsections (b) and
(c) and Section 4-4 (a) (4). Cf. State v. Hedge, 297 Conn.
621, 650–52, 1 A.3d 1051 (2010); see Section 4-4 (a) (4),
commentary. Although the issue typically arises in the context
of a criminal proceeding; see State v. McCarthy, 179 Conn.
1, 22, 425 A.2d 924 (1979); subsection (a)’s exclusion applies
in both criminal and civil cases. See, e.g., Russell v. Dean
Witter Reynolds, Inc., 200 Conn. 172, 191–92, 510 A.2d
972 (1986).

(b) When evidence of other sexual misconduct is admis-

sible to prove propensity.

Subsection (a) specifically prohibits the use of other crimes,
wrongs or acts evidence to prove a person’s propensity to
engage in the misconduct with which the defendant has been
charged. However, the court may admit evidence of a defend-
ant’s uncharged sexual misconduct to prove that the defendant
had a tendency or a propensity to engage in aberrant and

compulsive sexual behavior. State v. Snelgrove, 288 Conn.
742, 759–61, 954 A.2d 165 (2008); State v. DeJesus, 288
Conn. 418, 470–74, 953 A.2d 45 (2008); see State v. Johnson,
289 Conn. 437, 452–55, 958 A.2d 713 (2008), overruled in
part on other grounds by State v. Payne, 303 Conn. 538, 34
A.3d 370 (2012); see also State v. Smith, 313 Conn. 325,
337–38, 96 A.3d 1238 (2014) (evidence of uncharged sexual
misconduct that involved choking victim while she resisted
sexual attack held sufficiently similar to be admissible); State
v. George A., 308 Conn. 274, 298–300, 63 A.3d 918 (2013)
(evidence of uncharged sexual misconduct committed by
defendant against minor victim’s mother held admissible); but
see State v. Gupta, 297 Conn. 211, 224–34, 998 A.2d 1085
(2010) (evidence that defendant physician had fondled other
patients too dissimilar to be admissible). Although DeJesus
involved a sexual assault charge, later, the Supreme Court,
in Snelgrove, made it clear that the DeJesus propensity rule
is not limited to cases in which the defendant is charged with
a sex offense. In Snelgrove, the court stated: ‘‘We conclude
that this rationale for the exception to the rule barring propen-
sity evidence applies whenever the evidence establishes that
both the prior misconduct and the offense with which the
defendant is charged were driven by an aberrant sexual com-
pulsion, regardless of whether the prior misconduct or the
conduct at issue resulted in sexual offense charges.’’ State
v. Snelgrove, supra, 760. The admission of the evidence of
a defendant’s uncharged sexual misconduct to prove that the
defendant had a tendency or a propensity to engage in aber-
rant and compulsive sexual behavior should be accompanied
by an appropriate cautionary instruction limiting the purpose
for which it may properly be used. State v. George A., supra,
294–95; State v. DeJesus, supra, 474.

(c) When evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is

admissible.

Subsection (a) specifically prohibits the use of other crimes,
wrongs or acts evidence to prove a person’s bad character
or criminal tendencies. Subsection (c) however, authorizes
the court, in its discretion, to admit other crimes, wrongs or
acts evidence for other purposes, such as to prove:

(1) intent; e.g., State v. Lizzi, 199 Conn. 462, 468–69, 508

A.2d 16 (1986);

155 (1987);

A.2d 46 (1979);

A.2d 426 (1989);

(2) identity; e.g., State v. Pollitt, 205 Conn. 61, 69, 530 A.2d

(3) malice; e.g., State v. Barlow, 177 Conn. 391, 393, 418

(4) motive; e.g., State v. James, 211 Conn. 555, 578, 560

(5) a common plan or scheme; e.g., State v. Randolph, 284
Conn. 328, 356, 933 A.2d 1158 (2007); State v. Morowitz,
200 Conn. 440, 442–44, 512 A.2d 175 (1986);

(6) absence of mistake or accident; e.g., State v. Tucker,

181 Conn. 406, 415–16, 435 A.2d 986 (1980);

(7) knowledge; e.g., State v. Fredericks, 149 Conn. 121,

124, 176 A.2d 581 (1961);

(8) a system of criminal activity; e.g., State v. Vessichio,
197 Conn. 644, 664–65, 500 A.2d 1311 (1985), cert. denied,
475 U.S. 1122, 106 S. Ct. 1642, 90 L. Ed. 2d 187 (1986);

(9) an element of the crime charged; see, e.g., State v.
Chyung, 325 Conn. 236, 263–64, 157 A.3d 628 (2017) (prior
misconduct evidence held admissible to prove intent to kill);
see also State v. Torres, 57 Conn. App. 614, 622–23, 749
A.2d 1210, cert. denied, 253 Conn. 927, 754 A.2d 799 (2000);
(10) to corroborate crucial prosecution testimony; e.g., State
v. Mooney, 218 Conn. 85, 126–27, 588 A.2d 145, cert. denied,
502 U.S. 919, 112 S. Ct. 330, 116 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1991); or

(11) third-party culpability by defendant’s proffer of third
party’s other crimes, wrongs or acts; State v. Hedge, supra,
297 Conn. 650–52.

Admissibility of other crimes, wrongs or acts evidence is
contingent on satisfying the relevancy standards and balanc-
ing test set forth in Sections 4-1 and 4-3, respectively. For
other crimes, wrongs or acts evidence to be admissible, the
court must determine that the evidence is probative of one or
more of the enumerated purposes for which it is offered and
that its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect. E.g.,
State v. Figueroa, 235 Conn. 145, 162, 665 A.2d 63 (1995);
State v. Cooper, 227 Conn. 417, 425–28, 630 A.2d 1043
(1993). Although the Supreme Court has established no abso-
lute time limit that would bar admissibility of uncharged miscon-
duct, it has suggested that remote prior misconduct must bear
a substantial similarity to conduct at issue and be of an aberrant
or compulsive nature to be admissible. See State v. Chyung,
supra, 325 Conn. 264, 266 n.27 (fourteen year gap between
incidents of misconduct did not render prior misconduct irrele-
vant ‘‘given the strong similarities between the two incidents
and the strongly aberrational nature of the defendant’s con-
duct’’); cf. State v. Snelgrove, supra, 288 Conn. 761 (noting
that, ‘‘ordinarily, a gap of fourteen years would raise serious
questions as to whether the prior misconduct was too remote
in time’’). Concerns about remoteness are lessened if the
defendant was incarcerated for a substantial period during the
gap. See State v. Snelgrove, supra, 761–62; State v. Murrell,
7 Conn. App. 75, 89, 507 A.2d 1033 (1986).

The purposes enumerated in subsection (c) for which other
crimes, wrongs or acts evidence may be admitted are intended
to be illustrative rather than exhaustive. Neither subsection
(a) nor subsection (c) precludes a court from recognizing other
appropriate purposes for which other crimes, wrongs or acts
evidence may be admitted, provided the evidence is not intro-
duced to prove a person’s bad character or criminal tenden-
cies, and the probative value of its admission is not outweighed
by any of the Section 4-3 balancing factors.

(d) Specific instances of conduct when character in

issue.

Subsection (d) finds support in Connecticut case law. See
State v. Miranda, 176 Conn. 107, 112, 405 A.2d 622 (1978);
Norton v. Warner, 9 Conn. 172, 174 (1832).

Sec. 4-6. Habit; Routine Practice

Evidence of the habit of a person or the routine
practice of an organization is admissible to prove
that the conduct of the person or the organization
on a particular occasion was in conformity with
the habit or routine practice.

COMMENTARY
While Section 4-4 generally precludes the use of evidence
of a trait of character to prove conforming behavior, Section
4-6 admits evidence of a person’s habit or an organization’s
routine practice to prove conformity therewith on a particular
occasion. See, e.g., Caslowitz v. Roosevelt Mills, Inc., 138
Conn. 121, 125–26, 82 A.2d 808 (1951); State v. Williams,
90 Conn. 126, 130, 96 A. 370 (1916); Moffitt v. Connecticut
Co., 86 Conn. 527, 530–31, 86 A. 16 (1913); Birkhamshaw
v. Socha, 156 Conn. App. 453, 471, 115 A.3d 1, cert. denied,
317 Conn. 913, 116 A.3d 812 (2015); State v. Hubbard, 32
Conn. App. 178, 185, 628 A.2d 626, cert. denied, 228 Conn.
902, 634 A.2d 296 (1993). The distinction between habit or
routine practice and trait of character is, therefore, dispositive.
See State v. Whitford, 260 Conn. 610, 641–43, 799 A.2d 1034
(2002) (victim’s violent acts inadmissible as habit evidence to

although sparse, suggests that habit is not relevant to prove
wilful or deliberate acts.’’ Id., 642.

‘‘Whereas a trait of character entails a generalized descrip-
tion of one’s disposition as to a particular trait, such as honesty,
peacefulness or carelessness, habit is a person’s regular prac-
tice of responding to a particular kind of situation with a specific
type of conduct.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Birkhams-
haw v. Socha, supra, 156 Conn. App. 471; see State v. Whit-
ford, supra, 260 Conn. 641. ‘‘Habit and custom refer to a
course of conduct that is fixed, invariable, and unthinking, and
generally pertain to a very specific set of repetitive circum-
stances.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Birkhamshaw v.
Socha, supra, 472. ‘‘Testimony as to the habit or practice of
doing a certain thing in a certain way is evidence of what
actually occurred under similar circumstances or conditions
. . . . Evidence of a regular practice permits an inference that
the practice was followed on a given occasion.’’ (Emphasis in
original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Routine practice
of an organization, sometimes referred to as a business cus-
tom or customary practice, is equivalent to a habit of an individ-
ual for purposes of the foregoing standards. Cf. Maynard v.
Sena, 158 Conn. App. 509, 518, 125 A.3d 541, cert. denied,
319 Conn. 910, 123 A.3d 436 (2015).

Sec. 4-7. Subsequent Remedial Measures

(a) General rule. Except as provided in subsec-
tion (b), evidence of measures taken after an
event, which if taken before the event would have
made injury or damage less likely to result, is
inadmissible to prove negligence or culpable con-
duct in connection with the event. Evidence of
those measures is admissible when offered to
prove controverted issues such as ownership,
control or feasibility of precautionary measures.
(b) Strict product liability of goods. Where a
theory of liability relied on by a party is strict prod-
uct liability, evidence of such measures taken after
an event is admissible.

COMMENTARY

(a) General rule.
Subsection (a) reflects the general rule announced in Nalley
v. Hartford Carpet Co., 51 Conn. 524, 532 (1884), and its
progeny. E.g., Hall v. Burns, 213 Conn. 446, 456–57, 569
A.2d 10 (1990); Rokus v. Bridgeport, 191 Conn. 62, 65, 463
A.2d 252 (1983); Carrington v. Bobb, 121 Conn. 258, 262,
184 A. 591 (1936).

The rationale behind this exclusionary rule is twofold. First,
evidence of subsequent remedial measures is of relatively
slight probative value on the issue of negligence or culpable
conduct at the time of the event. E.g., Hall v. Burns, supra,
213 Conn. 457–59 and n.3; Waterbury v. Waterbury Traction
Co., 74 Conn. 152, 169, 50 A. 3 (1901). Second, the rule
reflects a social policy of encouraging potential defendants to
take corrective measures without fear of having their corrective
measures used as evidence against them. Hall v. Burns, supra,
457; see Waterbury v. Waterbury Traction Co., supra, 169.

Evidence of subsequent remedial measures may be admis-
sible for purposes other than proving negligence or culpable
conduct. Such evidence is admissible as proof on issues such
as ownership, control or feasibility of precautionary measures.
See, e.g., Williams v. Milner Hotels Co., 130 Conn. 507,
509–10, 36 A.2d 20 (1944) (control); Quinn v. New York, New

Haven & Hartford Railroad Co., 56 Conn. 44, 53–54, 12 A.
97 (1887) (feasibility). These issues must be ‘‘controverted,’’
however, before evidence of subsequent remedial measures
is admissible. See Wright v. Coe & Anderson, Inc., 156 Conn.
145, 155, 239 A.2d 493 (1968); Haffey v. Lemieux, 154 Conn.
185, 193, 224 A.2d 551 (1966).

The list in subsection (a) of other purposes for which evi-
dence of subsequent remedial measures may be offered is
meant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive. See Rokus v.
Bridgeport, supra, 191 Conn. 66. So long as the evidence is
not offered to prove negligence or culpable conduct, it may
be admitted subject to the court’s discretion. See id., 66–67
(postaccident photograph of accident scene at which subse-
quent remedial measures had been implemented admissible
when photograph was offered solely to show configuration and
layout of streets and sidewalks to acquaint jury with accident
scene); see also Baldwin v. Norwalk, 96 Conn. 1, 8, 112 A.
660 (1921) (subsequent remedial measures evidence also
may be offered for impeachment purposes); cf. Duncan v. Mill
Management Co. of Greenwich, Inc., 308 Conn. 1, 17–18,
60 A.3d 222 (2013) (postaccident photograph of subsequent
remedial measure improperly admitted for impeachment pur-
poses in absence of balancing probative value of evidence
against its prejudicial effect).

(b) Strict product liability of goods.
Subsection (b) adopts the rule announced in Sanderson v.
Steve Snyder Enterprises, Inc., 196 Conn. 134, 146–48, 491
A.2d 389 (1985). In Sanderson, the court stated two reasons
for rendering the general exclusionary rule inapplicable in strict
product liability cases. First, the court reasoned that the danger
of discouraging subsequent corrective measures is not a chief
concern in strict product liability cases: ‘‘The contemporary
corporate mass producer of goods, the normal products liability
defendant, manufactures tens of thousands of units of goods;
it is manifestly unrealistic to suggest that such a producer will
[forgo] making improvements in its product, and risk innumera-
ble additional lawsuits and the attendant adverse effect upon
its public image, simply because evidence of adoption of such
improvement may be admitted in an action founded on strict
liability . . . .’’ Id., 146.

Second, it reasoned that, because the defectiveness of
mass produced goods is at issue in a strict product liability
case, rather than the producer/defendant’s negligence or cul-
pable conduct, the probative value of the evidence is high.
Id., 147.

Permitting evidence of subsequent remedial measures also
conforms to the designation of the risk-utility test as the primary
basis for proving strict product liability for design defects, under
which the availability of a reasonable, alternative design gener-
ally is an essential element of proof. See Bifolck v. Philip
Morris, Inc., 324 Conn. 402, 434–35, 152 A.3d 1183 (2016);
see also Izzarelli v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 321 Conn.
172, 202, 136 A.3d 1232 (2016).

Sec. 4-8. Offers To Compromise

(a) General rule. Evidence of an offer to com-
promise or settle a disputed claim is inadmissible
on the issues of liability and the amount of the
claim.

(b) Exceptions. This rule does not require the

exclusion of:

(1) Evidence that is offered for another purpose,
such as proving bias or prejudice of a witness,
refuting a contention of undue delay or proving

an effort to obstruct a criminal
prosecution, or

investigation or

(2) statements of fact or admissions of liability

made by a party.

COMMENTARY

(a) General rule.
It is well established that evidence of an offer to compromise
or settle a disputed claim is inadmissible to prove the validity
or invalidity of the claim or its amount. See, e.g., Jutkowitz v.
Dept. of Health Services, 220 Conn. 86, 97, 596 A.2d 374
(1991); Simone Corp. v. Connecticut Light & Power Co., 187
Conn. 487, 490, 446 A.2d 1071 (1982); Evans Products Co.
v. Clinton Building Supply, Inc., 174 Conn. 512, 517, 391 A.2d
157 (1978); Fowles v. Allen, 64 Conn. 350, 351–52, 30 A. 144
(1894); Stranahan v. East Haddam, 11 Conn. 507, 514 (1836);
cf. PSE Consulting, Inc. v. Frank Mercede & Sons, Inc., 267
Conn. 279, 332–33, 838 A.2d 135 (2004) (email containing
settlement discussion between defendant and third party
admissible because Section 4-8 precludes only admission of
evidence of settlement between parties to litigation, not
third parties).

The purpose of the rule is twofold. First, an offer to compro-
mise or settle is of slight probative value on the issues of
liability or the amount of the claim since a party, by attempting
to settle, merely may be buying peace instead of conceding
the merits of the disputed claim. Stranahan v. East Haddam,
supra, 11 Conn. 514.

Second, the rule supports the policy of encouraging parties
to pursue settlement negotiations by assuring parties that evi-
dence of settlement offers will not be introduced into evidence
to prove liability or a lack thereof if a trial ultimately ensues.
See Tomasso Bros., Inc. v. October Twenty-Four, Inc., 221
Conn. 194, 198, 602 A.2d 1011 (1992); Miko v. Commission
on Human Rights & Opportunities, 220 Conn. 192, 209, 596
A.2d 396 (1991).

(b) Exceptions.
Subdivision (1) recognizes the admissibility of evidence of
settlement offers when introduced for some purpose other
than to prove or disprove liability or damages. See State v.
Milum, 197 Conn. 602, 613, 500 A.2d 555 (1986) (to show
bias and effort to obstruct criminal prosecution). Section 4-8’s
list of purposes for which such evidence may be introduced
is intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive. See Lynch
v. Granby Holdings, Inc., 32 Conn. App. 574, 583–84, 630
A.2d 609 (1993) (evidence of offer to compromise admissible
to show that parties attempted to resolve problem concerning
placement of sign when trial court instructed jury that evidence
did not indicate assumption of liability), rev’d on other grounds,
230 Conn. 95, 644 A.2d 325 (1994).

Subdivision (2) preserves the common-law rule permitting
admissibility of statements made by a party in the course of
settlement negotiations that constitute statements of fact or
admissions of liability. See, e.g., Tomasso Bros., Inc. v. Octo-
ber Twenty-Four, Inc., supra, 221 Conn. 198; Hall v. Sera,
112 Conn. 291, 298, 152 A. 148 (1930); Hartford Bridge Co.
v. Granger, 4 Conn. 142, 148 (1822). A statement made in the
course of settlement negotiations that contains an admission
of fact is admissible ‘‘where the statement was intended to
state a fact.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Tomasso
Bros., Inc. v. October Twenty-Four, Inc., supra, 198, quoting
Simone Corp. v. Connecticut Light & Power Co., supra, 187
Conn. 490. However, if the party making the statement merely
‘‘intended to concede a fact hypothetically for the purpose
of effecting a compromise’’; Tomasso Bros., Inc. v. October
Twenty-Four, Inc., supra, 198, quoting Evans Products Co. v.

Clinton Building Supply, Inc., supra, 174 Conn. 517; the factual
admission is inadmissible as an offer to compromise. See
Tomasso Bros., Inc. v. October Twenty-Four, Inc., supra, 198.
If, considering the statement and surrounding circumstances,
it is unclear whether the statement was intended to further a
compromise or as a factual admission, the statement must be
excluded. E.g., id., 199; Simone Corp. v. Connecticut Light &
Power Co., supra, 490.

Sec. 4-8A. Pleas, Plea Discussions and

Related Statements
(a) Prohibited uses. Evidence of the following
shall not be admissible in a civil or criminal case
against a person who has entered a plea of guilty
or nolo contendere in a criminal case or partici-
pated in plea negotiations in such case, whether
or not a plea has been entered:

(1) a guilty plea that was later withdrawn or
rejected or any statement made in conjunction
with such a plea;

(2) a plea of nolo contendere or a guilty plea
entered under the Alford doctrine or any statement
made in conjunction with such a plea;

(3) a statement made during plea discussions
with an attorney for the prosecuting authority if
the discussions did not result in a guilty plea or
they resulted in a later withdrawn guilty plea.

(b) Exceptions. The court may admit a state-

ment described in subsection (a):

(1) in any proceeding in which another state-
ment made during the same plea or plea discus-
in fairness the
sions has been introduced,
statements ought to be considered together; or

if

(2) in a criminal proceeding for perjury or false
statement, if the defendant made the statement
under oath, on the record and with counsel
present.

(Adopted Dec. 14, 2017, to take effect Feb. 1, 2018.)

COMMENTARY

(a) Prohibited uses.
Section 4-8A is consistent with Connecticut law. See Law-
rence v. Kozlowski, 171 Conn. 705, 711–12 and n.4, 372 A.2d
110 (1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 969, 97 S. Ct. 2930, 53 L.
Ed. 2d 1066 (1977); see also State v. Gary, 211 Conn. 101,
105–107, 558 A.2d 654 (1989); State v. Ankerman, 81 Conn.
App. 503, 514 n.10, 840 A.2d 1182, cert. denied, 270 Conn.
901, 853 A.2d 520, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 944, 125 S. Ct.
372, 160 L. Ed. 2d 256 (2004); State v. Anonymous (1973-
4), 30 Conn. Supp. 181, 182, 186, 307 A.2d 785 (1973). This
rule is also in accordance with Practice Book § 39-25, which
provides for the inadmissibility of rejected pleas of guilty or
nolo contendere, or pleas that are later withdrawn.

Further, the rule is consistent with rule 410 of the Federal
Rules of Evidence. See United States v. Roberts, 660 F.3d
149, 157 (2d Cir. 2011) (discussion of rule 410 of Federal
Rules of Evidence and waiver of such rights), cert. denied,
565 U.S. 1238, 132 S. Ct. 1640, 182 L. Ed. 2d 239 (2012).
Excluding offers to plead guilty or nolo contendere promotes
the disposition of criminal cases by compromise. ‘‘Effective
criminal law administration . . . would hardly be possible if
a large proportion of the charges were not disposed of by

13

Connecticut Code of Evidence

such compromises.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Fed.
R. Evid. 410, advisory committee notes.

In Kercheval v. United States, 274 U.S. 220, 47 S. Ct. 582,
71 L. Ed. 1009 (1927), withdrawn pleas of guilty were held
inadmissible in federal prosecutions. The court stated that
‘‘[w]hen the plea was annulled it ceased to be evidence . . . .
As a practical matter,
[the withdrawn plea] could not be
received as evidence without putting the petitioner in a
dilemma utterly inconsistent with the determination of the court
awarding him a trial.’’ (Citation omitted.) Id., 224.

As the advisory committee notes indicate, rule 410 of the
Federal Rules of Evidence ‘‘gives effect to the principal tradi-
tional characteristic of the nolo plea, i.e., avoiding the admis-
sion of guilt which is inherent in pleas of guilty. This position
. . . recogniz[es] the inconclusive and compromise nature of
judgments based on nolo pleas.’’ Fed. R. Evid. 410, advisory
committee notes. Similarly, a plea under North Carolina v.
Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 37, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162
(1970), is viewed as the functional equivalent of a plea of nolo
contendere. See State v. Palmer, 196 Conn. 157, 169 n.3,
491 A.2d 1075 (1985).

A statement made during an Alford plea is not necessarily
inadmissible in every situation. See, e.g., State v. Simms,
211 Conn. 1, 6–7, 557 A.2d 914 (admissibility of Alford plea
canvass upheld under unique circumstances when witness
used Alford plea to strike bargain for himself and later changed
position to benefit defendant), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 843, 110
S. Ct. 133, 107 L. Ed. 2d 93 (1989).

(b) Exceptions.
The rule permits the use of such statements for the limited
purposes of subsequent perjury or false statement prosecu-
tions. Cf. State v. Rodriguez, 280 N.J. Super. 590, 597–98,
656 A.2d 53 (App. Div. 1995) (construing state rule of evidence
analogous to rule 410 of Federal Rules of Evidence); State
v. Bennett, 179 W. Va. 464, 469, 370 S.E.2d 120 (1988)
(same). Thus, the rule is inapplicable to a statement made
in court on the record in the presence of counsel when the
statement is offered in a subsequent prosecution of the declar-
ant for perjury or false statement. See Fed. R. Evid. 410,
advisory committee notes.

Sec. 4-9. Payment of Medical and Similar

Expenses
Evidence of furnishing or offering or promising
to pay medical, hospital or similar expenses occa-
sioned by an injury is inadmissible to prove liability
for the injury.

COMMENTARY
Section 4-9 is consistent with Connecticut law. Danahy v.
Cuneo, 130 Conn. 213, 216, 33 A.2d 132 (1943); see Prosser
v. Richman, 133 Conn. 253, 257, 50 A.2d 85 (1946); Sokolow-
ski v. Medi Mart, Inc., 24 Conn. App. 276, 280, 587 A.2d
1056 (1991).

The two considerations upon which Section 4-9 is premised
are similar to those underlying Sections 4-7 and 4-8. First,
such evidence is of questionable relevancy on the issue of
liability because an offer to pay or actual payment of medical
or similar expenses may be intended as an ‘‘act of mere benev-
olence’’ rather than an admission of liability. Danahy v. Cuneo,
supra, 130 Conn. 216; accord Murphy v. Ossola, 124 Conn.
366, 377, 199 A. 648 (1938). Second, the rule fosters the
public policy of encouraging assistance to an injured party by
eliminating the possibility that evidence of such assistance
could be offered as an admission of liability at trial. See Danahy
v. Cuneo, supra, 217.

Section 4-9 covers the situation addressed by General Stat-
utes § 52-184b (c), which provides that evidence of any
advance payment for medical bills made by a health-care
provider or by the insurer of such provider is inadmissible on
the issue of liability in any action brought against the health-
care provider for malpractice in connection with the provision
of health care or professional services. Section 4-9’s exclusion
goes further by excluding offers or promises to pay in addition
to actual payments.

Section 4-9, by its terms, excludes evidence of a promise
or offer to pay or a furnishing of medical, hospital or similar
expenses, but not admissions of fact accompanying the prom-
ise, offer or payment. Furthermore, nothing in Section 4-9
precludes admissibility when such evidence is offered to prove
something other than liability for the injury.

Unlike Section 4-8, Section 4-9 does not expressly require
the existence of a disputed claim as to liability or damages
when the offer or promise to pay, or actual payment, is made,
for the exclusion to apply.

Sec. 4-10. Liability Insurance

(a) General rule. Evidence that a person was
or was not insured against liability is inadmissible
upon the issue of whether the person acted negli-
gently or otherwise wrongfully.

(b) Exception. This section does not require
the exclusion of evidence of insurance against
liability when offered for another purpose, such
as proof of agency, ownership, or control, or bias
or prejudice of a witness.

COMMENTARY

(a) General rule.
Section 4-10 is consistent with Connecticut law. See, e.g.,
Magnon v. Glickman, 185 Conn. 234, 242, 440 A.2d 909
(1981); Walker v. New Haven Hotel Co., 95 Conn. 231, 235,
111 A. 59 (1920); Nesbitt v. Mulligan, 11 Conn. App. 348,
358–59, 527 A.2d 1195 (1987).

The exclusion of such evidence is premised on two grounds.
First, the evidence is of slight probative value on the issue of
fault because the fact that a person does or does not carry
liability insurance does not imply that that person is more or
less likely to act negligently. Walker v. New Haven Hotel Co.,
supra, 95 Conn. 235–36. Second, Section 4-10, by excluding
evidence of a person’s liability coverage or lack thereof, pre-
vents the jury from improperly rendering a decision or award
based upon the existence or nonexistence of liability coverage
rather than upon the merits of the case. See id., 235.

(b) Exception.
In accordance with common law, Section 4-10 permits evi-
dence of liability coverage or the lack thereof to be admitted if
offered for a purpose other than to prove negligent or wrongful
conduct. Muraszki v. William L. Clifford, Inc., 129 Conn. 123,
128, 26 A.2d 578 (1942) (to show agency or employment
relationship); Nesbitt v. Mulligan, supra, 11 Conn. App. 358–60
(to show motive or bias of witness); see Holbrook v. Casazza,
204 Conn. 336, 355–56, 528 A.2d 774 (1987) (same), cert.
denied, 484 U.S. 1006, 108 S. Ct. 699, 98 L. Ed. 2d 651
(1988); see also Vasquez v. Rocco, 267 Conn. 59, 68–69,
836 A.2d 1158 (2003) (evidence of insurance admissible under
‘‘ ‘substantial connection’ test’ ’’ to prove expert witness’ poten-
tial interest in outcome of case). The list of purposes for which
evidence of insurance coverage may be offered is meant to
be illustrative rather than exhaustive.

Sec. 4-11. Admissibility of Evidence of Sex-

ual Conduct in Criminal Prosecutions
‘‘In any prosecution for sexual assault under
sections 53a-70, 53a-70a, and 53a-71 to 53a-
73a, inclusive, no evidence of the sexual conduct
of the victim may be admissible unless such evi-
dence is (1) offered by the defendant on the issue
of whether the defendant was, with respect to the
victim, the source of semen, disease, pregnancy
or injury, or (2) offered by the defendant on the
issue of credibility of the victim, provided the victim
has testified on direct examination as to his or her
sexual conduct, or (3) any evidence of sexual
conduct with the defendant offered by the defend-
ant on the issue of consent by the victim, when
consent is raised as a defense by the defendant,
or (4) otherwise so relevant and material to a
critical issue in the case that excluding it would
violate the defendant’s constitutional rights. Such
evidence shall be admissible only after an in cam-
era hearing on a motion to offer such evidence
containing an offer of proof. If the proceeding is
a trial with a jury, such hearing shall be held in
the absence of the jury. If, after a hearing, the
court finds that the evidence meets the require-
ments of this section and that the probative value
of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect on
the victim, the court may grant the motion. The
testimony of the defendant during a hearing on a
motion to offer evidence under this section may
not be used against the defendant during the trial if
such motion is denied, except that such testimony
may be admissible to impeach the credibility of
the defendant if the defendant elects to testify as
part of the defense.’’ General Statutes § 54-86f
(a).

(Amended March 29, 2022, to take effect June 13, 2022.)

COMMENTARY
Section 4-11 quotes General Statutes § 54-86f (a), which
covers the admissibility of evidence of a victim’s sexual con-
duct in prosecutions for sexual assault and includes a proce-
dural framework for admitting such evidence. In 2015, § 54-
86f was amended with the addition of subsections (b) through
(d). Those subsections address procedural matters rather than
admissibility and, therefore, are not included in Section 4-11.
See General Statutes (Rev. to 2015) § 54-86f, as amended
by Public Acts 2015, No. 15-207, § 2 (concerning, inter alia,
sealing transcripts and motions filed in association with hearing
under § 54-86f and limiting disclosure by defense of state
disclosed evidence).

Although Section 4-11, by its terms, is limited to criminal
prosecutions for certain enumerated sexual assault offenses,
the Supreme Court has applied the exclusionary principles of
§ 54-86f to prosecutions for risk of injury to a child brought
under General Statutes § 53-21, at least when the prosecution
also presents sexual assault charges under one or more of

the statutes enumerated in § 54-86f. See State v. Kulmac,
230 Conn. 43, 54, 644 A.2d 887 (1994). The court reasoned
that the policies underlying the rape shield statute were equally
applicable when allegations of sexual assault and abuse form
the basis of both the risk of injury and sexual assault charges.
See id., 53–54. Although the Code expresses no position on
the issue, Section 4-11 does not preclude application of the
rape shield statute’s general precepts, as a matter of common
law, to other situations in which the policies underlying the
rape shield statute apply. See State v. Rolon, 257 Conn. 156,
183–85, 777 A.2d 604 (2001) (five part test for determining
admissibility of evidence of child’s previous sexual abuse to
show alternative source of child’s sexual knowledge).

In 2022, ‘‘in Criminal Prosecutions’’ was added to the title
of this section for ease of reference, in light of the adoption
of Section 4-12, Admissibility of Evidence of Victim’s Sexual
Behavior in Civil Proceedings Involving Alleged Sexual Mis-
conduct.

Sec. 4-12. Admissibility of Evidence of Vic-
tim’s Sexual Behavior in Civil Proceedings
Involving Alleged Sexual Misconduct
‘‘(a) As used in this section: (1) ‘Sexual miscon-
duct’ means any act that is prohibited by section
53a-70b of the general statutes, revision of 1958,
revised to January 1, 2019, section 53a-70, 53a-
70a, 53a-70c, 53a-71, 53a-72a, 53a-72b or 53a-
73a, and any act that constitutes sexual harass-
ment, as defined in subdivision (8) of subsection
(b) of section 46a-60; and (2) ‘victim’ includes an
alleged victim.

‘‘(b) The following evidence is not admissible
in a civil proceeding involving alleged sexual mis-
conduct: (1) Evidence offered to prove that a vic-
tim engaged in other sexual behavior; or (2)
evidence offered to prove a victim’s sexual predis-
position.

‘‘(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsec-
tion (b) of this section, the court may admit the
evidence in a civil case if the probative value of
such evidence substantially outweighs the danger
of (1) harm to any victim; and (2) unfair prejudice
to any party. The court may admit evidence of a
victim’s reputation only if the victim has placed
the victim’s reputation in controversy.’’ General
Statutes § 52-180c (a) through (c), as amended
by Public Acts 2021, No. 21-40, § 50.

(Adopted March 29, 2022, to take effect June 13, 2022.)

COMMENTARY
Section 4-12 quotes General Statutes § 52-180c (a) through
(c), as amended by Public Acts 2021, No. 21-40, § 50, which
covers the admissibility of evidence of a victim’s alleged sexual
behavior in a civil proceeding that involves allegations of sex-
ual misconduct as defined in subsection (a). The term ‘‘victim’’
includes an alleged victim. See Section 4-11, commentary.
Because subsections (d) and (e) of § 52-180c concern the
procedural framework for admitting such evidence in civil pro-
ceedings, the text of those subsections is not included in Sec-
tion 4-12.

Sec. 5-1. General Rule

A person may not be compelled to testify or to
produce other evidence that he or she is privileged
or obligated by privilege not to divulge by the con-
stitution of the United States, the constitution of
Connecticut, relevant federal statutes, the Gen-
eral Statutes, the common law or any Practice
Book rule adopted before June 18, 2014, the date
on which the Supreme Court adopted the Code.
(Amended Dec. 14, 2017, to take effect Feb. 1, 2018.)

.

COMMENTARY
The rules in Article V retain Connecticut law concerning
privileges. All constitutional, statutory and common-law privi-
leges remain in force, subject to change by due course of law.
As the rules of privilege inhibit the fact-finding process, they
. cautiously and with circumspection
‘‘must be applied .
. . . .’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. Christian,
267 Conn. 710, 727, 841 A.2d 1158 (2004); see also Harring-
ton v. Freedom of Information Commission, 323 Conn. 1, 12,
144 A.3d 405 (2016). The person asserting a privilege has
the burden of establishing its foundation. State v. Mark R.,
300 Conn. 590, 598, 17 A.3d 1 (2011); see PSE Consulting,
Inc. v. Frank Mercede & Sons, Inc., 267 Conn. 279, 330, 838
A.2d 135 (2004); State v. Hanna, 150 Conn. 457, 466, 191
A.2d 124 (1963). Whether a claimed privilege covers particular
testimony or other evidence as to which it is asserted is a
preliminary question to be determined by the court. See Sec-
tion 1-3 (a). Privileges shall apply at all stages of all proceed-
ings in the court. Section 1-1 (c).

Further, evidentiary privileges and confidential matters can
have different meanings and legal effects. State v. Kemah,
289 Conn. 411, 417 n.7, 957 A.2d 852 (2008); see also State
v. Orr, 291 Conn. 642, 673–74, 969 A.2d 750 (2009) (Palmer,
J., concurring in part and in the judgment). ‘‘Evidentiary privi-
leges should be sharply distinguished from information that is
protected from public disclosure because the information was
obtained under a statute or procedure that made it confiden-
tial.’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) C. Tait & E. Prescott,
Connecticut Evidence (5th Ed. 2014) § 5.2, p. 248. Therefore,
this rule does not apply to confidential matters. The following
is a brief, nonexhaustive description of several privileges that
are most commonly invoked and honored in the courts of
this state.

Health-care provider privileges
In Connecticut, there is no common-law physician-patient
privilege. Rather, a form of physician-patient privilege has
been enacted in General Statutes § 52-146o (a). It should be
noted that the provisions of § 52-146o apply to civil actions
but not to criminal prosecutions. State v. Anderson, 74 Conn.
App. 633, 653–54, 813 A.2d 1039, cert. denied, 263 Conn.
901, 819 A.2d 837 (2003); see also State v. Legrand, 129
Conn. App. 239, 262–63, 20 A.3d 52, cert. denied, 302 Conn.
912, 27 A.3d 371 (2011).

The General Assembly has also enacted analogous privi-
leges for communications with certain other health-care pro-
viders, counselors or social workers. These include privileges
for communications between psychiatrist and patient; General
Statutes §§ 52-146d and 52-146e; psychologist and patient;
General Statutes § 52-146c (b); domestic violence/sexual
assault counselor and victim; General Statutes § 52-146k; see
In re Robert H., 199 Conn. 693, 706, 509 A.2d 475 (1986);
marital/family therapist and individual seeking diagnosis or
treatment; General Statutes § 52-146p (b); and licensed pro-
fessional counselor and individual seeking diagnosis or treat-
ment. General Statutes § 52-146s (b). Each of these statutes
has its own provisions governing the assertion or the waiver
of the privilege and should be consulted.

Privileged communications made to clergy
While Connecticut common law does not recognize privi-
leged communications to clergy; State v. Mark R., supra, 300
Conn. 597; see Cox v. Miller, 296 F.3d 89, 102 (2d Cir. 2002),
cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1192, 123 S. Ct. 1273, 154 L. Ed. 2d
1026 (2003); a related privilege has been codified at General
Statutes § 52-146b. That statute protects from disclosure, in
any civil or criminal case, or in any administrative or legislative
proceeding, confidential communications made to a member
of the clergy of any ‘‘religious denomination’’ who is accredited
by ‘‘the religious body to which he belongs, who is settled in
the work of the ministry . . . .’’ General Statutes § 52-146b.
For such a privilege to apply, the person asserting it must
establish that there was a communication, the communication
was confidential, the communication was made to a member
of the clergy within the meaning of § 52-146b, it was made to
the clergy member in his or her professional capacity, the
disclosure was sought as part of a criminal or civil case, and
the privilege was not waived. State v. Mark R., supra, 597–98;
State v. Rizzo, 266 Conn. 171, 283, 833 A.2d 363 (2003); cf.
State v. Mark R., supra, 598–601 (clergy-penitent privilege
was not established when defendant lacked reasonable exp-
ectation that inculpatory statements would be held in con-
fidence).

Privilege against self-incrimination
The fifth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution
of the United States, article first, § 8, of the constitution of
Connecticut and General Statutes §§ 51-35 (b) and 52-199
all protect a person from being compelled to give potentially
incriminating evidence against himself or herself that would
expose such person to criminal liability. A criminal defendant
cannot be forced to testify as a witness in his or her own case
to invoke the privilege. U.S. Const., amends. V and XIV; Conn.
Const., art. I, § 8; see General Statutes § 46b-137 (b) (juvenile
proceedings); see generally C. Tait & E. Prescott, Connecticut
Evidence (5th Ed. 2014) § 5.5.2, pp. 251–53.

The privilege against self-incrimination ‘‘not only protects
the individual against being involuntarily called as a witness
against himself in a criminal prosecution but also privileges
him not to answer official questions put to him in any other
proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or informal, where the
answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings.’’

Connecticut Code of Evidence

(Internal quotation marks omitted.) Olin Corp. v. Castells, 180
Conn. 49, 53, 428 A.2d 319 (1980); see Garrity v. New Jersey,
385 U.S. 493, 87 S. Ct. 616, 17 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1967) (public
employees’ self-incriminating statements obtained during
investigation by threat of discharge could not be used against
them in subsequent criminal proceedings). The privilege
‘‘extends to answers that would in themselves support a con-
viction . . . but likewise embraces those which would furnish
a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute . . . . [I]f
the witness, upon interposing his claim, were required to prove
the hazard . . . he would be compelled to surrender the very
protection which the privilege is designed to guarantee. To
sustain the privilege, it need only be evident from the implica-
tions of the question, in the setting in which it is . . . asked,
that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation
of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because
injurious disclosure could result.’’ (Internal quotation marks
omitted.) Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 11–12, 84 S. Ct. 1489,
12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (1964).

This privilege, however, protects only natural persons and
not corporations. Lieberman v. Reliable Refuse Co., 212 Conn.
661, 667, 563 A.2d 1013 (1989). Because the statute embody-
ing the privilege, § 52-199, serves only to codify the common
law and constitutional limitations, corporations in Connecticut
do not enjoy a privilege against self-incrimination. See id. A
corporate officer or agent, however, can claim the privilege
against self-incrimination on his or her own behalf ‘‘when sum-
moned to testify or produce documentary material in connec-
tion with a suit in which his [or her] corporation is a party.’’
Id., 674.

Additionally, while the privilege against self-incrimination is
absolute, unless waived, when it is invoked in a civil proceed-
ing, its invocation may have adverse consequences for the
person asserting it. See, e.g., Pavlinko v. Yale-New Haven
Hospital, 192 Conn. 138, 147, 470 A.2d 246 (1984) (plaintiff
who invokes privilege at deposition in civil action risks dis-
missal of complaint); Olin Corp. v. Castells, supra, 180 Conn.
53–54 (adverse inference may be drawn against party in civil
action who invokes privilege); cf. In re Samantha C., 268 Conn.
614, 663, 666, 847 A.2d 883 (2004) (when respondent invoked
rule of practice instead of constitutional privilege, adverse
inference could be drawn in termination of parental rights pro-
ceeding if prior notice of adverse inference had been given);
Greenan v. Greenan, 150 Conn. App. 289, 298 n.8, 91 A.3d
909 (noting exceptions to drawing adverse inference in Gen-
eral Statutes §§ 46b-138a and 52-146k (f)), cert. denied, 314
Conn. 902, 99 A.3d 1167 (2014). This rule extends to the
invocation of the privilege by a nonparty if the court determines
that ‘‘the probative value of admitting the [evidence] exceeds
the prejudice to the party against whom it will be used . . . .’’
Rhode v. Milla, 287 Conn. 731, 738, 949 A.2d 1227 (2008);
see Section 4-3. A defendant always may waive this privilege
and choose to testify. See, e.g., James v. Commissioner of
Correction, 74 Conn. App. 13, 20, 810 A.2d 290 (2002), cert.
denied, 262 Conn. 946, 815 A.2d 675 (2003).

Settlement, mediation and negotiation privilege
Privileges related to specific negotiation and mediation pro-
cesses are recognized by statute, elsewhere in this Code,
and by the rules of practice. See General Statutes § 31-96
(mediators appointed by Commissioner of Labor); General
Statutes § 46a-84 (e) (mediation and settlement efforts involv-
ing human rights discrimination claims); General Statutes
§ 46b-53 (c) (Superior Court family mediation program); Gen-
eral Statutes § 52-235d (b) (civil action mediation); see also
Practice Book §§ 11-20A (i), 25-59A (g) and 42-49A (h); Sec-
tion 4-8; Tomasso Bros., Inc. v. October Twenty-Fourth, Inc.,
221 Conn. 194, 198, 602 A.2d 1011 (1992). No evidence of

guilty pleas, guilty pleas entered under the Alford doctrine,
nolo contendere pleas or statements made in proceedings at
which a plea was offered but not accepted by the judicial
authority can be received at the trial of that case. Section 4-8A;
Practice Book § 39-25. With limited exceptions, no statement
made during plea discussions in a criminal case can be admit-
ted at the trial of the case. Section 4-8A.

Sec. 5-2. Attorney-Client Privilege

Communications when made in confidence
between a client and an attorney for the purpose
of seeking or giving legal advice are privileged.
(Adopted Dec. 14, 2017, to take effect Feb. 1, 2018.)

COMMENTARY

The attorney-client privilege is a privilege protecting confi-
dential communications between an attorney and client for the
purpose of seeking or giving legal advice. E.g., Blumenthal v.
Kimber Mfg., Inc., 265 Conn. 1, 10, 826 A.2d 1088 (2003);
Doyle v. Reeves, 112 Conn. 521, 523, 152 A. 882 (1931); see
Goddard v. Gardner, 28 Conn. 172, 174 (1859). The term
‘‘client’’ also includes prospective clients. See Rules of Profes-
sional Conduct 1.18. ‘‘Because the application of the attorney-
client privilege tends to prevent the full disclosure of informa-
tion and the true state of affairs, it is both narrowly applied
and strictly construed.’’ Harrington v. Freedom of Information
Commission, 323 Conn. 1, 12, 144 A.3d 405 (2016); see also
PSE Consulting, Inc. v. Frank Mercede & Sons, Inc., 267
Conn. 279, 330, 838 A.2d 135 (2004).

The privilege protects both the confidential giving of advice
by an attorney and the provision of information to the attorney
by the client or the client’s agent. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.
v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 249 Conn. 36, 52, 730 A.2d
51 (1999); State v. Cascone, 195 Conn. 183, 186–87, 487
A.2d 186 (1985). To be protected, the communications must
be in connection with and necessary for the seeking or giving
of legal advice. PSE Consulting, Inc. v. Frank Mercede & Sons,
Inc., supra, 267 Conn. 330; Ullman v. State, 230 Conn. 698,
713, 647 A.2d 324 (1994). The privilege belongs to the client
and usually can be waived only with the client’s consent. See
Rules of Professional Conduct 1.6; but see Olson v. Accessory
Controls & Equipment Corp., 254 Conn. 145, 170–71, 757
A.2d 14 (2000) (discussion of crime fraud exception, which is
also contained in Rule 1.6 of Rules of Professional Conduct).
The privilege does not protect communications made in the
presence of or made available to third parties. E.g., State v.
Burak, 201 Conn. 517, 526, 518 A.2d 639 (1986); State v.
Gordon, 197 Conn. 413, 423–24, 504 A.2d 1020 (1985). There
are various exceptions to this rule whereby communications
to or in the presence of a third party will be protected by the
privilege. These include: when the third party is deemed to
be an agent or employee of the client or attorney who is
involved with or necessary to the giving or effectuating of the
legal advice; State v. Gordon, supra, 424; communications
made to or in the presence of employees of the attorney (e.g.,
paralegals, secretaries, clerks); Goddard v. Gardner, supra,
28 Conn. 175; experts retained by counsel; State v. Toste,
178 Conn. 626, 628, 424 A.2d 293 (1979); cf. Stanley Works
v. New Britain Redevelopment Agency, 155 Conn. 86, 94–95,
230 A.2d 9 (1967); or certain officers or employees of the client,
including in-house counsel. Shew v. Freedom of Information
Commission, 245 Conn. 149, 158 n.11, 714 A.2d 664 (1998).
Also, communications made to other clients or counsel who
have an established common interest in the prosecution or
defense of an action can be protected. See State v. Cascone,
supra, 195 Conn. 186–87.

Sec. 5-2

Connecticut Code of Evidence

Also, confidential communications between a government
attorney and a public official or employee in connection with
civil or criminal cases, or legislative or administrative proceed-
ings are privileged. General Statutes § 52-146r. Moreover, the
attorney-client privilege can be waived when ‘‘a party specifi-
cally pleads reliance on an attorney’s advice as an element
of a claim or defense, voluntarily testifies regarding portions
of the attorney-client communication, or specifically places
[in] issue . .
. [some matter concerning] the attorney-client
relationship’’ (e.g., claim of legal malpractice). Metropolitan
Life Ins. Co. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., supra, 249 Conn.
52–53; see Pierce v. Norton, 82 Conn. 441, 445–46, 74 A.
686 (1909); see also Rules of Professional Conduct 1.6 (d).
If the privileged communication is later disclosed to a third
party, the privilege is waived unless the disclosure is shown
to be inadvertent. See Harp v. King, 266 Conn. 747, 767–70,
835 A.2d 953 (2003).

The common law has long recognized that making a state-
ment through an interpreter to one’s own attorney does not
waive or abrogate the attorney-client privilege due to the pres-
ence of the interpreter. State v. Christian, 267 Conn. 710,
749, 841 A.2d 1158 (2004); Olson v. Accessory Controls &
Equipment Corp., supra, 254 Conn. 158; Goddard v. Gardner,
supra, 28 Conn. 175; see also General Statutes § 52-146l.

There is nothing in the law that would indicate that this
definition of the privilege is not applicable to other common-
law or statutory privileges. Thus, whenever a deaf or non-
English speaking person communicates through an interpreter
to any person under such circumstances that the underlying
communication would be privileged, such person should not
be compelled to testify as to the communication. Nor should
the interpreter be allowed to testify as to the communication
unless the privilege has been waived.

Sec. 5-3. Marital Privileges

(a) A person in a criminal proceeding may
refuse to testify against his or her lawful spouse
unless the criminal proceeding involves criminal
conduct jointly undertaken by both spouses or
a claim of bodily injury, sexual assault or other
violence attempted, committed or
threatened
against the other spouse or minor child of, or in
the custody or care of, either spouse, including
risk of injury to such minor child. See General
Statutes § 54-84a.

(b) A spouse may not be compelled to testify,
or be allowed to testify, if the other spouse objects,

about confidential communications made during
the marriage unless the confidential communica-
tion is in a criminal proceeding involving joint par-
ticipation in criminal conduct or conspiracy to
commit a crime at the time of the communication,
or a claim of bodily injury, sexual assault or other
threatened
violence attempted, committed or
against the other spouse or any minor child of, or
in the custody or care of, either spouse, including
risk of injury to such minor child. See General
Statutes § 54-84b.

(Adopted Dec. 14, 2017, to take effect Feb. 1, 2018.)

COMMENTARY
There are two separate, distinct privileges pertaining to one
spouse testifying in court against the other spouse: the adverse
spousal testimony privilege and the marital communications
privilege. Under the adverse spousal testimony privilege, the
witness spouse in a criminal prosecution has the privilege to
refuse to testify against the other spouse, as long as they are
still married at the time of trial. General Statutes § 54-84a;
State v. Christian, 267 Conn. 710, 724, 725, 841 A.2d 1158
(2004). The privilege does not apply if the proceeding involves
the claims enumerated in § 54-84a (b) (i.e., joint criminal partic-
ipation, personal violence against spouse or minor child of
either spouse). Cf. General Statutes § 52-146. The spouse
still may invoke other applicable privileges available to any
witness (e.g., privilege against self-incrimination).

The marital communications privilege ‘‘permits an individual
to refuse to testify, and to prevent a spouse or former spouse
from testifying, as to any confidential communication made by
the individual to the spouse during their marriage.’’ (Emphasis
omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. Christian,
supra, 267 Conn. 725. Section 54-84b embodies the common-
law requirements for recognizing the privilege and adds the
requirement that the communication must be ‘‘induced by the
affection, confidence, loyalty and integrity of the marital rela-
tionship.’’ General Statutes § 54-84b (a); accord State v.
Davalloo, 320 Conn. 123, 140, 128 A.3d 492 (2016). As in
the case of the adverse spousal testimony privilege, the testi-
mony of the witness spouse may be compelled under the
marital communications privilege for any of the reasons enu-
merated in § 54-84b (c).

While § 54-84b (b) codified and amended the common-law
spousal privilege as it relates to criminal prosecutions, the
privilege, when invoked in a civil matter, is still defined by
common law. See State v. Christian, supra, 267 Conn. 728–30;
State v. Saia, 172 Conn. 37, 43, 372 A.2d 144 (1976).

Sec. 6-1. General Rule of Competency

Except as otherwise provided by the Code,
every person is presumed competent to be a
witness.

(Amended Dec. 14, 2017, to take effect Feb. 1, 2018.)

COMMENTARY
Section 6-1 establishes a general presumption of compe-
tency subject to exceptions. Cf. State v. Weinberg, 215 Conn.
231, 243–44, 575 A.2d 1003, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 967, 111
S. Ct. 430, 112 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1990). Consequently, a status
or attribute of a person that early common law recognized as
a per se ground for disqualification; e.g., Lucas v. State, 23
Conn. 18, 19–20 (1854) (wife of accused incompetent to testify
in criminal proceeding); State v. Gardner, 1 Root (Conn.) 485,
485 (1793) (person convicted of theft incompetent to testify);
is now merely a factor bearing on that person’s credibility as
a witness.

Section 6-1 is consistent with the development of state statu-
tory law, which has eliminated several automatic grounds for
witness incompetency. E.g., General Statutes § 52-145 (no
person is disqualified as witness because of his or her interest
in outcome of litigation, disbelief in existence of supreme being
or prior criminal conviction); General Statutes § 54-84a (one
spouse is competent to testify for or against other spouse in
criminal proceeding); General Statutes § 54-86h (no child is
automatically incompetent to testify because of age).

The determination of a witness’ competency is a preliminary
question for the court. E.g., Manning v. Michael, 188 Conn.
607, 610, 452 A.2d 1157 (1982); State v. Brigandi, 186 Conn.
521, 534, 442 A.2d 927 (1982); see Section 1-3 (a).

Sec. 6-2. Oath or Affirmation

Before testifying, every witness shall be
required to declare that the witness will testify
truthfully, by oath or affirmation administered in a
form calculated to awaken the witness’ con-
science and impress the witness’ mind with the
duty to do so.

COMMENTARY

The rule that every witness must declare that he or she will
testify truthfully by oath or affirmation before testifying is well
established. State v. Dudicoff, 109 Conn. 711, 721, 145 A.
655 (1929); Curtiss v. Strong, 4 Day (Conn.) 51, 55, 56 (1809);
see Practice Book § 5-3. Section 6-2 recognizes, in accord-
ance with Connecticut law, that a witness may declare that
he or she will testify truthfully by either swearing an oath or
affirming that he or she will testify truthfully. General Statutes
§ 1-23.

The standard forms of oaths and affirmations for witnesses
are set forth in General Statutes § 1-25. Section 6-2 recognizes
that there will be exceptional circumstances in which the court
may need to deviate from the standard forms set forth in § 1-
25. See General Statutes § 1-22. In such circumstances, the
oath or affirmation shall conform to the general standards set
forth in Section 6-2.

Sec. 6-3.

Incompetencies

(a) Incapable of understanding the duty to
tell the truth. A person may not testify if the court
finds the person incapable of understanding the
duty to tell the truth, or if the person refuses to
testify truthfully.

(b) Incapable of sensing, remembering or
expressing oneself. A person may not testify if
the court finds the person incapable of receiving
correct sensory impressions, or of remembering
such impressions, or of expressing himself or her-
self concerning the matter so as to be understood
by the trier of fact either directly or through inter-
pretation by one who can understand the person.

COMMENTARY
Subsections (a) and (b) collectively state the general
grounds for witness incompetency recognized at common law.
See, e.g., State v. Paolella, 211 Conn. 672, 689, 561 A.2d
111 (1989); State v. Boulay, 189 Conn. 106, 108–109, 454
A.2d 724 (1983); State v. Siberon, 166 Conn. 455, 457–58,
352 A.2d 285 (1974). Although the cases do not expressly
mention subsection (a)’s alternative ground for incompetency,
namely, ‘‘if the person refuses to testify truthfully,’’ it flows from
the requirement found in Section 6-2 that a witness declare
by oath or affirmation that he or she will testify truthfully.

The Supreme Court has outlined the procedure courts shall
follow in determining a witness’ competency when one of the
Section 6-3 grounds of incompetency is raised. See generally
State v. Weinberg, 215 Conn. 231, 242–44, 575 A.2d 1003,
cert. denied, 498 U.S. 967, 111 S. Ct. 430, 112 L. Ed. 2d 413
(1990). When a party raises an objection with respect to the
competency of a witness, the court, as a threshold matter,
shall determine whether the witness is ‘‘minimally credible’’:
whether the witness is minimally capable of understanding the
duty to tell the truth and sensing, remembering and communi-
cating the events to which the witness will testify. See id., 243.
If the court determines the witness ‘‘passes the test of minimum
credibility . . . the [witness’] testimony is admissible and the
weight to be accorded it, in light of the witness’ incapacity, is
a question for the trier of fact.’’ Id., 243–44. Thus, a witness’
to impeachment on those
credibility may still be subject

grounds enumerated in Section 6-3 notwithstanding the court’s
finding that the witness is competent to testify.

Sec. 6-4. Who May Impeach

The credibility of a witness may be impeached
by any party, including the party calling the wit-
ness, unless the court determines that a party’s
impeachment of its own witness is primarily for
the purpose of introducing otherwise inadmissi-
ble evidence.

COMMENTARY
Section 6-4 reflects the rule announced in State v. Graham,
200 Conn. 9, 17–18, 509 A.2d 493 (1986). In Graham, the
Supreme Court abandoned the common-law ‘‘voucher’’ rule;
id., 17; which provided that a party could not impeach its
own witness except upon a showing of surprise, hostility or
adversity, or when the court permitted impeachment in situa-
tions in which a witness’ in-court testimony was inconsistent
with his or her prior out-of-court statements. See, e.g., State
v. McCarthy, 197 Conn. 166, 177, 496 A.2d 190 (1985);
Schmeltz v. Tracy, 119 Conn. 492, 498, 177 A. 520 (1935).
In Graham and subsequent decisions; e.g., State v. Wil-
liams, 204 Conn. 523, 531, 529 A.2d 653 (1987); State v.
Jasper, 200 Conn. 30, 34, 508 A.2d 1387 (1986); the court
has supplied a two-pronged test
for determining whether
impeachment serves as a mere subterfuge for introducing
substantively inadmissible evidence. A party’s impeachment
of a witness it calls by using the witness’ prior inconsistent
statements is improper when (1) the primary purpose of calling
the witness is to impeach the witness, and (2) the party intro-
duces the statement in hope that the jury will use it substan-
tively. E.g., State v. Graham, supra, 200 Conn. 18. The court
in Graham instructed trial courts to prohibit impeachment when
both prongs are met. Id. Note, however, that if the prior incon-
sistent statement is substantively admissible under State v.
Whelan, 200 Conn. 743, 753, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479
U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986); see Section
8-5 (1); or under any other exceptions to the hearsay rule, the
limitation on impeachment will not apply because impeach-
ment with the prior inconsistent statement cannot result in
introducing otherwise inadmissible evidence. Cf. State v.
Whelan, supra, 753 n.8.

Section 6-4 applies to all parties in both criminal and civil
cases and applies to all methods of impeachment authorized
by the Code.

Sec. 6-5. Evidence of Bias, Prejudice or

Interest
The credibility of a witness may be impeached
by evidence showing bias for, prejudice against,
or interest in any person or matter that might
cause the witness to testify falsely.

COMMENTARY
Section 6-5 reflects established law. E.g., State v. Alvarez,
216 Conn. 301, 318–19, 579 A.2d 515 (1990); Fordiani’s Peti-
tion for Naturalization, 99 Conn. 551, 560–62, 121 A. 796
(1923); see General Statutes § 52-145 (b) (‘‘[a] person’s inter-
est in the outcome of [an] action . . . may be shown for the
purpose of affecting his [or her] credibility’’); see also State v.
Bova, 240 Conn. 210, 224–26, 690 A.2d 1370 (1997); State
v. Barnes, 232 Conn. 740, 745–47, 657 A.2d 611 (1995).

While a party’s inquiry into facts tending to establish a wit-
ness’ bias, prejudice or interest is generally a matter of right,

the scope of examination and extent of proof on these matters
are subject to judicial discretion. E.g., State v. Mahmood, 158
Conn. 536, 540, 265 A.2d 83 (1969); see also Section 4-3.

The range of matters potentially giving rise to bias, prejudice
or interest is virtually endless. See State v. Cruz, 212 Conn.
351, 360, 562 A.2d 1071 (1989). A witness may be biased by
having a friendly feeling toward a person or by favoring a
certain position based upon a familial or employment relation-
ship. E.g., State v. Santiago, 224 Conn. 325, 332, 618 A.2d
32 (1992); State v. Asherman, 193 Conn. 695, 719–20, 478
A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749,
84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985). A witness may be prejudiced against
a person or position based upon a prior quarrel with the person
against whom the witness testifies; see Beardsley v. Wildman,
41 Conn. 515, 517 (1874); or by virtue of the witness’ animus
toward a class of persons. Jacek v. Bacote, 135 Conn. 702,
706, 68 A.2d 144 (1949). A witness may have an interest in
the outcome of the case independent of any bias or prejudice
when, for example, he or she has a financial stake in its
outcome; see State v. Colton, 227 Conn. 231, 250–51, 630
A.2d 577 (1993); or when the witness has filed a civil action
arising out of the same events giving rise to the criminal trial
at which the witness testifies against the defendant. State v.
Arline, 223 Conn. 52, 61, 612 A.2d 755 (1992).

Because evidence tending to show a witness’ bias, prejudice
or interest is never collateral; e.g., State v. Chance, 236 Conn.
31, 58, 671 A.2d 323 (1996); impeachment of a witness on
these matters may be accomplished through the introduction
of extrinsic evidence, in addition to examining the witness
directly. See, e.g., State v. Bova, supra, 240 Conn. 219; Fair-
banks v. State, 143 Conn. 653, 657, 124 A.2d 893 (1956).
The scope and extent of proof through the use of extrinsic
evidence are subject to the court’s discretion, however; State
v. Colton, supra, 227 Conn. 249; State v. Shipman, 195 Conn.
160, 163, 486 A.2d 1130 (1985); and whether extrinsic evi-
dence may be admitted to show bias, prejudice or interest
without a foundation is also within the court’s discretion. E.g.,
State v. Townsend, 167 Conn. 539, 560, 356 A.2d 125, cert.
denied, 423 U.S. 846, 96 S. Ct. 84, 46 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1975);
State v. Crowley, 22 Conn. App. 557, 559, 578 A.2d 157, cert.
denied, 216 Conn. 816, 580 A.2d 62 (1990).

The offering party must establish the relevancy of impeach-
ment evidence by laying a proper foundation; State v. Barnes,
supra, 232 Conn. 747; which may be established in one of
three ways: (1) by making an offer of proof; (2) the record
independently may establish the relevance of the proffered
evidence; or (3) ‘‘stating a ‘good faith belief’ that there is an
adequate factual basis for inquiry.’’ Id.

Sec. 6-6. Evidence of Character and Con-

duct of Witness
(a) Opinion and reputation evidence of char-
acter. The credibility of a witness may be
impeached or supported by evidence of character
for truthfulness or untruthfulness in the form of
opinion or reputation. Evidence of truthful charac-
ter is admissible only after the character of the
witness for truthfulness has been impeached.

(b) Specific instances of conduct.
(1) General rule. A witness may be asked, in
good faith, about specific instances of conduct of
the witness, if probative of the witness’ character
for untruthfulness.

for

(2) Extrinsic evidence. Specific instances of the
the purpose of
conduct of a witness,
impeaching the witness’ credibility under subdivi-
sion (1), may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.
(c) Inquiry of character witness. A witness
who has testified about the character of another
witness for truthfulness or untruthfulness may be
asked on cross-examination, in good faith, about
specific instances of conduct of the other witness,
if probative of the other witness’ character for
truthfulness or untruthfulness.

COMMENTARY
Section 4-4 (a) (3) provides for the admission of evidence
addressing the character of a witness for truthfulness or
untruthfulness to support or impeach the credibility of such
witness. Section 6-6 addresses when such evidence is admis-
sible and the appropriate methods of proof.

(a) Opinion and reputation evidence of character.
The first sentence of subsection (a) reflects common law.
See, e.g., State v. Gould, 241 Conn. 1, 19, 695 A.2d 1022
(1997); State v. Gelinas, 160 Conn. 366, 367–68, 279 A.2d
552 (1971); State v. Pettersen, 17 Conn. App. 174, 181, 551
A.2d 763 (1988). Evidence admitted under subsection (a) must
relate to the witness’ character for truthfulness, and thus gen-
eral character evidence is inadmissible. See, e.g., Dore v.
Babcock, 74 Conn. 425, 429–30, 50 A. 1016 (1902).

The second sentence of subsection (a) also adopts common
law. See State v. Ward, 49 Conn. 429, 442 (1881); Rogers
v. Moore, 10 Conn. 13, 16–17 (1833); see also State v. Suck-
ley, 26 Conn. App. 65, 72, 597 A.2d 1285 (1991).

A foundation establishing personal contacts with the witness
or knowledge of the witness’ reputation in the community is
a prerequisite to the introduction of opinion or reputation testi-
mony bearing on a witness’ character for truthfulness. See,
e.g., State v. Gould, supra, 241 Conn. 19–20; State v. George,
194 Conn. 361, 368–69, 481 A.2d 1068 (1984), cert. denied,
469 U.S. 1191, 105 S. Ct. 963, 83 L. Ed. 2d 968 (1985).
Whether an adequate foundation has been laid is a matter
within the discretion of the court. E.g., State v. Gould, supra,
19; State v. George, supra, 368; see Section 1-3 (a).

(b) Specific instances of conduct.
Under subdivision (1), a witness may be asked about his
or her specific instances of conduct that, while not resulting
in criminal conviction, are probative of the witness’ character
for untruthfulness. See, e.g., State v. Chance, 236 Conn. 31,
60, 671 A.2d 323 (1996); State v. Roma, 199 Conn. 110,
116–17, 513 A.2d 116 (1986); Martyn v. Donlin, 151 Conn.
402, 408, 198 A.2d 700 (1964). Such inquiries must be made
in good faith. See State v. Chance, supra, 60; Marsh v. Wash-
burn, 11 Conn. App. 447, 452–53, 528 A.2d 382 (1987). The
misconduct evidence sought to be admitted must be probative
of the witness’ character for untruthfulness, not merely general
bad character. E.g., Demers v. State, 209 Conn. 143, 156,
547 A.2d 28 (1988); Vogel v. Sylvester, 148 Conn. 666, 675,
174 A.2d 122 (1961).

Impeachment through the use of specific instance evidence
under subdivision (1) is committed to the trial court’s discretion-
ary authority. State v. Vitale, 197 Conn. 396, 401, 497 A.2d 956
(1985). The trial court must, however, exercise its discretionary
authority by determining whether the specific instance evi-
dence is probative of the witness’ character for untruthfulness
and whether its probative value is outweighed by any of the
Section 4-3 balancing factors. State v. Martin, 201 Conn. 74,
88–89, 513 A.2d 116 (1986); see Section 4-3.

Inquiry into specific instances of conduct bearing on the
witness’ character for untruthfulness is not limited to cross-
examination; such inquiry may be initiated on direct examina-
tion, redirect or recross. See Vogel v. Sylvester, supra, 148
Conn. 675 (direct examination). Although inquiry often will
occur during cross-examination, subsection (b) contemplates
inquiry on direct or redirect examination when, for example,
a calling party impeaches its own witness pursuant to Section
6-4, or anticipates impeachment by explaining the witness’
untruthful conduct or portraying it in a favorable light.

Subdivision (1) covers only inquiries into specific instances
of conduct bearing on a witness’ character for untruthfulness.
It does not cover inquiries into conduct relating to a witness’
character for truthfulness, inasmuch as prior cases addressing
the issue have been limited to the former situation. See, e.g.,
State v. Dolphin, 195 Conn. 444, 459, 488 A.2d 812 (1985).
Nothing in subsection (b) precludes a court, in its discretion,
from allowing inquiries into specific instances of conduct
reflecting a witness’ character for truthfulness when the admis-
sibility of such evidence is not precluded under this or other
provisions of the Code.

Subdivision (2) recognizes well settled law. E.g., State v.
Chance, supra, 236 Conn. 60; State v. Martin, supra, 201
Conn. 86; Shailer v. Bullock, 78 Conn. 65, 69, 70, 61 A. 65
(1905). The effect of subdivision (2) is that the examiner must
introduce the witness’ untruthful conduct solely through exami-
nation of the witness himself or herself. State v. Chance, supra,
61; State v. Horton, 8 Conn. App. 376, 380, 513 A.2d 168,
cert. denied, 201 Conn. 813, 517 A.2d 631 (1986).

(c) Inquiry of character witness.
Subsection (c) provides a means by which the basis of a
character witness’ testimony may be explored and is consis-
tent with common law. State v. McGraw, 204 Conn. 441,
446–47, 528 A.2d 821 (1987); see State v. DeAngelis, 200
Conn. 224, 236–37, 511 A.2d 310 (1986); State v. Martin, 170
Conn. 161, 165, 365 A.2d 104 (1976). Subsection (c) is a
particularized application of Section 4-4 (c), which authorizes
a cross-examiner to ask a character witness about specific
instances of conduct that relate to a particular character trait
of the person about which the witness previously testified. As
with subsection (b), subsection (c) requires that inquiries be
made in good faith.

The cross-examiner’s function in asking the character wit-
ness about the principal witness’ truthful or untruthful conduct
is not to prove that the conduct did in fact occur; State v.
Turcio, 178 Conn. 116, 126, 422 A.2d 749 (1979), cert. denied,
444 U.S. 1013, 100 S. Ct. 661, 62 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1980);
or to support or attack the principal witness’ character for
truthfulness; State v. McGraw, supra, 204 Conn. 447; but to
test the soundness of the character witness’ testimony ‘‘by
ascertaining [the character witness’] good faith, his [or her]
source and amount of information and his [or her] accuracy.’’
State v. Martin, supra, 170 Conn. 165.

Because extrinsic evidence of untruthful or truthful conduct
is inadmissible to support or attack a witness’ character for
truthfulness; e.g., State v. McGraw, supra, 204 Conn. 446;
questions directed to the character witness on cross-examina-
tion concerning the principal witness’ conduct should not
embrace any details surrounding the conduct. State v. Martin,
supra, 170 Conn. 165; accord State v. Turcio, supra, 178
Conn. 126. The accepted practice is to ask the character
witness whether he or she knows or has heard of the principal
witness’ truthful or untruthful conduct. See State v. McGraw,
supra, 447.

Sec. 6-7

Connecticut Code of Evidence

(a) General

Sec. 6-7. Evidence of Conviction of Crime
the purpose of
rule. For
impeaching the credibility of a witness, evidence
that a witness has been convicted of a crime is
admissible if the crime was punishable by impris-
onment for more than one year. In determining
whether to admit evidence of a conviction, the
court shall consider:

(1) the extent of the prejudice likely to arise;
(2) the significance of the particular crime in

indicating untruthfulness; and

(3) the remoteness in time of the conviction.
(b) Methods of proof. Evidence that a witness
has been convicted of a crime may be introduced
by the following methods:

(1) examination of the witness as to the convic-

tion; or

(2) introduction of a certified copy of the record
of conviction into evidence, after the witness has
been identified as the person named in the record.
(c) Matters subject to proof. If, for purposes of
impeaching the credibility of a witness, evidence
is introduced that the witness has been convicted
of a crime, the court shall limit the evidence to
the name of the crime and when and where the
conviction was rendered, except that (1) the court
may exclude evidence of the name of the crime
and (2) if the witness denies the conviction, the
court may permit evidence of the punishment
imposed.

(d) Pendency of appeal. The pendency of an
appeal from a conviction does not render evi-
dence of a conviction inadmissible. Evidence of
the pendency of an appeal is admissible.

COMMENTARY

(a) General rule.
Subsection (a) recognizes the trial court’s discretionary
authority to admit prior crimes evidence; e.g., State v. Skakel,
276 Conn. 633, 738, 888 A.2d 985, cert. denied, 549 U.S.
1030, 127 S. Ct. 578, 166 L. Ed. 2d 428 (2006); Heating
Acceptance Corp. v. Patterson, 152 Conn. 467, 472, 208 A.2d
341 (1965); see General Statutes § 52-145 (b); subject to
consideration of the three factors set forth in the rule. State
v. Nardini, 187 Conn. 513, 522, 447 A.2d 396 (1982); accord
State v. Skakel, supra, 738; State v. Cooper, 227 Conn. 417,
434–35, 630 A.2d 1043 (1993).

A determination of youthful offender status pursuant to chap-
ter 960a of the General Statutes does not constitute a convic-
tion for purposes of subsection (a). State v. Keiser, 196 Conn.
122, 127–28, 491 A.2d 382 (1985); see General Statutes
§ 54-76k.

The trial court must balance the probative value of the con-
viction evidence against its prejudicial impact. State v. Harrell,
199 Conn. 255, 262, 506 A.2d 1041 (1986); see Section 4-3;
see also Label Systems Corp. v. Aghamohammadi, 270 Conn.
291, 313, 852 A.2d 703 (2004) (trial court must weigh ‘‘(1) the
potential for the evidence to cause prejudice, (2) its signifi-
cance to indicate untruthfulness, and (3) its remoteness in
time’’). The balancing test applies whether the witness against
whom the conviction evidence is being offered is the accused

or someone other than the accused. See State v. Cooper,
supra, 227 Conn. 435; State v. Pinnock, 220 Conn. 765,
780–81, 601 A.2d 521 (1992). The party objecting to the admis-
sion of conviction evidence bears the burden of showing the
prejudice likely to arise from its admission. E.g., State v. Har-
rell, supra, 262; State v. Binet, 192 Conn. 618, 624, 473 A.2d
1200 (1984).

The Supreme Court has established no absolute time limit
that would bar the admissibility of certain convictions, although
it has suggested a ten year limit on admissibility measured
from the later of the date of conviction or the date of the witness’
release from the confinement imposed for the conviction. See,
e.g., Label Systems Corp. v. Aghamohammadi, supra, 270
Conn. 309; State v. Nardini, supra, 187 Conn. 526. The court
has noted, however, that those ‘‘convictions having . . . spe-
cial significance upon the issue of veracity [may] surmount
the standard bar of ten years . . . .’’ State v. Nardini, supra,
526; see also Label Systems Corp. v. Aghamohammadi,
supra, 309 (‘‘unless a conviction [has] some special signifi-
cance to untruthfulness, the fact that it was more than ten
years old would most likely preclude its admission under our
balancing test’’(emphasis in original)). Ultimately, the trial court
retains discretion to determine whether the remoteness of a
particular conviction will call for its exclusion. See Label Sys-
tems Corp. v. Aghamohammadi, supra, 307; State v. Nardini,
supra, 526.

A conviction that qualifies under the rule may be admitted
to attack credibility, whether the conviction was rendered in
this state or another jurisdiction. State v. Perelli, 128 Conn.
172, 180, 21 A.2d 389 (1941); see State v. Grady, 153 Conn.
26, 30, 211 A.2d 674 (1965). When a conviction from a jurisdic-
tion other than Connecticut is used, choice of law principles
govern whether, for purposes of the ‘‘more than one year’’
requirement, the source of the time limitation derives from the
law of the jurisdiction under which the witness was convicted
or from an analogous provision in the General Statutes. See
State v. Perelli, supra, 180.
(b) Methods of proof.
Subsection (b) restates the two common-law methods of
proving a witness’ criminal conviction. E.g., State v. Denby,
198 Conn. 23, 29–30, 501 A.2d 1206 (1985), cert. denied,
475 U.S. 1097, 106 S. Ct. 1497, 89 L. Ed. 2d 898 (1986);
State v. English, 132 Conn. 573, 581–82, 46 A.2d 121 (1946).
Although these are the traditional methods of proving a wit-
ness’ criminal conviction, nothing in subsection (b) precludes
other methods of proof when resort to the traditional methods
prove to be unavailing.

Use of the disjunctive ‘‘or’’ is not intended to preclude resort
to one method of proof merely because the other method of
proof already has been attempted.
(c) Matters subject to proof.
Subsection (c) is consistent with common law. State v. Rob-
inson, 227 Conn. 711, 736, 631 A.2d 288 (1993) (name of
crime and date and place of conviction); State v. Dobson, 221
Conn. 128, 138, 602 A.2d 977 (1992) (date and place of
conviction); State v. Pinnock, supra, 220 Conn. 780 (name of
crime and date of conviction). Inquiry into other details and
circumstances surrounding the crime for which the witness
was convicted is impermissible. See State v. Denby, supra,
198 Conn. 30; State v. Marino, 23 Conn. App. 392, 403, 580
A.2d 990, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 818, 580 A.2d 63 (1990).
The rule preserves the court’s common-law discretion to
limit the matters subject to proof. See, e.g., State v. Dobson,
supra, 221 Conn. 138; State v. Pinnock, supra, 220 Conn.
780. The court’s discretion to exclude the name of the crime
generally has been limited to those situations in which the
prior conviction does not reflect directly on veracity. See, e.g.,
State v. Pinnock, supra, 780, 782. When the court orders the

22

Connecticut Code of Evidence

name of the crime excluded, the examiner may refer to the
fact that the witness was convicted for the commission of an
unspecified crime that was punishable by imprisonment for
more than one year. See State v. Dobson, supra, 138; State
v. Geyer, 194 Conn. 1, 16, 480 A.2d 489 (1984).

The rule also reflects the holding in State v. Robinson, supra,
227 Conn. 736. If the witness admits the fact of conviction,
the punishment or sentence imposed for that conviction is
inadmissible. State v. McClain, 23 Conn. App. 83, 87–88, 579
A.2d 564 (1990).

(d) Pendency of appeal.
Subsection (d) restates the rule from cases such as State
v. Varszegi, 36 Conn. App. 680, 685–86, 653 A.2d 201 (1995),
aff’d, 236 Conn. 266, 673 A.2d 90 (1996), and State v. Schroff,
3 Conn. App. 684, 689, 492 A.2d 190 (1985).

(a) Scope of cross-examination and subsequent exami-

Subsection (a) is in accord with common law. E.g., State v.
Ireland, 218 Conn. 447, 452, 590 A.2d 106 (1991) (scope of
cross-examination); Mendez v. Dorman, 151 Conn. 193, 198,
195 A.2d 561 (1963) (same); see State v. Jones, 205 Conn.
638, 666, 534 A.2d 1199 (1987) (scope of redirect examina-
tion); Grievance Committee v. Dacey, 154 Conn. 129, 151–52,
222 A.2d 220 (1966) (same), appeal dismissed, 386 U.S. 683,
87 S. Ct. 1325, 18 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1967). The trial court is
vested with discretion in determining whether evidence offered
on cross-examination or during a subsequent examination
relates to subject matter brought out during the preceding
examination. See Canton Motorcar Works, Inc. v. DiMartino,
6 Conn. App. 447, 458, 505 A.2d 1255 (1986); Larensen v.
Karp, 1 Conn. App. 228, 230, 470 A.2d 715 (1984).

Subsection (a) recognizes the discretion afforded the trial
judge in determining the scope of cross-examination and sub-
sequent examinations. E.g., State v. Prioleau, 235 Conn. 274,
302, 664 A.2d 793 (1995) (cross-examination); see State v.
Conrod, 198 Conn. 592, 596, 504 A.2d 494 (1986) (redirect
examination). Thus, subsection (a) does not preclude a trial
judge from permitting a broader scope of inquiry in certain

mony; or

matters.

nations.

circumstances, such as when a witness could be substantially
inconvenienced by having to testify on two different occasions.

(b) Leading questions.
Subsection (b) addresses the use of leading questions on
direct or redirect examination. A leading question is a question
that suggests the answer desired by the examiner in accord
with the examiner’s view of the facts. E.g., Hulk v. Aishberg,
126 Conn. 360, 363, 11 A.2d 380 (1940); State v. McNally,
39 Conn. App. 419, 423, 665 A.2d 137 (1995).

Subsection (b) restates the common-law rule. See Mendez
v. Dorman, supra, 151 Conn. 198; Bradbury v. South Norwalk,
80 Conn. 298, 302–303, 68 A. 321 (1907). The court is vested
with discretion in determining whether leading questions
should be permitted on direct or redirect examination. E.g.,
Hulk v. Aishberg, supra, 126 Conn. 363; State v. Russell, 29
Conn. App. 59, 67, 612 A.2d 471, cert. denied, 224 Conn.
908, 615 A.2d 1049 (1992).

Subsection (b) sets forth illustrative exceptions to the gen-
eral rule that are discretionary with the court. Exceptions (1)
and (2) are well established. Mendez v. Dorman, supra, 151
Conn. 197–98; State v. Stevens, 65 Conn. 93, 98–99, 31 A.
496 (1894); Stratford v. Sanford, 9 Conn. 275, 284 (1832).
For purposes of exception (1), ‘‘a witness identified with an
adverse party’’ also includes the adverse party.

Under exception (3), the court may allow the calling party
to put leading questions to a young witness who is apprehen-
sive or reticent; e.g., State v. Salamon, 287 Conn. 509,
559–60, 949 A.2d 1092 (2008) (nervous minor victim of assault
who needed repeated reassurances from court); State v.
Hydock, 51 Conn. App. 753, 765, 725 A.2d 379 (minor victim
who ‘‘evinced fear and hesitancy to testify’’), cert. denied, 248
Conn. 921, 733 A.2d 846 (1999); State v. Parsons, 28 Conn.
App. 91, 104, 612 A.2d 73 (minor victims of sexual assault
who had been ‘‘hesitant to testify, and had difficulty testifying
in open court’’), cert. denied, 223 Conn. 920, 614 A.2d 829
(1992); or to a witness who has trouble communicating. See
State v. Salamon, supra, 559–60 (native French speaker with
substantial difficulty testifying in English). The court may also
allow the calling party to put leading questions to a witness
whose recollection is exhausted. See State v. Palm, 123 Conn.
666, 675–76, 197 A.2d 168 (1938).

Under exception (4), the court has discretion to allow a
calling party to use leading questions to develop preliminary
matters in order to expedite the trial. State v. Russell, supra,
29 Conn. App. 68; see State v. Castelli, 92 Conn. 58, 65–66,
101 A.2d 476 (1917).

It is intended that subsection (b) will coexist with General
Statutes § 52-178. That statute allows any party in a civil action
to call an adverse party, or certain persons identified with an
adverse party, to testify as a witness, and to examine that
person ‘‘to the same extent as an adverse witness.’’ The stat-
ute has been interpreted to allow the calling party to elicit
testimony from the witness using leading questions. See Fasa-
nelli v. Terzo, 150 Conn. 349, 359, 189 A.2d 500 (1963); see
also Mendez v. Dorman, supra, 151 Conn. 196–98.

(a) While testifying. Any object or writing may
be used by a witness to refresh the witness’ mem-
ory while testifying. If, while a witness is testifying,
an object or writing is used by the witness to
refresh the witness’ memory, any party may
inspect the object or writing and cross-examine
the witness on it. Any party may introduce the

object or writing in evidence if it is otherwise
admissible under the Code.

(b) Before testifying. If a witness, before testi-
fying, uses an object or writing to refresh the wit-
ness’ memory for the purpose of testifying, the
object or writing need not be produced for inspec-
tion unless the court, in its discretion, so orders.
Any party may introduce the object or writing in
evidence if it is otherwise admissible under the
Code.

COMMENTARY

(a) While testifying.
Subsection (a) recognizes the practice of refreshing a wit-
ness’ recollection while testifying. If, while testifying, a witness
has difficulty recalling a fact or event the witness once per-
ceived, the witness may be shown any object or writing, regard-
less of authorship, time of making or originality, to refresh the
witness’ memory. See, e.g., State v. Rado, 172 Conn. 74, 79,
372 A.2d 159 (1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 918, 97 S. Ct.
1335, 51 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1977); Henowitz v. Rockville Savings
Bank, 118 Conn. 527, 529–30, 173 A. 221 (1934); Neff v.
Neff, 96 Conn. 273, 278, 114 A. 126 (1921). The object or
writing need not be admissible because the witness will testify
from his or her refreshed recollection, not from the object or
writing that was used to refresh his or her recollection. See
Krupp v. Sataline, 151 Conn. 707, 708, 200 A.2d 475 (1964);
Neff v. Neff, supra, 279; see also Doyle v. Kamm, 133 Conn.
App. 25, 40, 35 A.3d 308 (2012) (item used to refresh witness’
recollection need not be admissible).

The trial court is afforded discretion in controlling the admis-
sibility of refreshed testimony. Specifically, the court is vested
with the authority to determine whether the witness’ recollec-
tion needs to be refreshed, whether the object or writing will
refresh the witness’ recollection and whether the witness’ rec-
ollection has been refreshed. See, e.g., State v. Grimes, 154
Conn. 314, 322, 228 A.2d 141 (1966); see also Section 1-3 (a).
Subsection (a) confers on any party the right to inspect the
object or writing used to refresh the witness’ recollection while
testifying and to cross-examine the witness thereon. E.g., Mer-
rill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Cole, 189 Conn.
518, 526, 457 A.2d 656 (1983); State v. Grimes, supra, 154
Conn. 323; Neff v. Neff, supra, 96 Conn. 280–81. This protec-
tion affords the party the opportunity to verify whether the
witness’ recollection genuinely has been refreshed and, if
applicable, to shed light upon any inconsistencies between
the writing and the refreshed testimony. See State v. Masse,
24 Conn. Supp. 45, 56, 186 A.2d 553 (1962); 1 C. McCormick,
Evidence (7th Ed. 2013) § 9, pp. 54–56.

Any party may introduce into evidence the object or writing
used to stimulate the witness’ recollection if the object or writing
is otherwise admissible under other provisions of the Code.
Cf. Palmer v. Hartford Dredging Co., 73 Conn. 182, 187–88,
47 A. 125 (1900). Section 6-9 does not, however, create an
independent exception to the hearsay rule or other exclusion-
ary provisions in the Code. Cf. id. Contrast this rule with Section
8-3 (6), which recognizes a past recollection recorded excep-
tion to the hearsay rule.
(b) Before testifying.
Unlike the situation contemplated in subsection (a), in which
the witness uses an object or writing to refresh recollection
while testifying, subsection (b) covers the situation in which
the witness has used an object or writing before taking the
stand to refresh his or her memory for the purpose of testifying

at trial. In accordance with common law, subsection (b) estab-
lishes a presumption against production of the object or writing
for inspection in this situation but vests the court with discretion
to order production. State v. Cosgrove, 181 Conn. 562,
588–89, 436 A.2d 33 (1980); State v. Watson, 165 Conn. 577,
593, 345 A.2d 532 (1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 960, 94 S.
Ct. 1977, 40 L. Ed. 2d 311 (1974).

Assuming the court exercises its discretion in favor of pro-
duction, subsection (b) does not contemplate production of all
objects or writings used by a witness prior to testifying at trial.
Rather, it contemplates production of only those objects or
writings a witness uses before testifying to refresh the witness’
memory of facts or events the witness previously perceived.
As with subsection (a), subsection (b) authorizes any party to
introduce the object or writing in evidence if it is independently
admissible under other provisions of the Code.

For purposes of Section 6-9, a writing may include, but is
not limited to, communications recorded in any tangible form.

statement made by a witness is shown to or if the

in the discretion of the court. If a prior inconsistent

if the contents of the statement are not disclosed
to the witness at the time the witness testifies,
extrinsic evidence of the statement is inadmissi-
ble, except in the discretion of the court.

COMMENTARY

(a) Prior inconsistent statements generally.
Subsection (a) embraces a familiar common-law principle.
State v. Avis, 209 Conn. 290, 302, 551 A.2d 26, cert. denied,
489 U.S. 1097, 109 S. Ct. 1570, 103 L. Ed. 2d 937 (1989);
G & R Tire Distributors, Inc. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 177 Conn.
58, 60–61, 411 A.2d 31 (1979); Beardsley v. Wildman, 41
Conn. 515, 516 (1874).

Impeachment of a witness’ in-court testimony with the wit-
ness’ prior inconsistent statements is proper only if the prior
statements are in fact ‘‘inconsistent’’ with the witness’ testi-
mony. E.g., State v. Richardson, 214 Conn. 752, 763, 574
A.2d 182 (1990); State v. Reed, 174 Conn. 287, 302–303,
386 A.2d 243 (1978). A finding of a statement’s inconsistency
‘‘is not limited to cases in which diametrically opposed asser-
tions have been made.’’ State v. Whelan, 200 Conn. 743, 749
n.4, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597,
93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986). Inconsistencies can be found in

Connecticut Code of Evidence

omissions, changes of position, denials of recollection or eva-
sive answers. Id., 748–49 n.4. The determination whether an
‘‘inconsistency’’ exists lies within the discretion of the court.
State v. Avis, supra, 209 Conn. 302.

The substantive admissibility of prior inconsistent state-
ments is treated elsewhere in the Code. See Section 8-5 (1).
(b) Examining witness concerning prior inconsistent

statement.

Subsection (b) addresses the necessity of laying a founda-
tion as a precondition to examining the witness about his or
her prior inconsistent statement. It adopts the rule of State v.
Saia, 172 Conn. 37, 46, 372 A.2d 144 (1976). See State v.
Butler, 207 Conn. 619, 626, 543 A.2d 270 (1988); State v.
Williams, 204 Conn. 523, 534, 529 A.2d 653 (1987).

Although Connecticut favors the laying of a foundation; see
State v. Saia, supra, 172 Conn. 46; it consistently has main-
tained that there is ‘‘no inflexible rule regarding the necessity
of calling the attention of a witness on cross-examination to
[the] alleged prior inconsistent statement before . . . ques-
tioning him [or her] on the subject . . . .’’ Id.; see Adams v.
Herald Publishing Co., 82 Conn. 448, 452–53, 74 A. 755
(1909).

(c) Extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent statement

of witness.

The first sentence is consistent with common law. See G &
R Tire Distributors, Inc. v. Allstate Ins. Co., supra, 177 Conn.
61; see also Barlow Bros. Co. v. Parsons, 73 Conn. 696,
702–703, 49 A. 205 (1901) (finding extrinsic proof of prior
inconsistent statement unnecessary when witness admits to
making statement); State v. Graham, 21 Conn. App. 688, 704,
575 A.2d 1057 (same), cert. denied, 216 Conn. 805, 577 A.2d
1063 (1990); cf. State v. Butler, supra, 207 Conn. 626 (where
witness denied or stated that he or she did not recall having
made prior statement, extrinsic evidence establishing making
of that statement could be admitted). Notwithstanding the gen-
eral rule, subsection (c) recognizes the court’s discretion to
admit extrinsic evidence of a witness’ prior inconsistent state-
ment even when the examiner lays a foundation and the wit-
ness admits to making the statement. See G & R Tire
Distributors, Inc. v. Allstate Ins. Co., supra, 61.

The second sentence reconciles two interrelated principles:
the preference for laying a foundation when examining a wit-
ness concerning prior inconsistent statements; see subsection
(b); and the discretion afforded the trial court in determining
the admissibility of extrinsic evidence of a witness’ prior incon-
sistent statements where no foundation has been laid. State
v. Saia, supra, 172 Conn. 46.

Case law forbids the introduction of extrinsic evidence of a
witness’ prior inconsistent statement when the witness’ state-
ment involves a collateral matter, i.e., a matter not directly
relevant and material to the merits of the case. E.g., State v.
Diaz, 237 Conn. 518, 548, 679 A.2d 902 (1996); Johnson v.
Palomba Co., 114 Conn. 108, 115–16, 157 A. 902 (1932).

Sec. 6-11. Prior Consistent Statements of
Witnesses; Constancy of Accusation by a
Sexual Assault Complainant
(a) General rule. Except as provided in this
section, the credibility of a witness may not be
supported by evidence of a prior consistent state-
ment made by the witness.

(b) Prior consistent statement of a witness.
If the credibility of a witness is impeached by (1)
a prior inconsistent statement of the witness, (2)
a suggestion of bias, interest or improper motive

that was not present at the time the witness made
the prior consistent statement, or (3) a suggestion
of recent contrivance, evidence of a prior consis-
tent statement made by the witness is admissible,

the
impeachment.

the court,

to rebut

(c) Constancy of accusation by a sexual

assault complainant.

(1) If the defense impeaches the credibility of
a sexual assault complainant regarding any out-
of-court complaints or delayed reporting of the
alleged sexual assault, the state shall be permit-
ted to call constancy of accusation witnesses.
Such witnesses may testify that the allegation was
made and when it was made, provided that the
complainant has testified to the facts of the alleged
assault and to the identity of the person or persons
to whom the alleged assault was reported. Any
testimony by the witnesses about details of the
alleged assault shall be limited to those details
necessary to associate the complainant’s allega-
tions with the pending charge. The testimony of
the witnesses is admissible only with regard to
whether the complaint was made and not to cor-
roborate the substance of the complaint.

If

(2)

the complainant’s credibility is not
impeached by the defense regarding any out-of-
court complaints or delayed reporting of
the
alleged sexual assault, constancy of accusation
testimony shall not be permitted, but, rather, the
trial court shall provide appropriate instructions to
the jury regarding delayed reporting.

(Amended Dec. 14, 2017, to take effect Feb. 1, 2018.)

COMMENTARY

(a) General rule.
Connecticut’s rule on the admissibility of prior consistent
statements is phrased in terms of a general prohibition subject
to exceptions. E.g., State v. Valentine, 240 Conn. 395, 412–13,
692 A.2d 727 (1997); State v. Dolphin, 178 Conn. 564, 568–69,
424 A.2d 266 (1979). Exceptions to the general prohibition
are set forth in subsections (b) and (c).

impeachment—a claim of

(b) Prior consistent statement of a witness.
Common law permits the use of a witness’ prior statement
consistent with the witness’ in-court testimony to rehabilitate
the witness’ credibility after it has been impeached via one of
the three forms of impeachment listed in the rule. E.g., State
v. Valentine, supra, 240 Conn. 413; State v. Brown, 187 Conn.
602, 608, 447 A.2d 734 (1982). The cases sometimes list a
fourth form of
inaccurate
memory—under which prior consistent statements could be
admitted to repair credibility. E.g., State v. Valentine, supra,
413; State v. Anonymous (83-FG), 190 Conn. 715, 729, 463
A.2d 533 (1983). This form of impeachment is not included
because it is subsumed under the ‘‘impeachment by prior
inconsistent statements’’ category. The only conceivable situa-
tion in which a prior consistent statement could be admitted
to counter a claim of inaccurate memory involves (1) impeach-
ment by a prior inconsistent statement made some time after
the event when the witness’ memory had faded, and (2) sup-
port of the witness’ in-court testimony by showing a prior con-
sistent statement made shortly after the event when the

25

Sec. 6-11

Connecticut Code of Evidence

witness’ memory was fresh. See Brown v. Rahr, 149 Conn.
743, 743–44, 182 A.2d 629 (1962); Thomas v. Ganezer, 137
Conn. 415, 418–21, 78 A.2d 539 (1951).

Although Connecticut has no per se requirement that the
prior consistent statement precede the prior inconsistent state-
ment used to attack the witness’ credibility; see State v. McCar-
thy, 179 Conn. 1, 18–20, 425 A.2d 924 (1979); the trial court
may consider the timing of the prior consistent statement as
a factor in assessing its probative value.

Prior consistent statements introduced under subsection (b)
are admissible for the limited purpose of repairing credibility
and are not substantive evidence. E.g., State v. Brown, supra,
187 Conn. 607; Thomas v. Ganezer, supra, 137 Conn. 421.
In stating that evidence of a witness’ prior consistent state-
ment is admissible ‘‘in the discretion of the court,’’ Section 6-
11 stresses the broad discretion afforded the trial
judge in
admitting this type of evidence. See Thomas v. Ganezer,
supra, 137 Conn. 420; see also State v. Mitchell, 169 Conn.
161, 168, 362 A.2d 808 (1975), overruled in part on other
grounds by State v. Higgins, 201 Conn. 462, 472, 518 A.2d
631 (1986).

(c) Constancy of accusation by a sexual assault com-

plainant.

Subsection (c) reflects the Supreme Court’s recent modifica-
tion of the constancy of accusation rule in State v. Daniel W.
E., 322 Conn. 593, 142 A.3d 265 (2016).

Evidence introduced under subsection (c) is admissible
‘‘only for the purpose of negating any inference that, because
there was a delay in reporting the offense, the offense did not

occur, and, therefore, such evidence may be used only in
considering whether the complaint was made, and not to cor-
roborate the substance of the complaint.’’ Id., 616. The admis-
sibility of constancy of accusation testimony under Daniel W.
E. is subject to the limitations established in State v. Troupe,
237 Conn. 284, 304, 677 A.2d 917 (1996) (testimony of con-
stancy witness strictly limited to details necessary to associate
complaint with pending charge, such as time and place of
alleged assault and identity of alleged assailant). See State
v. Daniel W. E., supra, 322 Conn. 629. Evidence may be
introduced substantively only when permitted elsewhere in
the Code. See, e.g., Section 8-3 (2) (spontaneous utterance
hearsay exception); see also State v. Troupe, supra, 304 n.19.
Upon request, the court shall give a limiting instruction prior
to the admission of constancy of accusation testimony from
any of the individuals to whom a complainant had reported
the alleged sexual assault. See, e.g., State v. Salazar, 151
Conn. App. 463, 475–76, 93 A.3d 1192 (2014), cert. denied,
323 Conn. 914, 149 A.3d 496 (2016).

If the defense does not challenge the complainant’s credibil-
ity regarding out-of-court complaints or delayed reporting, con-
stancy evidence is not admissible, but the court shall instruct
the jury that (1) there are many reasons why sexual assault
victims may delay officially reporting the offense, and (2) to
the extent that the complainant delayed reporting the alleged
offense, the delay should not be considered by the jury in
evaluating the complainant’s credibility. State v. Daniel W. E.,
supra, 322 Conn. 629; see Connecticut Criminal Jury Instruc-
tions 7.2-1, available at http://www.jud.ct.gov/JI/Criminal/

If a witness is not testifying as an expert, the
witness may not testify in the form of an opinion,
unless the opinion is rationally based on the per-
ception of the witness and is helpful to a clear
understanding of the testimony of the witness or
the determination of a fact in issue.

COMMENTARY

Section 7-1 sets forth standards for the admissibility of non-
expert opinion testimony. Section 7-1 is based on the tradi-
testify as experts
tional rule that witnesses who did not
generally were required to limit their testimony to an account
of the facts and, with but a few exceptions, could not state an
opinion or conclusion. E.g., Robinson v. Faulkner, 163 Conn.
365, 371–72, 306 A.2d 857 (1972); Stephanofsky v. Hill, 136
Conn. 379, 382, 71 A.2d 560 (1950); Sydleman v. Beckwith,
43 Conn. 9, 11 (1875). Section 7-1 attempts to preserve the
common-law preference for testimony of facts but recognizes
there may be situations in which opinion testimony will be
more helpful to the fact finder than a rendition of the observed
facts only.

In some situations, a witness may not be able to convey
sufficiently his or her sensory impressions to the fact finder
by a mere report of the facts upon which those impressions
were based and, instead, may use language in the form of a
summary characterization that is effectively an opinion about
his or her observation. See State v. McGinnis, 158 Conn.
124, 130–31, 256 A.2d 241 (1969). As a matter of practical
necessity, this type of nonexpert opinion testimony may be
admitted because the facts upon which the witness’ opinion
is based ‘‘are so numerous or so complicated as to be incapa-
ble of separation, or so evanescent in character [that] they
cannot be fully recollected or detailed, or described, or repro-
duced so as to give the trier the impression they gave the
witness . . . .’’ Atwood v. Atwood, 84 Conn. 169, 173, 79 A.

L. Ed. 2d 312 (1989); Stephanofsky v. Hill, supra, 136 Conn.
382; Sydleman v. Beckwith, supra, 43 Conn. 12.

Some of the matters upon which nonexpert opinion testi-
mony has been held admissible include: the market value of
property where the witness is the owner of the property; Mis-
isco v. La Maita, 150 Conn. 680, 684, 192 A.2d 891 (1963);
the appearance of persons or things; State v. McGinnis, supra,
158 Conn. 130–31; MacLaren v. Bishop, 113 Conn. 312,
313–15, 155 A. 210 (1931); sound; Johnson v. Newell, 160
Conn. 269, 277–78, 278 A.2d 776 (1971); the speed of an
automobile; Acampora v. Asselin, 179 Conn. 425, 427, 426
A.2d 797 (1980); Stephanofsky v. Hill, supra, 136 Conn.
382–83; physical or mental condition of others; Atwood v.
Atwood, supra, 84 Conn. 172–75; and safety of common out-
door objects, such as a fence or the state of repair of a road.
See Czajkowski v. YMCA of Metropolitan Hartford, Inc., 149

Conn. App. 436, 446–47, 89 A.3d 904 (2014) (citing cases).
In other contexts, however, nonexpert opinion testimony has
been held inadmissible. See, e.g., Pickel v. Automated Waste
Disposal, Inc., 65 Conn. App. 176, 190, 782 A.2d 231 (2001)
(trial court properly excluded lay opinion testimony regarding
cause of accident).

Whether nonexpert opinion testimony is admissible is a pre-
liminary question for the court. See Section 1-3 (a); see also,
e.g., Turbert v. Mather Motors, Inc., 165 Conn. 422, 434, 334
A.2d 903 (1973) (admissibility of nonexpert opinion testimony
within court’s discretion).

Sec. 7-2. Testimony by Experts

A witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,
skill, experience, training, education or otherwise
may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise
concerning scientific, technical or other special-
ized knowledge, if the testimony will assist the
trier of fact in understanding the evidence or in
determining a fact in issue.

COMMENTARY

The subject matter upon which expert witnesses may testify
is not limited to the scientific or technical fields but extends
to all areas of specialized knowledge. See, e.g., State v.
Edwards, 325 Conn. 97, 126–28, 156 A.3d 506 (2017)
(explaining what qualifies as expert testimony); see also State
v. Correa, 241 Conn. 322, 355, 696 A.2d 944 (1997) (federal
agent properly allowed to testify about local cocaine distribu-
tion and its connection with violence); State v. Hasan, 205
Conn. 485, 494–95, 534 A.2d 877 (1987) (podiatrist properly
allowed to testify about physical match between shoe and
defendant’s foot).

Section 7-2 requires a party offering expert testimony, in
any form, to show that the witness is qualified and that the
testimony will be of assistance to the trier of fact. A three part
test is used to determine whether these requirements are met.
E.g., Sullivan v. Metro-North Commuter Railroad Co., 292
Conn. 150, 158, 971 A.2d 676 (2009). First, the expert must
possess knowledge, skill, experience, training, education or
some other source of learning directly applicable to a matter
in issue. E.g., Weaver v. McKnight, 313 Conn. 393, 406–409,
97 A.3d 920 (2014); State v. Borrelli, 227 Conn. 153, 165–67,
629 A.2d 1105 (1993), State v. Girolamo, 197 Conn. 201,
214–15, 496 A.2d 948 (1985). Second, the witness’ skill or
knowledge must not be common to the average person. See,
e.g., State v. Guilbert, 306 Conn. 218, 230, 49 A.3d 705 (2012);
State v. Borrelli, supra, 167–71. Third, the testimony must be
helpful to the fact finder in considering the issues. See, e.g.,
State v. Hasan, supra, 205 Conn. 494 (‘‘[t]he value of [the
witness’] expertise lay in its assistance to the jury in reviewing
and evaluating the evidence’’). The inquiry is often summa-
rized in the following terms: ‘‘The true test of the admissibility

27

Sec. 7-2

Connecticut Code of Evidence

of [expert] testimony is not whether the subject matter is com-
mon or uncommon, or whether many persons or few have
some knowledge of the matter; but it is whether the witnesses
offered as experts have any peculiar knowledge or experience,
not common to the world, which renders their opinions founded
on such knowledge or experience any aid to the court or the
jury in determining the questions at issue.’’ (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) Going v. Pagani, 172 Conn. 29, 35, 372 A.2d
516 (1976).

The case law imposes an additional admissibility require-
ment with respect to some—but not all—types of scientific
expert testimony. This additional requirement derives from
State v. Porter, 241 Conn. 57, 73, 698 A.2d 739 (1997), cert.
denied, 523 U.S. 1058, 118 S. Ct. 1384, 140 L. Ed. 2d 645
(1998), which directs trial judges, in considering the admission
of certain types of scientific expert testimony, to serve a gate-
keeper function in determining whether such evidence will
assist the trier of fact. Porter adopted an approach similar to
that taken by the United States Supreme Court in construing
the analogous federal rule of evidence in Daubert v. Merrell
Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786,
125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993). State v. Porter, supra, 61, 68. For
scientific expert testimony subject to Porter, the three part test
discussed previously is supplemented by a fourth threshold
requirement. See id., 81; see also Weaver v. McKnight, supra,
313 Conn. 414–15; Maher v. Quest Diagnostics, Inc., 269
Conn. 154, 168, 847 A.2d 978 (2004). This fourth requirement
itself has two parts. State v. Porter, supra, 63–64; see also
Weaver v. McKnight, supra, 413–14. The proffering party first
must establish that the scientific expert testimony is reliable.
State v. Porter, supra, 64. Scientific expert testimony is reliable
if the underlying reasoning or methodology is scientifically
valid. Id. Porter identifies several factors that should be consid-
ered by a trial judge to help decide whether scientific expert
testimony is reliable. Id., 84–86. This list of factors is not
exclusive; id., 84; and the operation of each factor varies
depending on the specific context of each case. Id., 86–87.
The second part of the Porter analysis requires the trial judge
to determine that the proffered scientific evidence is relevant
to the case, meaning that the reasoning or methodology under-
lying the scientific theory or technique in question properly
can be applied to the facts in issue. Id., 64–65. ‘‘In other words,
proposed scientific testimony must be demonstrably relevant
to the facts of the particular case in which it is offered, and
not simply be valid in the abstract.’’ Id., 65; accord Weaver
v. McKnight, supra, 414. This is sometimes called the ‘‘fit
requirement’’ of Porter. (Emphasis omitted; internal quotation
marks omitted.) State v. Guilbert, supra, 306 Conn. 232;
accord State v. Porter, supra, 83. The relevance and prejudice
analysis under Article IV of the Code also remains fully applica-
ble to scientific expert testimony. See, e.g., State v. Kelly, 256
Conn. 23, 74, 770 A.2d 908 (2001).

The Porter analysis applies only to certain types of scientific
expert testimony. See State v. Reid, 254 Conn. 540, 546, 757
A.2d 482 (2000); see also Maher v. Quest Diagnostics, Inc.,
supra, 269 Conn. 170 n.22 (‘‘certain types of evidence,
although ostensibly rooted in scientific principles and pre-
sented by expert witnesses with scientific training, are not
‘scientific’ for the purposes of our admissibility standard for
scientific evidence, either before or after Porter’’). The cases
have articulated two categories of scientific expert testimony
that are not subject to the additional analysis required under
Porter. The first category reflects the fact that ‘‘some scientific
principles have become so well established [in the scientific
community] that an explicit Daubert analysis is not necessary
for admission of evidence thereunder.’’ State v. Porter, supra,
241 Conn. 85 n.30; see id. (‘‘a very few scientific principles

are so firmly established as to have attained the status of
scientific law, such as the laws of thermodynamics’’ (internal
quotation marks omitted)); see also State v. Kirsch, 263 Conn.
390, 402–403, 820 A.2d 236 (2003). The second category of
scientific expert testimony exempt from the Porter analysis is
evidence that leaves the jury ‘‘in a position to weigh the proba-
tive value of the [expert] testimony without abandoning com-
to the
mon sense and sacrificing independent
expert’s assertions based on his special skill or knowledge.’’
State v. Hasan, supra, 205 Conn. 491; accord State v. Reid,
supra, 547. This exception recognizes that certain expert testi-
mony, although scientific in nature, may be presented in a
manner, or involve a subject matter, such that its admission
does not risk supplanting the role of ‘‘lay jurors awed by an
aura of mystic infallibility surrounding scientific techniques,
experts and the fancy devices employed.’’ (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) State v. Hasan, supra, 490.

judgment

The United States Supreme Court has held that the trial
judge’s gatekeeping function under rule 702 of the Federal
Rules of Evidence applies not only to testimony based on
scientific knowledge, but also to testimony based on technical
and other specialized knowledge, and that the trial judge may
consider one or more of the Daubert factors if doing so will
aid in determining the reliability of the testimony. Kumho Tire
Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 147–49, 119 S. Ct.
1167, 143 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1999) (Kumho Tire). The Code takes
no position on an application of Porter to testimony based on
technical and other specialized knowledge. Thus, Section 7-
2 should not be read either as including or precluding the
Kumho Tire rule. See State v. West, 274 Conn. 605, 638 n.37,
877 A.2d 787 (declining to decide issue), cert. denied, 546
U.S. 1049, 126 S. Ct. 775, 163 L. Ed. 2d 601 (2005).

In cases involving claims of professional negligence or other
issues beyond the field of the ordinary knowledge and experi-
ence of judges or jurors, expert testimony may be required to
establish one or more elements of a claim. See, e.g., Boone
v. William W. Backus Hospital, 272 Conn. 551, 567, 864 A.2d
1 (2005) (medical malpractice); Davis v. Margolis, 215 Conn.
408, 416, 576 A.2d 489 (1990) (legal malpractice); see LePage
v. Horne, 262 Conn. 116, 125–26, 809 A.2d 505 (2002) (expert
testimony was required in case involving consideration of risk
factors for sudden infant death syndrome); but see Doe v.
Hartford Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., 317 Conn. 357,
375–78, 119 A.3d 462 (2015) (expert
testimony was not
required to assess risk of relapse of alcoholic, known to defend-
ant as child molester, whose tendencies were exacerbated
by alcohol).

Sec. 7-3. Opinion on Ultimate Issue

(a) General rule. Testimony in the form of an
opinion is inadmissible if it embraces an ultimate
issue to be decided by the trier of fact, except
that, other than as provided in subsection (b), an
expert witness may give an opinion that embraces
an ultimate issue where the trier of fact needs
expert assistance in deciding the issue.

(b) Mental state or condition of defendant in
a criminal case. ‘‘No expert witness testifying
with respect to the mental state or condition of a
defendant in a criminal case may state an opinion
or inference as to whether the defendant did or
did not have the mental state or condition consti-
tuting an element of the crime charged or of a
defense thereto, except that such expert witness

28

Connecticut Code of Evidence

may state his diagnosis of the mental state or
condition of the defendant. The ultimate issue as
to whether the defendant was criminally responsi-
ble for the crime charged is a matter for the trier
of fact alone.’’ General Statutes § 54-86i.

COMMENTARY

(a) General rule.
An ultimate issue is one that cannot ‘‘reasonably be sepa-
rated from the essence of the matter to be decided [by the
trier of fact].’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. Finan,
275 Conn. 60, 66, 881 A.2d 187 (2005). The common-law
rule concerning the admissibility of a witness’ opinion on the
ultimate issue is phrased in terms of a general prohibition
subject to numerous exceptions. E.g., State v. Spigarolo, 210
Conn. 359, 373, 556 A.2d 112, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 933,
110 S. Ct. 322, 107 L. Ed. 2d 312 (1989); State v. Vilalastra,
207 Conn. 35, 41, 540 A.2d 42 (1988). Subsection (a) adopts
the general bar to the admission of nonexpert and expert
opinion testimony that embraces an ultimate issue.

Subsection (a) recognizes an exception to the general rule
for expert witnesses in circumstances in which the jury needs
expert assistance in deciding the ultimate issue. A common
example is a case involving claims of professional negligence.
See, e.g., Pisel v. Stamford Hospital, 180 Conn. 314, 328–29,
430 A.2d 1 (1980). When there is particular concern about
invading the province of the fact finder, courts may allow the
expert to testify regarding common behavioral characteristics
of certain types of individuals; State v. Vilalastra, supra, 207
Conn. 45 (behavior of drug dealers); but will prohibit the expert
from opining as to whether a particular individual exhibited
that behavior. See, e.g., State v. Taylor G., 315 Conn. 734,
762–63, 110 A.3d 338 (2015) (behavior of child victim of sexual
abuse). Expert opinion on the ultimate issue admissible under
subsection (a) also must satisfy the admissibility requirements
applicable to all expert testimony set forth in Sections 7-2 and
7-4.

(b) Mental state or condition of defendant in a crimi-

nal case.

Subsection (b), including its use of the term ‘‘opinion or
inference,’’ is taken verbatim from General Statutes § 54-86i.
The Code attributes no significance to the difference between
the term ‘‘opinion or inference,’’ as used in subsection (b), and
the term ‘‘opinion’’ or ‘‘opinions,’’ without the accompanying
‘‘or inference’’ language, used in other provisions of Article
VII of the Code.

Sec. 7-4. Opinion Testimony by Experts;
Bases of Opinion Testimony by Experts;
Hypothetical Questions
(a) Opinion testimony by experts. An expert
may testify in the form of an opinion and give
reasons therefor, provided sufficient
facts are
shown as the foundation for the expert’s opinion.
(b) Bases of opinion testimony by experts.
The facts in the particular case upon which an
expert bases an opinion may be those perceived
by or made known to the expert at or before the
proceeding. The facts need not be admissible in
evidence if of a type customarily relied on by
experts in the particular field in forming opinions
on the subject. The facts relied on pursuant to this

subsection are not substantive evidence, unless
otherwise admissible as such evidence.

(c) Hypothetical questions. An expert may
give an opinion in response to a hypothetical
question provided that the hypothetical question:
(1) presents the facts in such a manner that they
bear a true and fair relationship to each other and
to the evidence in the case; (2) is not worded so
as to mislead or confuse the jury; and (3) is not
so lacking in the essential facts as to be without
value in the decision of the case. A hypothetical
question need not contain all of
the facts in
evidence.

COMMENTARY
(a) Opinion testimony by experts.
Connecticut case law requires disclosure of the ‘‘factual
basis’’ underlying an expert witness’ opinion before the expert
witness may render that opinion. (Internal quotation marks
omitted.) Borkowski v. Borkowski, 228 Conn. 729, 742, 638
A.2d 1060 (1994); accord State v. John, 210 Conn. 652, 677,
557 A.2d 93, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 824, 110 S. Ct. 84, 107
L. Ed. 2d 50 (1989); State v. Asherman, 193 Conn. 695, 716,
478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct.
1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985); see also Practice Book § 13-
4 (b) (1); Going v. Pagani, 172 Conn. 29, 34, 372 A.2d 516
(1976). Subsection (a) incorporates this principle by requiring
the party offering the evidence to show that the expert’s opinion
rests upon an adequate factual foundation. This requirement
applies whether the expert’s opinion is based on personal
knowledge or secondhand facts made known to the expert at
or before trial. E.g., State v. John, supra, 676–78 (secondhand
data customarily relied on by other experts); Going v. Pagani,
supra, 32 (firsthand observation); Floyd v. Fruit Industries,
Inc., 144 Conn. 659, 666, 136 A.2d 918 (1957) (secondhand
facts made known to expert
through use of hypothetical
question).

Subsection (a) contemplates that disclosure of the ‘‘founda-
tional’’ facts will, in most cases, occur during the examination
undertaken by the party calling the expert and before the
expert states his or her opinion. The requirement of preliminary
disclosure, however, is subject to the trial court’s discretionary
authority to admit evidence upon proof of connecting facts or
subject to later proof of connecting facts. Section 1-3 (b); see
John V. Schaefer, Jr. & Co. v. Ely, 84 Conn. 501, 509, 80
A. 775 (1911). Nothing in subsection (a) precludes further
exploration into the factual basis for the expert’s opinion during
cross-examination of the expert. Whether sufficient facts are
shown as the foundation for the expert’s opinion is a prelimi-
nary question to be decided by the trial court. Liskiewicz v.
LeBlanc, 5 Conn. App. 136, 141, 497 A.2d 86 (1985); see
Section 1-3 (a).

The admissibility of expert

testimony rendered by a
physician—whether a treating or nontreating physician—is
governed by the same evidentiary standard applied to the
testimony of expert witnesses generally. George v. Ericson,
250 Conn. 312, 317, 736 A.2d 889 (1999), overruling Brown
v. Blauvelt, 152 Conn. 272, 274, 205 A.2d 773 (1964).

(b) Bases of opinion testimony by experts.
Subsection (b) allows an expert witness to base his or her
opinion on ‘‘facts’’ derived from one or more of three possible
sources. First, the expert’s opinion may be based on facts
‘‘perceived by’’ the expert at or before trial, in other words,
facts the expert observes firsthand. E.g., State v. Conroy, 194
Conn. 623, 628–29, 484 A.2d 448 (1984); Donch v. Kardos,

29

Sec. 7-4

Connecticut Code of Evidence

149 Conn. 196, 201, 177 A.2d 801 (1962); Wilhelm v. Czuczka,
19 Conn. App. 36, 42, 561 A.2d 146 (1989). For example, a
treating physician often will base an expert opinion on observa-
tions the physician made while examining the patient. See
generally State v. McClary, 207 Conn. 233, 236–38, 541 A.2d
96 (1988).

Second, the expert’s opinion may be based on facts ‘‘made
known’’ to the expert at trial. This category includes facts that
the expert learned while attending the trial and listening to the
testimony of other witnesses prior to rendering his or her own
opinion. See DiBiase v. Garnsey, 106 Conn. 86, 89, 136 A.
871 (1927). It also includes facts presented to the expert in
the form of a hypothetical question. See, e.g., Keeney v. L &
S Construction, 226 Conn. 205, 213, 626 A.2d 1299 (1993);
State v. Auclair, 33 Conn. Supp. 704, 713, 368 A.2d 235, cert.
denied, 171 Conn. 747, 364 A.2d 235 (1976).

Finally, the expert’s opinion may be based on facts, of which
the expert has no firsthand knowledge, made known to the
expert before trial, regardless of the admissibility of those facts
themselves. See, e.g., State v. Gonzalez, 206 Conn. 391, 408,
538 A.2d 210 (1988) (expert’s opinion was based on autopsy
report of another medical examiner); State v. Cosgrove, 181
Conn. 562, 584, 436 A.2d 33 (1980) (expert’s opinion was
derived from reports that included observations of other toxi-
cologists).

Although the factual basis for expert opinions resting on
the first two sources of information (i.e., facts gleaned from
firsthand observation or facts made known to the expert at
trial) normally do not encounter obstacles to admissibility, case
law is inconsistent with respect to the admissibility of expert
opinion based on facts in the last category (i.e., facts them-
selves that are inadmissible at trial and of which the expert
has no firsthand knowledge). In accordance with the modern
trend in Connecticut, subsection (b) provides that an expert
may offer an opinion based on facts that are not themselves
admissible if those facts are of a type customarily relied on
by experts in the particular field in forming their opinions.
E.g., George v. Ericson, supra, 250 Conn. 324–25; State v.
Gonzalez, supra, 206 Conn. 408; State v. Cuvelier, 175 Conn.
100, 107–108, 394 A.2d 185 (1978). Facts of this nature may
come from sources such as conversations, informal opinions,
written reports and data compilations. Whether these facts are
of a type customarily relied on by experts in forming opinions
is a preliminary question to be decided by the trial court. See
Section 1-3 (a).

In a criminal case, when an expert opinion is based on facts
not in evidence, the court and parties should be aware of
constitutional concerns. See State v. Singh, 59 Conn. App.
638, 652–53, 757 A.2d 1175 (2000) (opinion based on informa-
tion provided by others does not violate confrontation clause
if expert is available for cross-examination concerning nature
and reasonableness of reliance), rev’d on other grounds, 259
Conn. 693, 793 A.2d 226 (2002); cf. In re Barbara J., 215
Conn. 31, 42–44, 574 A.2d 203 (1990) (admission of expert’s
report in termination of parental rights proceeding). This addi-
tional requirement, which is not included in subsection (b)
as an independent prerequisite under the Code, has been
mentioned in dicta in civil cases as well. See, e.g., R.I. Pools,

Inc. v. Paramount Concrete, Inc., 149 Conn. App. 839, 849,
89 A.3d 993 (‘‘[a]n expert may give an opinion based on
sources not in themselves admissible in evidence, provided
(1) the facts or data not in evidence are of a type reasonably
relied on by experts in the particular field, and (2) the expert is
available for cross-examination concerning his or her opinion’’
(internal quotation marks omitted)), cert. denied, 312 Conn.
920, 94 A.3d 1200 (2014); Birkhamshaw v. Socha, 156 Conn.
App. 453, 484, 115 A.3d 1 (same), cert. denied, 317 Conn.
913, 116 A.3d 812 (2015).

Subsection (b) expressly states that the facts forming the
basis of the expert opinion are not thereby made admissible
as substantive evidence (i.e., for their truth) unless otherwise
admissible as such under other provisions of the Code. See
Milliun v. New Milford Hospital, 310 Conn. 711, 726, 728, 80
A.3d 887 (2013). Thus, subsection (b) does not constitute
an exception to the hearsay rule or any other exclusionary
provision of
the Code. However, because subsection (a)
requires disclosure of a sufficient factual basis for the expert’s
opinion, and because the cross-examiner often will want to
explore the expert’s factual basis further, subsection (b) does
not preclude the trial court, in its discretion, from admitting the
underlying facts relied on by the expert for the limited purpose
of explaining the factual basis for the expert’s opinion. DeNun-
zio v. DeNunzio, 151 Conn. App. 403, 413, 95 A.3d 557 (2014),
aff’d, 320 Conn. 178, 128 A.3d 901 (2016).

(c) Hypothetical questions.
Subsection (c) embraces the common-law rule concerning
the admissibility of a hypothetical question and, necessarily,
the admissibility of the ensuing expert’s opinion in response
to the hypothetical question. Floyd v. Fruit Industries, Inc.,
supra, 144 Conn. 666; accord Shelnitz v. Greenberg, 200
Conn. 58, 77, 509 A.2d 1023 (1986); Schwartz v. Westport,
170 Conn. 223, 225, 365 A.2d 1151 (1976). In accordance
with case law, subsection (c) recognizes that the hypothetical
question must contain the essential facts of the case; see
State v. Gaynor, 182 Conn. 501, 509–10, 438 A.2d 739 (1980);
see also Keeney v. L & S Construction, supra, 226 Conn. 213
(‘‘the stated assumptions on which a hypothetical question is
based must be the essential facts established by the evi-
dence’’); but need not contain all the facts in evidence. E.g.,
Donch v. Kardos, supra, 149 Conn. 201; Stephanofsky v. Hill,
136 Conn. 379, 384, 71 A.2d 560 (1950).

Subsection (c) states the rule concerning the framing of
hypothetical questions on direct examination. See, e.g.,
Schwartz v. Westport, supra, 170 Conn. 224–25. The rules
governing the framing of hypothetical questions on direct
examination and for the purpose of introducing substantive
evidence are applied with increased liberality when the hypo-
thetical question is framed on cross-examination and for the
purpose of impeaching and testing the accuracy of the expert’s
opinion testimony given on direct examination. See, e.g., State
v. Gaynor, supra, 182 Conn. 510–11; Kirchner v. Yale Univer-
sity, 150 Conn. 623, 629, 192 A.2d 641 (1963); Livingstone
v. New Haven, 125 Conn. 123, 127–28, 3 A.2d 836 (1939);
Rice v. Dowling, 23 Conn. App. 460, 465, 581 A.2d 1061
(1990), cert. denied, 217 Conn. 805, 584 A.2d 1190 (1991).
Common law shall continue to govern the use of hypothetical
questions on cross-examination.

Sec. 8-1. Definitions

As used in this Article:
(1) ‘‘Statement’’ means (A) an oral or written
assertion or (B) nonverbal conduct of a person,
if it is intended by the person as an assertion.

(2) ‘‘Declarant’’ means a person who makes

a statement.

(3) ‘‘Hearsay’’ means a statement, other than
one made by the declarant while testifying at the
proceeding, offered in evidence to establish the
truth of the matter asserted.

COMMENTARY

(1) ‘‘Statement’’
The definition of ‘‘statement’’ takes on significance when
read in conjunction with the definition of ‘‘hearsay’’ in subdivi-
sion (3). The definition of ‘‘statement’’ includes both oral and
written assertions; see Rompe v. King, 185 Conn. 426, 428,
441 A.2d 114 (1981); Cherniske v. Jajer, 171 Conn. 372, 376,
370 A.2d 981 (1976); and nonverbal conduct of a person
intended as an assertion. State v. King, 249 Conn. 645, 670,
735 A.2d 267 (1999) (person nodding or shaking head in
response to question is form of nonverbal conduct intended
as assertion); see also State v. Blades, 225 Conn. 609, 632,
626 A.2d 273 (1993); Heritage Village Master Assn., Inc. v.
Heritage Village Water Co., 30 Conn. App. 693, 702, 622 A.2d
578 (1993). The effect of this definition is to exclude from
the hearsay rule’s purview nonassertive verbalizations and
nonassertive, nonverbal conduct. See State v. Hull, 210 Conn.
481, 498–99, 556 A.2d 154 (1989) (‘‘[i]f the statement is not
an assertion . . .
it is not hearsay’’ (internal quotation marks
omitted)); State v. Thomas, 205 Conn. 279, 285, 533 A.2d
553 (1987) (‘‘[n]onassertive conduct such as running to hide,
or shaking and trembling, is not hearsay’’).

The definition of ‘‘statement’’ in Section 8-1 is used solely
in conjunction with the definition of hearsay and the operation
of the hearsay rule and its exceptions. See generally Art.
VIII. The definition does not apply in other contexts or affect
definitions of ‘‘statement’’ in other provisions of the General
Statutes or the Practice Book. See, e.g., General Statutes
§ 53-441 (a); Practice Book §§ 13-1 and 40-15.

(2) ‘‘Declarant’’
The definition of ‘‘declarant’’

is consistent with the long-
standing common-law recognition of that term. See, e.g., State
v. Jarzbek, 204 Conn. 683, 696 n.7, 529 A.2d 1245 (1987),
cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1061, 108 S. Ct. 1017, 98 L. Ed. 2d
982 (1988); State v. Barlow, 177 Conn. 391, 396, 418 A.2d
46 (1979). Numerous courts have held that data generated
by a computer solely as a product of a computerized system
or process are not made by a ‘‘declarant’’ and, therefore, not
hearsay. See, e.g., State v. Buckland, 313 Conn. 205, 216–21,
96 A.3d 1163 (2014) (agreeing with federal cases holding that

‘‘raw data’’ generated by breath test machine are not hearsay
because machine is not declarant), cert. denied, 574 U.S.
1078, 135 S. Ct. 992, 190 L. Ed. 2d 837 (2015); State v.
Gojcaj, 151 Conn. App. 183, 195, 200–202, 92 A.3d 1056
(holding that making of computer generated log, which was
created automatically to record date and time whenever any
person entered passcode to activate or deactivate security
system, was not ‘‘statement by a human declarant’’ (internal
quotation marks omitted)), cert. denied, 314 Conn. 924, 100
A.3d 854 (2014); see also Lorraine v. Markel American Ins.
Co., 241 F.R.D. 534, 564–65 (D. Md. 2007) (fax header was not
statement by declarant). In certain forms, this type of computer
generated information is known as ‘‘metadata.’’ The term ‘‘met-
adata’’ has been defined as ‘‘data about data’’; (internal quota-
tion marks omitted) Lorraine v. Markel American Ins. Co.,
supra, 547; and refers to computer generated information
describing the history, tracking or management of electroni-
cally stored information. See id. Gojcaj recognized that a party
seeking to introduce computer generated data and records,
even if not hearsay, must establish that the computer system
reliably and accurately produces records or data of the type
that is being offered. State v. Gojcaj, supra, 202–203 n.12.

(3) ‘‘Hearsay’’
Subdivision (3)’s definition of ‘‘hearsay’’ finds support in
case law. E.g., State v. Crafts, 226 Conn. 237, 253, 627 A.2d
877 (1993); State v. Esposito, 223 Conn. 299, 315, 613 A.2d
242 (1992); Obermeier v. Nielsen, 158 Conn. 8, 11, 255 A.2d
819 (1969). The purpose for which the statement is offered
is crucial; if it is offered for a purpose other than to establish
the truth of the matter asserted, the statement is not hearsay.
E.g., State v. Esposito, supra, 315; State v. Hull, supra, 210
Conn. 498–99; State v. Ober, 24 Conn. App. 347, 357, 588
A.2d 1080, cert. denied, 219 Conn. 909, 593 A.2d 134, cert.
denied, 502 U.S. 915, 112 S. Ct. 319, 116 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1991).

Sec. 8-2. Hearsay Rule

(a) General rule. Hearsay is inadmissible,
except as provided in the Code, the General Stat-
utes or any Practice Book rule adopted before
June 18, 2014, the date on which the Supreme
Court adopted the Code.

(b) Testimonial statements and constitu-
tional right of confrontation. In criminal cases,
hearsay statements that might otherwise be
admissible under one of the exceptions in this
Article may be inadmissible if the admission of
such statements is in violation of the constitutional
right of confrontation.

(Amended Dec. 14, 2017, to take effect Feb. 1, 2018.)

COMMENTARY

(a) General rule.
Section 8-2 is consistent with common law. See, e.g., State
v. Oquendo, 223 Conn. 635, 664, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992); State

Connecticut Code of Evidence

v. Acquin, 187 Conn. 647, 680, 448 A.2d 163 (1982) (overruled
in part on other grounds by Davis v. United States, 512 U.S.
452, 114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362 (1994)), cert. denied,
463 U.S. 1229, 103 S. Ct. 3570, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1411 (1983);
General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Capitol Garage, Inc., 154
Conn. 593, 597, 227 A.2d 548 (1967).

In a few instances, the Practice Book contains rules of evi-
dence that may ostensibly conflict with Code provisions. The
Supreme Court has resolved any such conflict either through
decisional law or by formally adopting certain hearsay excep-
tions embodied in the rules of practice, adopted before June
18, 2014, the date on which the court adopted the Code. See,
e.g., Practice Book § 13-31 (a) (2) (deposition of certain health-
care providers is admissible, regardless of witness’ availabil-
ity); Practice Book § 13-31 (a) (3) (deposition of party or officer,
director, managing agent or employee testifying on behalf of
corporation, partnership or government agency is admissible
when used by adverse party for any purpose); Practice Book
§ 13-31 (a) (4) (deposition is admissible if, inter alia, witness
is more than thirty miles from place of trial); Practice Book
§ 25-60 (c) (report of evaluation or study in family matters
prepared pursuant to Practice Book § 25-60A or § 25-61 is
admissible if author is available for cross-examination); Prac-
tice Book § 35a-9 (social study in dispositional phase of child
neglect and termination of parental rights proceedings is
admissible, if author, if available, appears for cross-examina-
tion); see also Hibbard v. Hibbard, 139 Conn. App. 10, 15–16,
55 A.3d 301 (2012) (report and hearsay statements contained
therein are admissible under Practice Book § 25-60).

(b) Testimonial statements and constitutional right of

confrontation.

This subsection reflects the federal constitutional principle
announced in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 68–69,
124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004), which holds that
testimonial hearsay is admissible against a criminal defendant
at trial only if the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-
examine the declarant who is otherwise unavailable to testify
at trial. See U.S. Const., amends. VI and XIV; Conn. Const.,
art. I, § 8.

Sec. 8-3. Hearsay Exceptions: Availability of

Declarant Immaterial
The following are not excluded by the hearsay
rule, even though the declarant is available as
a witness:

(1) Statement by a party opponent. A state-
ment that is being offered against a party and is
(A) the party’s own statement, in either an individ-
ual or a representative capacity, (B) a statement
that the party has adopted or approved, (C) a
statement by a person authorized by the party to
make a statement concerning the subject, (D) a
statement by the party’s agent, servant or
employee, concerning a matter within the scope
of the agency or employment, and made during
the existence of the relationship, (E) a statement
by a coconspirator of a party while the conspiracy
is ongoing and in furtherance of the conspiracy,
(F) in an action for a debt for which the party was
surety, a statement by the party’s principal relating
to the principal’s obligations, or (G) a statement

made by a predecessor in title of the party, pro-
vided the declarant and the party are sufficiently
in privity that the statement of the declarant would
affect
in the property in
question.

the party’s interest

The hearsay statement itself may not be consid-
ered to establish the declarant’s authority under
(C), the existence or scope of the relationship
under (D), or the existence of the conspiracy or
participation in it under (E).

(2) Spontaneous utterance. A statement relat-
ing to a startling event or condition made while
the declarant was under the stress of excitement
caused by the event or condition.

(3) Statement of then existing physical con-
the declarant’s then
dition. A statement of
existing physical condition, provided that
the
statement is a natural expression of the condition
and is not a statement of memory or belief to
prove the fact remembered or believed.

(4) Statement of then existing mental or
emotional condition. A statement of the declar-
ant’s then existing mental or emotional condition,
including a statement indicating a present inten-
tion to do a particular act in the immediate future,
provided that the statement is a natural expres-
sion of the condition and is not a statement of
memory or belief to prove the fact remembered
or believed.

(5) Statement for purposes of obtaining
medical diagnosis or treatment. A statement
made for purposes of obtaining a medical diagno-
sis or treatment and describing medical history,
or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations,
or the inception or general character of the cause
or external source thereof, insofar as reasonably
pertinent to the medical diagnosis or treatment.
(6) Recorded recollection. A memorandum or
record concerning an event about which a witness
once had knowledge but now has insufficient rec-
ollection to enable the witness to testify fully and
accurately, shown to have been made or adopted
by the witness at or about the time of the event
recorded and to reflect that knowledge correctly.
(7) Public records and reports. Records,
reports, statements or data compilations, in any
form, of public offices or agencies, provided (A)
the record, report, statement or data compilation
was made by a public official under a duty to
make it, (B) the record, report, statement or data
compilation was made in the course of his or her
official duties, and (C) the official or someone with
a duty to transmit information to the official had
personal knowledge of the matters contained in
the record, report, statement or data compilation.
(8) Statement in learned treatises. To the
extent called to the attention of an expert witness

Connecticut Code of Evidence

on cross-examination or relied on by the expert
witness in direct examination, a statement con-
tained in a published treatise, periodical or pam-
phlet on a subject of history, medicine, or other
science or art, recognized as a standard authority
in the field by the witness, other expert witness
or judicial notice.

(9) Statement in ancient documents. A state-
ment in a document in existence for more than
thirty years if it is produced from proper custody

tions, tabulations, lists, directories or other pub-
lished compilations, that are recognized authority
on the subject, or are otherwise trustworthy.

of fact concerning personal or family history con-
tained in a family bible.

(12) Personal identification. Testimony by a

witness of his or her own name or age.

(Amended June 29, 2007, to take effect Jan. 1, 2008;

amended Dec. 14, 2017, to take effect Feb. 1, 2018.)

COMMENTARY
(1) Statement by party opponent.
Section 8-3 (1) sets forth six categories of party opponent
admissions that were excepted from the hearsay rule at com-
mon law and adds one more category that has been adopted
in the Federal Rules of Evidence and a majority of other states.
(A) The first category excepts from the hearsay rule a party’s
own statement when offered against him or her. E.g., In re
Zoarski, 227 Conn. 784, 796, 632 A.2d 1114 (1993); State v.
Woodson, 227 Conn. 1, 15, 629 A.2d 386 (1993). Under Sec-
tion 8-3 (1) (A), a statement is admissible against its maker,
whether he or she was acting in an individual or representative
capacity when the statement was made. The rule is in accord
with the modern trend. E.g., Fed. R. Evid. 801 (d) (2) (A). A
party statement is admissible under Section 8-3 (1), regardless
of whether the person making the statement has personal
knowledge of the facts stated therein. Dreier v. Upjohn Co.,
196 Conn. 242, 249, 492 A.2d 164 (1985). If the statement
at issue was made by a party opponent in a deposition, the
statement is admissible in accordance with Practice Book
§ 13-31 (a) (3). That provision permits an adverse party to
use at trial, for any purpose, the deposition of a party, or a
person who at the time of the deposition was an officer, direc-
tor, managing agent or employee of a party, or a person desig-
nated under Practice Book § 13-27 (h) to testify on behalf of
a public or private corporation, partnership, association or
government agency. This rule of practice was deemed ‘‘analo-
gous’’ to the hearsay exception covered by Section 8-3 (1) in
Gateway Co. v. DiNoia, 232 Conn. 223, 238 n.11, 654 A.2d
342 (1995) (construing Practice Book (1978–97) § 248 (1) (c),
predecessor to Practice Book § 13-31 (a) (3)).

(B) The second category recognizes the common-law hear-
say exception for ‘‘adoptive admissions.’’ See, e.g., State v.
John, 210 Conn. 652, 682–83, 557 A.2d 93, cert. denied, 493
U.S. 824, 110 S. Ct. 84, 107 L. Ed. 2d 50 (1989); Falker v.
Samperi, 190 Conn. 412, 426, 461 A.2d 681 (1983). Because
adoption or approval may be implicit; see, e.g., State v. Moye,
199 Conn. 389, 393–94, 507 A.2d 1001 (1986); the common-
law hearsay exception for tacit admissions, under which
silence or a failure to respond to another person’s statement
may constitute an admission; e.g., State v. Morrill, 197 Conn.

507, 535, 498 A.2d 76 (1985); Obermeier v. Nielsen, 158
Conn. 8, 11–12, 255 A.2d 819 (1969); is carried forward in
Section 8-3 (1) (B). The admissibility of tacit admissions in
criminal cases is subject to the evidentiary limitations on the
use of an accused’s postarrest silence; see State v. Ferrone,
97 Conn. 258, 266, 116 A. 336 (1922); and the constitutional
limitations on the use of the accused’s post-Miranda warning
silence. Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 617–19, 96 S. Ct. 2240,
49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976); see, e.g., State v. Zeko, 177 Conn.
545, 554, 418 A.2d 917 (1979).

(C) The third category restates the common-law hearsay
exception for ‘‘authorized admissions.’’ See, e.g., Presta v.
Monnier, 145 Conn. 694, 699, 146 A.2d 404 (1958); Collins
v. Lewis, 111 Conn. 299, 305–306, 149 A. 668 (1930). For this
exception to apply, the speaker must have actual or apparent
authority to speak concerning the subject upon which he or she
speaks in the declaration at issue; a mere agency relationship
(e.g., employer-employee), without more, is not enough to
confer such authority. E.g., Liebman v. Society of Our Lady
of Mount St. Carmel, Inc., 151 Conn. 582, 586, 200 A.2d 721
(1964); Munson v. United Technologies Corp., 28 Conn. App.
184, 188, 609 A.2d 1066 (1992); cf. Graham v. Wilkins, 145
Conn. 34, 40–41, 138 A.2d 705 (1958); Haywood v. Hamm,
77 Conn. 158, 159, 58 A. 695 (1904). The proponent need
not, however, show that the speaker was authorized to make
the particular statement sought to be introduced. The exis-
tence of authority to speak for the principal is to be determined
by reference to the substantive law of agency. See, e.g., Acker-
man v. Sobol Family Partnership, LLP, 298 Conn. 495,
507–12, 4 A.3d 288 (2010) (applying principles of agency
law to conclude that attorney had authority to bind client to
settlement). Although not expressly mentioned in the excep-
tion, the Code in no way abrogates the common-law rule that
speaking authority must be established without reference to
the purported agent’s out-of-court statements, save when
those statements are independently admissible. See Section
1-1 (d) (2); see generally Robles v. Lavin, 176 Conn. 281,
284, 407 A.2d 957 (1978).

(D) The fourth category encompasses the exception set
forth in rule 801 (d) (2) (D) of the Federal Rules of Evidence
and adopted in a majority of state jurisdictions. The notes of
the advisory committee on the 1972 proposed rules express
‘‘[d]issatisfaction’’ with the traditional rule requiring proof that
the agent had actual authority to make the offered statement
on behalf of the principal. The advisory committee notes cite
to ‘‘[a] substantial trend [that] favors admitting statements
related to a matter within the scope of the agency or employ-
ment. Grayson v. Williams, 256 F.2d 61 [66] (10th Cir. 1958);
[see also Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij N.V. KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines Holland] v. Tuller, [292 F.2d 775, 783–84 (D.C.
Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 921, 82 S. Ct. 243, 7 L. Ed. 2d
136] (1961); Martin v. [Savage Truck Line, Inc.], 121 F. Supp.
417 [418–19] (D.D.C. 1954), and numerous state court deci-
sions collected in 4 [J. Wigmore, Evidence (4th Ed. 1972)
§ 1078, pp. 166–69 n.2] . . . . ’’ Fed. R. Evid. 801 (d) (2) (D),
advisory committee notes. This trend has continued since
then. See, e.g., B & K Rentals & Sales Co. v. Universal Leaf
Tobacco Co., 324 Md. 147, 158, 596 A.2d 640 (1991) (adopting
federal approach and observing that ‘‘[t]he authorities, both
courts and commentators, have almost universally con-
demned the strict [common-law] rule in favor of the .
.
rule set forth in [rule 801 (d) (2) (D) of the Federal Rules of
Evidence]’’). Connecticut now adopts the modern rule as well,
and, in doing so, overrules the line of cases adhering to the
common law in requiring proof that the declarant was author-
ized to speak on behalf of the employer or principal. See, e.g.,
Cascella v. Jay James Camera Shop, Inc., 147 Conn. 337,

615, 617–18, 30 A.2d 545 (1943).

(E) The fifth category encompasses the hearsay exception
for statements of coconspirators. E.g., State v. Peeler, 267
Conn. 611, 628–34, 841 A.2d 181 (2004); State v. Couture,
218 Conn. 309, 322, 589 A.2d 343 (1991); State v. Pelletier,
209 Conn. 564, 577, 552 A.2d 805 (1989); see also State v.
Vessichio, 197 Conn. 644, 654–55, 500 A.2d 1311 (1985)
(additional foundational elements include existence of conspir-
acy and participation therein by both declarant and party
against whom statement is offered), cert. denied, 475 U.S.
1122, 106 S. Ct. 1642, 90 L. Ed. 2d 187 (1986). The exception
is applicable in civil and criminal cases alike. See Cooke v.
Weed, 90 Conn. 544, 548, 97 A. 765 (1916). The proponent
must prove the foundational elements by a preponderance of
the evidence and independently of the hearsay statements
sought to be introduced. See, e.g., State v. Carpenter, 275
Conn. 785, 843, 882 A.2d 604 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S.
1025, 126 S. Ct. 1578, 164 L. Ed. 2d 309 (2006); State v.
Vessichio, supra, 655; State v. Haggood, 36 Conn. App. 753,
767, 653 A.2d 216, cert. denied, 233 Conn. 904, 657 A.2d
644 (1995).

(F) The sixth category of party opponent admissions is
derived from Agricultural Ins. Co. v. Keeler, 44 Conn. 161,
162–64 (1876).

(G) The final category incorporates the common-law hear-
say exception applied in Pierce v. Roberts, 57 Conn. 31,
40–41, 17 A. 275 (1888), and Ramsbottom v. Phelps, 18 Conn.
278, 285 (1847).

(2) Spontaneous utterance.
The hearsay exception for spontaneous utterances is well
established. See, e.g., State v. Stange, 212 Conn. 612,
616–17, 563 A.2d 681 (1989); Cascella v. Jay James Camera
Shop, Inc., supra, 147 Conn. 341–42; Perry v. Haritos, 100
Conn. 476, 483–84, 124 A. 44 (1924). Although the language
of Section 8-3 (2) is not identical to the language used in pre-
Code cases to describe the exception; cf. State v. Stange,
supra, 616–17; Rockhill v. White Line Bus Co., 109 Conn.
706, 709, 145 A. 504 (1929); Perry v. Haritos, supra, 484;
State v. Guess, 44 Conn. App. 790, 803, 692 A.2d 849 (1997),
aff’d, 244 Conn. 761, 715 A.2d 643 (1998); the provision incor-
porates the same principles. See, e.g., State v. Kirby, 280
Conn. 361, 373–77, 908 A.2d 506 (2006).

The event or condition triggering the utterance must be
sufficiently startling, so ‘‘as to produce nervous excitement in
the declarant and render [the declarant’s] utterances sponta-
neous and unreflective.’’ State v. Rinaldi, 220 Conn. 345, 359,
599 A.2d 1 (1991).

(3) Statement of then existing physical condition.
Section 8-3 (3) embraces the hearsay exception for state-
ments of then existing physical condition. Martin v. Sherwood,
74 Conn. 475, 481–82, 51 A. 526 (1902); State v. Dart, 29
Conn. 153, 155 (1860); see McCarrick v. Kealy, 70 Conn. 642,
645, 40 A. 603 (1898).

feels at

The exception is limited to statements of then existing physi-
cal condition, whereby the declarant describes how the declar-
ant
the time the declarant makes the hearsay
statement. Statements concerning past physical condition;
Martin v. Sherwood, supra, 74 Conn. 482; State v. Dart, supra,
29 Conn. 155; or the events leading up to or the cause of a
present condition; McCarrick v. Kealy, supra, 70 Conn. 645;
are not admissible under this exception. Cf. Section 8-3 (5)
(exception for statements made to physician for purpose of
obtaining medical treatment or advice and describing past or
present bodily condition or cause thereof).

(4) Statement of then existing mental or emotional con-

dition.

Section 8-3 (4) embodies what is frequently referred to as
the ‘‘state of mind’’ exception to the hearsay rule. See, e.g.,
State v. Periere, 186 Conn. 599, 605–606, 442 A.2d 1345
(1982).

The exception allows the admission of a declarant’s state-
ment describing his or her then existing mental or emotional
condition when the declarant’s mental or emotional condition
is a relevant issue in the case. See, e.g., State v. Perkins,
271 Conn. 218, 256–59, 856 A.2d 917 (2004) (defendant’s
state of mind at time of hearsay statement was not relevant
to any issue in case); State v. Periere, supra, 186 Conn.
606–607 (relevant to show declarant’s fear). Only statements
describing then existing mental or emotional condition, i.e.,
that existing when the statement is made, are admissible.

The exception also covers a declarant’s statement of pre-
sent intention to perform a subsequent act as an inference
the subsequent act actually occurred. E.g., State v.
that
Rinaldi, 220 Conn. 345, 358 n.7, 599 A.2d 1 (1991); State v.
Santangelo, 205 Conn. 578, 592, 534 A.2d 1175 (1987); State
v. Journey, 115 Conn. 344, 351, 161 A. 515 (1932). The
inference drawn from the statement of present intention that
the act actually occurred is a matter of relevancy rather than
a hearsay concern.

When a statement describes the declarant’s intention to do
a future act in concert with another person, e.g., ‘‘I am going
to meet Ralph at the store at ten,’’ the case law does not
prohibit admissibility. See State v. Santangelo, supra, 205
Conn. 592. But the declaration can be admitted only to prove
the declarant’s subsequent conduct, not to show what the
other person ultimately did. State v. Perelli, 125 Conn. 321,
325, 5 A.2d 705 (1939). Thus, in the previous example, the
declarant’s statement could be used to infer that the declarant
actually did go to meet Ralph at the store at ten but not to
show that Ralph went to the store at ten to meet the declarant.
Placement of Section 8-3 (4) in the ‘‘availability of the declar-
ant immaterial’’ category of hearsay exceptions confirms that
the admissibility of statements of present intention to show
future acts is not conditioned on any requirement that the
declarant be unavailable. See State v. Santangelo, supra, 205
Conn. 592 (dictum suggesting that declarant’s unavailability
is precondition to admissibility).

While statements of present intention looking forward to the
doing of some future act are admissible under the exception,
backward looking statements of memory or belief offered to
prove the act or event remembered or believed are inadmissi-
ble. See Wade v. Yale University, supra, 129 Conn. 618–19;
but see State v. Santangelo, supra, 205 Conn. 592–93. As
the advisory committee notes to the corresponding federal
rule suggests, ‘‘[t]he exclusion of ‘statements of memory or
belief to prove the fact remembered or believed’ is necessary
to avoid the virtual destruction of the hearsay rule which would
otherwise result from allowing state of mind, provable by a
hearsay statement, to serve as the basis for an inference of
the happening of the event which produced the state of mind.’’
Fed. R. Evid. 803 (3), advisory committee notes, citing Shep-
ard v. United States, 290 U.S. 96, 54 S. Ct. 22, 78 L. Ed. 196
(1933). For cases dealing with the admissibility of statements
of memory or belief in will cases, see Spencer’s Appeal, 77
Conn. 638, 643, 60 A. 289 (1905), Vivian Appeal, 74 Conn.
257, 260–62, 50 A. 797 (1901), and Comstock v. Hadlyme
Ecclesiastical Society, 8 Conn. 254, 263–64 (1830). Cf. Bab-
cock v. Johnson, 127 Conn. 643, 644, 19 A.2d 416 (1941)
(statements admissible only as circumstantial evidence of
state of mind and not for truth of matter asserted); In re John-
son’s Will, 40 Conn. 587, 588 (1873) (same).

(5) Statement for purposes of obtaining medical diagno-

sis or treatment.

Statements made in furtherance of obtaining a medical diag-
nosis or treatment are excepted from the hearsay rule. E.g.,
State v. DePastino, 228 Conn. 552, 565, 638 A.2d 578 (1994).
This is true even if diagnosis or treatment is not the primary
purpose of the medical examination or the principal motivation
for the statement; State v. Griswold, 160 Conn. App. 528,
552–53, 556–57, 127 A.3d 189 (statements made during
forensic interview in child sexual abuse context), cert. denied,
320 Conn. 907, 128 A.3d 952 (2015); as long as the statement
is ‘‘reasonably pertinent’’ to obtaining diagnosis or treatment.
Id., 556.

It is intended that the term ‘‘medical’’ be read broadly so that
the exception would cover statements made for the purpose
of obtaining diagnosis or treatment for both somatic and psy-
chological maladies and conditions. See State v. Wood, 208
Conn. 125, 133–34, 545 A.2d 1026, cert. denied, 488 U.S.
895, 109 S. Ct. 235, 102 L. Ed. 2d 225 (1988).

Statements concerning the cause of an injury or condition
traditionally were inadmissible under the exception. See Smith
v. Hausdorf, 92 Conn. 579, 582, 103 A. 939 (1918). Subse-
quent cases recognize that, in some instances, causation may
be pertinent to medical diagnosis or treatment. See State v.
Daniels, 13 Conn. App. 133, 135, 534 A.2d 1253 (1987); cf.
State v. DePastino, supra, 228 Conn. 565. Section 8-3 (5)
thus excepts from the hearsay rule statements describing ‘‘the
inception or general character of the cause or external source’’
of an injury or condition when reasonably pertinent to medical
diagnosis or treatment.

Statements as to causation that include the identity of the
person responsible for the injury or condition ordinarily are
neither relevant to nor in furtherance of the patient’s medical
treatment. State v. DePastino, supra, 228 Conn. 565; State
v. Dollinger, 20 Conn. App. 530, 534, 568 A.2d 1058, cert.
denied, 215 Conn. 805, 574 A.2d 220 (1990). Connecticut
courts have recognized an exception to this principle in cases
of domestic child abuse. State v. DePastino, supra, 565; State
v. Dollinger, supra, 534–35; State v. Maldonado, 13 Conn.
App. 368, 372–74, 536 A.2d 600, cert. denied, 207 Conn. 808,
541 A.2d 1239 (1988). The courts reason that, ‘‘[i]n cases of
sexual abuse in the home, hearsay statements made in the
course of medical treatment which reveal the identity of the
abuser, are reasonably pertinent to treatment and are admissi-
ble. . . .
If the sexual abuser is a member of the child victim’s
immediate household, it is reasonable for a physician to ascer-
tain the identity of the abuser to prevent recurrences and to
facilitate the treatment of psychological and physical injuries.’’
(Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) State v.
Dollinger, supra, 535, quoting State v. Maldonado, supra, 374;
accord State v. DePastino, supra, 565. In 2001, this reasoning
was extended to apply the exception to adult victims of sexual
abuse as well. State v. Kelly, 256 Conn. 23, 45, 770 A.2d 908
(2001). ‘‘In any sexual assault, the identity of the perpetrator
undoubtedly is relevant to the physician to facilitate the treat-
ment of psychological and physical
(Emphasis
added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.

injuries.’’

Traditionally,

the exception seemingly required that

the
statement be made to a physician. See, e.g., Wilson v. Granby,
47 Conn. 59, 76 (1879). Statements qualifying under Section
8-3 (5), however, may be those made not only to a physician,
but to other persons involved in the treatment of the patient,
such as a nurse, a paramedic, an interpreter or even a family
member. This approach is in accord with the modern trend.
See State v. Maldonado, supra, 13 Conn. App. 369, 374 n.3
(statement by child abuse victim who spoke only Spanish

made to Spanish speaking hospital security guard enlisted by
treating physician as translator).

Common-law cases address the admissibility of statements
made only by the patient. E.g., Gilmore v. American Tube &
Stamping Co., 79 Conn. 498, 504, 66 A. 4 (1907). Section 8-
3 (5) does not, by its terms, restrict statements admissible
under the exception to those made by the patient. For example,
if a parent were to bring his or her unconscious child into an
emergency room, statements made by the parent to a health-
care provider for the purpose of obtaining treatment and perti-
nent to that treatment fall within the scope of the exception.
Early common law distinguished between statements made
to physicians consulted for the purpose of treatment and state-
ments made to physicians consulted solely for the purpose of
testifying as an expert witness. Statements made to these so-
called ‘‘nontreating’’ physicians were not accorded substantive
effect. See, e.g., Zawisza v. Quality Name Plate, Inc., 149
Conn. 115, 119, 176 A.2d 578 (1961); Rowland v. Philadelphia,
Wilmington & Baltimore Railroad Co., 63 Conn. 415, 418–19,
28 A. 102 (1893). This distinction was eliminated by the court
in George v. Ericson, 250 Conn. 312, 324–25, 736 A.2d 889
(1999), which held that nontreating physicians could rely on
such statements. The distinction between admission only as
foundation for the expert’s opinion and admission for all pur-
poses was considered too inconsequential
to maintain.
Accordingly, the word ‘‘diagnosis’’ was added to, and the
the
phrase ‘‘advice pertaining thereto’’ was deleted from,
phrase ‘‘medical treatment or advice pertaining thereto’’
in
Section 8-3 (5).

(6) Recorded recollection.
The hearsay exception for past

recollection recorded
requires four foundational requirements. First, the witness
must have had personal knowledge of the event recorded in
the memorandum or record. Papas v. Aetna Ins. Co., 111
Conn. 415, 420, 150 A. 310 (1930); Jackiewicz v. United Illumi-
nating Co., 106 Conn. 302, 309, 138 A. 147 (1927); Neff v.
Neff, 96 Conn. 273, 278, 114 A. 126 (1921).

Second, the witness’ present recollection must be insuffi-
cient to enable the witness to testify fully and accurately about
the event recorded. State v. Boucino, 199 Conn. 207, 230, 506
A.2d 125 (1986). The rule thus does not require the witness’
memory to be totally exhausted. See id. Earlier cases to the
contrary, such as Katsonas v. W. M. Sutherland Building &
Contracting Co., 104 Conn. 54, 69, 132 A. 553 (1926), appar-
ently have been rejected. See State v. Boucino, supra, 230.
‘‘Insufficient recollection’’ may be established by demonstra-
ting that an attempt to refresh the witness’ recollection pursu-
ant to Section 6-9 (a) was unsuccessful. See Katsonas v. W.
M. Sutherland Building & Contracting Co., supra, 69.

Third, the memorandum or record must have been made
or adopted by the witness ‘‘at or about the time’’ the event
was recorded. Gigliotti v. United Illuminating Co., 151 Conn.
114, 124, 193 A.2d 718 (1963); Neff v. Neff, supra, 96 Conn.
278; State v. Day, 12 Conn. App. 129, 134, 529 A.2d 1333
(1987).

Finally, the memorandum or record must accurately reflect
the witness’ knowledge of the event as it existed at the time
of the memorandum’s or record’s making or adoption. See
State v. Vennard, 159 Conn. 385, 397, 270 A.2d 837 (1970)
(overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Ferrell, 191
Conn. 37, 463 A.2d 573 (1983)), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 1011,
91 S. Ct. 576, 27 L. Ed. 2d 625 (1971); Capone v. Sloan, 149
Conn. 538, 543, 182 A.2d 414 (1962); Hawken v. Daley, 85
Conn. 16, 19, 81 A. 1053 (1911); see also State v. Juan V.,
109 Conn. App. 431, 441 n.9, 951 A.2d 651 (‘‘[p]roving that
the record was accurate at the time it was made is an essential

Sec. 8-3

Connecticut Code of Evidence

element of this exception’’), cert. denied, 289 Conn. 931, 958
A.2d 161 (2008).

A memorandum or record admissible under the exception
may be read into evidence and received as an exhibit. Katso-
nas v. W. M. Sutherland Building & Contracting Co., supra,
104 Conn. 69; see Neff v. Neff, supra, 96 Conn. 278–79.
Because a memorandum or record introduced under the
exception is being offered to prove its contents, the original
must be produced pursuant to Section 10-1, unless its produc-
tion is excused. See Sections 10-3 through 10-6; cf. Neff v.
Neff, supra, 278.

Multiple person involvement in recordation and observation
of the event recorded is contemplated by the exception. For
example, A reports to B an event A has just observed. B
immediately writes down what A reported to him. A then exam-
ines the writing and adopts it as accurate close to the time of
its making. A is now testifying and has forgotten the event. A
may independently establish the foundational requirements
for the admission of the writing under Section 8-3 (6). Cf.
Curtis v. Bradley, 65 Conn. 99, 105–107, 31 A. 591 (1894).
The past recollection recorded exception to the hearsay
rule is to be distinguished from the procedure for refreshing
recollection, which is covered in Section 6-9.

(7) Public records and reports.
Section 8-3 (7) sets forth a hearsay exception for certain
public records and reports. The exception is derived primarily
from common law although public records and reports remain
the subject of numerous statutes. See, e.g., General Statutes
§§ 12-39bb and 19a-412.

Although Connecticut has neither precisely nor consistently
defined the elements comprising the common-law public
records exception to the hearsay rule; cf. Hing Wan Wong v.
Liquor Control Commission, 160 Conn. 1, 9, 273 A.2d 709
(1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 938, 91 S. Ct. 931, 28 L. Ed.
2d 218 (1971); Section 8-3 (7) gleans from case law three
distinct requirements for substantive admissibility. Proviso (A)
is found in cases such as Hing Wan Wong v. Liquor Control
Commission, supra, 9, Russo v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.,
125 Conn. 132, 139, 3 A.2d 844 (1939), and Ezzo v. Geremiah,
107 Conn. 670, 679–80, 142 A. 461 (1928). Proviso (B) comes
from cases such as Gett v. Isaacson, 98 Conn. 539, 543–44,
120 A. 156 (1923), and Enfield v. Ellington, 67 Conn. 459,
462, 34 A. 818 (1896). Proviso (C) is derived from Heritage
Village Master Assn., Inc. v. Heritage Village Water Co., 30
Conn. App. 693, 701, 622 A.2d 578 (1993), and from cases
in which public records had been admitted under the business
records exception. See, e.g., State v. Palozie, 165 Conn. 288,
294–95, 334 A.2d 458 (1973); Mucci v. LeMonte, 157 Conn.
566, 569, 254 A.2d 879 (1969).

The ‘‘duty’’ under which public officials act, as contemplated
by proviso (A), often is one imposed by statute. See, e.g.,
Lawrence v. Kozlowski, 171 Conn. 705, 717–18, 372 A.2d
110 (1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 969, 97 S. Ct. 2930, 53
L. Ed. 2d 1066 (1977); Hing Wan Wong v. Liquor Control
Commission, supra, 160 Conn. 8–10. Nevertheless, Section
8-3 (7) does not preclude the recognition of other sources
of duties.

Proviso (C) anticipates the likelihood that more than one
individual may be involved in the making of the public record.
By analogy to the personal knowledge requirement imposed
in the business records context; e.g., In re Barbara J., 215
Conn. 31, 40, 574 A.2d 203 (1990); proviso (C) demands that
the public record be made upon the personal knowledge of
either the public official who made the record or someone, such
as a subordinate, whose duty it was to relay that information
to the public official. See, e.g., State v. Palozie, supra, 165

Conn. 294–95 (public record introduced under business
records exception).

(8) Statement in learned treatises.
Exception (8) explicitly permits the substantive use of state-
ments contained in published treatises, periodicals or pam-
phlets on direct examination or cross-examination under the
circumstances prescribed in the rule. In the case of a journal
article, the requirement that the treatise is recognized as a
‘‘standard authority in the field’’; (internal quotation marks omit-
ted) Filippelli v. Saint Mary’s Hospital, 319 Conn. 113, 136,
124 A.3d 501 (2015); generally requires proof that the specific
article at issue is so recognized. See id., 137–38; Musorofiti
v. Vlcek, 65 Conn. App. 365, 382–85, 783 A.2d 36, cert.
denied, 258 Conn. 938, 786 A.2d 426 (2001). There may be
situations, however, in which a journal is so highly regarded
that a presumption of authoritativeness will arise with respect
to an article selected for publication in that journal without any
additional showing. See Filippelli v. Saint Mary’s Hospital,
supra, 138.

Although most of the earlier decisions concerned the use
of medical treatises; e.g., Cross v. Huttenlocher, 185 Conn.
390, 395, 440 A.2d 952 (1981); Perez v. Mount Sinai Hospital,
7 Conn. App. 514, 520, 509 A.2d 552 (1986); Section 8-3 (8),
by its terms, is not limited to that one subject matter or format.
Ames v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 8 Conn. App. 642, 650–51,
514 A.2d 352 (published technical papers on design and oper-
ation of riding lawnmowers), cert. denied, 201 Conn. 809, 515
A.2d 378 (1986).

Connecticut allows the jury to receive the treatise, or portion
thereof, as a full exhibit. Cross v. Huttenlocher, supra, 185
Conn. 395–96; see State v. Gupta, 297 Conn. 211, 239, 998
A.2d 1085 (2010). If admitted, the excerpts from the published
work may be read into evidence or received as an exhibit, as
the court permits. See Cross v. Huttenlocher, supra, 395–96;
see also Filippelli v. Saint Mary’s Hospital, supra, 319 Conn.
138–41 (trial court has discretion to require redaction so that
only portion of article is admitted as full exhibit).

(9) Statement in ancient documents.
The hearsay exception for statements in ancient documents
is well established. Jarboe v. Home Bank & Trust Co., 91
Conn. 265, 270–71, 99 A. 563 (1917); New York, New Haven &
Hartford Railroad Co. v. Cella, 88 Conn. 515, 520, 91 A. 972
(1914); see Clark v. Drska, 1 Conn. App. 481, 489, 473 A.2d
325 (1984).

The exception, by its terms, applies to all kinds of docu-
ments, including documents produced by electronic means,
and electronically stored information, and is not limited to docu-
ments affecting an interest in property. See Petroman v. Ander-
son, 105 Conn. 366, 369–70, 135 A. 391 (1926) (ancient map
introduced under exception).

‘‘[M]ore than thirty years’’ means any instant of time beyond
the point in time at which the document has been in existence
for thirty years.

(10) Published compilations.
Connecticut cases have recognized an exception to the
hearsay rule—or at least have assumed that an exception
exists—for these items. Henry v. Kopf, 104 Conn. 73, 80–81,
131 A. 412 (1925) (market reports); see State v. Pambianchi,
139 Conn. 543, 548, 95 A.2d 695 (1953) (compilation of used
automobile prices); Donoghue v. Smith, 114 Conn. 64, 66,
157 A. 415 (1931) (mortality tables).
(11) Statement in family bible.
Connecticut has recognized, at least in dictum, an exception
to the hearsay rule for factual statements concerning personal
or family history contained in family bibles. See Eva v. Gough,
93 Conn. 38, 46, 104 A. 238 (1918).

(12) Personal identification.
A witness’ in-court statement of his or her own name or age
is admissible, even though knowledge of this information often
is based on hearsay. Blanchard v. Bridgeport, 190 Conn. 798,
806, 463 A.2d 553 (1983) (name); Toletti v. Bidizcki, 118 Conn.
531, 534, 173 A. 223 (1934) (name), overruled in part on other
grounds by Petrillo v. Maiuri, 138 Conn. 557, 86 A.2d 869
(1952); State v. Hyatt, 9 Conn. App. 426, 429, 519 A.2d 612
(1987) (age); see Creer v. Active Auto Exchange, Inc., 99
Conn. 266, 276, 121 A. 888 (1923) (age).

Sec. 8-4. Admissibility of Business Entries
and Photographic Copies: Availability of
Declarant Immaterial
‘‘(a) [Business records admissible.] Any writ-
ing or record, whether in the form of an entry in
a book or otherwise, made as a memorandum or
record of any act,
transaction, occurrence or
event, shall be admissible as evidence of the act,
transaction, occurrence or event, if the trial judge
finds that it was made in the regular course of any
business, and that it was the regular course of
the business to make the writing or record at the
time of the act, transaction, occurrence or event
or within a reasonable time thereafter.

‘‘(b) [Witness need not be available.] The
writing or record shall not be rendered inadmissi-
ble by (1) a party’s failure to produce as witnesses
the person or persons who made the writing or
record, or who have personal knowledge of the
act, transaction, occurrence or event recorded or
(2) the party’s failure to show that such persons
are unavailable as witnesses. Either of such facts
and all other circumstances of the making of the
writing or record, including lack of personal knowl-
edge by the entrant or maker, may be shown to
affect the weight of the evidence, but not to affect
its admissibility.

‘‘(c) [Reproductions admissible.] Except as
provided in the Freedom of Information Act, as
defined in [General Statutes §] 1-200, if any per-
son in the regular course of business has kept or
recorded any memorandum, writing, entry, print,
representation or combination thereof, of any act,
transaction, occurrence or event, and in the regu-
lar course of business has caused any or all of
them to be recorded, copied or reproduced by any
photographic, photostatic, microfilm, microcard,
miniature photographic or other process which
accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium
for so reproducing the original, the original may
be destroyed in the regular course of business
unless its preservation is otherwise required by
statute. The reproduction, when satisfactorily
identified, shall be as admissible in evidence as
the original in any judicial or administrative pro-
ceeding, whether the original is in existence or

not, and an enlargement or facsimile of the repro-
duction shall be likewise admissible in evidence
if the original reproduction is in existence and
available for inspection under direction of court.
The introduction of a reproduced record, enlarge-
ment or facsimile shall not preclude admission of
the original.

‘‘(d) [Definition.] The term ‘business’ shall
include business, profession, occupation and call-
ing of every kind.’’ General Statutes § 52-180.

COMMENTARY
Section 8-4 sets forth what is commonly known as the busi-
ness records or business entries exception to the hearsay
rule. Section 8-4 quotes General Statutes § 52-180, which
embraces modified versions of the 1927 Model Act for Proof
of Business Transactions and the Photographic Copies of
Business and Public Records as Evidence Act.

Subsection (a) describes the foundational elements a court
must find for a business record to qualify under the exception.
E.g., River Dock & Pile, Inc. v. O & G Industries, Inc., 219
Conn. 787, 793–94, 595 A.2d 839 (1991); Emhart Industries,
Inc. v. Amalgamated Local Union 376, U.A.W., 190 Conn.
371, 383–84, 461 A.2d 442 (1983). The Supreme Court has
interpreted § 52-180 to embrace an additional foundational
requirement not found in the express terms of the exception:
that the source of the information recorded be the entrant’s
own observations or the observations of an informant who
had a business duty to furnish the information to the entrant.
E.g., In re Barbara J., 215 Conn. 31, 40, 574 A.2d 203 (1990);
State v. Milner, 206 Conn. 512, 521, 539 A.2d 80 (1988);
Mucci v. LeMonte, 157 Conn. 566, 569, 254 A.2d 879 (1969).
If this requirement is not met, ‘‘it adds another level of hearsay
to the [document] which necessitates a separate exception to
the hearsay rule . . . .’’ (Internal quotation marks omitted.)
State v. George J., 280 Conn. 551, 593–94, 910 A.2d. 931
(2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1326, 127 S. Ct. 1919, 167 L.
Ed. 2d 573 (2007).

Business records increasingly are created, stored or pro-
duced by computer. Section 8-4 is applicable to electronically
stored information, and, properly authenticated, such records
are admissible if the elements of Section 8-4 (a) have been
met. See Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Carabetta, 55 Conn.
App. 369, 376–77, 739 A.2d 301, cert. denied, 251 Conn. 927,
742 A.2d 362 (1999). In addition to satisfying the standard
requirements of the business record exception to the hearsay
rule, a proponent offering computerized business records will
be required to establish that the computer system reliably and
accurately produces records or data of the type that is being
offered. See generally Connecticut Light & Power Co. v. Gil-
more, 289 Conn. 88, 116–18, 956 A.2d 1145 (2008) (computer
printout and letter containing results of electric meter testing);
American Oil Co. v. Valenti, 179 Conn. 349, 356, 360–61, 426
A.2d 305 (1979) (computer records of loan account informa-
tion); Silicon Valley Bank v. Miracle Faith World Outreach,
Inc., 140 Conn. App. 827, 835–37, 60 A.3d 343 (computer
screenshots of loan transaction history), cert. denied, 308
Conn. 930, 64 A.3d 119 (2013); see also State v. Polanco,
69 Conn. App. 169, 185–86, 797 A.2d 523 (2002) (proponent of
computer generated business records is required to establish
accuracy and reliability of computer system). The court may
also require evidence establishing that the circumstances sur-
rounding the creation and maintenance of the records ade-
quately ensures their trustworthiness and reliability. Cf. Emi-
grant Mortgage Co. v. D’Agostino, 94 Conn. App. 793, 809–11,
896 A.2d 814, cert. denied, 278 Conn. 919, 901 A.2d 43 (2006).

Sec. 8-5. Hearsay Exceptions: Declarant

Must Be Available
The following are not excluded by the hearsay
rule, provided the declarant is available for cross-
examination at trial:

(1) Prior inconsistent statement. A prior
inconsistent statement of a witness, provided (A)
the statement is in writing or otherwise recorded
by audiotape, videotape or some other equally
reliable medium, (B) the writing or recording is
duly authenticated as that of the witness, and (C)
the witness has personal knowledge of the con-
tents of the statement.

(2) Identification of a person. The identifica-
tion of a person made by a declarant prior to trial
where the identification is reliable.

(Amended June 29, 2007, to take effect Jan. 1, 2008.)

COMMENTARY

(1) Prior inconsistent statement.
Section 8-5 (1) incorporates the rule of State v. Whelan,
200 Conn. 743, 753, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994,
107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986), and later develop-
ments and clarifications. State v. Simpson, 286 Conn. 634,
642, 945 A.2d 449 (2008); see, e.g., State v. Hopkins, 222
Conn. 117, 126, 609 A.2d 236 (1992) (prior inconsistent state-
ment must be made under circumstances assuring reliability,
which is to be determined on case-by-case basis); State v.
Holloway, 209 Conn. 636, 649, 553 A.2d 166 (tape-recorded
statement admissible under Whelan), cert. denied, 490 U.S.
1071, 109 S. Ct. 2078, 104 L. Ed. 2d 643 (1989); State v. Luis
F., 85 Conn. App. 264, 271, 856 A.2d 522 (2004) (videotaped
statement admissible); see also State v. Woodson, 227 Conn.
1, 21, 629 A.2d 386 (1993) (signature of witness unnecessary
when tape-recorded statement offered under Whelan).

Use of the word ‘‘witness’’ in Section 8-5 (1) assumes that
the declarant has testified at the proceeding in question, as
required by the Whelan rule.

As to the requirements of authentication, see Section 9-1

of the Code.

(2) Identification of a person.
Section 8-5 (2) incorporates the hearsay exception recog-
nized in State v. McClendon, 199 Conn. 5, 11, 505 A.2d 685
(1986), and reaffirmed in subsequent cases. See State v.
Outlaw, 216 Conn. 492, 497–98, 582 A.2d 751 (1990); State
v. Townsend, 206 Conn. 621, 624, 539 A.2d 114 (1988); State
v. Weidenhof, 205 Conn. 262, 274, 533 A.2d 545 (1987).
Although this hearsay exception appears to have been the
subject of criminal cases exclusively, Section 8-5 (2) is not so
limited, and applies in civil cases as well.

Either the declarant or another witness present when the
declarant makes the identification, such as a police officer,
can testify at trial as to the identification. Compare State v.
McClendon, supra, 199 Conn. 8 (declarants testified at trial
about their prior out-of-court identifications), with State v.
Weidenhof, supra, 205 Conn. 274 (police officer who showed

declarant photographic array was called as witness at trial to
testify concerning declarant’s prior out-of-court identification).
Even when it is another witness who testifies as to the declar-
ant’s identification, the declarant must be available for cross-
examination at trial for the identification to be admissible. But
cf. State v. Outlaw, supra, 216 Conn. 498 (dictum suggesting
that declarant must be available for cross-examination either
at trial or at prior proceeding in which out-of-court identification
is offered).

Constitutional infirmities in the admission of first-time identifi-
cations, whether pretrial or in-court, are the subject of separate
inquiries and constitute independent grounds for exclusion.
See, e.g., State v. Dickson, 322 Conn. 410, 423–31, 141 A.3d
810 (2016), cert. denied,
, 137 S. Ct. 2263, 198 L.
U.S.
Ed. 2d 713 (2017); see also id., 445–46 (requiring state to
seek permission from trial court prior to presenting first time
in-court identification and establishing that trial court may grant
permission only if there is no factual dispute as to identity
of perpetrator or ability of eyewitness to identify defendant
as perpetrator).

General Statutes § 54-1p prescribes numerous rules
regarding eyewitness identification procedures used by law
enforcement. The statute is silent on the remedy for noncompli-
ance. See State v. Grant, 154 Conn. App. 293, 312 n.10, 112
A.3d 175 (2014) (procedures in § 54-1p are ‘‘best practices’’
and are ‘‘not constitutionally mandated’’ (internal quotation
marks omitted)), cert. denied, 315 Conn. 928, 109 A.3d 923
(2015); see also State v. Guilbert, 306 Conn. 218, 251–58,
49 A.3d 705 (2012); State v. Ledbetter, 275 Conn. 534,
579–80, 881 A.2d 290 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1082,
126 S. Ct. 1798, 164 L. Ed. 2d 537 (2006).

Sec. 8-6. Hearsay Exceptions: Declarant

Must Be Unavailable
The following are not excluded by the hearsay
rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:
(1) Former testimony. Testimony given as a
witness at another hearing of the same or a differ-
ent proceeding, provided (A) the issues in the
former hearing are the same or substantially simi-
lar to those in the hearing in which the testimony
is being offered, and (B) the party against whom
the testimony is now offered had an opportunity
to develop the testimony in the former hearing.

(2) Dying declaration.

In a prosecution in
which the death of the declarant is the subject of
the charge, a statement made by the declarant,
while the declarant was conscious of his or her
impending death, concerning the cause of or the
circumstances surrounding the death.

(3) Statement against civil interest. A trust-
worthy statement that, at the time of its making,
was against the declarant’s pecuniary or proprie-
tary interest, or that so far tended to subject the
declarant to civil liability that a reasonable person
in the declarant’s position would not have made
the statement unless the person believed it to be
true. In determining the trustworthiness of such a

38

Connecticut Code of Evidence

statement the court shall consider whether safe-
guards reasonably equivalent to the oath taken by
a witness and the test of cross-examination exist.
(4) Statement against penal interest. A trust-
worthy statement against penal interest that, at
the time of its making, so far tended to subject
the declarant to criminal liability that a reasonable
person in the declarant’s position would not have
made the statement unless the person believed
it to be true. In determining the trustworthiness of
a statement against penal interest, the court shall
consider (A) the time the statement was made
and the person to whom the statement was made,
(B) the existence of corroborating evidence in the
case, and (C) the extent to which the statement
was against the declarant’s penal interest.

(5) Statement concerning ancient private
boundaries. A statement, made before the con-
troversy arose, as to the location of ancient private
boundaries if the declarant had peculiar means
of knowing the boundary and had no interest to
misrepresent the truth in making the statement.
(6) Reputation of a past generation. Reputa-
tion of a past generation concerning facts of public
or general interest or affecting public or private
rights as to ancient rights of which the declarant
is presumed or shown to have had competent
knowledge and which matters are incapable of
proof in the ordinary way by available witnesses.
(7) Statement of pedigree and family rela-
tionships. A statement concerning pedigree and
family relationships, provided (A) the statement
was made before the controversy arose, (B) the
declarant had no interest to misrepresent in mak-
ing the statement, and (C) the declarant, because
of a close relationship with the family to which the
statement relates, had special knowledge of the
subject matter of the statement.

(8) Forfeiture by wrongdoing. A statement
offered against a party who has engaged in
wrongdoing that was intended to, and did, procure
the unavailability of the declarant as a witness.
(Amended June 29, 2007, to take effect Jan. 1, 2008.)

COMMENTARY
The fundamental threshold requirement of all Section 8-6
hearsay exceptions is that the declarant be unavailable as a
witness. At common law, the definition of unavailability has
varied with the particular hearsay exception at issue. For
example, the Supreme Court has recognized death as the
only form of unavailability for the dying declaration and ancient
private boundary hearsay exceptions. See, e.g., Rompe v.
King, 185 Conn. 426, 429, 441 A.2d 114 (1981) (boundaries);
State v. Manganella, 113 Conn. 209, 215–16, 155 A. 74 (1931)
(dying declarations). More recently, the court adopted the uni-
form definition of unavailability set forth in rule 804 (a) of the
Federal Rules of Evidence. See Maio v. New Haven, 326
Conn. 708, 726–28 and n.15, 167 A.3d 338 (2017); see also
State v. Schiappa, 248 Conn. 132, 141–42, 728 A.2d 466,
cert. denied, 528 U.S. 862, 120 S. Ct. 152, 145 L. Ed. 2d 129

(1999). At this point, however, Section 8-6 contains no uniform
definition of unavailability.

‘‘[S]ubstantial diligence’’

The proponent of evidence offered under Section 8-6 carries
the burden of proving the declarant’s unavailability. E.g., State
v. Rivera, 220 Conn. 408, 411, 599 A.2d 1060 (1991); cf. State
v. Aillon, 202 Conn. 385, 390, 521 A.2d 555 (1987). To satisfy
this burden, the proponent must show that a good faith, genu-
ine effort was made to procure the declarant’s attendance by
process or other reasonable means. See, e.g., State v. Rivera,
supra, 411.
is required; State v.
Lopez, 239 Conn. 56, 75, 681 A.2d 950 (1996); but the propo-
nent is not required to do ‘‘everything conceivable’’ to secure
the witness’ presence. (Internal quotation marks omitted.)
State v. Wright, 107 Conn. App. 85, 90, 943 A.2d 1159, cert.
denied, 287 Conn. 914, 950 A.2d 1291 (2008). A trial court
is not precluded from relying on the representations of counsel
regarding efforts made to procure the witness’ attendance at
trial if those representations are based on counsel’s personal
knowledge. See Maio v. New Haven, supra, 326 Conn. 729.
With respect to deposition testimony, Practice Book § 13-
31 (a) (4) expands the scope of Section 8-6 by permitting the
admissibility of depositions in certain circumstances in which
the deponent is deemed unavailable for purposes of that rule.
Among other things, the rule covers situations in which a
deponent is dead, at a greater distance than thirty miles from
the trial or hearing, out of state until the trial or hearing termi-
nates, or unable to attend due to age, illness, infirmity, or
imprisonment, situations in which the party offering the deposi-
tion is unable to procure the attendance of the deponent by
subpoena, or under exceptional circumstances in the interest
of justice. See Gateway Co. v. DiNoia, 232 Conn. 223, 238
n.11, 654 A.2d 342 (1995) (observing that Practice Book
(1978–97) § 248 (1) (d), now Practice Book § 13-31 (a),
‘‘broadens the rules of evidence by permitting otherwise inad-
missible evidence to be admitted’’). See Section 8-2 (a) and
the commentary thereto regarding situations in which the Code
contains provisions that may have conflicted with the Prac-
tice Book.

Numerous statutes also provide for the admissibility of for-
mer deposition or trial
testimony under specified circum-
stances. See, e.g., General Statutes §§ 52-149a, 52-152 (a),
52-159 and 52-160.

(1) Former testimony.
Connecticut cases recognize the admissibility of a witness’
former testimony as an exception to the hearsay rule when
the witness subsequently becomes unavailable. E.g., State v.
Parker, 161 Conn. 500, 504, 289 A.2d 894 (1971); Atwood v.
Atwood, 86 Conn. 579, 584, 86 A. 29 (1913); State v. Malone,
40 Conn. App. 470, 475–78, 671 A.2d 1321, cert. denied, 237
Conn. 904, 674 A.2d 1332 (1996). For purposes of the former
testimony exception, the proponent must demonstrate that a
good faith, genuine effort was made to procure the attendance
of the witness at trial but is not required to demonstrate that
efforts were made to take the deposition of the witness. See
Maio v. New Haven, supra, 326 Conn. 725–28.

In addition to showing unavailability; e.g., Crochiere v. Board
of Education, 227 Conn. 333, 356, 630 A.2d 1027 (1993);
State v. Aillon, supra, 202 Conn. 391; the proponent must
establish two foundational elements. First, the proponent must
show that the issues in the proceeding in which the witness
testified and the proceeding in which the witness’ former testi-
mony is offered are the same or substantially similar. E.g.,
State v. Parker, supra, 161 Conn. 504; In re Durant, 80 Conn.
140, 152, 67 A. 497 (1907); Perez v. D & L Tractor Trailer
School, 117 Conn. App. 680, 690, 981 A.2d 497 (2009), cert.
denied, 294 Conn. 923, 985 A.2d 1062 (2010). The similarity
of issues is required primarily as a means of ensuring that the
party against whom the former testimony is offered had a

39

Sec. 8-6

Connecticut Code of Evidence

motive and interest to adequately examine the witness in the
former proceeding. See Atwood v. Atwood, supra, 86 Conn.
584.

Second, the proponent must show that the party against
whom the former testimony is offered had an opportunity to
develop the testimony in the former proceeding. E.g., State
v. Parker, supra, 161 Conn. 504; Lane v. Brainerd, 30 Conn.
565, 579 (1862). This second foundational requirement simply
requires the opportunity to develop the witness’ testimony; the
use made of that opportunity is irrelevant to a determination
of admissibility. See State v. Parker, supra, 504; State v.
Crump, 43 Conn. App. 252, 264, 683 A.2d 402, cert. denied,
239 Conn. 941, 684 A.2d 712 (1996).

The common law generally stated this second foundational
element in terms of an opportunity for cross-examination; e.g.,
State v. Weinrib, 140 Conn. 247, 252, 99 A.2d 145 (1953);
probably because the cases involved the introduction of former
testimony against the party against whom it previously was
offered. Section 8-6 (1), however, supposes development of
a witness’ testimony through direct or redirect examination, in
addition to cross-examination; cf. Lane v. Brainerd, supra, 30
Conn. 579; thus recognizing the possibility of former testimony
being offered against its original proponent. The rules allowing
a party to impeach its own witness; Section 6-4; and authoriz-
ing leading questions during direct or redirect examination of
hostile or forgetful witnesses, for example; Section 6-8 (b);
provide added justification for this approach.

Section 8-6 (1), consistent with the modern trend, abandons
the traditional requirement of mutuality, i.e., that the identity
of the parties in the former and current proceedings be the
same; see Atwood v. Atwood, supra, 86 Conn. 584; Lane v.
Brainerd, supra, 30 Conn. 579; in favor of requiring merely
that the party against whom the former testimony is offered
have had an opportunity to develop the witness’ testimony in
the former proceeding. See In re Durant, supra, 80 Conn. 152.

(2) Dying declaration.
Section 8-6 (2) recognizes Connecticut’s common-law dying
declaration hearsay exception. E.g., State v. Onofrio, 179
Conn. 23, 43–44, 425 A.2d 560 (1979); State v. Manganella,
supra, 113 Conn. 215–16; State v. Smith, 49 Conn. 376, 379
(1881). The exception is limited to criminal prosecutions for
homicide. See, e.g., State v. Yochelman, 107 Conn. 148, 154-
55, 139 A. 632 (1927); Daily v. New York & New Haven Rail-
road Co., 32 Conn. 356, 358 (1865). Furthermore, by
demanding that ‘‘the death of the declarant [be] the subject
of the charge,’’ Section 8-6 (2) retains the requirement that
the declarant be the victim of the homicide that serves as the
basis for the prosecution in which the statement is offered.
See, e.g., State v. Yochelman, supra, 155; Daily v. New York &
New Haven Railroad Co., supra, 358.

Section 8-6 (2), in accordance with common law, limits the
exception to statements concerning the cause of or circum-
stances surrounding what the declarant considered to be his
or her impending death. State v. Onofrio, supra, 179 Conn.
43–44; see State v. Smith, supra, 49 Conn. 379. A declarant
is ‘‘conscious of his or her impending death’’ within the mean-
ing of the rule when the declarant believes that his or her
death is imminent and abandons all hope of recovery. See
State v. Onofrio, supra, 44; State v. Cronin, 64 Conn. 293,
304, 29 A. 536 (1894). This belief may be established by
reference to the declarant’s own statements or circumstantial
evidence such as the administration of last rites, a physician’s
prognosis made known to the declarant or the severity of the
declarant’s wounds. State v. Onofrio, supra, 44–45; State v.
Swift, 57 Conn. 496, 505–506, 18 A. 664 (1888); In re Jose
M., 30 Conn. App. 381, 393, 620 A.2d 804, cert. denied, 225
Conn. 921, 625 A.2d 821 (1993). Dying declarations in the

form of an opinion are subject to the limitations on lay opinion
testimony set forth in Section 7-1. See State v. Manganella,
supra, 113 Conn. 216.

(3) Statement against civil interest.
Section 8-6 (3) restates the rule from Ferguson v. Smazer,

151 Conn. 226, 232–34, 196 A.2d 432 (1963).

(4) Statement against penal interest.
In State v. DeFreitas, 179 Conn. 431, 449–52, 426 A.2d 799
(1980), the Supreme Court recognized a hearsay exception
for statements against penal interest, abandoning the tradi-
tional rule rendering such statements inadmissible. See, e.g.,
State v. Stallings, 154 Conn. 272, 287, 224 A.2d 718 (1966).
Section 8-6 (4) embodies the hearsay exception recognized
in DeFreitas and affirmed in its progeny. E.g., State v. Lopez,
supra, 239 Conn. 70–71; State v. Mayette, 204 Conn. 571,
576–77, 529 A.2d 673 (1987). The exception applies in both
criminal and civil cases. See Reilly v. DiBianco, 6 Conn. App.
556, 563–64, 507 A.2d 106, cert. denied, 200 Conn. 804, 510
A.2d 193 (1986).

Recognizing the possible unreliability of this type of evi-
dence, admissibility is conditioned on the statement’s trustwor-
thiness. E.g., State v. Hernandez, 204 Conn. 377, 390, 528
A.2d 794 (1987). Section 8-6 (4) sets forth three factors a court
shall consider in determining a statement’s trustworthiness,
factors well entrenched in the common-law analysis. E.g.,
State v. Rivera, 221 Conn. 58, 69, 602 A.2d 571 (1992).
Although the cases often cite a fourth factor, namely, the
availability of the declarant as a witness; e.g., State v. Lopez,
supra, 239 Conn. 71; State v. Rosado, 218 Conn. 239, 244,
588 A.2d 1066 (1991); this factor has been eliminated because
the unavailability of the declarant is always required, and, thus,
the factor does nothing to change the equation from case to
case. Cf. State v. Gold, 180 Conn. 619, 637, 431 A.2d 501
(‘‘application of the fourth factor, availability of the declarant
as a witness, does not bolster the reliability of the [statement]
inasmuch as [the declarant] was unavailable at the time of
trial’’), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed.
2d 148 (1980).

Section 8-6 (4) preserves the common-law definition of
‘‘against penal interest’’ in providing that the statement be one
that ‘‘so far tend[s] to subject the declarant to criminal liability
that a reasonable person in the declarant’s position would not
have made the statement unless the person believed it to be
true.’’ Thus, statements other than outright confessions of guilt
may qualify under the exception as well. State v. Bryant, 202
Conn. 676, 695, 523 A.2d 451 (1987); State v. Savage, 34
Conn. App. 166, 172, 640 A.2d 637, cert. denied, 229 Conn.
922, 642 A.2d 1216 (1994). A statement is not against the
declarant’s penal
interest if it is made at a time when the
declarant had already been convicted and sentenced for the
conduct that is the subject of the statement. State v. Collins,
147 Conn. App. 584, 590–91, 82 A.3d 1208, cert. denied, 311
Conn. 929, 86 A.3d 1057 (2014).

The usual scenario involves the defendant’s use of a state-
ment that implicates the declarant but exculpates the defend-
ant. Connecticut case law, however, makes no distinction
between statements that inculpate the declarant but exculpate
the defendant, and statements that inculpate both the declar-
ant and the defendant. Connecticut law supports the admissi-
bility of this so-called ‘‘dual inculpatory’’ statement, provided
that corroborating circumstances clearly indicate its trustwor-
thiness. State v. Camacho, 282 Conn. 328, 359–63, 924 A.2d
99, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 956, 128 S. Ct. 388, 169 L. Ed. 2d
273 (2007); State v. Schiappa, supra, 248 Conn. 154–55.

When a narrative contains both disserving statements and
collateral, self-serving or neutral statements, the Connecticut
rule admits the entire narrative, letting the ‘‘trier of fact assess

its evidentiary quality in the complete context.’’ State v. Bryant,
supra, 202 Conn. 697; accord State v. Savage, supra, 34
Conn. App. 173–74.

Connecticut has adopted the definition of unavailability set
forth in rule 804 (a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence for
determining a declarant’s unavailability under this exception.
State v. Frye, 182 Conn. 476, 481–82 and n.3, 438 A.2d 735
(1980); accord State v. Schiappa, supra, 248 Conn. 141–42.
(5) Statement concerning ancient private boundaries.
Section 8-6 (5) reflects the common law concerning private
boundaries. See Porter v. Warner, 2 Root (Conn.) 22, 23
(1793). Section 8-6 (5) captures the exception in its current
form. Wildwood Associates, Ltd. v. Esposito, 211 Conn. 36,
44, 557 A.2d 1241 (1989); DiMaggio v. Cannon, 165 Conn.
19, 22–23, 327 A.2d 561 (1973); Koennicke v. Maiorano, 43
Conn. App. 1, 13, 682 A.2d 1046 (1996).

‘‘Unavailability,’’ for purposes of this hearsay exception, is
limited to the declarant’s death. See Wildwood Associates,
Ltd. v. Esposito, supra, 211 Conn. 44; Rompe v. King, supra,
185 Conn. 429.

The requirement that the declarant have ‘‘peculiar means
of knowing the boundary’’ is part of the broader common-law
requirement that the declarant qualify as a witness as if he were
testifying at trial. E.g., Wildwood Associates, Ltd. v. Esposito,
supra, 211 Conn. 44; Putnam, Coffin & Burr, Inc. v. Halpern,
154 Conn. 507, 514, 227 A.2d 83 (1967). It is intended that
this general requirement remain in effect, even though not
expressed in the text of the exception. Thus, statements other-
wise qualifying for admission under the text of Section 8-6
(5) nevertheless may be excluded if the court finds that the
declarant would not qualify as a witness had he testified in
court.

Although the cases generally speak of ‘‘ancient’’ private
boundaries; e.g., Wildwood Associates, Ltd. v. Esposito,
supra, 211 Conn. 44; Putnam, Coffin & Burr, Inc. v. Halpern,
supra, 154 Conn. 514; but see, e.g., DiMaggio v. Cannon,
supra, 165 Conn. 22–23; no case actually defines ‘‘ancient’’
or decides what limitation that term places, if any, on the
admission of evidence under this exception.
(6) Reputation of a past generation.
Section 8-6 (6) recognizes the common-law hearsay excep-
tion for reputation, or what commonly was referred to as ‘‘tradi-
tionary’’ evidence, to prove public and private boundaries or
facts of public or general interest. E.g., Hartford v. Maslen, 76
Conn. 599, 615, 57 A. 740 (1904); Wooster v. Butler, 13 Conn.
309, 316 (1839).

Section 8-6 (6) retains both the common-law requirement
that the reputation be that of a past generation; Kempf v.
Wooster, 99 Conn. 418, 422, 121 A. 881 (1923); Dawson v.
Orange, 78 Conn. 96, 108, 61 A. 101 (1905); and the common-
law requirement of antiquity. See Hartford v. Maslen, supra,
76 Conn. 616.

Because the hearsay exception for reputation or traditionary
evidence was disfavored at common law; id., 615; Section 8-
6 (6) is not intended to expand the limited application of this
common-law exception.

(7) Statement of pedigree and family relationships.
Out-of-court declarations describing pedigree and family
relationships have long been excepted from the hearsay rule.
Ferguson v. Smazer, supra, 151 Conn. 230–31; Shea v. Hyde,
107 Conn. 287, 289, 140 A. 486 (1928); Chapman v. Chap-
man, 2 Conn. 347, 349 (1817). Statements admissible under
the exception include not only those concerning genealogy,
but those revealing facts about birth, death, marriage and the
like. See Chapman v. Chapman, supra, 349.

Dicta in cases suggest that forms of unavailability besides
death may qualify a declarant’s statement for admission under

this exception. See Carter v. Girasuolo, 34 Conn. Supp. 507,
511, 373 A.2d 560 (1976); cf. Ferguson v. Smazer, supra,
151 Conn. 230 n.2.

The declarant’s relationship to the family or person to whom
the hearsay statement refers must be established indepen-
dently of the statement. Ferguson v. Smazer, supra, 151
Conn. 231.

(8) Forfeiture by wrongdoing.
This provision has roots extending far back in English and
American common law. See, e.g., Lord Morley’s Case, 6 How.
St. Tr. 769, 770–71 (H.L. 1666); Reynolds v. United States,
98 U.S. 145, 158–59, 25 L. Ed. 244 (1878). ‘‘The rule has its
foundation in the maxim that no one shall be permitted to take
advantage of his own wrong .
.’’ Reynolds v. United
States, supra, 159; see also State v. Henry, 76 Conn. App.
515, 533–37, 820 A.2d 1076, cert. denied, 264 Conn. 908,
826 A.2d 178 (2003). Section 8-6 (8) represents a departure
from rule 804 (b) (6) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which
provides a hearsay exception for statements by unavailable
witnesses when the party against whom the statement is
offered ‘‘wrongfully caused—or acquiesced in wrongfully
causing—the declarant’s unavailability as a witness, and did
so intending that result.’’ Section 8-6 (8) requires more than
mere acquiescence.

.

.

The preponderance of the evidence standard should be
employed in determining whether a defendant has procured
the unavailability of a witness for purposes of this exception.
See State v. Thompson, 305 Conn. 412, 425, 45 A.3d 605
(2012), cert. denied, 568 U.S. 1146, 133 S. Ct. 988, 184 L.
Ed. 2d 767 (2013). A defendant who intentionally procures
the unavailability of a witness in order to prevent the witness
from testifying forfeits any confrontation clause claims with
respect to statements made by that witness. See Giles v.
California, 554 U.S. 353, 361, 128 S. Ct. 2678, 171 L. Ed. 2d
488 (2008).

Sec. 8-7. Hearsay within Hearsay

Hearsay within hearsay is admissible only if
each part of the combined statements is indepen-
dently admissible under a hearsay exception.

COMMENTARY
Section 8-7 applies to situations in which a hearsay state-
ment contains within it another level of hearsay, forming what
is frequently referred to as ‘‘[h]earsay within hearsay . . . .’’
(Internal quotation marks omitted.) Dinan v. Marchand, 279
Conn. 558, 571, 903 A.2d 201 (2006). The rule finds support
in the case law. See State v. Williams, 231 Conn. 235, 249,
645 A.2d 999 (1994); State v. Buster, 224 Conn. 546, 560
n.8, 620 A.2d 110 (1993).

Section 8-7 in no way abrogates the court’s discretion to
exclude hearsay within hearsay otherwise admissible when
its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect arising
from the unreliability sometimes found in multiple levels of
hearsay. See Section 4-3; cf. State v. Green, 16 Conn. App.
390, 399–400, 547 A.2d 916, cert. denied, 210 Conn. 802,
553 A.2d 616 (1988). As the levels of hearsay increase, so
should the potential for exclusion under Section 4-3.

A familiar example of hearsay within hearsay is the writing
that qualifies under the business records exception; see Sec-
tion 8-4; and that contains information derived from individuals
under no business duty to provide information. See, e.g.,
O’Shea v. Mignone, 35 Conn. App. 828, 831–32, 647 A.2d
37 (1994) (police officer’s report containing hearsay statement
of bystander). The informant’s statements independently must
fall within another hearsay exception for the writing to be

41

Sec. 8-7

Connecticut Code of Evidence

admissible. See State v. Sharpe, 195 Conn. 651, 663–64, 491
A.2d 345 (1985); State v. Palozie, 165 Conn. 288, 294–95,
334 A.2d 468 (1973); see also State v. Torelli, 103 Conn.
App. 646, 657–62, 931 A.2d 337 (2007) (statement to 911
dispatcher by motorist observing defendant was admissible
as spontaneous utterance contained in business record).

Sec. 8-8.

Impeaching and Supporting Credi-

bility of Declarant
When hearsay has been admitted in evidence,
the credibility of the declarant may be impeached,
and if impeached may be supported, by any evi-
dence that would be admissible for those pur-
poses if the declarant had testified as a witness.
Evidence of a statement of the declarant made
at any time, inconsistent with the declarant’s hear-
say statement, need not be shown to or the con-
tents of the statement disclosed to the declarant.

COMMENTARY
The weight a fact finder gives a witness’ in-court testimony
often depends on the witness’ credibility. So too can a declar-
ant’s credibility affect the weight accorded that declarant’s
hearsay statement admitted at trial. Consequently, Section 8-8
permits the credibility of a declarant, whose hearsay statement
has been admitted in evidence, to be attacked or supported
as if the declarant had taken the stand and testified. See State
v. Calabrese, 279 Conn. 393, 409–10, 902 A.2d 1044 (2006)
(evidence tending to show bias, prejudice or interest); State
v. Mills, 80 Conn. App. 662, 667–68, 837 A.2d 808 (2003)
(evidence of prior criminal convictions), cert. denied, 268
Conn. 914, 847 A.2d 311 (2004); cf. State v. Torres, 210 Conn.
631, 640, 556 A.2d 1013 (1989); State v. Onofrio, 179 Conn.
23, 35, 425 A.2d 560 (1979); State v. Segar, 96 Conn. 428,
440–43, 114 A. 389 (1921).

Treating the hearsay declarant the same as an in-court
witness would seem to pose a problem when impeachment by
inconsistent statements is employed. Section 6-10 (b) provides
that when examining a witness about a prior inconsistent state-
ment, ‘‘the statement should be shown . . . or [its] contents
. . . disclosed to the witness at that time.’’ Showing or disclos-
ing the contents of the inconsistent statement to the declarant
will usually be impossible or impracticable because the declar-
ant may not be a witness at trial, or may not be on the witness
stand at the time the hearsay statement is offered. The second
sentence in Section 8-8 relieves the examiner from complying
with Section 6-10 (b).

By using the terminology ‘‘[e]vidence of a statement . . .
made at any time’’; (emphasis added); Section 8-8 recognizes
the possibility that impeachment of a hearsay declarant may
involve the use of a subsequent inconsistent statement, i.e.,
an inconsistent statement made after the hearsay declaration
statement to be impeached. See generally State v. Torres,
supra, 210 Conn. 635–40 (statements made subsequent to
and inconsistent with probable cause hearing testimony, which
was admitted at
trial, were used to impeach hearsay
declarant).

Sec. 8-9. Residual Exception

A statement that is not admissible under any
of the foregoing exceptions is admissible if the
court determines that (1) there is a reasonable
necessity for the admission of the statement, and

(2) the statement is supported by equivalent guar-
antees of trustworthiness and reliability that are
essential to other evidence admitted under tradi-
tional exceptions to the hearsay rule.

COMMENTARY
Section 8-9 recognizes that the Code’s enumerated hearsay
exceptions will not cover every situation in which an extrajudi-
cial statement may be deemed reliable and essential enough
to justify its admission. In the spirit of the Code’s purpose,
as stated in Section 1-2 (a), of promoting ‘‘the growth and
development of the law of evidence,’’ Section 8-9 provides
the court with discretion to admit, under limited circumstances;
see State v. Dollinger, 20 Conn. App. 530, 540, 568 A.2d
1058, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 805, 574 A.2d 220 (1990);
a hearsay statement not admissible under other exceptions
enumerated in the Code. Section 8-9 sets forth what is com-
monly known as the residual or catch-all exception to the
hearsay rule. E.g., Doe v. Hartford Roman Catholic Diocesan
Corp., 317 Conn. 357, 390–91, 119 A.3d 462 (2015). The
exception traces its roots to cases such as State v. Sharpe,
195 Conn. 651, 664, 491 A.2d 345 (1985), and of more recent
vintage, State v. Oquendo, 223 Conn. 635, 664, 613 A.2d
1300 (1992). See also Goodno v. Hotchkiss, 88 Conn. 655,
669, 92 A. 419 (1914) (necessity and trustworthiness are hall-
marks underlying exceptions to hearsay rule).

‘‘Reasonable necessity’’

is established by showing that,
‘‘unless the hearsay statement is admitted, the facts it contains
may be lost, either because the declarant is dead or otherwise
unavailable, or because the assertion is of such a nature that
evidence of the same value cannot be obtained from the same
or other sources.’’ State v. Sharpe, supra, 195 Conn. 665;
accord State v. Alvarez, 216 Conn. 301, 307 n.3, 579 A.2d
515 (1990); In re Jason S., 9 Conn. App. 98, 106, 516 A.2d
1352 (1986). A minor child may be deemed unavailable under
this exception upon competent proof that the child will suffer
psychological harm from testifying. In re Tayler F., 296 Conn.
524, 544, 995 A.2d 611 (2010).

In determining whether the statement is supported by guar-
antees of trustworthiness and reliability, Connecticut courts
have considered factors such as the length of time between
the event to which the statement relates and the making of
the statement; e.g., State v. Outlaw, 216 Conn. 492, 499, 582
A.2d 751 (1990); the declarant’s motive to tell the truth or
falsify; e.g., State v. Oquendo, supra, 223 Conn. 667; and the
declarant’s availability for cross-examination at trial. E.g., id.,
668; O’Shea v. Mignone, 35 Conn. App. 828, 838, 647 A.2d
37, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 938, 651 A.2d 263 (1994).

To date, the court has not confronted the issue of whether
an evidentiary proffer that comes close to but fails to fit pre-
cisely within a hearsay exception enumerated in the Code
(i.e., ‘‘near miss’’) could nevertheless be admitted under the
residual exception. Compare State v. Dollinger, supra, 20
Conn. App. 537–42 (admissibility of statement rejected under
spontaneous utterance exception; see Section 8-3 (2); but
upheld under residual exception), with Eubanks v. Commis-
sioner of Correction, 166 Conn. App. 1, 15 and n.12, 140 A.3d
402 (suggesting that residual exception would be unavailable
for hearsay statement deemed inadmissible under Whelan
exception; see Section 8-5 (1)), cert. granted, 323 Conn. 911,
149 A.3d 980 (2016), and State v. Outlaw, supra, 216 Conn.
497–500 (admissibility of statement rejected under hearsay
exception for extrajudicial identifications; see Section 8-5 (2);
then analyzed and rejected under residual exception).

Sec. 8-10. Hearsay Exception: Tender Years
‘‘(a) Notwithstanding any other rule of evidence
or provision of law, a statement by a child twelve
years of age or younger at the time of the state-
ment relating to a sexual offense committed
against that child, or an offense involving physical
abuse committed against that child by the child’s
parent or guardian or any other person exercising
comparable authority over the child at the time of
the offense, shall be admissible in a criminal or
juvenile proceeding if: (1) The court finds, in a
hearing conducted outside the presence of the
jury, if any, that the circumstances of the state-
ment, including its timing and content, provide
particularized guarantees of its trustworthiness,
(2) the statement was not made in preparation
for a legal proceeding, (3) the proponent of the
statement makes known to the adverse party an
intention to offer the statement and the particulars
of the statement including the content of the state-
ment, the approximate time, date and location of
the statement, the person to whom the statement
was made and the circumstances surrounding the
statement that indicate its trustworthiness, at such
time as to provide the adverse party with a fair
opportunity to prepare to meet it, and (4) either
(A) the child testifies and is subject to cross-exam-
the proceeding, or (B) the child is
ination at

unavailable as a witness and (i) there is indepen-

alleged act, and (ii) the statement was made prior
to the defendant’s arrest or institution of juvenile
proceedings in connection with the act described
in the statement.

‘‘(b) Nothing in this section shall be construed

cerning any alleged act described in subsection

COMMENTARY

This section, which parallels General Statutes § 54-86l,
addresses the unique and limited area of statements made
by children concerning alleged acts of sexual assault or other
sexual misconduct against a child, or other alleged acts of
physical abuse against the child by a parent, guardian or other
person with like authority over the child at the time of the
alleged act. Subsection (a) sets forth the factors that must be
applied in considering the admissibility of such a statement.
See, e.g., State v. Maguire, 310 Conn. 535, 565, 78 A.3d 828

Sec. 9-1. Requirement of Authentication

(a) Requirement of authentication. The
requirement of authentication as a condition prec-
edent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence suffi-
cient to support a finding that the offered evidence
is what its proponent claims it to be.

(b) Self-authentication. Extrinsic evidence of
authenticity as a condition precedent to admissi-
bility is not required if the offered evidence is self-
authenticating in accordance with applicable law.

COMMENTARY
(a) Requirement of authentication.
Before an item of evidence may be admitted, there must
be a preliminary showing of its genuineness, i.e., that the
proffered item of evidence is what its proponent claims it to
be. The requirement of authentication applies to all types of
evidence, including writings, sound recordings, electronically
stored information, real evidence such as a weapon used in
the commission of a crime, demonstrative evidence such as
a photograph depicting an accident scene, and the like. E.g.,
State v. Bruno, 236 Conn. 514, 551, 673 A.2d 1117 (1996)
(real evidence); Shulman v. Shulman, 150 Conn. 651, 657,
193 A.2d 525 (1963) (documentary evidence); State v. Lorain,
141 Conn. 694, 700–701, 109 A.2d 504 (1954) (sound
recordings); Hurlburt v. Bussemey, 101 Conn. 406, 414, 126
A. 273 (1924) (demonstrative evidence). The category of evi-
dence known as electronically stored information can take
various forms. It includes, by way of example only, email,
Internet website postings, text messages and ‘‘chat room’’
content, computer-stored records, data, metadata and com-
puter generated or enhanced animations and simulations. As
with any other form of evidence, a party may use any appro-
priate method, or combination of methods, described in this
commentary, or any other proof to demonstrate that the proffer
is what its proponent claims it to be, to authenticate any particu-
lar item of electronically stored information. See Lorraine v.
Markel American Ins. Co., 241 F.R.D. 534, 545–46 (D. Md.
2007).

The proponent need only advance ‘‘evidence sufficient to
support a finding’’ that the proffered evidence is what it is
claimed to be. Once this prima facie showing is made, the
evidence may be admitted, and the ultimate determination of
authenticity rests with the fact finder. See, e.g., State v. Bruno,
supra, 236 Conn. 551–53; Neil v. Miller, 2 Root (Conn.) 117,
118 (1794); see also Shulman v. Shulman, supra, 150 Conn.
657. Consequently, compliance with Section 9-1 (a) does not
automatically guarantee that the fact finder will accept the
proffered evidence as genuine. The opposing party may still
offer evidence to discredit the proponent’s prima facie show-
ing. Shulman v. Shulman, supra, 659–60.

Evidence may be authenticated in a variety of ways. They

include, but are not limited to, the following:

(1) A witness with personal knowledge may testify that the
offered evidence is what its proponent claims it to be. See,

e.g., State v. Conroy, 194 Conn. 623, 625–26, 484 A.2d 448
(1984) (establishing chain of custody); Pepe v. Aceto, 119
Conn. 282, 287–88, 175 A. 775 (1934) (authenticating docu-
ments); Booker v. Stern, 19 Conn. App. 322, 333, 563 A.2d
305 (1989) (authenticating photographs); see also Lorraine v.
Markel American Ins. Co., supra, 241 F.R.D. 544–45 (electron-
ically stored information);

(2) A person with sufficient familiarity with the handwriting
of another person may give an opinion concerning the genuine-
ness of that other person’s purported writing or signature. E.g.,
Lyon v. Lyman, 9 Conn. 55, 59 (1831);

(3) A contested item of evidence may be authenticated by
comparing it with a preauthenticated specimen. See, e.g.,
State v. Ralls, 167 Conn. 408, 417, 356 A.2d 147 (1974)
(fingerprints, experts); Tyler v. Todd, 36 Conn. 218, 222 (1869)
(handwriting, experts or triers of fact); see also Lorraine v.
Markel American Ins. Co., supra, 241 F.R.D. 546 (electroni-
cally stored information);

(4) The distinctive characteristics of an object, writing or
other communication, when considered in conjunction with the
surrounding circumstances, may provide sufficient circum-
stantial evidence of authenticity. See International Brother-
hood of Electrical Workers Local 35 v. Commission on Civil
Rights, 140 Conn. 537, 547, 102 A.2d 366 (1953) (telephone
conversations); 2 C. McCormick, Evidence (7th Ed. 2013)
§ 224, pp. 94–96 (‘‘reply letter’’ doctrine, under which letter B
is authenticated merely by reference to its content and circum-
stances suggesting it was in reply to earlier letter A and sent
by addressee of letter A); C. Tait & E. Prescott, Connecticut

Lorraine v. Markel American Ins. Co., supra, 241 F.R.D.
546–48 (electronically stored information); State v. Jackson,
150 Conn. App. 323, 329, 332–35, 90 A.3d 1031 (unsigned
letter), cert. denied, 312 Conn. 919, 94 A.3d 641 (2014); State

stored in computer), cert. denied, 272 Conn. 903, 863 A.2d
695 (2004).

(5) Any person having sufficient familiarity with another per-
son’s voice, whether acquired from hearing the person’s voice
firsthand or through mechanical or electronic means, can iden-
tify that person’s voice or authenticate a conversation in which
the person participated. See State v. Jonas, 169 Conn. 566,
576–77, 363 A.2d 1378 (1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 923,
96 S. Ct. 1132, 47 L. Ed. 2d 331 (1976); State v. Marsala, 43
Conn. App. 527, 531, 684 A.2d 1199 (1996), cert. denied, 239
Conn. 957, 688 A.2d 329 (1997);

(6) Evidence describing a process or a system used to
produce a result and showing that the process or system
produces an accurate result. This method of authentication,
modeled on rule 901 (b) (9) of the Federal Rules of Evidence,
was used in State v. Swinton, 268 Conn. 781, 811–13, 847
A.2d 921 (2004), to establish the standard used to determine
the admissibility of computer simulations or animations. The
particular requirements applied in Swinton were ‘‘fairly strin-
gent’’; id., 818; because that case involved relatively sophisti-
cated computer enhancements using specialized software.
See id., 798–801. In other cases, when a proponent seeks to

44

Connecticut Code of Evidence

use this method to authenticate electronically stored informa-
tion, the nature of the evidence establishing the accuracy of
the system or process may be less demanding. See, e.g., U-
Haul International, Inc. v. Lubermens Mutual Casualty Co., 576
F.3d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir. 2009) (authentication of computer
generated summaries of payments of insurance claims by
manager familiar with process of how summaries were made
were held to be adequate); see also State v. Melendez, 291
Conn. 693, 709–10, 970 A.2d 64 (2009) (admission of unmodi-
fied footage of drug transaction on DVD was not subject to
heightened Swinton standard); State v. Shah, 134 Conn. App.
581, 595, 39 A.3d 1165 (2012) (chat room transcripts were
not computer generated evidence and therefore not subject
to heightened Swinton standard).

(7) Outgoing telephone calls may be authenticated by proof
that (1) the caller properly placed the telephone call, and (2)
the answering party identified himself or herself as the person
to whom the conversation is to be linked. Hartford National
Bank & Trust Co. v. DiFazio, 6 Conn. App. 576, 585, 506 A.2d
1069, cert. denied, 200 Conn. 805, 510 A.2d 192 (1986);

(8) Stipulations or admissions prior to or during trial provide
two other means of authentication. See Stanton v. Grigley,
177 Conn. 558, 559, 418 A.2d 923 (1979); see also Practice
Book §§ 13-22 through 13-24 (in requests for admission);
Practice Book § 14-13 (4) (at pretrial session);

(9) Sections 9-2 and 9-3 (authentication of ancient docu-
ments and public records, respectively) provide additional
methods of authentication.
(b) Self-authentication.
Both case law and statutes identify certain kinds of writings
or documents as self-authenticating. A self-authenticating doc-
ument’s genuineness is taken as sufficiently established with-
out resort to extrinsic evidence, such as a witness’ foundational
testimony. State v. Howell, 98 Conn. App. 369, 379–80, 908
A.2d 1145 (2006). Subsection (b) continues the principle of
self-authentication but leaves the particular instances under
which self-authentication is permitted to the dictates of com-
mon law and the General Statutes.

Self-authentication in no way precludes the opponent from
coming forward with evidence contesting authenticity; see
Atlantic Industrial Bank v. Centonze, 130 Conn. 18, 19, 31
A.2d 392 (1943); Griswold v. Pitcairn, 2 Conn. 85, 91 (1816);
as the fact finder ultimately decides whether a writing or docu-
ment is authentic. In addition, self-authenticating evidence
remains vulnerable to exclusion or admissibility for limited
purposes under other provisions of the Code or the General
Statutes.

Common-law examples of self-authenticating writings or

documents include:

(1) writings or documents carrying the impression of certain
official seals; e.g., Atlantic Industrial Bank v. Centonze, supra,
130 Conn. 19–20; Barber v. International Co. of Mexico, 73
Conn. 587, 602, 603, 48 A. 758 (1901); Griswold v. Pitcairn,
supra, 2 Conn. 90–91; and

(2) marriage certificates signed by the person officiating the
ceremony. E.g., Northrop v. Knowles, 52 Conn. 522, 525–26,
2 A. 395 (1885).

Familiar statutory examples of self-authenticating writings

or documents include:

(1) acknowledgments made or taken in accordance with
the Uniform Acknowledgment Act, General Statutes §§ 1-28
through 1-41; see General Statutes § 1-36; and the Uniform
Recognition of Acknowledgments Act, General Statutes §§ 1-
57 through 1-65; see General Statutes § 1-58;

(2) copies of records or documents required by law to be
filed with the Secretary of the State and certified in accordance
with General Statutes § 3-98;

(3) birth certificates certified in accordance with General

Statutes § 7-55;

(4) certain third-party documents authorized or required by
an existing contract and subject to the Uniform Commercial
Code; General Statutes § 42a-1-307; see also General Stat-
utes § 42a-8-114 (2)
(signatures on certain negotiable
instruments);

(5) marriage certificates issued pursuant to General Statutes

§ 46b-34; see General Statutes § 46b-35; and

(6) copies of certificates filed by a corporation with the Secre-
tary of the State in accordance with law and certified in accord-
ance with General Statutes § 52-167.

It should be noted that the foregoing examples do not consti-
tute an exhaustive list of self-authenticating writings or docu-
ments. Certified copies of many public records, for example,
are self-authenticating pursuant to statute. See, e.g., General
Statutes § 1-14. Of course, writings or documents that do not
qualify under subsection (b) may be authenticated under the
principles announced in subsection (a) or elsewhere in this
article.

Sec. 9-2. Authentication of Ancient Doc-

uments
The requirement of authentication as a condi-
tion precedent to admitting a document in any
form into evidence shall be satisfied upon proof
that the document (A) has been in existence for
more than thirty years, (B) was produced from
proper custody, and (C) is otherwise free from
suspicion.

COMMENTARY
Section 9-2 embraces the common-law ancient document
rule. See, e.g., Jarboe v. Home Bank & Trust Co., 91 Conn.
265, 269, 99 A. 563 (1917). Documents that satisfy the founda-
tional requirements are authenticated without more. See id.,
270. Thus, Section 9-2 dispenses with any requirement that the
document’s proponent produce attesting witnesses. Borden
v. Westport, 112 Conn. 152, 161, 151 A. 512 (1930); Jarboe
v. Home Bank & Trust Co., supra, 269, 270.

Although common-law application of the rule mainly involved
dispositive instruments, such as wills and deeds; e.g., Jarboe
v. Home Bank & Trust Co., supra, 91 Conn. 269 (will); Borden
v. Westport, supra, 112 Conn. 161 (deed); but see, e.g., Petro-
man v. Anderson, 105 Conn. 366, 369–70, 135 A. 391 (1926)
(ancient map); the current rule applies to all documents, in
any form, including those stored electronically.

Ancient documents are the subject of a hearsay exception
with foundational requirements identical to those found in Sec-
tion 9-2. See Section 8-3 (9).

Sec. 9-3. Authentication of Public Records
The requirement of authentication as a condi-
tion precedent to admitting into evidence a record,
report, statement or data compilation, in any form,
is satisfied by evidence that (A) the record, report,
statement or data compilation authorized by law
to be recorded or filed in a public office has been
recorded or filed in that public office, (B) the
record, report, statement or data compilation, pur-
porting to be a public record, report, statement or

45

Sec. 9-3

Connecticut Code of Evidence

data compilation, is from the public office where
items of this nature are maintained, or (C) the
record, report, statement or data compilation, pur-
porting to be a public record, report, statement or
data compilation, is made available in electronic
form by a public authority.

COMMENTARY

It generally is recognized that a public record may be authen-
ticated simply by showing that the record purports to be a
public record and comes from the custody of the proper public
office. State v. Calderon, 82 Conn. App. 315, 322, 844 A.2d
866, cert. denied, 270 Conn. 905, 853 A.2d 523, cert. denied,
543 U.S. 982, 125 S. Ct. 487, 160 L. Ed. 2d 361 (2004); see
Whalen v. Gleeson, 81 Conn. 638, 644, 71 A. 908 (1909);
Barber v. International Co. of Mexico, 73 Conn. 587, 602, 48
A. 758 (1901). Thus, although certified copies of most public
records are ‘‘self-authenticating’’ in accordance with other pro-
visions of the General Statutes, certification is not the exclusive
means by which to authenticate a public record. The rule
extends the common-law principle to public records, including
electronically stored information.

Proviso (A) assumes that documents authorized by law to
be recorded or filed in a public office—e.g., tax returns, wills
or deeds—are public records for purposes of authentication.
Cf. Kelsey v. Hanmer, 18 Conn. 310, 319 (1847) (deed). Pro-
viso (B) covers reports, records, statements or data compila-
tions prepared and maintained by the public official or public
office, whether local, state, federal or foreign.

Sec. 9-3A. Authentication

of

Business

Entries
(a) Authentication of business entries by
certification. The requirement of authentication
as a condition precedent to admitting into evi-
dence a business entry under Section 8-4 may
be satisfied by sworn certification of the custodian
of the record or other qualified witness attesting
to the following:

(1) The affiant is the duly authorized custodian
of the records or another qualified witness who
has and is acting with authority to make the certifi-
cation;

(2) The record was made in the regular course
of business, that it was the regular course of such
business to make such a record, and that it was
made at the time of the act described in the report,
or within a reasonable time thereafter, as required
by General Statutes § 52-180;

(3) The information contained in the record was
based on the entrant’s own observation or on
information of others whose business duty it was
to transmit it to the entrant; and

(4) To the best of the certifying person’s knowl-
edge, after reasonable inquiry, the record or copy
thereof is an accurate version of the record that
is in the possession, custody or control of the
certifying person.

(b) Certification admissible. A certification
made in compliance with subsection (a) is admis-
sible evidence of the matters set forth therein. A

party opposing admissibility of a record offered
through a proper certification under subsection
(a) bears the burden of showing that the record
is not what it purports to be.

(c) Notice and opportunity to contest. A party
intending to offer a record into evidence under
this section must provide written notice of that
intention to all adverse parties and must make the
record and certification available for inspection
sufficiently in advance of their offer into evidence
to provide an adverse party with a fair opportunity
to challenge them.

(Adopted March 29, 2022, to take effect June 13, 2022.)

COMMENTARY
(a) Authentication of business entries by certification.
This provision offers a procedure by which parties can authenti-
cate certain business records other than through the testimony
of a foundation witness. The procedure is intended to help
the parties determine in advance of the evidentiary proceeding
whether there is a real dispute as to authenticity, and to
increase the efficiency of the authentication process when
there is not. The certification process, which has been adopted
in some form in many other jurisdictions, will increase effi-
ciency and reduce logistical burdens by limiting the need for
a party to produce a witness at the evidentiary proceeding for
the purpose of authenticating a business record. A proponent
seeking to authenticate a business record under this section
must present a certification containing information that would
be sufficient to establish authenticity were that information
provided by a witness at the evidentiary proceeding. If the
certification provides information that would be insufficient to
authenticate the record if the certifying person testified, then
a sufficient showing of authenticity has not been made under
this section.

Even without the certification procedure, parties often will
stipulate to the authenticity of business records; use of that
practice remains unaffected by this provision. More broadly,
the certification process is provided as an alternative to other
means of authentication, and nothing herein is intended to
prevent a party from authenticating a business record through
witness testimony, or through a combination of certification
and witness testimony.

(b) Certification admissible. The court makes the prelimi-
nary determination of whether the proponent has made a suffi-
cient showing of authenticity, but the fact finder ultimately
determines whether the evidence is what its proponent claims
it to be. See Section 1-3 (b), commentary. Consequently, when
a record is authenticated by means of certification, the certifica-
tion itself must be admissible for consideration by the fact
finder as part of its determination.

(c) Notice and opportunity to contest. The certification
procedure is intended to increase the efficiency of the authenti-
cation process with respect to business records, but the proce-
dure must not be used to curtail or impair a party’s ability to
test or contest the authenticity of such record. Section 9-3A
(c) ensures that a party will have the opportunity to ascertain
whether grounds exist to contest the accuracy or validity of a
certification. Determining the precise timing and disclosure
proceedings that are necessary to offer a fair opportunity to
contest authentication will require balancing the efficiency
sought to be achieved by the certification process with the
rights of all parties to raise and litigate the issue when a good
faith doubt may exist regarding the authenticity of a record.

Sec. 9-4. Subscribing Witness’ Testimony

If a document is required by law to be attested
to by witnesses to its execution, at least one sub-
scribing witness must be called to authenticate
the document. If no attesting witness is available,
the document then may be authenticated in the
same manner as any other document. Documents
that are authenticated under Section 9-2 need not
be authenticated by an attesting witness.

COMMENTARY
Certain documents, such as wills and deeds, are required
by law to be attested to by witnesses. See General Statutes
§ 45a-251 (wills); General Statutes § 47-5 (deeds). At common
law, the proponent, in order to authenticate such a document,
must have called at least one of the attesting witnesses or
satisfactorily have explained the absence of all of
the
attesting witnesses.

Thereafter, the proponent could authenticate the document
through the testimony of nonattesting witnesses. See, e.g.,

Loewenberg v. Wallace, 147 Conn. 689, 696, 166 A.2d 150
(1960); Kelsey v. Hanmer, 18 Conn. 311, 317–18 (1847).

The rule requiring attesting witnesses to be produced or
accounted for applies only when proving the fact of valid execu-
tion, i.e., genuineness, not when proving other things such as
the document’s delivery or contents. 4 J. Wigmore, Evidence
(4th Ed. 1972) § 1293, pp. 709–10.

Section 9-4 exempts ancient documents from the general
rule on the theory that the genuineness of a document more
than thirty years old is established simply by showing proper
custody and suspicionless appearance; see Section 9-2; with-
out more. See, e.g., Borden v. Westport, 112 Conn. 152, 161,
151 A. 512 (1930); Jarboe v. Home Bank & Trust Co., 91
Conn. 265, 269, 99 A. 563 (1917).

Dicta in two Connecticut cases suggest that it is unneces-
sary to call subscribing witnesses or explain their absence
when the document at issue is only collaterally involved in the
case. Great Hill Lake, Inc. v. Caswell, 126 Conn. 364, 369,
11 A.2d 396 (1940); see Pepe v. Aceto, 119 Conn. 282,
287–88, 175 A. 775 (1934). Another case suggests the same
exemption for certified copies of recorded deeds. See Loewe-
nberg v. Wallace, supra, 147 Conn. 696. Although these
exemptions, unlike the one for ancient documents, were not
included in the text of the rule, they are intended to survive
adoption of Section 9-4.

Sec. 10-1. General Rule

To prove the content of a writing, recording or
photograph, the original writing, recording or pho-
tograph must be admitted in evidence, except as
otherwise provided by the Code, the General Stat-
utes or any Practice Book rule adopted before
June 18, 2014, the date on which the Supreme
Court adopted the Code. An original of electroni-
cally stored information includes evidence in the
form of a printout or other output, readable by sight
or otherwise shown to reflect the data accurately.
(Amended May 20, 2015, to take effect Aug. 1, 2015;

amended Dec. 14, 2017, to take effect Feb. 1, 2018.)

COMMENTARY
Section 10-1 adopts Connecticut’s best evidence rule. The
rule embraces two interrelated concepts. First, the proponent
must produce the original of a writing, as defined in Section
1-2 (c), recording or photograph when attempting to prove the
contents thereof, unless production is excused. E.g., Shelnitz
v. Greenberg, 200 Conn. 58, 78, 509 A.2d 1023 (1986). Sec-
ond, to prove the contents of the proffer, the original must be
admitted in evidence. Thus, for example, the contents of a
document cannot be proved by the testimony of a witness
referring to the document while testifying.

The cases generally have restricted the best evidence rule to
writings or documents. See Brookfield v. Candlewood Shores
Estates, Inc., 201 Conn. 1, 11, 513 A.2d 1218 (1986). In
extending the rule to recordings and photographs, Section 10-
1 recognizes the growing reliance on modern technologies for
the recording and storage of information.

Section 10-1 applies only when the proponent seeks to
prove contents. E.g., Hotchkiss v. Hotchkiss, 143 Conn. 443,
447, 123 A.2d 174 (1956) (proving terms of contract); cf. Dyer
v. Smith, 12 Conn. 384, 391 (1837) (proving fact about writing,
such as its existence or delivery, is not proving contents).

The fact that a written record or recording of a transaction
or event is made does not mean that the transaction or event
must be proved by production of
the written record or
recording. When the transaction or event itself rather than the
contents of the written record or recording is sought to be
proved, the best evidence rule has no application. E.g., State
v. Moynahan, 164 Conn. 560, 583, 325 A.2d 199, cert. denied,
414 U.S. 976, 94 S. Ct. 291, 38 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1973); State
v. Tomanelli, 153 Conn. 365, 374, 216 A.2d 625 (1966).

What constitutes an ‘‘original’’ will be clear in most situations.
‘‘Duplicate originals,’’ such as a contract executed in duplicate,
that are intended by the contracting parties to have the same
effect as the original, qualify as originals under the rule. Cf.
Lorch v. Page, 97 Conn. 66, 69, 115 A. 681 (1921); Colburn’s
Appeal, 74 Conn. 463, 467, 51 A. 139 (1902).

The definition of ‘‘original’’ explicitly includes printouts or
other forms of electronically stored information that are read-
able. The proponent must show only that the printed or read-
able version is an accurate (i.e., unaltered and unmodified)

depiction of the electronically stored information. See Lorraine
v. Markel American Ins. Co., 241 F.R.D. 534, 577–78 (D.
Md. 2007) (under Federal Rules of Evidence, ‘‘the ‘original’
of information stored in computer is readable display of the
information on the computer screen, the hard drive or other
source where it is stored, as well as any printout or output
that may be read, so long as it accurately reflects the data’’).
Although a printout or other physical manifestation of computer
data is considered the original for purposes of the best evi-
dence rule, the underlying data are significant for assessing
admissibility under exceptions to the hearsay rule. See Ninth
RMA Partners, L.P. v. Krass, 57 Conn. App. 1, 10–11, 746
A.2d 826 (business entry exception to hearsay rule), cert.
denied, 253 Conn. 918, 755 A.2d 215 (2000); Federal Deposit
Ins. Corp. v. Carabetta, 55 Conn. App. 384, 398–99, 739 A.2d
311 (same), cert. denied, 251 Conn. 928, 742 A.2d 362 (1999).
The second sentence in Section 10-1 is modeled on rule
1001 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and on parallel provi-
sions of rules from numerous states around the country.

Sec. 10-2. Admissibility of Copies

A copy of a writing, recording or photograph, is
admissible to the same extent as an original
unless (A) a genuine question is raised as to the
authenticity of the original or the accuracy of the
copy, or (B) under the circumstances it would be
unfair to admit the copy in lieu of the original.

COMMENTARY
By permitting a copy of an original writing, recording or
photograph to be admitted without requiring the proponent to
account for the original, Section 10-2 represents a departure
from common law. See, e.g., British American Ins. Co. v.
Wilson, 77 Conn. 559, 564, 60 A. 293 (1905). Nevertheless,
in light of the reliability of modern reproduction devices, this
section recognizes that a copy derived therefrom often will
serve equally as well as the original when proof of its contents
is required.

‘‘[C]opy,’’ as used in Section 10-2, should be distinguished
from a ‘‘duplicate original,’’ such as a carbon copy of a contract,
which the executing or issuing party intends to have the same
effect as the original. See Section 10-1, commentary.

Sec. 10-3. Admissibility of Other Evidence

of Contents
The original of a writing, recording or photo-
graph is not required, and other evidence of the
contents of such writing, recording or photograph
is admissible if:

(1) Originals lost or destroyed. All originals
are lost or have been destroyed, unless the propo-
nent destroyed or otherwise failed to produce the

48
© Copyrighted by the Secretary of the State of the State of Connecticut

Connecticut Code of Evidence

originals for the purpose of avoiding production
of an original; or

(2) Original not obtainable. No original can
be obtained by any reasonably available judicial
process or procedure; or

(3) Original in possession of opponent. At a
time when an original was under the control of
the party against whom it is offered, that party
was put on notice, by the pleadings or otherwise,
that the contents would be a subject of proof at
the proceeding, and that party does not produce
the original at the proceeding; or

(4) Collateral matters. The contents relate to

a collateral matter.

COMMENTARY
The best evidence rule evolved as a rule of preference
rather than one of exclusion. E.g., Brookfield v. Candlewood
Shores Estates, Inc., 201 Conn. 1, 12, 513 A.2d 1218 (1986).
If the proponent adequately explains the failure to produce
the original, ‘‘secondary’’ evidence of its contents then may
be admitted. Section 10-3 describes the situations under which
production of the original
is excused and the admission of
secondary evidence is permissible.

Although the issue has yet to be directly addressed, the
cases do not appear to recognize degrees of secondary evi-
dence, such as a preference for handwritten copies over oral
testimony. See Sears v. Howe, 80 Conn. 414, 416–17, 68 A.
983 (1908). Section 10-3 recognizes no degrees of secondary
evidence, and thus any available evidence otherwise admissi-
ble may be utilized in proving contents once production of the
original is excused under Section 10-3.
(1) Originals lost or destroyed.
Subdivision (1) reflects the rule in Woicicky v. Anderson,
95 Conn. 534, 536, 111 A. 896 (1920). A proponent ordinarily
proves loss or destruction by demonstrating a diligent but
fruitless search for the lost item; see State v. Castelli, 92 Conn.
58, 69–70, 101 A. 476 (1917); Elwell v. Mersick, 50 Conn.
272, 275–76 (1882); Host America Corp. v. Ramsey, 107
Conn. App. 849, 855–56, 947 A.2d 957, cert. denied, 289
Conn. 904, 957 A.2d 870 (2008); or by producing a witness
with personal knowledge of destruction. See Richter v. Drenck-
hahn, 147 Conn. 496, 502, 163 A.2d 109 (1960).

The proponent is not precluded from offering secondary
evidence when the purpose in losing or destroying the original
is not to avoid production thereof. Mahoney v. Hartford Invest-
ment Corp., 82 Conn. 280, 287, 73 A. 766 (1909); Bank of
the United States v. Sill, 5 Conn. 106, 111 (1823).

(2) Original not obtainable.
Subdivision (2) covers the situation in which a person not
a party to the litigation possesses the original and is beyond
reasonably available judicial process or procedure. See, e.g.,
Shepard v. Giddings, 22 Conn. 282, 283–84 (1853); Townsend
v. Atwater, 5 Day (Conn.) 298, 306 (1812).

(3) Original in possession of opponent.
Common law excuses the proponent from producing the
original when an opposing party in possession of the original
is put on notice and fails to produce the original at trial. See,
e.g., Richter v. Drenckhahn, supra, 147 Conn. 501; City Bank
of New Haven v. Thorp, 78 Conn. 211, 218, 61 A. 428 (1905).
Notice need not compel the opponent to produce the original
but merely provides the option to produce the original or face
the prospect of the proponent’s offer of secondary evidence.
Whether notice is formal or informal, it must be reasonable.

See British American Ins. Co. v. Wilson, 77 Conn. 559, 564,
60 A. 293 (1905).
(4) Collateral matters.

Subdivision (4) is consistent with Connecticut law. Misisco
v. La Maita, 150 Conn. 680, 685, 192 A.2d 891 (1963); Farr
v. Zoning Board of Appeals, 139 Conn. 577, 582, 95 A.2d
792 (1953).

Sec. 10-4. Public Records

The contents of a record, report, statement or
data compilation recorded or filed in a public office
may be proved by a copy, certified in accordance
with applicable law or testified to be correct by a
witness who has compared it with the original.

COMMENTARY
Section 10-4 recognizes an exception to Section 10-1’s
requirement of an original for certified or compared copies
of certain public records. Based on the impracticability and
inconvenience involved in removing original public records
from their place of keeping; see Brookfield v. Candlewood
Shores Estates, Inc., 201 Conn. 1, 12, 513 A.2d 1218 (1986);
Gray v. Davis, 27 Conn. 447, 454 (1858); Connecticut cases
have allowed the contents of these documents to be proved
by certified copies. E.g., Brown v. Connecticut Light & Power
Co., 145 Conn. 290, 295–96, 141 A.2d 634 (1958); Lomas &
Nettleton Co. v. Waterbury, 122 Conn. 228, 234–35, 188 A.
433 (1936). Allowing proof of contents by compared copies
represents a departure from prior case law that is in accord
with the modern trend. E.g., Fed. R. Evid. 1005.

In addition to this Section, statutory provisions address the
use of copies to prove the contents of public records. See,
e.g., General Statutes § 52-181.

Sec. 10-5. Summaries

The contents of voluminous writings, recordings
or photographs, otherwise admissible, that cannot
be conveniently examined in court, may be admit-
ted in the form of a chart, summary or calculation,
provided that the originals or copies are available
upon request for examination or copying, or both,
by other parties at a reasonable time and place.
(Amended Dec. 14, 2017, to take effect Feb. 1, 2018.)

COMMENTARY
Case law permits the use of summaries to prove the contents
of voluminous writings that cannot be conveniently examined
in court. Brookfield v. Candlewood Shores Estates, Inc., 201
Conn. 1, 12–13, 513 A.2d 1218 (1986); McCann v. Gould, 71
Conn. 629, 631–32, 42 A. 1002 (1899). Section 10-5 extends
the rule to voluminous recordings and photographs in confor-
mity with other provisions of this Article.

The summarized originals or copies must be made available
to other parties upon request for examination or copying, or
both, at a reasonable time and place. See Customers Bank
v. Tomonto Industries, LLC, 156 Conn. App. 441, 444–48,
112 A.3d 853 (2015); see also McCann v. Gould, supra, 71
Conn. 632; cf. Brookfield v. Candlewood Shores Estates, Inc.,
supra, 201 Conn. 13.

Sec. 10-6

Connecticut Code of Evidence

Sec. 10-6. Admissions of a Party

The contents of a writing, recording or photo-
graph may be proved by the admission of a party
against whom it is offered that relates to the con-
tents of the writing, recording or photograph.

COMMENTARY
Section 10-6 recognizes the exception to the best evidence
rule for admissions of a party relating to the contents of a
writing when offered against the party to prove the contents
thereof. Morey v. Hoyt, 62 Conn. 542, 557, 26 A. 127 (1893).
Section 10-6 extends the exception to recordings and photo-
graphs in conformity with other provisions of this Article.
