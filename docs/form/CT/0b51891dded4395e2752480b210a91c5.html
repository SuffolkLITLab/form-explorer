Doing More With Less –  
A Blueprint for the Future

To the Governor, General Assembly  
and the Residents of Connecticut: 

As we begin a new decade, it is my pleasure to present to you this Biennial 
Report on the Connecticut Judicial Branch for the years 2008-2010. 
Appropriately, we have dedicated this edition to the theme of “doing more 
with less.”

I’m proud to say that the Judicial Branch adopted this outlook some time 
ago as a result of our first-ever strategic plan, crafted by the Public Service 
and Trust Commission that began its work in 2007. This strategic blueprint 
for the future has led to hundreds of positive changes within the Branch that 
have directly impacted the lives of those who use or visit our courts. These 
changes have involved little or no cost and, in some cases, are actually 
saving money.

At the same time, it is important to remember the critical role that the judiciary has in a democratic society. We 
resolve business disputes. We help keep our communities safe. We work to ensure that children receive the financial 
support that they need. We provide the mechanism by which parties who choose a jury trial have the opportunity to 
present their case before a jury of their peers. And, every day, our judges uphold the constitutional principles of justice 
and fairness that have guided our nation from the beginning. 

These are obligations that the Judicial Branch takes seriously. So although we continue to economize, we still require 
adequate resources to fulfill these essential functions. I look forward to working with the Legislative and Executive 
Branches as we confront the challenges ahead. 

Very truly yours, 

Chase T. Rogers 
Chief Justice

To the Governor, General Assembly  
and the Residents of Connecticut: 

These past two years have been difficult for all three branches of 
government, as we work together to restore the state’s fiscal health. To 
meet this challenge, the Judicial Branch has consistently articulated its 
willingness to shoulder its fair share of sacrifices, keeping in mind that our 
budget represents only 3.1 percent of the total state budget. 

Over the past two years, we have taken money-saving actions similar to 
those of others in state government. For several years we have had a hiring 
freeze in effect, so that savings are achieved without layoffs as people 
leave employment with the Judicial Branch. Other steps include closing the 
Norwalk Juvenile Court and the Milford and Norwich Law Libraries. We 
made these decisions mindful of the effect on members of the public who 
use these facilities and with an eye toward choosing locations with the least 
impact. We continue to take steps to do all we can to minimize the burden. 

It also became apparent over the past biennium that the method by which 
the Judicial Branch’s budget was adopted and implemented was inherently flawed. In the past, the Judicial Branch 
submitted its budget to the Office of Policy and Management (OPM), where it was changed significantly before 
inclusion in the Governor’s budget. This meant that the Legislature did not have the opportunity to see the Judicial 
Branch’s budget recommendations and that the courts were effectively relegated to the status of an Executive  
Branch agency. 

When a $7.9 million cut was unilaterally imposed during FY 2009-2010, the Chief Justice decided that this budget 
method had to be changed. The Legislature agreed and adopted a more balanced and transparent budget process that 
is similar to the process utilized in other states. Pursuant to state statute, OPM now allots to the Judicial Branch the 
exact amount of funding that is included in the approved state budget. It also gives the Legislature the opportunity 
to reject the cuts that are made by the Executive Branch to the Judicial Branch’s budget by a two-thirds vote. What 
the legislation does not do is provide a blank check to the Judicial Branch. Rather, it treats the Judicial Branch as the 
separate and third branch of government envisioned by our forefathers.

The fiscal challenges facing the state in the next two years are daunting. We stand ready to work with both the 
Executive and Legislative Branches to continue serving the public, knowing that yet fewer resources will be available. 
We nonetheless remain committed to our mission to serve the interests of justice and the public by resolving matters 
brought before us in a fair, timely, efficient and open manner. 

 

 
 

Very truly yours, 

Barbara M. Quinn 
Chief Court Administrator

Supreme Court

The Supreme Court is the state’s highest 
court. It consists of the Chief Justice, six 
associate justices and one senior justice. 
The Court sits en banc—in panels of 
seven—in all cases in which there are no 
disqualifications. When one justice has 
recused him or herself from hearing a 
matter, the Court sits as a panel of six.  
If there are two disqualifications, the 
Court sits as a panel of five. In all death 
penalty cases, the Court sits en banc.  

In those death penalty cases when an en 
banc panel cannot be constituted from 
members of the Supreme Court, judges 
of the Appellate Court are requested to 
sit as determined on a rotational basis. 

The Supreme Court reviews rulings made 
in the Appellate and Superior Courts 
to determine if any errors of law have 
occurred.

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Supreme Court  
During the Biennium

State v. Courchesne, 296 Conn. 622 
(2010).

Wellswood Columbia, LLC v. Hebron, 
295 Conn. 802 (2010).

The principal issue in this case was whether an infant 
who is born alive and who subsequently dies from 
injuries sustained in utero is a “person” within the 
meaning of this state’s homicide statutes. In an opinion 
authored by Justice Palmer, the majority concluded that 
the “born alive” rule is part of this state’s common law 
and that the defendant could be charged with murder if 
the state could prove that a child who the defendant had 
injured in utero was born alive and subsequently died of 
the injuries. Justice Katz authored a concurring opinion 
in which she stated that, although the arguments of the 
dissenting justices had some appeal, she agreed with the 
majority because it would be anomalous to conclude that 
a statutory scheme that imposes an enhanced penalty 
when an assault on a woman results in the death of a 
fetus in utero imposes no enhanced penalty when the 
assault results in a live birth and the child later dies of 
the injuries. Justice Zarella argued in his concurring 
and dissenting opinion that the court should reject the 
born alive rule because it is outdated and leads to the 
logically incoherent result that a fetus who is fatally 
injured in utero may or may not be a person depending 
on whether the fetus dies in utero or dies after being born. 
Justice Schaller joined Justice Zarella’s concurring and 
dissenting opinion and argued in a separate concurring 
and dissenting opinion that the application of the born 
alive rule to the defendant violated constitutional due 
process principles because he did not have fair warning 
that the rule would apply to him.

This case raised the issue of whether a town may close 
a town road that provides the sole existing access to 
a property in an adjoining town in order to prevent 
traffic from a proposed subdivision on the property 
from overburdening the road. In an opinion authored 
by Chief Justice Rogers, the court noted that, although 
towns clearly have the power to control streets and to 
regulate traffic, the power to regulate subdivisions is 
statutorily conferred on planning commissions, and the 
statutes governing review of subdivision applications 
provide specific procedures for towns to pursue claims 
that a proposed subdivision will adversely affect traffic 
conditions in the town. The court concluded that, because 
the unilateral closing of the road by the town was 
inconsistent with those statutory procedures, the town 
lacked power to close the road.

Fisher v. Big Y Foods, Inc., 298 Conn. 
414 (2010).

The court in this case was required to decide what facts 
and circumstances give rise to a plaintiff’s right to 
recover under the mode of operation rule, an exception 
to the traditional premises liability doctrine, which 
dispenses with the requirement that a plaintiff prove that 
a business owner had actual or constructive notice of 
the specific unsafe condition giving rise to the plaintiff’s 
injury. Chief Justice Rogers authored the majority 
opinion concluding that the mode of operation rule does 
not apply generally to all accidents caused by transitory 
hazards in self-service retail establishments, but, rather, 
only to those accidents that result from particular hazards 
that occur regularly, or are inherently foreseeable, due 
to some specific method of operation on the premises. 
Justice Palmer authored a dissenting opinion in which 
he argued that the mode of operation rule should apply 
to the entire premises of a self-service store and to all 
reasonably foreseeable hazards arising out of a business’ 
self-service mode of operation.

6

Bender v. Bender, 292 Conn. 696 
(2009).

The principal issue in this case was whether a state 
statute authorizing the Probate Court to determine title 
to property that constitutes a part of an estate confers 
jurisdiction over breach of contract action seeking 
damages or specific performance when the contract at 
issue involves property that is part of the estate. In an 
opinion authored by Justice Katz, the court concluded 
that the statute was intended to confer concurrent 
jurisdiction with the Superior Court to try title to real and 
personal property in cases in which a claim is made that 
the property is an asset of a trust, a decedent’s estate or 
any estate under the control of a conservator or guardian 
and that it was not intended to confer jurisdiction over 
breach of contract actions.

Coalition for Justice in Education 
Funding, Inc. v. Rell, 295 Conn. 240 
(2010).

The issue presented in this appeal was whether the 
Connecticut constitution guarantees students in our 
state’s public schools the right to a particular minimum 
quality of education. Justice Norcott authored an 
opinion in which a plurality of the court concluded 
that public school students are constitutionally entitled 
to an education suitable to give them a meaningful 
opportunity to be responsible citizens able to participate 
fully in democratic institutions, such as jury service 
and voting, and to leave them prepared to progress to 
institutions of higher education, or to attain productive 
employment and otherwise contribute to the state’s 
economy. In a concurring opinion, Justice Palmer 
agreed that the state constitution guarantees a minimally 
adequate education, but argued that the state has met 
this constitutional obligation unless what it has done is 
so lacking as to be unreasonable by any fair or objective 
standard. Justice Schaller authored a concurring opinion 
in which he emphasized the reasons for the educational 
standard adopted by the plurality and discussed the 
proper method for measuring educational adequacy and 
the appropriate remedy. Justice Vertefeuille argued in 
a dissenting opinion that the state constitution did not 
guarantee a suitable education to public school students, 
but was merely intended to ensure the perpetuation of a 
statewide system of free public schools. Justice Zarella 
authored a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the 
plaintiffs’ claim that the existing public school system 
was unconstitutional under the state constitution was not 
justiciable. Justice McLachlan joined in Justice Zarella’s 
dissenting opinion.

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Supreme Court During the Biennium

State v. DeJesus, 288 Conn. 418 
(2008).

Kerrigan v. Commissioner, 289 Conn. 
135 (2008).

In this case, the court considered whether it had the 
authority to reconsider the liberal standard for the 
admission of uncharged sexual misconduct evidence in 
sexual assault cases despite the adoption by the judges of 
the Superior Court of a code codifying the common-law 
rules of evidence. In an opinion authored by Chief Justice 
Rogers, the majority concluded that the adoption of the 
code of evidence did not divest the court of its inherent 
common-law authority to develop and change the rules of 
evidence on a case-by-case basis. Justice Katz authored a 
dissenting opinion in which she argued that it was within 
the exclusive purview of the evidence code oversight 
committee, the rules committee of the Superior Court and 
the judges of the Superior Court to make changes to the 
code of evidence.

State v. Salamon, 287 Conn. 509 
(2008).

The primary issue in this case was whether a person 
who restrains another person with the intent to prevent 
that person’s liberation may be convicted of kidnapping 
even though the restraint involved in the kidnapping is 
merely incidental to the commission of another offense 
perpetrated against the victim. Justice Palmer authored 
the majority opinion in which the court overruled its 
longstanding precedent to the contrary and concluded 
that, to commit a kidnapping in conjunction with another 
crime, the defendant must intend to prevent the victim’s 
liberation for a longer period of time or to a greater 
degree than that which is necessary to commit the other 
crime. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Zarella argued 
that a person may be convicted of kidnapping whenever 
the state has established, in addition to the elements of 
an unlawful restraint, the specific intent to prevent the 
victim’s liberation by using or threatening to use physical 
force or intimidation.

In this case, the court was required to determine whether 
this state’s statutory prohibition against same sex 
marriage violated the Connecticut constitution. In an 
opinion authored by Justice Palmer, the majority first 
concluded that gay persons are entitled to recognition as 
a quasi-suspect class under the equal provision clauses of 
the state constitution and, therefore, laws discriminating 
against them are subject to intermediate scrutiny. The 
majority concluded that the prohibition on same sex 
marriage was not substantially related to the achievement 
of any important governmental objectives and was 
therefore unconstitutional. Justice Borden authored 
a dissenting opinion in which he argued that sexual 
orientation does not constitute a suspect class and that 
there is no fundamental right to marry a person of the 
same sex. Accordingly, he argued, the prohibition against 
same sex marriage was subject to rational basis review. 
Justice Borden argued that, because the legislature 
rationally had been addressing the issue of same sex 
marriage in incremental steps, the prohibition was not 
unconstitutional. Justice Vertefeuille joined in Justice 
Borden’s dissenting opinion and, in a separate dissenting 
opinion, argued that his opinion demonstrated that the 
plaintiffs had failed to establish that the prohibition 
on same sex marriage was unconstitutional beyond a 
reasonable doubt. Justice Zarella authored a dissenting 
opinion in which he argued that same sex couples 
are not similarly situated to opposite sex couples for 
purposes of the state’s marriage laws because they are 
not capable of procreative sexual conduct. Accordingly, 
he concluded that the equal protection provisions of 
the state constitution had not been implicated by the 
plaintiffs’ claims. He further argued that, because there is 
no fundamental right to marry a person of the same sex, 
the prohibition was subject to rational basis review under 
due process principles. Justice Zarella concluded that the 
state had a legitimate interest in promoting and regulating 
procreative conduct and that the marriage laws were 
rationally related to that interest.

8

Ziotas v. Reardon, 196 Conn. 579 
(2010).

The issue in this case was whether a year-end bonus, 
the amount of which is discretionary, constitutes wages 
under a state statute imposing civil and criminal penalties 
on employers that have failed to pay wages due to their 
employees. In an opinion authored by Chief Justice 
Rogers, the court concluded that, because the relationship 
between performance and compensation is attenuated 
when the amount of a bonus is discretionary, because the 
legislature has demonstrated that it knows how to define 
wages broadly when it intends to do so and because 
the imposition of civil and criminal penalties when the 
amount of a bonus is indeterminate and discretionary 
would raise questions of fundamental fairness and due 
process, the wage statute does not apply to discretionary 
bonuses.

Bysiewicz v. Dinardo, 298 Conn. 748 
(2010). 

In this case, the plaintiff, who intended to run for 
election to the office of Attorney General of the state 
of Connecticut, sought a declaratory judgment on the 
question of whether she met the requirements of a state 
statute that required the Attorney General to “be an 
elector of this state and an attorney at law of  
at least ten years’ active practice at the bar of this  
state. …” The plaintiff, who was the secretary of the 
state, claimed that her performance of the duties of 
that office constituted the active practice of law under 
the statute. The intervening defendant, the Connecticut 
Republican Party, claimed that a candidate for the office 
of Attorney General must have had ten years experience 
in litigating cases in court or, in the alternative, the 
candidate must have engaged in conduct that requires a 
high degree of legal skill on behalf of a client. Justice 
Norcott authored an opinion in which the majority 

concluded that the statute requires the Attorney General 
to have experience in litigating cases. The majority 
further concluded that, even if the statute did not contain 
such a requirement, to qualify to serve as the Attorney 
General, a person must have engaged in activities that are 
commonly understood to be the practice of law and that 
require the high degree of legal skill and great capacity 
for adaptation to difficult and complex situations; the 
candidate must have done so as the principal means of 
earning his or her livelihood for at least ten years; and the 
candidate must have performed these duties on behalf of 
clients. In a concurring opinion, Judge Bishop agreed that 
the plaintiff did not meet the requirements of the statute 
because she had not represented clients and had not 
actively practiced law, but argued that the statute did not 
require litigation experience.

New England Estates, LLC v. 
Branford, 294 Conn. 817 (2010).

The cited in defendants, Thomas Santa Barbara, Jr., 
and Frank Perrotti, Jr., owned a property in the town 
of Branford. The plaintiff, New England Estates, LLC, 
had an option to purchase the property, and submitted 
to the town a proposal to develop the property as an 
affordable housing development. Thereafter, the town 
voted to acquire the property by eminent domain. The 
plaintiff then initiated an action against the town under 
a federal civil rights statute, claiming that the taking 
had been in bad faith and violated the takings clause of 
the fifth amendment of the United States constitution. A 
jury found in favor of the plaintiff and the owners and 
awarded them damages. The town appealed, claiming 
that the trial court had lacked jurisdiction over the civil 
rights action because the plaintiff and the owners had 
failed to seek an injunction ordering the return of the 
property. Justice McLachlan authored an opinion in 
which the court concluded that, because the extent of the 

9

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Supreme Court During the Biennium

taking was not in doubt, and because the plaintiff had 
claimed that the taking did not comply with the public 
use requirement of the takings clause, the trial court had 
jurisdiction over the civil rights claim. The court also 
concluded, however, that the plaintiff’s unexercised 
option to purchase the land was not a property interest 
that was protected by the takings clause. The town further 
claimed on appeal that the owners’ recovery was barred 
because their claims already had been litigated in a 
separate proceeding to determine just compensation for 
the taking. The court concluded that, because the measure 
of damages in the two proceedings was different, the civil 
rights claim was not barred. Finally, the court rejected 
the town’s claim that the public use clause of the fifth 
amendment prohibits only a taking of private property 
for a use that is not a public use and does not provide a 
remedy for a taking that is undertaken in bad faith or one 
that constitutes an abuse of power.

Maturo v. Maturo, 296 Conn. 80 
(2010).

In this marital dissolution case, the trial court rendered 
a child support award that included a set dollar amount 
per week plus 20 percent of the defendant’s annual net 
cash bonus. The defendant claimed that the amount 
of the award based on the annual net cash bonus was 
improper because it was inconsistent with the governing 
child support guidelines and was not based on the needs 
of the children. The plaintiff claimed that, because 
the couple’s income exceeded the maximum amount 
listed in the guidelines, the trial court was not bound 
by the guidelines and had broad discretion to determine 
the amount of the child support award. In an opinion 
authored by Justice Zarella, a plurality of the court noted 
that the child support guidelines provide that the required 

support payment when the combined net weekly income 
of the family is $4000 is 15.89 percent of income. The 
plurality also noted that the guidelines indicate that the 
child support obligation as a percentage of income should 
decline as income rises. The plurality concluded that the 
principles set forth in the guidelines apply to all cases, 
even when the family income exceeds the maximum 
income scheduled in the guidelines. Accordingly, the 
plurality concluded that the award of 20 percent of the 
defendant’s annual net cash bonus violated the guideline 
principles. In addition, the plurality concluded that, 
although the trial court had the discretion to deviate from 
the guidelines if doing so was required to meet the needs 
of the children, the trial court had not found that the 
deviation was required for that purpose. Justice Schaller 
authored a concurring opinion in which he disagreed 
with the plurality’s conclusion that the principles in the 
child support guidelines were controlling and argued 
that fluctuating bonus income by its very nature cannot 
provide the basis for an award based on the children’s 
needs. Justice McLachan authored a concurring opinion 
in which he agreed with the plurality’s analysis and 
argued that child support awards should be based on 
gross income, not net income. Justice Vertefeuille 
authored a dissenting opinion in which she argued that 
child support guidelines were not controlling in this case; 
even if they were controlling, the award of 20 percent of 
the defendant’s annual net cash bonus did not constitute 
an abuse of discretion under the guidelines; the trial court 
properly considered the family’s standard of living when 
it entered the child support award; and the trial court 
was not limited to considering the physical needs of the 
children. Justice Katz and Justice Palmer joined Justice 
Vertefeuille’s dissenting opinion.

Appellate Court

The Appellate Court reviews decisions of 
the Superior Court to determine if errors 
of law have occurred.

There are nine Appellate Court judges, 
one of whom is designated by the Chief 
Justice to be the Chief Judge. Generally, 

three judges hear and decide a case,

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Appellate Court  
During the Biennium

The Bank of New York, as Trustee 
(BS ALT A 2005-9) v. Sonja J. Bell, 
120 Conn. App. 837, cert. dismissed, 
298 Conn. 917 (2010)

The petition for review, brought pursuant to General 
Statutes § 51-164x (c) and Practice Book § 77-1, 
required the Appellate Court to determine whether the 
trial court had abused its discretion by sealing three 
documents in the underlying foreclosure action. The 
bank’s motion for summary judgment and motion for a 
judgment of strict foreclosure were granted by the trial 
court. Thereafter the defendant filed a motion to dismiss 
the action claiming that the bank had no authority to 
prosecute the action because it had not demonstrated 
that is was a holder or owner of the subject note at the 
time the action was commenced. The court vacated the 
judgment of strict foreclosure and ordered a hearing on 
the motion to dismiss. On the first day of the hearing, 
the bank filed a motion to seal certain documents it had 
obtained to demonstrate that it owned the note. The court 
granted the motion to seal three documents. Thereafter 
the defendant’s husband, the petitioner, filed a petition 
for review, challenging the sealing order. The Appellate 
Court granted the petition for review and granted the 
relief requested. The Appellate Court determined that 
two of the documents were judicial documents because 
the bank had attached them to its motion for summary 
judgment and its objection to the defendant’s motion to 
dismiss, noting that judicial documents are presumed 
open to the public. Furthermore, the plaintiff had waived 
any right it may have had to have the documents sealed 

when it attached them to its pleadings, without filing 
a prior motion to seal the documents. Moreover, in 
its sealing order, the trial court granted the defendant, 
her counsel and the petitioner permission to see the 
documents, but would not permit them disclose the 
information in them to the public. The Appellate Court 
concluded that a party may not pick and choose to whom 
it will disclose documents. The confidentiality privilege 
is waived as to all when the documents are disclosed 
to one. The trial court therefore abused its discretion 
by sealing two of the documents. The Appellate Court 
also concluded that the trial court improperly sealed 
the two documents because they allegedly contained 
the plaintiff’s trade secrets. The record is devoid of 
evidence as to the nature of the information contained 
in the documents, why that information is economically 
valuable to the plaintiff and how disclosure of the 
information could harm the plaintiff. The Appellate Court 
also concluded that the trial court abused its discretion 
by sealing a third document, containing a schedule of its 
loans. The Appellate Court noted that the information in 
the third document, although not accessible in a single 
location, is in the collective land records, which are in 
the public domain. Moreover, the plaintiff submitted no 
proof from which the trial court could have concluded 
that either federal or state banking laws precluded the 
disclosure of the information in the third document. 
The trial court articulated no factual findings that would 
support the existence of a substantial privacy interest 
that outweighs the public’s interest in open access to the 
document. The trial court therefore abused its discretion 
by sealing the documents. The Appellate Court vacated 
the sealing order.

Red 11, LLC v. Conservation 
Commission, 117 Conn. App. 630, 
cert. denied, 294 Conn. 918 (2009) 

The plaintiff owned an 18 acre parcel of land in Fairfield 
that contained three distinct wetlands and watercourse 
areas. In 2001, the town’s wetlands compliance officer 
issued a cease and desist order with regard to certain 
activities occurring on the property that impacted these 
three areas. At a hearing, a representative of the plaintiff 
indicated that a farm would be created on the property. 
General Statutes § 22a-40 and local regulations expressly 
permit farming activities as of right in wetlands and 
watercourse areas. The plaintiff subsequently submitted 
a plan of its proposed activities. The defendant, the 
conservation commission, issued a declatory ruling that 
the proposed farming activities did not require a wetlands 
permit and removed the cease and desist order, subject to 
various conditions.

In 2003, the wetlands compliance officer issued a cease 
and desist order, alleging that the plaintiff had engaged in 
the filling, piping, draining and excavating wetlands and 
watercourse areas without a permit and had prevented 
an inspection of the property. At the hearing before 
the defendant, the plaintiff claimed that its actions 
were permissible as farming activity. The commission 
disagreed and sustained the cease and desist order. The 
wetlands compliance officer issued two more cease 
and desist orders with regard to activities occurring 
on the property. Ultimately, three appeals were filed to 
the Superior Court, which affirmed the actions of the 
defendant. The plaintiff filed a petition to appeal to the 
Appellate Court, which was granted.

The Appellate Court began its analysis with a recitation 
of the history, legislative finding and purpose of the 
Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act, General Statute § 
22a-36 through § 22a-45. General Statute § 22a-32 states 
that no regulated activity shall be conducted in wetlands 
without a permit; however, General Statutes § 22a-40 sets 
forth certain exceptions from this requirement, including 
one for farming activities. Such exceptions, however, are 
strictly construed and those seeking their benefit must 
prove they are so entitled. Additionally, the General 
Assembly placed certain limitations on the farming 
activities. Significantly, General Statutes § 22a-40 (a) (1) 
does not permit the filling or reclamation of wetlands or 
watercourses with continual flow.

The Appellate Court first concluded that the defendant 
had jurisdiction to determined whether the plaintiff’s 
activities were within the farming exception of § 22a-40 
(a) (1). The Appellate Court then interpreted the statutory 
farming exception and the limitations on that exception. 
The plaintiff had argued that the limitation on the filling 
or reclamation only applied to wetlands with continual 
flow. The Appellate Court rejected that reading of the 
statutory limitation on the bases of general principles 
of statutory construction and prior case law. It thus 
concluded that the filling or reclamation of wetlands, 
irrespective of whether there was continual flow,  
required a permit. Lastly, the court determined that 
sufficient evidence existed in the record to support the 
defendant’s decisions.

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Appellate Court During the Biennium

Brown v. United Technologies Corp., 
112 Conn. App. 492 (2009), appeal 
dismissed, 297 Conn. 54 (2010) 

The plaintiff appealed from the decision of the workers’ 
compensation review board (board) vacating the 
decision of the workers’ compensation commissioner 
(commissioner) granting her application for benefits for 
injuries she sustained while power walking during an 
unpaid lunch break on the employer’s premises. During 
one of her routine walks, she fell and tore a tendon in her 
shoulder. She testified before the commissioner that she 
walked daily for the purpose of improving her health. 
The board rejected the commissioner’s finding that the 
plaintiff’s injury was incidental to her employment 
and found no mutual benefit to both parties from the 
plaintiff’s activities. The Appellate Court affirmed the 
decision of the board. In reaching that decision, the 
court first concluded that the board improperly rejected 
the commissioner’s determination that the plaintiff’s 
injury was incidental to her employment because it 
satisfied the “arises out of” and “in the course of” tests 
for compensability. However, the court concluded that 
the social-recreational exception of § 31-275 (16) (B) (i) 
precluded coverage because the injury occurred while 
the plaintiff was engaged in an act for her relaxation or 
enjoyment on the employer’s premises, even though her 
employer acquiesced in her activity. The court reached 
this determination on the basis of the legislative history 
of the statute, the dictionary definition of “recreation” and 
instructive case law from other jurisdictions.

State v. Graves, 114 Conn. App. 852 
(2009)

The defendant was convicted following a jury trial 
of reckless driving, failure to bring a motor vehicle 
to a full stop when signaled to do so by an officer, 
reckless endangerment in the first degree, interfering 
with an officer and possession of marijuana. At trial, 
the defendant moved to suppress evidence of a brown 
paper bag containing marijuana, claiming that, under the 
fourth amendment to the United States constitution, the 
evidence was the fruit of an illegal search and seizure 
by the police. The trial court denied the motion and 
the defendant, on appeal, challenged that ruling. The 
Appellate Court upheld the judgment of the trial court.

The evidence demonstrated that a Rhode Island police 
officer stopped the defendant in Rhode Island for 
speeding. The defendant stopped his automobile in a 
relatively remote location near the Connecticut border 
and was not forthcoming with the officer’s inquiries. 
During that stop, the Rhode Island officer detected 
the odor of marijuana emanating from the defendant’s 
automobile and observed a brown paper bag on the 
passenger’s seat. When the officer stepped away from 
the defendant’s automobile and returned to his cruiser to 
check on the defendant’s paperwork, the defendant sped 
away. The Rhode Island officer pursued the defendant 
into Connecticut at high speeds, ultimately losing sight 
of the defendant’s automobile. The Rhode Island officer 
contacted the Connecticut state police. Connecticut 
officers, accompanied by several Rhode Island officers, 
proceeded to the defendant’s North Stonington residence. 
There, without obtaining a search warrant, the officers 
discovered the defendant’s automobile parked in a 
location not visible from the road, behind the residence. 

14

The police observed that it no longer contained the brown 
paper bag observed by the Rhode Island officer. Less 
than an hour later, while retracing the route along which 
he had pursued the defendant, the Rhode Island officer 
who had stopped the defendant found and seized a brown 
paper bag, identical to that he had observed earlier in the 
defendant’s automobile, located in an open field. The 
defendant sought to suppress the bag and the contraband 
therein.

The Appellate Court rejected the defendant’s several 
claims challenging the constitutionality of the police 
conduct that resulted in the discovery and seizure of the 
brown paper bag. First, the Appellate Court rejected the 
defendant’s claim that the hot pursuit exception to the 
warrant requirement did not apply to the warrantless 
search on his property. The court concluded that the 
search of the defendant’s property occurred within five 
minutes from the time that the high speed automobile 
chase had ended and, thus, that the search of the property 
had occurred incident to the hot pursuit of the defendant. 
Second, the Appellate Court rejected the defendant’s 
claim that the Rhode Island officer could lawfully not 
conduct a warrantless search in Connecticut. The court 
reasoned that, given the defendant’s reliance solely upon 
his rights under the fourth amendment, the fact that 
the search was made by an officer from a jurisdiction 
outside of Connecticut did not render the police action 
unconstitutional. Third, the Appellate Court rejected the 
defendant’s claim that the warrantless search of the open 
field where the Rhode Island officer discovered the brown 
paper bag did not fall into any recognized exceptions 
to the warrant requirement. The court reasoned that the 
defendant lacked any legitimate privacy interest in the 
open field and that, without violating the defendant’s 
constitutional rights, any officer or private citizen could 
have discovered the contraband and have handed it over 
to the police.

State v. Zapata, 119 Conn. App. 660, 
cert. denied, 296 Conn. 906 (2010)

The defendant was arrested in Tennessee in 2006 in 
connection with the murder of Zoltan Kiss in Bridgeport 
in 2001. The jury reasonably could have found that 
the defendant and others robbed the victim during a 
drug transaction and shot him as he ran away. The 
jury convicted the defendant of murder with a firearm, 
conspiracy to commit murder with a firearm and 
carrying a pistol without a permit. Due to the nature and 
circumstances of the crime, the court ordered the state to 
disclose the names and statements of potential witnesses 
only to defense counsel and consulting investigators, 
and that the information was not to leave the courthouse. 
During trial, the court ordered the defendant not to 
gesture to gain the attention of the jury. The defendant 
disobeyed the court’s repeated order and was placed 
in handcuffs as ordered by the court. During the 
presentation of evidence, it came to the court’s attention 
that an unusual surname, also the surname of one of 
the jurors, was contained in what was presumed to be 
the victim’s cellular telephone. The court proposed to 
inquire into possible juror impartiality. The prosecutor 
requested that the inquiry be held in-chambers, without 
the defendant, due to safety concerns and to prevent 
the disclosure of names to the public. Previously, a 
witness had testified that the defendant threatened to 
kill certain witnesses. The court agreed, but ordered 
that the in-chambers conference be recorded. Defense 
counsel objected to the defendant’s absence, but the court 
ruled that the defendant’s rights were being protected. 
Following the inquiry, the court did not dismiss the juror. 

15

Noteworthy Cases Heard by the Appellate Court During the Biennium

On appeal, the defendant claimed that the court had 
denied him due process under both the state and federal 
constitutions. The Appellate Court agreed that the in-
chambers inquiry was a critical stage of the proceedings 
that violated the defendant’s rights to due process. 
It concluded, however, that the state had proved that 
the constitutional violations were harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt. The Appellate Court, citing United 
States Supreme Court precedent, found that a defendant 
has a due process right to be present whenever his or her 
presence has a relation, reasonably substantial, to his or 
her full opportunity to defend against the charges and to 
the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted 
by his or her absence. For purposes of due process, a 
defendant has a right to be present during proceedings 
concerning jury tampering. The Appellate Court 
determined, however, that the constitutional violation 
was not structural error because the state proved that 
the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The 
person whose name appeared in the cellular telephone 
in question was a sibling of one of the jurors, but the 
sibling and juror did not know the defendant, had not 
discussed the case other than “I’m in court/I’m leaving 
court.”  There were no factual findings that the name and 

number appeared in the phone for a reason other than 
a wrong number that the victim and the sibling spoke 
to one another and what they spoke about. The juror 
assured that court that the juror had not been exposed to 
information about the case that had not been presented 
at trial and that the juror could be fair and impartial. The 
Appellate Court noted that the trial court had discretion 
to put the juror’s credibility in context during the inquiry. 
The defendant argued on appeal that had he been present, 
he may have been able to suggest questions to counsel 
to elicit information that the juror had extra judicial 
information about the defendant. The issue concerning 
the juror arose as a result of the juror’s last name, an 
unusual one that was known to the defendant during 
voir dire. Furthermore, the defendant was permitted to 
consult with counsel prior to the in-chambers hearing. 
The defendant also argued on appeal that his absence 
from the in-chambers proceeding denied him the right 
to counsel. The Appellate Court noted that defense 
counsel twice objected to the procedure and during the 
procedure, was permitted to ask questions and make 
objections. The court granted a recess prior to the in-
chambers proceeding during which time the defendant 
could consult with counsel. The defendant suggested 
that he might have posed questions to counsel during 
the in-chambers proceeding, but he did not identify what 
those questions were and how the juror would respond. 
Moreover, the defendant was free to consult with counsel 
at the conclusion of the in-chambers proceeding and 
counsel could have brought any concerns to the attention 
of the court. The Appellate Court also concluded that the 
defendant’s absence from the in-chambers proceeding 
did not deprive him of the presumption of innocence. The 
defendant claimed that, if the juror was fearful him, the 
juror would not presume that the defendant was innocent. 
The claim was hypothetical, as the prosecutor requested 
the in-chambers proceeding due to the fear one witnesses 
expressed about the defendant. The Appellate Court also 
rejected the defendant’s claim that the court improperly 
charged the jury.

Doing More with Less

The Judicial Branch’s guiding force 
in doing more with less has been 
its comprehensive strategic plan 
developed by the Public Service and 
Trust Commission at the request of 
Chief Justice Chase T. Rogers. The 
Commission’s report led to the creation of 
many committees that either were or are 
currently charged with implementing the 
hundreds of recommendations proffered 
by the plan. All of the committees’ work 
is posted on the Judicial Branch’s website.

In these difficult economic times, the plan has provided a 
framework for Connecticut courts to continue serving the 
public amid significant budgetary constraints. 

The changes that have occurred as a result of the strategic 
plan, listed by topic, include:

Access: Americans with Disabilities 
Act (ADA)

v  Created ADA webpage.

v  Wheelchair accessibility posted online, along with 

request for accommodation forms and information on 
how to file a complaint. 

v  Identified and trained local ADA contact people in 
every Branch office to assist with ADA requests.

v  All new and revised Branch forms now contain 
standard information on ADA requests for 
accommodation. 

v  Magnifying glasses purchased, for less than $120, 

for every clerk’s office, Court Service Center, Public 
Information Desk and Law Library to assist people 
with limited vision.

v  The Branch has adopted the free, national 

711 telephone relay service as its standard for 
communicating by telephone with deaf and hard of 
hearing individuals, and it is now noted on all new  
and revised forms and publications. 

Access: Limited English Proficiency 
(LEP)

v  Through the use of an outside contractor, expanded 

and enhanced the Judicial Branch’s ability to provide 
near instant access to more than 170 languages at a 
fraction of the cost of providing translators.  

Access: Information/Privacy

v  Reviewed over 800 Judicial Branch forms to  
eliminate requests for unnecessary personal  
identifying information. 

v  The Rules Committee passed and the judges adopted 
Practice Book rules prohibiting certain information 
and establishing procedures to follow when such 
information must be submitted. 

21

Doing More with Less

The Branch summoned 
15,000 fewer jurors last 
year, resulting in savings of 
about $30,000.

Delivery of Services: Alternatives to 
Court Appearances

v  Through a $1.2 million federal grant, installed video 

conferencing equipment and trained staff.

parties.

v  Targeted areas include competency hearings of 

defendants at Connecticut Valley Hospital (CVH) and 
certain criminal proceedings. 

Delivery of Services: Jury

v  A successful pilot project was completed in the 

Stamford Superior Court to reduce the number of 
summonses issued. These principles were thereafter 
applied in Meriden and Middletown to reduce the 
number of summonses issued in those locations and 
are being rolled out statewide. The Branch summoned 
15,000 fewer jurors last year, resulting in savings of 
about $30,000.  

v  Improving communication with jurors by conducting a 
satisfaction survey, providing more information online 
and upgrading brochures for employees, employers 
and members of the armed forces.

Delivery of Services: Problem Solving 
in Family Matters

v  Created a pilot program problem-solving session  
for the Family Support Magistrate Division in  
New Haven. 

Delivery of Services:  
Self-Represented Parties

v  Created a volunteer attorney pilot program for self-

represented parties in family courts in Hartford. Work 
is under way to expand the program to Waterbury.

v  Created a pilot courthouse information officer program 
to assist self-represented parties and other members of 
the public. 

v  Created plain language brochures for self-represented 

Accountability: Courthouse 
Observation and Simulation Team

v  Conducts regular and ongoing observations of court 
facilities of all types to assess the quality of service 
delivery, the effectiveness of service excellence 
training, and the need for any subject matter education 
for staff.

Accountability: Public Service 
Excellence (PSE)

v  Developing a new service excellence program  

that is based upon principles that represent what is 
important and fundamental to the people served by  
the Judicial Branch. 

v  These principles will serve as a road map to members 
of the Judicial Branch as the Branch carries out its 
mission to enhance the public’s trust and confidence.

The Administrative Services Division provides centralized 
services to assist judges and Judicial Branch employees. 
Such services include: monitoring and analysis of the 
Branch’s General Fund budget; payroll administration; 
revenue and expenditure accounting and payment 
of the Branch’s financial obligations; coordination of 
personnel and labor relations functions and employee 
benefits administration; capital budget development

materials management; purchasing and warehousing 
and internal auditing.

Highlights of the past two years include:

v  Hartford Criminal Courthouse Garage: A condition assessment study 
confirmed that the 510-vehicle garage has extensive deterioration to the 
deck and structural elements. Construction for the $2.8 million repair 
project began in March 2010 and is projected to be completed March 2011.

v  Litchfield Judicial District Courthouse at Torrington: The Department 
of Public Works (DPW) closed on the Timken Property in Torrington, site 
of the new Litchfield JD courthouse in January 2009. The courthouse is 
expected to be approximately 170,000 square feet with eight courtrooms 
and two hearing rooms, costing $65 million. DPW projects a completion 
date of 2014 and is in the process of selecting a design/construction team 
for the project. 

v  Meriden JD/GA Court and Milford JD/GA Court: Ownership of these 
two courthouses was transferred to the Judicial Branch from the respective 
cities this biennium. Milford Court was transferred in September 2008 
and Meriden Court was transferred in September 2009. Both were 20-year 
lease-to-purchase agreements with the cities of Meriden and Milford.

v   Energy Conservation: Lighting retrofit and/or HVAC upgrades were 
completed in Danbury, Danielson, Stamford and Waterbury during this 
biennium. Energy conservation is a priority of the Judicial Branch, which 
will continue to find ways to conserve scarce energy resources and  
reduce costs.

v  Security Improvements: The Branch implemented 

numerous security-related upgrades at various 
court locations statewide. Those upgrades included 
the purchase of weapon detection equipment and 
installation of video surveillance, duress alarms and 
electronic guard tour systems.

v  Revenue Accounting: Fiscal Administration provided 
the accounting framework for accurately identifying 
and distributing fees to the IOLTA (Interest on 
Lawyers Trust Accounts) program for compliance with 
Public Act 09-152. For the fiscal year ending June 
30, 2010, this involved disbursements exceeding $9 
million for receipts from over 130,000 entries. 

Energy conservation is a  
priority of the Judicial 
Branch, and it will continue 
to find ways to conserve 
scarce energy resources and 
reduce costs.

v   Probate Court Consolidation and Restructuring: 
The Administrative Services Division’s Human 
Resource Management Unit was instrumental in 
providing assistance to the Office of the Probate  
Court Administrator during the biennial reporting 
period. This was in accordance with Public Act  
09-114, An Act Concerning Probate Court Reforms 
and Establishing a Probate Redistricting Commission. 
With the assistance of the Judicial Branch’s Human 
Resource Management Unit, the Probate Court 
Administrator developed a uniform staffing pattern as 
well as compensation and benefit packages. 

v  Technology Enhancements: These include the 

Human Resources On-Line Application system, which 
allows applicants to apply for most Branch positions 
online. It also streamlines the review and assessments 
of applications. Another technology enhancement 
is the Learning Management System, which allows 
divisions to track and schedule training for employees.

for assessing and developing a community re-entry plan for sex offenders 
incarcerated six months or more before their probation term begins. 
In addition, day reporting programs for unemployed sex offenders on 
probation residing in homeless shelters have been implemented in New 
Haven and Hartford. 

v  A 2010 evaluation of the federally supported Women Offender Case 

Management (WOCM) project showed that women probationers who 
were placed on the special caseload had 26 percent lower recidivism rates 
than those on regular caseloads for the year following the end of their 
probation. The WOCM units currently operate in New Haven, Bridgeport, 
New Britain and Hartford. Eight probation officers have been specifically 
trained in the gender responsive supervision model. WOCM units are 
being planned for statewide expansion during 2011.

Probation officers specially trained in sex offender services 
were added to the Probation Transition Program.

The New Haven Juvenile Detention Center in 2010 received 
the Barbara Allen-Hagen Award from the Council of Juvenile 
Correctional Administrators.

v  The Juvenile Probation Unit was awarded 
accreditation by the American Correctional 
Association in July 2010 after receiving a score of 100 
percent compliance with all its 228 practice standards. 

v  In 2009, all of the juvenile detention centers were 
reaccredited through the American Correctional 
Institution and, in 2010 all of the detention centers 
were reaccredited through the National Commission 
on Correctional Healthcare. In addition, the New 
Haven Juvenile Detention Center in 2010 received 
the Barbara Allen-Hagen Award from the Council of 
Juvenile Correctional Administrators.

Court Support Services Division

v  To ensure that information is readily available for the 
Results Based Accountability (RBA) reports requested 
by the Legislature, CSSD has enhanced the measures 
it employs to evaluate its risk reduction tools. The 
RBA reports measure three key areas: the amount of 
work done by the adult probation system; how well 
the system works; and who is better off as a result of 
the services provided. In the third quarter of the 2010 
calendar year, adult probation met or exceeded each of 
the 10 performance goals.

v  The CSSD Training Academy expanded the number of 
its offerings in all disciplines and improved the quality 
of its training. Some of the enhancements include: the 
utilization of online curriculum and discipline-based 
software; the addition of gender responsive training 
on both the juvenile and adult levels; and a five-day 
cultural competency training program.

v  The CSSD Training Academy and the Connecticut 

Department of Veterans’ Affairs worked together for 
the benefit of both organizations. Veterans’ Affairs 
offered the academy space at its campus in Rocky Hill, 
a move that allowed the expansion of safety training 
for probation officers. In return, CSSD community 
service crews and academy staff helped clean rooms 
and renovate space at the veterans’ facility. To date, 
more than 550 probation officers have been trained 
in the newly renovated facility, while veterans at the 
hospital benefit from the upgraded hospital facilities 
and now occupy nearly 90 units of the refurbished 
housing.

External Affairs

v  The External Affairs Division has played an integral 

role in implementing the rules changes adopted by the 
Superior Court judges in 2007, regarding the use of 
electronic devices in courtrooms by the news media. 
The Hartford Pilot Program has been in effect since 
January 1, 2008. Over the past nearly three years, 97 
court proceedings have been photographed, videotaped 
or audiotaped as part of the pilot program.

v  Since January 1, 2008, when the Connecticut Practice 
Book rule regarding camera coverage of arraignments 
took effect, the External Affairs Division has received 
and processed requests from the media to videotape, 
photograph and audiotape arraignments. Over the past 
nearly three years, the number of requests granted 
by judges has grown. In 2008, for example, judges 
granted 196 requests throughout the state; in 2009, 
they granted 295. Through November 19, 2010, judges 
had granted a total of 340 requests. 

v  The Speakers Bureau remains the Branch’s primary 
outreach effort to civic organizations. Nearly 200 
organizations had a judge address their group over 
the biennium. This program was enhanced by the 
development of a statistics page on the Judicial 
Branch’s website that provides information to judges 
who are part of the Speakers Bureau (and others  
as well).

v  Over the past two fiscal years, the External Affairs 

Division has addressed nearly 3,800 media inquiries. 
The Division also served as staff liaison to the Judicial 
Media Committee and assisted with the Branch’s first 
ever Journalism School for Judges in 2009, and the 
Branch’s second Law School for Journalists in 2010.

v  The Intern Program administered by the External 
Affairs Division continues to be an integral part 
of the Judicial Branch’s outreach to students. In 
calendar year 2008, 401 college students successfully 
completed an internship; in calendar year 2009, 407 
college students successfully completed an internship. 

These college students collectively provided 128,119 
hours to the Judicial Branch with a net value of $2.6 
million.

v  The External Affairs Division provides opportunities 
for high school students to learn about the Judicial 
Branch through a variety of programs including the 
eight-week Court Aide Program, where high school 
seniors can volunteer to work in the courts and 
accumulate community service hours that can be 
applied toward graduation requirements. In addition, 
the Job Shadow Program provides high school 
students with the opportunity to shadow a Judicial 
Branch employee of their choice for one day with  
the goal of enhancing students’ understanding of the 
court system.

v  The External Affairs Division also provides students 
and members of the public with the opportunity 
to visit the Supreme Court courtroom and to learn 
about its role in our democracy. Nearly 500 tours and 
presentations have been conducted over the biennium.

Judges addressed nearly  
200 organizations as part  
of the Speakers Bureau.

v  Through its work with the External Affairs Advisory 
Board, the Division enhanced the Branch’s outreach 
to schools. For example, the External Affairs Division 
established a program where teachers, as part of their 
professional development, visit their local courthouse, 
observe court proceedings and discuss the criminal 
justice system with a judge. In addition, the External 
Affairs Division worked closely with the Consortium 
for Law and Citizenship Education, Inc. to develop a 
workbook for upper elementary schools. The book was 
very popular, with over 15,000 workbooks distributed.

The Information Technology Division (ITD) consists 
of Judicial Information Systems (JIS) and the 
Commission on Official Legal Publications (COLP). 
The Division designs, develops, implements and 
maintains the Judicial Branch’s complex network of 
data and information processing, storage, retrieval, 
dissemination and printing systems for the Branch, the 
legal community and the public. ITD also manages the 
HelpDesk, which provides assistance to thousands of 
users. In addition, the Division performs a crucial role in 
the development and maintenance of the website. 

Highlights of the past two years include:

v  A pilot program with the State Police and the Capitol Region Council of 
Governments is currently under way to issue e-citations instead of paper 
infraction tickets and transmit the data to the Centralized Infractions 
Bureau. The project, which is funded by a federal grant, began the pilot 
phase with 35 State Police cars outfitted with e-citation capabilities. In  
just under two months 2,678 e-citations were issued generating $511,804 
in fines. 

v  The Protective Order Registry has been modified to provide information to 
the Gun Registry with the goal of preventing people who are the subject of 
a protective order from obtaining a gun permit. 

v  The video conferencing project, funded by a federal grant, remains on 

schedule with the primary goal of installing systems in each of the state’s 
courthouses. The increased usage of video conferencing within the Branch, 
including for various administrative meetings, provides significant savings 
by eliminating transportation costs and staff overtime. It also minimizes 
the risk to public safety by keeping inmates within Department of 
Correction control at its facilities. Video or audio conferencing is available 
in 30 court locations encompassing a combination of criminal, civil and 
juvenile courtrooms − including the Appellate Court. In addition, adult 
probation officers use video conferencing to conduct jail re-interviews.

31

v  ITD opened its Alternate Processing Center at the 400 
Grand Street courthouse in Waterbury. The Alternate 
Processing Center mirrors the Judicial Branch’s 
archival storage systems that are located at the main 
Data Center in East Hartford and provides a disaster 
recovery site and backup for a number of our mission-
critical Legacy applications.

v  The Appellate System’s Case Management System 
has been rewritten using the most current web and 
database technologies. Future plans include creation 
of a Public Web Inquiry for appellate cases as well as 
electronic filing.

The increased usage of  
video conferencing within the 
Branch, including for various 
administrative meetings, 
provides significant savings 
by eliminating transportation 
costs and staff overtime.

A video conferencing hearing room

v  Thirty-seven courtrooms in courthouses throughout 
the state, including the Appellate courtroom, were 
equipped with For the Record (FTR) digital recording 
equipment during the past biennium. As of December 
2010, 134 of 269 – or half the courtrooms in the  
state – were equipped with this recording equipment. 
FTR records and digitally saves a record of all 
courtroom proceedings. 

v  ITD continues to work as a partner with the Court 

Operations Division in the development of electronic 
filing (e-filing) services. In December 2009 
programming was completed to allow nearly all of the 
remaining civil case types to be e-fileable. Also that 
month, e-filing became mandatory for all attorneys/
firms for the e-fileable case types. A month later, every 
new e-fileable civil case became paperless. As a result 
of these enhancements, public access to paperless 
cases was made available electronically in all Judicial 
Branch courthouses. As of June 2010, over 1,105,599 
electronic documents have been e-filed by 4,959 
attorneys/law firms since the system implementation 
on July 1, 2004.

The Superior Court Operations Division assists the 
Judicial Branch in the administration of justice by 
providing quality services and information to the  
court, its users and the community in an effective, 
professional and courteous manner. The Division 
provides judges and support staff with the resources 
needed to process cases. 

Highlights of the past two years include:

v  The Office of Victim Services unveiled a new program that provides 

victims of crime with timely and crucial information regarding offenders. 
CT SAVIN (Connecticut Statewide Automated Victim Information and 
Notification) allows crime victims and others to sign up for e-mail or 
telephone alerts updating them on the status of a specific offender going 
through the court system. 

v  The Office of Victim Services, in compliance with Public Act 09-03, 

established a program to train sexual assault forensic examiners and made 
them available to victims at participating acute care hospitals.

v  The Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel opened 725 lawyer discipline 
files and closed 667 cases. Disposition times for lawyer discipline cases 
remain at least twice as fast as the national average. The office also opened 
192 unauthorized practice of law files and closed 189. These included 
many out-of-state debt negotiation and foreclosure rescue scams. The 
office recovered over $300,000 in money paid to these individuals by 
Connecticut consumers.

v  The Statewide Bar Counsel’s Office continued its transition to handling 
matters electronically. These include: an online attorney registration 
system; an online multi-jurisdictional practice notification and payment 
system; online grievance histories of attorneys; and the ability to pay the 
client security fund fee electronically.

v  As of December 2009, almost all new civil cases became paperless. 

Advantages include: 

•   paperless judges’ order entries (over 250,000 were processed 

electronically in the first year);

•   paperless workflow queue for judges and court staff allow for 

expeditious processing of orders and filings (over 270,000 filings were 
processed electronically in a year);

33

Superior Court Operations Division

•   the computerization of short calendar preparation for 
civil and family cases, which allows judges to enter 
orders on civil short calendar motions on-screen; and

•   judges’ orders in most cases are available 

immediately on the e-services website upon entry 
into the electronic file.

v  In 2009, Court Service Centers assisted 126,938 self-

represented court patrons, 34,815 attorneys and 22,625 
others while personnel at the Public Information Desks 
assisted 142,339 self-represented court patrons, 20,098 
attorneys and 10,812 others. The courthouse greeter 
programs at the Milford, New Haven and Norwich 
Judicial District courthouses assisted over 5,000 
patrons in just seven months of operation.

v  Connecticut Legal Research and Courthouse 

Resources for New and Experienced Attorneys, a 
highly successful training program for attorneys and 
paralegals, was provided by the law libraries at six 
locations throughout the state and was attended by 
more than 200 people.

v  After two full years of operation, the Foreclosure 

Mediation Program has mediated 7,887 cases with 78 
percent (6,115) reaching settlement and 63 percent 
of the 7,887 of the participants reaching terms that 
allowed them to stay in their homes.

v  Efforts are under way to streamline the flow of 

business in clerks’ offices. These include: Practice 
Book revisions to small claims rules that changed the 
responsibility for service from the clerk’s office to the 
plaintiffs as well as enabling electronic filing of small 
claims; and the re-engineering of the clerks’ offices 
to improve efficiency by rethinking and redesigning 
business processes.

v  Support Enforcement Services increased collections 
on current child support to 58.3 percent and on child 
support arrears cases to 62.4 percent.

Stamford-Norwalk Judicial District Courthouse

v  In the fall of 2008, the Judicial Marshal Services 
began operating its Central Transportation Unit at 
121 Elm Street in New Haven. The unit provides 
transportation for 11 of the 13 judicial districts. Since 
the unit’s inception, transportation-related overtime 
has been reduced by 80 percent and costs associated 
with fuel consumption and staffing have been reduced 
significantly.

v  In July 2008, the Judicial Marshal Academy was 

awarded its second accreditation from the Commission 
of Accreditation for Law Enforcement (CALEA), a 
national organization that recognizes law enforcement 
agencies for professional excellence. The academy 
is the first organization in Connecticut to receive this 
recognition and one of 18 nationally recognized public 
safety academies.

Website Growth and Enhancements

case jurisdiction transfer, defendant failure to appear 
and case disposition. 

v  Videos and presentations have been posted on the 
website to help individuals navigate the state court 
system. Resources include: a presentation describing 
how to complete the appearance form in civil and 
family cases; the video entitled, Putting Children 
First: Minimizing Conflict in Custody Disputes 
(English and Spanish version); and a presentation 
describing what steps a defendant should take in a 
civil case. 

v  Spanish language translations of numerous brochures 

and web pages including small claims frequently asked 
questions, information on adult probation and victim 
services frequently asked questions are available on 
the website.

v  Family forms have been grouped by case types to 

assist self-represented parties. 

v  Mortgage foreclosure listings are now available.

v  Services available to the bar have been enhanced, such 
as providing attorneys with online access to request 
and receive last known address information from 
Department of Motor Vehicle records. Attorneys also 
have the option of paying their Client Security Fund 
fee via the website.

v  Short calendars are posted electronically on the 

Judicial Branch’s website providing attorneys with 
online access to these important documents. Because 
these documents are no longer mailed, the Judicial 
Branch is saving resources.

www.jud.ct.gov

The Judicial Branch’s website has been 
an essential vehicle in getting information 
out to the public and the bar. The primary 
advantages of using the website are 
that it allows the Branch to quickly and 
efficiently distribute free information 
to the public and the bar. Its success is 
reflected in the increase in the number 
of people who rely on the website for 
information. The numbers have increased 
from 4,444 visits per day in 2000 to 
more than 32,000 daily in 2010. Those 
accessing the Judicial Branch’s website 
use it in many different ways – from 
an individual paying an infraction to an 
attorney e-filing a document to a member 
of the public looking up the status of  
a case.

Highlights over the past two years include:

v  Individuals who have received a motor vehicle ticket 
or a criminal infractions ticket may now pay their fine 
online through the Judicial Branch’s website. This 
option became available in the fall of 2010 and was 
enthusiastically received. Within the first month and a 
half, several hundred individuals had paid their fines 
via the website.

v  CT SAVIN (Statewide Automated Victim Information 
and Notification) is now available online. This is 
an automated victim information and 
notification service that provides crime 
victims and other interested parties with 
automatic notice of relevant offender 
information and status reports as a case 
proceeds through the criminal justice 
system. Notification alerts include: 
upcoming court events, changing bail,

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
