PREFACE 

 

 

This is only a handbook. Although it contains information on appellate procedure 
and tips for both the novice and the seasoned appellate practitioner, it is not intended to 
be  a  comprehensive  treatise  or  a  substitute  for  the  Connecticut  Practice  Book.  The 
material  in  this  handbook  should  be  supplemented  by  your  own  careful  study  of  the 
rules  of  appellate  practice,  as  well  as  case  law  and  statutes.  The  rules  change 
frequently,  and,  therefore,  you  should  make  sure  you  are  consulting  the  most  recent 
version of the rules. 

This handbook is based on the rules effective as of September 1, 2018.

INTRODUCTION 
 

THE ROLE OF THE OFFICE OF THE APPELLATE CLERK 

 
The  Office  of  the  Appellate  Clerk  is  staffed  by  attorneys  and  paralegals  who 
review,  process  and  monitor  all  filings  submitted  to  the  Supreme  Court  and  the 
Appellate Court for consideration or ruling. 

 
The Office of the Appellate Clerk is the liaison between the public, the trial courts, 
the  bar,  self-represented  parties,  the  Supreme  Court  justices,  the  Appellate  Court 
judges, and court staff. 

 
The Office of the Appellate Clerk serves as a resource for information but  does 
not give legal advice. Anyone conducting business before either the Supreme Court or 
the Appellate Court is expected to have consulted the rules of appellate procedure that 
are  contained  in  the  Connecticut  Practice  Book  prior  to  contacting  the  Office  of  the 
Appellate  Clerk.  The  Practice  Book  is  available  on  the  Judicial  Branch  website 
(www.jud.ct.gov/Publications/PracticeBook/PB.pdf)  and  in  law  libraries  throughout  the 
state. 

 
Each  appellate  matter  is  managed  by  a  clerk/case  manager.  Appellate  matters 
are  reviewed  and  monitored  for  procedural  and  jurisdictional  compliance  under 
guidelines established by the courts, statutes, case law, and the rules of practice. 

Questions  may  be  directed  to  the  case  manager  assigned  to  a  particular 

 
appellate matter.

SECTION 1 
 
KNOWING WHAT IS APPEALABLE AND WHEN TO APPEAL 
 

Your  failure  to  file  a  timely  appeal  from  an  appealable  judgment  or  order  can 
 
result in the loss of your right to appellate review of that ruling. Carefully study the rules, 
statutes,  and  case  law  to  determine  whether  a  judgment  or  an  order  is  appealable, 
whether you have a right to appeal from it, and when your appeal must be filed. 

 

Is the Judgment Appealable and Are You Entitled To Appeal from It? 

 
Generally,  only  judgments  and  orders  issued  by  a  judge  of  the  Superior  Court 
can  be  appealed  to  the  Appellate  Court  or  the  Supreme  Court.  Decisions  issued  by 
state  agencies  and  by  the  Probate  Court  should  instead  be  challenged  by  taking  an 
appeal  to  the  Superior  Court.  In  workers'  compensation  cases,  on  the  other  hand, 
appeals  from  the  decisions  of  the  Compensation  Review  Board  are  taken  to  the 
Appellate Court. See Connecticut General Statutes (C.G.S.) ยง 31-301b. An appeal from 
a  decision  of  the  workers'  compensation  commissioner  on  a  complaint  that  alleges 
discriminatory discharge in violation of C.G.S. ยง 31-290a should also be taken directly to 
the Appellate Court. 

 
Not every order or decision issued by a Superior Court judge is appealable, and 
not  every  person  has  the  right  to  appeal  and  challenge  a  decision  that  they  disagree 
with. The "appeal statute," C.G.S. ยง 52-263, provides that you can appeal only if (1) you 
were a party to the Superior Court action, (2) you are aggrieved by the Superior Court's 
decision, and (3) the Superior Court's decision is a final judgment. You should therefore 
consider  the  following  questions  in  deciding  whether  the  Superior  Court's  judgment  or 
order can be appealed and, if so, whether you are a person who has a right to appeal 
from it: 

1.  Were  you  a  party  in  the  Superior  Court  case?  If  you  were  not  a  plaintiff  or  a 
defendant  in  the  Superior  Court  case  and  you  were  never  made  a  party  to  the 
Superior Court case, you cannot appeal from an order or judgment rendered in that 
case. Note, however, that a nonparty who is aggrieved by a Superior Court judgment 
or  order  that  binds  the  nonparty  can  seek  appellate  review  by  filing  a  writ  of  error. 
See Practice Book (P.B.) ยง 72-1. 

2.  Are  you  aggrieved  by  the  decision?  Only  someone  who  is  aggrieved  by  the 
Superior Court decision can appeal or bring a writ of error to challenge it. A person is 
aggrieved by a decision if that person has some specific, personal, and legal interest 
that  will  be  harmed  by  the  decision.  Generally,  the  party  that  "lost"  the  Superior 
Court case is aggrieved and entitled to appeal. But you also can be aggrieved by a 
judgment  that  is seemingly  in  your  favor if  the  judgment  awards  you  less  than  you 
asked for in the case.

3.  Is the decision a final judgment? An appeal or writ of error can be taken only from 
a  "final  judgment"  of  the  Superior  Court.  Usually,  the  final  judgment  is  the  ruling 
made  at  the  end  of  the  case  that  decides  who  won  and  resolves  all  the  parties' 
claims.  But  even  an  interlocutory  rulingโthat  is,  a  ruling  that  is  made  during  the 
course of the ongoing litigation before the Superior Court that does not conclude the 
caseโcan be an appealable final judgment. You should consult State v. Curcio, 191 
Conn. 27 (1983), for guidance in determining whether an interlocutory ruling is a final 
judgment that can be immediately appealed. 

 

Finally,  there  are  statutes  and  Practice  Book  provisions  that  permit  immediate 
appeals from  some orders or decisions  that are  not final judgments  in  that  they  do 
not necessarily end the case. These orders include, but are not limited to: 

a.  decisions concerning mechanic's liens, prejudgment remedies, and lis 

pendens. See C.G.S. ยงยง 49-35c, 52-278l and 52-325c. 

b.  temporary injunctions involving labor disputes. See C.G.S. ยง 31-118. 
c.  orders or decisions certified by the Chief Justice as being of substantial 
public interest and in which delay may work a substantial injustice. See 
C.G.S. ยง 52-265a. 

d.  orders  concerning  court  closure  and  sealing  or  limiting  disclosure  of 

court documents, affidavits, or files. See C.G.S. ยง 51-164x. 

e.  decisions of the Compensation Review Board. See C.G.S. ยง 31-301b. 
f.  certain  partial  judgments  that  do  not  dispose  of  the  entire  case.  See 

P.B. ยงยง 61-2 through 61-4. 

g.  most  Superior  Court  decisions  remanding  the  case  to  a  state  agency 
for  further  proceedings  under  the  Uniform  Administrative  Procedure 
Act. See C.G.S. ยง 4-183 (j). 

4.  Do you need permission to appeal? Generally, the answer is "no," but permission 

is required in order to appeal from some rulings. Those rulings include: 

a.  Superior  Court  decisions  on  appeals  from  local  zoning  and  inland 
wetlands  agencies,  which  require  the  granting  of  a  petition  for 
certification by the Appellate Court. See C.G.S. ยงยง 8-8 (o) and 22a-43 
(e); P.B. ยง 81-1. 

b.  Habeas  corpus  decisions,  from  which  either  the  petitioner  or  the 
respondent may appeal only with the permission of the judge who tried 
the habeas corpus case. See C.G.S. ยง 52-470 (g); P.B. ยง 80-1. 

c.  Denials  of  petitions  for  new  trials  in  criminal  cases,  which  are 
appealable  upon  the  granting  of  certification  by  the  trial  court.  See 
C.G.S. ยง 54-95. 

d.  Rulings that dispose of at least one cause of action while not disposing 
of  either  (1)  an  entire  complaint,  counterclaim,  or  cross  complaint,  or 
(2) all causes of action brought by or against a party. These rulings are 
immediately  appealable  only  if  the  trial  court  makes  a  written 
determination  that  an  immediate  appeal  is  justified  and  the  Chief 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5 

Justice or Chief Judge concurs with that determination. See P.B. ยง 61-
4. 

f  you  are  denied  permission,  or  certification,  to  appeal  from  the  rulings  listed  in 
paragraphs  (b)  or  (c)  above,  you  can  still  file  an  appeal,  but  you  must  argue  in  your 
appellate  brief  that  the  trial  court  abused  its  discretion  in  denying  you  permission  to 
appeal.

Should the Appellate Matter Be Filed in the 
Appellate Court or the Supreme Court? 

 
Most appellate matters should be filed in the Appellate Court. See C.G.S. ยง 51-
197a. The appellate matters that should be filed directly in the Supreme Court are listed 
in C.G.S. ยง 51-199 (b). A writ of error should be filed in the Supreme Court. See C.G.S. 
ยง  51-199  (b)  (10);  P.B.  ยง  72-1.  If  an  appellate  matter  is  filed  in  the  wrong  court,  the 
appellate clerk has the authority to transfer it to the proper court. See P.B. ยง 65-4. The 
Supreme  Court  also  may  transfer  an  appeal  that  was  properly  filed  in  the  Appellate 
Court to itself or transfer an appeal or writ of error that was properly filed in the Supreme 
Court to the Appellate Court. See C.G.S. ยง 51-199 (c); P.B. ยง 65-1. 
 

How Long Do You Have To File an Appeal? 

 
You should consult P.B. ยง 63-1 and the statutes to determine how long you have 
to file an appeal. In most (but not all) cases, you must file the appeal within 20 days of 
the date notice of the judgment or decision is issued by the trial judge or clerk. If notice 
of  the  judgment  or decision  is given  orally  by  the  trial judge  in  open  court,  the 20  day 
appeal period begins on that day. If notice is given only by mail or by electronic delivery, 
the appeal period begins on the day that notice of the decision was sent to counsel of 
record by the trial court clerk. See P.B. ยง 63-1 (b). In a civil jury case, the acceptance of 
the  verdict  constitutes  the  judgment  if  no  timely  motion  under P.B.  ยงยง 16-35,  16-37  or 
17-2A  is filed;  otherwise,  the  date  of  issuance  of  notice  of  the  last  ruling  on  any  such 
motion or motions begins the 20 day appeal period. Finally, note that the filing of some 
motions  in  the  trial  court  during  the  appeal  period  that  request  that  the  judgment  be 
opened or reconsidered can operate to create a new appeal period. See P.B. ยง 63-1 (c). 

When  there  is  more  than  one  plaintiff  or  defendant,  and  the  court  renders  a 
 
judgment  that  ends  the  case  as  to  one  plaintiff  or  defendant,  the  judgment  is  a  final 
judgment, and a party aggrieved by the judgment can file an immediate appealโeven 
though the case is not over as to the other parties. See P.B. ยง 61-3. If a party aggrieved 
by a P.B. ยง 61-3 final judgment wishes to wait until the end of the case to file an appeal, 
the party must file a notice of intent to defer the appeal in order to preserve the right to 
challenge the judgment later. See P.B. ยง 61-5. The notice of intent to appeal defers the 
taking  of  an  appeal  until  the  trial  court  renders  a  judgment  that  finally  disposes  of  the 
case  for  all  purposes  and  as  to  all  parties.  If,  however,  another  party  files  a  timely 
objection  to  the  notice  of  intent  to  defer  the  appeal,  the  party  who  filed  the  notice  of 

 

6 

intent to defer the appeal cannot wait to appeal and must instead file an appeal within 
20 days of the filing of the objection to the notice of intent to defer the appeal. 

 
A judgment that disposes of an entire complaint, counterclaim, or cross complaint 
is a final judgment even if the trial court has not yet ruled onโor disposed ofโanother 
complaint,  counterclaim,  or  cross  complaint  in  the  case.  See  P.B.  ยง  61-2.  A  party 
aggrieved  by  a  judgment  that  disposes  of  an  entire  complaint,  counterclaim,  or  cross 
complaint should therefore appeal within 20 days of notice of the judgment. 

 
The  trial  judge  can  grant  a  timely  motion  for  extension  of  the  time  to  take  an 
appeal  and  allow  up  to  an  additional  20  days,  unless  a  shorter  period  has  been 
prescribed by rule or by statute. See P.B. ยง 66-1 (a). If a motion for extension of time to 
file  an  appeal  is  filed  at  least  10  days  before  expiration  of  the  time  limit  sought  to  be 
extended, you will have no less than 10 days from the issuance of notice of the denial of 
the motion to file an appeal. If your motion is filed outside of the initial 10 day period and 
is denied by the trial court, you run the risk that your appeal may be deemed untimely. 

Not every case has a 20 day appeal period, and the law sets shorter time periods 
for  taking  an  appeal  or  seeking  certification  to  appeal  in  some  matters.  These  shorter 
time periods include: 

1.  72  hour  period  to  seek  review  of  orders  prohibiting  attendance  at  court  sessions 
and  orders  sealing  or  limiting  access  to  documents  on  file  with  the  court  under 
C.G.S. ยง 51-164x. See P.B. ยง 77-1. 

2.  5  day  period  to  appeal  from  summary  process  judgments  under  C.G.S.  ยง  47a-35 
(Sundays and legal holidays are excluded in calculating the 5 day appeal period). 

3.  7  day  period  to  appeal  from  orders  concerning  mechanic's  liens,  prejudgment 
remedies,  and  lis  pendens  under  C.G.S.  ยงยง  49-35c,  52-278l  and  52-325c, 
respectively. 

4.  10  day  period  to  seek  certification  to  appeal  from  habeas  corpus  decisions  under 

C.G.S. ยง 52-470 (g). 

5.  14 day period to seek permission from the Chief Justice to appeal under C.G.S. ยง 

52-265a from orders that involve matters of substantial public interest. 

6.  14  day  period  to  appeal  from  orders  regarding  temporary  injunctions  in  labor 

disputes under C.G.S. ยง 31-118. 

Is the Superior Court Judgment Stayed While the Appeal Is Pending? 

In most cases, the Superior Court's judgment is automatically stayed and cannot 
 
be enforced until the time to file an appeal from the judgment has expired. See P.B. ยง 

 

 

7 

61-11 (civil cases); P.B. ยง 61-13 (criminal cases). If an appeal is timely filed, the stay of 
execution ordinarily continues in effect until the final determination of the appeal. 

 
Not all judgments, however, are automatically stayed during the appeal period or 
during  the  time  that  the  appeal  is  pending  before  the  Appellate  Court  or the  Supreme 
Court.  P.B.  ยง  61-11  (b)  and  (c)  list  the  civil  matters  in  which  the  judgment  is  not 
automatically  stayed  during  the  appeal  period  or  while  an  appeal  is  pending.  For 
example, the automatic stay of execution does not apply to some orders issued in family 
cases,  such  as  those  concerning  periodic  alimony,  child  support  and  visitation,  or  to 
judgments  rendered  in  juvenile  cases.  Note  that  P.B.  ยง  61-11  (g)  and  (h)  set  forth 
different  stay  rules  for  appeals  taken  from  judgments  of  strict  foreclosure  and 
foreclosure  by  sale.  Finally,  there  are  statutes  that  require  some  judgments  to  be 
automatically  stayed  to  allow  time  to  appeal.  For  example,  C.G.S.  ยง  47a-35  provides 
that a summary process judgment is automatically stayed for 5 days from the date the 
judgment is rendered. 

 
If  an  automatic  stay  of  execution  of  the  judgment  is  in  effect,  a  party  can  file  a 
motion asking the trial judge to terminate the automatic stay. See P.B. ยง 61-11 (c), (d) 
and (e) (civil cases); P.B. ยง 61-13 (d) (criminal cases). If no stay of execution is in effect, 
a party can file a motion asking the trial judge to impose a stay. See P.B. ยง 61-12 (civil 
cases);  P.B. ยง  61-13  (d) (criminal cases).  A party  unhappy  with  a  trial court order that 
terminates or imposes a stay of execution of a judgment on appeal can seek appellate 
review of the order by filing a motion for review under P.B. ยงยง 61-14 and 66-6. 

Writ of Error 

Consult P.B. chapter 72 for the proper procedures for the signing, returning and 

 
filing of writs of error and to determine the application, if any, of an automatic stay.

THE MECHANICS OF FILING AN APPEAL, CROSS APPEAL, OR JOINT APPEAL 

SECTION 2 

 

 

 

Distinction between Appeals, Cross Appeals, and Joint Appeals 

An appeal may be brought only by a party who is legally harmed or "aggrieved" 
by the decision of the trial court. See Connecticut General Statutes (C.G.S.) ยง 52-263; 
Practice  Book  (P.B.)  ยง  61-1.  The  party  who  files  the  appeal  is  called  the  appellant, 
whereas all other parties who have not joined in the appeal are called appellees. Within 
10 days of the filing of the appeal by the appellant, an appellee who is also aggrieved by 
the  trial court's  decision  may  wish  to  challenge  the  decision by  filing  a  "cross  appeal." 
The procedure for filing a cross appeal is the same as for the filing of an appeal, except 
as noted below. See P.B. ยง 61-8. In the case of a joint appeal, any additional appellants 
to  the  appellant's  filing  the  appeal  shall  file  a  joint  appeal  consent  form  (JD-SC-035). 
See P.B. ยง 61-7 (a) (3). 

Appeal Form 

All appeals must be e-filed unless an exemption from e-filing has been granted. 
When you e-file an appeal, an appeal form is automatically generated by the computer 
and  filed  with  the  Office  of  the  Appellate  Clerk.  In  cases  in  which  an  exemption  has 
been  granted,  the  appeal form  (JD-SC-033),  which  is  available  on  the  Judicial Branch 
website (www.jud.ct.gov/webforms/), shall be filed with the Office of the Appellate Clerk 
in accordance with P.B. ยง 60-8. The appeal form must be filed with (1) a receipt showing 
that all required fees have been paid, or (2) a signed application for a waiver of fees and 
the order of the trial court granting the fee waiver for the appeal, or (3) certification that 
no fee is required. Failure to file one of these items with the appeal form will result in the 
rejection of your appeal. You may visit the Judicial Branch website (www.jud.ct.gov) for 
additional information, including the appellate e-filing instruction manual. 

Fees 

Fees  in  e-filed  cases  shall  be  paid  at  the  time  of  e-filing  as  specified  by  E-
Services. No fee is required for a cross appeal. In the case of a joint appeal, only one 
entry  fee  is  required,  which  is  paid  by  the  appellant  filing  the  appeal.  When  an 
exemption from electronic filing has been granted, all fees are paid to the trial court in 
accordance with P.B. ยง 60-8. An indigent party may apply for a waiver of appellate fees 
and an order that necessary expenses of bringing the appeal be paid by the state.  See 
P.B.  ยง  63-6  (civil);  P.B.  ยง  63-7  (criminal).  The  application  should  be  filed  with  the  trial 
court within the deadline for taking the appeal.

Other Documents 

All self-represented parties must have an account with E-Services and submit an 
appellate  access  form  (JD-AC-015),  unless  exempt  from  electronic  filing  pursuant  to 
P.B.  ยง  60-8.  In  addition,  the  following  appellate  documents  must  be  e-filed  unless  an 
exemption  has  been  granted.  Within  10  days  of  filing  the  appeal,  you  must  file  the 
following papers pursuant to P.B. ยง 63-4 (a): 

1.  A preliminary statement of the issues intended for presentation on appeal. 

2.  A transcript order form (JD-ES-038) properly completed by the court reporter with 
an estimated delivery date or a certificate stating that no transcript is necessary 
or a list of the specific date(s) of transcripts delivered prior to the filing of the appeal. 
You also must order an electronic version of the portions of the transcript deemed 
necessary for presentation of the appeal. See P.B. ยง 63-8 (a). 

3.  A docketing statement in accordance with P.B. ยง 63-4 (a) (3). 

4.  A preargument conference statement in most noncriminal cases. See P.B. ยง 63-

5.  A  constitutionality  notice.  This  document  is  required  only  in  any  noncriminal 
cases  in  which  you  are  challenging  the  constitutionality  of  a  state  statute.  The 
document should state (a) the statute being challenged, (b) the name and address 
of  the  party  bringing  the  challenge,  and  (c)  whether  the  trial  court  upheld  the 
constitutionality of the statute. 

6.  A sealing order notice identifying the date, time, scope, and duration of the sealing 
order and including a copy of the order. This notice is required in matters in which 
there  is  protected  information,  documents  are  under  seal,  or  disclosure  has  been 
limited. 

The appellee has 20 days to respond to these papers pursuant to P.B. ยง 63-4. 

Amendments  to  any  of  these  documents,  except  the  certificate  regarding 
transcript,  may  be  made  without  the  court's  permission  until  that  party's  brief  is  filed. 
See P.B. ยง 63-4 (b).

Case Manager 

After  you  have  filed  the  appeal,  you  will  receive  a  letter  from  the  Office  of  the 
Appellate Clerk with additional information, including the name of the case manager for 
the appeal. Case managers, as officers of the court, must remain neutral and therefore 
cannot provide legal advice for any case on appeal.

SECTION 3 
 
THE RECORD ON APPEAL 
 

It  is  the  appellant's  responsibility  (or,  in  the  case  of  a  cross  appeal,  the  cross 
appellant's  responsibility)  to  ensure  that  the  record  is  adequate  to  permit  appellate 
review  of  the  appellant's  claims  on  appeal.  See  Practice  Book  (P.B.)  ยง  61-10.  The 
record  includes  the  case  file,  any  decisions,  documents,  transcripts,  recordings  and 
exhibits  from  the  prior  proceedings,  and,  in  appeals  from  administrative  agencies,  the 
record  returned  to  the  trial  court  by  the  administrative  agency.  See  P.B.  ยง  60-4.  The 
failure  to  provide  an  adequate  record for review  could  result  in the  court's  declining  to 
review an issue or claim on appeal. See P.B. ยงยง 60-5 and 61-10. Perfecting the record 
for appeal involves a number of activities both before and after the filing of the appeal: 

1.  Transcript.  On  or  before  the  date  of  the  filing  of  the  appeal,  the  appellant  must 
order  (using  Form  JD-ES-038),  and  make  satisfactory  arrangements  for  the 
payment of, a transcript of the parts of the proceedings not already transcribed that 
are necessary for proper presentation and review of the appeal. See P.B. ยงยง 63-8, 
63-8A and 63-4 (a) (2). The appellant is required to order both the paper copy of the 
transcript  as  well  as  an  electronic  version.  Upon  receipt  of  the  certificate  of 
completion  from  the  official  reporter,  counsel  or  self-represented  parties  who 
ordered  the  transcript  must  file  a  certification  that  a  copy  of  the  certificate  of 
completion has been sent to all counsel and self-represented parties in accordance 
with P.B. ยงยง 62-7 and 63-8. Also, before or at the time of the filing of the appellant's 
brief,  the  appellant  must  file  with  the  Office  of  the  Appellate  Clerk  one  unmarked, 
nonreturnable  copy  of  the  paper  version  of  the  transcript,  including  the  reporter's 
certification page. See P.B. ยง 63-8 (e). The reporter files an electronic version of the 
transcript with the Office of the Appellate Clerk and delivers a copy to the ordering 
party. See P.B. ยง 63-8A. The failure to file a transcript could preclude review of any 
claim dependent on the transcript. The transcript is not served on other parties, who 
must  either  review  the  transcript  on  file  with  the  Office  of  the  Appellate  Clerk  or 
order their  own  copy  from  the  court reporter.  In a  criminal case,  the  court reporter 
will  provide  the  state  with  a  copy  of  all  transcripts  ordered  and  received  by  the 
defendant-appellant  if  the  appeal  is  being  handled  by  a  private  attorney  or  the 
defendant  is  self-represented.  If  the  criminal  appeal  is  being  handled  by  assigned 
counsel,  the  defendant,  through  counsel,  must  provide  the  state  with  a  copy  of  all 
transcripts ordered and received. 

2.  Motion  for  Rectification.  The  appellant  should  seek  to  correct  any  errors  or 
omissions in the trial record by filing a motion for rectification. See P.B. ยงยง 66-5 and 
66-2.  Unless  the  filing  period  is  extended  for  good  cause  shown,  a  motion  for 
rectification must be filed within 35 days after (a) delivery of the last portion of  the 
transcripts,  (b)  if  no  transcripts  were  ordered,  the  filing  of  the  appeal,  or  (c)  if  no 
memorandum  of  decision  was  filed  before  the  appeal  was  filed,  the  filing  of  the 
memorandum of decision.  If the court, on its own motion,  sets a different deadline 
for the filing of the appellant's brief, such as an extension pending assignment for a 
preargument  conference,  a  motion  for  rectification  must  be  filed  within  10  days  of 

 

11 

the deadline for filing the appellant's brief. See P.B. ยง 66-5. Except for good cause 
shown, no motion for rectification can be filed after the appellant's brief is filed. The 
filing  of  a  motion  for  rectification  does  not  delay  the  time  for  filing  the  appellant's 
brief, and, thus, a motion for extension of time may be necessary. See P.B. ยง 66-1. 
The Office of the Appellate Clerk will forward the motion for rectification to the trial 
judge who decided, or presided over, the subject matter of the rectification. The trial 
judge will file the decision on the motion with the Office of the Appellate Clerk. The 
trial court may hold a hearing to receive evidence, approve a stipulation of counsel, 
or hear arguments regarding a requested correction. Any party aggrieved by a trial 
court's  ruling  on  a  motion  for  rectification  may  file  a  motion  for  review  pursuant  to 
P.B. ยง 66-7, which is discussed in subsection 5 below. 

3.  Memorandum  of  Decision  or  Transcript  of  Oral  Decision.  It  is  also  the 
appellant's  responsibility  to  ensure  either  (a)  that  the  trial  court  files  a  written 
memorandum of decision, or (b) if the trial court's decision was oral, that a transcript 
of the portion of the proceedings in which the court stated its oral decision is signed 
by the trial judge and filed in the trial court clerk's office. See P.B. ยง 64-1. Filing a 
transcript of a decision that is not signed by the trial judge may not be sufficient to 
permit appellate review. If the trial judge fails to file a memorandum of decision or to 
sign a transcript of an oral decision, the appellant should file with the  Office of the 
Appellate Clerk under P.B. ยง 64-1 (b) a notice that the decision has not been filed, 
specifying  the  trial  judge  involved  and  the  date  of  the  decision  in  question.  The 
Office  of  the  Appellate  Clerk  will  forward  the  notice  to  the  trial  judge.  If  the  judge 
does not respond in a reasonable time, the appellant also may seek an order under 
P.B.  ยง  60-2  (1)  directing  the  trial  court  to  file  a  written  decision  or  to  sign  the 
transcript. 

4.  Motion  for  Articulation.  Whenever  the  trial  court's  decision  fails  to  address  an 
issue that was raised in the trial court and will be raised on appeal, or is unclear or 
incomplete  in  setting  forth  the  factual  or  legal  basis  of  its  decision,  it  is  the 
appellant's responsibility to file a motion for articulation pursuant to P.B. ยง 66-5. The 
motion  for  articulation  (which  seeks  further  explanation  regarding  the  basis  for  an 
existing decision) should not be confused with the notice, discussed above, that is 
filed  pursuant  to  P.B.  ยง  64-1  (b)  when  the  trial  court  has  failed  to  file  any 
memorandum  of  decision  or  to  sign  a  transcript  of  the  court's  ruling.  The  time 
periods for filing a motion for articulation are the same as those governing motions 
for rectification. Filing a motion for articulation does not delay the deadline for filing 
the appellant's brief, and, thus, a motion for extension of time to file a brief may be 
necessary.  See  P.B.  ยง  66-1.  The  Office  of  the  Appellate  Clerk  will  forward  the 
motion for articulation to the trial judge. Within 20 days of a judge's articulation, any 
party may move for further articulation. See P.B. ยง 66-5. 

5.  Motion  for  Review.  If  any  party  is  aggrieved  by  the  action  of  the  trial  judge  on  a 
motion for articulation or rectification, that party should seek appellate review of that 
decision by filing with the Office of the Appellate Clerk a motion for review pursuant 
to P.B. ยง 66-7 within 10 days of notice of the trial judge's action. See P.B. ยง 66-6. 
The failure to file a motion for review may result in an appellate court's declining to 

 

12 

review an issue or claim on appeal, even if a motion for articulation or rectification 
was filed. If the motion for review depends on a transcript, the party filing the motion 
should  order  and  file  the  transcript  that  supports  the  motion  for  review.  If  the 
transcript  has  not  been  delivered  to  that  party  prior  to  the  filing  of  the  motion  for 
review,  the  transcript  order form  should be filed  with  the  motion. The failure  to file 
the transcript when the motion for review depends on  the transcript could result in 
the denial of review of the motion. 

6.  Filing  Local  Land  Use  Regulations.  In  appeals  certified  by  the  Appellate  Court 
pursuant to P.B. ยง 81-1 et seq., one complete copy of the local land use regulations 
in  effect  at  the  time  of  the  hearing  that  gave  rise  to  the  agency  action  or  ruling  in 
dispute must be filed with the Office of the Appellate Clerk when the appellant's brief 
is filed. The copy filed must be certified by the local zoning official as having been in 
effect at the time of the hearing. See P.B. ยง 81-6. 

 

 

13 

SECTION 4 
 
PREARGUMENT CONFERENCES 
 

Preargument conferences are held pursuant to Practice Book (P.B.) ยง 63-10 and 
 
are  convened  primarily  to  explore  the possibility  that  the  case  can  be  settled,  and  this 
mediation process has resulted in the settlement and withdrawal of many appeals. The 
deadline  for  the  appellant's  brief  will  usually  be  extended  until  after  the  preargument 
conference  so  that  the  parties  can  discuss  settlement  before  they  have  incurred  the 
expense of preparing and filing their appellate briefs. The judge assigned to conduct the 
preargument conference may point out to the attendees, parties, and attorneys, in joint 
conference and in private discussions, the strengths and weaknesses of each side. The 
judge  also  may  wish  to  discuss  the  possibility  of  reducing  the  number  of  issues 
presented  on  appeal  or  a  timetable  for  the  filing  of  the  appellate  briefs.  Finally,  the 
preargument  conference  judge  may  recommend  that  the  case  be  transferred  from  the 
Appellate Court to the Supreme Court. 

 
In  all  noncriminal  cases,  except  for  those  noncriminal  cases  that  are  expressly 
exempt  from  a  preargument  conference  under  P.B.  ยง  63-10,  the  appellant  must  file  a 
preargument  conference  statement  within  10  days  of  filing  the  appeal.  A  party  in  an 
exempt case nonetheless may request a preargument conference by filing a request for 
a  conference  with  the  Office  of  the  Appellate  Clerk,  certified  to  all  parties,  explaining 
why the case should not be exempt. 

 
Once  you  have  been  informed  that  a  preargument  conference  judge  has  been 
assigned  to  your  case,  any  questions  or  requests  regarding  the  preargument 
conference should be addressed to that judge. 

 
Parties  are  required  to  attend  the  preargument  conference  unless  they  are 
excused  from  attendance  by  the  preargument  conference  judge.  If  a  party  against 
whom  a  claim  is  made  is  insured,  the  insurer  must  be  available  by  telephone  or  cell 
phone, although the judge may require the adjuster to be present at the conference. If a 
party  or  an  attorney  who  has  not  been  excused  from  attending  the  preargument 
conference fails to attend, sanctions may be imposed under P.B. ยง 85-2 (7). 

 
The  preargument  conference  proceedings  are  confidential,  and  nothing 
discussed in the proceedings should be brought to the attention of the Supreme Court 
or  the  Appellate  Court,  or  mentioned  or  included  by  any  party  in  his  or  her  appellate 
brief or appendix.

SECTION 5 

MOTION PRACTICE 

Unless  you  are  exempt from  electronic filing  pursuant  to  Practice  Book  (P.B.) ยง 
60-8, all motions and oppositions to motions must be electronically filed pursuant to P.B. 
ยง  60-7  and  shall  comply  with  the  requirements  of  P.B.  ยงยง  66-2,  66-3  and  62-7.  Thus, 
motions must be: 

typewritten and fully double spaced 

๏ท 
๏ท  12 point or larger size in Arial or Univers typeface 
๏ท  no more than 3 lines to the vertical inch or 27 lines to the page 
๏ท 

in compliance with the margin and footnote requirements of P.B. ยง 
66-3 

If  you  received  an exemption from  electronic  filing  pursuant to  P.B.  ยง  60-8,  you 

need to file only an original paper motion or opposition.  

All  motions  and  oppositions,  whether  filed  electronically  or  by  paper,  must 
contain  a  certification that  a  copy  has  been delivered  to  each other counsel of  record, 
including  names,  addresses,  e-mail  addresses,  and  telephone  numbers.  For  paper 
filings,  the  certification  also  shall  include  a  statement  that  the  document  has  been 
redacted or does not contain any names or other personal identifying information that is 
prohibited  from  disclosure  by  rule,  statute,  court  order,  or  case  law,  and  that  the 
document  complies  with  all  applicable  rules  of  appellate  procedure.  For  electronically 
filed  documents,  the  certification  requirements  for  redaction  and  personal  identifying 
information can be completed as part of the electronic filing transaction. See P.B. ยง 62-7 
(b). 

In accordance with P.B. ยง 66-2, every motion, including motions for extension of 

time, must contain in separate, appropriately captioned paragraphs: 

๏ท  a brief history of the case 
๏ท  specific facts relied on by the party filing the motion 
legal grounds relied on by the party filing the motion 
๏ท 

There is a 10 page limit for all motions or oppositions, including any memoranda 
in  support  of  or  in  opposition  to  a  motion.  See  P.B.  ยง  66-2  (b).  Attachments  to  the 
motion or opposition, such as transcripts or documents, are not included in the 10 page 
limit.  Whenever  a  motion  is  filed  with  the  Office  of  the  Appellate  Clerk,  it  is  initially 
examined  for  compliance  with  P.B.  ยงยง  66-2  and  66-3.  Noncomplying  motions  may  be 
returned. See P.B. ยง 62-7 (a). Although the returned document remains in the electronic 
filings for that appeal, it will not be considered by the court, and a return notice will be 
issued by the Office of the Appellate Clerk. Any papers correcting a noncomplying filing 
should  be  resubmitted  to  the  Office  of  the  Appellate  Clerk  within  15  days.  If  the  initial 
paper was timely filed but was returned and refiled within 15 days, the correcting paper 
will be deemed timely filed under the provisions of P.B. ยง 62-7 (a). P.B. ยง 62-7 applies 

 

15 

unless otherwise ordered by the court having appellate jurisdiction. The time to file an 
opposition will not start to run until the correcting paper is filed. 

Some motions may lead to the disposition of an appeal or writ of error. Generally, 
the appellee must file a motion to dismiss based on a nonjurisdictional defect within 10 
days  after  the  filing  of  the  appeal  or  within  10  days  after  the  alleged  defect  arose.  A 
motion to dismiss a writ of error based on nonjurisdictional grounds generally must be 
filed  within  10  days  after  the  electronic  filing  of  the  writ  or,  if  the  plaintiff  in  error  is 
exempt  from  the  electronic  filing  requirements,  within  10  days  after  the  return  day.  A 
motion to dismiss based on lack of jurisdiction, however, may be filed at any time. See 
P.B.  ยง  66-8.  Examples  of  jurisdictional  problems  that  can  result  in  dismissal  of  an 
appeal include lack of aggrievement, mootness, and lack of a final judgment. Examples 
of  nonjurisdictional  grounds  for  dismissal  of  an  appeal  include  the  failure  to  timely  file 
required documents or to file a timely appeal. Motions for sanctions may be filed at any 
time. See P.B. ยง 85-3. No motion or opposition shall be filed after the expiration of the 
time  for  its  filing  unless  there  is  good  cause  for  the  late  filing  and  the  motion  or 
opposition contains a separate section captioned "good cause for late filing," explaining 
the  reasons  for  the  delay.  No  amendment  can  be  made  to  any  filing  unless  a  written 
motion seeking to amend the filing is granted by the court having appellate jurisdiction. 
See P.B. ยง 66-3. 

A  motion  for  review  pursuant  to  P.B.  ยง  66-6  allows  the  Appellate  Court  or  the 
Supreme  Court  to  review  actions  of  the  trial  court  during  the  pendency  of  the  appeal 
involving  questions  that  may  arise  in  connection  with  the  preparation  of  the  appeal.  A 
motion for review is appropriate when a party seeks to modify or vacate any order of the 
trial  court  relating  to  the  perfecting  of  the  record  for  appeal  or  the  procedure  for 
prosecuting  or  defending  the  appeal.  A  motion  for  review  is  also  appropriate  to  seek 
review of the action of the appellate clerk or the trial court on a motion to extend time. 
See P.B. ยง 66-1. In addition, a party may move for review of an adverse ruling on either 
a motion for stay of execution or a motion to terminate an automatic stay. See P.B. ยงยง 
61-11, 61-12 and 66-6. A party has 10 days from the date of issuance of notice of any 
order to file a motion for review. See P.B. ยง 66-6. 

Pursuant  to  P.B.  ยง  60-2,  any  trial  court  order  relating  to  the  prosecution  of  an 
appeal may be modified or vacated. This rule also permits the filing of a motion to strike 
improper  matter  from  a  brief  or  an  appendix,  and  a  motion  to  stay  any  proceedings 
ancillary to a case on appeal. The Supreme Court or the Appellate Court may order that 
a party, for good cause shown, may file a late appeal, petition for certification, brief or 
other document, unless the court lacks jurisdiction to allow a late filing. The court having 
appellate  jurisdiction  also  may  order  that  a  hearing  be  held  to  determine  whether  that 
court has jurisdiction over a pending matter, order an appellate matter to be dismissed 
unless the  appellant  complies  with  specific orders of  the trial court  or the  court  having 
appellate  jurisdiction,  or  remand  any  pending  matter  to  the  trial  court  for  resolution  of 
factual issues if necessary. 

 
An  opposition  can  be  filed  to  any  motion,  other  than  a  motion  for  extension  of 
time,  within  10  days  of  the  filing  of  the  motion.  An  opposition  shall  not  include  any 

 

16 

request for relief other than the denial of the motion. A request for other relief should be 
presented in a separate motion, for example, a motion to file a late appeal or a motion 
for  sanctions.  Responses  to  oppositions  are  not  permitted  and  will  be  returned  by  the 
Office of the Appellate Clerk. See P.B. ยง 66-2 (a). 

 
Some motions that are directed to the trial court, such as  a motion to terminate 
an  automatic  stay  pursuant to  P.B.  ยง 61-11,  or  a  motion for rectification or articulation 
pursuant to P.B. ยง 66-5, are filed with the Office of the Appellate Clerk. These trial court 
motions must comply with the requirements of P.B. ยง 66-2 (e). 

 
If you wish to file a late motion that is directed to the trial court, you must first file 
with the court having appellate jurisdiction a written motion for permission to file the late 
motion  and  include  a  copy  of  the  proposed  trial  court  motion.  If  the  court  having 
appellate  jurisdiction  grants  permission  to  file  the  late  motion,  the  motion  can  be  filed 
and forwarded to the trial court for consideration. P.B. ยง 66-3. 

 
Motions  filed  with  the  Office  of  the  Appellate  Clerk  that  are  directed  to  the  trial 
court  and  any  oppositions  will  be  forwarded  to  the  trial  court  by  the  Office  of  the 
Appellate  Clerk.  When  the  trial  court  has  decided  these  motions,  the  Office  of  the 
Appellate Clerk shall issue notice of the decision. A motion for review can be filed within 
10 days of issuance of notice of the decision. See P.B. ยงยง 66-2 (f) and 66-7.

SECTION 6 
 
MOTIONS FOR EXTENSION OF TIME 

 

 

Motions  for  extension  of  time  to  file  a  brief  or  other  document  are  governed  by 
Practice  Book  (P.B.)  ยง  66-1.  Like  all  other  motions,  they  must  be  electronically  filed 
pursuant to P.B. ยง 60-7 and comply with P.B. ยงยง 62-7, 66-2 and 66-3. Pursuant to P.B. 
ยง 66-1, motions for extension of time must also include: 

the reason for the requested extension 

๏ท 
๏ท  certification  to  counsel,  self-represented  parties,  and  the  movant's 

client 

the current status of the brief 
the estimated date of completion of the brief 

๏ท  a statement indicating whether other parties consent or object 
๏ท 
๏ท 
๏ท  whether the client is incarcerated (criminal cases only) 
๏ท  a claim of good cause. See P.B. ยง 66-1 (c). 

Only  an  original  of  the  motion  must  be  filed  if  you  received  an  exemption  from 
electronic  filing.  See  P.B.  ยง  60-8.  Unlike  other  motions,  an  objection  to  a  motion  for 
extension of time must be filed within 5 days. See P.B. ยง 66-1 (d). 

The Good Cause Requirement 

Good cause must be shown for a motion for extension of time to be granted. The 
appellate clerk is authorized to grant motions for extension of time pursuant to P.B ยง 66-
1  (c).  If  the  reason  for  the  requested  extension  is  that  counsel  is  working  on  other 
appeals, be specific, listing the dates when briefs are due in other cases. Whether your 
reason  relates  to  the  inherent  nature  of  the  appeal,  such  as  a  lengthy  transcript, 
complex  issues  or  pending  settlement  negotiations,  or  relates  to  other  matters,  be 
forthright. Other pending motions, unrelated to the filing of a brief, do not automatically 
delay the time to file the brief, although such other pending motions may furnish a  basis 
for granting an extension of time to file the brief. 

 

 

When To File 

A motion for extension of time must be filed no later than 10 days before the brief 
or document is due, unless the reason for the request for an extension arose during that 
10 day period. If the motion for extension is filed after the due date, the appellate clerk 
is  required  to  deny  the  motion.  See  P.B.  ยง  66-1  (e).  If  the  due  date  has  passed  or  a 
motion for extension has been denied, a motion for permission to file late may be filed. 
Extensions cannot be granted over the telephone.

Final Extension 

If there is a specific court order or a final extension order for the filing of a brief or 
other  document,  you  must  comply  with  the  order.  The  Office  of  the  Appellate  Clerk 
cannot  accept  a  late  brief  or  other  document  unless  the  court  grants  a  motion  for 
permission to amend or set aside the court order. 

Notice of Decision on Motions for Extension of Time 

The  official  notice  for  orders  on  motions  for  extension  of  time  issued  by  the 
 
Supreme  Court  and  the  Appellate  Court  is  the  electronic  posting  of  the  order  to  the 
appellate file through the appellate e-filing system. Paper notice will issue in all appeals 
when the litigant is exempt from electronic filing. Counsel of record and the public can 
view  the  disposition  of  the  motion  for  extension  and  the  date  of  the  extension  in  the  
Case  Activity  section  of  the  electronic  file  available  on  the  Judicial  Branch  website 
(www.jud.ct.gov).  In  the  event  an  order  on  a  motion  for  extension  of  time  contains 
additional text  that  cannot  be  seen  in  the  Case  Activity  section,  or case  information  is 
not electronically available, paper notice will issue. 

 

 

Extensions of Time in Which To File an Appeal 

Pursuant to P.B. ยง 66-1, a motion for extension of time to file an appeal must be 
filed in the trial court where the case was heard. A motion for extension of time to file an 
appeal should be filed at least 10 days before expiration of the time limit sought to be 
extended so that, if the motion is denied, the party seeking to appeal will have no less 
than 10 days from the issuance of notice of the denial to appeal. See P.B. ยงยง 63-1 (a) 
and 66-1 (a).

SECTION 8 

BRIEFS AND APPENDICES 

The  timing,  format,  and  content  of  briefs  and  appendices  are  governed  by 
chapter 67 of the Practice Book (P.B.). Briefs and appendices that do not substantially 
comply with the rules may be returned or rejected by the Office of the Appellate Clerk. 
See P.B. ยง 62-7. Moreover, the court may decline to review issues that are not properly 
briefed.  Different  rules  apply  to  the  filing  of  briefs  and  appendices  in  child  protection 
matters. See P.B. ยงยง 79a-1 through 79a-15.  

Timing 

1.  The  Appellant's  Brief.  The  appellant's  brief  and  appendix  must  be  filed  within  45 
days  of the delivery  date  of  any  transcript  ordered  by  the appellant.  See  P.B.  ยงยง  67-3 
and 63-8 (c). The "delivery date" of the transcript is the date on which the final portion of 
the transcript ordered by the appellant is sent to the appellant by the court reporter. See 
P.B.  ยง  63-8  (c).  If  the  appellant  has  not  ordered  any  transcript,  or  if  the  transcript  on 
which  the  appellant  intends  to  rely  was  obtained  prior  to  the  filing  of  the  appeal,  the 
appellant's  brief  and  appendix  must  be  filed  within  45  days  of  the  filing  of  the  appeal. 
See P.B. ยง 67-3. 

2. The Appellee's Brief. The appellee's brief and any appendix must be filed within 30 
days after the filing of the appellant's brief. See P.B. ยง 67-3. If the appellee has ordered 
any  transcript  in  addition  to  that ordered  by  the  appellant;  see  P.B.  ยง  63-4  (a) (2); the 
appellee's brief and any appendix must be filed within 30 days after the delivery date of 
the transcript ordered by the appellee. See P.B. ยง 67-3. 

3. The Reply Brief. The reply brief, if any, must be filed by the appellant within 20 days 
after the filing  of  the appellee's brief. See P.B.  ยง  67-3.  In  the  reply  brief,  the  appellant 
may respond only to the appellee's argument and may not raise new claims or issues. 

4.  Cross  Appeals.  When  a  cross  appeal  has  been  filed,  the  appellee's  brief  and 
appendix is combined with the brief and appendix as cross appellant and is filed within 
the  time  provided  for  the  filing  of  the  appellee's  brief.  The  reply  brief,  if  any,  of  the 
appellant is combined with the brief and appendix as cross appellee and must be filed 
within 30 days after the filing of the brief of the appellee/cross appellant. The reply brief, 
if any, of the cross appellant must be filed within 20 days after the filing of the brief of 
the cross appellee. See P.B. ยง 67-3. 

 

Format 

The  Practice  Book  contains  precise  requirements  concerning  margins,  spacing, 
fonts, page numbers, binding and covers. See P.B. ยง 67-2. Strict compliance with these 
requirements is essential. 

 

21 

Supreme  Court  cases  require  15  copies  of  the  brief  and  appendix  to  be  filed. 
Appellate Court cases require 10 copies. P.B. ยง 67-2 (h). Unless otherwise ordered, the 
brief shall be copied on one side of the page only.  Appendices may be copied on both 
sides of the page. P.B. ยง 67-2 (a). 

The page limitations for briefs may be found in P.B. ยง 67-3. For purposes of the 
page  limitations,  you  must  count  everything  other  than  the  (1)  appendices,  (2) 
preliminary  statement  of  issues,  (3)  table  of  contents,  (4)  table  of  authorities,  (5) 
statement  of  the  interest  of  the  amicus  curiae  in  an  amicus  curiae  brief,  and  (6)  last 
page of the brief, but only if it contains nothing more than the signature of counsel or the 
signature of the self-represented party. The Chief Justice or the Chief Judge may grant 
permission  to  exceed  the  page  limitations.  Requests  to  exceed  the  page  limitations, 
which  should  be  made  sparingly,  should  be  made  by  letter  filed  with  Office  of  the 
Appellate Clerk. The request should include both a compelling reason and the number 
of  additional  pages  sought.  It  is  helpful  if  you  include  your  preliminary  statement  of 
issues.  If  you  are  briefing  a  claim  based  on  the  state  constitution  as  an  independent 
ground for relief, the appellate clerk will, upon request, grant an additional 5 pages  for 
briefs, plus an additional 2 pages for the appellant's reply brief. These additional pages 
are to be used only for the state constitutional argument. 

 

Content 

The brief should be as concise and as readable as possible. Use plain English in 
your brief. The appellant and the appellee should be referred to as either the  "plaintiff" 
or  the  "defendant,"  as  appropriate,  or  by  name.  See  P.B.  ยง  67-1.  The  appellant  must 
describe  what  happened  in  the  trial  court  and  why  the  judgment  should  be  reversed. 
The  appellee  should  try  to  persuade  the  reviewing  court  either  that  the  trial  court  did 
nothing  wrong  or  that  any  errors  that  might  have  occurred  do  not  merit  reversing  the 
judgment, or both. 

 

Electronic Briefing Requirements 

In  addition  to  the  requirement  that  you  file  paper  briefs,  you  are  required  to 
submit  electronic  versions  of  briefs  and  appendices,  unless  you  are  exempt  from  the 
electronic filing requirements. Even when the paper copies of the brief and appendix are 
bound  together,  the  brief  and  appendix  must  be  submitted  as  separate  documents 
electronically.  P.B.  ยง  67-2  (g).  A  copy  of  the  electronic  confirmation  receipt  indicating 
that the brief and appendix were submitted electronically must be filed with the original 
paper brief and appendix. See P.B. ยง 67-2 (j). 

 

 

22 

The Appellant's Brief 

The  appellant's  brief  must  contain  a  statement  of  the  issues  involved  in  the 
appeal, a table of authorities, a statement of the nature of the proceedings and the facts 
of  the  case,  and  an  argument  section.  See  P.B.  ยง  67-4  (a)  through  (d).  The  text  of 
pertinent portions of any constitutional provisions, statutes, ordinances or regulations on 
which  the  appellant  relies  must  be  included  either  in  the  brief  or  in  the  appendix.  See 
P.B.  ยง  67-4  (f).  Also  include  the  text  of  any  rules  of  practice  that  are  at  issue.  The 
appellant's brief should be organized in the following order: 

1.  Table of Contents. The table of contents should outline the various sections of the 
brief  (including  the  major  headings  from  the  argument  section),  along  with  a  page 
number for each section or heading. 

2.  Statement of Issues. The statement of issues must be included in the appellant's 
brief. See P.B. ยง 67-4 (a). The issues stated must be concise and must be set forth 
in  separately  numbered  paragraphs,  without  detail  or  discussion.  The  statement 
should  include  references  to  the  pages  of  the  brief  on  which  each  issue  is 
discussed. See P.B. ยง 67-4 (a). The statement of issues should not exceed 1 page 
and should be on a page by itself. See P.B. ยง 67-1. The statement of issues will be 
deemed  to  replace  and  supersede  the  appellant's  preliminary  statement  of  issues. 
See P.B. ยง 67-4 (a). 

3.  Table of Authorities. The table of authorities should include all authorities cited in 
the brief, as well as the page numbers of the brief on which those citations appear. 
See  P.B.  ยง  67-4  (b).  The  rules  provide  for  different  citation  protocols  for  judicial 
decisions, depending on whether the citation to the decision is located in the brief or 
in the table of authorities. See P.B. ยง 67-11. 

4.  Statement Regarding Land Use Regulations. In zoning and wetland appeals filed 
pursuant to P.B. ยง 81-4, you must include a statement identifying the version of the 
land use regulations filed with the Office of the Appellate Clerk. See P.B. ยง 67-4 (g). 

5.  Statement of the Nature of the Proceedings and of the Facts. The rules provide 
that  the  statement  of  the  nature  of  the  proceedings  and  of  the  facts  should  have 
some  "bearing  on  the  issues  raised."  P.B.  ยง  67-4  (c).  For  example,  it  is  not 
necessary to set forth every procedural event or every piece of evidence presented 
at  trial,  if  the  issue  on  appeal  is  whether  the  trial  court  should  have  stricken  the 
complaint because it failed to state a cause of action. On the other hand, if the issue 
on appeal is whether the verdict was contrary to the evidence, then the statement of 
the facts would necessarily require a detailed description of the evidence presented 
at  trial.  The  statement  of  the  facts  shall  be  in  narrative  form,  shall  not  be 
"unnecessarily  detailed  or voluminous,"  and  shall  include  citations  to  the transcript 
pages or documents on which you rely. P.B. ยง 67-4 (c). 

6.  Argument. The argument section should be divided into appropriate sections (with 
headings), corresponding to the issues and subissues presented in the appeal. See 

 

23 

P.B. ยง 67-4 (d). 

At  or  near  the  beginning  of  the  argument  for  each  issue,  you  must  include  a 
separate,  brief  statement  of  the  standard  of  review  that  you  believe  the  reviewing 
court should apply. See P.B. ยง 67-4 (d). The statement of the standard of review is 
an  opportunity  to  inform  the  justices  or  judges  considering  the  appeal  how  you 
believe  they  should  review  the  actions  of  the  court below.  For  example,  if  the  trial 
court  decided  an  issue  as  a  matter  of  law  (e.g.,  construed  a  statute  or  granted  a 
motion  for  summary  judgment),  such  decisions  are  generally  reviewed  anew  on 
appeal  ("de  novo"  or  "plenary"  standard  of  review).  On  the  other  hand,  issues 
related to the management of a trial (e.g., scheduling, evidentiary rulings, etc.) are 
generally reviewed on appeal only to the extent necessary to determine whether the 
trial  court  abused  the  wide  discretion  allocated  to  it  in  such  matters  ("abuse  of 
discretion"  standard  of  review).  Factual  findings  made  by  the  trial  court  are 
generally reviewed to determine whether there is evidence in the record to support 
those  findings  ("clearly  erroneous"  standard  of  review).  Note  that  these  three 
examples  do  not  purport  to  cover  the  field  of  "standards  of  review."  It  is  very 
important that you understand the nature of the review to which you are entitled on 
appeal and that you inform the court what you believe that standard should be. 

The  appellant  also  must  demonstrate  to  the  reviewing  court  that  the  issues 
presented on appeal were properly raised in the trial court. Depending on the issue 
raised on appeal, the appellant is required to include certain, pertinent information in 
either the brief or the appendix. See P.B. ยง 67-4 (d) (1) through (5). If the appellant 
does  not  comply  with  these  requirements,  the  court  may  decline  to  review  the 
issues raised on appeal. 

7.  Conclusion  and  Statement  of  Relief  Requested.  A  short  conclusion  should  be 
included  in  the  appellant's  brief,  identifying  exactly  what  action  you  believe  should 
be taken in the event the court resolves the appeal in  your favor. See P.B. ยง 67-4 
(e). 

8.  Signature  and  Certification  of  Delivery.  The  brief  must  be  signed  by  counsel  of 
record,  which  includes  self-represented  parties.  It  should  include  the  signer's 
telephone number, mailing address, and, if applicable, the signer's juris number or 
self-represented  party's  user  identification  number.  See  P.B.  ยง  62-6.  In  your 
certification that a copy has been delivered to each other counsel of record, include 
the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all counsel and self-represented 
parties. See P.B. ยง 62-7 (b) (1). 

9.  Certification  Requirements  for  Electronically  Submitted  Briefs.  Counsel  and 
self-represented  parties  must  certify  that  electronically  submitted  briefs  and 
appendices (1) have been delivered electronically to the last known e-mail address 
of each counsel of record for whom an e-mail address has been provided, and (2) 
have  been  redacted  or  do  not  contain  any  names  or  other  personal  identifying 
information  that  is  prohibited  from  disclosure  by  rule,  statute,  court  order  or  case 
law. See P.B. ยง 67-2 (g). 

 

24 

10. Certification  Requirements  for  Copies  of  Briefs.  The  copies  of  the  brief  filed 
must be accompanied by (1) certification that a copy of the brief and appendix has 
been  sent  to  each  counsel  or  self-represented  party  of  record,  in  compliance  with 
P.B. ยง 62-7, (2) certification by counsel of record that the brief and appendix being 
filed with the Office of the Appellate Clerk are true copies of the brief and appendix 
that  were  submitted  electronically  pursuant  to  P.B.  ยง  67-2  (g),  (3)  certification  that 
the  brief  and  appendix  have  been  redacted  or  do  not  contain  any  names  or  other 
personal  identifying  information  that  is  prohibited  from  disclosure  by  rule,  statute, 
court  order  or  case  law,  and  (4)  certification  that  the  brief  complies  with  all 
provisions of P.B. ยง 67-2. 

11. Electronic Confirmation Receipt. Counsel and self-represented parties must file a 
copy  of  the  electronic  confirmation  receipt  indicating  that  the  brief  and  appendix 
were submitted electronically with the original brief. See P.B. ยง 62-7 (j). 

The Appellant's Appendix 

The  appellant  must  file  an  appendix  with  the  appellant's  brief.  Extensive 
requirements  are  stated  in  P.B.  ยง  67-8.  The  appendix  is  to  be  divided  into  two  parts. 
Part one is mandatory and must include (1) a table of contents, (2) the docket sheets, a 
case  detail  or  court  action  entries  in  the  proceedings  below,  (3)  relevant  motions, 
findings and opinions of the court below, (4) the signed judgment file, if applicable, (5) 
the  appeal  form,  (6)  the  docketing  statement,  (7)  any  relevant  appellate  motions  or 
orders completing or perfecting the record, and (8) other documents listed in P.B. ยง 67-8 
(b). A list of suggested documents for inclusion in part one is provided in the appendix 
to this handbook. In criminal appeals filed by incarcerated, self-represented parties, part 
one of the appendix shall be prepared by the opposing party. See P.B. ยง 68-1. 

Part  two  may  include  other  portions  of  the  record  that  the  appellant  deems 
necessary for the presentation of the appeal. It may include excerpts of lengthy exhibits 
or quotations from  transcripts,  or items  to  comply  with  other  provisions  of  the Practice 
Book that require inclusion of materials in the appendix. Decisions cited by a party that 
are not officially published must be included in part two of the appendix. See P.B. ยง 67-8 
(b) (2). The entire trial court file will be available to the Supreme Court and the Appellate 
Court. 

The Appellee's Brief 

In  general,  the  appellee's  brief  mirrors  that  of  the  appellant  as  to  content  and 
organization.  The  appellee's  brief  must  respond  to  the  points  made  and  the  issues 
raised  in  the  appellant's  brief.  The  rules  allow  the  appellee  to  dispense  with  certain 
items  that  are  required  in  the  appellant's  brief  as  appropriate.  For  example,  the 
appellee's  counter  statement  of  issues  need  only  address  those  issues  raised  by  the 
appellant  with  which  the  appellee  disagrees,  along  with  any  issues  properly  raised  by 

 

 

 

25 

the appellee under P.B. ยง 63-4 (i.e., alternative grounds on which the judgment may be 
affirmed or adverse rulings that should be considered if a new trial is ordered). See P.B. 
ยง 67-5 (a). 

Similarly, the appellee is not required to submit a statement of the nature of  the 
proceedings and is required to include a counter statement only as to those facts as to 
which the appellee disagrees. See P.B. ยง 67-5 (c). The counter statement of facts must 
be  supported  with  references  to  the  transcript  or  relevant  documents.  Any  facts  on 
which  the  appellee  intends  to  rely  must  be  set  forth  in  either  the  appellant's  brief  or 
appendix, or in the appellee's brief or appendix. See P.B. ยง 67-5 (c). 

To  the  extent  that  you  disagree  with  the  appellant's  interpretation  of  the  trial 
court's  rulings,  express  your  disagreement  in  the  argument  section  of  the  appellee's 
brief. See P.B. ยง 67-5 (d). The appellee's brief also must include a brief statement of the 
standard of review that the appellee believes should be applied by the court. See P.B. ยง 
67-5 (d). If you agree with the appellant's statement of the standard of review, you may 
so  indicate.  The  appellee's  argument  section  should  also  address  any  claims  raised 
under P.B. ยง 63-4. 

When  the  appellee  is  also  the  cross  appellant,  the  issues  raised  in  the  cross 
appeal should be briefed by the cross appellant in accordance with the rules governing 
the appellant's brief. See P.B. ยง 67-5 (j). 

The  appellee  must  comply  with  the  same  certification  requirements  specified  in 

P.B. ยง 67-2 as the appellant. 

 

The Appellee's Appendix 

The  appellee's  appendix  should  not  include  items  already  included  in  the 
appellant's appendix. If the appellee determines that necessary items were not included 
in  part  one  of  the  appellant's  appendix,  the  appellee  shall  include  those  items.  The 
appellee  shall  include  copies  of  decisions  that  are  not  officially  published  and  may 
include  any  portions  of  the  proceedings  below  that  the  appellee  deems  necessary  for 
the proper presentation of the appeal. See P.B. ยง 67-8 (c). 

The Reply Brief 

Although the filing of a reply brief by the appellant is not required by the rules of 
practice,  if  the  appellee  has  raised  any  issues  pursuant  to  P.B.  ยง  63-4  (a) (1),  a  reply 
brief is the only way for the appellant to respond in writing to such issues. Do not raise 
new issues for the first time in the reply brief. 

 

 

26 

 

Format of Appendices 

When  possible,  parts  one  and  two  of  the  appendix  should  be  bound  together, 
and may be bound together with the brief unless the integrity of the binding is affected 
or  either  part  exceeds  150  pages,  in  which  case  the  appendices  shall  be  separately 
bound.  See  P.B.  ยง  67-2  (b).  The  appendix  should  be  paginated  separately  from  the 
brief. The appendix should contain an index of the names of witnesses whose testimony 
is included and the pages of the transcript on which the testimony appears. You should 
review P.B. ยง 67-2 (c) through (j) for other requirements, such as covers of appendices, 
number of copies to be filed, and the need for electronic versions to be filed by counsel 
and self-represented parties.

ases  are  listed  on  the  Docket  when  all  briefs  and  appendices,  including  reply 
briefs, have been filed, or the time for filing reply briefs has expired. See Practice Book 
(P.B.)  ยงยง  69-1  and  69-2.  The  cases  listed  on  the  Docket  are  considered  ready  for 
assignment  during  the  upcoming  court  term.  The  Docket  contains  the  anticipated 
assignment dates. 

ssignment of cases is ordinarily made in order of readiness.  Counsel of record 
are required to inform the Office of the Appellate Clerk of any requests for variation from 
this order, including requests to argue cases together, requests to waive argument, or of 
any scheduling conflicts, including the date and reasons therefor. See P.B. ยง 69-3. Such 
requests must include certification to counsel of record and to each of counsel's clients 
who are parties to the appeal, and must be received by the Office of the Appellate Clerk 
by the date shown on the Docket.  In making such a request, counsel of record should 
be  aware  that  assignments  in  the  Supreme  Court  and  the  Appellate  Court  take 
precedence over all other Judicial Branch assignments. See P.B. ยงยง 1-2 and 69-3. 

he Assignment for Days is a calendar that shows the dates on which cases are 
assigned  during  a  particular  term  of  the  court.  See  P.B.  ยง  69-3.  The  Office  of  the 
Appellate Clerk must be notified immediately if an assigned case is settled or withdrawn 
for any reason. See P.B. ยง 69-2.

counsel of record in those appellate matters receive notice by mail. Counsel of record in 
cases the Appellate Court decides to consider on its own motion calendar also receive 
notice by mail.

SECTION 10 
 
ORAL ARGUMENT  
 

In the Supreme Court, both the appellant and the appellee are ordinarily allowed 
no more than 30 minutes of argument time respectively. See Practice Book (P.B.) ยง 70-
4. The practice of the Appellate Court is to allow both the appellant and the appellee no 
more  than  20  minutes  of  argument  time  respectively.  The  appellant  may  reserve 
rebuttal  time  out  of  the  allotted  time.  The  appellant  opens  and  generally  closes  the 
argument. See P.B. ยง 70-3. 

If either party fails to appear at oral argument, the court may decide the appellate 
matter  on  the  basis  of  the  briefs,  the  record  and  the  oral  argument  of  the  appearing 
party.  If  neither  party  appears  for  oral  argument,  the  court  may  decide  the  appellate 
matter  on  the  basis  of  the  briefs  and  record,  without  oral  argument.  See  P.B.  ยง  70-3. 
The court may impose sanctions on a nonappearing party in accordance with P.B. ยง 85-
3, including dismissal of the appellate matter. 

Only  one  person  may  argue  for  any  one  party  unless  special  permission  is 
obtained  from  the  court  prior  to  the  date  of  oral  argument.  See  P.B.  ยง  70-4.  Different 
parties on the same side of a case may apportion the argument time allotted to that side 
between themselves without special permission of the court. It is a courtesy to the court, 
however,  to  file  a  letter  with  the  Office  of  the  Appellate  Clerk  prior  to  oral  argument 
indicating your intent to apportion the argument time and how you wish to do so. A party 
must have filed a brief or joined in the brief of another party in order to argue. An amicus 
curiae may not argue unless specifically granted permission to do so. See P.B. ยง 67-7. 
Such permission is rarely granted. 

Sometimes,  there  is  a  change  in  counsel  or  designation  of  arguing  counsel 
before  the  scheduled  argument  date.  A  change  in  counsel  after  a  case  is  ready  for 
assignment requires permission of the court. See P.B. ยง 62-8. 

In  cases  involving  incarcerated,  self-represented  parties,  oral  argument  may,  in 

the discretion of the court, be conducted by videoconference. See P.B. ยง 70-1 (c). 

The  Appellate  Court  may  determine  that  certain  cases  are  appropriate  for 
disposition  without  oral  argument.  See  P.B.  ยง  70-1  (b).  If  a  case  is  chosen  for  such 
disposition, counsel of record are notified that the case will be decided on the briefs and 
record  only.  If  either  party  has  an  objection  to  disposition  without  oral  argument,  that 
party may file a request for argument within 7 days of the issuance of the court's notice. 
The court will either assign the case for oral argument or assign the case for disposition 
without oral argument, as it deems appropriate. 

Counsel  of  record  may,  at  any  time,  request  the  court's  permission  to  submit  a 

case for consideration without oral argument. See P.B. ยง 70-2.

Suggestions for Successful Oral Argument 

The following is a short list of suggestions to keep in mind as you plan your oral 

argument. 

1.  Oral argument  and written briefs  serve  very  different  functions. The  brief  is a 
detailed  and  formal  explanation  of  your  position  that  the  judges  study  at  length 
before  and  after  oral  argument.  Oral  argument,  by  contrast,  is  a  short  and  often 
intense  opportunity  that  is  provided  so  that  you  can  answer  the  judges'  questions 
about the case and your position. Oral argument, therefore, should not be a speech 
or a spoken version of the brief. Instead, use the oral argument to focus the court on 
the key strengths of your case and weaknesses of your opponent's position and to 
answer the judges' questions. 

2.  Effective  oral  argument  requires  detailed  preparation  and  a  mastery  of  the 
facts and law relevant to the case and position. The judges assigned to hear the 
case will have read the parties' briefs before argument and will be familiar with the 
facts  of  the  case,  the  proceedings  below  and  the  key  cases  cited.  So  should  you. 
The judges expect you to know what has occurred in the case, even if you were not 
the  lawyer  who  tried  the  case.  Therefore,  answers  such  as  "I  was  not  the  lawyer 
who tried the case" are not received favorably. The judges expect you to be able to 
answer their questions. 

3.  Do not read your argument from a prepared text or notebook. Bring notes with 
you to the lectern but resist the temptation to read from them. Instead, maintain eye 
contact  with  the  judges  and  engage  them  in  a  discussion  of  your position  and  the 
court's  questions.  A  meaningful  discussion  of  that  kind  will  be  possible  only  if  you 
are  thoroughly  familiar  with  the  facts  of  your  case  and  the  decisions  cited  in  the 
parties' briefs. If you intend to rely at argument on a decision that was not cited in 
the briefs, advise the court and your opponent of the case in advance of argument 
pursuant to P.B. ยง 67-10. 

4.  Do not begin your oral argument with a recitation of the facts or proceedings 
below. Assume that the judges will be familiar with the facts and procedural history 
of your case. You will probably have only a brief opportunity to speak at the outset 
of  the  argument  before  the  judges  begin  to  ask  questions.  Instead  of  wasting  that 
opportunity on matters that the judges already know about or that are not relevant to 
resolution of your appeal, use that brief time to get immediately to the crux of your 
case. 

5.  Expect and welcome questions from the court. The purpose of oral argument is 
to answer the judges' questions. Experienced advocates understand that questions 
are not interruptions but are opportunities to clarify positions, to clear up confusion 
and  to  persuade  the  judges  that  you  should  prevail.  The  best  way  to  give  a  good 
answer  is  to  anticipate  the  questions  in  advance.  Careful  preparation,  therefore, 
requires  you  to  consider  the  questions  that  the  judges  may  have  about  your  case 

 

32 

and to develop concise answers to anticipated questions. Many lawyers consider it 
useful to practice answers to anticipated questions before the argument. 

6.  Listen carefully to the questions and think before answering a question. Make 
sure you understand what the judge is asking  before responding. Long answers to 
questions that were never asked are not helpful. Respond directly and immediately 
to the question with a "yes," "no," or "I do not know," and then explain your answer. 
As  a  practical  matter,  you  will  probably  be  limited  to  a  one  or  two  sentence 
explanation. If you quote from a portion of the record, inform the judges where they 
can find it. 

7.  Never say, "I'll get to that later." The judge wants to explore that issue when he or 
she asks the question, not when you get around to the page of your outline where 
you listed that issue. 

8.  Be courteous and respectful to the court and opposing counsel. Do not argue 
with a judge or pose questions to the court. It is their job to ask  the questions, not 
yours,  although  you  should  clarify  questions  if  needed.  Judges  also  will  not 
appreciate it if you denigrate or are discourteous to your opponent. 

9.  Do not continue your argument or use your rebuttal time if you no longer have 
anything  meaningful  to  say.  If  the  judges  have  no  further  questions,  consider 
whether  it  is  useful  to  continue  your  argument  or  to  waive  the  balance  of  your 
allotted time. 

10. Above all, be honest and candid with the court. If you do not know the answer to 
a question, say so. Also, if there is a decision that is harmful to your case, say so as 
well,  but  explain  why  you  believe  the  court  should  not  follow  it.  You  do  not  help 
yourself by giving evasive or untruthful answers or by failing to acknowledge a fact 
that is harmful to your case. You have an ethical obligation of candor to the court.

SECTION 11 

POSTDECISION MOTIONS AND PETITIONS 

After the Supreme Court or the Appellate Court issues its decision in a case, the 
 
Reporter of Judicial Decisions sends a link to the electronic version of the decision and 
the rescript to the clerk of the trial court. Notice of the decision will be deemed to have 
been  given,  for  all  purposes,  on  the  official  release  date  that  appears  in  the  court's 
decision, not on the date on which the court's decision is posted on the Judicial Branch 
website as an advance release opinion. See Practice Book (P.B.) ยง 71-4.  

Motions for Reconsideration or for Reconsideration En Banc 

After the decision is officially released, a party may ask that the panel of judges 
that  decided  the  case  reconsider  the  decision.  See  P.B.  ยง  71-5.  A  party  also  may 
request reconsideration en banc. Any motion for reconsideration or for reconsideration 
en banc must be filed, and any fees associated with the motion must be paid, within 10 
days from the official release date of the decision being challenged. A fee shall not be 
required for such a motion when either (1) no fee was required to file the appeal, or (2) 
you were granted a waiver of fees to file the appeal. A motion for reconsideration or for 
reconsideration en banc must comply with the general motion requirements enumerated 
in  P.B.  ยงยง  66-2  and  66-3  and  is  generally  limited  to  10  pages.  Motions  for 
reconsideration  or  for  reconsideration  en  banc  should  briefly  state  with  specificity  the 
grounds for requesting reconsideration. 

 

 

Petitions for Certification 

A party cannot obtain Supreme Court review of an Appellate Court judgment by 
filing  an  appeal in  the  Supreme  Court that  challenges  the  Appellate  Court's judgment. 
Rather,  a  party  who  is  aggrieved  by  the  Appellate  Court's  final  determination  of  an 
appeal  may  seek  review  of  the  Appellate  Court's  judgment  by  filing  a  petition  for 
certification  in  the  Supreme  Court.  See  Connecticut  General  Statutes  (C.G.S.)  ยง  51-
197f; P.B. ยง 84-1. Such review is entirely discretionary, and there is no right to review of 
the judgment unless the Supreme Court grants the petition for certification. Petitions for 
certification must be filed, and any fees associated with the petition must be paid, within 
20  days  of  the  date  on  which  the  Appellate  Court's  decision  is  officially  released  or 
within 20 days of the order on any timely filed motion for reconsideration filed with the 
Appellate  Court.  See  P.B.  ยง  84-4  (a).  A  fee  shall  not  be  required  for  a  petition  for 
certification  when  either  (1)  no  fee  was  required  to  file  the  appeal,  or  (2)  you  were 
granted a waiver of fees to file the appeal. Cross petitions for certification may be filed 
by any other party who is aggrieved by the Appellate Court's judgment within 10 days of 
the filing of the original petition for certification. See P.B. ยง 84-4 (c).   

 

 

34 

 

Practice  Book  ยง  84-5  governs  the  form  of  the  petition  for  certification,  and  it 

directs that the petition must include 

๏ท  a statement of the question or questions presented for review 
๏ท  a  statement  of  the  basis  for  the  extraordinary  relief  of  certification 

(see also P.B. ยง 84-2) 
๏ท  a summary of the case  
๏ท  a  concise  argument  explaining  the  reasons  relied  on  in  support  of 

the petition  

๏ท  an appendix that contains the papers specified in P.B. ยง 84-5 (5). 

ithin  10  days  of  the  filing  of  a  petition  for  certification,  a  party  may  file  a 
statement  in  opposition  to  the  petition  for  certification  with  the  Office  of  the  Appellate 
Clerk. See P.B. ยง 84-6. When the Supreme Court rules on a petition for certification, the 
Office of the Appellate Clerk sends notice of the order granting or denying the petition to 
the  trial  court  clerk  and  to  all  counsel  of  record.  When  the  Supreme  Court  grants  a 
petition  for  certification,  the  successful  petitioner  (i.e.,  appellant)  must  file  the  appeal 
and pay any fees required within 20 days from the issuance of notice that certification to 
appeal has been granted. See P.B. ยง 84-9. 

Petitions for Writs of Certiorari and Motions for Stay 

When  a  party  wishes  to  obtain  a  stay  of  execution  of  a  Connecticut  Supreme 
Court  judgment  pending  a  decision  on  a  petition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari  filed  with  the 
United  States  Supreme  Court,  the  party  should  file  a  motion  for  stay  directed  to  the 
Connecticut Supreme Court within 20 days of the official release date of the Connecticut 
Supreme Court's decision. See P.B. ยง 71-7. The timely filing of the motion will operate 
as a stay pending the Connecticut Supreme Court's decision on the motion for stay. 

When  the  Connecticut  Supreme  Court  has  denied  a  petition  for  certification  to 
appeal from an Appellate Court judgment, a party seeking a stay of execution pending a 
decision  in  the  case  by  the  United  States  Supreme  Courtโor  seeking  that  a  stay  of 
execution already in existence at the time certification was denied be extendedโshould 
file a motion for stay directed to the Appellate Court within  20 days of the Connecticut 
Supreme  Court's  decision  denying  the  petition  for  certification.  The  timely  filing  of  the 
motion  for  stay  will  operate  as  a  stay  pending  the  Appellate  Court's  decision  on  the 
motion for stay. 

Bills of Costs 

A  party  that  has  prevailed  before  the  Appellate  Court  or  the  Supreme  Court  is 
entitled  to  costs,  and  a  prevailing  party  must  file  a  bill  of  costs  with  the  Office  of  the 
Appellate  Clerk  within  30  days  after  notice  of  the  official  release  of  the  appellate 
decision  or  within  30  days  of  the  denial  of  a  motion  for  reconsideration  or  petition  for 
certification,  whichever  is  latest.  See  P.B.  ยง  71-2.  Any  party  may  seek  review  of  the 
appellate clerk's taxation of costs by filing a motion to reconsider costs. See P.B. ยง 71-3.

1The official Practice Book, which is republished annually, may also be accessed 
 
at (www.jud.ct.gov/Publications/PracticeBook/PB.pdf). It should be noted that when new 
rules  of  practice  are  adopted  or  existing  rules  are  amended,  an  official  commentary, 
which often explains the reason for the rule change, appears after the rule in the official 
Practice  Book.  The  official  commentary  generally  appears  only  in  the  edition  of  the 
official  Practice  Book  corresponding  to  the  year  in  which  the  new  rule  or  amendment 
first was published. 
 
includes prior years' official commentaries.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
