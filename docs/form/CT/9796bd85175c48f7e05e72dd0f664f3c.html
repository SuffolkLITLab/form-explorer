The use of personal identifying information and hospital, psychiatric and medical records in grievance matters is generally prohibited by the Statewide Grievance Committee and Grievance Panel Rules of Procedure: Rule 1 (F) of the Statewide Grievance Committee Rules of Procedure: . F. Grievance complaints filed with the Statewide Grievance Committee must be submitted on form JD GC 6 and must contain an original and six copies. Any attachments must be properly collated and attached to the original and each copy . of the complaint. Grievance complaints and their attachments must not include personal identifying information as defined . by Section 4 7 (a) of the Connecticut Practice Book or another person's hospital, psychiatric or medical records. The . Complainant must redact [black out parts of] the complaint and its attachments to remove any personal identifying . information. A Complainant who wants to file another person's hospital, psychiatric or medical records must say in the . complaint how the documents are relevant and will help prove the complaint. The proposed hospital, psychiatric or . medical records accompanying the complaint must be submitted in a sealed envelope labeled ﬁproposed hospital, . psychiatric or medical records. ﬂ If the complaint is forwarded to a grievance panel for investigation under Section 2 32 (a) . (1) of the Connecticut Practice Book, the grievance panel will review the statement and follow Rule 1 (I) of the Grievance . Panel Rules of Procedure. If the Complainant is Disciplinary Counsel, the Statewide Bar Counsel, the Statewide . Grievance Committee or a reviewing committee thereof, or a Grievance Panel, then any records, including hospital, . psychiatric or medical records as well as records containing personal identifying information may be included in the initial . grievance complaint without an offer of proof. Materials that do not meet these requirements will be returned. Rule 1 (H) and (I) of the Grievance Panel Rules of Procedure: . H. Except for materials filed by Disciplinary Counsel, the Statewide Bar Counsel, the Statewide Grievance Committee or a reviewing committee thereof, or a Grievance Panel, no materials sent to the Grievance Panel investigating the . complaint, including, but not limited to the complaint and the answer shall include personal identifying information as . defined by Section 4 7 of the Connecticut Practice Book. The person filing any materials with personal identifying . information must redact them. The Grievance Panel or its counsel may redact materials that do not follow this rule. I. Except for materials filed by Disciplinary Counsel, the Statewide Bar Counsel, the Statewide Grievance Committee or a reviewing committee thereof, or a Grievance Panel, no materials sent to the Grievance Panel investigating the complaint, . including the complaint and the answer, shall include hospital, psychiatric or medical records. If a Complainant, . Respondent or Disciplinary Counsel pursuing the matter under Section 2 32 (f) of the Connecticut Practice Book want to . file a hospital, psychiatric or medical record with the Grievance Panel, then the record (s) must be filed in a sealed . envelope, that has the case name and number and the name of the person filing it written on the envelope. The record (s) . must be accompanied by a written statement explaining how the material (s) is relevant and how it will help prove the . complaint or a defense to the complaint. Instructions page 2 (1) The Grievance Panel and its counsel will determine whether the written statement of the person who filed the hospital, psychiatric or medical record (s) establishes that the material (s) is relevant and will help prove the complaint or a defense . to the complaint. If the written statement does not demonstrate why the hospital, psychiatric or medical record (s) is . relevant and how it will help prove the complaint or a defense to the complaint, the record (s) will be returned to the person . who filed them, and no copy will be kept as part of the Grievance Panel's record. (2) If the written statement establishes that the hospital, psychiatric or medical record (s) is relevant and will help prove the complaint or a defense to the complaint, then the Grievance Panel will review the record (s) with its counsel in private. If . upon review of the record, the Grievance Panel determines that the record (s) is not relevant despite the written statement . of the person filing it, then the record (s) will be retuned and no copy will be kept as part of the Grievance Panel's record. (3) If after reviewing the record (s) in accordance with subsection (2) , the Grievance Panel determines that the that the record (s) is relevant but more harmful or prejudicial than helpful in proving the complaint or a defense to the complaint, . then the record (s) will be returned to the person who filed them, and no copy of it will be kept as part of the Grievance . Panel's record. If the Grievance Panel decides that the record (s) is relevant and that it is more helpful in proving the . complaint or a defense to the complaint than harmful or prejudicial, then it will become a part of the Grievance Panel . record and Grievance Counsel will give a copy of it to the other participants. Nothing in this rule prevents a Complainant, Respondent, Disciplinary Counsel or a witness from raising an objection to the use of any hospital, psychiatric or medical record. 7. In answering question 2 on the complaint form, give the name of the attorney, not a law firm who you are making the complaint against.

Grievance Counsel do not have to provide proof of . representation when filing complaints on behalf of Grievance Panels.
