PREAMBLE TO CHILD SUPPORT AND ARREARAGE GUIDELINES 

This preamble is intended to assist users of the child support and arrearage guidelines but 

(a)  Introduction 

is not part of the official regulations. 

(1) Purposes of preamble 

following: 

The purposes of this preamble to the child support and arrearage guidelines are the 

(A) To identify for child support practitioners, judges, family support magistrates, and the 

public changes from the former child support guidelines to ease the transition to the new 
guidelines. 

(B) To provide supplemental background information to assist the user in understanding 

the purposes and principles underlying the guidelines. 

(C) To limit the need for explanations and commentary in the guidelines to keep them 

(D) To provide for uniformity of interpretation by the Connecticut bar, judiciary, child 

simple and readable. 

support agencies, and the public. 

(2) Organization of the regulations 

follows: 

(A) Section 46b-215a-1.  Definitions 

The child support and arrearage guidelines regulations are organized into six sections, as 

This section contains definitions of key words and phrases that have a special meaning as 

used in the guidelines. 

(B) Section 46b-215a-2c.  Child support guidelines

(b) Summary of changes 

This subsection of the preamble identifies the differences between the new guidelines and 

the 2005 guidelines to quickly orient those who are familiar with the guidelines to the changes.  
Purely technical changes, such as renumbering, punctuation, or minor language changes that do 
not significantly alter the meaning of the provision are omitted from this discussion.  More 
information on the reasons for significant changes is found later in the preamble. 

(1) There have been changes made to the definitions section.  

(2) Allowable deductions from gross income 

If the person seeking the award is seeking a downward modification, no deduction will be 
allowed for another award if, when the other award entered, the award for which modification is 
sought was taken into consideration. 

(3) Gross income 

(A)  Inclusions in gross income 

• 

Incentive based compensation (such as stock options, restricted stock, restricted 
stock units, restricted stock rights and other forms of delayed or deferred 
compensation) if, and, or when vested or exercisable, clarified as Gross Income 
inclusion.  

•  Social Security benefits paid to the parent for the parent’s own needs are included 
in gross income, provided when the parent whose income is being determined 
receives both Supplemental Security Income and Social Security disability or 
Social Security retirement benefits, the Social Security income inclusion shall not 
exceed $5 per week. 

•  The commission clarified that Social Security dependency benefits paid on behalf 
of a child whose support is being determined is included in the income of the 
parent on whose earnings records the dependency benefit was determined Jenkins 
v. Jenkins, 243 Conn. 584 (1998). 

(B)  Exclusion from gross income 

Social Security disability benefits or Social Security retirement benefits in excess of $5 

per week are now excluded when the recipient also receives a Supplemental Security Income 
supplement to bring his or her income up to the Supplemental Security Income subsistence 
threshold. 

(4) Net disposable income 

Alimony paid by one of the parents to the other is no longer added to the net income of 
the receiving parent, or deducted from the net income of the paying parent, in the calculation of 

 

ii 

 

iii 

 

net disposable income, for purposes of calculating unreimbursed medical and child care 
contribution amounts. 

(5) Child support obligations for higher incomes 

Child support when parents’ net weekly income exceeds $4,000 shall be determined 

consistent with statutory criteria, including C.G.S. §46b-84(d). 

●  The minimum presumptive support amount shall be the support amount at the $4,000 

net weekly income. 

●  The maximum presumptive support amount shall be determined by multiplying the 
parents’ net weekly income by the applicable percentage shown at the $4,000 net 
income level.  

●  The minimum and maximum presumptive amounts may be rebutted by application of 

the deviation criteria and/or statutory criteria including §46b-84(d).  

6) Supplemental orders as part of current support computation 

Future income of unknown amounts such as bonuses and other incentive based 
compensation that is awarded in future years, or vests in future years, or can be exercised in 
future years, is required to be part of the child support award to be included in the award for the 
year in which such amounts are includible in income for tax purposes through the use of 
supplemental orders. 

 

  (

(7) Schedule of Basic Child Support Obligations 

•  The low-income obligor area is extended to slightly higher incomes. 
•  The percentages and dollar amounts are adjusted.  
 

(8) Child support for shared physical custody 

●  The definition of shared physical custody is amended to provide that the physical 
residence of the child is shared when the child has substantially equal time and 
contact with each parent.  

●  For shared physical custody, the presumptive support amount is the amount that the 

parent with higher income would pay to the other parent. Shared physical custody can 
be grounds for deviating, as under prior guidelines. These guidelines add an 
additional consideration where a deviation might be warranted in a shared physical 
custody situation where the parents have substantially equal income. 

9) Determining the amount of current support when another child resides with a 

Revised the definition of “qualified child” by deleting the requirement that a parent be the 

child’s legal guardian or that the child live with the parent for specified periods of time. A 
qualified child does not include foster or step child.

(10) Health care coverage and expenses 
 

●  Clarified that health care coverage for which awards are made includes, but is not 

limited to, medical care, mental health care, dental care or vision care.  

●  Added provision that health care awards may include orders to pay a cash medical 

●  Added definition of health care expenses to cover a broad range of expenses. 
●  Health care insurance and cash medical support cannot exceed “reasonable cost” as

defined by statute.  

●  Alimony is no longer considered when determining the parents’ percentage share of 

unreimbursed medical expenses. 

11) Child care contribution 

●  A weekly dollar amount may be awarded if there is agreement by the parties or if 

there is non-payment of prior orders. 

●  Alimony is no longer considered when determining the parents’ percentage share of 

child care contribution. 

(12) Deviation criteria 

●  Added factor to the shared physical custody criterion that both parents having 

substantially equal income may also be grounds for deviation. 

●  Added criterion that total child support award exceeding 55% of obligor’s net income 
on any components of the award other than current support may also be grounds for 
deviation. 

Arrearage payment amount increases from 50% to 100% if the parents have no present

 (14) Worksheet 

•  Deletes reference to mother and father, substitutes Parent A and Parent B. 
•  Added summary of orders to calculate total award as percentage of income obligor’s 

income. 

•  Revised for plain language. 
•  Alimony is no longer considered when determining the parents’ percentage share of 

unreimbursed medical expenses.

(15) Determining the amount of current support when another child resides with a 

parent 

•  Definition of qualified child revised to remove the requirements with respect to legal 

guardian or child living with parent for specified periods of time. 
•  A qualified child does not include a step child or foster child clarified.

c)  Purposes of guidelines 

The primary purposes of the child support and arrearage guidelines are: 

(1) To provide uniform procedures for establishing an adequate level of support for 

children, and for repayment of child support arrearages, subject to the ability of parents to pay. 

(2) To make awards more equitable by ensuring the consistent treatment of persons in 

similar circumstances. 

(3) To improve the efficiency of the court process by promoting settlements and by 

giving courts and the parties guidance in setting the levels of awards. 

(4) To conform to applicable federal and state statutory and regulatory mandates. 

 

(d) Basic principles 

The Connecticut Child Support Guidelines are based on the Income Shares Model. The 

Income Shares Model presumes that the child should receive the same proportion of parental 
income as he or she would have received if the parents lived together. Underlying the income 
shares model, therefore, is the policy that the parents should bear any additional expenses 
resulting from the maintenance of two separate households instead of one, since it is not the 
child’s decision that the parents divorce, separate, or otherwise live separately. 

The Income Shares Model has proven to be the most widely accepted, particularly due to 

its consideration of the income of both parents. Thirty eight states follow the Income Shares 
Model.  Four states and the District of Columbia have shifted over to the Income Shares Model 
since Connecticut last revised its guidelines in 2005.  The other models used by states are 
“Percentage of Obligor Income” (ten states) and “Melson Formula” (three states). The Income 
Shares Model reflects presently available data on the average costs of raising children in 
households across a wide range of incomes and family sizes. Because household spending on 
behalf of children is intertwined with spending on behalf of adults for most expenditure 
categories, it is difficult to determine the exact proportion allocated to children in individual 
cases, even with exhaustive financial affidavits. However, a number of authoritative economic 
studies based on national data provide reliable estimates of the average amount of household 
expenditures on children in intact households. These studies have found that the proportion of 
household spending devoted to children is systematically and consistently related to the level of 
household income and to the number of children. 

In general, the economic studies have found that spending on children declines as a 
proportion of family income as that income increases. This spending pattern exists because 
families at higher income levels do not have to devote most or all of their incomes to perceived 
necessities. Rather, they can allocate some proportion of income to savings and other non-
consumption expenditures, as well as discretionary adult goods.  This principle was reflected in 
past guidelines, since 1994, and is continued in these guidelines. Again, following the pattern of 

 

v 

 

          (

 

prior guidelines declining percentages at all levels of combined net weekly income begin outside 
the darker shaded area of the schedule. However, the commission had no economic data that 
supports a conclusion that this pattern continues when parents’ net weekly income exceeds 
$4,000. This commission therefore decided to not extend either the range of the schedule or the 
application of the concept of declining percentages beyond its current $4,000 upper limit. 

Economic studies also demonstrate that a diminishing portion of family income is spent 

on each additional child.  This apparently results from two factors.  The first is economy of scale.  
That is, as more children are added to a family, sharing of household items is increased, and 
fewer of those items must be purchased.  The second is a reallocation of expenditures.  That is, 
as additional children are added, each family member’s share of expenditures decreases to 
provide for the needs of the additional members. 

Based on this economic evidence, adjusted for Connecticut's relatively high income 
distribution (as explained later in this preamble), the guidelines allow for the calculation of 
current support based on each parent's share of the amount estimated to be spent on a child if the 
parents and child live in an intact household. The amount calculated for the custodial parent is 
retained by the custodial parent and presumed spent on the child. The amount calculated for the 
noncustodial parent establishes the level of current support to be ordered by the court. These two 
amounts together constitute the current support obligation of both parents for the support of the 
child.  Intact households are used for the estimates because the guidelines aim to provide 
children the same support they would receive if the parents lived together. More than this, 
however, support amounts would be set unduly low if based on spending patterns of single-
parent families, as they generally experience a high incidence of poverty and lower incomes than 
intact families. 

 

(e)  The Schedule of Basic Child Support Obligations 

This subsection of the preamble explains how the commission derived the percentages in 
the Schedule of Basic Child Support Obligations (hereafter, the schedule), and how and why the 
new schedule is different from the one in the 2005 guidelines. The commission contracted with 
the Center for Policy Research of Denver, Colorado to develop a new schedule based on more 
recent economic data. 

(1) Updated economic data 

Federal regulations for the Title IV-D child support enforcement program (45 CFR 
302.56) require among other things that the guidelines review process include a consideration of 
economic data on the cost of raising children. The new schedule was based primarily on a 2011 
study conducted by Dr. David Betson of Notre Dame University, through the University of 
Wisconsin Institute for Research on Poverty. Dr. Betson used data from the U.S. Bureau of 
Labor Statistics’ 2004-09 Consumer Expenditure Survey for his research.  

The Consumer Expenditure Survey methodology has changed somewhat since the last 

guideline revision.  The survey now measures “outlays” as opposed to “expenditures.”  
“Outlays” include installment plans on purchases, mortgage principal payments, and payments 
on home equity loans, while “expenditures” do not. The new methodology also corrects for the 
fact that expenditures among those surveyed consistently exceed income for low income 
households. This phenomenon results from incomplete reporting or from households using 

 

vi 

 

savings or credit cards to make purchases beyond their income. The Consumer Expenditure 
Survey corrected for this, by imputing income to the lower income brackets. These two 
adjustments in methodology affected the economic report.  

The commission notes that the identification of spending categories for the development 
of estimates of expenditures on children does not translate well into an obligation for parents to 
spend specific portions of their own income, or support payments received from the other parent, 
on particular categories of items for their children.  As stated earlier in this preamble, spending 
on children and adults in families is inextricably intertwined, and the 2009 commission continues 
to reject any requirement that the custodial parent provide for an accounting of how support 
payments, or the custodial parent’s portion of the presumptive current support obligation, are 
used to provide for the child.  An accounting requirement would represent an unreasonable 
administrative burden on courts and administrative agencies, and would be extremely intrusive 
for custodial parents.  The commission does not believe it is appropriate for the government to 
micromanage family finances. On the other hand, where it can be shown that a parent’s failure to 
provide for a child rises to the level of neglect, it certainly is appropriate for individuals to enlist 
the help of appropriate courts or agencies to assess the appropriateness of a custody change or 
other measures to ensure the child’s welfare. 

The foregoing being said, however, the commission emphasizes that it is the obligation of 

both parents to contribute to the support of their children to the extent of their ability, as defined 
by the guidelines and ordered by the courts.  The obligation to support does not rest solely with 
the parent who is ordered to make payments to the other parent.  It extends also to the parent 
receiving those court-ordered payments. In addition to spending the designated support payments 
on the child, the parent receiving such payments remains obligated to expend a portion of his or 
her own personal income on the child’s behalf.  The specific percentage expected to be spent is 
identical, absent application of a deviation criterion, to the percentage allocated by the other 
parent, as established by the schedule. 

(2) Rothbarth estimator 

Economists determine the average household spending on children by comparing the 
expenditures of two households that are equally well off economically, one with children and 
one without. To make this comparison, they must first determine a standard of well-being which 
is independent of income. The Rothbarth estimator (named for Erwin Rothbarth, the economist 
who first proposed it) is such a standard. It is based on the percentage of household income spent 
on adult goods, and the commission continues to regard it as the best benchmark to use in 
developing guidelines.  It is the most widely used standard among states that have updated their 
guidelines based on newer child-rearing cost data. 

(3) Adjustment for Connecticut 

The data reported by Betson using the Rothbarth estimator (hereafter, Betson/Rothbarth) 

were developed using a nationally representative sample of households. Connecticut, however, 
has an income structure that is much higher than the national average. Connecticut now ranks 
third highest in median family income among states, down from second highest in 2005. This 
fact, in the commission's judgment, continues to warrant an upward adjustment to the 
Betson/Rothbarth percentages, for the following reasons: 

 

vii 

 

(A) Connecticut household can be expected to spend about the same percentage of 
income on children as a nationally representative household with a lower level of income 
because of the Connecticut household's relative position in the state's income distribution. 

(B) Households with lower levels of income generally spend a higher proportion of their 

income on children. 

The amount of the upward adjustment in the new schedule was calculated with reference 

to 2010 Census data indicating differences in family income between Connecticut and the 
national average. 

(4) Low-income adjustments 

(A)  An historical perspective 

One of the continuing themes that surfaced throughout the commission’s review process 

was the challenge of striking an appropriate balance between the interests of parents and children 
in the setting of a child support award when one or both parents are of extremely limited means.  
On the one hand is the child’s interest in sharing equitably in the parents’ income, consistent 
with the income shares model.  On the other hand is the low-income parent’s need to retain 
sufficient income to provide for his or her own subsistence, in order to permit such parent to play 
a positive role in the child’s life. 

The present commission determined that continuing the imposition of a minimal order of 
support even at poverty levels, as established in the 1999 guidelines and maintained in the 2005 
guidelines, was consistent with the underlying public policy making parents primarily 
responsible for the support of their children.  The imposition of an order of a specific amount of 
child support, no matter how minimal, in almost every case is intended to convey the important 
message to both parents that an obligation to support exists even where the ability to pay is 
limited. (See the preamble to the 2005 guidelines for a fuller historical perspective).  

(B)  Low-income adjustments in the new schedule 

The present commission recognizes that in low-income families where the parents reside 
in two separate households, there will inevitably be immense financial pressures on both parents 
to maintain themselves and their children adequately. Nonetheless, the commission returned 
repeatedly in its deliberations to a concern for the best interests of the child.  It therefore 
continues to prescribe minimal support payments for even very low-income noncustodial 
parents, but has tempered this determination with several further adjustments in the low-income 
area of the schedule, in an effort to build upon and refine the commendable work of previous 
commissions. 

(i)  No obligation for parents with less than $50 net income 

The present commission retains the elimination of a child support obligation for 

noncustodial parents earning less than $50 per week net income instituted by the 2005 
commission.  Parents with such extremely low income are in truly desperate circumstances, and 
their first concern, even before the payment of a child support obligation, understandably is their 
own economic survival.   

viii 

 

 

   

(ii) Increased range of low-income area 

The 2005 guidelines phased out the low-income, darker shaded area of the schedule at the 

point where the obligor retained about $250 per week net income.  The present commission has 
extended the reach of the protections associated with this area of the schedule by increasing to 
approximately $290 per week the level of net income at which the low-income designation 
ceases to apply.  The effect of this change is not only to deflate the required support contribution 
for borderline low-income obligors, but also to extend to such obligors the additional protections 
accorded such obligors under other provisions of the guidelines, which are addressed elsewhere 
in this preamble. 

(iii) Lower percentages in the darker shaded area 

The commission also slightly reduced some of the percentages in the low-income area of 
the schedule in light of the commission extending the darker shaded area of the schedule.  In the 
commission’s view, these reductions will ultimately work to the benefit of children, while 
serving the immediate self-support needs of low-income obligors, since they will assist such 
obligors in establishing a pattern of payment based on realistic expectations of their ability to 
pay. 

(5) Extension to higher incomes 

The 2005 commission extended the applicable range of the schedule from $2,500 to 
$4,000 combined net weekly income, in response to the 1996-1999 Consumer Expenditure 
Survey, and comments from the public and from many practicing family law attorneys.  This 
commission relied on the updated data from the 2004-2009 Consumer Expenditure Survey, 
which did not include sufficient economic data above $4,000 combined net weekly income to 
extend the range of the schedule above the $4,000 income level.  In recognition of recent 
Supreme and Appellate Court case law addressing households with combined net weekly income 
of over $4,000 and further in recognition of the lack of sufficient economic data, courts should 
exercise their discretion consistent with the income scope as set forth in 46b-215a-2c (a)(2) on a 
case by case basis where the combined income exceeds the range of the schedule.  When the 
combined net weekly income exceeds $4,000, the presumptive support amount shall range from 
the dollar amount at the $4,000 level to the percentage amount at that level applied to the 
combined net weekly income consistent with statutory criteria, including C.G.S. § 46b-84(d).  
This presumptive support range may be rebutted by application of the deviation criteria and by 
the statutory factors set forth in C.G.S. § 46b-84(d), for an award above or below these 
parameters.  In exercising discretion in any given case, the magistrate or trial judge should 
consider evidence submitted by the parties regarding actual past and projected child support 
expenditures to determine the appropriate order.  

f)  Guidelines worksheet 

  (

The commission continues to prescribe a worksheet for use in calculating support 

amounts under the child support and arrearage guidelines.  While the revised worksheet looks 
similar to the one included in the former regulations, it is different in a number of important 
respects and has been simplified using a plain language approach in an effort to make the 
worksheet more user-friendly. 

 

 

ix 

 

(1) Heading 

The heading is identical,  except that the terms “Mother” and “Father” have been 

replaced with the terms “Parent A” and “Parent B” in order to recognize the evolving trend 
towards a modern definition for the family unit.  

(2) Net weekly income calculations 

The commission changed the title of this section from “net income” to “net weekly 
income” and deleted the words “weekly amounts” set out in parentheses in order to simplify the 
worksheet. 

Also, the 2005 commission added an area for calculating the imputed support obligation 
for a qualified child by adding lines 12a through 12d for the purpose of breaking down the fairly 
complex calculation into a few simpler steps. In order to further clarify this calculation, this 
commission added more steps as reflected in lines 12a through 12f and provided more explicit 
language and instruction in lines 12, 13, and 14.  

(3) Current support calculation 

The commission inserted additional instructions and/or substituted mathematical symbols 

in place of spelling out the word in lines 14, 17, 18, and 20.  Also, due to a renumbering of the 
worksheet, as a result of the changes set forth in section (f) of the preamble, line 20 was changed 
to reflect that the noncustodial parent’s amount should be entered on line 30 as opposed to line 
34.  Lastly, the words “unless deviation criteria apply – see section VII” in line 20 were deleted 
due to space limitations. 

(4) Net disposable income calculation 

The 2005 commission added this section due to the increased complexity of the net 
disposable income calculation. This commission replaced the terms “ Mother” and “Father” with 
the terms “Parent A” and “Parent B” for reasons stated in section (f)(1) above and to provide 
consistency throughout the worksheet.  

The main change in this section of the worksheet is that the net disposable income 
computation no longer considers the impact of alimony as a basis to increase and/or decrease a 
parent’s net disposable income. The provision for the alimony calculation proved unworkable. 
Alimony orders are made simultaneously and therefore not available for the calculation. 
Additionally, alimony is meant as spousal support, not for the support of children. Due to the 
elimination of the alimony calculation steps this section was shortened from six to three lines.   
This section now consists of lines 21, 22 and 23 which also have been changed to reflect 
mathematical symbols in place of spelling out the word. 

(5) Unreimbursed medical expense calculation 

This section has been renumbered as lines 24, 25 and 26 (formerly lines 27, 28 and 29) as 

a result of the worksheet changes set forth in section (f) of the preamble.  The commission also 
modified lines 24, 25 and 26 to provide more explicit instructions for calculating each parent’s 
percentage contribution.  

(6) Child care contribution calculation 

This section has been renumbered as lines 27 and 28 (formerly lines 30 and 31) as a 

result of the worksheet changes set forth in section (f) of the preamble.  The commission also 

 

x 

 

simplified the child care contribution calculation by using plain language to make the 
instructions easier to understand. 

(7) Arrearage payment calculation 

This section of the worksheet has been renumbered to line 29 (formerly line 32) as a 

result of the worksheet changes set forth in section (f) of the preamble. Due to the renumbering 
of the worksheet, the first line of this section now directs the user to multiply Line 30 (formerly 
Line 34) from prior worksheet by twenty percent to calculate the presumptive arrearage payment 
amount.  Furthermore, the present commission has retained the twenty percent amount that was 
originally selected to be consistent with the general rule.  The most significant change, however, 
is that this commission implemented an arrearage order increase from 50% to 100% of the 
current order if child is deceased, emancipated, or over the age of eighteen and  has completed 
twelfth grade or has attained the age of nineteen, whichever occurs first. - see box(C).  

(8)  Summary of Worksheet 

Due to the decision to move the deviation criteria section to the end of the worksheet, this 

section was renumbered as Section VII and the lines appearing in this section have been 
renumbered as lines 30 through 35.  

The commission changed the title of this section from “Recommended Orders” to 
“Summary of Worksheet” to clarify that the purpose of the section is to record the presumptive 
amount for each component of the total child support award - i.e. presumptive current support, 
arrearage payment, total arrearage, cash medical, unreimbursed medical expenses, and child care 
contribution, all in one section.  A “total child support award calculation” box is added to set 
forth the total child support award and its components.  A line was added to record the 
presumptive cash medical amount and the unreimbursed medical expense line still prompts for 
entry of percentage amounts but changes the terms “mother” and “father” to “Parent A” and 
“Parent B”.  The line added in 2005 for “additional orders” is deleted. Any additional orders 
should be provided on an additional page. 

 (9) Deviation criteria 

This section of the worksheet continues to include a listing of all criteria with a check box 

for the user to indicate which, if any, criteria are being cited to rebut the presumptive support 
amounts.  The commission added a deviation criterion under “Special circumstances” when the 
total award exceeds 55% of the obligor’s net income. This section’s placement on the worksheet 
has also changed.  Since the deviation criteria logically would be the last factor to be considered 
by the trier of fact, the commission reasoned that it should appear at the end of the worksheet as 
Section VIII thereby following the section summarizing the total child support award.  The 
section has been renumbered to line 36 (formerly line 33) as a result of the worksheet changes 
set forth in section (f) of the preamble.  

When there is more than one child in common and each parent provides the primary 

residence of at least one of the children, there is a split custody situation.  The 1994 commission 
adopted an approach that uses the combined parental income to calculate separate obligations for 

 

xi 

 

(g)  Applicability of child support guidelines 

(1) Split custody situations 

   

the children of each household. These obligations are then offset to arrive at a single obligation 
which one parent pays to the other to correctly apportion their combined income based on a 
consistent application of the child support guidelines. The present commission continues to 
endorse this approach to the split custody situation, and has retained the applicable provisions 
from the 2005 guidelines with minor language changes. 

(2) Cases where another child resides with a parent 

In an effort to improve the consistency of orders in which the needs of multiple families 

are involved, the 1999 commission eliminated the deviation criterion for needs of a parent’s prior 
or subsequent children in favor of a deduction from gross income in the amount of an imputed 
support obligation for a dependent child living with the parent.   The present commission has 
deleted the requirement that the parent is the child’s legal guardian, or if not the child’s legal 
guardian, that the child lived with such parent for specified periods of time.  Another child does 
not include a step-child or a foster child.   

The amount of the allowable deduction for qualified children is calculated as follows. 
First, a current support obligation is calculated for all of the parent’s children, including those 
who are the subject of the support determination and those for whom the parent is seeking a 
gross income deduction. The other parent’s income is not considered in this calculation. Second, 
the resulting obligation is divided by the total number of the parent’s children, and the resulting 
amount is multiplied by the number of qualified children (those for whom the parent is claiming 
a deduction). The product is the total allowable deduction for all qualified children. 

While the deduction for qualified children accounts for the basic support needs of such 

children, it does not address any child care expenses attributable to them.  Accordingly, the 2005 
commission added a deviation criterion that may be used to reduce only the presumptive child 
care contribution for the child whose support is being determined and the present commission 
has retained the deviation criterion in the new guidelines.   

(3) Shared Physical Custody  

The commission amended the definition of shared physical custody in response to cases 
involving more equal parental sharing of time and contact with the child.  The amendment also 
reflects a trend away from “custodial/noncustodial” and “visitation” language toward the concept 
of shared parenting.  The commission recognizes that within the context of shared physical 
custody, both parents are essentially custodial.  

In conjunction with the definitional change, the commission determined there was a need 

for a method to calculate the presumptive child support obligation in shared physical custody 
situations because neither parent is considered the custodial parent.  The commission determined 
that the most practical approach was for such obligation to be paid by the parent with the higher 
income.  The commission included this calculation method within the existing procedures for 
determining the recommended child support order. 

The commission further recognized, however, that the presumptive calculation method 
creates many situations in which the best interests of the child and fairness to the parents may 
warrant a deviation from the presumptive child support award amount.  Consequently, the 
commission refined the shared physical custody deviation by removing references to “custodial” 
and “noncustodial” parents and substituting the designations of “lower net weekly income” and 
“higher net weekly income” parents.  The commission also added a provision to allow deviation 

 

xii 

 

from the presumptive support amount when both parents have substantially equal income.  The 
commission continues to reject the notion of a mathematical formula based on the time spent 
with each parent to determine support amounts in the shared physical custody context.  
Application of such a formula would tend to shift the focus away from the best interests of the 
child and more toward financial considerations, which would be inconsistent with Connecticut 
law. 

(4) Health care coverage contribution 

(A) In general 

The present commission recognizes, consistent with the determinations of prior 
commissions, that clear and adequate health care provisions must be included in the guidelines if 
they are to serve the best interests of the child.  Such provisions are mandated by Title IV-D of 
the Social Security Act, implementing federal regulations and corresponding state law 
provisions. All states now have in their child support guidelines some provision for addressing 
the child’s health care needs. The commission accordingly has retained the requirement for each 
child support award entered under the guidelines to include a provision for either parent or both 
parents to contribute to the health care coverage of the child.  The requirement may be met by an 
order to name the child as a beneficiary of health insurance carried by or available at reasonable 
cost to a parent.  In addition, the commission added that the health care coverage requirement 
may include cash medical support.  If such insurance is not available, the order must require 
application for HUSKY B or an equivalent government-sponsored plan, as available.  The 
commission changed the prior “Exceptions for low-income obligors” in the 2005 guidelines to be 
“Exceptions to cash medical support order” in the current guidelines. Cash medical support 
includes contribution toward HUSKY costs and other ongoing extraordinary medical expenses. 

(B) Unreimbursed medical expenses 

(i)  Apportionment method 

The commission has retained in the present regulations the basic method for apportioning 
unreimbursed medical expenses that was adopted by the 1999 commission. The 2005 guidelines 
allowed the user to deduct 80% of any alimony payments to the other parent from the net income 
of the parent paying the alimony, while adding the same amount to the net income of the parent 
receiving such alimony. This commission has removed alimony paid by one parent to the other 
in the determination of net disposable income in an effort to simplify the calculation. This 
commission continues to add any Social Security dependency benefits for the child on the 
earnings record of the noncustodial parent to the custodial parent’s net income, and deduct this 
same amount from the noncustodial parent’s net income to determine each parent’s net 
disposable income.  

(ii)  Other issues 

The commission continues in the present guidelines the policy of not exempting low-

income obligors from payment of unreimbursed medical expenses. It also continues to include 
unreimbursed medical expenses as a reason for deviating from presumptive support amounts 
where such expenses are found to be extraordinary and to exist on a substantial and continuing 
basis. 

 

 

xiii 

 

(5) Child care contribution 

(A) In general 

The commission has retained the provision requiring the noncustodial parent to reimburse 

the custodial parent for a portion of the child care costs incurred on behalf of the subject child.  
Treating child care costs separately under the guidelines, as opposed to including an average 
amount for such costs in the schedule, is justified in the commission’s view because not all 
families incur this expense and costs vary widely depending on family circumstances. Provision 
for a separate contribution therefore permits the court to tailor the child support award to those 
circumstances. 

(B) Qualifying costs 

The costs subject to noncustodial parent reimbursement must be reasonable and 
necessary for the custodial parent to maintain employment.  Amounts that are reimbursed or 
subsidized are excluded, as are amounts that exceed the level required to provide quality care 
from a licensed source.  The commission refers courts and other guidelines users to the charts on 
average Connecticut child care costs that appear on the 2-1-1 Child Care Infoline internet 
website for information on determining the reasonableness of any claimed child care costs. 

(C) Contribution amount 

The noncustodial parent’s contribution to qualifying child care costs is set generally the 
same way as unreimbursed medical expenses are apportioned – on the basis of the parents’ net 
disposable incomes.  As with the calculation of unreimbursed medical expenses, the commission 
has removed alimony paid by one parent to the other in the determination of net disposable 
income, which was previously instituted by the 2005 commission.  The commission made this 
change to simplify the calculation. The special rules for low-income obligors are retained by the 
commission. The contribution continues to be designated as a percentage unless there is a finding 
of noncompliance on a prior order in which case the court can order a dollar amount. The 
commission added the provision that a weekly dollar amount may be ordered at an initial or 
subsequent hearing if there is an agreement of the parties.   

(D) Coordination with schedule  

The revised schedule incorporates deductions for average child care costs in graduated 
fashion in accordance with the updated data provided by the consultant.  The commission has 
determined that these amounts are more reliable than the estimates on which the 2005 schedule 
adjustments were based. 

(6) §46b-56c Educational Support Orders 

Pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. §46b-56c, a court may issue an Educational Support Order 
directed to either or both parents of a child to pay for educational costs for up to a total of four 
full academic years at a post-secondary institution of higher education or a private occupational 
school for the purpose of attaining a bachelor's or other undergraduate degree, or other 
appropriate vocational instruction.  These Educational Support Orders are not orders for payment 
of private school for elementary through high school. The commission considered whether an 
Educational Support Order should affect any child support award at the time of either the 
establishment or modification of the child support award. The commission determined that the 
statutory language does not support such consideration. Therefore, the commission concluded 

 

xiv 

 

that the child support award is to be determined without consideration of an existing or future 
Educational Support Order.  

(7) Supplemental orders 

The commission found that sometimes when a support order is being set the parties have 

knowledge of anticipated future payments of an unknown amount, such as a bonus or other 
incentive based compensation such as stock options, restricted stock, or other stock rights if, and, or 
when vested or exercisable. While the expected amounts may be substantial, the indeterminate 
nature of such amounts precludes their inclusion in the gross income of the parent expected to 
receive them at the time the order enters.  In such cases, the commission has determined that the 
most practical way of considering such amounts for purposes of establishing an appropriate amount 
of support is to treat the amounts separately from the basic current support order, which is to be paid 
periodically. 

Under the approach adopted by the commission, when the order is entered, the parties agree 

or the court orders a percentage of the future amounts shall be obligated as support upon either the 
receipt of the payment (such as in the event of a bonus), or upon vesting (such as restricted stock or 
stock options).  This approach maintains the integrity of the current support calculation method, 
since it does not attempt to include indeterminate or speculative amounts in a parent’s gross income.  
It also saves the parties from returning to court to modify the support order to account for receipt of 
the payment.  

 For combined net weekly incomes of not more than $4,000, the percentage shall be 
generally consistent with the guidelines schedule; for combined net weekly incomes over $4,000, 
the order shall be determined on a case by case basis consistent with the determination of the child 
support order, as discussed above in section (e)(5). 

If the amount of the future payment is reasonably ascertainable, it should be included in 

gross income, subject to the normal current support calculation procedures, and not addressed 
under this provision. 

While the receipt of indeterminate amounts such as bonuses, or the vesting of 
indeterminate amounts such as restricted stock is always included as income for purposes of 
calculating the child support order, the commission intends that this supplemental orders 
provision shall apply in cases where the future compensation is indeterminate when the order 
enters.  The regulations still clearly provide that the primary element of a current support order is 
a specific dollar amount, which is payable periodically, such as weekly or monthly.   

 (h) Income determination 

The regulations continue to use the parents’ net income, defined as gross income minus 

allowable deductions, as a basis for calculating the child support obligation. This subsection 
describes and explains the principle changes to the gross income inclusions and exclusions, and 
the allowable deductions, included in the new guidelines. 

xv 

 

 

       

(1) Gross income  

(A) Inclusions 

Users of the guidelines should note that gross income includes all kinds of earned and 

unearned income not specifically excluded.  The list of inclusions is illustrative and not 
exhaustive. 

(i)  Overtime and additional employment  

The 2005 commission determined that inclusion of at least some parental income earned 
for hours worked in excess of 40 per week is justified by the principle that children should share 
equitably in the income of their parents. The 2005 commission found it fair and appropriate to 
prescribe some limitation on the number of hours to be included.  

The 1999 guidelines had established 52 total paid hours per week for regular, overtime, 

and additional employment as the maximum to enter into the calculation of gross income for 
child support purposes.  Subsequent to promulgation of the 1999 guidelines, however, the 
Connecticut General Assembly enacted section 32 of Public Act No. 99-279 (now codified as 
section 46b-215d of the Connecticut General Statutes), which provides that “in cases in which an 
obligor is an hourly wage earner and has worked less than forty-five hours per week at the time 
of the establishment of the support order, any additional income earned from working more than 
forty-five hours per week shall not be considered income for purposes of such guidelines.”  The 
2005 commission determined that the inconsistency of the guidelines with this legislation caused 
confusion, and made the guidelines more difficult to administer. 

The 2005 commission accordingly reduced to 45 hours the limitation on wages to be 
considered as gross income.  In conjunction with this change, the commission also adopted a 
new deviation criterion (discussed more fully in the deviation criteria subsection of this 
preamble) to address those cases in which application of the lower hourly wage limit might result 
in an inappropriate or inequitable order, in view of a parent’s earnings history and prospects. 

 

 (ii) Clarification of income inclusions 

The commission clarified that incentive based compensation is included in the definition 
of gross income to reflect more fully its intent to provide as comprehensive a list as possible of 
the types of income that should typically be considered. Examples of incentive based 
compensation are: stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, phantom stock, stock 
appreciation rights and other forms of delayed or deferred compensation.  The commission notes, 
however, that unlisted items are not thereby excluded from gross income unless they are listed as 
exclusions in the regulation.  

   Social Security dependency benefits (benefits payable to children whose parents 
receive Social Security retirement or disability benefits) continue to count as income. There has 
been some confusion as to which parent such income is attributable. This commission clarified 
that such benefits count as income to the parent on whose earning record the child qualifies. This 
item was added to reflect the Connecticut Supreme Court’s decision in Jenkins v. Jenkins, 243 
Conn. 584 (1998). 

 

xvi 

 

(iii)  Limit to inclusion of Social Security Income when recipient also receives 

Supplemental Security Income (SSI) 

The commission added language to the income inclusion and exclusion sections to 
exclude Social Security, except for $5 per week, from includible income when the parent 
receives both Social Security and SSI. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a Federal income 
program for aged, blind and disabled people with little or no income.  It helps afford basic food, 
clothing and shelter needs.  SSI is funded by general tax revenues (not Social Security taxed).  
Social Security disability is a federal insurance program for aged, blind and disabled people who 
have a sufficient work history to qualify for coverage from the Social Security fund.  Some 
people with limited work history qualify for Social Security disability benefits in an amount 
below the SSI amount.  If that is the case, they also qualify for SSI, to bring them up to the SSI 
subsistence threshold. The commission has excluded SSI from consideration as income under the 
guidelines in the past and continues to do so.  The commission is now further excluding Social 
Security disability and retirement income, except for $5 per week, from consideration in the 
income determination when the recipient also receives an SSI supplement to bring his or her 
income up to the SSI subsistence threshold. The $5 per week counts as income because this 
amount is disregarded in calculating the SSI supplement. 

(B) Exclusions 

The commission added one item to the gross income exclusions, as explained above.  
Social Security disability or Social Security retirement benefits in excess of $5 per week are 
excluded when the parent also receives Supplemental Security Income.  The commission 
considered and rejected allowing a deduction for Health Savings Accounts.  These accounts are a 
form of savings dedicated to payment of pre-tax expenditures normally paid after tax.  They are 
elective, not a condition of employment and not universally available to both parents.  

 (2) Allowable deductions 

(A) In general 

The commission continues to regard the combined net income of both parents as the 
fairest measure on which to base the child support obligation.  Since the deductions used to 
calculate net income are limited to those specifically enumerated in the regulation, the 
commission was careful to consider all potential deductions with a view toward enhancing equity 
for the parents while protecting the income base available for the support of children.  As a result 
of this review, the commission retained many allowable deductions unchanged from the 2005 
guidelines.  A summary and explanation of the commission’s actions concerning allowable 
deductions follows. 

(B) Taxes 

The commission continues unchanged, in these regulations, the allowable deductions for 

income, Social Security and Medicare taxes. Deductions for listing a child as a dependent on a 
tax return or related deductions such as the HOPE credit, should be excluded to the extent they 
actually reduce income taxes. 

 

xvii 

 

(C) Health insurance premiums 

The commission continues to support the change made by the 2005 commission in which   

  
both parents are allowed to deduct from their gross income the full amount of any health 
insurance premiums paid by them for themselves and all of their legal dependents, including the 
child whose support is being determined. The deduction includes HUSKY Plan contributions. 

(D) Other alimony and child support awards   

The commission has retained the allowable deduction for court-ordered alimony and 
child support awards from the 2005 guidelines with the following change.  The commission 
decided to limit the deduction of other court ordered alimony and child support awards in one 
situation.  If a person is seeking a downward modification, no deduction will be allowed for 
another award if, when the other award entered, the award for which modification is sought was 
taken into consideration. The commission makes this change to preserve the priority of earlier 
awards. This is the same principle that applies in the qualified child deduction.  For example, 
Order A enters and subsequently Order B enters. If when Order B enters, a deduction from 
income is allowed for pre-existing Order A, a party seeking to modify Order A downward will 
not be allowed a deduction from income for Order B.   
 

The commission continues the policy of limiting the deduction to the extent of payment 

on non-arrearage amounts. The disallowance of arrearage payments as a deduction helps to 
ensure that a child who is the subject of a subsequent support order is not deprived of an 
appropriate level of support due to a parent’s non-payment of a prior support order. 

The commission recognizes that limiting this deduction to actual payments can be 
interpreted as a failure to give full effect to an existing court order.  Such interpretation relies on 
at least two principles: one, that a valid court order should be presumed to be paid as ordered in 
deference to judicial authority; and two, that unpaid orders remain subject to enforcement and 
future collection.  The commission finds that the interest of the child in receiving an appropriate 
level of support based on the actual disposable income of the parents outweighs these concerns. 
This determination rests on the commission’s reluctance to reward a parent who neglects to pay a 
pre-existing child support obligation with a reduced obligation for the child whose support order 
is now being established.  That being said, however, the commission specifically intends that the 
downward modification remedy be available in appropriate circumstances, subject to applicable 
state law, to obligors who are faced with an inflated order because they failed to make payments 
on another pre-existing order.  

Finally, the commission considered fully but rejected amendment of this deduction to 

include alimony amounts payable to the other parent involved in the support determination and 
to limit the deduction only to ordered child support amounts that are consistent with the 
guidelines, where the actual order differs from such amount because the parties to a pre-existing 
order stipulated to an amount higher than that prescribed by the guidelines. 

(E) Imputed obligation for qualified child 

The commission continues unchanged the deduction from gross income in the amount of 
an imputed support obligation for a qualified child. A qualified child is defined as one other than 
the subject of the support determination, who resides with the parent, is dependent on the parent 
for support, and for whom the parent has not claimed a deduction for court-ordered support 

 

xviii 

 

payments. A parent may claim the deduction in the context of an initial support determination or 
when defending against a proposed modification. A parent cannot claim the deduction when 
seeking a modification of an existing child support award. 

 

(i)  Arrearage guidelines 

Section 46b-215a of the Connecticut General Statutes requires the development of 
guidelines for orders of payment on arrearages. Such guidelines are to be based on the obligor's 
ability to pay. The commission interprets the statute to apply only to the determination of 
periodic payments, and so does not address in the regulations the determination of lump sum 
payments, which determination remains subject to the discretion of the judge or family support 
magistrate.  The deviation criteria continue to apply to arrearage order determinations, as was 
clarified in the 2005 guidelines. This subsection of the preamble explains the commission's 
rationale for several aspects of the arrearage guidelines. 

(1) Simplicity 

The commission believes that the arrearage guidelines should be fairly simple to 
understand and apply, and accordingly continues to base the arrearage payment on a percentage 
of the current support order. 

(2) Percentage of current support 

The commission determined that twenty percent (20%) of the current support order 
continues to be a reasonable percentage to apply toward the reduction of accumulated child 
support arrearages in most cases.  It has accordingly retained this percentage as the general rule, 
subject to the limitation described in subdivision (4) in this subsection of the preamble. 

(3) Arrearage payment when there is no current support order 

When there is no current support order, a current support obligation is imputed for the 

child for whom the arrearage is owed, and the arrearage payment is established as a percentage 
of that imputed obligation. The applicable percentage is: 

(A) twenty percent if the child for whom the arrearage is owed if the parents have a 
present duty to provide support for the child; or 

(B) one hundred percent of an imputed support obligation for the individual for whom the 
arrearage is owed if the parents have no present duty to provide support for the individual 
because the child is deceased, emancipated, or over the age of eighteen and has 
completed twelfth grade or has attained the age of nineteen, whichever occurs first. 

The twenty percent amount was selected to be consistent with the general rule on the grounds 

that in the absence of a current support order, the obligor is either supporting the child or would 
be obligated to do so under state law.  The one hundred percent amount was selected because in 
the situations described, the obligor’s current support obligation will have ceased, so that the 
ability to repay an arrearage is enhanced, and a court has already determined that this is a sum 
that the obligor is capable of paying.  When entering or modifying the support order, it is within 
the discretion of the judge or family support magistrate to order that, upon termination of the 
current support order, 100% of the amount of the imputed current support obligation, as 
described above, shall continue to be paid wholly toward the accrued arrearage. 

 

xix 

 

(4) Limitation on amount of arrearage payment 

Basing the arrearage payment on the current support order automatically introduces a test 

of the obligor's ability to pay. Nonetheless, the commission recognizes that further protection is 
required to assist obligors in meeting their own self-support needs. It has accordingly retained in 
these regulations the provision whereby no more than 55% of an obligor's net income may be 
taken for the total of all current support and arrearage payments.  

(5) Special rule for low-income obligors 

The arrearage guidelines provide for a weekly arrearage payment for low-income 

obligors equal to the greater of ten percent (10%) of the weekly current support order, or one 
dollar ($1) per week. The lower percentage than that of the general rule is intended to assist such 
obligors in meeting their own self-support needs while at the same time conveying the important 
message of the primacy of child support obligations. 

(6) Arrearages owed to the state and a custodial parent 

The commission has retained the provision for a single arrearage payment order under 

which payments are to be distributed in accordance with federal requirements. As under the 2005 
guidelines, the order is to be payable to the custodial parent until such parent’s arrearage is 
satisfied, and then to the state. 

(7) Special treatment for obligor living with child 

The authorizing statute calls for special consideration where the obligor lives with the 

child when the arrearage order is entered. Accordingly, the commission continues the 
requirement for only a minimal weekly payment of one dollar ($1) where such obligor's gross 
income does not exceed 250% of the poverty guideline for the obligor's household size. Where 
the obligor's income exceeds this amount, the guidelines require a payment of 20% of the 
imputed support obligation. 

The commission determined that the deviation criteria are generally working well, and 

that minimal changes to the regulation were needed.  It also found, however, that some 
clarification was required, and that the addition of one new criterion was warranted. 

The commission recognizes that keeping the deviation criteria to a minimum serves the 

stated guidelines purpose of ensuring consistency and promoting settlements.  It also finds, 
however, that due regard to the best interests of the child, as well as fairness to the parents, 
requires a description of the specific circumstances in which the presumptive support amounts 
may be inappropriate or unjust.  The commission considered case data reported from the 
automated system maintained by the state’s Title IV-D child support agency in arriving at the 
regulatory amendments. 

(2) Applicability  

The prior commission added language in the introduction and throughout the section to 
clarify its intent to restrict the application of the deviation criteria to the specific circumstances 

 

xx 

 

j)  Deviation criteria 

(1) In general 

  (

stated in the lettered subparagraphs listed under the six category headings.  For example, under 
the second heading “extraordinary expenses for care and maintenance of the child,” education 
expenses, un-reimbursable health care expenses, and expenses for special needs are listed as the 
criteria for deviation.  Under the revised regulations, these three listed criteria, and no others, 
may warrant deviation under the category “extraordinary expenses for care and maintenance of 
the child.”  There may be other extraordinary expenses for care and maintenance of the child, but 
unless such expenses can be characterized fairly as falling under one of the three specific listed 
criteria, they should not be found to warrant a deviation from presumptive support amounts. 

The current commission considered feedback from the online survey to determine 
whether any additional circumstances should be added under the category headings. The 
majority of the survey feedback regarding deviation criteria related to treatment of extraordinary 
expenses. This commission considered adding extracurricular expenses to the currently listed 
criteria of education expenses, unreimbursable medical expenses, and expenses for special needs. 
The commission decided not to add extracurricular expenses as a separate section under the 
category “extraordinary expenses for care and maintenance of the child” reasoning that 
extracurricular expenses could be addressed under the criteria of best interests of the child under 
the “special circumstances” heading. 

While acknowledging that agreements of the parties to a child support determination 
should carry some weight in setting appropriate support amounts, the commission included 
language in the section introduction that is intended to ensure that the best interests of the child 
and an adherence to guidelines principles is embodied in such agreements.  The language permits 
agreements to set support amounts that deviate from the presumptive amounts, but requires that 
such agreements cite specific deviation criteria and factual bases to justify any variance. 

Finally, as noted in the discussion of the arrearage guidelines, this commission retains the 

language added at the beginning of that section of the regulations to clarify that the deviation 
criteria are intended to apply to the determination of periodic payments on child support 
arrearages.  

(3) Existing criteria 

(A) Weekly wages between 45 and 52 hours 

 This commission retains criterion related to weekly wages between 45 and 52 hours for 

applicable cases. The deviation criterion specifies when it is applicable. 

 (B) Child care expenses for a qualified child 

The commission retains a deviation criterion for the child care expenses of a qualified 

child to address the concern that the required child care contribution, as a component of the child 
support award in addition to current support, might unduly impact a parent’s ability to pay child 
care for other children living with such parent. The deviation can be used only to reduce the 
presumptive child care contribution, not current support, and it applies only if such other children 
satisfy the definition of “qualified child.”  The commission also limited the deviation to cases in 
which an initial child support award is being set or a parent is defending against a proposed 
modification of an existing child care contribution, to be consistent with the qualified child 
deduction.

(C) Extraordinary disparity in parental income 

This criterion is associated with the elimination of the white italics from the darker 
shaded area of the schedule.  The white italics in the 1999 guidelines had indicated those income 
levels at which the diminished basic obligation of a low-income obligor might be reduced even 
more by consideration of the custodial parent’s income. The commission removed the white 
italics to simplify the guidelines, in view of the small number of cases in which the custodial 
parent’s income was high enough to make a difference in the amount of the low-income 
obligor’s basic obligation. The criterion is intended to provide a vehicle for addressing the small 
number of cases affected by this change.  The commission also recognizes that there may be 
other circumstances in which application of the criterion may be warranted. 

(D) Shared physical custody 

The commission refined the shared physical custody deviation by removing references to 

“custodial” and “noncustodial” parents and substituting the designations of “lower net weekly 
income” and “higher net weekly income” parents. The commission also added a provision to 
allow deviation from the presumptive support amount when both parents have substantially equal 
income. The commission continues to reject the notion of a mathematical formula based on the 
time spent with each parent to determine support amounts in the shared physical custody context. 
Application of such a formula would tend to shift the focus away from the best interests of the 
child and more toward financial considerations, which would be inconsistent with Connecticut 
law.  A finding of shared physical custody should be made only where each parent exercises 
physical care and control of the child for periods substantially in excess of two overnights on 
alternate weekends, alternate holidays, some vacation time, and other visits of short duration, 
which may occasion an overnight stay during the week. While periods substantially in excess of 
this schedule are required for a finding of shared physical custody, the commission emphasizes 
that an equal time-sharing is not required for such finding. Courts still must determine what 
precise level of sharing is sufficient to warrant a deviation from presumptive support amounts. 
The commission continues to reject a “bright-line” definitional test as well as a formula approach 
to shared custody situations to discourage disputes over time-sharing as a means of affecting 
support amounts. The commission believes the approach continued in these regulations leaves 
sufficient room for the exercise of judicial discretion while providing a measure of predictability 
for the parties. 

(4) New Deviation Criteria 

A new deviation criterion was adopted by the commission which provides that if the total 

child support award exceeds 55% of the obligor’s net income, it may be appropriate to deviate 
downward on any components of the award other than current support to reduce the total award 
to not less than 55% of the obligor’s net income.  

The Commission for Child Support Guidelines is established under section 46b-215a of 

the Connecticut General Statutes.  The commission is charged with establishing guidelines to 
ensure the appropriateness of child support awards, and for reviewing and updating such 
guidelines every four years.  The commission consists of eleven members.  The Chief Court

k) The guidelines commission and review process 

(1) Statutory authority and membership 

  (

Administrator, the Commissioner of Social Services, the Attorney General, and the chairpersons 
and ranking members of the joint standing committee on judiciary all serve in their official 
capacities, and may select designees to serve in their place.  The Governor appoints a 
representative of the Connecticut Bar Association, a representative of legal services, a person 
who represents the financial concerns of child support obligors, and a representative of the 
Permanent Commission on the Status of Women. In addition to the voting membership, other 
representatives of various agencies and court systems and the public who are involved in the 
child support determination process participated regularly in commission meetings, and staffed 
the work of the commission.  The commission gratefully acknowledges the contributions of these 
individuals to the work of the commission. 

(2) Review process 

The commission held biweekly meetings, which were open to the public, beginning 

September, 2009.  The commission filed a schedule of meetings with the Secretary of the State, 
as required by statute, and kept detailed minutes of each meeting.  Early in its review process, the 
commission reached out in several directions in an effort to gather maximum input on possible 
changes to the guidelines. 

Commission members solicited the views of their various constituencies and reported 

back to the commission as a whole. The commission also devised an on-line survey to get 
feedback from the public on a range of issues.  There were over 700 responses from the public. 
The commission reviewed all of these responses and took them into consideration as revisions 
were made.  

The commission scheduled five public hearings around the state to receive comments 

from the public on how the guidelines affected them, and to offer the opportunity to recommend 
changes.  The public hearings were scheduled during September and October 2013.  Four were 
held during the evening, and one in the afternoon. Notice of the hearings was published in the 
Connecticut Law Journal; a flyer was posted in many locations; and the hearings were publicized 
widely in newspapers throughout the state and on various websites.  The commission received 
written comments in addition to this testimony. The commission also hired a nationally 
recognized leader in the field of child support guidelines, the Center for Policy Research to 
prepare a new Schedule of Basic Child Support Obligations based on updated economic research, 
and to modify the schedule in accordance with certain commission determinations, as described 
in earlier sections of this preamble. 

Finally, in addition to the outreach methods described above, the commission during its 
deliberations employed several more research and data-gathering techniques, including but not 
limited to: examination of the statistical records of the computerized Connecticut Child Support 
Enforcement System relating to the application of the guidelines to ensure that deviations from 
the guidelines are limited; survey of other states’ child support guideline reviews  to consider 
other possible approaches to various guidelines issues; research on specific guidelines-related 
topics; review of appellate court decisions from Connecticut and other states;  review of other 
pertinent articles, and reports; and informal consultation with members of the bar, the bench, 
state legislators, agency representatives, and interested members of the public concerning 
guidelines issues. 

Following the commission’s information gathering, deliberations, and development of 

revised regulations, including a new schedule and worksheet, the commission submitted the 

 

xxiii 

 

proposed regulatory amendments to the Office of the Attorney General for a review of legal 
sufficiency, and to the joint standing Legislative Regulation Review Committee for final 
approval, as required by section 46b-215c of the general statutes. 

l)  Effective date 

The commission selected an effective date of July 1, 2015 to provide sufficient time for 

those who are involved in the determination of child support amounts within the state to become 
familiar with the guidelines prior to their required implementation.

Section 46b-215a-2c. Child support guidelines 

(a)  Applicability 

(1)   Award components 

This  section  shall  be  used  to  determine  the  current  support,  health  care  coverage  and  child  care 
contribution components of all child support awards within the state, subject to section 46b-215a-5c 
of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. 

(2)   Income scope 

When  the  parents'  combined  net  weekly  income  exceeds  $4,000,  child  support  awards  shall  be 
determined  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  consistent  with  statutory  criteria,  including  that  which  is 

 

4 

described  in  subsection  (d)  of  section  46b-84  of  the  Connecticut  General  Statutes.    The  amount 
shown at the $4,000 net weekly income level shall be the minimum presumptive support obligation.  
The maximum presumptive support obligation shall be determined by multiplying the combined net 
weekly income by the applicable percentage shown at the $4,000 net income level. 

(b)  Using the worksheet 

The  line  references  throughout  this  section  are  to  the  worksheet  set  forth  in  section  46b-215a-6  of  the 
Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies.  Use one worksheet in most cases. When there is a third party 
custodian and either parent is a low-income obligor (as determined in subsection (c)(3)(A) of this section), 
complete a separate worksheet for each parent. Enter on the worksheet only weekly amounts, which may 
be rounded to the nearest dollar. 

(c)  Determining the amount of current support 

The procedures in this subsection shall be used, subject to subsection (d) of this section, to determine the 
current support component of the child support award. 

(1)   Order requirements 

(A)  Specific dollar amount 

(B)  Indeterminate amounts 

The  current  support  order  shall  include  a  specific  dollar  amount  of  support  as  a  primary 
element, to be payable on a recurring basis. 

The primary requirement of a specific dollar amount of current support shall not preclude the 
entry of a supplemental order, in appropriate cases, to pay a percentage of a future lump sum 
payment, such as a bonus.  Such supplemental orders shall be entered when a specific dollar 
amount  of  the  future  lump  sum  payment  has  not  been  ordered  and  such  payment  is  of  an 
indeterminate amount, subject to clauses (i) and (ii) in this subparagraph: 

(i)    for combined net weekly incomes not more than $4,000, the percentage shall be generally 

consistent with the schedule in subsection (e) of this section; 

(ii)   for combined net weekly incomes over $4000, the order shall be determined on a case 
by case basis consistent with applicable statutes. 

 (2)

(K)  Enter  the  amount  of  the  parent’s  court-ordered  alimony  and  child  support  payments  for 
individuals  not  involved  in  the  support  determination  on  line  11.    Do  not  include  arrearage 
payments in this amount. 

(L)   If the parent is entitled to a qualified child deduction in accordance with subsection (d) of this 
section, compute an imputed support obligation for the parent’s qualified child, following the 
procedures in subdivision (2) of such subsection, and enter the amount on line 12. 

(M)  Add the amounts entered on lines 2-12 for each parent and enter the sum on line 13 for each 

parent. 

(N)  Subtract each parent’s line 13 amount from the parent’s line 1 amount and enter the result on 

line 14 for each parent.  The line 14 amount for each parent is that parent’s net weekly income. 

(3)   Determine the basic child support obligation 

Follow the instructions below in the order presented to determine the basic child support obligation 
using the Schedule of Basic Child Support Obligations found in subsection (e) of this section. 

(A)  Find the block in the schedule that corresponds to the income level of the noncustodial parent 
(rounded  to  the  nearest  ten  dollars)  and  the  number  of  children  whose  support  is  being 
determined. 

(i)    If this block is in the darker shaded area of the schedule, the noncustodial parent is a low-
income obligor. The dollar amount shown in the block is the noncustodial parent's basic 
child support obligation. Enter this amount on line 16 and proceed to subdivision (4) of 
this subsection. 

(ii)   If this block is not in the darker shaded area of the schedule, the noncustodial parent is not 
a low-income obligor.  Proceed to subparagraph (B) of this subdivision to determine the 
basic child support obligation. 

(B)  Add the line 14 amounts for each parent.  The result is the combined net weekly income. Round 
this amount to the nearest ten dollars and enter on line 15.  Find the block in the schedule that 
corresponds  to  the  line  15  amount  and  the  number  of  children  whose  support  is  being 
determined. 

The dollar amount shown in this block is the basic child support obligation of both parents for 
the support of all children.  Enter this amount on line 16 and proceed to subdivision (4) of this 
subsection.

(4)   Determine each parent's share of the basic child support obligation 

Except  as  provided  in  subparagraph  (A)  of  this  subdivision,  each  parent's  share  of  the  basic  child 
support  obligation  is  determined  by  calculating  each  parent's  share  of  the  combined  net  weekly 
income, as entered on line 15, and multiplying the result for each parent by the basic child support 
obligation. 

(A)  In the case of a low-income obligor, skip line 17, enter the line 16 amount in the noncustodial 

parent's column on line 18 and proceed to subdivision (5) of this subsection. 

(B)  Determine each parent's percentage share of the combined net weekly income by dividing the 
line 14 amount for each parent by the line 15 amount and multiplying by one hundred percent. 
Enter the result (rounded to the nearest whole percentage) for each parent on line 17. 

(C)  Multiply  the line  17 amount for  each  parent  by the line  16 amount.  Enter the result for  each 

parent on line 18.  These amounts are each parent's share of the basic child support obligation. 

(5)   Adjust for Social Security benefits 

Enter  on  line  19  in  the  noncustodial  parent's  column  the  weekly  amount  of  any  Social  Security 
dependency benefits on the earnings record of such parent that are paid on behalf of the child whose 
support is being determined. 

(6)   Determine the presumptive current support amount 

The presumptive current support amount for each parent is equal to that parent’s share of the basic 
child support obligation, except where there is an adjustment for social security dependency benefits 
in accordance with subdivision (5) of this subsection. 

(A)  If there is no entry on line 19 in the noncustodial parent's column, enter each parent’s line 18 
amount,  rounded  to  the  nearest  dollar,  on  line  20  in  the  appropriate  column.    Also  enter  the 
noncustodial parent’s line 20 amount in the appropriate space on line 30. 

(B)  If there is an entry on line 19 in the noncustodial parent's column, subtract the line 19 amount 
from the noncustodial parent’s line 18 amount and enter the result, rounded to the nearest dollar, 
on line 20 in the noncustodial parent's column and in the appropriate space on line 30. Then 
enter  the  custodial  parent’s  line  18  amount,  rounded  to  the  nearest  dollar,  on  line  20  in  the 
custodial parent's column. 

(7)   Determine the recommended current support order 

Except  as  provided  in  subparagraphs  (A)  and  (B)  of  this  subdivision,  the  recommended  current 
support order shall equal the presumptive current support amount for the noncustodial parent unless a 
deviation  criterion,  as  specified  in  section  46b-215a-5c  of  the  Regulations  of  Connecticut  State 
Agencies, applies. If a deviation criterion applies, complete section VIII of the worksheet, checking 
all boxes that apply, and attach an additional sheet if necessary to explain the deviation.  Enter the 
presumptive weekly current support order on line 30. The line 20 amount for the custodial parent is 
retained  by  the  custodial  parent  and  is  presumed  spent  on  the  children.  The  presumptive  support 
amount for the custodial parent is not established as an order and is not entered on line 30. 

(A)  Split Custody 

In  a  split  custody  situation,  as  defined  in  section  46b-215a-1(24)  of  the  Regulations  of 
Connecticut  State  Agencies,  a  single  support  obligation  is calculated  by  offsetting  theoretical 
presumptive current support amounts for each parent as follows. 

 

7 

(i)    Determine the presumptive current support amount that one parent would owe to the other 
parent for the children in such other parent’s custody as if those children were the only 
children of the parties, following all applicable procedures in this subsection. 

(ii)   Determine the presumptive current support amount that one parent would owe to the other 
parent for the children in such other parent’s custody as if those children were the only 
children of the parties, following all applicable procedures in this subsection. 

(iii)  Subtract the lesser amount from the greater, as determined in clauses (i) and (ii) of this 

subparagraph. 

(iv)  The presumptive current support order shall equal the amount calculated in clause (iii) of 
this subparagraph unless a deviation criterion, as specified in section 46b-215a-5c of the 
Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, applies.  Such order shall be payable by the 
parent whose presumptive current support amount, as determined in clauses (i) and (ii) of 
this subparagraph, is greater.  If a deviation criterion applies, complete section VIII of the 
worksheet,  checking  all  boxes  that  apply,  and  attach  an  additional  sheet  if  necessary  to 
explain the deviation.  Enter the presumptive weekly current support order on line 30. 

(B)  Shared Physical Custody 

In a shared physical custody situation, as defined in section 46b-215a-1(23) of the Regulations 
of  Connecticut  State  Agencies,  the  presumptive  current  support  order  shall  equal  the 
presumptive current support amount of the parent with the higher net weekly income, payable to 
the parent with the lower net weekly income. If the shared physical custody deviation or any 
other deviation criterion applies, complete section VIII of the worksheet, checking all boxes that 
apply, and attach an additional sheet if necessary to explain the deviation. Enter the presumptive 
weekly current support order on line 30. 

(d)  Determining the amount of current support when another child resides with a parent 

(1)   Applicability 

(A)  Qualified child 

The qualified child deduction shall be allowed to determine the amount of current support only under 
the circumstances described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this subdivision. 

Either parent claims a qualified child.  A qualified child is one: 

(i)    who is currently living in the same household with the parent; 

(ii)   who is a dependent of the parent; 

(iii)  who is not a subject of the support determination; and 

(iv)  for  whom  the parent  has  not claimed a deduction under  section  46b-215a-1(1)(I) of the 

Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. 

(B)  Initial award or defense to modification 

An initial child support award is being established, or a parent is defending against a proposed 
modification of an existing child support award. 

(2)   Procedure 

When this subsection applies, determine the amount of current support by following the procedures in 
this subdivision. 

 

8 

(A)  Determine current support amount for all children 

(i)    Enter  on  line  12a  the  number  of  qualified  children  for  the  parent  claiming  a  qualified 

child. 

and enter the total on line 12b. 

qualified child deduction. 

(ii)   Add the number of children whose support is being determined to the number in line 12a 

(iii)  Add  lines  2  through  11  and  enter  that  amount  on  line  12c  for  the  parent  claiming  a 

(iv)  Subtract the line 12c amount from the line 1 amount and enter the result on line 12d for 

the parent claiming a qualified child deduction. 

(v)   Refer to the schedule to determine a single theoretical presumptive current support amount 
for the number of children consisting of the child whose support is being determined and 
the qualified child. For the purpose of this determination, deem the gross income of the 
other parent of each such child to be zero. Enter on line 12e the amount from the schedule 
based on the parent’s line 12d income and the total number of children on line 12b. 

(B)  Determine imputed support obligation for qualified child 

Divide the amount entered on line 12e by the number of children on line 12b and enter the result 
on line 12f for the claiming parent. Multiply the amount entered on line 12f by the number of 
the  claiming  parent’s  qualified  children  on  line  12a,  and  enter the  product  on  line 12  for the 
claiming parent. The line 12 amount is the imputed support obligation for the qualified child. 

(C)  Determine current support for subject child 

Continue following the remaining procedures in subsection (c) of this section to determine the 
amount  of  current  support  for  the  subject  child,  using  the  imputed  support  obligation  for  the 
qualified child as a deduction from the gross income of the claiming parent. 

(e)  Schedule of basic child support obligations 

Following is the schedule to be used for determining the basic child support obligation in accordance with 
subsection (c) of this section.  Note that all obligation money amounts have been rounded to the nearest 
dollar in this schedule.

(f)  Determining the health care coverage contribution 

Subject to section 46b-215a-5c of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, each child support award 
entered under this section  shall  include  a provision for  either  parent  or  both  parents to  contribute  to the 
health care coverage of the child in accordance with this subsection. 

(1)   Health care coverage 

The health care coverage requirement may be satisfied by an order under any or all of subparagraphs 
(A), (B) or (C) of this subdivision.  The total of the combined orders for health care coverage for the 
obligated parent shall not exceed reasonable cost as defined in sections 17b-745, 46b-84, 46b-171 and 
46b-215 of the Connecticut General Statutes. 

(A)  An order under this subparagraph shall direct either parent to name the child as a beneficiary of 
any  medical  or  dental  insurance  or  benefit  plan  carried  by  or  available  to  such  parent  at 
reasonable cost. 

(B)  If  coverage  in  accordance  with  subparagraph  (A)  is  unavailable,  an  order  under  this 
subparagraph shall direct either parent to apply for coverage on behalf of the child under any 
available  state  or  federally  funded  insurance  plan  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  HUSKY 
Plan, Part B. 

(C)  Cash Medical Support 

 

  The health care coverage requirement may include cash medical support as described in clauses 

(i) or (ii) of this subparagraph. 

(i)    An  amount  ordered  to  be  paid  toward  the  cost  of  premiums  for  health  care  insurance 

coverage provided by: (I) another parent, or (II) a public entity including HUSKY. 

(ii)   An amount ordered to be paid either directly to a medical provider or to a person obligated 
to pay a medical provider, toward any ongoing extraordinary health care expenses of the 
child that are not covered by insurance or reimbursed in any other manner, provided such 
expenses are documented and identified specifically on the record. 

(iii)  Enter the cash medical support amount on line 33a. 

(2)   Exceptions to cash medical support order 

Notwithstanding clause (i) of subparagraph (C) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, no order shall 
enter for payment of HUSKY Plan, Part A or Part B, contributions by: 

(A)  a low-income obligor or 

(3)   Payment of unreimbursed expenses 

(B) 

the custodial parent of children covered under HUSKY Plan, Part A or Part B. 

An order shall be made under this subdivision for payment of the child’s medical and dental expenses 
that are not covered by insurance or reimbursed in any other manner. Such order may be in lieu of an 
order under subdivision (1) of this subsection, or in addition to an order under such subdivision.  The 
amount of such order to be paid by each parent shall be determined in accordance with subparagraphs 
(A) to (D), inclusive, of this subdivision. 

 

18 

(A)  Calculate the custodial parent’s net disposable income, as defined in section 46b-215a-1(16) of 

the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, in the following manner: 

(i)    Add the presumptive current support order from line 30 to the custodial parent’s line 14 

amount.  Enter the sum on line 21 in the custodial parent’s column. 

(ii)   If there is an amount on line 19 in the noncustodial parent’s column, enter it on line 22. 

(iii)  Add the line 21 amount to the custodial parent’s line 22 amount and enter on line 23 in the 
custodial parent’s column.    This line 23 amount is the  custodial  parent’s  net  disposable 
income. 

(B)  Calculate the noncustodial parent’s net disposable income, as defined in section 46b-215a-1(16) 

of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, in the following manner: 

(i)    Subtract  the  presumptive  current  support  order  (line  30  amount)  from  the  noncustodial 

parent’s line 14 amount.  Enter the result on line 21 in the noncustodial parent’s column. 

(ii)   If there is an amount on line 19 in the noncustodial parent’s column, enter it on line 22. 

(iii)  Subtract the line 22 amount from the noncustodial parent’s line 21 amount and enter on 
line  23  in  the  noncustodial  parent’s  column.    This  line  23  amount  is  the  noncustodial 
parent’s net disposable income. 

(C)  Calculate each parent’s percentage share of combined net disposable income in the following 

manner: 

(i)    Enter the sum of the custodial and noncustodial parents’ line 23 amounts on line 24. This 

amount is the combined net disposable income. 

(ii)   Divide each parent’s line 23 amount by the line 24 amount, multiply each result by one 
hundred  percent,  and  enter  each  parent’s  percentage  (rounded  to  the  nearest  whole 
percentage) on line 25. 

(D)  Determine the presumptive order for unreimbursed medical expenses in the following manner: 

(i)    If  the  noncustodial parent is  a  low-income  obligor, enter  the  lesser  of:  (I) such parent’s 
percentage share from line 25, or (II) fifty percent on line 33b, for such parent; and enter 
one hundred percent minus the percentage entered for the noncustodial parent on line 33b 
for the custodial parent. 

(ii)   If  the  noncustodial  parent  is  not  a  low-income  obligor,  enter  the  percentage  share  from 

line 25 for each parent on line 33b. 

(g)  Determining the child care contribution 

(1)   General rule 

Subject to section 46b-215a-5c of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, the noncustodial 
parent  shall  be  ordered  to  pay  the  custodial  parent  a  child  care  contribution  as  part  of  each  child 
support award entered under this section. Such contribution shall be for the purpose of reimbursing 
the custodial parent for a portion of the child care costs incurred on behalf of the subject child. 

(2)   Contribution amount 

(A)  Qualifying costs 

Child care costs shall qualify for a contribution from the noncustodial parent only to the extent 
that they: 

 

19 

(i)    are reasonable, 

(ii)   are necessary to allow a parent to maintain employment, 

(iii)  are not otherwise reimbursed or subsidized, and 

(iv)  do not exceed the level required to provide quality care from a licensed source. 

(B)  Noncustodial parent’s share of qualifying costs 

Except  as  provided  in  subdivision  (3)  of  this  subsection,  the  amount  of  the  child  care 
contribution  to  be  entered  on  line  34  of  the  worksheet  shall  equal  the  amount  determined  in 
clause (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph, as follows: 

(i)    the noncustodial parent’s percentage share of combined net disposable income, as entered 
on  line  25  of  the  worksheet,  multiplied  by  the  qualifying  child  care  costs  as  they  are 
incurred, or 

(ii)  where there is an agreement of the parties at the initial or a subsequent hearing or a finding 
of  noncompliance  with  a  prior  child  care  contribution  order,  a  weekly  dollar  amount 
calculated  by  multiplying  the  noncustodial  parent’s  percentage  share  of  combined  net 
disposable  income,  as  entered  on  line  25  of  the  worksheet,  by  the  estimated  average 
qualifying child care costs. 

 

(3)   Special rules for low-income obligors 

(A)  Definition of “low-income obligor” 

For  the  purposes  of  this  subdivision  only,  the  term  “low-income  obligor”  shall  include  those 
obligors whose net disposable income (amount on line 23 of the worksheet) is within the darker 
shaded area of the schedule. 

(B)  Child care contribution limits 

(i)    If  the custodial parent’s net  disposable income  (amount  on  line  23  of the  worksheet) is 
within  the  darker  shaded  area  of  the  schedule,  the  child  care  contribution  of  the  low-
income  obligor  shall  equal the  lesser  of  the  noncustodial  parent’s  line  25  percentage  or 
fifty  percent  of  the  qualifying  child  care  costs.    Enter  the  correct  percentage,  or  the 
corresponding dollar amount in conjunction with a finding of noncompliance, on line 34 
of the worksheet. 

(ii)   If  the custodial parent’s net  disposable income  (amount  on  line  23  of the  worksheet) is 
outside  the  darker  shaded  area  of  the  schedule,  the  child  care  contribution  of  the  low-
income obligor, to be entered on line 34 of the worksheet, shall equal: 

(I)  

twenty percent of the qualifying child care costs, in lieu of the amount provided in 
subdivision (2)(B)(i) of this subsection; or 

(II)   where  there  is  a  finding  of  noncompliance  with  a  prior  child  care  contribution,  a 
weekly  dollar  amount equal  to  twenty  percent  of  the estimated average  qualifying 
child  care  costs,  in  lieu  of  the  amount  provided  in  subdivision  (2)(B)(ii)  of  this 
subsection.

46b-215a-3a. Arrearage guidelines 

(a)  Scope of section 

This section shall be used to determine periodic payments on child support arrearages, subject to section 
46b-215a-5c of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies.  The determination of lump sum payments 
remains subject to the discretion of the judge or family support magistrate, in accordance with existing law.

(A)  twenty percent of the weekly current support order, or 

(B)  fifty-five  percent  of  the  obligor's  net  income,  reduced  by  the  amount  of  the  current  support 

(2)   In a Title IV-D case where arrearages are owing to both the state and a custodial parent, one payment 
order shall enter under which payments shall be distributed in accordance with Title IV-D distribution 
requirements.    Such  order  shall  be  payable  to  the  custodial  parent  until  the  custodial  parent’s 
arrearage is satisfied, and then to the state. 

(c)  Special rule for low-income obligors 

Subject to subsection (e)(1) of this section, the weekly arrearage payment of a low-income obligor shall 
equal the greater of: 

(1)  

ten percent of the weekly current support order, or 

(2)   one dollar per week. 

(d)  Special rule if there is no current support order 

Subject to subsection (e)(1) of this section, the weekly arrearage payment when there is no current support 
order in effect for any child of the parties shall equal: 

(1)  

twenty percent of an imputed support obligation for the child for whom the arrearage is owed if the 
parents have a present duty to provide support for the child, or 

(2)   one hundred percent of an imputed support obligation for the individual for whom the arrearage is 

owed if the parents have no present duty to provide support for the individual. 

(e)  Special rule for child living with the obligor 

(1)   Applicability 

This subsection applies when the child for whom the arrearage is owed is living with the obligor.  If 
this  subsection  applies,  subsections  (c)  and  (d)  of  this  section  shall  not  be  used  to  determine  the 
arrearage  payment.    For  the  purposes  of  this  subsection,  a  child  is  deemed  to  be  living  with  the 
obligor if the circumstances in either subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of this subdivision are 
found. 

(A)  The obligor is the child's legal guardian and is currently living in the same household with such 

(B)  The obligor is not the child's legal guardian, but the child has lived in the same household with 

child. 

the obligor for at least: 

(i)   

the six months immediately preceding the determination of the arrearage payment, or 

 

21 

(ii)   six of the twelve months immediately preceding such determination. 

(2)   Special rule 

When this subsection applies, the weekly arrearage payment shall be: 

(A)  one  dollar  per  week  if  the  obligor's  gross  income  is  less  than  or  equal  to  two  hundred  fifty 
percent of the poverty guideline for the obligor's household size, as published annually in the 
Federal Register by the Department of Health and Human Services; or 

(B) 

twenty percent of the imputed support obligation for such child if the obligor's gross income is 
greater than two hundred fifty percent of the poverty guideline for the obligor's household size, 
as  published  annually  in  the  Federal  Register  by  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human 
Services. 

(f)  Use of the worksheet in arrearage determinations 

Line  references  throughout  this  subsection  are  to  the  worksheet  included  in  section  46b-215a-6  of  the 
Regulations  of  Connecticut  State  Agencies,  which  worksheet  is  intended  for  use  with  the  following 
instructions. 

(1)   Determine the total arrearage 

Add  all  amounts  described in subparagraphs  (A), (B)  and  (C)  of this subdivision to  determine  the 
total arrearage to be paid for past support of the subject child.  Enter the sum on line 32, indicating 
separately,  if  applicable,  amounts  due  to  the  state  and  amounts  due  to  the  family.    Amounts 
comprising the total arrearage are: 

(A)  the total of all delinquent amounts that have become due and payable under a current support 

order, but which have not been reduced to a judgment or an arrearage finding; 

(B) 

(C) 

the  total  of  all  unpaid  support  amounts  that  have  been  reduced  previously  to  a  judgment  or 
arrearage finding; and 

the total of all support amounts due for periods prior to the initial determination of a support 
order. 

(2)   Determine the arrearage payment 

Enter on line 29 either twenty percent of the line 30 amount or, if applicable, the amount determined 
in one of subparagraphs (A) to (D), inclusive, of this subdivision (corresponding to paragraphs A to 
D,  inclusive,  in  section  VI  of  the  worksheet).    The  line  29  amount  is  the  presumptive  arrearage 
payment.  Enter this amount on line 31 unless a deviation criterion applies. If the amount entered on 
line 31 differs from the line 29 amount, complete section VIII of the worksheet. 

(A)  If the noncustodial parent is a low-income obligor, enter on line 29 the greater of ten percent of 

the line 30 amount or $1 per week, unless subparagraph (B) of this subdivision applies. 

(B)  If the child is living with the obligor, enter on line 29 either: (i) $1 per week if the obligor’s 
gross income is less than or equal to two hundred fifty percent of poverty level for the obligor's 
household  size,  or  (ii)  twenty  percent  of  an  imputed  support  obligation  for  the  child  if  the 
obligor’s  gross  income  is  greater  than  two  hundred  fifty  percent  of  poverty  level  for  the 
obligor's household size. 

(C)  If  there  is  no current  support  order  and  subparagraph  (B)  of  this  subdivision  does  not  apply, 
enter on line 29 either: (i) twenty percent of an imputed support obligation if the parents have a 
present duty to provide support for the child, or (ii) one hundred percent of an imputed support 
obligation if the parents have no present duty to provide support for the individual. 

 

22 

(D)  If  subparagraphs  (A)  to  (C),  inclusive,  of  this  subdivision  do  not  apply  and  the  sum  of  the 
current  support  and  arrearage  payments  would  exceed  fifty-five  percent  of  the  noncustodial 
parent’s  line  14  amount,  enter  fifty-five  percent  of  the  noncustodial  parent’s  line  14  amount, 
minus the line 30 amount, on line 29. 

Section 46b-215a-4b.  Total presumptive child support award as a percentage of the obligor’s net 
income 

This  section  shall  be  used  to  determine  if  the  total  presumptive  child  support  award  as  calculated  in 
accordance  with  sections  46b-215a-1  to  46b-215a-3a,  inclusive,  of  the  Regulations  of  Connecticut  State 
Agencies exceeds fifty-five percent of the obligor’s net weekly income. 

(1)  Enter the amounts from lines 30, 31, 33a, 34a and 34b in the Total Child Support Award Calculation 

box in section VII of the worksheet. 

(2)  Add those amounts to determine the total presumptive child support award and enter that sum where 

indicated in the box and also on line 35a. 

(3)  Divide line 35a by the obligor’s line 14 amount and then multiply by 100 to determine the percentage 
of  the  obligor’s  net  income  obligated  for  the  total  presumptive  child  support  award.  Enter  the 
percentage on line 35b. This percentage is used to determine the applicability of the deviation criterion 
in subdivision (6)(C) of subsection (b) of section 46b-215a-5c of the Regulations of Connecticut State 
Agencies. 

Section 46b-215a-5c.  Deviation criteria 

(a) 

Introduction 

The  current  support,  health  care  coverage  contribution,  and  child  care  contribution  amounts  calculated 
under  section  46b-215a-2c  of  the  Regulations  of  Connecticut  State  Agencies,  and  the  amount  of  the 
arrearage payment calculated under section 46b-215a-3a of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, 
are presumed to be the correct amounts to be ordered.  The presumption regarding each such amount may 
be rebutted by a specific finding on the record that such amount would be inequitable or inappropriate in a 
particular case.  An agreement of the parties may be sufficient to rebut the presumption when such finding 
cites one or more deviation criteria, which may include other equitable factors, to support such agreement.  
Any such finding shall state the amount that would have been required under such sections and include a 
factual finding to justify the variance.  Only the deviation criteria stated in the lettered subparagraphs of 
subdivisions  (1)  to  (6),  inclusive,  of  subsection  (b)  of  this  section,  and  indicated  by  the  check  boxes  in 
section VIII of the worksheet, shall establish sufficient bases for such findings. 

(b)  Criteria for deviation from presumptive support amounts 

(1)   Other financial resources available to a parent 

In  some  cases,  a parent  may  have financial  resources that are not included  in the definition of  net 
income, but could be used by such parent for the benefit of the child or for meeting the needs of the 
parent.  The  resources  that  may  justify  a  deviation  from  presumptive  support  amounts  under  this 
subdivision are limited to the following: 

(A)  substantial assets, including both income-producing and non-income-producing property; 

(B) 

the parent's earning capacity; 

(C)  parental support being provided to a minor obligor; 

 

23 

(D)  the regularly recurring contributions or gifts of a spouse or domestic partner, but only if it is 
found  that  the  parent  has  reduced  his  or  her  income  or  has  experienced  an  extraordinary 
reduction of his or her living expenses as a direct result of such contributions or gifts; and 

(E)   hourly wages for regular, overtime and additional employment in excess of 45 total paid hours 

per week, but not to exceed 52 total paid hours per week, provided: 

(i)   

the parent has earned such wages on a regular and consistent basis, and the opportunity to 
earn such wages is reasonably expected to continue on a regular and consistent basis in the 
foreseeable future; 

(ii)   considering such wages as income available for the support determination is in the best 
interests  of  the  child,  including  but  not  limited  to  parenting  time,  under  the  totality  of 
circumstances; and 

(iii)  such wages shall not be considered income for order modification purposes if the parent is 
an obligor who is an hourly wage earner and who worked 45 hours per week or less at the 
time of the establishment of the support order. 

(2)   Extraordinary expenses for care and maintenance of the child 

In some cases, a parent may be incurring extraordinary expenses that are essential for the proper care 
and maintenance of the child whose support is being determined.  Only the following expenses, when 
found to be extraordinary and to exist on a substantial and continuing basis, may justify a deviation 
from presumptive support amounts under this subdivision: 

(A)  education expenses, 

(B)  unreimbursable medical expenses, and 

(C)  expenses for special needs. 

(3)   Extraordinary parental expenses 

In  some  cases,  a  parent  may  incur  extraordinary  expenses  that  are  not  considered  allowable 
deductions  from  gross  income,  but  which  are  necessary  for  the  parent  to  maintain  a  satisfactory 
parental relationship with the child, continue employment, or provide for the parent's own medical 
needs.  Only the following expenses, when found to be extraordinary and to exist on a substantial and 
continuing basis, may justify a deviation from presumptive support amounts under this subdivision: 

(A)  significant visitation expenses, 

(B) 

job-related  unreimbursable  employment  expenses  of  individuals  who  are  not  self-employed, 
and 

(C)  unreimbursable medical and disability-related expenses. 

(4)   Needs of a parent's other dependents 

In some cases, a parent may be legally responsible for the support of individuals other than the child 
whose  support  is  being  determined.    Only  the  following  factors  may  justify  a  deviation  from 
presumptive support amounts under this subdivision: 

(A)  resources  available  to  a  qualified  child  for  whom  a  deduction  was  taken  under  section 

46b-215a-2c(d) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies; 

(B)  child care expenses for a parent’s qualified child, as defined in section 46b-215a-2c(d)(1)(A) of 
the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, provided such expenses may be used to deviate 
only from the presumptive child care contribution component of the child support award, and 

 

24 

only when an initial child support award is being established or such parent is defending against 
a proposed modification of an existing child care contribution; 

(C)  verified  support  payments  made  by  a  parent  for  his  or  her  dependent  child  not  residing  with 

such parent; and 

(D)  the significant and essential needs of a spouse, provided 

(i)    such needs may be used as a possible defense against an increase in the support order, but 

not as a reason for decreasing such order, and 

(ii)  

the income, assets, and earning capacity of such spouse shall be considered in determining 
whether to deviate. 

(5)   Coordination of total family support 

In some cases, child support is considered in conjunction with a determination of total family support, 
property  settlement,  and  tax  implications.  When  such  considerations  will  not  result  in  a  lesser 
economic benefit to the child, it may be appropriate to deviate from presumptive support amounts for 
the following reasons only: 

(A)  division of assets and liabilities, 

(B)  provision of alimony, and 

(C) 

tax planning considerations. 

(6)   Special circumstances 

In some cases, there may be special circumstances not otherwise addressed in this section in which 
deviation  from  presumptive  support  amounts  may  be  warranted  for  reasons  of  equity.    Such 
circumstances are limited to the following: 

(A)  Shared physical custody. 

When  a  shared  physical  custody  arrangement  exists,  it  may  be  appropriate  to  deviate  from 
presumptive support amounts when: 

(i)  such arrangement substantially: 

(I)      reduces expenses for the child, for the parent with the lower net weekly income, 

or 

income; and 

(II) 

increases  expenses  for  the  child,  for  the  parent  with  the  higher  net  weekly 

(ii)   sufficient funds remain for the parent receiving support to meet the needs of the child after 

deviation; or 

(iii)  both parents have substantially equal income. 

(B)  Extraordinary disparity in parental income. 

When the custodial parent has high income, resulting in an extraordinary disparity between the 
parents’ net incomes, it may be appropriate to deviate from presumptive support amounts if: 

(i)    such  deviation  would  enhance  the  lower  income  parent’s  ability  to  foster  a  relationship 

(ii)   sufficient  funds  remain  for  the  parent  receiving  support  to  meet  the  basic  needs  of  the 

with the child; and 

child after deviation. 

 

25 

(C) 

Total child support award exceeds 55% of obligor’s net income. 
 

If the total child support award exceeds 55% of the obligor’s net income, it may be appropriate 
to deviate downward on any components of the award other than current support to reduce the 
total award to not less than 55% of the obligor’s net income.  

(D)  Best interests of the child. 

(E)   Other equitable factors.
