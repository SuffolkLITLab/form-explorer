ELECTRONIC FILING AND SERVICE 
 

a.  Definitions. 

1.  “Digital signature” and “electronic signature” are defined in RCW 19.34.020. 
2.  “Electronic Filing” is the electronic transmission of information to a court or 

clerk for case processing. 

3.  “Electronic Document” is an electronic version of information traditionally filed 
in paper form, except for documents filed by facsimile which are addressed in 
GR 17.  An electronic document has the same legal effect as a paper document. 
4.  “Filer” is the person whose user ID and password are used to file an electronic 

document. 

5.  “OCourt” is an electronic scheduling forms program that integrates with JIS and 
allows for the electronic filing of court documents into local digital document 
storage systems.  
 

b. Electronic filing authorization, exception, service, and technology equipment. 
1.  While JIS remains the official depository of case information, the court uses 
OCourt in conjunction with Microsoft Live as a means to facilitate electronic 
filing of documents and data.  Attorneys and other involved parties may set up 
password protected accounts in Microsoft Live and that will allow for the 
transmission of data and documents to the court and to the parties as provided in 
(b)(2).  Permission to access the program is given based upon the profile of the 
user and such permission is restricted to cases in which the user is involved.  The 
court determines the level of security allowed by the user.  The court may choose 
to update data in OCourt from other sources to maintain consistency with JIS 
data, but it is the primary responsibility of the account holder to keep all personal 
contact data in the Microsoft Live account updated and accurate. 

2.  Attorneys with OCourt accounts will receive all documents from the court in 
electronic format through their email accounts.  The court, as a convenience, 
may send reminder notifications of court dates, but failure to receive such a 
notification shall not relieve the recipient of the obligation to appear or respond 
as required.  It is the responsibility of all parties to maintain a current electronic 
mailbox address and memory sufficient to receive electronic transmissions or 
notifications from the court. 

3.  The court will not deny paper filings, but strongly encourages the creation of 

accounts within OCourt pursuant to (b)(1) and (b)(2). 

4.  The clerk will accept for filing an electronic document that complies with the 

court rules and Electronic Filing Technical Standards as adopted by the Judicial 
Information System committee to implement electronic filing. 

5.  A document that is required by law to be filed in non-electronic media may not 

be electronically filed.   

6.  Electronic Transmission from the Court.  The court or clerk may electronically 
transmit notices, orders, or other documents to all attorneys and to parties who 
have filed electronically or have agreed to accept electronic documents from the 
court, and who have provided the clerk the address of the party’s electronic 
mailbox.  It is the responsibility of all attorneys and the filing or agreeing party 

 

 

 

to maintain an electronic mailbox sufficient to receive electronic transmissions of 
notices, orders, and other documents. 

7.  Service of documents on attorneys for parties of record may be completed 

electronically.  The court will accept paper filing and/or service upon a showing 
of good cause. 
 

c.   Time of Filing, Confirmation, and Rejection. 

1.   An electronic document is filed when it is received by the clerk’s designated 

computer during the clerk’s business hours; otherwise the document is 
considered filed at the beginning of the next business day. 

2.  Confirmation of receipt of an electronic document shall be issued to the filing 

3.  The clerk will reject a document that fails to comply with applicable electronic 
filing requirements.  The clerk must notify the filing party of the rejection and 
the reason.  

d.  Authentication of Electronic Documents. 

party.   

  

1.  Procedures 

A.  A person filing an electronic document must have received a user ID and 
password from a Court Administrator or a person delegated by the Court 
Administrator for any court that utilizes the OCourt programs in order to 
use the applicable electronic filing service. 

B.  All electronic documents must be filed by using the user ID and password 

of the filer. 

C.  A filer is responsible for all documents filed with his or her user ID and 
password.  No one shall use the filer’s user ID and password without the 
express authorization of the filer.  Any person other than the filer must 
affix their name to the filing.   

2.  Signatures

warrants with a digital signature as defined in GR 30 in one of the 
following formats:

RMCLR 7.3 
RECALL OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE NO CONTACT ORDERS 
 

The court shall follow the provisions of CrRLJ 7.3 on Recall of Domestic Violence No 

he calendar is conducted on a walk-in basis.  The alleged victim may come to the court 

on any Thursday morning and petition the court for a hearing. 
 

Upon arrival the alleged victim is provided with a form that memorializes their request 

to have the order recalled. Once the form is completed the alleged victim is directed into the 
court-room. The clerk prepares a calendar along with a standardized form/order for the judge’s 
decision. Once the documents are prepared the judge evaluates the request in chambers and 
makes a decision whether to grant or deny the motion. The judge then goes into court and on the 
record informs the petitioner of his or her decision. 

t the start of the calendar the judge informs the petitioner of the following: 
         There are three requirements for the judge to recall a no-contact order: 
 

1.  There must be a written motion. Since the alleged victim is not a party to the action, the 
motion is the mechanism to get on the calendar. The petitioner is informed that the 
judge does not read the motion as it may contain facts of the case before the court and 
since the petitioner is a potential witness it would not be appropriate for the judge to 
read if the case is in a pre-trial status. 

2.  The judge reviews the defendant’s case history to determine whether there have been 
any allegations of a violation of the order or acts of violence since the order was 
entered. The judge also considers the defendant’s criminal history as a whole to 
determine whether based on that history the judge has concerns that if the order were to 
be recalled there is a potential for a breach of the peace or violence against the 
petitioner.          

3.  Two weeks must have elapsed since the entry of the order was entered. 

A petitioner is also informed that the judge’s decision is final and that the judge will not 

entertain any discussion regarding the case.  
 

Before the order is recalled the petitioner is asked by the court on the record whether

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
