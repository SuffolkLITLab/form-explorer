LAND AND REGISTRATION ACT PETITIONS (RCW 65.12) 

a) Any application for Land Registration under RCW 65.12 shall contain the following notice in the 
heading: 
 
 

LAND REGISTRATION ACT APPLICATION.  CLERK’S ACTION REQUIRED 

(b) On the occasion of a Land Registration Act under RCW 65.12 being filed with the clerk, the clerk will 
forward said application and accompanying documents to the Presiding Judge.  The Presiding Judge will 
review said documents to ensure that they are complete and in compliance with RCW 65.12.  If they are 
complete and in compliance, the court shall so note on the application and return them to the Clerk for 
further processing. 

 

 

 

 

(c)No bond shall be required of the county auditor with respect to his or her performance of duties as 
registrar of titles provided that said auditor is insured against errors and omissions in connection with 
performance of his or her duties as auditor/registrar of titles in a sum no less than one hundred thousand 
dollars.  In the event the county auditor is not so insured, then, in that event, the county auditor must 
obtain a bond in a sum no less than one hundred thousand dollars conditioned for the faithful discharge of 
those duties identified in RCW 65.12.055. 

(d) Upon determining that an application for Land Registration forwarded to the Presiding Judge is 
complete and in compliance with RCW 65.12, the Presiding Judge will appoint an Examiner of Titles as 
required by RCW 65.12.090.  The Examiner of Titles shall be appointed with reference to the specific 
case for which the Presiding Judge has appointed the examiner.  In appointing said examiner, the 
Presiding Judge shall take into consideration the apparent complexity of the condition of title as revealed 
by the abstract of title filed with the petition as required by RCW 65.12.085.  No bond shall be required of 
the examiner appointee provided said examiner is insured against malpractice in connection with the 
performance of duties required as examiner of titles in a sum no less than five hundred thousand dollars.  
In the event the examiner appointee is not so insured, he or she must obtain a bond in a sum no less than 
five hundred thousand dollars conditioned on faithful performance of his or her duties as Examiner of 
Titles.  The examiner appointee shall provide proof of such insurance or a copy of said bond prior to 
commencing his or her duties under the appointment provided for herein. 

(e) The costs and compensation of the Examiner of Titles shall be borne by the applicant for land 
registration.  Upon appointment, the examiner appointee shall estimate the anticipated costs and 
compensation in connection with his or her duties herein based upon an estimate of hours to complete 
the Examination and the hourly compensation of attorneys of the examiner appointee’s level of 
experience commonly charged in Skagit County.  After review and approval by the Presiding Judge, the 
Court Administrator shall advise the applicant to deposit the estimated amount of anticipated costs and 
compensation into the registry of the court.  The Examiner shall not be required to commence his or her 
duties as examiner until he or she is notified by the administrator that said funds have been so deposited.  
The disbursement of said funds to the Examiner shall be made from time to time upon request of the 
Examiner of Titles, provided that the applicant shall receive notice of the requested disbursement no less 
than ten days prior to approval by the Presiding Judge.  In the event the applicant makes timely objection 
to the requested disbursement, the Presiding Judge shall promptly convene a hearing with notice to both 
the applicant and the Examiner to determine whether a disbursement in a sum determined by the court 
should be ordered. 

(f) Entry of Judgments by default may be granted in the manner specified in RCW 65.12.155.  If any 
named defendant responds to the summons, then any party may bring a motion before the civil motions 
judge for hearing pursuant to RCW 65.12.160. Said motions shall be scheduled on the Court’s summary 
judgment calendar.  If, in the determination of the civil motions judge, the matter should be set for a trial 

17 

  (

 

or evidentiary hearing, the civil motions judge shall set the matter to an available date on the Court’s trial 
calendar. 

(g) The Examiner of Title shall not serve as a referee as permitted under RCW 65.12.160.  The 
Examiner’s duties shall be complete and his or her automatic discharge shall occur upon the happening 
of any one of the following events:  1.)  Applicant’s failure to deposit the Examiner’s anticipated costs and 
compensation into the registry of the court within thirty days of notice to deposit same; 2) Applicant’s 
failure to notify the court of applicant’s decision to proceed further or withdraw his or her application within 
thirty days of notice of the filing of the Examiner’s report as provided in RCW 65.12.110; 3.) The court’s 
entry of a decree of registration. 

 

 

(h) The Examiner of Titles shall submit his or her final request for reimbursement of costs or 
compensation within sixty days of his or her discharge.  If the funds deposited in the registry of court are 
inadequate to fully pay the Examiner’s approved costs and compensation, the applicant shall deposit 
enough funds to make up the shortfall into the registry of the court.  If any of the funds deposited into the 
registry of the court to pay the Examiner of Title’s costs and compensation remain in the court registry 
after satisfying the Examiner’s final request for reimbursement, said funds shall be refunded to the 
applicant.

then select a Judge for pre-assignment.  A letter will then notify counsel that all pretrial motions should 
be heard by the assigned judge and should be scheduled through Court Administration.  This is to 
assure that the assigned judge is on the appropriate calendar, or if a special set is necessary.  If both 
sides do not agree to a pre-assignment, the matter can be brought on the regular Civil Motions 
calendar. [Amended March 1, 2013; amended June 1, 2013] 

c) Pre-Trial Conference. 

  (

(1) In General. At the time of trial assignment, a pre-trial conference will also be scheduled by Court 
Administration. Failure to appear at the pre-trial conference will result in the trial date being stricken.

other relief deemed appropriate by the Court.  The parties may appear in-person or remotely for the 
pre-trial conference.   

(1)  Pre-Trial Conference Summary. At least one court day before the pre-trial conference, the parties 
must complete and submit the Pretrial Conference Summary form located in the Forms section

other bench trials, EXCEPT unlawful detainers, shall be confirmed by noon two court days before the 
scheduled  trial  date.   Counsel  shall  confirm  trials  by  calling  the  Superior  Court  Administrator’s  Office, 
(360)  416-1200.   If  a  trial  is  not  confirmed  in  accordance  with  this  rule,  the  trial  will  be  stricken. 
[Amended September 1, 2015; amended September 1, 2016] 
 

(e) Continuances and Settlement.  Attorneys shall immediately notify the Court Administrator if a trial 
has settled or has been continued and submit an agreed proposed order to ex parte striking both the pre-
trial conference and trial date.   

(f) Submission of Exhibits, Motions in Limine, Trial Briefs, Depositions, and Proposed Final 
Orders. 

(1)  Deadline. The parties shall provide their exhibits, as detailed in (2), motions in limine, trial briefs,

(2)  Exhibits.  The parties shall provide two sets of all exhibits (one set of originals and one set of 

bench copies) in two separate notebooks, packets, or binders. The Court recognizes that exhibits 
used in rebuttal or for impeachment purposes may be supplemented during trial. In such event, 
working copies for the Court and the opposing parties shall be made available as practicable.  

(3)  Numbering. The exhibits should be numbered by either tabs or in the upper right hand corner and 
organized in numerical order. Plaintiff or petitioner’s exhibits shall be numbered 1-100. Defendant 
or respondent’s exhibits shall be numbered 101 - 199. In cases with more than two parties or with 
more voluminous exhibits, the parties shall either work together on numbering of their proposed 
exhibits or receive such direction from the Court at the Pre-Trial Conference.  

  (

(4)  Remote Parties or Witnesses. In cases where one or more parties will appear remotely for trial, 
the original set of exhibits shall be accompanied by a completed Exhibit Notebook Certification 
form located in the Forms section on the Superior Court website.  All copies of the exhibits shall 
be accompanied by a copy of the Exhibit Notebook Certification. Where one or more witnesses 
will appear remotely, exhibits that witness may be expected to refer to during questioning shall be 
provided by noon the day before each witness’s testimony to that witness.  Exceptions may be 
made for exhibits used in rebuttal or for impeachment of that witness, in which case screen 
sharing or other arrangements may be used to display the exhibits in question to the witness with 
leave of the Court. 

3) Exhibits. When a documentary exhibit is used at trial during witness examination counsel shall 
provide extra copies of the exhibit to opposing counsel and the court in accordance with SCLCR 
40(f). 

(4) Remote Testimony. Witnesses may only testify remotely with prior permission of the Court and 
with clear audio and video connections. They must label themselves by their legal name when 
connecting remotely and remain in the virtual waiting room until it is their turn to provide testimony.  

(5) Presence at Trial Prior to Testimony. Absent pre-approval of the Court, any non-party witnesses, 
regardless of whether appearing remotely or in-person, may not observe the trial until their testimony 
is complete and they are released from subpoena.

PART IV.  LOCAL CIVIL ARBITRATION RULES 
(Cite as SCLCAR) 

.  SCOPE AND PURPOSE OF RULES 

.1 

PURPOSE AND APPLICATION 

These local rules, to be cited as Local Civil Arbitration Rules (SCLCAR) are for the purpose of 
implementing RCW 7.06 and supplementing  Superior Court  Civil  Arbitration Rules adopted by 
the Supreme Court.  The Local Civil Arbitration Rules as supplemented by these local rules are 
not designed to address every question which may arise during the arbitration process, and the 
rules give considerable discretion to the arbitrator.  The arbitrator should not hesitate to exercise 
that discretion.  Arbitration proceedings should be informal and expeditious, consistent with the 
purpose of relevant statutes and rules. [Amended September 1, 2020] 

.2 

MATTERS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION 

Any civil action filed in the Skagit County Superior Court, other than an appeal from a Court of 
Limited  Jurisdiction,  is  subject  to  mandatory  arbitration  if  the  sole  relief  sought  is  a  money 
judgment in  which  no party  asserts  a claim in excess of $100,000, exclusive of attorney fees, 
interest and costs, or in  which  all parties for purposes of arbitration  waive claims in  excess of 
$100,000, exclusive of attorneys’ fees, interests and costs.  Additionally, parties may stipulate to 
the arbitration of any matter in controversy not subject to mandatory arbitration. 

Adopted December 12, 1990, Amended September 1, 2018] 

.   TRANSFER TO ARBITRATION AND ASSIGNMENT OF ARBITRATOR 

.1 

TRANSFER TO ARBITRATION 

a) Time of Transfer 

In  every  civil  case,  when  any  party  has  determined  that  the  case  is  ready  for  trial  and  that  the 
case is subject to arbitration, either mandatory or by stipulation, such party shall file with the Clerk 
a Note for Motion Docket, pay associated filing fee,  and file a Demand for Arbitration setting the 
matter on the Motion Calendar not earlier than nine days from the date such demand is filed. 

Amended  September, 2007] 

b) Order Transferring Cause to Arbitration. Cases shall be transferred to arbitration only by Court  
Order.  Such order may be secured: 
 

 

(1) At the hearing scheduled pursuant to 2.1(a) above. 

(2) By stipulation and order agreed to by all parties. 

c) Response to Demand for Arbitration. Any party disagreeing with a Demand for Arbitration shall 
serve and file a response to demand for arbitration not less than two (2) working days prior to the date the 
demand is noted for hearing.  In the absence of such response, the Demand for Arbitration shall be 
granted, and an order presented transferring the cause to arbitration.  Responses asserting that the 
cause is not subject to arbitration shall be heard on the date noted for hearing of the Demand for 
Arbitration.

ASSIGNMENT OF ARBITRATOR 

a) Generally; Stipulations 

arties may stipulate to appointment of any person, including non-attorneys, as arbitrator.  Such  

stipulation shall be filed at or before the hearing on the demand for arbitration, or, in case of a stipulated  
order for arbitration, with said stipulated order.  In the absence of a stipulated choice of arbitrator, a list of  
five arbitrators shall be submitted to the parties by the Director of Arbitration in cases involving two  
parties.  In cases involving more than two parties, two additional names shall be submitted for each  
additional party involved in the cause. 

ithin seven (7) days thereafter each party shall nominate one or two arbitrators, and shall strike one or  

two arbitrators on the list.  The Director of Arbitration shall appoint an arbitrator from among those  
nominated by all parties, or, if no one has been nominated by all parties, from among those not stricken  
by any party.  Any party unwilling to submit their cause to the arbitrator so designated must file, within five  
(5) days of the appointment by the Director, a request for an appointment by the Court.  Said request  
shall be filed with the Director and acted upon by the Court without further hearing.

PART V.  LOCAL SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS RULES 
(Cite as SCLSPR) 

4.04.1 PARENTING SEMINARS 

a) Applicable Cases. This rule shall apply to all cases filed after September 1, 2001 under Chapter 
26.09, Ch. 26.10, or Ch. 26.26 RCW which require a parenting plan for minor children; including 
dissolutions, legal separations, major modifications, paternity actions in which paternity has been 
established, and non-parental custody actions 

b)  Mandatory Attendance.  In all cases governed by this rule, all parties shall complete an 
approved parenting seminar.  Standards for parenting seminars shall be established by the Court   
and providers shall be approved by the Court. An approved list of providers will be available  
through Court Administration. [Amended September 1, 2011] 

c) Timing.  Parties required by this rule to participate in a parenting seminar shall complete an approved 
parenting seminar within 90 days after service of the petition or motion initiating the action which is 
subject to this rule.  In the case of paternity actions initiated by the prosecuting attorney’s office, the 
parenting seminar shall be required only when paternity is established or acknowledged and a parenting 
plan is requested. 

d) Fees. Each party attending a seminar shall pay a fee charged by the approved provider and 
sanctioned by the court.  The court may waive the fee for indigent parties. 

e) Special Consideration/Waiver. 

(1)  In no case shall opposing parties be required to attend a seminar together. 

(2)  Upon  a  showing  of  domestic  violence  or  abuse  which  would  not  require  mutual  decision-
making, pursuant to RCW 26.09.191, or that a parent’s attendance at a seminar is not in the 
children’s best interest, pursuant to Ch. 26.12 RCW, the Court shall either: 

 

 

 

(A) waive the requirement of completion of the seminar; or 

(B) allow participation in an alternative voluntary parenting seminar for battered spouses. 

(3)  The Court may waive the seminar requirement for good cause shown.

f) Failure to Comply.  Willful refusal to participate in a parenting seminar or willful delay in completion of 
a parenting seminar by any party may constitute contempt of court and result in sanctions, including, but 
not limited to, imposition of monetary terms, striking of pleadings, or denial of affirmative relief to a party 
not in compliance with this rule.  Non-participation, or default, by one party does not excuse participation 
by the other party.  Agreement of the parties to enter agreed final orders does not excuse participation by 
either party. 

Effective September 1, 2001; amended September 1, 2009; Amended September 1, 2021] 

4.04.2  FILINGS IN FAMILY LAW CASES 

a) Application of Rule. This rule shall apply to all cases filed after September 1, 2003: 

(1)  All  family  law  petitions  seeking  dissolution  of  marriage,  legal  separation,  or  declaration  of 

invalidity; 

(2)  Actions  brought  by  parties  to  non-marital  personal  relationships  involving  parenting  or 

distribution of assets/liabilities; and 

(3)  Actions to modify previously-entered parenting plan or child support final orders. 

b)  Court’s  Automatic  Temporary  Order.  Upon  the  filing  of  a  Summons  and  Petition  in  any  of  the 
actions specified in Sections (a)(1) and (2) above, the court on its own motion shall automatically 
issue a Temporary Order that includes the following provisions: 

(1)  The  parties  shall  be  restrained  from  transferring,  removing,  encumbering,  concealing  or  in 
any  way  disposing  of  any  property  except  in  the  usual  course  of  business  or  for  the 
necessities of life or as agreed in writing by the parties.  Each party shall notify the other party 
of any extraordinary expenditure made after the order is issued. 

(2)  The parties shall be restrained from assigning, transferring, borrowing, lapsing, surrendering 
or  changing  entitlement  of  any  insurance  policies  of  either  or  both  parties  whether  medical, 
health, life or auto insurance, except as agreed in writing by the parties. 

(3)  Each party shall be immediately responsible for his or her own future debts whether incurred 
by  credit  card  or  loan,  security  interest  or  mortgage,  except  as  agreed  in  writing  by  the 
parties. 

(4)  Both parties shall have access to all tax, financial, legal and household records.  Reasonable 

access to records shall not be denied. 

(5)  For those actions in which children are involved: 

(i) 

Each  parent  shall  be  restrained  from  changing  the  residence  of  the  child(ren) 
until further court order, except as agreed in writing by the parties.  Subsequent 
orders  regarding  parenting  issues  supercede  previously  issued  orders  to  the 
extent the orders may be inconsistent. 

(ii) 

Each parent shall insure that the child(ren) not be exposed to negative comments 
about the other parent in the presence of the child(ren). 

c) Mediation in Contested Cases.  Mediation shall apply to all cases filed after January 1, 2004.  
Except as provided in Section (d) below, in all cases specified in Section (a) having unresolved issues

mediator in an effort to resolve the case.  The parties may either agree to a mediator from the court 
approved list or the mediator will be determined by use of a strike list.    Either party may seek a court 
apportionment of the cost of mediation.  In cases where parenting issues exist, the mediation shall not 
occur until both parties have completed the parenting seminar described in SCLSPR 94.04.1.   A 
certificate of completion signed by the mediator shall be filed with the clerk of the court prior to trial. 

Amended September 1, 2005] 

d) When Mediation is not Required.  Mediation shall be required as provided in Section (c) except in 
the following cases: 
 

(1)  For good cause shown upon motion and approval by the court;  

(2)  Where  a  domestic  violence  restraining  order  or  protection  order  (excluding  ex-parte  orders) 

involving the parties has been entered by a court at any 
any time within the previous 12 months; 

(3)  Where a domestic violence no contact order exists pursuant to RCW 10.99; 

4)  Where  the  court  upon  motion  finds  that  domestic  abuse  has  occurred  between  the  parties 

and that such abuse would interfere with arm’s-length mediation. 

otwithstanding  the  foregoing,  either  party  may  by  motion  seek  a  court  order  requiring  mandatory 
mediation  in  a  case  where  it  would  not  be  required  as  set  forth  in  (d)(2),  (d)(3)  or  (d)(4)  above  if  the 
moving  party  believes  that  the  parties  would  be  able  to  mediate  their  dispute  at  arm’s-length  under  the 
particular circumstances of the case. 

e)  Failure  to  Comply.    A  party’s  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  this  rule  may  be  enforced  upon 
Motion and Order to Show Cause.  Unless compliance is waived by the court for good cause shown, the 
court  may  order  appropriate  sanctions  including  costs,  attorney’s  fees,  and  adoption  of  the  complying 
party’s proposal.

completed. Failure to complete mediation, prior to the trial date,  will result in the trial being stricken.   A 
certification of completion  signed by the mediator shall be filed  with  the clerk.    [Effective  September 1, 
2005; amended April 2, 2006]

5.1  When the need arises for the appointment of a guardian ad litem in a case involving a subject area 
for which there is a registry, the court shall appoint a person from the registry, unless good cause is 
found and findings are entered supporting appointment of a person not listed on the registry. 

.2  Appointments from the registries shall be made in the exercise of the court’s sound discretion.  The 
court  may,  but  is  not  obligated  to,  appoint  a  person  whom  all  parties  have  stipulated  to  serve  as 
guardian ad litem.  Agreement of all parties will not suffice when one or more parties are alleged to 
be under a legal disability. 

.3 

In making appointments from a registry, among other factors, the court will consider the facts of the 
case, and the skills, experience and knowledge of persons on the registry. 

.4  Generally  a  guardian  ad  litem  will  be  required  to  accept  a  minimum  of  two  (2)  appointments  per 
year  at  public  expense.    These  two  appointments  from  the  previous  year  should  be  listed  on  the 
application. 

.5  Generally, appointments will be made on a rotational basis from the registry.   

Amended September 1, 2005] 

.6  Appointment of a guardian ad litem in all cases shall be on the form required by the court. 

.7   The court shall make provisions for fees and expenses pursuant to statute in the Order  
        Appointing Guardian ad Litem or in any subsequent order.  For all cases filed in Skagit County,  
        Order Appointing Guardian ad Litem form shall be used. (See the Superior Court Webpage under  
        the Forms tab.)  All expenses must be approved in advance. 

Amended September 1, 2005; amended September 1, 2015] 

.8   The Guardian ad Litem Review Committee will address any complaints made by any guardian ad 
litem  regarding  registry  or  appointment  matters  upon  the  Court  Administrator’s  receipt  of  said 
complaint.    The  guardian  ad  litem  shall  be  notified  in  writing  of  the  Guardian  ad  Litem  Review 
Committee’s decision.

attachments or the person is removed or suspended as set forth in Section VI.

reason that places the suitability of the person to act as guardian ad litem in question. 

.4  A guardian ad litem who ceases to be on the registry and who still has active or incomplete cases 
shall  immediately  report  his  circumstance  to  the  Court  Administrator,  and  the  court  shall  reassign 
such cases. 

.5  A  person’s  retention  on  the  registry  shall  be  reviewed  upon  the  court’s  receipt  of  a  complaint 
regarding performance in office or the court’s receipt of adverse information regarding the suitability 
of  a  person  to  serve  as  a  guardian  ad  litem.      Complaints  shall  be  reviewed  in  accordance  with 
Section VI. 

.6  A GAL may be immediately suspended by the Superior Court Administrator in case of emergency, 
and subject to timely review by the Guardian Ad Litem review Committee.  [Adopted September 1,

.  COMPLAINT PROCEDURE

Judge, the Superior Court Administrator, a representative of the Skagit County Bar Association, and 
a guardian ad litem from the registry, appointed by the Presiding Judge.

Committee  shall  advise  the  complainant  that  the  complaint  may  only  be  addressed  in  the 
context  of  the  case  at  bar,  either  by  seeking  the  removal  of  the  guardian  ad  litem  or  by 
contesting the information or recommendation contained in the guardian ad litem’s report or

manner as to assure that the trial judge remains uninformed as to the complaint; or 

b)  Make a finding that the complaint has no merit on its face and decline to review the complaint 

and so inform the complainant; or 

c)  Make a finding that the complaint appears to have merit and request a written response from 
the guardian ad litem within 10 business days, detailing the specific issues in the complaint to 
which the Committee desires a response.  The Committee shall provide the guardian ad litem 
with  a  copy  of  the  original  complaint.    In  considering  whether  the  complaint  has  merit,  the 
Committee shall consider whether the complaint alleges the guardian ad litem has: 

(1)  Violated a code of conduct including all Superior Court Guardian ad Litem Rules (GALR) 
and  applicable  professional  codes  of  conduct.  [Amended  March  1,  2013;  amended  June  1,

make  a  finding  as  to  each  of  the  issues  delineated  in  the  Committee’s  letter  to  the  guardian  ad 
litem.  Such findings shall state that either there is no merit to the issue based upon the guardian ad

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
