whether incurred by credit card, loan, security interest or mortgage, except as agreed in 
writing by the parties. 

(d) Both parties shall have access to all tax, financial, legal, and household records.  Reasonable 

access to records shall not be denied without order of the court. 

(e)  Within 30 days after the filing of any general appearance, answer or other responsive 

pleading, each party shall provide the other party with a completed Financial Declaration 
(WPF DRPSCU 01.1550) and a Verified Statement of Assets and Liabilities (form

Each party shall then file a Declaration of Mailing showing that these documents have been 
provided to the other party within the time limit.  In all cases involving a request for child 
support, maintenance or attorney fees, the completed Financial Declaration shall also be filed 
with the court.  All parties have a duty to supplement the financial information when 
additional information becomes available. 

.2 TEMPORARY ORDERS FOR PARTIES WITH MINOR CHILD(REN). 

a)  Both parents are restrained from changing the residence of the child(ren) until further court 

order, except as agreed in writing by the parties. 

(b) Each parent shall have full access to the child(ren)’s educational and medical records, unless 

otherwise ordered by the court.

other parent.  Neither parent shall make negative comments about the other parent in the 
presence of the child(ren). 

(d) Within 30 days of filing an appearance, answer or other responsive pleading in this action, 
both parties shall register for a court-approved parent education seminar.  Each party shall 
attend the seminar within 60 days of registering.  Upon completion of the seminar, each party 
shall file with the court the seminar completion certificate provided by the sponsoring agency 
or provider.  In no case shall opposing parties be required to attend a seminar together.

provide the other parent with a Proposed Parenting Plan, if they have not already done so. 

.3 MEDIATION AND SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE 

f the parties are not able to agree on the final terms of the Decree, they shall be required to 
participate in mediation of unresolved disputes.  Mediation is not required in cases involving  
domestic violence.  For purposes of this order, domestic violence has occurred in the 
relationship if (1) a domestic violence restraining order or protection order (excluding ex parte 
orders) involving the parties has been entered by a court at any time within the previous 12 
months; (2) a domestic violence no contact order exists pursuant to RCW 10.99; or (3) the 
court upon motion makes a finding that domestic violence has occurred between the parties and  
that such abuse would interfere with arm’s-length mediation.  If, after mediation, there remain 
unresolved issues, the parties may participate in a settlement conference, pursuant to LCR 16(d).

COURTROOM DECORUM AND PRACTICE GUIDELINES 
LCR 77(b)(1)(B) 

PREFACE 
 

The pursuit of justice is a serious undertaking and conduct during the litigation process, 

 
both within and outside the courtroom, must at all times satisfy the appearance as well as the 
reality of fairness and equal treatment.  Dignity, order and decorum are indispensable to the 
proper administration of justice. 

A trial is an adversary proceeding, and lawyers must advocate for their clients’ positions.  

However, conduct that may be characterized as discriminatory, abusive, or obstructive impedes 
the fundamental goal of resolving disputes rationally, peacefully and efficiently.  Such conduct 
tends to delay and often to deny justice. 

Attorneys are privileged to participate in the administration of justice in a unique way, 

and are responsible to their own consciences, to their clients, to one another, and to the public to 
conduct themselves in a manner which will facilitate, and never detract from, the administration 
of justice. 

A trial is a truth-seeking process designed to resolve human and societal problems in a 

rational and efficient manner.  A lawyer’s conduct should be characterized at all times by 
personal courtesy and professional integrity in the fullest sense of those terms.  A judge’s 
conduct should be characterized at all times by courtesy, patience, and fairness toward all 
participants.  The courts belong to the people of this state.  The guidelines are intended to 
facilitate access to the courts for the fair resolution of disputes and should never be applied to 
deny access. 

The purpose of these guidelines is to provide lawyers judges, and parties with a 

reasonable standard of conduct in judicial proceedings.  However, these guidelines are not 
intended to homogenize conduct or remove individuality from the courtroom.  To facilitate 
professional growth and foster voluntary compliance with these guidelines, the WSBA Court 
Congestion and Improvement Committee periodically review these guidelines.  Comments are 
considered by the committee and changes are incorporated as needed. 

All participants in judicial proceedings should voluntarily adhere to these guidelines.  

These guidelines shall not be used as a basis for litigation or for sanctions or penalties.  Nothing 
in these guidelines supersedes or detracts from existing codes or rules of conduct or discipline or 
alters existing standards by which lawyer negligence may be determined.

COURTROOM DECORUM 
 

I.    General Courtroom Decorum 
 

A.  Always be prompt. 
B.  Stand when the judge enters or leaves the courtroom. 
C.  Do not made personal attacks on opposing counsel. 
D.  Do not interrupt.  Wait your turn. 
E.  Enhancing courtroom decorum is a cooperative venture among bench and bar.  It is 

appropriate to call to the attention of opposing counsel any perceived violations of these 
guidelines out of the presence of the jury.  After the court has ruled, ask the court’s 
permission before arguing further. 

F.  Advise clients and witnesses of the formalities of the court, the appropriate guidelines, 

and any rulings on motions in limine.  Encourage their cooperation.  This applies both to 
attorneys and to pro se parties. 

G.  If there is a live microphone at counsel table, remember not to confer with others or rustle 

H.  Courtrooms equipped for videotaped reporting may require special precautions, such as 

papers near the microphone. 

remaining near a microphone. 

I.  Treat everyone in the courtroom with fairness, consideration, and respect.  Refrain from 

conduct that discriminates on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, creed, sex, 
age, disability, sexual orientation, or marital status. 

II.  General Trial Conduct 
 

A.  Offers of and requests for stipulations are appropriate to facilitate the presentation of a 
case, but should not be employed to communicate to the jury a party’s willingness or 
unwillingness to stipulate. 

B.  During trial, maintain appropriate respect for witnesses, jurors, and opposing counsel, 
avoiding informality.  Address adults by their titles or surnames unless permission has 
been given to use first names.  Avoid referring to adults by biased and demeaning 
expression or labels such as “girl,”, “gal,” or “boy.”  Address jurors individually or by 
name only during voir dire. 

C.  Treat jurors with respect and dignity, avoiding fawning, flattery, or pretended solicitude.  
Suggestions regarding the comfort or convenience of jurors should generally be made to 
the court out of the jury’s hearing. 

D.  During the opening statement and argument of opposing counsel, never inappropriately 

divert the attention of the court or the jury. 

E.  Avoid expressing an opinion to the jury about the testimony of a witness, a ruling of the 
court, or argument of counsel through exaggerated facial expressions or other contrived 
conduct. 

F.  When practical, give the court advance notice of any legal issue that is likely to be 

complex, difficult, and which you expect to require argument. 

G.  Do not argue the case in the opening statement. 

COURTROOM DECORUM AND PRACTICE GUIDELINES 
LCR 77 (b)(1)(B)

FORMS APPENDIX L 

H.  Counsel should not express to the jury personal knowledge or personal opinions about the 

evidence. 

I.  Address your remarks to the court, not to opposing counsel except when extending 

necessary courtesies, e.g., thank you. 

J.  Only attorney, parties, court personnel, and witnesses, when called to the stand, are 
permitted within the bar of the courtroom, unless otherwise allowed by the court. 
 

III.  Examination of Witnesses 
 

A.  When examining a witness, avoid undue repetition of the witness’ answer. 
B.  Make objections for evidentiary reasons without delivering a speech or guiding a witness.  

Recapitulate testimony only as needed to put an objection in context. 

C.  If a witness was on the stand at a recess or adjournment, have the witness ready to 

proceed when the court is resumed. 

D.  Attempt to anticipate witness scheduling problems and discuss them with opposing 

counsel and the court.  Try to schedule witnesses in advance of trial. 

IV.  Exhibits and Documents 
 

A.  Premark exhibits with the clerk for identification prior to trial where appropriate.  Hand 

all unmarked exhibits to the clerk for marking before using them in trial. 

B.  If practical, have photocopies of an exhibit for the court, opposing counsel, and the 

witness.  Avoid illegible copies if possible. 

C.  Return all exhibits to the clerk at each adjournment. 
D.  Whenever referring to an exhibit, mention the exhibit number. 
E.  Give to the clerk all papers intended for the court. 
F.  Show the proposed exhibit to opposing counsel prior to offering the exhibit in evidence. 

V.  Scheduling 
 

A.  When practical, consult opposing counsel before scheduling hearings and discovery 

appearances in an effort to avoid scheduling conflicts.  Assert a scheduling conflict only 
if the requested time is not available, not to obtain any unfair advantage. 

B.  If opposing counsel fails promptly to accept or reject a time offered for hearing or 

discovery appearance, raises an unreasonable number of conflicts, or consistently fails to 
comply with this standard, agreement is not required. 

C.  Where time associated with scheduling agreements could cause damage or harm to a 
client’s case, then a lawyer is justified in setting a hearing or discovery appearance 
without first consulting with opposing counsel. 

D.  Give notice of cancellation of appearances and hearings to all involved at the earliest 

possible time.

I.  Preferences of Individual Judges 

Counsel are advised to determine the preferences of individual judges with respect to 

movement within the courtroom.  Following are some examples of individual preferences. 
 

A.  Stand when addressing the court and when making objections. 
B.  Stand during opening statement and closing argument. 
C.  Approach the bench only with permission. 
D.  Maintain an appropriate distance from the witness and the jury. 
E.  In the presence of the jury, address the judge as “Your Honor.” 

A.  Make reasonable efforts to conduct all discovery by agreement.  Consider agreeing to an 

early voluntary exchange of information. 

B.  Comply with all reasonable discovery requests in a timely manner. 
C.  Stipulate to facts unless there is a genuine dispute. 
D.  Conduct yourself in a professional manner and treat other lawyers, the opposing party, 

and all involved with courtesy and civility at all times.  Clients should be counseled that 
civility and courtesy are required. 

E.  Be punctual in fulfilling all professional commitments and in communicating with the

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
