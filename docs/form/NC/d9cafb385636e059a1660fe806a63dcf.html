      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR UNDERAGE PERSON SEEKING COURT AUTHORIZATION TO MARRY

 
A person who is 16 or 17 years of age (a) who has been emancipated in a district court proceeding or (b) with consent of a parent 
having full or joint legal custody of the minor or by a person or agency having legal custody or serving as guardian of the minor.

 
A person who is 16 or 17 years of age may marry a person who is no more than four years older, upon an order of a district court 
judge authorizing the minor to marry.

  1.  Who may marry?
 

    A person who is 18 years of age or older.

   

   

   

   

  2.  Who may bring a civil action to ask a judge to authorize the person to marry?
 

   

 
A person who is 16 or 17 years of age who is seeking to marry a person who is no more than four years older may file a civil action 
in district court to have a judge enter an order authorizing the underage party to marry. The judge must find that the 16- or  
17-year-old is capable of assuming the responsibilities of marriage and that the marriage will serve the best interest of the 
underage party. The person the underage party is seeking to marry must consent to the marriage.

  3.  Who can help you with this proceeding?
 

   

 
You can fill out the complaint form and summons (if the clerk asks you to complete the summons) by yourself or you can hire 
an attorney who can fill them out for you. However, whether or not you have an attorney when you file this action, the clerk will 
appoint an attorney as guardian ad litem to represent your best interest in this case. If you are unable to pay the expenses of this 
attorney guardian ad litem, the State will pay.

  4.  How do you ask the judge to authorize you to marry?
 

   

 
You ask the clerk of court in the county in which you live to give you a copy of the form to seek authorization to marry. The form is 
entitled “Complaint For Judicial Authorization For Underage Person To Marry,” AOC-CV-120.

	 5.	 How	do	you	fill	out	the	form	asking	for	judicial	authorization	to	marry?
 

   

 
In filling out the form, you are the “plaintiff.” You must print your name and address in the block asking for the name and address 
of the plaintiff. The following persons are to be listed as Defendants No. 1-3 in the order listed: Your father, your mother, your legal 
custodian or guardian. You must print their names and addresses in the blocks listed.

	 6.	 What	do	you	do	when	you	have	filled	out	the	complaint	form?
 

    You must file the complaint form with the clerk of court.

	 7.	 What	is	the	cost	of	the	proceeding?
 

   

 
The clerk will ask you to pay the costs of filing a district court civil action, which are the amount set forth in G.S. 7A-305. If you are 
unable to pay these costs you may ask to sue as an indigent. Ask the clerk to give you a copy of AOC-G-106, “Petition To 
Proceed As An Indigent.” You may be asked by the clerk to list your income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.

	 8.	 What	happens	after	you	have	filed	the	complaint?
 

   

 
Some clerks will ask you to fill out the summons. The clerk will give you copies of AOC-CV-121, “Civil Summons In Action By 
Underage Person For Authorization To Marry.” You must fill out an original and one copy for each defendant plus an additional 
copy for the guardian ad litem appointed by the clerk. YOU MUST SEE THAT COPIES OF THE COMPLAINT AND SUMMONS 
ARE SERVED ON ALL OF THE DEFENDANTS AND ON THE GUARDIAN AD LITEM. (See 9. for details.)

(Over)

AOC-CV-120 Instructions, Rev. 10/21 © 2021 Administrative Office of the Courts	 9.	 How	do	you	serve	copies	of	the	complaint	and	summons?
 

   

 
You must serve your parents, legal custodian, or guardian by either asking the sheriff to effect service or by mailing a copy of the 
complaint and summons by certified mail, return receipt requested, to each defendant.

 

   

 
If you paid the filing fee at the clerk’s office, you must pay the sheriff a service fee for each person to be served. If you were 
authorized to sue as an indigent, you are not required to pay the service fee to the sheriff. If the sheriff serves the process, the 
sheriff will make a return of service to the court.

 

   

 

   

If you serve the defendants by certified mail, you must file an affidavit with the clerk of court indicating that a copy of the 
 
summons and complaint were deposited in the post office for mailing by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to 
each defendant served by registered or certified mail and that it was in fact received by the defendant served as evidenced by 
the attached registry receipt or other evidence; and you must attach to the affidavit the genuine receipt (green postal receipt of 
service) or other evidence of delivery. You may ask the guardian ad litem to help you with this.

 
YOU ALSO MUST SERVE A COPY OF THE COMPLAINT AND SUMMONS ON THE GUARDIAN AD LITEM APPOINTED BY 
THE CLERK. You may serve the guardian ad litem by one of the same methods described above for serving the defendants or 
you may serve the guardian ad litem by mailing a copy by first class mail to the guardian ad litem at the address listed on 
AOC-CV-120, “Complaint For Judicial Authorization For Underage Person To Marry,” or by handing a copy to the guardian ad 
litem.

10.  What happens at the hearing?
 
 

   

 
You may participate in the court hearing on your own behalf. The guardian ad litem appointed to represent your best interest will 
also present evidence to the court about whether you are capable of assuming the responsibilities of marriage and whether it is in 
your best interest to marry. Also your parents, legal custodian, or guardian may testify about whether they think it is in your best 
interest to marry. You may ask the guardian ad litem to help you have the hearing scheduled. You might also ask the guardian ad 
litem to assure the presence of the person you wish to marry at the hearing so that person can testify that he or she consents to 
the marriage.

11.	 What	happens	after	the	hearing?
	
 

   

 
If the judge authorizes your marriage, you can ask the Clerk of Superior Court for a certified copy of the judge’s order and take that 
order to the Register of Deeds where you and the person you are authorized to marry must fill out an application for a marriage 
license. If the judge denies your request for authorization to marry, there is no right of appeal. You may not seek authorization to 
marry from any Court until after one year from the date of entry of the order denying your request.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
