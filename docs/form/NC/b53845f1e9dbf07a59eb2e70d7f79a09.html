      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: DWI Vehicle Seizure Frequently Asked Questions (December 2015) DWI Vehicle Seizure In North Carolina, a law enforcement officer must seize a motor vehicle if the driver is charged with an impaired driving offense and at the time of the offense the driver™s license already is revoked for a prior impaired driving offense or the driver is not validly licensed and not covered by an automobile liability insurance policy. The law enforcement officer must seize the vehicle even if the driver is not the owner of the vehicle. The vehicle first will be towed to a local storage facilit. y. To identify the local storage facility, . contact the law enforcement agency that arrested the driver (e. g. , State Highway Patrol, local police department, county sheriff) . At some point, usually within a few da. ys, the vehicle will be towed to the facilities of a state contractor. Eastway Wrecker, based in Charlotte, serves the western part of the state. Martin Edwards & Associates, based in Linden, serves the eastern part of the state. You may contact Eastway at (877) DWI TOWS. . You may contact Martin Edwards at (910) 897 6382. . Based on certain factors, the court will either return the vehicle to the owner (also known as ﬁreleasingﬂ the vehicle) or transfer the vehicle to the local school board (also known as ﬁforfeitingﬂ the vehicle) . There is also a possibility that the vehicle will be sold without a court order. These pretrial sales are discussed later in this document. This information is not a substitute for the advice of an attorney. If you have any questions regarding your legal rights and remedies, you should consult an attorney licensed to practice . law in North Carolina. Where is my vehicle now? What will happen to my vehicle? Why has my vehicle been seized? DWI Vehicle Seizure Page 1 of 6 If you. were the owner of. the vehicle in . DMV™s records at the . time. of the . seiz. ure, . but you we. re not the . driv. er at the time. of the. . seizure, . you can regain the vehicl. e if you can demonst. rate to the. . clerk™s office that you are ﬁinnocent. ﬂ There are five different . ways that you can demonstrate your innocence: . You did not know and had no reason to know that the driver™s license was revoked, . or you did not know and had no reason . to know that the driver did not have a valid license and did . . not have liability insurance. . You. knew that the driver™s license was rev. oked, or you knew that the driver did. not ha. ve a valid . licen. se and did . not have. . liability insu. rance, but. t. he driver dr. ove t. he vehicl. e without. . your. permisi. on and . you . have f. iled a po. lice report for. . unauthorized use of the . vehicl. e an. d you ha. ve agreed to. . pr. osecut. e the driver. . You. had re. ported the th. eft . of the vehi. cle (i. . e. , the driv. er stole the. vehicle . from you . and th. en used . it to co. mmit the . offens. e) . . You are in the business of ren. ting vehicles and. either (i) . the driver was not listed as an authorized driver on the. . . rental contract . or (ii) the driver was listed as an authorized driver on the . rental contract, but you had no actual knowledge of the . . revocation of the driver™s license at the time the . . contract was entered. . Y. ou . are in the business of leasing motor vehicles, you held . legal title. to . the motor vehi. cle as a . lessor . at the time . of . s. eiz. ure, an. d you did not . know the . driver™s . license was. . revoke. d at the . time y. ou entered into the lease agreement w. ith the . driver. . There are other requirements that you must satisfy in addition to . proving that you are innocent. . . You sh. ould ask the. cler. k™s . offi. ce for form AOC-. CR 330 A. Once . y. ou comp. lete and . file th. is form, th. e . clerk . will revi. ew your. . pe. tition as soon as . feasible. . Depe. nding on the workload of the. . clerk . and other factor. s, th. e cler. k may. not . be able to . review . your. . petition immediately. . How can I get my vehicle back if I b. elieve that I should not be . held responsible for the driver™s actions? . DWI Vehicle Seizure. Page 2 of 6 If you. were the owner of. the vehicle in . DMV™s records at the . time. of the . seiz. ure, . but you we. re not the . driv. er at the time. of the. . seizure, you may. post. a bond equal to th. e fai. r market value of . the vehicle. . Po. sting the bond . will allow you to . take po. ssession . of the . vehi. cle tem. porarily un. til the next . court he. aring on . the vehi. cle. There are other requirements that you will need to satisfy in . addition to posting the bond. . Yo. u sh. ould ask the. cler. k™s . offi. ce for form. s AOC-. CR 330 A and . AOC CR 331 A. If you were the driver and the owner of the vehicle in DMV™s . records at the time of the seizure, you can obtain the permanent . release of the vehicle if you can demonstrate that, at the time of . . the seizure, your license was not revoked for a prior impaired . . driving offense. . There are other requirement. s that . you must. satisfy. . Yo. u sh. ould as. k the cler. k for form. AOC CR-. 333 A. If you are a lienholder you may secure. the. release. of the vehicle if you he. ld a pe. rfected . security in. terest in the . vehi. cle at the . time o. f the . seizur. e, the . obligor is in de. fault, as a . result of the de. fault you . are en. titled to po. ssesion . of the . vehicle, . you agree to sell the vehicle and pay into the clerk™s office . the. net sale proceeds and. you ag. ree not to. sell, give, . or othe. rwis. e tr. ansf. er po. ssession . of the vehi. cle to the . driver or the . owne. r. How else can I get my vehicle back if I am the owner, but was not . driving? How can I get my vehicle back if I am the owner and the person . charged with the impaired driving offense? What if I am a lienholder on this vehicle? How can I get it back? . DWI Vehicle Seizure. Page 3 of 6 There are other requirements that you must satisfy as a lienholder. You should ask the clerk™s office for form AOC CR 334 A. You must serve a copy of the form on the owner, the DA, and the school board attorney. If these parties consent to your petition, the clerk will release the vehicle to you. If they do not consent, there will be a court hearing on your petition. Yes. You must pay all accumulated towing and storage charges to the company holding the vehicle before the company will release the vehicle to you. There are no exceptions to this requirement. If the driver is convicted, the court may order the driver to repay you for this amount. You do not have a right to appeal immediately from a decision denying your pretrial release petition. You must wait until the court has acted on the impaired driving offense. If the defendant is not convicted, the court will permanently release the vehicle to the owner. If the defendant is convicted, the court will hold a ﬁforfeiture hearingﬂ on the status of the vehicle. Owners, defendant owners and lienholders may request the release of the vehicle again at this hearing. The State Surplus Property office, through the state contractors, is authorized to sell the vehicle without a court order under certain circumstances in order to prevent the towing and storage costs from overtaking the value of the vehicle. The contractors will pay the net proceeds of the sale into the clerk™s office. These proceeds will later be used to pay off any outstanding liens, with any remainder being released to the owner or forfeited to the school board just as the vehicle would have been. If the vehicle is released to me, am I required to pay the towing and storage costs? What if my pretrial release request is denied? My vehicle has been sold prior to the driver™s trial without a court order. What does this mean? DWI Vehicle Seizure Page 4 of 6 Contact the company that is storing the vehicle. You can retrieve your personal property if you can provide sufficient proof to the company that you own the items. How may I recover personal property that I left in the vehicle? The NC Division of Motor Vehicles will instruct the insurance company to pay the insurance proceeds to the clerk™s office rather than to the policy holder. The proceeds later will be released or forfeited in the same manner as the seized vehicle. There is a special procedure for totaled. vehicles. Generally speaking, you may appeal the court™s decision to the NC Court of Appeals. However, if the driver is convicted in District Court and appeals the conviction to Superior Court, your appeal of the release/forfeiture decision may have to be heard by the Superior Court. You must contact the company that is storing your vehicle to arrange a date and time to pick up the vehicle. The company will specify the items that you will need to bring with you to the storage site (for example, a photo ID, a certified copy of the release order, payment for the towing and storage costs) . What if the vehicle was damaged during the offense? What if the court denies my request for release at the forfeiture hearing? May I appeal? If the vehicle is released to me, how do I retake possession of it? DWI Vehicle Seizure Page 5 of 6 You are not allowed to remove property that is affixed to the vehicle. DWI Vehicle Seizure.
