WAIVER OF TRIAL - PLEA OF GUILTY - CONSENT TO ENTRY OF JUDGMENT

I request that the Court accept my waiver of trial, plea of Guilty and tender of fine, costs 
and restitution, and that a verdict of Guilty be entered. This request is made with the full 
understanding that a verdict of Guilty will be entered against my record, and it will have 
the same legal effect for all purposes as a verdict of Guilty after a trial.

I acknowledge that I have been charged by the complainant indicated on the front side 
with a violation of G.S. 14-107 (worthless check).

I understand that I am presumed by law to be Not Guilty until proven Guilty beyond a 
reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, I do hereby waive my constitutional rights to a trial in 
open court, to confront the witnesses against me, and to representation by an attorney.

I hereby plead Guilty to this offense and tender to the Court the sums listed below as 
payment of the fine, costs and restitution in this case.
