  3.   I     

 used

defendant’s federal military service. 

 The results from my use of that website are attached. 

(NOTE: The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act Website is a website maintained by the Department of Defense (DoD). If DoD security certificates 
are not installed on your computer, you may experience security alerts from your internet browser when you attempt to access the website. 
Members of the North Carolina National Guard under an order of the Governor of this State and members of the National Guard of another state 
under an order of the governor of that state will not appear in the SCRA Website database.)

  4.   The following facts support my statement as to the defendant’s military service: (State how you know the defendant is or is not in the 

military. Be specific.)

*NOTE:   The term “military service” includes the following: active duty service as a member of the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or

for a period of more than 30 consecutive days for purposes of responding to a national emergency; active service as a commissioned officer 
of the Public Health Service or of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; any period of service during which a servicemember 
is absent from duty on account of sickness, wounds, leave, or other lawful cause. 50 U.S.C. 3911(2). The term “military service” also includes 
the following: State active duty as a member of the North Carolina National Guard under an order of the Governor pursuant to Chapter 127A of 
the General Statutes, for a period of more than 30 consecutive days; service as a member of the National Guard of another state who resides 
in North Carolina and is under an order of the governor of that state that is similar to State active duty, for a period of more than 30 consecutive

the defendant is in military service, do not proceed to enter judgment until such time that you have appointed an attorney 
to represent him or her.

AOC-G-250, Rev. 5/21© 2021 Administrative Office of the CourtsInformation About Servicemembers Civil Relief Act Affidavits And Declarations

1.  Plaintiff to file affidavit/declaration
 

(A) 

 
In any civil action or proceeding, including any child custody proceeding, in which the defendant 
does not make an appearance, the court, before entering judgment for the plaintiff, shall require the 
plaintiff to file with the court an affidavit—
 

 
stating whether or not the defendant is in military service and showing necessary facts to 
support the affidavit; or
 
if the plaintiff is unable to determine whether or not the defendant is in military service, 
stating that the plaintiff is unable to determine whether or not the defendant is in military 
service.

(B) 

 

 

 

  50 U.S.C. 3931(b)(1).

2.  Appointment of attorney to represent defendant in military service
 

 
If in a civil action or proceeding in which the defendant does not make an appearance it appears 
that the defendant is in military service, the court may not enter a judgment until after the court 
appoints an attorney to represent the defendant. If an attorney appointed to represent a service 
member cannot locate the service member, actions by the attorney in the case shall not waive any 
defense of the service member or otherwise bind the service member. 50 U.S.C. 3931(b)(2).  
State funds are not available to pay attorneys appointed pursuant to the Servicemembers Civil 
Relief Act. To comply with the federal Violence Against Women Act and in consideration of  
G.S. 50B-2(a), 50C-2(b), and 50D-2(b), plaintiffs in Chapter 50B, Chapter 50C, and Chapter 
50D proceedings should not be required to pay the costs of attorneys appointed pursuant to the 
Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. Plaintiffs in other types of actions and proceedings may be 
required to pay the costs of attorneys appointed pursuant to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. 
The allowance or disallowance of the ordering of costs will require a case-specific analysis.

3.  Defendant’s military status not ascertained by affidavit/declaration 
 

 
If based upon the affidavits filed in such an action, the court is unable to determine whether the 
defendant is in military service, the court, before entering judgment, may require the plaintiff to file 
a bond in an amount approved by the court. If the defendant is later found to be in military service, 
the bond shall be available to indemnify the defendant against any loss or damage the defendant 
may suffer by reason of any judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant, should the judgment be 
set aside in whole or in part. The bond shall remain in effect until expiration of the time for appeal 
and setting aside of a judgment under applicable Federal or State law or regulation or under any 
applicable ordinance of a political subdivision of a State. The court may issue such orders or enter 
such judgments as the court determines necessary to protect the rights of the defendant under this 
Act. 50 U.S.C. 3931(b)(3).

4.  Satisfaction of requirement for affidavit/declaration
 

 
The requirement for an affidavit above may be satisfied by a statement, declaration, verification, or 
certificate, in writing, subscribed and certified or declared to be true under penalty of perjury.  
50 U.S.C. 3931(b)(4). The presiding judicial official will determine whether the submitted affidavit is 
sufficient.

5.  Penalty for making or using false affidavit/declaration
 

 
A person who makes or uses an affidavit permitted under 50 U.S.C. 3931(b) (or a statement, 
declaration, verification, or certificate as authorized under 50 U.S.C. 3931(b)(4)) knowing it to be 
false, shall be fined as provided in title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned for not more than one 
year, or both. 50 U.S.C. 3931(c).

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
