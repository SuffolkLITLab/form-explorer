      <pre>Colloquy for Proceedings Conducted by 
Audio and Video Transmission 
Approved by the Remote Proceedings Task Force on August 5, 2022 

OTE TO PRESIDING OFFICIAL: This colloquy is intended for use in criminal proceedings conducted by 

audio and video transmission when the defendant’s right to be present or confront witnesses is 
implicated. See G.S. 7A-49.6(e) (“Except as otherwise permitted by law, when the right to confront 
witnesses or be present is implicated in criminal or juvenile delinquency proceedings, the court may not 
proceed by audio and video transmission unless the court has obtained a knowing, intelligent, and 
voluntary waiver of the defendant's or juvenile respondent's rights.”). 

art 1 - Establish that Audio and Video Transmission is Functioning for All Parties 

Defendant], please state your name for the record. 

Defendant], please tell me where you are located at this time. 

Defendant], are you able to see and hear me? 

f the answer to the previous question is no, ask the following question: 

[Defendant], are you able to see and hear your attorney through the audio and video 
transmission? 

Defendant], have you had an opportunity to talk to your attorney in private? 

Defendant], do you understand that you can ask to speak privately with your attorney at any 
time during this proceeding? 

Defense counsel], please state your name for the record. 

Defense counsel], where are you located at this time? 

  I

 

  [

  [

  [

  [

OTE TO PRESIDING OFFICIAL: The next several questions apply only for represented defendants. Ensure 

that counsel has an opportunity to consult with the defendant privately and that counsel can see and 
hear all participants before proceeding. 
 

[Defendant], is your attorney present in the same room with you?

Defense counsel], are you able to see and hear me? 

Defense counsel], have you had an opportunity to talk with [the defendant] in private? 

Defense counsel], are you able to speak privately with [the defendant] while participating in this 
audio and video proceeding?

Attorney for the State], where are you located at this time?

Attorney for the State], are you able to see and hear [the defendant]? 

Attorney for the State], are you able to see and hear defense counsel? 

Defendant], are you able to see and hear [the attorney for the State]? 

Defense counsel], are you able to see and hear [the attorney for the State]? 

To all parties], if at any time you realize that you are unable to see or hear any of the other people 
participating in this proceeding, please let me know immediately and I will stop the hearing so that we 
can address the issue. 

OTE TO PRESIDING OFFICIAL: Once you have determined that all of the parties can see, hear, and 

speak with one another, and that the defendant can confidentially communicate with counsel (if 
represented), make appropriate findings on the record regarding the method by which the proceeding is 
being conducted, the location of the defendant, counsel, and the judge, and the ability of each party to 
see, hear, and speak with one another. Sample language follows: 
 

Let the record show that this proceeding is being conducted by remote audio-video technology.  
- 
- 

The court is participating from [insert location of presiding official].  
[Attorney for the State] is participating from [his/her] location at [insert location of attorney for 
the State].  
[Defendant] is participating from [his/her] location at [insert location of defendant].  
(If defendant is represented) [Defense counsel] is participating from [his/her] location at [insert 
location of attorney].

other and therefore finds that the audio-video technology is working properly. (If defendant is 
represented) The court further finds that the defendant is receiving the assistance of counsel and is 
able to communicate privately with counsel. 

art 2 - Establish Valid Waiver of Defendant’s Rights to In-Person Appearance and Confrontation 

efore moving forward, I want to advise you about the rights you will be giving up if you agree to have 

this proceeding conducted through audio and video transmission. 

If right to presence is implicated) You have the right to appear and be present physically for this 
proceeding. You are not required to waive the right to be present. If you do not agree to having this 
proceeding by audio and video transmission, this proceeding will be rescheduled to be conducted in 
person without unreasonable delay. 

If right to confrontation is implicated) You have the right to confront and cross-examine any witnesses 
who may testify in this proceeding. This means that you have the right to face physically anyone who 
testifies against you, and to question that person. You are not required to waive the right to confront in 
person the witnesses against you. If you do not agree to waive this right, this proceeding will be 
rescheduled to be conducted in person without unreasonable delay. If you do waive this right, [you; 
your counsel] still can cross-examine the witnesses against you and present your own witnesses. That 
simply would occur over this audio-video connection rather than in person. 

Defendant], do you understand these rights? 

If right to presence is implicated) [Defendant], do you waive your right to be present physically for this 
proceeding? 

If right to confrontation is implicated) [Defendant], do you waive your right to confront and cross-
examine in person the witnesses who testify at this proceeding, and consent that any such confrontation 
and cross-examination may be conducted by means of this audio and video transmission? 

Defendant], is there anything about this proceeding or the rights you are waiving that you do not 
understand or that you would like to discuss with your attorney? 

Defendant and defense counsel], if you need to confer privately at any time during this proceeding, 
please let me know, and you will be given the opportunity to do so. 

Defendant], are you satisfied with having this proceeding today by means of this audio and video 
transmission?

and voluntary waiver of the right to physical presence and the right to confront witnesses, enter 
appropriate findings on the record. A sample statement follows: 
 

Let the record show that [defendant] has consented to [his/her] participation in this proceeding 
by way of audio and video technology. [Defendant] has knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily 
waived any right to (select one or both: be present physically; confront in person the witnesses 
in this proceeding).

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
