Frequently Asked Questions

DWI Vehicle Seizure

This information is not a substitute for the advice of an attorney. 
If you have any questions regarding your legal rights and 
remedies, you should consult an attorney licensed to practice 
law in North Carolina.

Why has my vehicle been seized?
 
In North Carolina, a law enforcement officer must seize a motor  
•
  vehicle if the driver is charged with an impaired driving offense  
  and at the time of the offense 
 
 
 
 

the driver’s license already is revoked for a prior impaired  
driving offense or 
the driver is not validly licensed and not covered by an  
automobile liability insurance policy. 

⇒ ⇒

 
 
 
 

  The law enforcement officer must seize the vehicle even if the  
•
  driver is not the owner of the vehicle.

identify the local storage facility, contact the law   

Where is my vehicle now?
  The vehicle first will be towed to a local storage facility. To 
•
 
  enforcement agency that arrested the driver (e.g., State  
  Highway Patrol, local police department, county sheriff).
•
  At some point, usually within a few days, the vehicle will be  
 
towed to the facilities of a state contractor. Eastway Wrecker,  
  based in Charlotte, serves the western part of the state. Martin  
  Edwards & Associates, based in Linden, serves the eastern part  
  of the state. You may contact Eastway at (877) DWI-TOWS. 
  You may contact Martin Edwards at (910) 897-6382.

 
 

return the vehicle to the owner (also known as “releasing”  
the vehicle) or
transfer the vehicle to the local school board (also known 
as “forfeiting” the vehicle).

What will happen to my vehicle?
  Based on certain factors, the court will either

•
  There is also a possibility that the vehicle will be sold without a  
  court order. These pretrial sales are discussed later in this  
  document.

How can I get my vehicle back if I believe that I should not be 
held responsible for the driver’s actions?

 
If you were the owner of the vehicle in DMV’s records at the  
 
•
 
time of the seizure, but you were not the driver at the time of the   
  seizure, you can regain the vehicle if you can demonstrate to the   
  clerk’s office that you are “innocent.”  There are five different  
 
  ways that you can demonstrate your innocence:

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 

vehicle from you and then used it to commit the offense). 

⇒
  You did not know and had no reason to know that the driver’s  
license was revoked, or you did not know and had no reason    
 
to know that the driver did not have a valid license and did  
 
 
 
not have liability insurance.
⇒
  You knew that the driver’s license was revoked, or you knew  
 
that the driver did not have a valid license and did not have  
 
liability insurance, but the driver drove the vehicle without  
 
 
your permision and you have filed a police report for   
 
unauthorized use of the vehicle and you have agreed to  
 
 
prosecute the driver. 
⇒
  You had reported the theft of the vehicle (i.e., the driver stole the

  You are in the business of leasing motor vehicles, you held  
 
legal title to the motor vehicle as a lessor at the time of  
 
 
 
seizure, and you did not know the driver’s license was  
 
revoked at the time you entered into the lease agreement with  
 
the driver.
 

(i)  the driver was not listed as an authorized driver on the

  There are other requirements that you must satisfy in addition to   
•
  proving that you are innocent.
•
  You should ask the clerk’s office for form AOC-CR-330A. Once  
 
  you complete and file this form, the clerk will review your  
  petition as soon as feasible.  Depending on the workload of the    
  clerk and other factors, the clerk may not be able to review your   
  petition immediately.

How else can I get my vehicle back if I am the owner, but was not 
driving?

•

If you were the owner of the vehicle in DMV’s records at the  
 
time of the seizure, but you were not the driver at the time of the   
 

 
 
  seizure, you may post a bond equal to the fair market value of  
 

the vehicle.

  Posting the bond will allow you to take possession of the vehicle  
 

temporarily until the next court hearing on the vehicle.

  There are other requirements that you will need to satisfy in  
  addition to posting the bond.

 

  You should ask the clerk’s office for forms AOC-CR-330A and   
  AOC-CR-331A.

How can I get my vehicle back if I am the owner and the person 
charged with the impaired driving offense? 

If you were the driver and the owner of the vehicle in DMV’s  
 
records at the time of the seizure, you can obtain the permanent    
release of the vehicle if you can demonstrate that, at the time of   
the seizure, your license was not revoked for a prior impaired 

 
 
 
  driving offense.

  There are other requirements that you must satisfy.

  You should ask the clerk for form AOC-CR-333A.

•

•

   

•

• •

 

 

 

What if I am a lienholder on this vehicle?  How can I get it back?
•
 
 

If you are a lienholder you may secure the release of the vehicle   
if

you held a perfected security interest in the vehicle at the  
time of the seizure,

the obligor is in default,

as a result of the default you are entitled to possesion of the    
vehicle,

you agree to sell the vehicle and pay into the clerk’s office  
the net sale proceeds and

you agree not to sell, give, or otherwise transfer possession  
of the vehicle to the driver or the owner.

lienholder.

•
  There are other requirements that you must satisfy as a  
 
•
  You should ask the clerk’s office for form AOC-CR-334A. You  
 
  must serve a copy of the form on the owner, the DA, and the school   
 
  board attorney. If these parties consent to your petition, the clerk  
  will release the vehicle to you. If they do not consent, there will be a  
  court hearing on your petition.

 

If the vehicle is released to me, am I required to pay the towing 
and storage costs?
  Yes. You must pay all accumulated towing and storage charges to   
•
the company holding the vehicle before the company will release    
 
the vehicle to you. There are no exceptions to this requirement.
 
•
 
If the driver is convicted, the court may order the driver to repay  
  you for this amount.

What if my pretrial release request is denied?
•
  You do not have a right to appeal immediately from a decision    
  denying your pretrial release petition.  You must wait until the  
 
  court has acted on the impaired driving offense.
•
 
 

If the defendant is not convicted, the court will permanently  
release the vehicle to the owner.
 
If the defendant is convicted, the court will hold a “forfeiture  
 
•
  hearing” on the status of the vehicle. Owners, defendant-owners   
  and lienholders may request the release of the vehicle again at  
 
 

this hearing.

 

My vehicle has been sold prior to the driver’s trial without a 
court order. What does this mean?
•
  The State Surplus Property office, through the state contractors, 
is authorized to sell the vehicle without a court order under 
certain circumstances in order to prevent the towing and 
storage costs from overtaking the value of the vehicle.

•
 
  The contractors will pay the net proceeds of the sale into the  
  clerk’s office. These proceeds will later be used to pay off any  
 
  outstanding liens, with any remainder being released to the  
 
  owner or forfeited to the school board just as the vehicle would    
  have been.

ow may I recover personal property that I left in the vehicle?

  Contact the company that is storing the vehicle. You can retrieve  
  your personal property if you can provide sufficient proof to the   
  company that you own the items. 

•H

  You are not allowed to remove property that is affixed to the 
•
    vehicle.

What if the vehicle was damaged during the offense?

•
  The NC Division of Motor Vehicles will instruct the insurance    
 
  company to pay the insurance proceeds to the clerk’s office  
rather than to the policy holder. The proceeds later will be  
 
 
released or forfeited in the same manner as the seized vehicle.
 
•
  There is a special procedure for totaled vehicles.

What if the court denies my request for release at the forfeiture 
hearing?  May I appeal?
  Generally speaking, you may appeal the court’s decision to the    
•
  NC Court of Appeals.
•
  However, if the driver is convicted in District Court and appeals   
the conviction to Superior Court, your appeal of the  
 
 
 
release/forfeiture decision may have to be heard by the Superior   
  Court.

 

If the vehicle is released to me, how do I retake possession of it? 

  You must contact the company that is storing your vehicle to  
•
  arrange a date and time to pick up the vehicle.
•
  The company will specify the items that you will need to bring    
  with you to the storage site (for example, a photo ID, a certified   
 
  copy of the release order, payment for the towing and storage  
  costs).
