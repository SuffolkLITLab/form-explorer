YOU ARE REQUIRED to note the revocation of the obligor's licensing privileges upon the records of your board or agency and to take all
steps necessary to implement and enforce the revocation of the obligor's licensing privileges.

The Order Revoking Licensing Privileges is effective immediately and does not require your board or agency to institute an independent 
license revocation process pursuant to Chapter 20 or Chapter 150B of the General Statutes.
This revocation shall remain in full force and effect until your board or agency receives certification from the        Clerk   or        IV-D

NOTICE TO OBLIGOR:  If the order revoking your licensing privileges has not been stayed, you may file a petition with the Clerk of Superior Court 
seeking reinstatement of your licensing privileges conditioned on your agreement to pay the current and delinquent child support that you owe.  If the 
Court reinstates your licensing privileges or you pay all of the child support that you owe, you may obtain a certificate from the Clerk or IV-D agency 
allowing reinstatement of your licensing privileges.  If the Court has granted you a limited driving privilege, you must keep a copy of this Order in your 
possession while you are driving a motor vehicle and comply with the conditions noted in the order.  If you violate the conditions related to a limited 
driving privilege, you may be punished under G.S. 20-28(a) for driving while your license is revoked.  IF YOUR DRIVERS LICENSE IS REVOKED 
FOR ANY OTHER REASON, THIS LIMITED DRIVING PRIVILEGE IS INVALID.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
