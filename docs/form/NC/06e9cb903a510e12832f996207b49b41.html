AOC-G-100, Rev. 2/18© 2018 Administrative Office of the CourtsNOTE: Rule 45, North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, Subsections (c) and (d).

(c) Protection of Persons Subject to Subpoena

(1)  Avoid undue burden or expense. - A party or an attorney responsible for the 

issuance and service of a subpoena shall take reasonable steps to avoid imposing 
an undue burden or expense on a person subject to the subpoena. The court shall 
enforce this subdivision and impose upon the party or attorney in violation of this 
requirement an appropriate sanction that may include compensating the person 
unduly burdened for lost earnings and for reasonable attorney’s fees.

(2)  For production of public records or hospital medical records. - Where the subpoena 
commands any custodian of public records or any custodian of hospital medical 
records, as defined in G.S. 8-44.1, to appear for the sole purpose of producing 
certain records in the custodian’s custody, the custodian subpoenaed may, in 
lieu of personal appearance, tender to the court in which the action is pending by 
registered or certified mail or by personal delivery, on or before the time specified 
in the subpoena, certified copies of the records requested together with a copy of 
the subpoena and an affidavit by the custodian testifying that the copies are true 
and correct copies and that the records were made and kept in the regular course 
of business, or if no such records are in the custodian’s custody, an affidavit to that 
effect. When the copies of records are personally delivered under this subdivision, 
a receipt shall be obtained from the person receiving the records. Any original or 
certified copy of records or an affidavit delivered according to the provisions of this 
subdivision, unless otherwise objectionable, shall be admissible in any action or 
proceeding without further certification or authentication. Copies of hospital medical 
records tendered under this subdivision shall not be open to inspection or copied by 
any person, except to the parties to the case or proceedings and their attorneys in 
depositions, until ordered published by the judge at the time of the hearing or trial. 
Nothing contained herein shall be construed to waive the physician-patient privilege 
or to require any privileged communication under law to be disclosed.

(3)  Written objection to subpoenas. - Subject to subsection (d) of this rule, a person 

commanded to appear at a deposition or to produce and permit the inspection and 
copying of records, books, papers, documents, electronically stored information, 
or tangible things may, within 10 days after service of the subpoena or before the 
time specified for compliance if the time is less than 10 days after service, serve 
upon the party or the attorney designated in the subpoena written objection to the 
subpoena, setting forth the specific grounds for the objection. The written objection 
shall comply with the requirements of Rule 11. Each of the following grounds may 
be sufficient for objecting to a subpoena:

a. The subpoena fails to allow reasonable time for compliance.
b.  The subpoena requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter 

and no exception or waiver applies to the privilege or protection.
c. The subpoena subjects a person to an undue burden or expense.
d. The subpoena is otherwise unreasonable or oppressive.
e. The subpoena is procedurally defective.

 
 

 
 
 

(4)  Order of court required to override objection. - If objection is made under 

subdivision (3) of this subsection, the party serving the subpoena shall not be 
entitled to compel the subpoenaed person’s appearance at a deposition or to 
inspect and copy materials to which an objection has been made except pursuant 
to an order of the court. If objection is made, the party serving the subpoena may, 
upon notice to the subpoenaed person, move at any time for an order to compel 
the subpoenaed person’s appearance at the deposition or the production of the 
materials designated in the subpoena. The motion shall be filed in the court in the 
county in which the deposition or production of materials is to occur.

(5)  Motion to quash or modify subpoena. - A person commanded to appear at a 

trial, hearing, deposition, or to produce and permit the inspection and copying of 
records, books, papers, documents, electronically stored information, or other 
tangible things, within 10 days after service of the subpoena or before the time 
specified for compliance if the time is less than 10 days after service, may file 
a motion to quash or modify the subpoena. The court shall quash or modify the 
subpoena if the subpoenaed person demonstrates the existence of any of the 
reasons set forth in subdivision (3) of this subsection. The motion shall be filed 
in the court in the county in which the trial, hearing, deposition, or production of 
materials is to occur.

(6)  Order to compel; expenses to comply with subpoena. - When a court enters an 
order compelling a deposition or the production of records, books, papers, 
documents, electronically stored information, or other tangible things, the order 
shall protect any person who is not a party or an agent of a party from significant 
expense resulting from complying with the subpoena. The court may order that the 
person to whom the subpoena is addressed will be reasonably compensated for 
the cost of producing the records, books, papers, documents, electronically stored 
information, or tangible things specified in the subpoena.

(7)  Trade secrets; confidential information. - When a subpoena requires disclosure of a 
trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information, 
a court may, to protect a person subject to or affected by the subpoena, quash or 
modify the subpoena, or when the party on whose behalf the subpoena is issued 
shows a substantial need for the testimony or material that cannot otherwise be met 
without undue hardship, the court may order a person to make an appearance or 
produce the materials only on specified conditions stated in the order.

(8)  Order to quash; expenses. - When a court enters an order quashing or modifying 
the subpoena, the court may order the party on whose behalf the subpoena is 
issued to pay all or part of the subpoenaed person’s reasonable expenses 
including attorney’s fees.

(d) Duties in Responding to Subpoena

(1)  Form of response. - A person responding to a subpoena to produce records, 
books, documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things shall 
produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business or shall organize 
and label them to correspond with the categories in the request.

(2)  Form of producing electronically stored information not specified. - If a subpoena 

does not specify a form for producing electronically stored information, the person 
responding must produce it in a form or forms in which it ordinarily is maintained or 
in a reasonably useable form or forms.

(3)  Electronically stored information in only one form. - The person responding need 
not produce the same electronically stored information in more than one form.

(4)  Inaccessible electronically stored information. - The person responding need 

not provide discovery of electronically stored information from sources that the 
person identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. 
On motion to compel discovery or for a protective order, the person responding 
must show that the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue 
burden or cost. If that showing is made, the court may nonetheless order discovery 
from such sources if the requesting party shows good cause, after considering 
the limitations of Rule 26(b)(1a).The court may specify conditions for discovery, 
including requiring the party that seeks discovery from a nonparty to bear the 
costs of locating, preserving, collecting, and producing the electronically stored 
information involved.

(5)  Specificity of objection. - When information subject to a subpoena is withheld on 
the objection that it is subject to protection as trial preparation materials, or that 
it is otherwise privileged, the objection shall be made with specificity and shall be 
supported by a description of the nature of the communications, records, books, 
papers, documents, electronically stored information, or other tangible things not 
produced, sufficient for the requesting party to contest the objection.

INFORMATION FOR WITNESS

NOTE: If you have any questions about being subpoenaed as a witness, you should contact the person named on Page One of this Subpoena in the box labeled “Name And 
Address Of Applicant Or Applicant’s Attorney.”

DUTIES OF A WITNESS
•  Unless otherwise directed by the presiding judge, you must answer all questions 

asked when you are on the stand giving testimony.

•  In answering questions, speak clearly and loudly enough to be heard.
•  Your answers to questions must be truthful.
•  If you are commanded to produce any items, you must bring them with you to court 

or to the deposition.

•  You must continue to attend court until released by the court. You must continue to 

attend a deposition until the deposition is completed.

BRIBING OR THREATENING A WITNESS
It is a violation of State law for anyone to attempt to bribe, threaten, harass, or 
intimidate a witness. If anyone attempts to do any of these things concerning your 
involvement as a witness in a case, you should promptly report that to the district 
attorney or the presiding judge.

WITNESS FEE
A witness under subpoena and that appears in court to testify, is entitled to a small 
daily fee, and to travel expense reimbursement, if it is necessary to travel outside the 
county in order to testify. (The fee for an “expert witness” will be set by the presiding 
judge.) After you have been discharged as a witness, if you desire to collect the 
statutory fee, you should immediately contact the Clerk’s office and certify your 
attendance as a witness so that you will be paid any amount due you.
