1.

3.

the defendant poses a danger to the public, and therefore a secured bond or electronic house arrest with secured bond is 
required if release is otherwise authorized.

the defendant does not pose a danger to the public, and therefore conditions of release are set on the attached AOC-CR-200 as 
otherwise provided in G.S. Chapter 15A, Article 26.

there is insufficient information to determine whether the defendant poses a danger to the public, and therefore makes the 
following additional findings and orders below. (NOTE: Nos. 3.a. and 3.b. must be completed when making this finding.)

a.

The undersigned finds the following basis for the decision that additional information is needed to determine whether the 
defendant poses a danger to the public:

c.

The custodian of the detention facility named on the attached AOC-CR-200 is ORDERED to detain the defendant pursuant to

No. 3 above, then upon receipt of information identified in No. 3.b., any judicial official before whom the defendant is brought must set conditions of 
release pursuant to G.S. 15A-534(d2)(3), in accord with the official's further finding concerning danger to the public under Release From Detention Order
