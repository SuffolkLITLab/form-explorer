Judicial Branch Employees Must Avoid Conflicts of Interest

Citizens who come before the courts must have confidence and trust that all Judicial Branch employees will carry out their duties in a fair, objective
manner, without bias or favoritism. Among other things, this means that no court employee should have another job that could conflict with his or her
duties as a court employee.      

For example, a second job with a law firm, bondsman, law enforcement agency, or other entity that is regularly involved in court proceedings would
ordinarily present a conflict. That is because the secondary employer’s interests are regularly affected by court actions. For an employee whose duties 
for the court could overlap with the secondary employer’s activities in court, the conflict could directly affect the employee’s independent and impartial 
judgment. Even for an employee whose court duties would not directly interact with the secondary employer in court, there could be the appearance 
of a conflict. The court system must avoid even the appearance that someone might be receiving an advantage, “inside” information, or preferential
treatment.

Another example of a potential conflict would be a job with a company that does business with the court. That could create an appearance that the
secondary employer has an inside track to a contract for the provision of goods or services, or access to confidential court information that the employer 
could use in its business.

Another consideration is that outside employment should not reflect adversely on the dignity and integrity of the Judicial Branch.

The determination of whether a specific second job presents a conflict of interest is ultimately a judgment call to be made by the employee’s supervisor
and hiring authority. Some conflicts of interest are prohibited by statutes or the codes cited below. For the most part, these apply only to selected 
Judicial Branch officials and employees, but the underlying principles offer guidance for a determination of whether a second job would be a conflict 
for any employee.

Private practice of law is prohibited for justices, judges, magistrates, prosecutors, defenders, and clerks:
magistrate, full-time district attorney, full-time assistant district attorney, public defender, assistant public defender, clerk, deputy or assistant clerk of
the General Court of Justice ... shall engage in the private practice of law.” Violation is a Class 3 misdemeanor. NOTE: G.S. 84-2 does not apply to
attorneys working under contract for Indigent Defense Services to provide indigent defense.

G.S. 84-2: “No justice, judge, 

Assistant district attorney -- full time, no private practice:
his office and shall not engage in the private practice of law during his term.”

G.S. 7A-63: “An assistant district attorney shall ... devote his full time to the duties of 

Public Defender -- full time: G.S. 7A-498.7(c): “A public defender shall ... devote full time to the duties of the office.”

Clerk, full time -- business activities should not conflict:
Although there is no formal code of ethics applicable to clerks, a code of ethics for clerks in the Clerks’ Manual (Section IV, at 11.7) states the principle
that the clerk’s business activities should not conflict with the duties as clerk.

G.S. 7A-101(a): “The clerk of superior court is a full-time employee of the State ...” 

Code of Judicial Conduct: (applicable to justices and judges) and State Bar Rules of Professional Conduct (applicable to all lawyers): Although most
Judicial Branch employees are not subject to these Codes, they address conflicts of interest. While not every income-producing activity violates these
codes, they clearly proscribe activities that would impair the ability to exercise fair and impartial judgment. Canons 1 and 3 of the Code of Judicial
 Conduct speak to upholding the independence and impartiality of the judiciary, and Canon 5.C(1) states that a “judge should refrain from ...” Canon
financial and business dealings that reflect adversely on the judge’s impartiality, [or] interfere with the proper performance of the judge’s judicial duties
6 addresses compensation for quasi-judicial and extra-judicial activities. The State Bar Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.11(d), addresses conflict
 situations for a lawyer currently serving as a public officer or employee. If a Judicial Branch lawyer were to represent a person or give legal advice, the
conflict would relate to the lawyer’s ability to exercise independent judgment for both the agency and the person, and it could create an appearance
that the person is getting some inside, legal advantage from the court. 

Personal gains from public contracts are unlawful: G.S. 14-234 is concerned with situations where an employee of an agency would gain a benefit 
from an agency contract, such as where the employee has an interest in the company with which an agency has contracted. This statute also forbids an 
employee of an agency from soliciting or receiving a gift or reward in exchange for trying to influence the award of a contract by the agency. This statute 
does not address secondary employment per se, but it reflects the concern that a conflict may be presented if a court employee works for a business 
that contracts with the court.

State Government Ethics Act: (G.S. Chapter 138A): For the courts, this Act applies only to elected officials and a few others. However, the Act defines
standards of ethical conduct and conflicts of interest. Among other things, persons subject to the Act must not participate in official matters when they 
have a conflict of interest, such as a financial interest. The purpose of the Act (stated in G.S. 138A-2) is to ensure that “officials exercise their authority 
honestly and fairly, free from impropriety, threats, favoritism, and undue influence.”
