AOC CVR 15, Side Two, New 10/12. © 2012 Administrative Office of the Courts . G. S. 20 13. 3 (d 2) provided as follows: ﬁ (d 2) Hearing Before Magistrate or Judge If Provisional Licensee Contests Validity of Revocation. - A provisional licensee. whose permit or license is revoked under this section may request in writing a hearing to contest the validity of the revocation. The request may be made at the time of the person™s initial appearance, or within 10 days of the effective date. . of the revocation to the clerk or a magistrate designated by the clerk, and may specifically request that the hearing beconducted by a district court judge. The Administrative Office of the Courts must develop a hearing request form for anyprovisional licensee requesting a hearing. Unless a district court judge is requested, the hearing must be conducted within. . the county by a magistrate assigned by the chief district court judge to conduct such hearings. If the provisional licensee . . requests that a district court judge hold the hearing, the hearing must be conducted within the district court district as defined . . in G. S. 7 A 133 by a district court judge assigned to conduct such hearings. The revocation remains in effect pending the hearing, but the hearing must be held within three working days following the request if the hearing is before a magistrate. . or within ten working days if the hearing is before a district court judge. The request for the hearing must specify the . . grounds upon which the validity of the revocation is challenged, and the hearing must be limited to the grounds specified . in the request. A witness may submit his evidence by affidavit unless he is subpoenaed to appear. Any person who . . appears and testifies is subject to questioning by the judicial official conducting the hearing, and the judicial official may. . adjourn the hearing to seek additional evidence if the judicial official is not satisfied with the accuracy or completeness of. evidence. The provisional licensee contesting the validity of the revocation may, but is not required to, testify in his own . . behalf. Unless contested by the person requesting the hearing, the judicial official may accept as true any matter stated in . . the revocation report. If any relevant condition under subsection (b) of this section is contested, the judicial official must find . . by the greater weight of the evidence that the condition was met in order to sustain the revocation. At the conclusion of the . . hearing, the judicial official must enter an order sustaining or rescinding the revocation. The judicial official™s findings are. . without prejudice to the provisional licensee contesting the revocation and to any other potential party as to any other . . proceedings, civil or criminal, that may involve facts bearing upon the conditions in subsection (b) of this section considered. . by the judicial official. The decision of the judicial official is final and may not be appealed in the General Court of Justice. . . If the hearing is not held and completed within three working days of the written request for a hearing before a magistrate . . or within ten working days of the written request for a hearing before a district court judge, the judicial official must enter an . order rescinding the revocation, unless the provisional licensee contesting the revocation contributed to the delay incompleting the hearing. If the provisional licensee requesting the hearing fails to appear at the hearing or any rescheduling. . thereof after having been properly notified, the provisional licensee forfeits the right to a hearing. ﬂPROVISIONAL LICENSE CHALLENGE PROCEDUREIf you have any questions about your rights and responsibilities under this challenge process, you should consult. . an attorney licensed to practice law in North Carolina. </div>
