NOTE TO CLERK: “If the seizure was for an offense involving impaired driving, a defendant motor vehicle owner may file a petition with the clerk of 
court seeking a pretrial determination that the defendant’s license was not revoked pursuant to an impaired driving license revocation as defined in  
G.S. 20-28.2(a). The clerk shall schedule a hearing before a judge of the division in which the underlying criminal charge is pending for a hearing to be 
held within 10 business days or as soon thereafter as may be feasible. Notice of the hearing shall be given to the defendant, the district attorney, and the 
attorney for the county board of education.” If the State has consented to the release on Side One, a hearing is unnecessary. G.S. 20-28.3(e2)(1).

V. ORDER ON PETITION AFTER HEARING

This matter is before the Court on the petition of the defendant/petitioner named on the reverse side for a pretrial determination that the 
defendant/petitioner’s drivers license was not revoked pursuant to an impaired driving license revocation and for release of the motor 
vehicle described on the reverse side. A hearing was held before the Court on this date. On the basis of the evidence presented and the 
entire record in this action, the Court finds by the greater weight of the evidence that:

 

1.   The motor vehicle described on the reverse side was seized on the date shown above pursuant to G.S. 20-28.3. The  

defendant/petitioner was charged with committing an impaired driving offense and it was alleged that at the time of the offense 
the defendant/petitioner’s drivers license was revoked pursuant to an impaired driving license revocation as defined in  
G.S. 20-28.2(a).

  2.   The defendant/petitioner is a person in whose name a registration card or certificate of title for the motor vehicle was issued at 

the time of the seizure.

  3.   The defendant/petitioner has established that at the time of the above offense, the defendant/petitioner’s drivers license was not 

revoked as a result of an impaired driving license revocation as defined in G.S. 20-28.2(a).

 

4.   The Court has been furnished proof of the existence of financial responsibility to the extent required by Article 13 of Chapter 20  

of the General Statutes, and is satisfied that the defendant/petitioner is financially responsible.

Therefore, it is ORDERED that:

  1.   The motor vehicle described on the reverse side be released to the defendant/petitioner named on the reverse side upon 

payment of all towing and storage charges incurred as a result of the seizure and impoundment of that vehicle.

  2.   The petition is denied because the petitioner has failed to establish the facts necessary to support one or more of the findings 
required for release of the vehicle. The motor vehicle shall remain impounded pending further orders of the Court. If this Order 
is entered after a hearing on pretrial release, it may be reconsidered by the Court as part of the forfeiture hearing conducted 
pursuant to G.S. 20-28.2(d).
