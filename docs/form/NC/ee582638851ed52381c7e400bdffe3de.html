STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA

Name(s) By Which Individual To Be Searched May Be Known

IN THE MATTER OF

In The General Court Of Justice
Before The Clerk

CRIMINAL RECORD SEARCH

G.S. 7A-109, -308(a)(17), -343(3)

REQUEST FOR CERTIFIED CRIMINAL RECORD SEARCH

 For DMV Hearing

I request that the Clerk of Superior Court conduct a search of the official records in the courts of the county named above and certify the 
results of that search for the name(s) listed above. In making this request I understand and acknowledge that:

1.   THE CLERK WILL SEARCH THE RECORDS FOR ONLY THE COUNTY NAMED ABOVE. THIS IS NOT A STATEWIDE 

RECORD SEARCH. 
NOTE TO REQUESTOR: No court official in North Carolina can provide a certified, statewide record search. For searches on your own record, 
you can obtain a fingerprint-based statewide search from the State Bureau of Investigation. 

2.   I am requesting a search of (check all that apply)     

 criminal records.     
NOTE TO REQUESTOR: Infractions in North Carolina are non-criminal violations of the law. A finding of responsibility for an infraction is 
not a conviction of a crime. A search for a defendant’s complete record requires a search for both, because many categories of offenses like 
motor vehicle offenses include both criminal offenses and infractions. But if you are interested only in records of criminal offenses, a search for 
infractions is not necessary. Note that electronic infraction records are purged five (5) years after final disposition.

 infraction records.  

3.   Juvenile records will not be provided in the results of a criminal record search. Juvenile records in North Carolina are confidential, 

so the Clerk cannot disclose whether or not any person has such a record.

4.   The name(s) listed above are all the names by which, to my knowledge, the individual for whom I am requesting this search may 

be known.

5.  The Clerk will search for records under all those names, but only for records under those names.
6.   Court records are indexed by name only and not by any other identifying characteristics. 
7.   The fact that no criminal record is found under the name(s) listed above does not mean that the individual does not have a record 
in this county. The individual may have a record under another name, or records may exist that are not subject to disclosure, such 
as records sealed by the court or warrants for arrest that are not yet returned to the Clerk’s office.

8.   The fact that a criminal record is found under one or more of those names does not mean that the record is a record for the 

individual for whom I am requesting this search; the record may be that of another individual with the same or a similar name.

9.   I am solely responsible for any interpretation and use I make of the results of this search and I understand the Clerk is not 

responsible for my interpretation or use of the results.

Name And Address Of Requestor (Including City, State and Zip Code)

Signature Of Requestor

CERTIFICATION

NOTE TO CLERK:  If request is for a DMV Hearing, search both criminal and infraction records, regardless of the options selected in No. 2, above.
This is to certify that I have searched the indices to (check all that apply)     

 infractions      in this office from 

 criminal records     

 

 to the present and

  I have found that no record was indexed by the name(s) given above.
   I have found the following excerpt(s) from the public records indexed by the name(s) given above as appears in the attached  

 

 

 page(s).

   This search is limited as follows:

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
