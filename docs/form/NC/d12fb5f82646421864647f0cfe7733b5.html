Purpose
The purpose of the Voluntary Shared Leave Program is to provide Judicial Branch employees an opportunity to donate a portion of their 
accumulated leave to Judicial Branch and other state employees and for employees to receive leave who otherwise would be forced to 
go on leave without pay. 

Who Is Eligible?
Employees of the Judicial Branch who are in permanent positions that accrue leave in the BEACON Time System. To receive donated 
leave in this program, an employee must have regular appointment status; and have exhausted all available sick and approved leave 
before using donated leave. (The limitation and leave balance for regular part-time employees is prorated.) An employee on workers' 
compensation and employed for one year who is drawing weekly temporary total disability compensation may be eligible to participate in 
this program. Use of the donated leave under the Workers' Compensation Program would be limited to use with the supplemental leave 
schedule.  (Refer to Section 6 of the Personnel Management Manual).

Have a prolonged medical condition, (or a member of the employee's immediate family has a medical condition that requires the
employee's absence for a prolonged period of time), 
Apply for or be nominated to become a recipient, 
Produce medical evidence to support the need for leave beyond the available accumulated leave, and  
Be approved by the Hiring Authority.

l l l l

In order to receive voluntary shared leave, an employee must have complied with existing leave rules and

Prolonged medical condition - The condition of an employee or family member of an employee that requires the employee's 
absence from duty for a period of at least 20 consecutive workdays, and that without paid leave would create a severe financial 
hardship. If the employee has had a previous absence, or if the employee has had a previous but different prolonged medical 
condition within the last twelve months, an exception to the 20-day period may be made.

VOLUNTARY SHARED LEAVE PROGRAM

Non-Qualifying Reasons
Employees who receive disability benefits from the Disability Income Plan of North Carolina (DIPNC) are not eligible to participate in the 
Voluntary Shared Leave Program. Shared leave, however, may be used during the required 60-day waiting period and following the 
waiting period provided DIPNC benefits have not begun. Also, this program does not apply to short-term or sporadic conditions of 
illnesses that are common, expected, or anticipated. These examples are illustrative, but not all inclusive. Each situation must be 
examined and decided on a case-by-case basis and must be handled consistently and equitably.

How To Apply
An employee seeking shared leave shall apply or be nominated by another employee. Requests for participation in the Voluntary Shared
Leave Program should include a doctor's statement which certifies that the medical condition requires the employee be absent to provide
care that is not otherwise available. Section II should only be completed if employee is not applying for Family Medical Leave (FMLA) or 
Family Illness Act (FIL). The Human Resources Division will consult with the Hiring Authority to determine the period of eligibility. The 
Hiring Authority and employee will be notified in writing of the decision. 

How much leave can a recipient receive?
The amount of leave a recipient may receive is 1040 hours (prorated for part-time employees), either continuously or, if for the same 
condition, on a recurring basis. However, the NCAOC Human Resources may grant continuation, on a month-to-month basis, to a 
maximum of 2080 hours, if the hiring authority would have otherwise granted leave without pay. 

Bonus
The minimum amount of bonus leave that 
may be donated is four hours.
The maximum amount may not reduce the 
donor's bonus leave account below 0 
hours.
Amounts are prorated for part-time 
employees.

Sick

The minimum amount of sick leave that 
may be donated is 4 hours.
The maximum amount of sick leave that 
may be donated is:

is 1040 hours, but
may not reduce the sick leave account 
below 40 hours

ll

How Much Leave Can Be Donated?
Vacation

The minimum is 4 hours. The maximum 
amount of vacation leave that may be 
donated:

May not be more than the amount of the
donor's annual accrual rate, and
May not reduce the donor's vacation 
leave balance below one-half of the 
annual vacation leave accrual rate.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
