      <pre>GUARDIANSHIP  LAW  IN  NORTH CAROLINA
for
General Guardians - Guardians of the Person-Guardians of the Estate

IMPORTANT

•

•

•

•

•

The Clerk of Superior Court in all 100 counties in North Carolina serves as
the judge of probate and cannot practice law or give legal advice. Therefore,
you should not ask the clerk or the clerk’s staff to prepare your petitions,
orders or accounts or to advise you on the completion of forms or any legal
issue.

You must keep accurate records of the ward’s accounts and investments.

You must file timely and accurate accountings.

You must use the ward’s money for his or her own needs and not for yourself
or anyone else.

Court costs and fees must be paid to the Clerk of Superior Court. You will be
informed about the amounts by the clerk’s office.

DEFINITIONS

1. Guardian is the person (or corporation) who has the fiduciary duty and
responsibility for caring for the ward’s person and/or estate.  Also, state
agencies may be appointed as a disinterested public agent guardian.

2. Guardian ad litem is a person appointed by the Clerk of Superior Court to
represent the ward if the ward does not have an attorney. The Guardian ad
litem must be an attorney.

3. Fiduciary is a person who has a duty to act primarily for another person’s

benefit.

4.   Fiduciary duty is like a trust (promise), in which in the fiduciary is to protect
the interest of ward, by managing the ward’s estate, preserving the ward’s
assets in secure investments, or providing for the ward’s shelter, food and
health care. A fiduciary may not do anything which could appear to be for the
fiduciary’s own interest.

5. Law regarding guardians is found in Chapter 35A of the North Carolina

General Statutes. The North Carolina General Statutes can be found at most
public libraries, law schools and on-line at www.ncleg.net.

6. Ward  is  the  person  who  has  been  declared  incompetent  (or  a  minor).
[G.S. §35A-1202(15)] The ward is called the respondent at the incompetency
proceeding stage.

7. Clerk means the clerk of superior court.

1

This pamphlet is provided as a public service to assist persons who
have been or are about to be appointed guardians in understanding
their duties, responsibilities and role. It is not meant as substitute
for legal advice. You should contact  an attorney should you
have any legal questions about the role of a guardian.

PRINCIPLES FOR THE GUARDIAN

The Guardian must:

needs of the ward.

1. Ensure that the loyalty and duty of the guardian are to the “actual”

2. Make decisions that ensure the health and well being of the ward.

3.

Involve the person in all decision-making to the extent possible,
consistent with the ward’s ability.

4. Ensure that the need for guardianship is periodically reviewed and

alternatives, including restoration to competency or limited guardian-
ship, are considered.

PRINCIPLES FOR THE WARD

1. The Ward should be involved in all decision making to the extent

possible, consistent with the ward’s ability.

2. The Ward has the right to petition the court for periodic review of the

guardianship, including restoration to competency,

3. The Ward is entitled to a guardian ad litem who represents the

expressed interest of the Ward in the guardianships proceedings, and
may make recommendations to the clerk concerning the best
interests of the Ward, if those interests differ from the expressed
interests. [G.S. 35A-1107]

TYPES OF GUARDIANS

1. Guardian of the Estate:  A guardian appointed solely for the

purpose of managing the property, estate, and business affairs of a
ward. [G.S. 35A-1202(9)]

2

2. Guardian of the Person:  A guardian appointed solely for the purpose
of performing duties relating to the care, custody, and control of a
ward. The guardian of the person does not handle any of the ward’s
money or property.  [G.S. 35A-1202(10)]

3. General Guardian:  A guardian of both the estate and the person.

[G.S. 35A-1202(7)]

4. NOTE:  The powers and duties of the guardian may be limited by the
order of appointment.    See ‘Powers and Duties of the Guardian’.

SPECIAL  CONSIDERATIONS – GUARDIANS  FOR  MINORS

1. Children under the age of 18 are presumed to be incompetent by law,
so there is no need for an incompetency proceeding before appointing
a guardian. However, a hearing is required. A parent or other person
may be appointed guardian of the estate of the minor.

2. A guardian of the person may be appointed only if the minor has no
living parents, or the rights of the parents have been terminated.
[G.S. 35A-1224(a)]

3. A minor’s funds SHOULD NOT be used by the minor’s parents

(acting as appointed guardians) for maintenance (food, shelter,
clothing) and education of the minor, since the parents are legally
obligated to pay for their children’s maintenance and education until
the children reach age 18.  Should a parent/guardian be unable to
provide for the minor’s basic maintenance needs the guardian may
petition the Clerk for permission to use some of the minor’s funds for
those needs. The Clerk, however, has total discretion in determining
whether the request should be granted.   See “Prohibited Acts Of All
Guardians”.

4. A minor’s real property may not be sold unless the guardian of the
estate or the general guardian petitions the court in advance, and a
court order is entered approving the sale. A guardian of the estate or
general guardian, without court order, may sell up to $5,000 of the
ward’s personal property in any one accounting period and report the
sale and the use of the proceeds on the next annual accounting. A
guardian of the estate or general guardian may not sell more than
$5,000 of the ward’s personal property in any one accounting period
without petitioning the court in advance and obtaining a court order
approving the sale. See ‘Property, Investments and Verifications.’

5. There are special duties and limitations on the types of property or
investments that a guardian may make on behalf of a minor. See
“Property, Investment and Verification”.

3

6. There are special requirements regarding the duty of a guardian to
file an inventory of the minor’s property with the court, and to file
annual accountings regarding all income, disbursements, distribu-
tions, investments and/or balances or property held or invested on
behalf of the minor.   See “Accountings”.

7. When a minor ward reaches 18 years of age (or is sooner emanci-
pated by marriage or court order) the guardianship shall terminate.
[G.S. 35A-1295, 1202(12)]  The guardian shall file a final account-
ing with the Clerk of Superior Court within 60 days of the termina-
tion. Any remaining assets of the estate must be paid to the former
minor and a receipt should be obtained from the former minor and
filed with the final accounting in the guardianship.  See “Termina-
tion of Guardianship”.

APPOINTMENT  AND  DUTIES  OF  GUARDIANS

All guardians are bound by the law and must abide by their fiduciary
duties to protect the interests of the ward. Specific duties of a guardian
depend on what type of guardianship (i.e., estate, person or general) was
created.

1. Qualification As Guardian

(a) Application to Qualify

A person who seeks to serve as a guardian for an incompetent
or a minor must apply to the Clerk of Superior Court of the
county of residence of the minor or incompetent, or where the
incompetent is an inpatient, on a form provided by the clerk’s
office. The form calls for a preliminary inventory of all assets
and liabilities of the ward. Therefore, the applicant will need to
have a general knowledge of the ward’s real estate, bank
accounts, stocks, bonds, motor vehicles, and other personal
property, an estimated value of these assets, and estimated
amount of the ward’s debts (mortgages, taxes, credit cards, etc.)
to complete the application. The instructions for that form
should assist you in completing the form. [G.S. 35A-1210, 1251
(incompetents); 35A-1221, 1225 (minors)]. [Forms -Applica-
tion for Letters of Guardianship of the Estate, Guardianship of
the Person, General Guardianship for an Incompetent Person,
AOC-E-206 or Application for Appointment of Guardianship of
the Estate, Guardianship of the Person, General Guardianship
for a Minor,
A0C-E-208.]

4

(b) Qualified Persons (to serve as guardian for an incompetent)

The Clerk of Superior Court will grant letters of guardianship to a
person(s) or corporation who applies and is qualified to serve, in the
following order:

(1)    An adult individual

If the individual is not a North Carolina resident, he or she must
agree to submit to the jurisdiction of North Carolina courts and
appoint a resident process agent.

(2) A corporation if its corporate charter authorizes the corporation
to serve as a guardian or in other similar fiduciary capacities;

(3) A disinterested public agent (Director of the local Social
Services, Health or Mental Health Departments, etc.).
[G.S. 35A-1213,1214]

(c) Qualified Persons (to serve as guardian for a minor)

(1)    An adult individual

a.  must appoint a resident process agent if serving as General

Guardian or Guardian of the Estate and is not a resident of North
Carolina. [G.S. 35A-1230]

(2)    A corporation if its corporate charter authorizes the corporation
to serve as a guardian or in other similar fiduciary capacities.
[G.S. 35A-1224]

(d) Disqualified persons

(e) Oath (Affirmation)

No person may serve as a guardian who in the opinion of the clerk
would not look out for the best interest of the ward. [G.S. 35A-1214]

All guardians must take an oath (or affirmation) in which the guard-
ian swears (or affirms) to faithfully and honestly discharge the duties
of the guardian to the best of the guardian’s ability and according to
law.  [Forms-Oath, AOC-E-400]

(f) Bond

When serving as a General Guardian or Guardian of the Estate, the
guardian must post a bond, approved by the clerk, to secure the
faithful performance of the guardian’s duties. There are some limited
circumstances in which a bond may be reduced based on a
dispository aggreement approved by the clerk. The Clerk of Superior
Court also has the discretion to require a bond for non-resident
guardian of the person. [G.S. 35A-1230]. [Forms-Bond, AOC-E-401]

5

(g) Orders

(h) Letters

The clerk may, with or without a hearing, authorize letters of
guardianship to be issued to the named fiduciary (guardian). [G.S.
35A-1213, 1214, 1215, 1226].  [Forms-Order on Application for
Appointment of Guardian, AOC-E-406; Order Authorizing
Issuance of Letters,  AOC-E-402]

The clerk will issue letters to the person who is appointed
guardian. The letters are the guardian’s proof of authority to act
on behalf of the ward. (See above for definitions of different
types of guardianships).  [Forms-Letters of Appointment,
Guardian of the Estate, AOC-E-407; Guardian of the Person,
AOC-E-408; General Guardian, AOC-E-413]

2. Powers and Duties of Guardian

(a) Guardian of the Estate

Unless limited by court order, the Guardian of the Estate has the
general power to “perform in a reasonable and prudent manner
every act that a reasonable and prudent person would perform
incident to the collection, preservation, management, and use of
the ward’s estate to accomplish the desired result of administering
the ward’s estate legally and in the ward’s best interest….” The
complete listing of powers can be found in G.S. 35A-1251 and
1253 (Incompetent) and G.S. 35A-1252 and 1253 (Minor).

In addition to duties imposed by law or by order of the clerk, the
guardian of the Estate also has the duty to take possession, for
the ward’s use, of the ward’s estate, to collect monies due the
ward, to pay debts of the ward including taxes, to obey all lawful
orders of the court and to observe the standard of judgment and
care that an ordinary prudent person serving as a fiduciary would
take in acquiring and maintaining the ward’s property.

(b) Guardian of the Person

Unless limited by court order, a guardian of the person has
custody of the ward and is responsible for making provisions for
the ward’s care, including medical and psychological treatment;
comfort, including shelter; and maintenance, including education,
training, and employment. [G.S. 35A-1241]  If the ward has
written advance instructions for the ward’s medical or mental
health care, the guardian should honor those instructions.

6

(c) General Guardian

Unless otherwise limited by court order, a General Guardian has all the
powers and duties of a guardian of the estate and guardian of the
person.  [G.S.35A-1202(7)]
NOTE:  The powers and duties of the guardians referenced in sub-
paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) may be limited by court order allowing the
ward to retain certain designated rights and responsibilities.

3. Property, Investments and Verifications

(a) Property

The ward’s property, real and personal, must be maintained in such a
manner to ensure the ward has a place to live or money with which to
pay for his or her living expenses. The guardian must maintain an
accurate accounting of the ward’s property, income, expenses and
disbursements.

To the extent possible, only the ward’s income (rather than any
portion of the principal) should be used to pay for his or her care. The
guardian of the estate or general guardian must petition the clerk in
advance should real property need to be sold to pay for the ward’s
needs, or if more than $5,000 of the ward’s personal property needs to
be sold in any one accounting period to pay for the ward’s needs.

(b) Investments

The ward’s funds shall be invested in interest bearing accounts or
other approved investment accounts [G.S. 35A-1251; 1252] in the
name of the ward, and showing the name of the guardian who is
acting on behalf of the ward. The guardian must properly manage the
funds to ensure money is available to pay for the ward’s needs, such
as shelter, food, clothing and medical care.
NOTE:  Failure to properly manage and secure the ward’s funds
may result in personal liability for the guardian’s breach of
fiduciary duty.  Investment of the ward’s funds in securities or
other investment devices that subject those funds to loss of
principal, may, under the reasonable prudent man rule, subject
the guardian to personal liability for breach of fiduciary duty.

(c) Verifications

The guardian must maintain cancelled checks and receipts of all
expenditures, and provide them to the clerk with each accounting,
together with bank statements, titles, or other documentary evidence
of balances still held or invested.

7

4. Miscellaneous  Responsibilities

(a) Promptly notify the clerk if you change your name or address.

(b) Promptly notify the clerk if you change the residence of the

ward.

5. Prohibited Acts of all Guardians

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

The real and personal property of the ward may not be used
for anything or anyone other than the ward.
The money belonging to the ward must be kept separate
from the personal funds of the guardian. The guardian
should appear on any guardianship account as acting on
behalf of the ward. The guardian should not be listed on
any such account as a joint account holder with or without
right of survivorship, or as a payee on death.
The guardian may not borrow money from the ward or loan
the ward’s money to anyone unless ordered by the court.
The guardian shall not write any checks for “cash” unless
regular cash distributions to the ward are authorized by the
court.
The ward’s real property may not be sold unless the sale is
ordered in advance by the court. A guardian of the estate or
general guardian, without court approval, may not sell more
than $5,000 of the ward’s personal property in any one
accounting period.
The ward’s real property may not be sold unless the general
guardian or the guardian of the estate files a special
proceeding seeking authority and approval of the court in
advance.
If the general guardian or guardian of the estate wishes to
sell personal property of the ward, during any one account-
ing period, which has a value of over $5,000.00, the guard-
ian must file a motion in the estate proceeding seeking
authority and approval by the court, prior to the sale. Sales
of less than $5,000.00 in value during any one accounting
period do not need prior court approval, and need only be
reported on the next annual accounting.

• Minor’s funds should not be used by the minors parents for
maintenance (food, shelter, clothing) and education of the
minor, since the parents are legally obligated to pay for their
children’s maintenance and education until the children
reach age 18. Should a parent or guardian be unable to
provide for the minor’s basic maintenance needs the
guardian may petition the Clerk for permission to use some
of the minor’s funds for those needs. The clerk, however,
has total discretion in determining whether the request
should be granted.
The minor’s property must be delivered to the minor once
the minor has reached 18 and the clerk has approved the
final accounting.

• Guardian may not consent to have the ward sterilized. A
ward may only be sterilized when medically necessary
treatment for an illness may result in sterilization and that
treatment is approved by the clerk.

•

EXPENSES, REIMBURSEMENTS AND COMMISSIONS

1. Allowable Expenses and Reimbursements

The Clerk may approve certain expenses of the guardian to be reimbursed
from the ward’s estate, such as bond premiums and court costs.
[G.S. 35A-1267]

If the ward is living with the guardian or some other person, the Clerk may
also approve payment to the guardian or other person to pay the ward’s
share of the household expenses, food and other necessary items.

2. Commissions (Applies only to Guardians of the Estate and General

Guardians)
The guardian may receive a commission for the guardian’s time and
trouble in handling of the ward’s estate. The amount or method of com-
pensation is set by the Clerk of Superior Court, in the clerk’s discretion,
up to, but not to exceed five percent (5%) of the qualified estate receipts
and disbursements. [NOTE:  Any commissions with respect to principal
are allocated (divided) over the time remaining in the estate (i.e., the
number of years until the minor reaches age 18, or the remaining life
expectancy of the incompetent calculated under G.S. 8-46).] The clerk will
consider the time, responsibility, trouble, and skill involved in the manage-
ment of the estate. Commissions to guardians are accounted for as costs
and expenses of administration. The commission is to cover any ordinary
expenses, such as telephone, mailing, and travel, incurred by the guardian
in performing the duties of the guardian, as well as paying the guardian for
his or her services in managing the estate. In limited circumstances, the
clerk may approve additional reimbursement for out of pocket expenses.
The guardian must petition the Clerk for approval of a commission or
additional reimbursement for out of pocket expenses before making
distribution of that commission. [G.S. 35A-1269]

3. Attorney’s Fees  (Applies only to Guardians of the Estate and General

Guardians)

The guardian may choose to hire an attorney to represent the estate.
However, the funds of the estate may not be used to pay the attorney’s fee
unless the clerk finds that the fee is reasonable. Unless the attorney’s
services are beyond the normal scope of estate administration, the
attorney’s fees allowed may reduce the amount of the guardian’s commis-
sion. Not all attorney’s fees may be approved by the clerk and if not
allowed, the guardian will be personally responsible for the attorney’s
fees.

ACCOUNTINGS

(Applies only to Guardians of the Estate and General Guardians)

1. Types of Accountings

(a) Inventory [Inventory For Guardianship Estate, AOC-E-510]

 Within three (3) months from the date of qualification, the
guardian must file with the Clerk of Superior Court’s office an
accurate inventory of the ward’s estate, giving descriptions and
values of all real and personal property owned by the ward as of
the date of qualifying. The guardian should obtain copies of
signature cards and deposit contracts associated with any joint
accounts from the depository financial institution and submit
them with the inventory. [G.S. 35A-1261]  Property discovered
later must be reported on a supplemental inventory. [G.S. 35A-
1263.1]  Income of the ward’s estate (e.g., pension payments,
interest, social security, etc.), property later acquired by the
estate, or asset conversions (e.g., sale of real estate or stock,
foreclosure of deed of trust, etc.) must be reported on the next
annual accounting.

(b) Annual Accounting [Account, AOC-E-506]

The guardian must file an annual accounting no later than thirty
(30) days after the expiration of one year from the date on which
he or she qualified to serve. The accounting may be filed earlier.
The guardian must then file annual accounts every year thereafter
until the final accounting is filed. [G.S. 35A-1264]

(c) Final Accounting [Account, AOC-E-506]

The guardian must file a final accounting within sixty (60) days
after the termination of the guardianship. [G.S. 35A-1266]

2. Proofs

All accountings must be accompanied by cancelled checks or other
proof satisfactory to the clerk for all disbursements and distributions,
and for all balances held or invested (e.g., bank or brokerage state-
ment showing balance held, vehicle title, recorded deed to real estate,
etc.). [G.S. 35A-1268]

10

3. Contents Of Accountings

All accountings filed with the Clerk of Superior Court must be signed
under oath and contain:

(a) The period which the account covers and whether it is an annual

accounting or final accounting;

(b) The amount and value of the property of the estate according to the
inventory and appraisal, or according to the previous accounting;
the manner and nature of any investments; the amount of income
and additional property received during the accounting period; and
all gains or losses from the sale of any property or otherwise;

(c) All payments, charges, losses, and distributions;

(d) The property on hand constituting the balance of the estate, if any;

(e) Any other facts and information determined by the clerk to be

necessary to an understanding of the account.  [G.S. 35A-1264, 1266]

4. Failure to File Accountings

If the guardian fails to account as required, or if he or she renders an
unsatisfactory account, the Clerk of Superior Court may, after notice,
issue an order for the guardian to appear and show cause as to why she
or he failed to file an inventory or account. If, within 20 days after
service of such an order, she or he does not make the required filing, the
clerk may have the sheriff serve the guardian with an order of contempt
and commitment, and the sheriff will place the guardian in the county
jail until she or he complies with the order. The guardian shall be
personally liable for all costs associated with such proceedings. The
clerk may also remove the guardian from office and appoint someone
else to complete the administration of the estate. [G.S. 35A-1265]

TERMINATION OF GUARDIANSHIP

1. Resignation or Death of Guardian

(a) Resignation

A guardian who wishes to resign, must petition the Clerk of
Superior Court for an order authorizing the resignation.
[G.S. 35A-1292] The clerk may approve the resignation upon
approval of a final account.

11

Upon the death of a guardian, the clerk will appoint a successor guardian
following the same procedure for the initial appointment.
[G.S. 35A-1293]

  (b)   Death

2. Removal

(a) Mandatory

The clerk must remove a guardian or take other action when the guardian
has been adjudged incompetent, has been convicted of a felony, was
initially unqualified, fails to renew a bond, fails to file accountings, fails to
obey any citation, notice or process served on the guardian or the
guardian’s process agent, or the clerk finds the guardian to be unsuitable to
continue serving. The complete listing of bases for mandatory removal is
found at G.S. 35A-1290(c).

(b) Discretionary

(c)  Emergency

(d) Interim Orders

The clerk may remove a guardian or take other action when the clerk
determines that the guardian has mismanaged or wasted the ward’s money
or estate, neglected to provide care for the ward, violated a fiduciary duty
or has become insolvent. The complete listing of bases for discretionary
removal is found at G.S. 35A-1290(a) and (b).

The clerk may remove a guardian without a hearing upon finding
reasonable cause to believe an emergency exists that threatens the well
being of the ward or the ward’s estate.

When a guardian is removed the clerk may make such interim orders as
the clerk finds necessary for the protection of the ward or ward’s estate.

3. Restoration to Competency

When a ward’s competency is restored (See, Restoration below) the guardian-
ship shall terminate and a final accounting must be filed within sixty (60) days.
[G.S. 35A-1295]

4.     Death of the Ward

Upon the death of the ward, guardianship shall terminate and a final accounting
must be filed within sixty (60) days. [G.S. 35A-1295]  Any remaining assets of
the estate must be paid to the personal representative of the estate of the
deceased ward and a receipt should be obtained from the personal representa-
tive and filed with the final accounting in the guardianship.

5. Minor Reaches Majority

When a minor ward reaches 18 years of age (or is sooner emancipated by
marriage or court order) the guardianship shall terminate. [G.S. 35A-1295,
1202(12)] The guardian shall file a final accounting with the Clerk of Superior
Court within 60 days of the termination. Any remaining assets of the estate must
be paid to the former minor and a receipt should be obtained from the former
minor and filed with the final accounting in the guardianship.

RESTORATION TO COMPETENCY

1. Petition

2. Hearing

A guardian, ward, or other interested person may file a petition (as a
motion in the cause) with the Clerk of Superior Court for partial or full
restoration of the ward’s competency. The petition must be served on the
ward and guardian. There is no AOC form for this proceeding. No
petition or proceeding is required for a minor reaching the age of 18.

The clerk will schedule and hold a hearing to consider evidence of the
ward’s competency.

3 Guardian ad litem  or attorney

The ward is entitled to be represented at the hearing by an attorney or the
clerk will appoint a guardian ad litem attorney.

4. Order

(a) Full restoration.

If the clerk finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the ward is
competent, the clerk will enter an order restoring the ward to
competency. The ward may then handle his or her own affairs and
enter into contracts as if he or she had never been adjudicated
incompetent.

(b) Alternative to full restoration

If the clerk finds that the ward is able to make some of his own
decisions, the clerk may enter an order changing the guardianship to
a limited guardianship. A limited guardianship permits the ward to
have input into or to make certain decisions, such as housing and
medical care, as designated by the clerk.

(c) Against restoration.

If the clerk finds there is insufficient evidence to restore the ward’s
competency, the clerk will enter an order to that effect. The guardian
of the ward will continue to serve. [G.S. 35A-1130]

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
