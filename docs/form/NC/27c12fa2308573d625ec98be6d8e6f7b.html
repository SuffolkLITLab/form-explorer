TO EACH OF THE RESPONDENT(S) NAMED ABOVE:
You are summoned and notified to answer the attached petition in which the petitioner asks the Court to terminate the parental rights of the above 
named parent(s) to the above named juvenile. Any written answer to the petition must be filed within thirty (30) days after service on you of this 
summons and a copy of the petition. A copy of the answer must also be served on the petitioner or his/her lawyer.
The Court will conduct a hearing to determine whether one or more grounds alleged in the petition for terminating parental rights exist. If the Court finds 
that one or more grounds exist, the Court will proceed at that hearing or a later hearing to determine whether parental rights should be terminated. 
Notice of the date, time and location of the hearing will be mailed to you by the petitioner after you file an answer or thirty (30) days from the date of
service if you do not file an answer.

ADDITIONAL NOTICE TO THE PARENT(S) NAMED ABOVE:
If you do not file a written answer to the attached petition with the Clerk of Superior Court within thirty (30) days, the Court may terminate your parental 
rights.

You have a right to be represented by a lawyer in this case. If you want a lawyer and cannot afford one, the Court will appoint a lawyer for you. If you are
represented by a lawyer appointed previously in an abuse, neglect or dependency case, that lawyer will continue to represent you unless the Court 
orders otherwise. If you are not represented by a lawyer and want a court appointed lawyer, you are encouraged to contact immediately the following 
lawyer who has been temporarily assigned to represent you. At the first hearing, the Court will determine whether you qualify for a court-appointed 
lawyer. If you do not qualify, the lawyer named below will be released. (NOTE: If a lawyer is appointed for you and if the Court terminates your parental 
rights, you may become liable for repayment of the lawyer's fees, and a judgment for the amount of the fees may be entered against you.)
You are entitled to attend any hearing affecting your parental rights. As described above, the petitioner will mail you notice of the date, time, and location 
of the hearing.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
