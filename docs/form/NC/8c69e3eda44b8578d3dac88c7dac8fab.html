I. COVERAGE:     These rules are applicable only to North Carolina District Court, Superior Court, and Court of Appeals Judges and to the Chief Justice and Associate 

Justices of the Supreme Court of North Carolina, including retired judges and justices qualified as emergency or recalled judges or justices.

 

 

 

 

  Upon leaving judicial service, a judge or justice shall be bound by the rules of the Supreme Court of North Carolina for continuing legal education of 
members of the Bar. 

  Continuing legal education hours earned prior to entering judicial service and judicial education hours earned prior to leaving judicial service shall be 
recognized and accepted on a pro rata basis by the appropriate accrediting and reporting agency.

II. REQUIREMENTS: 
 
Every judge in the trial division shall, within the first year after appointment or election, attend a course of instruction or orientation for new judges provided by the 
 
Administrative Office of the Courts. Attendance will be counted as a part of the hours of instruction required for the biennium in which the instruction is received.

A. 

 
Each judge and justice of the trial and appellate division shall attend at least thirty (30) hours of instruction in one or more approved continuing legal or judicial 
education programs in each biennium, effective with the biennium beginning 1 July 1989 and ending 30 June 1991.

 
At least fifteen (15) of the thirty (30) hours required shall be continuing judicial education courses designed especially for judges and attended exclusively or 
primarily by judges. All Superior Court Judges are expected to attend the scheduled Superior Court Judges Conferences and the programs there presented. All 
District Court Judges are expected to attend the scheduled District Court Judges Conferences and the programs there presented.

 
For District Court Judges designated as Family Court Judges, at least twenty-four (24) of the thirty (30) hours shall be continuing judicial education courses 
designed especially for Family Court.

D. 

 
Judges participating as teachers, lecturers, discussion leaders, or panelists in an approved continuing judicial or legal education program shall receive five hours 
credit for each hour of actual presentation time. Presentation of the same material on subsequent occasions shall accrue credit for the actual time of presentation only. 

E. 

Continuing judicial education hours shall be computed by the following formula: SUM OF THE TOTAL MINUTES OF ACTUAL INSTRUCTION/60=TOTAL HOURS
 

 
The instruction may be in no less than fifteen (15) minute segments. Only actual instruction shall be included in computing the total hours of instruction. The 
following shall not be included: introductory remarks, breaks, business meetings, keynote speeches, and speeches in connection with meals.

 
Except as otherwise provided in this subsection E and the preceding subsection D, computation for credit of continuing legal education courses shall be computed 
in accordance with Regulation 5 of the Board of Continuing Legal Education of the North Carolina State Bar.

III. ACCREDITED SPONSORS:
 

A. 

 
Continuing legal education programs offered by the Conference of Superior Court Judges or the Conference of District Court Judges or others offered to judges 
by the Administrative Office of the Courts or the Institute of Government of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are approved for credit as continuing 
judicial education under these rules.

 
All continuing legal education programs approved by the Board of Continuing Legal Education of the North Carolina State Bar are approved for credit as 
continuing legal education under these rules.

 
Programs offered for judges by any law school accredited by the American Bar Association and the following national providers of judicial education are approved 
for credit as continuing legal education under these rules:

 
1.  National Judicial College 
2.  American Academy of Judicial Education 
3.  National Council of Juvenile And Family Court Judges 
4.  American Bar Association 

Institute for Court Management of the National Center for State Courts 
Institute of Judicial Administration 

5. 
6. 
7.  National Institute of Justice 
8.  American Judges Association

D.  Postgraduate law degree programs conducted by a law school accredited by the American Bar Association.

E. 

 
Any program not approved under A, B, C, or D above may be approved by the Chief Justice upon application by a judge who has attended or desires to attend the 
program. To be approved, a program must meet the following standards:

1. 
2. 

It must be an organized program of learning which contributes directly to the professional competency of a judge.
 
It must deal primarily with matter directly related to law or related fields or to the professional responsibility, administrative duties, or ethical obligations of a 
judge.
Instructors in the program must be qualified by practical or academic experience to teach in the topic or area of discipline covered by the course.

3. 
4.  Thorough, high quality, written topic materials and/or outlines must be distributed to judges attending the program.

IV. REPORTING:
A. 
 

 
The Administrative Office of the Courts is designated as the office in which all records, reports, and documents pertaining to continuing judicial education shall be 
filed and compiled.

 
Each judge must report in writing to the Administrative Office of the Courts, no later than July 31 following the end of each year of an educational biennium, the 
education programs he has attended. Reports may be made sooner after attendance, and the Administrative Office of the Courts will maintain a cumulative record 
of such reports for the submitting judges. One year after the beginning of each educational biennium, the Administrative Office of the Courts shall notify all judges 
and justices subject to these rules that reports are required and that they are due by the following July 31. If a program is other than a continuing judicial education 
program offered by the Conference of Superior Court Judges, the Conference of District Court Judges, or the Administrative Office of the Courts or the Institute 
of Government, the judge must attach a copy of the program brochure or other material which outlines the program presentation and identifies the instructors, 
unless the program is certified as having previously received approval of the Chief Justice, pursuant to Section III.E. Forms for the report will be provided by the 
Administrative Office of the Courts. 

 
As soon as practical after August 1 of the second year of each educational biennium, the Administrative Office of the Courts shall notify any judge or justice in 
writing of his or her delinquency. Any such delinquent judge or justice shall have sixty (60) days within which to comply with the requirements of these rules and 
notify the Administrative Office of the Courts of his or her compliance.

 
The Director of the Administrative Office of the Courts shall report to the Chief Justice the name of any judge or justice who does not meet the continuing judicial 
education requirements specified in these rules or who has not filed a timely report of his or her continuing judicial education activities, and the Chief Justice shall 
make such inquiry or investigation and take such action as he deems appropriate.

V. EXEMPTIONS:  The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall have the authority to relieve any judge or justice of the requirement of meeting the minimum hours required 

by these rules for undue hardship by reason of disability or other cause.

VI. EXPENSES:     The Administrative Office of the Courts shall fund the regular judicial conferences of the Judges of the Superior and District Court divisions and shall 

ensure that a sufficient number of hours of instructional material are provided to permit the judges of the trial division regularly attending the conferences 
to satisfy the requirement of this Order and shall provide reimbursement for expenses incurred in attending the conferences in accordance with its regular 
policies and practices.

 

 

 

 

 

 

  For Judges and Justices of the Appellate Division, the Administrative Office of the Courts shall ensure the availability of a sufficient number of hours 
of instruction to satisfy the requirements of the Order either by providing and funding Appellate Court conferences or providing funding for alternative 
methods of satisfying such requirements in accordance with its regular policies and practices.

  Judges and Justices attending continuing judicial education programs other than those presented at judicial conferences shall be reimbursed for their 
expenses in accordance with policies and practices established by the Administrative Office of the Courts, subject to the availability of funds.

  Priority in allocation of funds by the Administrative Office of the Courts will be given to the regular judicial conferences of the Superior Court and District 
Court divisions and to other continuing judicial education programs sponsored or co-sponsored by the Administrative Office of the Courts.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
