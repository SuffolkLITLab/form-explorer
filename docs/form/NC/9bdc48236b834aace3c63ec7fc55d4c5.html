AOC-G-260, Rev. 1/22, © 2022 Administrative Office of the CourtsCERTIFICATE OF VERIFICATION

  1.  I have searched the confidential file containing the names of all persons granted an expunction in North Carolina and certify that:

  there is no record of expunction of the case(s) identified above. 
NOTE: This response does not mean that no expunction occurred. Prior to October 1, 2010, some expunction statutes did not require reporting of the expunction to 
the NCAOC, so no record of those matters or their expunction remains in any official records of the courts or the NCAOC.
 attached to this Certificate is a copy of any order(s) of expunction for the case(s) identified above, as reported to the NCAOC.
  attached to this Certificate is a report from the confidential files of the NCAOC of the expunction of the case(s) identified above, for which there 
is no expunction order available, because the expunction occurred (i) prior to October 1, 2010, or (ii) by operation of law without a petition and 
order.

  2.   I further certify that notice to delete the expunged case(s) in question was delivered electronically to all private entities with which the NCAOC has 

licensing agreements for bulk extracts of criminal record data on ____________________ (date).

INSTRUCTIONS

NOTE TO APPLICANT: Read these instructions carefully. Records of expunctions are some of the most confidential records in the court system. The 
Administrative Office of the Courts (NCAOC) will not disclose information about expunctions except in strict compliance with G.S. 15A-151(a) and 15A-152. 
If the NCAOC receives an application that fails to comply with these instructions, there may be no response to the application.

  1.  If you have any questions about this application or its completion, you should consult an attorney. The staff at the NCAOC cannot 

provide legal advice and therefore cannot assist you with completion of this application.

  2.  The request on Side One must be sworn to or affirmed by the person whose record was expunged. It may not be signed by anyone 

else on that person’s behalf, including by an attorney representing that person.

  3.  You may not strike through or modify any item on Side One. All of the information and statements on Side One are required for a valid 

application. You need complete only one of the two APPLICATION sections on Side One. If you have any questions regarding which 
APPLICATION section applies to you, you should consult an attorney.

  4.  If you wish to submit an application electronically, the form is available electronically on the NCAOC’s website by visiting  

www.nccourts.gov/documents/forms. In the “Contains” field, enter the number of this form, AOC-G-260. 

  5.  After completion, this form may be filed electronically by sending an encrypted email of the completed form to the email address 

below. This form may also be printed and submitted manually by mailing to the address listed below. 

  6.  Print clearly and legibly, using only black ink. Applications with illegible information may not receive a response. A self-addressed 

stamped envelope must be included for all mailed applications to receive a response. Applications submitted by mail without a  
self-addressed stamped envelope may not receive a response. Electronically filed applications that are sent to the email address 
below will receive a response sent by encrypted email. If you wish to receive a hard copy response, you must submit the application 
by mail and include a self-addressed stamped envelope.

  7.  Provide complete information in every field on Side One. Identifying information such as drivers license information, date of birth, and 
social security number is critical to this application. If the staff of the NCAOC is unable to verify that a particular record of expunction 
pertains to the applicant, the NCAOC will respond that “there is no record of expunction” in order to avoid the risk of disclosing the 
expunction record of another person.

  8.  The specific county and file number are required for every case for which you are requesting verification of expunction. If multiple 

cases were expunged, you must provide the county and file number for every case for which you need verification. The NCAOC will 
provide verification of expunction only for cases specifically identified on Side One.

  9.  If you do not know the county or file number(s) of the case(s) expunged, the NCAOC and the clerk of superior court cannot help you 

find them. You must provide the file number from your own records or from the records of any attorney who may have represented you 
on the expunction petition or in the original case(s).

10.  If you are submitting this application for the purpose of pursuing a civil action against a private entity that has disclosed information 
 

about an expunged case(s) in violation of G.S. 15A-152 (in other words, if you are applying using the second APPLICATION section 
on Side One), then a copy of the private entity’s disclosure of information about the expunged case(s) must be submitted with the 
application.

11.  If you wish to receive a response to this application by email, you must provide a valid email address. If you wish to receive a 
 

response to this application by mail, you must include a self-addressed, stamped envelope with this application.

12.  DO NOT call the NCAOC to ask about this application. In order to avoid improper disclosure of information about expunged cases, the 
 
staff of the NCAOC will not discuss this application with anyone over the phone. The NCAOC will not even acknowledge the receipt of 
this application. There will be no exceptions. The only response to this application will be by encrypted email or by U.S. mail, using 
your self-addressed stamped envelope.

13. If you wish to receive the NCAOC’s verification by email, send the application to:

14. If you wish to receive the NCAOC’s response by mail, send the application and self-addressed stamped envelope to:

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
