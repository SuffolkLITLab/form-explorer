In Effect         

We, the undersigned, have agreed and consented to modify the current child support order in this case as follows:

Increase Or Decrease In Current Child Support.  The amount of child support payable by the obligor will be 
     increased            decreased to $                          per month beginning on the first day of
(month/year). The information shown on the attached child support worksheet is correct. The amount of child support 
agreed to above             was           was not   determined in accordance with the presumptive child support guidelines 
based on the attached child support worksheets. (Complete and attach a child support worksheet.)

Payment Of Child Support Arrearages. The parties acknowledge and agree that the obligor owes $
in past due child support as of                                                     (date) under the terms of the current support order. The 
obligor will continue to make current child support payments of $                                   per month beginning on the first 
day of                                         (month/year) under the current support order, plus an additional payment of 
$                              per month beginning on the first day of                                           (month/year) toward the accrued 
arrearage and continuing until arrearage is paid in full. The parties further understand and agree that the obligor's 
payment of arrearages under this Consent Order does not prevent the custodial parent/caretaker or the IV-D agency 
from taking other action, including request for income withholding and/or set-off of the obligor's federal or state income
tax refunds, to collect the past due child support owed by the obligor.

Health Insurance Coverage. The obligor agrees to provide health insurance coverage for the minor child(ren) under 
an employment related or group health insurance policy as shown below, and to provide written notice of any change 
in such health insurance coverage to the          IV-D agency         custodial parent/caretaker. If the obligor fails to 
obtain or maintain such health insurance coverage when it is available, the obligor will be liable for any medical 
expenses incurred from the date of this Consent Order that would have been covered by insurance if it had been in 
force.  

Name And Address Of Insurance Carrier

Employer/Group Name 

Policy No.

Medical Support.  The obligor agrees to reimburse the Division of Medical Assistance or the custodial parent/ 
caretaker for medical and/or dental expenses of the minor child(ren) as follows:

Temporary Suspension Of Support.  The obligor may temporarily suspend making child support payments under the
current support order         beginning                                          (date) and continuing until                                        (date) 
or          until further order of the court. (State reason for suspending child support payments.)

Temporary Change Of Physical Custody and Child Support Payments.  The obligor will have physical custody of 
the following minor child(ren):

Name(s)

Beginning Date

Ending Date

The obligor's child support obligation under the current support order is          suspended           decreased to
$                          per month beginning on the first day of                                                     (month/year). Regular child 
support payments under the current child support order are to resume on                                                      (first day of 
month).

Credit For Direct Payments.  The obligor will be given credit for $                                 which was paid directly to the 
custodial parent/caretaker or expended by the obligor on behalf of the minor children.

The above Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated by reference herein, is hereby approved by the Court, and shall have the 
same force and effect as an order for child support entered by this Court, and shall be enforceable and subject to modification in the 
same manner as is provided by law for orders of this Court entered in child support cases. 

If income withholding is in effect, the Clerk shall issue an Order/Notice To Withhold Income For Child Support (OMB-0970- 0154), 
reflecting the changes in this Order.

The Court finds that the amount of child support under this Agreement is:

the amount due under the presumptive child support guidelines based upon the incomes of the parents shown on the attached 
child support worksheets which are incorporated herein by reference
OR

reasonably based upon the needs of the child(ren) and the ability of the parent(s) to support the child(ren) and that deviation from 
the amount of child support calculated under the presumptive child support guidelines is appropriate because: (State reasons for 
deviation.)
