FINDINGS OF FACT
NOTE TO COURT: G.S. 15A-145.4(d) provides that the Court shall take the following steps in ruling upon a petition under that statute: (1) Call upon a probation 
officer for additional investigation or verification of the petitioner’s conduct during the four-year period since the date of conviction of the nonviolent felony in question; 
(2) Review the petitioner’s juvenile record, ensuring that the petitioner’s juvenile records remain separate from adult records and files and are withheld from public 
inspection; (3) Review the amount of restitution made by the petitioner to the victim of the nonviolent felony to be expunged and give consideration to whether or not 
restitution was paid in full; and (4) Review any other information the court deems relevant, including, but not limited to, affidavits or other testimony provided by law 
enforcement officers, district attorneys, and victims of nonviolent felonies committed by the petitioner. 
After a hearing on the petition/motion the Court makes the following findings of fact:

  1.  Petitioner was convicted of the nonviolent felony(ies) listed and in the file number(s) shown on Side One.

of other interested parties.

  3.   Petitioner has remained of good moral character and has been free of conviction of any felony or misdemeanor, other than a traffic violation, for four years from the date 

of conviction of the nonviolent felony(ies) listed or any active sentence, period of probation, or post-release supervision has been served, whichever was later. 

  4.   Petitioner has not previously been convicted of any felony or misdemeanor other than a traffic violation under the laws of the United States or the laws of this State or

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
