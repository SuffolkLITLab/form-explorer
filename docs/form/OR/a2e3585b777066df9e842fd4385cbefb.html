A.  Being Served with Copy of Notice of Appeal; “Designation of Record” 
 

1.  The appellant (or cross-appellant) must serve a copy of the notice of appeal 

on the transcript coordinator for the court from which the appeal is taken.  The 
notice of appeal usually contains a “designation of record” in which the party 
identifies all or part of the trial court record the party wants to be part of the 
record on appeal, including oral proceedings to be transcribed. 
 

2.  Sometimes an appellant (or cross-appellant) will file an amended notice of 

appeal or an amended designation for the purpose of changing the 
designation of record. 
 

3.  Where an appellant designates only part of the record, a respondent on 
appeal may file and serve a designation of additional parts of the record. 
 

4.  Sometimes the appellate court, by order, will order that the record on appeal 

be supplemented with a transcript of oral proceedings.  
 

B.  The transcript coordinator must review the designation of record part of the 
notice of appeal, or other designations of the record described in Part A, to 
determine whether the parties have designated (or the appellate court has 
ordered) all or part of the record of oral proceedings in the trial court as part of 
the record on appeal. 
 

C.  The transcript coordinator then must review the trial court register to determine 

whether the oral proceedings so designated were recorded by a court reporter or 
by audio or video recording equipment. 
 

5  Appellate Transcript Procedures 2017 

TRANSCRIPT COORDINATOR RESPONSIBILITIES 

   

The transcript coordinator serves a vital role in the timely processing of 
appeals.  Generally, the transcript is due within 30 days of the date the notice 
of appeal is filed with the appellate court.  It is important that the transcript 
coordinator carry out the responsibilities of that position promptly. 

 

eviewing Designation of Record Section of Notice of Appeal

.  If the oral proceedings were recorded by a court reporter, the transcript 

coordinator must assign responsibility to prepare a transcript of the proceedings 
to the court reporter. 

ote:  If the court reporter has retired or is otherwise unavailable, it may be 

necessary to arrange with another court reporter, using the former court 
reporter’s notes, to prepare the transcript. 

B.  If the oral proceedings were recorded by audio or video recording equipment, 
the transcript coordinator must select a transcriber from the list of transcribers 
maintained  by  the  Appellate  Court  Administrator.    That  list  is  found  at  this 
webpage:https://intranet.ojd.state.or.us/OJDIntra/docs/osca/acsd/transcriberc
ompliancelist.pdf 
 

  N

  A

Assigning Court Report to Prepare Transcript 

1.  Some court proceedings are confidential.  Before a transcriber is placed 
on the list by the State Court Administrator, the transcriber must sign a 
confidentiality agreement with OJD.  If you want to assign a transcript to 
someone who is not on the list, send them a copy of the confidentiality 
agreement, have them complete it, sign it, and send it to the Appellate 
Court Administrator via the appealsclerk@ojd.state.or.us mailbox.  After 
receipt of the completed form, the Appellate Court Administrator will add 
that person to the list.  
 

2.  The list shows transcribers statewide.  In selecting a transcriber, the 

transcript coordinator may choose any transcriber on the list. 
 

3.  Before choosing a transcriber, the transcript coordinator should consult 
the current Transcript Report.  The Transcript Report is found at this 
webpage:  
https://ojdsp/osca/acsd/TranscriberWorkload/Forms/AllItems.aspx This 
report shows the appellate cases already assigned to each transcriber, 
when those cases were assigned, and whether the transcripts have 
been finalized. If the list shows that a transcriber already has several 
transcripts assigned, especially if those are expedited cases, the 
transcript coordinator should consider whether the transcriber will be 
able to timely complete the transcript or whether the transcriber will have 

6  Appellate Transcript Procedures 2017 

 

to request one or more extensions of time, which ultimately delays the 
progress of the appeal.  Be aware that the report does not show the 
length of the transcripts assigned.  The “Proof of Filing” column on the 
report shows those transcripts that have been prepared but not yet 
submitted to the appellate court, pending completion of the transcript 
correction process. 
 

4.  The transcript coordinator may assign more than one transcriber to 

prepare parts of the transcript.  That can be useful, for instance, if the 
oral proceedings are unusually lengthy and no one transcriber is likely to 
be able to prepare the entire transcript timely, or if a court reporter 
records part of the proceedings but other parts of the proceedings were 
recorded by audio or video recording equipment. 
 

5.  Although rare, sometimes the party designating an oral proceeding as 
part of the record on appeal will want a specific transcriber selected.  If 
the transcriber is on the list of transcribers, the transcript coordinator 
may honor the request, but is not required to do so, and should consider 
the transcriber’s workload before honoring the request. 

 

 

Notifying the Appellate Court and the Parties 

A.  After selecting a transcriber (as used in Part 3, “transcriber” includes a court 

reporter), the transcript coordinator must: 
 

1.  Forward a copy of the notice of appeal, a copy of the exhibit list(s), a 

copy of the witness list, and a certified copy of the audio or video record 
to the transcriber, and inform the transcriber of the due date of the 
transcript.  If the party has designated an audio or video recording 
played in court as part of the record on appeal, and if the party has 
specifically requested preparation of a transcript of the recording, please 
be sure to collect those and forward them to the transcriber. 

2.  Notify the parties to the appeal and the appellate court of the assignment 
of transcriber.  The notice must include the name, address, telephone 
number, and email address of each transcriber assigned to prepare the 
transcript, and the due date of the transcript. 

 

7  Appellate Transcript Procedures 2017 

 

B.  If, before the due date of the transcript, the transcript coordinator is unable to 

assign a transcriber or forward a copy of the notice of appeal and a certified copy 
of the audio or video record, the transcript coordinator must notify the appellate 
court.  See Appendix C. 

Transcript Due Date; Motion for Extension of Time to Prepare Transcript 
 

A.  Due Date of the Transcript 

Subject to one exception, under ORS 19.370(2), the transcript is due 30 days 
after the filing of the notice of appeal. 

Note:  The date of filing of the notice of appeal can be determined by looking 
at the appellate court case register for the case number of the appeal.  The 
register contains two dates:  the date the document was filed and the date the 
document was entered in the register.  The controlling date is the date in the 
first column -- the date the notice of appeal is filed or deemed filed.  When a 
notice of appeal is filed by mail, the mailing date can be deemed to be the 
date of filing.  If you are uncertain, call the transcript clerk, whose number is 
shown on page 4. 

he appellate courts have an Appellate Settlement Conference Program 

(ASCP).  If the ASCP accepts assignment of an appeal, the appeal is 
suspended for 90 days.  In that event, the transcript will be due 30 days after 
the 90-day period expires, for a total of 120 days after the date of assignment 
of the appeal to the ASCP.  However, the ASCP sometimes terminates a 
referral early or sometimes extends an assignment.  If either of those events 
happen, the ASCP will notify the transcript coordinator and the transcriber. 
Further, the date can be verified by contacting the transcript clerk whose 
name and number is shown on page 4.  

  T

B.  Appellate Settlement Conference Program (ASCP) Exception 

otion for Extension of Time 

.  The court does not automatically grant motions for extension of time to file 
transcripts, particularly in cases where a first extension of time has already 
been granted.  A transcriber who files a motion for extension of time should

(1) keep in mind that timeliness is critically important to the court and the 
litigants, (2) explain in the extension motion why the transcriber could not 
complete the transcript within the initial 30-day period, and (3) file a first 
motion for extension of time that is based on the transcriber's good-faith 
estimate of the total amount of additional time that the transcriber will need to 
complete the transcript.   
 

B.  Transcribers should also bear in mind the strictly limited timelines for appeals 
in juvenile-dependency and termination-of-parental-rights cases, and should 
expect that the court will grant no more than a single 14-day extension of time 
for the transcripts in those cases, except in extraordinary circumstances. 
 

C.  When the transcript is not going to be prepared timely, either the party 

designating the transcript, the transcript coordinator, or the transcriber must 
file a written motion for extension of time before expiration of the due date of 
the transcript. The appellate court will place the appeal in default status if a 
motion for extension is not filed timely. 
 

D.  An extension of time is necessary to cover all gaps of time between the 

transcript due date and the date the transcriber files notice of preparation of 
the transcript. For instance, if the transcript was due on June 5, but not 
submitted until June 6, a motion for extension of time would need to be filed 
and granted to cover the period until June 6. 
 

E.  A transcript coordinator or transcriber may file a motion for extension of time 
without paying a filing fee.  In civil cases and other cases in which the state is 
not paying the cost of the transcript, a party who files a motion for extension 
of time must pay $53 filing fee. 

Note:  Sometimes a party may ask the transcript coordinator or transcriber to file 
a motion for extension of time to avoid the party having to file the motion and 
incur the $53 filing fee.  Use your discretion in accommodating any such request.  
Generally, a transcript coordinator or transcriber should file a motion for 
extension of time only when the transcript coordinator or transcriber is 
responsible for the delay in getting the transcript prepared.

F.  Appendix B contains a form that a transcriber should use to request an 

extension of time. Appendix C contains a form that a transcript coordinator 
should use to request an extension of time.

Becoming a Transcriber; Assignment of Transcripts for Preparation; Due Date of 
Transcript  

Note:  As used in this section, “transcriber” includes, where appropriate, a 
court reporter responsible for preparing a transcript on appeal. 

Confidentiality Requirement 
 

A.  Effective May 1, 2012 all transcribers interested in performing appellate 

transcription work must complete a confidentiality agreement with the Appellate 
Court Administrator.  The Appellate Court Administrator maintains the list of 
transcribers who have signed and returned the form and who are, therefore, 
available for appellate case transcription. The presence of a transcriber’s name 
on the list does not mean that the Appellate Court Administrator guarantees the 
quality or timeliness of the transcriber’s work product. Appendix A   
 

B.  Transcriber contact information is available to all transcript coordinators 
statewide via the Oregon Judicial Department’s (OJD) intranet website: 
https://intranet.ojd.state.or.us/OJDIntra/docs/osca/acsd/transcribercompliancelist.
pdf  Transcriber email-only contact information is available to self-represented 
persons.  

1.  Assignment of Transcript. 

The transcript coordinator from each court assigns preparation of the 
transcript, as designated by the parties or as ordered by the appellate court, 
to one or more transcribers from the list maintained by OJD. 

2.  Due Date of Transcript.  The legislature has prescribed the due date of 

transcripts.  ORS 19.370(2) Appendix E 

3.  Upon receipt of the assignment, please immediately review the exhibit 

list(s).  If the party has designated an audio or video recording played in 
court as part of the record on appeal, and if the party has specifically 
requested preparation of a transcript of the recording, it must also be 
transcribed.  If you did not receive those recordings, contact the transcript 

11  Appellate Transcript Procedures 2017 

 

coordinator immediately so that those may be provided as soon as possible. 
 

Generally, the transcript is due within 30 days from the date the notice of appeal is filed 
with the appellate court.  

Note:  If you have access to the Appellate Case Management System (ACMS) 
register, the date of filing of the notice of appeal can be determined by looking at 
the appellate court case register for the case number of the appeal.  The register 
contains two dates:  the date the document was filed and the date the document 
was entered in the register.  The controlling date is the date in the first column -- the 
date the notice of appeal is filed or deemed filed.  When a notice of appeal is filed 
by mail, the mailing date can be deemed to be the date of filing. If you do not have 
access to ACMS, you may wish to call the transcript clerk whose telephone number 
is shown on page 4. 

C.  However, if the appellate case is assigned to the Appellate Settlement 

Conference Program (ASCP) before the transcript is prepared and filed, 
preparation of the transcript will be held in abeyance. The referral to the ASCP 
typically is for 90 days. If the case is assigned to the ASCP during the initial 30 
days of the appeal, the transcript will become due 120 days after the notice of 
appeal is filed (the initial 30-day period plus the additional 90-day abeyance 
period).  However, the ASCP may terminate the referral early or may extend the 
referral. In any event, when the ASCP terminates the referral, the ASCP will send 
a notice to the appellate court, the parties, and the transcribers regarding the due 
date of the transcript.   

A.  If the transcript is not prepared timely, either the party designating the transcript, 

the transcript coordinator, or the transcriber must file a written motion for 
extension of time before expiration of the due date of the transcript. The 
appellate court will place the appeal in default status if a motion for extension is 
not filed timely. 
 

B.  An extension of time is necessary to cover all gaps of time between the transcript 
due date and the date the transcriber files notice of preparation of the transcript. 

12  Appellate Transcript Procedures 2017 

 

otion for Extension of Time 

 

  M

For instance, if the transcript was due on June 5, but not submitted until June 6, 
a motion for extension of time would need to be filed and granted to cover the 
period until June 6. 
 

C.  A transcript coordinator or transcriber may file a motion for extension of time 

without paying a filing fee.  In civil cases and other cases in which the state is not 
paying the cost of a transcript, a party who files a motion for extension of time 
must pay a $53 filing fee. 

Note:  Sometimes a party may ask the transcript coordinator or transcriber to 
file a motion for extension of time to avoid the party having to file the motion 
and incur the $53 filing fee.  Use your discretion in accommodating such a 
request.  Generally, a transcript coordinator or transcriber should file a motion 
for extension of time only when the transcript coordinator or transcriber is 
responsible for the delay in getting the transcript prepared.

Financial arrangements  

 

The fees a transcriber may charge for transcripts on appeal are set by the legislature. 
Per ORS 21.345, a transcriber may not charge more than $3.00 per page for the 
original transcript 

A.  In criminal, habeas corpus, post-conviction relief, civil commitment, and juvenile 
dependency and delinquency cases, the appellant typically will be represented 
by a court-appointed attorney and will receive a transcript at state expense.1  If a 
transcript is to be prepared at state expense, the transcript coordinator will 
receive from the Office of Public Defense Services a copy of authorization to 
prepare the transcript at state expense or a copy of a trial or appellate court order 
authorizing preparation of the transcript at state expense.  The transcript 
coordinator must forward a copy of the authorization or appellate court order to 
the transcriber. 

B.  In all other cases, including civil cases, it is the responsibility of the party 

designating a transcript of oral proceedings as part of the record on appeal to 
make financial arrangements directly with the transcriber. 

Exercise caution in beginning work on the transcript before 
financial arrangements have been made.  

 

 

1.  When the appellant may be entitled to a transcript at state expense (for 

instance, criminal, post-conviction relief, habeas corpus, civil commitment, 
and juvenile court cases):  

                                                           

1   But not always; appellants in those cases are not always indigent and occasionally 
will be represented by retained counsel.  Additionally, the State of Oregon sometimes is 
the appellant, in which case the Department of Justice will pay for the transcript. 

14  Appellate Transcript Procedures 2017 

   

 

a.  If the appellant is indigent:2  Exercise Caution:  The trial court, the 
appellate court, or the Office of Public Defense Services, must pre-

ote:   Transcripts for indigent appellants are paid for by the Office of 

Public Defense Services using state funds. Bill for preparing the transcript 
only after you complete the transcript.  OPDS requires a specific form for 
billing: Public Defense Provider’s Fee Statement for Transcripts on 
Appeal. OPDS will provide the form to the transcript coordinator, and the 
transcript coordinator will provide that form to the transcriber when the 
transcript is assigned.  If you have not received the form from the attorney, 
please feel free to request it.  Upon completion of the transcript, the 
transcriber should send the completed fee invoice to:

b.  If the appellant is not indigent, upon receipt of notice of assignment of 

responsibility to prepare the transcript, the transcriber must estimate the 
cost of preparing the transcript and should request advance payment – or 
other financial arrangements acceptable to the transcriber -- from the party 
or the party’s attorney. See Appendix H 

NOTE:  The appellant has the right to proceed without an attorney and may be 
indigent or may be able to pay for the transcript.  In criminal, post-conviction 
relief, habeas corpus, juvenile, or civil commitment cases, if the self-represented 
party is indigent, the party may seek authorization from the court or OPDS for 
preparation of the transcript at state expense. In any case type, including civil 
cases, if the self-represented party does not have authorization for preparation of 
the transcript at state expense, the party must make financial arrangements with 
the transcriber for preparation of the transcript. 

c.  If the appellant is the state or state agency represented by the Attorney 
General, no advanced payment is required. Billing occurs after the 
transcript is complete, and both the transcript and billing should be sent to:

2.   Civil cases  

A.  In civil cases, generally the transcriber deals with privately-retained 
attorney or self-represented party. Upon notice of assignment of 
responsibility to prepare the transcript, the transcriber should estimate the 
cost of preparing the transcript, then contact the attorney or party and 
request advanced payment or make arrangements for payment of the 
cost of preparing the transcript. 

B.  The appellate courts have authority to authorize preparation of a 

transcript in a civil case at state expense.  However, the appellate courts 
rarely exercise that authority.  If an appellate court authorizes a transcript 
at state expense in a civil case, the transcriber will receive a copy of the 
court’s order.  The transcriber must include a copy of that order with their 
billing, after preparation of the transcript, and send both of those items to 
this address:  

Business and Fiscal Services Division 
Mandated Payments 
State Court Administrator 
1163 State Street 
Salem, Oregon 97302 

4.  Failure to Timely Make Financial Arrangements 

A.  If financial arrangements for payment of the transcript have not been 

made within 14 days after receiving notice of assignment of a transcript, 
the transcriber should send a letter to ACSD (sample at Appendix I) 
advising that the transcriber has not begun preparation of the transcript 
because no payment agreement has been reached. Include with that letter 
a copy of the letter sent to the attorney(s) or party(s) requesting payment 
for the transcript. See the ‘Contact Information’ section at the beginning of 
this manual for ACSD’s mailing address.  

.  If acceptable financial arrangements for payment have been made after 

the 14-day letter has been sent to the ACSD, the transcriber should file a 
written request for an extension of time (sample at Appendix B) with the 

17  Appellate Transcript Procedures 2017 

 

 

  B

 

 

ACSD stating that financial arrangements now have been made. Include 
the date of the payment or arrangement and request a new due date for 
the transcript.  
 

If the payment or arrangement is not made by the attorney(s) or party(s) 
requesting the transcript on appeal, a transcript will not be prepared and 
the appeal may go forward without a transcript or the case may be 
dismissed.  

 

18  Appellate Transcript Procedures 2017 

 

Transcript Content, Specifications, and Format (See Appendix E) 

A. 

Title page  

An appropriate title page will have the appellate case number and caption, the lower 
(circuit) court case number, and indicate volume number (if applicable).  
 

B. 

Index of Trial or Hearing, and Exhibits  

The trial/hearing index shall note the first page of each: direct, cross, redirect and re-
cross testimony of each witness. Exhibits shall be noted with its type (for example:  
Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1, Defendant’s Exhibit 101, etc.), and the page of the record where the 
exhibit was offered and where received in evidence (if received in evidence). Other 
proceedings should be indexed when appropriate: motions for involuntary dismissal and 
directed verdict, requested jury instructions and jury instructions, opinion of the court, 
and other matters of special importance.  

C. 

Appearance  

The transcript shall be a uniform document, with one-inch margins, uniformly spaced 
type at 10 characters per inch. Proportionally spaced type from a computer shall be no 
smaller than 12 point font. The same sized font shall be used throughout the document. 
Each page must contain 25 numbered lines of double-spaced text (except for the last 
page).  A printed transcript should be on white paper, 8.5 x 11 inches, and double-
sided.    

Rules of grammar shall be observed (for example, a transcript shall not be prepared 
using all uppercase letters). The following shall begin no more than 15 character spaces 
from the left margin: colloquy, parenthetic phrases, exhibit marking, quoted material. 
Quoted material that carries to the next line shall begin no more than 10 character 
spaces from the left margin.  

D. 

Organization  

1.  All formats  

Questions and answers shall be prefaced by ‘Q’ and ‘A’ as appropriate, and each 
question and answer will begin on its own line. Pagination of the entire document shall 
be placed in the top right corner. To the left of the page number, at the top of the page, 

19  Appellate Transcript Procedures 2017 

   

 

shall be the witness’ name (as applicable) and whether the testimony is: direct (D), 
cross (X), redirect (ReD), or recross (ReX) examination.  
 

2.  Paper format  

Conventionally filed transcripts shall be bound to lie flat when open. A plastic comb 
binding, set within three-eighths of an inch from the left paper edge of the transcript, 
shall bind each hard copy transcript volume. If a transcript exceeds 200 pages, it shall 
be bound into volumes of approximately equal size (and not more than 200 pages 
each). Volumes must be consecutively numbered on their covers. Covers of transcripts 
shall be either a clear plastic sheet or 65-pound weight paper.  
 

E. 

Electronic format  

Electronically filed transcripts shall be in Portable Document Format (PDF) that allows 
text searching and copy/paste function. Transcript pagination, whether hard copy or 
electronic, must all be the same for briefing purposes later in the case chronology. This 
is achieved by converting transcripts to PDF format prior to printing. If a PDF file 
contains more than one proceeding date, the beginning of each proceeding date must 
be bookmarked.    

If a transcript exceeds 450 pages, it must be submitted in volumes of approximately 
equal size (and not more than 450 pages each).

Naming Conventions for Transcripts in Electronic Format (see Appendix P): 
 

A.  Non-confidential cases 

[Appellate Case Number]_transcript-[year-month-day, of hearing-am/pm if 
appropriate]_[court reporter or transcriber last, first name]  

xample: A123456_transcript-2002-02-15-am_johnsonerin    

f the transcript spans several dates, then the date span should be indicated, such as:  

SC012345_transcript-2002-02-15to2002-02-20_johnsonerin  
 

B.  Confidential cases 

[Appellate Case Number]_transcript-confidentialcase-[year-month-day, of hearing-
am/pm if appropriate]_[court reporter or transcriber last, first name]  

xample: CA123456_transcript-confidentialcase-2002-02-15-am_johnsonerin 

Transcribers shall use optical disks to send transcripts containing more than two 
volumes to ACSD. The naming convention shall follow the guidelines above; labeling 
software may be used to burn the naming convention directly onto the disk, however, 
the preferred method is to write directly onto the disk with a permanent marker. 
Conventional, paper labels are not to be used because they degrade over time and 
separate from the disk. The electronic transcript shall comply with ORAP 3.35(1)(a), (c), 
(d), (e), (f), (g), and (h). Notwithstanding ORAP 3.33(5)(b), the electronic transcript filed 
with the court shall be prepared in the one page of transcript per one standard page 
format.

Service of Certificate of Preparation and Service 
 

A.  After completing the transcript, the transcriber must serve the transcript in 

electronic format on each attorney representing the parties, and must serve the 
transcript in paper format on each self-represented party (unless a self-
represented party has filed notice that the party wishes to receive the transcript in 
electronic format).  Attorney or parties and transcribers may make arrangement 
for service of the transcript in a different formats (such as a thumb drive), but the 
aforementioned are the default service methods in absence of specific 
arrangements to the contrary.   

B.  The transcriber must file with the appellate court and serve on each party to the 

appeal, the transcript coordinator, and the trial court administrator a Certificate of 
Preparation and Service of Transcript. See Appendix K. The transcriber may file 
the certificate either by email or by conventional Postal Service mail (but not 
both!).  The transcriber must not file the transcript with the appellate court at this 
time.   

Correcting or Adding to the Transcript 
 

A.  After the transcriber has served copies of the transcript on the parties, the parties 
determine whether any corrections or additions need to be made. The parties 
have 15 days after service of the transcript to file a motion in the circuit court 
asking for additions or corrections, unless the transcript is served during a period 
in which the case is being held in abeyance pending a referral to the Appellate 
Settlement Conference Program. In that event, the 15 day period does not begin 
to run until the referral to the ASCP ends.  ORS 19.370(6) (see Appendix O). 
 

B.  A party who files a motion to correct or add to the transcript must serve a copy of 
the motion on the Appellate Court Administrator and the transcript coordinator. 
ORAP 3.40(1)  The Appellate Court Administrator will hold the appeal in 
abeyance pending the trial court’s disposition of the motion.  ORS 19.370(6); 
ORAP 3.40(2) (see Appendices L and O)   
 

C.  A transcript may be prepared in multiple parts by different transcribers. Although 
parties may choose to file a motion to correct or add to the transcript as each 
part of the transcript is filed, 15 day deadline to move to correct or add to the 

22  Appellate Transcript Procedures 2017 

 

transcript does not begin to run until all parts of the transcript are served. ORAP 
3.40.  
 

D.  If the trial court grants the motion to correct or add to the transcript, the trial 
court must provide a copy of the trial court’s order to the transcriber.  The 
transcriber must make the corrections or additions as ordered by the trial court, 
then file with the appellate court and serve on the parties and the transcript 
coordinator a new Certificate of Preparation and Service of Modified Transcript.  
 

Settling the Transcript 

 

A.  If no party files a motion to correct or add to the transcript, the transcript will be 
deemed settled 15 days after the transcript – or the last part of the transcript, if 
the transcript was prepared in different parts – is served on the parties. 

B.  If, however, a party has moved to correct or add to the transcript and the trial 
court has granted the motion, the transcript does not settle until after the 
transcriber makes any necessary corrections or additions and the transcriber 
files a certificate of preparation on the corrected or additional transcript. 

C.  If a party files a motion to correct or add to the transcript and the trial court 

denies the motion, the transcript becomes settled. 

D.  The appeals clerk will notify the transcriber(s) when the transcript settles and will 
request that the transcript be filed.  Only after receiving notice that the transcript 
is settled should the transcriber file the transcript with the appellate court. 

 

23  Appellate Transcript Procedures 2017 

   

 

Service & Filing of Certificate of Filing Transcript  
 

A.  When the transcript settles or is deemed settled and the transcriber receives 

notice from the appellate court to file the transcript, the transcriber must file the 
transcript with the appellate court along with a Certificate of Filing of Transcript.  
See Appendix N.  The transcriber may file the transcript and the Certificate with 
the appellate court either by optical disk or email. 

1.  If the transcript exceeds 450 pages (roughly two volumes of about 200 

pages each), the transcriber must submit the entire transcript via 
optical disk. 
 

ote: If the appellate court rejects the submission (for instance, 

because of virus or malware issues), the appeals clerk will notify the 
transcriber of the reason for the rejection, and instruct as to how to 
resubmit the transcript.  

  N

2.  If the transcript does not exceed 450 pages, the transcriber may file 
the transcript via email If emailed, the transcript must be emailed to 
appealsclerk@ojd.state.or.us 

B.  The transcriber must serve the Certificate of Filing Transcript on each party to 

the appeal.  The same rules apply as in section A on page 21. See ORAP 3.33 
(Appendix C)

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ) 
 Do I need Adobe to make a PDF (portable document format)? Can I use another 
software program?  

We do not endorse one program over another.  Transcribers may use any software 
program capable of saving the transcript in PDF. 

 
Do I have to serve an electronic version of the transcript on the party? 

After January 1, 2011, the default service method on parties represented by attorneys is 
by electronic media and the default service method of service on self-represented 
parties is by print media. However, a self-represented party may request service by 
electronic media.  Any party and the transcriber may make arrangements to change the 
service delivery method. Email addresses identified in the notice of appeal shall be used 
for service when appropriate.  

 
Can we print labels for optical disks? 

Permanent marker is best. The permanent marker ensures that the optical disk 
(CD/DVD) remains marked and the information is available for easy identification. 
Labeling software may also be used, because the software produces a reliably adherent 
label. Conventional labels will degrade over time and can separate from the optical disk. 

 
How many pages can I transmit via disk?  

There is no page limit if the transcript is submitted via optical disk.  The page limitation 
applies to email submission and conventional transmission. 

 
How do I combine the index, the transcript, and the service certificate into one 

document?  

We recognize that many transcribers formerly saved their index, transcript and 
certificate in separate electronic documents. We now need these as one pdf. The copy 
and paste function may be used to combine all the documents into one, before saving 
as a pdf.  Software programs can combine separate pdf documents into one pdf. A 
local, technical resource may be able to assist with more options.

 Can transcribers submit requests for extensions of time via email?  

No. Requests for extension of time must be submitted conventionally to ensure proper 
service and so that the extension requests can ultimately be combined into our case 
management system.  Email does not lend itself to this process. 

 
Are there any changes in the amounts transcribers can bill for their services?  

The transcript fees are set by the legislature. Many billing questions concern OPDS, 
because that office is a large user of transcriber services for its Appellate Division’s 
case load. If you are preparing a transcript for use by appointed counsel, you may wish 
to contact OPDS’s Business Services Division at 503-378-2478.  

 
Why does the naming convention include an AM/PM distinction? What does the 

naming convention look like on transcripts spanning dates?  

The AM/PM distinction is only for cases in which multiple transcribers are responsible 
for the same date of transcripts. If one transcriber has transcribed the entire date, omit 
the AM/PM distinction. Cases spanning multiple dates should be saved as a single pdf 
file, with the date span included in the name file, such as: SC012345_transcript-2002-
02- 15to2002-02-20_johnsonerin. The same naming convention should also be used 
when labeling the optical disk.  

 
Why can’t all transcripts be submitted via email to save mailing expense and 
time?  

Our email system is unable to receive very large transcript files resulting in the 
restriction on the size of the transcript that may be transmitted by email.  

 
Do the separate days of a transcript need to be separate pdfs?  

No. The transcript MUST be combined into one document, regardless of the number of 
days of testimony. Please refer to the Electronic Format section on page 19 regarding 
transcripts that exceed 450 pages.

Appendix D ORAP 3.33 PREPARATION, SERVICE, AND FILING OF TRANSCRIPT 

1.  Upon being served with a copy of a notice of appeal, the transcript 
coordinator shall examine the  notice of appeal and determine: 

1.  Whether the party has designated a record of oral proceedings as 

part of the record on  appeal; 

2.  Whether preparation of a transcript of the designated proceedings is 

required by law or  these rules; and 

3.  Whether the proceedings were reported by a court reporter or 
recorded by audio or video  recording equipment, or both. 

 

2.  When a party has designated as part of the record on appeal a transcript of 

oral  proceedings reported by: 

a.  A court reporter, the transcript coordinator shall forward a copy of the 
notice of  appeal to the court reporter or reporters who reported the 
proceedings designated as  part of the record on appeal and inform the 
reporter(s) of the due date of the  transcript. 
 

b.  Audio or video recording, the transcript coordinator shall identify 

one or more  qualified transcribers, forward a copy of the notice of 
appeal to the transcriber(s)  along with a certified copy of the audio 
or videotape recording, and inform the  transcriber(s) of the due 
date of the transcript.

make financial  arrangements with the court reporter(s) or 
transcriber(s) for preparation of the transcript. 
 

d.  When the appellant is eligible for court-appointed counsel on appeal, 
authorization for the  preparation of the transcript at state expense is 
governed by the policies and procedures of  the Office of Public Defense 
Services. 
 

32  Appellate Transcript Procedures 2017 

 

 

 

 

 

e.  If the transcript coordinator has not forwarded the notice of appeal to 
the court reporter(s)  or has not forwarded the notice of appeal and a

before the transcript due date, the transcript coordinator shall  notify 
the appellate court of that fact. 
 

3.  After making arrangements with the court reporter(s) or transcriber(s) as 

provided in subsection (2) of this rule, the transcript coordinator shall notify the 
appellate court and the parties to the  appeal of the name, address, telephone 
number, and email address of each court reporter or  transcriber, or both, as 
appropriate, who will be preparing all or a part of the transcript. 
 

4.  It shall be the responsibility of each court reporter or transcriber with whom 

arrangements have  been made to prepare a transcript to: 

a.  Cause the transcript to be prepared in conformity with ORAP 3.35. 

b.  Serve a copy of the transcript on each party required by ORS 19.370 
and file with the  Administrator and serve on each party, the trial court 
administrator, and the transcript  coordinator a certificate of preparation 
and service of transcript within the time provided in  ORS 19.370. In a 
criminal case, the state’s copy of the transcript shall be served on the 
Attorney General.  If the transcript is not served and the certificate is 
not served and filed  within that time, the court reporter or transcriber 
shall move for an extension of time. 

c.  Upon notice from the Administrator of the settlement of the transcript, file 
with the  Administrator an electronic version of the transcript in the form 
required by ORAP 3.35(2)  and file with the Administrator and serve on

of the transcript with the Administrator is in lieu of filing a paper 
transcript and shall be in the form provided in ORAP 3.35(2). 

5.  The court reporter or transcriber shall serve the appellant and the respondent 

each with a  copy of the transcript as follows: 

1.  If a party is represented by an attorney, unless the attorney has made

reporter or transcriber  shall serve the transcript in electronic form on 
the attorney at the email address  identified in the notice of appeal as 
required by ORAP 2.05(5). If a party is not  represented by an attorney, 
unless the party has made other arrangements with the  court reporter 
or transcriber, the court reporter or transcriber shall serve a paper  copy 
of the transcript on the party. In addition to or in lieu of service by email 
or by  paper copy, an attorney or party may make arrangements with the 
court reporter or  transcriber to provide a copy of the transcript to that

by paper  copy as provided in clause (5)(a)(i) of this rule, the court 
reporter or transcriber shall  provide one copy of the transcript to the trial 
court administrator for use by all such  respondents. The copy of the 
transcript provided to the trial court administrator  under this clause shall 
be in the medium (e.g., paper or optical disk) requested by  the trial 
court. 

3.  If a party or attorney negotiates with a court reporter or transcriber to 

provide the transcript  in a medium other than paper or email, provided 
by the court reporter or transcriber, the  court reporter or transcriber 
may request payment of no more than $5.00 per optical disk,  USB 
drive, or other comparable medium. 

 

4.  A party may specify in the party’s designation of record or other request 
for preparation of  a transcript on appeal that the version of the transcript

arrange with the court reporter or transcriber, at the party’s own 
expense, for preparation of a transcript in the one page of transcript per 
one standard page  format. 

6.  The court reporter or transcriber may not charge for preparing more than one

document. The pagination of the transcript  served on the parties shall 
correspond to the pagination of the electronic transcript filed  with the 
court. 
 

b.  If the transcript exceeds 450 pages, the electronic transcript shall be 
broken into separate  PDF files of approximately equal length not to 
exceed 450 pages. Regardless of whether a  disk contains one or more 

  a

PDF files, each file shall be named in accordance with the file  naming 
conventions set out in Appendix 3.35. If a PDF file contains more than 
one  proceeding date, the beginning of each proceeding shall be 
bookmarked. 
 

c.  If the transcript is in two volumes or less, it may be filed by attaching the 

electronic  transcript to an email directed to appealsclerk@ojd.state.or.us. 
If the Administrator  determines that an electronic transcript must be 
rejected for security reasons (e.g., virus or  malware), the court reporter 
or transcriber shall resubmit the transcript as directed by the 
Administrator. If the transcript is more than two volumes, it shall be filed 
by optical disk. 
 

d.  The electronic transcript shall comply with ORAP 3.35(1)(a), (c), (d), (e), 
(f), (g), and (h).  The electronic transcript also shall comply with ORAP

mediation program  established by the Court of Appeals pursuant to ORS 
2.560, and the transcript is filed during  any period of time specified in the

subsection (5) of this section must be filed within 15 days after expiration of 
the period of  time the appeal is held in abeyance, or within 15 days after the 
court directs that the appeal no  longer be held in abeyance, whichever 
occurs first.

additions as may be ordered, whichever last  occurs, the trial court shall 
enter an order settling the transcript and send copies thereof to  each of the 
parties or their attorneys and to the State Court Administrator. In the absence 
of a  motion to correct or add to the transcript, the transcript shall be deemed 
automatically settled  15 days after it is filed. [Formerly 19.078; 1999 c.367

Abeyance of Appeal 
 

1.  On assignment of a case to the program, the court will hold preparation of 
the  transcript (including correcting it or adding to it), preparation of the 
record, and  briefing, in abeyance for a period of 120 days after the date of 
the notice of  assignment of the case to the program. During that time, a

writing or to implement  a settlement, any party may request the program 
director to order, and the program  director may order, an extension of the 
abeyance period for up to 60 days. If all  parties to an appeal agree to an 
extension for longer than 60 days, the program  director may extend the 
abeyance period for as long as reasonably necessary to  implement a 
settlement.
