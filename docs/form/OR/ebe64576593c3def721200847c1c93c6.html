Foreword 
 

We Honor All Parents & Families 

What parents and families look like is diverse. Children are being raised 

and doing well in homes headed by opposite-sex parents, same-sex parents, 
grandparents, parents who are living apart and co-parenting, and parents who 
are parenting alone.  Wherever possible, we are committed to using inclusive 
language that respects all parents.  

We Recognize Solo Parents 

e know that many separated, divorced, and single parents are parenting 

without the help or involvement of the other parent.  We refer to this as solo 
parenting rather than single parenting, because many single parents still have a 
co-parent who is helping to raise their child.  While some sections of this 
handbook focus on things that co-parents should consider, we hope that much of 
the material will be helpful to solo parents as well. 
 

We Focus on Strengths and Resiliency 

ne of the most important research findings on families dealing with 

divorce and separation is that the majority of children are able to bounce back 
after family change.  There are many things parents can do to help children do 
well during and after divorce or separation.

Introduction 

hy have a special handbook focused on children age birth to three? 

The first three years of a child’s life are critical for their future health, happiness and 
growth.  During these years, a child is learning much more than how to walk, talk and 
follow directions.  Her brain is actually growing in very important ways that will help her 
deal with stress, learn, be healthy, and have close relationships with others in the 
future.  

arents ending their relationship during this time in their child’s life face difficult choices 

about what schedule will work best for their child.  It is hard to balance the needs of a 
young child with each parent’s wish to have as much time as possible.     

xperts on children have spent a lot of time studying young children whose parents are 

not together.  They have tried to identify what are the best plans and schedules for 
young children in these situations.  Sometimes the experts do not agree, and this can be 
confusing.  

he good news is that experts do agree on some important things.  

Young children need: 

safe, predictable care from a warm, responsive adult(s)  
frequent and meaningful contact with two safe parents 

 
 
  protection from tension, conflict, and violence 
  comfort from an attachment figure when they are upset   
 

schedules that change when their needs change 

ow can this handbook help me and my child? 

This handbook will help parents of young children who are divorcing, separating or 
never lived together make informed decisions about parenting time schedules.   
 

  We will talk about attachment and the importance of each parent in a child’s 

  We will look at overnights for young children and things to think about when

deciding on overnights.  

  We will explore signs of distress in young children and the difference between 

normal and concerning responses to stress.   

  We share sample plans and resources so that you have a place to start.   

his handbook often talks about research.  You may notice that sometimes the research 
finds different answers to the same questions.  There are many reasons for this.  Mostly 
it shows that there is no one size fits all plan that will meet the needs of every child.   

eep in Mind: This handbook gives a broad overview of things to think about in developing your plan.  
It may not describe a plan that meets the specific needs of your child.  You should always talk with your 
child’s doctor or a child therapist if you have questions about the special needs of your child.  In addition, 
you should ask an attorney if you have questions about how this information might affect your legal case.

A baby cannot survive without someone to provide 
food, safety, and affection.  Because of this, human 
babies are born with a very strong need to bond with 
a caregiver.  Attachment is the word used to 
describe the deep and lasting emotional bond 
between a child and at least one caregiver.  In their 
first year, children develop a strong attachment 
bond with the person they first experience as 
consistent, safe, and comforting.  This is usually a 
parent or a person who takes care of them most of 
the time.   

 

abies can have a strong attachment to more than 
one person, but they usually prefer one attachment 
figure over another at different points in their lives.  
In this hand book we sometimes call this person a 
primary attachment figure.

Attachment 

The bond a child makes with a  
primary attachment figure is  
the building block for nearly 
 all other important steps in  
growing up. 

important steps in growing up.  Early brain development depends on secure attachment.  
Baby brains double in volume between birth and 12 months.  During this time, the back-
and-forth interactions between a baby and attachment figures are key.  These 
interactions stimulate many parts of the developing baby’s brain.  

ecure attachment helps a child feel trust and self-confidence.  It helps them be 
ready to learn and to connect with others.  It helps them understand their feelings.  
Secure attachment makes for resilient children who are able to “bounce back” after 
tough situations, recover from hurt feelings, and take on new challenges. 

esearch tells us that securely attached children are better able to: 

learn and do well in school 

trust and feel close to others 

 
  handle difficult feelings 
 
feel good about themselves  
  care about other people’s feelings 
 
  be curious and creative 
  be flexible, problem-solve and adjust to new situations  
 
  be more independent 
  have better social skills 

think before acting on impulse

How does a parent create secure attachment? 
Secure attachment happens when a parent consistently and predictably provides 
warm, responsive care to their child, especially when the child is excited or upset.  
Secure attachment comes from the give-and-take between the child and the parent.  
The child sends a signal for attention, like crying or smiling.  The parent reads the signal 
right and responds in a way that gives the child what she needs.   

esponsive behaviors that help form secure attachment include feeding, holding, 

smiling, cuddling, comforting, soothing, bathing, and other care giving behaviors.  
Children with secure attachments know they can depend on the attachment figure to 
help when they are upset and be happy with them when they are excited.   

hat does secure attachment look like in babies?   

Around the age of eight months, a securely 
attached infant starts to get upset when their 
attachment figure is out of sight.  This response is 
called separation anxiety.  Separation anxiety 
at this time in life is normal.  Also, a securely 
attached infant is happy and can accept 
comforting from the attachment figure when they 
return from being separated.  In other words, an 
infant with a secure attachment has a strong 
enough bond that they are upset when the 
attachment figure leaves.  And they have enough 
trust, that they can relax and be comforted when the attachment figure comes back.    

Care giving behaviors help infants 
form secure attachments. 

 

ecurely attached children can be comforted by other people they feel close to, but they 

usually prefer to be comforted by their secure attachment figure.  

rust = Emotional Regulation… 

Each time a baby gets upset and is comforted by the attachment figure, he has the 

experience of calming down.  As this happens 
over and over again, he starts to learn the 
ability to calm himself and handle his own 
negative feelings.  Emotional regulation is a 
term for this ability and it is very important.  
Emotional regulation allows a child to 
understand and accept his own feelings, use 
healthy ways to handle them, and keep going 
even under stress.  Emotional regulation leads 
to good mental and emotional health later in 
life.

What does secure attachment look like in toddlers? 
As your child enters the second year of life she becomes more physically and 
emotionally independent.  Parts of the brain involved in talking become active during the 
second year.  Most children have begun to talk and deal with toilet training by the end 
of the third year.  This is a busy and challenging time for children and their parents.  

xploring (getting into everything!) and testing your patience by saying “No!” are some 
of the ways a toddler tries out his new skills and develops independence.  Toddlers have 
a strong desire to do things “by myself!”  At the same time, they still need to feel close 
to their attachment figure.  This creates stress and can lead to strong emotional 
outbursts.  This is why people sometimes call this stage the “terrible twos.” 
     

Securely attached toddlers can usually 
explore their environment with excitement 
and curiosity.  But they also want frequent 
contact with their attachment figure.  The 
attachment that created trust in the first 
year now becomes the secure base 
toddlers can rely on while exploring the 
world and their own feelings and wishes.

they are tired, hurt, or upset.  They also want you to share their joy and excitement 
about the world around them! 

dren can have more than one attachment figure

Attachment develops over the lifespan, from before birth into adulthood.  We know that 
babies bond with a secure attachment figure in the first months of life.  Some experts 
now believe infants can bond with other caregivers as early as two to three months of 
age.   

hese other attachments are usually with people 

who spend a lot of time with the infant and 
provide warm, responsive care.  This is often the 
other parent.  Sometimes it is a grandparent, 
sibling or other caregiver. These bonds give a 
child the chance to have positive, loving 
interactions with others.  Infants will show serious 
grief and upset if they lose contact with a primary 
attachment figure.  But, they also feel grief if they 
lose contact with other important attachment 
figures. 

 

The attachment bond that created 
trust in the first year now becomes 
the secure base a toddler can rely on 
while exploring the outside world 
and their inside feelings and wishes.

             Attachment & Parenting Time Schedules 

 

 

ow does attachment factor into decisions about parenting 
me schedules? 
t
i
Some of the brain development that happens in the first years of life 

can only happen when a child is very young and his brain is still forming. There seem to 
be “windows” of time when a young child can learn that are not open later.  For 
example, children who do not hear language spoken during their early years may not be 
able to learn to talk later.   

he child’s attachment system is very important during this period of brain growth.  

Children learn from people they are attached to at two or three times the rate they learn 
from others.  Experts believe that disturbing attachment during the first years may harm 
children more than future negative events.   

or a young child whose parents are separating, there are many possible sources of 
stress.  The child may be separated from her primary attachment figure for periods of 
time.  If those periods happen too often or last too long, it may have a negative effect 
on secure attachment.  During the parents’ separation, the child may be exposed to 
more parental conflict, tension, or in some cases, violence.  The 
child’s parents may be stressed and less emotionally available.   

  H

 

here is also the possible loss of contact with the nonresidential 

parent (the parent that has less time with the child).  Even if the 
nonresidential parent is not the primary attachment figure, the child 
will grieve the loss if the bond with that parent is strong.   

esearch shows that the involvement of both parents in a child’s life, with the 

exception of a dangerous or abusive parent, is an important factor for 
children to thrive.  We also know that while primary attachment is a critical 
developmental process, attachment to the other parent is equally important as children 
grow older.

here is a lot you can do to protect your child during a separation or 
vorce… 
i
d

f your child already has a secure attachment, he is in good shape to tolerate some of 
the changes that come with divorce and separation.  Years of observing parents in 
separated households show that many things protect infants and young children 
during the separation process.  For example… 
  

  commit to protecting the child’s developing attachment system by making 
sure infants have lots of opportunities and time to connect with their 
primary attachment figure and regroup emotionally 

 

  work to reduce conflict and tension during transitions 

  decide to be flexible in shaping the schedule around the child’s needs  

The Importance of Parental Involvement 

  get support so that you are emotionally available to respond to the child 

  support and encourage the child’s bond with the other parent 
 
 

focus on the child’s developmental needs rather than what’s “fair” to the 
parents 

  

 

Keep in Mind:  In cases where there is domestic violence, serious untreated mental illness, or an 
absent co-parent, these steps are difficult, maybe even impossible to accomplish. Parenting plans 
may look different.  We will talk about some of those scenarios later in this handbook.

Gender and Parenting 
Children almost always do better when 
they have access to two safe, involved 
parents.  This section looks at some of 
the benefits of having two parents 
involved in a child’s life.   

 lot of research has focused on “moms” 

and “dads.”  When we talk about 
research that looked at just moms or 
just dads, we use those terms.  We 
otherwise try to use gender-neutral 
terms wherever possible.  
 

  A

Studies of mothers and fathers looked at large groups of parents.  The results are broad 
statements about male and female parents.  Remember that gender is not the only 
factor in parenting.   Mothers and fathers have unique abilities as individuals.  They 
may or may not fit the patterns described below. 

ow do mothers and fathers each contribute to a child’s development? 
Research shows that mothers and fathers interact with their child in somewhat different 
ways, each of which can help healthy development.  Female parents tend to use warm, 
calming, and soothing behaviors more often.  They are often better at reading body 
language and connecting with the child’s emotional state.  These ways of connecting 
increase right brain development in babies.  Right brain development is very important 
for social and emotional relationships.  Mother-child attachment seems to have an 
impact on a child’s ability to be close to others and handle anxiety. 

athers tend to be more physical and stimulating when 
interacting with young children.  They often hold their 
babies facing out and allow more freedom for them to 
explore.  Male parents often use more practical, 
educational activities, and use toys in ways that expand a 
child’s world.  Fathers’ play with children may be a model 
for self-control that helps children read the emotional 
cues in others.  Attachment to the father also seems to 
have a positive impact on how toddlers deal with 
aggressive behavior. 

 

On average one-third of 
children in separated 
households lose contact 
with a parent, usually a dad. 

others more often stay physically close to their child 

while watching over and helping them with tasks.  Fathers tend to take a step back and 
be less anxious about safety, though many will offer reassurance and encouragement.  
This combination of parenting behaviors helps children develop both independence and 
sense of safety.

What is the impact of the involvement of a safe, nurturing father?   
Few parents going through a separation or divorce decide to cut off contact with the 
father.  Yet on average one-third of children whose parents have separated lose contact 
with a parent, usually a dad.  This is why studies have focused on dads.  When safety is 
not an issue, children with safe, involved fathers are more likely to have:  
   

  Higher educational achievement across the lifespan – They are ready for 
school sooner and stay in school longer; overall school performance is better; 
one study found that children with significant 
father involvement were 43% more likely 
than other kids to get mostly A’s and one-
third less likely to be held back a grade. 

  Better performance in mental skills 
such as language, thinking, and problem-
solving. 

  Higher levels of social/emotional 

functioning – They tend to make stronger, 
longer-lasting friendships in life and show 
more ability to care about other people’s feelings; girls have higher self-esteem 
and more belief in their ability to maintain long-term relationships; boys have 
fewer aggressive behaviors. 

Children with involved fathers 
are more likely to earn “A’s” 
 

 

  Fewer behavioral problems – They use drugs and alcohol less; girls are less 

likely to experience teen pregnancy; boys are less likely to become involved in 
the juvenile justice system. 

  Greater financial security - Involved fathers are more likely to support their 

children financially and to pay child support on time. 

 

Keep in Mind: Even less than perfect parents benefit a child’s life.  However, the risks of harm from a 
parent that uses violence, has serious drug or alcohol problems, or untreated mental illness may 
outweigh the benefits of their involvement.  
  

11 

 

 

 

 

 

   

                           

 

 

What about other kinds of parenting scenarios? 
Studies of the benefits of two-parent involvement have mostly focused on comparing 
male and female parents.  However, many studies have compared children raised by 
same-sex parents to children raised by opposite-sex parents.  Overall, the research 
shows that children raised by warm, caring, same sex parents do as well as 
children raised by caring opposite sex parents.  Unfortunately, there is very little 
research that compares separating/divorcing same-sex parents to separating/divorcing 
opposite-sex parents.  We hope that many of the benefits of having two opposite-sex 
parents involved in a child’s life after separation will also be true for children of same-
sex parents that separate or divorce.   

here have been many studies of children raised in solo parent homes.  These studies 
often have negative things to say about how children with only one parent do as adults.  
As experts look closer, they find that some of the “problems” for children raised by a 
solo parent may be related to the financial difficulties of raising a child alone.  In 
addition, many studies of solo parents included solo parents with other kinds of 
problems (like addiction or untreated mental illness) that may have a negative effect on 
children.

ore recently, researchers have taken a fresh approach.  They looked at resiliency 

(protective) factors for children in solo parent homes.  They found that many children 
w
th solo parents are healthy and well adjusted.  These studies show that 
i
children who do well in solo parent homes have some of the following: 

strong commitment to school involvement and education 

  positive relationships with other safe adults who support or mentor them 
 
  parents with good parenting skills  
 
 
  communities that are safe and free from violence 
  parents that have good social support networks 
 

secure attachment to the parent that is raising them 
involvement in positive peer and extra-curricular activities

Staying Connected When Your Child Does Not Live with You 

Why do some nonresidential parents drop out of a child’s life? 
We know that parents love their children, so why do some parents “drop out”? Parents 
report several common reasons for why they drop out…  

 

  Feeling guilty or not confident as a parent – Fathers ending traditional 

relationships may feel less confident in childcare roles.  They 
struggle to find ways to take part in the school and social 
lives of their children.  Mothers who leave their children 
when they end a relationship feel intense guilt.  Family and 
friends may judge them harshly.  

  Remarrying/re-partnering within the first year – It 

can easily take children a couple of years to adjust to their 
parents’ divorce or separation.  They often need a parent’s undivided attention 
during this time.  Seventy-five percent (75%) of divorced fathers remarry within 
3 years.  Those who remarry when children are very young are more likely to 
lose contact. 

  Moving more than 75 miles away – When a parent lives more than an hour’s 
drive away from their child, logistics and schedules are challenging.  Children 
may not like being uprooted from their neighborhood and friends.  Nonresidential 
parents may feel less connected with the child’s everyday lives. 

  Ongoing conflict with the other parent – Over time the emotional and 

mental stress of constant battle takes a toll.  Nonresidential parents may decide 
children would be better off if they do not come around. 

  Roadblocks – The residential parent or others talk bad about the other parent, 

move away, or try to limit contact. 

hat nonresidential parents can do to strengthen attachment… 

Nonresidential parents worry about their ability to bond with their child if they have no 
or few overnights.  How often and how valuable the time spent with a child is important, 
whether or not he spends the night.  Remember, infants develop attachments to 
caregivers who consistently provide safe, calm, nurturing and responsive care.

  Problems in life – If the nonresidential parent has untreated addiction or 
mental illness, or is homeless or in jail, regular contact can be a serious 
challenge. 

arents who regularly use responsive behaviors with their child will build stronger 

attachment.  

Responsive behaviors include: 

 

 

 

taking care of your child’s basic needs – feeding, bathing, changing, 
dressing  
soothing your child when they are ill or upset – cuddling, holding, rocking 
 
  helping your child get ready for bedtime or naps – reading, teeth-brushing, 

and other bedtime rituals 

  holding and talking to your infant; or engaging in imaginative play with 

your toddler

It also helps to be sensitive to the residential parent’s concerns about being separated 
from the child.  This can be hard to do in the middle of a divorce/separation when trust 
is low and bad feelings may be high.  Ultimately, it is worth the effort.  Studies show 
that when a residential parent trusts the child to be well cared for by the other parent, 
they are more likely to support the relationship.  Trust allows the residential parent to 
relax and let the child know that it is safe for the child to spend time with the other 
parent.   

ere are some ways to build trust with your co-parent:  

  Take a parenting class such as “The Incredible Years” to develop better 

knowledge and skills for the care of a young child. 

  Be open to receiving information from the residential parent about 

your child’s routines, needs, and likes. 

  Provide the residential parent with information about how your child 
did when he was with you, such as feedings, nap times, medications given, 
or changes in health. 

  Make sure your space is safe for a small child and allow the other 

parent to visit and see that it is ready for your child.

What nonresidential parents can do to stay connected… 
A first step to staying connected to your child is to develop a respectful working 
relationship with the other parent.  This usually requires that you separate feelings 
about the other parent from those for your child.  Treating the other parent with respect 
and working out problems together teaches children healthy behaviors.  Research shows 
that when respect for a primary attachment figure is lacking, children are more likely to 
be anxious, withdrawn or antisocial.  If conflict is low and the residential parent feels 
respected, there are more opportunities for communication, involvement and 
connection.  

mportant ways to stay connected to your young child’s everyday life, even when they 
are not with you include: 

  attending doctor’s appointments 
 

joining in play-groups or pre-school 
activities 

  dropping off and picking up from 

daycare/preschool 

  offering to help the residential parent 

whenever possible by providing relief care, 
transportation to appointments, or other 
support 

  avoiding over-involvement in work or a new relationship   
  being dependable – missing scheduled visits sends a message to your child and 

the other parent that time with your child is not important 

14 

                               

  I

 

 

arents who live far away or are otherwise unable to have a lot of 

in-person contact with their child might consider: 

  Scheduling regular phone calls or Skype/Face Time sessions – even 
speaking a few words to an infant or toddler helps them learn to 
recognize you.  Children this age have a very short attention span.  
Just because they cannot spend more than 30 seconds on the phone 
does not mean they do not want to connect with you.  

  Providing photos for the other parent to share with the child. 

  Providing a stuffed animal with a voice chip recording of you saying 

“I love you,” or other short messages. 

  Mailing your child cards, letters, videotapes of yourself and other 
mementos that let them know you are thinking about them.  You 
may think about your child every minute of the day, but your child 
will not know this unless you show her.

Supporting the Nonresidential Parent’s Bond 

hat residential parents can do to strengthen nonresidential parent 

i
nvolvement… 
Residential parents must separate negative feelings about the other parent from their 
child’s to stay connected to that person.  Below are some ways that residential parents 
can support the child’s bond with the other parent and at the same time help 
themselves feel less worried when their child is away from them. 

  W

 

  Share your knowledge with the parent with less hands-on experience.  
Instead of criticizing, “They’ve never changed a diaper in their life!” try sharing 
your skills and information about your child’s needs and preferences. 

  Encourage frequent contact with the nonresidential parent to increase 

your child’s security and attachment to them.   

  Treat the other parent with respect; they are more likely to take your advice 

if they feel respected. 

  Get support to deal with your fears about being away from your child. 

  Get information about normal and abnormal child distress so that you do 

not over-react to normal distress during transitions. 

  Avoid conflict in front of your child; conflict makes your child more anxious 

about transitions. 

  Try not to jump to conclusions about the other parent based on what 

your child does or tells you. Check out a concern with the other parent first.  You 
may find there is a normal reason for why a child was upset.  Maybe they 
couldn’t have ice cream for breakfast! 

  Include the other parent as a contact on medical, dental, childcare, and 

school forms.  By law (Oregon Revised Statutes 107.154) both parents have the 
right to information about their child’s school, medical and mental health, and 
juvenile records regardless of who has custody, unless a court orders otherwise.  

  Consider using a notebook to communicate important information back and 

forth about your infant or young child’s day.  There is a Sample Co-Parent 
Communication Log included in the back of this handbook. 

 

 

 
Separate negative feelings about 
the other parent from the need of 
a child to stay connected to that 
person.

The Question of Overnights  

hy all the fuss about overnights? 

Most parents know how important secure attachment is to a child’s 
development.  They often worry about separating a child from the 
attachment figure that has provided the child’s primary care.   
 

A child’s attachment system (the need to be close to the attachment figure for safety 
and comfort) is triggered by threats of danger.  Separation from the primary attachment 
figure or being alone and in the dark, like at bedtime, can be scary for a child.  Both of 
these may happen when a child spends the night away from the residential parent.    

f care-giving is not warm and responsive or if the child is not able to reconnect with the 
primary attachment figure often enough to be comforted, the child may feel more 
stress.  Chronic stress can harm a child’s developing brain.  Parents must be sensitive to 
how a child is handling time away from a primary attachment figure.   

t is helpful to have stable, calming bedtime routines for children.  Sensitive parenting 
and supportive routines help a child relax, feel safe, maintain attachment, and get the 
sleep they need to be healthy and happy (instead of grumpy!).   

  W

 

Should infants or children under three have 
overnights in the other parent’s home?   
This is a question researchers have spent a lot of time 
studying.  Some experts believe that it is not harmful for 
infants to have overnights with the nonresidential parent.  
They believe that overnights can increase the bond to the 
nonresidential parent, as well as the nonresidential parent’s 
commitment to the child.   

ther experts believe that separating an infant from a 
primary attachment figure for overnights too long or too 

  O

 

often may be harmful.  They point to findings that infants with frequent (once a week or 
more) overnights show more distress, and are more irritable and worried about being 
separated from their primary caregiver than children mostly in the care of one parent.  

There is no clear, simple, one-size-fits-all answer for parents.  At this 
point, we do not know for certain that overnights have either a negative 
or positive effect on young children.  Instead, parents should think 
carefully about their situation when deciding about overnights and 
parenting time for young children.

Who does your child rely on most for comfort?  Who is your child most likely to 
go to when upset, hurt, sick, or woken up in the middle of the night?  Does your 
child respond the same or differently to each of you?  This is a tough question for 
parents.  Be honest for the sake of your child.     
 

  What were your caretaking behaviors and roles before the 
.
2

separation/divorce?  What were each of your roles in caring for your child in 

during the day and at night, things like bathing, diapering, feeding, 
playing with, and putting a child down to sleep?  Did you live 
together as parents and share in the care of the child?  

What are your skills as parents?  What are your parenting 
strengths and weaknesses?  What are you or the other parent still 

learning?  How might you help the other parent develop skills to benefit your child?  
Think about making a schedule that uses the best of each of your skills.  

  3. 

“Top ten” things to think about when deciding about overnights… 

What is your child like?  How does your child deal with 
change and new situations?  Some children need more routine 
and get easily stressed when schedules and surroundings 
change.  Other children are more flexible and adjust to 
changes more easily.  The less flexible child may struggle to 
adjust to differences in sleeping, eating, bathing and other 
routines between two homes.   

.  What is the level of conflict between you and the other parent?  Some 

conflict is normal during separation and divorce.  However, children exposed to high 
levels of conflict feel more anxiety before, during and after exchanges.  If there is 
high conflict, the stress can have lasting negative effects on a child.  Parents who 
have conflict need to develop plans that reduce children’s exposure.  If arguments 
regularly happen during exchanges, think about ways to have less face-to-face 
contact, like using a third party or childcare setting for exchanges. 
 

Many parents who have high conflict reduce children’s exposure by practicing 
parallel parenting which limits the amount of contact they need to have with the 
other parent.  Each parent does things their way on their time.  Parallel parenting is 
not ideal for consistency, but it is much better than exposing your child to on-going 
conflict. 

How well do you and the other parent communicate?  Routine and 
consistency are important for young children.  Your child will do better if you and the 

18

  6. 

 

 

other parent share information about things like bedtimes and meal times, food likes 
and dislikes, illnesses, toilet training, and new abilities of your child.  If your 
communication with the other parent is not where you would like it to be, think 
about a notebook that travels back and forth with your child’s things.  The notebook 
can share important information and details about your child (see the “Sample Co-
Parent Communication Log” in the back of this handbook).  

Does your child have special needs?  A child with colic, sensory issues, or other 
medical conditions can quickly sap your physical and emotional strength.  If you are 
both skilled at meeting your child’s special needs, it may help to create a plan that 
gives each of you a chance for a break.   Sometimes only one parent has the 
patience and time needed to care for the child.  If that is true in your situation, it is 
important to build a network of resources and ask for help when you need it.  

hildren with special needs may be more affected by going back and forth between 

two homes or more at risk for attachment disruptions.   

  7. 

  C

Is there a history of domestic violence?  Young 
children that are around domestic violence are at risk of 
having their development harmed.  The fear and stress that 
exists in a home where there is violence places the child’s 
attachment system in danger.  Some studies show that 
children exposed to domestic violence have more mental 
health problems than children who experienced other forms 
of abuse.  In many states, including Oregon, abusing 
partner when a child is present is a serious crime. 
 
a

f you and/or your children have experienced domestic 
violence, safety must be the first priority.  Safety focused 
parenting plans can help provide safer contact between a

parent and a child and reduce the risk of future violence.   Safety focused plans 
include a many options, from safe public exchange locations to professionally 
supervised parenting time.  More information and resources for parents that have 
experienced domestic violence is in the resources guide in the back of this 
handbook.  
 

  Do you or the other parent have serious problems that affect parenting?   
.
9
A parent with untreated addiction, mental illness, or other serious problems with 
day-to-day functioning is probably not able to respond consistently to the needs of 
an infant or young child.  In addition, a parent with these struggles may be in and 
out of a child’s life, which damages the bond between that parent and child.  Just 
like with domestic violence, safety-focused parenting plan options can apply to these 
situations.

How long will your child have to travel to get back and forth between your homes.  
How does she handle these trips?  What would make your child feel more 
comfortable and secure? 

 

f you can answer most of these questions in a positive way, your child may be in good 
shape to have overnights with the nonresidential parent.  We will talk more about how 
to transition young children to overnights away and what to watch for later in this 
handbook.   

hen a parent needs more skills or a child has problems or special needs, a parent can 

build skills and a child can build comfort by spending more frequent time with each 
other during the day. 

ither way, it is important for you and the other parent to notice how your child is 

doing.  Watch for signs of serious distress (see “Signs of Distress” in the next section).  
Be ready to pull back or slow down if needed, and be careful not to overreact to normal 
distress.

Signs of Distress 

  

ow do I know if my child’s distress is normal? 

Here are some signs that might help parents tell the difference between normal 
and problematic levels of distress. 

  H

While normal distress is predictable and not harmful to young children, consistent or 
unusually high levels of distress can harm young children’s attachment bond, 
emotional stability, and brain development.  Some parenting time schedules 
and/or situations may expose young children to chronic, high levels of stress.  

Normal Separation Anxiety 

Problematic Separation Anxiety 

hild cries or expresses negative feelings when 
separated from you, but calms down after a few 
minutes once you are out of sight. 

hild cries or expresses negative feelings when 

separated from you, but can not be calmed 
down after several minutes and may become 
increasingly upset and inconsolable. 
  

Normal Responses to Reuniting 

Problematic Responses to Reuniting 

hild is happy when they return to you, greets 
you with affection, and can accept warmth and 
affection from you. 

hild is angry, inconsolable, or flat (numb & 

withdrawn) when they return to you and cannot 
accept reassurance from you.  In some cases, the 
child may turn her back, hit or express extreme 
negative feelings toward you. 

Normal Reassurance Seeking Behavior 

Hyper-vigilant Behavior 

hild wants extra reassurance from you, follows 
you a bit more closely, wants to hold your hand, 
needs to be held more, have extra attention, etc.  
This lasts the first day or so after they return, but 
goes away pretty quickly once they settle back 
into your care.  

hild is hyper-vigilant (constantly watching) about 

where you are, cannot let you out of their sight 
during times they used to be able to handle,  
must be held constantly (can’t be put down), 
clings for days, follows you into the bathroom, 
can’t be left at daycare or grandma’s, can’t sleep 
alone, etc. 

Mild and Short-Term Regression 

Serious and Long-Term Regression 

hild uses “baby talk” or wants you to do things 
for them they have learned to do on their own, 
but only for a short time.  They can be redirected 
to more age appropriate behavior. 

hild looses abilities they had previously learned, 

like babbling, rolling over, crawling or walking, 
using the potty, or using language.  These 
abilities disappear for days or weeks at a time. 

Normal Expression of Feelings 

Problems with Expressing Feelings 

hild expresses a broad range of feelings, happy, 

hild’s feelings are flattened (numb & withdrawn) 

sad, mad, etc., and the feelings seem to match 
the situation. 

or way out of proportion to the event that 
triggered the feeling. Child loses interest in 
environment or activities or is chronically tearful, 
angry or sad. 

Normal Acting Out Behaviors 

Concerning Acting Out Behaviors 

hild tantrums, says “no” more, acts irritable and 
cranky, does not follow directions, squabbles with 
peers, but regroups within a day or so. 

hild has extreme acting out behavior, hurts self, 
others, or pets, plays with/smears feces, destroys 
favorite items or toys.  Normal negative behaviors 
become chronic or start to escalate.

Preparing Children for Transitions 

dren under two years have a limited ability to remember over time.  This part of 
l
i
h

memory has not yet developed in their brain.  They cannot predict the return of an 
attachment figure.  Children under two are very sensitive to routines.  Routines give 
them a sense of safety and security.  In addition, children under two do not have 
enough language to tell you how they’re doing or ask for what they need.  Parents have 
to pay attention to children’s nonverbal cues and guess right about what they need.   

 

 

 

ith children under age two, consider the following: 

  Schedule frequent but short parenting time opportunities as children 

under two need frequent contact to bond, but may be stressed by being away 
from a primary attachment figure for too long.  It may help to spend a few hours 
several times a week (ideally at least two or three) with the nonresidential 
parent. Young babies and children may not be able to tolerate an overnight stay 
away from their primary attachment figure and familiar environment. 

  Try to match feeding, nap and activity times so that you reduce the 

amount of change your child has to handle. 

  Share comforting items like a favorite blanket, a pacifier, stuffed animal, 

recorded song, or other things your child uses to self-soothe. 

  If you are thinking about overnights… 

o  Take your time – Too much, too soon might actually slow the process 
down, especially if it causes the child to fear separation and resist 
overnights. 

 

o  Start with naps – Naps allow a child to “practice” falling asleep and 

waking up in a parent’s care without having to deal with darkness or long 
hours away from a primary attachment figure. 

o  Help each other help the child – It is in everyone’s interest for 

overnights to go well.  It can be helpful if the primary attachment figure 
can visit the other parent’s space and help put the child down for naps or 
bedtime at first.  This may let the child know that he is okay. 

o  Be willing to take a step back – Your child will let you know if things 

are going too fast.  As hard as it may be to take a step back, it is 
important to be sensitive to your child’s needs.  A child can spend a lot of 
time with a parent without spending the night.  Taking a step back is 
probably temporary and may actually help things move forward once the 
child has had a chance to settle down.

Children age two to four have a better sense of time and can remember more, 
though still not as much as older children and adults.  They can spend more time away 
from either of their caregivers, even though they may still have separation anxiety when 
away from a primary attachment figure for long periods.  Regular, frequent time with 
both parents is important.  Children this age are more aware of changes in their lives 
and may be more resistant to change than when they were younger.    

For children between two and four, consider the following: 

  Schedule longer but still frequent parenting time.  Children this age can 

usually handle a day or two away from a parent, but miss them and feel 
stressed if the time is longer.  Some can handle overnights, while other toddlers 
are still anxious about sleeping away from the primary attachment figure. 

  Help them prepare for transitions.  It helps to have a routine for 

transitions.  Also, because of their verbal and time skills, reminding children a 
few hours before a transition is helpful.  Telling them you will see them again, 
that they are okay, and that they will have a good time is reassuring. 

  Watch what you say!  Even before they can talk, toddlers understand what 

you say.  They also respond to your tone of voice.  At this age, toddlers identify 
strongly with each parent.  They think you are perfect.  Criticizing the other 
parent can damage a toddler’s self-esteem and trust in each of you.  
  Try to match feeding, nap and activity times so that you reduce the 
amount of change your child has to handle.  This is still important because 
toddlers can be even more sensitive than infants to change.  They can become 
anxious, rigid, or irritable when routines are not predictable. 

  Share comforting items like a favorite blanket, a pacifier, stuffed animal, 
recorded song, or other things your child uses to self-soothe.  By this age 
pictures and Face Time or Skype can also be reassuring. 

  Be ready to adjust and communicate.  The growth and development 

happening in toddlers’ language and memory is significant.  Their progress can 
be rapid.  What they ate yesterday, they hate today.  Their favorite “blankie” is 
a thing of the past, but they can’t let the dog out of their sight.  They used to 
fall asleep with a back rub and now they want story after story.  You have to be 
ready to adjust quickly and talk to each other about the changing moods, 
wants, and habits of your toddler.  

  Holidays and special occasions matter.  At this age children are becoming 
aware of special occasions and holidays, which are large and magical in their 
world.  Think about these occasions when you create your plan.  Older toddlers 
can use a calendar to circle the day they will see the other parent, or celebrate 
a holiday.   

               

 

 

23 

By age four children with two safe homes 
generally do well with overnights with each 
parent. 

 

 

       

Research has found that by age four children with two safe and familiar homes generally 
do well with overnights and lots of time with each parent.  Experts believe that by this 
age, healthy attached children can comfort themselves, ask for what they need, and 
understand enough about time to know they will see the other parent again soon.. 
 

Keep in Mind:  Children are more likely to show their negative reactions to stress when they are with 
the primary attachment figure.  This is because they may feel safest with the primary attachment figure, 
and because young children believe the primary attachment figure is responsible for all good or bad 
f
eelings.

A Warning about TV, Social Media & Young Children 

 

Today’s infants typically start to watch television by 4 months of age.  Research shows 
that viewing TV or having lots of screen time can affect how much and how quickly 
children learn. Below are some important facts about your child and the use of media. 
 

 

 
  Children under five watch an average of 4.5 hours of TV a day (40% of the 

time they are awake).   

  For every hour of noneducational TV a child under 3 watches a day, their risk 

of having attention problems later increases by 10%. 

  Preschool boys who watch violent TV shows (including violent cartoons) are 
three times more likely to have behavior problems by age seven.  The risk 
increases with every hour watched.   

  Children ages 8 to 16 months learned 6 to 8 fewer new words for every hour 
they watched baby DVDs and videos.  In fact, children do not benefit from 
educational videos or shows often marketed to infants and toddlers until after 
age 4. 

  Programs that are noneducational, entertainment oriented (and commonly fast 

action paced) or violent significantly increase the risk of future attention 
problems.   

  The American Pediatric Academy (AAP) recommends no TV and video 

v
ewing for children under 2 and no more than 2 hours a day of any screen 
i
activity for 3 and 4-year-olds.   

  Violent and evening screen time can also increase sleep problems.   

t the end of the day, children learn more from physical, interactive and exploratory 

play, and being read and sung to than from any two-dimensional screen device.

and get into things. They will get bumps, bruises, scrapes and scratches along the way.  
You can protect them from serious injuries. Unintended injury is the leading cause of 
death in U.S. children.  Be aware of:

Bike Safety for Babies: 

Babies around 9 months old are just becoming strong enough to hold up their necks, so it 
is not recommended that infants younger than 12 months ride in a bicycle seat, trailer, 
sidecar or any other carrier. However, when they are ready for a free ride, these safety 
tips can help passengers in a child-trailer or rear-mounted seat enjoy the experience. 

Top Safety Tips for Babies on Bikes 

 

Infants younger than 12 months are too young to sit in a rear bike seat and should 
not be carried on a bicycle. Do not carry infants in backpacks or front carriers on 
bikes.   

  Do not seat babies in slumped positions for long periods of time. 

  The International Bicycle Fund recommends that helmets be round and not aero 

shaped for infants riding in bike seats and trailers, and they should meet American 
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) safety standards. The helmet should 
cover the forehead and not sit on the back of the head. 

  Keep in mind that rides in the infant bike seat will be much rougher than the one 

you experience in the saddle so choose your ride carefully. 

  Many trailers have five-point harnesses, rolling cages, reflectors and safety flags. 
Using a cover can also help prevent materials from flying into your infant's eyes. 

eep yourself safe, too and be a good model!  Wear a helmet!

Summary 
  
Attachment is the deep and lasting emotional bond between a child and a caregiver(s).  
It develops in a child’s first years.  Secure attachments create a strong basis for 
developing trust and self-confidence.  They are the ideal for every child.  Parenting plans 
that protect and support healthy attachments can have a significant impact on emotional 
development during a child’s critical early years.   

he involvement of both parents is extremely important for children.  Even when 
parents are living separately, there are ways for both parents to build and maintain 
connections with a young child, and for each parent to support the other parent’s role 
and relationship with a child.    

he decision about when and how to start overnights in a young child’s life is an 

important one.  Several factors should be considered, including the child’s experience 
with each parent, the child’s temperament, each parent’s ability to provide care, and the 
quality of communication between parents.  Overnights spent away from the parent who 
has been providing the child’s primary care can be difficult for some young children, 
particularly when there is a high level of conflict between parents or when there is a 
history of domestic violence.  Child safety and addressing the child’s needs should 
always come before parents’ interests in fairness.   

ou can enhance your child’s experience with each parent by working cooperatively with 
each other, by learning to notice your child’s signs of distress, and by helping your child 
prepare to go from one parent to the other.  Your child can thrive even when you and 
the other parent are not together.  Parental teamwork can foster healthy emotional 
development in your young child.

primary caregiver or has never lived with the child but wants regular contact.   

  Three periods of 3 to 6 hours spaced throughout the week.  Provides 

frequent contact to support bonding.  Parents need to be able to support 6

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
