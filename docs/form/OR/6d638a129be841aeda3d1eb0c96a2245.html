State of the Oregon Courts:
Justice in the 21st Century

A Message from the Chief Justice

Dear Fellow Oregonians:

It has been both a privilege and an honor to have served this past year as 
Oregon’s 39th Chief Justice. That service has strengthened my belief that 
Oregonians are, and rightly should be, proud of the strong judicial system 
that we have in our great state.  There can be no doubt but that the judicial 
branch of government is fulfilling its role as one of the cornerstones of our 
constitutional democracy.

We must thank a great many individuals, entities, and organizations for 
the Oregon Judicial Department that we have today.  Our partners in the 
Executive and Legislative branches have been instrumental in recognizing 
the important roles that the courts play in protecting children and families, 
enhancing  public  safety,  and  enforcing  economic  and  property  rights.  
Likewise, the business community has acknowledged that an experienced, 
efficient,  and  impartial  bench  is  a  critical  component  of  continued  economic  development  in  Oregon.  
Professional and civic organizations as well have offered their input and assistance when we have needed it 
most.

Above  all  others,  however,  I  acknowledge  and  applaud  the  women  and  men  of  the  Oregon  Judicial 
Department for their tireless efforts, for their dedication, and for their ability to turn limited resources into 
creative solutions. They are unflagging in their commitment to ensuring that the courthouses of this state 
remain open to everyone; resolute that our branch of government produces work for which we can be proud; 
and always mindful that we must continue to manage prudently the public resources with which we have 
been entrusted.

I also want to offer my personal thanks to my predecessor, the Honorable Wallace P. Carson, Jr., Oregon’s 
longest serving Chief Justice.  It is his vision of our court system in Oregon that I have inherited, and I 
am both lucky and thankful for that.  All of us owe Justice Carson a tremendous debt of gratitude for the 
wisdom, passion, and forward thinking that has guided him through his over 40 years of public service.

In the pages that follow, you will be introduced to a judicial system that is strong, accountable, and innovative; 
a third branch of government that is poised to take the administration of justice into the 21st century.  But 
make no mistake about it, poised is all that we are.  The role that courts must play in our constitutional 
government is not the same today as it was a generation or even 15 years ago.  The judicial system of the 
20th century is not equipped to handle the pace, volume, or complexities of the issues that we, as a society, 
are beginning and will continue to face.  Adaptation and evolution are necessities, not options. We must 
continue to provide the level of service that the public has a right to expect.

The Oregon court system is a human institution as well as an accountable public institution.  It therefore is 
fitting and appropriate to share with you the work in which your courts are engaged throughout the state.  
Share in the vision of a court system that is committed to protecting its citizens, strengthening its families, 
cementing the economic ties that bind us together, and providing courthouse doors that open wide to every 
person.

I am looking forward to the years ahead, to working with our partners both inside and outside of government, 
and together accepting the opportunities for constructive change and achievement that the new century is 
providing to all of us. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Respectfully,

Paul J. De Muniz 
Chief Justice 

“[I]n the great enterprise of making democracy workable we are all partners.  One member 

of our body politic cannot say to another – ‘I have no need of thee.’  We work in successful 
cooperation by being true, each department to its own function, and all to the spirit which 

pervades our institutions.”

U

.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, address to Congress (1939).

Oregon Courts Today and Tomorrow:
 An Overview of Our Accomplishments and Our Strategic Priorities

that are unmatched elsewhere in the systems of 
intervention and punishment, and they work largely 
because of the labor-intensive efforts that offer long-
term solutions for the participants.

usiness Courts:  Business moves at a cyber pace 
and often well beyond traditional boundaries such as 
state lines and national borders.  Oregon courts play 
a critical role in our state and national economies 
by providing a forum for the efficient and impartial 
resolution of commercial disputes involving economic 
and property interests.  The Oregon judiciary 
is adapting to meet the complex challenges that 
modern-day business litigation presents.  We owe it to 
ourselves as citizens and to the industries that fuel our 
economic prosperity to maintain a system of justice in 
this state that is the forum of first, not last, resort for 
commercial disputes at every level.

odel Courts:  Oregon courts have taken a 

leadership role in bringing together stakeholders in 
the criminal justice system and members of the child 
welfare system to develop local standards and goals 
to improve criminal and juvenile dependency case 
processing.  Judicial leadership and commitment has 
improved not only the timely resolution of these cases 
but also the effectiveness of the litigation process.

our aCComplishments:   
Oregon Courts Today

“In the 21st century, Oregon’s courts lead the nation 
in providing fair, accessible, and timely justice to 
promote the rule of law, protect individual rights, and 
resolve conflicts.  We respect, reflect, and respond to 
the diverse people we serve.  We earn public trust, 
build partnerships, and promote safe, caring and 
engaged communities.” 
Justice 2020: A Vision for Oregon’s Courts (2001).

The courts of Oregon, both individually and as 

a whole, are committed to working with their 

partners both inside and outside government to 
ensure that Oregonians in the year 2020 and beyond 
will continue to have a responsive, responsible, and 
progressive judicial system.  During 2006, we moved 
closer to realizing our vision in several key areas:

Drug Courts, Mental Health Courts, and other 
Treatment Courts:  Our courts have committed 
not only to maintaining but to enhancing our use 
of specialized courts – courts that collaborate with 
all our partners and stakeholders – to address what 
often are the most difficult cases that come before 
the bench.  These courts work.  They produce results 





Technological Capabilities:  Technology has 
dramatically altered the way in which businesses, 
government, and individuals function.  The judiciary 
is under increasing pressure to adapt as well.  Our 
current case and financial management systems, 
built in the 1980s, are not capable of meeting today’s 
needs.  These systems:  have only a limited ability to 
provide data for managing programs; provide little 
opportunity for the public and other government 
entities to interact with us electronically; and are 
extremely difficult to upgrade to accommodate the 
changing demands of the work we perform.  New 
case and financial management systems need to 
be developed and installed to meet the changes 
in business practices. Oregon’s investment in its 
electronic courthouse will be a significant one, but 
the dividends that the investment will pay will be 
innumerable, and the returns will continue well into 
future generations. 

udicial Personnel:  The demand for judicial services 
in Oregon has steadily outpaced the supply of judges 
available to meet that critical need.  In its November 
2006 report, the Joint Committee on Trial Court 
Judicial Resources, which is composed of 10 members 
appointed by the President of the Oregon State 
Bar and the Chief Justice, has recommended that 
the Legislative Assembly add 13 trial court judge 
positions across the state.  The Judicial Department 
endorses the joint committee’s recommendations.  
With trial court dockets growing at a consistent 
pace for those case categories that require the 
greatest amount of judicial attention, and with only 
conservative additions to the system over the past 
decade, the need for these additional resources is 
great.

  J

The Oregon Judicial Department is committed to 
building on the accomplishments of today and ensuring 
that its courts have the resources Oregonians need for 
tomorrow.

our strategiC priorities:   
Oregon Courts Tomorrow

The key to the success of all of these endeavors, 

and the key to ensuring that the judicial branch 

is equipped to meet the challenges that dispute 
resolution in the 21st century will present, ultimately 
lies in our ability to resolve the following issues facing 
the courts:

Judicial Compensation:  Society’s most difficult 
problems deserve to be answered with the best minds 
and the strongest wills.  We have that now.  Although 
there exists a pressing need for additional judicial 
personnel, the caliber of Oregon’s bench is something 
for other states to envy.  Nevertheless, it remains 
that Oregon’s judges are compensated at a rate far 
below the salaries that judges in other states receive 
– judges who resolve cases of no greater weight than 
our own.  The compensation of Oregon judges ranks 
near the bottom nationally, and Oregon judges have 
not received a pay raise – not even a cost of living 
adjustment – since 2002.  Judicial compensation is 
not a matter of self interest for judges.  It is a matter 
of public policy.  It is a matter of public safety.  It 
is a matter of importance to every Oregonian.  If 
we cannot attract and keep on the bench the most 
qualified, experienced, and dedicated public servants, 
then we are bound to fail to meet our commitment to 
the people of this state.  

Facilities:  Our crumbling judicial infrastructure 
needs serious attention. In Oregon, no measurable 
guidelines establish what features court facilities must 
possess.  Under current law, Oregon’s counties own 
the court facilities and provide them to the state’s 
judicial branch at the counties’ expense.  Aside from 
county general funds, there is no source of funds 
available to use to improve court facilities.  In some 
cases obviously, and in other cases less so, the fact is 
that many of our facilities require substantial upgrade 
or repair.  Some, quite frankly, need to be replaced. 
The ability of all citizens to freely access and safely use 
Oregon courts to conduct their public affairs depends 
on the development of innovative solutions to what 
has become a chronic problem. 

The Oregon Judicial Department: An Overview

organization

Funding

Article VII (Amended), section 1, of the Oregon 
Constitution provides that “[t]he judicial power of 
the state shall be vested in one supreme court and 
in such other courts as may from time to time be 
created by law.”  In 1981, the Legislative Assembly 
consolidated Oregon’s district courts (which since 
have been abolished), circuit courts, tax court, and 
appellate courts into a unified, state-funded court 
system.  The system as we now know it – the Oregon 
Judicial Department (OJD) – became effective on 
January 1, 1983. 

As the Legislative Assembly has shaped Oregon’s third 
branch of government, OJD presently comprises 
a Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Tax Court, 
and 36 circuit courts in 27 judicial districts.  The 
Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court is 
the administrative head of  OJD. Among other 
responsibilities, the Chief Justice appoints a presiding 
judge for each judicial district, the Tax Court, and 
the Court of Appeals and also appoints the State 
Court Administrator, the Judicial Department’s chief 
operating officer.

The Oregon Judicial Department receives its funding 
from three sources:  (1)  legislative appropriations 
from the General Fund; (2) federal funds; and (3) 
other funds (from various fees, proceeds from the 
sale of court publications, and grants).  The total 
budget for the Judicial Department for the 2005-07 
biennium is approximately $305 million.  General 
Fund money supports approximately 89% – or $271 
million – of the courts’ biennial budget.  Federal and 
other funds make up the balance.

For budget purposes, the Oregon Judicial Department 
is grouped with several other public entities – most 
notably the Public Defense Services Commission 
(which is responsible for providing court-appointed 
legal counsel to qualified litigants) – into the “judicial 
branch.”  For 2005-07, the legislature has allocated 
approximately $447 million to the judicial branch 
out of nearly $12.5 billion in approved General and 
Lottery funds.  Overall, the $305 million budget for 
the Oregon court system represents less than 0.7% of 
the overall state budget.

oregon’s Court oF last resort

The Supreme Court is Oregon’s highest court and 
exists by virtue of Article VII (Amended) of the 
Oregon Constitution.  The Supreme Court has 
the ultimate responsibility for announcing and 
interpreting Oregon law. 

The primary work of the Supreme Court is to 
perform its legislatively authorized discretionary 
review of decisions of the Oregon Court of Appeals. 
The court devotes substantial resources toward 
considering whether a particular petition seeking the 
court’s review presents an important question for 
adjudication.   In 2006, the court decided well over 
1,200 petitions asking the court to review a decision 
of the Court of Appeals.

The court’s discretionary jurisdiction competes with 
a substantial number of cases that fall under the 
court’s mandatory jurisdiction – cases that, if filed, 
the Supreme Court has no choice but to decide.  The 
court’s mandatory caseload includes:

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

automatic reviews in death penalty cases (on average, 
five or six such reviews are filed each year; the cases 
are complex and extensively briefed);

appeals from the Oregon Tax Court (an average of six 
cases annually);

appeals (infrequent) involving certain types of labor 
disputes;

(4) 

(5) 

(6) 

(7) 

administrative reviews of prison, energy facility, and 
waste disposal siting decisions (also infrequent but 
often complex);

reviews in lawyer discipline and admissions matters 
(35 to 50 cases annually);

reviews involving questions of judicial fitness and 
disability (approximately one per year); and

specific cases or issues that the legislature has directed 
the Supreme Court to consider (challenges to the 
2003 PERS legislation, as an example).

The court also considers a variety of election-related 
petitions, including ballot title review proceedings 
and challenges to explanatory and fiscal impact 
statements.  On average, mandatory cases account 
for between 30 to 40 percent of the court’s annual 
decisions.

a truly Collegial Court

The Supreme Court considers the judicial matters 
before it en banc, with all seven justices participating 
in the decision.  The court deliberates in conference 
on average three times each month to consider the 
opinion drafts and other matters that are pending 
before the court.  Also, once each month, the 
court holds a public meeting at which it addresses 
important nonadjudicatory matters.  By making its 
deliberations regarding those types of issues open 



The Chief Justice, however, also is the judicial official 
who presides over the Supreme Court.  In that regard, 
Chief Justice De Muniz is overseeing a comprehensive 
courtwide analysis of work distribution among the 
justices and court staff.  Although the outcomes of 
that initiative will be implemented in 2007, the court 
already has committed itself to improving both  
(1) the number of written opinions that it issues and 
(2) the time from filing to decision.  

With respect to the number of opinions, the court in 
2006 will have issued more opinions than in any year 
in the past decade.

With respect to the period between argument or 
submission and issuance of a decision, the court has 
been making steady improvement on its time to 
decision over the past several years while at the same 
time clearing what once was a substantial backlog of 
pending cases.  Of particular note are the facts that 
the court over the past two years has been deciding 
most of its cases within six months and this year 
decided nearly 40 percent of its cases within three 
months from argument or submission.

Court Security Enhancement Program.  Using 
funds dedicated as a result of the passage of House 
Bill 2792 (2005), which established the State Court 
Facilities Security Account, the appellate courts 
have undertaken an aggressive program to enhance 
security in the buildings that house the Supreme 
Court, the Court of Appeals, and the offices of 
the State Court Administrator.  As a result of that 
program, an Oregon State Police trooper now is 
stationed full-time in the Supreme Court building, 
a comprehensive security audit of all appellate and 
administrative offices has been completed, and several 
projects have been initiated to enhance and expand 
the security infrastructures at the nine appellate and 
administrative locations throughout the state – all of 
which have served to increase the safety and security 
of the public and judicial staff who use those state 
facilities.

Geographic Oral Argument Sittings.  Going back 
at least to 1988, the Supreme Court has held some 
of its oral arguments at educational institutions 
across the state.  Making this important aspect of the 
court’s work more accessible to the public enhances 
Oregonians’ understanding of the role that courts 
play in the administration of justice.  Between 2004 
and 2006, the Supreme Court held oral arguments 
annually at each of Oregon’s three law schools and 
visited West Linn, Grant, West Albany, Sandy, 
and Grants Pass high schools as well as Chemeketa 
Community College, Western Oregon University,  
Portland Community College, Ontario, and Baker 
City.

Chief Justice Initiatives. As administrative head 
of the Oregon Judicial Department, Chief Justice 
De Muniz has committed Oregon’s third branch of 
government to producing timely and quality work, 
providing responsible management of the public 
resources entrusted to the courts, and promoting 
access to justice for all Oregonians.  



The Oregon Court of Appeals



The court’s heavy caseload means that each judge 
usually has between 25 to 30 cases assigned at any 
one time to produce a written opinion. Typically, the 
Court of Appeals issues between 350 and 400 written 
opinions each year, a range that the court will well 
exceed in 2006.

*Opinions issued through December 13, 2006

Written opinions provide the most visible aspect of 
the court’s work.  However, those drafting efforts 
compete with myriad other aspects of the judges’ 
responsibilities. One example of the important 
but often unseen work of the Court of Appeals is 
the approximately 1,100 substantive, nonroutine 
motions that litigants file in the Court of Appeals 
each year.  Those substantive motions are in addition 
to the approximately 20,000 administrative motions 
(for extensions of time, to substitute counsel, etc.) 
that are filed and decided annually.  The court has a 
special three-judge department tasked with deciding 
the increasingly complex issues that motion practice 
presents.

the Court’s broad 
responsibilities

The Court of Appeals is Oregon’s intermediate 
appellate court and has 10 judges elected on a 
statewide basis.  By statute, the Court of Appeals is 
charged with deciding nearly all the civil and criminal 
appeals taken from circuit court and nearly all the 
judicial reviews taken from administrative agencies 
in contested cases.  In other words, the judges of the 
Oregon Court of Appeals are quintessential utility 
players, being called on regularly to understand and 
apply procedural and substantive law across the 
broadest possible spectrum.

the Court oF appeals:  oregon’s 
appellate Workhorse

Whether measured against the number of appeals 
taken by population or the number of appeals taken 
per judge, the Oregon Court of Appeals consistently 
ranks as one of the busiest appellate courts in the 
nation.  Over the past decade, the Court of Appeals 
has received, on average, 4,000 filings per year, or 400 
or so cases per judge.  As a collegial court, however, 
most of the court’s decisions are not the product of a 
single judge’s efforts.  Instead, most cases are decided 
by a panel of three judges, and a small percentage are 
determined en banc by the full 10-judge court.  Each 
judge on the Court of Appeals likely participates in 
the decision-making of over 1,000 cases every year.

a better understanding of the work that the other 
judges perform and helps to reduce the instances of 
reversible error on appeal.

The Appellate Case Management System (ACMS).  
In 2005, the Oregon Judicial Department contracted 
for the development of ACMS for the Oregon 
appellate courts.  ACMS will be the appellate courts’ 
first true case management program, allowing 
the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals to 
manage their respective caseloads and provide more 
appropriate and timely information than is available 
using the current system.  The project has been 
broken down into five releases, the first of which will 
be completed in late 2006 and the last of which is 
scheduled for late 2007.

Court of Appeals Performance Measures Project.   
In conjunction with the implementation of ACMS, 
the Court of Appeals established a seven-member 
design team charged with creating a performance 
measurement system anchored by a set of core 
success measures.  Those measures will assess issues of 
quality, timeliness and efficiency, and public trust and 
confidence. 

Juvenile Appeals Work Group.  The appellate courts 
have formed a work group that includes members 
of the Legislative Assembly and representatives of 
the executive branch to study the current system 
of processing and deciding appeals in juvenile 
dependency and termination of parental rights 
cases.  The work group has made recommendations 
to improve the timeliness of decisions in these case 
categories, and the Court of Appeals is in the process 
of implementing those recommendations. 

Internal Processes Assessment.  The Court 
of Appeals also has undertaken to analyze on a 
courtwide basis the internal processes for distributing 
work among its judges and staff.  The court has 
partnered in that effort with the Willamette 
University College of Law to implement an 
intermediate appellate court model that will address 
staffing, workload distribution, and decisions. 

mutual beneFits:  the appellate 
settlement ConFerenCe 
program

The Court of Appeals continues to utilize and 
improve upon its highly effective mediation 
program.  That program allows parties to resolve on 
a collaborative rather than judicial basis between 
125 and 175 civil, domestic relations, and workers’ 
compensation cases each year.  The current settlement 
rate for cases entering the program is approximately 
72 percent, one of the highest in the nation.  Under 
director Judy Henry and with the cooperation of 
numerous stakeholders, the settlement conference 
program is embarking upon the first pilot program 
in the United States to mediate select termination of 
parental rights cases.

Geographic Oral Argument Sittings.  The judges of 
the Court of Appeals continue to hold court sessions 
in schools throughout Oregon, making the process of 
justice both more understandable and more accessible 
to the public.  During 2005 and 2006, the judges 
heard oral argument in McMinnville, Roseburg, 
Bend, Hood River, Canby, Pendleton, Sweet Home, 
Nyssa, Troutdale, and Astoria.

rading Benches Program.  The court developed 
and implemented this program in coordination with 
Oregon’s circuit court judges.  Through the program, 
trial judges periodically sit pro tempore on the Court 
of Appeals while appellate judges perform judicial

aCCess to JustiCe

Although of concern to every court and litigant, 
access to the judicial process is particularly important 
in tax cases, because a substantial number of taxpayers 
elect to defend or prosecute their matters without the 
benefit of attorney representation.  The Tax Court 
has undertaken a number of initiatives to make the 
tax appeal process as transparent and user-friendly as 
possible.  For example, the opinions of the Regular 
Division and the decisions of the Magistrate Division 
are posted to the court’s website and are keyword 
searchable.

n addition, the Tax Court maintains an ongoing 
public outreach program, the primary purpose of 
which is to provide permitted assistance to litigants 
regarding how to proceed with disputes in the Tax 
Court.  For example, the court offers

•  electronic versions of certain forms, including  
  complaint and answer templates and other  
 

frequently used documents;

  a court handbook, including a how-to section on   
  presenting an appeal and an explanation of  
 
  Oregon’s property tax system; 

•  a website that is updated based on user and staff    
  comments;

•  a recently added court calendar that projects court  
  proceedings three months in advance; and 

  I

  •

•  public participation in the court’s annual  
  rulemaking process.
 

Created by statute in 1961, the Oregon Tax Court 
is one of only three state tax courts in the United 
States and, as of 1995, the only tax court that has 
two divisions:  a Regular Division and a Magistrate 
Division.  The Tax Court, which is located in Salem,  
has exclusive statewide jurisdiction over cases that 
involve Oregon’s tax laws.  The magistrates and the 
Tax Court judge decide both the factual and legal 
issues that the cases present – there are no jury trials 
– and any appeal is taken directly to the Oregon 
Supreme Court.

the magistrate diVision: an 
innoVatiVe and eFFeCtiVe idea

In 1995, the Oregon 
legislature transferred the first 
level of tax dispute review 
from the Oregon Department 
of Revenue to the newly 
created Magistrate Division.  
Currently, it takes on average 
only seven months from 
date of filing to the date of a 
magistrate’s written decision.  

Judge Henry Breithaupt 
Tax Court

Litigants who disagree with a magistrate’s decision 
may seek a new trial before Judge Henry Breithaupt 
of the Oregon Tax Court Regular Division. In 
more than 90 percent of the matters decided at the 
Magistrate Division, the parties elect not to seek a 
trial at the Regular Division.

In response to a decline in property tax valuation 
disputes over the past several years, the Tax Court has 
reduced the number of magistrates and operations 
staff.  Those associated resources have been reallocated 
to other courts or Judicial Department divisions 
where they can be put to their highest and best uses.   

ith regard to filings in the Regular Division – which 

have declined as well – Judge Breithaupt initiated a 
partial reallocation of himself as a judicial resource.  
Among other things, he has volunteered to serve pro 
tem as a judge on the Oregon Court of Appeals  and

Verifying Requests for Court-Appointed Counsel.  
Responding to the results of a 2006 audit by the 
Secretary of State’s office, OSCA staff have increased 
their education and training of local court verifiers, 
refined worksheets and electronic calculators, and 
implemented a pilot program to centralize the 
verification of applications for court-appointed 
counsel.  In most cases, OSCA is able to verify the 
eligibility of applicants and notify the requesting 
court within 24 hours.  The pilot program will 
conclude in June 2007 and will provide data on 
the cost effectiveness of verifying 100% of the 
applications for indigent defense services.

Technology Initiatives.  OJD has developed and is 
working to implement a Statewide Strategic Plan that 
includes aggressive information technology initiatives 
that will replace the outdated case register system 
(OJIN), develop e-filing capabilities, create a paperless 
court environment, and improve our technology 
infrastructure. 

Performance Measures.  The administration of 
justice always has been at its most basic level an 
individualized function.  It is appropriate that not 
every case of a certain type should receive the same 
judicial resources. Nevertheless, as accountable public 
institutions, it is equally appropriate that courts adopt 
and maintain standards and measures to guide and 
assess the functioning of the judicial system.  Oregon 
courts have become national leaders in developing 
and using strategic plans and statewide performance 
measures to improve our overall operations. 

The Office of the State 
Court Administrator 
(OSCA) supports the 
Chief Justice in executing 
the administrative 
responsibilities of that 
judicial office and provides 
the majority of the 
infrastructure functions for 
the statewide, state-funded 
court system. 

Consistent and Uniform Purchasing Practices.  
OSCA has created a central procurement unit 
responsible for defining procurement policies and 
procedures for the Judicial Department.  Among 
other benefits, this central unit will create efficiencies 
and permit the coordination of enterprisewide 
procurement initiatives that will allow the judicial 
branch to maximize its purchasing power. 

Improving Collections.  The OJD collections unit 
has strengthened the effectiveness of its collection 
practices statewide.  The unit has replaced the old 
system of manual data entry with a newly developed 
automated interface with the Department of Revenue 
(DOR).  Now courts are able to update their case files 
automatically with financial information from DOR.  
The new process eliminates errors and provides for the 
timely input of data.

Accommodating Persons with Disabilities.  The 
Oregon Supreme Court / Oregon State Bar Joint 
Task Force on Access to State Courts for Persons 
with Disabilities, which Multnomah County Circuit 
Court Judge Janice Wilson chaired, published its 
final report in August 2006.  The report contains 
recommendations to OJD, building owners that 
house state courts, and the Oregon State Bar.  As part 
of the task force process, all state courts and OSCA 
evaluated access to their facilities, programs, and 
materials and should have transition plans in place 
by the end of 2006 to implement the task force’s 
recommendations.  

Ensuring Meaningful Participation.  OJD’s Court 
Interpreter Services (CIS) staff developed and piloted 
a qualification system for languages that Oregon does 
not certify.  As part of that system, CIS is offering 
court interpreter training for a pilot group who speak 
certain African languages and dialects.  After the pilot 
program has concluded, OJD expects to offer these 
training opportunities to all noncertified language 
speakers.

Keeping the Doors Open to Low Income and Pro 
Se Litigants.  The Judicial Department in 2006 
established a workgroup tasked with improving the 
process by which low-income litigants seek a waiver 
or deferral of court fees and costs.  The workgroup 
has prepared draft legislation to update and revise the 
relevant statutes, created forms for litigants to use, 
and recommended standards for courts to apply in 
considering those requests. 

In addition, OJD staff and the State Family Law 
Advisory Committee (SFLAC) have worked closely 
together to improve the functioning of facilitation 
programs across the state.  Those programs 
assist unrepresented family law litigants with the 
preparation and filing of court documents.  That 
assistance not only improves access to the court 
system, but also assists the courts by ensuring that 
documents are both accurate and correctly filed. 

Finally, in April 2006, SFLAC sponsored a statewide 
conference for judges, attorneys, and others involved 
in family law cases to address the issues presented by 
the increasing number of self-represented litigants 
in domestic relations proceedings.  The conference 
paid specific attention to the practical aspects of how 
to best serve those litigants both in and out of the 
courtroom.
 

Justice 2020: Our Vision for Oregon’s Courts

an 

In 1992, as the first decade of a unified court system in Oregon approached, Chief Justice Wallace 
P
. Carson, Jr. called for a conference to study the future of Oregon’s courts. Participants included, 
among others, judges, court administrators, legislators, local government officials, attorneys, 
police, corrections officials, social service representatives, and the media. From that work, a Future 
of the Courts Committee was established that, in 1995, created a written vision for Oregon courts 
in the year 2020. Entitled “Justice 2020: The New Oregon Trail,” that vision statement informed 
and guided the administration of the state court system for six years.

The future, however, sets its own pace. In 1998, the Chief Justice decided that the committee 
should both expand and update the vision of Oregon’s judicial branch. The committee developed 
a new vision statement, “Justice 2020: A Vision for Oregon’s Courts,” which the  
Chief Justice approved in 2001. To ensure that the department’s vision becomes a reality, the 
statement identifies five core components, provides specific goals relating to those components, 
and lists 10 suggested practices for achieving each goal. (The full vision is available at  
http://www.ojd.state.or.us/osca/cpsd/programplanning/futures/index.htm .)  
The components, together with the department’s overarching goals for those components, are:

•  ACCESS: To ensure access to court services for all people.
•  ADMINISTRATION: To make courts work for people.
•  DISPUTE RESOLUTION: To help people choose the best way to resolve their disputes.
•  PARTNERSHIPS: To build strong partnerships with local communities to promote public safety  
  and quality of life.
•  TRUST and CONFIDENCE: To earn the public’s enduring trust and confidence.

The Circuit Courts of Oregon

oVerVieW

The circuit courts are Oregon’s trial courts.  They 
are courts of general jurisdiction, which means that 
circuit courts hear cases regardless of the subject 
matter, amount of money involved, or severity 
of the crime alleged.  In the 2005-06 fiscal year, 
approximately 610,000 cases – including violations 
(such as parking tickets and most traffic citations) 
– were filed in Oregon’s circuit courts.

To handle the volume of cases, each of Oregon’s 36 
counties has a circuit court.  In most counties, the 
court is located in the county courthouse.  In a few 
counties – Multnomah County, for example – the 
court has offices and courtrooms in more than one 
location.  For administrative purposes, the Legislative 
Assembly has divided the state into 27 judicial 
districts. 

Judges and proFessional staFF

The Legislative Assembly also determines, based on 
considerations that it determines appropriate (such as 
population and case volume), the number of judges 
elected in each judicial district.  As of January 1, 
2007, Oregon has 173 circuit court judges statewide.  

In the 2005-06 fiscal year, the judges of Oregon’s 
circuit courts conducted over 24,000 trials.

The Chief Justice appoints a presiding judge for each 
judicial district. The presiding judges exercise general 
administrative authority and supervision over their 
districts and apportion the workload, make rules, 
and issue administrative orders.  Presiding judges 
also appoint and supervise the professional trial 
court administrators who manage the nonjudicial 
operations of the trial courts.

distribution oF Caseload and 
Workload

The circuit courts assess judicial and staff workload 
by applying different weights to each case type.  A 
weighted analysis derives from the fact that all 
case filings are not equal.  For example, although 
violations constituted over 44% of the total filings 
in the 2005-06 fiscal year, violations represent less 
than 4% of judicial workload and about 12% of staff 
workload.  By comparison, criminal cases – which 
represented only 17% of the total filings in the circuit 
courts – consumed almost 40% of judicial workload 
and 46% of staff workload.

case filings.  However, because violations constitute 
such a large proportion of all filings, fluctuations in 
violation filing rates tend to drive raw filing totals 
disproportionately and obscure trends for other types

The study of Multnomah County’s pioneering effort 
included the following findings:

  The Multnomah County Drug Court costs $1,442 less  
  per participant than “business as usual.”

•  The total cost and investment savings to taxpayers  
  over a 30-month period (including victimization costs)  
  averaged $5,072 per drug court participant.

•  With 300 participants entering Multnomah County  
  Drug Court every year, the savings to taxpayers exceeds  
  $1.5 million.

  •

Our constitutional democracy is founded in part 
on the principle that the judiciary is a co-equal 
and independent branch of government.  Yet, in 
many important ways, the judiciary in Oregon is an 
interdependent branch of state government as well.  
The overarching theme of the Judicial Department’s 
own vision of the future is one of cooperation.  The 
problems that society faces today do not fit neatly 
within the lines where one department of government 
ends and another begins.  These complex issues 
demand interdisciplinary solutions.

Some of the most exciting work in which the 
judiciary has been recently engaged involves the 
intersection of law and social policy.  Treatment-
oriented, “model,” and community courts are not just 
the courts of the future; they are the courts of today.  
And they work.  These resource-intensive courts work 
not only because they resolve the immediate issue that 
has put the litigants before a judge, but also because 
they involve our partners in the community coming 
together to address the underlying problems that, if 
not met head-on, will tend to bring these individuals 
and those around them back into court.

treatment Courts

Drug treatment courts, juvenile drug courts, family 
dependency treatment courts, mental health courts, 
and DUII courts all are part of our circuit courts’ 
programs designed to improve outcomes for people 
who are addicted to drugs or alcohol, or who have 
mental health issues.  These courts use a collaborative, 
community-based problem solving model to 
improve lives, reduce crime, and promote healthy 
communities. 

Treatment Courts Save Taxpayers Money
Although comprehensive treatment requires a 
substantial commitment of both time and money, 
the investment is a prudent one.  While cost savings 
has not been determined on a statewide basis, in 
July 2003, the Northwest Professional Consortium 
performed what has become a nationally recognized 
evaluation work on the second drug court to be 
established in the United States:  the Multnomah 
County STOP program.  The results of that 
evaluation can be found at http://www.npcresearch.com. 

Moreover, data from the 2004-05 fiscal year revealed 
that 28% of Oregon’s drug court participants had 
minor dependents (representing 395 children) 
and that 26% of unemployed participants (182 
individuals) gained employment during treatment, 
which demonstrates that addressing drug addiction 
reduces the need to provide addicts and their families 
with other forms of public assistance.

Treatment Courts Reduce Future Crimes
Building on the successes of the early efforts to 
establish drug courts, particularly in the area of 
recidivism, courts across the country and in Oregon 
are expanding the principles that motivate those 
programs into other areas such as mental health and 
driving under the influence of intoxicants.  During 
2006, Oregon courts received both federal and state 
grants to expand services or start new treatment court 
programs.  Currently Oregon has 46 such courts:

With regard to the 25 adult drug courts in Oregon, 
initial reports show that Oregon’s drug courts are 
working.  Judicial Department data show, that, of 
the 1,869 drug court graduates between January 1, 
2001 and June 30, 2005, 1,677 (90%) had no new 
misdemeanor or felony charges in an Oregon circuit 
court in the year after graduating – a recidivism rate 
that the traditional system cannot match.

or Felony Charges One Year After Graduation

Legislative Efforts to Expand Drug Courts
House Bill 2485 (2005) addressed the public 
safety and public health issues associated with 
methamphetamine use in Oregon. That legislation 
provided general funds for expanding Oregon’s active 
drug court programs and creating new drug courts.  
These new funds were used primarily to support 
drug treatment services for participants.  The funds 
also supported a total of 3.5 full-time drug court 
coordinator positions divided among five of the 
programs.

Moreover, and although the number of participants

the 90% success rate for the first part of 2005 is 
reflective of the figures for 2001 through 2004, which 
also meet the Judicial Department’s Legislatively

driVing under the inFluenCe oF 
intoxiCants (duii) Courts

DUII courts closely supervise individuals who are a 
significant risk to the community based on having 
had multiple convictions of driving under the 
influence.  Currently, Oregon has two DUII courts in 
operation.  One is in Clackamas County; the other is 
in Multnomah County.

The program in Multnomah County is well 
established.  Over a roughly seven-year period (1998 
through 2004), the program tracked recidivism rates 
for 456 graduates and 209 participants who had 
their probations revoked.  Only 5.7% of graduates 
had a later DUII arrest or conviction, compared 
to 17.2% of those who failed to complete the 
program.  Overall, 73% of graduates had no new 
arrests or offenses in any category, while only 40% of 
nongraduates managed to avoid re-offending.

The numbers are just as promising out of the newly 
established DUII court in Clackamas County.  To 
date, there have been 34 referrals, and 13 defendants 
have entered the 18-month program.  none of the 
current participants has had a new charge since 
starting the program.  

Mental Health Courts
Mental health courts borrow heavily from the 
successful drug court concept.  They provide a 
continuum of services for nonviolent offenders who 
are willing to accept a package of social services in 
lieu of being jailed and later released without having 
received any treatment of their underlying conditions.  
Six mental health courts are currently operating in 
five Oregon counties: Clackamas, Coos, Deschutes, 
Lane, and Yamhill.

Model Court for Juvenile Cases
The Juvenile Court Improvement Project (JCIP) 
Model Court Program was designed to assist local 
courts with taking the lead in the development of 
county-level intergovernmental plans supporting 
permanency outcomes for children in foster care.  The 
program is patterned after a successful project that 
the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court 
Judges implemented in pilot sites across the country.

Model Court for Criminal Cases
Delay in the administration of justice is widely 
considered one of the most destructive and avoidable 
issues facing courts today.  Not surprisingly, reducing 
delay has been the primary focus of reform efforts 
since the 1970s.  In September 2004, the Governor’s 
Criminal Justice System Task Force presented the 
Chief Justice’s Criminal Justice Advisory Committee 
(CJAC) with a number of recommendations designed 
to reduce trial setovers and otherwise reduce the time 
to disposition in criminal cases.

CJAC, with input from judges, prosecutors, and 
criminal defense lawyers, responded by developing a 
“best practices” menu for every stage of the criminal 
adjudicatory process to improve the flow of cases 
through the system.

CJAC further developed a model criminal court 
project and selected five counties for the pilot 
program (Yamhill, Lane, Umatilla, Washington, and 
Douglas). Each county’s diverse model court team has 
developed and implemented initiatives focusing on 
one or more of the following areas, among others:

•  enhancing the use of early disposition programs at or  
  near arraignment;

•  requiring mandatory status checks for readiness to  
  proceed to trial;

•  streamlining assignments among the various judges;

•  adopting differentiated case management procedures for  
  different types of case categories;

•  offering increased judicial management of plea  
  negotiations; and

 

•  improving the notices that defendants receive about  
 

future proceedings.

Community Courts

Community courts are neighborhood-focused 
initiatives that seek to harness the power of the justice 
system to solve local problems.  The key to these 
courts is involving the broader community in the 
justice process, such as neighbors, victims, merchants, 
churches, and schools, and compelling offenders to 
confront the impact of their crimes on the area in 
which they live. Clackamas County has a community 
court, and Multnomah County – under the 
leadership of Presiding Judge Dale Koch – currently 
has four such courts in operation.

Yamhill County’s Model Court Experience

As part of the model criminal court pilot program, 
one goal of the Yamhill County Circuit Court was 
to establish a set of best practices to reduce the 
number of trial setovers.  With the assistance 
of Presiding Judge John Collins, the county’s 
model court team developed and implemented 
a continuance policy that, among other things, 
requires all requests for postponement be made 
to the presiding judge.  The results of that effort 
in felony cases over the last 1½ years have been 
impressive.

model court project into the domestic relations 
context.

Serving the Needs of Oregon’s Business Community

Courts must remain sensitive to the need of the 
private sector for a fair, efficient, and expeditious 
means of resolving those disputes that businesses 
choose to litigate in a public forum.  In an age of 
alternative dispute resolution and private justice 
through arbitration, use of the term “choose” is 
appropriate.  It is both good business and sound 
public policy for the courts of this state to provide the 
forum of choice to resolve those issues on which our 
state’s economic well-being in good measure depends.  
Our courts are transparent, permit community 
involvement through trial by jury and in other ways, 
and establish precedents for industry to use in the 
shaping of its business practices.

lane County CommerCial Court

In recognition of that need, and under the leadership 
of Presiding Judge Mary Ann Bearden, the Judicial 
Department in November 2006 launched its first 
“commercial court” in Lane County.  Parties to cases 
in the Lane County Circuit Court – and parties to 
cases in any other circuit court in the state – may 
apply to the Presiding Judge of Lane County to have 
their cases assigned to the pilot program.  The court 
considers, among others, the following types of cases 
and issues:

litigation;

•  products liability, medical-device, and pharmaceutical  
 
•  commercial real property disputes;
•  technology and intellectual property cases;
•  securities transactions;
•  mass tort and other multi-party business or class action  
 
•  environmental litigation, including insurance coverage  
  disputes;
•  land use cases; and
•  complex construction, insurance, professional liability,  
  and business litigation.

litigation;

Once accepted into the program, the case is assigned 
to the direct supervision of a single judge (with 
dedicated administrative and technical support) 
for all purposes, including referral to mediation, 
assignment to a settlement judge, and trial.  A case 
management conference for these complex disputes 
will be scheduled within 30 days of the assignment, 
at which time a trial date within 12 months will be 
set, discovery and motion practice deadlines will be 
established, and other potential roadblocks to a timely 
disposition will be addressed.

Also, for those cases that do not resolve with the 
assistance of mediation or a settlement judge, the 
parties will be required to disclose all exhibits except 
impeachment exhibits within 10 days of trial.  That 
mandatory disclosure, which is not provided for 
elsewhere under Oregon law, will provide litigants 
with additional certainty about the strengths and 
weaknesses of both their and their opponents’ cases.  
With an increased level of certainty comes the ability 
to better evaluate a case based on objective business 
considerations, rather than speculation.

Finally, the Lane County Circuit Court has committed 
itself to tracking cases in its program, maintaining a 
database of commercial cases accepted and denied, and 
posting some of its decisions on the court’s website 
– http://www.ojd.state.or.us/lan/index.htm.

The Judicial Department is looking forward to the 
results of this important initiative and transplanting it 
to other courts throughout the state.

multnomah County reFeree system

Civil litigation involving large construction projects 
requires special handling.  To meet this need, the 
Multnomah County Circuit Court has adopted and 
made available a referee system for these disputes.  
Using the system is optional, but for large, complex 
cases the system is very beneficial.  Under this 
program, the presiding judge allows parties to choose 
one of two case systems for construction litigation:  
(1) the normal 12-month trial system; or (2) the 
new referee system.  If the parties choose the normal 
system, then they will not be granted trial extensions 
beyond the 12-month period absent extenuating 
circumstances.

Under the referee system, however, the parties pay 
the referee’s fees, and the referee has the authority 
to manage discovery and case scheduling, including 
the setting of a trial date within 15 months of the 
initial filing date of the case.  The referee also has the 
authority to extend the trial date to 18 months from 
initial filing on motion of a party and a showing of 
good cause.  Any request for trial extension beyond 
18 months requires the referee’s recommendation to 
do so and approval by the presiding judge.  

Multnomah County’s program is a win-win for the 
court, the bar, and the parties.  The court benefits 
from freeing up judicial resources while the lawyers 
and the parties benefit from the closer attention that 
referees can provide for these most complex of cases.

Combating Violence Against Women

  http://www.ojd.state.or.us/osca/cpsd/courtimprovement/ 
 
familylaw/DomesticViolenceVer2.htm. The website  
  contains a wealth of information for petitioners,   
 

respondents, and attorneys.

  The Judicial Department is developing a technical  
  assistance guide to help existing and emerging courts  
 
interested in establishing domestic violence court  
  programs.

  •

The Oregon Department of Human Services 
estimates that there are approximately 78,289 victims 
of physical violence and 24,640 victims of sexual 
assault in Oregon each year.  In 2005, prosecutors 
filed more than 7,000 cases in Oregon’s circuit courts 
alleging at least one count of Assault IV, a charge 
commonly associated with domestic violence.  Those 
numbers are disturbing and demand the attention of 
government at all levels.

In 2006, the Judicial Department applied for and 
received a grant from the Criminal Justice Services 
Division (CJSD) of the Oregon Office of Homeland 
Security.  The grant was part of the STOP (Services, 
Training, Officers, Prosecutors) Violence Against 
Women Program that promotes a coordinated and 
integrated approach to improving the criminal justice 
system’s response to women who are victimized.

The Judicial Department has applied that grant 
money toward funding a multi-pronged effort focused 
on improving the availability of services for Oregon’s 
victims of domestic violence.  Specifically:

•  The judicial branch’s Domestic Violence Subcommittee  
  of State Family Law Advisory Committee has  
 
  website, which can be found at:  

implemented an OJD “Domestic Violence Resources”  

 

•  The grant provided an opportunity for five OJD judicial  
  officers to attend the U.S. Department of Justice, Office  
  on Violence Against Women’s Enhancing Judicial Skills  
 
in Domestic Violence Cases training.  Those five judicial  
  officers gained valuable instruction on domestic violence  
 
issues, will be able to handle domestic violence cases  
  more effectively, and will be better equipped to work  
  with the vulnerable population of women associated with  
 

these proceedings.

•  The grant is supporting a multi-disciplinary work  
  group that is evaluating issues surrounding the entry of  
  no-contact provisions into the Law Enforcement Data  
  System (LEDS) and is working to develop system  
requirements for the future electronic transfer of  
 
 
information directly into LEDS.  Ensuring that law  
  enforcement knows when a no-contact order is in place  
 
is a matter of high priority, particularly in the critical  
  period when defendants are released from custody.

Multnomah County’s Domestic Violence Reduction Program

Using a 2005 STOP Violence Against Women Act Formula Program 
Grant, the Multnomah County Circuit Court opened the Judge Stephen 
B. Herrell Domestic Violence Reduction Program (DVRP) in 2006.  The 
program honors the memory of Judge Stephen B. Herrell, who passed 
away in 2006, and who spent his entire judicial career on the bench 
advocating for improvements in the way courts and the community 
address crimes of domestic violence.

Judge Stephen B. Herrell
Multnomah County 
Circuit Court

The DVRP creates a court that manages all pretrial, sentencing, and 
probation decisions in domestic violence misdemeanor offenses and 
punitive contempt actions for the violation of a restraining order.  
Managing these cases in a single venue permits the judge to maintain 

tight case controls and impose uniform sanctions on conviction that address both the behavioral 
and public safety concerns that surround these offenders.

During the first six months of operation, the court received 581 misdemeanor offenses, 166 
punitive contempt actions, and 113 probation violations.  As the court continues, the volume of 
cases and violations will continue to grow.  The one-year grant expired on July 1, 2006; however, 
the court is committed to the program and has been using its own resources and those of its 
community partners to ensure its continuation.

Ensuring Safe and Continual Operations

enhanCing seCurity

Following the Legislative Assembly’s enactment of 
legislation in 2005 addressing the issue of court 
security, the Judicial Department has developed 
security programs for judges, court staff, and law 
enforcement.  Also, the department’s Security & 
Emergency Preparedness Committee has prepared 
a Model Security Improvement Plan and has 
distributed the template to each circuit court to aid 
those courts in the development of their individual 
local plans. 

emergenCy preparedness and 
business Continuity planning

The Judicial Department also is actively participating 
in the Department of Administrative Services’ 
Business Continuity Planning project to design 
an integrated strategy to ensure delivery of critical 
business services from all three branches of 
government in the event of a natural disaster or a 
security breach.  This is a statewide initiative in which 
the judiciary has an important role to play.  We 
are working to identify each of our mission critical 
functions, to prioritize those functions (according 
to, among other things, how quickly they must be 
restored to meet statutory or other requirements), and 
to provide business continuity plans for the functions 
of highest priority by the beginning of 2007.

The judicial branch of government has an obligation 
to provide services regardless of political, economic, 
or natural circumstances.  The disruption of judicial 
processes in Louisiana and Mississippi following 
Hurricane Katrina emphasized the need for plans to 
ensure the safe and continued operation of Oregon’s 
courts no matter what the conditions.  Indeed, it is 
precisely in those times of crisis that the rule of law is 
needed most.

Closer to home, at least two separate events have 
served to remind us of the need for constant vigilance 
when it comes to court security.  First, in late 
February 2005, an act of arson destroyed the court 
facility in Hermiston, the blaze taking with it many of 
the court’s paper files.  Two court employees worked 
for the better part of three months to recreate those 
records, and the judge and seven court staff were 
forced to move to temporary facilities before a new 
county government building opened in March 2006.

Second, in November 2005, a man drove a pickup 
truck through the front doors of the Marion County 
Courthouse and, during the four-hour period 
that followed before he was apprehended, set fires 
inside the courthouse that damaged nearly all of the 
contents of the court’s offices.  

residing Judge Paul Lipscomb was instrumental in 
coordinating the effort to relocate court operations 
temporarily – moving 14 judges and 90 judicial 
staff to nine separate locations – and ensuring that 
essential hearings occurred on the next judicial day 
following the attack.  (Jury trials were cancelled for 
the first week only.)  He also worked with Marion 
County officials and others to both repair and 
upgrade the facility.  Rededicated in September 2006 
as the result of a tremendous cooperative effort, 
the building is now one of the most modern and 
technologically equipped courthouses in the state. 
In December 2006, Judge Lipscomb received the 
Oregon State Bar’s Award of Merit, the highest honor 
that the Bar bestows.

Building the Most Accessible Courthouse in Oregon

The past three decades have seen more change in the 
way courts operate than in the entire century before.  
Technology has dramatically altered the way in which 
businesses, government, and individuals function.  
The judiciary is under increasing pressure to adapt 
as well.  Our current case and financial management 
systems, built in the 1980s, are not capable of 
meeting today’s needs.  

task 4 – building the Courtrooms:  
New case and financial management systems need 
to be developed and installed to meet the changes 
in business practices brought about by information 
being accessed and received through the Web portal.  
Consistent data entry protocols will be implemented 
statewide to ensure the availability of management 
and outcome-related data.

task 5 – building the baCk door:  
We will create a common interface allowing our 
public and private stakeholders to send and receive 
data from systems electronically.  Some of the groups 
and individuals who will benefit from this aspect of 
the electronic courthouse are:

•   state agencies such as Corrections, the Criminal Justice  
  Commission, Human Services, and Motor Vehicles;
•   county and municipal entities such as sheriffs, district  
  attorneys, and local human service agencies; and
•   other partners such as attorneys and local treatment  
  providers.

Oregon’s investment in its electronic courthouse 
will be a significant one, but the dividends that the 
investment will pay will be innumerable, and the 
returns will continue well into future generations. 

In response, the Judicial Department has committed 
itself to building what will become the largest and 
most accessible “courthouse” in Oregon: a statewide 
electronic courthouse. That courthouse will provide 
a common experience for all citizens of the state, no 
matter where they are located.  It will be the one place 
a citizen may visit and do business with any court in 
the state, at any time of the day, from anywhere in the 
world.  And it will be constructed in five years.

Completing Oregon’s electronic courthouse will 
require five major tasks:

task 1 – building the Foundation:   
The construction of an improved network and 
a modern data center will enhance the flow of 
information statewide. 

task 2 – building the Front door:  
The installation of a Web portal with common access 
to all court services in each circuit court will allow the 
judiciary to provide:

•  electronic documents and case status;
•  electronic case filing; and
•  common forms. 

task 3 – building the interior 
FrameWork:  
The implementation of new, consistent business 
practices statewide will permit the flow of 
standardized information in and out of the courts and 
will maximize the efficient use of the courthouse.

Recognition and Thanks

The courts of this state belong to all Oregonians.  
Nowhere is that ownership interest better 
demonstrated than in the nearly 1 million hours that 
citizens give to our court system each year.  These 
people are our neighbors who serve on juries, our 
friends who review the case plans of children in 
foster care, and our fellow citizens who volunteer 
their valuable time as mediators in small claims and 
landlord / tenant cases.  We work carefully with 
those people and all the other Oregonians who give 
generously of their time, wisdom, and experiences to 
ensure that equal justice is provided to all.

The judges and staff of Oregon’s state court system 
value tremendously the unique and irreplaceable role 
that our citizens play as volunteers. It is appropriate 
that all those volunteers be recognized and thanked 
publicly for their efforts.  Ultimately, there can be no 
justice without them.

Jurors

The right to trial by a jury is a fundamental 
protection – enshrined in both our state and federal 
constitutions – that each of us enjoys and that is an 
important part of our heritage.  It is a particularly 
vivid example that ours, as Abraham Lincoln 
observed, is a government “of the people, by the 
people, for the people.”

Jury service is a significant civic responsibility and a 
fundamental duty of citizenship designed to protect 
our many rights and privileges.  Citizens served nearly 
200,000 jury service days from July 1, 2005 through 
June 30, 2006.  At the same time, the limited fees and 
expenses that state law provides to jurors often means 
that jury service calls on jurors, their families, and 
their employers to sacrifice time, work, and money to 
preserve justice and the rule of law in our society.

Oregon’s courts have been working to encourage 
people to respond to their summonses and appear 
for jury service.  All courts periodically solicit 
feedback from jurors on their individual jury 
service experiences, and many courts have made 
improvements to juror room facilities this past year.  
The courts take the matter of juror satisfaction very 
seriously, so seriously that it is one of the performance 
measures that the courts track.  Beginning with the 
current biennium, the goal is to move from at least an 
85% satisfaction rating to a 95% overall satisfaction 

rating by the 2007-09 biennium.  In 2006, 94% of 
jurors reported that they were satisfied with their jury 
experience.

Citizen reVieW board members

The Citizen Review Board (CRB) is a Judicial 
Department program that includes 375 community 
volunteers who serve on 88 boards in 33 of Oregon’s 
36 counties.  CRB volunteer board members have a 
dual mandate (1) to review the cases of children and 
youth in the foster care system; and (2) to analyze 
trends and advocate for improvements to the system.  
Both mandates focus on making sure that foster care 
remains a temporary stop on the way to a permanent 
home.  From July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006, 
CRB volunteers reviewed the case plans of 8,828 
children and youth in foster care.  Board members 
served approximately 74,950 hours volunteering in 
this critical aspect of the judiciary’s work.

mediators

Oregon courts have a strong tradition of volunteer-
based mediation dating back to the late 1980s.  In 
those programs, trained volunteers meet with their 
fellow citizens in a confidential setting to discuss 
whether there is a mutually acceptable resolution to 
their dispute before going to trial.  Any agreement 
reached is enforceable as a court order, giving the 
parties the same rights as those who go to trial. 

In several communities, court-connected volunteer 
mediation programs are provided by local nonprofit 
or government-based Community Dispute 
Resolution Centers (CDRCs).  In addition to their 
court mediation programs, these CDRCs provide a 
wide range of other volunteer mediation services for 
their communities.  By partnering with these local 
resources, courts often are able to make referrals to 
mediation before any case is filed, thereby minimizing 
the impact of community conflict on the resources of 
the Judicial Department.  

In 2006, 252 Oregonians served approximately 7,318 
hours as volunteer mediators in their communities in 
the following areas:

•  20 counties mediate small claims cases;
•  11 counties mediate residential landlord / tenant  
  cases; and 
•  1 county mediates truancy cases.

the problem

The compensation that Oregon judges receive 
for the demanding and critical work they 
perform on behalf of the citizens of this state 
is inadequate.  It has been inadequate for a 
long time.  Oregon historically ranks at or near 
the bottom in terms of judicial compensation 
compared to other states.  And judges in Oregon 
have not received a salary increase – not even 
a cost of living adjustment – since 2002.  The 
problem is acute, and it is not a matter of judicial 
self interest.  The effects of judicial pay for 
state court judges are now being seen, and the 
future of the Oregon court system depends in 
substantial measure on how we respond.

Commenting on the compensation of federal 
judges, the late Chief Justice of the United 
States Supreme Court, the Honorable William 
Rehnquist, stated in 2003 that “[w]e cannot 
continue to use an arrangement for setting 
pay that simply ignores the need to raise pay 
until judicial and other high-level government 
salaries are so skewed that a large (and politically 
unpopular) increase is necessary.”  That, however, 
is the situation we face today in Oregon.  To even 
begin to level the playing field, Oregonians – 
through the Legislative Assembly – must commit 
the resources that will enable us to maintain the 
most critical element of an effective judiciary:  
dedicated and experienced judges.

Whether compared against the salaries of judges 
across the country or against the salaries of 
judges in the western states, or compared against 
the compensation of public lawyers in Oregon 
or other professionals in state government, the 
salaries that we pay to our judges lie at or near 
the bottom of the comparisons.  Yet Oregon 
judges work just as hard on cases just as complex 
as those before judges in our neighboring 
states and across the country.  And they play 
just as important a role in Oregon’s system of

It is important to remember that the ranking 
set out above is based on salary figures from 
2006.  The goal posts in other states are 
continuing to move.  For example, the salary that 
Montana will pay to its trial court judges will 
increase to $99,234 effective July 1, 2007, with 
corresponding increases at the appellate level, 
which then will place Oregon squarely at the 
bottom of the judicial pay scale in the west.

Why the problem is important 
to eVery oregonian

For every defendant awaiting sentencing, for 
every business facing serious and expensive 
litigation, for every family struggling through 
marital dissolution proceedings, for every injured 
person awaiting his or her day in court, and for 
every other litigant or victim when her, his, or 
its vital interests are at stake, it means everything 
that the judge those litigants face is fair, impartial, 
focused, and experienced.  It means everything 
that the judge in whose hands so much is placed 
is the best person for that job on that day.

Few civil servants have either the opportunity 
or the responsibility to impact so directly and 
immediately the lives of the public they serve 
in the way that the judges of Oregon do day in 
and day out.  Oregonians need to ensure that 
the compensation that judges receive is both fair 
and adequate so as to make sure that the best, 
brightest, and hardest working lawyers in this 
state will continue to forego lucrative careers 
in private practice for government service.  It is 
becoming increasing difficult to justify to one’s 
self and to one’s family a decision to seek the 
bench when judges make less than first-year 
lawyers at Oregon’s largest and most prestigious 
law firms, when it is known that no attempt has 
been made even to keep judicial pay consistent 
with inflation for the last four years, and when 
many other public officials and public lawyers are 
paid more.

It is of course tempting to compare the 
salary that judges receive with the wages that 
Oregonians in other parts of government and 
in the private sector earn for the long hours 
they work on behalf of their employers.  Judges 
recognize that, under such a comparison, they 
are paid generously.  And they also recognize 
that there are many intangible benefits that go 
along with judicial service.  But, in the end, this 
is not about the judges themselves.  This is about 
the judicial system and ensuring that the salaries 
we pay are sufficiently competitive to make it 
feasible for some of the best lawyers in Oregon 
to bring their talents to bear on society’s most 
difficult issues. 

As noted above and elsewhere, we have an 
outstanding judiciary in this state, but the 
chronic nature of judicial underpayment is 
beginning to take its toll on our bench.  For 
example, although judges in Oregon do not 
have life tenure as in the federal courts, lawyers 
in Oregon generally make the transition from 
practice to the bench with career-long rather 
than short-term expectations.  The period 
between age 60 and retirement often proves to 
be the most valuable period that a judge serves, 
because of the experience gained from prior years 
of judicial service.  We need to maximize the 
benefit to the public, the bench, and the bar that 
only veteran judges can provide.

In Oregon, however, there has been a recent 
increase in the number of judges who are leaving 
the bench well before the mandatory retirement 
age of 75.  Individual circumstances of course 
vary, but the numbers taken together warrant 
consideration.  For example, of the 22 judges 
who retired or resigned in 2005 and 2006, 11 
of those judges – half of them – were age 60 
or younger.  Ten years ago, however, in 1995 
and 1996, there were only 11 resignations or 
retirements and, of those, only two were age 60 
or younger.

In other unmeasurable instances, it is the bell 
that did not ring. We simply do not know 
how many lawyers of the highest caliber and 
experience have decided against seeking election 
or appointment to our state’s bench. From 
the data, it is easy to infer that our missed 
opportunities are many.

Increasing judicial pay to an amount that is the 
average of the compensation for judges in the 
western United States, and then ensuring that 
pay keeps up with the cost of living, is the best 
means available to attract and then keep these 
dedicated public servants working on behalf of 
all Oregonians when the services they provide are 
most needed and most valuable.

Late U.S. Supreme 
Court  Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist 
(2003).

This pattern has not served anyone well, and 
Oregon deserves better.  The hard-working 
public officials in the judicial, legislative, and 
executive branches deserve better.  A more 
responsible method of adjusting compensation 
over time is both in order and long overdue.

The Judicial Department supports legislation 
that would establish a permanent mechanism 
for the regular salary review of public officials in 
all three branches of state government.  Under 
that legislative proposal, judges will receive 
an immediate parity pay adjustment, and at 
a later date, judges, legislators, and executive 
branch officials will begin receiving cost of living 
adjustments (COLAs).  The amount of future 
COLAs will be determined by a Quadrennial 
Commission on Executive, Legislative, and 
Judicial Compensation composed of qualified 
members of the general public appointed 
by representatives of the three governmental 
branches.  The commission and later 
commissions will determine salaries and prescribe 
appropriate adjustments for the four-year period 
following their deliberations.  The commission’s 
recommendations then will take effect unless the 
legislature elects to abrogate or modify them.  
Each commission will dissolve itself after issuing 
its report.

A failure to address meaningfully the issue of 
judicial compensation at the next legislative 
session would have the very real potential 
of demoralizing this vital, responsive, and 
innovative branch of government.  We owe it to 
ourselves – it is a matter of our own self-interest 
– to preserve and increase the competence and 
the efficiency of Oregon’s courts and, ultimately, 
the public’s respect for the courts’ impartial 
enforcement of the rule of law. 

solutions

The issue of inadequate pay is not unique to 
the Judicial branch of state government, and 
many of the same types of concerns exist with 
regard to the amount of compensation that we 
as Oregonians pay to officials in the Legislative 
and Executive branches.  The approach that the 
Judicial Department will recommend to the 
legislature next session will be two-phased.  The 
first, or short-term, phase will be a step toward 
remedying the existing inequity in judicial 
pay.  The second, permanent phase will provide 
a mechanism by which public officials in all 
branches of government can receive reasonable 
increases in their salaries over time, as free from 
political influence as is practicable. 

Short-Term 
On behalf of the people and the courts of this 
state, the Judicial Department will ask the 
Legislature for an immediate increase in the 
annual compensation paid to Oregon’s judges.  
Circuit court judges should have their pay 
adjusted to at least $125,000 annually, with 
Court of Appeals judges and Supreme Court 
justices receiving a comparable percentage 
adjustment.  That increase will do no more 
than bring Oregon judicial salaries toward the 
average judicial pay of our neighboring states 
(Washington, California, Idaho, and Nevada).   
A trial judge in Walla Walla, Washington 
currently earns $36,000 more a year than an 
Oregon judge fulfilling the same vital public role 
a mere 40 miles away in Pendleton.  

Long-Term 
It is clear as a matter of history that the judges 
of this state have endured long droughts in 
compensation.  Those droughts have forced the 
judicial branch, as it must again this session, 
to go before the legislature seeking the kind of 
unnecessarily large and politically unpopular 
catch-up pay increases that the late Chief 
Justice Rehnquist warned against.  Moreover, to 
the extent that judges have received increased 
compensation in the past, almost invariably 
those measures have been enacted at the end of 
the legislative session and without the kind of 
transparency that the public has every right to 
expect.

Judicial Officers

oregon needs to Create 
additional JudiCial positions

The demand for judicial services in Oregon has 
steadily outpaced the supply of judges available 
to meet that critical need.  In its November 2006 
report, the Joint Committee on Trial Court Judicial 
Resources, which is composed of 10 members 
appointed by the President of the Oregon State 
Bar and the Chief Justice, has recommended that 
the Legislative Assembly add 13 trial court judge 
positions across the state.  The judicial branch 
endorses the joint committee’s recommendations.  
With trial court dockets growing at a consistent 
pace for those case categories that require the 
greatest amount of attention by judges, and with 
only conservative additions to the system over the 
past decade, the need for these additional judicial 
resources is great.

the bases For the Joint 
Committee’s reCommendations

The joint committee, which has been issuing similar 
reports for over a decade, bases its recommendations 
on a number of considerations:

LEGISLATIVE AND CONGRESSIONAL 
ACTION: The committee has identified 11 specific 
items tied either to the Legislative Assembly or to 
Congress that have impacted the workload and 
functioning of the judicial branch.  For example, the 

federal Adoption and Safe Families Act – for which 
the Oregon legislature enacted implementation 
legislation in 1999 – sets a number of time limits 
for juvenile cases.  Meeting the resource-intensive 
requirements of that federal act is critical, because 
compliance is a prerequisite to Oregon’s continued 
eligibility to receive federal foster care funds.

AN UPDATED JUDICIAL WORKLOAD 
ASSESSMENT STUDY: In 2000, the Oregon trial 
court system received an objective judicial workload 
assessment from the National Center for State Courts 
showing which courts needed additional judge 
resources and by what percentage demand exceeded 
supply.  Using the model from that assessment, 
the Judicial Department has updated the analysis 
using 2005 actual case filings for each of Oregon’s 
27 judicial districts.  The data and results from this 
updated study provide the most valuable current, 
objective information to be used in determining 
where the need for additional judicial resources is 
most pressing.

INFORMATION OUTSIDE OF WORKLOAD 
ASSESSMENTS:  Although neutral data provide the 
best source for decision-making, it remains that other 
factors – factors that may be difficult to quantify 
– also seriously affect the functioning of individual 
courts.  Accordingly, the committee also took into 
account matters such as (1) availability of referees  
to assist the judges; (2) concentration of complex 
cases; (3) district attorney charging practices;  
(4) use of labor-intensive but tremendously effective 
drug and family courts; and (5) post-conviction and 
habeas corpus proceedings in districts in which state 
correctional facilities are located.

INCREASED JUDICIAL EFFICIENCY: In 
addition to the implementation of alternative 
dispute resolution mechanisms (including settlement 
conferences, mediation, and arbitration), trial courts 
have been utilizing technological advancements 
to improve the efficiency of their operations.  For 
example, the committee considered the greatly 
expanded use of both the computerized Uniform 
Criminal Judgment and closed-circuit video 
conferencing for proceedings involving incarcerated 
persons when making its judicial resource 
recommendations.

2

THE PASSAGE OF TIME: As a critical fifth 
component of its analysis, and although it declined 
to make any recommendations based upon future 
projections, the committee nevertheless recognized 
the significant lag between the decision to add a 
judge to a court and the time at which the new judge 
actually takes the bench.  For example, the Legislative 
Assembly created four new judicial positions during 
the 2005 session – with the benefit of filing data from 
2003 – that will be funded effective January 1, 2007.  
In other words, at best there has been a four-year span 
between the time that a need arises and when the 
need can be filled.

As with the need for increased judicial compensation, 
the need for an adequately staffed trial court bench 
should be first and foremost an issue of concern for 
the people of Oregon.  After all, Oregonians have 
the most to gain from a responsible and responsive  
judicial system, either directly as consumers of 
judicial services or indirectly as the beneficiaries of 
the increased public safety and economic activity that 
such a system provides.

The Condition of our Courthouses

On February 28, 2005, the Umatilla County Courthouse in Hermiston was completely destroyed by an arson fire. One year later, 
the circuit court moved into a new 25,000 square foot Umatilla County constructed building that it now shares with other county 
services. The Stafford Hansell Government Center is the first newly constructed building housing a circuit court in seven years.

the Challenge

As a few examples, consider the following:

For many of us in Oregon, the county courthouse 
is also the seat of the county’s government as well 
as a hub of civic activity.  Courthouses in our 
communities stand as constant reminders that ours 
is a nation that governs itself according to the rule of 
law.  And, just as Oregon’s capitol building reflects 
both the power and influence of the executive and 
legislative branches of state government, so too should 
Oregon’s courthouses reflect both the integrity and 
the accessibility of the judiciary.

Unfortunately, many of our facilities require 
substantial upgrade or repair.  Some, quite frankly, 
need to be replaced.  A recent survey to which 32 
of Oregon’s 36 counties responded indicates the 
following:

•  15 counties – nearly half of those responding – reported  
  “serious structural deficiencies” in their courthouses.   
  Although some identified problems with the buildings’  
structural supports or exteriors, a common thread  
 
running throughout was the need for seismic retrofitting.
 

•  12 counties – or about a third – reported problems of  
  “significant deferred maintenance,” including the need to  
  address heating, ventilation, and air conditioning  
  concerns.

•  13 counties indicated that upgrading courthouse  
 
 

facilities is a “high” priority for them in comparison to  
the completion of other county projects.

• The Multnomah County 
Courthouse, built in 1914,  
was designed to serve as the 
seat of government for  
250,000 residents.  The 
building originally housed 
17 courtrooms, the county 
commission, all county  
departments, law 
enforcement agencies, and  

File storage in the basement

Courthouse.

jail facilities.  Today the county offices have relocated,  

 
  and the building houses much of the Multnomah  
  County court system and other related offices serving  
  more than 660,000 residents.  As many as 5,000 people  
  pass through its lobby daily.  The courthouse, however, is  
  crowded, uncomfortable, and dangerous due to various  
  fire and safety issues as well as mechanical and electrical  
  problems. Perhaps most worrisome is the near certainty  
  of a catastrophic collapse in the event of a significant  
  earthquake.

•  Due to its inadequate size, the Coos County Courthouse  
in Coquille can house only three of its four judges – the  
 
 
fourth is assigned to a satellite courtroom in North  
  Bend that can accommodate only certain kinds of cases.   
  The expansion of essential services has forced other  
  crucial operations into badly designed and inadequate  
 
space.  For example, there presently is no room in the  
  courthouse to house the records that the court needs  
 
to retain and use on a daily basis.  Moreover, due to the  
  condition of the water pipes, the county has removed all  
  water fountains from the courthouse.  Finally, the  
  condition of the electrical system requires clerks to be  

30

In Oregon, no measurable guidelines establish what 
features court facilities must possess.  Under current 
law, Oregon’s counties own the court facilities 
and provide them to the state’s judicial branch at 
the counties’ expense.  Aside from county general 
funds, there is no source of funds available for the 
improvement of court facilities.  And, due to reduced 
income several years ago and other claims on county 
budgets, few counties have been able to address 
serious court facilities problems in recent years.

The status quo no longer is an option, and the task 
force has been exploring the potential for innovative 
solutions – solutions that involve examining the 
ownership structure for new and certain existing 
facilities; developing new financing alternatives for 
renovations, maintenance, and new construction; and 
providing a mechanism to ensure that future issues 
can be resolved efficiently and effectively, and to the 
mutual benefit of all the courthouses’ shared users.

To begin to address these issues, the task force is 
recommending that the Legislative Assembly in 
2007 create a source of new revenue to be used to 
finance capital outlays for court construction and 
remodeling.  These new revenues would be collected 
beginning in the 2007-09 biennium.  Next, the task 
force urges that a State Court Facilities Commission 
be established consisting of representatives from 
the Governor’s office, the Legislative Assembly, 
Oregon’s counties, the courts, and the Oregon State 
Bar.  The Commission would establish standards, 
create a methodology for prioritizing court facility 
projects, and issue a report to the 2009 legislature.  
The Legislative Assembly then would provide for the 
allocation of the funds collected during 2007-09 to 
specific projects, either through the Commission or 
otherwise. 

  careful not to use certain pieces of equipment at the same  
time to avoid blowing circuits, and the heating system  
 
fails at least twice a winter.
 

• Due to safety issues 
with the Union County 
Courthouse in La Grande 
in 1989 – the building 
later was condemned – the 
courts were moved first 
into basement facilities 
underneath the county jail 
and later, in 1991, into an 
old hospital facility.  The 
courts have been there ever 
since.  There is only one 
toilet available to women.  
Staff must walk through the  
courtroom to access the  
  accounting department.  The public has no access to  
  both the records and accounting departments without  
  walking outside the building. Finally, concrete pillars in  
  what are now the courtrooms obstruct the views of  
judges, jurors, and lawyers, which creates significant  
 
safety and legal issues.

courtrooms. There is a

counsel table.

The ability of all citizens to freely access and safely 
use those buildings to conduct their public affairs and 
the well-being of the public servants – whether they 
be county or state – who spend their professional 
lives in those facilities depends on the development 
of innovative solutions to what has become a chronic 
problem.

the solution: one size does not 
Fit all

A task force composed of members from the 
judicial branch, representatives from the Association 
of Oregon Counties and the Oregon State Bar, 
legislators, and others has been assessing data about 
the condition of our county courthouses. 

For now, this much has become clear through the task 
force’s preliminary efforts:

Each county courthouse has individual needs and is 
put to individualized uses; therefore, each will need 
particularized consideration and treatment.  In other 
words, a universal, or one-size-fits-all, approach 
cannot work under these circumstances.

Snapshots: Judicial Initiatives District-by-District

Over the past several years, the Lane County Circuit Court 
has been involved in a joint project with the Lane County 
Sheriff and the county office of Probation and Parole / Post-
Prison Supervision to design and implement the Defendant 
/ Offender Management Center (DOMC).  The program 
is referred to as the Sherman Center in memory of Richard 
Sherman, who was the Lane County Sheriff’s Director of 
Mental Health Services.  The broad-based effort has two 
essential components.  First, the project ensures that every 
defendant released pretrial has an appropriate conditional 
release agreement based on validated risk assessment tools.  
Second, the project provides for the active management of 
offenders in county custody as they move from jail to jail 
alternatives and provides for the imposition of immediate 
sanctions for violations.  The DOMC initiative has become 
the center point for enhancing community safety by 
focusing the management of offenders on the risks of re-
offending, dangerousness to the community, and the failure 
to appear.

assure the maximum flow of information to the public, 
an information tent was set up in front of the building,

were updated regularly.  The building was rededicated on 
September 4, 2006.  Its infrastructure had been upgraded to 
support the latest technology and most efficient utilization.

leveraged their resources 
to purchase an Internet-

technology system.  The court began using the system to

already is benefiting from improved courtroom security and 
substantial savings due to reduced inmate transportation

will support courtroom multimedia presentations, digital 
audio and video evidence, and remote expert witness

Using the authorization of a new circuit court judge 
position together with a grant from the Criminal Justice 
Commission, the circuit court opened Jackson County’s 
Adult Drug Court in March 2006.  The program currently 
provides services to more than 80 high-risk addicted

program is successfully diverting criminal addicts from 
expensive incarceration to evidence-based treatments.

Using a 2005 STOP 
Violence Against Women 
Act Formula Program 
Grant, the Multnomah 
County Circuit Court 
opened the Judge Stephen 
B. Herrell Domestic 
Violence Reduction 

Program (DVRP) in 2006.  The purpose of DVRP is to 
create a court that manages domestic violence cases in a 
single venue, which permits judges to maintain tight case 
controls and impose uniform sanctions on conviction that 
address both the behavioral and public safety concerns 
around these offenders.

To better manage complex multimillion dollar commercial 
and residential construction defect cases, the Multnomah 
County Circuit Court adopted a system under which 
parties may choose one of two tracks: (1) the normal 12-
month trial system; or (2) a new referee system.  If the 
parties choose the normal system, then they will not be 
granted trial extensions beyond the 12-month period absent 
extenuating circumstances.  Under the referee system, 
however, the parties pay the referee’s fees, and the referee 
has the authority to hear and decide motions to join parties 
and to extend the trial date to 18 months from initial filing 
on motion of a party and a showing of good cause.

Wraparound Oregon is an initiative in Multnomah County, 
which the Presiding Judge and Chief Family Court Judge 
manage, to build an integrated system of community-based 
supports to help children, youth, and families who need 
the most intensive and costly care from multiple agencies.  
The program will create integrated services and resources 
for children who are involved in multiple systems; provide 
families with an opportunity to “drive” decision-making; 
keep children in their own homes, in their own schools, and 
out of trouble; and improve educational and mental health 
outcomes.

With funds provided 
by a federal grant, the 
Clackamas County Circuit 
Court started a Driving 
Under the Influence 
of Intoxicants (DUII) 
Court in 2006.  To date, 
13 offenders that pose 
significant risk to the community due to their multiple 
convictions for DUII have entered the 18-month program.  
Because the grant was for start-up costs only, permanent 
funding is needed to continue and expand the number of 
participants.

In collaboration with the Clackamas County District 
Attorney, the circuit court implemented a community 
court in early 2005 that is paying off dividends in solving 
neighborhood crime in the Overland Park area.  In 
exchange for a guilty plea, the court imposes community 
service in the Overland Park community rather than fines 
or incarceration.  The recidivism rate in the program is 
extremely low.  Between October 2005 and June 2006, only 
1 out of 147 participants re-offended.

After completing a successful pilot program, the court and 
the Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office fully implemented 
an electronic system for issuing and processing traffic 
citations.  The system provides data entry efficiencies to 
both the court and law enforcement.  The Sheriff’s Office

For a number of years, 
court records in the Polk 
County Circuit Court 
were archived and stored 
in a cell block of an old jail 
building.  The situation 
presented a security 
problem for court records 

and safety issues for court staff.  Using court security 
funding, the court worked with Polk County to have the 
cell block renovated into a proper and secure file room.  
Security in other areas of the court has been improved with 
the installation of bullet resistant glass and door keypads.

In July 2005, the Polk County Circuit Court started an 
adult drug court.  The Mental Health Department was 
able to hire a part-time mental health counselor to perform 
the treatment portion of the program without any grant 
funding.  Two participants have graduated from the 
program, and a number of others have reached the third 
phase of the three-phase program.  In October 2006, Polk 
County received notice that it will be receiving a $25,000 
grant from the Grand Ronde Tribe for use in its drug court 
program.

Following a federally 
sponsored drug court 
implementation training in 
2005, the Klamath County 
Circuit Court is starting its 
first juvenile drug court.  It 
will be joining the county’s 
Integrated Treatment 

Court, which already includes an adult drug court, family 
court, and family facilitation program.  Because these 
programs all represent efforts to deal with participants in 
more effective and sometimes nontraditional ways, they 
were consolidated into one integrated system.

The Klamath County Circuit Court has been working 
with local schools, the county juvenile department, and 
law enforcement to create an Expulsion Diversion Program 
designed to moderate the current zero tolerance policies in 
schools.  Through the program, students caught committing 
a crime may be allowed to stay in school under the close 
supervision of the court and the Juvenile Department.

In a major collaboration with the Klamath Tribes, the 
circuit court has been exploring ways to deliver more 
effective and culturally appropriate services to Native-
American youth who come before the court.  This 
population is substantially over-represented in alcohol 
and drug treatment programs, and the circuit court’s 
authority is not always recognized.  Conversely, the newly 
formed Klamath Tribal Courts lack resources in areas of 
enforcement and sanction capability.  The court is meeting 
regularly with the Klamath Tribes to explore ways to share 
resources and reach this population of youth.  

The Klamath County Circuit Court continues to prepare 
for the Klamath Basin Adjudication cases, expected in late 
2008, by doing the groundwork to move to an electronic 
filing and content management program.  The program will 
allow more efficient handling of this mega-litigation.

The Josephine County 
Circuit Court has 
organized a peer 
group composed of 
nonmanagement employees 
that meet on a monthly 
basis to discuss a wide 
range of topics and present 
feedback to management.  The group has been responsible 
for creating a mentor/mentee program for new employees, 
administering an employee satisfaction survey, and setting 
up a training room/resource center.

Court security is an integral part of court operations in 
Josephine County.  In 2006, the local Court Security 
Committee conducted three independent risk assessments, 
developed an emergency evacuation plan, conducted an 
interagency security training, collected security equipment 
donations, and initiated a long-term funding strategy to 
address courthouse security enhancements.  It also planned 
and implemented “Operation Clean Sweep,” during which 
an entire day was dedicated to removing all weapons of 
opportunity from the court and any items that might pose a 
safety or security threat.

The Clatsop County

program will provide 
a developmentally and 

culturally appropriate continuum of services that will 
build on family strengths while holding youth offenders 
accountable.  A graduation ceremony will be held upon 
successful completion of the 12-month program.

With the assistance of a college student, the Clatsop 
County Circuit Court developed a user-friendly website 
and expanded information for pro se litigants.

In 2006, Clatsop County and the circuit court took a lead 
role in organizing and producing a county-wide Meth 
Summit.  More than 400 people attended the event to 
develop an action plan to fight methamphetamine use.  
Several of these projects already are underway, including 
development of a family drug court.

The Coos County Circuit Court upgraded one of its 
courtrooms with a video-arraignment / video-conferencing 
system.  Among other things, the system allows attorneys 
to make PowerPoint presentations, video presentations, and 
evidence presentations from laptops at the attorney tables.

The Curry County Circuit Court led a cooperative effort to 
complete a security remodel of a courtroom.  The project 
required demolition of the courtroom and was completed 
in 30 days and within budget.

In 2006, the Benton 
County Circuit Court, 
in consultation with its 
Mediation-Arbitration 
Commission, launched 
a domestic relations 
mediator assessment 
project.  Mediators 

associated with the program for fewer than five years are 
participating in co-mediations with a successful, veteran 
mediator for the purpose of identifying skill strengths 
and challenges.  These assessments represent ongoing skill 
building opportunities for the mediators while also offering 
assurance to the community about the quality of mediation 
services provided in domestic relations cases.

Also in 2006, the court volunteered to participate in a 
pilot centralized verification project.  Each day, court staff 
electronically submit applications for court-appointed 
counsel to the Office of the State Court Administrator in 
Salem where financial eligibility for appointed counsel is 
verified and reported back within 24 hours.

In collaboration with the Benton County Sheriff’s Office, 
the court applied for and received a grant through the 
Criminal Justice Commission to expand its existing adult 
drug court program.  This successful application now funds 
a mental health professional, a data entry clerk, child care 
services, and staff training for program participants.

The Columbia County

set-overs and has discontinued its use of multiple “status” 
appearances in favor of a court call system.

In October 2006, the 
Yamhill County Circuit

drug court to its existing 
adult drug court and 
mental health court.  In 
the past year, these three 
programs have funneled 66 

defendants into treatment.  Eighteen criminal cases were 
dismissed following successful completion of the programs, 
and three babies were born to drug-free mothers.

In conjunction with the Model Juvenile Court Project, 
Yamhill County Circuit Court partnered with other 
juvenile dependency participants to form the Juvenile 
Dependency Excellency Council.  The council has seen 
renewed enthusiasm in the past year.  The addition of 
members from the defense bar has resulted in more efficient 
resolution of issues and increased attorney participation in 
dependency cases.

As part of the Criminal Model Court Pilot Project, the 
Yamhill County Circuit Court partnered with other 
public safety stakeholders to improve local criminal case 
processing.  A set of written best practices was developed, 
as well as a policy for improving trial date certainty by 
requiring all requests for continuances to go through the 
presiding judge.  The court also worked with the Public 
Defense Services Commission to compensate consortium 
attorneys for appearing at arraignment, which has resulted 
in some cases being resolved much earlier in the process.

which would free up space within the existing courthouse.  
The county made an offer that was accepted and will hold
