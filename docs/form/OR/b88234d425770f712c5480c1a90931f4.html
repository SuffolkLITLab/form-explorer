STRUCTURE 

The founding statute, ORS 3.436, includes this language: 
(1) The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may appoint a statewide family law advisory

committee to assist the State Court Administrator in carrying out the administrator's
responsibilities under ORS 3.438 (2) and (4)(a) and in identifying family law issues that need
to be addressed in the future. The Chief Justice shall consider the diversity of this state in
appointing the members of the statewide advisory committee.

The purview of SFLAC is within the discretion of the Chief Justice, who appoints members to 
staggered 3-year terms, renewable indefinitely, in her or his discretion. There are usually 
approximately 15–18 members representing diverse vantage points on family law and the 
Oregon Judicial Department. Members represent a diversity of professions (judiciary, law 

Statewide Family Law Advisory Committee Annual Report – Spring 2021 

Page 2 

practice, court administration, child support, mediation, mental health, and others).  There is 
conscious diversity of geography, gender and ethnicity.  To date, the Chair has been a judicial 
officer.  There is no judicial majority by design and recommendation of the group itself.  The 
SFLAC and its subcommittees are committed to supporting successful family law policies, 
reforms and programs that serve all individuals and families who access Oregon’s courts.  We 
believe we can do so only with a diverse membership which actively cultivates a culture of 
equity and inclusion.  Thus, we are committed to seeking out and strongly encouraging 
applicants to apply who are Black, Indigenous, Latinx and persons of color; LGBTQIA2+ 
individuals; veterans; persons with disabilities; and persons from other traditionally 
underrepresented communities.     

All meetings are subject to Oregon’s public meeting laws.  SFLAC publishes its agendas in 
advance, maintains a public website, assures access to all venues, and provides opportunity for 
public comment.  SFLAC members and guests may call in to meetings, and video access is 
provided.  When meetings are held in person, members may request reimbursement for travel 
expenses if funds are available, but members receive no compensation for service.   

Service on SFLAC requires a substantial time commitment.  Meetings are quarterly (typically 
March, June, September and December), usually on Fridays, and last up to four hours.  When 
meetings were held in person, they were generally in Portland at the Oregon Department of 
Justice building, with one meeting a year in another part of the state.  Members are actively 
involved and generally serve on one or more subcommittees.  Service on the subcommittees 
requires interim meetings and preparation for the quarterly SFLAC meetings. Subcommittees 
and work groups are formed and reformed as needed.  It is not necessary to be an SFLAC 
member to serve on a subcommittee; in fact, the SFLAC benefits when the subcommittees pull 
from a broader pool of members for insight and contributions.  Many SFLAC members have 
contributed prior service on a subcommittee, and we have started asking applicants interested in 
serving on the SFLAC to get involved with one of our subcommittees first. 

The members have an excellent attendance rate at the meetings, which is critical because each 
member has been specifically chosen to participate in the group based on their unique knowledge 
and skills set.  The meetings are comprehensive and allow for an exchange of information and 
sharing of goals for family law in the State of Oregon.  There is equality of individual respect not 
arbitrarily hindered by hierarchy, titles, length of service, or deference to rank.  There is an 
atmosphere of businesslike informality, humor, and collegiality.  There is often outspoken but 
respectful frankness in pursuit of consensus, which is almost always reached but not required.  
This refreshing dynamic allows the group to tackle tough issues with fervor and strive to have 
Oregon be a leader in prioritizing service to families involved with the litigation process.  

At least annually, the Chief Justice and the State Court Administrator meet with SFLAC to 
discuss issues and policies under the purview of the committee.  SFLAC remains advisory to the 
Chief and SCA. Additionally, each member serves as liaison to one or more local Family Law 
Advisory Committees (FLAC) and reports on the activities of the local FLACs. [All Presiding 
Judges are required to constitute a FLAC to address policy on family law issues in their county, 
though some counties remain dormant.]

THE WORK OF 2020 

In addition to the specific work outlined by the subcommittees below, the Covid-19 pandemic 
brought many opportunities for important work by the SFLAC and its subcommittees.  Each 
subcommittee has shared information about this work below, but the SFLAC also worked on two 
important projects related to the pandemic.  First, shortly after Governor Brown restricted travel 
and gatherings in Oregon, many parents and their attorneys were unsure whether and how the 
new restrictions would affect parenting time.  The SFLAC promptly drafted, discussed, edited, 
and eventually approved guidelines for parents sharing custody or parenting time during the 
pandemic:   
Oregon Statewide Family Law Advisory Committee (SFLAC) Recommendations for Oregon 
Courts: Information for Parents sharing Custody or Parenting Time of Children During the 
COVID-19 Pandemic.  This resource was widely distributed, and we have received significant 
positive feedback and indications that this guidance considerably reduced litigation during the 
early months of the pandemic and continuing through the present as statewide restrictions 
continue to present challenges to families.   

The second project the SFLAC worked on together involved many rounds of feedback provided 
pursuant to Chief Justice Walter’s request for input on providing remote services during the 
pandemic.  Each subcommittee reviewed these recommendations, and many provided substantial 
feedback.  The SFLAC compiled the input in a single 20+ page report (with an additional 30+ 
pages of exhibits including direct input from some subcommittees).  This comprehensive 
document was shared with the presiding judges throughout the state to evaluate which of the 
recommendations would be appropriate and feasible in their jurisdictions.  

In addition to the Covid-specific work, many members of the SFLAC are called upon in their 
various capacities to provide independent insight regarding family law policies to both to the 
Courts and legislature.  It is fairly common to see SFLAC members providing testimony or 
informational interviews to state legislators or committees involved in specific family law bills. 
While these presentations at the Capitol are not within the charge and purview of the work of the 
SFLAC, it is an additional way that the members are staying involved in local and state efforts to 
shape and inform family law policies.  

SUBCOMMITTEE SUMMARIES 

Several subcommittees of the SFLAC undertake the bulk of the SFLAC work.  These 
subcommittees will constitute, expand, decrease, and go dormant from time to time depending on 
the needs of the group.  After careful consideration regarding priorities moving forward, in 2016 
the SFLAC agreed to absorb the mission of the Self-Represented Subcommittee into the work of 
each and every subcommittee. The currently active subcommittees are listed below with a 
summary statement regarding recent achievements.  

With the pressing and unique shift occurring in the courts as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, 
SFLAC’s subcommittees have kept at the forefront of their work the innovations that have 
already occurred and are striving to define the “new normal” that will likely shape up in the 

Statewide Family Law Advisory Committee Annual Report – Spring 2021 

Page 4 

coming years.  Each subcommittee has made specific Covid-19 recommendations for the Oregon 
Courts and will endeavor to capitalize on the momentum of positive changes in the courts to 
better serve Oregon families.  

PARENTING INVOLVEMENT AND OUTREACH COMMITTEE – Spring Report 2021 

Chairs:  Dr. Adam Furchner, Ph.D. and The Hon. Amy Holmes Hehn (Multnomah County 
Circuit Court) 

Members:  Hon. Sean Armstrong (Marion County Circuit Court), Hon. Bethany Flint 
(Deschutes County Circuit Court), Hon. Dawn McIntosh (Clatsop County Circuit Court), Scott 
Leibenguth (Attorney, Portland), Jane Parisi Mosher (Mediator, Yamhill), Linda Scher 
(Mediator, Multnomah), Robin Stedfeld (Mediator, Union), Judith Swinney (Parenting 
Supervisor/Education, Portland), Tracey Vogeltanz (Multnomah County Family Court), Dr. 
Wendy Bourg, Ph.D. (Psychologist, Portland), Kathleen Zumpano (Child Specialist, Portland), 
Vicki Bruno (Mediator, Portland), Brenna Moore (Attorney-Mediator, Umatilla County) 

Staff: Amy Benedum (JFCPD, OJD)

What is the goal/focus of the subcommittee? 

Provides information and training to parents, mediators, and the legal community regarding 
parenting time, legal decision making and family law related topics. 

What are the subcommittee’s top short-term priorities? 

Developing materials for professionals and the public related to family situations where the 
child is refusing or resisting parenting time.  This includes considerable research into the 
existing academic articles on the topic.  There is a diverse group of experts in the subcommittee 
who eagerly share their research materials as well as practical and anecdotal approaches to 
serving children and families.  There has been a deep dive into the literature and lengthy 
discussions about how to move forward with this topic.  This topic is pressing nationwide 
currently and is of interest to most of us who work closely with family courts.    

 What are the subcommittee’s top long-term priorities? 

We expect that our current project may have many stages and a series of products.  We hope to 
offer information through written materials, video releases, and presentations. As mentioned 
above, this particular dynamic of resist/refuse is complicated and is ripe for education and 
ultimately intervention by the Courts. It will require thorough education and foundation for our 
continued efforts to provide recommendations to the SFLAC and Chief.  

What are the subcommittee’s top accomplishments? 

The Parenting Involvement Workgroup (later renamed The Parenting Involvement and Outreach 
Subcommittee or PIOS) was formed in 2010 to investigate local and national trends regarding 
best interest standards and practices for children of divorce, paying particular attention to the 

Statewide Family Law Advisory Committee Annual Report – Spring 2021 

Page 5 

distinction between parenting schedules (referred to throughout as “parenting time”) and 
custody, referring to legal decision-making authority as defined by ORS 107.169. 

Since that time, the subcommittee has complete several major projects as well as a wealth of 
more minor materials.  An incomplete list of work is detailed below: 

2020 – Third Party Supervisors/Supervised Parenting Time.  Materials including tools and 
instructions for litigants and third-party supervisors as well as sample court orders for judges 
related to third-party supervised parenting time.  

2015–2019 – Birth Through Three Toolkit and associated presentations, materials, and trainings 
around the state.  

2011 – Parenting Education: What Works Best?  

2010 – Custody and Parenting Time: Summary of Current Information and Research 

2010 - Qualifications for Appointment and Training of Parenting Coordinators, Custody 
Evaluators, and Parenting Time Supervisors  

What are the challenges for courts in implementing the recommendations from the 
subcommittee? 

The greatest challenges for the courts and involved professionals in almost all of the issues we 
address occur for non-represented litigants and low-income families. We are trying to redouble 
our efforts to provide recommendations for the courts that acknowledge income disparities and 
the lack of resources that confront many families. 

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE – Spring Report 2021 

Chair:  Debra Dority (Oregon Law Center)  

Members: Amy Benedum (JFCPD OJD), Cheryl O’Neill (DHS, Child Safety Unit), Diana 
Fleming (CVSSD, DOJ), Dr. Sheldon Levy (OHSU Dept. of Family Medicine), Samantha

Jackson County) *Hon. Maureen McKnight (Sr. Judge, Multnomah County Circuit Court) as 
interested party/retired.

Staff: Amy Benedum (JFCPD, OJD) 

What is the goal/focus of the subcommittee?  
To advise the Chief Justice regarding issues, legislation, and resources relating to domestic 
violence, and provide resources for the same.  

Statewide Family Law Advisory Committee Annual Report – Spring 2021 

Page 6 

What are the subcommittee’s top short-term priorities? 
The subcommittee is in the process of finalizing the “Stalking Bench Book,” a resource for 
judges that is similar to the existing FAPA and EPPDAPA Bench Books.  As we created the 
Stalking Bench Book from scratch, it was the primary focus of 2019 and 2020.  The 
subcommittee has begun work on the “Firearms Bench Sheets,” designed to be quick reference 
tools for Judges for firearm prohibition and dispossession protocols in both civil and criminal 
proceedings.  We plan to coordinate with the SFLAC Data Subcommittee on future efforts to 
simplify the dispossession process.   

What are the subcommittee’s top long-term priorities? 
In addition to finalizing the Stalking Bench Book and Firearms Bench Sheets, our long-term 
priorities include updating the FAPA and EPPDAPA Bench Books.  The subcommittee also 
plans to conduct additional research on best practices and develop resources to assist Oregon 
courts as they move toward becoming a more trauma-informed system. 

Generally, the subcommittee will continue to do the following: 
• Propose updates and changes to court forms, materials, and resources regarding domestic

violence (including developing updates to the FAPA Bench Book and the EPPDAPA Bench
Book, and the Stalking Bench Book when necessary).

• Support education of the bench and bar related to domestic violence, sexual assault, and

stalking.

• Propose and provide speakers for the SFLAC Conference on domestic violence, working

with trauma survivors, and firearms.

• Support the implementation of the firearm dispossession protocols (per 2019’s HB 2013),

including providing training and resources.

• Advise the Chief Justice on issues relating to domestic violence.

Finally, the DV Subcommittee supports and hopes to participate in the reactivation of a firearms 
taskforce to help with the implementation of recent firearms protections related to domestic 
violence. 

What are the subcommittee’s top accomplishments? 
The development of Stalking Bench Book is our most recent significant accomplishment.  The 
feedback from those judges who have reviewed the latest draft has been overwhelmingly 
positive.   

The DV Subcommittee, at the request of Chief Justice Walters, provided a number of 
recommendations regarding the use of remote hearings and provision of other remote services 
during the Covid-19 pandemic.  These included important input on how courts could best 
continue to provide timely access to protective order proceedings, and other family law-specific 
services, in a manner that remained trauma informed.  These recommendations were provided 
both as part of the full SFLAC Report and in whole as an attachment to the SFLAC Report to 
Chief Justice Walters. 

Statewide Family Law Advisory Committee Annual Report – Spring 2021 

Page 7 

What are the challenges for courts in implementing the recommendations from the 
subcommittee? 

There were many obstacles discussed in the recommendations on remote services provided to the 
Chief Justice, as well as some proposed solutions. Once Oregon (and the Courts) are “fully 
open” after the pandemic, it is expected that many survivors of domestic violence who were 
previously unable to access services will finally be able to do so.  The need for restraining orders 
and family law matters is likely to increase at that time.  The input of the DV Subcommittee on 
remote services included recommendations that many remote services continue even after the 
pandemic to ensure as much access as possible.  There may be some challenges for the courts to 
continue and improve such services and, unfortunately, the increase in need at that time may be 
more than OJD has resources to handle.    

As stated above, the DV Subcommittee remains motivated to support the implementation of the 
firearm dispossession protocols.  Because such implementation will require cooperation by a 
number of stakeholders, significant time investment, and potentially financial support, the 
implementation has been difficult.  These new protocols will likely require tracking by OJD and 
DOJ (for enforcement via contempt) of the timing of qualifying protection orders and qualifying 
misdemeanor crimes, and whether respondents/defendants filed the mandatory dispossession 
declarations (which are often not getting filed).  Such tracking may require an examination of 
limitations of Odyssey and communication between OJD and DOJ.   

Chapter 125 Subcommittee 

It was decided at the outset of 2021 that this particular subcommittee is doing significant and 
substantive work in the arena of guardianships and conservatorships together with community 
partners like WINGS.  This subcommittee had an independent and direct line to the Chief Justice 
and SCA as the Covid pandemic CJOs were being crafted.  This group is active and led by Judge 
Holland and Judge Cobb.  This subcommittee will no longer be under the umbrella of the 
SFLAC as this area of law is uniquely different from much of the current SFLAC work.

Statewide Family Law Advisory Committee Annual Report – Spring 2021 

Page 8 

Staff: Amy Benedum (JFCPD, OJD)

What is the goal/focus of the subcommittee?  
The SFLAC Mediation Subcommittee was created: 

• To ensure that all family law litigants have access to court-connected mediation services in

cases involving minor children in which custody or parenting time is in dispute;

• To make recommendations to ensure adequate funding for mediation services;
• To make recommendations regarding mediator resources including best practices, trainings,

and support.

What are the subcommittee’s top short-term priorities? 
• Survey counties to identify programs, core services, and other funding available in local

communities to help identify key accomplishments, concerns, and unmet needs of county
programs.  Create a comprehensive list of court-connected domestic relations mediators from
this survey.

• Review quarterly data.  Interpret the data to develop statewide recommended best practices.
• Make recommendations for mediator training opportunities through OSCA.
• Review court-connected mediator minimum training requirements and, if appropriate, make
recommendations for updated training requirements through an equity and inclusion lens.

• Stay current in domestic relations mediation best practices and encourage innovative

services.

What are the subcommittee’s top long-term priorities? 
The subcommittee’s top long-term priority is making recommendations to ensure sufficient 
funding so high-quality domestic relations mediation is available statewide to all eligible litigants 
regardless of their ability to pay.  

What are the subcommittee’s top accomplishments? 
• Assisted OJD in two separate data collection projects aimed at establishing a baseline of

mediation services available statewide.

• Commissioned two white papers on the state of mediation in Oregon and mediation best

practices.

• Supported OJD in crafting policy option packages to increase mediation funding (both were

included in the Chief’s budget, but not funded by the legislature).

• Designed new Mediation Data Collection Project, a process for reporting and tracking the
outcome of court-connected domestic relations mediation; drafted instruction letter on
completing the mediator reports for mediators and court staff; drafted a review letter after a
year of data collection highlighted needed clarifications and improvements.

• Continued outreach to court-connected mediators and programs throughout the state.
• Continued discussion of best practices in mediation.

Statewide Family Law Advisory Committee Annual Report – Spring 2021 

Page 9 

What are the challenges for courts in implementing the recommendations from the 
subcommittee? 
• The largest challenge for courts in implementing the recommendations from the mediation
subcommittee is the existing limited statewide funding for mediation.  The proposed
mediation/conciliation Current Service Level and Chief Justice’s Recommended Budget
amount for the 2021-2023 biennium is lower than the 2007-2009 biennium funding levels.

• Lack of uniformity on reporting information.
• Lack of clearly identified resources providing the court-connected mediation.
• Lack of recruitment for court-qualified mediators.

• Develop education materials through videos and trainings for both litigants and facilitators
regarding use of technology such as Webex for providing facilitation services by remote
means.

What are the subcommittee’s top long-term priorities? 
• Create and maintain an online training manual for facilitators on the OJD SharePoint site
• Continue to plan and oversee the Family Law Conference and Family Law Facilitator

Training, in alternating years.

What are the subcommittee’s top accomplishments? 

Statewide Family Law Advisory Committee Annual Report – Spring 2021 

Page 10 

• The recent overhaul of the trial preparation pamphlet, “Divorce and Custody Trials in

Oregon.”  The revised version includes an updated look with fresh graphics and incorporates
changes in laws and procedures plus information about new programs such as IDRT.  The
pamphlet was also restructured to pull out specific issues in order to provide comprehensive
information in a more organized format in appendix form.  The pamphlet is available in
English and Spanish.

• The subcommittee provided valuable input for the SFLAC’s report to the Chief Justice

regarding Remote Appearances.

• After the in-person Facilitator Training planned for April 2020 was cancelled due to Covid-
19, the subcommittee seamlessly coordinated monthly remote presentations and training
opportunities for Family Law Facilitators.  The monthly sessions incorporate not only the
topics planned for the April 2020 training, but also address topics that are relevant to the
current time, including information about remote delivery of facilitation services.  These
sessions are recorded and posted to the shared Family Law Facilitator site on SharePoint.

What are the challenges for courts in implementing the recommendations from the 
subcommittee?   
• Continuing to bridge the divide with the technology side of OSCA.
• The financial and technology resources to produce educational materials such as videos, and

coordinate conferences and trainings.

• The notable difference in the operating needs and procedures between judicial districts in

Oregon can make statewide education a challenge.

FUTURES SUBCOMMITTEE – Spring Report 2021 

Chairs:  Ryan Carty (Salem Attorney) Beginning Jan 2021, William Howe (Former Vice Chair 
term ended Dec 2020)  

Current Members:  Stephen Adams (Retired Attorney Mediator, Wallowa County), Hon. Sean 
Armstrong (Marion County Circuit Court), Colleen Carter Cox (Family Court Facilitator Lane 
County  OJD), Valerie Colas (Staff Attorney OJD OSCA), Christine Hill (Multnomah County 
OJD), Linda Hukari (Trial Court Administer, Marion County), William Howe (Attorney, 
Portland), John Grant (Attorney, Portland), Eric McClendon (OSB), Samantha Malloy 
(Attorney, Jackson County) Hon. Karrie McIntyre (Lane County Circuit Court), Shawn Menashe 
(Attorney, Portland), Hon. Maureen McKnight (Sr. Judge Multnomah County Circuit Court), 
Hon. Daniel Murphy (Sr. Judge Linn County Circuit Court), Nanci Thaemert (JFCPD, OJD) 

Staff: Bryan Marsh (JFCPD, OJD) 

What is the goal/focus of the subcommittee? 
The Futures Subcommittee remains committed to its vision to reimagine “Court” as a service and 
process rather than a specific place where trials and hearings occur. By so doing, we strive to 
imagine and assist to implement avenues for more and better legal services. Specific focuses 
include: 

Statewide Family Law Advisory Committee Annual Report – Spring 2021 

Page 11 

• Optimizing existing court personnel and resources: This commitment includes the

transition from an assumption of resolution through trials/hearings to one that utilizes the
wealth of experienced judges, excellent court personnel and underutilized prior innovations.

• Placing a focus on early and frequent intervention in legal disputes: This focus is

designed to encourage swifter case conclusion that avoids the long-term collateral damage of
protracted court proceedings.

• Embracing ideas, innovations, and lessons learned throughout the Covod-19 pandemic:
Recent changes to our courts and the way we interface with end-users have the capacity to
both redefine and improve our legal system to better serve the majority of self-represented
Oregonians.

• Continuing examination and innovation of established rules and procedures: This focus
ensures we are informing future projects with an eye on what is in place today and areas
where things are operating smoothly versus areas where we can better meet and address the
changing dynamics faced by today’s families and typical court customers.

What are the subcommittee’s top short-term priorities? 
• Remote Access Initiative. Unfortunately, and ironically, the launch of the Remote Access

Initiative was delayed in some counties by the pandemic. Other counties have fully embraced
remote facilitation. Ongoing efforts include the transition to a statewide Voice Over Internet
Protocol (VoIP) by the OJD Enterprise Technology Division that will ensure a consistent and
uniform phone system/number for utilization in remote facilitation. The improved
participation rate reported by some counties is a testament to the success this program can
deliver to courts (e.g., Lane County reduced its “no show” rate from 14.65% in 2019 to 6.2%
in 2020).

• Remote Proceedings. The Futures Subcommittee is continuing to gather data and propose

solutions to refine and enhance remote hearings and trials in an effort to improve the process.
This focus includes solutions to the current pandemic-driven processes and proposals for how
to ensure that post-pandemic courts are best able to reduce barriers to individuals who have
historically had difficulty engaging in the process due to childcare, transportation,
employment and other complications.

What are the subcommittee’s top long-term priorities? 
• Continue efforts to facilitate remote access to courts in appropriate areas that expand beyond

facilitation services.

• Promote systems that support access to justice (e.g., create new rule for filing fee waivers and
deferrals electronically, pilot program for allowing litigants to self-schedule court appearances
such as status conferences, etc.).
Identify case type specific triage that will target and streamline processes to provide early and
frequent interventions that will help resolve cases without resorting to drawn-out litigation
that ends in trials and hearings. Examples include case conferences, judicial settlement
conferences, interim relief through written submissions, etc.

What are the subcommittee’s top accomplishments? 
• Remote Access Initiative: While the Remote Access Initiative has been delayed due to the

Covid-19 pandemic, the groundwork laid by the Futures Subcommittee and partnering courts
provided a means for some courts to quickly and efficiently transition to remote facilitation at
the onset of the pandemic. Seeing results such as Lane County’s 8.45% drop in “no shows”
in its facilitation program demonstrates that this program works and can significantly
improve a critical service that courts provide end users. The early successes of the Remote
Access Initiative are a product of a years-long effort by this subcommittee.

• Comprehensive Report to the Chief. Last fall, the Futures Subcommittee, on behalf of the
State Family Law Advisory Committee, recommended procedural modifications in light of
the Chief Justice’s Covid-19 Orders. These recommendations were offered to: (1) maintain
health and safety of litigants and court employees during the pandemic; (2) promote access to
justice; (3) ensure the continuing efficient delivery of court connected conflict resolution
services, both during the pandemic and continuing in the future. That report offered
suggestions to maintain and, where necessary, modify existing processes, tools, and
approaches. In addition, and in light of the innovation imperative of the pandemic, the
recommendations proposed broader solutions to meet existing barriers to access to justice
with the widely and recently adopted technologies. The Futures Subcommittee intends to
build upon this momentum of rapid adoption of technology and new paradigms to better
serve Oregonians by removal of barriers to justice.

What are the challenges for courts in implementing the recommendations from the 
subcommittee? 
The greatest challenge in implementing the recommendations from the subcommittee is that the 
legal industry is entrenched in a preference for the status quo. This is not a new dynamic. The 
legal industry has long lagged behind private business when it comes to embracing new 
technologies and changing practices to better suit an increasingly diverse demographic of users. 
But as technology continues to advance at an ever-increasing pace, users have different 
expectations for what their interactions and experiences with courts will look like. Users of today 
prefer text messages to emails, and would rather click a button on an online form than talk to a 
person behind a desk. The court needs to recognize these changes in how its constituents desire 
to interface, and pivot to accommodate these desires in a way that ensures better access to justice 
for all Oregonians—particularly in underserved populations. 

When changes are made, they must be made on a uniform basis, to the extent possible. It is 
difficult for the consumer (and those attempting to serve the consumer) to navigate an already 
confusing and difficult process when simple things like status conferences or temporary motions 
are handled differently on a county-to-county basis. Yet because our industry is entrenched in a 
long-standing desire to embrace the status quo, such moves to uniformity are often met with 
resistance at a county level. Education and encouragement will be a critical part of whatever 
innovations the court takes on as we launch forward out of the pandemic.

DATA SUBCOMMITTEE – Spring Report 2021 

Chairs: Linda Hukari (Trial Court Administrator, Marion County), Ryan Carty (Attorney, Salem)

Current Members:  Hon. Matthew Donohue (Benton County Circuit Court), John Grant 
(Attorney, Portland), Hon. Lauren Holland (Lane County Circuit Court), Hon. Maureen 
McKnight (Sr. Judge, Multnomah County Circuit Court), Jessica Roeser (BFSD, OJD), Nanci 
Thaemert (JFCPD, OJD), Conor Wall (BFSD,OJD) 

What is the goal/focus of the subcommittee? The focus of our committee is prioritizing the 
data reports that can be obtained and developed from the Odyssey case management system to 
provide relevant and practical information to the OJD, our community partners, and the 
legislature, all in an effort to further the mission and goals of the OJD. 

What are the subcommittee’s top short-term priorities? 
• Continue working on data refinements to the Restraining Order dashboard.
• Working with OJD to ensure better consistency in data quality. Identify areas of necessary

court staff training.

• Create a training webinar for courts to highlight data dashboards and promote the goal of

consistency in data quality across the state.

What are the subcommittee’s top long-term priorities? 
• Promote systems for sustainable collection of statewide data that is high in consistency and

quality.

• Provide relevant and practical data-driven information to OJD for use in planning and

implementation of programs, drafting budgets, allocating resources, requesting legislative
funding, etc.

What are the subcommittee’s top accomplishments? 
The data dashboard currently available through the OJD portal is already changing how courts 
process files and pleadings. The dashboard is being utilized in statewide TCA meetings to drive 
discussions on data entry, staff training, etc. Individual counties are able to assess effectiveness 
of data collection by comparing data available on the dashboard. Counties are also able to correct 
data entry issues. This centralized database has facilitated improvements in data collection 
procedures that will continue to get better over time.  

What are the challenges for courts in implementing the recommendations from the 
subcommittee? 
Recommendations from the Data Subcommittee typically have to do with data gathering. We 
need consistent data quality in order to have a meaningful and reliable end product. Our 
recommendations regularly focus both on how data gets to the courts and how that data is then 
entered into the Odyssey system. 

Statewide Family Law Advisory Committee Annual Report – Spring 2021 

Page 14 

Because these recommendations necessarily implicate training, this creates a burden on courts to 
(1) identify where data gathering and entry issues exist within their current framework, and (2)
train staff how to avoid and eliminate issues and errors. These steps take time and resources,
hence the push from the subcommittee to create webinars that support the training necessary to
refine the data process.

Court must have uniform policies and procedures on a statewide level. While there has been a 
push for more uniformity in the data entry process since the implementation of the eCourt 
system, there is still a long way to go. Not all courts utilize correct Odyssey codes for specific 
pleadings. Not all mediators return mediation reports. Not all attorneys utilize correct codes 
when filing pleadings and other documents. This is an education issue that we are working with 
both OJD staff and TCAs to address. Progress has already been made, but courts will have to 
continue making data quality a strong focus of staff training. In some instances, it is simply an 
awareness issue – a court may not realize pleadings are being entered with an incorrect code. 
Once this type of information has been provided to a court, the responses have been positive. 

MEMBERSHIP SUBCOMMITTEE – Spring Report 2021 

Chair:    Debra Dority (Vice Chair, Oregon Law State Support Attorney) Beginning Jan 2021 

William Howe (Former Vice Chair term ended Dec 2020) 

Current Members:  Stephen Adams (Mediator, Wallowa County), Colleen Carter-Cox 
(Program Coordinator, Lane County) Hon. Karrie McIntyre (Lane County Circuit Court)

Members whose terms ended December 31, 2021:  Amy Bonkosky (Trial Court Administrator, 
Crook/Jefferson Counties), William Howe (Attorney, Portland) 

What is the goal/focus of the subcommittee?  
Recommending and vetting nominees for the SFLAC membership to ensure a diverse, qualified, 
and hard-working group. 

What are the subcommittee’s top short-term priorities? 
Onboarding new members, continuing to interview new interested members, and working on the 
long-term priorities outlined below.   

What are the subcommittee’s top long-term priorities? 
The Membership Subcommittee’s future goals include outlining how best to engage those with 
expertise and interest to contribute and get involved in the SFLAC, SFLAC subcommittees, or 
subcommittee workgroups.  We are also focusing on the creation of onboarding resources for 
new SFLAC members. In addition, the Membership Committee renewed its commitment to 
ensuring that SFLAC supports successful family law policies, reforms and programs that serve 
all individuals and families who access Oregon’s courts. We recognize we can do so only with a 
diverse membership. We therefore reached out to a number of the affinity/diversity bars and 
encouraged Black, Indigenous, Latinx and persons of color; LGBTQIA2+ individuals; veterans; 

Statewide Family Law Advisory Committee Annual Report – Spring 2021 

Page 15

persons with disabilities; and persons from other traditionally underrepresented communities 
who may be interested in serving on the SFLAC to apply.  We also have identified the need for 
the child’s voice in some capacity, perhaps through having a K-12 educator involved or someone 
with expertise in representing children. 

What are the subcommittee’s top accomplishments? 
The Membership Subcommittee has enlisted and recommended top-quality candidates to the 
SFLAC.  The Membership Subcommittee recommended that the SFLAC nominate Ashland 
attorney Samantha Malloy and Hood River TCA Angie Curtis for membership on the SFLAC. 
The SFLAC members approved, and Chief Justice Walters appointed both to the SFLAC.  Both 
Samantha and Angie have already provided significant contributions to the work of the SFLAC.   

Finally, in 2020 the Membership Subcommittee interviewed more than 15 new people interested 
in joining SFLAC, many of whom have since joined subcommittees or subcommittee 
workgroups.   

What are the challenges for courts in implementing the recommendations from the 
subcommittee? 
We are still working to identify resources for qualified candidates who will bring an important, 
and often missing, voice to the table.  As indicated above, we have reached out to a number of 
affinity/diversity bars with the help of OJD’s Access to Justice Counsel, Valerie Colas.  Ms. 
Colas and Membership Chair Debra Dority have also started discussing additional ways in which 
the SFLAC can benefit from the DEI work that OJD is completing.     

CHILD SUPPORT SUBCOMMITTEE –Spring Report 2021 

Chairs:  Kate Cooper Richardson (Director, Division of Child Support, DOJ) and The Hon. 
Keith Raines (Sr. Judge, Washington County Circuit Court)

Members:  Newly re-constituting in 2021; membership is evolving 

What is the goal/focus of the subcommittee?  
The Child Support Subcommittee focuses on matters specific to child support that intersect with 
other areas of family law, access to justice, and particularly on the business of the courts and 
Oregon Judicial Department. 

What are the subcommittee’s top short-term priorities? 
The Child Support Subcommittee has been on hiatus for the last few years while the Department 
of Justice and Oregon Child Support Program undergo significant change with a new automated 
system and business processes.  The impact of the pandemic on the Oregon Child Support 
Program extended the timeline to revive this subcommittee.  The priority in the short term is to 
resurrect the subcommittee, identify continuing and new members, and reconvene to evaluate 
current issues and set priorities for future actions.  

Statewide Family Law Advisory Committee Annual Report – Spring 2021 

Page 16 

What are the subcommittee’s top long-term priorities? 
Although the subcommittee has not yet reconvened after its hiatus, an obvious long-term priority 
will be assisting and advising in the joint effort of OJD and DOJ to execute efforts to leverage 
the use of federal Title IV-D funds passed through the Oregon Child Support Program to the 
Oregon Judicial Department. This is a multi-prong effort reflecting a strategic priority for OJD 
that will involve collaboration and coordination among DOJ, OJD, and others and ultimately, it 
is hoped, lead to a child support referee structure. 

What are the subcommittee’s top accomplishments? 
Because the subcommittee has been on hiatus for some time, there is no recent accomplishment 
to highlight.  A notable prior accomplishment was the creation of an interactive, web-based 
parenting plan tool for parents to use to create an appropriate parenting plan for use both in the 
calculation of child support and to file in court to make enforceable, if the parties wish.  That tool 
resides on the OJD website. 

What are the challenges for courts in implementing the recommendations from the 
subcommittee? 
N/A at this time. 

FUTURE WORK OF THE SFLAC 

At our quarterly meetings, the SFLAC continues to diligently vet the work that is being done by 
the subcommittees with a focus on continuing to serve its statutory function of providing 
recommendations to the Oregon Judicial Department.  The SFLAC is also strongly engaged in an 
effort to significantly and positively shape family law policy for the State of Oregon to benefit all 
those families who interact with the Court system.  We have learned so much during the Covid-
19 pandemic about what is possible when those dedicated to this work think creatively.  The 
future work of the SFLAC will include considering what pieces of the new structures should be 
retained, how they should be improved, and what other processes can and should be 
implemented.  We continue to actively engage in the work necessary to improve the family law 
system for families throughout Oregon.
