The  statute  text  of  the  first  official
edition  of  Oregon  Revised  Statutes,  published
in  1953,  was  bound  in  loose-part  form,  with
each  chapter  constituting  a  part  that  could
be  removed  from  the  binder.

The  first  softcover  edition  of Oregon
Revised  Statutes  was  published  in  1989.  The
2021  edition  of  Oregon  Revised  Statutes
consists  of  23  softbound  volumes.

A  Table  of  Titles  and  a  Table  of  Titles
and  Chapters,  covering  all  19  volumes  of  the
statute  text,  follow  this  Preface.
Each
volume  begins  with  a  Table  of  Titles  and
Chapters  of  the  statutes  contained  in  that
volume.  A  chapter  outline  precedes  each
chapter  and  lists  the  ORS  sections  and

In  addition  to  the  statutes,  Oregon
Revised  Statutes  contains  the  Oregon  Rules

in  Volume  1
immediately  preceding  ORS  chapter  12.

contain,  with  some  exceptions,  the  statute
laws  of  Oregon  of  a  general,  public  and
permanent  nature  in  effect  on  January  1,
2022  (the  normal  effective  date  of  the  Acts

is
reproduced  verbatim  from  an  enrolled  Act,
with  the  exception  of  the  changes  in  form
permitted  by  ORS  173.160  and  other  changes
specifically  authorized  by  law.

The  Legislative  Counsel  has  no  general
authority  to  revise;  therefore,  aside  from  the
authorized  changes,  the  text  appearing  for
the  first  time  in  the  statute  text  is  not
revised  in  the  sense  that  statutes  enacted  as
a  part  of  House  Bill No. 2 of the 1953 session
(the  so-called  “revision bill” by which Oregon
Revised  Statutes  was  enacted)  were  revised.
See  the  Preface  to  the  1953  edition.  The
provisions of ORS 174.510 to 174.550, relating
to  the  enactment  and  construction  of  the
revised  statutes  enacted  by  House  Bill  No.
2,  are  not  applicable  to  every  statute  section
now  compiled  in  Oregon  Revised  Statutes.

The  Legislative  Counsel  has  set  forth  as
notes  certain  temporary  material  and  new
material  or  has  retained  repealed  statutes
with  notes  explaining  delayed  effective  dates.
The  notes  are  included  to  assist  the  user  in
placing  the  permanent  law  in  a  clearer
context.  In  some  instances,  the  notes  have
been  given  leadlines,  which  also  appear  in

Changes  in  text  of  Acts.  A  number  of
the  types  of  changes  made  in  the  text  of
enrolled  Acts 
in Oregon
Revised  Statutes  are explained and illustrated
below.

for  publication 

(1)  Changes  made pursuant to general

authority  granted  by  ORS  173.160:

(a)  ORS  numbers  are  assigned  to  codified
session  law  sections.  For  example,  section  2,
chapter  253,  Oregon  Laws  2009,  is  compiled
as  ORS  267.387.

(b)  Long  sections  of  session  laws  may  be
divided  into  several  shorter  ORS  sections.
For  example,  section  458,  chapter  338,
Oregon  Laws  1983,  is  compiled  as  the  series
ORS  816.040  to  816.290.

vii

PREFACE

(c)  Several  sections  of  session  laws  may
be  combined 
in  one  ORS  section.  For
example,  sections  1,  2,  and  3,  chapter  896,
Oregon  Laws  2009,  are  compiled  as  ORS
276.055.

(d)  Existing  ORS  sections  are  assigned
new  ORS  numbers  if  reorganization  of  the
material  is  warranted.  For  example,  ORS
418.035  was  renumbered  to  ORS  412.001  in
2007.

(e)  Actual  effective  dates  are  inserted  in
place  of  “the  effective  date  of  this  Act.”  For
example,  “the  effective  date  of  this  2003
Act”  was  replaced  by  “August  29,  2003”  in
section  4,  chapter  733,  Oregon  Laws  2003,
compiled  as  ORS  238A.070.

(f)  References  in  session  laws  to  “this
(year)  Act”  or  to  a  section  of  the  session
laws  are  replaced  by  specific ORS references.
For  example,  in  section  23,  chapter  179,
Oregon  Laws  2009,  amending  ORS  125.015,
the  words  “sections  1  to  22  of  this  2009
Act”  are  replaced  by  “ORS  125.800  to
125.852”  and  the  words  “section  2  of  this
2009  Act”  are  replaced  by  “ORS  125.802.”

(g)  Alterations  are  made  in  unamended
ORS  sections  containing  references  to  a
specific  series  of  ORS  sections  when  new
session  law  sections  were  “added  to  and
made  a  part  of”  that  ORS  series.
For
example,  “ORS  475.846  to  475.894”  (emphasis
added)  cited  in  ORS  133.619  (6)  in  the  2009
edition  was  expanded  to  “ORS  475.806  to
475.894”  (emphasis  added)  in  the  2011  edition
to accommodate sections 6 to 20, chapter 524,
Oregon  Laws  2011,  which  were  added  to  and
made  a  part  of  ORS  475.846  to  475.894  by
section  5,  chapter  524,  Oregon  Laws  2011,
but  which  could  not  be  accommodated
numerically  within  the  existing  series. The
new  sections  became  ORS  475.806  to  475.834
and  expanded  the  series  to  become  ORS
475.806  to  475.894.

(h)  Alterations  are  made  in  unamended
ORS  sections  when  new  session  law  sections
lieu  of”  repealed  ORS
are  enacted  “in 
sections  or  when  ORS 
sections  were
renumbered,  and  such  unamended  ORS
sections  contain  references  to  the  repealed
or  renumbered  ORS  sections.  For  example,
“307.248”  was  substituted  for  “310.692”  in
ORS  307.244  when  ORS  310.692  was
renumbered  ORS  307.248  in  2015.

of  sections  authorizing  substitutions  of  this
nature  appears  as  a  note  at  the  end  of  this
Preface.

“Not  added  to  and  made  a  part  of.”
Notes  may  indicate  that  a  particular  ORS
section  was  not  added  to  and  made  a  part  of
the  ORS  chapter  or  series  in  which  the
section  appears.  These  notes  mean  that  the
placement  of  the  section  was  editorial  and
not  by  legislative  action.  Notes  also  are  used
when  the  series  references  are  either  too
numerous  or  too  complex  to  bear  further
adjustment. However,  the  note  does  not
mean  that  the  section  not  added  to  a  series
or  a  chapter  is  any  less  the  law.  The  note  is
intended  only  to  remind  the  user  that
definitions,  penalties  and  other  references  to
the  series  should  be  examined  carefully  to
determine  whether  they  apply  to  the  noted
section.

For  example,  Oregon  Revised  Statutes

execution,  parole  and  probation.  A 
relating  to  any  of  those  subjects  may  be

Classification  and  arrangement.  One
of  the  fundamental  tasks  in  code  compilation
is  the  maintenance  of  a  sound  classification
system.  Proper  classification,  by  which  the
laws  or  parts  of  laws  are  brought  together  in
logical  consecutive  units, 
is  vital  for  a
number  of  reasons.  Classification  makes  the
law  more  accessible  and  understandable.

proper 

In  the  process  of  the  initial  classification
for  Oregon  Revised  Statutes,  the  statutes
were  divided  into  four  main  codes;  the  codes,
in  turn,  were divided into titles and the titles
into  chapters.  In  each  of  the  codes,  an
attempt  has  been  made  to  arrange  the  titles,
and  the  chapters  within  titles,  in  the  most
logical  sequence.  The  four  main  codes  are  as
follows:

with 

(1)  Volume  1  contains  the  remedial  code,
dealing 
and
court 
organization  and  remedies  (ORS  chapters  1
to  55)  and  the  Oregon  Rules  of  Civil
Procedure.

structure 

(2)  Volumes  2  and  3  contain 
the
commercial  and  civil  codes,  dealing  with
corporations  and  other  private  legal  entities,

PREFACE

commercial  transactions  and  relationships
between  individuals  (ORS  chapters  56  to
130).

(3)  Volume  4  contains  the  penal  code,
dealing  with  criminal  procedure,  crimes
generally  and  punishment  (ORS  chapters  131
to  170).

(4)  Volumes  5  through  19  contain  the
political  code,  dealing  with  the  structure  and
organization  of  state  and  local  government
and  with  the  services  rendered  and  the
regulation  exercised  by  government  (ORS
chapters  171  to  838).

The  basic  unit  of  classification  is  the
chapter.  Each  chapter  is  intended  to  include
all  the  statutes  relating  to  each  subject  that
logically  can  be  treated  as  a  unit.  The
arrangement  of  chapters  within  a  title  is
intended  to  lead  from  the  general  to  the
specific  or  to  deal with equally important but
distinct legislation.

steps  shall  be  taken  in  a  chronological  order,
the  steps  are  arranged  in  that  order.  If  a
chapter  consists  of  several  independent  or
separable  laws,  the  sections  dealing  with
each  law  are  arranged  according  to  the
pattern  just  described.  In  most  chapters,
except  those  in  the  penal  code  (Volume  4),
criminal  penalties,  and  often  civil  penalties,
for  violating  provisions  of  a  chapter  are
contained  in  the  last  section  or  sections  of
the chapter.

Appointment  and  designation  lists.
Lists  of  appointments  required  to  be  made  or
recommended  by  legislative  leadership  and
appointments  confirmed  by  the  Senate  follow
the  chapter  171  outline.  A  list  of  official
designations,  such  as  the  beaver  as  the
official  animal  of  the  State  of  Oregon,  follow
the  chapter  186  outline.

Numbering  system.  Under  the  decimal
system  adopted  for  Oregon  Revised  Statutes,
the  number  to  the  left  of  the  decimal  point
indicates  the  number  of  the  chapter  in which
the  section  is  located,  while  the  number  to
the  right  indicates  the  relative  position  of
the  section  within  the  chapter.  The  chapters
are  numbered  progressively  with  Arabic
numerals,  but  some  chapters  also  contain  an
alphabetic  reference,  e.g.,  ORS  chapter  72A.
A  progressive  rather  than  a  consecutive

ix

system  has been used in order that additional
chapters  may  be  inserted  in  future  editions
without  renumbering  existing  chapters.  The
sections  are  also  numbered  with  the  same
progressive system.

Legislative  history:  source  notes.  The
legislative  history  of  each  section  subsequent
to  its  enactment  as  a  part  of  the  1953
revision bill, as well as the legislative history
of  every  new  section,  is  noted  in  brackets  at
the  end  of  the  section.  The  pre-1953  history
is  contained  in  a  softcover  pamphlet  that  is
part  of  the  complete  edition  of  Oregon
Revised  Statutes.  Source  notes  for  sections
that  are  repealed,  amended  or  renumbered
and  new  sections  that  are  enacted  are
indicated  as  follows:

followed  by 

(1)  Repealed  sections.  The  number
“[1983  c.528  §8;
“657.222” 
repealed  by  2009  c.11  §83]”  means  that  ORS
657.222  was  enacted  by  Oregon  Laws  1983,
chapter  528,  section  8,  and  was  repealed  by
Oregon  Laws  2009,  chapter  11,  section  83.
Repealed  numbers  are  never  used  in  any
subsequent edition.

(2)  Amended  sections.  (a)  The  source
note  “[Amended  by  1961  c.160  §5]”  following
the  text  of  ORS  192.040  means  that  ORS
192.040  was  enacted  prior  to  the  1953
revision  and  was  amended  by  Oregon  Laws
1961,  chapter  160,  section  5.

following  the  number  “135.053”  means  that
ORS  135.053  was  enacted  by  Oregon  Laws
1979,  chapter  806,  section  1;  amended  by
Oregon  Laws  1981  (special  session),  chapter
3,  section  124;  and  then  repealed  by  Oregon
Laws  1985,  chapter  502,  section  28.
Renumbered 

The
legislative  history  of  a  renumbered  ORS
section 
the
renumbering  of  the  section  is  found  under
the  original  ORS  section  number.  The
legislative  history  of  the  section  for  the
period  after 
found
following  the  text  of  the  renumbered  section.
For example, the number “285A.271” followed
by  “[2003  c.818  §20;  renumbered  284.122  in
2007]” means that ORS 285A.271 was enacted
by  Oregon  Laws  2003,  chapter  818,  section
20, and was subsequently renumbered as ORS
284.122  in  2007.  (Beginning  with  the  1989
edition,  source  notes  for renumbered sections
indicate  the  year  of  the  renumbering.)  The
source  note  “[Formerly  91.766;  1997  c.249
§31]”  following  the  text  of  ORS  90.310 means
that ORS 90.310 is a renumbered section that
was formerly numbered ORS 91.766 and, after
renumbering,  ORS  90.310  was  amended  by
Oregon  Laws  1997,  chapter  249,  section  31.

“[1991  c.630  §1;  2009  c.595  §94]”  following the
text  of  ORS  137.227  means  that  ORS  137.227
was  enacted  by  Oregon  Laws  1991,  chapter
630,  section  1,  and  amended  by  Oregon  Laws
2009,  chapter  595,  section  94.

Most  new  ORS  sections  are  not expressly
enacted  “in  lieu  of”  statutes  superseded  by
them,  so  the  source  notes  following  the  text
of  such  new  sections  reveal  only  the  formal

some
instances,  the  amendment  or  repeal  of  a
section  does  not  become  operative  because
the  amendatory  or 
repealing  Act  was
referred  to  and  rejected  by  the  people.
Consequently, 
the  amendment  does  not
become  operative  and  is  not  compiled  as part
of  the  text.  This  fact  will  be  indicated  in  the
Comparative  Section  Tables  (Volume  22)  as
a  note. For  example,  “Note:  Chapter  906,
Oregon  Laws  1989,  was  referred  by  the
electors  and  not  approved.”

interested  in the text of an ORS section prior
to  its  amendment  or  repeal  should  consult
the  chapter  as  it  appeared  in  the  preceding
edition  of  Oregon  Revised  Statutes  or  the
appropriate  volume  of  Oregon  Laws  (session
laws)  for  the  year  in  which  the  change  was
made.  For  example,  the  source  note  to  ORS
58.410,  “[1987  c.94  §6;  1989  c.383  §2;  1991
c.132  §2;  1999  c.362  §§2,2a]”  shows  that  ORS
58.410  was  amended  in  1989,  1991  and  1999.
The  text  of  ORS  58.410 as it read prior to the
1999  amendment  can  be

Intended  veto.  The  text  contained  in
2021 Oregon  Revised  Statutes  does  not  reflect
operation  of  the  Governor’s  intended  veto  of
individual  sections  contained  in  chapter  10,
Oregon  Laws  2020  (second  special  session).
This  intended  veto  cited  the  single-item  veto
exception  found  in  Article  V,  section  15a,  of
the  Oregon  Constitution, 
for
appropriation  bills.  However,  chapter  10,
Oregon  Laws  2020  (second  special  session),
is  arguably  not  an  appropriation  bill,  which
is  “primarily  an  act  to
is  a  bill  that 
appropriate  money  to  pay  salaries  or  other
current  expenses,”  but  rather  a  substantive
bill.  See  Evanhoff  v.  State Industrial Accident
Commission,  78  Or.  503  (1915).  As  of  this
printing,  Oregon  appellate  courts  have  not
interpreted  the  term  “appropriation  bills”  for
purposes  of  Article  V,  section  15a.  In  the
2021  edition  of  Oregon  Revised  Statutes,
where  a  printed  statutory  or  session  law
section  is  one  that  was  amended  by  a  section
that  was  subject  to  this  intended  veto,  the
text  of  the  section 
is  printed  without
reflecting 
the  veto.  These  sections  are
followed  by  explanatory  notes.  Certain
session  law  sections  that  were  repealed  in
chapter 10, Oregon Laws 2020 (second special
session),  have  been  omitted  from  the  2021
edition

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
