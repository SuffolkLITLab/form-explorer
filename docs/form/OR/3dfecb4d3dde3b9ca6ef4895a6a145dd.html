he National Center for State Courts develops bilingual oral interpreting examinations for use by state court 
interpreter programs to ensure an objective, uniform, and nationwide performance standard for court 
interpreter candidates.  The scoring process for these exams is based on objective scoring units, which are 
specific linguistic phenomena that interpreters must be able to deliver for a complete and accurate 
interpretation. (For additional information on objective scoring units, see the descriptions at the end of this 
document.  For detailed information on the overall scoring process, see the Court Interpreter Oral 
Examination: Overview.   

ollowing the oral interpreting examination, candidates receive a Results Report Form which indicates test 
results, including the number of objective scoring units rendered correctly.  Although there are a number of 
factors that may impact a candidate’s performance, the Results Report Form does not include a holistic 
assessment or a diagnostic evaluation of the candidate’s performance.  Therefore, the following examples 
were designed to assist candidates who want to know why they may have obtained scores lower than they 
anticipated.  Below are common interpreting deficiencies that negatively impact performance:1 

 
Common Oral Interpreting Exam Performance Deficiencies 

 

Inaccuracies with Numbers  

Language Interference 

Literal Interpretation 

Omissions 

Paraphrasing 

Candidates misinterpret numbers in any of a variety of ways, e.g., 
inverting some of the numbers (such as changing 2345 to 2354), 
omitting some of the numbers in a date or address (e.g., getting the 
month and year but omitting the number of the day in a date), or just 
getting them wrong (such as interpreting 86 as 56).  

Candidates cannot keep the two languages separate from each other, 
allowing one language to affect how the candidate interprets into the 
other language.  This often results in an interpretation that is awkward 
and confusing or even unintelligible to a native speaker of that 
language. One primary example of this is the use of false cognates, 
words that sound the same and/or are spelled the same but have 
completely different meanings in the two languages. 

Candidates tend to be bound too much by the source material, 
resulting in renditions that are too literal, stilted, or at times 
incomprehensible, and do not sound natural in the target language.  
Oftentimes, the renderings are “word for word” or driven by the 
mistaken assumption that the interpretation should be “literal.”  This is 
especially problematic for many interpreters during the sight 
translation section. 

Candidates completely leave out certain words, phrases, sentences 
and sometimes even entire paragraphs of source material. 

Candidates render an approximate or condensed version of the 
original in his/her “own words” instead of preserving all the elements 
of the original message.

Primary Causes for Exam Performance Deficiencies 

There are several fundamental reasons why an interpreter candidate may demonstrate some or all of the 
exam performance deficiencies listed above.  

1. Many candidates lack the high level of language proficiency in one or both languages tested that is

required for successful court interpretation.  The primary features of this deficiency are:
•

Inadequate range of general vocabulary (including idioms, slang, adjectives, adverbs, verbs and
nouns) as well as legal terminology.
Inability to construct sentences and use one or the other language appropriately (i.e., grammar).
Failure to preserve not just the meaning of the source material, but also its pragmatic use in
discourse (issues of emphasis, nuances, and subtleties).

•
•

• Difficulty maintaining the level of language (register) of the source material.

2. Some candidates lack developed professional interpreting skills and cannot successfully perform one
or more of the three modes of court interpretation.  In the sight translation section, many do not know
how to analyze a written document and then deliver a smooth oral rendition of it into another
language.  In the consecutive mode, many candidates have not adequately developed their short-term
memory and do not know how to take and use notes effectively to handle utterances that vary in
complexity and length.  During simultaneous interpretation, many candidates cannot keep up with the
speed of the recorded test material, which causes them to fall behind.

3. Candidates also exhibit a lack of preparation for the exam.  Before the exam, all candidates should
prepare by carefully reading and studying the test overview document located at the following link:
Court Interpreter Oral Exam: Overview.  Candidates should also engage in sustained and frequent
practice in each of the modes of interpretation, and be well rested on the day of the exam.  Candidates
who know exactly what to expect will be better prepared on test day.

4. Finally, candidates also often display a lack of attention to detail while taking the exam.  During the
exam, candidates should follow directions carefully, and pay close attention to every element of the
source language material to be interpreted, being careful not to change, soften, harden, omit, or
otherwise alter the meaning of the source material.

The field of court interpreting requires a superior command of two languages.  Candidates must possess a 
mastery of both languages to be able to handle the widest range of language terms that may be presented 
in the courts—from specialized legal and technical terminology to street slang.  Candidates must also 
possess professional interpreting skills.  The wide base of knowledge and professional interpreting skills 
necessary can be acquired through taking college courses, reading widely in many fields of endeavor, 
observing many hours of court proceedings, internships, mentoring, studying reputable glossaries and 
dictionaries, and developing one’s own glossary and comparing terminological research with colleagues.  
Additionally, attending workshops and training events at professional court interpreter conferences may 
assist with the development of other knowledge, skills, and abilities essential for court interpretation. 

It is also imperative for candidates to acquire interpreting techniques through training and practice.  It is 
highly recommended that candidates record themselves while interpreting in a controlled environment. 
Practice materials, produced by the NCSC for court interpreter candidates to use for skills-building and 
interpretation practice, can be found at the following link: Court Interpreter Practice Materials.

Scoring Unit Descriptions and Testing Goals 

DESCRIPTION 

TESTING GOAL(S) 

Additional Information on Scoring Units 

Scoring units represent objective characteristics of language that the interpreter must understand and 
render appropriately during the interpretation. Each scoring unit is a word or phrase that captures a 
logically complete linguistic unit.2  

ests are scored on the basis of these scoring units. The following table lists the ten categories of scoring 
units and their corresponding testing goals:3 

 

  T

SCORING UNIT 
CATEGORY 

A:  Grammar 

B:  Language 

Interference 
 

“Grammar is a system of principles that 
govern the way a language works. 
Grammar describes how words are 
related to each other, particularly how 
they function in sentences.”4 
Terms or phrases that may invite 
misinterpretation due to interference of 
one language on another (e.g., false 
cognates, awkward phrasing, terms or 
phrases susceptible to literal renditions 
resulting in loss of precise meaning). 

C:  General 

Vocabulary 

Vocabulary that is widely used in ordinary 
parlance and could be spoken by native 
speakers appearing in any courtroom. 

D: Legal Terms  
and Phrases 

Any word or phrase of a legal or technical 
nature, or which is not common in 
everyday speech, but is commonly used 
in legal settings. 

E:  Idioms and 
Sayings 

An idiom is a speech form or an 
expression of a given language that is 
peculiar to itself grammatically or cannot 
be understood from the individual 
meanings of its elements5. Sayings are 
short expressions such as aphorisms and 
proverbs that are often repeated and 
familiar setting forth wisdom and truth.  

Ensure that candidates recognize and, within the 
limits of the source and target languages, 
satisfactorily handle the interpretation of 
grammar, especially verbs. 

1-Measure the ability to keep languages 
separate, speaking them as an educated native 
speaker would, with no interference from the 
other language, and  
2-Measure the ability to avoid being constricted 
unnecessarily by the source language resulting in 
interpretations that are literal or verbatim. 
1-Measure the ability to preserve lexical content 
of general source language terms when 
interpreted into the target language, 
2-Measure the depth and range of candidate’s 
vocabulary, and  
3-Measure the ability to tap into a deep reservoir 
of vocabulary without hesitating or stumbling. 
Measure the candidate’s range of knowledge and 
recognition of common legal terms and styles of 
language used in courtrooms and the ability to 
faithfully interpret them into the target language, 
going into both languages, but especially from 
English into the other language. 
Determine the candidate’s breadth of knowledge 
and understanding of a language’s common 
idioms and sayings, and the ability to interpret 
the meaning or an equivalent idiom or saying in 
the target language.

Assess the candidate’s ability to preserve the 
level of language so that others’ impression of 
the speaker is not raised or lowered by the 
interpreter and assess the candidate’s ability to 
interpret offensive terminology. 

Measure the candidate’s ability to be precise and 
accurate with all numbers, maintain weights and 
measures as stated in the source language 
without conversion, maintenance of names of 
businesses, streets, etc. without interpreting 
them (except that “Avenue, “Street,” etc. may or 
may not be interpreted, but the actual name is 
not to be interpreted), and conservation of every 
letter of a spelled name in the proper order. 

Ensure that the various ways of marking speech 
are preserved so the same degree of impact and 
precision is conveyed to the listener of the 
interpretation. 

Ensure that candidates preserve all elements of 
the source language, especially those that they 
may deem to be unimportant, or forget due to 
their location or function in the utterance. 

Measure the candidate’s range of knowledge of 
nonstandard, informal forms of speech and their 
ability to interpret the meaning of such words 
and phrases without being bound to preserve 
their low register. 

F:  Register 

G: Numbers and 

Names 

Style of language drawn upon in various 
social settings; a key element in 
expressing degrees of formality, including 
curses, profanity, and taboo words.  
Register shows, through a pattern of 
vocabulary and grammar, what a speaker 
or writer is doing with language at a given 
moment. 
Any number, measurement, or proper 
name. 

H:  Markers, 

Intensifiers, 
Emphasis and 
Precision 

I:   Embeddings 
and Position 

J:    Slang and 

Colloquialisms 

Any word or phrase giving emphasis or 
precision to a description (e.g., adverbs, 
adjectives) or statement (e.g., can be 
grammatical in form), including time 
movement (e.g., the day after tomorrow, 
last night, next week). 
Words or phrases that may be omitted 
due to position (at the beginning or 
middle of a long sentence, second in a 
string of adjectives or adverbs) or 
function (tag questions). 
Slang and colloquialisms are informal, 
nonstandard words or phrases that are 
used in informal, ordinary conversation 
but not in formal speech or writing and 
are identified in standard dictionaries as 
“slang,” “colloquialism,” or “informal” or 
are listed in published dictionaries of 
slang and/or colloquialisms or in scholarly 
articles and books so identifying them. 
Slang items, which are coined by social 
groups, may be used in test texts only  
when they have passed into widespread 
usage across the United States.
