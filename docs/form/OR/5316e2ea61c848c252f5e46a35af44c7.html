      <pre>2008 STATE OF THE OREGON COURTS

Justice in the 21st Century

Lady Justice, Supreme Court Building

“In  the  21st  century,  Oregon’s  courts  lead  the  nation  in

providing  fair,  accessible,  and  timely  justice  to  promote  the

rule of law, protect individual rights, and resolve conflicts. We

respect, reflect, and respond to the diverse people we serve.

We  earn  public  trust,  build  partnerships,  and  promote  safe,

caring  and  engaged  communities.”

Justice  2020:  A  Vision  for  Oregon’s  Courts  (2001)

Message from the Chief Justice

I am pleased to share with you the 2008 Annual Report for the

Oregon  Judicial  Branch.  This  report  reflects  the  past  year  of

achievements, accomplishments, and activities for the Oregon

Judicial  Department  performed  through  a  vision  focused  on

five  long  term  goals  to:

•

Protect public access to court services

• Maintain  the  public’s  trust  and  confidence

•

Provide  quality  and  timely  ways  for  people  to  resolve

•

Build strong partnerships with our justice system partners

their  disputes

and  in  our  communities

•

Effectively administer our courts so they work for people

In  that  regard,  I  want  to  express  my  profound  thanks  and

respect to those judges and employees of the Judicial Branch

for their daily commitment to justice and their service to every

person  who  enters  our  courthouses.

Building  a  Statewide  Electronic  Courthouse.  We  have

successfully initiated Oregon’s eCourt project.  Oregon eCourt

will  expand  and  simplify  access  to  courts,  allow  electronic

document filing and electronic payment of court fees, provide

better  information  to  judges  and  managers  for  decision-

making,  make  court  work  processes  more  efficient,  and

improve  the  availability  of  information  that  courts  share  with

our  justice  partners  and  stakeholders.

eFiling  in  the  Supreme  Court.  In  September  2008,  successful

implementation  of  eFiling  began  in  the  Supreme  Court.  This

process  addresses  the  growing  needs  of  a  geographically

dispersed  legal  community,  and  provides  a  convenient  and

secure  system  to  allow  users  to  eFile  at  any  time,  from  any

location with Internet access. The Court of Appeals launched

eFiling  in  early  2009.

Court Facilities. In partnership with the legislature, the counties,

and the Oregon State Bar, we have taken important first steps

to address glaring deficiencies in Oregon’s court facilities. The

2007  legislature  created  an  interim  Committee  on  Court

HIGHLIGHTS OF 2008

Chief Justice Paul J. De Muniz

Facilities, which, in 2008, identified the seismic, safety, and other

improvements needed in Oregon’s 48 state court facilities. The

committee’s final report was presented to the 2009 Legislative

Assembly.

As I write these words, our state and our nation are facing an

economic  crisis  sure  to  frame  the  court’s  budget  for  several

years.  Even  though  these  economic  times  continue  to  be

among the biggest challenges for the Judicial Branch, we will

endeavor  to  sustain  and  adapt  our  courts  to  meet  these

challenges  and  the  real  world  needs  of  the  public  we  serve.

The  mission  and  commitment  of  Oregon’s  state  courts  is  to

provide  fair  and  accessible  justice  services  that  protect  the

rights of individuals, preserve community welfare, and maintain

the public’s confidence in our justice system. With the continued

support  of  our  partners  in  the  Legislative  and  Executive

branches,  we  will  succeed.

Respectfully,

Paul  J.  De  Muniz

Chief  Justice

Overview of the Department

History

The Oregon Constitution states that “The judicial power of the

state  shall  be  vested  in  one  supreme  court  and  in  such  other

courts as may from time to time be created by law.” In 1981,

the  Legislative  Assembly  consolidated  Oregon’s  district  courts

(which  have  since  been  abolished),  circuit  courts,  tax  court,

and appellate courts into a unified, state-funded court system.

The system we now know as the Oregon Judicial Department

became effective on January 1, 1983.

The  State  of  Oregon’s  Judicial  Branch  of  government  and  its

state  court  system,  the  Oregon  Judicial  Department  remain

committed to being good stewards of the resources provided,

excellent producers of the work assigned, and to protect and

enhance public access to the courts.

grants) make up the rest of the OJD operating budget.

The  Department  is  comprised  of  a  Supreme  Court,  Court  of

Appeals, Tax Court, and 36 circuit courts in 27 judicial districts.

An Office of the State Court Administrator, comprised of eight

divisions  and  the  Internal  Auditing  Program,  provides

centralized  services  in  support  of  the  court  system.

The  Chief  Justice  of  the  Oregon  Supreme  Court  is  the

administrative  head  of  the  Department.  Among  other

responsibilities,  the  Chief  Justice  appoints  a  presiding  judge

for  each  judicial  district,  the  Tax  Court,  and  the  Court  of

Appeals.  The  Chief  Justice  also  appoints  the  State  Court

Administrator,  the  Department’s  chief  operating  officer.

Funding

The Oregon Judicial Department (OJD) receives its funding from

one  primary  source:  Legislative  appropriations  from  the  state

General Fund. A small amount of Federal Funds for specific grants

and  program  improvement  projects,  along  with  Other  Funds

(various fees, proceeds from the sale of court publications, and

The Judicial Department’s total budget for the 2007-09 biennium

is  approximately  $360  million.  This  amount  is  less  than  0.8%  of

the overall state budget. General Funds support approximately

88%  –  or  $315  million  –  of  the  Department’s  biennial  budget.

Federal  and  other  funds  make  up  the  12%  balance.  Personnel

expenditures account for more than 90% of the OJD budget. In

the  circuit  courts,  personnel  costs  make  up  approximately  95%

of  the  court’s  operating  budget.

The Judicial Department is on track to collect nearly $272 million

dollars during the 2007-09 biennium from court users and criminal

defendants.  These  funds  support  agencies  and  programs  that

aid victims of crime, police training, and other valuable services

including  $54  million  that  is  returned  to  the  state  General  Fund.

Statewide,  the  Oregon  Judicial  Department  is  projected  to

collect $25 million in restitution and compensatory fines for victims

of  crime  and  their  families.

Oregon’s Supreme Court

The  Supreme  Court  is  Oregon’s  highest  court  and  exists  by

virtue  of  Article  VII  (Amended)  of  the  Oregon  Constitution.

The  Supreme  Court  has  the  ultimate  responsibility  for

announcing  and  interpreting  Oregon  law.

The  primary  work  of  the  Supreme  Court  is  to  review  decisions

of the Oregon Court of Appeals. The court devotes substantial

resources  toward  considering  whether  a  particular  petition

seeking  the  court’s  review  presents  an  important  question  for

adjudication.  These  cases  fall  under  the  court’s  discretionary

jurisdiction. The court’s discretionary jurisdiction competes with

a  substantial  number  of  cases  that  fall  under  the  court’s

mandatory  jurisdiction–cases  that,  if  filed,  the  Supreme  Court

has no choice but to accept. The court’s mandatory caseload

is  a  growing  portion  of  its  total  caseload  and  includes:

1. Automatic  reviews  in  death  penalty  cases

2. Appeals  from  the  Oregon  Tax  Court

3. Appeals  involving  certain  types  of  labor  disputes

4. Administrative  reviews  of  prison,  energy  facility,  and

waste  disposal  site  decisions

5. Reviews  in  lawyer  discipline  and  admissions  matters

6. Reviews  involving  questions  of  judicial  fitness  and

disability

7.

Specific cases or issues that the legislature has

directed  the  Supreme  Court  to  consider

8. A  variety  of  election-related  petitions,  including

ballot  title  review  proceedings  and  challenges  to

explanatory  and  fiscal impact statements

Mandatory  cases  account  for  between  30  to  40  percent  of

the  court’s  annual  decisions.

Accomplishments of the Last Year

Supreme  Court  eFiling  Up  and  Running.  In  September  2008,

the Oregon Supreme Court became the first court in the state

to  begin  accepting  court  documents  via  electronic  filing.

Members of the Oregon State Bar authorized to practice law

in  Oregon  are  able  to  file  documents  from  their  own

computers,  24  hours  per  day,  7  days  per  week,  freeing  them

of the burden of submitting paper copies of case documents

to  the  court.  eFilers  have  the  added  convenience  of  paying

any  filing  fees,  copy  charges,  and  transaction  charges  using

an electronic payment system. Attorneys who wish to use the

eFiling system must have a valid email address on file with the

Oregon  State  Bar,  register  with  the  Oregon  Judicial

Department,  obtain  a  user  name,  and  complete  training

through online tutorials. In addition to completing the tutorials,

users  should  familiarize  themselves  with  Chapter  16  of  the

Oregon  Rules  of  Appellate  Procedure  available  at  http://

www.publications.ojd.state.or.us/Rules.htm. In the future, users

will  also  be  able  to  access  court  documents  and  case

information via the Internet. This Supreme Court eFiling project

has  served  as  a  successful  pilot  for  the  Oregon  Judicial

Department’s  Oregon  eCourt  Program.

A  Digital  Collection  of  Legal  Resources.  The  State  of  Oregon

Law Library is the principal resource for legal research in state

government,  and  provides  public  access  to  information  on

the  law.  The  library  is  currently  in  transition  from  a  traditional

library  to  one  that  also  provides  digital  resources  for  legal

research online. The library is adopting emerging technologies

to  make  its  unique  collection  of  Oregon  legal  material

accessible from anywhere in the state as well as on the Internet.

Throughout  2008,  the  library  worked  aggressively  to  enhance

its  online  research  tools  by  giving  patrons  access  to  online

databases like PACER, BarBooks, and Westlaw Patron Access.

The  library  also  added  Webster’s  Third  New  International

Dictionary  online,  for  use  by  the  courts,  and  expects  to  have

wireless  Internet  access  available  in  the  library  soon.

Oregon’s Intermediate
Appellate Court

The Court of Appeals is Oregon’s intermediate appellate court.

By  statute,  the  Court  of  Appeals  is  charged  with  deciding

nearly all of the civil and criminal appeals taken from the circuit

courts, and nearly all judicial reviews taken from administrative

contested  cases.  Created  by  statute  in  1969,  the  Court  of

Appeals  does  not  exercise  jurisdiction  under  the  constitution.

Its  jurisdiction  is  set  by  the  legislature.

The Oregon Court of Appeals consistently ranks as one of the

busiest appellate courts in the nation. Over the past decade,

the  Court  of  Appeals  has  received  in  the  range  of  3,300  to

4,000 filings per year. To meet the demands of that workload,

the court is divided into three departments or “panels” (each

comprised  of  three  judges),  which  consider  cases.  A  fourth

three-judge panel made up of one judge taken from each of

the  first  three  panels,  sits  separately  to  consider  substantive

motions  filed  in  appeals  or  judicial  reviews.

The  Chief  Judge  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  sits  as  a  non-voting

member  on  each  of  the  court’s  four  departments  and

participates in their deliberations. This permits the Chief Judge

to act as a substitute voting member on any panel when one

of  the  other  judges  cannot  participate,  helping  to  maintain

consistency  in  the  decision  making  process.

Before  a  panel  releases  an  opinion  in  a  case,  the  proposed

opinion  is  circulated  to  all  the  court’s  judges.  Any  one  of  the

judges  may  disagree  with  the  opinion  and  refer  the  case  to

the  full  10-judge  court.  This  happens  in  approximately  three

percent of the court’s cases.

The  Court  of  Appeals  typically  issues  between  350  and  400

written  opinions  each  year,  or  35  to  40  opinions  per  judge.

Each  judge  usually  has  an  active  list  of  between  25  and  30

cases  that  have  been  assigned  to  that  judge  for  a  written

opinion.

Appellate Case Management System

The  Court  of  Appeals  has  implemented  a  new  automated

Appellate  Case  Management  System,  which  is  a  key

component  of  Oregon  eCourt,  the  Chief  Justice’s  vision  for

an “electronic courthouse.” The Appellate Case Management

System  is  now  up  and  running,  allowing  automated  case

tracking  and  data  entry,  document  generation,  automated

statistical  report  generation,  and  providing  a  shared  system

used  by  both  the  Court  of  Appeals  and  the  Apellate  Court

Records  Section.

Appellate Performance Measures

The  Court  of  Appeals  Performance  Measures  design  team,

which  began  meeting  in  the  fall  of  2005,  developed  three

success  factors  for  the  court  to  focus  on  to  improve  the

appellate  court  process:  Quality,  Timeliness  &  Efficiency,  and

Public  Trust  &  Confidence.  The  court’s  progress  toward

achievement of these success factors will be measured by an

accompanying  set  of  core  performance  measures:

1. Appellate Bar and Trial Bench Survey. The percentage

of  members  of  the  Oregon  appellate  bar  and  trial

bench who believe that the Oregon Court of Appeals

is delivering quality justice, both in its adjudicative and

other  functions

2. On-Time  Case  Processing.  Percentage  of  cases

resolved  within  established  time  frames

3. Clearance  Rate.  The  ratio  of  outgoing  to  incoming

cases  by  type  (civil,  criminal,  collateral  criminal,

juvenile,  agency,  or  board)

4. Productivity.  The  number  of  cases  resolved  by  the

Court  of  Appeals  by  type  (signed  opinions,  opinions

of  the  whole  court,  affirmances  without  opinion,

dispositive  orders)

Periodic standard reports will provide appellate case data to

help  the  court  evaluate  outcomes  and  progress  toward

meeting  the  performance  measures.

The  design  team  also  functions  in  an  advisory  capacity,

guiding  the  court’s  management  and  leadership  in  the

integration of performance measurement throughout the court,

its  offices,  divisions,  and  programs.  Management  and

leadership  are  responsible  for  monitoring  and  analysis  of  the

integration  by  looking  at:

 The  court’s  progress  over  time

 What  the  court  is  doing  to  improve  or  maintain  good

 What  performance  targets  and  goals  should  be  set

performance

for the future

Appellate Commissioner Program

In  2008,  the  court  reorganized  the  Office  of  Appellate  Legal

Counsel,  renaming  it  the  Appellate  Commissioner’s  Office.

The  goal  of  the  appellate  commissioner  is  to  decrease  the

amount of time it takes for substantive motions to be decided

by  the  Court  of  Appeals.

The  commissioner  has  authority  to  consider  and  decide

motions,  motion  procedural  matters  (such  as  orders  to  show

cause  as  to  why  a  case  should  not  be  dismissed),  and  any

other  matter  that  the  Court  of  Appeals  or  Chief  Judge  may

delegate  for  a  decision.  Parties  may  request  reconsideration

of  a  ruling  made  by  the  appellate  commissioner.  The

commissioner may review and modify or reverse the result, or

may, upon denying the request or affirming the original ruling,

forward  the  request  to  either  the  Chief  Judge  or  the  Motions

Department of the Court of Appeals for a decision. A complete

description  of  the  Appellate  Commissioner’s  decisional

authority  can  be  read  at:  www.publications.ojd.state.or.us/

Oregon Supreme Court Building Detail

The Oregon Tax Court

Created  by  statute  in  1961,  the  Oregon  Tax  Court  is  one  of

only three state tax courts in the United States and as of 1995,

the only tax court that has two divisions: a Magistrate Division

and  a  Regular  Division.  The  Tax  Court  has  exclusive  statewide

jurisdiction  over  cases  that  involve  Oregon’s  tax  laws.

Currently,  it  takes  an  average  of  only  seven  months  from  the

date of filing for a magistrate to complete a written decision.

Litigants  who  disagree  with  a  magistrate’s  decision  may  seek

a new trial at the Tax Court’s Regular Division level. More than

90  percent  of  litigants  involved  in  tax  dispute  reviews  at  the

Magistrate  level  are  satisfied  with  the  decision,  and  do  not

A Commitment to Sharing Resources. The court has continued

to make appropriate reductions in magistrate and operations

staff  relative  to  a  decline  in  caseload.  Also  in  proportion  to

caseload decline in the Regular Division, the Tax Court Judge

has continued to volunteer a partial re-allocation of his services

by  sitting  as  a  temporary  judge  on  the  Court  of  Appeals.

Access  to  Justice.  In  2007  and  2008,  public  outreach  efforts

included three roundtable meetings with representatives of state

and  local  tax  offices  and  taxpayers.  The  purpose  of  the

meetings was to discuss the procedures of the Tax Court, and

to  address  questions  or  comments  from  people  who  have

appeared,  or  plan  to  appear  in  the  court.

The  Tax  Court’s  litigant  handbook,  Tax  Appeals,  which  is

available  to  parties  filing  a  tax  dispute  review  with  the

Magistrate Division, has been translated into Spanish for easier

access  by  Spanish  speaking  taxpayers.  The  information  in  the

handbook  is  designed  to  help  litigants,  including  government

agencies,  who  are  not  represented  by  attorneys,  prepare  an

appeal  to  the  court.

When fully implemented, Oregon eCourt will make Oregon
the first state in the country to have a statewide electronic
courthouse.

Building A Statewide
Electronic  Courthouse

Oregon  e-Court.  The  Oregon  Judicial  Department  launched

the  Oregon  eCourt  program  to  build  a  virtual  courthouse  on

the  web.  When  complete,  it  will  allow  users  to  electronically

file  documents,  pay  fees  and  fines,  gain  access  to  court

documents,  dockets,  and  related  content  from  anywhere,  at

anytime.

The  program  transforms  court  business  processes  with  the  use

of  updated  technology,  and  results  in  open  access  to  the

courts  for  the  general  public  and  legal  community.  Oregon

eCourt will also give courts and judges better tools they need

to  provide  just,  prompt,  and  safe  resolution  of  civil  disputes;

to  improve  public  safety  and  the  quality  of  life  in  our

communities;  and  to  improve  lives  of  children  and  families  in

crisis.

The  Oregon  Judicial  Department  has  spent  the  past  year

planning  and  designing  Oregon  eCourt  for  the  circuit  courts.

Several projects are underway, such as a redesigned website

to provide a consistent look and feel across the web pages of

all  the  courts,  and  a  plan  to  implement  electronic  content

management  (ECM),  which  allows  the  public  and  members

of  the  legal  community  to  access  case  information  and

documents.  Building  from  the  successful  implementation  of

electronic  filing  (eFiling)  and  electronic  payment  services  for

the  Supreme  Court,  the  Court  of  Appeals  launched  eFiling  in

early  2009.  Implementation  of  ECM  in  several  pilot  trial  courts

will  begin  late  2009.

In  late  2008,  the  Chief  Justice  revised  the  Oregon  eCourt

implementation  strategy  in  response  to  reduced  revenue

forecasts  for  the  2009  -  2011  biennium.  The  original  vision  is

maintained, but activities are re-focused to maximize their value

under  the  forecasted  budget  challenges.

The  Condition
of Our Court Facilities

Numerous courthouses throughout the state are overcrowded,

inaccessible  to  citizens  with  disabilities,  and  are  in  need  of

repair.  Many  have  deteriorating  electrical  wiring  that  does

not  support  modern  technology,  inadequate  heating  and

plumbing systems, and are at structural risk in the event of an

earthquake.

To study facility conditions and recommend possible solutions,

the  Oregon  Judicial  Department  assembled  a  task  force  in

partnership  with  the  Association  of  Oregon  Counties  and  the

Oregon State Bar. In December of 2006, the task force released

a  Report  on  Oregon  Court  Facilities  that  included  proposals

to the 2007 Legislature to establish facility standards and secure

revenues  through  state-guaranteed  bonding  for  court

renovation  and  construction  projects.  The  task  force’s  2007

legislation efforts led to passage of House Bill 2331, Section 18,

which  established  an  interim  Legislative  Committee  on  Court

Facilities  to:

2. Make  recommendations  on  standards  for  reasonable

and  sufficient  court  facilities

3. Make recommendations on the cost of meeting those

are  made

In  2008,  the  Interim  Committee  on  Court  Facilities  hired  a

consultant  to  assess  the  condition  of  state  court  facilities  and

estimate  an  overall  cost  relative  to  the  Draft  Guidelines  to

Oregon Court Facilities, previously adopted by the committee.

In  September  2008,  the  Oregon  Court  Facilities  Assessment

Summary Report was published addressing items one and three

from the above list. The report evaluates the status of the state’s

court  facilities  including  building  condition,  code  issues,

systems,  and  infrastructure,  as  well  as  courtroom  size  and

configuration – based on the type of proceedings to be held

there. The report also provides the estimated cost for meeting

recommended  standards.

The Interim Committee on Court Facilities is scheduled to meet

in  January  2009  to  determine  reasonable  and  sufficient

standards  for  court  facilities,  develop  a  proposal  for  ensuring

that  needed  improvements  will  be  made,  and  to  adopt  the

final  committee  report  to  provide  to  the  2009  Legislative

Assembly.

Highlights of the Oregon Court Facilities Assessment Summary

Report.  Oregon’s  circuit  court  facilities  are  diverse,  ranging  in

size from 8,900 to 569,000 square feet, and in age from two to

120 years old. The buildings themselves are of various structure

types,  from  renovated  hospitals  to  recently  built  courthouses.

All  48  circuit  court  facilities  were  evaluated  subject  to  the

committee’s  adopted  guidelines.  The  courthouses  were

ranked  from  best  to  worst  as  a  result  of  their  individual

condition  assessments  and  overall  cost  estimates.

Oregon’s  Courthouse  Ratings.  The  courthouses  were  rated  on

a scale of one to five.  A rating of 1, 2, or 3 was designated as

“Does  Not  Meet”  and  a  rating  of  4  or  5  was  designated  as

“Meets.”  The  overall  ratings  for  38  courts  fell  into  the  “Does

Projected  Cost  of  Bringing  Courthouses  into  the  21st  Century.

In  2008,  the  estimated  total  cost  to  upgrade  all  of  the

courthouses  to  meet  adopted  guidelines  amounts  to

$843,452,046. This overall cost is broken down into the following

cost  categories  (see  Graph  2  below):

1.

Life Safety: Life safety in courthouses (building and fire

codes)  and  seismic  performance  ($55,982,509  -  7%)

2. Security:  Physical  security  of  the  courthouses  and

security systems ($215,512,303 - 26%)

3. Americans with Disabilities Act: Accessibility for public

entries,  court  areas,  jury  areas,  and  staff  locations

($52,922,084 - 6%)

4.

Improvements:  Functional  performance  (courtroom

size,  judicial  officer’s  spaces,  jury  assembly  and

deliberation,  court  administration),  overall  building

condition  and 

infrastructure  of  courthouses

($519,035,150 - 61%)

Improving  court  facilities  around  the  state  is  an  essential  goal

of  the  Judicial  Department’s  Strategic  Plan.  In  the  next  five

years,  the  Judicial  Department,  in  association  with  the

legislature,  governor,  counties,  and  Oregon  State  Bar,  must

develop and implement a long-term, statewide, court facilities

funding  system  that  will  pay  for  the  upgrade  of  deteriorating

court  facilities  throughout  the  state.

14

Development of a
Five-Year Strategic Plan

In July 2008, Chief Justice DeMuniz assembled a Strategic Plan

Leadership  Team  to  develop  the  Department’s  first  five  year

strategic plan. In the two months that followed, the Leadership

Team  developed  a  proposed  plan  that  identified  five  major

goals derived from the Department’s Justice 2020: A Vision for

Oregon’s  Courts:

 Protect Public Access to Justice

 Maintain  Public  Trust  and  Confidence

 Provide  Quality  and  Timely  Dispute  Resolution

 Collaborate  with  Justice  System  Partners  and  Other

Stakeholders

 Enhance  Judicial  Administration

The  team  then  compiled  a  list  of  action  items  taken  from  a

broad range of Oregon Judicial Department documents and

committee  recommendations,  that  would  help  accomplish

the  goals  of  the  strategic  plan.

The action items selected addressed the interests and priorities

of the entire Judicial Department. They were narrowed down

and  included  in  an  anonymous  survey  which  was  distributed

to  every  employee  of  the  Judicial  Department.  Eighty-four

percent responded, and more than 1,100 of those employees

– better than 50 percent – provided feedback which was used

to  further  update  and  improve  the  Strategic  Plan.

In  the  best  of  times,  it  is  helpful  to  have  a  plan  to  guide  and

prioritize  the  Oregon  Judicial  Department’s  work.  Given  the

severity of current economic conditions under which the OJD

must  operate  today,  and  into  the  2009  -  2011  Biennium,  a

strategy  is  crucial.  The  Strategic  Plan  provides  a  roadmap

towards meeting the branch’s commitment to long held goals.

Kingsley  W. Click, State Court Administrator

Office of the
State Court Administrator

The State Court Administrator is appointed by the Chief Justice

and  is  the  state  court  system’s  chief  operating  officer.  This

position, and a number of divisions, assists the Chief Justice in

statutory  statewide  administrative  duties  such  as:  delivering

infrastructure  services  to  the  courts  (for  example,  technology

services  and  security);  personnel  administration;  accounting

and revenue; statistics relating to court workloads, caseloads,

expenses, and revenues; public information service regarding

the  courts;  education  and  technical  assistance  programs  for

judges and staff; retention schedules and standards for court

records,  policies,  procedures;  and  many  others.

Public Outreach and Education

In June 2008, the Oregon Judicial Department established the

Office of Education, Training, and Outreach as an independent

division within the Office of the State Court Administrator. The

purpose of the Office of Education, Training, and Outreach is to

develop and deliver a broad scope of training and education for

all Oregon Judicial Department judges and staff, such as the New

Judge Seminar, Judicial Regional Continuing Legal Education,

Clerk  College,  Supervisory  C.A.M.P.  (Creating  Administrative

Management  Professionals),  New  Employee  Orientation,  and

other skill improvement programs. Programs offering continuous

training at the Oregon Judicial Department are expected to build

a  knowledgeable  work  force  that  is  prepared  to  perform  job

responsibilities fairly and effectively throughout the state court

system.

The  practical  use  of  maintaining  a  division  dedicated  to

judicial  and  staff  education  and  training,  combined  with

public  education  and  civic  outreach,  will  be  further

demonstrated  through  the  statewide  implementation  of

Oregon eCourt. Complete implementation of Oregon eCourt

will  require  statewide  communication,  education,  and

training so that the courts, divisions, judges, staff, members of

the Oregon State Bar, business partners, and the citizens who

depend  on  our  courts  will  have  the  skills  and  knowledge

necessary to utilize Oregon eCourt’s applications and services.

Court  Collections.  During  the  2008  fiscal  year,  increased

Oregon Supreme Court Building Column Detail

The  Citizen  Review  Board.  The  Citizen  Review  Board  is  the

Judicial  Department’s  statewide  foster  care  review  program.

The  program  is  comprised  of  community  boards  staffed  by

qualified  volunteers  in  35  of  36  counties  throughout  Oregon.

These  local  boards  review  the  case  plans  of  children  in

substitute  care  to  ensure  that  their  placements  and  services

are  appropriate  and  timely.  Boards  issue  a  findings  and

recommendations report on case reviews to the Juvenile Court

and  the  Department  of  Human  Services,  and  also  advocate

for effective policies, procedures, and laws in the child-welfare

and  juvenile-justice  systems.

A Citizen Review Board practice improvement process started

in  2003,  took  its  final  step  in  July  2008  with  the  statewide

implementation of a process called “Review by the Findings.”

The new process establishes a consistent, standard procedure

used  in  conducting  case  reviews.  It  includes  a  re-ordering  of

the  findings  to  promote  a  more  sequential  review,  and  to

specify early on, what the child’s needs are related to safety,

well  being,  and  permanence.

collection  efforts  in  the  local  courts  and  successful  regional

collections programs enabled the Oregon Judicial Department

to  increase  its  rate  of  collection  for  the  eighth  consecutive

year. A critical factor in this increase was the implementation

of an improved tax intercept program. In a joint effort between

local  courts  and  the  Department  of  Revenue,  facilitated  by

the  Business  and  Fiscal  Services  Division  of  the  Office  of  the

State  Court  Administrator,  the  Oregon  Judicial  Department

was  able  to  expand  the  program  and  take  advantage  of  a

large  kicker  rebate  and  regular  tax  offsets.  This  resulted  in  an

additional  collection  of  $4,000,000.  During  fiscal  year  2009,

the  Department  will  continue  using  the  offset  program  with  a

new  program  feature  that  refers  debtors  who  have  become

delinquent to the Department of Revenue on a monthly basis.

The Oregon Judicial Department has three regional collection

teams  located  in  the  circuit  courts.  Teams  take  a  proactive

approach,  working  with  collection  partners  including

community corrections and the district attorney, to hold debtors

accountable  through  restitution  collection.  In  total,  regional

collection  teams  service  17  judicial  districts  in  western  and

17

Oregon Supreme Court Gavel

and  staff  mediators  to  qualify  them  as  court-connected

eastern Oregon, and the Clackamas Circuit Court. Restitution

courts established in Clackamas and Yamhill courts are serving

as a model for other courts that are exploring similar programs.

Crime  Victims  Rights  in  the  Circuit  Courts.  On  May  20,  2008,

Oregon  voters  passed  two  constitutional  amendments  that

grant  crime  victims  the  right  to  bring  enforcement  actions

(claims)  alleging  a  violation  of  one  or  more  of  the  victim’s

rights granted under Sections 42 and 43, Article I, of the Oregon

Constitution.  The  Chief  Justice’s  Crime  Victims  Rights

Compliance  Committee  drafted  Uniform  Trial  Court  Rule

Amendments  (UTCR  4.100  -  4.130)  and  trial  court  procedures

that  instruct  victims,  courts,  and  involved  parties  how  to

proceed  if  a  claim  is  made.  The  committee  also  developed

two printed court guides that outline the court’s responsibilities

to  crime  victims  and  hosted 

three 

informational

teleconferences  to  explain  the  new  rules  and  procedures.

Dispute  Resolution  Through  Mediation.  The  Oregon  Judicial

Department  continues  to  work  with  a  network  of  associations

and programs across the state, to provide training for volunteer

mediators.  In  2008,  Court  Programs  and  Services  Division  staff

worked with court staff from Multnomah and Columbia County

Circuit  Courts  to  establish  a  mediator  mentorship  program.

Deschutes  and  Coos  County  Circuit  Courts  developed  pilot

programs with local community dispute resolution centers, and

will  work  with  Central  Oregon  Mediation  to  provide  a  pilot

probate  mediation  program.  Coos  County  Circuit  Court  will

work with Coos-Douglas Mediation to establish a foster parent

-  foster  teen  mediation  program.

Job Classification Studies. In the last year, the Oregon Judicial

Department  began  the  largest  job  classification  study  in  its

history. The object of the study was to determine whether job

duties  need  to  be  updated  or  revised  to  provide  more

operational  flexibility  in  work  assignments  as  the  courts

complete  their  move  into  a  technology-based  era.

18

The  first  part  of  the  study  involved  the  classifications  of  Court

Operations  Specialist,  Account  Clerk,  Verification  Specialist,

and  Judicial  Assistant,  at  both  the  courts  and  the  central

administrative offices, amounting to nearly 1,200 positions. After

statewide  desk  audits,  focus  groups,  and  employee

questionnaires, a decision was made to combine 13 outdated

classifications  into  a  new  four-level  classification  series.  The

new classifications reflect current job duties and technologies,

and  were  implemented  on  January  1,  2008.

The second part of the study, currently in progress, involves 13

professional,  non-management,  analyst  classifications.  This

study,  scheduled  for  completion  by  September  2009,  will

update  approximately  225  positions.

Security,  Emergency  Preparedness,  and  Business  Continuity

Planning.  In  the  last  year,  the  Judicial  Department  hired  a

Security  and  Emergency  Preparedness  Manager  and

established  the  Office  of  Security  and  Emergency

Preparedness.  The  Security  and  Emergency  Preparedness

Advisory  Committee  developed  security  standards  for  the

appellate,  tax,  and  circuit  courts  in  Oregon,  as  well  as  a  five

year  strategic  plan  to  implement  the  standards.

During  2008,  the  department  contracted  with  the  National

Center for State Courts to perform security assessments of the

appellate, tax, circuit, municipal, and justice courts of the state.

Enhanced circuit court security, emergency preparedness, and

business  continuity  plan  templates  were  updated  and

distributed,  assisting  courts  in  improving  their  local  plans.  To

test  circuit  court  security,  emergency  preparedness,  and

business  continuity  plans,  three  exercises  were  conducted  in

2008, with more planned for the upcoming calendar year. To

support  emergency  communications  throughout  the

Department,  satellite  telephones  were  assigned  to  the

appellate,  tax,  circuit  courts,  and  the  Office  of  State  Court

Administrator.

Treatment  Courts.    Oregon’s  treatment  courts  provide

individualized  treatment  programs  that  include  supervision,

support, and community-based treatment services for offenders

who  have  mental  health  issues  or  are  addicted  to  drugs  or

alcohol.  In  these  specialized  courts,  offenders  voluntarily

participate  in  an  intense  program  of  treatment,  drug  testing,

and  supervision  that  is  closely  monitored  by  a  team  of

representatives  from  the  judiciary,  prosecution,  defense,

probation  department,  law  enforcement,  and  treatment

community. Offenders who are in treatment programs appear

regularly  before  a  judge,  who  may  offer  recognition  for  their

accomplishments,  or  order  sanctions  for  noncompliance.

In  2008,  two  adult  drug  courts,  one  juvenile  drug  court,  and

one mental health court were added to Oregon’s existing roster

of 57 treatment courts. About 200 treatment court professionals

throughout  the  state  attended  a  2008  Treatment  Court

Symposium,  where  they  received  training  on  key  issues  that

impact  treatment  courts,  including  prescription  drug  abuse,

providing  treatment  to  those  who  live  in  poverty,  and

permanent  fetal  birth  defects  caused  by  drinking  alcohol

Also during 2008, the Oregon Judicial Department conducted

two  process  evaluations  and  one  outcome  evaluation  of

treatment  courts  in  Union  and  Yamhill  counties.  Information

from  those  studies,  in  addition  to  a  recidivism  study  being

conducted  by  the  Oregon  Criminal  Justice  Commission  and

an evaluation of Oregon’s drug courts currently underway by

Northwest  Professional  Consortium  Research,  will  increase  the

overall  effectiveness  of  treatment  courts  in  Oregon.

Comparison of Cases Filed to Cases Closed

While case processing requirements vary by case type, all cases

have  a  distinct  cycle  that  includes  initial  filing  and  ultimate

completion. Oregon Judicial Department judicial officers and

staff  work  diligently  to  bring  cases  to  a  speedy  resolution  but

cases  are  not  always  completed  in  the  same  year  that  they

were  filed.  The  graphs  on  page  22  show  the  total  number  of

cases  filed  in  each  court  and  the  total  number  of  cases  that

were  closed.  Depending  on  the  court,  case  conclusion  is

cases  are  “terminated,”  in  the  Oregon  Tax  Court,  cases  are

“closed.”  Although  all  cases  filed  in  the  Oregon  Court  of

Appeals  and  the  Oregon  Supreme  Court  are  reviewed,  only

certain  cases  warrant  written  opinions.

Oregon  Supreme  Court.  Cases  filed  in  the  Oregon  Supreme

Court originate from Appellate Court decisions and other case

types  that  require  mandatory  review.  All  cases  that  are  filed

with  the  court  are  reviewed,  but  only  mandatory  cases  and

cases  that  pose  important  questions  for  adjudication  are

considered  for  written  opinions.  Over  the  last  six  years,  the

Oregon  Supreme  Court  has  averaged  1,159  filings  and  79

opinions per year. During calendar year 2008, there were 1,352

cases  filed  and  75  opinions  issued.

Oregon Court of Appeals. Over the past six years, the Oregon

Court  of  Appeals  has  averaged  3,450  filings  per  year.  Of  the

3,450  filings,  the  Oregon  Court  of  Appeals  has  averaged  392

opinions  per  year.  In  2008,  the  Oregon  Court  of  Appeals

accepted 3,220 filings and issued 436 opinions. The 10 Oregon

Appellate  Court  judges  consider  cases  in  panels  of  three

voting  judges  and  the  Chief  Judge  who  sits  as  a  non-voting

member.

Oregon Tax Court. Oregon Tax Court has averaged 1,104 case

filings per year and closed an average of 1,251 cases. In 2008,

1,307  cases  were  filed  and  1,011  cases  were  closed.  Cases

can  be  considered  by  one  of  the  three  magistrates  in  the

Magistrate  Division  by  informal  hearing,  or  by  the  Regular

Division’s  Tax  Court  Judge  through  formal  court  proceedings.

Oregon  Circuit  Courts.  Of  the  Oregon  Judicial  Department’s

four courts, the Oregon Circuit Courts process the most cases.

Over the past six years, Oregon Circuit Courts have averaged

615,674  case  filings  per  year.  The  173  Oregon  Circuit  Court

judges have terminated an average of 625,992 cases a year.

In  2008,  610,334  cases  were  filled  and  633,392  cases  were

terminated.

Oregon Circuit Courts -
Snapshots

The  Oregon  state  court  system  has  one  “general”  jurisdiction

trial court level – the circuit court. “General” jurisdiction means

that it can hear all types of cases that state law defines, other

than  tax  issues.  These  courts  hear  all  types  of  cases  ranging

from  small  claims,  to  juvenile  delinquency/dependency,  to

property crimes, to felonies and misdemeanors. A few judicial

districts  include  more  than  one  county;  however  there  is  a

circuit court for each county. Each circuit court has a presiding

judge  who  is  the  senior  administrative  authority  and  a  Trial

Court  Administrator  who  manages  day-to-day  operations.

2008  provided  Jackson  County  Circuit  Court  with  an

opportunity  to  pilot  a  Facilitation  User  Satisfaction  Survey.  This

anonymous questionnaire was given to individuals who sought

assistance  from  the  facilitation  program  to  survey  their

satisfaction level of services received. As a result of the survey,

the  court  increased  its  hours  of  operation  for  the  facilitation

program  to  Monday  through  Friday,  8:00  a.m.  to  5:00  p.m.

and  availability  during  the  noon  hour.

As one of the four pilot sites for Oregon eCourt, Jackson County

Circuit  Court  began  internal  preparation  efforts.  The  court

assembled  a  local  court  readiness  team,  reorganized  the

administrative  structure  of  the  court  and  work  units,  and

created  two  technology  training  labs.

The  court  played  a  significant  role  in  the  application  and

receipt of a five year grant to improve services and outcomes

for  dependent  children  and  families.  This  grant  provides

resources  to  assist  in:  the  decrease  in  the  number  of  children

placed  in  foster  care;  reduction  of  time  spent  in  foster  care;

an increase in reunification rates; a decrease in re-entry rates;

and an increase in long term outcomes for dependent children.

have closed with an average time to disposition of six months.

Resolution of cases in an average of six months after assignment

is  a  notable  achievement,  given  the  complexity  of  the  issues

involved.  The  court  hopes  to  reach  out  to  judges  and  parties

in other counties and expand this successful model by providing

access  to  this  specialized  resource.

The  court  is  collaborating  with  its  public  safety  partners  on

two  projects  to  improve  criminal  caseflow  management.  The

first  project  is  the  Defendant  Offender  Management  Center,

which  performs  risk  assessments  on  every  individual  brought

into the local jail to determine suitability for pre-trial release or

housing. The Center has become increasingly important since

loss of Federal Timber Revenue has dramatically reduced the

number  of  available  jail  beds.

The second project is the court’s early dispute resolution process

for  criminal  cases.  This  intensive  pre-trial  and  negotiation

process  occurs  at  a  hearing  held  35  days  after  arraignment.

At the hearing, pleas are taken on settled pre-trial cases. Cases

that  are  not  settled  are  assigned  to  a  judge  for  a  settlement

conference  conducted  later  that  day.  Cases  not  settled  at

the settlement are set for trials to occur within 45-60 days.

To facilitate mediation efforts and move cases toward a more

prompt  resolution,  Marion  County  Circuit  Court  has

implemented  a  new  orientation  program  for  parties  involved

in  child  custody  cases.  In  cases  involving  unrepresented

litigants a track of processing and hearings has been initiated

to  encourage  settlement  efforts.

The  Marion  County  Courthouse  is  still  under  renovation  after

a  November  2005  security  incident.  Some  court  services  will

continue  to  be  displaced  for  another  year  or  more  due  to

numerous structural issues. The court is also pursuing courtroom

technological  installations  and  upgrades  which  will  enhance

audio/video  recordings,  provide  an  upgraded  system  for

evidence  presentation  technology,  and  other  capabilities  as

the  court  moves  forward  toward  a  more  stable  electronic

environment.

During  2008,  the  Multnomah  County  Circuit  Court  broke  the

one  million  mark  on  eFiling  of  parking  citations.  In  addition,

the court electronically filed over 150,000 traffic violations since

the program began in 2006. In traffic cases the court maintains

only  an  electronic  case  file;  there  is  no  longer  a  paper  case

file  for  these  offenses.

The  court  received  a  grant  to  establish  a  pilot  mental  health

court.  The  program  is  designed  for  a  capacity  of  75  chronic,

low level offenders diagnosed with a mental illness. Offenders

who  successfully  complete  the  program  avoid  jail  sanctions

and,  in  some  cases,  conviction.  The  mental  health  court  is

staffed  with  a  judge,  a  qualified  mental  health  professional,

and  two  qualified  mental  health  associates.

In  2008,  Multnomah  County’s  Task  Force  on  Civil  Jury  Trial

Practices published Recommended Practices for Civil Jury Trials

in  Multnomah  County  Circuit  Court.  This  document  was

created through the efforts of several circuit judges and local

attorneys.  Available  on  the  court’s  website,  the  document  is

intended  to  assist  attorneys  and  self-represented  parties

appearing  in  civil  jury  trials.

The  court  continues  to  look  for  new  and  innovative  ways  to

conduct business and has now scanned over 1.12 million pages

of  juvenile  files  into  a  document  imaging  system.  The  system

offers electronic search and retrieval tools that enable juvenile

and  family  court  judges  to  access  reports,  or  parts  of  reports

that are critical for upcoming hearings. This process decreases

the transport of large files, provides a more efficient way for a

judge  to  search  for  critical  information  within  a  file,  and

forecasts  the  benefits  of  a  fully  functional  electronic  court

system.

In 2008, Clackamas County Circuit Court began to use SCRAM

(Secure  Continuous  Remote  Alcohol  Monitor)  technology  for

the DUII Court program. Participants of the DUII Court program

are required to wear an ankle bracelet that continuously tests

for  alcohol  use  and  monitors  their  location.  Previously,  sheriff

deputies  made  random  surprise  visits  with  breathalyzers  to

program  participant’s  homes  but  this  did  not  provide  24/7

coverage.  This  change  to  the  program  has  been  highly

successful.

The  court  has  fully  implemented  a  computerized  case  file

tracking system. This system uses hand-held devices to scan a

bar code on a case file jacket and find its location within the

courthouse. This saves staff time and resources and has resulted

in  fewer  lost  files.

In  April  2008,  the  court  added  three  new  collection  staff  to

their  restitution  court  team.  These  individuals  were  added  to

the  team  to  increase  collections  by  integrating  sensitive

identification  and  person  tracking  tools  which  are  normally

only  available  to  vendors,  into  the  program.    Since  the

establishment  of  the  restitution  court,  court  collections  have

increased  by  80%.

In  2008,  the  Sixth  Judicial  District  became  part  of  the  Eastern

Oregon  Revenue  Recovery  Unit,  which  provides  enhanced

collection  of  defaulted  court  fees,  fines,  and  restitution

obligations.  In  addition,  Umatilla  County  Circuit  Court  has

partnered with community corrections to start a restitution court

docket to help improve the rate of recovery on court-ordered

restitution.

The  Umatilla  County  Circuit  Court  provided  training  and

support to Jefferson County Circuit Court, on the use of video

technology  to  process  petitions  for  post-conviction  relief  and

habeas  corpus  cases.  Umatilla  County  agencies  continue  to

benefit  from  the  reductions  in  inmate  transportation  costs

through  the  use  of  this  technology.

Umatilla  County  Circuit  Court  has  extended  its  use  of

technology  by  scanning  all  documents  related  to  Pendleton

26

criminal  cases  into  a  digital  format  that  can  be  viewed  by

judges from their computers. The system permits more efficient

use of judicial resources by assigning short hearings to a judge

at  the  court’s  Hermiston  location,  while  the  defendant  and

the  hard  copy  file  remain  in  Pendleton.  The  court,  county,

and general public have seen a savings in staff time, defendant

travel,  and  other  accrued  benefits.

The  Seventh  Judicial  District,  which  is  comprised  of  five

counties,  continues  its  work  to  improve  their  family  law

facilitation  program.  The  court  strives  to  make  certified

interpreters  more  readily  available  to  all  non-English  speaking

litigants  and  to  increase  the  pool  of  qualified  domestic

relations  interpreters.

The district has improved its simultaneous television transmission

system  (video  court)  which  benefits  the  courts  and  all

communities.  Through  the  use  of  the  system,  inmate

transportation  costs  have  been  reduced  and  court  security

has  improved.

A  Dependency  Drug  Court  has  been  added  to  the  Wasco

County  Circuit  Court.  The  Dependency  Drug  Court

supplements the work that is being done by the existing adult

drug  courts  in  Hood  River  and  Wasco  Counties.

Baker County Circuit Court, with the support and efforts of the

presiding  judge  and  a  team  of  counselors,  attorneys,  and

probation  officers,  has  added  a  juvenile  drug  court  program

to  its  existing  adult  drug  court  program.  Baker  County  has

had  an  adult  drug  court  program  since  2004,  prompting  the

development  of  a  similar  program  for  juveniles.  Through  New

Directions  Northwest,  who  contributed  a  $5,000  grant  from

the  Oregon  Community  Foundation,  the  court  began  its  first

juvenile  drug  court  sessions  in  October  2008.  The  drug  court

team members have combined the name of these programs

into Journeys – Baker County Family Recovery Court. The word

Journeys  is  an  acronym  that  provides  the  participants  with

details of the program’s expectations. A new Treatment Court

Specialist  was  hired  to  work  exclusively  on  the  county’s  two

drug  court  programs.

A  new  Mental  Health  Court  is  available  for  non-violent  circuit

court  defendants  who  suffer  from  chronic  mental  illness.  As  a

probation  requirement,  up  to  10  individuals  participate  in  the

program following a referral from the District Attorney’s Office

or  a  probation  officer.

In  2008,  Malheur  County  Circuit  Court  participated  in  two

regional projects affecting eight Eastern Oregon counties:  the

Eastern  Oregon  Revenue  Recovery  Unit,  which  has  improved

collection amounts of defaulted court fees, fines, and restitution

obligations; and the Eastern Oregon Technical Support Project,

which  provides  daily  technical  support  to  all  eight  counties.

The  10th  Judicial  District  has  two  adult  and  two  juvenile  drug

courts  that  provide  treatment  opportunities  for  offenders

addicted  to  drugs  and  who  are  motivated  to  change  their

lives.  Graduate  success  rates  are  measured  at  84%,  with  no

new  misdemeanors  or  felony  charges  within  one  year  of

graduation.  The  district  hopes  to  expand  its  adult  drug  court

programs to include an alcohol treatment program for persons

convicted of their second or third charge of driving under the

influence  of  intoxicants  (DUII).

On August 13, 2008, Chief Justice Paul De Muniz met with the

Union  County  Board  of  Commissioners  regarding  the

inadequacy  of  the  county’s  court  facilities.  Low  ceilings  and

wide pillars make the courtrooms unsuitable, and the building

lacks  user-friendly  access  to  its  various  offices.  The  board  has

appointed a local commission on court facilities to investigate

options  for  funding  a  new  courthouse.

Deschutes County Circuit Court has started to prepare judges

and staff for the eventual change from a paper-based system

to  an  electronic  content  management  (ECM)  system.

Conversion  to  ECM  will  require  that  all  court  documents  be

scanned  into  digital  format;  updates  and  revisions  are  made

to  the  court  website;  a  room  be  prepared  for  the  public  to

access electronic case files from a computer kiosk. These are

just some of the steps which are continually being modified in

preparation for the statewide electronic court system, Oregon

eCourt.

The  court  continues  its  involvement  with  the  local  community

by participating in discussions with the county on: the addition

of  a  courtroom/staff  work  area  at  the  newly  remodeled  jail;

addressing  the  improvement  of  court  security  and  business

continuity operations; and continuing to work closely with the

county  and  state  in  the  effort  to  identify  current  space

allocation  and  needs  of  court  facilities.

In 2008, the court implemented an electronic jury callout system

that has been integrated into the Voice Over Internet Protocol

(VOIP)  phone  system.  The  auto-dialer  enables  the  phone

system to automatically dial out to the juror’s home phone to

let  them  know  if  they  should  report  for  jury  duty  the  following

day.

The  Polk  County  Circuit  Court,  various  community  partners,

and  other  government  agencies  have  continued  their

collaboration  and  successfully  maintained  the  Drug  Court

Treatment Program. Requirements of the 12–18 month treatment

program  include  participant  completion  of  three  treatment

phases  involving  frequent  court  appearances,  random  drug

testing,  as  well  as  group  and  individual  counseling.  Through

the  assistance  of  two  Criminal  Justice  Commission  grants

received  between  2007  and  2008,  the  program  was  able  to

increase its capacity to accomodate 25 participants at a time.

To  date,  14  individuals  have  graduated  from  the  program.

Polk  County  Circuit  Court’s  Family  Facilitation  Program  offers

self-help  assistance  to  families  and  individuals  involved  in

Judicial District: 13

County:  Klamath

domestic  relations  cases.  In  June  of  2008,  the  program

expanded,  adding  a  dedicated  part-time    facilitator  to  assist

those needing help with legal issues such as divorce, custody,

mediation,  restraining  orders,  modifications,  and  other  crises.

During  2008,  Klamath  County  Circuit  Court  focused  on

strengthening  and  expanding  its  existing  specialty  programs,

including  an  adult  drug  court  that  serves  offenders  addicted

to  drugs;  a  Youth  Success  Project  that  provides  treatment  to

youth  with  substance  abuse  issues;  a  family  court  that  offers

treatment to families with multiple matters before the court; a

School Expulsion Diversion Program that presents an alternative

for  students  facing  expulsion  for  bringing  weapons  or  drugs

into  schools;  a  Tribal  Delinquency  Cooperative  Project  that

coordinates  culturally  tailored  services  for  tribal  youth;  and  a

Truancy  Prevention  Project,  designed  to  encourage  students

to  attend  school  regularly.

Klamath  County  Circuit  Court’s  family  facilitation  program

offers  self-help  assistance  to  families  and  individuals  involved

in  domestic  relations  cases.  Because  the  demand  for  these

services  is  high,  and  facilitation  staff  is  limited,  the  court

developed  a  series  of  group  workshops  to  reduce  the  wait

time  for  individuals  seeking  assistance  with  divorce  and  in-

custody  without  marriage  paperwork.

The  court  has  found  that  mediation  seems  to  be  particularly

effective  in  helping  small  claims  litigants  resolve  their

differences.  Since  there  is  no  formal  mediation  organization

in the community, the court sent a number of its own staff to

mediation  training  who  are  now  available  two  days  a  week

to assist the parties before they are scheduled for trial.

Josephine County Circuit Court continues to play a significant

role  in  its  community  through  various  outreach  efforts.  During

2008, through a partnership with the Josephine County Board

of  Commissioners,  drug  court  graduations  were  broadcast

live on local public access television, to allow the community

to  share  in  the  program’s  achievements.  To  date,  233

individuals  have  graduated  from  the  program  and  19  babies

have been born drug-free to mothers who participated in the

program.

Picture Justice, a successful outreach program, was instituted

in  2008  by  the  court.  Two  fourth  grade  classes  from  a  local

elementary school were invited to participate in a tour of the

courthouse, followed by a presentation made by the presiding

judge. The students were given a lesson in courtroom etiquette,

the  branches  of  government,  the  symbolism  of  Lady  Justice,

and  participated  in  a  brief  mock  trial.

The court’s administrative team participated in a goal setting

exercise that resulted in the development of 11 targeted court

improvements, which include court security, staff development,

jury 

improvements,  and  community  outreach.  The

administrative  team  will  work  in  partnership  with  staff  to

strategize how the court can achieve these goals and continue

to  provide  a  positive  court  experience  for  the  community.

Coos County Circuit Court and its community partners initiated

the  Zero-to-Three  Treatment  Court.  The  program  is  a

collaborative  pilot  project  that  applies  research  to  court

practices  to  improve  outcomes  for  infants,  toddlers,  and

families  involved  in  the  child  welfare  system.  It  uses  existing

community  resources  to  provide  a  variety  of  wrap-around

services for the entire family. The program provides consistency

for  participants  with  one  judge,  one  caseworker,  and  the

dedicated  people  who  provide  resource  services,  which  has

proven very effective for the five pilot families in the program.

This  early  success  for  the  five  pilot  families  has  resulted  in  an

agreement  to  expand  the  program  for  up  to  10  families  at  a

time.

programs  to  meet  community  needs.  The  court’s  Domestic

Violence  Court  Program  provides  education,  support,  and

an accountability system to perpetrators of domestic violence,

giving  them  the  skills  to  make  positive  changes  and  good

choices  for  themselves  and  their  loved  ones.    The  program

has  had  26  successful  graduates.

The  court  has  been  able  to  maintain  its  Adult  Guardianship/

Conservatorship  Mediation  Program  and  on-staff  mediation

coordinator.    This  program  provides  mediation  in  adult

guardianship  and  conservatorship  cases  at  no  charge  to  the

parties.  Approximately  55%  of  cases  that  are  mediated  result

in  a  mutual  agreement,  which  provides  the  parties  an

alternative  to  the  expense  and  emotional  stress  of  going  to

trial.  This  is  a  huge  savings  of  time  and  expense  to  the  court

and  the  parties  report  high  satisfaction  with  this  process.

cases involving certain misdemeanors and lesser felonies, and

has  significantly  improved  the  percentage  of  cases  resolved

at  or  within  two  weeks  after  arraignment.  The  program  has

provided cost savings for the court, the District Attorney’s Office,

public  defense  service  providers,  and  has  reduced

Benton  County  treatment  courts  received  two  new  grants,

administered by the county health department, which expand

the availability of treatment services for participants. The grant

from  Zonta  International  provides  resources  for  female

participants  to  complete  their  GEDs.  Expanded  housing,

residential treatment, drug testing, and mental health services

are  resources  available  to  all  participants  through  Good

Samaritan  Foundation  funds.

Crook  and  Jefferson  County  Courts  are  two  of  five  Oregon

actively  planning  for  the  rollout.  The  court  continues  to  raise

awareness  on  the  benefits  of  Oregon  eCourt  through

communication efforts targeted to those who routinely access

In preparation for Oregon eCourt, Harney County Circuit Court

hosted  public  outreach  forums  to  educate  the  local  legal

community  and  court  customers  on  the  benefits  and

advantages  of  a  statewide  electronic  courthouse.  The  court

Staff:  10

also  participated  in  a  statewide  effort  to  identify  new

workflows  and  business  processes  associated  with  doing

business electronically. Both Harney and Grant County Circuit

Courts  continued  their  efforts  to  scan  court  documents  into

digital  formats  which  will  eventually  provide  the  public  online

access  to  court  records.

Eastern  Oregon  circuit  courts  have  embarked  on  two  new

regional efforts. The first is an Eastern Oregon regional technical

support  group  that  provides  daily  technical  support  to  the

small Eastern Oregon courts. The second is an Eastern Oregon

regional  collections  unit  that  benefits  Eastern  Oregon  courts

with  a  concentrated  focus  on  collection  efforts.

Grant County Circuit Court officially began their first drug court

in July 2008. It was established through the year long effort of

a  local  drug  court  team.  Harney  County  Circuit  Court  was

also able to start a drug court and continued further efforts to

assist  self-represented  litigants  through  facilitator  services,  as

well  as  provide  better  access  to  legal  information  and  court

forms.

Beginning in 2007, Yamhill County Circuit Court hosted a series

of meetings to develop a program which would increase the

collection  of  court-ordered  restitution  for  victims.  From  those

meetings, the court and its public safety partners conceived a

program  where  offenders  that  are  identified  as  needing

incentives  to  pay  their  debts,  make  monthly  appearances  in

court  allowing  judicial  monitoring  of  such  cases.  As  a  partner

of  the  project,  Yamhill  County  District  Attorney  Bradley  Berry

encouraged up-front payment of restitution to be included in

plea  negotiations.

In 2008, that effort alone has netted tens of thousands of dollars

for  victims.  The  program  collected  $238,154  during  its  first  full

year of operations. That is an increase of $103,836 or 77% over

the previous four year average. That amount does not include

collection of other fines and fees, or the amount collected by

the  district  attorney  during  plea  negotiations.

During 2008, Lake County Circuit Court focused on the training

and development of its staff. Of the five court employees, three

County:  Lake

were new hires and new to circuit court work in general. As a

result,  experienced  staff  carried  a  large  part  of  the  workload

during  the  period  of  training  for  the  new  employees.

The court began the process of changing its digital recording

system  from  CourtSmart™  to  ForTheRecord®  (FTR).  The  move

to FTR will be made in conjunction with Klamath County Circuit

Court,  which  will  be  adopting  the  same  system.

In  May  2008,  Chief  Justice  De  Muniz  was  welcomed  by  the

judge,  staff,  and  community,  when  he  provided  judicial

coverage  to  Lake  County  Circuit  Court.

service to the entire county. The court was closed on the day

of  the  storm,  but  was  able  to  reopen  the  following  day.

Through  the  experience  of  responding  to  this  particular

emergency, the court identified the need to develop additional

protocols  for  the  occurrence  of  similar  events,  and  designed

the  “court  in  a  box”  toolkit  that  allows  a  courtroom  to  be  set

up  in  alternative  locations.

In  2008,  the  court  continued  its  work  with  the  county  on

improvements to courthouse accessibility. Those improvements

include:  remodeled witness box and jury box to provide ease

of  access  to  persons  with  limited  mobility;  upgrades  to  the

audio system in the large courtroom to permit the participation

of  people  with  impaired  hearing;  using  video  conferencing

equipment to allow participants to appear in court by video;

and  a  new  ramp  to  provide  entry  access  to  the  building.
