WHEREAS, the 2021 Legislative assembly enacted Oregon Laws 2021, Chapter 643,

reduce the reliance on security release and provide statewide guidance for local pretrial release 
orders; and

135.233, requires the Presiding Judge of a judicial district shall enter a standing pretrial release 
order, specifying to the sheriff of the county, or to the entity supervising the local correctional

and the offenses that are: 

Subject to release on recognizance; 
Subject to release with special conditions of release; and  

a) 
b) 
c)  Not eligible for release until arraignment; and 

WHEREAS, in turn, the Chief Justice issued guidelines for Presiding Judge Orders.  

Additionally, the Chief Justice entered an Order that requires each Presiding Judge of a Circuit 
Court to enter a Pretrial Release Order as required under ORS 135.223(1) that complies with the 
guidelines established by the Chief Justice with an operative date of July 1, 2022.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
