T he Oregon Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals provide electronic filing and 

electronic payment services. Electronic filing (eFiling) allows members of the  Oregon 
State Bar, who are authorized to practice law in Oregon, to file documents and  to pay 
filing fees electronically. Benefits of eFiling for Oregon’s legal community include: 

■  File documents with the court 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, from any location 
with Internet access, except during regularly scheduled maintenance hours. 

■  Potential cost savings, including a reduction in production, photocopy, courier, 

and postage costs. 

■  Convenient, secure method to file documents and pay associated fees. 

■  Flexibility to file a document up to 11:59:59 p.m. in the time zone in which the 

court is located, on the date that the document is required to be filed. 

■  Reduce the risk of paper files being misplaced or lost. 

Attorneys must register online to obtain a user ID and password, and complete free 
online training prior to using the electronic filing system.

General Questions 

What is eFiling? 
Electronic filing otherwise known as eFiling allows authorized users to file a document with the court directly 
from a computer using the Internet. Electronic filing is available in both the Oregon Supreme Court and the 
Oregon Court of Appeals. 

 

 

 

How will eFiling benefit me? 
* File documents with the court 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, from any location with Internet  access, 
except during regularly scheduled maintenance hours. 
* Potential cost savings, including a reduction in production, photocopy, courier, and postage costs. 
* Convenient, secure method to file documents and pay associated fees. 
* Flexibility to file a document up to 11:59:59 p.m. in the time zone in which the court is located, on  the date 
that the document is required to be filed. You are encouraged, however, to eFile well in advance of that 
deadline to avoid potential problems. 
* Reduce the risk of paper files being delayed, misplaced, or lost by the courier or U.S. Postal Service. 

Is eFiling mandatory? 
Effective June 1, 2015, eFiling will be mandatory for active Oregon State Bar (OSB) members in the Oregon 
Supreme  Court  and  the  Oregon  Court  of  Appeals.  Active  OSB  members  will  be  required  to  eFile  in  the 
appellate courts on and after that date, unless a waiver is obtained or court rule allows conventional filing. 

Are there charges for using the eFiling system? 
Yes,  A  Document  Recovery  Charge  of  $.10/page,  multiplied  by  the  number  of  paper  copies  required  by  the 
court  may  be  imposed,  for  some  documents,  at  the  time  of  eFiling.  Please  review  the  Oregon  Rules  of 
Appellate Procedure and the document you are filing to determine the correct number of copies required. The 
charges apply to all eFilers. 

Are there procedural rules concerning eFiling? 
Chapter 16 of the Oregon Rules of Appellate Procedure (ORAP) governs electronic filing. Those rules are 
available online at: 

http://www.ojd.state.or.us/Web/OJDPublications.nsf/ORAP? OpenView&count=1000 

Do I need to register for eFiling in both the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court? 
No. You only need to register once. Your username and password will allow you to eFile in both courts. To 
eFile a case-initiating document, select the appropriate court; to eFile a document in an existing Supreme Court 
of Court of Appeals case, enter the case number. 

How do I change my contact information with the court? 
The Appellate Court Records Section automatically obtains attorney names and contact information, including 
the attorney’s email address, from the Oregon State Bar through a nightly data transfer. To ensure the accuracy 
of your contact information, you must notify the  Oregon State Bar of any change in your name, mailing address, 
email address, or other contact information. After the Bar has updated your email address, you must contact the 
OJD Help Desk in order to update the eFiling system itself. Note: There may be a delay of one to two business 
days between the date that the Oregon State Bar receives an attorney’s updated contact information and the 
date that the Bar data is transferred to the Appellate Court Records Section. See ORAP 16.10(2)(a)(v). 

Who can I contact if I have other questions? 
For general questions related to eFiling in the appellate courts, please email: appealsclerk@ojd.state.or.us 
For technical questions related to eFiling in the appellate courts, please e-mail: 
ETSDHelp@ojd.state.or.us

Technical questions 

What computer hardware and software is needed to participate in eFiling? 
You will need the following hardware and software to eFile documents with the appellate courts: 

*A standard operating system, such as Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, or Macintosh OS X. 
* An Internet service provider and a compatible browser that is JavaScript-enabled. (We officially certify our 
applications against Internet Explorer version 7 and above, and the most recent version of FireFox. Although we do 
not certify against Chrome or Safari, we are not aware of any issues related to those browsers. However, if you chose 
to use Chrome or Safari we cannot guarantee functionality.) For best viewing, set your monitor resolution to 1024 x 
768. 
* A current version of Portable Document Format (PDF) writer software, such as Adobe Acrobat, available at 
http://www.adobe.com/. 
* A PDF-compatible word processor, such as Corel WordPerfect or Microsoft Word. 
* A scanner to create text searchable PDF copies of documents, such as trial court orders and exhibits, which 
do not exist in an electronic format. 

When is technical support available for eFiling? 
The OJD’s Help Desk is available from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday (excluding court closure 
days), at (503) 986-5582. Please note that, while you may eFile 24 hours a day, OJD’s help desk is not 
available that entire time; please plan accordingly. For assistance with Records Office issues, contact the 
Appellate Records Office at (503) 986-5555, open from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, 
excluding court closure days. 

What are the regularly scheduled maintenance hours of the eFiling system? 
The eFiling system is available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, except for the following  regularly scheduled 
maintenance times: Mondays from 12:01 a.m. to 3:00 a.m.; and the last weekend of each month from Friday at 
6:00pm to Sunday at noon. 

How will I know if the eFiling system is not available? 
The OJD will post information about the availability of eFiling on its web site at: 
http://courts.oregon.gov/OJD/OnlineServices/eFile/pages/index.aspx 

What document format is accepted? 
Any original document submitted to the court, such as an initiating document, motion, or a brief, must be in a 
Portable Document Format (PDF) or Portable Document Format/A (PDF/A) and allow for text searching, 
copying, and pasting into another document. Each PDF or PDF/A document must not be larger than 25 
megabytes. All eFiled PDF or PDF/A documents must follow  the same format as paper documents, as set out 
in ORAP 16.15. 

How do I become an authorized user? 
To become an authorized user, you must: 
* Be an active member of the Oregon State Bar (OSB) and be authorized to practice law in Oregon; 
* Have a valid email address on file with the OSB; 
* Register with OJD to obtain a user ID and password; and 
* Complete a free, online training. 

For more information on registration requirements, see ORAP 16.10.

How will I know if I have successfully registered for eFiling? 
After completing the registration process, you will receive an e-mail confirming your registration. 

Will my password expire? 
Yes. Your eFiling system password will expire every 180 days. To reset your password, use the password reset 
link located on the log in page. 
To avoid technical difficulty, ensure that your password complies with the following password rules. Your 
password must: 

-Be at least seven characters long 
-Contain at least one non-alphanumeric  character 

Note: If there are five failed logon attempts within 10 minutes, the account will be locked. 

How do I change my eFiling password? 

You can reset your password online at the following location: 
http://appellate.courts.oregon.gov/ 

How can I obtain my user name if I forget it? 
Your user name is your Oregon State Bar number. 

eFiling Questions 

How will I know if I have successfully eFiled a document? 

During the eFiling process, you will receive two emails. The first email will confirm receipt of the electronic filing. 
The second email will notify you that your electronic filing was accepted by the Appellate Court Records Office. 
These emails will be sent from appellaterecords@ojd.state.or.us. Please ensure that your e-mail spam filters do 
not block this email address. When your document is accepted, be sure to check for any comments posted to your 
filing by the Appellate Court Records Office, which will appear in the body of the email. 

What should I do if I have not received a confirmation email after completing the  registration process 
and submitting electronic files? 
Prior to calling OJD’s help desk, please verify that the email isn’t in your spam filter. If this is not the problem, 
please contact OJDs Help Desk at (503) 986-5582, available from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, 
excluding court closure days. 

What should I do if I cannot convert my exhibit to a PDF? 
Oversized or demonstrative exhibits must be conventionally filed. You should note in the “comments” box on 
the eFiling page that such materials will be conventionally filed. Conventional filings related to eFilings do not 
require a separate proof of service, as long as the eFiled proof of service lists the conventionally filed 
document. You must conventionally file the required number of copies of the oversized or demonstrative exhibit 
documents with the Appellate Court Records office. See ORAP 16.30. 

Can eFilers be electronically served using the eFiling system? 
Yes. Electronic service is available for documents filed using the eFiling system in already-existing cases but 
only for other registered eFilers. Electronic Service is not allowed for case-initiating documents. You musts 
serve others via conventional service. Our system has a feature that permits an eFiler to view the eFiling 
status of other parties or attorneys on the case, to determine who may be eServed. See ORAP 16.45 
(outlining the procedures governing eService). 

If there is a technical problem with the eFiling system, how will it affect the timeliness of my  filing? 
If a technical problem with the eFiling system prevents the court from receiving an eFiling, the court may, 
upon satisfactory proof, permit the filing date of the document to relate back to the date you first attempted to 

 

 

 

 

file the document electronically. Problems with your equipment, hardware or software, or other problems 
within your control generally will not excuse an untimely filing. See  ORAP 16.25(4). 

Will paralegals or legal secretaries be able to eFile and/or receive system notices? 
Paralegals and legal secretaries will be able to electronically file documents using the user name and 
password of the attorney for whom they are filing. Only attorneys will be issued user names and passwords. 
See ORAP 16.10. All emails from the court are automatically sent to the registered attorney’s email address 
that is on file with the Oregon State Bar. An eFiling attorney may elect to have a staff person copied on email 
relating to eFilings submitted by that attorney; however, the election must be made separately on each eFiling 
transaction, and the option is not available regarding receipt of eService email. Some email systems can be 
adjusted so that email from a particular source automatically will be forwarded to another person in the office. 
Users who would like their court email to be directed to another person in their office should determine if their 
email systems have that functionality. 

How will document signatures be handled for eFilings? 
Generally, the user name and password required to submit documents to the eFiling system will constitute the 
signature of the eFiler for purposes of court rules. In addition, eFiled documents must include a signature 
block with the printed name of the eFiler, preceded by an “s/” (e.g., “s/ John Q. Attorney”), the eFiler's address, 
and telephone number. An attorney must include his or her bar number. Stipulated eFiled documents, 
affidavits, and declarations have different requirements. Please note that some signature block stamps add 
additional security layers to the document which then prevents all or part of the document from being copied 
and pasted; thus the document no longer complies with ORAP 16.15(1). See ORAP 16.40. 

How long will it take for my eFiling to be confirmed by the court? 
All electronic filings will be reviewed as soon as practically possible, depending on court workload,  staffing, and 
whether the court is closed for a weekend or court holiday. Electronic filings will not be given priority over filings 
accepted via mail or in-person. 

When are documents considered filed by the court? 
Please distinguish among “received,” “accepted,” and “filed”. A document will be considered submitted for 
filing when the document is received by the eFiling  system. When the court staff person accepts the document 
for filing, the date and time of filing entered in the register will relate back to the date and time that the 
document was received by the eFiling system, and the eFiling system will affix a stamp to the document 
indicating the file date. See ORAP 16.25. Although the court will consider documents filed at 11:59 p.m. on the 
document due date to be timely, eFilers are encouraged to file documents well before that time to avoid 
potential  problems. 

What should I do if I need to file a corrected brief or other corrected document? 
If you need to eFile a corrected brief or other document due to errors or deficiencies in the original  eFiled brief 
or other document, please select the actual document name as the document  type and subtype, and make sure 
to check the “amended” box. When you upload the corrected document, you must include the entire corrected 
document, even if you are correcting only one page. In the comments box on the eFiling page on which you 
upload the document, please note that the document is a corrected version of an earlier eFiled  document. 
Please be specific in the comments box as to what you are correcting. 

Appendix B Navigation Menu Overview 

My eFilings 

This page is the first page that you will see upon logging in to the eFiling application. From this 
“dashboard,” you can begin the eFiling process for a new case or begin the eFiling process for an 
existing case, or you can review previous activities on the eFiling site. There are links located on 
the left-hand navigation bar. You can click those links from any page in the eFiling application to 
access the dashboard page or from one of the pages describing previous eFiling activities. 

         

 

Draft eFilings 

If you are unable to complete the eFiling process, you may save your progress as a draft, before 

submitting the eFiling to court. This is done by clicking the “Save as Draft” button. Note that, in 
order to use the “Save as Draft” function, you must reach this point in the eFiling process. If you 
stop before you reach this page, your work will not be saved. 

 

The drafts that have been saved can be accessed by clicking the “Draft Filings” link on 
the left-hand navigation bar. To review, edit or continue a draft eFiling, click on the “Edit” 
link next to the document that you wish to review. Clicking on the edit link will bring you 

back to the summary page, set out on the previous page. If you wish to remove the drafts 
that are saved, click the “Remove” link next to the document that you wish to remove. 

     

Pending Filings 

The “Pending Filings” screen lists the electronic filings that you have submitted to the court, but 
have not been reviewed by the records office. When the records office reviews a pending filing, 
they move into either the “Rejected Filings” category or the “Accepted Filings” category. 

   

Rejected Filings 

The “Rejected Filings” screen shows eFilings that the Appellate Court Records Office has 
reviewed and rejected. A reason for rejection is included on this page. In addition to appearing on 
this page, the system generates an e-mail to inform you that your eFiling was rejected. Generally, 
the Appellate Court Records Office will only reject eFilings in rare circumstances, such as an eFiler 
submitting vacation photographs instead of the document meant to be eFiled. If your document is 
deficient in some way (for example, if it is missing a proof of service), the Appellate Court Records 
Office will accept the document and electronically send you a Notice of Deficiency explaining the 
necessary corrections to be made. 

       

Accepted Filings 

The “Accepted Filings” page is a list of all of your eFilings that have been reviewed and accepted 
by the Appellate Court Records office. The information is listed in reverse chronological order and 
includes case number, filing type/subtype, filing date, and confirmation and transaction numbers. 
Because this list may grow very large over time, you have the option of searching by filing date 
range or confirmation number. 

       

Clicking on the Details link brings up the summary page for the accepted eFiling. 

           

Error Filings 

The “Error Filings” screen lists any eFilings that have not been completed due to an error 

somewhere in the eFiling process. This screen includes a description of the error. If your 
document is sent to the error queue, you must eFile the document again. Documents in the 
error queue cannot be viewed or accepted by the Appellate Court Records office.
