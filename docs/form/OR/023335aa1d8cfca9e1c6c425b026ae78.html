      <pre>REMOTE SERVICE DELIVERY 
DRAFT REPORT OF THE FUTURES COMMITTEE 
TO STATEWIDE FAMILY LAW ADVISORY COMMITTEE (SFLAC) 
SEPTEMBER 7, 2018 

UTURES COMMITTEE PARTICIPANTS:  Bill Howe, Chair; Stephen Adams, Colleen 

Carter-Cox, Jodi Harvey, Linda Hukari, Judge Karrie McIntyre, Bryan Marsh, OJD staff 

FLAC CHARGE TO FUTURES COMMITTEE: 

regon courts continue to struggle to deal with the burden of a very large and growing number 
of self-represented litigants (SRLs).  This is most problematic in family law where approximately 
80% of cases have at least one SRL.   Many litigants who self-represent cannot afford legal 
representation, though there is a significant minority who choose to self-represent even though 
they could afford an attorney.   Many self-represented litigants underestimate the complexities 
of navigating the court system without legal counsel. 

egardless whether self-representation is out of necessity or choice, it imposes a significant 
challenge for judges and the court system to manage these cases. This is  an access to justice 
issue.  Without some assistance, most SRLs cannot successfully navigate the court system, and 
unfair outcomes become far more likely.  The societal cost of inappropriate outcomes in family 
law matters, particularly those involving children, is huge. 

regon has sought to assist SRLs by offering an increasingly robust library of forms and written 
instructions which are available at little or no cost, by offering courthouse facilitation programs 
and other innovations such as the informal domestic relations trial procedure with relaxed 
evidentiary rules.  

he most effective assistance program for SRLs is the courthouse facilitation program.  Thirty-

four of Oregon’s thirty-six counties provide courthouse facilitation services1.    However, the 
level of facilitation services across the state varies greatly; some counties share facilitation 
services and have very limited hours.  Lincoln County, for example, offers facilitation services 
only on Fridays and Polk County only on Wednesdays.  See Attachment 1: Summary of 
Facilitation Services.   Further, even where robust facilitation programs are offered, accessing 
services commonly requires a trip to the courthouse and often entails a long wait for assistance.  
As a result, those who live a significant distance from the courthouse without adequate 
transportation, or those with small children or disabilities that make travel challenging, cannot 
effectively access facilitation services. 

o provide better access to justice for SRLs, several jurisdictions in the U. S. have devised 

programs that can take advantage of sophisticated remote communication technology. 
      
The Futures Committee investigated the possibility of providing remote family court facilitation 
services in Oregon.  We studied those programs that have a strong virtual component to their

services because we do not want  to replace local courthouse facilitation programs.  Instead, the 
goal is for remote services to complement local facilitation programs by being accessible to those 
who cannot easily access facilitation in a county courthouse. 
      
The Futures Committee has investigated different models of remote services and has developed 
recommendations based on our findings.   

UTURES COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION TO THE SFLAC: 

he Futures Committee strongly urges the creation of a centralized remote access program to 
deliver legal information and greater access to justice to family law litigants initially, and later 
expand to include other areas of law.   

his remote access program should be designed and function to supplement, not replace, 

Oregon’s current courthouse facilitation programs.  The goal of the remote delivery of services is 
to expand the reach of facilitation services by allowing litigants to access legal information by 
interacting with trained personnel through email, phone and multiple other modalities.  A 
remote access service will provide access to justice for both those who do not have access to 
courthouse facilitators and to those who, for whatever reason, prefer a remote access portal to 
obtain the assistance that they need.  Providing for remote access will increase the efficiency of 
the current facilitation programs by serving those litigants who do not need or desire in-person 
service, freeing facilitators to give in-person assistance to more litigants .   

he policy goals achieved by instituting remote access service include: 

   
1.       Generate fairer outcomes and judicial efficiency by enabling self-represented litigants to 
become more fully informed about the judicial process and court procedures relevant to their 
concerns. 
2.       Promote access to justice by serving the customers of judicial services in the manner best 
suited to their needs and wishes. 

ACKGROUND OF FUTURES COMMITTEE STUDY: 

he subcommittee was initially informed by the comprehensive report “Serving Self-

Represented Litigants Remotely: A Resource Guide” (SRLN 2016) by John Greacen.  This guide 
discusses the programs in Alaska, California, Idaho, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana and Utah.  
It became apparent from this report and early investigations that the early groundwork was laid 
by the courts in Australia and then in the U.S. by the State of Alaska.  The Alaska remote services 
program, pioneered by Stacey Marz, has been the inspiration and model for many other states’ 
programs.  Therefore, it seemed natural that our first investigations would be into Alaska and 
then to other jurisdictions that were influenced by that very successful program.  Some 
programs were not only influenced by Alaska’s, they were begun by people who had worked in 
the Alaska system. 

     After researching and considering the many programs throughout the states, we reached out 
to seven and interviewed the directors of those programs.  We then narrowed our consideration

Remote Services Delivery Report pg. 3 

to the five programs that seemed most successful and which seemed to offer the most guidance 
to crafting a remote access program for Oregon.  Various committee members had further 
discussions with representatives of these program and the following personal site visits were 
made:  Alaska - Colleen and Jodi; Minnesota - Judge McIntyre; Northern California - Stephen; 
Orange County, California - Linda; and Utah - Bryan.  Detailed reports of these site visits are 
attached.  We did not visit Idaho and Montana because their programs are not fully developed, 
nor Maryland because its program is beyond the scope of what we contemplate for Oregon. 

UMMARY OF SITE VISITS:  Note - compete surveys of site visits are attached. 

ALASKA 

Alaska is the prototype for most of the remote delivery programs in the country.  Stacey Marz is 
the pioneering founder of the program.  Under her direction is a system that serves the 
widespread and often remote population of Alaska in family law matters.  Alaska helps self-
represented litigants via a centralized phone-based system.  This was considered the best means 
for the following reasons: 

Centralized system allows for far better quality control, staff training and staff 
support 
Providing information by phone or email eliminates the security concerns of in-
person consultation 
Staff burnout has been virtually eliminated.  They found that it was far less stressful 
for staff to work with customers on the phone than to endure the intense emotions 
these cases generate face to face.  Staff also has the opportunity to consult with other 
staff if they have a question or concern about how to proceed and can recess then 
later call back the customer if the communication becomes too intense. 
This model allows for anonymity (though most choose to identify themselves) 
Customers increasingly expect on-line delivery of information 
Cost effective in that it is far less expensive than in person service 
Customers overwhelming like it 
Provides efficient access to information for those with disabilities, small children, 
travel challenges and the like 
Remote access was critical in Alaska since many areas are inaccessible by road.  In 
many areas of the state the delivery of in-person facilitation would be impossible. 

CALIFORNIA NORTH 

The key components from Northern California for Oregon System are:  

Funding: 
o  Use 4D reimbursement   
o  Grant applications   
o  Funding from districts through data showing cost savings   
Location and Oversight:  FLF office in courthouse 
Staff: 
o  Attorney manager

CALIFORNIA ORANGE COUNTY 

The Orange County program is funded primarily by the court, but also through a State grant.  It 
has five locations in the county.  The program is managed by an attorney.  Each location is 
staffed by attorneys (who act as site supervisors), paralegals and clerical staff. 

hey offer a continuum of services, remote, walk-in, document reviews, judicial referrals from 

courtrooms.  They also support a number of Family Law self-help calendars.  They hold 
workshops in multiple languages both remotely and in person.  The Manager and Senior 
Attorney also serve as Family Law Temporary Judges as needed for procedural calendars.  In 
2017 they served 132,000 SRLs in person and over 120,000 remotely.   

tems for Oregon to consider: 

A robust web site is essential to a successful self-help center  
Develop one to two-minute videos a month on a specific topic and post to YouTube 
Looking at online classes, Facebook Live- that type of service takes a lot of time 
Provide telephone assistance, no option to leave a message 
Use law school students as interns  
84% of the family law cases are self-represented on at least one side     
Have good statistics and data gathering, “Data is money” 

MINNESOTA 

Minnesota has a consolidated Court system with budgeting addressed with a statewide Judicial 
Branch budget. They currently use Tyler Odyssey and have very similar court procedures to 
Oregon. Like Oregon they have a primary population center and remote rural counties who have

significantly less court activity.   They began their program based on Alaska but immediately 
recognized it was beneficial to have it complement the in-person services they offered.  They 
have strong web-based resources and staff who are intimately familiar with online resources.  
They have a substantial form bank and remote computer viewing to allow staff to work with 
people on filling out forms.  Staff assist callers via phone, remote computer viewing and follow 
up emails.  Many callers are referred to in-person facilitation in Judicial Districts that offer it.  
Minnesota staff provided significant start up advice and indicated a willingness to assist us in 
the future in the event we have questions.   
 

UTAH     

Utah presents a situation similar to Oregon in that, like the Willamette Valley, there is a heavy 
concentration of population along the Wasatch Front, but the rest of the state is more sparsely 
populated.  Jessica VanBuren worked with Stacey Marz in Alaska and adapted the Alaska 
program to Utah’s needs.  Intrinsic to Utah’s services is its comprehensive self-help website.   
      
Staff assist people via phone, email and text.  Utah, however, employs only attorneys, believing 
they are necessary because they help SRLs with every type of state court case, not just family 
law.  They currently help an average of 20,000 customers a year, half of whom need help with 
family law cases.  Half of the people contact them by phone, a third by email, and a sixth by text.   
      
Utah faces some struggles with limited funding, which keeps them from operating full business 
hours.  They also routinely travel to the various courts across the state for outreach and training.  
Jessica expressed a desire to implement courthouse facilitation because it was a definite need 
that the state was not filling. 
      
The centralized remote delivery system that Utah has would be fairly simple to implement.  They 
said they began with just an attorney with a desk and a phone.  They encouraged us to ‘just do 
it!”  They also strongly advised that we strive for full funding at the start to avoid many of the 
struggles they have faced. 

ROGRAM CONSIDERATIONS FOR OREGON 

FUNDING 

he greatest impediment to Oregon joining the ranks of states that provide universal remote 

court services is funding.  There are varied models for funding among the states we have 
investigated.   
      
Some funding comes from Federal IV-D reimbursements.  Alaska and Northern California take 
advantage of this program, which reimburses two thirds of their program costs. 
     
Programs may be funded by allocation from the court budget.  This pays for the remainder of 
Alaska’s program, and a large portion of the cost for the Orange County and Minnesota 
programs.  
      
Utah receives statutory general budget funding from the Legislature.

      P

  T

     

 

Remote Services Delivery Report pg. 6 

      
Other sources of funding include grants and fees.  Both California programs benefit from the 
California Legislature’s Innovation Grant.  Minnesota’s program is partially funded by Bar fees. 
      
Oregon’s program could be funded by any of these sources, or a combination of them.  It is 
important that the program receive adequate funding and that the funding sources be secure 
enough to weather the vicissitudes of budgets. 

OVERSIGHT 

        
There may be differing levels of oversight, but most programs are overseen by their own 
management, which in turn operate under the State Court Administrator.  The Utah program, 
for example, has a Director who operates under the State Law Librarian, who reports to the 
State Courts, which includes an oversight committee.  The Oregon program may be formed 
under an existing court division or constitute its own division. 
      
A vital part of oversight is the need to collect data.  All programs collect data to report on various 
metrics such as how many people they serve, in what case types and how much time was spent.  
They may also capture demographic, and staff performance data.  The data informs the State on 
the need for continued and expanded funding, among other things. 

LOCATION 

he location of the ‘centralized remote delivery’ program is, in itself, not critically important 
because all services will be delivered virtually.  Incidentally, we recommend that no in-person 
services be provided at the remote location.  Some programs learned that to do so unfairly 
prejudiced  litigants in other jurisdictions and, most importantly, sabotaged the  efficient 
operation of the remote service center.  However, the Minnesota program believed that cross 
training staff in both in-person and remote access services was a benefit since it allows staff to 
recognize and learn the difficulties with in-person facilitation, and to keep those issues fresh 
when addressing the litigants’ needs remotely. 
       
Placing the program in a location outside of the usual Willamette Valley locations could send a 
message that we are serious about serving the people all over the state, not just in the most 
populous counties.   

n the other hand, siting the program in Salem or Portland may offer some logistical efficiency 
and allow access to a large pool of potential skilled employees.  Also, access to strong IT services 
is a critical component, as demonstrated by the Northern California program.  This either means 
that the program includes IT staffing or proximity to IT services that can fill the need. 

SCOPE OF SERVICES 

      
The Futures Committee proposes that the program begin by providing services for family law 
cases only.  We would include guardianships of minors in that scope of services.  Should the

program be able to expand to other case types to meet future need is something that can be 
addressed after the program is in place. 

irtual services include delivery by telephone, email, chat, fax, video/skype, webinars, website 

and virtual workshops.  While, each of these has been implemented to varying degrees in the 
programs investigated, all use telephone and email.  We propose that these forms of 
communication be implemented, and others as the SFLAC and others believe will be most 
efficacious.   Typically, contacts are handled on a first come, first served basis, and the programs 
do not provide voice mail, having found that playing telephone tag is very inefficient.  However, 
litigants are allowed to contact the program as many times as they wish.  Telephone calls 
average about 20 minutes each. 

everal of the programs that we studied also provide referral assistance to litigants to legal 
services, housing, domestic violence shelters, healthcare and the like, and consider this an 
important part of their mission. 

STAFFING 

       
Interestingly, our investigations revealed two different philosophies about what skill set makes 
the best staff.  The two focuses are either legal background or customer service.   
      
The founders and directors of the Utah program are invested in the idea that attorneys are the 
most capable persons to staff their program.  They require that applicants all be law school 
graduates.  They feel that attorneys are needed because they cover every type of case, not just 
family law.   Minnesota and Orange County also hire attorneys and felt strongly that legal 
oversight was a necessary component for success.  
      
The subcommittee is of the opinion that, generally speaking, customer service-oriented people 
can give the service needed because they have the people skills needed to successfully interact 
with the court’s customers and can be trained in the law.  However, particularly in the formative 
stages, it may be beneficial to have someone with legal training involved. The focus of the 
programs in Alaska and Northern California is on customer service.
