OREGON TAX COURT MISSION STATEMENT 

As part of the independent judicial branch of government, the Tax Court’s 
mission is: 

•  To impartially resolve disputes between taxpayers and tax 

•  To accurately apply Oregon law in written decisions for the guidance of 

administrators; 

the public; and 

•  To make its services accessible to all. 

INTRODUCTION 

This Oregon Tax Court Handbook (handbook) provides general 
information about tax appeals and the Oregon Tax Court.  It also provides 
information on the differences between the two divisions of the court: The 
Magistrate Division and the Regular Division. 
 
disagrees with an action by the Oregon Department of Revenue (the 
department), a county assessor, or a county board of property tax appeals 
(BOPTA).  The chart below shows the general path of a tax appeal. 
 

Generally, cases are filed in the Tax Court by a taxpayer who

Statutes (ORS) and to the Oregon Administrative Rules (OAR) are to the 
current statutes in effect.  The ORS are available online (see Reference 
Materials). 

F YOUR CASE IS IN THE REGULAR DIVISION:  Read this 
handbook with caution.  Formal rules of evidence and procedure apply.   
Exhibits and testimony provided in the Magistrate Division may not be 
admitted.  Most litigants are represented by attorneys.  See below for details.

OREGON TAX COURT 

The Oregon Tax Court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear appeals 

arising under the tax laws of Oregon, including personal income tax, property 
tax, corporate excise tax, certain commodity taxes (cigarettes, timber etc.), 
local budget law, and property tax limitations.  In property tax cases, the court 
“has jurisdiction to determine the real market value or correct valuation on the 
basis of the evidence before the court, without regard to the values pleaded by 
the parties.”  ORS 305.412.  In income tax cases, the court is tasked with 
determining the “correct amount of deficiency, even if the amount so 
determined is greater or less than” the amount assessed by the Oregon 
Department of Revenue.  ORS 305.575.   

Magistrate Division:  In the Magistrate Division of the Oregon Tax 

Court, cases are heard by a magistrate who is a judicial officer sworn to apply 
the laws in a fair and impartial manner.  Magistrates encourage cooperation 
between the parties.  If the parties are unable to resolve their dispute by mutual 
agreement, the magistrate may hold a trial.  During the trial, the magistrate 
will listen to what the parties say and consider the evidence.  A written 
decision resolving the dispute will be issued by the magistrate.  The decision is 
based only on the parties’ written and oral evidence admitted by the court.  
There is no official transcript or recording of the proceeding.  For more 
information, see Tax Court Rule-Magistrate Division (TCR-MD) 15.  

Regular Division:  Magistrate decisions may be appealed to the 

Regular Division of the Oregon Tax Court.  All proceedings in the Regular 
Division are original proceedings tried without a jury and de novo, meaning 
the case is tried anew.  Cases in the Regular Division are heard by a judge, 
who is an elected judicial officer sworn to apply the laws in a fair and 
impartial manner.  The judge’s decision is based on the official record of the 
case that includes the written and oral evidence properly submitted to the 
court.  Unlike the Magistrate Division, formal rules of evidence apply; most 
taxpayers and all government agencies are represented by attorneys.  The 
decision of the court is in the form of a written opinion or order. 

In both divisions of the Oregon Tax Court, the parties are responsible 

for contributing to the efficient management and resolution of their case.  If 
you pursue your appeal without the assistance of an attorney or other 
authorized representative, you will be expected to follow the rules of the court 
and to be familiar with relevant legal practices and procedures related to your 
case.

Magistrate Division:  You can appeal to the Magistrate Division by 
signing and filing a complaint and paying the fee.  A blank complaint form 
is available on the court’s website; upon request, the court will mail you the 
form at no charge.  Please carefully follow the instructions on the second 
page of the complaint form and include the required number of copies.  
Please note that the court’s mailing address is different from the court’s 
physical address.  A complaint sent by mail or private express carrier is 
considered “filed” on the date shown by the U.S. Postal Service cancellation 
mark stamped on the envelope containing the complaint, or on the date of 
mailing or dispatch if plaintiff provides satisfactory evidence from USPS or 
a private express carrier.  See ORS 305.418; TCR-MD 1 A(4).  Filers who 
are intending to rely on the date of mailing or the date of dispatch by private 
express carrier are encouraged to keep relevant receipts, shipment 
notification, and tracking history.  Otherwise, the “file” date will be the date 
the complaint is received by the court.   

Regular Division:  If your case has been heard in the Magistrate 

Division, and you are unhappy with the result, you may appeal the 
magistrate’s decision to the Regular Division of the Oregon Tax Court by 
paying the fee and filing: (1) an original written complaint; (2) a copy of the 
magistrate’s decision and any dispositive order; and (3) any attachments.  A 
sample complaint form is available on the court’s website; the court will 
mail you the form for no charge upon request. A complaint sent by mail is 
considered “filed” on the date shown by the U.S. Postal Service cancellation 
mark stamped on the envelope containing the complaint, or on the date of 
mailing or dispatch if plaintiff provides satisfactory evidence from USPS or 
a private express carrier.  See ORS 305.418; Tax Court Rule (TCR) 1 H. 
Filers who are intending to rely on the date of mailing or the date of dispatch 
by private express carrier are encouraged to keep relevant receipts, shipment 
notification, and tracking history.  Otherwise, the “file” date will be the date 
the complaint is received by the court.   

OTE: Staff at the court has observed that the U.S. Postal Service no longer 

consistently applies the cancellation mark to envelopes.  Filers are 
encouraged to consult with their local U.S. Postal Service office about 
obtaining a cancellation mark.  See 
https://about.usps.com/handbooks/po408/ch1_003.htm.

GENERAL QUESTIONS 

How do I file a complaint? 

What is the fee to file a complaint? 

The filing fee is set forth in ORS 305.490.1  The fee must 
accompany the signed complaint, or the complaint cannot be filed by the 
court. 
 

Magistrate Division 
Regular Division 

$50 
$281 

 
NOTE: In most income tax matters, all taxes, interest, and penalties must 
be paid before filing a complaint with the Regular Division.  ORS 
305.419. 
 

What if I cannot afford the filing fee? 

For individual taxpayers, if you cannot afford the filing fee, you 

can apply to have the court waive or defer the fee.  To apply for a fee 
waiver or deferral, you must complete and sign an Application for 
Deferral or Waiver of Fees & Declaration in Support.  That form is 
available on the court’s website or may be sent to you upon request.   

If the court waives your fee, you will not be responsible for paying 
the filing fee. 

If your filing fee is deferred, you are responsible for paying the 
filing fee at the end of the case after the judgment has issued.  Failure 
to pay fees, in full, within 30 days after the judgment is issued will 
result in additional fees being assessed.  You may request a payment 
plan and start making payments on your deferred fee while your case 
is pending.   

If the court denies your application, you must pay the filing fee 
immediately.  Failure to pay the filing fee in full after your 
application is denied may result in your appeal being returned to you.   

OTE: Individuals should consider applying for a fee waiver as early as 

possible to know the results prior to their filing deadline. 

 
1 The Oregon Legislature may modify fees between publications of this 
handbook.  If you are concerned that the fee may have changed, please call the 
court.

Costs and disbursements, including the filing fee, may only be 

awarded to a prevailing party.  A party may request costs and 
disbursements, including the filing fee, by filing a Statement for Costs 
and Disbursements, no later than 14 days after a trial is held.  The form is 
available on the court’s website.  See TCR-MD 16. 
 

What happens after a complaint is filed? 

The court will serve the complaint on defendant with a notice of 

filing (summons) giving defendant 30 days to file a response to the 
complaint.  This response is called an answer.  Sometimes the defendant 
will file a motion to dismiss instead of an answer.  After the defendant 
files its written response, the court will email2 or mail you a notice of 
scheduled court proceeding with the date and time for a case 
management conference.  Case management conferences are held via 
telephone or video conference.  The court generally will hold the initial 
case management conference two-four weeks after the defendant’s 
written response is received.  If you do not receive a hearing notice, but 
think that you should have, please call the court. 
 

Who hears my case? 

Magistrate Division:  A magistrate, who is a judicial officer with 

training and experience in tax law and valuation techniques, will be 
assigned to hear your case.  A magistrate will prepare a written decision. 

Regular Division:  The judge of the Oregon Tax Court, who is an 

elected judicial officer, will hear your appeal.  The judge will prepare a 
written opinion or order. 

OTE: There are no juries in the Oregon Tax Court. 

o I need a lawyer or other representative?

Can I get my filing fee back? 

• 

• 

• 

an individual taxpayer may handle his or her own case without a 
representative, hire a lawyer, or designate another representative.   
a legal entity such as a corporation or a partnership must 
designate a representative, but the representative need not be a 
lawyer.   
a government entity typically appears through employees, such 
as an auditor or an appraiser, but the government entity may use 
a lawyer. 

6 

Rev. 1/23 

In the Regular Division, an individual taxpayer may handle his 

or her own case without a lawyer, but most hire a lawyer.  No other 
representative is allowed.  All legal entities must be represented by a 
lawyer, and the government always is represented by a lawyer. 

The process in the Magistrate Division is often less formal than a 

typical court proceeding.  In the Regular Division, the appeal process is 
formal because proceedings must “conform, as far as practical to the 
rules of equity practice and procedure in this state.”  ORS 305.425(3). 

Several factors may be considered when deciding whether to 

have representation, including:  how complicated your case may be, and 
how much you know about the case, including any laws or valuation 
techniques that might be applicable or relevant.  Only you know how 
comfortable you will feel presenting your case.  If your case is being 
heard in the Magistrate Division, there are people other than lawyers who 
can represent you if you feel you should be represented.  See the next 
section for more details. 
 

Who may represent me? 

Magistrate Division.  Anyone authorized by the court may 

represent you.  Individuals who represent themselves, including those 
who act as trustees of a trust or personal representatives of an estate, may 
appear without completing an Authorization to Represent form.  All 
other representatives, except those licensed to practice law in Oregon, 
must be appointed by filing an Authorization to Represent form.   

ome examples of common representatives in the Magistrate 

  S

Division include: 
 

 

   

   

   

   

 

•  An Oregon public accountant (includes CPAs and other 

•  An employee of the taxpayer regularly employed by the 

licensed accountants) 

taxpayer in tax matters 

organization. 

•  A designated representative of a nonprofit or exempt 

•  A spouse, child who has arrived at the age of majority, or 

parent of the named party 

•  An Oregon licensed tax consultant 
•  A shareholder of an S corporation 
•  A partner of a partnership 
•  An Oregon licensed real estate broker 
•  A state certified, licensed, or registered appraiser 

7 

Rev. 1/23 

OTE:  If your representative is not an Oregon attorney, a signed 

Authorization to Represent must be submitted to the court.  That form is 
available on the court’s website and from the court upon request.  If you 
want to remove or change your authorized representative, you or 
your representative must notify the court in writing and provide a 
copy to all parties. 

Regular Division:  Representation choices are limited for cases 

before the Regular Division.  See above. 
 

What are the responsibilities of a representative? 

Even if you are not an Oregon attorney, as a representative in the 
Magistrate Division, you are responsible for following all the rules of the 
court.  (See the section titled “What are the rules of the court?” for 
further information.) 
 

You will be the contact on the case for that party.  You need to 
provide the court and the opposing party with your correct address and 
telephone number(s) so that you can receive information and filings 
related to the case.  If your contact information changes, you are required 
to notify the court, in writing, and provide copies to all parties.  If your 
case is settled or needs to be delayed or any other significant 
developments occur, you must promptly contact the court. 

n every legal dispute one party has the burden of proof, which 

means the responsibility to prove the facts related to the case.  The 

  I

  N

   

   

 

plaintiff—the person bringing the case—bears the burden of proof.  
Whether you represent plaintiff or defendant, you should prepare your 
case by gathering evidence and researching the law involved in your 
case.  If your case goes to trial, you will be responsible for presenting the 
evidence you have gathered and explaining how the evidence meets the 
legal requirements.  You may need to call witnesses and question them.  
You will also have the right to question or cross-examine any witnesses 
brought by the opposing party. 
 

Who will represent the government? 

In the Magistrate Division, representation depends on the 

complexity of the case and whether legal arguments are involved.  In 
income tax cases, the Department of Revenue (the department) is the 
defendant.  The department may be represented by an auditor or by an 
Oregon Department of Justice attorney. In most property tax cases, the 
county assessor is the defendant.  The county may be represented by an 
appraiser from the assessor’s office or by a county attorney. 

In the Regular Division, the case is by or against the department.  

Unless the department has filed the complaint, the department is the 
defendant.  The legal counsel for the department is provided by the 
Oregon Department of Justice.  In certain property tax cases, the county 
assessor may ask the court to participate as an intervenor.  If the county 
chooses to participate, a county attorney will act as the county’s 
representative.

(1)  send a copy of the writing to the other parties and  
(2)  send the court a copy with a certificate of service or other 
evidence, in writing, that a copy was provided to all 
parties.  

Please note that, in the Magistrate Division, a “cc” noting the parties 
copied on the document is sufficient. 

WARNING: If the court does not receive a Certificate of Service or 
other evidence that a copy of the writing was provided to all parties, the 
court will not file your document.     

 sample certificate of service form is available on the court’s website at 

http://courts.oregon.gov/Tax/docs/certificateofservice.pdf

OTE:  The court does not accept faxes over 10 pages.   

What are the rules of the court? 
 
The rules of court govern the processes and procedures of the 

 
 
court.  You must follow all the rules of court unless the magistrate gives

other instructions.  All the rules of court are available on the court’s 
website www.courts.oregon.gov/courts/tax/help/Pages/rules.aspx or you 
may request that a paper copy be sent to you. 

Magistrate Division: The rules of the Magistrate Division are 

cited as “Tax Court Rule-Magistrate Division” (TCR-MD).  If a situation 
arises that is not covered by a Magistrate Division rule, the Tax Court 
Rules may be used as a guide to the extent relevant.  By statute, the 
Magistrate Division is not bound by common law or statutory rules of 
evidence or by technical or formal rules of procedure.  See ORS 
305.501(4)(a). 

Regular Division: ORS 305.425(3) provides: 

“All hearings and proceedings before the tax court judge shall be 
in accordance with the rules of practice and procedure 
promulgated by the court, which shall conform, as far as practical 
to the rules of equity practice and procedure in this state.” 

Because of that law, the Tax Court has adopted rules that closely 

follow the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure.  All rules of the Regular 
Division are cited as “Tax Court Rule” (TCR). 
 

What is a case management conference? 

A case management conference is a conversation about the case 

with all parties present, usually conducted by telephone or video 
conference.  The purpose is for the judge or magistrate and the parties to 
discuss the issues in the case and decide how best to proceed.  The 
conference helps the judge or magistrate understand the issues, explore 
settlement, and determine whether a trial or mediation is appropriate.  
See TCR 52 and TCR-MD 8 for more information on case management 
conferences. 
 

What happens if I cannot be available when my case is 

scheduled? 

The process for having a court hearing rescheduled is explained in 

TCR-MD 8 B or TCR 52 D.  You will have to make a written request to 
have the proceeding reset.  If you do not request a reset and fail to appear at 
a court hearing, your case may be dismissed, or other sanctions may be 

10 

Rev. 1/23 

   

   

 

   

   

   

 

imposed.  If you are having a serious emergency that prevents you from 
appearing, please notify the court as soon as possible.   
 

Where will my case be heard? Can I present my case remotely? 

For Trials:  The court will hold a trial either in person or by video 

conference or telephone.  For budgetary reasons, in-person trials are usually 
restricted to the Oregon Tax Court in Salem.  
 

For Mediations:  Mediations are held in person.  For budgetary 
reasons, mediations are usually restricted to the Oregon Tax Court in Salem.   
 

What is efiling? 
 

Efiling via Oregon’s electronic filing system is mandatory for active 

members of the Oregon State Bar in both the Magistrate Division and the 
Regular Division of the Oregon Tax Court.  For more information regarding 
the court’s efiling rules see TCR-MD 1 A(3), TCR 9, and UTCR 21.  If you 
are not an active member of the Oregon State Bar efiling is allowed but not 
required. Registration and information available at: 
https://oregon.tylerhost.net/ofsweb  

OTE: Pro hac vice attorneys are not considered active members of the 

Oregon State Bar and are not required to efile. 
 

What if I or a witness needs an interpreter or 
accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act? 

 
If you or your witnesses require a language interpreter, assistive 

 
listening device, materials in an alternate format, or other accommodations, 
please promptly notify the court.  More information about ADA accessibility 
is available at: www.courts.oregon.gov/courts/tax/go/Pages/accessibility.aspx 
 

MUTUAL AGREEMENT AND MEDIATION 

Can I try to settle the case before it is heard? 

Yes.  The court encourages the parties to try to settle their case 

or at least find areas of mutual agreement whenever possible.  Settlement 
will save the parties time and money.  Settlement discussions also give 
the parties a chance to share information and reach a better 

11 

Rev. 1/23 

 

 

   

 

  N

understanding of the issues of the case.  If you do reach an agreement, 
please contact the court. 
 

What is mediation? 

Mediation is not a trial.  The goal is to have the parties settle the 

case by agreement.  In the Magistrate Division, a magistrate will 
facilitate the discussion to help the parties talk about their case and 
resolve it voluntarily.  

For more information about mediation please see the court’s 

mediation handbook located here: 
www.courts.oregon.gov/courts/tax/help/Documents/TAX-
MediationHandbook.pdf 

 

NOTE: Court-sponsored mediation is not available in the Regular 
Division.  Parties in the Regular Division may arrange mediation 
privately, or they may try to settle the case informally without a 
mediator. 
 

PREPARING YOUR CASE – GENERALLY 

If the case goes to trial, how do I prepare? 

The court cannot instruct you on how to prepare for trial; 

however, the following suggestions may be helpful: 
 

•  FOCUS ON THE ISSUE(S) before the court.  Avoid 

emotional arguments and personal attacks on the other party.  
Arguments based on the facts and law are more persuasive.  
In a property tax appeal, the issue is typically the value of 
the property or entitlement to exemption or special 
assessment, not the amount of tax.  This may involve legal 
issues or appraisal methods.  In an income tax appeal, the 
issue is often taxable income or allowable deductions. 
 

•  GATHER OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (INFORMATION) 
that relates to the issues in your case.  What is the legal 
standard you need to meet?  Are there experts, such as 
accountants or appraisers, who may be able to help you?  
What evidence does the other party have?  Do not be afraid 

12 

Rev. 1/23 

   

   

 

   

 

to ask the other party about their evidence or to share your 
own. 

  ORGANIZE YOUR EVIDENCE in a way that will help the 
court understand your position.  What are the undisputed 
facts?  The disputed facts?  Be prepared to explain how each 
piece of evidence supports your position.  Make a list of the 
key points you wish to make. 

  SEE THE APPENDIX discussing Property Value Tax 
Appeals - Residential Property for more information. 

What if my case is in the Regular Division? 

  •

  •

13 

Rev. 1/23 

You should read this handbook with caution.  In the Regular 

Division, the formal rules of evidence apply, as do other formal 
procedural rules.  These include complex rules against admitting 
documents that are hearsay, rules about laying a foundation for certain 
testimony, etc.  For that reason, it is possible that testimony and materials 
you provided in the Magistrate Division may not be admitted as evidence 
in the Regular Division.  Although an individual taxpayer is allowed to 
proceed without an attorney, in the Regular Division most taxpayers are 
represented by attorneys.  The government is always represented by an 
attorney.  See the end of this handbook for information about hiring an 
attorney. 

hat materials should I send to the court? 

  W

The court’s rules require that all materials you want considered 

for the case be sent to the court and to the other party before trial.  Do not 
expect that materials provided to the Board of Property Tax Appeals or 
the Department of Revenue will be available to the magistrate.  Each 
party makes a final decision during the trial about which of the materials 
to ask the court to consider.  (For that reason, you should not assume that 
the court will consider every document you received from the other party 
before trial.  If you want the court to consider something, ask the court 
yourself.)  Materials include, but are not limited to, writings, reports, 
notes, graphs, pictures, maps, receipts, diaries, ledgers, tax returns, and 
articles. 
 

 

 

   

 

Each party may request information from the other party that is 

relevant and not privileged.  The court may be requested to issue an order 
if the parties are unwilling to provide the requested information.  See 
TCR 36-46; TCR-MD 9. 

s information sent to the court confidential? 

  I

In general, information provided to the court is considered 

public.  However, some information cannot be disclosed because it is 
deemed confidential either by law or by court rule.  If you have concerns 
regarding confidentiality of information, you should discuss it with the 
Judge or Magistrate assigned to your case.  The court may issue an order 
protecting certain information as provided in ORS 305.430.  For more 
information on segregation and protection of personal information see 
TCR 35. 
 

When should I send exhibits? 

Magistrate Division:  For trial, all materials must be either 

postmarked at least 14 days before the trial date or received at least 10 
days before the trial date unless otherwise set by the court.  Exhibits may 
not be faxed to the court without magistrate approval.  See TCR-MD 12 
and TCR 56 for further information.   

Regular Division:  The court sets a date for exchange of exhibits.  

For example, exhibits in valuation cases, such as appraisal reports, are 
usually due 30 days before trial.  Other documents must be provided no 
later than five business days before trial.  Evidence must be offered into 
evidence and admitted by the court during trial.  See TCR 56 for further 
information. 

OTE: The court may set an earlier or later time than required by the 

rules of the court for parties to exchange materials. 
 

How should I label my materials? 

Plaintiff’s exhibits are to be marked numerically.  Each 
document should be given its own number (1, 2, 3); if the document has 
multiple pages the labeling should include page numbers (e.g., Ex 1, p1 
of 3, Ex 1, p2 of 3, Ex 1, p3 of 3, etc.). 
 

   

   

   

   

 

  N

14 

Rev. 1/23 

Defendant’s exhibits are to be marked alphabetically.  Each 

 
document should be given its own letter (A, B, C); if the document has 
multiple pages the labeling should include page numbers (e.g., Ex A, p1 
of 3, Ex A, p2 of 3, Ex A, p3 of 3, etc.). 

xhibits must be securely bound, for example with a staple, or within a 

binder.  The case number must appear on the first page or the binder 
cover.  Please contact the court BEFORE submitting your exhibits if you 
have questions about how to properly label your exhibits.  
 

What if I miss the deadline for submitting materials? 

In both divisions, the court is not required to accept into 
evidence (admit) any materials not submitted by the pre-trial deadlines 
established by the court.  Materials not admitted into evidence by the 
court will not be considered by the judge or the magistrate deciding your 
case.  For that reason, it is important that you submit any materials you 
want the court to consider on or before the deadline.   
 

How can I prove the value of property? 

One of the most common reasons for filing a property value tax 
appeal is that you think the real market value (RMV) of the property, as 
determined by the county assessor or BOPTA, is incorrect. 

The burden of proof rests with the plaintiff.  That means the 

plaintiff must present factual evidence to prove the value of the property. 

To prove the value of property is incorrect, you must present 

evidence as to its actual value as of the assessment date.  How much does 
an appraiser say the property is worth?  What price would a buyer pay to 
own the property and a seller accept?  When presenting evidence to the 
court about the value of property, it is important to keep in mind that, 
although evidence of how much a property sold for (i.e., how much it 
cost to purchase the property) is persuasive and will be given some 
weight, it is not necessarily conclusive evidence of the property’s real 
market value.  See Ward v. Dept. of Revenue, 293 Or 506, 510, 650 P2d 
923 (1982) (holding that evidence of the agreed price in a voluntary, 
arm’s length sale is persuasive evidence of the property’s market value, 
however, the sale “is not necessarily determinative of market value and 
does not foreclose other methods of valuation”) (citations omitted). 

  E

   

   

   

   

 

15 

Rev. 1/23 

There are many different methods of proving the value of 

property.  Some options include: 
 

• 

• 

• 

hiring an appraiser to prepare a report of the value  
of the property. 
researching county records showing sales of nearby 
comparable properties that sold on or about the date of 
assessment for the property.  Comparable properties must be 
similar to the subject property or adjusted for differences. 
hiring a real estate agent to assist in valuing the property. 

If you hire an appraiser, real estate agent, or other expert to 

provide a written report of the property’s value, that expert should be 
available to testify at the trial.  Court rules of fairness require that the 
opposing party have the opportunity to question any witnesses.  The 
defendant’s appraisers or other experts should also attend trial and be 
available for questions.  Additionally, you may call other witnesses who 
can offer information about the property and its value. 

For a taxpayer, merely criticizing the value determined by the 

assessor or BOPTA will not help to prove your case.  See Woods v. Dept. 
of Rev., 16 OTR 56, 59 (2002) (“As this court has pointed out, it is not 
enough for a taxpayer to criticize a county’s position.  Taxpayers must 
provide competent evidence of the RMV of their property.”) (citation 
omitted).   

Also, keep in mind that the cost of building, purchasing, or 

remodeling a home or other structure (e.g., a garage or workshop) does 
not necessarily equate with the value of the improvements on the 
property.  That is because it is difficult to know what value the market 
will place on certain costs of constructing or improving a property. 

AUTION: When preparing your case, remember that the court places  
little weight on evidence that compares the assessed value (AV) of the 
property under appeal with the AV of neighboring or similar properties. 

he court puts little weight on that type of evidence because there is 

generally no evidence that demonstrates the AV of any given property is 
truly representative of the RMV of the property.  Another reason that AV 
of other properties is given little weight by the court is because AV is the 

16 

Rev. 1/23 

   

 

   

   

  C

  T

 

result of a formula created by statute as required by Measure 50.  
Because of that formula, the AV of property varies widely from one 
property to the next even where the properties are very similar. 
 

THE DAY OF TRIAL – PRESENTING YOUR CASE 

F YOUR TRIAL IS IN THE REGULAR DIVISION:  See section 
What if my case is in the Regular Division? above 
  

What should I bring to court? 

Be sure to bring all the materials previously submitted to the 

court and the other parties.  Also, you should be sure that all your 
witnesses are planning to attend and know how to get to the court.  The 
courtroom in Salem has an easel for making presentations.  If you need 
other special equipment, such as a slide projector, video player, or 
computer, you must make your own arrangements.  Please notify the 
court if you will be bringing special equipment.   
 

Do I need witnesses? 

Witnesses are people with firsthand knowledge about important 

things you need to prove in your case.  You are not required to bring 
witnesses, but you should if they will help your case.  Think about 
whether someone else has information to tell the court that you cannot 
tell yourself, or whether they may be able to say it better.  Talk to them 
first to find out what they know and arrange for them to be at the court 
on the day of trial. 
 

What are the trial procedures? 
 
In most cases, trials will proceed according to the following 

 
format, unless the judge or magistrate directs otherwise: 
 

Opening Statements: At the beginning of trial, both sides will 

have the opportunity to present an overview of their case.  You should be 
prepared to give the court a short summary of the evidence you are about 
present, along with a brief statement of the reasons you believe the 
evidence supports your legal theory of the case.  In general, the plaintiff 
will go first.     
 

17 

Rev. 1/23 

  I

   

   

 

Presentation of Evidence:  After opening statements, each party 
will have the opportunity to present its evidence. Generally, the plaintiff 
presents their evidence first.  Evidence is usually presented in the form of 
testimony and exhibits.  If you are the plaintiff, you will be allowed to 
“testify” before the judge or magistrate as to why you should get what 
you asked for in your complaint.  If you have witnesses, you may ask 
your witnesses questions.  The answers to those questions are their 
testimony.  After each witness testifies, the other party will be given an 
opportunity to ask questions of the witness.  This is known as “cross 
examination.”  After the other party has had a chance to ask questions, 
the witness will be given another chance to give additional testimony 
(“redirect”).  The judge or the magistrate may also ask the witness 
questions.  If you have exhibits, you should plan to explain what the 
exhibits are and how they support your position.   

The court cannot instruct you on how to present your case; 

however, the following suggestions may be helpful: 
 

•  Follow courtroom etiquette.  Be on time.  Dress neatly.  
Stand when the judge or magistrate enters and exits the 
courtroom; address him or her respectfully as Your Honor or 
Judge.  Be polite.  If you are not sure what to do during the 
trial, ask the court clerk, the judge or magistrate.   

18 

Rev. 1/23 

  Focus on the issue.  In a property value tax appeal, the issue 
is the value of the property, not the amount of the tax.  In 
other cases, focus on the law and facts. 

  Give context.  The court is not as familiar with your case as 
you are, start your presentation by giving some background 
information and telling the judge or magistrate about your 
situation. 

For example, in a property value tax appeal, describe some 
or all of the following: where the property is located, what 
types of buildings are on the property, how long you have 
owned the property, what improvements have been made to 
the property, and how much you would sell the property for 
on the open market.  Include other information about the 
property that is important to your case.   

  •

  •

 

 

   

 

•  Present factual information.  Keep your presentation brief 

and factual.  Organize your evidence in a way that will help 
the court understand your position.  What are the undisputed 
facts?  The disputed facts? 

  Be prepared to explain how each piece of evidence supports 
your position.  Create a list of the key points you wish to 
make.  Keep it with you for reference. 

  Avoid emotional arguments.  After you have told your story 
and called your witnesses, it will be the other party’s turn to 
make its case.  Listen respectfully.  Be calm.  Do not 
interrupt.  Make notes on any points you would like to 
clarify.  You will have the opportunity to ask questions of 
the defendant’s witnesses. 

  Ask specific questions of witnesses.  Whether you are asking 
questions of your own witnesses or the witnesses for the 
defendant, ask specific questions to gather information.  Do 
not argue with witnesses.  Do not repeat what has already 
been said. 

  Do not rely on the other party’s evidence.  For most issues, 

the plaintiff bears the burden of proof.  If there is 
information that you think is helpful to your case, make sure 
you present it to the court.   

Closing statements.  At the end of the trial, both sides will have 
the opportunity to give their closing statements.  That is an opportunity 
to tie together all your evidence, witness testimony, and other 
information so that the judge or magistrate understands your position.   

How will the case be decided? 

The judge or magistrate will review all the evidence, witness 

testimony, and other information presented at the trial, determine what 
the relevant facts are, apply the law to the facts, and make a decision.

AFTER THE TRIAL 
 

How long will it take to get a decision? 

It depends on the court’s docket and the complexity of the case.  
If you are concerned, please call the court to check the status.  All of the 
court’s decisions and opinions are also available on the court’s website 
at: www.courts.oregon.gov/publications/tax/Pages/default.aspx 
 

Can the case be appealed? 

Regular Division:  After a final opinion or order is issued, a 

Magistrate Division:  If you disagree with the magistrate’s 
decision, you may appeal to the Regular Division of the Tax Court.  
Your appeal must be filed with the court within 60 days from the date 
the magistrate’s written decision is entered See ORS 305.501(5)(a).  If 
neither party appeals the magistrate’s decision within 60 days of the date 
it was entered, the decision becomes final.  The magistrate will then issue 
a written judgment that is binding on all parties and cannot be appealed.  
See ORS 305.501(7). 
 
judgment will be entered.  Judgments of the Regular Division may be 
appealed to the Oregon Supreme Court.  Your appeal to the Oregon 
Supreme Court must be filed within 30 days from the date of the Tax 
Court’s final judgment.  See ORS 19.255.  On appeal to the Supreme 
Court, the opinion or order of the judge of the Tax Court is reviewed for 
errors or questions of law or lack of substantial evidence in the record to 
support the Tax Court’s opinion or order.  See ORS 305.445.  If there is 
no appeal, the opinion or order and judgment of the Tax Court becomes 
final.  See ORS 305.440(1). 
 

If I am owed a refund how will I get it? 

Generally, refunds are handled by the county or Department of 
Revenue.  You should contact the county or the department to make any 
special arrangements or if you have questions.

APPENDIX 

PROPERTY VALUE TAX APPEALS – RESIDENTIAL 
PROPERTY 

OTE: THIS HANDBOOK IS NOT INTENDED AS LEGAL 

ADVICE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR 
THE OREGON REVISED STATUTES AND RULES OF THE 
COURT. 

Cases that involve property taxes are commonly referred to as 

property tax appeals.  However, the issue in a property value tax appeal 
is not the amount of tax.  Rather, the issue is the value of the property on 
which the taxes are assessed.  Because the value of the property is the 
issue of the appeal, you should bring evidence that shows the property’s 
value, not evidence of the tax amount. 

Oregon’s property tax system is COMPLEX; the section below 
explains some of the complicated statutes and constitutional provisions 
that make up Oregon’s property tax system.  Be sure to take your time 
and read the section below carefully.  A clear understanding of how 
Oregon’s property tax system works is an important part of preparing 
and presenting a strong case to the court. 

Unless otherwise noted, all references to the Oregon Revised 

Statutes (ORS) and to the Oregon Administrative Rules (OAR) are to the 
current statutes in effect. 
 

Oregon’s property tax system 

Before 1997, property in Oregon was generally assessed at 100 

percent of its real market value (RMV).  See ORS 308.232 (1995).  RMV 
is defined by statute as “the amount in cash that could reasonably be 
expected to be paid by an informed buyer to an informed seller, each 
acting without compulsion in an arm’s-length transaction occurring as of 
the assessment date for the tax year.”  ORS 308.205(1). 

Significant changes were made to the law in 1997 when ballot 

Measure 50 passed.  Measure 50 amended the Oregon constitution to 
change a property’s assessed value (AV) from 100 percent of RMV to 

 

   

   

   

   

   

 

  N

21 

Rev. 1/23 

the lesser of: “(a) the property’s maximum assessed value (MAV); or (b) 
the property’s real market value.”  ORS 308.146(2) (1997). 

n the 1997-98 tax year, MAV was set at 90 percent of the 

property’s RMV for the 1995-96 tax year.  Or Const, Art XI, § 11(1)(a).  
For example, a property with a 1995-96 RMV of $100,000 would have 
had a MAV in 1997-98 of $90,000.  For each successive year, absent an 
exception (see next paragraph), the MAV shall equal 103 percent of the 
property’s AV from the prior year or 100 percent of the property’s MAV, 
whichever is greater.  Or Const, Art XI, § 11(1)(b); see also 
ORS 308.146(1). 

  I

Several exceptions exist to the general rule that the MAV cannot 
increase by more than three percent.  For example, property that is “new 
property or new improvements to property” is not subject to the three 
percent rule.  See ORS 308.146(3)(a).  An example of “new property” is 
the construction of a home on a lot.  An example of “new improvements 
to property” is a remodel of an existing home or building. 

When there is a special circumstance, such as when property is 

considered to be “new property or new improvements to property,” a 
special calculation must be done for that property to receive the benefits 
of Measure 50.  That calculation results in what is often called exception 
value.  See generally ORS 308.146(3) and ORS 308.153; see also OAR 
150-308-0170. 

Remember, AV is the lesser of RMV or MAV.  ORS 308.146(2). 

Board of property tax appeals 

Generally, when a taxpayer disagrees with the value set forth in 

the annual property tax statement, the taxpayer’s first step is to file a 
petition of appeal with the county board of property tax appeals 
(BOPTA) in the county where the property is located.  BOPTA hears 
property tax value disputes for the current tax year.  See ORS 309.026 
and OAR 150-309-0030.  BOPTA only has jurisdiction to reduce the real 
market value.  ORS 309.026.  (By contrast, an appeal to the court may 
result in an increase or decrease in the property value.  See ORS 
305.412.)  Taxpayers must file appeals with BOPTA no later than 
December 31.  See ORS 309.100(2).  Appeals are heard by BOPTA from 
the first Monday in February through April 15.  See ORS 309.026. 

22 

Rev. 1/23 

   

   

   

 

   

 

The taxpayer filing the petition may appear before BOPTA and 

present evidence or argument about the correct value of the property. 

The requirements for petitioning BOPTA and appearing before 

BOPTA are set forth in ORS 309.100 and OAR 150-309-0070.  BOPTA 
will issue a written order of its decision.  ORS 309.110(1). 

 taxpayer who disagrees with the order issued by BOPTA has 

30 days from the date the order was mailed to file an appeal with the 
Magistrate Division of the Oregon Tax Court.  See ORS 309.110(7); see 
also ORS 305.280(4).  If no appeal is filed, the BOPTA order becomes 
final. 
 

Appeals under ORS 305.288 

  A

When a taxpayer does not appeal to BOPTA and appeals directly 

to the Tax Court, the court’s authority to hear a case and grant relief is 
limited by law.  The taxpayer must either allege a substantial error in the 
RMV (at least 20 percent) in property used primarily as a dwelling or 
show good and sufficient cause for failing to petition BOPTA before 
coming to the court.  See generally ORS 305.288.  The court only has 
authority to hear the current tax year and the two proceeding tax years 
under ORS 305.288. 

Error of at least 20 percent:  ORS 305.288(1) allows the court to 
reduce the value of certain property when there is an error in the RMV of 
at least 20 percent when measured against the roll value.  The 20 percent 
rule is limited to “property [that] was or is used primarily as a dwelling 
(or is vacant) * * *.”  That includes, for example, residential property, 
manufactured homes, or condominiums.  See ORS 305.288(1)(a).  
Taxpayer must both allege and prove a 20 percent error.    

Good and sufficient cause:  Because situations may exist that 

prevent a taxpayer from timely appealing to BOPTA, the legislature 
granted the court authority to review untimely appeals when the taxpayer 
establishes “good and sufficient cause” for not filing an appeal on time 
with BOPTA.  See ORS 305.288(3). 

The term “good and sufficient cause” is defined as “an 
extraordinary circumstance that is beyond the control of the taxpayer, or 

23 

Rev. 1/23 

   

   

   

   

   

   

 

the taxpayer’s agent or representative, and that causes the taxpayer, agent 
or representative to fail to pursue the statutory right of appeal.”  See ORS 
305.288(5)(b)(A). 

The statute states that “inadvertence, oversight, lack of 
knowledge, hardship or reliance on misleading information provided by 
any person except an authorized tax official providing the relevant 
misleading information” do not meet the definition of “good and 
sufficient cause.”  See ORS 305.288(5)(b)(B). 
 

Presenting a property value tax appeal 

Generally, property value tax appeals involve questions of fact.  

How much was the property worth on the market on the assessment date?  
How did the property compare with similar properties?  You must 
present evidence to the court that establishes and supports the RMV of 
your property as of the assessment date. 

Sometimes questions of law are also at issue in a property value 

tax appeal.  Two common questions of law that arise in property tax 
cases are:  (1) Aggrievement:  whether the property taxpayer is 
“aggrieved” such that the court can grant relief that will result in a 
reduction in tax, and (2) Uniformity:  whether the property is treated 
equally under the current property tax system.  Both of those topics are 
explained in more detail below. 

Question of Law - Aggrievement:  For a property value tax 
appeal to be properly heard by the court, the party seeking relief from the 
court must be aggrieved under ORS 305.275.  A taxpayer is not 
aggrieved if action by the court on the case would not affect the tax 
liability or amount of tax due. 

This means that, in most cases, for a taxpayer to be aggrieved the 

taxpayer must allege a RMV for the property is less than the AV on the 
roll for the property.  See Parks Westsac L.L.C. v. Dept. of Rev., 15 OTR 
50, 52 (1999) (holding that a taxpayer is not aggrieved within the 
meaning of ORS 305.275 where the “property’s maximum assessed 
value is less than its real market value”). 

However, in some cases the court can hear your case even if the 
RMV you propose is more than the AV on the roll because it will result 

24 

Rev. 1/23 

   

   

   

   

   

   

 

in some tax savings due to “compression.”  This is a case-by-case 
situation based on where you live, local tax rates, and the special taxes 
(i.e., local option taxes) imposed by your county—check with your 
county assessor. 
 

Question of Law - Uniformity:  A common argument by 
taxpayers is that the AV of a taxpayer’s property is not consistent with 
other similar properties located nearby.  That argument is often based on 
a view that taxes are supposed to be uniform as between similar 
properties.  That argument was discussed in the case Ellis v. Lorati, 14 
OTR 525 (1999), and the court concluded that, based on the explicit 
provisions of Measure 50, uniformity is not required. 
 

Changes made to the property tax system in 1997 because of 

Measure 50 may result “in various degrees of nonuniformity in the 
property tax system.  Section 11(18) [of the Oregon Constitution] 
contemplates this and excuses itself from complying with other 
constitutional provisions requiring uniformity, specifically Article IX, 
section 1, and Article I, section 32.”  Ellis v. Lorati, 14 OTR at 535.

Rev. 1/23 

GLOSSARY OF TERMS 

nswer:  A defendant’s first pleading that addresses the merits of the 
case admitting or denying the plaintiff’s allegations and sets forth any 
defenses or counterclaims. 

ppraisal:  An appraisal of property is typically a report prepared by an 

appraiser expressing an opinion of real property value that reflects 
pertinent market information.  Various approaches may be used in the 
process of appraising property, including cost, income, and sales 
comparison.   

ppraiser:  A licensed professional who estimates property value.  In 

property tax cases, the county assessor is typically the defendant and 
appears through a staff appraiser.  Taxpayers, of course, may hire their 
own appraisers. 

ssessed value (AV):  Taxes are computed on the property’s assessed 
value.  AV is the property’s assessed value (Measure 50 value) or the 
property’s real market value, whichever is less.  See ORS 308.146(2).  
AV is sometimes referred to as taxable assessed value. 

ssessment date:  The date on which real or personal property is valued.  

See ORS 308.007(1).  For example: the assessment date for the 2015-16 
tax year is January 1, 2015.   

ssessment/tax roll:  The complete record of the assessment of all 

taxable property for each year as of January 1, at 1:00 a.m. of the 
assessment year.  See ORS 308.210(1).    

ssessment year:  The assessment year begins January 1 and 

corresponds to the tax year that begins July 1 of the same calendar year.  
See ORS 308.007(2).  For example, the 2006-07 tax year began on July 
1, 2006, and ended on June 30, 2007, and the corresponding assessment 
year began on January 1, 2006, and ended on December 31, 2006. 

ssessor:  An elected or appointed official in each county charged with 

the administration of the property taxes for the county. 

oard of property tax appeals (BOPTA):  Each county has a board of 
property tax appeals.  Members of the board are appointed as required by

a petition with BOPTA after tax statements are mailed until December 
31 of the current year.  See ORS 309.100(1), (2).  BOPTA will consider 
the petition, enter a written order of determination, and mail the order to 
the petitioner.  See ORS 309.110. 

urden of proof:  The burden of proof is a preponderance of the 

evidence, meaning the greater weight and the more convincing evidence.  
For example, the plaintiff in a property value tax appeal bears the burden 
to show that their valuation best reflects the real market value of the 
property.  See ORS 305.427; Lewis v. Dept. of Rev., 302 Or 289, 293, 
728 P2d 1378 (1986). 

omparable properties:  Also referred to as “comparables,” that term 
refers to properties that are similar to the property being appraised and 
that have been sold recently.   

omplaint:  The first document filed with the court by the plaintiff; it 
starts the case and states what the issues are and what action or relief the 
plaintiff would like from the court. 

osts and disbursements: “Costs and disbursements” are reasonable 

and necessary expenses incurred in the prosecution or defense of an 
action other than for legal services, including filing fees.  For more 
information see TCR-MD 16. 

e novo review:  An appeal of a decision of a magistrate is reviewed de 
novo by the Regular Division, which means the case is presented anew to 
the Regular Division judge. 

ecision:  The document containing a magistrate’s written opinion of the 
merits in a case.  Parties may appeal magistrate’s decision to the Regular 
Division.  A decision usually comes after trial or on motion(s) for 
summary judgment.  If a case is dismissed, it is called a decision of 
dismissal.   

efendant:  Generally, the county assessor or the Oregon Department of 

Revenue. 

vidence:  Information including, but not limited to, testimony, 

documents, tangible objects, pictures, maps, tax returns, receipts, etc.,

that tends to prove or disprove a material fact.  The judge or magistrate 
may find that certain evidence is not admissible; for example, when it is 
submitted after the deadline.   

xception value:  Generally, a property’s MAV cannot be increased 

from the prior year by more than three percent except for certain 
exceptions.  Exception value refers to value added under one of those 
exceptions. See ORS 308.146(3).   

x parte contact:  Prohibited communication between a party and the 
magistrate when the opposing party is not present or copied.  A party is 
required to provide the other parties with copies of every writing sent to 
the court, including letters, motions, and documents.  See TCR 9, 
TCR-MD 5, and “Statement (certificate) of service” in this glossary for 
more information. 

udgment: 

Magistrate Division:  A judgment is entered after all appeal rights have 
expired.  After a judgment is entered in the Magistrate Division, the 
decision of the magistrate is final and cannot be appealed.  TCR-MD 20. 

egular Division:  A judgment is the final determination of the rights of 

the parties in an action.  TCR 67A.  A judgment sets forth the 
conclusions stated in orders and opinions.  A party may appeal to the 
Oregon Supreme Court from a judgment issued by the Regular Division 
of the Oregon Tax Court.  See ORS 305.445  

aximum assessed value (MAV):  Oregon law provides that for the 
1997-98 tax year, each property’s MAV was 90 percent of the property’s 
1995-96 real market value.  Generally, the MAV cannot increase by 
more than 3% per year, subject to certain exceptions. 

easure 5:  A citizen initiative that took effect in the 1991-92 tax year 

setting constitutional tax rate limitations.  Or Const, Art XI, § 11b.  
Measure 5 now limits that tax rate to $5 per $1,000 of assessed value, 
and general government (nonschool) taxes to $10 per $1,000 of assessed 
value.  Since the provisions of Measure 50 were enacted, Measure 5 rate 
limits are based on real market value rather than on assessed value. 

easure 50:  In May 1997, the voters approved Measure 50 by 

referendum.  Measure 50 imposes limits on assessments and tax rates for

Rev. 1/23 

property.  To implement the limits on assessments, the concept of 
“maximum assessed value” (MAV) was established.  MAV cannot 
increase by more than three percent except in certain circumstances.  
ORS 308.146(1).   Property is taxed at the lesser of its MAV or its RMV.  
ORS 308.146(2). 

pinion:  A written opinion or order is prepared in each case decided in 

the Regular Division by the judge of the Oregon Tax Court.  Selected 
written opinions are published in the Oregon Tax Reports pursuant to 
ORS 305.450.  Parties dissatisfied with the written opinion may file a 
motion for reconsideration within 20 days after the opinion has been 
rendered and before the judgment is signed.  See TCR 80. 

Magistrate Division:  An order in the Magistrate Division is the title of a 
document containing a decision by a magistrate.  An order may decide an 
issue or procedure.  Some examples are:  an order granting an extension 
of time for parties to report to the court; an order denying a motion to 
dismiss; or an order requiring a party to produce documents. 

egular Division:  An order in the Regular Division is the title of a 

document containing a decision by the judge of the Oregon Tax Court.  
An order may either decide an issue or procedure or determine the 
outcome of the case.  Some examples are:  an order allowing third party 
intervention; an order granting an extension of time; or an order granting 
or denying a motion for summary judgment.  See TCR 67A. 

laintiff:  The plaintiff is the party who filed the appeal. 

eal market value (RMV):  Defined as “the amount in cash that could 
reasonably be expected to be paid by an informed buyer to an informed 
seller, each acting without compulsion in an arm’s-length transaction 
occurring as of the assessment date for the tax year.”  See ORS 
308.205(1).   

ules of the court:  The rules of the court set out the procedures the 
parties follow as the case proceeds before the court.  The Tax Court 
Rules (TCRs) govern the Regular Division of the Oregon Tax Court and 
closely follow the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure.  For cases in the 
Magistrate Division, the Tax Court Rules-Magistrate Division (TCR-
MD) apply.  https://www.courts.oregon.gov/courts/tax/help/Pages/rules.aspx

tatement (certificate) of service:  A statement confirming that you 
provided the other party or parties with a copy of documents or other 
materials sent to the court, that also states when and how the copy was 
provided (via mail, fax, hand delivery, etc.).  Note that in the Magistrate 
Division, a “cc” (carbon copy) on the court’s copy of the document is 
enough to inform the court that the other party has received a copy.  See 
the Tax Court Rules, including TCR 7, 9, 10, and 55, for more 
information on service requirements in the Regular Division.  

ax year:  ORS 308.007 defines “tax year” or “fiscal year” to mean a 
12-month period beginning July 1 and ending June 30.  For example, the 
tax year 2006-07 began on July 1, 2006, and ended on June 30, 2007.  
The following tax year was 2007-08, which began on July 1, 2007, and 
ended on June 30, 2008.
