JOSEPHINE COUNTY 
STANDARD PARENTING PLAN 
 

It is the policy of this court to encourage the parties to work out their own Parenting 
Plan, either between themselves, with the help of legal professionals or through 
mediation. The court will generally approve any Parenting Plan agreed upon by the 
parties.  

he intent of the Standard Parenting Plan is to provide a Parenting Plan to parties who 
have not been able to agree to an alternate, more flexible plan. Because each family's 
circumstances are different, the court may make provisions for more or less parenting 
time than provided for in the Standard Parenting Plan. The best interest of the child is 
the only consideration.

GENERAL PROVISIONS  

1. 

REMOTE SCHOOLING 

Definition of School Day. If the child is enrolled in school, the parenting 
plan is based on the school calendar where the child is enrolled. A “school 
day” includes any day in which school is considered by the district to be a 
“day taught” or a day “in session” even if the classes are remote.  

 “no school day” shall be as defined by the district and include all days 

designated as having “no classes” including observed legal holidays, 
professional development days, in-service/clerical days, and conference 
days.  

arenting Time Exchanges. If the parenting plan requires an exchange 
at the start or end of a “school day” but school is not physically in session 
at the school campus, then the exchange time shall be at the ordinarily set 
for school to commence or end as though school was physically in session 
at the campus. The parent who is starting hi/her parenting time shall pick

up the child(ren) from the residence of the parent whose parenting time is 
ending. 

Meals and Clothes. The residential parent shall have the child(ren) fed 
and ready on time with sufficient clothing packed and ready for the 
nonresidential parent's parenting time. The nonresidential parent shall 
return all the clothing which accompanied the child(ren) and shall have the 
child(ren) fed before the child(ren) return to the residential parent.  

Exchange of Children From One Parent to the Other. When parents 
live no more than 60 miles apart, unless the nonresidential parent’s 
parenting time begins or ends at the child(ren)’s beginning or dismissal 
from a school day, the nonresidential parent shall pick up the child(ren) 
from the residential parent's residence no earlier than nor later than 15 
minutes from the scheduled beginning of the parenting time. The 
residential parent shall pick up the child(ren) from the nonresidential 
parent's residence no earlier than nor later than 15 minutes from the 
ending of the nonresidential parent’s parenting time.  On a school day, if 
the nonresidential parent’s parenting time begins or ends at the beginning 
or dismissal from school, the nonresidential parent shall pick up or drop off 
the child from school as may be necessary, or shall arrange for the child to 
be transported to or from child care as needed.   
Unless otherwise ordered by the court, parents who live more than 60 
miles apart will equally participate in the cost and effort of exchanging the 
child(ren) from one parent to the other.  

Makeup Of Missed Parenting Time. Only substantial medical reasons 
will be considered sufficient for postponement of parenting time.  If a child 
is ill and unable to visit, a makeup parenting time shall occur on the 
following weekend. If, however, the nonresidential parent fails to exercise 
his/her parenting time, there will be no makeup parenting time.  

Affection and Respect. Neither parent shall say things or willfully allow 
others to say things in the presence of the child(ren) that would harm the 
natural development of the child(ren)'s love and respect for the other 
parent.  

School Involvement. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, both parents 
are encouraged to participate in the child(ren)'s school activities including 
visiting the classroom, attending parent-teacher conferences, and sports 
activities.

Non-assigned Time. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the residential 
parent is responsible for the child(ren) during all times not awarded to the 
nonresidential parent.  

Failure To Comply. If a parent fails to comply with a provision of this plan, 
the other parent's obligations under the plan are not affected.  

Parenting Time is NOT the Child(ren)’s Decision.  The child(ren) will  
not be permitted to decide whether to participate in parenting time  
with the nonresidential parent.  The residential parent and the  
child(ren)’s personal plans, elective school activities, church  
activities, and other such considerations are not sufficient reasons  
to fail to follow the parenting time schedule.  However, the parents  
should both take the parenting time schedule into account when  
scheduling or planning activities for the child(ren).  The  
nonresidential parent shall transport the child(ren) to and from  
events regularly scheduled during the parent’s parenting time when  
to do so is reasonable and would not seriously interfere with the  
nonresidential parent’s time spent with the child(ren).  

10.  When the Children are in Different Age Groups.  When more than one  
child is subject to the terms of this parenting plan and the children would  
have different parenting time schedules due to their ages, the  
nonresidential parent shall have parenting time with all the children  
together under the schedule that applies to the youngest child, unless  
otherwise agreed by the parties.    

STARTING THE SCHEDULE.  If parenting time has not already begun, the 
nonresidential parent shall have the child(ren) on the second Friday following the 
entry of the Judgment.  The nonresidential parent shall continue to have 
parenting time/ contact with the children as set forth under any temporary order 
or restraining order in effect as of the date of judgment until the parenting plan 
set forth herein commences on the second Friday following entry of judgment.   

DISPUTE RESOLUTION.  The parents will attempt to cooperatively resolve any 
disputes that arise over the terms of the Parenting Plan. If the parents are unable 
to resolve a dispute, they are required to use mediation as a first recourse. Any 
cost for mediation shall be shared equally by the parents or as determined in the 
dispute resolution process. A written record shall be prepared of any agreement 
reached in mediation and shall be provided to each parent. If the parents are 
unable to resolve a dispute through any other dispute resolution process, the 
dispute shall be resolved through court action.

based on the school calendar, the parties shall use the school calendar for the

HOLIDAY AND VACATION PLANNING.  The holiday and vacation schedule  
overrides the residential schedule.  If the parents are “medium distance” from 
each other and the holiday schedule would prevent a parent from having the 
child(ren) for more than two consecutive weekends, the that parent shall have 
the child(ren) for weekend parenting time so that neither parent will go without 
having the child(ren) for more than two consecutive weekends.  Whether or not 
the child(ren) are enrolled in school, the child(ren) shall spend time with 
his/her/their parents on holidays according to the following plan:
