INTRODUCTION

In response to concerns regarding the abuse of the elderly and persons with disabilities
the 1995 Oregon Legislature enacted specific legislation to restrain such abuse.  The legislation
has been amended and expanded since its enactment.  While similar to provisions regarding
the Family Abuse Prevention Act (FAPA), the Elderly Persons and Persons With Disabilities
Abuse Prevention Act (EPPWDAPA) has some key distinctions meant to deal with specific
concerns and circumstances regarding the abuse of the elderly and persons with disabilities.
These differences include the type of alleged abuse that is actionable, potential remedies to
address such abuse, and the role of agents who can appear in these actions on behalf of an
elderly person or a person with a disability.

Under EPPWDAPA actions that can fall under the definition of abuse are expanded and
the court has greater remedial powers to address such abuse.  Under FAPA, abuse is generally
defined in terms of attempting, threatening, or using force to physically injure or coerce a victim. 
The definition of abuse under EPPWDAPA is expanded to include not only physical violence but
can also include the wrongful taking of property, neglect or failure to provide care or services,
abandonment, derogatory conduct that causes emotional harm, and even the mailing of
sweepstakes promotions.  To remedy such claims of abuse the court can not only restrain the
respondent from further contact with the victim, but can also order the respondent to return
money and property to the petitioner, divest control of property, and follow instructions given by
a guardian or conservator for the elderly person or the person with a disability.

EPPWDAPA allows this protection to be requested and put in place without the victim

appearing personally before the court.  Many times the victim may be too physically or mentally
incapacitated to be able to appear and advocate for themselves.  Other times the alleged victim
may not want the protection of the court for a variety of reasons, including their support for the
alleged abuser.  In these instances the law specifically allows a guardian or guardian ad litem to
apply for the relief without the presence of the alleged victim.  The alleged victim is only
required to be informed of the proceeding by written notice.  In the absence an objection from
the alleged victim, it is possible that he or she may never directly address the court except
through a guardian or guardian ad litem.  

The Elderly Persons and Persons With Disabilities Abuse Prevention Act is a powerful

legal tool to attempt to address abuse of the elderly and people with disabilities.  With the
increasing numbers of elderly persons and persons with disabilities in our society, applying this
specialized legal protection may unfortunately become more commonplace.  A full
understanding of the law and the circumstances regarding these potential victims is essential in
addressing these issues.  This bench guide is an attempt to aid the courts in this
understanding.

An Elderly Persons and Persons with Disabilities Abuse
Prevention Act (EPPWDAPA) petition may be filed only
in a county where the petitioner or the respondent
resides. 

1. Caveat: “Petitioner” and “guardian petitioner” are
separately defined.  When filling out forms, a
“guardian petitioner shall provide information about
the (elderly) person (or person with a disability),”
“rather than information about the petitioner.”  The
statute is not clear, therefore, whether the relevant
residence is that of the guardian petitioner, or the
residence of the elderly person or person with a
disability.

 An elderly person or a person or with a disability (or a
“guardian petitioner” on behalf of such a person) may
seek relief under EPPWDAPA when:

1.

Background.

a.

b.

The elderly person or person with a disability
has been the victim of “abuse,” as defined in
ORS 124.005(1) within the preceding 180
days; and

The elderly person or person with a disability
is “in immediate and present danger of further
abuse by the abuser.”

2.  Specific Definitions.

a.

Elderly Person.

Under EPPWDAPA, an “elderly person” is “a
person 65 years of age or older who is not
subject to ORS 441.640 to ORS 441.665.”

These statutes deal with the requirement to
report abuse of a resident of a long term care
facility.  The only persons who seem
technically to “be subject to” ORS 441.640 to
ORS 441.685 are persons who are required to

make reports.  This plain reading of the
statute results in what is apparently the correct
result.  i.e. despite the restrictions that initially
appear to restrict the court from granting relief
under EPPWDAPA simply because a victim is
a resident of a nursing home or other long
term care facility, a close reading of the
statutes in question appears to render this
restriction a nullity.  Any other interpretation
would have the inconsistent result of allowing
a person with a disability who lives in a long
term care facility to avail herself or himself of
the protections of ORS 124.005 et seq, while
restricting elderly residents of the same facility
from receiving the same protections.

b.  Person With A Disability.

A “person with a disability” is a person who

I)  Meets the criteria in ORS 410.040(7)(b)
by being a person with a mental or
physical disability who is:

i) mentally retarded, developmentally
disabled, or mentally or emotionally
disturbed and resides in or needs
placement in a residential program
administered by the Department of
Human Services; or

ii)

an alcohol or drug abuser and
resides in or needs placement in a
residential program administered by
the Department of Human Services;
or

iii)  Otherwise has a physical or mental

disability; or

II)  Suffers brain injury caused by extrinsic
forces which results in the person
suffering a loss of cognitive,
psychological, social, behavioral or
physiological function for a sufficient time
to affect that person’s ability to perform
activities of daily living.

c. Guardian Petitioner.

A guardian petitioner is a guardian or a
guardian ad litem for an elderly person or a

ORS 124.005(8)(a); 
ORS 410.040(7)(b)

Abuse.

person with a disability who files a petition
under ORS 124.005 to ORS 124.040 on
behalf of the person.

Note: The elderly person or person with a
disability retains rights to be represented,
have access to records, file objections,
request a hearing, and present evidence
and cross examine witnesses if a
guardian petitioner files an EPPWDAPA
petition.

Unlike the Family Abuse Prevention Act
(FAPA), the EPPWDAPA does not limit
“abuse” to that between family or household
members.  “Abuse” under the EPPWDAPA
means any of the following:

I)

Any physical injury caused by other than
accidental means or that appears
inconsistent with the explanation given of
the injury;

II) Neglect that leads to physical harm

through withholding services necessary
to maintain health and well-being;

willfully forsaking an elderly person or a
person with a disability, or withdrawing or
neglecting duties and obligations that a
care giver or other person owes an
elderly person or a person with a
disability;

IV) Willfully inflicting physical pain or injury; 

V) Using derogatory or inappropriate names,

phrases or profanity, ridicule,
harassment, coercion, threats, cursing,
intimidation, or inappropriate sexual
comments or conduct of such a nature as
to threaten significant physical or
emotional harm to the elderly person or
person with a disability;

(Note the potential for use of the
EPPWDAPA process by participants
in a domestic situation, particularly
relating to dissolution of marriage or
separation, involving persons over

ORS 124.005(1)(c)

III) Abandonment, including deserting or

March 2008

VII) Wrongfully taking or appropriating money

65 years of age, or persons with a
disability, who may seek to gain
advantages where the situation does
not rise to a level where relief could
be granted under FAPA.  See also
ORS 124.010(4) requiring disclosure
of any such pending proceedings.)

VI) Causing any sweepstakes promotion to
be mailed to an elderly person or a
person with a disability who spent more
than $500 in the preceding year on
sweepstakes, provided that the elderly
person or person with a disability
represented to the court that the person
felt the need for the court’s assistance to
prevent the person from incurring further
expense;

or property, or knowingly subjecting an
elderly person or a person with a
disability, to alarm by conveying a threat
to wrongfully take or appropriate property
of the person, which threat would
reasonably be expected to cause the
person to believe that the threat would be
carried out; or 

This case discusses “wrongful” and
“taking” in the context of a similar
statute, ORS 124.100, which relates
to civil actions for abuse of
vulnerable persons.  Of particular
note is the court’s discussion of
“improper motive” and “improper
means” as they relate the concept
“wrongful;” as well as the court’s
discussion of what constitutes a
taking, especially as regards joint
ownership, right of survivorship, etc.
regarding both real and personal
property, and regarding both
tangible and intangible property.

VIII) Sexual contact with a nonconsenting

elderly person or person with a disability
considered incapable of consenting to a
sexual act as described in ORS 163.315
(statutory rape), and as defined in ORS

I.

Notice to Elderly Person or Person with a Disability

If an EPPWDAPA petition is filed by a guardian
petitioner, that person must give notice to the
elderly person or the person with a disability or the
petition, order, and related forms described in ORS
124.020(6), and must also serve on that person a
notice that contains a statement of that person’s

to the court.

This notice must be personally served on the
elderly person or person with a disability not later
than 72 hours after the court issues a restraining
order under ORS 124.020.

The statute is not clear what the result is if such
service is not completed within 72 hours.

This notice must be personally served on the
elderly person or person and proof of service
thereof filed in the proceeding before a contested
hearing can be held pursuant to ORS 124.015.

The statute is not clear as to the result when a
petition filed by a guardian petitioner, if service on
the elderly person or person with a disability is not
obtained, but the respondent requests a hearing,
and the 21 day period within which the hearing
must be held runs.

J. Clerk’s Duties

1.

Information.

The court clerk has several duties under EPPWDAPA.

The court clerk must give the elderly person
information provided by the Department of Human
Resources about local adult protective services,
domestic violence shelters, and local legal services

case law, and comments from judges and court
staff who review the updates.) 

3. Copies.

If the court allows the petition, the clerk of the court
must provide, without charge, the number of
certified true copies of the petition and order
necessary to effect service on the respondent.  The
court clerk must also deliver a true copy of the
petition and order to the county sheriff for service,
unless the court finds service is unnecessary
because respondent appeared in person in court.

4. Notify Petitioner if Documents Returned by Sheriff.

If the sheriff returns the order and petition to the
court, because they are incomplete, the Clerk shall
notify the Petitioner or Guardian Petitioner.

5.

If Service Not Achieved by Sheriff.

shall notify the petitioner or guardian petitioner, and
if that person does not respond within 10 days, the
sheriff shall file a return to the clerk showing
service was not completed.

6.

Provide Hearing Request Form, and Give Notice of
Hearing.

The respondent, or the elderly person or the
person with a disability, may request a court
hearing upon any relief granted within 30 days after
being served with an EPPWDAPA restraining order

request form in substantially the form provided in
statute.  The clerk shall also notify the petitioner or

A. Ex Parte Hearing Required

An EPPWDAPA petitioner is entitled to an ex parte
hearing, in person or by telephone, on the same day

B. Testimony May Establish Required Showing

EPPWDAPA explicitly provides that the required
showing may be made by testimony of the elderly
person or person with a disability, a guardian or a
guardian ad litem of the person, witnesses to the
abuse, or adult protective services workers who
have conducted an investigation.

further abuse to the person.

f.

Note that many of these terms are defined
and discussed above, and that their statutory
definitions may be different from the more
common meanings of some of these terms.

Forms printed in accordance with statute, including
the pre-printed form for the Order, contain errors, in
that they fail to clarify that “petitioner” should often
be interpreted as “elderly person or person with a
disability.”  Although there is a statutory correction
(ORS 124.020(5) ) in this regard for forms to be
filled out by the petitioner or guardian petitioner,
there is no such statutory correction for the form of
the Order.  The court should, nonetheless, make
this substitution where common sense dictates, as,
for example, in the section requiring a finding that
there has been abuse of “the petitioner.”

Note also the discussion above regarding the
potential use of the EPPWDAPA process by
persons who may be seeking advantages in
dissolution proceedings, as also discussed above,
and the requirement that any such proceedings
which are pending be reported to the court per
ORS 124.010(4).

C. Burden and Standard of Proof

As outlined above, the petitioner or guardian petitioner
has the burden of proof in this and all hearings under
EPPWDAPA, with the standard of a preponderance of
the evidence.

III. RELIEF

A. Mandatory (Not Discretionary) Relief

At the initial hearing the court must order the following
relief if petitioner or guardian petitioner requests it, and
the court finds that:

the elderly person or person with a disability is
in immediate and present danger of further
abuse by respondent.

Note: When a guardian petitioner files a petition, and
appears at the ex parte hearing, the elderly person or
person with a disability may or may not be present at
this ex parte hearing.  However, issues may not be
raised at this ex parte hearing regarding an objection to
the requested relief or regarding other wishes of the
elderly person or person with a disability.  Such issues
are to be addressed through the objection hearing
process under ORS 124.020 as set forth below in
section IV.  Relief requested by a guardian petitioner, if
legally appropriate, is to be granted by the court at this
ex parte hearing, as the court is without discretion in
many of these matters if the specific relief is requested
by the guardian petitioner, although the guardian
petitioner may have discretion as to whether to request
such relief.  

1.   Restraint from further abuse

Order that the respondent be restrained from doing
the following to the elderly person or person with a
disability:

b.

Intimidating, defined as compelling or
deterring conduct by a threat;

c. Molesting, defined as annoying, disturbing, or
persecuting with hostile intent or injurious
effect;

d.

If requested by petitioner or guardian petitioner,
order that respondent be restrained from entering,
or attempting to enter, any premises if the court
deems it necessary to prevent respondent from
abusing, intimidating, molesting, interfering with or
menacing the elderly person or person with a
disability.

3. Ouster

If requested by petitioner or guardian petitioner,
order respondent to move out of the residence of
the elderly person or person with a disability if:

the residence is solely in name of the elderly
person or person with a disability; or

the elderly person or person with a disability
and the respondent jointly own or rent the
residence; or

the respondent is married to the elderly
person or person with a disability.

4.

Police “Standby” for Essential Personal Property

If requested by petitioner or guardian petitioner, order
that a peace officer accompany the party moving from
the residence of the elderly person or person with a
disability to remove essential personal effects.

The peace officer may temporarily interrupt
the removal of property at any time. 

Police “standby” is available on only one
occasion.

identification and tools of the trade.

Note: The statute does not define essential
personal effects but see ORS 107.718(d) which
deals with FAPA restraining orders and lists the
above items as essential personal property.

5.

Security Amount

Specify the amount of the bond for violation of the
restraining order.  Although the statutory form
specifies a default bond amount at $5,000, the
court may impose a higher or lower security
amount.

6. Notice to Respondent

Notice of respondent’s right to request a hearing
must accompany order in order to comply with the
statute.

7. Notice to Elderly Person or Person With a Disability

Guardian petitioners must give notice of petition,
order, and related forms described in ORS
124.020(6) to the elderly person or person with a
disability named in the petition.

Such notice must be provided within seventy-two
hours after the court issues a restraining order
under ORS 124.020.

8.    Sweepstakes Promotions

In addition to restraining the respondent from
mailing any sweepstakes promotion to the elderly
person or person with a disability, the court can
order the respondent to:

disability from the sweepstakes mailing list
(within 150 days of the date the order is
entered); or place the elderly person or person
with a disability on a list of persons to whom
the promotions may not be mailed; and

Immediately refund any payment received in
any form from the elderly person or person
with a disability after the court order is

B. Discretionary Relief

1.

Authority to Order the Return of Wrongfully
Appropriated Money or Property 

If the court finds that the elderly person or person
with a disability has been the victim of abuse as
defined in ORS 124.005(1)(g) the court may order
only that relief which the court considers necessary
to prevent or remedy the wrongful taking or
appropriation of the money or property of the
elderly person or person with a disability, including
but not limited to the relief which is set forth below
at III.B.1.a through d.

Note: ORS 124.005(1)(g): includes the
following as one definition of abuse. 
“Wrongfully taking or appropriating money or
property, or knowingly subjecting an elderly
person or person with disabilities to alarm by
conveying a threat to wrongfully take or
appropriate money or property, which threat
reasonably would be expected to cause the
elderly person or person with a disabilities to
believe that the threat will be carried out.”

Note: see Church v. Woods, 190 Or. App.
112, 118-9, 77 P.3d 1150 (2003) (internal
citations omitted.) defining wrongfully:
“[Wrongfully's] ordinary meaning is full of
wrong: INJURIOUS, UNJUST, UNFAIR.” 
More specifically, it has a well-understood
meaning in the law of torts with regard to
interference with legal interests. Conduct
generally is “wrongful” if it is carried out in
pursuit of an improper motive or by improper
means.  “Improper means” must be
independently wrongful by reason of statutory
or common law, beyond the mere fact of the
injury complained of.  Improper means, for
example, include violence, threats,
intimidation, deceit, misrepresentation,
bribery, unfounded litigation, defamation and
disparaging falsehood.  The use of undue
influence also constitutes an “improper
means,” in that it involves the procurement of
an unfair advantage.  That dual meaning of
the word “wrongful,” focusing alternatively on
the defendant's motives or the means by

exercising control over the money or property of
the elderly person or person with a disability;

b. Requiring the respondent to return custody or

control of the money or property of the elderly
person or person with a disability to him or her;

instructions of the guardian or conservator of the
elderly person or person with a disability; or

d.

Prohibiting the respondent from transferring the
money or property of the elderly person or person
with a disability to any person other than the elderly
person or person with a disability.

Note: The statutory order form does not list the above
options as possible relief and therefore a pro se
petitioner may not know to write them in the “other relief”
requested section of the form.  The court should inquire
if petitioner wants to include any of these options when
executing an order where petitioner has alleged the
money or property has been wrongfully appropriated.

Note: As noted below there are other consequences to
ordering the return of property.  At the ex parte hearing
the respondent has had no opportunity to contest
ownership of the allegedly wrongfully obtained property. 
ORS 133.310(3) requires a peace office to arrest and
take into custody a person without a warrant when the
officer has probable cause to believe that person has
been served with a restraining order and has violated
that order.  A respondent in possession of allegedly
wrongfully obtained property would therefore be subject
to mandatory arrest.

ORS 124.020(1)(f)

C. Additional Discretionary Relief

The court may order any additional relief it considers
necessary to provide for the safety and welfare of the
elderly person or person with a disability.

D. Limits on Relief 

The court may not use a restraining order issued under
ORS 124.005 to 124.040 to: 

1.

2.

Allow any person other than the elderly person or
person with a disability to assume responsibility for
managing any money or property of the elderly
person or person with a disability; 

Provide relief that is more appropriately obtained in
a protective proceeding filed under ORS chapter
125 (Protective Proceedings). 

This includes, but is not limited to, giving
control or management of the financial
accounts or property of the elderly person or
person with a disability for any purpose other
than necessary to prevent or remedy the
wrongful taking or appropriation of money
described in 124.005(1)(g). 

E. Entry Into Law Enforcement Data System

1.  When a EPPWDAPA restraining order is issued
and the person to be restrained has actual notice
thereof, the clerk of the court shall deliver:

 

a true copy of the affidavit of proof of service,

a copy of the petition, and 

a true copy of the order to a county sheriff.

2. Upon receipt of the order the county sheriff shall
entered the order into the Law Enforcement Data
System (LEDS), which gives notice to all law
enforcement agencies of the order.  The order will
be fully enforceable in any county in the state.

G. Dismissal

1.

By Written Order

The court may dismiss a restraining order at any
time, but only by written order.

EPPWDAPA provides no specific standard or
guidance for dismissal of restraining orders, and
court practices vary considerably.  ORCP 54(A)(1)
permits dismissal without court order upon filing of
a notice by the plaintiff.  

2. Notarized Signature Required

A restraining order  entered under ORS 124.020
can be terminated upon a motion for dismissal by
the petitioner or guardian petitioner, only if the
motion is notarized.

H. Renewals

1.

For Good Cause Shown

The court may renew an EPPWDAPA order for
“good cause shown” regardless of whether there
has been further abuse.  

2. Due process may require notice to respondent and
an opportunity for a hearing on the renewal.

I.

Early Termination

When the order is terminated before it expires, the clerk
of the court must deliver a true copy of the termination
order to the sheriff with whom the original order was
filed.  The sheriff must then remove the original order
from the Law Enforcement Data System.

IV. THE CONTESTED HEARING PROCESS

Either the respondent or the elderly person or person with a
disability (in a case brought by a guardian petitioner) may
request a hearing to object to the order or to its particular
provisions.

A. Contested Hearing Requests

1.

Timing

ORS 124.020(9)(a)

The respondent or the elderly person or person
with a disability must request the hearing within 30
days after the restraining order is served on the

2.

Forms

The clerk must make the hearing request form
available substantially in the form provided in ORS
124.020(6).

B. Scheduling the Contested Hearing

However if respondent or the elderly person or
person with a disability causes or contributes
to the delay, the 21-day rule may not apply. 
Per Strother and Strother, 130 Or App 624,
630, 883 P2d 249 (1994), rev den 320 Or 508
(1995), if the delay is attributable to the person
requesting the hearing, the hearing may be
postponed beyond 21 days in an appropriate
circumstance.

2.

If respondent or the elderly person or person with a
disability is represented by counsel and another
party so requests, the court may extend the time
for hearing up to five (5) days, to allow other parties
to seek representation.

C. Contested Hearing Notice Requirements

The clerk of the court shall notify all parties of a
scheduled contested hearing, and the petitioner or
guardian petitioner shall give the clerk sufficient
information to allow such notification.

D. Settlement

1.

The court can approve any consent agreement to
bring about a cessation of the abuse.

2. However, the settlement cannot provide for

restraint of a party unless the other party petitioned
for and was granted an order under ORS 124.010. 

3.

Thus, the settlement cannot provide for mutual
restraint unless both parties petitioned for and
received orders under ORS 124.010.  

ORS 124.020(2)(b)(A)

4.

In addition, the court cannot use a restraining order

5. Nor can the court use a restraining order under

E. Subject Matter of Contested Hearing

under ORS 124.005 to 124.040 to allow a person
other than the elderly person or the person with a
disability to assume responsibility for managing the
money or property of the person.

ORS 124.005 to 124.040 to grant relief that is more
appropriately filed under ORS chapter 125
(protective proceedings, including guardianships
and conservatorships).

The EPPWDAPA hearing is not limited to issues
that respondent raised in the request for hearing.

The EPWPDAPA hearing may include testimony
from witnesses to the abuse and from adult
protective services workers.

Although not specified in ORS 124.020(9), other
witnesses may, of course, also testify, as may be
appropriate.

If the respondent, elderly person, or person with a
disability seeks to raise an issue at the hearing not
previously raised in the request form, the petitioner
or guardian petitioner is entitled to a reasonable
continuance to prepare a response.

F. Contested Hearing Procedures

EPPWDAPA does not specify what takes place at
the hearing.

The court, during the hearing, must exercise its
discretion to protect the elderly person or person
with a disability from traumatic confrontation with
respondent.

3.

The EPPWDAPA contested hearing may be held in
person or by phone.

4. Nothing in EPPWDAPA specifically overrides ORS
45.400 relating to telephone testimony, which
requires 30 days prior written notice of telephone
testimony, but which allows shorter notice if good
cause is shown.

5. ORS 45.400 contains significant restrictions setting
forth situations when telephone testimony is not
allowed.

G. Evidentiary Issues

1.

The Oregon Evidence Code applies to
EPPWDAPA hearings.

2.   The burden of proof is on the petitioner or guardian

petitioner to prove a claim by a preponderance of
evidence.

H. Available Relief

1.

The court may cancel or change any order issued
under ORS 124.020.

2. ORS 124.015 provides relief that is “in addition to
the relief granted under ORS 124.020.”  See
Section III., above, for relief available under ORS
124.020.  In addition to that relief, under ORS
124.015, the court may also order any of the
following:

a. Require either party to move from any

residence whose title or right to occupy is held
jointly by the parties.

As with many other situations, although
the statute speaks of “either party” in this
circumstance, this appears to be a
function of the fact that the statute was
not comprehensively revised when it was
changed to allow for petitions by guardian
petitioners.  When this portion of the
statute was written, the only “parties”
were the respondent and the elderly
person or person with a disability.

The court may assess against any party
reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in
the hearing.

The court may approve a consent agreement
to bring about a cessation of abuse.  There
are significant restrictions on the content of
settlement agreements and restraining orders
that are available, however, despite the initial

FOREIGN RESTRAINING ORDERS

See FAPA Benchguide for a discussion of the general
statutory provisions regarding foreign restraining orders and
their effect.

VI. CONTEM PT—REM EDIAL AND PUNITIVE SANCTIONS

A. Enforcement

Notwithstanding ORS chapter 90 (Landlord and Tenant
Law) and ORS sections 105.105 to 105.168 (FED
statute), a petitioner may enforce an order issued under
EPPWDAPA.

B. Contempt Proceedings

As under FAPA, EPPWDAPA restraining orders are
enforced through ORS chapter 33 contempt
proceedings.

1.

See FAPA Benchguide on contempt procedures
and remedial and punitive sanctions.

2. Note that ORS 166.293(3)(a) (providing the court
authority to revoke a concealed weapons permit)
does not apply when an EPPWDAPA order is
violated.

3

Pending a contempt hearing for violation of an
EPPWDAPA restraining order, a person arrested
and taken into custody pursuant to ORS 133.310
may be released as provided in ORS 135.230 to
135.290.
