Purpose and History of the Glossary 

 
At the annual meeting of the Consortium for Court Interpreter Certification in July 1998, 
it was agreed that a master glossary of all terms typical of those used in any member state 
would be compiled.  This glossary is the result of that effort.  It represents a compilation 
of terms drawn from: 

 

 

  Glossary of Selected Legal Terms, English-Vietnamese, Office of the 
Administrator for the Courts, State of Washington 
  New Jersey Administrative Office of the Courts staff and interpreters 
  Glossary of Terms, National Association for Court Management 
and other glossary sources from the state court systems states of Maryland and 
Florida  
 

The purpose of creating the glossary is twofold:  

1) to provide a core set of legal terms in English as a base document for the 
preparation of dictionaries or glossaries in languages for which no other published 
dictionaries or glossaries exist, and  
2) to provide  a source document for the selection of technical terms that are 
included on oral performance exams prepared by the Consortium for Language 
Access in the Courts. 

he glossary obviously is neither comprehensive nor complete; it is merely a 

compendium of selected terms collected under one cover as of the printing date.  Other 
terms will be added from time to time as resources permit.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
