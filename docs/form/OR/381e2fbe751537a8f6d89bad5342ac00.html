      <pre>View From The Bench

Kids ask the hardest questions

by Hon. Rick Haselton
Oregon Court of Appeals

Note: The author reminds readers that the
views expressed here are solely his own and
do not represent those of his colleagues in-
dividually or of the Oregon Court of Ap-
peals as an institution.

For the last four years, the Court of

Appeals  has  held  oral  arguments,
roughly once a month during the school
year, at high schools and middle schools
around  Oregon,  from  Coos  Bay  to  La
Grande, from Newport to Klamath Falls,
and  dozens  of  locations  in  between.
Many OTLA member lawyers have par-
ticipated as counsel in our “road show”
arguments, and many others have helped
prepare the students in their communi-
ties for our visits. When the arguments
are completed, we take questions from
the students and often visit their class-
rooms later to engage in further Q&A.
Those unscripted sessions have pro-
duced the most candid interchanges be-
tween judges and citizens that I’ve wit-
nessed. Because the students are fearless
and ingenuous, the questions often go
to the heart of who we are and how we
perceive, and perform, our work. Other
questions are, predictably, silly (as are our
responses). Regardless, I’ve often thought
that, if I were still in practice, I’d love to
be  in  that  classroom  or  auditorium.
Hence,  my  top  ten  “road  show”  ques-

tions, with my responses:

Question 1: What are the hardest cases?
Answer: Cases involving children—espe-
cially termination of parental rights and
custody fights.

Why?  Because  they  are  so  personal
and emotional, because we have de novo
review, and because, no matter what you
do, there’s (almost) always some doubt.
They are so permanent—people’s lives are
changed forever; things will never be the
same. There are lots of cases with hard,
close legal issues, but I leave those at the
office. It’s the kid cases that wake me up
in the middle of the night.

Question  2:  Do  your  personal  back-
ground  and  beliefs  affect  how  you  de-
cide a case?
Answer: Judges are not computers. We’re
people and, like everyone else, we bring
our life experiences to our work. That’s
natural and inevitable. I’d be lying to you
if  I  said  that,  at  least  at  some  subcon-
scious level, our experiences never affect
how we look at a case.

With that said, the challenge is to try
to be aware of those influences and to
check, and double check, yourself. You
can’t begin a case by subconsciously pull-
ing  for  one  side.  You  can’t  begin  with
some  preconceived  idea  of  the  “right”
outcome,  based  on  some  personal
agenda, and then work backwards so that
your reasoning fits that result. If you did,

Hon. Rick Haselton

the judicial system would lose its cred-
ibility—and, in the end, that’s all it has.
Credibility. Instead, you have to disci-
pline yourself to be indifferent about the
outcome. That sounds heartless—but if
you deal honestly with the facts and the
law,  the  results  will  almost  always  be
“just” (even if occasionally distasteful).

Question 3: Have you ever decided a case
where, looking back, you wish you could
change the result?
Answer: Yes. There are two or three deci-
sions from my first few years on the court
that  I  wish  I  could  take  back  (I  won’t
identify  them).  I  suspect  that  many
judges feel the same way. Some of that is
experience;  some  of  that  is  that  we  all
change; and some of that is that no one
bats 1,000. You do your best, learn, and
move on.

continued from p 3

However,  for  me,  much  more  fre-
quently I wish I could change my rea-
soning.  One  of  the  really  intimidating
aspects of our work is that once we write
an  opinion  and  it’s  published  in  the
bound volumes for the whole world to
see, it’s there forever and it’s binding —
unless the Supreme Court reverses us or
we  overrule  ourselves,  which  happens
very rarely. Thus, anything you write can
— and often will — come back to bite
you.  The  real  lesson,  which  I’m  still
learning,  is  that  it’s  usually  best  to  say
less, not more.

Question 4: Do you worry about public
reaction to your opinions?
Answer:  Sometimes,  yes—initially.  It’s
involuntary and instinctive. But the real
question is what do you do next?

Sooner  or  later,  almost  every  judge
will be faced with rendering some really
controversial and unpopular decision—
like striking down an initiative or grant-
ing a convicted murderer or rapist a new
trial. You know what the reaction is go-
ing  to  be.  You  know  that  it  may  hurt
your chances to be reelected—and, be-
lieve me, it’s no fun being the bum of
the week on talk radio.

But then you do your duty—or try
to, as well as you can. You do that be-
cause  you’ve  taken  an  oath.  You  do  it
because any judge who pulls his or her
punches isn’t worthy of the job. When
you start looking over your shoulder, it’s
time to hang it up. You do it because of
history, because of your colleagues’ trust,
and because, in the end, you have to live
with  yourself.  In  my  ten  years  on  the
Court of Appeals, I’ve never seen a single
vote affected by concern about adverse
public reaction.

I’m not saying that it’s easy. And I’m
not saying that we’re heroes. It’s just the
way it is.

Question 5: What are your most memo-
rable (or grossest) cases?

4

Trial Lawyer (cid:127) Summer 2004

Answer: At least three are both memo-
rable and “gross”:
(cid:127) Penland  v.  Redwood  Sanitary  Sewer
Service  District,  156  Or.  App.  311,
965 P2d 433 (1998) Affirming an in-
junction against a sewerage district’s
“Jo-Gro” operation, which converted
human waste to fertilizer, generating
“unbearably  nauseating”  odor;
composting  operation  held  to  be  a
nuisance.

(cid:127) Brown v. Washington County, 153 Or.
App. 367, 987 P2d 1254 (1999) Af-
ter escaping from county correctional
facility because he suspected that his
wife was having an affair, an inmate
found his wife in bed with his brother,
and killed his brother with an axe. The
brother’s widow successfully sued the
county for, inter alia, “custodial neg-
ligence,” and the Court of Appeals af-
firmed the jury’s award.

(cid:127) Turudic v. Stephens, 176 Or. App. 175,
31  P3d  465  (2001)  Homeowners’
maintenance  of  two  pet  cougars  on
their  property  did  not  violate
subdivision’s  CC&Rs.  Neighbors’
ostensibly retaliatory placement of a
purple “port-a-potty” on their prop-
erty in front of the cougar owners’ pic-
ture  window,  so  as  to  impair  their
view, violated CC&Rs.
As  for  purely  “memorable”  cases,

there are many—but here are a few:
(cid:127) Picray  v.  Secretary  of  State,  140  Or.
App. 592, 916 P2d 324, affirmed by
an equally divided court, 325 Or. 279
(1996) Striking down a statute that
prohibited wearing of any “political
badge, button or other insignia” in a
polling place, as violating free expres-
sion protections of the Oregon Con-
stitution.

(cid:127) Lakin v. Senco Products, 144 Or. App.
52, 925 P2d 107 (1996), aff ’d, 329
Or. 62, 987 P2d 463 (1999) Affirm-
ing product liability verdict in favor
of a plaintiff who was grievously in-
jured when a nail gun malfunctioned,
shooting a roofing nail into his brain.
(cid:127) Hanzo v. De Parrie, 152 Or. App. 525,

953 P2d 1130 (1998) Reversing is-
suance of civil stalking protective or-
der against an anti-abortion activist,
where  the  predicate  “contacts”  in-
volved constitutionally protected ex-
pression.

(cid:127) McCathern v. Toyota Motor Corp., 160
Or. App. 201, 985 P2d 804 (1999),
aff ’d, 332 Or. 59, 23 P3d 320 (2001)
Affirming  award  of  damages  to  the
plaintiff in a catastrophic vehicle roll-
over  case;  exploring  contours  of
Oregon’s “consumer expectation” test.
(cid:127) State v. Thorp, 166 Or. App. 564, 2
P3d  903  (2000)  (Haselton,  J.,  dis-
senting),  dismissed,  332  Or.  559
(2001)  Addressing  whether  imposi-
tion  of  75-month  Measure  11  sen-
tence  on  a  16-year-old  defendant,
who was convicted of statutory rape
for  engaging  in  consensual  inter-
course with his 13-year-old girlfriend,
violated  the  proportionality  provi-
sions of the Oregon Constitution.

Question  6:  How  do  you  balance  your
work and your family/home life?
Answer:  Not  as  well  as  I’d  like—and
sometimes, not very well at all. Too of-
ten, to be honest, my family loses out.
Over time, though, I think I’ve gotten
better,  not  just  because  I’ve  become
somewhat  more  efficient,  but  also  be-
cause of a talk I had with one of my old
law partners a couple of years ago. My
friend was, and is, very wise—he’d done
it all and seen it all. He pointed at the
leather-bound  volumes  in  which  our
opinions are published and said, “When
you die, do you think that they are go-
ing to mourn you or remember you? Do
you really think that anyone’s going to
read  that  [expletive  deleted]  50  years
from now?” I try to remember that.

Question  7:  If  you  could  change  one
thing in your job, what would it be?
Answer: The  volume  of  our  work,  and
particularly  the  reading.  Because  we
don’t have any discretion to turn appeals
away—to  “turn  off  the  spigot”—every

month more and more cases come in,
and you feel like you’re running just one
step ahead of an avalanche. Sometimes
the avalanche catches you.

Because of all the reading, you feel
as if you never have enough time to do
what is most important—to really think
and write. You’re constantly scrambling
to free up some uninterrupted time. Be-
yond that, there’s another real danger:
The Court of Appeals has always prided
itself  on  treating  each  case  individu-
ally—that  is,  we  try  to  keep  in  mind
just how important each case is to the
parties, even if it might not be to any-
one else. At some point, however, the
volume  of  work  and  our  fatigue  can
undercut that ethic, that sense that each
case is important. Still, I have no solu-
tion.

Question 8: What do your law clerks do?
Answer: More than anything else, my law
clerk keeps me out of trouble. Even as a
kid, I was always too sure of myself—at
least when it came to arguments. And I
never  had  much  patience  for  working
through  the  steps  of  a  problem—I  al-
ways wanted to jump ahead to get to the
“fun stuff.” That can get you into trouble
in math, and it can get you into trouble
in law. So when I sit down with my law
clerks  on  their  first  day  of  work,  I  tell
them that their primary responsibility is
to  make  me  slow  down,  to  make  me
think, to keep me from becoming com-
placent, and to tell me when I’m wrong.
What that means in practical terms
is that we will discuss cases before and
after oral argument and brainstorm dif-
ferent approaches. They will draft opin-
ions, talking with me frequently, so that
we  can  wrestle  through  problems  to-
gether.  And  then,  after  they  draft  an
opinion, and I work it over with lots of
red  ink  (just  as  your  teachers  do  with
your  term  papers),  we  discuss  and  de-
bate those changes. Of course, the final
call is, and must be, mine—and then we
move on to the next case, starting all over
again.

Question 9: Do you guys hang out to-
gether outside of work?
Answer: Not very much. At work, we do
spend  a  lot  of  time  together,  chatting
about  cases,  and  sometimes  going  out
for lunch—and some of us car pool to-
gether. We’ll also sometimes attend ju-
dicial conferences or retreats, to discuss
court-related problems. But unlike when
I  was  a  practicing  lawyer,  it’s  rare  that
we’ll go out after work or on the week-
ends to have a few beers, catch a movie
or see a ball game. I’m not sure why—
we  certainly  like  one  another  well
enough—it may just be that we’re older
and have other commitments. Still, one
of the judges has organized court-wide
bowling  parties  and  a  pool  party,  and
people had a lot of fun with those.

Question 10: If you weren’t a judge, what
would you be?
Answer:  Either  a  high  school  history
teacher or shortstop for the Red Sox.

For extra credit, five bonus questions:
Question 11: Have you ever broken the
law?

Answer: I’ll take the Fifth....
Question 12: Why do judges wear robes
(and what’s under them)?
Answer: They  cover  a  lot  of  imperfec-
tions.
Question 13: What is the difference be-
tween the Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment and the Privi-
leges and Immunities Clause of the Or-
egon Constitution?
Answer: You’ve  got  to  be  kidding.  Ask
your mother or your father. (This ques-
tion was asked by a middle schooler—
and I knew that both of her parents were
attorneys.)
Question 14: How much do you make?
Answer: Every time we have one of these
school settings, someone asks that ques-
tion—and I can never remember.
Question  15:  Was  that  lawyer  getting
paid?
Answer : Yes, but not by us.
