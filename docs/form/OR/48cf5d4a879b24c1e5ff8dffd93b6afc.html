I. 

RECOMMENDATIONS  

 

The SFLAC Parental Involvement Workgroup makes the following recommendations: 

•  Parent education should be based on the core concepts of parent attunement to children’s 

needs and fostering healthy, post-separation parenting relationships.  Content and 

methods should draw from a broad research base and continue to evolve.  

•  The court and all other professionals involved in promoting or explaining the required 

parent education class should make clear that the class is specifically for 

divorcing/separating parents (vs. a general parenting skills class) and is designed to 

support them through this family change.  Parents of minor children at all ages should be 

expected to complete the class.  Non-parent custodians should be encouraged to enroll if 

the class is able to accommodate them.  

•  Materials available to parents regarding parent education classes (handouts, websites, 

recorded phone messages, etc.) should emphasize positive messages about the benefits of 

the class over the negative messages about the consequences for not completing the class.  

•  Classes should be offered regularly to attorneys and other professionals for continuing 

education credit so the professionals are encouraged to keep abreast of the current 

curriculum and can inform their clients of the benefits as well as requirements. 

•  Parents should be encouraged by the court, attorneys and mediators to complete the class 

early in the process, and if possible, even before a court matter is filed. 

•  Courts should consider offering positive incentives (i.e. discounted class fee) to parents 

who complete the class before or within thirty days of filing or being served.   

PARENT EDUCATION REPORT OF SFLAC PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT WORKGROUP – PAGE 2 OF 9 

 

•  Courts should look for ways to remove systemic barriers by supporting a timely 

 

enrollment process, reasonable class sizes, language accommodations and clear rules for 

protecting personal safety. 

•  Parents should be afforded options to complete the class in an alternative way (online, 

video, in another county), if it taking it in person would pose a hardship in their own 

county. Parents should be encouraged to supplement the required class with additional 

educational resources to continue to expand their knowledge. 

II. 

BACKGROUND AND DISCUSSION IN SUPPORT OF RECOMMENDATIONS  

A. 

AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY 

A parent filing for divorce, separation or other matter resulting in a parenting plan may 

only have one contact with a professional during the process. Parent education is the one 

requirement that applies to all parents whether they are co-petitioners, self-represented, work 

with an attorney or mediator. The class may be our only opportunity to focus parents’ attention 

on the needs of their children during and after the separation. The importance of this intervention 

cannot be underestimated if we want to give children and families the best possible chance to 

adjust and form healthy post-separation relationships.  The broader community is beginning to 

appreciate the importance of parental behavior on infant attachment and early childhood 

development.  Contemporary research confirms that the choices parents make at this vulnerable 

time are equally critical for adolescent developmental needs.  Contrary to earlier assumptions 

about adolescent individuation and developmental competence, new research on adolescence 

reveals the brain does not reach adult maturity until age 25. This information spotlights the 

continued vulnerability of older adolescents to family stressors and parental 

conflict and underscores the critical role of ongoing parental involvement and support for older 

PARENT EDUCATION REPORT OF SFLAC PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT WORKGROUP – PAGE 3 OF 9 

 
adolescents.  The court needs to support and encourage parents and parental figures for children 

of all ages to engage in the parent education classes, rather than allow parents of older children to 

 

opt out. 

B. 

THE BASICS 

ORS 3.425(b) provides a starting point for what a parent education class must include in 

its curriculum: (a) The emotional impact of a dissolution of marriage or a separation on children 

at different developmental stages; (b) Parenting during and after a dissolution of marriage or a 

separation; (c) Custody, parenting time and shared parenting plans; (d) The effect on children of 

parental conduct including, but not limited to, long distance parenting; and (e) Mediation and 

conflict resolution.   

There is current research that gives further guidance on what educational factors can 

influence parents’ post-separation behavior. A child-focused curriculum and the opportunity for 

parents to participate in the class appear to be important components, as well as the timing of the 

service. Several studies with skills-based parent education classes (as opposed to those that 

consist of mostly lecture or those that focus on inducing guilt in parents) have shown greater 

success.1  Another study, using low re-litigation rates as a sign of positive outcome, concluded 

that parents who participated in parent education classes within three weeks of filing had the best 

outcomes.2  Classes taken more than three months after filing did not affect re-litigation rates. 

C.   GETTING OUT THE MESSAGE 

Some improvements in promoting the classes can be made simply by getting the word out 

to parents clearly and consistently from their first contacts with support people (court staff, 

counselors, mediators, attorneys, paralegals, teachers, church contacts, etc.).  We can encourage 

this effort by educating support providers and providing reminders, handouts and computer links 

PARENT EDUCATION REPORT OF SFLAC PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT WORKGROUP – PAGE 4 OF 9 

 

 

so that parents can be easily informed about the class.  Support providers should be regularly 

updated on the latest class content and registration process.  Some jurisdictions have been 

successful in offering professionals the class or a condensed version of the class for continuing 

education credit.  If this is not practical, encouraging support people to attend a regularly 

scheduled class can increase that person’s awareness of the content of the class so he or she can 

promote it in an informed and enthusiastic way. 

In addition, the tone of court materials can create a positive or a negative impression 

upon the parent receiving the information.  Those that focus on the law and rules (“NOTICE: A 

certificate of completion is required to finalize your case”) or on the negative impact of divorce 

(“Workshop Goal: To help parents become aware of how their conflict hurts their children and 

what they can do about it”) may serve to discourage interest and motivation in the parent to 

attend the class.  Materials that offer incentives and hope for parents (“Learn how divorce or 

separation impacts your children and what you can to do help them”) appear to promote greater 

interest and motivation.  Materials that include the notice about the completion requirement can 

also incorporate a message about the positive goals of the class.  This increases the likelihood 

that parents will see the class as an opportunity for support.   Titles such as “Co-Parenting: 

Children in Changing Families”, “Kids First”, “Focus on Children” may also encourage parents 

to participate 

D. 

 ENCOURAGING EARLY PARTICIPATION 

In light of the research affirming the importance of early participation in parent 

education, we should continue and expand successful methods of bringing parents into classes 

earlier and try new techniques to see if early turnout can be increased further.  

PARENT EDUCATION REPORT OF SFLAC PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT WORKGROUP – PAGE 5 OF 9 

 

Individual judicial districts use various operational methods to encourage early 

 

participation.  The “hurdle” approach requires proof of class completion within a certain time 

frame or before parents can access certain other services.  For example: parents must register for 

class within a certain number of days after filing (14 for Washington and 15 for Clatsop); parents 

must complete class a certain number of days before a court appearance (30 days for Coos); 

parents must complete class prior to attending mediation (Columbia, Coos, Curry, Grant, 

Klamath, Polk, Tillamook, Washington).  In addition, all counties require parents (at least the 

petitioner) to complete the class before a judgment that includes a parenting plan can be entered.  

A full index of Parent Education programs and the details for each county is available on the 

Oregon Judicial Department’s Family Law Page and is attached as Appendix 1.  

“Incentive” approaches reward early enrollment.  Two counties offer an incentive if the 

class is taken within a certain number of days of filing or completion of service.  Multnomah and 

Clackamas Counties both offer a $15 discount, in Multnomah if parents register within 60 days 

of filing and in Clackamas if parents register within 15 days of completed service.  Yamhill 

County is in the process of implementing a discount for parents who attend before filing or 

within thirty days of filing.  Another possible incentive that private attorneys and mediators 

could offer is a discount on their services for clients who complete the class within a certain 

number of days of their first meeting. 

 

E. 

BARRIERS 

Barriers, intentional and unintentional, may exist which discourage completion of a 

parent education class.  The cost or time commitment may be a significant obstacle.  By offering 

fee waivers, deferrals, and sliding scale fees, the cost burden can be eased.  Where the population 

supports it, counties offer classes at various times so that missed work or inability to find child 

PARENT EDUCATION REPORT OF SFLAC PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT WORKGROUP – PAGE 6 OF 9 

 

 

care is less of an issue.  Language barriers can make it difficult to learn about the class and 

enrollment process.  Lack of translation resources can make it impossible to understand the 

information taught in class.  Classes offered in Spanish or other languages give non English-

speaking parents the best opportunity to gain a full understanding of the information. 

All counties have some protocol for enrolling parents in separate classes when a 

restraining order has been filed.  If professionals who interact with parents and the written 

materials about the class refer to broader safety concerns, any parent who has a safety concern 

can understand that he or she has the option to take the class separately or to ask that other safety 

measures be taken. 

Where access is an issue for parents, due to geographical or physical barriers, safety 

concerns or other significant obstacles, alternatives to in-person participation may be offered.  Of 

the 36 Oregon judicial districts, three-quarters allow for an online or video alternative to the in-

person class: four accept specific online parent education classes, twenty-one others allow them 

on a case-by-case basis, and another two allow a video alternative.  More research is needed to 

determine the effectiveness of in-person vs. online or video classes. 

Other barriers may discourage early participation in particular.  More densely populated 

counties may experience enrollment wait lists or lengthier response times, i.e. delays in returning 

calls.  Less densely population counties may not have enough participants to cover the cost of 

offering classes frequently.  A certificate may expire if the case is not filed within a certain time 

(6 months in Wallowa, for example).  Some counties do not allow enrollment prior to filing 

(Polk and Curry, for example).   In some cases the enrollment process may discourage pre-filing 

attendance, i.e. appearing to require case numbers and party designation on forms.

F. 

 INVOLVING THE CHILDREN 

Two judicial districts in Oregon (Washington and Coos) also offer a separate class for 

children.  Both programs serve children ages 5-17, are voluntary, and do not charge for the 

children’s class.  Washington County offers the Kids Turn program, which consists of four 90-

minute sessions held at the same time as their parents are attending class.  Coos County created 

their own program, which consists of four 60-minute sessions held separately from the parent 

class.  There are some online resources for children to use directly.  One excellent example 

comes from Canada, www.familieschange.ca.  This interactive and engaging site has one version 

for younger children and another for teens and preteens.  

G. 

 BASIC SKILLS AND HIGHER NEEDS 

A few areas of parent education are particularly difficult for parents to access in Oregon.  

Some parents need basic parenting skills.  Outside of Juvenile Dependency court, Family Courts 

have not had a lot of referral information for parents in this area.  Multnomah County has 

developed a parenting skills resource list for their website.   Similarly, for high conflict parents, 

resources have been limited.  Parents in Multnomah and Clackamas counties can be ordered to 

take the Parenting Beyond Conflict class.  Some decide to take it on their own.  In either case 

parents must pay privately for the class.  Other states have wrestled with how to serve high 

conflict parents.  Missouri courts have teamed up with Missouri State University to offer the 

Common Ground program for high conflict parents and their children.  The class provides an 

opportunity for parents and children to learn skills to improve their relationships using drama and 

art as tools for learning.

H. 

 THE FUTURE 

 

There is ample evidence that educational support helps parents look beyond simply 

containing conflict and setting a parenting time schedule. By focusing on the primacy of parent 

attunement to children’s developmental and emotional needs, parents can move towards 

establishing and maintaining healthy post-separation parenting relationships.  Zeroing in on the 

attitudes and behaviors that promote emotional repair and healthy restructuring can serve as a 

secure anchor for families in a sea of change. Seminal attachment research and recent ground-

breaking developments in the neuroscience of human relationships offer insight into conditions 

which support children’s long term well-being.  The more we focus parents’ attention on the 

essence of what will produce success and guide them to recognize their strengths, the more they 

will be able to develop a clear vision of their responsibilities and resources, and be empowered to 

act in their children’s best interest.
