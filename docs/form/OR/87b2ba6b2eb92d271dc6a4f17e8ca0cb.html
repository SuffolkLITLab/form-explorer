Oregon Judicial Department 

Revised 11/2019

Written and Designed by Eve Dedek, Communication & Publications Analyst 3 
Office of the State Court Administrator 

The Oregon Judicial Department (OJD)
is a system of state circuit courts, 
appellate courts, the Oregon Tax Court, 
and the Office of the State Court 
Administrator (OSCA). Judges in the 
OJD courts have the responsibility to 
enforce the rule of law by: 

•

•

deciding criminal, civil, family, and
other types of legal disputes
interpreting and applying the state
and federal constitutions and statutes
to make decisions on cases

All OJD judges, including Supreme Court justices, Court of Appeals judges, 
circuit court judges, and the Oregon Tax Court judge are elected to six-year 
terms in non-partisan elections. If a judge position becomes vacant before the 
end of the term  (due to a judge resignation, retirement, or death in office), the 
Governor may appoint a new judge to fill the  vacancy until the next general 
election. The appointed judge must then run as a candidate for the judgeship. 

The Judicial Branch (the third branch of government) includes OJD and other 
affiliated entities —the Oregon State Bar, Commission on Judicial Fitness and 
Disability, Office of Public Defense Services, and the Council on Court 
Procedures—all of which the Chief Justice and Supreme Court justices also play 
roles in.  

Definitions 

circuit courts: are Oregon’s 
trial courts. 

appellate courts: includes the 
Oregon Supreme Court and 
the Oregon Court of Appeals. 

Oregon Tax Court: handles 
all tax law matters. 

Office of the State Court 
Administrator (OSCA): 
provides support for the 
statewide administration of the 
Judicial Department.  

Oregon Judicial Department 
(OJD): the part of the Judicial 
Branch that includes the circuit 
courts, appellate courts, the 
Tax Court, and the Office of 
the State Court Administrator. 

justices: judges elected to the 
Supreme court are called 
justices.  

non-partisan: Oregon’s Code 
of Judicial Conduct does not 
allow judges to identify 
themselves as members of 
any political party. This rule 
makes sure that judges 
remain fair and impartial. 

Oregon State Courts System 

Oregon 
Supreme Court 
(7 justices) 

Oregon Court  
of Appeals 
(13 judges) 

Oregon Tax Court 

Regular Division  
(1 Tax Court judge) 

Oregon Circuit 
Courts 
(177 judges) 

Magistrate Division 
(3 magistrates) 

Cases  enter  the  state  court  system  starting  in  the  circuit  courts  and  may  go  on  to  a  higher  court 
through the appeals process. 
•

Circuit  court  decisions  can  be  appealed  to  the  Court  of  Appeals  if  a  litigant  believes  the  circuit
court made an error.

•

•

If a litigant believes the Court of Appeals has made an error, the Court of Appeals decision can be
appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court will only review a Court of Appeals decision if
it  decides  that  the  appeal  requires  them  to  interpret  an  important  area  of  state  law  or  decide
whether a law is constitutional.

Tax Court cases start in the Magistrate Division and can be appealed to the Regular Division’s Tax
Court Judge, whose decisions can only be appealed directly to the Supreme Court.

 The state court system provides access to justice for all by ensuring that due 
process of law protects public safety, families, and vulnerable individuals; 
economic rights; and provides a safe place for dispute resolution.  

In 2016 implementation of OJD’s statewide court technology system, Oregon 
eCourt, was completed allowing the public electronic access to the state courts  
twenty four hours a day seven days a week from any computer. The general 
public can complete common court transactions including ePayment on citations 
and cases; search court calendars and case records; and use Guide & File to file 
some cases online. Guide & File provides interactive forms (OJD iForms) that are 
filled out for the users after answering an online interview about their case 
(particularly helpful to pro se litigants). The iForm can be eFiled or printed and 
submitted to the court by hand or mail.  

Circuit courts (Oregon’s trial courts) have 
general jurisdiction over all types of cases 
including civil, domestic relations, traffic, 
juvenile, small claims, criminal, violations, 
abuse prevention act, probate, mental 
commitments, adoption, and guardianship 
cases. The Oregon circuit courts also provide 
specialty court dockets which include 
treatment courts (rigorous programs for 
qualified offenders focused on addiction, 
behavior change, and mental health) and 
problem-solving courts focused on using more 
simplified court procedures in order to speed 

up trials and cut costs for litigants. 

Specialty courts (drug and alcohol addiction courts, veterans courts, mental 
health courts, and others) are statistically proven to cut down on repeat offenses 
and allow judges in our courts to make decisions that provide the people that 
come before them a hand up through court programs that teach offenders life 
skills and provide support services as they work on improving their lives — a 
process that is more likely than a prison sentence to be successful and improve 
public safety.  

Problem-solving court dockets focus on simplifying court procedures to decrease 
the time and financial hardship that certain types of cases impose on citizens and 
businesses:  

• Commercial Court — located in Lane County, the court relieves the burden
that long, complex commercial cases place on circuit court dockets and
shortens litigation time and costs for businesses and other complex civil case
litigants.
Expedited and Streamlined Civil Jury Trials — protects the right to a jury trial
for citizens who cannot afford the rising costs of a traditional trial by jury.
Informal Domestic Relations Trial (IDRT) — a less stressful court process for
divorce, child custody, and other domestic cases where parties speak directly
to the judge, who usually makes a decision on the case the same day.

Definitions 
due process: The Fifth 
Amendment of the United 
States Constitution guarantees 
that: No person shall be 
deprived of life, liberty, or 
property without due process 
of law. The Fourteenth 
Amendment requires the 
states to obey the Fifth 
Amendment. 

“Due process” is a 
fundamental right of citizens. It 
makes sure that fairness and 
equal treatment is applied in 
all legal matters and court 
hearings.  

pro se: “self represented” or 
when a person represents his 
or her self in court without a 
lawyer. 

jurisdiction: is the legal 
authority of a court to hear and 
decide certain types of cases.  

probate: a case where the 
court decides if a deceased 
person’s Will is valid or not. 

specialty court dockets: a 
docket is a calendar or a list of 
cases that are scheduled for 
trial or a list of people who 
have cases pending. Specialty 
court dockets are calendars of 
problem solving court sessions 
that utilize innovative 
programs designed to provide 
the best outcomes for specific 
individuals or cases.

 The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court appoints a presiding judge (PJ) to a two-
year term in each judicial district to administer, supervise, and distribute the 
workload to the circuit court judges within the district.  

Each judicial district has a trial court administrator (TCA) who supervises the 
daily operations of the court and ensures that court business processes are 
carried out according to Oregon law. Trial court administrators are supervised by 
the court’s PJ. 

Circuit courts are the official “courts of record,” which means they are  
responsible for recording and saving every word spoken during a trial so that a 
record will be available if the court’s decision is appealed to a higher court. 

There is at least one courthouse in each of Oregon’s 36 counties (some circuit 
courts hear cases in additional buildings within the county). Circuit courts are 
organized into 27 judicial districts across the state. Low population counties are 
grouped into multiple-county judicial districts, and large population counties 
remain as single districts (see map below). The Legislature decides how many 
judges are in each judicial district.  

Definitions 

PJ: this is the acronym for 
presiding judge (pronounce 
each letter: “P” “J”). 

TCA: pronounce each letter: 
(“T” “C” “A”) the acronym for 
Trial Court Administrator. 

OJD’s 27 judicial districts are indicated on the map above by color and district numbers. Some judicial districts are made 
up of more than one county.

The Oregon Tax Court is a specialized trial 
court that has statewide jurisdiction over 
cases involving Oregon tax laws. The court 
hears cases that arise from disputes of 
personal income tax, property tax, corporate 
excise tax, timber tax, cigarette tax, local 
budget law, and constitutional property tax 
limitations. 

The Tax Court has two divisions, the 
Magistrate  Division and the Regular 
Division. Tax law cases are initiated by 
filing a complaint with the Magistrate 

Division. Parties may agree to participate in mediation led by a magistrate to 
settle their case. If mediation does not resolve the dispute, the case is set for trial 
with another magistrate. The magistrate writes a final decision that can be 
appealed in the Regular Division where it is heard de novo by the Tax Court 
Judge. The Judge’s final decision is written as an opinion or order, which if 
appealed, goes directly to the Oregon Supreme Court. 

The Oregon Court of Appeals (COA) 
decides civil and criminal appeals from the 
circuit courts (except death penalty cases 
and Tax Court appeals) and cases involving 
state administrative agency actions (usually 
involving disputes related to government or 
industry regulations).  

There are thirteen elected judges on the 
COA. The judges are divided into four 
“panels” that review and vote on cases 
assigned to them by the Chief Judge of the 
Court of Appeals. The Chief Judge sits with 

each panel as a nonvoting judge and substitutes as a voting judge if another 
judge is not available or has a conflict of interest with the case. Another two-
judge panel can be formed that includes the Chief Judge and one judge selected 
from one of the four panels to review certain substantive motions. 

After reviewing an appeal, a panel may decide to agree with the original circuit 
court decision, or draft their own opinion. If any panel member disagrees, that 
member writes a dissenting opinion. The panel opinion and any dissents are 
reviewed with the Chief Judge. Once accepted, the panel’s opinion is circulated to 
all thirteen appeals court judges for comment. The judges may either agree with 
the opinion or decide that the appeal should be considered en banc. 

Definitions 

Magistrate Division: an 
Oregon Tax Court magistrate 
is a legal officer trained and 
experienced in Tax Law. They 
conduct mediation sessions 
and make decisions on limited 
types of cases. OJD’s Oregon 
Tax Court has three appointed 
magistrates.  

Regular Division: there is 
one Oregon Tax Court judge 
(who is an elected judicial 
officer) in the Regular Division. 
The Tax Court judge hears 
appeals filed against the final 
decision of the Magistrate 
Division and writes an opinion 
or order that can only be 
appealed to the Oregon 
Supreme Court.  

de novo: when a case that is 
appealed is heard as a 
completely new case without 
knowledge of the initial case 
record. 

conflict of interest: any 
connection that a judge has to 
the parties in a case; any 
previous knowledge of 
the facts of the case; any 
financial interest in the case; 
or any relationship with one   
of the case attorneys. 

substantive motion: a 
request for a decision from the 
court based on the laws that 
regulate the behavior of 
persons or groups in society. 
Substantive law is used to 
decide if a crime is either 
criminal or civil, define which 
charges will be made, and to 
establish the appropriate 
punishment.   

opinion: a judge’s written 
explanation of the court’s 
decision on a case.  

en banc: after reviewing a 
panel’s opinion, all 13 COA 
judges may decide that the 
appeal should be considered 
by the full 13-judge court.

The Oregon Supreme Court is the highest 
court in the state court system for the 
interpretation of Oregon law. The court has 
seven justices, each elected to serve a six-
year term. The justices perform 
discretionary review of petitions (appeals 
of COA decisions) submitted to the Supreme 
Court. Three or more justices must vote to 
review any appeal, otherwise the COA 
decision becomes final. 

The Supreme Court also reviews cases that 
 
 
the Oregon Constitution or state statute 
requires go directly to the Supreme Court. 

These cases are called direct review or original jurisdiction cases and include: 
automatic review of cases where the death penalty has been given; Oregon Tax 
Court appeals; attorney and judge discipline matters; certain election-related 
matters; and cases where Supreme Court review is required by statute because 
the case is of unusual legal significance or will have a statewide impact (labor 
disputes; prison, energy facility, and waste disposal site decisions; crime victim 
rights; unlawful imprisonment challenges (habeas corpus); appeals of court 
orders that suppress evidence or dismiss a case (mandamus petitions); and 
direct review or appeals of cases that the Legislature calls for the court to 
consider). Other responsibilities of the Oregon Supreme Court include review and 
approval of various rules, amendments, and Uniform Trial Court Rules 
(UTCRs) that affect the practice of law in Oregon. 

In addition to the state court system, there are 
municipal courts; county courts; justice courts; 
tribal courts; and United States federal courts 
in Oregon. These courts have jurisdiction 
outside of the state court system and are not 
under the administrative control of OJD.  
•

Municipal courts function as city
government's judicial system.
Municipal courts are not part of state
government courts in Oregon. They only
hear cases involving violations of city
laws (ordinances) and some state statutes that regulate animal control, fire 
control, parking, and traffic violations within city limits. 

• County courts exist in seven eastern Oregon counties—Gilliam, Sherman and
Wheeler have juvenile and probate jurisdiction, while Grant, Harney and
Malheur have probate jurisdiction. The Chairperson of the Board of
Commissioners in those counties serves as the “county judge” carrying out
limited judicial functions (juvenile and or probate cases) within the county, but
his or her primary job involves non-judicial administrative responsibilities as
chairperson of the county commission.

Definitions 

discretionary review: the 
Supreme Court will choose to 
review only those cases that 
present an important question 
of state law — three or more 
justices must vote to allow the 
review. 

direct review or original ju-
risdiction: the authority of a 
court to hear a case for the 
first time as opposed to hear-
ing an appeal on a lower 
court’s decision.  

habeas corpus: a petition to 
the court seeking release of a 
person from unlawful detention 
or imprisonment. The petition 
must show there was a legal 
error by the court that original-
ly confined the person to de-
tention or prison.  

mandamus petitions: petition 
the court to issue an order that 
a person, court, government 
official, or other authority per-
form an action required by law. 

rules: created to govern the 
procedures used to conduct 
court business. Rules can be 
applied to a jurisdiction, local 
court, or to courts statewide. 

amendments: additions or 
alterations made to existing 
statutes, rules, or UTCR’s.  

Uniform Trial Court Rules 
(UTCRs): these rules apply to 
the practice of law in each of 
Oregon’s 36 circuit courts to 
promote consistent, uniform 
court practices across the 
state.

Justice courts are established by county commissioners and are funded by
county government. They are not part of the state court system (OJD). The
judge of a justice court is called a Justice of the Peace, and is elected to serve
for six years. Justice courts hear cases involving minor traffic and boating
violations, fish and game offenses, small civil claims, violations of some county
ordinances (excessive noise, dogs running at large), and can perform
weddings.

Tribal courts are an important part of tribal self-government for Oregon’s
Indian Nations. Most tribes have their own constitutions and laws that
determine how tribal courts resolve civil and criminal matters that occur on
Indian lands. Some tribes choose to use traditional native forms of dispute
resolution (using a mending process that renews damaged personal and
communal relationships) and other tribes use an adversarial process (involving
a plaintiff and defendant) to settle disputes. A Tribal-State Court Forum
consisting of representatives from nine Oregon Indian tribes, nine tribal court
judges, nine OJD judges, tribal law attorneys, and others work on cross-
jurisdictional issues affecting the delivery of justice to Oregon’s Indian people
in the state courts. The Forum’s work has included cross-jurisdictional
recognition of tribal court protection orders; issues surrounding the Indian Child
Welfare Act (ICWA); inter-jurisdictional drug courts; and easing costs involved
in out-of-state representation of out-of-state Indian children in juvenile
dependency cases.

Definitions 

county commissioners: a 
group of elected officials who 
administer the county 
government. Duties include 
enacting local ordinances, 
approving budgets, and 
overseeing spending. 

Indian Nations: referred to as 
“Indian tribes” or “Indian 
people,” the Indian Nations 
are considered separate 
(sovereign) governments 
within the United States (U.S.) 
and have the right to self 
government under the U.S. 
Constitution. They have their 
own laws, taxes, 
governments, legal authority, 
and courts whose jurisdiction 
is within the boundaries of 
Indian lands and territories. 

Tribal-State Court Forum: 
OJD judges, tribal court 
judges, and others having a 
stake in cooperation between 
tribal courts and state courts 
meet annually to work on 
cross-jurisdictional projects.  

The Tribal-State Court Forum includes representatives from the nine Oregon Indian 
Nations shown in the map above.

Federal courts (United States District Courts) are the "trial-level courts" of the
United States (U.S.) federal court system. There are 94 federal district courts
across the U.S.— states with larger populations have more than one federal
district court. They hear civil and criminal cases related to federal law, admin-
istrative actions of federal agencies, and the United States Constitution. The
U.S. district courts are grouped geographically into 12 federal regional cir-
cuits (see map below) each having a United States Court of Appeals.

Geographic Boundaries of the 12 Federal Regional Circuits 

Definitions 

9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals: a U.S. federal court 
that hears appeals on 
decisions of the U.S. district 
courts from the group of 
states in the 9th Circuit. The 
9th Circuit is one of 12 federal 
regional circuits.  

“government of the people, 
by the people, and for the 
people”: a phrase that 
originated as far back as the 
1300’s that was famously 
used by President Abraham 
Lincoln in his Gettysburg 
Address at the 1863 
dedication of the Soldiers 
National Cemetery in 
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. 
The phrase has been used 
ever since as a description of 
representative democracy. 

12 

The 12 federal regional circuits are indicated by color and circuit numbers above. 
Oregon is included in the “9th Circuit” and files appeals on U.S. district court cases in 
the “9th Circuit Court of Appeals.” 

Oregon courts protect the constitutional 
rights of people by preserving the right to 
due process throughout a system that 
consists of state, municipal, county, justice, 
tribal, and federal courts. The system is 
designed to respond to the full range of 
disputes and legal issues encountered in a 
free society.  

In a “government of the people, by the 
people, and for the people,” all citizens 
have a role in upholding the court system 
by completing certain civic responsibilities 
such as paying taxes that help support court services; serving as witnesses or 
jurors in court to ensure the right to a fair trial by jury; volunteering in community 
programs to help victims, children, the elderly, and others; and by speaking up in 
their communities to preserve citizen rights and impact the laws that improve 
justice for all. Our courts rely on the power of citizen participation to help ensure 
that justice will meet the needs of the public fairly, completely, and without delay.
