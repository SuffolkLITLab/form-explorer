ear friends,  

 would like to express my appreciation for the hard work and thoughtful leadership that our 
Civil Rights Unit and Crime Victim and Survivor Services Division gave to this project.  I would 
also like to personally thank the over one-thousand participants who joined the Summer 2020 
Community Conversations and entrusted us with their experiences and valuable perspectives.   

e launched these community-wide forums to hear directly from individuals impacted by 

inequity—both to learn and understand, as well as to take targeted action based on that 
information to reform our programs and services.  I was honored to welcome the participants 
who joined us during the twelve sessions.  These conversations gave us many important ideas 
and suggestions, and we are already taking them to heart. 

 am especially indebted to Benjamin Bradshaw in CVSSD; Johanna Costa and Fay Stetz-Waters 
in our Civil Rights Unit; and Jennifer Lawrence, Darrin Jones, and Jeff Milam in our IS 
Department for their commitment to making this program inclusive and accessible to all 
participants.   

e value the many and diverse contributions we received, and fully recognize that the time to 

dismantle institutional racism in the pursuit of delivering fair and unbiased justice is 
now.  Thank you to all who moved us further along the path toward holistically addressing 
access, voice, discrimination, bias, and hate. 

e look forward to continued collaboration and meaningful strides in the future.  

ith sincere best wishes,  

Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum

Introduction  
  
All Oregonians deserve meaningful access to their government, acknowledgement of bias and 
hate experiences, and insight into the work that the Oregon Department of Justice (DOJ) does 
to support those harmed by exclusion, bias, and hate. Pursuing these ideals, in July and August 
of 2020, DOJ’s Crime Victim and Survivor Services Division (CVSSD) and Civil Rights Unit held 
twelve community conversations with people from demographic groups who have historically 
been discriminated against, experienced exclusion, and who are currently impacted by ongoing 
inequity.  The sessions were a continuation of in-person discussions begun in the Fall of 2019 by 
DOJ’s Crime Victim and Survivor Services Division. 
  
We find ourselves in a unique moment in history: our nation is experiencing the intersection of 
the dual pandemics of COVID-19 and systemic racism.  We have seen a mass awakening and 
support for the Black Lives Matter social justice movement and the nation’s readiness both to 
acknowledge persistent individual and systemic inequities and to work toward equity.  It is clear 
the opportunity for change is now.   
  
The conversations focused on topics including access, voice, justice, profiling, institutional 
racism and discrimination, implicit bias, and explicit hate.  These conversations were intended 
to help DOJ better understand the needs and challenges of these communities, to better 
understand the barriers they face when interacting with DOJ and DOJ-funded programs, and to 
improve these programs and services to better meet individual needs.  
  
While many people have previously shared their experiences with bias and barriers to accessing 
services in other forums, DOJ had not previously hosted a community-wide forum, to hear from 
individuals from these specific communities, with an eye toward DOJ change and reform.  There 
is no doubt that sharing experiences of discrimination, exclusion, bias, and hate can be 
emotionally exhausting and retraumatizing.  Over 1,000 attendees listened to each other, 
shared willingly their experiences and perspectives, and built community.  We, as facilitators, 
were both humbled and honored to be entrusted with the experiences and stories shared. We 
hope to be an open and accessible point of contact well into the future. 
  
Throughout the Summer 2020 Community Conversations, participants inquired about 
documentation and plans for action.  Specifically, participants asked if DOJ would release a 
summary report of the public sessions, and what action would come from the sessions.  This 
report documents the information, concepts, and issues gathered from the sessions and will 
serve as a compass to push longstanding injustices toward equity.   
  
The report will be disseminated to the Governor as well as other elected leaders in Oregon; 
participants in the Community Conversations who requested updates; culturally and population 
specific stakeholders and community-based agencies around the state; all DOJ-funded victim 
service programs; Tribal Councils, Chiefs, and/or Boards of Trustees from all nine federally 
recognized tribes in Oregon; media; and population-specific affinity groups that represent

A Note about Language and Intersectionality 
  
The language we use reflects our openness, training, respect for dignity, and cultural humility. 
The importance of understanding and being willing to use correct pronouns and language that 
does not treat someone as “other” can allow them to be seen, while misgendering someone or 
using othering language can erase their identity.   
  
Some feedback we heard in the Community Conversations about language included that many 
American Indian/Alaska Native people will refer to themselves as Indian. Participants shared 
that, to some, “Native American” is considered a colonizing or whitewashing term taught in 
mainstream schools to indoctrinate a false history.  Some people prefer being called “Black” as 
opposed to “African American,” while some still prefer “African American.”  Asian identity is 
separate and different from Pacific Islander identity, and the acronym API serves only to merge 
multiple populations that should not be.  Within LGBTIQA2S+ populations, there is a great 
variety of terms used to describe identity.  Language evolves.  Labeling language belongs to the 
person whose identity it reflects.  It is very important for service providers to listen to their 
clients and adjust language to embrace how their clients would like to be addressed.  
  
Midway through these Community Conversations, we decided to stop using the phrases 
“marginalized and oppressed communities” as well as “minority communities,” and began to 
use the phrase “communities and groups impacted by inequity.”  This shift in language was 
prompted by the Conversations. A participant indicated this latter phrase reflects a more 
accurate and honorable representation, as “There are influencers and leaders, resilient and 
hope-inspiring actions and initiatives, and much to learn from and respect in these 
cultures.”  Our language should empower those people whom the words intend to reach and 
reflect and should not be spoken to reinforce the speaker’s dominance as a savior or rescuer.   
  
In addition to language, aspects of a person’s intersecting identities can combine to create 
unique modes of discrimination and privilege.  Intersectionality may increase the already 
existing disproportionality of victimization rates, violence during victimization, bias, 
discrimination, and fear of engaging with systems.  With intersecting and overlapping identities, 
sometimes a person is forced to choose one identity or alliance, and the whole of their identity 
can become lost.  Indeed, people can experience invisibility within systems, for all or part of 
their identity.  Throughout our Community Conversations, we heard repeatedly that each 
inequity, disproportionality, disparity, harm, or bias can be compounded for those whose 
intersectionality further implicates their privilege or lack of privilege, their power, their voice, 
and their standing in society.  With this in mind, service providers should understand and 
recognize a person’s intersectionality as a “prism to bring to light dynamics within 
discrimination” as stated by Professor Kimberlé Crenshaw, who first coined the term 
intersectionality in 1989.

Our Logistical Processes for the Summer 2020 Community Conversations 
  
Populations 
DOJ facilitated sessions for the following communities: 
  

•  LGBTIQA2S+ 
•  Religious Minority  
•  Latinx 
•  Black/African American 
•  Asian and Pacific Islander 
•  Undocumented/Migrant Farm Worker 
•  Houseless/Mental Illness/Addictions 
•  American Indian/Alaska Native 
•  Deaf and Hard of Hearing 
•  Disabilities  
•  Refugee/Immigrant communities   

  
Future Community Conversations will include separate sessions for Asian, Pacific Islander, Blind 
and Low Sight, and people of color communities more broadly. 
  
Community Coordination 
Our DOJ facilitators hoped to create a safe space to allow for BIPOC, LGBTIQA2S+, people with 
disabilities, religious minorities, and immigrant and refugee community members to share 
experiences.  We recognized that government, especially government connected to law 
enforcement, can be an uncomfortable or unsafe space for the populations that 
participated.  We intentionally and explicitly took the following steps to make it as safe as 
possible for people to share:  

•  We asked attendees to prioritize input and speaking time for these community 

members; at the end of each session, advocates who work with these communities 
were welcomed to give input as well.   

•  Registration was not required.   
•  Sessions were not recorded. 
•  Attendees could call in or log on anonymously.   
•  Attendees’ videos and chats were not public and speaking or sharing was completely 

voluntary.   

•  We also provided a designated email address for people to share their experiences, 

rather than having to speak in a public forum if they did not want to.   

•  For those who still preferred an offline phone conversation, we took down phone 

numbers by email for individual follow-up conversations.   

  

 

7 

Outreach 
Our outreach efforts were broad and intended to be as inclusive as possible: 

•  We sent invitations to hundreds of culturally and population specific community-based 

agencies around the state.   

•  All DOJ-funded victim service programs were invited to attend, including prosecutor- 

and law enforcement-based service providers.   

•  Tribal Councils, Chiefs, and/or Boards of Trustees from all nine federally recognized 
tribes in Oregon received formal invitations to attend and to share the session 
information with tribal programs and services. 

•  The Attorney General’s Office issued a press release and several official tweets on 

Twitter, which were picked up by several news agencies.   

•  DOJ’s Crime Victim and Survivor Services Division conducted social media-based 
outreach to 35 population-specific affinity groups that represent nearly 16,000 
Black/African American, Asian, Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, Latinx, 
LGBTIQA2S+, Deaf and Hard of Hearing, religious minority, houseless, immigrant, 
refugee, and migrant farmworker community members across Oregon. 

  
We built a webpage for the Community Conversations, readily available in eight languages and 
translated upon request into additional languages.  The site included extensive login, access, 
participation, privacy, and safety instructions provided both in writing and with image 
instructions.  On this website we also established an accommodations request point of contact. 
Accommodations that were requested and provided included interpreters, closed captioning, 
enlarged materials, and materials provided in advance of sessions.  We did make mistakes, but 
we tried to learn from them, and in fact hosted the Deaf and Hard of Hearing session a second 
time after we acquired a different hosting platform to improve the view of the ASL interpreters.

Summary of Themes 
Themes that emerged from the Summer 2020 Community Conversations: 

•  Community Engagement and Information Sharing:  Systems and service providers 

should engage intentionally with populations and communities impacted by inequity 
and with their community leaders to explain services, laws, and limitations of programs. 

•  Education for Service Providers:  Service providers benefit from focused training to 

enhance understanding when providing culturally- and population-responsive victim 
services that are nuanced and that promote equity.  

•  Services:  Services should exist, be consistently funded, be prioritized, be welcoming, 
and actively promote dignity and respect for people and populations impacted by 
inequity. 

•  Trust:  Service providers within government systems and victim and survivor service 

programs should reflect the actual Oregon community, not just the dominant Oregon 
community, in leadership, staffing, hiring, and decision making.  Providers should 
regularly and intentionally engage, build, and grow relationships with BIPOC, 
LGBTIQA2S+, people with disabilities, religious minorities, and immigrant and refugee 
communities, leaders, and community members to establish and grow trust.   

•  Access:  Systems and service providers should reduce barriers for populations impacted 

by inequity to access services, including building trust, showing cultural humility, 
addressing systemic discrimination and institutional bias, increasing representation in 
leadership and staffing, and providing accommodating, welcoming, adequate, and 
equitable services.  

•  Safety:  Safety is a fundamental aspect of valuing an individual’s humanity and should be 
addressed in order to provide meaningful access to services and engage communities 
impacted by inequity.  

•  Sharing of Power:  Agencies and systems should have leadership, staff, volunteers, 

managers, and board members who identify as BIPOC, LGBTIQA2S+, religious minorities, 
people with disabilities, immigrants, and refugees at the table, and their vision, ideas, 
and voices should lead.   

•  Complaint Processes:  Agency complaint processes should exist and there should be an 

external option to effectively address complaints, including bias. 

•  Overreach:  White, cis, and abled supremacy thrive on power and limiting access, and 
are perpetuated by providers when they place excessive restrictions or manufactured 
requirements on access to services. 

•  Bias and Stereotypes about Identity:  Community Conversations resulted in many 

reports of bias, stereotyping, inadequate cultural understanding, and dominant culture 
supremacy.  Participants expressed an increase in explicit bias in general and specifically 
reported being depersonalized – treated as a waste of resources – and being disbelieved 
by service providers and law enforcement. Institutional discrimination exists in part 
because people have biases; it is a people issue, not just a system issue.  

 

9 

•  Culturally Specific Agencies:  In many cases, culturally specific agencies can open access, 
reduce barriers, reflect identity, and promote safety. But it is not always best that one’s 
cultural community serves its own community members.  For some, culturally specific 
agencies can pose new barriers.  Choice is key. 

•  Vulnerability:  Communities impacted by inequity can be very vulnerable to victimization 

and hesitant to engage in systems.  

•  People Doing this Work:  People doing this work face retaliation for promoting equity 

and access, which ultimately builds up and affects networking, promotional 
opportunities, and career trajectory.

Themes 
Throughout the Community Conversations, participants across population sessions shared 
some common experiences, service gaps, and recommendations reflective of opportunities for 
growth toward equity.  In some cases, a recommendation is specific to serving a community 
member of a particular identity or population, and in those instances, we specifically identify 
the population in our report.  In other instances, we heard reoccurring feedback that informed 
the larger themes we have identified in this report.  Below are the themes that emerged from 
the Summer 2020 Community Conversations.   

We, the authors of this report, recognize and must explicitly state that the themes listed below 
were organized with our best intentions to truthfully and accurately reflect the reoccurring 
elements presented to us during the Community Conversations; however, we recognize that 
any information is filtered through our own lenses, identities, life experiences and biases. We 
listened diligently, took extensive notes, reviewed comments in the chat box, and engaged in 
follow-up with community members upon request, but we recognize that our own voices, 
perspectives, and experiences inherently influenced this report.  We continue to welcome 
ongoing feedback, dialogue, and conversation, as well as eagerly anticipate our next series of 
Community Conversations in Spring 2021, so that we may continue hear and elevate your 
voices and experiences and work with you toward equity.  

ommunity Engagement and Information Sharing 

Theme 1 emerged from information shared by Community Conversation Participants: Systems 
and service providers should engage intentionally with populations and communities impacted 
by inequity and their community leaders to explain services, laws, and limitations of programs, 
including: 
  

•  What is a bias crime vs. bias incident? 
•  What are law enforcement’s obligations to crime victims and bias victims? 
•  What are service providers’ obligations to crime victims and bias victims? 
•  What programs and services does DOJ oversee and what does it not oversee; what 

programs and services does CVSSD oversee? 

•  What are Oregon crime victims’ rights? 
•  What is advocate privilege vs. victim confidentiality and when does each attach? How 

do we effectively convey these obligations to clients? 

•  What support services are available for victims and survivors of crime? 
•  Where to report bias, service disparities and inequity, and exclusion from services. 
•  Residency is not required to access services.

Education for service providers 
Theme 2 emerged from information shared by Community Conversation Participants: Service 
providers benefit from focused training to enhance understanding when providing culturally- 
and population-responsive victim services that are nuanced and that promote equity. Training 
should include: 
  

•  Comprehensive, population-specific cultural competencies that highlight the needs 

and considerations of victims within specific populations. 
Importance of establishing communication first, then providing services. 

• 
•  “Equity as a Process:  We achieve equity when those most impacted by historic and 
current structural biases and injustices are leading or meaningfully engaged in 
efforts to prioritize issues, to craft and implement solutions, to develop 
accountability measures, and to monitor progress.” (Note: this is a definition 
provided by a participant from one of the Community Conversations. We have not 
provided the participant’s name as part of our commitment to protect the identities 
of individuals who were part of these conversations.) 

•  “Equity as an Outcome: We achieve equity when identity no longer systematically 

exposes people to risks or grants people privileges with regard to socioeconomic and 
life outcomes, and when people who need them most are prioritized to receive the 
resources required to thrive.” (Note: this is a definition provided by a participant 
from one of the Community Conversations. We have not provided the participant’s 
name as part of our commitment to protect the identities of individuals who were 
part of these conversations.) 

•  Levels of literacy. 
•  Cultural competency vs. cultural humility vs. cultural responsiveness among service 

providers. 

•  Understanding cultural differences and customs to accurately interpret non-verbal 
communication and cues such as eye-contact (or lack thereof), wardrobe, and body 
language.  

•  Medical model vs. cultural model of disability. 
•  Forensic interviewing techniques for people with cognitive or developmental 

disabilities. 

•  Anti-racism, -homophobia, -transphobia, and -ableism. 
•  Culturally sensitive, trauma-informed communication. 

o  Often abusers in Deaf and Hard of Hearing community control 

communication, and therefore, access to law enforcement and safety. 

o  Masks and the importance of facial expressions for Deaf and Hard of Hearing 

community. 

o  Cultural articulation and expression are communicated with a culturally 

reflective interpreter and lost when a culturally reflective interpreter is not 
available. 

•  Addiction as a medical condition. 

12 

 

•  The nexus between trauma, a lack of support resources, mental health ramifications, 

• 

and substance abuse as a coping mechanism or method of self-medication. 
Importance of basic needs that affect physical, emotional, behavioral, and mental 
health. 

•  Service providers should have a foundational understanding and an authentic desire 

for equitable, culturally responsive services. 
Jurisdiction: tribal vs. local vs. federal. 

• 
•  Reaching beyond ADA requirements, which are legal minimums. 
•  Relationship building between community, tribal, and system agencies. 
•  Education should be ongoing, should provide opportunities to train, practice, learn, 
unlearn, and should include accountability for implementation and enforcement. 

•  Culturally specific agencies should be included in ongoing equity training. 

  
Services 
Theme 3 emerged from information shared by Community Conversation Participants: Services 
should exist, be consistently funded, be prioritized, be welcoming, and actively promote dignity 
and respect for people and populations impacted by inequity. 
  

•  Services should respect the humanity of every person. 
•  Domestic Violence/Sexual Assault response services including shelter should be 

available for LGBTIQA2S+ victims, male victims, and victims of caretaker abuse (not just 
inter-personal violence). 

•  Forensic interviewing should include capacity for people with developmental delay, 

neurocognitive disorders, or traumatic brain injury. 

•  On-scene and in-field services in addition to in-office services should be equitably 

•  Services should be culturally sensitive, trauma-informed, and help reduce secondary 

administered and available. 

victimization, including: 

o  No requirement of repeated disclosure. 
o  Reduce the degree of irrelevant questioning as a requirement to access services. 
o  Provide an explanation for questions asked—is information needed for evidence 

vs. is information needed to qualify for services? 

o  No request to provide social security number. 
o  Prioritize survivor safety and support offender accountability. 
o  Reduce barriers including bureaucracy and cumbersome steps and paperwork. 
o  Explicitly state that there are no financial or residency status requirements. 
o  Explicitly state the limitations including time limits for services at the outset, the 
reason for the limitations, and what is available after limitations are surpassed. 

o  Offering consistency and continuity of care. 
•  There is a need for attorneys to represent victims. 
•  Depending on the setting (court, child abuse advocacy center, interview), interpreters 

should be used even if the service provider is fluent in the victim’s language.  

 

13 

•  Service providers should set aside funding specifically designated for interpreters, 
recognizing that this can be a significant cost that cannot then limit other services 
available to the individual requiring interpretation. 

•  Service providers should establish ongoing relationships with interpreters, so they are a 

quick phone call away. 

• 

•  Survivors should be given choice for gender or culturally appropriate interpreters, and 
service providers should communicate these individual needs to companies providing 
certified interpreter interpreters. 
In virtual settings, also use closed captioning for those who do not know ASL, are single-
sided deaf, or are Deaf or Hard of Hearing later in life. 
If someone identifies within a specific demographic or population, they should not be 
automatically or immediately sent to “their” program. Coordinated, established 
relationships should exist when warm handoffs are appropriate. 

• 

•  There is a need for general services shelters. 
•  There is a need for judges who are supportive of mental health, houseless, and drug 

court programs. 

•  Lack of utilities, such as clean drinking water, electricity, garbage, or Wi-Fi availability 
affect physical, emotional, behavioral, and mental health; focusing on meeting basic 
needs makes it difficult to address other needs. 

  
Trust 
Theme 4 emerged from information shared by Community Conversation Participants: Service 
providers within government systems and victim service programs should reflect the actual 
Oregon community, not just the dominant Oregon community, in leadership, staffing, hiring, and 
decision making.  Providers should regularly and intentionally engage, build, and grow 
relationships with BIPOC, LGBTIQA2S+, people with disabilities, religious minorities, and 
immigrant and refugee communities, leaders, and community members to establish and/or grow 
trust.   
  

•  Mainstream, dominant culture organizations should value BIPOC, LGBTIQA2S+, people 
with disabilities, religious minorities, and immigrant or refugee community members. 
•  Procedural justice is key – when a crime is reported, law enforcement should engage 

and respond. 

•  Law enforcement should be an ally in terms of taking populations’ safety seriously. 
•  Promoting population-specific welcoming signage without the training/support to 
respond appropriately and equitably diminishes procedural justice and therefore 
diminishes trust. 

•  Many people who are undocumented, BIPOC, LGBTIQA2S+, religious minorities, 

disabled, refugees, and/or immigrants fear other mainstream, dominant community 
members, law enforcement, and government agencies based on lived experience, 
recent history, and lessons taught within the culture for safety. 

 

14 

•  This fear is exacerbated by other systemic disparities in collateral service industries 

(healthcare, education, DHS). 

•  Explicit and implicit bias occur in every profession, but they are particularly harmful in 
law enforcement and efforts should be continually taken to identify and eliminate bias 
from law enforcement.  

•  Law enforcement should reflect the community, not just in identity, language, and 

culture, but also in values. 

  
Access 
Theme 5 emerged from information shared by Community Conversation Participants: Systems 
and service providers should reduce barriers for populations impacted by inequity to access 
services, including building trust, showing cultural humility, addressing systemic discrimination 
and institutional bias, increasing representation in leadership and staffing, and providing 
accommodating, welcoming, adequate, and equitable services.  
  

General Access 

If the attitude is not welcoming or understanding, laws do not help. 

• 
•  Programs should provide after-hours services. 
•  Urban and rural regions should recognize that minority populations exist in every 

community even when they are not visible, and thus each need population-specific 
programs, including LGBTIQA2S+ services. Just because people aren’t visible to you 
doesn’t mean they aren’t there.  

•  Lack of culturally specific or culturally responsive services within programs often 

requires clients to seek services in another geographic location and can contribute to an 
overall feeling of not belonging and/or being “othered.” 

•  To encourage and promote access, organizations should have leadership and staff 
representation of BIPOC, LGBTIQA2S+, religious minorities, people with disabilities, 
immigrants, refugees, and other populations impacted by equity. 

•  Services are needed for male and gender expansive victims. 
•  Services should promote, assure, maintain, and regularly remind clients of program 

confidentiality, which is critical for people who disclose identity, especially for people 
who are LGBTIQA2S+, undocumented, and/or disabled.  Often people outed during 
service acquisition face real consequences such as losing their children, safety 
repercussions, and other dire consequences.  People will forego services that present a 
risk to their safety and well-being regardless of whether they desperately need those 
services. 

  
Language Access 

•  Written materials should be at the ready in various languages. 
•  Services cannot be technology- or English-language-literacy-dependent. 

 

15 

•  Provide non-English-speaking resources, points of contact, education/awareness, and 

intentional outreach. 

•  Translations should be reviewed by people familiar with the program and services, as 

direct translations can sometimes change the intended meaning. (E.g. the English word 
“advocate” translates to “attorney” in some languages). 

•  Outreach and services should be tailored to serve those who cannot read or write and 
cannot assume that Deaf and Hard of Hearing community members can read and write 
English. 
Interpreters should be more accessible regardless of the ability to pay when accessing 
services.  

• 

o  Clients who retain attorneys should not also pay for ASL interpreters if others, 

including indigent clients, receive ASL interpreters at no cost.  People should not 
have limited or different access to basic communication based on language or 
disability.  

• 

It is inappropriate and often unsafe to utilize a bilingual family member, witness, or non-
certified interpreter as an interpreter in any setting. 

•  9-1-1 dispatchers should inform responding law enforcement that a 

caller/victim/witness is Deaf or non-English-speaking, inquire with the caller about 
language needs, and take steps to provide on-scene accommodations including ASL and 
other interpreters. 

•  Utilize services of ASL interpreters who are intersectional; otherwise we lose the 

expression of someone’s true identity. 

•  Service providers should provide the client’s requested accommodation(s) and not 

coordinate accommodations based on provider assumptions. 

•  Society operates assuming a hearing and speaking default or norm; this is not accurate 

and in fact not reflective of Oregon’s Deaf and Hard of Hearing communities and creates 
significant problems in service accessibility. ASL interpreters should be provided for Deaf 
Oregonians, and other accommodations upon request for Deaf or Hard of Hearing 
individuals should be provided.  With no interpreter and/or other accommodations, 
people who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing lose access. 

•  Service providers should have access to on-demand interpreters, including video ASL 

interpreters, for unscheduled meetings. 

  
Access for people with disabilities 

•  Provide an ADA access point of contact within law enforcement, governmental systems, 

•  When appropriate, use technology as an aid for access for individuals who are Deaf, 

and victim services in prosecutor’s offices. 

Hard of Hearing, or who have disabilities. 

•  Programs cannot require people to prove a disability/disabilities in order to access 

services or be provided their requested accommodations. 

 

16 

•  Oregon should provide community advocates for Deaf and Hard of Hearing victims at no 
cost. Oregon is one of 12 states in the Western U.S. with no Deaf advocate services 
provided for Deaf and Hard of Hearing community members. 

  
Access for those with addictions disorders 

•  Seeking services including basic needs like food, shelter, and medical care declines 

sharply for individuals in their addiction, as fear of legal and other consequences are 
heightened. 

•  Services should not be based on abstinence and should not exclude individuals using 
medication assisted treatment (MAT). Access to treatment often requires money and 
therefore prevents access or excludes people. 
  

Access for undocumented community members  

•  Programs should address the fear of deportation for parents/family/self to promote 

engagement/access. 

  
Safety 
Theme 6 emerged from information shared by Community Conversation Participants: Safety is a 
fundamental aspect of valuing an individual’s humanity and should be addressed in order to 
provide access to services and engage communities impacted by inequity.  
  

•  Some tribal nations lack dedicated and/or responsive law enforcement.  
•  Some rural communities have law enforcement who may be hours away from a call for 

service, and/or won’t respond when called for service. 

•  Criminalizing houselessness drives victimization further underground.  
•  Lack of available services and safety planning that are culturally focused, responsive, 

and sensitive leaves already vulnerable populations at a greater risk of harm.  
•  75% of domestic violence related homicides occur upon separation, including law 
enforcement mandated separation.  A lack of training on the needs of specific 
populations for service providers may do more harm.  

  
Sharing of Power 
Theme 7 emerged from information shared by Community Conversation Participants: Agencies 
and systems should have leadership, staff, volunteers, managers, and board members who 
identify as BIPOC, LGBTIQA2S+, religious minorities, people with disabilities, immigrants, and 
refugees at the table, and their vision, ideas, and voices should lead.   
  

•  When people see someone with whom they can identify or to whom they can relate, 

they feel seen and understood. 

•  Cis/hetero white people should step back to make space for new perspectives. 

 

17 

•  For agencies and programs in areas that serve specific populations, including tribal 
populations and tribal nations, boards and leadership should reflect the service 
population. 

•  No matter the location or dominant/mainstream populations served, leadership should 

include and come from within communities impacted by inequity. 

•  Agencies should consider how strategy, administrative rules, and systems can give 

power back to communities. 

•  Bringing tribal elders to the table is important. 

  
Complaint Processes 
Theme 8 emerged from information shared by Community Conversation Participants: Agency 
complaint processes should exist and there should be an external option to effectively address 
complaints, including bias. 
  

•  Equity complaint processes should exist. 
•  Requiring victims or witnesses of bias to report to the offending institution or agency 
(whether law enforcement or other government system) is nonsensical and unsafe in 
many situations. 

  
Overreach 
Theme 9 emerged from information shared by Community Conversation Participants: White, cis, 
and abled supremacy thrive on power and limiting access, and are perpetuated by providers 
when they place excessive restrictions or manufactured requirements on access to services. 
  

•  When people in government withhold resources, put stricter rules around using 

resources, question documents and/or IDs, and otherwise over-enforce rules that are 
outside of the scope of their position and expertise, the intent is to wield power, 
intimidate, other, exclude, and retain the status quo of White, cis, and abled supremacy. 

•  Excessive restrictions exclude and prevent people from accessing services.  Such 
restrictions create or perpetuate fear and drive people underground, increasing 
vulnerability to victimization. 

•  When agencies are known to work with ICE, providing services to many populations is all 

but impossible. 

  

 

18 

Bias and Stereotypes about Identity 
Theme 10 emerged from information shared by from Community Conversation Participants: 
Community Conversations unearthed many reports of bias, stereotyping, inadequate cultural 
understanding, and dominant culture supremacy.  Participants expressed an increase in explicit 
bias in general and specifically reported being depersonalized – treated as a waste of resources – 
and being disbelieved by service providers and law enforcement. Institutional discrimination 
exists in part because people have biases; it is a people issue, not just a system issue.  Below are 
some of many situations our participants have encountered:  
  

Individuals not knowing the difference between migrant and immigrant. 

• 
•  Bias that the Latinx population “over-utilizes” resources. 
•  Bias that is based on last names, subsequent grouping of community members, 

assumptions about the need for services, and assumptions about native language 
and/or preferred language. 

•  Misinterpretation of a Muslim victim’s averted gaze and body language as evasive and 

suspect. 

•  Cultural practices that encourage quiet, no eye contact, or other traits/behaviors that 
can lead to the victim’s needs not being prioritized in a dominant culture setting. 
•  Questioned validity of student’s birth certificate during high school registration and 

threats to call Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  The student dropped out of 
school due to these administrative threats. 

•  Request to show state issued ID for access to a foodbank. 
•  Non-responsive or dehumanizing responses from law enforcement. 
•  Over-policing BIPOC populations. 
•  Housing discrimination regarding deposits, availability. 
•  Removal of signage about religious minority events. 
•  Explicit disrespect of religious clothing and pressure to remove it in a governmental 

service delivery setting. 

•  People with accents, non-English speakers, Deaf, Hard of Hearing, and people with 
disabilities assumed to be uneducated, lacking capacity, or living with dementia. 

•  Bias resulting in disparities in the quality of healthcare provided.  
•  Healthcare systems fail in treatment of people using substances and people who have a 

mental health disability, which impacts housing and then funnels people into the 
criminal justice system. 

•  Bias that has health, life expectancy, and life and death impacts. 
•  Targeting and losing one’s job for being open about gender identity/sexual orientation. 
•  Assumptions made about chronic health conditions that are visible vs. those that are 

“invisible.” 

•  Bias regarding perceived economic advantages that tribal casinos provide their 

communities; non-tribal communities discouraging tribal members from utilizing non-
tribal programs.   

•  Assumptions that someone is not an Oregonian based on appearance. 

 

19 

•  Language deprivation for Deaf children born into hearing families. 
•  Reporting or addressing bias that is perpetrated by people in power results in further 

harm to the bias victim. 

•  Exclusion from partnerships; Department of Human Services (DHS) and law enforcement 

fail to include population-specific advocacy programs with population-specific 
advocates. 

•  Substance Use Disorder viewed as a choice, not a medical condition or disease. 
•  Exclusion of clients from program services if they need mental health, houseless, or 

addiction treatment services. The message is “you’re not wanted, your life doesn’t have 
value.” 

•  Law enforcement failing to investigate reports or failing to believe victims from 

populations impacted by inequity.  An assumption among some law enforcement that 
these victims lack credibility.   

•  White persons in active addictions have safe, positive experiences with law 

enforcement, while BIPOC and LQBTQIA2S+ are disproportionately more likely to be 
arrested and be incarcerated. 

•  Biased treatment in medical settings where people are not taken seriously, written off, 

not provided any accommodations for interpreters, or are provided substitute 
accommodations that are subpar and/or ineffective. 

•  Experiences of being turned away from medical services due to no insurance coverage. 
•  Longer turnaround time for COVID-19 testing results for the migrant farmworker 

community. 

  
Culturally Specific Agencies 
Theme 11 emerged from information shared by Community Conversation Participants: In many 
cases, culturally specific agencies can open access, reduce barriers, reflect identity, and promote 
safety. But it is not always best that one’s cultural community serves its own community 
members.  For some, culturally specific agencies can pose new barriers.  Choice is key. 
  

•  Victims may have a lack of understanding or trust in the confidentiality protections and 

requirements within culturally specific victim service programs. 

•  Power dynamics may exist. 
•  Culturally specific agencies should be trained and open to serve all, beyond their own 

community. 

  
Vulnerability 
Theme 12 emerged from information shared by Community Conversation Participants: 
Communities impacted by inequity can be very vulnerable to victimization and hesitant to 
engage in systems. They can be vulnerable: 
  

•  To arrest. 
•  To losing livelihood. 

 

20 

•  To losing family. 
•  To targeting for bias and victimization. 
•  To deportation. 
•  To assault by law enforcement. 
•  To being “outed” (people who are LGBTIQA2S+, undocumented, disability). 
•  To constant toxic stress experienced currently and passed down intergenerationally, 

which impacts lifespan. 

  
People Doing this Work 
Theme 13 emerged from information shared by Community Conversation Participants: People 
doing this work face retaliation for promoting equity and access, which ultimately builds up and 
affects networking, promotional opportunities, and career trajectory.  
  

•  Retaliatory tactics include power wielding, removal from committees, exclusion from 

the conversation, shunning, dismissal, denial, explicit hostility, false allegations 
regarding work product, gaslighting, platitudes, weak excuses, treatment as a bother or 
burden, treatment as us vs. them, and othering. 

•  Boards/managers/people in positions of power should value and celebrate employees 

who are BIPOC, LGBTIQA2S+, religious minority, people with disabilities, immigrant, and 
refugee community members.   

•  There should be mutual respect for gender identity/sexual orientation. 
•  Reports at Community Conversations reflect that currently, organizations tokenize 

employees but ignore real change, which creates an environment of microaggressions 
and hostility. 

•  There should be leadership, staff, volunteers, managers, and board members who 

represent BIPOC, LGBTIQA2S+, religious minority, people with disabilities, immigrant, 
and refugee community members.   

•  Management cannot be content with the idea that “something is better than nothing.” 
•  Organizations that employ people who do identify as BIPOC, LGBTIQA2S+, religious 
minority, people with disabilities, immigrant, and refugee service providers should 
prioritize these employees’ self-care, as there is a burden of doing everything (service 
delivery, educating other staff, being a point of contact for vulnerable victims, etc.). 

•  Equity should be primary work; it cannot be seen as “other” work.  
•  Employees who are BIPOC, LGBTIQA2S+, religious minority, people with disabilities, 
immigrant, and refugee community members need protection from “case-building” 
when it is actually retaliation for doing equity/human rights work. 
Institutional racism exists because of the people working within institutions who have 
biases.  It is a people issue, not a system issue. 

• 

  
  

 

 

 

21 

Actionable Items 
Community Conversations revealed many needs as well as readily actionable 
items.  Some of these concepts are readily achievable by DOJ for DOJ-funded 
programs.  Others are outside of the scope of our work at DOJ. 
  
Achievable by DOJ for DOJ-Funded Programs 

•  Develop ongoing training for advocates, volunteers, leadership and boards in victim and 
survivor service programs that address cultural competencies, bias, privilege, equity and 
historical/generational trauma.  Establish and uphold accountability markers for delivery 
of services.  

•  Complaint processes—create external options and ensure this information is readily and 

publicly available.   

•  The ADA requires a public entity that has 50 or more employees to designate at least 
one responsible employee to coordinate ADA compliance.  ADA requirements are the 
floor not the ceiling.  Require an ADA accessibility coordinator or point of contact in 
every DOJ program and DOJ-funded program.  Create an online list of ADA accessibility 
coordinators or points of contact within DOJ programs and DOJ-funded programs for 
ease of access.  

•  Accommodations should be available post-COVID-19 (in many cases, they are only 
available now that the majority are benefitting from teleworking, Zoom, other tech 
accommodations).  

•  Create a list of regional, unhoused-friendly providers across the various services 

needed—dental, medical, prescription, etc.  

•  There should be a campaign to raise awareness across Oregon that mental health is 

physical health, and people with mental health disabilities are still people deserving of 
unbiased care.  

•  Encourage BIPOC to have conversations among themselves without White allies 

present. 

•  Remove the Social Security number question from CVSSD documents and forms, such as 

Crime Victims Compensation Program application. 

•  Agencies should ask carefully crafted screening questions, and then be ready with 
working equipment to meet the needs of people who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing. 

  
Other Community Needs Currently Outside the Scope of Work at DOJ 

Jury duty pool—broaden to include BIPOC. 

• 
•  Mandatory reporting for people with disabilities—allow for autonomy and self-

determination.  

•  There should be something like the Oregon Commission for the Blind (OCB), for the 
Deaf, Deafblind, and Hard of Hearing communities. OCB is funded and resourced in 
Oregon, while the Deaf, Deafblind, and Hard of Hearing communities lack funding and 

22 

  

 

resources to meet basic and daily needs. Oregon should also have more signing service 
providers and make it easier for people to access ASL interpreters.   

•  Agencies, especially government-based and healthcare facilities, should ask carefully 
crafted screening questions, and then be ready with working equipment to meet the 
needs of people who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing. 

•  Oregon Health Plan (OHP) eligibility should not be cut off when someone goes to jail; 

upon release, it makes life very difficult for the person to reenroll. 
•  Medication access when in custody should be a priority; it rarely occurs. 
•  Extended eviction moratorium during COVID-19. 
•  Plan for post-COVID-19—there will be an intense and massive houselessness crisis. 

 

  

 

 

23 

regon DOJ’s Community Conversations will be ongoing.  We anticipate the next round of 

Community Conversations in the Spring of 2021.  They will continue to serve as an access point 
for input regarding DOJ programs and DOJ-funded programs, an opportunity for community 
members to hold us to account for change and growth, as well as a platform to update the 
communities on DOJ’s action efforts to push longstanding injustices toward equity.  To sign up 
for notice of future Community Conversation sessions, please email us at 
Community@DOJ.State.or.us. 

This summary is not an all-inclusive plan for equity or improving systems and programs.  It 
summarizes information shared by participants in the Summer 2020 Community 
Conversations.  We are deeply grateful to learn, share, and build community with attendees 
and participants.  We know that many attendees are or were scared, took great risk in 
attending and sharing, and may have even experienced targeting as a result—thank you for 
sharing your voice and your valuable contributions. 

To report bias experienced in communities or in systems, contact Oregon DOJ’s Hate Crimes 
and Bias Incidents Response Hotline at 1-844-924-BIAS (2427), utilizing Language Link for 
interpreters in over 240 languages, dial 711 for Oregon Relay, or report online at 
StandAgainstHate.Oregon.gov.  To report bias experienced in DOJ-funded victim service 
programs, review DOJ CVSSD’s Civil Rights Policies and complaint processes and/or contact 
Shannon Sivell with any questions or to request assistance. 

Special thanks to DOJ’s Information Systems team Jennifer Lawrence, Darrin Jones, and Jeff 
Milam, who spent hours coordinating technology logistics, testing platforms, and supporting 
these sessions.

ADA                                           This is an acronym for the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 

which is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on 
disability and mandates accessibility requirements and reasonable 
accommodations by places of public accommodation and 
employers. 

  
ASL:                                           An acronym for American Sign Language.

Communities/populations      This phrase refers to communities and populations that. 
impacted by inequity:              experience discrimination, oppression, marginalization, and 
exclusion in social, political, and economic realms because of 
unequal power relationships across economic, political, social, 
and cultural dimensions.  These communities and populations 
include BIPOC, LGBTIQA2S+, people with disabilities, religious 
minorities, immigrant and refugee community members and any 
other identified historically marginalized or oppressed population.  
As one of the participants noted in a session, “There are 
influencers and leaders, resilient and hope-inspiring actions and 
initiatives, and much to learn from and respect in these cultures.” 
It is disempowering to label these communities as simply 
“marginalized and oppressed communities.”  

  
Dominant/ 
mainstream culture:                 language, religion, behavior, values, rituals, and social customs. 

The dominant culture in a society refers to the established 

  
Equity:                                       The distribution of resources, services, and treatment of 

These traits are often considered the norm for the society. 

individuals based on the needs of the recipients.  This concept is 
starkly different from equality, where distribution of resources, 
services, and treatment of individuals is the same, no matter the 
needs of the recipients. 

                         
Explicit bias:                              Refers to the attitudes and beliefs we have about a person or 
group on a conscious level.  These biases and their expression 
may arise as the direct result of a perceived threat.  

  
Gender Expansive:              

An umbrella term sometimes used to describe people that expand 
notions of gender expression and identity beyond what is 

 

25 

perceived as the expected gender norms for their society or 
context (beyond just man or woman, male or female, masculine 
or feminine; sometimes both; sometimes neither).  

  
Implicit bias:                              Refers to the attitudes, beliefs, and/or stereotypes that affect our 

understanding, actions, and decisions on an unconscious level. 

  
Intersectionality:                       The idea that race, class, gender, gender identity, sexual 
orientation, religion, national origin, disability, and other 
individual characteristics can overlap with one another and 
impact one’s experiences and worldview, especially related to 
privilege and discrimination. 

LGBTQIA2S+:                             An acronym for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer 
and/or Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, Two-Spirit, and the 
countless affirmative ways in which people choose to self-identify 
on the gender expansive and sexual identity spectrums. 

  
Othering:                                   To view or treat a person or group of people as intrinsically 

different from, alien to, and less than oneself or the 
dominant/mainstream culture. 

  
Procedural justice:                    Refers to the idea that when individuals and communities 

experience and see fairness and equity in the processes and 
systems that resolve disputes and allocate resources, they believe 
in and engage with those systems, creating safer and healthier 
larger communities. 

  
Services:                                    Any direct action taken to help, aid, support, assist, or respond to 

a person within a governmental or non-profit organization or 
system that serves the public. 

  
Service providers:                     Any person who provides a direct service to a person within a 

governmental or non-profit organization that serves the public. 
Service providers within the criminal justice system include law 
enforcement officers, 911 dispatchers, victim advocates, 
prosecutors, front desk staff, hotline operators, etc.
