CHILDREN AGE THIRTEEN TO EIGHTEEN 

 

Their “jobs” 

Their needs 

Signs of distress:  
(especially if it goes on 
for a long time) 
•  Excessive anger and 

negativity 

•  Excessive isolation, 

depression 
•  Trying to be “too 

•  Difficulty with school 

or peers 

•  Alcohol and drug 
use, sexual 
promiscuity 

•  Reminders that the 

good” 

•  To develop greater 
independence and 
separation from 
family 

•  To develop a sense 
of moral values 
(these may change) 

•  To express 

resistance and 
rebelliousness while 
forming their identity 
(much like two years 
old) 

•  To be naturally self-

centered 

•  Flexibility and 

understanding from 
parents regarding 
their time with friends 
and activities 

divorce-separation is 
not their fault 

•  Many teens want a 
say in the parenting 
plan 

•  Positive role models 
•  Reasonable, firm, 
and fair guidance 

AMPLE PARENTING SCHEDULES 

he  information  and  graphs  below  are  samples  of  parenting  time  schedules  based 
on children’s ages and different parenting styles.  They are provided as a tool to give 
you  ideas  in  order  to  help  you  create  your  own  personalized  schedule.    Parenting 
time should be scheduled based on the needs of each individual family.  You may fill 
out your own parenting schedule using the blank calendar below. 

Plan  A  Samples:    These  plans  are  best  suited  where  one  parent  has  not  been  the 
child’s  primary  caregiver  and/or  wants  regular  contact  but  is  not  able  to  provide 
extensive care-giving due to an inflexible work schedule or other circumstance. 

 

lan B Samples:   These  are  best  suited  for parents who have been involved  in the 
day-to-day care of the child and who want greater contact than is afforded in Level 
A plans. 

lan  C  Samples:    These  are  best  suited  for  parents  who  have  been  involved  to  a 

significant extent in the day-to-day care of the child and desire maximum contact. 

lan A:  A one or two-night weekend on alternate weeks, plus one evening 
every week.  Can also omit the evening or make it an overnight.  One home is 
“home base” for the child.  For example:
