1.0  Quick Start:  

Webex Events allow parties, their attorneys and the judge to engage interactively through video or audio conference 

technology, while allowing the public to access the proceeding. While the use of technology and remote hearings makes 

it possible for some or all parties to participate from alternative locations, courtroom etiquette and procedures still apply. 

Remote hearings will be conducted as similarly as possible to courtroom hearings, with consideration given to individual 

circumstances. Interpreters, staff, and judges participating in remote hearings should be in a quiet, private location with a 

professional background to limit interference. The following document is designed to help court interpreters prepare by 

ensuring they have the appropriate equipment, adequate internet connection and cell phone coverage to interpret a 

remote proceeding effectively.

1.2  Dual Channel Set-up (Simultaneous Interpreting)  

The following technique allows the interpreter to simultaneously interpret into the non-English language without 

being heard by other participants. This type of connection is more complex to set-up and should be tested in 

advance of the hearing. 

 

1.  Connect to the court/remote proceeding (“English line”) via Webex using a USB headset with microphone. 

Select use computer for audio and click, JOIN EVENT. 

•  Unmute  

  when interpreting the into English for the record or when the interpreter has a comment 

for the court.  

2.  Connect to the LEP participant via a cell phone using earbuds with a microphone.  

o 

dial *67 followed by the LEPs’ phone number (for example: *67 503 986 1234) 

•  Select Mute  

    while you are simultaneously interpreting into the non-English language for the 

LEP participant. 

The interpreter uses the USB headset and mic in one ear connected to the court and a separate 
headphone/earbud and mic in the other ear for the “non-English” line connected to the LEP.

1.3  Privileged communication: 

OPTION 1:   The interpreter, attorney and LEP participant are connected via cell phone by placing a 3-way call to 
the attorney’s private number. Interpretation is done consecutively; ask the attorney to disconnect when the 
consultation is concluded. 

EMEMBER: to mute 

 the headset connected to the court via Webex.

OPTION 2:   The court instructs other participants to disconnect from the Webex meeting, and/or clears the 
courtroom, and stops the FTR. The consultation is interpreted consecutively through the Webex platform. Other 
parties must re-join the Webex meeting once the consultation has concluded.

Network Bandwidth:  

Browser: 

The amount of network bandwidth required depends on the requirements of each video device to provide the desired video 
quality plus presentation data. At least 1.5 Mbps per screen is recommended for an optimal experience. Some video devices 
can take advantage of higher rates, and the service can accommodate lower rates, depending on the device. 

The Cisco Webex web app is available on Chrome, Internet Explorer version 10 and later, Firefox, and Safari 7 and later. For 
the best experience (including video support), we recommend using Chrome or Firefox.

or email invitation. Click the installation file to install it.  

Why Install the Webex Meetings Desktop App? 

The Webex Meetings desktop app automatically downloads after starting or joining a Webex meeting from a Webex site 

The Webex Meetings desktop app package includes two parts: the in-meeting app, which allows you to host or 

participate in meetings, and the pre-meeting app, which resides on your desktop. 

You can use the pre-meeting desktop app to manage your meetings, whether you have a Webex account or not. If you 

sign in with an account, you can start meetings instantly, schedule meetings, join your scheduled meetings, add 

integrations to join meetings from other apps, and detect nearby video devices. If you don't have an account or haven't 

signed in, you can still use the Webex Meetings desktop app as a guest to see your upcoming meetings, easily join your 

meetings, and connect to a video device. 

If you want to install the app without joining a meeting first, you can also download it manually. 

Go https://www.webex.com/downloads.html/ to get the download file, then follow steps below to install the file. 

1.  Run  the .msi (Windows)  or .dmg (Mac)  installation  file  and  follow  the  instructions.  The  Webex  Meetings 

desktop app opens when the installation is complete. 

2.  Enter your email address and select Sign In. 

3.  Select or enter your Webex site URL, and then enter your password. 

If you have a previous version of the Webex Meetings desktop app, you will have to uninstall that version before 

installing the new version.

4.0  Navigating the Webex Virtual Desktop 

The Webex virtual desktop is easy to navigate, with shared content or video in the center and  
meeting controls underneath. 

 

 

 

 

 

Use the mute  

   function while you are simultaneous interpreting into the non-English language for the LEP 

participant. Use the unmute  

   function to interpret into English for the record.  

 
o 

Use the mute function to prevent background noise from being heard. 

4.2  Screen Layouts in the Virtual Desktop App 

When you're in a meeting or an event and no content is being shared, manage video layouts to engage with fellow 
participants. The Floating view allows you to make the view of the other speaker full-screen. Select             at the top 
right of the screen. Floating view gives you control of where to position your other panels—like participants or chat—in 
relation to the video panel. You can even move them to a second monitor or resize them.

You can switch between the three different video layout views. There are advantages to using each of these video 
layouts. You can change views at any time depending on the number of active speakers and the total number of 
participants in your meeting or event. 

hen you join a meeting your default video layout is set to Single view. When there are more than two participants in the 
meeting you can change your video layout. If there are more than two participants in a meeting, you can switch between 
three different video views: 

Single view—Displays a full-screen video of the speaker. 

Overlay view—Displays the speaker in the primary video and provides thumbnail videos of the other participants. 

Grid view—Displays up to 16 participants at the same time.

Single view displays a full-screen video of whoever is speaking. The Single view is the video-only layout that is used in 
meetings between two people. 

•  Overlay View in the Virtual Desktop App 

The Overlay view is the default video-only layout and displays whoever is speaking in the primary video, while allowing 
you to see other participants’ thumbnails. You can see up to eight thumbnail videos of other participants. 

        TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 

     

 

 

 

 

             PAGE (11) 

The order of the thumbnail videos is based on who has the host and presenter roles, who has spoken most recently, who 
is showing their video, and alphabetical order. The participants who have spoken most recently appear first, followed by 
participants who are showing their video. 

•  Grid View in the Virtual Desktop App 

Grid view now allows you to see up to 16 participants at the same time. The sort order of the thumbnail videos is based 
on who has the host and presenter roles, who has spoken most recently, who is showing their video, and alphabetical 
order. The participants who have spoken most recently appear first, followed by participants who are showing their video.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
