      <pre>Oregon Statewide Family Law Advisory Committee (SFLAC) Recommendations 
for Oregon Courts:  Information for Parents sharing Custody or Parenting Time 
of Children During the COVID-19 Pandemic 

ue to the COVID-19 Pandemic, all schools in Oregon are closed for an extended period to 
reduce the transmission of the virus.  The American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers (AAML) 
and the Association of Family and Conciliation Courts (AFCC) have published important 
guidelines for parents during the pandemic (https://www.thecenterforfamilylaw.com/afcc-
aaml). 

he goal of these recommendations is to encourage the parties to follow their parenting plan as 
closely as possible, as doing so will ensure a level of consistency and stability that is in the 
children’s best interests.  These recommendations recognize Oregon’s policy of:  assuring minor 
children frequent and continuing contact with parents who have shown the ability to act in the 
children’s best interests; encouraging such parents to share in the rights and responsibilities of 
raising their children; encouraging parents to develop their own parenting plan and grant them 
discretion in developing such a plan; and considering the best interests of the children and 
safety of the parties in developing a parenting plan.  ORS 107.101. 

ECOMMENDED COURT CLARIFICATION: 

Unless the parties agree otherwise: 

1.  Definition of Spring Break, Summer Break/Vacation or Holidays:  While the schools are 
closed, parenting time shall continue as if the children are still attending school in 
accordance with the school calendar of the relevant district.  ‘Spring break,’ ‘summer 
break/vacation’ or other designated holidays, means the regularly calendared 
breaks/vacations or holidays in the school district where the children are attending 
school (or would attend school if they were school aged).  The closure of the school for 
public health purposes will not be considered an extension of any 
break/vacation/holiday period or weekend. 
 

2.  Denial of Parenting Time:  COVID-19 is not a reason to deny parenting time.  Unless 

otherwise ordered by the court, parents are considered fit to care for their children and 
make decisions regarding the day-to-day aspects of parenting while the children are in 
their care.  This day-to-day care includes following the Oregon Health Authority and 
your County Public Health directives regarding social distancing and sanitation-related 
measures (such as frequent handwashing). 
 

3.  Parenting Time in Public Places:  Governor Brown has forbidden all nonessential 

gatherings, regardless of size.  If the parenting plan states that parenting time will occur 
in a public place, parenting time should continue at locations that are permitted under 
the health and safety guidelines for the state, such as a large park or nature hike.  Public 
places where people routinely touch common contact surfaces (such as parks and play 
equipment) should be avoided.  However, activities where parents and children can

maintain social distancing and avoid such surfaces are encouraged.  If that is not 
possible, then the parenting time should be conducted virtually via videoconferencing or 
by telephone. 
 

4.  Supervised Parenting Time:  If parenting time is ordered to be supervised, and the 

supervisor is unavailable due to COVID-19-related issues or government orders, the 
parties should work collaboratively to ensure parenting time continues to occur in a 
manner that promotes their children’s safety and wellbeing, such as finding an 
alternative supervisor.  If that is not possible, then the parenting time should be 
conducted virtually via videoconferencing or by telephone. 
 

5.  Governor’s Executive Orders regarding Travel:  The Governor has issued executive 

orders that restrict travel except for essential activities, which generally include caring 
for minors, dependents and/or family members.  Therefore, unless otherwise directed 
by the Governor or other executive order, the parties should continue to follow the 
parenting plan as written while such orders are in effect. 
 

6.  Exchanges:  During the exchange of the children, all parties should follow the CDC 

guidelines for limiting the spread of the virus, which may mean choosing an alternate 
location for the exchanges that has less people congregating and less touching of public 
items (changing from the restaurant to the grocery store parking lot for example). 
 

7.  Safety-Related Issues:  Our first responders must remain available for true emergencies 

and for support related to the COVID-19 outbreak.  Please do not call them for 
parenting-related disputes but rather only in the circumstances of real, immediate, and 
significant safety-related reasons. 
 

8.  Transparency:  Unless the parties are restrained from communicating, parents are 

encouraged to communicate about precautions they are taking to slow the spread of 
COVID-19.  A parent is not permitted to deny parenting time based upon the other 
parent’s unwillingness to discuss their precautionary measures taken, or belief that the 
other parent’s precautions are insufficient. 
 

9.  Makeup Parenting Time:  If parenting time is missed due to COVID-19-related issues or 

government orders, parents are encouraged to work collaboratively to schedule 
makeup parenting time that promotes their children’s safety and wellbeing.  Local 
courts are strongly encouraged to order makeup parenting time, when appropriate.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
