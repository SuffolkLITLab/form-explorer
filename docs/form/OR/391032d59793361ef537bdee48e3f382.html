•	

    Fairness, equality, and integrity

•	

    Openness and timeliness

•	

    Independence, impartiality, and consistency

•	

    Excellence, innovation, and accountability

•	

    Respect, dignity, public service, and community well-being

A Message from the Chief Justice and  
the State Court Administrator

Dear Friends of the Courts:

On behalf of the Oregon Judicial Department, we are pleased to present 
our initial Five-Year Strategic Plan for 2009-2013. This plan represents 
our collective best efforts to further a process that began in 1992 to 
take the Oregon court system well into the 21st century as we fulfill our 
constitutional duties and pursue our mission to provide fair and accessible 
justice services that protect the rights of individuals, preserve community 
welfare, and inspire public confidence.

When the Judicial Department outlined its vision in Justice 2020: The 
New Oregon Trail (1995) and updated that report in 2001, we set the court 
system’s five long-term goals:

Paul J. De Muniz 
Chief Justice  

 

 

 

 

 

Access: Ensure access to court services for all people.

Trust and Confidence: Earn the public’s enduring trust and 
confidence.

Dispute Resolution: Help people choose the best way to resolve  
their disputes.

Partnerships: Build strong partnerships with local communities  
to promote public safety and quality of life.

Administration: Make courts work for people.

Today, as we are taking historic steps toward meeting those long-held goals, 
2020 is now less a vision than it is a fast-approaching horizon. With this strategic 
plan, however, we have every reason to welcome this next leg of our journey, 
challenging though it will be. 

In the pages that follow, you will see how our vision is transforming the courts of 
today into the courts of tomorrow. Our primary effort is to implement “Oregon 
eCourt,” a statewide web-based courthouse. Oregon eCourt will provide the public 
and our governmental partners 24-hour access to court information and services. 
As Oregon eCourt is phased in over the next several years, Oregon will become 
the first state to provide a statewide virtual courthouse, using technology to 
increase access to the courts, improve court efficiency, and ensure that judges have 
complete and timely information with which to make decisions. We will continue 
to work closely with the Legislative Assembly and other partners to create the tools 
necessary to meet the changing needs of Oregon’s citizens and businesses, and to 
accomplish that vision transparently and cost-effectively.

Kingsley W. Click  
State Court Administrator

As fundamental as Oregon eCourt is to the future of both the judiciary and 
Oregon’s citizenry, our five-year strategic plan also addresses other critical needs. 
For example, we no longer can ignore the importance of Oregon’s court facilities. 
Courthouses serve as a hub of civic activity, one that the public visits, uses, and 
relies upon every day. Just as courts preserve and enforce the rule of law, which is 
the foundation of American democracy, our courthouses must physically provide 
a safe and appropriate foundation for the services of a modern judicial system. 
Oregon’s courthouses are unsafe and insufficient in many parts of the state, and 
require our urgent attention.

As an accountable branch of government and a responsible steward of public funds, 
we recognize that a comprehensive strategic plan is essential to meet our goals and 
the public’s expectations. Toward that end, we identify our strategic priorities for 
the next five years and set out the ways in which we will turn those priorities into 
realities. Our plan provides a roadmap that addresses those critically important 
points that we must reach in the years ahead to not only maintain but to enhance 
the collective trust and confidence that has been placed in Oregon’s judicial branch.

This is not just our plan, the Supreme Court’s plan, the plan of Oregon’s presiding 
judicial officers, or even a plan that judicial administrators have devised. Instead, 
and in the truest sense of the words, this is the Oregon Judicial Department’s 
Five-Year Strategic Plan. As indebted as we are to the 22 people who participated 
in the leadership team to develop this plan, we also must commend the staff 
of the Oregon Judicial Department. When surveyed to comment on the draft 
plan, more than 84% of staff responded, and 1,110 of staff either suggested new 
recommendations or changes to proposed action items. Their combined thoughts 
and efforts truly make this document an expression of our collective vision and 
demonstrates the passion that our staff brings to the department’s mission.

The Oregon judicial branch has been unified as a matter of law since 1983. Today, 
25 years later, while the department remains appropriately diverse, we have become 
a unified branch as a matter of fact. We hope that you will support your state court 
system as we fulfill the judiciary’s vision over the next five years. 

Respectfully, 

Paul J. De Muniz

Plan Overview

The Oregon Judicial Department built this five-year strategic plan by (1) starting with 
general propositions — goals that have long provided the focus of our judicial mission; 
(2) breaking down those overarching propositions into the key performance areas that 
best promote the goals that we have pledged to achieve; and, finally, (3) identifying 
within those performance areas the specific action items that we believe will enhance 
most effectively our performance and, consequently, allow us to realize our goals.

Those goals, which we have refined in this plan, are both statewide and familiar:

1. 

Protect Public Access to Justice

2. 

Maintain Public Trust and Confidence

3. 

Provide Quality and Timely Dispute Resolution

4. 

Collaborate with Justice System Partners and Other Stakeholders

5. 

Enhance Judicial Administration

To achieve each of those five goals, our branch of government has identified a total of 15 
key performance areas that we will emphasize over the next five years. And, within each 
of those 15 key performance areas, we have adopted as few as one and as many as four 
separate action items. Finally, with respect to the individual action items themselves, we 
have further refined those items into the following categories:

1. 

Those that are essential to the judicial function;

2. 

Those that are strategically critical to the goals of the Judicial 

Department; and

time and resources allow.

3. 

Those that, although important, appropriately should be addressed as

GOAL  5

Oregon Judicial Department 2009 – 2013

The plan sets outs the individual action items in the following manners:

ESSENTIAL

There are two action items — the implementation of Oregon eCourt and our court 
facilities crisis — that are not bounded by the specific goals that the Judicial Department 
intends to accomplish through our five-year strategic plan.  Instead, those two essential 
items span either all or most of our goals and, if not completed (with respect to Oregon 
eCourt) or meaningfully addressed (with respect to our courthouses), will undermine all 
the department’s other efforts. Accordingly, those action items are presented up front 
and independently of the discussion that follows.

Strategically Critical

Our plan sets out what we have identified as the 21 strategically critical items for judicial 
action in bold-faced type under their appropriate key performance areas. We will 
address these strategically critical action items either after or, to the degree possible, 
along with the first two essential action items of Oregon eCourt and Court Facilities.

As Time and Resources Permit

We believe that each action item is important and worthy of implementation, but 
we also recognize the finite nature of both time and resources.  In light of those 
realities, the remaining 17 action items most likely will be acted upon only as time and 
resources permit.

The scope and breadth of the action items that we have identified in this plan also 
suggest the multiple demands that we face. Those demands, which seldom are 
consistent, can come from federal or state statutes, from a heavy docket of increasingly 
complex cases, or simply from the institutional needs of a viable branch of government. 
Whatever those demands may be, the Oregon Judicial Department will remain prudent 
in allocating — that is, prioritizing — its resources over the next five years. Nevertheless, 
it is important for us to know that the people we serve understand that those demands 
are ever present.

Plan Goals

The strategic goals set out in this plan derive from and align closely with the vision and 
values that the Oregon Judicial Department has been developing since 1992. Those core 
principles were set out seven years ago in Justice 2020: A Vision for Oregon’s Courts (2001). 
This five-year plan — for 2009 through 2013 — adopts a number of action items that the 
judiciary will use to focus that vision and implement those values. As our overarching 
departmental mission statement and statement of values demonstrate, the Oregon 
court system has a strong and continued commitment to providing justice and serving 
Oregonians.

To advance our mission statement, statement of values, and vision for the Oregon court 
system, we have set the following as our goals:

GOAL 1: 
PROTECT PUBLIC ACCESS TO JUSTICE

Oregon’s courts are committed to providing equal access, ensuring fairness, and 
enforcing the rule of law. Everyone has a right to accessible justice. Our courts provide 
all people with the help and information that they need to resolve their disputes quickly 
and fairly, and at a reasonable cost. We help to secure legal representation for those 
who need it and to assist those who represent themselves. Oregon courts strive to be 
safe, easy to use, free from barriers, and culturally responsive. County courthouses will 
continue to stand as symbols of assurance that justice will remain available to everyone 
throughout the state. Our courts will use state-of-the-art technology to ensure that the 
services that we provide meet people’s diverse needs.

GOAL 2: 
MAINTAIN PUBLIC TRUST AND CONFIDENCE

Preserving and enforcing the rule of law is one of the cornerstones of our democracy. 
Oregon’s courts strive to be impartial, fair, and accountable. As an equal branch of 
government, we work closely with the executive and legislative branches to ensure 
justice for all, to preserve the traditional judicial function, and to secure adequate 
resources to fulfill our responsibilities. The Oregon court system supports judicial 
operations in every county by providing coordinated services related to technology, 
court improvement, and education.

Oregon Judicial Department 2009 – 2013

GOAL 3: 
PROVIDE QUALITY AND TIMELY DISPUTE RESOLUTION 

At a fundamental level, courts work to resolve conflicts fairly, timely, appropriately, and 
cost-effectively. We must continually develop innovative procedures to meet those often 
disparate demands. Effective caseflow management makes justice possible not only in 
individual cases but also across the entire justice system. Effective court management 
helps to ensure that everyone receives due process and equal access to justice. Oregon 
courts will continue to work to provide access to the dispute resolution methods most 
suited to the parties’ needs, whether it be mediation, a timely jury trial, or some other 
process. Judicial administration organized around the requirements of effective caseflow, 
dispute resolution techniques, and trial management enhances justice.

GOAL 4: 
COLLABORATE WITH JUSTICE SYSTEM PARTNERS AND OTHER 
STAKEHOLDERS 

The judicial branch alone cannot solve difficult societal problems. Oregon courts work 
actively with their public and private partners and volunteers to strengthen the work 
of the courts and to improve safety in our communities. Together, we promote public 
safety and quality of life, improve the lives of children and families, help provide a stable 
and predictable environment with consistent enforcement of economic and property 
rights, and protect the most vulnerable members of our communities. Toward those 
ends, many judicial districts have adopted various specialty court models (such as family 
courts, domestic violence courts, restitution courts, and community courts) that allow 
us to meet local community needs. In those and other areas, judges are committed to 
applying best practices to enhance outcomes for all those we serve.

GOAL 5: 
ENHANCE JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION

Oregon courts must use the resources of Oregonians wisely. We are accountable to the 
law, to the other branches of government, and to the public. The effective administration 
of justice requires deliberate attention to and improvement of the core processes of our 
court system.

Oregon eCourt

Oregon eCourt will transform how our court system serves the people of this state. It 
is our primary statewide undertaking for the next five years, the largest technology 
program that we have ever taken in support of our judges and courts, and has received 
both support and funding from the Oregon Legislative Assembly. Oregon eCourt is the 
forefront of the state court system’s strategic plan. The scope of this major initiative 
described in the pages that follow addresses, supports, and enhances every one of the 
five goals that we have set for ourselves. 

Oregon eCourt will implement technology to shift the present paper-based system to a 
digital universe of information and services. That technology will transform how private 
businesses, public agencies, and individuals obtain information and services from our 
courts. It will transform how judges, court staff, and consumers of judicial services work. 
From the limits of a paper document available at a single courthouse during an eight-
hour business day, Oregon eCourt will provide an open forum available 24 hours a day, 
every day of the year, for documents, court information, and case-related filing and 
payment services.

Oregon eCourt will produce those results by constructing a standard technology 
infrastructure in our courthouses to give judges and staff the information management 
resources that they need to provide just, prompt, and safe resolution of disputes; 
improve public safety; enhance the quality of life in our communities; and make a 
difference in the lives of children and families in crisis. For example, eCourt will provide 
the following:

A single web portal for access to any court, at any time, from anywhere, 
for eFiling, obtaining information about court programs and services, 
and making payments

Web-based services such as multilingual guides, fill-in-the-blank court 
forms, and self-help centers 

Web access to court documents, calendars, case records, exhibits, and 
other digital content 

Video court appearances from any place with an internet connection, a 
camera, and bandwidth

Video conferencing for trainings and meetings 

Wireless web access in every courthouse

Standardized business pr

ocesses across the state

Those features will combine to enhance the public’s trust and confidence in the Oregon 
court system by enriching judicial administration, improving both the quality and 
timeliness of dispute resolution, expanding access to justice, and permitting more 
efficient collaboration with our justice system partners and other stakeholders — all 
in the service of responsible stewardship of public resources and excellence in the 
achievement of our public missions. At the same time, Oregon eCourt will not replace in-
person services at a physical courthouse. Those traditional services will remain available, 
just as they are today, and hearings and trials will continue to convene in courthouses 
across the state and be open to the public.

In short, Oregon eCourt is the most comprehensive electronic court effort undertaken in 
a state court system in the United States. Its successful implementation lies at the core of 
our vision for Oregon’s courts.

Court Facilities

Oregon has a significant court facilities problem. The inadequacy of many of the 50-
plus court facilities across the state has been both documented (Report on Oregon Court 
Facilities, 2006; Court Facility Assessments, 2008) and broadly acknowledged but not yet 
addressed. The difficulties impact not only the ability of judges and staff to perform 
their jobs effectively, but, in several counties, threaten lives in the event of a catastrophe. 
The problem has reached crisis proportions in many counties. Adequate court facilities 
are essential to maintain the judicial branch as a cornerstone of our constitutional 
democracy and to the justice system’s obligation to preserve and enforce the rule of law.

Even a quick review of our court facilities statewide reveals the following deficiencies: 
one courthouse — this state’s largest and most heavily used — that likely will crumble 
onto several thousand citizens during even a modest earthquake; one courthouse 
that loses its electricity several times a year, sometimes for several days at a time; one 
courthouse in which the judge has difficulty seeing the jury; one courthouse in which 
people must go to another building to use a restroom; and many courthouses that are 
so overcrowded that they cannot meet the demands of their growing populations. In 
some counties, dangerous electrical systems cannot support modern technology and 
run-down and inadequate heating and plumbing systems threaten health and safety. 
Serious overcrowding is the rule, rather than the exception. In 2004, the United States 
Supreme Court ruled that courts have a special responsibility under the United States 
Constitution to ensure physical access to their facilities; too many of Oregon’s court 
facilities are unable to meet that responsibility.

The judicial branch does not have a single iconic building that represents the 
institution; rather, it is symbolized in every county by a county courthouse that 
provides continuous assurance that justice is available to everyone in every community. 
In many communities, not only does the courthouse symbolize the availability of 
justice to all, but it also provides the seat of county government and the focal point of 
community life. Today, however, that symbol is often a tarnished one, and the focus is 
an eyesore rather than a beacon.

When the legislature decided 30 years ago to assume responsibility for funding court 
operations, counties retained responsibility for maintaining, refurbishing, and replacing 
courthouses. The availability of adequate court facilities, however, should not turn 
on local political interests, the wealth or lack of wealth in a county, or the competing 
local needs of the moment. Even so, that division of responsibility also creates unique 
opportunities for imaginative and mutually beneficial solutions for all Oregonians.

In the next five years, our branch of government must continue to work in association 
with the legislature, the governor, the counties, and the bar to develop and implement 
a long-term statewide court facilities funding system to upgrade court facilities 
across the state. The strategy must respond to all interests, account for the unique 
circumstances of each county, and reflect the statewide interests in a fully functioning 
judicial system.

Key Performance Areas

USER-FRIENDLY COURTS

To ensure that everyone has an opportunity to be heard and has meaningful access 
to dispute resolution, Oregon courts must continue to explore and understand the 
ever-changing dynamics of Oregon’s population. We must expand and enhance our 
current educational materials to inform participants about court processes. Our courts 
must have dignified, secure, and accessible physical facilities. Across the nation, courts 
are experiencing an increasing number of unrepresented persons. In Oregon, for 
example, 86 percent of marriage dissolution or separation cases involve at least one 
unrepresented party.

Our courts were founded on the proposition that everyone is equal before the law. 
Judges make critically important decisions that affect the lives of our children, their 
families, and our most vulnerable adults.

GOALS

JUROR EXPERIENCE

Juries are an essential and valued component of the American justice system. Courts 
work to encourage participation by all eligible citizens who are summoned to serve as 
jurors and to make their experiences as positive as possible. All Oregonians benefit from a 
citizenry that is active, interested, able, and willing to serve when summoned for jury duty.

Action Items

STRATEGICALLY CRITICAL

Evaluate and expand programs aimed at increasing the number of citizens 
responding to jury summonses and improving the quality of jurors’ 
experiences, for example, through the use of “one-trial or one-day”

AS TIME AND RESOURCES PERMIT 

Work with bar associations to establish and advance best practices for jury trials 
in local jurisdictions

COURT SECURITY AND BUSINESS CONTINUITY 

Our courts are committed to providing safe and secure facilities that will ensure the 
availability of justice in Oregon’s communities. Emergencies, disasters, and accidents 
affecting court operations can occur at any time, usually without warning. Proper 
planning and a prompt response are essential to ensure continued court services and 
access to court records.

Action Item

STRATEGICALLY CRITICAL

Implement the statewide security, emergency preparedness, and  
business continuity plans, and continue developing and testing local  
and division plans

Oregon Judicial Department 2009 – 2013

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY

The Oregon Legislative Assembly sets the budget for the state court system. Resources, 
however, are rarely sufficient to meet all the demands for court services. Consequently, 
the judiciary must allocate expenditures to maximize value to the courts, the public, and 
the public safety system.

Action Items

STRATEGICALLY CRITICAL

Develop programs to improve the effective collection of monetary  
orders – restitution, fines, and fees – and compliance with related court 
orders to increase individual accountability to the justice system, victims, 
and society

Develop a robust management system that allows for projection, 
analysis, and reporting of budgets and expenditures at a variety of 
organizational levels

PUBLIC OUTREACH

Oregon’s courts recognize the importance of public outreach and education, which 
includes providing information to the other two branches of our state government. 
Civics education is an important part of keeping the public well-informed about our 
constitutional democracy.

Action Items

STRATEGICALLY CRITICAL

Expand outreach efforts designed to enhance public understanding of 
the judiciary and its processes

AS TIME AND RESOURCES PERMIT

Goal 3: 
Provide Quality and Timely Dispute 
Resolution

At a fundamental level, courts work to resolve conflicts fairly, timely, appropriately, and 
cost-effectively. We must continually develop innovative procedures to meet those often 
disparate demands. Effective caseflow management makes justice possible not only in 
individual cases but also across the entire justice system. Effective court management 
helps to ensure that everyone receives due process and equal access to justice. Oregon 
courts will continue to work to provide access to the dispute resolution methods 
most suited to the parties’ needs, whether it be mediation, a timely jury trial, or some 
other process. Judicial administration organized around the requirements of effective 
caseflow, dispute resolution techniques, and trial management enhances justice.

Key Performance Areas

CASEFLOW MANAGEMENT

Oregon courts recognize the importance of minimizing delay — from case filing to final 
disposition — and strive to manage cases according to the Oregon Standards of Timely 
Disposition. Litigants and witnesses must be able to count on court dates. Oregon courts 
must continue to offer a wide array of options for conflict resolution. Alternatives short 
of trial may produce the best results for particular litigants, use fewer resources, and 
provide more timely resolution of cases.

Action Items

STRATEGICALLY CRITICAL

Update and ensure compliance with the Oregon Standards of Timely 
Disposition by implementing local best practices for caseflow 
management

Offer the full range of dispute resolution options to resolve cases  
before trial

AS TIME AND RESOURCES PERMIT 

Continue dispute resolution education for judges, litigants, and the public

COURT TECHNOLOGY

Technology has altered dramatically the way in which businesses, government, and 
individuals function. Oregon courts are adapting to those changes.

Action Items

STRATEGICALLY CRITICAL

Ensure that every court and courtroom meets baseline technology 
standards for providing audio, video, and telephonic capabilities, and for 
creating and maintaining accurate court records 

AS TIME AND RESOURCES PERMIT 

Work with law enforcement to develop and expand the use of citations that are 
electronically generated and eFiled

Promote and expand the use of technology for staff and judicial training  
and meetings

COMMERCIAL COURTS

Oregon courts are committed to the needs of the business sector for fair, efficient, and 
timely resolution of disputes. Commercial courts provide the judicial oversight and 
expertise needed to resolve complex commercial disputes.

Action Items

STRATEGICALLY CRITICAL

Create a statewide pool of judges trained to manage complex litigation 
and expand the availability of commercial courts in Oregon

AS TIME AND RESOURCES PERMIT 

Ensure that appropriate courtroom space and staff are available for  
complex litigation

Goal 4: 
Collaborate with Justice System Partners 
and Other Stakeholders

The judicial branch alone cannot solve difficult societal problems. Oregon courts work 
actively with their public and private partners and volunteers to strengthen the work 
of the courts and to improve safety in our communities. Together, we promote public 
safety and quality of life, improve the lives of children and families, help provide a stable 
and predictable environment with consistent enforcement of economic and property 
rights, and protect the most vulnerable in our communities. Toward those ends, many 
judicial districts have adopted various specialty court models (such as family courts, 
domestic violence courts, restitution courts, and community courts) that allow us to 
meet local community needs. In those and other areas, judges and staff are committed 
to applying best practices to enhance outcomes for all those we serve.

Key Performance Areas

TREATMENT COURTS

Treatment courts represent the combined efforts of justice and treatment professionals 
to intervene and break the cycle of substance abuse, addiction, crime, delinquency, 
and child maltreatment. Treatment courts are evidence-based programs that make a 
difference in the lives of court participants by improving social skills and education as 
well as addressing addiction issues.

Action Items

STRATEGICALLY CRITICAL

Create an adequate and stable system of staffing and funding for existing 
and future treatment courts

AS TIME AND RESOURCES PERMIT 

Work with nationally recognized research institutions and Oregon stakeholders 
to evaluate treatment courts and analyze recidivism rates for those who 
successfully complete treatment courts compared to those whose cases are 
processed through the traditional court system

Develop multidisciplinary training for treatment court members and educational 
materials for the public and the media on treatment courts 

Develop a statewide annual report for treatment courts

JUVENILE PROGRAMS

Juvenile courts were the first type of specialized judicial intervention intended not 
only to adjudicate but also to oversee a process for rehabilitating youth and improving 
future conduct. They hold parents and social workers mutually accountable for their 
participation in the process of supporting and encouraging changes in family dynamics. 
Juvenile courts also hold juvenile corrections staff and youth mutually accountable 
for participation in rehabilitative services. Active judicial involvement is necessary and 
increases the likelihood of successful outcomes for children, youth, and families.

Action Items

STRATEGICALLY CRITICAL

Advance the goals of the Juvenile Court Improvement Program to 
improve the safety, permanency outcomes, and well-being of children in 
dependency cases 

Develop tools and training to improve the handling of delinquency cases 
and to address over-representation of minorities in dependency and 
delinquency cases 

AS TIME AND RESOURCES PERMIT 

Support a robust and well-trained Citizen Review Board volunteer program for 
reviewing case plans for children in foster care

GOVERNMENT PARTNERS

The legislative and executive branches of state government enact the statutory 
framework within which courts operate, recommend and appropriate judicial funding, 
and assist both directly and indirectly in the enforcement of court judgments. Moreover, 
local and state agencies continually interact with courts across a broad spectrum of 
activities. It is essential that, as one of the branches of state government, we continue to 
collaborate and communicate with our governmental partners to ensure that Oregon’s 
judiciary remains both vital and responsive.

Action Items

STRATEGICALLY CRITICAL

Improve information sharing with the legislature and other 
governmental entities

Improve information sharing with other stakeholders in the justice 
system and increase the judiciary’s involvement in intergovernmental 
committees

Goal 5: 
Enhance Judicial Administration

Oregon courts must use the resources of Oregonians wisely. We are accountable 
to the law, to the other branches of government, and to the public. The effective 
administration of justice requires deliberate attention to and improvement of the 
core processes of our court system.

Key Performance Areas

PERFORMANCE MEASURES

The Oregon court system is recognized nationally for developing a comprehensive 
statewide performance measurement system that is focused on continually 
improving court operations. Court leaders need ready access to information that 
allows them to evaluate and manage court operations. We promote a performance 
measurement system that communicates a clear, simple, and penetrating business 
purpose, and provides the right information to the right people at the right time.  

Action Items
