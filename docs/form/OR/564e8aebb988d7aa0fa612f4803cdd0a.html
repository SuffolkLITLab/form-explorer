      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre>Many	immigrants	
are	fearful	of	
admitting	that	
they	have	been	a	
victim	of	a	crime	
in	part	because	
they	believe	they	
will	be	removed	
(deported)	from	
the	United	States	
if	they	report	the	
crime.	Officials	
such	as	police	of-
ficers,	healthcare	
providers,	judges,	
and	prosecutors	
are	often	the	first	
to	see	the	signs	of	violence	and	are	therefore	in	a	unique	
position	to	provide	information	and	assistance	to	those	
who	have	been	victims.	This	brochure	is	designed	to	

assist	front-line	workers	
in	this	endeavor.

U.S.	law	provides	several	
protections	for	legal	and	
undocumented	immi-
grants	who	have	been	
victims	of	a	crime.	Often	
victims	are	unaware	of	
such	protections,	thus	
frontline	workers	serve	as	
a	critical	link	for	immi-
grant	victims.	There	are	specific	protections	for	victims	
of	domestic	violence,	victims	of	certain	crimes,	and	
victims	of	human	trafficking.

All	agencies	within	the	Department	of	Homeland	
Security	(DHS),	including	USCIS,	are	legally	prohibited	
from	disclosing	that	a	victim	has	applied	for	VAWA,	T,	or	
U	immigration	benefits.

Victims are not required to be in legal immigration 
status, but they must:

•	 Be	a	victim	of	a	severe	form	of	trafficking	in	persons,

•	 Be	physically	present	in	the	United	States	on	account	

of	the	trafficking,

•	 Comply	with	any	reasonable	requests	for	assistance	
in	the	investigation	or	prosecution	(or	be	under	the	
age	of	18),	and

•	 Suffer	extreme	hardship	involving	unusual	and	
severe	harm	if	removed	from	the	United	States.

To	apply	for	a	T	nonimmigrant	status,	applicants	must	
file	Form	I-914,	Application	for	T	Nonimmigrant	
Status.	Qualifying	family	members	may	also	be	eligible	
to	apply	for	benefits.

Immigration Options 
for Victims of Crimes

Information for Law Enforcement, 
Healthcare Providers, and Others

Violence Against Women Act 
U Nonimmigrant Status 
T Nonimmigrant Status

M-779 (02/10)

Violence Against Women Act

VAWA	provisions	apply	equally	to	men	and	women.

(VAWA) Self-Petitioners

Victims	of	domestic	violence,	whether	a	spouse,	child,	
or	parent	of	the	abuser,	may	self-petition	by	filing	Form	
I-360,	Petition	for	Widow(er)s,	Amerasians,	and	Special	
Immigrants.	This	form	is	available	on	USCIS’	website,	
www.uscis.gov.

U Nonimmigrant Status

U	nonimmigrant	status	(or	U	visa)	offers	immigration	
protection	for	victims	and	is	also	a	tool	for	law	enforce-
ment.	To	obtain	U	status,	the	victim	must	obtain	a	cer-
tification	from	law	enforcement,	however,	law	enforce-
ment	officials	should	note	that	providing	a	certification	
does	not	grant	a	benefit—only	USCIS	has	the	authority	
to	grant	or	deny	this	benefit.

Victims are not required to be in legal immigration 
status, but they must:

•	 Be	a	victim	of	qualifying	criminal	activity	and	have	
suffered	substantial	physical	or	mental	abuse	as	a	
result	of	the	crime,

•	 Possess	credible	and	reliable	information	about	the	

qualifying	criminal	activity,

•	 Be,	have	been,	or	are	likely	to	be	helpful	to	the	investi-
gation	and/or	prosecution	of	that	qualifying	criminal	
activity,	and

•	 Be	a	victim	of	criminal	activity	that	violated	a	U.S.	law.

Victims of the following crimes may be eligible for a  
U nonimmigrant visa:

Abduction		

Manslaughter		

Abusive	Sexual	Contact		

Rape		

Blackmail

Murder		

Domestic	Violence	

Obstruction	of	Justice		

Extortion	

Witness	Tampering		

False	Imprisonment

Prostitution

Female	Genital	Mutilation	

Sexual	Assault		

Perjury

Felonious	Assault		

Hostage	Taken		

Incest

Peonage		

Kidnapping	

Slave	Trade		

Torture		

Trafficking

Sexual	Exploitation		

Unlawful	Criminal	Restraint

Involuntary	Servitude		

Other	Related	Crimes

To	apply	for	U	nonimmigrant	status,	the	victim	must	
file	Form	I-918,	Petition	for	U	Nonimmigrant	Status.	
Law	enforcement	official	must	certify	Form	I-918,	
Supplement	B.	Qualifying	family	members	may	also	be	
eligible	to	apply	for	benefits.

Some	immigrants	may	be	afraid	to	report	acts	of	
domestic	violence	to	the	police	or	to	seek	other	forms	
of	assistance.	Such	fear	causes	many	immigrants	to	
remain	in	abusive	relationships.

Victims	of	domestic	violence	who	are	the	child,	parent,	
or	current/former	spouse	of	a	United	States	citizen	
or	a	permanent	resident	(green	card	holder)	and	are	
abused	by	the	citizen	or	permanent	resident	may	be	
eligible	to	apply	for	a	green	card	themselves	without	
needing	the	abuser	to	file	for	immigration	benefits	
on	their	behalf.	This	provision	of	the	law	was	created	
under	the	Violence	Against	Women	Act	(VAWA).

Victims must establish that they:

•	 Have	or	had	a	qualifying	relationship	with	the	
abuser	spouse,	or,	are	the	parent	or	child	of	the	
abuser,

•	 Reside	or	resided	with	the	abuser,

•	 Have	good	moral	character,	and

•	 Have	been	victims	of	battery	or	extreme	cruelty.

T Nonimmigrant Status

Trafficking	in	persons—also	known	as	“human	
trafficking”—is	a	form	of	modern-day	slavery.	
Traffickers	prey	on	many	types	of	people,	often	includ-
ing	individuals	who	are	poor,	unemployed,	underem-
ployed,	or	who	lack	the	safety	and	protection	of	strong	
social	networks.	Victims	are	often	lured	under	the	false	
pretenses	of	good	jobs	and	better	lives,	and	then	forced	
to	work	under	brutal	and	inhumane	conditions.	Many	
believe	that	human	trafficking	is	a	problem	that	only	
occurs	in	other	countries—but	human	trafficking	also	
happens	in	the	United	States.

The	T	nonimmigrant	status	(or	T	visa)	provides	im-
migration	protection	to	victims	of	severe	forms	of	
trafficking	in	persons	who	assist	law	enforcement	in	
the	investigation	and	prosecution	of	human	trafficking	
cases.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
