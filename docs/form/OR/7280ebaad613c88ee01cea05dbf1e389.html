      <pre>Administrative Child Support Proceedings (continued)

“Claim of Risk” for Safety Protection:
•

If you would like to get child support or medical coverage from
the person who has abused you but do not want that person to
be able to get your personal identifying information for safety
reasons, ask your worker for a “Client Safety Packet.”  If you  fill
out the “Claim of Risk” and “Address of Record” forms and give a
contact address, the State of Oregon must protect the
confidentiality of your personal identifying information and home
address in establishing or collecting child support.

“Address of Record” for Basic Protection:
•

An address of record (for example, a post office box or other
contact address) may be used in place of a home address on all
the paperwork in your support case.  This does not protect your
personal identifying information.  If you want this protection, tell
your child support worker and fill out the “Address of Record”
form.  Your address of record must be in the state in which you
live, and it should be an address where you get your mail
regularly (every one or two days).

WHAT OTHER FORMS OF INFORMATION PROTECTION ARE
THERE?

Name and Social Security Number Change

If your situation is very dangerous, you may want to think about
changing your identity by changing your (and/or your child’s) name
and Social Security number.  These changes take time and can
mean a loss of your work history, education history, rental history,
credit history, references, family, friends, etc.  Changing your identity
is not completely safe.  Computers have made it easier to find
survivors who have changed their identities.  If you are thinking
about changing your name and Social Security number, it is best to
talk to an attorney.  

YOU CAN TAKE MANY OTHER STEPS TO KEEP YOUR
INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL

• Use a private post office box rather than your home address

whenever you can.  Sign up for a post office box before you move to
a new address (the post office box provider’s records will only have
your old address).

• For extra protection, get a post office box in another city.  Make sure
that you will be able to pick up or get your mail every few days.

• Get an unpublished and unlisted phone number.
•
• Get a national or local voicemail number instead of a home phone

If your state has Caller ID, order Complete Blocking.

number.

• Have your name taken out of any “reverse directories.”
• Do not use your middle initial.

• Put your utilities in someone else’s name.  Rent an apartment with
utilities included or put the utilities in a roommate’s name.  Talk to
your utility companies about ways to protect yourself.

• Be very careful with your Social Security number.  Do not give it out
unless required by law.  Do not use it as an identifier for health
insurance or other purposes.  If your health insurance provider wants
to use your Social Security number, ask to use a different number.

• Ask Credit Bureaus to “flag” your records to prevent fraudulent

access.

• Use an email address that does not include information that your

abuser might know or recognize. 

• Do not put your name on the front of your home or on the list of

tenants on the front of your apartment building.

If you have questions about taking these steps or need help with safety
planning, you may want to talk to an advocate at your local shelter or
victim services program.

CONFIDENTIALITY
(PRIVACY) PROTECTIONS
FOR SURVIVORS OF
SEXUAL ASSAULT,
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, 
AND STALKING

If you have been a victim of sexual assault,
domestic violence, or stalking, you may want
to take steps to keep information about you
away from your abuser.

This pamphlet has information about 
some of the ways you can keep your
information private.

Oregon Law Center and the 
Domestic Violence Subcommittee,
State Family Law Advisory Committee

June 2007

(General educational use only.  Not a substitute for
individual legal advice.  Consult an attorney for more
information or for advice.  The information in this pamphlet is
accurate as of June 2007.  Please remember the law is
always changing through actions of the courts, legislature,
and agencies.)

WHAT IS PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION?
• Personal identifying information is personal facts about you, such as
your Social Security number, driver’s license number, credit card
numbers, bank or other financial account numbers or locations,
maiden name, birth date, and place of birth that are not contact
information, which is explained below.

WHAT IS CONTACT INFORMATION?
• Contact information is information that can be used to find or contact
you, such as your name, address, telephone number, and your
employer’s name and address.

WHERE IS THIS INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC?
• Personal identifying and contact information may be in public
records, such as court files, mortgage and deed records, and
records of school districts, state agencies, offices, and governing
bodies.

• Personal identifying and contact information can also be found in

other records, such as school records, that may not be available to
the public but may be available to the other parent of your children.
Information about you may also be found on the Internet, on your
computer, or in other places.

•

WHY MIGHT I WANT CONFIDENTIALITY (PRIVACY)
PROTECTION?
•

In the hands of an abuser or stalker, personal identifying or contact
information may be used to find, hurt, or bother you or a family
member.

• An abuser may use your information to commit financial fraud.
•

If you have been a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or
stalking, you may want to take steps to keep your personal
identifying and contact information confidential (private).

Address Confidentiality Program

Starting on January 1, 2007, the Oregon Address Confidentiality
Program (ACP) became available for victims of domestic violence,
sexual assault, and stalking whose safety is at risk and who have
moved to a place in the state that is unknown to their abusers.  This
program provides a “substitute address” that can be used in place of a
residential (home) or contact address and provides a mail forwarding
service.  In addition, ACP participants will be able to keep their home
addresses out of public records when registering to vote, applying for
marriage or drivers licenses, public assistance, and more.  For 
information about whether this program is right for you or for a referral 
to an Application Assistant, call 503.373.1323 or 888.559.9090 (toll 
free), or go to the website:
http://www.doj.state.or.us/victims/pages/confidentiality.aspx.

Public Bodies

You can ask any public body to keep your home address and
telephone number private if release of that information would
endanger you or a family member you live with.  (ORS 192.445) A
public body is a school district, a state agency (such as the
Department of Human Services or DMV), a county, city, or state
governing body, or any other public agency (like a public utility
district).  You must send a request for confidentiality directly to each
public body from which you want protection.

To ask for confidentiality from a public body, you should call or write
the public body or agency to find out about its forms and procedures
for keeping information confidential.  If your request for
confidentiality is granted by a public body, your information will be
kept confidential for five years.  After that time, you must make a
new request.

Be prepared to provide evidence in support of your request. 
Evidence may be police reports, court records, medical reports,
your own statements, or a court order that shows a release of
information may put you in danger.

For example, you may ask that DMV not disclose your home
address on DMV records by completing a Request for Confidential
Address Protection form and including proof that your safety or that
of a family member living with you is in danger.

Department of Human Services (DHS)

If you are asking for or getting benefits from DHS, such as TANF,
TA-DVS, or food stamps and are worried about your safety, you
should speak with your worker.  There are several ways that DHS
may be able to help you protect your personal identifying and
contact information.

Most court proceedings require that you give personal identifying
and contact information in court papers.  This information may be
kept private in some circumstances.  Keeping this information
protected in court cases can be complicated.  It may be best to ask
an attorney to help you.
• All Court Cases

Because courts are public bodies, you can ask that your home
address and telephone number be kept confidential if that
information would put you or a family member at risk.  To ask
about confidentiality, you should speak with a court clerk.

• Criminal Court Cases

# If you ask, your address and phone number can be kept

from the defendant in a criminal proceeding.

# You can get more information about your rights in criminal
cases by talking to a victims’ assistant in your local district 
attorney’s office and at
http://www.doj.state.or.us/victims/assistance.shtml

HOW CAN I KEEP MY INFORMATION OUT OF PUBLIC RECORDS?
There are several ways to ask that your personal identifying and
contact information be kept private and out of public records. 

Court Cases

• Family Law and Child Support Court Cases

You may use a contact address and telephone number in place of a
home address or telephone number in your court papers.  You do
not need special permission to do this.

Limited Protection for Social Security Numbers and Personal
Identifying Information
# In divorce cases, Social Security numbers must be put in a
“Segregated Information Sheet” that will be kept apart from
your other court papers and out of court papers that are open
to the public.  To do this, you will need to fill out a special
affidavit, as well as a “Segregated Information Sheet.”  Note:
While this law does not apply in unmarried parent cases, some
courts chose to apply it anyway. Check with your local court.

# You can also use this procedure to keep other personal

identifying information out of the public file, but you cannot use
it to protect contact information.

# Information in the “Segregated Information Sheet” can be

released by the court to anyone with a right to the information. 
This may include the other party to your case if he or she asks
for it and the judge agrees to release it.

Special Protection for Personal Identifying and Contact
Information
# If you have children and are afraid of the other parent (or of
someone else), you may ask to keep personal identifying
information and/or contact information out of court records that
are open to the public.

# If this protection is granted, the information cannot be

released except after a hearing, at which the court must
consider the safety risks to you and/or your children.  
# To ask for this special protection, you should talk to an

attorney.  In some counties, a family law facilitator may be able
to give you forms and some help.

• Other Civil Court Cases

# You may use the special affidavit for Social Security numbers

to protect personal identifying information in other civil court
cases (such as landlord-tenant and small claims cases).
# It is possible for the court to give you more complete protection
in extreme circumstances.  See an attorney for more help. 

Administrative Child Support Proceedings

“Good Cause” for Noncooperation with State Child Support Program:
•

If you are on public assistance or OHP and there is no safe way for
the State to collect child support from the person who abused you,
you may have “good cause” to ask that the State not take any steps
to collect support.  Situations involving rape, incest, sexual assault,
or domestic violence can support “good cause” not to collect support
from the abuser.  If you have a “good cause” situation, tell your child
support worker and ask for a “Client Safety Packet.” (continued on
