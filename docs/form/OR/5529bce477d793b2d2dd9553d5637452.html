      <pre>The courts use Webex to host these remote hearings. Webex is the 
preferred technology for BOTH video and audio remote hearings in 
partially remote and fully remote hearing scenarios.

his guide is for attorneys set to appear on a case that will be held remotely. Webex Events allows for the parties, 

their attorneys, and the Judge to engage interactively through video or audio conference technology. 

  T

Dos and Don’ts for a Remote Hearing 

•  Make sure you are in a private, quiet location where there are few interruptions and distractions. 
•  Ensure that your device has reliable connectivity and coverage. 
•  Do not share the hearing invite, link, or password with anyone.  Contact the court if you believe your client 

or someone else needs a calendar invitation for the remote hearing. 
If joining by smartphone, download and sign up for the Cisco Webex Meetings app. 

• 
•  Test audio and video prior to the scheduled remote hearing time at  

https://www.webex.com/test-meeting.html. 

•  Use headphones equipped with a microphone, if possible. Your voice will be clearer when you talk, and 

participants in the case will be able to better hear you. 

•  Connect to the remote hearing through the calendar invitation 5 to 10 minutes early to test the connection 

and resolve any technical issues. 

•  Confirm that your device microphone and webcam are on and the speakers are turned up. 
•  Confirm that audio and video are enabled so everyone in the hearing can see and hear you. This can be 

•  After confirming audio and video functionality on your device, mute your audio until you are asked to 

managed through Webex controls. 

speak by the court. 

Frequently verify that your microphone is muted during the remote hearing. 

•  Mute any other devices that you have in the room with you so as not to cause a feedback loop. 
• 
•  Stay on mute until you are called on and remember to mute once you are done speaking. 
•  Speak one at a time and pause 1 to 2 seconds prior to speaking in case there is an audio or video lag. 
•  Announce your appearance each time you speak during the remote hearing. 
•  Do not speak at the same time as someone else. 
• 
•  Do not record the hearing without express written permission from the court. 
•  Do not broadcast or live stream the hearing. 
•  Do not use a speakerphone. 
• 

If you are connecting to audio by phone, do not place the call on hold at any time. 

Inform the court if you are experiencing technical difficulties. 

General recommendations when joining a 
remote hearing by video: 
o  Dress appropriately as if you were in a 

courtroom. 

o  Be mindful of what is behind you. 
o  When speaking, look directly at the camera, 

not at the screen. 

Additional recommendations when joining 
from a mobile device: 
o  Plan to be in a stationary location while 
appearing via video; moving around is 
distracting to the other participants. 
o  Keep the camera pointed to your face. 

If the sound quality is difficult to hear, mute your computer microphone and speakers and call the associated 
conference call number. (You will be able to participate through the telephone connection and observe the video.) 

l
P
ease remember this is a court proceeding and participants must behave accordingly.  Remove personal photos, 
stinguishable information, and any other personal items that you do not want the public to see in your background.

Witnesses 

We recommend that each witness be alone in the physical room from which the witness will be testifying. It is 
expected that all electronic devices, other than the one used to access the remote hearing, are turned off during 
the testimony. No other programs or windows should be open on the witness's device or computer. Remote 
hearing participants must not pass the functional equivalent of notes by electronic means to the witness during the 
time that witness is testifying. 

• 

Check with the court regarding the procedure on witnesses and, if ordered, exchange witness lists prior to a remote 
hearing. 
Provide contact information for witnesses to the clerk. 
Indicate, as soon as possible, any motion to exclude witnesses. 

• 
• 
•  Witnesses should be available by phone to receive information on when to join the remote hearing or for the clerk to 

conference them into the hearing at the appropriate time. 
Prepare witnesses on what to expect during the remote hearing. 

• 

Interpreters 

To help the interpreter, speak slowly and in short sentences. 

• 
•  When speaking, pause after every 1-2 sentences to allow the interpreter to translate. 
•  Wait for the interpreter to finish their interpretation before talking or answering a question. 

Exhibits for Remote Hearings 

Exhibits may be submitted to the court as outlined in Chief Justice Order 21-025, issued June 30, 2021, and the 
memorandum regarding File & Serve updates. 

Exhibits should be submitted before the hearing and served according to ORCP 9. Any exhibit that can be 
converted to a PDF document may now be submitted through File & Serve when the hearing is to be conducted 
remotely.  

For any digital media exhibits that are not able to be converted to a PDF, such as audio or video files, the attorney 
should contact the court to determine the best method of delivering those files. 

File Request 

If the court chooses to use a file request system, 
after contacting the court, you will receive an email 
to submit files. Follow the email instructions. 

1.  Select Send Requested Files. 
2.  Drag and drop any files in the Drop Files 

Here section or select Add Files to browse for 
the desired files. 

3.  Select Send once all files have been added. 
4.  Confirm that the court has received all exhibits 
prior to the start of the remote hearing. 

Private Attorney/Client Communication 

Remote hearings conducted via Webex Meetings may facilitate confidential communication using breakout sessions 
within the Meeting. Webex Events does not provide a technical solution to facilitate confidential attorney/client 
communication. Attorneys and their clients should have a pre-established method for communicating confidentially 
that does not rely on OJD technology and can happen separately from the hearing. 

Some options and considerations include: 

• 

• 
• 

The attorney and client may leave the remote hearing and use their own communication method and then rejoin the 
event once complete. 
Request the remote hearing be rescheduled to a new event for a later time after the privileged conversation is over. 
If the attorney and client are in the same room, mute the microphone and communicate out of the view of the 
displayed video. 

Revised 9/2021 

 

ETSD 

•  When an interpreter is needed for attorney/client communication and is provided by OJD, the interpreter should be 
included as part of the communication method as appropriate. It is appropriate for the attorney to confirm with the 
court that the interpreter is not being recorded. 

Accessing a Live Streamed Hearing 

You can find remote hearings available for public access, with some exceptions, being live streamed through the 
Oregon Judicial Department (OJD) website at:  https://www.courts.oregon.gov/services/online/Pages/live-
stream.aspx. 

•  Select the county to view and join any live streamed proceedings that are scheduled. 
• 
•  Some hearings can only be viewed within the courthouse, including, but not limited to: 

Find the court session you want to attend and click the link or dial-in on your phone to the number listed. 

o  Abuse Orders 
o  Adoption 
o  Civil Commitment 
o  Confidential and Sealed Cases 
o  Contempt of Court resulting from a Violation of a Restraining Order 
o  Custody 
o  Dissolution 
o 
Juvenile 
o 
Paternity 
o 
Protective Proceedings 
o  Quarantine/Isolation Orders 
o  Restraining Orders 
o 
Sex crimes, when a victim has requested the proceeding not be recorded 
o 
Specialty Court Hearings 
o

o 
Support 
o  Trade Secrets 
o  Visitation

Webex Events and Meetings 

Webex Events and Meetings is a service offered by Cisco Webex that allows for large scale teleconferencing and 
live streaming and is OJD’s preferred technology for both video and audio remote hearings. 

Remote hearings are any hearings where parties to a case appear from a remote location not in the courthouse.  
Additionally, remote hearings conducted via Webex Events may be live streamed, or broadcast in real-time over the 
internet. If the court has made public access available, the public will access the Webex Events live stream as an 
attendee to the event. 

Webex Events or Meetings may be used in either of the following two scenarios: 

•  Partially Remote – A clerk, judge or other staff is in the courtroom to facilitate the hearing, but all other parties may 
or may not be present.  The public can watch and listen to the proceedings either in the courtroom facilitated by 
technology or, if allowed by the court, by live stream. 
Fully Remote – No staff or judge is present in the courtroom, all parties are appearing from remote locations, and, if 
allowed by the court, the hearing is live streamed to the public. 

• 

Webex Events uses the following terminology: 

•  Host – The host is an OJD court staff or judge. Hosts are the only remote hearing participants that may start the 
event, allow people to share content, present their screen, mute or unmute participants, remove people from the 
event, disable chat, start and stop the recording through Webex Events, and end the event. 

•  Panelist – Panelists will primarily consist of counsel, parties, witnesses and other participants in the case.  A panelist 

has control over their own audio and video. 

•  Presenter –A presenter must first be a panelist. The presenter may share content or their screen with the rest of the 

event.  A panelist is only to be given the role of presenter if authorized by the judge. 

•  Attendee – An attendee is a person able to listen and view the remote hearing but cannot unmute themselves or be 
shown on video. Attendees may be unmuted or promoted to a panelist as needed and depending on court procedure.  
Members of the public will join as attendees. 

Prior to scheduling the hearing, the court will contact the parties to advise that the hearing will be held remotely, 
and whether it will be held by video and/or audio.  The attorney should be prepared to inform the court whether 
they or their client object to proceeding remotely and whether any accommodations are required. 

ebex Events and Meetings can be joined in the following ways: 

Free Cisco Webex Meetings app for Android or iOS mobile devices (audio and video). 

• 
•  Web browser on PC or laptop and phone (audio and video dependent on microphone and webcam). 
• 

Informing the court of audio only capability and complying with the court’s preferred access arrangements for remote 
hearing participants connecting by telephone (audio only). 
5 to 10 minutes before the scheduled hearing time, select the link or the Join icon in the invitation email, or call the 
number provided to join via phone. 

• 

REMEMBER:  Do not share the hearing invite, link, phone number, or password with anyone.  Contact the court if you 
believe your client or someone else needs a calendar invitation for the remote hearing.

Provide the court with the phone number where you will be available during the scheduled hearing time. 

• 
• 
•  Offer your direct line; do not use a phone number that requires dialing an extension. 
•  Make sure you are available by phone at least 15 minutes prior to the scheduled hearing time. 
• 

The court will call individuals participating by audio only prior to the scheduled hearing time and conference each one 
into the remote hearing. NOTE:  Specific procedures may vary with each local court or hearing.

Sharing Content 

Sharing of content can be performed by those with the host or 
presenter roles. Remote hearing participants may be promoted to 
the role of presenter if authorized by the judge. 

Exhibits (and other documents) may need to be shared during the 
remote hearing.  To share content during a remote hearing so 
others can view it, select Share content from the event control 
panel. 

A window will appear with a list of open programs and content 
the presenter can share.  Select the content for the sharing to 
start. 

When sharing content, the Webex toolbar will dock at the top of 
the screen. There are several options available while sharing. To 
mark up your content use the Annotate tool. To stop sharing 
content select the Stop Sharing button.

Sharing Video in Webex  
Sharing video is slightly different from sharing any other type of content. Before sharing a video in a remote hearing, review the 
following recommendations to make sure the video will be able to be viewed successfully. 

It is recommended that: 
 

The video is in an MP4 video format  
You have a minimum internet speed of 10Mbps download and 3Mbps upload  
You join on a computer, preferably a computer made within the last 2-3 years 
You contact the court to set up a test session for video sharing before the remote hearing 

• 
• 
• 
• 
•  A video at 720p definition should be a file size of roughly 5MB per minute of video, this means that an hour-long video 

should be around 300MB (sizes may vary up to 18% either smaller or larger) 

Webex Meetings has a sharing mode that is optimized for video. 
To determine if the remote hearing will be held in Webex 
meetings, contact the court.  

1.  Select Share from the bottom menu bar. 

a.  From the drop-down, select Optimize for 

motion and video  

b.  Verify Share your computer audio is checked 
c.  Select the content you would like to share

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
