      <pre>LOCAL RULE 8.075
BENTON COUNTY STANDARD PARENTING PLAN
(Effective March 15, 2000)

Parents are in the best position to develop a plan that fits their child’s needs and are strongly encouraged
to agree on a parenting plan and conditions of parenting time for their child (unless otherwise stated,
“child” means all minor children of the parents).  If the parents are unable to agree on a parenting plan
for their child, the Court will order a plan guided by the principles discussed below.

When the marital relationship deteriorates, parents sometimes overlook the fact that the child loves each
parent.  It is very stressful for the child when the parents disagree, particularly about parenting time and
other parenting issues.  The child wants the parents to agree on parenting time and wants the parents to
be mutually supporting parents.

The child needs to have regular ongoing contact with both parents and be able to express love for both
parents.  Each parent needs to create an atmosphere that allows the child to freely express their love for
the other parent without making the child feel guilty or that they are somehow hurting one parent by
loving the other.  Parents often subconsciously or otherwise convey to the child their dislike of the other
parent.  This causes conflict for the child and is detrimental to the child’s relationship with both parents.

Parenting plans need to recognize that children have different needs depending on their age.  The
guidelines set forth herein for children aged birth to 36 months are based on recommendations of child
development professionals.  It is important for parents to occasionally adjust their parenting plans to meet
developmental needs of children as they age and mature.  Teenagers, for instance, have typically
developed their own social life and often don’t want to be “forced” to spend time with either parent.  A
parenting plan needs to acknowledge these differences and establish transitions through the child’s
developmental milestones.  An age appropriate plan will be different with each child and each set of
parents.

In the end, the only principle that should control the development of a parenting plan is what is in the
child’s best interest.  Both parents must set aside their individual conflicts and focus on the child’s need
to develop and maintain the best possible relationship with both parents.  These principles will ultimately
guide the court in setting a parenting plan if the parents are unable to agree.

It is the philosophy of this Court that parents should use mediation to create their own parenting plans.
This is why the Court requires parents to attend mediation when they are not able to reach an agreement
on their own.  The Court expects parties to participate in mediation in good faith.

The following Benton County Standard Parenting Plan is intended to provide a parenting plan to parties
who have not been able to agree on their own plan, either on their own or after mediation.  If the parents
are unable to communicate and work together to reach a parenting plan, they will likely have many
ongoing disputes about parenting time.  Therefore, if the Court is required to impose orders, the parties
must strictly comply with these orders.  This is the only option when parents cannot agree on these
issues.

1 - BENTON COUNTY STANDARD PARENTING PLAN (SLR 8.075)

March 2000

The Benton County Standard Parenting Plan is not intended to create an absolute minimum or maximum
amount of time a parent may spend with the child.  So many issues can arise in parenting time that it is
very difficult, if not impossible, for the court to set a schedule that will cover every possible situation that
might occur.  This Plan is designed with the average parents in mind; neither the most involved parents
nor the least involved parents.  This Plan does not presume that one parent is superior or inferior to the
other.  The Court recognizes there are diverse ethnic, cultural and religious beliefs and expects the parties
to modify the holiday schedule set forth in this Plan to reflect and be respectful of each parent’s ethnic,
cultural or religious beliefs.  Because each family's circumstances are different, the court may make
provisions for more or less parenting time than provided for in this Standard Parenting Plan.

I.  GENERAL INFORMATION

The parents’ names are ____________________________ and _______________________________.

This Parenting Plan applies to the following child(ren):

Name(s)
______________________________________
______________________________________

II.  RESIDENTIAL SCHEDULE

Date(s) of Birth
_______________________
_______________________

_______________________

For the purposes of the Standard Parenting Plan, “residential parent” means the parent who provides the
primary residence for the child.  The “nonresidential parent” means the parent who has parenting time
with the child according to the schedule provided in the Standard Parenting Plan.

[  ] Mother [  ] Father shall be considered the “residential parent.” (Check one.)

Unless there are significant indications of endangerment to the child that would require limiting 
parenting time or supervision of parenting time, and when parents live no more than approximately 120
miles apart, the nonresidential parent shall have the child as set forth below.  When parents live more
than approximately 120 miles apart, refer to the Medium and Long Distance Parenting section beginning
on page 11..

Children aged birth to 6 months.  Three times per week for two hours each on consistent days and
times selected by the residential parent and at times when the nonresidential parent is available to visit
the child.

Children aged 6 months to 24 months.  Two times per week for three hours on consistent weekdays
selected by the residential parent when the nonresidential parent is available to visit the child and one day

2 - BENTON COUNTY STANDARD PARENTING PLAN (SLR 8.075)

March 2000

per weekend from 9 a.m. until 3 p.m.  This weekend day may be an overnight for children 18 months and
older, if the nonresidential parent has been actively involved in raising the child prior to the parties’
separation.

Children aged 24 months to 36 months.  Two times per week for three hours on consistent weekdays
selected by the residential parent when the nonresidential parent is available to visit the child and on
alternate weekends from 7 p.m. Saturday until 7 p.m. Sunday.

Children over age 36 months.  Alternating weekends commencing at 7 p.m. on Friday and ending the
following Monday morning.  Unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the nonresidential
parent shall feed the child on Monday morning and drop the child off at the child’s home or daycare no
later than 9 a.m., or at school before the child’s first class if the child is in school.  If the Monday of the
nonresidential parent’s weekend is a non-school day or national holiday which is not listed below, then
the weekend shall end on Monday at 7 p.m.

In addition to alternating weekends, the nonresidential parent shall have the child on the Monday
preceding the nonresidential parent's alternate weekend from 5 p.m. until 8 p.m. if the child is in school,
and from 9 a.m. until 7 p.m. if the child is not in school and if the nonresidential parent and/or his or her
immediate family will be with the child during that period of time.

III.  HOLIDAY AND VACATION PLANNING

Whether or not the child is enrolled in school, the child shall spend time with his/her parents on holidays

March 2000

Children over age 36 months.  Whether or not the child is in school, during the period of school winter

child for three (3) one-week blocks, scheduled to include the nonresidential parent's “alternate
weekends.” One week shall be in June, one week in July, and one week in August.  There shall be at least
two weeks between each of the one-week blocks.  Prior to April 1, the nonresidential parent shall select
and notify in writing the residential parent of the dates of the summer parenting time periods.  If the
nonresidential parent fails to provide such written notice prior to April 1, the residential parent shall be
entitled to designate those periods by notifying the nonresidential parent in writing by April 20.

beginning of the school year.  The nonresidential parent shall have the child during the first two-week

5 - BENTON COUNTY STANDARD PARENTING PLAN (SLR 8.075)

March 2000

block beginning at 7 p.m. on the Friday of the last week of school in even-numbered years and during the
second two-week block beginning at 7 p.m. on the third Friday after the end of school in odd-numbered
years.  Unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, all exchanges shall occur at 7 p.m. on
Fridays.  It is contemplated that the summer school vacation will not be an equal number of weeks each
year which will cause one parent to have less time with the child than the other.  This discrepancy will
reverse the following year and thereby equalize over time.  “Alternate weekends” and “alternate
Mondays” are discontinued during the school summer vacation and resume the first weekend following
the beginning of the school year.

IV.  DECISION-MAKING

A.  Day-to-Day Decisions

B.  Major Decisions

Each parent shall make decisions regarding the day-to-day care and control of the child while the parent
is caring for the child.  Both parents are authorized to make emergency decisions affecting the health or
safety of the child.

Decisions regarding the child's education, non-emergency health-care and religious training are
considered major decisions.  Sole decision-making authority means that one parent is responsible for
making these decisions.  Unless the parties have agreed in writing to joint legal custody, the residential
parent shall have sole decision-making authority in major decisions concerning the child.

V.  INFORMATION SHARING

Unless otherwise ordered by the court, each parent shall have equal access to important information
regarding the child; including, but not limited to, the child's current address and telephone number,
education, medical, governmental agency, psychological, and law enforcement records.  Each parent
must immediately notify the other regarding any emergency circumstances or substantial changes in the
health of the child.

VI.  RELOCATION OF A PARENT

Parents shall provide each other with written notice of any planned relocation which will result in a move
more than 60 miles further distant from the other parent at least 45 days prior to the relocation or as soon
as the moving parent learns of the relocation, whichever is sooner.

Any relocation of one parent that would disrupt the other parent's scheduled time with the child
shall require a modification of the residential schedule that is mutually agreed upon or is ordered
by the Court prior to the relocation.

Each parent shall notify the other parent of his or her contact phone number and address and shall notify
the other parent of any change in that information within 72 hours of such a change.  Further, if either

6 - BENTON COUNTY STANDARD PARENTING PLAN (SLR 8.075)

March 2000

parent takes the child from that parent's usual residence, he or she shall notify the other parent of any
emergency contact phone number and where the child will be staying.

VII.  COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE CHILD

The nonresidential parent and the child shall have the unlimited right to correspond with each other by
regular or e-mail and to telephone each other during reasonable hours without interference or monitoring
by the residential parent or anyone else in any way.  However, unless otherwise agreed in writing,
telephone calls between the nonresidential parent and the child shall be limited to no more than three per
week and each call shall be limited to 10 minutes or less in duration.  The residential parent shall have
the same communication rights when the child is with the nonresidential parent.

VIII.  OTHER PROVISIONS

A.  The Child Needs to Have Regular Ongoing Contact With Both Parents

Often the residential parent disagrees with the nonresidential parent’s lifestyle, and/or parenting ability,
and only wants the nonresidential parent to have a limited role in the child’s life.  This attitude, however,
often ignores the fact that the child loves the other parent. A child needs to spend time with both parents.

On the other hand, an even greater problem can occur when the nonresidential parent does not maintain
regular, ongoing contact with the child.  This is very damaging to the child.  When the court orders a
Parenting Plan, that order requires parenting time to take place.  The court expects the nonresidential
parent to exercise all the parenting time provided for by the court.

B.  Parents Must Communicate About the Child

When parents become divorced they, in effect, have to develop a new relationship so they can become
mutually supporting parents.  This does not require that they be friends or that they communicate about
anything other than the child.  It does, however, require that they work out some way to communicate
about things effecting the child.  The communication needs to be as respectful and unemotional as
possible.  Parents are encouraged to use e-mail whenever possible.  Under no circumstances should these
communications, whether written or otherwise, be shared with the child.

If the parents are not otherwise communicating about the child, the residential parent must send the
nonresidential parent a respectful and objective letter or e-mail at least once every 60 days discussing the
following: the child’s school, health, activities and any concerns the parent has about things that are
happening during parenting time.  The nonresidential parent must respond to that letter or e-mail by
writing a respectful and objective letter or e-mail to the residential parent within 30 days describing the
child’s activities during parenting time, responding to the nonresidential parent’s parenting time concerns
and expressing any concerns about the child that the nonresidential parent may have.

C.  The Child Should be Left Out of the Parents’ Disputes

7 - BENTON COUNTY STANDARD PARENTING PLAN (SLR 8.075)

March 2000

The child loves both parents and does not want to be disloyal to either parent.  When one parent talks
negatively about the other parent, or about the other parent’s spouse or family, this is emotionally
damaging to the child.  When one parent tries to use the child as a source of information about the other
parent, this is emotionally damaging to the child.  Similarly, the child should not be used as a “go-
between”, to relay messages, or otherwise used as a means of communication between the parents.

D.  Affection and Respect

Each parent is forbidden, under any circumstances, from making or willfully allowing others to make
derogatory comments in the presence of the child about the other parent, or his/her spouse or family, or in
any way diminishing the love, respect and affection the child has for the other parent.

E.  Meals and Clothes
The residential parent shall have the child fed and ready on time with sufficient clothing packed and
ready for the nonresidential parent's parenting time.  The nonresidential parent shall return all the
clothing which accompanied the child and shall have the child fed before the child returns to the
residential parent.

F.  Exchange and Transportation of Child From One Parent to the Other

When parents live no more than 60 miles apart, the nonresidential parent shall pick up the child from the
residential parent's residence no earlier than or later than 15 minutes from the scheduled beginning of the
parenting time.  The residential parent shall pick up the child from the nonresidential parent's residence
no earlier than or later than 15 minutes from the ending of the nonresidential parent’s parenting time.

Unless otherwise agreed between the parents in writing or ordered by the Court, parents who live more
than 60 miles apart shall equally participate in the cost and effort of exchanging the child from one parent
to the other.

G.  Parent Control of Child’s Activities During Parenting Time

The residential parent makes the decisions about what the child does while the child is with the
residential parent.  The nonresidential parent makes the decisions about what the child does while the
child is with the nonresidential parent.  Therefore, neither parent should schedule activities for the child
that occur during the other parent’s time with the child without first consulting and getting the other
parent’s written consent.

Oftentimes one parent objects to things that the child does while with the other parent.  Fortunately, or
unfortunately as the case may be, the other parent has the right to make those decisions while the child is
with the other parent; provided, of course, that the activity does not endanger the health or safety of the
child.  Ideally, however, parents will talk about their concerns on these issues and resolve them. The key
is to try to do the following: understand the other parent’s concerns; respect the other parent; and not do
anything to undermine the authority and respect (in the child’s eyes) of the other parent.

8 - BENTON COUNTY STANDARD PARENTING PLAN (SLR 8.075)

March 2000

Unless otherwise ordered by the court, both parents are encouraged to participate in the child's school
activities including visiting the classroom, attending parent-teacher conferences, and sports activities.

H.  School Involvement

I.  Non-Assigned Time

Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the residential parent is responsible for the child during all times not
specifically designated as the nonresidential parent’s parenting time.

J.  Makeup of Missed Parenting Time

Personal plans of either parent or of the child, school activities, church activities and other considerations
will not be reasons for failing to follow the parenting time schedule.  The child will not be permitted to
determine whether or not he/she wishes to be with a parent.  Only substantial medical reasons will be
considered sufficient for postponement of parenting time.  If a child is ill and unable to visit, a makeup
parenting time shall occur on the following weekend or Monday.  If, however, the nonresidential parent
fails to exercise his/her parenting time, there will be no makeup parenting time.

Specific holidays or vacations shall supercede any weekend or alternating Monday parenting time
the other parent might otherwise have and there will not be a makeup nor will the weekend
schedule be changed.  In other words, there are some weekends or alternating Mondays in a year
that might be lost due to conflicting vacations or holidays.

K.  No Shows for Scheduled Parenting Time

When there is a history of the nonresidential parent not showing up for a scheduled weekend or
alternating Monday parenting time (e.g. one no show per month for 3 months), the residential parent may
take the following action: write the nonresidential parent indicating that, unless the nonresidential parent
gives at least 5 days advance notice that he/she will be unable to exercise the scheduled parenting time,
the residential parent will cancel the next regularly scheduled parenting time.

Canceling the next regularly scheduled parenting time should not be done lightly and should not be done
by the residential parent when, for example, there is no regular history of missed parenting times, or
when the missed parenting time was due to an emergency situation such as health or emergency weather
conditions.

L.  Smoking or Drinking Alcohol in the Presence of the Child

An issue frequently occurs when one parent smokes or drinks alcohol in front of the child and the other
parent objects.  Neither parent should smoke in the presence of the child (or smoke in any manner so the
child is breathing the smoke) and neither parent should drink alcohol to the point where they are affected
by the alcohol to a noticeable or perceptible degree.

9 - BENTON COUNTY STANDARD PARENTING PLAN (SLR 8.075)

March 2000

M.  Failure to Comply

Parenting time is not dependent on payment of child support, or on whether or not the other parent does
or does not do other things not directly related to parenting time.  If a parent fails to comply with a
provision of this Parenting Plan, the other parent's obligations under the Plan are not affected.  If a parent
refuses to follow or violates the court’s Parenting Plan order, that party can be held in contempt of court. 
The punishment for contempt of court can include up to 6 months incarceration in the local corrections
facility, a fine, and/or other sanctions.

N.  Modification of Parenting Plan

No modification or agreement that changes these specific parenting time conditions will be allowed or
recognized, unless it is in the form of a court order, or unless the parents agree in writing to temporary
changes; or unless the need for change is relatively minor and arises at a time or under circumstances
when it is not feasible to enter into a written agreement (e.g. one parent wants to start a particular week
of parenting time earlier than the parties agreed).

The child must continue to use the child’s last name as stated in the Judgment of Dissolution.  Neither the
parent nor the child has the right to change the child’s last name without either mutual written agreement
of the parents or a court order.

O.  Child’s Last Name

IX.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION

The parents will attempt to cooperatively resolve any disputes that arise over the terms of the Parenting
Plan.  If the parents are unable to resolve a dispute, they are required to use mediation as a first recourse. 
If the parents need assistance in selecting a mediator, they may contact the domestic relations clerk at
(541) 766-6705 for a list of local mediators.  Any cost for mediation shall be shared equally by the
parents or as determined in the dispute resolution process.  A written record shall be prepared of any
agreement reached in mediation and shall be provided to each parent.  If the parents are unable to resolve
a dispute through any other dispute resolution process, the dispute shall be resolved through court action. 
Going to court for a decision should be the absolute, last alternative.

X.  MEDIUM AND LONG DISTANCE PARENTING

When parents choose to live a long distance from each other, it poses many difficulties for the parents,
but more particularly, the child.  It is not possible to create a long distance parenting time schedule that
allows a child to spend a significant amount of time with the nonresidential parent.  This is especially true
for younger children.  The Court recognizes that the following schedule is limited and encourages the
parents to increase the frequency of visits whenever economically feasible.  It is imperative that the

10 - BENTON COUNTY STANDARD PARENTING PLAN (SLR 8.075)

March 2000

nonresidential parent maintain regular and meaningful contact with the child between visits and that the
residential parent fully cooperate to achieve this goal.  The Court strongly recommends the use of e-mail,
in addition to regular telephone calls and letters.

Unless the parents agree otherwise in writing, when parents live more than approximately 120 miles
apart, but less than approximately 250 miles apart, the nonresidential parent shall have the child
according to the schedule labeled "Medium Distance"; when parents live more than approximately 250
miles apart, the nonresidential parent shall have the child according to the schedule labeled "Long
Distance."

Unless otherwise agreed between the parents in writing or ordered by the Court, parents who live more
than 60 miles apart shall equally participate in the cost and effort of exchanging the child from one parent
to the other.

A.  RESIDENTIAL SCHEDULE

Unless there are significant indications of endangerment to the child that would require limiting 
parenting time or supervision of parenting time, the nonresidential parent shall have the child as follows:

Children aged birth to 6 months.
Medium and Long Distance:  Three times per week for two hours each on consistent days and times in
the locale where the residential parent resides.

Children aged 6 months to 24 months.
Medium and Long Distance:  Two times per week for three hours on consistent weekdays and one day
per weekend from 9 a.m. until 3 p.m. in the locale where the residential parent resides.  This weekend
day may be an overnight for children 18 months and older, if the nonresidential parent has been actively
involved raising the child prior to the parties’ separation.

Children aged 24 months to 36 months.
Medium and Long Distance:  Two times per week for three hours on consistent weekdays and on
alternate weekends from 7 p.m. Saturday until 7 p.m. Sunday.

Children over age 36 months.
Medium Distance:  For each of the months of September, October, November, January, February,
March, April and May, one period of four consecutive days beginning Friday at 7 p.m. and ending
Monday at 7 p.m.  These parenting time periods shall be scheduled to include non-school days or
national holidays whenever possible.  Prior to August 1 each year, the nonresidential parent shall select
and notify the residential parent in writing of the dates of the parenting time periods to be scheduled
during the months of September through May (excluding December).  If the nonresidential parent fails to
provide such written notice prior to August 1, the residential parent shall be entitled to designate those
periods by notifying the nonresidential parent in writing by August 20.  If two periods of parenting time
occur in one month (for example, the November four-day parenting time and Thanksgiving or the March

11 - BENTON COUNTY STANDARD PARENTING PLAN (SLR 8.075)

March 2000

four-day parenting time and Spring Break), unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, there shall
be just one period -- the longest period -- of parenting time during that month.

Long Distance:  Between September 1 and December 1 of each year, one continuous seven-day period
beginning at 9 a.m. on the first day and ending at 7 p.m. on the seventh day.  Between February 1 and
June 1 of each year, one continuous seven-day period beginning at 9 a.m. on the first day and ending at 7
p.m. on the seventh day.  The seven-day periods may not be scheduled to immediately precede or
immediately follow any of the nonresidential parent’s holidays named below nor may they be scheduled
to interfere with any of the residential parent’s holidays named below.  Prior to August 1 each year, the
nonresidential parent shall select and notify the residential parent in writing of the dates of the parenting
time periods to be scheduled during the months of September through May (excluding December and
January).  If the nonresidential parent fails to provide such written notice prior to August 1, the
residential parent shall be entitled to designate those periods by notifying the nonresidential parent in
writing by August 20.

In addition, if the nonresidential parent will be visiting the locality where the child resides, the
nonresidential parent may have two days parenting time to be exercised in that locality, provided he/she
gives at least 20 days advance notice in writing, or may have one day parenting time to be exercised in
that locality if he/she gives less than 20 days advance notice in writing but at least 7 days advance notice
in writing.  These parenting times shall begin at 9 a.m. and end at 7 p.m. on the following day or the day
thereafter.

B.  HOLIDAY AND VACATION PLANNING

Whether or not the child is enrolled in school, the child shall spend time with his/her parents on holidays
according to the following plan:

NONRESIDENTIAL
PARENT
Even years
Even years
Odd years

RESIDENTIAL

For the purposes of this Parenting Plan, a holiday shall begin and end as follows:

a.m. until 7 p.m. in odd-numbered years and on December 24 from 9 a.m. until 7 p.m. in even-numbered
years in the locale where the residential parent resides.

Children aged 18 months to 36 months.
 Medium and Long Distance:  The nonresidential parent shall have the child from 7 p.m. on December 24
until 7 p.m. on December 25 in odd-numbered years and from 7 p.m. on December 25 until 7 p.m. on
December 26 in even-numbered years.

Children over age 36 months.
Medium and Long Distance:  Whether or not the child is in school, during the period of school vacation
in the district in which the child resides, parenting time for the nonresidential parent shall begin at 9 a.m.
the day after school adjourns through 7 p.m. on December 26 in odd-numbered years.  In even-numbered
years, parenting time for the nonresidential parent shall begin at 7 p.m. on December 26 and end at noon
the day before school reconvenes.

4.  SUMMER VACATION

Prior to April 1 each year, the nonresidential parent shall select and notify the residential parent in
writing of the dates of parenting time to be scheduled during the months of June through August.  If the
nonresidential parent fails to provide such written notice prior to April 1, the residential parent shall be
entitled to select those periods, so long as they include the nonresidential parent's holiday time, by
notifying the nonresidential parent in writing by April 20.

Children aged birth to under 24 months before June 1.
Medium and Long Distance:  The residential schedule remains the same as the rest of the year.

13 - BENTON COUNTY STANDARD PARENTING PLAN (SLR 8.075)

March 2000

Children aged 24 months to under 36 months before June 1.
Medium Distance:  The residential schedule remains the same as the rest of the year.

Long Distance:  The nonresidential parent shall have the child for three “long” weekends, one in June,
one in July, and one in August.  The long weekends shall begin at 7 p.m. on Friday and end at 7 p.m. on
Sunday.  The parenting time may occur where the nonresidential parent resides.  The nonresidential
parent shall also have the child for three “normal” weekends, one in June, one in July, and one in August,
beginning at 9 a.m. on Saturday and ending at 7 p.m. on Sunday in the locale where the residential parent
resides.

Children aged 36 months to under 6 years before June 1.
Medium Distance:  The nonresidential parent shall have the child for three (3) one-week blocks, one
week in June, one week in July, and one week in August.  Unless the parties agree otherwise in writing,
each one-week block shall begin at 7 p.m. on Friday and end at 7 p.m. on the following Friday.  There
shall be at least two weeks between each of the one-week blocks.

Long Distance:  The nonresidential parent shall have the child for three continuous weeks during the
summer beginning at 7 p.m. on the first day and ending at 7 p.m. on the twenty-second day.

Children who reach age 6 before June 1.
Medium Distance:  The parents shall share parenting time with the child on an alternating two-week
block basis during the school summer vacation which shall be deemed to begin at 7 p.m. on the Friday of
the last week of school and end at 7 p.m. on the Sunday immediately preceding the beginning of the
school year.  The nonresidential parent shall have the child commencing the first two-week block
beginning at 7 p.m. on the Friday of the last week of school in even-numbered years and commencing the
second two-week block beginning at 7 p.m. on the third Friday after the end of school in odd-numbered
years.  Unless the parties agree otherwise in writing, all exchanges shall occur at 7 p.m. on Fridays.  It is
contemplated that the summer school vacation will not be an equal number of weeks each year which
will cause one parent to have less time with the child than the other.  This discrepancy will reverse the
following year and thereby equalize over time.

Long Distance:  The nonresidential parent shall have the child for two (2) three-week blocks.  Unless the
parties agree otherwise in writing, each three-week block shall begin at 7 p.m. on the first day and end at
7 p.m. on the twenty-second day.  There shall be at least two weeks between the three-week blocks.  If
the child is at least 8 years old prior to June 1 and the nonresidential parent has maintained regular
meaningful contact with the child since the parties’ separation, the summer parenting time may be
exercised as one (1) six-week block.
