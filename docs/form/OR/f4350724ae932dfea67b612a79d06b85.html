Our System of Government 
Oregon’s state government is part of the system known as a “federal government” (also referred to as 
“federalism”). Federal governments divide power and jurisdiction between a strong national (central) 
government, state governments, and local county and city governments. The U.S. Constitution declares that 
the national government (known as the “federal” government) holds certain powers and that remaining powers 
are reserved for the states or the people (see chart below). 

UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SYSTEM

Governments 
• Establish/Maintain Schools 
• State Criminal Law 
• Divorce/Family Law 
• Welfare & Medicaid 
• Estate Law

n situations where 
jurisdiction is in 
question, the federal 
courts decide who has 
jurisdiction.

• Make & Veto Laws including laws 
for: Copyright/Patent; Immigration; 
Bankruptcy; Social Security; Civil 
Rights; Tax Fraud; Counterfeiting 
• Establish Postal Offices 
• Create Currency 
• Create Lower Courts 

 

.S. citizens are protected by U.S. constitutional rights and by the much broader protections, rights, and laws 

contained in their individual state constitution (although a state constitution cannot violate the U.S. 
Constitution). Non-citizens are also protected where the U.S. Constitution refers to “residents” or “persons.” 
Where the Bill of Rights (the first 10 amendments to the Constitution) references “the rights of the people” 
those rights are shared by non-citizens and immigrants as well as U.S. citizens.  

Oregon 
Oregon’s constitution divides the state’s governing powers between state, county, and city governments. Each 
oversees specific services fundamental to maintaining a safe and healthy society (see a sampling of state, 
county, and city services below):

State government structures are modeled after the federal government’s three branch system - executive, 
legislative, and judicial branches.  

Oregon’s Three Branches of State Government 
Executive Branch 
The state executive branch is headed by Oregon’s Governor, whose job is to “faithfully execute the law”; make 
recommendations to the Legislature; approve the state budget; and to ensure, through the state’s multiple 
agencies, that the necessary operations of government are accomplished. Four additional officials assist in the 
management of executive branch responsibilities: Secretary of State; State Treasurer; the Attorney General; 
and the Labor and Industries Commissioner. Some of their duties are listed below:

Legislative Branch 
Oregon’s Legislature is referred to as the “Legislative Assembly.” It consists of a 60-member House of 
Representatives (the lower house) and a 30-member Senate (the upper house). Oregon is divided into 30 
senatorial districts each represented by one of 30 elected state senators and 60 house representative districts, 
each represented by an elected house representative.

he Legislature is led by the the President of the Senate (one of Oregon’s senators) and the Speaker of the

and majority political parties in the Senate and House elect a leader from their ranks to help manage their 
party’s affairs.

Oregon’s legislature enacts new laws, revises existing laws, reviews administrative rules drafted by state 
agencies for adherence to law, confirms certain executive appointments made by the governor, and administers 
the state budget. Legislative decisions set policy that affects the health, education, general welfare of 
Oregonians, and helps maintain the economy and condition of the state’s environment.  

ew laws begin as an idea that becomes a bill submitted to the Legislative Assembly: 

7 

The committee 
writes a report to 
pass, pass with 
amendments, or 
not pass 

6 

The committee 
reviews the bill 
and holds public 
hearings and 
work sessions 

5 

The bill is referred to 
 
an appropriate 
committee and sent 
for review of its fiscal 
and revenue impacts 

4 

 

 

Legislative 
counsel drafts 
the bill in 
proper legal 
language  

3 

The bill is given 
a number and 
is printed for its 
1st reading in 
the House 

2  

1 

If the legislator 
decides to 
sponsor it, the 
bill goes to 
legislative 
counsel 

A citizen, group, 
or representative  
presents an idea 
for a bill to a 
legislator 

If bill passes it 
goes to the 
Senate 

9 

10 

The bill has its  
1st reading; the 
Senate President 
assigns it to a 
committee 

11
 

After the bill passes 
both houses it is 
signed by Speaker 
of the House, 
Senate President, 
Chief Clerk of 
House or Secretary 
of Senate 

 

15 

If House does 
not agree, a 
Conference 
Committee is 
appointed w/ 
legislators from 
House and 
Senate to work 
out agreement 

16 

 

When House 
and Senate 
agree, bill is 
sent to the 
Governor 

 

17 

18 

Governor 
reviews bill 
then signs, 
does not sign, 
or vetoes bill  

14 

If amendments 
are made, the bill 
goes back to the 
House to vote on 
changes to bill 

13 

•  If signed: bill becomes 

law on the Jan 1 
following legislative 
session 

•  If not signed: bill 
becomes law w/o 
Governor’s signature 

•  If vetoed: bill goes 
back to House and 
Senate. A 2/3 majority 
vote in both houses 
overrides veto 

 

Committee holds 
public hearings; 
and recommends 
a pass, pass w/ 
amendments, or 
do not pass  

12

 

The bill goes back to 
Senate for 2nd and 3rd 
readings; senate   
debates the bill; and 
votes to pass, pass w/ 
amendments, or not 
pass 

3

 

If amendments 
are made the 
bill is sent back 
to the House for 
2nd and 3rd 
readings 

8 

The House 
debates the bill 
and votes to 
pass or not 
pass

Decisions made in dividing the state’s bienniel budget between all three branches, including the agencies and 
programs within them, is a responsibility of the Legislature. Allocation of the budget must be made in a way that 
allows critical operations of agencies, programs, Oregon’s economy, the state’s environment, and government 
overall to function smoothly and provide services to the public.  

Oregon’s Judicial Branch is a state court system of 36 circuit (trial) courts, a Court of Appeals and Supreme 
Court (the appellate courts), a Tax Court, and the Office of the State Court Administrator (OSCA), all headed 
by the Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court. The Chief Justice and Supreme Court justices also play 
roles in Judicial Branch-affiliated legal groups (Oregon State Bar, Commission on Judicial Fitness and 
Disability, Office of Public Defense Services, and the Council on Court Procedures).

he Oregon Judicial Branch preserves the rule of law in Oregon by deciding all legal disputes not handled by 
the federal district courts. Judges in Oregon’s circuit courts, Court of Appeals, Supreme Court, and Tax Court 
interpret and apply state and federal constitutions, state laws, and state statutes passed by the Oregon 
legislature. Judges reach decisions on cases by deciding whether state laws and executive orders apply to a 
case or if those laws are constitutional (this is called judicial review). Judges hold hearings and trials within 
their respective counties throughout the state. The central role of the state courts is to ensure that all 
Oregonians receive fair and accessible justice by providing due process (respecting all legal rights that are 
owed to a person), protecting individual rights, and preserving community welfare.

County and City Governments 
Counties and cities within states administer vital public services to citizens within their jurisdictions. In Oregon, 
county and city voters also have the decision-making authority to decide what form of local government will 
respond best to the needs of their communities. Local governments can pass laws (ordinances); adopt 
resolutions; and decide public policy that effects the governance and welfare of their communities.   

Governing structures in Oregon’s counties and cities take a variety of forms usually depending on population 
size and are governed either by an elected mayor and city council, an elected commission, or a city council 
and manager or administrator.  

Citizen Participation  
Participation by citizens is recognized as the foundation of our democracy. Citizens, (along with the American 
free press and special interest groups) have the power to participate in the selection of federal, state, and local 
government officials through the constitutionally-protected right to vote, informed by freedom of the press and 
free speech. Citizens in America are free to: receive and distribute information used to make voting decisions; 
participate in the drafting of laws (called initiatives) to submit to their legislators; run for public office; and 
lawfully protest and demonstrate dissatisfaction with how government is performing its duties. These rights are 
citizen responsibilities that affect the maintenance, improvement, and future of our democracy.   

  Ways that Citizens Can Participate in Democracy 

–  Stay informed through information in newspapers, magazines, reference materials, on television (confirm accuracy of 

information) 

–  Vote in local, state, and national elections 

–  Participate in political discussion 

–  Volunteer in the community 

–  Sign petitions to support causes 

–  Display support for a cause with a car bumper sticker or lawn sign  

–  Create awareness of critical issues through letters to elected representatives or urge them to support certain bills or 

–  Attend meetings to gain information, discuss issues, or lend support 

amendments 

–  Contribute money to a party or candidate 

–  Campaign for a candidate 

–  Lobby for laws that are of special interest 

–  Demonstrate through peaceful marches, boycotts, sit-ins, or other forms of lawful protest 

–  Serve as a juror to support our court system and ensure fair and accessible justice for all  

–  Run as a candidate for office 

–  Serve the country through military service
