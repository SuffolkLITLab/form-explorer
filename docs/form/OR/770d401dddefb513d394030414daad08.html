THE SUPREME COURT 
 

o the Honorable Senators and Representatives of the 82nd Legislative Assembly: 

e are pleased to present the Chief Justice’s Recommended Budget for the Oregon Judicial Department (OJD) for the 2023-25 biennium. This 
budget request will allow the judicial branch to fulfill its core mission – a mission essential to our democracy – to serve the need for justice in our 
communities. 
   
We appreciate the resources that the legislature gave courts in the 2021-23 biennium to implement the OJD Strategic Campaign, and we have made 
effective use of them.  We successfully implemented major portions of the 19 priority initiatives in the Campaign, allowing us to improve services to 
people who are underserved, vulnerable, or marginalized; eliminate barriers and improve access to justice; enhance the public’s trust and confidence 
in the judicial branch; and create a workplace and courthouse culture that is supportive, inclusive, and welcoming.  The Current Service Level and 
Policy Option Packages in this budget request would allow the Judicial Department to continue its success and its advance the priorities we share 
with the legislative and executive branches.   

or example, we know that one of Oregon’s most pressing issues is housing and providing services for those who are houseless.  Courts have been 

instrumental in informing landlords and tenants about the availability of rent assistance and in giving them time to work through alternatives to 
eviction.  We now are seeing eviction filings rise, and your courts can continue to be of assistance.  Your judges have been leaders in addressing the 
severe shortage of public defense attorneys and in finding appropriate placements for people with mental illness, substance abuse disorder, and other 
behavioral health issues.  Much work remains to be done in those areas, and we know that the work of our branch is integrally connected to the work 
of the other branches and that a fully functioning court system is necessary to progress on our shared priorities.   

e stand ready to work with you. 

hanks to the tremendous dedication of judges and court staff throughout the state, your courts not only stayed open throughout the COVID-19 
pandemic, but quickly determined how to conduct court proceedings by remote means, obtained necessary equipment, and provided necessary 
training to courts, attorneys, and litigants on how best to use those new tools.  Court users have benefitted substantially from that access, and, 
statewide, courts have reduced the number of pending cases to below pre-pandemic levels.

The Policy Option Packages requested in our budget would allow our courts to:  

•  Continue implementing a statewide pretrial release system that is not dependent on cash “bail,” and allows release from custody based on risk 

to the public, permitting retention when necessary to protect public safety;  

•  Continue implementing a program providing oversight in protective proceedings – guardianships and conservatorships;  

•  Continue to improve services to self-represented litigants, including in expungement, landlord-tenant, and family law proceedings, expanding 

efforts to help navigate court proceedings and translate documents and web pages for litigants whose primary language is not English;  

•  Ensure that courts have adequate and secure technology to support our remote proceedings, and better connect courts with rural communities 

and vulnerable populations;  

•  Provide competitive compensation for judges, and add judicial positions in six counties to improve timely resolution of cases; 

•  Begin to address economic barriers that limit many Oregonians’ ability to serve on juries; 

•  Continue investments in family treatment courts and stabilize funding for drug courts, mental health courts, veterans courts, and other specialty 

courts instead of relying on grants. 

•  Fund entrance security screening in 21 court facilities to reduce the risk of harm to court users;   

•  Replace unsafe courthouses in Benton, Clackamas, Curry, and Morrow counties and provide funds for other needed courthouse improvements; 

hese targeted investments will improve your courts’ ability to fulfill the Oregon Constitution’s requirement that justice be administered “completely 
and without delay.”  The resources requested in this budget also will allow courts to continue to be strong partners in addressing issues of concern to 
our state as a whole, including preventing trauma to children and families and reducing costs and improving results in the criminal justice system. 
Current Service Level funding will allow your courts to continue to serve Oregonians (including by fully implementing the benefits of our now-
completed Oregon eCourt system), and to reduce incarceration (including by providing staffing for our problem-solving courts).  

e are committed to doing our part to meet our joint responsibilities to all Oregonians, and we look forward to working with you to that end.  

espectfully submitted,

Department Summary 

Judicial Branch Mission Statement 

As a separate and independent branch of government, we provide fair and accessible justice services that 
protect the rights of individuals, preserve community welfare, and inspire public confidence. 

ission and Vision  

  
The judicial branch is a separate and coequal branch of state government. The core function of the judicial branch is providing a forum for justice 
when disputes in the community arise. The Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court is the administrative head of the unified court system and the 
state judicial branch and submits the Oregon Judicial Department budget request to the Legislature. The Chief Justice’s Recommended Budget 
requests resources to address the current operational needs of the state court system and the funding priorities established by the Chief Justice for the 
Oregon Judicial Department for each biennium.  
  
Each branch of government has a vital role to play in a democratic society. The judicial branch plays a unique and pivotal role in the political, 
cultural, social, and economic life of this state, and Oregonians can be proud of their state courts, which every day strive to meet the state’s 
constitutional obligations to provide impartial justice completely and without delay, while being open and accessible to all Oregonians.  
  
Whether it is protecting individual rights, shepherding a treatment court participants from a life of chaos to that of a stable, secure member of the 
community, sentencing a person convicted of a crime, helping victims of domestic violence or abuse, resolving child custody or other family 
disputes, enforcing the rules of the marketplace among businesses and consumers, or ensuring that government acts within its legal authority, 
Oregon’s elected judges in the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Tax Court, and in the circuit courts across the state – and the professional court 
staff that assist them – work hard every day to provide justice efficiently, fairly, and promptly.  
  
A mission statement for the branch was first created as part of a visioning project begun in 1992 by then-Chief Justice Wallace P. Carson, Jr., with 
the purpose of creating a long-range blueprint based on core institutional values that identified goals and strategic initiatives for the Oregon Judicial 
Department. The vision project, then known as “Justice 2020: The New Oregon Trail,” and its successor documents have influenced and guided 
planning, budgeting, and direction for the court system ever since. While the opportunities, challenges, and priorities have changed over the years, 
the underlying guiding values and vision goals have remained constant and have continued to shape our present and future budgets.  
  
The underlying guiding values and vision goals for the Oregon judicial branch are as follows:

The Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court is the administrative head of the Oregon judicial branch and of the unified state court system. On 
July 2, 2018, the Honorable Martha L. Walters was sworn in as the 44th Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court, and Justice Meagan A. Flynn has 
been elected by the Supreme Court to become the 45th Chief Justice, effective January 1, 2023. The Chief Justice supervises the state court system, 
makes rules and issues orders to carry out the duties of the office, and appoints the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals and the presiding judges of 
the circuit courts. The Chief Justice approves and submits the statewide fiscal plan and budget for all state courts.  
  
The Oregon Constitution and Oregon statutes define the state court system’s organizational structure and its obligations. In statute, the unified “state 
court system” entity is called “the Oregon Judicial Department” (OJD). It includes the Oregon Supreme Court; the Court of Appeals; the Tax Court; 
and 36 circuit courts statewide, organized into 27 judicial districts. It also includes the Office of the State Court Administrator. The State Court 
Administrator (SCA), appointed by the Chief Justice, is the state court system’s chief operating officer. This position, established by statute, supports 
and assists the Chief Justice in exercising administrative authority and supervision over the trial and appellate courts of this state, and provides the 
day-to-day central infrastructure services to the state court system and manages its mandatory state programs.  
  
By statute, the Chief Justice may delegate additional administrative responsibilities, respectively, to the presiding judges of the Court of Appeals, Tax 
Court, and judicial districts, the latter group whom by statute oversee the operations of the local circuit courts statewide. The Chief Justice appoints a 
presiding judge for each judicial district, the Tax Court, and the Court of Appeals for a two-year term, which can be renewed. A trial court 
administrator (TCA) is hired by the circuit court presiding judge to assist in managing day-to-day local court administrative operations.  
  
Constitutional and Statutory Authority  
  
Judicial branch authority is established by the Oregon Constitution, primarily Article VII (Amended) and Article VII (Original). The authority covers 
all actions brought before a court under the Oregon Constitution and under the laws of the state. Courts must respond or interpret mandates contained 
in the United States and Oregon constitutions and the Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS).

•  Continued implementation of OJD Strategic Campaign Commitments. This campaign recognizes our constitutional obligation to 
provide justice for all Oregonians, makes four commitments to advance that cause, and sets out 19 initiatives. OJD has successfully 
implemented at least 75 percent of the work in each commitment and that work will continue to be supported through our 2023-25 policy 
option packages. Developed after a series of internal and external stakeholder meetings, the 19 initiatives generally support improving 
services for under-served or marginalized people, improving access to justice, enhancing public trust and confidence in state government, 
and creating a workplace that is welcoming, affirming, and inclusive. 

•  Kept courts open and people safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. In-person court hearings and activities were quickly restricted to 

dramatically reduce the number of people working or appearing in courthouses. A series of Chief Justice Orders prioritized essential court 
activities while giving presiding judges flexibility to meet local community needs. Courts at all levels quickly and dramatically expanded 
their ability to use technology to continue bench trials, hearings, oral arguments, and other proceedings through remote means to maintain 
access to justice. Required jury trials continued after ensuring distancing, cleaning, and other protective measures were enacted, and as 
facility and staff limitations allowed. As a result of these efforts, Oregon courts have been able to reduce pending caseloads in most case 
types to levels at or below what they were in 2019. 

•  Helped address Oregon’s public defense crisis. In response to the public defense crisis, the Chief Justice, courts, and the Office of the 
State Court Administrator have all made significant efforts to identify and implement efficiencies to alleviate the burdens on the public 
defense system. Some of the efforts include reducing pending criminal caseloads to reduce public defense caseloads; OJD-led 
collaborative problem-solving at the local level; developing a public defense data dashboard to show the location and status of 
unrepresented persons; and working with the Oregon State Bar (OSB) to expedite admission of out-of-state lawyers to practice in Oregon 
(comity rule), and with the Professional Liability Fund to allow retired attorneys to practice on a limited basis. In addition, the Criminal 
Justice Advisory Committee’s (CJAC) System Efficiencies subcommittee and the Uniform Trial Court Rules Committee are working 
collaboratively to evaluate and recommend additional system efficiencies including those proposed by criminal justice system 
stakeholders.  

•  Acted Quickly to Address Critical Elections Issues. The Oregon Supreme Court expedited decisions in cases to determine candidate 
eligibility and address challenges to legislative decisions in redistricting Oregon’s congressional and legislative districts, allowing 
democratic processes to continue uninterrupted. 

•  Expanded interview-based court forms for self-represented litigants. OJD is expanding the development and availability of OJD 

iForms – interview-based intelligent forms developed primarily for use by people not represented by attorneys in small claims, landlord-
tenant, a variety of family law case types, and many protective orders. These forms improve access to the courts by making it easier to

provide courts with the information necessary to efficiently and fairly adjudicate their cases. The forms can be updated to respond to law 
changes and can also be eFiled. Among the OJD iForms recently made available are: 

▪  Appointed Counsel Application – to demonstrate financial need and request a court-appointed public defense attorney 

▪  Elder/Disability Protection Order Application – to request protection for a person as allowed under the Elderly Person and Person 

with Disability Abuse Prevention Act 

▪  Eviction Set-Aside – a motion to reverse (set-aside) and seal a court’s judgement, verdict, or other final ruling in a case 

▪  Firearms Surrender Declaration – a response to a court order that a person has surrendered their firearms 

▪  Marijuana Conviction Set-Aside or Reduction – a motion to reverse (set-aside) a court’s judgement, verdict, or other final ruling 

for marijuana-related charges in a case or to reduce a marijuana conviction to a lower-level crime or violation 

▪  Modification of Family Law Judgment (Motion and Response) – a request for, or response to a request for a change in the terms 

set by the court such as parenting time 

▪  Name/Legal Sex Change Petition – a request to change a person’s name or legal sex 

▪  Payment Plan Application – a form to request the ability to pay court debt in installments over time 

▪  Criminal/Arrest/Contempt Set-Aside – a motion to overturn (set-aside) a court’s judgment, verdict, or other final ruling in a 

criminal case or set-aside and seal the record of an uncharged arrest or a finding of contempt of court 

▪  Fee Deferral and Waiver Application – self-represented litigants (SRLs) will be able to electronically submit applications for fee 

waivers or deferrals when filing civil pleadings such as small claims, landlord tenant, and identity record cases  

In addition, OJD is making these forms available in Spanish. To date, the Appointed Counsel Application and the Fee Deferral/Waiver 
application have been completed. 

•  Continued partnerships to replace unsafe courthouses. The first counties to receive state funding assistance to replace unsafe 

courthouses (Union and Jefferson) opened their new facilities in 2016. The new Multnomah County courthouse was completed in the fall 
of 2020. Planning funding has been provided for Lane, Clackamas, Linn, Benton, Crook, and Curry counties. Final construction funding 
requests in 2023-25 will include Benton, Clackamas, Curry, Harney, and Morrow counties, and planning funding will be requested for 
Hood River, Lincoln, Polk, Umatilla, and Washington counties.  

• 

Increased investments in Family Treatment Courts. Family Treatment Court (FTC) is a multidisciplinary, evidence-based, problem-
solving court model serving child-welfare-involved families where parental substance use is a factor contributing to abuse or neglect. To 
improve the likelihood of successful family reunification among this population, participants are supported by child welfare agencies,

DEPARTMENT SUMMARY 

behavioral health treatment professionals, and the dependency court system. Comprehensive case management increased judicial oversight, and 
frequent stakeholder collaboration occur in a non-adversarial setting that emphasizes sustainable recovery and the development of effective 
parenting skills. Prior to 2022, Oregon previously had eight FTCs spanning 14 counties across the state. The 2021 Legislature established a $10 
million Special Purpose Appropriation (SPA) for the expansion of FTCs. At the close of the 2022 session, the Legislature released 
$2,065,430 of the SPA funds, allocated among OJD, the Oregon Department of Human Services, the Public Defense Services 
Commission, and the Oregon Department of Justice. The distribution was used to fund statewide coordination and support, establish a 
new FTC in Clatsop County, augment FTC staffing to Columbia County, and provide participant supports (for example, housing 
assistance, childcare, and peer mentors) in Clatsop and Columbia counties. Later, the 2022 September Emergency Board released another 
$1.2 million to enable the implementation of new FTCs in Benton, Polk, Clackamas, and Josephine counties and ensure stability for the 
existing FTCs in Klamath County and in the 7th Judicial District (Sherman, Wheeler, Wasco, Hood River, and Gilliam counties). 

•  Completed initial rollout of 2021 Senate Bill 48, including Pretrial Release. In 2021, the Oregon Legislature passed SB 48 (Oregon 
Laws 2021, chapter 643) to reduce the reliance on security release (cash bail) and establish a statewide, court-based, pretrial release 
system. The Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court issued release guidelines for local court orders to:  

▪  provide a consistent release decision-making structure across the state;  

▪ 

▪ 

reduce the reliance on the use of security;  

include provisions for victim notification and input; and  

▪  balance the rights of the defendant and presumption of pretrial release against community and victim safety and the risk of failure 

to appear.  

Presiding judges created pretrial release orders in each circuit court that complied with the Chief Justice’s guidelines. During the 2022 
legislative session, 40 release assistance officer positions were allocated to OJD. These 40 positions were allocated to prioritize 
programming for circuit courts where no pretrial resources or programs existed. To continue implementation of SB 48, OJD has prepared 
a policy option package for the 2023-25 biennium requesting an additional 42 release assistance officers. 

•  Expanded the work of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging. OJD is committed to creating a workplace and 

courthouse culture that is equitable, inclusive, and diverse. As a first step toward that commitment, OJD has created an Equity, Diversity, 
Inclusion and Belonging (EDI/Belonging) plan that includes education and training for judges and staff. The EDI/Belonging plan aims to 
ensure that the core values of equity, inclusion, belonging, and diversity are a key part of our organization’s operations and are modeled in 
advancing our mission.

DEPARTMENT SUMMARY 

On August 1, 2022, Chief Justice Martha Walters issued Chief Justice Order 22-014 establishing an OJD Equity Framework. The equity 
framework describes a method of examining, analyzing, and investigating both the process and the impact of decision-making and 
policies to ensure access, inclusion, and equitable outcomes. 

The Oregon Supreme Court Council on Inclusion and Fairness (OSCCIF) works to ensure that all persons have access to Oregon state 
courts for fair and efficient dispute resolution. It also advises the Chief Justice on matters of systemic racial, ethnic, and gender bias in the 
Oregon Judicial Department. 

•  Reorganized and augmented the services at OSCA. The Office of the State Court Administrator added capacity and restructured to 

increase support for courts and add a much-needed civil and criminal programs division. The restructure included creating two Assistant 
Deputy State Court Administrator positions. One provides executive leadership over the operations divisions, including the Business and 
Fiscal Services Division, Enterprise Technology and Services Division, and the Human Resources Services Division. The other oversees 
the on-going development and creation of court all program areas, including the Juvenile and Family Court Programs, Civil and Criminal 
Programs, and the Court Language Access Services. A new division director is leading the new civil and criminal programs division, 
bringing opportunities for innovation and increased consistency to Oregon courts. 

•  Incentivized new hires and retention. The Chief Justice implemented an incentive payment for onsite staff to assist Oregon’s courts that 
are struggling to retain staff and to compete for potential candidates in the current highly competitive job market, while continuing to 
conform with compensation in the other branches of state government. The payments occur three times during the 2021-23 biennium to 
provide ongoing retention and recruitment incentives. The payments are based on 5 percent of the salary of OJD’s core workforce, the 
Judicial Services Specialist classification, and maintains reasonable conformity with executive branch compensation as required by law.  

•  Developed cutting-edge information tools. OJD continues to develop and refine the data tools needed to understand and manage the 
work of the courts and divisions. Thanks to data provided by the Oregon eCourt case management system, 30 statewide dashboards 
provide real-time information about OJD’s operations. This allows judges, executive leaders, and staff the ability to report information 
and manage the work from the highest levels or drill down into a single case to make informed decisions as they strive to meet all key 
performance measure goals.  

•  Improving assistance to people with behavioral health challenges. Oregon is currently experiencing a behavioral health crisis that has 
substantially increased the number of defendants who are unable to aid and assist in their own defense and strained the Oregon State 
Hospital and other system partners. The Chief Justice established the Behavioral Health Advisory Committee (BHAC) in late 2019. The 
BHAC advises the Chief Justice on best practices for use in case and docket management, and in decision-making in cases involving court 
users with behavioral health issues. During the 2021-23 biennium the Legislature allocated new positions to OJD to specifically work on 
improving the support to those in the justice system with issues related to behavioral health.

DEPARTMENT SUMMARY 

Oregon’s work in this area, led by BHAC Co-Chairs Nan Waller and Suzanne Chanti, has been recognized at the national level. Judge 
Nan Waller received the annual Rehnquist Award, a national award recognizing judicial excellence, in part for her efforts to improve state 
courts’ response to individuals with serious mental illness. Both Judge Waller and State Court Administrator Nancy Cozine participated in 
a national Task Force on Mental Illness, taking an active role in the creation of resources and tools that can be utilized by courts to better 
address behavioral health needs across all case types. A full report, issued by the National Center for State Courts, can be found here 
https://www.ncsc.org/__data/assets/pdf_file/0031/84469/MHTF_State_Courts_Leading_Change.pdf.  

OSCA staff worked with courts to ensure that every court has judges and staff who are specifically trained in aid and assist practices, 
consolidating cases and creating dedicated aid and assist dockets so that individuals returning to the court after an assessment or treatment 
will see the same, knowledgeable judge and staff. Additionally, OSCA's behavioral health staff developed behavioral health resources that 
have been highlighted across the country, such as: 

▪  An electronic dashboard with critical aid and assist data. 

▪  Best practices documentation generated by recommendations from Oregon courts, other state courts, and national organizations. 

▪  A collection of statewide aid and assist orders for use by judges and attorneys.  

▪  Regular meetings with judges and staff to drive implementation of best practices in aid and assist and civil commitment cases. 

▪  Stakeholder engagements to improve services and delivery systems. 

Reduction Options 

RS 291.206 requires the Governor to submit an alternative budget plan that funds agencies at 90 percent of their Current Service Level (CSL) 
funding. The following information summarizes the application of this level of reduction to the Current Service Level budget in the Chief Justice’s 
Recommended Budget. Because major elements in the OJD budget cannot be reduced (debt service and judicial compensation), a 10 percent 
reduction translates into up to a 15 percent reduction to court operations and other program areas that can lawfully be reduced.  

regon Judicial Department Budget 

ebt Service:  The OJD CSL budget request is for $659.8 million in General Fund. Debt service ($47.2 million, 7.15 percent of the budget) is 
excluded from the calculation reduction per statute, resulting in a budget of $612.5 million for OJD and a 10 percent reduction target of $61.5 
million.

DEPARTMENT SUMMARY 

 
Judicial Compensation:  $105,930,600 (16.5 percent of 
CSL budget). This appropriation provides for 
constitutionally protected compensation (within term) of 
filled judgeship positions. Since this appropriation 
cannot be reduced, the $10.6 million that otherwise 
would be reduced here must be shifted to other 
appropriations. This is the equivalent of an additional 47 
FTE staff positions. 

ass-Throughs:  $30,738,119 (4.65 percent of CSL 

budget). This appropriation provides pass-through 
funding to counties for law libraries and for mediation 
and conciliation services, to the Oregon State Bar for 
Legal Aid services, to the Council on Court Procedures, 
and to the Oregon Law Commission. Reductions to these 
pass-through entities will result in impacts to people and 
communities that depend on these services.

payments. Therefore, reducing this appropriation by 
$1.74 million would result in $8.7 million in lost revenue to the state’s General Fund. It also would reduce employment at the entities that conduct 
collection activities – the Oregon Department of Revenue (DOR) and private collection companies. The major recipients of these cost payments are 
the DOR and private collection companies. On average, 65 percent of this appropriation is paid to DOR for collection and tax-offset activities. 
Expenditures are only paid for successful collection of a debt, so reducing this appropriation would limit revenue that otherwise would come to the 
state, victims of crime, and local governments. Additionally, approximately 13 percent of expenditures are the result of merchant fees associated with 
the use of credit cards to pay fines and fees. On average, expenditures from this line item returns $5 in revenues for each $1 expended on collections.  

andated Payments:  $18,895,302 (2.86 percent of CSL budget). The appropriation provides statutory payments for jury service, statutory 
interpreter services for non-English speakers (including crime victims exercising their constitutional rights of participation), statutory arbitration

expenses, and Americans with Disabilities Act compliance related to jury service or interpreting. The vast majority of expenditures are for jury 
payments and interpreter services for hearings, trials, and other proceedings. Reductions to this appropriation would require a reduction in the 
number of jury trials conducted and increase the wait time for trials and hearings requiring juries or interpreters. This slowdown would reduce timely 
access to justice, especially in family law and civil cases, and increase the state’s potential liability for not meeting statutory and constitutional 
requirements for timely trials. 

regon eCourt Program Operations and Maintenance:  $8,787,755 (1.33 percent of CSL budget). A 10 percent reduction would be $878,776. 
Many of the expenses paid from this appropriation are binding contractual obligations with technology service providers. OJD would have limited 
opportunities to implement reductions and would need to shift these reductions to the Operations appropriation, further reducing court operations and 
other core functions.  

perations – Trial Courts:  $307,231,727 (46.55 percent of CSL budget). A 10 percent reduction to this appropriation would be $27.8 million to 

the trial courts operating budget. Trial court operations provide a majority of the direct public services offered by OJD, as well as the largest 
appropriation in the OJD budget. Trial court operations consist primarily of personal services costs. As with past reduction implementations, 
reductions in the trial courts predominately impact staffing for court operations. A 10 percent reduction in this appropriation would result in an 
approximate loss of 136 FTE in court personnel. Reductions of this magnitude would dramatically reduce public service hours in courts, delay 
resolution of cases and stall implementation of critical statewide reform efforts to improve justice outcomes such as risk-based pretrial release 
programs, eviction diversion programs, and specialty court approaches for veterans and others, delay issuing or recall of arrest warrants, or reduce the 
number of cases the courts could process. Courts likely would be required to prioritize criminal trials over civil and family law cases or other 
functions, delaying critical work that is not subject to specific constitutional or statutory time restrictions. Actual implementation of FTE losses of 
this magnitude may result in the Chief Justice partially closing some court locations in order to maintain public access and services at other locations 
serving a larger population base. Additionally, reduced staffing would negatively impact correct data entry and timely audit of data, reducing the 
accuracy of OJD data and data dashboards.  

perations – Appellate/Tax Court:  $29,281,925 (4.4 percent of CSL budget). A 10 percent reduction in this area would be $2.93 million. This 
reduction likely would result in a minimum loss of 13 FTE who provide direct legal and administrative support to the judges on the Supreme Court, 
the Court of Appeals, and the Tax Court. Expected outcomes include severe delays of review, analysis, and decisions in all three courts, meaning less 
guidance to Oregonians on legal issues of statewide importance and delays in resolving tax appeals, correcting legal errors, and other issues of 
statewide importance. These courts would likely be required to reduce public access hours and only process the most critical or urgent cases.  

perations – Administration and Central Support:  $94,287,496 (14.3 percent of CSL budget). A 10 percent reduction in this appropriation area 

would be $9.5 million. More than one-third of this appropriation funds non-reducible expenses like state government service charges, rent (a 
significant part to the Department of Administrative Services), workers compensation insurance, and network and system access. Although some

reductions would only reflect reductions in FTE from other appropriations (e.g., fewer trial court staff), reductions at this level would result in less 
support for Oregon’s foster care program; reduced computer and information technology support, threatening the ability to test and implement 
patches and upgrades to critical technology systems, reduced support for remote hearings and proceedings in courts; reduced computer security 
investment; and elimination of maintenance payments on information security programs, which would increase system risk and computer downtime. 
OJD would be forced to reduce legal review, training and education for judges and staff; reduce access to legal resources available to courts and the 
public through the State of Oregon Law Library; reduce support to trial court operations in resolving legal issues, implementing a statewide pretrial 
program, and in developing more efficient business processes, providing forms to assist litigants in providing information to the courts, and reducing 
support for courts in adjudicating family law cases; and stop replacement of critical systems. Additionally, it would be much more difficult to collect 
and disseminate accurate and useful statewide data. Due to non-reducible areas, the result of reductions would be compounded and would result in 
the loss of the equivalent of 42 FTE (or greater).

•  The 1981 Legislative Assembly created the Oregon Judicial Department (OJD) by consolidating Oregon’s district courts, circuit courts, 

and the appellate courts into a unified, state-funded court system, effective January 1, 1983. Municipal, county, and justice courts continue 
as limited-jurisdiction tribunals outside of the state-funded court system and are not subject to its administrative control and oversight.  

•  Effective September 1, 1997, the Legislature created a Tax Magistrate Division in the Oregon Tax Court to replace the administrative tax 

appeals structure formerly in the Department of Revenue. The tax magistrates are appointed by the Tax Court Judge.  

•  Effective January 15, 1998, the Legislature abolished the district courts and merged their judges and jurisdiction with that of the circuit 

courts to form a single unified trial court level.  

•  Effective July 1, 2001, the indigent defense program transferred from OJD to a separate and autonomous Public Defense Services 

Commission that resides within the judicial branch of government.  

•  Effective October 1, 2013, the Legislature added a new three-judge panel to the Court of Appeals, bringing the total judicial positions to

judicial district elections for six-year terms. There are 27 judicial districts comprised of one or more counties. State courts handle approximately one 
million filings a biennium and employ approximately 1,800 staff at the state and local court levels.

DEPARTMENT SUMMARY 

Agency-wide Program Unit Summary 

dministration:  The Chief Justice is responsible for administration of Oregon’s unified, state-funded court system in the judicial branch of government. 

This program area covers the administration infrastructure and central state entity costs. The State Court Administrator (SCA) serves under the direction 
of the Chief Justice and manages the Office of the State Court Administrator (OSCA) and the central administrative infrastructure and state programs of 
the court system. ORS chapter 8 establishes and defines the primary duties of the SCA. In this capacity, the SCA supervises budget, accounting, 
procurement, human resources, legal, audit, education and outreach (for judges, staff, stakeholders, and the public), pro tempore services, information 
technology infrastructure, and technology projects such as the Oregon eCourt program. In addition, the SCA has responsibility for administrative 
management of the appellate court records, the State of Oregon Law Library, OJD publications, OJD security and emergency preparedness program, OJD 
court interpreter certification and services program, juvenile court improvement program, and state Citizen Review Board program. 

he Administration program area also funds and manages the centralized costs and assessments paid for all of OJD as a state entity and for its judges and 

staff, including state government assessments and system use charges, rent, debt service, tort claims, and risk management. 

ppellate/Tax Court Operations:  This budget program area covers the staff and operations of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, and the Tax 
Court. All three courts are located in Salem. The Supreme Court is the highest-level court in Oregon. It has discretion to accept review of appeals from the 
Court of Appeals and the Tax Court and has areas of original jurisdiction as well. Administratively it has additional statutory responsibilities as a body, 
such as being involved with regulation of the state practice of law (through the state bar) and approving pro tempore judges.  

he Court of Appeals is Oregon’s intermediate appellate court. By statute, the Court of Appeals is charged with deciding nearly all the civil and criminal 
appeals taken from Oregon’s state trial courts and nearly all the judicial reviews taken from administrative agencies in contested cases. Created by statute 
in 1969, the Court of Appeals exercises jurisdiction as set by the Legislature. 

he Tax Court is a unique court with statewide exclusive jurisdiction to hear only cases that involve Oregon’s tax laws, including income taxes, corporate 

excise taxes, property taxes, timber taxes, cigarette taxes, local budget laws, and property tax limitations. All trials are before a judge and appeals go 
directly to the Supreme Court. The Oregon Tax Court has two divisions – a Regular Division and the Magistrate Division. In the late 1990s, the Tax 
Magistrate Division was created as a component part of the Tax Court to replace the informal administrative tax appeals process previously conducted by 
the Department of Revenue. The Tax Court judge appoints a presiding magistrate and other magistrates to hear cases in the Magistrate Division. The 
Magistrate Division tries or mediates all tax appeals, unless the Tax Court judge assigns the case to the Regular Division. A party may appeal a 
magistrate’s decision to the judge of the Tax Court, except in cases filed as small claims. Decisions in small claims procedures are final and not 
appealable. Appeals from Regular Division decisions go directly to the Supreme Court.

DEPARTMENT SUMMARY 

 
Trial Court Operations:  Funding for the staff and operations of all state trial courts (circuit courts) are included in this program area. It is the largest 
program area because it includes the staff and services for all circuit court operations in each county.  

he circuit court is Oregon’s trial court of general jurisdiction. This means the courts hear all case types regardless of the subject matter, amount of money 
involved, or the severity of the crime alleged. Circuit court judges preside over specialized dockets including drug courts, veteran courts, family treatment 
courts, aid and assist dockets, and other reformative programs, convene system improvement meetings at the local level, provide civics lessons to students 
and others who tour Oregon courts, and adjudicate matters and disputes in criminal, civil, domestic relations, traffic, juvenile, small claims, violations, 
abuse prevention, probate, mental commitments, adoption, and guardianship cases. These courts handle more than 500,000 new cases filed each year, or 
more than 1,000,000 filings a biennium. This number does not include the hundreds of thousands of post-judgment proceedings, and motions and hearings 
that happen within open cases. Decisions appealed from circuit courts go to the Court of Appeals, except for death penalty that go directly to the Supreme 
Court. 

andated Payments:  The Mandated Payments program funds the federally- and state-mandated ancillary services of providing and paying for trial 

jurors and grand jurors, court interpreters, civil arbitration costs for indigents, appellate civil transcript costs, and Americans with Disabilities Act 
accommodation equipment and services for litigants and the public.

REVENUES 

Revenues 

he majority of the Oregon Judicial Department’s (OJD) revenues are generated from statutory filing fees and from fines, fees, and restitution 

associated with cases in the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Tax Court, and 36 trial courts. Other revenues are generated from the sales of 
publications and court information, transfers of revenue from other state agencies, local and federal grants, and from others that assist OJD in 
meeting its mission. 

evenue estimates included in this budget document are based on the June 2022 forecast prepared by the Office of Economic Analysis (OEA). The 
OEA’s General Fund forecast contains two court revenue line items, termed State Court Fees (General Fund) and the Criminal Fine Account, which 
terms we also use in our publications. 

ransfers to General Fund:  OJD generates revenue directly for the benefit of the state General Fund from filing fees, trial and hearing fees, court 
collection fees, parking fines, security release fees, forfeitures, and judgments and residual revenue from previously imposed fees for; driver’s license 
suspension fees (discontinued in 2020) and expired temporary probation surcharges. Though driver’s license suspension fees are no longer imposed 
there are residual collections related to previously imposed amounts, and while the practice of security release has been reduced, there are still some 
cases where security release is posted and forfeited for violation of a release agreement and security judgments are imposed. Revenues to the General 
Fund are projected to total $139.2 million for the 2023-25 biennium. 

ransfers to Criminal Fine Account (CFA):  Court revenues from fines, diversion fees, indigent defense recoupment, and recovery of court costs 

in the circuit courts are transferred to the Department of Revenue for deposit to the CFA. The total amount projected for the 2023-25 biennium is 
$86.9 million. By statute, these revenues are prioritized to fund Department of Public Safety Standards and Training operations, Department of 
Justice Criminal Injuries Compensation Account, OJD State Court Facilities and Security Account, OJD State Court Technology Fund, Department 
of Corrections construction, and Oregon Health Authority Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicants programs. The remaining CFA funds after 
those distributions are deposited into the General Fund. 

ransfers to State and Local Government Agencies:  Other revenue is generated from fines, fees, and the public defense application/contribution 

program. These monies are transferred to state and local governments as well as other entities. The 2023-25 biennium projection is $36.4 million.  

ransfers to Victims:  Collection of $23.5 million in restitution and compensatory fines are projected for the 2023-25 biennium. These funds are 

distributed directly to victims.

•  Criminal Fine Account to the State Court Technology Fund to pay for expenditures authorized under ORS 1.012 for developing, 
maintaining and supporting state court electronic applications, services, and systems and for providing access to and use of those 
applications, services, and systems – $3.9 million 

•  ePay convenience fees to pay for the vendor transaction costs associated with hosting the ePay system – $0.6 million 

•  A statutorily-designated percentage of filing fees to pay for the eFile and eService transaction fees for Odyssey File and Serve – $7.0

Grants:  Revenues from some grants come from local community partners who are direct or pass-through recipients of federal grants. A small 
portion of our grants are directly provided by the federal government. 

•  Grants with community partners, including Oregon counties and nonprofit entities, for programs such as specialty courts, juvenile court 

improvements, and arbitration and mediation programs – $5.0 million 

•  Agreements with Multnomah County for the circuit court Legal Resource Center and with the Office of Public Defense Services for

APPELLATE AND TAX COURTS 

Appellate and Tax Courts 

he Appellate/Tax Court Operations program budget includes the operations and staffing of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Appellate Court 

Services Division (ACSD), and Tax Court. The Supreme Court is established by the Oregon Constitution and consists of seven justices elected to 
serve six-year terms, one of whom is selected from among his/her peers to serve as the Chief Justice for the branch in a six-year term. The Court of 
Appeals consists of 13 statewide-elected judges who hear appeals from trial courts and state agencies and boards. The Tax Court consists of one 
statewide-elected judge who hears matters in the Tax Court Regular Division that arise from Oregon tax law and hears appeals from the Tax 
Magistrate Division, created in 1997 to replace the informal administrative tax appeals process conducted by the Department of Revenue. ACSD is 
the appellate clerk’s office for both the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals and as such, serves attorneys, litigants, and the public in addition to 
managing ancillary programs and services.  

Supreme Court 

he Supreme Court is Oregon’s court of last resort and exists by virtue of Article VII (Amended) of the Oregon Constitution. The Supreme Court has 

the ultimate responsibility for interpreting Oregon law. The court’s decisions with respect to Oregon constitutional, statutory, administrative, and 
common law are not subject to further judicial review, except potentially by the United States Supreme Court to ensure consistency with federal law. 

ases come before the Supreme Court in a variety of ways, and jurisdiction is conferred by both the Oregon Constitution and by statute. The court 

primarily is a court of appellate review, reviewing the decisions of lower courts and other bodies, but it also has original jurisdiction and direct 
review by statute in several types of cases. In most of the cases before the court on the merits, the justices have exercised their discretion and 
determined that the matters present important questions of Oregon law; various constitutional provisions and statutes also mandate that the court hear 
certain types of cases. 

Note: All statistics provided below are from the calendar years 2017 through 2021.) 

onstitutional Jurisdiction 

hen the voters adopted Article VII (Amended) of the Oregon Constitution in 1910, they provided the Supreme Court with constitutional authority 

to exercise discretionary original jurisdiction in mandamus (involving the exercise of public duties), habeas corpus (questioning whether 
incarceration is lawful), and quo warranto (concerning the right to hold a public office) proceedings. The court typically receives between 70 to 100 
such petitions each year, the majority of which are mandamus petitions. The court considers all petitions in those types of cases but allows only a 
small percentage to decide on the merits. The Oregon Constitution also establishes mandatory original jurisdiction to consider any challenges to the 
decennial reapportionment of legislative districts.

Statutory Jurisdiction 

APPELLATE AND TAX COURTS 

he primary work of the Supreme Court is to perform discretionary review of decisions of the Oregon Court of Appeals. Those cases may be appeals 

from the Oregon circuit courts or may be on petition for judicial review of certain agency decisions. In either event, a non-prevailing litigant in the 
Court of Appeals may file a petition for review in the Supreme Court, which ultimately presents two questions to the Supreme Court: (1) whether to 
allow review of the petition and consider the legal question(s) presented and, (2) if the court allows the petition, to decide the legal question(s) on the 
merits. Both decisions are significant, and the court devotes substantial resources toward considering whether a particular petition for review presents 
an important question for Supreme Court resolution. The court typically considers between 670 and 750 such petitions for review each year and 
typically “allows” – that is, agrees to consider the question on the merits – between six to eight percent. Between 76 to 82 percent of the cases filed in 
the Supreme Court each year are petitions to review Court of Appeals decisions.  

he Supreme Court has statutory authority to hear other types of cases that do not proceed first through the Court of Appeals in the manner just 

described. For example, under Oregon statutes, the court has discretionary authority to consider certified questions of Oregon law from other courts 
(typically from either Oregon’s United States District Court or the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit), and certified appeals from 
the Oregon Court of Appeals.  

he Supreme Court also has a substantial docket of cases that, pursuant to statute, come directly to the court on mandatory direct appeal or review, or 

requiring mandatory review in the first instance, including the following: 

•  Automatic appeals of circuit court cases in which a sentence of death was imposed (until recent years, typically one to two such cases 

filed each year but none since 2016; the cases are complex and extensively briefed); 

•  State-initiated appeals of circuit court orders dismissing the accusatory instrument or suppressing evidence in certain criminal cases (an 

average of one to two cases annually); 

•  Appeals from crime victims pertaining to the exercise of their rights in criminal proceedings (between one to three cases annually); 

•  Appeals from the Oregon Tax Court (an average of three to four cases annually); 

•  Appeals involving certain types of labor disputes (infrequent); 

•  Judicial review of administrative siting decisions for prison, energy production, and waste disposal facilities and transmission lines (also 

infrequent but often complex), and related rules challenges;

APPELLATE AND TAX COURTS 

•  Requests for review in lawyer discipline, reinstatement, and admissions matters (about 55 to 75 cases annually; of those, the court decides 

an average of three cases on the merits, following a party’s request for review of a Disciplinary Board trial panel or Board of Bar 
Examiners decision); 

•  Recommendations relating to judicial fitness and disability (infrequent, but at times complex); 

•  Reviews of election-related petitions, including ballot title review proceedings and challenges to Voters’ Pamphlet explanatory and fiscal 

impact statements (an average of 19 cases annually); and 

•  Specific cases or issues that the Legislature has directed the Supreme Court to consider, either on original review or on appeal (e.g., PERS 

challenges and other particular complex legislation challenges; other past examples include light-rail siting decisions, challenges to 
revenue measures, and property crimes sentencing legislation review) (from zero to two such opinions per year). 

inally, either by legislative direction or pursuant to the court’s own internal practices, a number of case types are considered and decided on an 
expedited basis. Those cases include, but are not limited to, death sentence review proceedings; ballot title and other election law matters; attorney 
and judicial decision cases; mandamus petitions; labor and facilities siting cases; and petitions for review of Court of Appeals decisions involving 
children (juvenile, adoption, and custody disputes).

itting, as it does, at the apex of Oregon’s third branch of government, the Supreme Court has been assigned significant regulatory responsibilities 
relating to the administration of Oregon’s judicial system. The court, for example, is responsible for appointing, among other positions, pro tempore 
and senior judges, members of the Board of Bar Examiners (lawyer admission), members of the Bar's State Professional Responsibility Board and the 
Bar's Disciplinary Board (lawyer discipline), the Bar's Unlawful Practice of Law Committee; and the Bar's Mentors for new lawyers. The Supreme 
Court also has substantial rulemaking responsibilities. The court reviews and approves a variety of rules affecting the practice of law, including 
amendments to the Oregon Rules of Professional Conduct (lawyer ethics), the Oregon Rules of Appellate Procedure, the Oregon Rules for Admission 
of Attorneys, the Oregon State Bar Rules of Procedure, the rules and regulations governing Mandatory Continuing Legal Education for Oregon 
Lawyers, and some Uniform Trial Court Rules. The court also has statutory responsibility to adopt certain court forms (currently, DUII Diversion 
forms). 

he administrative and regulatory elements of the court’s workload fall most heavily on the Chief Justice, who, in addition to managing the Supreme 

Court, is the administrative head of the entire Oregon unified court system. The primary authority of the Chief Justice is set forth in ORS 1.002. In 
addition, under ORS 1.003, the Chief Justice is responsible for appointing the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, the presiding judge of the Tax 
Court, the presiding judges for each of Oregon’s 27 judicial districts, and the State Court Administrator. The Chief Justice also approves the unified 
biennial budget for the operating resources of the Oregon Judicial Department and approves all Uniform Trial Court Rules, except those for which 
the full Supreme Court has approval authority. Finally, the Chief Justice is a nonvoting, ex officio member of the Oregon Public Defense Services 
Commission and has statutory responsibility to appoint the voting Commission members. 

orkload Distribution and Case Processing 

he Supreme Court considers the judicial matters before it en banc, with all seven justices participating in any substantive decision (unlike the Court 
of Appeals, which decides many of its cases by three-judge panels). The Supreme Court does so primarily because it is Oregon’s court of last resort. 
It is critical that each justice – unless recused from the case – fully contributes to the final expression of Oregon law. Full court consideration applies 
not only to the opinions that the court issues, but also to all petitions and substantive motions that the court decides. The court also receives a 
substantial number of motions that are not substantive in nature; such motions – such as motions for extension of time – are typically decided by a 
designated Presiding Justice.  

etitions for review, petitions for reconsideration, petitions for writs, and substantive motions are assigned on a rotational basis to one of the 
associate justices for preparation of a legal staff memorandum that summarizes the petition, motion, or other matter, and makes a recommended 
disposition, which the assigned justice reviews and supplements with the justice's own recommended disposition. If the court decides to allow a 
petition or writ when it has discretion to do so, then it allows by order and schedules the case for briefing and argument. Mandatory review cases are

typically scheduled for briefing as soon as preliminary matters (such as the record or transcript) are completed, and then are scheduled for argument 
as briefing is submitted. After cases on the merits are argued, the Chief Justice assigns cases to a particular justice for the purpose of writing an 
opinion. The Supreme Court strives to issue more than 50 percent of its written decisions within six months of argument or submission, with no 
decisions issued more than one year after argument or submission. In recent years, the court has released more than 60 percent of its decisions within 
the six-month timeframe, with only one to two decisions past the one-year timeframe. 

he court hears oral argument in January, March, May, June, September, and November, scheduling multiple arguments in each of those months. 

The court sits in conference, on average, two times each month, to consider the cases, petitions, and substantive motions for which an opinion draft or 
legal staff memorandum (with accompanying justice recommendations) has circulated. Court conferences usually last one day. The court holds 
emergency conferences when needed to consider petitions or substantive motions requiring immediate attention. Finally, the court holds monthly 
public meetings (except in August) at which it addresses appointments, rulemaking, and other non-adjudicatory matters. 

utomation, Access, and Outreach 

s discussed under the Appellate Court Services Division section, the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals use a fully automated appellate case 

management system that encompasses electronic filing, electronic payment in conjunction with electronic filing, electronic case management, 
internal court workload management, electronic document management, and financial management. Oregon State Bar members are required to file 
all documents in the appellate courts electronically, unless a waiver is obtained. All case information, as well as case documents, are processed 
electronically. For those who are permitted to and opt to file in paper form, the courts have eliminated previous requirements to file accompanying 
paper copies. Members of the Supreme Court have the option of reading briefs, draft opinions, and other official documents on tablet devices or 
desktop computers, rather than by reading paper copies. Petitions for review, other petitions and motions, and all staff memos are processed and 
reviewed in electronic format, rather than on paper copies. 

uring the COVID-19 pandemic, the Supreme Court transitioned its oral arguments, as well as its public meetings, from in-person at the courthouse 

to remote arguments and remote meetings. The court has transitioned back to in-person oral arguments, but parties are permitted to request remote 
arguments by motion. Most oral arguments are broadcast from the Supreme Court courtroom over the web (confidential cases and cases involving 
protective orders are not broadcast). Most oral arguments are available both by way of streaming live broadcasts as the oral arguments occur and, any 
time after the argument is completed, by access to archived versions of those oral arguments. Public meetings, like arguments, again held in-person, 
but any participating person may appear by video, and public meetings are streamed live over the web. 

he Supreme Court maintains a web page with information about the members of the court and its operations, as well as a court calendar, published 

opinions, and media releases. Redacted versions of most briefs are available online through the State of Oregon Law Library, and, as noted, the 
website also includes links to livestreaming or recordings of most Supreme Court oral arguments. That collective information available on the web,

as well as the statewide webcasting service, enhances public accessibility and serves as an educational training resource for the larger legal 
community.  

APPELLATE AND TAX COURTS 

inally, before the COVID-19 pandemic, the Supreme Court regularly scheduled in-person oral arguments around the state each year, at high 

schools, colleges, law schools, and other community locations. Such off-site arguments let students and the public observe oral argument in person, 
and to engage in question-and-answer exchanges with the justices following argument. The court intends to add off-site arguments back to its 
schedule.

APPELLATE AND TAX COURTS 

he Court of Appeals is Oregon’s intermediate appellate court. By statute, the Court of Appeals is charged with deciding nearly all the civil and 

criminal appeals taken from Oregon’s state trial courts and nearly all the judicial reviews taken from state administrative agencies in contested cases. 
Created by statute in 1969, the Court of Appeals does not exercise any constitutional jurisdiction; instead, its jurisdiction is set by the Legislature.  
  
Historically, whether measured against the number of appeals taken by population or by the number of appeals taken by judge, the Oregon Court of 
Appeals consistently has ranked as one of the busiest appellate courts in the nation. Over the past five years, annual filings in the Court of Appeals 
have ranged from between approximately 2,100 to 3,300 cases per year. That number has varied, at least in part, because of changing economic 
conditions, changes in statutes or case law that may generate “spikes” in filings, and, most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. 
  
In 2012, considering the increasing volume and complexity of the court’s workload, the Legislative Assembly passed HB 4026-B, amending ORS 
2.540 to increase the number of Court of Appeals judges from 10 to 13. As a result, three new judges joined the court in late 2013. Two immediate 
benefits of this additional judicial resource were decreasing the length of time to schedule cases for oral argument after briefing had been completed 
and increasing the number of written opinions issued by the court. 
  
The new panel of judges and some process improvements allowed the court to significantly reduce the number of “at issue” cases, that is, those cases 
that are fully briefed but have not yet been scheduled for oral argument or submission for decision on the briefs. After reducing the number of “at 
issue” cases, the court turned its attention to its backlog of cases that are “under advisement,” that is, those cases in which oral argument has been 
heard (or the cases have been submitted on the briefs) and in which decisions have not yet been issued. The court formed a backlog-reduction work 
group to address that challenge. Members of the work group, which initially convened in February 2016, spoke with all Court of Appeals judges and 
staff, gathering ideas about process changes that could enhance the court’s ability to efficiently issue decisions while maintaining the quality and 
integrity of its decision-making process. The work group ultimately recommended about two dozen ways in which the court could streamline some of 
its internal processes. The court approved those changes in May 2016, and their implementation resulted in new efficiencies in case processing. As a 
result of those efforts, and the opportunity presented by a temporary dip in filings during the COVID-19 pandemic, the court has reduced its current 
backlog of cases to its lowest point in more than a decade. 

he court is also actively exploring process changes that will allow it to further reduce its backlog and to increase the transparency of its decision-
making as filings return to their typical levels. The court's benchmark for deciding most types of cases is 180 days from submission, and it meets that 
benchmark for approximately 80 percent of its cases. However, in order to do so, the court resorts to the practice of affirming without opinion 
(AWOP). The AWOP practice has been a part of the court almost from its inception and, as recently as 2019, accounted for 60 percent of the court's 
decisions. The issuance of unexplained decisions in so many cases has the potential to undermine confidence in the court's decision-making, so the 
court is addressing that in two ways.

First, in June 2022, the court adopted temporary rules allowing for the issuance of nonprecedential memorandum opinions. The court's intent in 
adopting those rules was to create a new tool for resolving the cases presented to it in a timely way that best meets the needs of the parties to the case 
and best serves the interests of the public. Allowing for the issuance of nonprecedential opinions has brought the court in line with similar state and 
federal intermediate appellate courts, which reserve precedential opinions for cases involving the court’s law-announcing function, and which use 
nonprecedential opinions in cases that call for the court to perform its error-correcting function. In cases that call upon the court to review and correct 
for error only, the option to designate an opinion as nonprecedential allows the court to issue decisions more efficiently because the court can write 
the opinions with a targeted audience in mind: the parties, their lawyers (when represented), and the trial court or agency that issued the decision, all 
of whom will be familiar with the facts and legal issues in the case and just need a timely decision from this court resolving the claims of error raised. 

econd, and more comprehensively, the court is redesigning its workflow management processes to increase its efficiency and effectiveness. Earlier 

this year, the court obtained a grant from the State Justice Institute to work with the National Center for State Courts to assess the court's caseflow 
management practices. The court is in the midst of that study, the objectives of which are (1) to develop a caseflow management program that 
involves screening, weighting, equitable distribution of case assignments, and standards for the expected amount of time to resolve a given case, as 
well as expectations as to what work will be completed prior to submission ("frontloading"); and (2) to develop a transition plan for moving from the 
court's current practices to an active caseflow management program. The ultimate goal is a "right-size" approach to case management that will allow 
the court to simultaneously reduce its benchmarks, deliver timely decisions in an even higher percentage of cases, and do so in a way that comports 
with best practices for appellate courts by supplying a reasoned explanation to the parties. 
  
The information contained in this narrative is merely a summary of the court’s structure, workload, and projects. 
  
Workload Distribution  
  
The Court of Appeals currently consists of 13 judges. To meet the demand of its substantial workload – and consistently with the authority granted 
the court by the Legislative Assembly – the court is divided into four departments (or “panels”) of three judges each for the purpose of considering 
and deciding cases. In addition, there is a two-judge Motions Department – presently drawn from members of the four “regular” departments – that 
considers some of the substantive motions filed in appeals or judicial reviews. The Chief Judge acts as a nonvoting member in each of the court’s 
departments and participates in their deliberations. That participation, which is in addition to the Chief Judge’s administrative and other 
responsibilities, both permits the Chief Judge to act as a substitute voting member in any department when one of the other judges cannot participate 
(due to conflict of interest, for example) and helps to ensure consistency among the decision-making of the various departments. Finally, before a 
department releases an opinion in a case, the proposed opinion is circulated to all the court’s judges, and the court then may elect to consider the case 
en banc (by the full 13-judge court). The Chief Judge also possesses the statutory authority to compel en banc consideration of a case.

APPELLATE AND TAX COURTS 

 
Case Processing  
  
The path of an appeal follows this general pattern, which is described in more detail below. A notice of appeal or petition for judicial review is filed, 
following a trial court or agency decision that is subject to review by the court. A transcript or record of the proceeding is filed with the court, and 
pre-briefing motions may be filed. Some cases are referred to the Appellate Settlement Program (described in more detail below), resolved on motion 
by the Appellate Commissioner, the Motions Department, or, at times, the Chief Judge, or dismissed by court rule. Once briefing is completed, the 
case is “at issue” and ready to be calendared for submission to one of the court's four departments. Once calendared, litigants, unless self-represented, 
have the option to opt into oral argument; if no party opts into oral argument, then the case is submitted to the department for decision on the briefs 
alone. Absent unusual circumstances, no more than thirty minutes of argument time (15 minutes per side) is allotted for each appeal. Cases move to 
the status of “under advisement” once argument has been completed or the case has been submitted to a panel of the court for decision on the briefs. 

n appeal or judicial review can result in a dismissal short of a decision on the merits for a number of reasons. A party may voluntarily dismiss the 

case due to settlement or for some other reason, or there also can be jurisdictional problems or a failure to prosecute the case. All but a handful of 
dismissals arise before the case is submitted for decision. Even cases that are dismissed can involve motions and other matters that need to be 
resolved by the court’s Appellate Commissioner and Motions Department, described below. 
  
Cases are generally assigned to a department on a random basis. Each department hears oral arguments on an average of two to three days each 
month; oral arguments are heard year-round. In addition, the court has periodically scheduled additional oral argument days to consider expedited 
cases, those matters that the Legislative Assembly or the court has determined require accelerated consideration. Primary among those cases are 
appeals involving juvenile dependency and termination of parental rights, and judicial review proceedings of decisions of the Land Use Board of 
Appeals. 

he Court of Appeals recently changed its rules to make remote argument the default for oral arguments. Parties are allowed to request in-person oral 

argument, and cases generally will be set for in-person argument if all parties confer and agree or if each party independently requests that oral 
argument be held in person. Although remote oral arguments offer many advantages, a primary reason for making remote arguments the default was 
equity. The Court of Appeals is a statewide court, and the parties to appeals and their lawyers hail from all parts of Oregon. Remote arguments ensure 
that geography does not impose disparate costs on litigants and lawyers nor deter lawyers from pursuing an appellate practice in more distant 
communities across the state. 

efore oral argument, all three judges assigned to hear the cases read the parties’ briefs, perform whatever preliminary legal research may be in 

order, and meet together to discuss the case in a pre-argument conference. Following oral argument, the judges reevaluate the case in a post-argument 
conference in light of the parties’ oral advocacy and review the record of the case as appropriate. If, based on all those considerations, each of the 
three judges agrees that (1) none of the arguments by the parties will result in the decision below being vacated, reversed, or modified; and (2) a

written opinion would not benefit the parties, bench, or bar, then the department will issue a decision affirming the ruling on appeal or review without 
opinion (AWOP). Such decisions normally are issued within a few weeks of oral argument. 
  
For matters in which the three judges do not agree that an unwritten disposition would be appropriate, the presiding judge of the department assigns 
the case for preparation of a written opinion, which can be designated as precedential or nonprecedential based on the factors set forth in the 
amendments to the Oregon Rules of Appellate Procedure. Once prepared, the draft is circulated to the other judges of the department and the Chief 
Judge, and the proposed decision is discussed at a regularly scheduled conference that the Chief Judge also attends. As noted above, once the 
department has agreed on a disposition for the case, which may or may not include a concurring or dissenting opinion by one of the department’s 
judges, the final draft of the opinion is circulated to all the other judges so they will have an opportunity to seek to refer the case for consideration by 
the full court. All cases considered by the full court are discussed at the full court conference. This typically occurs in cases presenting more novel or 
complex issues. The court usually considers en banc cases on the original briefing and oral argument. 
  
Last year, the Court of Appeals issued 497 authored opinions. Through October of this year, and with the adoption of temporary rules allowing for 
the issuance of nonprecedential opinions in June, the court had already issued 464 authored opinions (329 precedential opinions and 135 
nonprecedential opinions). The court continues its efforts to increase efficiency and productivity and reduce its AWOP rate (which is currently 
around 40 percent), including through implementation of recommendations from the court’s internal backlog-reduction work group and by reserving 
precedential opinions for cases involving the court’s law-announcing function, as discussed above. 
  
As described earlier, the court is currently working with the National Center for State Courts to design an active caseflow management program 
using the most up-to-date techniques in appellate case management. The design phase of this project will be complete in early 2023. 
  
Internal Processes – Publication, Assessment, and Improvement  
  
The court is committed to improving communications with the bench, the bar, the other branches of government, and the public about its work. As 
part of its effort to fulfill that commitment, the court’s opinions are electronically published immediately after issuance. The Chief Judge also 
includes messages in the court's weekly media releases to inform the bar of any notable developments at the court. 
  
As described above, the court is committed to reviewing its internal practices on an ongoing basis, to improve its practices to better serve the bench, 
the bar, and the public, and it is in the midst of a grant study with the National Center for State Courts to accomplish that end. The court previously 
sponsored and supported a survey of the best practices of state intermediate appellate courts across the nation, developed performance measures for 
its work, and obtained a grant to enable the National Center for State Courts to conduct an in-depth analysis of the court’s workload. The resulting 
demonstration of need for additional judicial resources led the Legislative Assembly to add three new judges and associated staff to the court in 2013. 
The court also periodically surveys Oregon appellate lawyers and trial court judges to obtain their views regarding the court’s performance.

 Appellate eCourt Project  
  
The Court of Appeals implemented an automated case management system in 2008, a key component of the Chief Justice’s vision for an “electronic 
courthouse.” That system now includes electronic filing, payment, case management, and document management. Litigants generally file and serve 
briefs and other documents electronically. In addition, the system allows the court to process cases without handling traditional hard copies of 
appellate briefs and other documents. Members of the court’s merits panels routinely prepare for oral argument and decision by accessing 
electronically filed briefs and related submissions. The court also uses electronic versions of trial court records, exhibits, and transcripts as part of the 
case review and opinion preparation process. A 2016 upgrade to the system permits some remote access, by certain subscribers, to non-confidential 
appellate case file documents. Beginning in 2017, the court began exploring a further upgrade to transition the court to the most recent version of the 
vendor provided software and to help ensure long-term sustainability of the system and provide access to newer product features. The court is 
currently in the process of upgrading to the vendor’s most recent version of its case management system with a scheduled implementation in late 
2023. 
  
Appellate Commissioner's Office  
  
The Appellate Commissioner’s Office was established in 2008 and has substantially reduced the amount of time it historically has taken for 
substantive motions in the Court of Appeals to be decided. Pursuant to statute, the commissioner has authority to decide motions, own motion 
matters, and cost and attorney fees matters arising from cases not decided by a department but is not authorized to decide any appeal on its 
substantive merits. Parties may seek reconsideration of a decision of the commissioner, resulting in review of the decision by either the Chief Judge 
or the Motions Department of the Court of Appeals. Since its inception and implementation, this initiative has been highly successful in eliminating 
procedural bottlenecks in the appellate process, expediting prompt disposition of thousands of matters. 
  
Special Programs  

•  Appellate Settlement Conference Program – The Court of Appeals has continued to utilize its highly effective mediation program, 

which has allowed parties to resolve cases on a mutual rather than judicial basis. The program resolves civil, domestic relations, workers’ 
compensation, probate, juvenile dependency, and criminal matters – cases that are frequently among the most complex that the court 
would otherwise consider.  

•  School Program – Before the pandemic, when the budget allowed for it, the Oregon Court of Appeals judges and staff would travel 

around Oregon to hear oral arguments in school settings and talk with high school and college students and community groups about the 
court’s work and about Oregon’s justice system. The program was restarted in 2013 after a two-year hiatus prompted by budget 
considerations. Overall, since 1998, the court has held oral arguments at schools, universities, and local courts in more than 60 locations 
throughout the state. A panel of three judges and a staff person work with the schools and local courts and bar associations to schedule the

trips. The judges meet with students who attend the arguments to discuss the appellate process and the court’s work. The students can read 
the briefs and court-provided summaries of the cases. They discuss them in class before the court arrives, integrating the court’s visit into 
their social studies curriculum. The court put this program on hold during the COVID-19 pandemic but anticipates restarting some version 
of its school program soon, including considering how to use remote meeting technology to connect with schools across the state.

Tax Court 

he Oregon Tax Court is a trial court with exclusive jurisdiction in all cases arising under Oregon state tax laws. State tax laws include personal and 

corporate income taxes, which provide the largest source of General Fund revenue; property taxes to fund local government; the corporate activity 
tax adopted in 2019 to fund education; and numerous taxes on timber, tobacco, marijuana, and other transactions and activities. These taxes touch the 
lives of all Oregonians and contribute operating funds to every level of state and local government.  

he Legislature created the Tax Court in 1961 as the nation’s first judicial branch state tax court. The Legislature’s goals were to provide all 

Oregonians with a fair, accessible, and specialized forum to resolve state tax disputes. The court’s placement within the judicial branch enables it to 
apply the law impartially to taxpayers and taxing authorities. The court makes itself accessible by working with parties to hold proceedings by remote 
means and at agreed times; by providing instructional videos, manuals, and training sessions on how to use the court; and by making staff available to 
help taxpayers and government employees navigate the court’s processes. The court maintains its tax expertise by participating in seminars sponsored

by the Oregon State Bar Taxation Section, the Oregon CPA society, and national bar and judicial groups. The court believes its adherence to the 
Legislature’s founding goals helps to promote public confidence in Oregon’s tax system. 

APPELLATE AND TAX COURTS 

o further the development of the law, in nearly every decided case the Tax Court explains its reasoning and posts the decision on the Oregon 

Judicial Department’s publications page. Selected opinions are also published in the official Oregon Tax Reports. The court believes that easy access 
to its decisions promotes transparency and helps taxpayers and taxing agencies better conform their actions to the law. [ADD information about the 
court’s efforts to create materials to assist SRLs?] 

n 1995, the Legislature abolished the Department of Revenue’s administrative hearing process and created the Magistrate Division within the Tax 
Court to provide the first level of court review of taxing agency actions. Examples of typical cases include challenges to annual property tax 
assessments and disputes over the results of income tax audits. The statutes allow an informal process that achieves substantial justice with simplified 
procedural rules, without juries, and without requiring parties to use attorneys. In most cases, one or both parties are not represented by a lawyer. 
Many cases settle through informal case management conferences that magistrates convene one or more times during the appeal process. The statutes 
also authorize magistrates to mediate cases, and they offer that service as an alternative to trial. Magistrates decide remaining cases by trial or by 
dispositive motion. The Magistrate Division resolves the great majority of cases without any further appeal; parties may appeal a magistrate’s 
decision to the Regular Division. The Magistrate Division consists of three magistrates and five legal and administrative personnel.  

agistrate Division 

egular Division 

he Regular Division hears (1) appeals from Magistrate Division decisions, (2) cases that the Regular Division transfers from the Magistrate 
Division before trial (typically, cases in which the parties already have legal representation and request the transfer), and (3) a small number of 
original jurisdiction cases, such as declaratory judgment and mandamus actions. The Regular Division follows rules based on the Oregon Rules of 
Civil Procedure; it is a court of record, does not use juries, and generally has the powers of a circuit court sitting in equity. Decisions can be appealed 
to the Oregon Supreme Court on direct review. The Regular Division has one judge, who is elected statewide. The judge serves as the court’s 
administrative authority and appoints magistrates. In addition to the judge, the Regular Division consists of one law clerk and the court’s overall 
administrator. 

Workload and Types of Cases 

he Magistrate Division has received, on average, approximately 400 new cases annually since 2016. Filings exceeded the average in 2020 (404) and 

2021 (410) and are on pace to significantly exceed the average in 2022. Much of the recent increase is in property tax appeals involving the value of

commercial property. The court anticipates a further increase in coming years as taxpayers begin to appeal assessments of the corporate activity tax, a 
unique new tax that applies to more than 20,000 businesses and raises approximately $1 billion per year. The Department of Revenue is completing 
its audits of the first set of corporate activity tax returns, which began to be filed in 2021.  

istorically, the Tax Court’s caseload has correlated with changes in the law and changes in the economy. Soon after the Magistrate Division began 
to operate, in 1997, the property tax limitation laws, collectively known as Measure 50, precipitated a long-term decline in appeals. Measure 50 has 
generally lowered and capped the value at which property is assessed for taxation, making tax bills less sensitive to increases in market value and 
reducing the incentive to appeal. Responding to the declining docket, by 2012 the Tax Court reduced the number of magistrates from six to three, 
with corresponding reductions in other staff. Since 2016, the annual number of new appeals has ranged between 363 and 410. 

n the two-year period ending June 30, 2022, 930 appeals were filed, 648 involving property tax and 282 involving income or other tax. The average 
time between a case filing date and the date of the decision was approximately 7.4 months. Forty-one cases decided in the Magistrate Division were 
appealed to the Regular Division. Of those cases, 19 have been closed by the Regular Division. As of June 30, 2022, there were 245 active cases 
pending in the Magistrate Division.

ecause of its unique role, the Tax Court maintains regular contact with its principal constituencies, including the Department of Revenue and the 
department’s attorneys in the Department of Justice; the Oregon State Bar Taxation Section; the Oregon State Association of County Assessors; the 
Oregon County Counsel Association; and the Oregon CPA society. The court hosts an annual meeting of stakeholders to consider new court rule 
proposals, and its judicial officers regularly speak at stakeholder conferences. The court gives guest lectures several times each year in tax classes at 
Oregon law schools and the Portland State University Master’s in Taxation program for CPAs. Each year, the court hosts and trains several Oregon 
law student externs, some of whom go on to practice Oregon tax law.  

ecent Legislation Affecting the Tax Court 

he Legislature has, at OJD’s request, taken several recent actions to improve the Tax Court’s processes. In 2019, the Legislature modernized the 

court’s statute governing filing of complaints by mail and courier services, which helps self-represented taxpayers who live far from the court’s 
location in Salem. The 2021 Legislature reduced the statutory filing fee in the Magistrate Division from $281 to $50. Most recently, in 2022, the 
Legislature authorized funding for a law clerk position within the Magistrate Division, in anticipation of an increase in filings as the Department of 
Revenue completes its initial audits under the corporate activity tax.  

Appellate Court Services Division 

he Appellate Court Services Division (ACSD) has two sections that provide specialized administrative support activities to the Oregon Supreme 
Court, Court of Appeals, and Office of the State Court Administrator (OSCA). The sections are Appellate Court Records Section and the State of 
Oregon Law Library (which includes Publications). The specialized functions for each section are as follows: 

•  Appellate Court Records Section:  The Appellate Court Records Section (ACRS) is the case processing center for both the Supreme 
Court and the Court of Appeals. It is responsible for processing all documents filed with either appellate court, including petitions, 
appeals, motions, briefs, notices, and correspondence. ACRS manages transcripts filed in appeals, calendars oral arguments, prepares and 
issues administrative orders and appellate judgments, and is responsible for all archival activities for both appellate courts. ACRS also 
supports the continued improvement of the Appellate Case Management System (ACMS) and Appellate eCourt (including components 
such as eFiling). It also serves as the appellate clerk’s office for lawyers, litigants, and the public.  

•  State of Oregon Law Library:  The State of Oregon Law Library serves as a principal legal research center for the Oregon appellate and 
trial courts, tax court, executive branch agencies, and citizens. The library is open to the public, does not charge for its services, and 
provides a variety of services to lawyers and lay patrons. It is funded mainly through an agency assessment. Within the State of Oregon 
Law Library, the Publications program publishes, in print and electronic format, and markets, in print format, the decisions of the

appellate courts. The program works with the appellate judicial chambers to format court opinions, decisions, and orders regarding rules 
amendments for publication on the library website, utilizing the Department of Administrative Services Publishing and Distribution 
Center to print and distribute advance sheets, and Lynx Group, Inc. to produce and distribute bound volumes. This program also provides 
desktop publishing services to OJD.

In conjunction with a grant-funded study by the National Center for State Courts, the Court of Appeals (COA) is redesigning its workflow 
management processes to improve time to disposition and the transparency of its decision-making. The COA's benchmark for deciding most 
types of cases is 180 days from submission, and it meets that benchmark in only 80 percent of its cases. However, in order to do so, the court 
resorts to the practice of affirming without opinion (AWOP) in at least 40 percent of its decisions. The AWOP practice does not provide a 
reasoned explanation to the parties involved and is inconsistent with best practices for procedurally fair opinions and risks undermining public 
confidence in the court's decisions (see Hon. Roy McLeese III, Trying to Write Fair Opinions, 27th Annual Brennan Lecture on State Courts 
and Social Justice (Institute of Judicial Administration at NYU School of Law, October 25, 2022)).  

To improve the number of cases that can be heard by the Court of Appeals (COA), reduce the time to disposition of those cases and reduce 
the practice of affirming without opinion, the COA is requesting additional resources for implementation of a new managed workflow process 
for cases. The redesigned workflow process will involve screening, weighting, and equitable distribution of case assignments, as well as the 
work performed before cases are submitted for argument ("frontloading"). Additionally, the Supreme Court has identified a need for 
additional legal staff support on opinion, motions, case resolutions, and non-case related issues (e.g., bar and rules committees, and self-
represented litigant process matters).

TRIAL COURTS 

Trial Courts 

he Trial Court operations program is the Oregon Judicial Department’s (OJD) largest program and includes the resources for operating the state trial 

courts – known as circuit courts – in every Oregon county. The circuit courts adjudicate matters and disputes in criminal, civil, landlord-tenant, 
collections, domestic relations, traffic, juvenile, violations, abuse prevention and other protective orders, probate, mental commitments, adoption, and 
guardianship cases. 

he state is divided into 27 judicial districts encompassing all 36 counties. There is a circuit court in each county, with a statewide total of 179 circuit 

court judges. Pursuant to ORS 1.003, the Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court appoints presiding judges for each judicial district for 
administrative purposes for two-year terms. Their general authority is described in ORS 1.171. Operations of the trial courts are managed by trial 
court administrators who are supervised by the presiding judge. The general authority of a trial court administrator is described in ORS 8.225. Their 
duties include personnel administration, budget and financial management, court operations, maintaining the court record, and jury management. 

here are also several legislatively mandated local committees that presiding judges and trial court administrators must either initiate or attend. These 
committees include convening local criminal justice advisory committees and court security planning committees, participating in local public safety 
coordinating committees, and family law advisory committees. Judges and trial court administrators are also involved in many community activities 
and programs that align with the courts’ programs to provide services to people involved in the court system. 

regon circuit courts are trial courts of general jurisdiction, meaning the court hears cases filed for all case types, amounts of money, or severity of 
crime. In addition to handling all types of cases, the trial courts have been actively involved in both legislatively initiated and self-initiated programs 
to provide improved dispute resolution processes and outcomes for the people and cases that come before them. The courts have supported, as 
resources permit, the following types of programs: 

•  Specialty courts:  These are collaborative, community-based court programs that utilize an evidence-based, problem-solving model to 

improve outcomes for people who have mental health issues or who have substance abuse disorders. They also include courts or programs 
aimed at addressing the court-related needs of veterans, domestic violence, mental health issues, juvenile delinquency, payment of 
restitution, and providing community court services. 

•  Integrated family courts:  These courts have a single judge who is assigned to all cases involving a particular family, and local services 
are coordinated. Family issues are addressed as a unit, thus improving the family’s capabilities to succeed and improve the future of its 
children. 

•  Arbitration and mediation programs:  These programs are designed to help resolve cases, where appropriate, at lesser expense to 

litigants and in less adversarial settings, including helping to establish local community-based dispute resolution centers.

•  Domestic relations self-represented litigant service centers and websites:  These are service centers and websites where people who 

are not represented by an attorney can find out about court forms and procedures and be referred to appropriate legal and support services. 

•  Eviction Diversion Programs:  Sometimes resources are available that allow tenants to stay in their homes without causing harm to the 
landlord. Courts have been taking creative approaches to connecting tenants and landlords to the services they need to help create better 
outcomes for all involved.  

•  Centralized Child Support Docket:  Several counties are working together to improve outcomes in their jurisdictions for those who owe 

child support and the families who rely on those payments. If successful, the model can be expanded upon or replicated statewide. 

aseload Trends 

nnual case filings for 2021 totaled 493,899 cases, up 8 percent from 2020 annual case filings. The most significant reductions in case filings 

continue to be in felony, misdemeanor, violation, and juvenile case types with year over year declines.

TRIAL COURTS 

The important work that our courts can and must do to address the needs of those who were hardest hit during the pandemic, and to continue 
Oregon’s recovery from the pandemic amidst rising inflation, a tight labor market, and a public defense crisis in the coming biennium are detailed 
below. 

•  Public Defense Crisis – In many communities throughout Oregon the current demand for court appointed attorneys exceeds attorney 
capacity. To address the need to retain and hire public defense attorneys, courts can advocate for legislative funding, work with 
stakeholders and community partners to expand attorney capacity, reach out to the private bar to take cases, and develop efficiencies in 
court processes to streamline case resolution, including enlisting senior judges for settlement dockets.  

•  Housing – As eviction filings continue to increase after the pandemic moratoria, eviction may not be the best answer for landlords or 
tenants. Courts can mediate, help devise payment plans, help secure rent assistance, and connect parties with local social services to 
identify available housing options. 

•  Business – Businesses – small businesses in particular – are struggling to recover from the pandemic and as energy, labor, and supply 
costs skyrocket there will be many legal questions about whether contract obligations are enforceable. Timely and consistent decisions 
from courts can provide certainty and help ensure that all efforts are made to keep businesses afloat. 

•  Debtor/Creditor and Small Claims – People who want to pay their debts may not be able to do so. Obtaining a judgment may be of 
limited value to a creditor. Courts can work with all parties to devise payment plans and ensure that lack of representation and default 
judgments do not drive more Oregonians into unnecessary economic distress. 

•  Treatment Courts – Oregonians’ alcohol and drug consumption has increased over the last several years. Treatment courts must be 

available to serve those who need help finding a new normal and to prevent further crime and victimization. 

•  Mental Health Dockets – Many of the people in our courts have mental health challenges and many repeatedly cycle through without 
making progress. Courts must have resources to continue their work with state and local government agencies and service providers to 
find appropriate placements and take other steps necessary to close the gap in housing, services, and support systems that will help people 
stabilize and avoid further justice system involvement. 

•  Domestic Relations – Many parents’ economic and living situations have changed dramatically as everyone returns to a new normal in an 
unstable economic environment. Courts can make the adjustments to support and custody orders that are necessary to permit parents to 
adjust to new realities. 

•  Child Welfare – Court attention is needed to keep families and children safe and services continuing, as required by laws and federal 

funding agreements. 

•  Protective Orders – Sadly, restraining order requests continue to increase. Courts must be available to keep people safe.

Case filings alone are an incomplete indicator of court workload because different types of cases demand different levels of resources. Converting 
caseload into the time required to process a case is an important factor in determining the minimum level of resources courts need to effectively 
manage their caseload. Parking and other violations are the most frequent type of cases filed but are among the lowest in terms of the staff and judge 
work time it takes to adjudicate them. Felony cases are the largest proportion of workload, but they are among the lowest in case filings. The chart 
below shows that more than 55 percent of case filings (Multnomah parking and violations) account for only 10 percent of workload. Almost 90 
percent of staff workload is generated from the remaining 45 percent of case filings.

Workload and Staffing Trends 

TRIAL COURTS 

ase workloads continue to be heavy in circuit courts, even without accounting for “best practices” or other qualitative measures that might be used 

to improve outcomes for parties to court cases. In the last decade, changes affecting workload and court procedures include: 

•  The rapid shift to remote hearings and other proceedings, has dramatically altered how courts operate and deliver services; 

•  Alternatives to incarceration and increased emphasis on reformation have added case management duties to courts, requiring extra 

hearings or judicial or court staff to monitor adherence to probationary or court-ordered treatment; 

• 

• 

• 

Increased federal and state requirements, especially in the areas of juvenile and family law; 

Increased interactions with justice system partners (e.g., mental health providers); 

Increased case complexity, including increases in cases involving self-represented litigants; 

•  Legislatively mandated changes requiring systemic changes to the justice system affecting court programs, court staffing, and court 

procedures; and 

•  Reductions in county services leading to courts absorbing work traditionally done by external agencies (e.g., bench probation and 

monitoring defendants involved in treatment court). 

hen translating case filings into actual workload based on the amount of staff time needed to process a case from initiation to post-judgment 

activity, Oregon courts have not been staffed adequately to meet workload demands even as caseload has declined.  

hrough economic downturns, the global pandemic, a public defense crisis, and Oregon’s mental health crisis we have found ways to keep Oregon 
courts open and accessible. We have been able to work through our pandemic backlogs as case filings increase. We continue to innovate and adapt to 
keep up with changing technology, staffing shortages, legislative changes requiring rapid system reforms, and new expectations for the virtual 
courthouse. Our ability to continue that work will depend on adequate funding in the 2023-25 biennium.

OJD is in the midst of a multi-biennium implementation of a statewide, consistent pretrial release program to reduce the reliance on security 
release (bail), while ensuring victim and public safety. This package continues work started with the passage of SB 48 in the 2021 Legislative 
Session, and implementation of Chief Justice Orders and development of court pretrial programs. The initial roll-out provided staffing to 
counties that had no pretrial program structures prior to the passage of SB 48. This package adds staff to counties that had at least some 
infrastructure to support pretrial programs prior to the implementation of SB 48. With the initial rollout complete, OJD has been able to 
evaluate the number of release assistance officers needed in the remaining counties. The package also includes funding for system 
development and central staffing to support the program. 

Release Assistance Officer positions to be added in eleven counties (Clackamas, Clatsop, Columbia, Deschutes, Klamath, Jackson, Lane, 
Lincoln, Marion, Multnomah, and Polk).

Policy Option Package 104 – Self-Represented Litigants 

urpose  

  P

Over the past five years, 83 percent of all parties in landlord-tenant 
disputes have been self-represented. Another 71 percent are self-
represented in divorce cases. These self-represented litigants require 
special support to help them access court services. Courts are 
expanding online technology to address barriers streamlining 
processes, and simplifying form completion and filing, but more work 
needs to be done to address the needs of our diverse communities. 
Court facilitators and customer service staff inform self-represented 
litigants of court processes and available court forms, review state or 
county approved documents, and provide information about legal 
services and other resources available in the community.

Most online court resources are available in English only. Translations 
of online services and information will address the top five non-English languages encountered in Oregon’s state courts (Spanish, Russian, 
ASL, Chuukese, Vietnamese).  

Would add court resources to maintain and expand access to facilitation and customer service for the growing number of self-represented 
litigants in Clackamas, Klamath, Multnomah, and Umatilla courts.

Access to justice also requires a stable and well-trained workforce. Our court staff form the cornerstone of a well-functioning judicial system. 
OJD currently has a turnover rate of 17 percent. With each new hire, there is a need for initial training, with professional development and 
certification opportunities over time to increase the skill and expertise available within the organization.  

Community education about court services is also critical. Not only is it a necessary step to ensure that people can access court services, it is 
fundamental to public trust and confidence in the administration of justice. Courts offer online tools and in-person and virtual court services, 
but people need to know they exist!  And staff need to be prepared to meet the needs of those seeking court services. 

This package will add two central communications staff, three central training staff, and seven trainers for trial courts to cover the Central 
Valley courts, Eastern courts, North Coast courts, Northeast courts, Southwest courts, and Tri-County courts.  
 
How Achieved 

Adding communications staff and regional training resources to develop and deliver a “Clerk College” core curriculum for court staff will 
ensure consistent and reliable services across courts amidst rapid changes in technology, legislation, and demands for efficient and virtual 
court services. This investment will allow OJD to maintain a talented and committed workforce that is well-equipped to serve the people in 
our communities.

Courts are reimagining how they serve their communities, and their vision requires investments in new technology and highly specialized 
staff to build and support the infrastructure for the courthouse of the future. Courts, litigants, advocates, and other system stakeholders are 
expanding their use of technology. In the last two years we have witnessed a marked increase in remote proceedings, electronic filing, 
electronic data transfers, and automation, which results in more efficient and accurate filings and faster adjudication. 

Remote proceedings reduce barriers to appearing in court and allow courts to be responsive to the diverse needs and preferences of our 
communities. Court users appreciate the convenience, equal access, fairness, and safety that remote participation provides. However, 
continuing and expanding remote proceedings requires careful planning to decide which court proceedings to hold remotely, the technology 
and equipment needed, and dedicated staff to maintain, configure, program, and support the courtroom Audio/Video systems. A typical 
remote proceeding will involve both in-person and remote participants (jurors, case parties, witnesses, attorneys, and observers) with a variety 
of technical difficulties that must be handled quickly to ensure the proceeding runs smoothly.  

Courts are also expanding web services, application development, and data integrations to support more online services to court users and 
system stakeholders and form the cornerstone of our advanced data analytics capabilities. During to the COVID pandemic, the Oregon 
Judicial Department (OJD) drastically expanded the use of remote proceeding to avoid in-person court processing. This new capability has 
resulted in significant benefits for the public, reducing barriers and allowing the courts to be more responsive to a variety of conditions. 
Support for remote proceedings has put a strain on local IT staff, especially in larger courts. This package will address the need for more IT 
staff to ensure that remote proceedings can continue as case filings continue to rebound following the pandemic.  

Adds audio/video and information technology staff centrally, and in Josephine, Multnomah, and Washington counties.

Oregon communities need more judicial resources, as demonstrated by a nationally developed, validated measure of judicial workload. The 
workload data show Oregon should have an additional 36 circuit court judges to serve our communities, manage caseloads effectively, and be 
able to meet timely disposition standards. These positions are critical to improving access to justice for all Oregonians. OJD’s judicial 
workload model measures the amount of time judicial officers have available to hear cases and the amount of time it takes to hear and decide 
each type of case. The model was developed by the National Center for State Courts (NCSC) and updated in 2015. The workload data is 
updated annually to reflect average annual case filings. NCSC found that Oregon courts were “significantly under resourced, even without 
accounting for ‘best practices’ . . . used to improve outcomes for parties.” 

Adding judicial resources to communities with the greatest need will help improve outcomes for timely resolution, procedural fairness, and 
ensure courts have the resources to implement best practices in case management to improve court efficiency. To begin filling the gap, OJD 
proposes to add judicial positions (with accompanying staff) in the following six circuit courts (listed in order of need): Jackson, Washington 
(2 judicial positions), Lane, Josephine, Douglas, Clackamas. 

Addition of new judges and support staff in the following counties with growing populations and increasing caseloads:  Jackson, Washington 
(two judges), Lane, Josephine, Douglas, and Clackamas. New staff support the judges, scheduling, courtroom operations/administration and 
case processing.

Policy Option Package 110 – Classification and Compensation Plan Changes 

TRIAL COURTS 

During the 2021-23 biennium, the Oregon Judicial Department (OJD) has undertaken a comprehensive classification and compensation study 
for all OJD employees. The study is scheduled to be completed prior to the 2023-25 biennium. This is the first system-wide review since the 
early 2000s and allows OJD to update its job classifications to reflect the increased reliance on technology, accurately represent the work 
performed and skills needed, and provide appropriate compensation for those classifications. The present classification and compensation 
system has over 140 classifications covering the 1,793 staff positions. 

OJD will report out the results of the work in the 2023 Legislative Session, including the estimated impact to the 2023-25 budget in terms of 
personal services, since the package presently only has a $1 placeholder amount entered.

A Family Treatment Court (FTC) is a multidisciplinary, evidence-based, problem-solving model serving child-welfare-involved families 
where parental substance use is a factor contributing to abuse or neglect. Investments have been made during the 2021-23 biennium in FTCs 
in eight counties and for centralized support positions. Central program staff provide statewide coordination to promote best practices 
supporting safe and stable family reunification within mandatory federal timelines. Program staff also establish resources to provide ongoing 
training and technical assistance to local Family Treatment Court Teams, as well as the development and implementation of structured 
program evaluation, outcome measurement, and data reporting protocols. The Statewide Family Treatment Court Coordinator promotes 
consistency across Oregon’s FTCs to provide equal access to justice, ensures adherence to research-based best practice recommendations, and 
facilitates collaboration with system partners through the multi-agency Family Treatment Court Advisory Committee. This package continues 
investments in additional family treatment courts in Oregon and central positions currently being supported through a federal grant. 

Funds would continue support for central program staff after federal grant funding expires in 2023 and provide dedicated and trained pro tem 
judicial resources for four new family treatment courts (Benton, Polk, Clackamas, and Josephine).  

NOTE:  The September 2022 Emergency Board provided funding and positions for new family treatment courts in Benton, Polk, Clackamas, 
and Josephine counties and for staff for Wasco and Klamath counties. The Oregon Judicial Department will provide a modified policy option 
package during the 2023 session totaling $0.83 million.

Oregon’s 66 specialty courts serve over 2,000 participants annually. Since 1991, these courts have been an integral part of the justice system, 
promoting public safety through court-directed supervision and intensive treatment for high-risk/high-need individuals with substance use or 
behavioral health issues. Specialty courts prove that providing supervision, structure and evidence-based treatment is a far more successful 
approach to substance use and mental health disorders than punishment or incarceration alone. In several courts around the state, staffing 
shortfalls are inhibiting operations of the specialty courts in the communities they serve. This package requests additional Specialty Court 
Coordinators for these unstaffed or understaffed specialty courts. 

pecialty Court Coordinators are the conduit between the court, participants, and community partners, ensuring access to treatment and 

connection to services. Coordinators are necessary to comply with the research-based Oregon Specialty Court Standards by ensuring that each 
local team is adhering to best practices. They provide training and technical assistance to local teams, and implement consistent data 
collection and reporting, outcome measurement, and evaluation. 

Adds staff to support new, understaffed, or unstaffed specialty courts in Baker, Clackamas, Clatsop, Columbia, Coos, Crook, Douglas, Hood 
River, Josephine, Lane, Lincoln, Malheur, Tillamook, and Yamhill counties.

Specialty Court Coordinators are OJD employees currently funded through biennial CJC grant funds. This funding process requires 
significant administrative work in applying for and managing the grant, contributes to instability and inconsistencies within specialty courts, 
and makes it difficult to recruit and retain coordinators. The current funding process diverts valuable resources to administrative tasks and 
away from the critical work of treatment court coordination and best practice implementation.  

Direct funding of coordinator positions enables CJC to fund essential participant services like housing, uninsured treatment, and culturally 
specific services which have all increased in cost and complexity and decreased in availability and accessibility. Many of the 66 specialty 
courts located across the state are funded through grants provided by Criminal Justice Commission (CJC). Of the funding provided, only a 
portion of the grants fund coordinators for the Oregon Judicial Department (OJD). While many of the grants and specialty courts have existed 
for multiple biennia, the positions are limited duration and this creates an impact in retaining quality, trained coordinators in these positions. 
Experienced coordinators are vital in supporting the judge and court functions and managing the needs of court participants and the multi-
disciplinary teams that participate in specialty courts.  

OJD is requesting General Fund for the coordinator staff in the specialty courts that are supported through CJC grants. The funding, which is 
General Fund in nature, instead of flowing though CJC would finance permanent positions for the existing staff that are supporting the 
specialty courts. This would reduce paperwork and billings across agencies and provide stable funding to help retain staff.

The Oregon Judicial Department (OJD) receives a number of grants, both internal and external to state government. The department requires 
expenditure limitation and limited-duration positions to execute the grant funding. Even though these limited duration positions expire with 
the start of a new biennium, many grants are continuously renewed and OJD must request these same positions each biennium. Additionally, 
OJD operates a Legal Resource Center at the Multnomah County circuit court through an intergovernmental agreement with Multnomah 
County that requires limited duration positions and Other Fund limitation.  

ow Achieved 

OJD requests limitation and a number of limited-duration positions to spend grant funds for a variety of programs. A majority of the grants 
fund specialty and treatment courts, sometimes multiple types, in most Oregon counties, but also includes positions for the Multnomah 
County Circuit Court Legal Resource Center. The positions normally paid for out of grant funds are for the employees coordinating the efforts 
of the programs and are usually tied directly to the programs themselves.

Administration and Central Support 

Office of the State Court Administrator 

he Office of the State Court Administrator (OSCA) provides the central infrastructure and services needed to operate Oregon’s circuit courts, the 
Tax Court, Court of Appeals, and Oregon Supreme Court. The State Court Administrator (SCA) position in the Oregon Judicial Department (OJD) 
was first statutorily created by the 1971 Legislative Assembly. The duties of the SCA are established and defined primarily in ORS chapter 8; 
however, a wide variety of other statutes assign additional responsibilities. The position supports and assists the Chief Justice in exercising 
administrative authority and supervision over the circuit, tax, and appellate courts of this state and in establishing and managing statewide 
administrative policies and procedures for OJD as both an entity and a branch of state government. In this capacity, the SCA supervises 
administration of OJD’s central business and infrastructure services for the court system such as budget, accounting, revenue/collections, 
procurement, human resources, legal, internal audit, public information, data analysis, education and outreach, statewide forms and materials, 
business continuity planning, and information technology. 

he SCA promotes the efficient use of statewide resources to develop innovative court programs and services, judicial and staff education, program 
evaluation, and internal controls. In addition to administration and program development, the SCA is responsible for the long-range planning for the 
future needs of the courts. This includes adequate staffing and judicial resources, safe court facilities, secure information technology systems, 
equitable compensation for staff and judges, and a fully funded court system. Most importantly, the SCA fosters a culture of community engagement 
and public service with equity and access to justice as leading principles. 

Divisions and Program Sections 

xecutive Services Division 

he Executive Services Division (ESD) serves as the central administrative and governance coordination hub for OSCA. This division provides 
specific direct services and central executive coordination for the SCA in overall OJD administration, and with other state agencies, the Legislature, 
public, and other external organizations. This division includes the Office of General Counsel and Marshal’s Office, and administers several program 
areas for the branch, including internal audit; communications; legislative relations; strategic planning; program coordination; and equity, diversity, 
and inclusion. In addition to the SCA, the Division includes several executive leadership positions that help coordinate between the various program 
and operational areas: Deputy SCA, Assistant Deputy SCA for Operations, and Assistant Deputy SCA for Court Programs and Innovations.

uvenile and Family Court Programs Division  

he Juvenile and Family Court Programs Division (JFCPD) develops, implements, and evaluates juvenile and family court programs for statewide 

application in the courts. Programs are aimed at providing consistent and accurate information and tools to help navigate the court system and 
improve effectiveness and timeliness in the operating procedures of the courts in the juvenile and family law areas. JFCPD develops and delivers 
training and education for judges, OJD staff, and juvenile and family court system stakeholders at all levels. The division includes the following 
juvenile and family programs: 

•  Citizen Review Board Program – In 1985, Oregon’s legislature created a statewide foster care review program of citizen volunteers to 

help courts ensure that case plans and services are in place to meet the needs of children and families involved in the foster care system. 
Placed by statute in the state judicial branch under the direction of the Oregon Supreme Court, it operates independently of the state’s 
foster care system and provides an independent, diverse, and common-sense perspective to foster care cases. Currently, there are 59 
boards in 33 of Oregon’s 36 counties and approximately 250 volunteers serving on them statewide. The program recruits and trains the 
local volunteers and coordinates the operation of the local boards.  

•  Juvenile Court Dependency Program – The Juvenile Court Dependency Program is partially funded by a federal Juvenile Court 

Improvement Program (JCIP) grant that works to improve court practices in child abuse and neglect cases. Activities under the federal 
grant require ongoing collaboration with the Department of Human Services, Office of Public Defense Services, Department of Justice, 
statewide Court Appointed Special Advocate programs, tribes, and other child welfare stakeholders. The program is responsible for

collection and distribution of juvenile court statistics on a statewide basis and performing high-level liaison work to develop and evaluate 
policies, procedures, and laws affecting juvenile court operations statewide. Juvenile court dependency program staff develop and deliver 
education programs for judges, OJD staff, CRB volunteer board members, and stakeholders in the child welfare system.  

•  Family Dependency Treatment Court Program – The Family Treatment Court program’s focus is to identify and implement best practices, 

facilitate collaboration among system partners, increase access and participation to family treatment courts and provide ongoing 
evaluation and continuous quality improvement to existing treatment courts. It is guided by a statewide Family Treatment Court advisory 
committee and is dedicated to improving the well-being of families, reducing the length of time children spend in foster care, and 
increasing the rate at which children reunify with their parents. 

•  Juvenile Delinquency Improvement Program – The Juvenile Delinquency Improvement Program is modeled after the successful court 
improvement process in the dependency system. It expands training, resource development, and support for courts, stakeholders, and 
community partners as they work to improve Oregon’s delinquency system. In 2022, the program organized a statewide juvenile justice 
summit, attended by over 140 juvenile justice system stakeholders. 

•  Family Law Program – The family law program provides education, support, and assistance to judges and staff on family law matters 

including probate, protective proceedings, mediation, and domestic violence issues. The program evaluates policies, procedures, and laws 
and makes recommendations to improve access to court services for Oregon families. It also provides staff and support for the statutory 
State Family Law Advisory Committee (SFLAC), a multi-disciplinary group that advises the Chief Justice on family law matters and 
provides technical assistance and support to family law facilitators who assist unrepresented parties involved in domestic relations 
proceedings in the trial courts. 

•  Guardianship & Conservatorship Improvement Program – Initially funded through an Administration on Community Living (ACL) grant, 
this program provides courts with centralized resources that raise and standardize local circuit court monitoring of protective proceedings. 
The program improves data collections processes, provides training and tools to probate judges and staff, and delivers financial auditing 
oversight of conservatorship activity. The financial auditing component is critical to holding fiduciaries accountable to their statutory 
responsibilities. This program educates, trains, and offers subject matter expertise to courts for efficiency and confidence to fulfill its 
ongoing obligation to provide oversight. It also provides support to the Working Interdisciplinary Network of Guardianship Stakeholders 
(WINGS) to improve the state’s spectrum of guardianship/conservatorship services and processes. 

•  Centralized Child Support Program – In 2021, the Oregon Legislature authorized a position for a centralized child support referee to hear 
and resolve cases eligible for services under Title IV-D of the Social Security act, together with additional investments for services to 
families in need of judicial intervention in child support matters. Child support cases can be time consuming and high stakes, particularly 
for families in need. Focused specialization fosters prompt resolution and consistency in outcomes. The federal government will

reimburse 66 percent of the cost of such subordinate judicial officers to expedite resolution of support and parentage issues under Title 
IV-D of the Social Security Act. Planning for implementation is ongoing, and the centralized docket will launch February 1, 2023.  

 

Civil and Criminal Programs Division 

he Civil and Criminal Programs Division (CCPD) coordinates policy analysis, program development, and implementation guidance in the areas of 
civil and criminal law. CCPD also provides program evaluation, technical support and training, statewide forms development, and legislative support. 
Major programs and initiatives for criminal law include pretrial release, behavioral health, jury coordination, records integrity, and specialty courts 
such as drug treatment and mental health courts. Major program and initiatives for civil law include appropriate alternative dispute 
resolution/mediation programs for civil, small claims and landlord tenant case types, and support for self-represented litigants. 
 

Criminal Programs 

•  Pretrial Release – Passed in 2021, SB 48 replaces presumptive security schedules with Chief Justice guidelines describing which 

defendants are subject to release on recognizance or conditional release, and which are to be held until arraignment or first appearance 
before a judge. Local presiding judge release orders (PRO’s) in each judicial district implement the Chief Justice guidelines by providing 
directives to the sheriff in lieu of security schedules. When SB 48 was adopted, most counties did not have pretrial programs. OJD is 
establishing pretrial release programs in the counties that did not have one, as well as working to provide consistent pretrial release 
services in the counties that did have pretrial programs prior to enactment of SB 48. Projects underway include training of release 
assistance officers, designing and implementing business processes to support data collection and reporting, configuration of a statewide 
case management system, and implementation of a statewide risk assessment tool. In addition, the Criminal Justice Advisory Committee’s 
(CJAC) Pretrial subcommittee is evaluating crime categorization for bias crimes and additional processes to support statewide 
consistency.  

•  Fines and Fees – OJD continues to examine the impact of fines and fees, develop best practices for their imposition, and take affirmative 

steps to ensure that they do not create unnecessary barriers or disproportionate outcomes. Championed by CJAC’s Fines and Fees 
subcommittee, OJD sponsored HB 2176 (2021) removes the minimum fee amount for a person to establish a payment plan with the court 
and allows the Chief Justice to direct (rather than permit) courts to waive or suspend the payment plan fee in certain cases, and HB 4120 
(2022) allows the court to reduce the minimum fine in violation cases when the court determines that justice requires a reduction. Chief 
Justice Orders adopted in 2021 and 2022 reduced payment plan fees and allow courts to waive payment plan fees. Effective August 2022, 
Uniform Trial Court Rule 4.120 establishes a process for a person to file a post-judgment motion to modify fines and fees (except 
compensatory fines and restitution) in criminal cases.

ADMINISTRATION AND CENTRAL SUPPORT 

•  Behavioral Health – Oregon is currently experiencing a behavioral health crisis that has substantially increased the number of defendants 
who are unable to aid and assist in their own defense and has strained the Oregon State Hospital (OSH) and other system partners. The 
Behavioral Health Advisory Committee (BHAC) and its staff have been working actively with system partners to clarify roles, identify 
gaps in services, and improve processes. Staff have developed tools and resources for courts, including an electronic dashboard of aid and 
assist data. OJD’s 2022 Behavioral Health Summit had over 500 attendees. The Multidisciplinary Civil Commitment Workgroup is 
undertaking a comprehensive review of Oregon’s civil commitment statutes, with the intention of proposing legislation in 2025.  

•  Court Records Integrity Pilot Program – For someone looking to clear their criminal history and improve their chances at success, seeking 
an expungement is a monumental and expensive task. One of the most significant underlying issues in modernizing our expungement 
system is the state’s criminal records system itself – a mix of paper and digital records, inconsistently coded and varying by county. This 
pilot program was developed to address the issues that make the expunction process cumbersome for the public and labor intensive for 
courts. The primary goal is to simplify the process, identify opportunities for automation, and to design policies and data integration to 
support automation and maximize efficiency.  

•  Specialty Courts – Oregon’s 66 specialty courts serve over 2,000 participants annually. Since 1991, these courts have been an integral part 

of the justice system, promoting public safety through court-directed supervision and intensive treatment for high-risk/high-need 
individuals with substance use or behavioral health issues. BHAC’s Specialty Court subcommittees guide data collection and initiatives to 
support quality assurance adherence to best practices. In 2020, specialty courts adopted SCMS, a statewide case management system that 
enabled the creation of a data dashboard and performance measures. Current projects include multidisciplinary Veterans Treatment Court 
assessment and strategic planning and implementation of a universal screening tool for participant qualification.  

Civil Programs 

•  Alternative Dispute Resolution – This program supports courts and litigants through tools and resources aimed at improving access to 

alternative dispute resolution/mediation in domestic relations and civil cases. Initiatives underway include updating mediator qualification 
rules (last revision in 2005), assessing court and local program needs and resources, ensuring access to interpreter services for parties 
engaged in mediation, and using data to determine how mediation can be maximized and used more effectively.  

•  Self-Represented Litigants –This program focuses on access to court information and services for self-represented litigants, primarily in 

landlord-tenant and small claims cases.  

•  Landlord-Tenant – Circumstances created by the pandemic had dramatic impacts on people’s ability to secure and keep housing. 

Legislative actions to address this dynamic impacted the filing and processing of landlord-tenant (also known as Forcible Entry and 
Detainer (FED)) cases. Filings decreased but continued at a reduced rate as the legislature acted to reduce evictions. Courts responded by 
adding specialized notices for landlords and tenants and working to create structures to connect landlords and tenants with resources made

available during the pandemic to help people retain housing. As the state of emergency abated, case filings increased, returning to pre-
pandemic levels. Centralized staff through OSCA’s Self-Represented Litigant program support the continued development of problem-
solving dispute resolution models that offer diversion of landlord-tenant cases away from a court judgment and facilitate access to 
services for litigants to reduce the negative consequences of eviction and homelessness where possible. 

In addition to supporting courts and managing programs, CCPD provides staff support for the following committees: 

•  Chief Justice’s Criminal Justice Advisory Committee (CJAC) – This committee, comprised of judges, trial court administrators, and 
external stakeholders, advises the Chief Justice on changes to court roles, policies, processes, services, or other areas in response to 
current and future issues in the state criminal justice system for the purpose of improving the administration of justice and ensuring access 
to justice for all. Primary areas of focus include pretrial release, fines and fees, and public defense. 

•  Chief Justice’s Behavioral Health Advisory Committee (BHAC) – The BHAC, comprised of judges and trial court administrators, makes 
recommendations to the Chief Justice on best practices in case and docket management, and decision-making in matters involving court 
users with behavioral health issues. Primary areas of focus include aid and assist, mental health and specialty courts, civil commitment, 
and data collection and analysis.

OJD is in the midst of a multi-biennium implementation of a statewide, consistent pretrial release program to reduce the reliance on security 
release (bail), while ensuring victim and public safety. This package continues work started with the passage of SB 48 in the 2021 Legislative 
Session, and implementation of Chief Justice Orders and development of court pretrial programs. The initial roll-out provided staffing to 
counties that had no pretrial program structures prior to the passage of SB 48. This package adds staff to counties that had at least some 
infrastructure to support pretrial programs prior to the implementation of SB 48. With the initial rollout complete, OJD has been able to 
evaluate the number of release assistance officers needed in the remaining counties. The package also includes funding for system 
development and central staffing to support the program. 

ow Achieved 

Release Assistance Officer positions to be added in eleven counties (Clackamas, Clatsop, Columbia, Deschutes, Klamath, Jackson, Lane, 
Lincoln, Marion, Multnomah, and Polk), and two central positions to support the statewide pretrial case management system and risk 
assessment tool. Also contains $1.7 million to develop and support roll-out of statewide release tracking system and risk assessment tool.

The purpose of this package is to continue and expand program monitoring of protective proceedings in circuit courts. The Oregon Judicial 
Department (OJD) received a two-year Federal Administration on Community Living grant in 2021 to pilot a guardianship and 
conservatorship improvement program. The program provides courts with central resources to help standardize local circuit court monitoring 
of protective proceedings. The program also improves data collection processes, provides training and tools to probate judges and staff, and 
delivers financial auditing oversight of conservatorship activity. Oregon courts average close to 2,200 protective proceeding cases per year 
and many of these cases are open for more than five years which creates oversight issues. Courts currently monitor over $1.2 billion in assets 
on these cases.  

Continuation and expansion of this program will build and implement reliable processes for case review and assist with the examination of 
conservators’ management of funds. The financial auditing component is critical to holding fiduciaries accountable to their statutory 
responsibilities. Better financial oversight should reduce the risk of mismanagement, misappropriation, and abuse. OJD is proposing creating 
permanent centralized staff for monitoring and creating processes and training to identify financial abuse and mismanagement, to standardize

Too frequently, people who have made significant positive change in their lives face barriers that make complete reformation difficult. 
Advocates and legislatures are increasingly calling on courts to ensure that individuals have an opportunity to clear their records once they 
have taken appropriate steps to become productive members of their communities. During the 2021 Legislative Session, the Oregon Judicial 
Department (OJD) received one-time funds to partner with the Governor’s Office to begin expungement efforts on low-level marijuana 
offenses. This work is on-going and has highlighted the value of a centralized expungement and set-aside program. Annual petitions for 
expungement have increased fourfold in the last year and we expect that trend to continue. To ensure equitable and efficient processing of 
expungement for qualified individuals and address the increased volume of motions for relief by automating processes (where possible) and 
prioritizing expedited processing when motions for relief are granted, OJD is requesting creation of a permeant expungement processing 
program with dedicated resources.

of your communities.

Over the past five years, 83 percent of all parties in landlord-tenant 
disputes have been self-represented. Another 71 percent are self-
represented in divorce cases. These self-represented litigants require 
special support to help them access court services. Courts are expanding 
online technology to address barriers, streamline processes and simplify 
form completion and filing, but more work needs to be done to address the 
needs of our diverse communities. Most online court resources are 
available in English only. Translations of online services and information

state courts (Spanish, Russian, ASL, Chuukese, Vietnamese).

Over the last two decades, the Oregon Judicial Department (OJD) has moved into an online environment with court documents and processes 
contained in Oregon Judicial Case Information Network. This has required all OJD employees and judges to have multiple technology assets 
and expanded the use of computer kiosks, maintained by the department for use by the public. With nearly 2,000 employees and judges, the 
department maintains more than 2,500 PCs, along with monitors and other support equipment. During the 2021 Legislative Session, the 
department received an increase of $1.7 million that improved the budget for this type of equipment – from $0.9 million to $2.6 million – but 
it is still far less than the budget needed to support a normal replacement cycle.

A Family Treatment Court (FTC) is a multidisciplinary, evidence-based, problem-solving model serving child-welfare-involved families 
where parental substance use is a factor contributing to abuse or neglect. Investments have been made during the 2021-23 biennium in FTCs 
in eight counties and for centralized support positions. Central program staff provide statewide coordination to promote best practices 
supporting safe and stable family reunification within mandatory federal timelines. Program staff also establish resources to provide ongoing 
training and technical assistance to local Family Treatment Court Teams, as well as the development and implementation of structured 
program evaluation, outcome measurement, and data reporting protocols. The Statewide Family Treatment Court Coordinator promotes 
consistency across Oregon’s FTCs to provide equal access to justice, ensures adherence to research-based best practice recommendations, and

JUDICIAL COMPENSATION 

Judicial Compensation 

he Judicial Compensation budget reflects the resources available for the compensation of Oregon’s elected judicial officers. Those salaries are set 
by statute and are constitutionally protected from being reduced during a judge’s term of office. The budget provides biennial resources for the 200 
elected judicial officer positions, the number of which are specified in statute for each court: ORS 2.010 (Supreme Court – 7); ORS 2.540 (Court of 
Appeals – 13); ORS 3.012 (Circuit Court – 179); and ORS 305.452 (Tax Court – 1).  
  
The salary for elected judicial officers is established in ORS chapter 292. ORS 292.428 requires a cost-of-living (COLA) increase when one is 
authorized for management service employees in the Executive Branch. The most recent COLA went into effect on August 1, 2022. A COLA was 
also provided on December 1, 2021. There are no other increases provided to judicial officers during the last biennium, further distancing judicial 
salaries from that of other legal professionals. 

he July 2022 judicial salary survey completed by the 

National Center for State Courts (NCSC) showed that as of 
July 1, 2022, Oregon’s judicial salaries, when adjusted for 
cost of living, ranked 50th among reporting states and 
jurisdictions. Washington and California judges, the closest 
states for comparison purposes, have salaries that are 
significantly higher than Oregon judicial salaries. Oregon 
circuit court judge salaries are also low compared to 
Oregon’s state-paid attorneys, such as senior attorneys in the 
Oregon Department of Justice and those in the Office of 
Public Defense Services. See Judicial Salary Comparison 
chart showing the differences.

ow judicial salaries are contributing to a significant 

turnover on the bench and dramatically reducing the number 
of years of legal experience judges have before taking the 
bench. In 2022, OJD had one-third fewer judges with more than 15 years on the bench, and about 20 percent more judges with less than five years on 
the bench than just nine years ago. The increase in the number of new judges and decrease in overall legal experience creates real challenges for the 
administration of justice that impact our communities. This is especially true in Portland and other locations were the number of serious cases – 
particularly those associated with gun violence – have increased in the last several years. Multnomah County has resolved 21 murder cases in the last

year and has 88 more pending. Having judges on the bench who have experience with these kinds of serious cases is absolutely essential and is 
becoming harder to find. 

JUDICIAL COMPENSATION 

ow judicial salaries also decrease the likelihood of attracting and retaining a diverse bench. According to data from the U.S. Department of 

Education, the average cumulative student loan debt for law school graduates in 2016 was $145,500, and even higher for graduates who identified as 
Black or Hispanic. See “Law school debt is delaying plans for recent grads” (ABA Journal, December 1, 2020). Those who have an interest in joining 
the bench are incentivized to travel north to Washington, or South to California, where they can earn over $40,000 more per year. And those who 
establish a career in Oregon are often reluctant to join the bench because of the dramatic reduction in annual compensation.

Oregon communities need more judicial resources, as demonstrated by a nationally developed, validated measure of judicial workload. The 
workload data show Oregon should have an additional 36 circuit court judges to serve our communities, manage caseloads effectively, and be 
able to meet timely disposition standards. These positions are critical to improving access to justice for all Oregonians. OJD’s judicial 
workload model measures the amount of time judicial officers have available to hear cases and the amount of time it takes to hear and decide 
each type of case. The model was developed by the National Center for State Courts (NCSC) and updated in 2015. The workload data is 
updated annually to reflect average annual case filings. NCSC found that Oregon courts were “significantly under resourced, even without 
accounting for ‘best practices’ … used to improve outcomes for parties.” 

Adding judicial resources to communities with the greatest need will help improve outcomes for timely resolution, procedural fairness, and 
ensure courts have the resources to implement best practices in case management to improve court efficiency. To begin filling the gap, OJD 
proposes to add judicial positions (with accompanying staff) in the following six circuit courts (listed in order of need): Jackson, Washington 
(two judicial positions), Lane, Josephine, Douglas, Clackamas. 

Addition of new judges and support staff in the following counties with growing populations and increasing caseloads:  Jackson, Washington 
(two judges), Lane, Josephine, Douglas, and Clackamas. New staff support the judges, scheduling, courtroom operations/administration and 
case processing.

Oregon judges do not receive salaries that match their responsibilities or that 
compare well against their peers in other states or comparable public-sector 
attorneys in Oregon. Salaries are set in statute for elected judges in the Supreme 
Court, Court of Appeals, Tax Court, and circuit courts. Unlike staff, judicial 
salaries are not required to be based on market comparisons and judges do not 
receive merit or step increases according to a compensation plan. Although 
COLAs help keep up with inflation, they do not adjust salaries to address 
changing market conditions.

Despite much-appreciated increases in recent years, judicial salaries in Oregon 
continue to lag well behind salaries in other states, as noted in the latest survey 
conducted by the National Center for State Courts (NCSC). While Oregon’s 
salary for circuit court judges now ranks 35th nationally in absolute dollars, Oregon’s comparatively high cost of living means Oregon’s cost-
adjusted salary for circuit court judges is 50th in the country.

The Judicial Salary Comparison chart shows the difference in salaries in 2023. It demonstrates the significant and growing gap between 
judicial salaries in neighboring states and salaries for senior attorneys in Oregon’s Department of Justice (DOJ) and Office of Public Defense 
Services (OPDS).To retain our judges and to attract qualified individuals from diverse backgrounds, POP 111 establishes two 10 percent 
judicial salary increases: one on July 1, 2022, and another on January 1, 2023. These increases would provide compensation that is similar to 
the current salaries for senior attorneys in DOJ and OPDS, but still significantly less than attorneys in management roles in those agencies.

SYSTEM SUPPORT AND TECHNOLOGY FUND 

System Support and Technology Fund 

he State Court Technology Fund (SCTF) was established in 2013 to support Oregon Judicial Department (OJD) technology services. The SCTF is 
funded by a variety of sources, primarily user fee revenue from OJD technology systems, a statutory percentage of filing fees, and an allocation from 
the Criminal Fines Account. The Fund, under ORS 1.012, is statutorily dedicated for: 

•  Developing, maintaining, and supporting state court electronic applications, services, and systems; 

•  Providing access to and use of those applications, services, and systems; and 

•  Providing electronic service and filing services. 

regon’s eCourt Odyssey system provides expanded access to the courts for litigants and better access to court information for all Oregonians. The 
SCTF funds these services, but there are additional costs, including vendor charges for eFiling, vendor maintenance charges, and ongoing costs for 
technology support, testing upgrades and patches, developing interview-based forms to assist self-represented litigants, and developing business 
process reviews to promote consistency and efficiency among the courts. 

evenues 

 variety of sources provide revenue to the SCTF. Statutory filing fees, subscription and access fees paid by private sector users of the Oregon 

Judicial Case Information Network (OJCIN), and transaction fees make up the bulk of revenues into the fund. Projected revenues will not be 
sufficient to maintain current services in 2023-25. OJD has reduced costs by negotiating a flat fee for electronic filing charges (instead of a per-filing 
charge) and other measures, but technology costs continue to rise. 

ue to the revenue shortfall of $2,178,214, OJD submitted a Modified Current Service Level Budget to account for this difference. To fill the 
revenue gap, Policy Option Package 123 was created to request $2.2 million in expanded General Fund support to cover the revenue shortfall and 
provide backfill for expenditures.  

iling Fees:  The Oregon eCourt system allows litigants to electronically file court documents for cases instead of sending physical documents to the 
courthouse. To finance the cost of the electronic filing system, Oregon eCourt stakeholders and the Legislature agreed in 2013 to increase filing fees 
and direct most of the new revenue to the SCTF instead of being transferred to the General Fund. In the 2017 Legislative Session, that process was 
repeated to help cover increased eFiling usage and cover the cost of the service. In the 2019-21 biennium, filing fees generated $6.1 million and are 
expected to generate $5.5 million in 2021-23.

OJCIN User Fees:  OJD provides remote electronic access to court information by external (non-OJD) users through the Oregon Judicial Case 
Information Network (OJCIN). Instead of obtaining hard copies of case documents from court staff and obtaining limited information from the 
electronic case register, the public has free access to a more complete electronic case register and OJCIN subscribers have remote electronic access to 
case documents in case types designated as “public.” Examples of the types of data available through OJCIN include: 

•  Case details such as case number, case type, case status; 

•  Party details such as name, address, attorney; 

•  Hearing dates/times; 

•  Criminal dispositions; 

•  Civil and domestic judgment details; 

•  Case documents such as orders, motions, affidavits in public case types; 

•  Conditions of pre-trial release (in criminal cases); 

OJCIN has approximately 10,000 active users for external (non-OJD) accounts, in both the public and private sector. Users are grouped into paying 
subscribers and non-paying subscribers. 

ost public sector users receive OJCIN access at no charge and constitute about two-thirds of OJCIN subscribers. More than half of these “free 

subscribers” are publicly funded entities involved in criminal or juvenile justice, such as law enforcement agencies, adult and juvenile 
parole/probation offices, jails, district attorney offices, and lawyers providing state-paid criminal defense for indigent defendants. Other public users 
include the Department of Human Services and the Department of Justice, both of which have hundreds of users and access OJCIN information daily 
in juvenile dependency and other case types. Court Appointed Special Advocates are better able to advocate for children in dependency matters 
because OJD provides them with free access to OJCIN. Dozens of other state and local government entities can electronically access court 
documents, which creates efficiencies both for them and for court staff. The two largest OJCIN user groups use the system primarily to access 
criminal case information.  

aying subscribers include Oregon State Bar members (other than those providing indigent defense or working for public entities), news media 
organizations, title companies, housing providers, employment agencies, and background and private investigators, all using OJCIN information

daily to facilitate their work. Paying subscribers primarily consist of private-sector attorneys and law firms, as well as financial institutions, data 
resellers, real estate entities, news media, and other approved business users.  
 

 

JD’s current fee model for online access to the OJCIN system is a subscription service where users are billed based on their user type (attorney, 
private investigator, commercial, individual, data reseller, etc.), number of user profiles, and document access. User fee revenues for 2019-21 were 
$6.1 million and are projected to be $6.0 million in 2021-23. 

Pay Transaction Fees:  Oregon eCourt allows people to pay fines and fees online with a credit or debit card. This avoids a trip to the county 
courthouse or mailing in payment. During 2021, 135,083 payments were made via ePay, representing 19 percent of all receipts. OJD is charged $1.50 
per transaction to provide this service, which OJD charges to the person making the payment. Revenue from these ePay fees was $426,788 in 2019-
21 and is projected to be $440,775 in the 2021-23 biennium.

Allocation from the Criminal Fines Account:  Because of significant OJCIN use by public safety entities and due to increasing costs from 
providing public access and maintaining the statewide OJCIN system, HB 2797 (2017) was passed to authorize the SCTF to receive an allocation 
from the Criminal Fine Account (CFA). The CFA is a holding account where statutorily required fines revenue is deposited by state, municipal and 
justice courts from around Oregon. Specific allocations are designated by the Legislature for various programs across state government, with any 
remaining funds being deposited into the General Fund. The Legislature allocated $3.9 million from the CFA to the SCTF in 2019-21 and for 2021-
23.

SYSTEM SUPPORT AND TECHNOLOGY FUND 

Due to revenue levels not meeting limitation requirements, OJD submitted a Modified 2023-25 Current Service Level Budget for the Technology 
Fund that reduced expenditure levels by $2,178,214 to match expected revenues and the level of expenditures that can be supported. 

Filing Transaction Fees:  Oregon eCourt allows litigants to electronically file pleadings. The first circuit court opened to eFiling in April 2013 and 
now all OJD courts – circuit, tax, and appellate – require attorneys to eFile. To provide this service, OJD was charged $5 per eFile envelope filed in 
trial courts, excluding eFilings in criminal cases, filings by public entities, or indigent filers who have been granted a fee waiver. Approximately 60 
percent of all Odyssey filings are eFiled (approximately 1.6 million eFiled documents annually) and almost 80 percent of filing fees are paid through 
eFile (approximately $28 million in filing fees paid by eFile annually). As eFiling has become more available, both the number of eFilings and the 
amount of eFiling charges increased. To cap the total charges the State of Oregon was being charged due to increased use of this service, OJD and 
Tyler Technologies agreed to a fixed yearly rate structure, beginning in January 2018 and extending through 2025. The yearly fee for access to the 
File and Serve system is $2.78 million per year through the 2023-25 biennium.  

Pay Transaction Fees:  When using the online ePay system to pay fines, OJD is charged $1.50 per transaction (plus credit card fees separately 
billed). These transaction charges are offset by a usage fee charged to the payee. Expenditures in this category in 2019-21 were $441,823.  

ystem Support:  The SCTF pays for a variety of personnel and systems costs associated with maintenance, support, and system access for Oregon 
eCourt. Prior to establishment of the SCTF, OJD provided limited support for the older legacy Oregon Judicial Information Network (OJIN) system 
from an Other Funds limitation of the same name. The support costs and revenue from OJIN were transferred into the SCTF in the 2013-15 
biennium. The 2015 Legislature reduced overall Oregon eCourt staffing levels but added positions and resources needed to move from system 
implementation to operations. The 2017 Legislature made permanent seven positions that had been authorized as limited duration during 2015.  

or the 2023-25 biennium, the SCTF will support, in varying degrees, the salary costs of 30 positions in the Enterprise Technology Services

A modified Current Service Level budget was required to account for a revenue shortfall in the Technology Fund. Revenues for the 
Technology Fund come from an allocation from the Criminal Fines Account (CFA), user fees for OJCIN access, and filing fees revenues. 
These revenue sources are static to declining, and do not automatically increase biennium to biennium. Expenditures in the fund are 
increasing, resulting in a shortfall between anticipated revenues and expected expenditures. The Technology Fund is statutorily dedicated to 
develop, maintain, and support state court electronic applications and systems; provide public access to those systems; and provide access to 
court services and filings electronically. OJD has made it a priority to keep fees for access to court services minimal.  

The availability of tools to electronically file court documents, pay fines, submit on-line forms, and access court registers expands court 
access outside of the traditional in-person visit to a courthouse, reducing access barriers such as lost work time, childcare, transportation, 
parking costs, etc. Most online court services are free to the public, and fee waivers and deferrals are available to those who qualify so that 
filing fees aren’t a barrier to accessing justice. All government agencies and public safety entities receive free access to court registers, online 
documents, and eFile services. And Attorneys and litigants enjoy free eFile services. All of these free services ensure that court access is not a 
barrier, but increasing costs make these free services harder to support.

The Oregon Judicial Department is requesting a General Fund increase of the shortfall amount. In the past, revenue increases have required 
increases in filing fees or fines, transfers from the Criminal Fines Account, or increases in subscription fees for access to court registers and 
documents for attorneys and businesses. Increased General Fund support for the revenue shortfall in the Technology Fund would avoid these 
fee increases for access to court services.

regon Supreme Court Building 

n 2013, the Legislature approved the sale of $4.4 million in 20-year Article XI-Q bonds to support emergency repairs to the Oregon Supreme Court 
Building. The funds were used to stabilize the exterior terra cotta facing of the building and address dry rot and deterioration of the original wooden

windows. This exterior repair work was the first phase in renovating the 100-year-old Supreme Court Building. During the 2017 Legislative Session 
$6.0 million in bonding was approved for the March 2019 bond sale to start the major renovation work on the building. In 2019, the Legislature 
approved an additional $28.2 million bond sale for March 2021. The 2021 Legislative Session authorized the final sale of $21.95 million in bonds for 
March of 2023 following completion of the project, which is scheduled for November of 2022. An additional $5 million in American Rescue Plan 
Act funds were authorized for the 2021-23 biennium to support non-bondable project costs.

MANDATED PAYMENTS 

Mandated Payments 

he Mandated Payments program includes resources necessary to finance all costs associated with the administration of the trial and grand jury 
systems as governed by chapter 10 of the Oregon Revised Statutes, and federally mandated and other legislatively mandated costs found in ORS 
chapters 21, 36, 40, 45, 132, 133, and 135.  

osts associated with the Mandated Payments program generally include, but are not limited to, the following: 

•  Creation of master jury lists and other jury lists and the summoning and qualifying jurors; 

•  Providing juror orientation programs and materials; 

•  Per diem and mileage reimbursements paid to jurors at the statutory rate; 

•  Payment, when needed, of juror meals, lodging, and commercial transportation at the actual cost; 

•  Payment of fees and costs for arbitrators related to court-annexed mandatory arbitration in civil actions, when waived by the court; 

•  Payment of appellate transcript costs for a civil proceeding when a party is indigent and when waived by the court; 

•  State-paid sign language interpreters or real-time reporters for hearing-impaired jurors or other persons participating in court proceedings, 

and department activities or programs as mandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); 

•  Providing assistive devices and other equipment or supplies required to provide reasonable accommodation to disabled persons as 

mandated by the ADA; and, 

•  State-paid foreign language interpreters for court proceedings or department activities where the court or department is required by statute 
to provide an interpreter to uphold a non-English speaking person’s constitutional rights and to provide access to basic court services. 

he Mandated Payments program is an important part of our heritage of government by the people and serves as a vital function within the justice 
system by supporting the constitutional right to a trial by jury, which ensures the continuance of our democratic process through maintenance of the 
jury system and access to courts by all persons.

ORS 45.273 Policy. (1) It is declared to be the policy of this state to secure the constitutional rights and other rights of persons who are unable 
to readily understand or communicate in the English language because of a non-English-speaking cultural background or a disability, and who 
as a result cannot be fully protected in administrative and court proceedings unless qualified interpreters are available to provide assistance. 
 

Interpreter services in the courts are vital and are required to process criminal cases that involve non-English speaking defendants, witnesses or 
victims and to litigate civil actions. As the population of Oregon residents who have limited English proficiency continues to rise, the use of 
interpreting services in the courts must increase as well. The diversity of Oregon’s population increased significantly in recent years along with the 
entire United States. According to the US Census Bureau American Fact Finder, in 2018 5.8 percent of Oregon’s population identified themselves as 
limited English proficient (LEP) individuals. Over 65 percent of all Oregon LEP individuals reside in just five counties: Multnomah, Washington, 
Marion, Clackamas, and Lane.  

uring the 2023-2025 biennium, the Oregon Judicial Department (OJD) will provide interpreter services in 83,000 court proceedings in more than 
100 languages and dialects (including American Sign Language). The top ten requested languages are Spanish, Russian, American Sign Language, 
Chuukese, Vietnamese, Arabic, Somali, Mandarin, Mam, Cantonese.  

nterpreter services are delivered by OJD staff or by contract court interpreters. These activities are managed by the Court Language Access Services 
(CLAS) division to ensure quality, resource management, and to educate judges and stakeholders. CLAS supports 22 positions focused on the 
delivery and quality of interpreting, scheduling services, management of interpreter certification and education programs, and compliance with Title 
VI related to language access services.  

ourt interpreting is a high-level skill requiring more than 15 simultaneous cognitive abilities. Being bilingual, even at a high level of fluency, is not 

sufficient qualification for court interpreting. OJD certifies interpreters to ensure access to justice through rigorous testing in 22 languages. The 
Oregon court interpreting examination pass rate is less than 18 percent, confirming this demanding skill set. Once certified, interpreters are in high 
demand not only in courts but also other state and federal government services including the Department of Human Services, Department of Justice, 
administrative hearings, and U.S. Department of Homeland Security and State Department, as well as many others.  

Jury Payments 

uror fees are established by the Legislature. In a circuit court, a juror is entitled to $10 per day for the first and second day of service, then $25 per 
day for any subsequent days of service. Mileage reimbursement is $0.20 per mile to travel to jury service in the circuit court. Juror pay is subject to 
income tax but need not be reported for Social Security purposes. A juror is entitled to receive payment for a full day when the juror arrives at the

court to begin service under the summons, even if that person does not actually participate in a trial or is excused immediately after answering the roll 
call. If necessary during jury deliberations, the judge may order that food, drink, lodging, or transportation be provided to a jury depending upon the 
circumstances of the case. 

verall expenditures in this area are dictated by the number and length of jury trials and grand juries. While the COVID pandemic has impacted the 

number of in-person trials during the last three years, OJD expects more than 80,000 will Oregonians receive some level of compensation for jury 
duty in the 2023-25 biennium. The average jury per diem payment during the 2022 fiscal year averaged $14.21 per individual. 

or the 2023-25 recommended budget, Policy Option Package112 is introduced to increase juror compensation on the per day service rate and the per 

mile travel reimbursement.  

Arbitrators 

wo kinds of cases go into arbitration under state law: some civil actions involving claims for damages or money, and some family law matters.  

n a civil case, one person or business sues another person or business, usually for monetary damages. A civil case might be about costs and injuries 
from an auto accident or a disagreement about a contract. All civil cases filed in state court involving less than $50,000, except small claims cases, 
must go to arbitration. In some courts, parties can go to mediation instead of arbitration.  

tate law also requires arbitration in domestic relations or family law cases where the parties only disagree about what to do with their property and 

their debts. In some counties, the parties can also agree to arbitrate disagreements about child or spousal support. 

f a party cannot afford to pay for the cost of arbitration, the State of Oregon pays the expenses. 

ADA Compliance 

andated payments also include the costs for providing the public access to state court facilities and adherence to the Americans with Disabilities 

Act of 1990 (amended 2008). Expenditures in this area can vary greatly from biennium to biennium. Amendments to existing laws may require 
significant modifications to existing facilities to meet required specifications. Also, accommodation and access items, such as listening devices, 
periodically must be replaced due to damage or when the items reach the end of their useful life.

OJD seeks to raise juror pay from one of the lowest rates in the nation. Jury pay and mileage is set by statute and has not been updated in 
many decades. Current rates do not begin to cover the costs of a day’s loss of work, child-care, elder care, parking, transportation, food costs, 
and other financial losses incurred when individuals fulfill their required jury service duty. To make sure all Oregonians can perform this 
important civic duty without serious economic hardship, we must raise the compensation and mileage reimbursement rates. 

Increasing the rate of pay and mileage reimbursement will help ensure our juries more fairly reflect the communities they represent, increase 
access to justice for the community, and increase trust in government. We hope this change will also increase the response rate, bringing in 
more individuals who can make this important sacrifice, thus improving turnout, representation, and engagement.

STATE COURT FACILITIES AND SECURITY 

State Court Facilities and Security 

he State Court Facilities and Security Account (SCFSA) funds several distinct services through an allocation from the Criminal Fine Account. 
Passage of HB 2012 (2011) established the Criminal Fine Account and modified the State Court Facilities and Security Account (SCFSA) and its 
authorizing statute, ORS 1.178. That statute was further modified by SB 1579 (2012) and SB 49 (2013). These changes created four discrete, 
allowable expense categories, funded through a biennial allocation from the Criminal Fine Account to the SCFSA. These expenditures categories are 
as follows: 

•  Developing or implementing the plan for state court security emergency preparedness business continuity and physical security adopted 

under ORS 1.177; 

•  Statewide training on court security; 

•  Distributions to court facilities security accounts maintained under ORS 1.182; and 

•  Capital improvements for courthouses and other state court facilities. 

xpenditures under the first two areas fall under the Oregon Judicial Department’s (OJD) Marshal’s Office, located in the Office of the State Court 

Administrator (OSCA) and under the direction of the Chief Judicial Marshal. The third area is pass-through funding to counties to assist them in 
meeting their statutory mandate to provide courthouse security. The final area includes funding for capital improvements to courthouse buildings, 
which are owned and operated by counties. 

arshal’s Office 

he Marshal’s Office is responsible for implementation of security standards for state court security adopted pursuant to ORS 1.177 and 1.180. The 
priority for the programs of the office reflects protection of judges, staff, and clients across the continuum of security threats, emergency incidents, 
and long-term events that require activation of business continuity plans. Since its creation in 2007, the Marshal’s Office has evolved from creation 
of security requirements and standards to implementation of required standards throughout the state court system. Examples of program components 
include the following: 

•  Physical Security for the Oregon Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Tax Court, and OSCA operations;   

•  Security of the Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court / judicial branch; 

• 

Identification and access control card program for the department;

STATE COURT FACILITIES AND SECURITY 

•  Emergency response trailer operations and maintenance to provide court services in emergency situations; 

•  Emergency communications devices that include satellite and smart phones; 

•  Maintenance of existing security systems;  

•  Training for deputy sheriffs and contract officers providing security for circuit courts of the state; 

•  Emergency operations funds for security, emergency preparedness, or business continuity events affecting the circuit or appellate courts 

or OSCA; 

•  Security and emergency preparedness training for judges, court staff, and OSCA; and 

•  Business continuity exercise program, which tests court and OSCA continuity plans in accordance with Chief Justice Order 10-048. 

n addition to the above duties, the Marshal’s Office is responsible for standardization of security systems for courthouses around the state. In 2008, 
the Marshal’s Office, with the assistance of the National Center for State Courts, developed court security standards for all OJD courts and divisions. 
Using the developed standards, the Marshal’s Office has implemented safety improvements across the state to help courts meet the standards 
published in Chief Justice Order 10-048. The plan involved installing, where absent, or upgrading existing court systems to meet the new standards 
regarding: 

•  Access control systems;  

•  Magnetometers (stationary and portable); 

•  Security camera systems; 

•  Duress alarm systems; 

•  Transparent barriers (especially where monetary transactions are taking place); and 

•  Armoring of benches for ballistic resistance. 

he Marshal’s Office continues to work with local courts to replace and upgrade existing security system and anticipate new security risks. 

he Marshal’s Office responds to acute security situations that arise and assists courts where an increase in security is required due to high-profile 
court cases (e.g., death penalty cases, gang or organized crime related). The Marshal’s Office also assesses any threats to judges and department staff 
and may provide additional resources where needed.

STATE COURT FACILITIES AND SECURITY 

 
Distributions to Court Security Accounts 

ursuant to ORS 1.178 and 1.182, OJD distributes court security funds to 
court facilities security accounts maintained by county treasurers in each 
county. These funds are intended to assist counties, who are responsible 
for courthouse security, and are not intended to replace local funds. For 
most counties, the local court security account provides less than 20 
percent of the total security budget, the remaining 80 percent being 
provided by the county. Justice and municipal courts are also required by 
law to make payments directly to the local security account from fines 
imposed for crimes and violations in those courts. 

ajor changes in distribution of fine revenues occurred following passage 

of HB 2712 (2011) and HB 2562 (2013). Prior to 2011, state law 
established a court security assessment that circuit, justice, and municipal 
courts imposed, collected, and sent directly to the county. These payments 
were not part of OJD’s Other Funds budget. HB 2712 repealed the specific 
court security assessment, incorporated it into the fine amount, and 
directed all revenue into the Criminal Fine Account (CFA). These changes 
took effect on January 1, 2012; OJD received an 18-month court security 
allocation from the CFA (with Other Funds expenditure limitation) and 
distributed those funds to each county. In 2013, the Legislature approved 
HB 2562, which allowed justice and municipal courts to send court security funds directly to the county and do so from the last dollars collected from 
a fine. This reduced the CFA allocation to OJD, and the lower priority for court security collections also reduced revenue to the local accounts.  

he 2015 Legislature approved a one-time policy option package to add $1.1 million to OJD’s court security allocation, providing emergency 

funding for those counties that were negatively impacted by the changes in HB 2562 (2013) for the 2015-17 biennium. 

JD is required by law to survey local court security accounts and spending each year. For fiscal year 2022, overall deposits remain relatively static 

into the account from justice and municipal courts around Oregon. Security deposits are generally not sufficient to support existing security 
programs, especially in many rural counties. Many jurisdictions do not provide security screening at courthouse entrances. For the 2023-25 biennium, 
OJD has proposed a General Fund pass-through payment in Policy Option Package 116 to counties for entrance screening in all courthouse facilities 
across the state.

Capital Improvements for Courthouses 

STATE COURT FACILITIES AND SECURITY 

he 2007 Legislature funded a statewide assessment to determine the safety and functionality of all Oregon county courthouses, as well as potential 
application of draft court facilities guidelines adopted by the Interim Committee on Court Facilities in 2006. The Oregon Court Facilities Assessment 
study, completed in 2008, highlighted more than $843 million in needed upgrades and repairs to the existing state court facilities to deal with the 
serious issues found during the assessment, which included seismic safety, life/safety systems, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act 
(ADA), and other improvements.  

RS 1.185 requires counties to provide courtrooms, offices and jury rooms:  

(1) The county in which a circuit court is located or holds court shall: 

(a) Provide suitable and sufficient courtrooms, offices and jury rooms for the court, the judges, other officers and employees of the 
court and juries in attendance upon the court, and provide maintenance and utilities for those courtrooms, offices and jury rooms. 

 

(b) Pay expenses of the court in the county other than those expenses required by law to be paid by the state. 

(2) Except as provided in subsection (1) of this section, all supplies, materials, equipment and other property necessary for the operation of 
the circuit courts shall be provided by the state under ORS 1.187. [Formerly 1.165] 

ith continued budgetary constraints, including reduced federal timber payments for many rural Oregon counties, local county governments 

continue to have difficulty addressing this issue independently. The 2011 Legislature, when it passed HB 2712, added a $3 court facilities assessment 
to provide state funding for courthouse improvements through the SCSFA, and directed the Chief Justice to prepare a biennial plan for courthouse 
improvements (ORS 1.176). The Chief Justice submits requests for facility improvements and capital projects in compliance with that requirement.  

unding has been provided in prior biennia to assist counties and has been utilized for a variety of projects that have delivered access, safety, and 
improved courthouse facilities – especially in rural parts of Oregon. Some of the most notable projects financed since the program began are detailed 
below. 

•  Union County Courthouse Replacement – A partnership with Union County resulted in a replacement project for one of the worst 

courthouse locations in the state. The old courthouse was a former repurposed hospital built in 1937, with major safety and operational 
issues. Court operations and courtrooms where spread over multiple floors. Security was an extreme concern due to multiple entrances 
and limited waiting areas, and access to courtrooms required inmates to be transported through office areas. Rooms used for courtrooms 
had line-of-sight issues due to support columns, which also could create audio recording problems.

STATE COURT FACILITIES AND SECURITY 

During the 2013-15 biennium, $2.0 million in capital funds were provided for a joint project between the state and Union County to 
replace the courthouse. Using existing land owned by the county near the county jail, site preparation and groundbreaking took place in 
spring of 2015. Construction was completed, and a courthouse dedication was held in March of 2016. This has been the largest project 
financed with funding from the SCFSA.  

•  Curry County Courthouse Roof Replacement – The old Curry County courthouse roof was installed in 1991. Due to deterioration, the 
roof needed to be replaced, not just repaired. Capital improvement funding totaling $150,000 from the SCFSA was provided for the 
project, which was completed in 2015 and was the first complete project financed from SCFSA funds. 

•  Columbia County Courthouse Elevator Replacement – During the 2015-17 biennium, the courthouse building in Columbia County 

lost use of the single elevator in the facility. Due to difficulties in the county budget, replacing the elevator would have been problematic, 
reducing accessibility to the facility for Oregonians, especially those individuals with disabilities. With funding available in the SCFSA, 
$190,000 was allocated to the county for a new elevator, which was installed in 2015.  

•  Curry and Gilliam Counties Life Safety – HB 2331 (2007) directed OJD to assess all state court facilities. During the assessment, 

courthouses in Curry and Gilliam counties were found to be deficient in terms of life/safety safeguards including fire suppression and 
alarm systems. In conjunction with county efforts, $623,838 was provided from the SCFSA account to upgrade fire alarm and fire 
suppression systems in these counties.  

•  Douglas County Water/Plumbing – During the 2015-17 biennium, funding from the SCFSA was used for a pipe replacement project in 

Douglas County. The old piping in the courthouse was corroded and the hot water service had been shut off for several years. The 
corrosion had also threatened to prevent any water service to the facility. A total of $919,309 was provided to the county for the project.  

•  Wallowa Life Safety/ADA/Roof and Jury Improvements – The Wallowa County courthouse was built in 1909 and lacked any basic 
life/safety/ADA systems that are installed in most county courthouses. In the 2015-17 biennium, $1.25 million in funding was provided 
that added an elevator to the courtroom on the 2nd floor of the building, a fire alarm system, a jury room with bathroom, updated electrical 
systems, and a new roof.  

•  Malheur Elevator/ADA/Life Safety – Also during the 2015-17 biennium, the SCFSA financed several changes to help facilitate access 
to the Malheur County courthouse and courtroom, and address life and safety issues. Funding provided for the installation of an elevator 
between the main floors of the courthouse, a lift from the basement to improve access to records, ADA changes to the women’s 
restrooms, and a fire alarm system for the facility. 

ince the 2013-15 biennium when funding was first provided, SCFSA projects have been executed in multiple courthouses located across the state. 

The selection of projects and the number of projects completed is based on priority recommendations by the Association of Oregon Counties,

Counties (AOC) Court Facilities Task Force (CFTF) on a list of 
recommended projects. OJD has proposed Policy Option Package 121 for 
$8,685,676 to fund the following proposed projects. Due to overall 
demand out of the Criminal Fines Account, OJD moved the funding from 
CFA to Other Miscellaneous Other Funds.

Policy Option Package 121 – Circuit Court Capital Improvement Projects 

STATE COURT FACILITIES AND SECURITY 

In past biennia, the Legislature has authorized funding through the State Court Facilities and Security Account from the Criminal Fines 
Account, authorized through ORS 1.178 2(d), for capital improvements for courthouses and other state court facilities. This funding allowed 
the Oregon Judicial Department (OJD) to target needed improvement and replacement projects around the state and specifically in many rural 
counties where county funding may be limited. 

Allocation from the Criminal Fine Account to finance proposed critical projects, as prioritized by the Association of Oregon Counties and 
approved by the Chief Justice. Due to anticipated shortfall in the Criminal Fines Account, funding in ORBITS was changed to a 1050 
Account Transfer – Unspecified Other Fund.

THIRD-PARTY COLLECTIONS 

Third-Party Collections 

tate courts collect revenue from a variety of sources, such as statutory filing and other fees in civil cases and fines and restitution in criminal and 
violation cases. In civil cases, state law requires payment of filing fees and other fees for jury trials, settlement conferences, filing some motions, and 
other activities. If the court cannot collect fees, fines, and restitution the judgment is sent to a third party – the Department of Revenue (DOR) or a 
private collection firm (PCF) – for collection. 

ivil fees comprise a small part of the Oregon Judicial Department’s (OJD) liquidated and delinquent debt (debt resulting from a judgment that is not 

paid on time). These fees are collected at the time of filing or the activity. However, judges have the authority to waive (not impose) or defer (allow 
payment at a later date or over time). Where these actions are taken, fee waivers are more likely to be granted than deferrals. 

ourts also impose and collect fines for offenses (crimes and noncriminal violations) that are sent to state-level funds and accounts and to local 
governments. Courts also can impose and collect restitution and compensatory fines that go to individual crime victims. Monetary obligations in 
offense cases can remain valid for up to 50 years. 

ny time a fee or fine must be referred to a third party for collection, ORS 1.202(2) requires courts to assess a fee to the debtor to pay for the costs of 

collection. The system reference for this fee is called the Collection Referral Assessment Fee (CRAS). OJD sets the CRAS rate to cover expected 
collection costs. The current CRAS rate is 28 percent of the outstanding balance referred to DOR or PCF. These collection activities occur 
continuously as long as the judgment remains valid. 

he 2011 Legislature modified how collections activities were funded. Prior to the 2011-13 biennium, OJD received the revenue from collections, 
deducted the third-party costs and paid them directly, and forwarded the net revenue to the appropriate fund, account, or local government entity. As 
long as the CRAS rate was set properly, OJD’s collections costs were in balance with CRAS revenues, and no legislative appropriation was required.  

uring the 2011-13 biennium, however, the Legislature directed the CRAS fee revenue to the General Fund and established a new General Fund 
appropriation (Third-Party Collections) to pay the fees associated with the collection of fees, fines, and restitution. The types of expenditures that are 
included in this appropriation are as follows: 

•  Credit Card Fees – Payments to US Bank for credit card payments made directly to OJD or through the File and Serve system 

•  State Treasury Fees – Charges for banking services 

•  Other State Agency Fees – Charges for Department of Justice services for foreclosure complaints and garnishments, charges for 

Department of Administrative Services printing services for collection notices

he new structure illustrated in the flowchart above creates two complications. First, the CRAS fee revenue is no longer provided directly to OJD to 
ensure that actual collection costs are covered. The second complication is that the amount of appropriation from the Legislature limits OJD’s ability 
to respond if collections exceed projections or OJD costs increase because of DOR rate changes. In those circumstances, OJD must either restrict 
collection activities to remain within the allocated budget for those activities (and thereby reducing revenue to the State), seek an additional 
legislative appropriation, or use OJD court operations funds to compensate for the shortfall (reducing funding for OJD’s core functions).

Third-Party Collection Costs 

THIRD-PARTY COLLECTIONS 

he new structure has resulted in an increased disparity between OJD’s collection costs and the amount of the Third-Party appropriation. Collection 

activities regularly have been more successful than budgeted, meaning that revenues from collections are higher. In addition, the timing and 
frequency of DOR rate changes have made accurate budgeting more difficult. When an appropriation increase is not approved, the options for staying 
within budget are either to reduce collections activities, which will reduce state revenues, or to pay for these activities from OJD’s operating budget, 
which affects court operations. OJD has been in this difficult position and supplemented with increasing amounts from the OJD operations budget in 
four of the last five biennia. The 2021-23 biennium demonstrates how a reduction of collection activities directly impacts collection costs. In order to 
reduce the economic impact to Oregonians during the pandemic, collection activities and referrals were suspended March 2020 through November 
2021, which resulted in reduced collection expenditures. OJD does not expect this trend to continue into the next biennium. 

he 2021-23 General Fund appropriation for Third-Party Collections is $15.9 million. Collection expenditures for 2021-23 are projected to be $14 
million, and for 2023-25 are expected to increase by 10 percent over the projected 2021-23 amount. Projections of collection costs are based on the 
2021-23 Office of Economic Analysis revenue forecast with COVID impact, current referral rates of court debt, current third-party collection rates, 
and increased DOR collection fees (increases in collection fees and no rebates for two years).

Due to the level of uncertainty that exists with fluctuating collections and external factors in the COVID environment (third-party rate increases, 
third-party performance, case filings, economic downturns, future changes in staffing levels), OJD cannot predict the accuracy of our cost projection 
with a high degree of assurance. Changes in any of these external factors will affect collection revenues and the resulting actual costs.

Third-Party Collections Revenue 

THIRD-PARTY COLLECTIONS 

hird-party revenue collections include restitution owed to victims, fines, assessments, and deferred civil filings. This revenue is distributed as 

directed by statute, to victims of crime, the General Fund, the Criminal Fine Account, and to counties, cities, and local agencies. OJD refers debt to 
DOR first because it has lower collection costs than PCFs. DOR therefore has newer accounts, a larger percentage of OJD’s delinquent accounts, and 
collects more money than the PCFs. 

n 2021-23, revenue collected by third parties is expected to be $58.8 million and increase by 10 percent in 2023-25.

Revenue Collected for Each Dollar Spent on Collections 

THIRD-PARTY COLLECTIONS 

n 2021-23, the state is expected to recover $4.20 for each $1.00 spent on third-party collection activities. This represents total third-party revenue of 
$58.8 million divided by total third-party costs of $14 million. The increases in DOR collection fees (and reduced rebates) in addition to increased 
use of credit cards and other agency fees have reduced the revenue returned from each dollar spent over the past several biennia, but there is still 
significant benefit the state receives from the monies spent to collect court-imposed debt.

PASS-THROUGHS 

Pass-Throughs 

n addition to the court security funding mentioned in the previous section, new General Fund appropriations were established in the 2011-13 
biennium for external pass-through payments to counties for law libraries and mediation/conciliation programs, to the Council on Court Procedures, 
Legal Aid through the Oregon State Bar, and Oregon Law Commission. In prior biennia, funding for some of the programs was provided directly to 
counties through circuit court filing fees or by agency appropriations. When the 2011 Legislature modified Oregon’s filing fee structure it moved 
funding for these programs and services to pass-throughs in the Oregon Judicial Department (OJD) budget. 

ackground 

n 2011, the Legislature passed HB 2710 (chapter 585, Oregon Laws 2011). This bill revised the laws relating to court fees by establishing a uniform 
filing fee for various types of cases (civil, domestic relations, small claims, etc.) that are consistent in every county. The bill also eliminated add-ons, 
surcharges, and other variable fees. 

ith passage of HB 2710, ORS 21.005 provided that all fees and charges collected by circuit courts must be deposited in the General Fund, effective 
July 1, 2011. ORS 21.007 changed the way counties receive funding for mediation/conciliation services and operating law libraries. Before HB 2710, 
Oregon law authorized individual counties to add surcharges to circuit court filing fees, with certain limitations. This authority was repealed by HB 
2710 and the programs became funded by pass-throughs from OJD.  

 similar process took place in the 2013-15 biennium for payments to the Oregon State Bar for Legal Aid programs, as directed by ORS 9.577(3). 

Instead of being allocated from circuit court filing fees, it first was established as a separate Other Funds limitation in the OJD budget and then 
increased and changed to a General Fund allocation during the 2019 Legislative Session. 

aw Libraries and Conciliation and Mediation Services 

he legislative intent of HB 2710 was to provide a General Fund appropriation that was equivalent to the historical funding these programs received 
in prior years, to the extent possible given budget constraints, and exclude any temporary revenue increases due to surcharges authorized by HB 2287 
(2009). OJD’s budget bill (2011 HB 5056) contained a $7.4 million appropriation for mediation/conciliation programs and directed the Chief Justice 
to consult with presiding judges before making any distributions to counties. The bill also appropriated $7.4 million to OJD for county law library 
operations and services and directed OJD to distribute monies appropriated to the counties based on revenue received from filing fees collected 
during the 2009-11 biennium in civil actions commenced in the circuit court for the county. These two appropriations were each reduced by 3.5 
percent, or $0.259 million, by SB 5701 (2012).

Changes in the proportion of total law library revenue distributed to counties from 2007-09 to 2009-11 were driven by case filings and fees (the old 
system). The Legislature based the 2011-13 General Fund appropriation for law libraries on the 2007-09 funding level to exclude the one-time 
revenue increase from the HB 2287 temporary surcharges. OJD distributed the 2011-13 General Fund appropriation to each county based on its 
proportion of total law library revenue received in 2009-11. Overall law library program funding over the past decade has been lower than the $7.66 
million distributed during the 2009-11 biennium. For the 2019-21 biennium, law library distributions were further reduced by $0.9 million during the 
2020 Second Special Session by SB 5721, section 331. Conciliation/mediation distributions funding provided over the past decade is also lower than 
the distributions given during the 2009-21 biennium. 

ounties also are authorized by statute to move a portion of their law library funds to support mediation/conciliation services. This is done outside 

the OJD budget process.

Council on Court Procedures 

stablished in 1977 by ORS 1.725 to 1.750, the Council on Court Procedures 

promulgates rules governing pleading, practice, and procedures in all civil proceedings 
in the circuit courts of the state. Proposed amendments to the rules are submitted to the 
Legislature in January of odd-numbered years and go into effect on January 1st of the 
following year unless amended, repealed, or supplemented by the Legislature.

he Oregon Law Commission was created in statute (ORS 173.315) by the 1997 

Legislative Assembly. The Commission’s function is to “conduct a continuous 
substantive law revision program …” The Commission provides assistance to the 
Legislature in proposing modifications of statutes by: 

• 

Identifying and selecting law reform projects; 

•  Researching the area of law at issue, including other states’ laws to see how 

they deal with similar issues;

Legal Aid 

n 1997, the Legislative Assembly directed the Oregon State Bar to establish a Legal 
Services Program to provide no-cost legal services to low-income Oregonians in non-
criminal cases (ORS 9.572). Revenue from court filing fees constitute the majority of the 
Legal Services Program budget.  

rior to the 2013-15 biennium, distributions to the Legal Aid Account from filing fee 

revenue were performed before normal General Fund distributions. For the 2013-15 
biennium, the distributions were added to pass-throughs as an Other Funds payment to 
correctly account for the distributions. In 2015, SB 5507 added a one-time $0.6 million 
General Fund appropriation and in 2016 an additional $0.2 million in one-time General Fund 
appropriation was added by SB 5701 to address services related to housing issues. These two 
additions pushed the total funding for Legal Aid to $12.7 million for the biennium.  

or the 2019-21 budget, funding for the Legal Services Program was changed from an Other Funds payment to a General Fund appropriation 
established in SB 5513 and set at $12.257 million. For the 2023-25 biennium, the CSL budget for Legal Aid was calculated to be $13,957,733.

Local court security accounts authorized under ORS 1.178 and 1.182 supplement court security provided by local Sheriff's offices. 
Unfortunately, the funding stream has been insufficient for many years and court security needs have increased, putting additional pressure on 
local court security accounts. Courts like Benton and Jackson have either had to downgrade or consider closing screening stations due to 
declining revenues, while courts with no security screening remain vulnerable, without a viable remedy. Many other courts are not able to 
provide basic security improvements or upgrades, such as security cameras. Sadly, violence against judges has been increasing across the 
country. Without additional court security funding to meet minimum security standards, all court occupants – including both users and staff - 
are at risk.  

To implement the minimum-security standard for all court facilities established in Chief Justice Order (CJO) 17-072, OJD is asking funding 
that would be passed through to counties to provide security screening equipment in 22 counties that have no entrance screening and share the 
costs of screening personnel with counties for all court facilities statewide. Counties will also ensure there is only one public entrance into the 
court facility and continue to provide on-site law enforcement. 

PASS-THROUGHS 

OJD's mission is to provide fair and accessible justice services that protect the 
rights of individuals, preserve community welfare, and inspire public confidence. 
To fulfill this mission and inspire public trust and confidence in those we serve, it is 
important for people to feel safe when they enter our courts. Of the 36 circuit courts 
in Oregon, only 14 counties have entrance screening to protect our court users, 
court staff, and judges. All state court facilities need security entrance screening, 
but local court security accounts have been chronically underfunded for years.

COURTHOUSE CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION AND IMPROVEMENT 

Oregon Courthouse Capital Construction and Improvement Fund 

ounties are by law responsible to provide suitable and sufficient court facilities for the state’s operation of the circuit courts. This legal obligation 

continued when the State of Oregon assumed responsibility decades ago for the operating costs of courts and for providing indigent defense. 

any courthouses, however, have significant deferred maintenance and many lack seismic protection. The 2007 Legislature funded a statewide 

assessment to determine the safety and functionality of all Oregon county courthouses, as well as potential application of draft court facilities 
guidelines adopted by the Interim Committee on Court Facilities in 2006. The Oregon Court Facilities Assessment study, completed in 2008, 
highlighted more than $843 million in needed upgrades and repairs to the existing state court facilities to deal with the serious issues found during the 
assessment, which included seismic safety, life/safety systems, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and other 
improvements.  

he 2013 Legislature created the Oregon Courthouse Capital Construction and Improvement Fund (OCCCIF) to provide state matching funds to 
replace unsafe courthouses. Oregon law1 provides that the fund is intended to “… be used solely to finance costs related to acquiring, constructing, 
remodeling, repairing, equipping or furnishing land, improvements, courthouses or portions of courthouses that are owned by or operated by the State 
of Oregon.” Under current practice, new state-supported courthouses continue to be owned by counties but are operated by the state under no-cost 
lease agreements.  

o be eligible for OCCCIF funding: 

•  The courthouse with respect to which the bonds will be issued must have significant structural defects, including seismic defects, that 

present actual or potential threats to human health and safety;  

•  Replacing the courthouse, whether by acquiring and remodeling or repairing an existing building or by constructing a new building, must 

be more cost-effective than remodeling or repairing the courthouse;  

•  Replacing the courthouse must create an opportunity for co-location of the court with other state offices; and,  

•  The Chief Justice and the Department of Administrative Services must approve the project for which the bonds will be used.

State matching funds may be up to 25 percent of allowable project costs for state-used space (courts, and common areas). However, if the new 
courthouse also provides space for co-location opportunities with other state agencies, the matching funds may be up to 50 percent. Costs for locating 
any county offices in the new facility, including district attorney offices, are the responsibility of the county.

Session. The total cost of the project was $15 million, with the state providing a planned $6.5 million in matching funds (50 percent of allowable 
expenses). Groundbreaking was held in April 2015 with the dedication held in September 2016.

$31.5 million in XI-Q bonds that were not sold. A third request for $94.5 million for construction was approved by the 2021-23 Legislature to be sold 
in spring 2023. A final request for $61.0 million will be requested in 2023-25 as part of Policy Option Package 122. 

lackamas County’s Board of County Commissioners voted in May 2021 to pursue a Public-Private Partnership approach in which a P3 “Project 

Company” would become responsible for the new courthouse design, financing, operation, and maintenance as part of a 30-year contract and in 
accordance with county specifications. The Commission approved a P3 approach in lieu of a municipal bond offering. The Clackamas County 
Courthouse will be Oregon's first court facility to utilize this approach. Nationally, other courthouse projects have utilized a design-build-finance-
operate-maintain (DBFM) P3 agreement (including Howard County Courthouse, Maryland; Long Beach, California; and Miami/Dade, Florida). 
Unlike other projects proposed to date, this will utilize a P3 to finance, build, and maintain the courthouse.  

nder the proposed Clackamas County DBFM P3, the state’s 50 percent funding requirement would be a made over the course of five years, totaling 

$94.5 million (2021-2025) with one of the payments being a “milestone” payment of $85.0 million occurring when construction of the new 
courthouse has been completed and the building certified for occupancy, currently estimated to occur in 2025.  

lackamas County’s matching funds contribution of 50 percent for the design and construction costs would be made to the P3 Project Company over 

a 30-year period (2025-2055). Such county payments are referred to as “availability payments” and include both the county’s share of debt for the 
capital costs as well as building maintenance and a capital reserve to repair, replace, and refurbish building components over the 30-year term of the 
P3 agreement. Per the county’s P3 Project Term sheet, the county retains ownership of the land and building and the contractual obligation to make 
payments to the Project Company will not result in any liens or security interests on the completed courthouse.

to build a replacement courthouse as part of a justice center facility (estimated $130 million) in downtown Corvallis. The county was appropriated $2 
million in planning funds by the 2019 Legislature (re-appropriated in 2022) and was authorized for $26.6 million in state construction funds in 2019, 
which the county later reduced to $20.7 million. A supplemental $5 million in bonds was later determined necessary because of inflation and other 
rising costs and will be requested as a part of Policy Option Package 122 in the 2023 session. 
Present funding associated with the project: 

•  Appropriated General Funds, $2.0 million in 2019 for planning matching funds, that were unspent at the end of the biennium and re-

appropriated in 2022 

•  Planned 2021 XI-Q bond request, $26.6 million for construction, plus an amount to be determined for FFE, however the county then 

lowered their estimate and was authorized for $20.73 million ($20.4 million for the project) in 2021 to be sold in spring 2023 

•  Planned 2023 XI-Q bond request, $5.1 million for final construction to be sold 2025 

Linn County Courthouse 

he Linn County courthouse was built in 1940 and expanded in 1967, before Oregon had a statewide building code. As with many other courthouse 

facilities, its age and design contribute to significant seismic issues as well as space limitations and security concerns. The Oregon Court Facilities 
Assessment found the building needed “excessive” upgrades for seismic safety and defendant custody, as well as significant upgrades to security 
systems. The courthouse was ranked 13th in the Oregon Court Facilities Assessment. The county originally proposed purchasing land to build a 
public safety campus, of which the courthouse would be part; however, it has since proposed building a new adjoining building to the existing 
courthouse. Linn County was approved for a one-time request of $15.9 million in state matching funds by the 2019 Legislature, however the newest 
proposal had yet to be reviewed in detail for compliance with the OCCCIF requirements and for approval by the Chief Justice. The bond sale was 
deferred and re-approved in the 2021 legislative session. To date the county has not submitted an updated plan for review. 

resent funding associated with the project: 

•  2019-21 biennium: Approved 2019 XI-Q bonds, $16.2 million ($15.9 million for the project), plus an amount still to be determined for 

FFE. Sale of these bonds was deferred in the 2020 Second Special Session.  

•  2021-23 biennium: Approved 2021 XI-Q bonds, $16.1 million approved ($15.9 million for the project), however this is not currently 

projected to be sold.

Curry County Courthouse 

he Curry County courthouse was built in 1956 and is connected by pathway to the adjacent sheriff’s office and jail. Ranked 42nd among the 48 court 

facilities in the Oregon Court Facilities Assessment, it is the lowest-ranked courthouse for which OJD is requesting replacement funding. The 
assessment found the facility needed significant upgrades to fire alarm and fire sprinkler systems, plumbing, and power systems. In 2021, OJD was 
provided with $3.5 million of American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds to support project planning. The county estimates they will need $10.6 
million for construction.

Crook County Courthouse 

his 1909 building ranked 40th in the Oregon Court Facilities Assessment, only slightly better than the Curry County facility. The assessment noted 

“excessive” upgrades needed in seismic safety and in-custody defendant areas, and “significant” upgrades needed in security and other building 
systems. The county hopes to replace the existing courthouse with a multi-purpose, multi-agency justice center. In 2021, OJD was provided with 
$169,827 in ARPA planning funds. In the 2021 session, OJD was authorized to sell $11.9 million in XI-Q bonds for construction. In the 2022 short

2023-25 PROJECT REQUESTS 

arney County Courthouse 

JD works with the Association of Oregon Counties to identify counties seeking State matching funds for courthouse replacement and to recommend 

priorities to the Chief Justice. As a result of that process, the Chief Justice is requesting funding for the following projects: 

he Harney County courthouse is located in Burns and was constructed in 1949. Renovations have been made, but structurally the building has 

remained substantially unchanged. It is a 22,000 square foot, two-story structure with a basement. The 1942 courthouse building retains much of its 
historic detail and character. Overall, the courthouse is ranked 27th in terms of overall rating out of the 48 facilities reviewed for the Oregon Court 
Facilities Assessment.  

ecently, the county has purchased the Lincoln building that was previously owned by the school district and has plans to renovate the 3rd floor to 

serve as the new courthouse with indigent defense providers (OPDS) as the co-located state agency. Though this project is still in early planning 
stages renovation costs are projected at $6 million, and the state’s share of $3 million is being requested in 2023 as either part of Policy Option 
Package 119 or 122. 

•  Planned 2023 XI-Q bond request, $3,000,000 million for construction 
  

Hood River County Courthouse 

he Hood River County courthouse was built in 1954 and ranked 46th (third worst) in the Oregon Court Facilities Assessment. In addition to being 

seismically vulnerable, its outdated design and space utilization create security issues for judges, staff, victims, witnesses, and the public. Details 
regarding the site and co-location with state agencies have yet to be decided. Hood River was recommended as a priority by the Association of 
Oregon Counties in 2015-17, but later withdrew its request. A request was made again in 2017-19 and was again withdrawn. For the 2023 legislative 
session, the county is requesting $42,549 in General Fund matching planning funds to produce a plan. 

•  Planned 2023 General Fund request, $42,549 for planning 

incoln County Courthouse 

he Lincoln County courthouse was built in 1954 and expanded in 1964. It ranked 20th in the Oregon Court Facilities Assessment. The assessment 
found the courthouse needed upgrades in fire alarms and sprinkler systems, security systems, and a “modest” seismic upgrade. The county’s seismic

survey, not considered by the assessment, reported that the construction used low-strength concrete, that federal seismic hazard mapping expects 
“very large” ground motions at the site, and that the building contained several key deficiencies in the building’s structural systems. For the 2023 
legislative session the county is requesting $56,250 in General Fund matching planning funds to produce a plan. 

•  Planned 2023 General Fund request, $56,250 for planning 

 

Morrow County Courthouse 

he Morrow County courthouse is a three-story building (including basement) constructed in 1902. The building is located on a high point at the 
edge of downtown Heppner and overlooks the town. The building retains much of its original historic detail and character. The Morrow County 
courthouse has a structural system consisting of unreinforced masonry (URM) bearing/shear walls with wood-framed floor and roof systems and has 
not been seismically reinforced as part of any past renovation projects. Based on the historic performance of this type of building, and this building’s 
location in a region of moderate seismicity, the Morrow Courthouse would be expected to suffer severe and extensive structural and nonstructural 
damage in the design earthquake. Although collapse may not occur, the building would likely experience partial collapse or near collapse. Major non-
structural components necessary for the continued operation of the building could be expected to be out of service and exits could be blocked. The 
courthouse would very likely need to be vacated and demolished.  

or decades, Morrow County and state courts have provided court services in a space that is insufficient and has safety and security concerns. 
Overall, the courthouse is ranked 43rd in terms of overall rating out of the 48 facilities (sixth worst) reviewed for the Oregon Court Facilities 
Assessment. Morrow County has general fund dollars available, as well as discretionary funds from Strategic Investment Program (SIP) agreements 
and other payment in lieu of tax programs. The Board of Commissioners is committed to the replacement project that they estimate will cost 
$12,805,000, meaning the state’s matching portion would be $6,402,500.

olk County Courthouse 

he Polk County courthouse is made up of two adjoining buildings – the original 1898 three story (including basement) courthouse and the 1964 

three-story building. The 1898 building retains much of its historic detail and character but would be expected to suffer severe and extensive 
structural and nonstructural damage in the design earthquake. The 1964 courthouse building was constructed of concrete shear wall and could be

expected to suffer severe structural and non-structural damage in the design earthquake. Although total collapse should not occur, the extensive 
damage could make restoring the building unfeasible, however, and the building may need to be demolished. Overall, the courthouse is ranked 21st 
best in terms of overall rating out of the 48 facilities reviewed for the Oregon Court Facilities Assessment. For the 2023 legislative session the county 
is requesting $225,000 in General Fund matching planning funds to produce a plan. 

•  Planned 2023 General Fund request, $225,000 for planning 

matilla County Courthouse 

he Umatilla County courthouse is located on a full-block, flat, urban site in downtown Pendleton. The 1954 building is four stories with the 

courtrooms located on the second floor. The formal entry for the courthouse is located on the west side of the building with a parking lot running the 
full length of the east facade. Overall, the courthouse is ranked 25th in terms of overall rating out of the 48 facilities reviewed for the Oregon Court 
Facilities Assessment. 

ased on plan drawings and information from the facility, and historic performance of this building type and its location, the concrete shear wall 

courthouse could be expected to suffer severe structural and non-structural damage in the design earthquake, although total collapse should not occur. 
The extensive damage could make restoring the building unfeasible, however, and the building may need to be demolished. For the 2023 legislative 
session the county is requesting $100,000 in General Fund matching planning funds to produce a plan. 

•  Planned 2023 General Fund request, $100,000 for planning 

ashington County Courthouse 

he Washington County courthouse is a historic structure comprised of two phases – the smaller 1912 wing and the larger 1928 addition. The 

structure is four stories (including basement) and is also connected with two 1970s era additions – the Justice Services Building and a Public Safety 
Building. The courthouse is located in the center of a downtown city block with extensive and mature landscaping to the east and south. Of particular 
significance are the giant sequoia trees to the east of the courthouse.  

he courthouse retains much of its original historic detail and character on the exterior, with the notable exception of the original windows being 

replaced with single panels of glass. The interior spaces have undergone extensive changes and retain little original historic material. Structural 
drawings were not available, but the building appears to be concrete frame construction with masonry infill. Based on the historic performance of 
concrete frame buildings of this vintage and the location in this region of high seismicity, the Washington County courthouse would be expected to 
suffer severe structural and nonstructural damage in the design earthquake, although total collapse should not occur. The extensive damage could

Tillamook County Courthouse: The 2015 Legislature approved a 2017 sale of $8.05 million in bonds ($7.875 million was the project amount, the 
balance was Cost of Issuance), however after completion of OJD’s 2017-19 requested budget, Tillamook County withdrew its project as the county’s 
financing did not materialize. The county has occasionally expressed interest in restoring its priority status, but most recently has requested

ection One – Current Key Performance Measures 

2023-25 Key 
Performance Measure 

1.  Access and Fairness  
Rating of court users’ perception of access and fairness in the courts.  

SPECIAL REPORTS 

ur strategy 

The Oregon Judicial Department (OJD) measures Access and Fairness by surveying court users about their experiences accessing court services. In 
2022, OJD implemented an expanded Access and Fairness Survey, based on a survey created by the National Center for State Courts (NCSC), that 
incorporated feedback from people who accessed services remotely or via 
the court website as well as people who came to court in person. 

JD collected data in 2022 from May 1 through June 30 through online 
surveys. Surveys and information flyers were available in five languages 
(English, Spanish, Russian, Vietnamese, and Traditional Chinese). 

bout the targets 

OJD calculated the 2022 Access Index Score and Fairness Index Score by 
adapting the method recommended by NCSC’s CourTools: Access and 
Fairness guide to the expanded survey that OJD implemented in 2022. 
The index scores rate access and fairness on a scale where 100 is a perfect 
score, indicating a mean rating of 5 (Strongly Agree) on each access and 
fairness statement.  

he targets were recommended by the Oregon Supreme Court Council on Inclusion and Fairness (OSCCIF), which advises the Chief Justice and 
State Court Administrator on matters relating to equal access to Oregon state courts, based on the results from in-person pilot data collection in four 
courts (the Benton, Deschutes, Marion, and Union county circuit courts).  

hen setting the performance targets, OSCCIF noted court users who were unhappy with their experience at the courthouse may have been more 

likely than other court users to refuse to participate in the in-person pilot data collection, and that the pilot results may therefore have under-
represented individuals who had negative experiences in court. Results from online data collection in 2020 and 2022 support this supposition, as 
index scores from online data collection have been much lower than those from the in-person pilot.

SPECIAL REPORTS 

 
How we are doing and how we compare 
Data collected in 2022 show an Access Index Score of 74.4 and a Fairness Index Score of 65.5. These scores are lower than the performance targets 
but higher than the scores from data collection in 2020. 

actors affecting results and what needs to be done 

The 2022 Access and Fairness data collection differed from the 2018 pilot data collection that was used to set the targets in that it occurred statewide 
and online rather than in-person in four pilot courts. The 2022 data collection differed from both the 2018 pilot and the 2020 data collection in that it 
solicited input from users who accessed services remotely – whether by video or audio conference or through the OJD website – as well as in person.  

JD and OSCCIF will be examining the results, including the results by demographic group and type of legal assistance received, if any, and 

identifying steps for improvement. Given the continued importance of both in person and remote proceedings, any improvements in user experiences 
will require courts to have the technological and staff resources necessary to provide high quality services both in person and remotely. 

bout the data 

The 2022 data were collected through a voluntary online survey of court users between May 1 and June 30, 2022. OJD publicized the survey through 
promotional materials in five languages (English, Spanish, Russian, Vietnamese, and Traditional Chinese) provided to circuit courts and community 
partners, including the Oregon State Bar, legal nonprofits, and other justice partners.  

he results in this document are based on 565 responses received in May and June 2022, including responses from 35 of Oregon’s 36 circuit courts. 

All 565 participants responded to statements about access and were included in the Access Index Score. Of the 565 total participants, 179 reported 
appearing before a judge about their case and responded to additional statements on the fairness of the proceeding, which were used to calculate the 
Fairness Index Score.

Performance Measure 

2.  Clearance Rates 
The number of cases closed as a percentage of the number of cases filed.  

SPECIAL REPORTS 

ur strategy 

Clearance rates measure whether the courts are keeping up with their incoming caseload. If cases are not disposed in a timely manner, a backlog of 
cases awaiting disposition will grow. This measure is a single number that can be compared within the court for any and all case types, from month to 
month and year to year, or between one court and another. This information can help courts pinpoint emerging problems and indicate where 
improvements can be made. 
  
About the targets 
Courts should aspire to clear at least as many cases as have been filed in a 
period by having a clearance rate of 100 percent or higher.  

ow we are doing and how we compare 

In 2021, the number of cases closed was 100 percent of cases filed, which is 
higher than the previous year due to the relaxing of COVID-19 restrictions 
that impacted courts’ ability to hold in-person trials and hearings. When 
courts exceed the clearance rate targets, dispositions are outpacing filings 
and when courts fall below their clearance rate targets, caseflow 
management practices and resource allocations need to be reviewed.  

actors affecting results and what needs to be done 

Changes in caseload could impact the allocation of judicial officers to certain case types and initiate caseflow management improvements. Time to 
disposition rates may also vary due to the seriousness or complexity of the caseload, charging and pleading practices, variation in court case 
management practices, and the use of statewide business processes.  

bout the data 

This performance measure requires a count of cases closed and cases filed during a given time period. The clearance rate is calculated by dividing the 
number of cases closed by the number of cases filed during a given time period. The data collection period is each calendar year.

2023-25 Key 
Performance Measure 

3.  Time to Disposition 
The percentage of cases disposed or otherwise resolved within established timeframes.  
 

Our strategy 
This measure, in conjunction with Clearance Rates, is a fundamental case management tool that assesses the length of time it takes a court to process 
cases. It compares a court’s performance with national guidelines for timely case processing. The measure considers periods of inactivity beyond the 
court’s control and provides a framework for meaningful measurement across all case types. 

bout the targets 

National case processing time standards are published by the American Bar Association (ABA) and more recently by the Conference of State Court 
Administrators (COSCA). The Oregon Goals for Timely Disposition were originally based on the ABA standards as revised for Oregon by the 
Judicial Conference in the early 1990s. Model standards were created to unify the disparate national time standards to the greatest degree possible. 
They create a framework for state judicial branches to use when reviewing their own time to disposition standards. The model standards were 
adopted in August 2011 by the Conference of Chief Justices, the Conference of State Court Administrators, the American Bar Association House of 
Delegates, and the National Association of Court Management. Oregon used the model standards as a baseline in considering new and reviewing 
existing time to disposition standards. The Oregon Judicial Department adopted new standards in 2018 based on the Court Reengineering and 
Efficiencies Workgroup (CREW) recommendation to reflect changes made to docket management and case processing since the 1990s, including 
technological advancements in the areas of electronic filing and automated workflow. A 98 percent target is used rather than 100 percent in 
recognition that there will be a very small number of cases that will require more time to resolve, e.g., capital murder cases and highly complex, 
multi-party civil and juvenile cases that require a trial. Even these cases, however, should be monitored closely to ensure that they proceed to 
disposition without unnecessary delay. 

ow we are doing and how we compare 

In 2021, improvements were made in Administration of Estates, Juvenile Dependency, Juvenile Termination of Parental Rights (TPR), Forcible 
Entry Detainer (FED), and Small Claims. COVID-19 restrictions in 2020 and 2021 impacted courts’ ability to hold in-person trials and hearings, 
which will have a direct effect on time to disposition. As the courts continue to work through the backlog created by the COVID-19 restrictions, we 
anticipate seeing improvements in time to disposition in future years. 

actors affecting results and what needs to be done 

Changes in caseload could impact the allocation of judicial officers to certain case types and initiate caseflow management improvements. Time to 
disposition rates may also vary due to the seriousness or complexity of the caseload, charging and pleading practices, variation in court case 
management practices, and the use of statewide business processes.

2023-25 Key 
Performance Measure 

4. Time to Judgment Entry 
The percent of criminal cases that have a final judgment entered into the case register within three business days of 
the sentencing hearing or disposition.  

ur strategy 

Equality, fairness, and integrity in trial courts depend in substantial measure on the accuracy, availability, and accessibility of records. It is important 
that trial courts preserve an accurate record of their proceedings, decisions, orders, and judgments and that they update these in a timely manner.  
  
About the targets 
This measure reflects judgments in felony and misdemeanor criminal 
cases. Court staff should enter all court case actions as expeditiously and 
accurately as possible. This is especially true for criminal judgments 
since any delay in the entry of a judgment may have important legal 
consequences under Oregon law. All judgments should be entered 
within three days of sentencing hearing or final disposition. 

ow we are doing and how we compare 

In 2021, 79.9 percent of felony judgments were entered within three 
business days of the sentencing hearing or disposition and 88.1 percent 
of misdemeanor judgments were entered within three business days of 
the sentencing hearing or disposition. This is a decline for both felony 
and misdemeanor judgments. 

actors affecting results and what needs to be done 

When court staff manually enter data, human error is always possible. These errors are mitigated through standard data entry protocols as well as 
education programs and monitoring procedures to ensure that corrections can be made to court practices. This measure is not only a way to measure 
data timeliness and accuracy, but also a tool to identify training or resource needs at the courts. The COVID-19 pandemic, the pace of change in 
recent years, and a tight labor market is stressing OJD’s ability to maintain a well-trained and stable workforce.

About the data 
This performance measure considers the first statistical closure date and uses the sentence or disposition date (if dismissed) and the date of final 
judgment entry into the case register (legally effective date of the judgment). The days to judgment entry are then calculated using the time lapse 
between the sentence or disposition date and the judgment entry date. The data collection period is each calendar year.

2023-25 Key 
Performance Measure 

5. Time to First Permanency Hearing 
Percent of cases that have first permanency hearing within 14 months. 

SPECIAL REPORTS 

ur strategy 

Child abuse and neglect cases are driven by one underlying principle: expeditious permanency for children. The longer children are in substitute care, 
the longer they are in doubt as to where their permanent home will be and the more likely it is that they will have multiple placements. 

bout the targets 

Our target is to have 95 percent of cases have their first permanency 
hearing within the statutorily mandated timeframe of 14 months of the 
child entering substitute care. 

ow we are doing and how we compare 

In 2021, 85.5 percent of cases had a first permanency hearing within 14 
months, an increase from the previous year but below the target of 95 
percent. 

actors affecting results and what needs to be done 

Reports from courts and stakeholders and informal reviews of case files 
indicate that a main reason that cases do not meet the timeline is that 
hearings are continued or rescheduled due to lack of court time and/or 
attorney availability for contested hearings. Making additional court time 
available and increasing the availability of legal counsel for parties would likely move the numbers toward their target. 

bout the data 

Starting in 2017, the review period is the calendar year in which the first permanency hearing was held. In prior years, it was the year the case was 
due for its first permanency hearing. Timeliness is measured by determining the percentage of cases for which the last day of the first completed 
permanency hearing on the case was within 425 days (approximately 14 months) of the date that the dependency petition was entered.

Performance Measure 

6.  Collection Rate 
The percent of cases paid in full within a year of judgment (violations only). 

SPECIAL REPORTS 

ur strategy 

The Oregon Judicial Department (OJD) collection program is focused on statewide time standards for collection actions and early intervention to 
obtain payment in full as soon as possible. This measure focuses solely on violations to evaluate the timeliness and effectiveness of collection 
actions. Most violations do not have the same barriers to collections that 
are encountered when collecting on felony and misdemeanor debt 
(incarceration, unemployment, multiple debts with OJD and other 
probation/parole agencies, higher amounts owed).  
  
About the targets 
Courts should aspire to get payment in full on most violations within a 
year of judgment, therefore a 90 percent target was chosen.  

ow we are doing and how we compare 

In 2021, 83 percent of violations were paid in full in within a year of 
judgment, an improvement from the prior year.  

actors affecting results and what needs to be done 

For the past several years, approximately 20 percent of people cited with 
a violation failed to appear or pay by the date on their citation. Our goal is to make payment of a citation convenient and accessible in a variety of 
ways; online, by mail, over the phone, and in person.  

bout the data 

This performance measure calculates the percent of citations imposed and paid one year after a violation case is adjudicated (includes parking). The 
data collection period is each calendar year, but cases have to age at least a full year to look back at how many were paid in full within a year.

2023-25 Key 
Performance Measure 

7.  Adult Drug Court Recidivism 
Percent of participants with no new criminal offenses within a year of Adult Drug Court graduation. 

ur strategy 

Specialty courts are an alternative to traditional justice system processing for individuals with behavioral health issues who have repeatedly 
become involved with the justice system. Participants are empowered through trauma informed, non-stigmatizing services focused on 
prevention, identification, treatment, and recovery. Adult drug courts 
serve historically underserved individuals and reduce future involvement 
with the justice system. 
  
About the targets 
The Oregon Judicial Department (OJD) has established an aspirational 
goal of 90 percent of adult drug court graduates having no new felony or 
misdemeanor charges within one year of graduation. 

ow we are doing and how we compare 

Ninety-four percent of adult drug court graduates in 2020 did not have a 
new felony or misdemeanor charge within a year of graduation, which is 
above the 90 percent target. 

actors affecting results and what needs to be done 

OJD needs well-funded specialty courts with adequate support at both the statewide and local circuit court levels to continue its success in providing 
participants the tools to find and maintain long term recovery and avoid cycling back through the criminal justice system. The Office of the State 
Court Administrator’s specialty court team has additional staff, allowing it to increase the supports to specialty court teams throughout the biennium. 
Focus areas include ensuring fidelity to established best practices, using validated screening tools to create a more objective eligibility process, 
expanding data reports from the Specialty Court Case Management System (SCMS) and creating internal dashboards, evaluating program 
effectiveness, and implementing additional performance measures for continuous quality improvement. Additionally, with the guidance of a 
statewide racial and ethnic disparity tool in 2020, there are improvements needed to ensure cultural responsivity as well as equitable access, 
experiences, and outcomes for all individuals qualifying for specialty court programs.

SPECIAL REPORTS 

 
About the data 
The 2020 results and beyond use information from the Specialty Court Case Management System to identify adult drug court graduates and 
information from OJD’s Odyssey case management system to determine whether those individuals had new felony or misdemeanor charges within a 
year of graduating. Because Odyssey includes only information on circuit court cases, the measure looks only at whether new charges were filed in 
Oregon’s circuit courts and does not account for whether individuals had new charges in municipal courts or in other states. The data collection 
period is each calendar year, but cases must age a full year after graduation to look back at how many graduates had no new felony or misdemeanor 
charges filed within a year of graduation.

2023-25 Key 
Performance Measure 

8.  Effective Use of Jurors 
The percentage of available jurors who are selected for jury duty who are qualified and available to serve (juror yield). 

The percentage of citizens available to serve relates to the integrity of the jury pool list, the effectiveness of jury management practices, the 
willingness of citizens to serve, the efficacy of excuse and postponement policies, and the number of exemptions allowed. 

ur strategy 

bout the targets 

The National Center for State Courts (NCSC) commonly uses a juror 
yield goal of 40 percent, a value demonstrated to be realistic in many 
well-managed courts. The national average juror yield is approximately 
53 percent. Although variations are expected, points falling well above or 
well below the average can alert the court to the need for possible 
adjustments to the number of persons summoned. 

ow we are doing and how we compare 

In 2021, 40.5 percent of available jurors were qualified and available to 
serve, a decrease from the prior years. Oregon courts are above the NCSC 
goal of 40 percent but well below the national average target of 53 
percent.  

actors affecting results and what needs to be done 

Juror yield is used by court administrators to estimate the number of jury summonses to mail to secure an adequate number of jurors from which to 
select juries. However, it is also a measure of system efficiency as it indicates the relative amount of work a court must perform to achieve an 
adequate jury pool. Nationally, courts send approximately two jury summonses for every qualified and available juror they need to secure. Courts 
with higher yields require fewer jurors so it is in the juror and courts’ best interest to maximize jury yields to the greatest extent possible. COVID-19 
impacted the courts ability to hold in-person trials and the number of jurors available to serve.  

bout the data 

This performance measure requires a count of the total number of summonses sent to prospective jurors, the number of jurors postponed to or from a 
previous period, the number of jurors who failed to appear for jury duty, the number of jury summonses returned undeliverable, the number of jurors

9.  Employee Retention Rate 
Annual employee turnover rate. 

ur strategy 

bout the targets 

Our target is to have a retention rate with no greater annual turnover than 
the State of Oregon’s Department of Administrative Service (DAS) annual 
retention rate. The target rate may adjust if the DAS calculated rate rises 
significantly above 88 percent in the future. 

ow we are doing and how we compare 

In 2022, OJD’s retention rate was 83 percent, a decrease from the prior 
year. OJD has consistently met or exceeded the national average of 83 
percent for government jobs as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  

actors affecting results and what needs to be done 

Two-thirds of our turnover was due to voluntary resignations. We continue 
to analyze the specific reasons for the voluntary resignations. Additionally, 
retirements accounted for over 18 percent of our turnover. We will continue to collect data from exiting employees and analyze their reasons for 
leaving as part of our strategy to maintain a well-trained and stable workforce.

7.  Specialty Courts - Justice System Reinvolvement   
The percentage of treatment court graduates with no misdemeanor or felony charges filed in Oregon circuit courts

ur strategy 

Specialty courts are an alternative to traditional justice system processing for individuals with behavioral health issues who have repeatedly 
become involved with the justice system. Participants are empowered through trauma informed, non-stigmatizing services focused on  
prevention, identification, treatment, and recovery. Specialty Courts serve 
historically underserved individuals and reduce future involvement with the 
justice system. 
  
About the targets 
The Oregon Judicial Department (OJD) has established an aspirational goal 
of 90 percent of specialty court graduates having no new felony or 
misdemeanor charges within one year of graduation. The measure includes 
graduates from four types of specialty courts (adult drug courts, mental 
health courts, veteran’s treatment courts, DUII courts) that work 
specifically with defendants in criminal cases. 

ow we are doing and how we compare 

The most recent calendar year for which full data are available is 2020. 
Ninety-four percent of that year’s graduates did not have a new felony or 
misdemeanor charge filed within a year of graduation, which is above the 90 percent target. 

actors affecting results and what needs to be done 

OJD needs well-funded specialty courts with adequate support at both the statewide and local circuit court levels to continue its success in providing 
participants the tools to find and maintain long term recovery and avoid cycling back through the criminal justice system. The Office of the State

audit of the State of Oregon’s 
financial statements.  

The auditors performed a 
limited review of internal 
control and did not identify 
any deficiencies that were

Scope/What was found 

Response/Action 

The objective of the audit was to 
determine whether proper internal 
controls were in place and whether 
grant requirements were generally 
followed. We did not perform a full 
grant compliance audit as the 
Benton County government is the 
grant recipient and grant compliance 
was primarily their responsibility. 

The objective was to determine 
whether internal controls are 
properly designed to provide 
adequate fiscal controls and 
segregation of duties at the Polk 
County Circuit Court. 

The auditees agreed to 
implement all the 
recommendations. The 
internal auditor performed a 
follow up audit and found 
that all recommendations 
were either implemented or 
in the process of being 
implemented.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
