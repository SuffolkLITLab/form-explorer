he  Ci(cid:415)zen  Review  Board  (CRB)  is  a  program  within  the  Oregon  Judicial  Department  (OJD)  that 
reviews  the  cases  of  children  in  foster  care.  The  reviews  are  conducted  by  boards  made  up  of 
volunteers  from  the  community  who  are  appointed  by  the  Chief  Jus(cid:415)ce  of  the  Oregon  Supreme 
Court and facilitated by a team of professional staﬀ. Currently, there are 59 boards in 33 of Oregon’s 
36 coun(cid:415)es and about 250 volunteers serving on them statewide. 

t  the  (cid:415)me  the  United  States  Congress  passed  the  Adop(cid:415)on  Assistance  and  Child  Welfare  Act  of 
1980,  there  was  a  huge  spike  in  the  number  of  children  entering  foster  care  na(cid:415)onwide.  Families 
were  not  receiving  suﬃcient  services  and  there  were  no  guidelines  for  how  long  children  could 
spend  in  foster  care.  This  landmark  legisla(cid:415)on  set  numerous  requirements  regarding  keeping 
children  out  of  foster  care  and  permanency  planning  for  those  in  foster  care.  One  of  the 
requirements was that the case of every child in foster care be reviewed at least every 6 months. 

nspired by the success of the ﬁrst ci(cid:415)zen foster care review program in South Carolina, a prominent 
corporate a(cid:425)orney turned rural Trappist monk named Father Paschal Phillips set out to bring ci(cid:415)zen 
review  to  Oregon.  He  and  about  20  other  child  advocates  formed  The  Commi(cid:425)ee  for  Oregon 
Families that dra(cid:332)ed legisla(cid:415)on to create the CRB.  In 1985, the Legisla(cid:415)ve Assembly passed House 
Bill 2333 establishing Oregon’s ci(cid:415)zen foster care review program.  

y 1987, CRB had boards in almost every county in the state. Those early boards and the staﬀ who 
supported them played a signiﬁcant role in shaping policies and laws that ensured the state had a 
speciﬁc goal for each family it served, there was an early case planning mee(cid:415)ng that included the 
child’s  en(cid:415)re  family  network,  and  that  parents  were  provided  wri(cid:425)en  service  agreements  with 
concrete expecta(cid:415)ons of both the parents and the state. 

n  Oregon,  CRB  and  the  courts  share  responsibility  for  conduc(cid:415)ng  the  6‐month  reviews.  Ci(cid:415)zens 
bring  an  independent,  diverse,  and  common  sense  perspec(cid:415)ve  to  foster  care  cases.  They  provide 
transparency and public oversight to a system that is largely closed due to the conﬁden(cid:415)al nature of 
the cases and a review environment that is typically less formal than a court hearing, o(cid:332)en resul(cid:415)ng 
in more meaningful par(cid:415)cipa(cid:415)on from youth, parents, and resource parents. 

oday,  CRB  con(cid:415)nues  to  be  an  important  check  and  balance  on  the  child  welfare  system.  At  each 
review, boards assess whether the child welfare agency is complying with policies and laws that are 
cri(cid:415)cally  important  to  the  safety,  permanency,  and  well‐being  of  children  in  foster  care.  For 
example,  they  verify  whether  caseworkers  are  visi(cid:415)ng  children  in  the  foster  home  to  ensure  the 
home is safe, whether parents and children are receiving the services recommended in their various 
assessments, and whether older youth have plans in place to help prepare them for independence.

37 Years of Advocacy 

Since its incep(cid:415)on, CRB has conducted more than 220,000 reviews of children in foster care and has 
educated thousands of ci(cid:415)zen volunteers on the inner‐workings of the child welfare system. It has 
been involved in the development of almost every state child welfare policy created and legisla(cid:415)on 
passed  since  1985,  and  con(cid:415)nues  to  provide  ci(cid:415)zens  a  pla(cid:414)orm  from  which  to  improve  how  their 
community serves its most vulnerable children and families. 

The Strategic Planning Process 

CRB started its strategic planning process in January 2022 by asking all of its boards to iden(cid:415)fy up to 
3 focus areas for CRB through December 2024. They were challenged to develop a focus statement 
for each of the following categories: 

1. A large statewide issue aﬀec(cid:415)ng the foster care system,
2. A more speciﬁc statewide issue that CRB can meaningfully impact, and
3. A local issue related to CRB that they would like to see improved.

Boards across the state submi(cid:425)ed 196 focus statements for considera(cid:415)on. As expected, there were 
many similari(cid:415)es in what boards wanted to work on and CRB staﬀ were able to consolidate the ideas 
into a master list of 21 overall categories. 

In  May  2022,  15  CRB  staﬀ,  8  volunteer  board  members  who  also  serve  on  the  CRB  Advisory 
Commi(cid:425)ee,  and  6  addi(cid:415)onal  volunteer  board  members  from  coun(cid:415)es  not  represented  on  the 
Commi(cid:425)ee  met  in  Salem  to  priori(cid:415)ze  the  focus  areas  and  develop  implementa(cid:415)on  plans  for  the 
highest priority items. The following strategic plan is the result of that work. 

A BIG thank you is owed to all the CRB staﬀ and volunteers who par(cid:415)cipated in this process as well 
as our external stakeholders who reviewed dra(cid:332)s of the plan and provided their feedback. We can’t 
wait to get started!  

Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI)

The  legisla(cid:415)on  establishing  CRB  required,  as  far  as  prac(cid:415)cable,  members  of  each  local  CRB  shall 
represent  the  various  socioeconomic  and  ethnic  groups  of  the  area  served  (ORS  419A.092). 
Addi(cid:415)onally,  inclusiveness  and  trea(cid:415)ng  others  with  dignity  and  respect  have  been  part  of  our 
statement  of  values  for  decades  and  our  last  strategic  plan  included  14  speciﬁc  ac(cid:415)on  items  to 
improve engagement of par(cid:415)es in reviews and recognize and mi(cid:415)gate the eﬀects of bias. 

CRB  has  made  progress  in  these  areas  through  implementa(cid:415)on  of  those  ac(cid:415)on  items,  trainings, 
engagement  of  EDI  professionals,  building  rela(cid:415)onships  with  communi(cid:415)es,  and  making  reviews 
more accessible through virtual par(cid:415)cipa(cid:415)on. The last few years have widely introduced the concept 
of equity and advanced our understanding of what diversity and inclusion mean. We s(cid:415)ll have much 
to do. CRB is commi(cid:425)ed to fully implemen(cid:415)ng  the  OJD  Equity  Framework in our CRB reviews and 
program improvement eﬀorts. The goals, strategies, and ac(cid:415)on items within this plan will con(cid:415)nue 
to move us towards a more equitable, diverse, and inclusive CRB.

CRB 

Oregon’s Foster Care Review Board 

Our Vision 

Ci(cid:415)zens will shape public policy and ac(cid:415)vely 
promote condi(cid:415)ons to ensure that every 
child lives in a safe, secure, healthy, and 
permanent home, preserving families 
whenever possible. 

Our Mission 

We provide a ci(cid:415)zen voice on the safety, 
stability, and supervision of children in 
foster care through impar(cid:415)al case 
review and advocacy. 

We Value 

A fair, impar(cid:415)al and inclusive review process. 

Ci(cid:415)zen input and advocacy. 

Trea(cid:415)ng others with dignity and respect. 

State accountability for the safety of children. 

Appropriate and (cid:415)mely services for children 

and families. 

A safe and nurturing family for every child. 

5 

Goal 1: Increase recogni(cid:415)on of the impacts that ci(cid:415)zen 
input  and  advocacy  have  on  the  safety,  permanency, 
and well‐being of children in foster care. 

Strategy 1a: Increase awareness of who we are and what we do. 

Oregon  law  requires  CRB  to  recruit  volunteers  from  groups  with  special  knowledge  or  interest  in 
child  welfare  and,  as  stated  previously,  ensure  its  boards  are  representa(cid:415)ve  of  the  various 
socioeconomic and ethnic groups of the area served (ORS 419A.092). The law also requires volunteer 
board  members  to  complete  a  16‐hour  orienta(cid:415)on  training  before  they  can  serve,  and  receive  8 
hours of addi(cid:415)onal training annually. 

CRB  has  seen  posi(cid:415)ve  results  from  eﬀorts  to  focus  board  member  recruitment  on  groups  that  are 
underrepresented  on  boards.  We  have  worked  hard  to  transform  our  culture  to  empower  board 
members to make ﬁndings they feel are deserved, even when it’s hard; and equipped our staﬀ and 
volunteers  with  training  and  tools  to  hold  county  ODHS  oﬃces  accountable  for  implemen(cid:415)ng 
statewide  child  welfare  administra(cid:415)ve  rules  and  procedures  that  are  key  to  ensuring  the  safety, 
permanency, and well‐being of children in foster care. 

We updated our volunteer orienta(cid:415)on training with 5 addi(cid:415)onal hours of web‐based homework on 
race,  gender,  domes(cid:415)c  violence,  addic(cid:415)on,  trauma,  and  resilience  as  well  as  two  new  mock 
dependency cases for volunteers to prac(cid:415)ce conduc(cid:415)ng culturally responsive reviews. We partnered 
with ODHS and others to bring monthly online trainings to CRB staﬀ and volunteers on child welfare 
administra(cid:415)ve  rules  and  procedures,  applicable  laws  and  appellate  decisions,  services  in  the 
community, and experiences of children and families involved in the system. 

CRB has made many important improvements and it’s (cid:415)me to get the word out!

Ac(cid:415)on Items 

Year 1 

 Use  the  OJD  Equity  Framework  to  help  us  understand  how  discrimina(cid:415)on  and 
oppression operate within our program generally and in our volunteer recruitment and 
reten(cid:415)on eﬀorts speciﬁcally. 

 Prepare  county  and  state  demographic  informa(cid:415)on  for  both  the  general  popula(cid:415)on 

and children in subs(cid:415)tute care. 

 Develop speciﬁc goals for recrui(cid:415)ng volunteers from groups that are underrepresented 
on  boards.  Consider  socioeconomic,  ethnic,  sexual  orienta(cid:415)on,  gender  iden(cid:415)ty,  and  
language diversity as well as tribes, individuals who iden(cid:415)fy as having a disability, and 
persons with lived experience as a child in foster care, parent of a child in foster care, 
and resource parent. 

 Develop  and  implement  a  coordinated  statewide  volunteer  recruitment  plan  that 
u(cid:415)lizes  marke(cid:415)ng  professionals  where  appropriate  and  can  be  sustained  over  (cid:415)me.  
Consider  dedica(cid:415)ng  at  least  part  of  a  CRB  staﬀ  person  to  this  eﬀort  as  well  as  using 
exis(cid:415)ng volunteers to help communicate our message. 

 Provide  informa(cid:415)on  to  community  stakeholders  about  who  we  are  and  how  our 

reviews can support implementa(cid:415)on of their own priori(cid:415)es. 

Year 3 

 Ensure our vision, mission, and values align with current expecta(cid:415)ons and prac(cid:415)ces. 

Strategy 1b: Improve reten(cid:415)on of exis(cid:415)ng volunteers. 

On  December  3,  2021,  48%  of  CRB  volunteers  were  either  currently  employed  or  re(cid:415)red  from 
occupa(cid:415)ons  in  educa(cid:415)on,  health  care,  social  work,  or  law.  Twenty‐three  percent  of  boards  had  a 
member who iden(cid:415)ﬁed as an ethnicity other than Caucasian, 26% had a member who was age 35 or 
younger, and 32% had a member with an annual income of less than $35,000. While CRB does not 
collect sta(cid:415)s(cid:415)cs on any history our volunteers have with the foster system, anecdotal reports suggest 
many have personally touched the system in some capacity either as a child in foster care, parent of 
a  child  in  foster  care,  resource  parent,  or  adop(cid:415)ve  parent.  Anecdotal  reports  also  suggest 
representa(cid:415)on of the LGBTQ+ community on a number of boards. 

In 2021, CRB volunteers collec(cid:415)vely donated 24,598 hours of service to the state preparing for and 
conduc(cid:415)ng  2,880  reviews  involving  3,943  children  and  young  adults  in  foster  care,  and  spent  an 
addi(cid:415)onal 3,353 hours in trainings on topics important to the cases they review. While recruitment is 
important, reten(cid:415)on of our skilled volunteers (and staﬀ) is actually what makes our program healthy 
and impac(cid:414)ul. Currently, our volunteers serve an average of 6 years. This is an impressive number, 
par(cid:415)cularly  considering  the  worldwide  events  of  the  last  2  years;  but,  we  can  do  even  be(cid:425)er 
suppor(cid:415)ng and retaining our excep(cid:415)onal volunteers and staﬀ. 

7 

Ac(cid:415)on Items 

Year 2 

 Enhance community and unity of purpose amongst volunteers and staﬀ by  establishing 
training  cohorts  as  well  as  facilita(cid:415)ng  observa(cid:415)ons  of  CRB  reviews  in  other  coun(cid:415)es 
(i.e., peer reviews) and mul(cid:415)‐county mee(cid:415)ngs and collabora(cid:415)ons. 

 Create more opportuni(cid:415)es to recognize and show apprecia(cid:415)on for our volunteers. 

 Con(cid:415)nue  eﬀorts  to  make  volunteering  for  CRB  more  accessible  by  oﬀering  part‐(cid:415)me 
schedules, remote par(cid:415)cipa(cid:415)on, working with employers to support volunteering, and 
upda(cid:415)ng our policy for reimbursement of volunteer expenses. 

 Work  with  local  ODHS  oﬃces  and  courts  to  increase  implementa(cid:415)on  of  CRB 
recommenda(cid:415)ons  and  address  areas  of  concern.  It  is  very  discouraging  for  CRB 
volunteers when they review a case and discover that one or more recommenda(cid:415)ons 
from the last CRB review were not implemented. This can impact reten(cid:415)on. 

Strategy 1c: Improve our data collec(cid:415)on and sharing. 

CRB  has  been  collec(cid:415)ng  data  on  our  ﬁndings  for  a  decade. While interes(cid:415)ng, the data wasn’t very  
ac(cid:415)onable  un(cid:415)l  recently.  We  could  tell  someone  how  many  (cid:415)mes  boards  found  the  child  welfare 
agency  had  not  ensured  the  safety,  health,  and  well‐being  of  a  child,  was  not  making  reasonable 
eﬀorts to reunify the family, and/or was not in compliance with the case plan or court orders; but, 
we  couldn’t  tell  them  why  without  pulling  reports  and  doing  a  hand  count.  That  changed  in  April 
2019 when we started collec(cid:415)ng data on the reasons ﬁndings were made, presence of a(cid:425)orneys at 
reviews,  implementa(cid:415)on  of  recommenda(cid:415)ons  from  the  prior  CRB  review,  and  applicability  of  the 
Indian  Child  Welfare  Act  (ICWA).  Since  that  (cid:415)me,  CRB  has  been  compiling  this  data  into  quarterly 
reports that are regularly sent to all CRB ﬁeld staﬀ and volunteers on the CRB Advisory Commi(cid:425)ee. 

CRB  has  a  lot  of  great  data  now.  Our  next  challenges  are:  what  are  we  going  to  do  with  it,  and  is 
there other informa(cid:415)on we need? 

Ac(cid:415)on Items 

Year 2 

 Evaluate  the  impact  of  CRB.  Explore  the  impact  of  CRB  on  compliance  with  key  child 

welfare administra(cid:415)ve rules and procedures. 

 Start collec(cid:415)ng addi(cid:415)onal data on CRB volunteers to be(cid:425)er highlight the diversity that 

our volunteers bring to case reviews. 

 Update  the  CRB  [Volunteer]  Exit  Interview  form  to  include  both  quan(cid:415)ta(cid:415)ve  and 

qualita(cid:415)ve ques(cid:415)ons. Start repor(cid:415)ng compiled results on a regular schedule. 

 Improve  and  standardize  data  sharing  between  CRB  and  stakeholder  agencies  and 

organiza(cid:415)ons. 

8 

Goal  2:  Improve the safety and stability of foster care 
placements. 

Strategy 2a: Strengthen CRB inquiry around placement safety, suitability, 
support, and transi(cid:415)ons. 

In 2021, ci(cid:415)zen review boards statewide found in 9% of the children reviewed (337 of 3,943), ODHS 
had not ensured that appropriate services were in place to safeguard the child’s safety, health, and 
well‐being.  Ten  percent  of  the  (cid:415)me  (35  of  337),  the  nega(cid:415)ve  ﬁndings  were  due  at  least  in  part  to 
concerns about appropriateness of a placement and 7% (23 of 337) to concerns about the number of 
placement changes. 

Children  who  must  be  removed  from  their  homes  for  their  protec(cid:415)on  are  owed  placements 
appropriate  enough  for  them  to  thrive.  We  also  know  how  mul(cid:415)ple  placement  changes  impact 
children—permanency  is  delayed  and  well‐being  is  aﬀected  in  mul(cid:415)ple  ways,  including  poorer 
educa(cid:415)onal outcomes due to changing schools and increased behavioral and mental health issues.1 

Ac(cid:415)on Items 

Year 2 

 Use  the  OJD  Equity  Framework  to  examine  CRB  processes  for  ensuring  safety  and 

stability of foster care placements. 

 Start tracking child, parent, and resource parent a(cid:425)endance at CRB reviews. 

 Research  what  and  how  informa(cid:415)on  about  CRB  is  being  communicated  to  children, 

parents, and resource parents by system stakeholders. 

9 

 Improve  child,  parent,  and  resource  parent  a(cid:425)endance  and  par(cid:415)cipa(cid:415)on  at  CRB 

reviews.  

 Update  ques(cid:415)oning  guides  for  CRB  Finding  2  (eﬀorts  to  place  with  a  rela(cid:415)ve)  and 
Finding 3A (appropriate services to safeguard the child’s safety, health, and well‐being).  
Ensure  ques(cid:415)ons  address  child  input  in  placement  decisions,  supports  provided  to 
resource  parents  including  ODHS  communica(cid:415)on  with  them,  early  iden(cid:415)ﬁca(cid:415)on  of

transi(cid:415)ons. Consult the federal Child and Family Services Reviews (CFSR) Onsite Review 
Instrument and other exis(cid:415)ng sources for possible ques(cid:415)ons. 

 Provide  training  to  CRB  staﬀ  and  volunteers  to  coincide  with  roll‐out  of  the  updated 

ques(cid:415)oning guides. 

Strategy  2b:  Reinstate  CRB  reviews  of  children  in  trial  reuniﬁca(cid:415)on 
placements. 

CRB stopped reviewing children in trial reuniﬁca(cid:415)on placements with their parents in October 2012. 
This came at a (cid:415)me when CRB was trying to reduce its reviews a(cid:332)er some diﬃcult budget reduc(cid:415)ons 
and  layoﬀs.  Since  then,  the  responsibility  for  keeping  these  cases  in  compliance  with  the  federal 
periodic  review  requirement  has  fallen  en(cid:415)rely  on  the  courts.  CRB  staﬀ  and  volunteers  have  been 
no(cid:415)cing  some  overly  long  gaps  between  reviews  when  children  have  returned  to  an  out‐of‐home 
placement  a(cid:332)er  a  disrupted  trial  reuniﬁca(cid:415)on.  This  has  prompted  renewed  calls  within  CRB  to 
reinstate our reviews of these cases. 

Ac(cid:415)on Items 

Year 1 

 Complete an analysis of periodic review compliance in the 2021 calendar year. 

 Obtain  a  legal  opinion  to  determine  whether  current  Oregon  law  authorizes  CRB  to 

review children in trial reuniﬁca(cid:415)on placements. If yes:  

 Determine  whether  updates  are  needed  in  the  analysis  of  some  CRB  ﬁndings 

when reviewing children in trial reuniﬁca(cid:415)on placements. 

 Update  sec(cid:415)on  2.5  in  the  ODHS/CRB  Memorandum  of  Understanding  and 
coordinate with courts and external stakeholders to iden(cid:415)fy a date for reinsta(cid:415)ng 
the CRB reviews. 

Year 3 

 Complete another analysis of periodic review compliance in 3 years.

Goal  3:  Improve  access  to  mental  and  behavioral 
health  services  for  Oregon’s  most  vulnerable  children 
and families. 

Concerns  about  mental  health/therapeu(cid:415)c  support  (mostly  (cid:415)meliness  of  the  service)  is  the  most 
common  reason  why  boards  ﬁnd  ODHS  has  not  ensured  appropriate  services  are  in  place  to 
safeguard the child’s safety, health, and well‐being. In 2021, those concerns were part of 32% of the 
nega(cid:415)ve ﬁndings (108 of 337). Oregon is experiencing signiﬁcant shortages in mental and behavioral 
health  services  that  are  being  addressed  on  a  number  of  fronts.  Through  our  ﬁndings,  CRB  has  an 
opportunity to highlight gaps and needs in these services for families involved in the foster system.   

Strategy 3a: Strengthen CRB inquiry around availability, accessibility, and 
(cid:415)meliness  of  mental  and  behavioral  health  services  for  children  and 
parents. 

Ac(cid:415)on Items 

Year 2 

 Use  the  OJD  Equity  Framework  to  examine  CRB  processes  for  determining  whether 
children  and  parents  are  provided  appropriate  mental  and  behavioral  health  services 
when they are needed. 

 Provide  local  training  to  CRB  volunteers  on  mental  and  behavioral  health  services 

available in the community they serve. 

Year 3 

 Develop procedures to obtain informa(cid:415)on about mental and behavioral health needs 
and  services  when  the  case  material  submi(cid:425)ed  for  a  review  excludes  that 

11 

informa(cid:415)on or provides insuﬃcient detail. 

 Research  child  welfare  administra(cid:415)ve  rules  and  procedures  for  children  and  parents 
having  an  emergency  mental  or  behavioral  health  crisis.  Develop  guidelines  for 
consistent analysis of these eﬀorts during reviews. 

 Develop  a  training  for  CRB  staﬀ  and  volunteers  on  asking  ques(cid:415)ons  and  making 
recommenda(cid:415)ons  about  mental  and  behavioral  health  services.    Include  informa(cid:415)on 
on  communica(cid:415)ng  eﬀec(cid:415)vely  with  youth  and  parents  during  reviews,  how  to  verify 
needs  are  assessed  and  appropriate  services  are  provided  promptly  (par(cid:415)cularly  for 
children),  and  when  and  how  to  appropriately  recommend  alterna(cid:415)ve  therapeu(cid:415)c 
services. 

 Collect and transmit data on mental and behavioral health service delays, needs, and 
barriers to Oregon’s Coordinated Care Organiza(cid:415)ons and others who can systemically 
impact those services.

Goal 4: Improve outcomes for teens and young adults 
in foster care. 

ccording to the Oregon Child Welfare Data Set, there were 1,167 Oregon teens and young adults 
age  15  and  older  in  foster  care  on  March  31,  2022.  One  hundred  and  thirty  seven  of  them  (12%) 
lived in a supervised independent living se(cid:427)ng and 461 of them (39%) had 6 or more placements.  
Addi(cid:415)onally, 272 youth age 18 and older exited foster care (i.e., aged out) in the 2021 calendar year.  
These,  however,  are  just  numbers.  They  tell  us  nothing  about  the  hopes,  strengths,  challenges, 
individuality, and connectedness of the young people behind them. The things that truly ma(cid:425)er. 

RB reviews are doors to the more meaningful details. They are an addi(cid:415)onal opportunity for youth 
and their team to advocate for their needs, and one more check and balance to ensure those needs 
are met.  A strength of CRB is our detailed inquiry into the safety, health, and well‐being of the child. 
Our  program  is  well  posi(cid:415)oned  to  posi(cid:415)vely  impact  outcomes  for  teens  and  young  adults  by 
improving our reviews and holding the state more accountable to serving them.   

Strategy 4a: Make CRB ﬁndings more applicable in cases involving teens 
and young adults, par(cid:415)cularly those living independently. 

  A

  C

Ac(cid:415)on Items 

Year 2 

 Use the OJD Equity Framework to examine CRB processes for reviewing cases of teens 

and young adults in foster care. 

 Convene  an  interdisciplinary  focus  group  to  discuss  and  advise  how  the  CRB  ﬁndings 
should be applied in cases involving teens 14 to 17 years old and young adults 18 to 21 
years old.  Ensure foster youth are represented on the group.  

 Create a technical assistance guide or guides for reviews of teens and young adults. 

13 

 Assess  the  value  of  crea(cid:415)ng  specialized  CRB  Case  Notes  Sheets  to  assist  volunteer 
board members in preparing for and conduc(cid:415)ng reviews of teens and young adults. 

Strategy 4b: Oﬀer trainings on topics aﬀec(cid:415)ng teens and young adults in 
foster care. 

Ac(cid:415)on Items 

Provide training to CRB staﬀ and volunteers on the following topics: 

Year 1 

 Lived‐experience of foster youth including those who may have experienced placement 

in a residen(cid:415)al treatment facility, 

 Independent Living Program (ILP), 

Disabili(cid:415)es (I/DD) services, 

Year 2 

 ODHS teen policy requirements, 

 Reviewing youth on runaway status, 

 Self‐selected environments, and 

 Cases involving teens and young adults who qualify for Intellectual and Developmental 

 Standards for ensuring safety of young adults, par(cid:415)cularly those living independently, 

 Services and opportuni(cid:415)es available to young adults 18 to 21 years old who remain in 

subs(cid:415)tute care. 

Strategy 4c: Increase accountability for serving teens and young adults. 

Ac(cid:415)on Items 

Year 2 

 Iden(cid:415)fy key benchmarks and milestones in cases involving teens and young adults and 

follow up on them during CRB reviews. 

 Explore ways to improve how CRB no(cid:415)ﬁes teens and young adults of reviews. 

 Build  rela(cid:415)onships  between  local  boards  and  ILP  providers  to  increase  youth  and  ILP 
worker par(cid:415)cipa(cid:415)on in CRB reviews.  Consider changing CRB conﬁden(cid:415)ality prac(cid:415)ces so 
ILP providers can receive a copy of the board schedule. 

 Share with local model court teams the work CRB is doing to improve reviews of teens 

and young adults.
