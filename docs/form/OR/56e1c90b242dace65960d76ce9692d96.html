      <pre>VISION
Oregon Courts: Equal Justice in the 21st Century

In the 21st century, Oregon's courts lead the nation in providing fair,

preserve judicial discretion, and secure
adequate resources to do our work.  The
judicial branch and each local court
have a strategic plan to implement our
unified vision and measure our progress.

integrated state court system, promotes
efficient statewide improvement, and

to provide everyone with easy access to

a network of excellent, culturally

As a result, people take responsibility to

resolve their disputes peacefully, often

without going to court.  Well informed

measures and effective sentencing to

reduce criminal behavior.

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
