Introduction 
The focus of this brochure is preparing for and com-
pleting the trial in your family law case. Family law 
cases include cases such as divorce and custody. A 
family law case is started when one person, the 
“petitioner,” files a petition asking the court for spe-
cific things, like custody of their child or children or 
division of property. If the other person, the 
“respondent,” files a response, it means that the case 
is contested. The petitioner and respondent are also 
referred to as “a party” or ”the parties” in a case. 
When one of the parties is not represented by a law-
yer, that person is referred to as a “self represented 
litigant” or “pro se litigant.” 

If you have minor children and have not agreed on a 
parenting plan, most courts will expect you to partici-
pate in mediation. 

Parent education and mediation 
If you have minor children, many courts require that 
you participate in a co-parenting education class. 
There should be a notice of that requirement at-
tached to the papers you received. Check with your 
local court about this requirement if you have ques-
tions, lose the notice, or never got a notice. You can-
not finalize your case until you satisfy this require-
ment. 

If you have minor children and have not agreed on a 
parenting plan, most courts will also expect you to 
participate in mediation. Mediation is a process of 
sitting down with a neutral, trained third party to 
attempt to work out issues such as custody and par-
enting time. Many custody and parenting time cases 

resolve in mediation without the need for a trial, 
which is often good for the parents and children. In 
some circumstances, mediation can be “waived” (not 
required) by the court, such as when one party has a 
restraining order against the other. Some courts may 
require that you attempt to resolve the entire case 
by mediation or arbitration (a lawyer acting as the 
judge) before the judge will hear your trial. Check 
with the clerk of the court where the case is filed to 
learn about these requirements. 

Finding family law statutes and 
court rules 
The main family laws are contained in the Oregon 
Revised Statutes (ORS), Chapters 107-109. There are 
also rules of evidence, supplementary local rules, 
and rules of civil procedure that apply to your case.  

Law library 

You can find copies of the family law statutes and 
other court rules at your county law library. The law 
librarian can help you find the books you want and 
explain how to use the books. The law librarian can-
not give you legal advice. If you want to copy any of 
the materials in the library, bring money in small 
bills to pay for the copies. The law library cannot 
make change for large bills.

You can also find the family law statutes, court rules, 
and local rules online on a variety of websites:

General information about  
divorce and custody trials 

What is a trial?  

A trial is a hearing before a judge. The judge listens 
to testimony, reviews physical evidence or docu-
ments and makes decisions regarding the issues that 
are in dispute. There is no jury in a divorce or family 
law trial. The reason a trial is held is because you 
and the other party cannot agree on all the issues. At 
the trial, the judge will hear from both parties to 
gather information in order to decide child custody, 
parenting time, child and spousal/partner support 
(alimony), responsibility for debts, and property di-
vision. 

Trials are open to the public. Consider watching a 
trial to familiarize yourself with the trial process. 
You may view your county’s eCourt calendars at 
https://www.courts.oregon.gov/services/online/
Pages/records-calendars.aspx or by calling your 
local court.  

If your case is scheduled for trial, you should confirm 
your trial is going forward the afternoon before your 
trial is scheduled as trials are often rescheduled at 
the last minute. 

Why was my case set for trial? 

Unless both parties can come to an agreement on 
their own or through the assistance of a mediator, 
the case will go to trial. The trial may be set even as 
the parties are working on an agreement. At the trial, 
a judge will hear both parties and then decide the 
issues in the case. There are two types of trials avail-
able, which will be discussed later in this  
brochure. 

 

Each court may have a different process for the par-
ties to obtain a trial date. Some courts may automati-
cally set a court date or send information to the par-
ties on how to set a trial date after a response is 
filed, whereas others may require a party to request 
a trial date or a court hearing to move the case for-
ward. It is important to check with the clerk at your 
local circuit court to understand how to obtain a trial 
date in your case. 

Two different types of trials are  
available for resolving domestic  
relations cases. The two types of trials 
are called Informal Domestic Relations 
Trial and traditional trial.  

Can you reschedule a trial date? 

If your case is set for trial and you do not appear at 
the trial, the other party may receive everything they 
requested. If there is a serious reason why you can-
not proceed to trial on the scheduled date, you will 
be required to file a written request with the court to 
ask that your trial be postponed or set over. A copy 
of all communications with the court must be sent to 
the other party. The request will be forwarded to a 
judge for review. If the judge approves the request to 
reschedule, a new trial date will be set. If you have 
not received confirmation from the court that your 
request was approved, you will be expected to ap-
pear at the originally scheduled trial date and time. 
You may call the court clerk in the days before the 
hearing to learn if your request was approved. 

What are the types of trials? 

Two different types of trials are available for resolv-
ing family law cases. The two types of trials are 
called Informal Domestic Relations Trial and tradi-
tional (or formal) trial. You will need to choose the 
type of trial that you think is best for your case. 

4  

These two options may also apply to modification 
hearings.  See Appendix E. 

For more information on choosing which type of tri-
al is right for your case, review the “Traditional trial 
vs. Informal Domestic Relations Trial” table below.  

Traditional trial 

In a traditional trial, parties usually present infor-
mation to the judge by testifying, asking questions of 
witnesses, and giving the judge documents or other 
evidence. Each side gets to ask follow-up questions 
(cross-examination) of the other person and their 
witnesses. The judge may have questions as well. 
The Rules of Evidence apply in a traditional trial. The 
rules place limits on the things a witness can talk 
about and the kind of documents that can be given to 
the judge to read. If you or the other person has a 
lawyer in a traditional trial, the lawyer will make 
opening statements and closing arguments to the 
judge and will ask questions of you, the other party, 
and other witnesses. If you represent yourself, you 
will be expected to follow the Rules of Evidence. You 
will be the one to make opening statements, closing 

arguments, questioning witnesses, and providing 
other evidence to the judge. See the “Finding family 
law statutes and court rules” section for information 
on how to find court rules. 

Informal Domestic Relations Trial  

In a Informal Domestic Relations Trial you and the 
other party speak directly to the judge about the is-
sues that are disputed, such as child custody and di-
viding property or debts. Only the judge asks ques-
tions of each person. This happens even if you or the 
other person has a lawyer. Usually, other witnesses 
are not allowed to testify. You can, however, ask the 
judge to let an expert witness testify, such as a doc-
tor, counselor, or custody evaluator, but even then, 
the judge will typically handle the questioning of the 
witness. 

The Rules of Evidence do not apply in an Informal 
Domestic Relations Trial. This means you can tell the 
judge anything that you think is important about the 
issues in your case, and the judge must decide what 
information to consider. You can also give the judge 
any documents or papers you want the judge to re-

Rules of

Documents 

The Rules of Evidence apply. These rules 
prohibit certain types of evidence from be-
ing admissible in court and they dictate 
how to present evidence in court.  

You will have to testify at trial. The other 
party (or their lawyer) can object to your 
testimony if it does not comply with rules of 
evidence. The other side can also cross-
examine you after you testify.  

The Rules of Evidence do not apply. Each party 
can talk to the judge freely and show the judge 
anything that they think is helpful to their case.  

You can talk freely to the judge about anything 
you think is helpful. The other side does not get 
to object to your testimony or cross-examine 
you.  

You will need most likely need to call wit-
nesses to testify in support of you. Your 
witnesses need to appear in person (or by 
phone, if permission is granted). Witnesses 
cannot write letters instead of testifying.  

Witnesses are generally not allowed to testify at 
an Informal Domestic Relations Trial, unless 
they are considered an “expert,” such as a doc-
tor, psychiatrist, or a therapist. You can offer 
letters from witnesses if you think it’s helpful. 

Any documents you want the judge to look 
at must be admissible under the rules of 
evidence and you will need to have a wit-
ness testify about the authenticity of each 
document before showing it to the judge. 

Since the rules of evidence do not apply, you 
can show the judge anything that you think is 
helpful to your case. You do not have to worry 
about whether the document is admissible un-
der the rules of evidence.

view. The judge will decide the importance of what 
you and the other person say and the papers you 
each give to the judge. In an Informal Domestic Rela-
tions Trial, lawyers are only allowed to say what the 
issues in the case are, respond when the judge asks if 
there are other areas their client wants the court to 
have information about, and make short arguments 
about the law at the end of the case. 

The Informal Domestic Relations Trial is a voluntary 
process. In other words, you decide whether it is 
something you want to do. An Informal Domestic 
Relations Trial will only be used if both people in-
volved in the case agree to it. Both people must com-
plete a form that says what type of trial they choose. 

How do you prepare your case for trial? 

At the trial, you will need to “prove your case” to the 
judge. “Your case” is your reasoning about why the 
judge should grant you the things you are requesting 
(relief), such as custody, child support, or supervised 
parenting time. To prove your case, you will need to 
supply evidence in the form of your testimony, wit-
nesses, documents, photographs, etc. that support 
your request. Your own testimony is usually the best 
piece of evidence in a case.  

For more information about what you need to prove 
at trial, refer to the following appendices: 

•  Child Custody and Parenting Time (Appendix A)  

•  Child Support (Appendix B) 

•  Spousal Support (Appendix C) 

•  Division of Property and Debts (Appendix D) 

•  Modification of Custody, Parenting Time, Child 
Support, or Spousal Support (Appendix E) 

One of the most difficult tasks in preparing your case 
is gathering the information you need to present to 
the judge. Whether you will have an Informal Do-
mestic Relations Trial or a traditional trial, you 
should prepare for your case by going through each 
issue the parties disagree on, identifying what you 
want the judge to know about each issue, and gath-

ering the evidence and witnesses to support your 
requests.  

You may need written evidence to prove your case. 
This can include photos, pay stubs, income tax re-
turns, bank and credit card statements, proof of 
medical insurance for the children, medical bills, oth-
er bills and debts, pension or retirement plan docu-
ments, or letters from the other party discussing is-
sues important to your case. 

You have the right to get information and documents 
from the other party. This process is called “discovery.” 

All of the information you provide to the judge must 
be relevant to the issues. In general, the judge will 
focus on making a plan for the future, not punishing 
parties for things they did in the past.  

Gathering information and the  
discovery process 

You have the right to request documents from the 
other party. This process is called “discovery,” and it 
must be completed before trial.  

The easiest way to request documents from the oth-
er party is to serve a Discovery Notice on the other 
side. This form is found online at: https://
www.courts.oregon.gov/forms/Documents/
DiscoveryNotice.pdf.  

You must give the other party 30 days to respond to 
your request (or 45 days if you serve the request 
with your initial petition). If there are other docu-
ments you think you may need, you can add addi-
tional requests to this list. For example, if you have 

6  

concerns about the other party’s alcohol consump-
tion, you may want to request records relating to any 
alcohol treatment programs they have participated 
in. Or, if you have concerns about the safety of the 
other party’s home, you could request photos of 
their home.  

If the other party refuses to provide documents or 
does not respond within the time allowed, you 
should contact them to ask if they are going to give 
you the information. If they refuse or still do not re-
spond, you can file a “Motion to Compel Production” 
with the court. This is a request to the judge explain-
ing what you need and why the information is rele-
vant. The judge might then order them to provide 
the documents. 

If you or any of your witnesses need an interpreter, 
have difficulty hearing, or have other special needs, the 
court can provide accommodations. 

Disability accommodations and  
interpretation services 

If you or any of your witnesses has limited English 
proficiency and needs an interpreter or has disabili-
ties and needs a reasonable accommodation, the 
court can provide certain accommodations, such as a 
certified interpreter or electronic devices to help 
hear what is happening. If you or your witnesses 
need an interpreter or an accommodation, you 
should notify the court as soon as possible prior to 
the hearing. In some counties, the court may have to 
make special arrangements for interpreters to travel 
from other counties.  

You do not have to pay for interpreters or hearing 
assistive devices. The courts will provide these ser-
vices for free.  

Can you contact the judge about  
your case? 

The judge cannot speak to you about your case ex-
cept in the presence of the other party. This applies 
to written communications as well.  

Should my child testify? 

In most cases, a child is not a necessary witness. In-
stead, a child’s counselor can testify and bring the 
child’s concerns to court. Consider carefully before 
requiring a child to be a witness against the other 
parent. The experience can be very traumatic. It is 
possible that the things people talk about during the 
trial are not appropriate to be shared with your 
child. It may be best to leave the child at home with a 
babysitter or relative. While a judge cannot prohibit 
a party from calling a child to testify, it may hurt that 
party’s case more than it helps.  

If it necessary for a child to testify, the judge may 
handle their testimony differently than other wit-
nesses. A judge can exclude both parents from the 
courtroom, the judge may question the child them-
selves, the judge could talk to the child in their 
chambers (office), or the judge may require the par-
ents to stay in the courtroom to hear what the child 
has to say. You should also bring someone who can 
watch your child when they are not testifying. Until 
they testify, your child must wait outside the court-
room. A few courthouses have daycare available on 
site. Check with your local court for details.  

Preparing for an Informal  
Domestic Relations Trial 
Preparing for an Informal Domestic Relations Trial is 
easier than preparing for a traditional trial. In gen-
eral, you do not need to call witnesses. Instead, each 
party will have an opportunity to talk to the judge to 
explain their side. However, if there are experts in-
volved in your case, such as a doctor, counselor, or 
custody evaluator, it may be appropriate to have 

 7  

them come to court to provide “expert” witness  
testimony.  

Additionally, you do not have to present formal ex-
hibits to the judge. Instead, you may simply bring 
any documents that you think are important with 
you and then the judge will review the documents. 
For information on what type of documents you 
should gather, please refer to the appendices for 
each issue that is disputed in your case.   

During an informal trial, the judge will listen to what 
each party has to say and review each party’s docu-
ments. Then, the judge will decide the importance of 
the testimony and evidence presented and make a 
decision about the issues in the case.  

Preparing for a traditional trial 
Preparing for a traditional trial takes more time and 
preparation. If you know that you are having an In-
formal Domestic Relations Trial, you may skip ahead 
to the “What you need to know the day of trial”  
section.  

If you are having a traditional trial, you will have to 
follow the Oregon Rules of Evidence. These rules 
limit the evidence that can be considered by the 
judge. Everything you give the judge and that wit-
nesses say must be relevant and reliable to the is-
sues in your case. Relevant means that it speaks di-
rectly to one of the issues of the case. Reliable means 
that it comes from an official source (such as police 
reports, medical records, or school records) or that it 
is otherwise trustworthy.  

In a traditional trial, if you plan to show documents 
to the judge, you should make two copies of each 
original document. You should give a copy of all your 
documents to the other side at the beginning of trial, 
hand the originals to the court clerk, and then keep a 
copy for yourself to reference during trial.  

Collecting evidence 

In a traditional trial, you will need evidence for your 
trial. When evidence is presented at trial, each piece 
of evidence is referred to as an “exhibit.” Anytime 

you offer an exhibit at trial, you will need a witness 
to explain where the item came from, before offering 
the exhibit into evidence. It is best to print out your 
exhibits. Avoid bringing your evidence on your 
phone. Below are some common examples of evi-
dence you may use (also refer to the appendices for 
specific documents you should bring depending on 
the particular issues in your case): 

•  Written communications. You can bring 

emails, texts, Facebook messages, or other writ-
ten messages to or from you or the other party if 
it has to do with the issues in your case. You can-
not use written communications from third-
parties, unless that person appears in person to 
testify at your trial. The best way to present writ-
ten communications is to print them out. You 
will need to have a witness explain who sent the 
email, who received it, the date it was sent, and 
how they received it. 

•  Photographs. If you want to show the judge a 

photograph of something, you (or your witness) 
should explain who took the photo, when it was 
taken, where it was taken, and what is in the pho-
to and whether the photo accurately captures 
what you are trying to show. 

•  Police reports, medical records, and school 

records. You may bring original copies of official 
documents. Ask the police, hospital, or school to 
also give you a letter saying that the record is real 
(authentic). Explain what it is and where it came 
from before you give it to the judge.  

•  Financial records. You can bring bank records, 
retirement account records, credit card state-
ment, property deeds, or other financial docu-
ments. You should explain what each item is, how 
you got it, and explain what it shows.  

•  Uniform Support Declaration. A Uniform Sup-

port Declaration is a document that outlines your 
income, sources of income and your financial re-
sponsibilities. This document allows the judge to 
understand whether either party needs support 
and how much such support should be. If you or 

8  

the other party are requesting child or spousal 
support (or both), you should bring a copy of this 
document with you even if you have already pro-
vided it to the court. You may find the form here: 
https://www.courts.oregon.gov/forms/
Documents/Uniform%20Support%
20Declaration.pdf  

Note that the Rules of Evidence may limit what docu-
ments the judge is able to review.  

Labeling your exhibits 

In a traditional trial, the judge will require you to 
number each of your exhibits. Each separate exhibit 
should have its own number, with the petitioner 
having numbers 1-99 and the respondent, numbers 
101-199. You can get the stickers from court staff 
the day of trial. The number is just for tracking pur-
poses and it does not matter the order you refer to 
the exhibits. A bank statement containing multiple 
pages is a single exhibit and gets just one number, 
not one for each page. It may be a good idea to num-
ber the pages, especially with large documents, so 
that it is easy to find what you may need to present.  

For additional information, see https://
www.ncjfcj.org/10-Steps-Presenting-Evidence  

Witnesses are people, including yourself, with first-
hand knowledge about important things you need to 
prove in your case. For example, if custody of your 
child is contested (not agreed to by the parties), you 
must prove it is in the best interests of the child to be 
with you. People who have seen you interacting with 
your child and how well you take care of your child 
can help the judge make this decision.  

Witnesses can only testify about things that they 
personally saw or heard. If there is a witness to the 
other party’s abuse of you or your child, the judge 
will want to hear from that person. Make sure that a 
witness personally knows the information that is 
important to your case before you ask them to ap-
pear at trial. Talk to them first to find out what they 
know. Contact them well in advance of the trial so 

they can make arrangements to be available on that 
day. 

A witness’s background may affect the importance 
the judge gives to their testimony. Witnesses may 
have to disclose prior convictions and drug or alco-
hol problems to the judge. It is best to select a wit-
ness who is neutral, such as your child’s teachers or 
counselors, as they tend to be more believable than 
other witnesses, such as friends or family, who may 
have a bias for or against a party. 

Witnesses can only testify about things that they  
personally saw or heard.  

A party can request that witnesses be excluded from 
the courtroom. Some judges will automatically ex-
clude all witnesses. Excluding witnesses ensures that 
their testimony does not change based on the prior 
testimony of other witnesses. After a witness testi-
fies, they may remain in the courtroom.  

What types of questions should you ask  
a witness? 

When a witness testifies at a traditional trial, this 
testimony is done in a question and answer style in 
front of the judge. You ask the witness questions, one 
at a time, and then they answer each question. It 
might be helpful to write a list of questions to ask 
witnesses.  

 9  

Who can be a witness? 

Can witnesses stay in the courtroom? 

You can only ask witnesses questions about events 
they have observed directly. If a witness is consid-
ered a professional in a particular field, like a teach-
er or doctor, you may ask their professional opinion 
on a particular matter in their field of expertise. 

Ask your witnesses open-ended questions. The best 
questions are ones that start with when, why, what, 
who, where, who, and how. You should not ask lead-
ing questions, which are questions that prompt the 
witness to respond in a particular way or suggest the 
answer to the question.  

Ask your witnesses open-ended  
questions. The best questions are ones 
that start with when, why, what, who, 
where, who, and how.  

What is hearsay testimony? 

In a traditional trial, a witness cannot repeat state-
ments made by people outside of the courtroom. 
This kind of testimony is known as “hearsay” testi-
mony and, in most cases, the judge will disregard the 
testimony. There are some exceptions to the hearsay 
rule, for example, statements made by the other par-
ty can be considered by the judge. (In an Informal 
Domestic Relations Trial, hearsay is permitted, 
though it may carry less weight with the judge.) 

How do you get the witnesses you need to  
come to court? 

Unless a witness is under subpoena, they have no 
obligation to show up for court. A subpoena is an 
order from the court to appear. If you need a witness 
to testify, but they are unwilling to appear voluntari-
ly you should subpoena them. Additionally, some 
witnesses may need a subpoena to show their em-
ployer why they need to be absent from work. Most 
courts will have subpoena forms available at the 
courthouse. You must go to the courthouse to have 
the clerk issue the subpoena (unless you have a law-
yer representing you). A subpoena must be person-

ally served (handed to the witness) by an adult who 
is not a party to your case, unless the witness agrees 
to accept service of the subpoena. When you serve 
the subpoena, you must also provide the witness 
with a check for their witness fee. Each witness is 
entitled to a fee of $30.00 per day plus mileage at the 
rate of $0.25/mile (Note: rates as of 2019).  

Subpoenas for police officers 

If law enforcement has been involved in your case 
and you would like to subpoena a police officer or 
sheriff’s deputy, you must serve a subpoena on the 
department at least 10 days before trial. You will al-
so need to verify that the officer is available on the 
day of your trial. Most police or sheriff’s depart-
ments have a special process for serving subpoenas. 
Call your local police or sheriff’s office for more in-
formation. 

What if my witness cannot come to court? 

You may be able to have your witness testify by 
phone (remote testimony) during the trial. You 
should ask the other side if they object to this as 
soon as possible. If the other party does not agree to 
allow your witness to testify by phone, then you 
must file a formal motion with the court and serve a 
copy on the other party at least 30 days before the 
trial, unless you can provide a good reason (“good 
cause”) for not filing your motion 30 days before tri-
al. You must provide a proposed order for the judge 
to sign. The judge will only allow witnesses to testify 
by phone if it would be an “undue hardship” for 
them to come in person. If your request is granted, 
the court will not pay for long distance phone calls. 
Contact your local court for information about spe-
cific procedures. 

What you need to know the  
day of trial 

Where is the courthouse located? 

It is important to know where your local circuit 
court is located and understand where you can park 
for the duration of your trial. Some communities 

10  

may have municipal courthouses that are not in the 
same building as the court. There may be re-
strictions for how long you can park in certain spac-
es and you may need to be prepared to pay for the 
entire day to park. 

What to expect when you arrive at court 
for your trial 

Arrive early enough to give yourself time to go 
through security, find the courtroom, meet with your 
witnesses, and get organized. You should plan to ar-
rive at least 30 minutes before your trial. If you go 
into the courtroom early, be quiet and polite to the 
court and other people who are having a case heard 
by the judge. 

Most courthouses have a metal detector at the  
entrance. You will be required to pass through this 
metal detector to enter. Knives, weapons and pepper 
spray are not allowed. Your belongings will be sent 
through an x-ray machine and may be searched by 
court security. It is important to arrive several 
minutes early to pass through security, and even 
longer if the courthouse is in a more populated  
county. 

Look at your “Notice of Scheduled Court Proceed-
ing.” It will tell you the courtroom, day, and time of 
your trial. On the day of your trial, come to the court-
house and check which courtroom you are in on the 
monitors in the lobby or at the information windows 
in the courthouse.  

Each circuit court has a different process for how 
judges are assigned to your case and what the check-
in process is the day of trial. It is also important to 
understand whether your court sets a hearing prior 
to your trial where parties report on their readiness 
for trial (often called “Trial Call” or a “Trial Readi-
ness” hearing). You should ask a court clerk about 
any special procedures in your court. 

What if you feel unsafe around the other 
party or their witnesses? 

If you feel unsafe around the other party, their wit-
nesses, their associates or family members, alert 

courthouse security. They may be able to provide 
security during your hearing, depending on the 
courthouse and the nature of the concern.  

Arrive early enough to give yourself time to go through 
security, find the courtroom, meet with your witnesses, 
and get organized.  

What if my case settles before trial? 

If you and the other party resolve your case before it 
is scheduled to go to trial, please contact your local 
family law facilitator or family law department as 
soon as possible. If you and the other party have set-
tled your case the morning of your trial. You still 
need to attend your trial. When the judge calls your 
case, let them know that you have settled your case. 
The judge may ask you to recite the terms of your 
settlement agreement on the record or refer you and 
the other party to the family law facilitator to assist 
you in preparing an agreed or “stipulated” judgment. 
An appointment may be necessary in order to com-
plete the judgment. 

How do you pay the trial fees? 

You should ask a court clerk or family law facilitator 
whether there are trial fees in your court and how 
much the trial fees are in your case. In there is a trial 
fee, you will need to pay the fee prior to the trial 
starting. If you cannot afford to pay the amount re-
quired, you may apply for a fee deferral or waiver. 
You can download the fee deferral or waiver packet 
at: https://www.courts.oregon.gov/forms/Pages/
fee-waiver.aspx

What is the layout of the courtroom? 

How should you act at a trial? 

The “bench” is where the judge sits. The judge’s as-
sistant (“clerk”) sits near the judge. There are at 
least two tables in front of the bench. These are for 
the parties and their lawyers, if any. This is where 
you will sit when your name is called. 

Your witnesses will sit in the audience section or 
outside the courtroom until they are needed. The 
place where witnesses testify is called the “witness 
stand.” It is located next to the bench. The judge will 
tell you whether you can testify from your seat at the 
table or whether you will need to move to the wit-
ness stand. 

Who will be at the trial? 

•  Court staff. The judge and judicial staff. 

•  The other party and their lawyer (if they have 
one). If the other party’s lawyer is present, you 
are not required to talk to them unless you are on 
the witness stand (in a traditional trial), or the 
judge tells you to talk to the lawyer. 

•  Witnesses. In a traditional trial, your witnesses 
should be there, and the other party’s witnesses 
will be there as well. Witnesses will generally be 
asked to wait outside the courtroom when your 
trial starts.  

•  Sheriff deputy (upon request). If the other par-
ty, or their witnesses, is making you feel uncom-
fortable or unsafe, tell the judicial staff immedi-
ately. They may be able to have a deputy remain 
in the courtroom during your trial.  

•  Family and friends. You may have family or 

friends sit in the courtroom with you during your 
trial for support. If they are not witnesses in your 
case, they may remain in the courtroom for your 
entire trial.  

•  Other people. Occasionally there may be other 
people in the courtroom waiting for their own 
case to be heard or observing court cases. 

•  Be prepared and be on time. Bring all docu-
ments or exhibits that you need for your trial. 
Bring an extra copy for the judge and the other 
party. You may use written notes during the trial. 

•  Clothing. Wear clean, neat clothing like you 

would wear to an important job interview. Avoid 
casual clothing like jeans, shorts, t-shirts, and tank 
tops. Remove hats and sunglasses in the court-
room.  

•  Food and drinks. No food or drinks are allowed 
in the courtroom. Do not chew gum or tobacco. 
Most courtrooms will have a pitcher of water and 
cups for you to use.  

•  Electronic devices. Generally, courts will require 
you to turn off all cell phones and electronic de-
vices. You are not allowed to record or take pho-
tos in the courtroom.  

•  Formalities. Stand when the judge enters the 

courtroom. Sit down when the judge or clerk asks 
you to sit. 

•  Addressing the judge. When you speak to the 
judge, call them, “Your Honor.” Never interrupt 
the judge when they speak or argue with them. 
Stop speaking if the judge interrupts you.  

•  Testifying. Prepare an outline for your testimony. 
Be truthful on all matters, even if you think the 
truth might hurt your case. The truth can help you 
overall. 

•  Answering questions. The other party (or their 
lawyer) will ask you questions. The judge may 
also ask you questions. Do not answer a question 
unless you fully understand it. Do not guess. Take 
your time answering questions and explain your 
answer if you think it is necessary. If you do not 
understand a question, whether asked by the 
judge, the other party or the other party’s lawyer, 
tell the judge.  

•  Be polite and respectful. Be courteous to all par-
ticipants in the trial and court staff. Your behavior 

12  

during trial is observed by the judge. Do not inter-
rupt the other party. Do not use the courtroom as 
a place to have or continue arguments with the 
other side. Do not try to threaten or intimidate 
the other party or engage with anyone in a nega-
tive way. 

•  Witnesses. Witnesses may be required to remain 
outside the courtroom until they are called in to 
testify. You may ask the judge or the court clerk 
where your witnesses should wait.  

•  Observers. Instruct your witnesses and support-
ers in the audience to remain quiet while they are 
observing your trial. You and your associates in 
the courtroom should not react verbally or make 
faces in reaction to the judge’s decisions or state-
ments by the other party or their witnesses. 

The evidentiary portion of a trial is the 
parties’ opportunity to present evidence. 
The petitioner (party who started the 
case) presents their case first.  

What to expect during a  
traditional trial  
A traditional trial is organized into three parts,  
(1) opening statements, (2) evidentiary portion, and  
(3) closing arguments. These parts are discussed in 
the sections below.  

Opening statements 

At the start of a traditional trial, the judge may ask 
each side for their “opening statement.” An opening 
statement is a brief summary of your requests to the 
judge and gives a brief overview of the witnesses 
and evidence you will be presenting at trial. This is 
not the time to present your entire case to the judge 
or go into details of what has happened. An opening 
statement is not testimony or evidence. Your open-
ing statement should very briefly provide the judge 
with an overview of the information you will be pre-
senting during the trial. Opening statements in fami-
ly law cases are usually only a few minutes.   

Evidentiary portion 

The evidentiary portion is the parties’ opportunity to 
present evidence. The petitioner (party who started 
the case) presents their case first. Then the respond-
ent presents their case. You should have a written 
outline of everything you need to prove and how you 
are going to prove it with witnesses and other evi-
dence, if you have any.  

Witness testimony 

During the evidentiary portion of the trial, each side 
will call witnesses. There are four parts to a wit-
ness’s testimony: (1) oath, (2) direct examination, 
(3), cross-examination, and (4) redirect:  

  Oath. The clerk will ask the witness to take an 

oath to swear to tell the truth. 

  Direct examination. This is the main portion of a 
witness’s testimony. During direct examination, 
the witness will provide the judge with all the rel-
evant information they have about the case. If you 
are testifying as a witness, you should prepare an 
outline of the information you want to cover dur-
ing your testimony. If you are calling witnesses, 
prepare a list of questions you want to ask them 
before your trial. You should first ask your wit-
nesses to explain how they know you, your child 
or children or the other party. Then you can ask 
them about things they personally saw or heard. 
For example, you can ask them if they saw you 
bringing your child to school every day, or if they 
heard the other party yelling, but you cannot ask 
them about things that happened when they were 
not around. When it is the other party’s oppor-
tunity to call witnesses, sit quietly and do not re-
act to their testimony. You may use this portion of 
the trial to take notes and write down questions 
you want to ask the witness after they are done 
giving their direct testimony.  

  Cross-examination. This is the opportunity for 
the other side to question a witness after they of-
fer direct testimony. If you are the witness being 
cross-examined, listen carefully to the questions 
asked of you. Do not answer a question if you do 
not fully understand it. Do not be afraid to say, “I 

 13  

don’t know,” when you do not know the answer to 
a question. Be brief in your answers, unless you 
need to explain something important to the judge. 
When it is your turn to cross-examine a witness, 
be sure you are asking the person questions and 
not making your own statements or testifying. 
The best cross-examination questions usually 
start with: “Isn’t it true that…” For example, “isn’t 
it true that you saw the other party spank our 
child?” For additional information, see https://
www.lsnjlaw.org/Courts/NJ-State-Courts/
Superior-Court-of/Pages/Cross-Examine-
Witness.aspx  

  Redirect. After a witness is cross-examined, the 
party who did the direct examination, has a sec-
ond chance to ask a few follow-up questions. The 
questions must be related to the cross-
examination testimony.  

Physical evidence 

If you have physical evidence, you should introduce 
this evidence during your testimony or during your 
witness’s testimony. The witness should explain 
what the piece of evidence is, how they obtained it, 
and provide additional information about the au-
thenticity of the evidence. If you want the judge to 
consider a document or some other piece of physical 
evidence, you must “offer” it into evidence as an 
“exhibit.” When you offer an exhibit, you will need to 
show it to the other side. The exhibit should also be 
labeled with a number. Refer to the “Labeling your 
exhibits” section for more information on how to 
properly number exhibits. The other party may ob-
ject to the judge considering your exhibit. The judge 
will decide whether to consider it. 

The other side may also offer exhibits. If they did not 
provide you with a copy of their exhibits at the be-
ginning of trial, they should show you the exhibit 
when they offer it.  If you believe the exhibit is irrele-
vant, misleading or unreliable, tell the judge why you 
think so when the other party offers it to the judge. 

Rebuttal case 

Once the respondent presents all their evidence, the 
judge may allow the petitioner to “rebut” or present 
additional information that may contradict the testi-
mony and evidence presented by the respondent. If 
the judge permits rebuttal evidence, the petitioner 
or any of their witnesses  may re-take the stand or 
offer other evidence. 

Closing arguments   

After all the testimony has been heard and the evi-
dence has been seen by the judge, the judge may not 
need to hear anything else. However, you may be 
asked if you want to give a “closing argument,” 
which is a summary of the testimony and evidence 
that supports your requests to the court and the 
time for you to raise any legal arguments if you have 
any. If the judge allows you to make a closing argu-
ment, the other side will also have a chance to pre-
sent their view of the case in closing argument. 

What to expect during a Informal  
Domestic Relations Trial 

Beginning 

When the Informal Domestic Relations Trial  begins, 
both people will be asked if they understand the 
rules and how the trial works, and, if they agreed to 
participate in the Informal Domestic Relations Trial 
voluntarily. It is possible for either party to change 
their mind the day of trial. If so, the judge will decide 
about when to continue with a traditional trial. 

Testimony 

The party who started the case will speak first. That 
person swears to tell the truth and may speak about 
anything they wish. They are not questioned by a 
lawyer. Instead, the judge will ask some questions in 
order to understand the issues and make a better 
decision. If the judge would like more information or 
clarification of an issue, the judge may ask the other 
party for such information. 

14  

If a party has a lawyer, then that lawyer may ask the 
judge to ask their client questions on specific topics. 
This process is repeated for the other person. 

If there are any experts, the expert’s report may be 
given to the judge. Either party may also ask to have 
the expert testify and be questioned by the judge or 
the other party. 

Physical evidence 

Each party may submit documents and other evi-
dence that they want the judge to see. The judge will 
look at each document and decide whether it is 
trustworthy and should be considered. 

Closing argument 

Each party may briefly respond to comments made 
by the other party. Each party or their lawyer may 
make a short legal argument about how the laws ap-
ply to their case. Any of the above steps may be mod-
ified by the judge to make sure the trial is fair for 
both parties. 

The judge’s ruling 
After hearing testimony from both parties and their 
witnesses, the judge may either make a ruling from 
the bench while you are present in court or take the 

case “under advisement” and send both sides a letter 
explaining their decision. The judge may ask one of 
the parties to prepare an order or a judgment. The 
forms are available from your family law facilitator 
or online at: https://www.courts.oregon.gov/
programs/family/forms/Pages/default.aspx. Law-
yers who provide limited assistance representation 
may also help you prepare an order or a judgment. 
You may need to schedule an appointment with your 
family law facilitator for help preparing the order or 
judgment. 

If you wish to appeal the judge’s ruling (ask a higher 
court to review it), appeal paperwork must be filed 
within 30 days of the filing of the judgment with the 
court. The appeals process is very complicated and 
you are encouraged to speak with a lawyer if you are 
considering an appeal. The family law facilitator and 
court clerks cannot help you with an appeal. You will 
need to talk to a lawyer who can help you with your 
appeal immediately so that you do not miss the 30 
day deadline. 

Finalizing your divorce or custody case  

You will not be divorced or separated, or have a final 
custody order, until a judgment is signed by the 
judge. If the other party has a lawyer, usually the 
lawyer will be asked to prepare the judgment. If nei-
ther party has a lawyer, the court will most likely 
prepare the judgment for you. After the judgment is 
signed by the judge, you should request a copy from 
the court for your records.  

After hearing testimony from both parties and their 
witnesses, the judge may either make a ruling from the 
bench while you are present in court or take the case 
“under advisement” and send both sides a letter  
explaining their decision.

Appendix A 

How to prepare for trial: child custody and parenting time 

If you and the other party do not agree on who 
should have custody and what the parenting time 
(visitation) schedule for your children should be, 
you will need to provide the judge with information 
about your children, so they can decide these issues 
for you and the other party.  

What is custody? 

The parent with custody makes “major life deci-
sions’” for the child, including the child’s education, 
medical treatments, and religious upbringing. Custo-
dy does not determine where the children spend 
their time.  

How is custody determined? 

The judge will make a decision on custody based on 
what is in the best interests of the children. A judge 
in Oregon cannot order “joint custody” unless both 
parents agree to that arrangement. If the parties do 
not agree to joint custody, a judge must award sole 
custody to one parent. The judge cannot give prefer-
ence to the mother only because she is the mother or 
to the father only because he is the father. If the oth-
er parent does not agree with your request for custo-
dy, the judge must hear information (evidence) 
about what would be best for the child. You and your 
witnesses (if possible) should testify about the fol-
lowing information: 

•  The emotional ties between the children and  

family members; 

the children; 

•  Each parent’s interest in or attitude towards  

•  The desirability of continuing an existing  

relationship with both parents; 

•  Whether one parent has abused the other parent; 

•  Who is the primary caregiver of the children; 

•  Conduct, marital status, income, social environ-
ment or lifestyle of either parent only if any of 

these factors are causing or may cause emotional 
or physical harm to the children; 

•  The presence of extended family members in  

the area; and 

•  The willingness and ability of a parent to facilitate 
and encourage a relationship between the chil-
dren and the other parent, if appropriate. 

Definitions and other information about types of 
custody and parenting time are available on the 
https://www.courts.oregon.gov/programs/
family/children/Pages/custody-parenting-
time.aspx. You should be familiar with this infor-
mation prior to coming to court.  

The parent with custody makes “major life decisions’” 
for the child, including the child’s education, medical 
treatments, and religious upbringing.  

What is parenting time? 

Parenting time refers to the amount of time that the 
children spend with each parent.  The Court will or-
der a parenting time schedule that is based on the 
best interests of the children.  

What is a parenting plan?  

A parenting plan is a document that lays out the par-
enting time schedule for each parent, including holi- 

 17  

If any of the following has occurred, it may be a basis 
for the judge to award supervised parenting time:  

•  The other parent has harmed or threatened 

harm to the children; 

•  The other parent has threatened to keep or hide 

the children; 

•  The other parent has a history of neglecting or 
physically or sexually abusing other children; 

•  The other parent lacks parenting skills or has had 

little contact with the children; 

•  The other parent leaves young children without 

supervision; 

•  The child is afraid of the other parent; 

•  The other parent has drug, alcohol, or criminal 
problems that are a danger to the safety of the 
children; or 

•  The other parent has subjected you to domestic 

violence. 

If the judge decides that there are some valid con-
cerns, but not enough to order supervised parenting 
time, you can ask the judge to make some conditions 
to keep the children safe, such as: 

•  The other parent cannot use drugs or alcohol be-

fore or during parenting time; 

•  The other parent must complete a parenting class 
or substance abuse program or mental health 
counseling; or 

•  Parenting time exchanges occur at a neutral,  

safe location and/or are facilitated by a neutral 
third party.  

No parenting time 

In rare circumstances, the judge may decide that it is 
not in the children’s best interests for a parent to 
have parenting time until they have addressed safety 
concerns. For example, if the other parent physically 
or sexually abused you or the children or has serious 
mental health issues that prevent them from being a 
safe parent.  

18  

day visits. Parties can customize parenting plans to 
suit their needs. A parenting plan can be brief or it 
can be very detailed with rules for parenting time 
and detailed schedules.  

You should prepare and file with the court a pro-
posed parenting plan outlining the time you believe 
that each parent should have with the children. 
Check with your local court to see if your county has 
a model (sample) parenting time plan. They might be 
available on the court’s website. Guides with infor-
mation about creating parenting plans and sample 
plans are also available on the Oregon Judicial De-
partment’s family law website https://
www.courts.oregon.gov/programs/family/
children/Pages/parenting-plans.aspx. There is 
also information and forms for a “Safety-Focused 
Parenting Plan” if you are concerned about your or 
your children’s safety. 

Supervised parenting time 

If you want the other parent to have a relationship 
with your children, but you have serious concerns 
about the children’s safety if they are alone with the 
other parent, you may ask the judge to order 
“supervised” parenting time.  

Find out ahead of time if your community has an 
agency or center that provides supervised parenting 
time or parenting time exchanges. You may also con-
sider whether someone you trust is willing to super-
vise (watch) the other parent and your children dur-
ing their time together.  

Tell the judge who the supervisor will be so that if 
there is an order for supervised parenting time, it 
will include the name of the agreed-upon supervisor. 
Your court’s family law facilitator also may have in-
formation on agencies or individuals who are willing 
to supervise parenting time. If you are requesting 
supervised time, you should be prepared to present 
information (evidence) on why that is appropriate in 
your circumstances.   

   

Appendix B 

How to prepare for trial: child support 

The judge will consider the following basic issues 
when determining what the appropriate child sup-
port should be in your case: 

•  Each parties’ income. If a party is not working, the 

court will consider their “potential income,” 
which is what they would make if they were 
working; 

•  Whether a party receives or pays spousal  

support; 

for the children; 

coverage; 

•  The availability and cost of health care coverage 

•  The cost for the parent’s own health care  

•  Whether the parties have minor children with 
someone else that they have a duty to support 
(non-joint children); 

•  The number of joint children and their ages; 

•  The amount of overnight parenting time the chil-

dren have with the other parent; 

•  Whether the children receive Veterans or Social 
Security benefits based on one or both of the 
parent’s retirement or disability; and 

•  Monthly childcare costs (childcare costs only in-

clude daycare, nanny, or babysitter costs). 

You must present information to the judge about all 
of the factors listed above.  

Uniform Support Declaration 

When child support is at issue, both parties must file 
a “Uniform Support Declaration” before trial (if pos-
sible) or bring the form to trial. This is a document 
that provides the court with detailed financial infor-
mation about both parties. This form is available 
online at https://www.courts.oregon.gov/forms/
Documents/Uniform%20Support%
20Declaration.pdf or at your local court.  

What documents should you bring?  

•  Proof of income—pay stubs, tax returns, Social 

Security/Disability Benefits amounts; 

•  Health insurance information—cost of insur-

ance and name of company; and 

•  Child care costs—receipts for daycare or 

babysitting costs. 

What rules apply? 

The Oregon Administrative Rules that apply to child 
support (Oregon Administrative Rules, Chapter 137, 
Divisions 50 and 55) are available at https://
www.doj.state.or.us/child-support/for-
professionals/child-support-laws/  

The judge uses a formula set out in the law called the ”child 
support guidelines” to calculate the amount of child support 
the law presumes is appropriate.  

How is child support calculated? 

The judge uses a formula set out in the law called the 
“child support guidelines” to calculate the amount of 
child support the law presumes is appropriate. The 
judge can increase or decrease this presumed 
amount if convinced by the evidence that it is fair to 
do so. 

 19  

Once you have the necessary financial information, 
you may access the child support calculators online. 
The child support calculator is available at               
oregonchildsupport.gov/calculator. Your court’s 
family law facilitator may be able to refer you to re-
sources to help you with your calculations. In addi-
tion, your public library may have public computers 
that you may use. 

The child support guidelines also let the judge con-
sider other circumstances that may either increase 
or decrease the child support amount. In the guide-
lines these are called “rebuttals.” For example, the 
judge may increase the support for a child who has 

special needs so each parent shares in the payment 
of costs for the child. The rebuttal factors are listed 
in ORS 25.280 and the Oregon Administrative Rules 
Chapter 137, Division 50 (see above). You should 
look at both. If you include a rebuttal factor, you 
must be prepared to prove it is true by presenting 
information or documentation to support your  
position. 

Additional child support resources and information 
is available on the Oregon Department of Justice 
Child Support webpage:  oregonchildsupport.gov   

Once you have the necessary financial information, you may use the Child Support Program’s child support calculator to 
calculate the presumed amount of support. The calculator is available at  oregonchildsupport.gov/calculator.

Appendix C 

How to prepare for trial: spousal support 

Spousal support (formerly called “alimony”) is an 
order that one spouse or domestic partner pay mon-
ey to the other, usually on a monthly basis. Only 
married couples or registered domestic partners can 
receive spousal support. Spousal support is intended 
to help one party cover the costs of basic needs, tran-
sition to a new living situation, or keep a standard of 
living similar to that existing during the relationship.  

Spousal support (formerly called “alimony”) is an order 
that one spouse or domestic partner pay money to the 
other, usually on a monthly basis.  

Three types of spousal support 

There are three types of spousal support: 

Maintenance support 

Maintenance support is designed to help a person 
financially for a specific number of months or years 
or an indefinite period of time. When there is a sub-
stantial difference in the parties’ income, the judge 
may award maintenance support to make sure both 
parties have sufficient living expenses. The judge 
may look at the following factors: 

•  How long the marriage has lasted; 

•  Age of the parties; 

•  Health of the parties (physical, mental,  

emotional); 

the marriage; 

parties; 

•  Standard of living (lifestyle) established during 

•  Income and earning abilities of each of the  

•  Training and employment skills; 

•  Both parties’ work experience; 

•  Financial needs and resources of each party; 

•  Tax consequences to each party; 

•  Both parties’ responsibilities to take care of and 

support the children; and 

•  Any other factors the judge considers fair. 

Transitional support 

Transitional support allows the person receiving 
support to obtain the education and training needed 
to go back to work or get ahead in the job market. It 
is temporary support. The judge considers evidence 
(information) on the following issues: 

•  How long the marriage has lasted; 

•  Both parties’ training and employment skills; 

•  Both parties’ work experience; 

•  Financial needs and resources of each party; 

•  Tax consequences to each party; 

•  Both parties’ custodial and child support respon-

sibilities; and 

•  Any other factor the judge considers fair. 

Compensatory support 

Compensatory support is rarely awarded. It is meant 
to compensate (pay back) a party who has made a 
significant financial or other contribution to the edu-
cation, training, vocational skills, career, or earning 

 21  

capacity of the other party. The judge may consider 
the following factors: 

•  Proof of education expenses (if you supported 

your spouse while they went to school); 

•  How long the marriage has lasted;  

•  Information about each parties’ education and 

•  Amount, length, and importance of the  

contribution; 

•  Relative earning abilities of each party; 

•  How much the marital estate has already benefit-

ted from the contribution; 

•  Tax consequences to each party; and 

work history—school records, tuition infor-
mation, or resumes; 

•  Asset information—bank account records, real 
property information, retirement accounts, and 
savings accounts; 

•  Proof of disabilities—medical records, or disa-

bility benefit information; and 

•  Any other factor the judge considers fair.  

•  Uniform Support Declaration—(see below). 

Evidence 

Be ready to present evidence (testimony, docu-
ments, photos, etc.) on each of the issues listed un-
der the type of spousal support you are requesting. 
You may request more than one type of spousal sup-
port. Evidence that may be helpful to the judge may  
include:  

•  Proof of income—pay stubs (for both parties, if 
possible), tax returns, benefit statements from 
disability benefits (if applicable); 

Uniform Support Declaration 

When spousal support is at issue, both parties must 
file a “Uniform Support Declaration” before trial (if 
possible) or bring the form to trial. This is a docu-
ment that provides the court with detailed financial 
information about both parties. This form is availa-
ble online at https://www.courts.oregon.gov/
forms/Documents/Uniform%20Support%
20Declaration.pdf or at your local court.

Appendix D 

How to prepare for trial: division of property and debts 

the company that holds your investment may re-
quire an additional court order to allow you access 
the funds or to divide the money in the account. This 
additional order is called a Qualified Domestic Rela-
tions Order. You should seek the advice of a lawyer 
in the event you need this additional order. You may 
want to tell the judge if you need this order because 
often there can be additional costs associated with it.  

In a divorce trial, the judge must decide how to di-
vide the marital property owned by you and the oth-
er party. This division of property also includes all 
the debts of the parties. The judge will address who 
gets to take each item of property that you and the 
other party own, including land, houses, RVs, motor 
vehicles, furnishings, money in bank accounts, stocks 
and bonds, pensions and retirement benefits, and 
personal property, including any debts owed.  

The rule of equitable division 

All property and debts acquired during your mar-
riage are considered marital property. The law cre-
ates a presumption that marital property should be 
split equally, regardless of whose name is on the 
debt or who owns the piece of property. A judge may 
also divide property owned by one party before the 
marriage or relationship began, although it is usually 
given to the party who originally owned it.  

A judge can order a division that is different than 
50/50 if the judge finds it is “just and proper” given 
other considerations. For example, a judge may de-
cide that the parent awarded custody may keep the 
family home so the parties children do not have to 
move, even if it means the other party does not get a 
fair share of the equity in that home. Or, a judge 
could decide that it is fair that one party pay a great-
er share of the debts because they acquired those 
debts and spent money unwisely.  

When to talk to a lawyer 

You should get the advice of a lawyer if retirement 
benefits, pensions, or real property (land or a house) 
will be issues in your divorce because this type of 
property can involve very complicated legal issues. 

Dividing retirement and pension benefits 

If you have retirement benefits or a pension, you will 
need to bring information about these accounts to 
trial to show the judge. If the judge decides to split 
the accounts in some way, you should be aware that 

If you and the other party have debts and assets to be 
divided, you must prepare a Statement of Assets and 
Liabilities. The Statement of Assets and Liabilities tells 
the court what items of property you and your spouse 
own, how much the property is worth (or your best esti-
mate), and who should be awarded the property or debt 
in the divorce.  

Dividing debts 

The judge will also decide which party pays which 
debts. Even if only one of you made the purchase 
during the marriage or relationship, the other party 
may also be responsible for the debt and can be sued 
by the creditor (the person or entity to whom the 
debt is owed). There may be some reasons that one 
party is not responsible for certain debts like busi-
ness expenses and loans of money. If you and the 
other party were separated when one of you signed 
for the debt, the other party likely is not responsible 

 23  

to the creditor unless the debt is for the children’s 
education, health, or support needs.  

acquired or managed during the period of the re-
lationship; and 

What documents to bring 

If you and the other party have debts and assets to 
be divided, you must prepare a Statement of Assets 
and Liabilities.  

A packet of forms and instructions to prepare the 
statement is available on the Oregon Judicial Depart-
ment’s website at https://www.courts.oregon.gov/
forms/Documents/Assets-Liab-wInstr-2019-04-
01.pdf  

The Statement of Assets and Liabilities tells the court 
what items of property you and your spouse own, 
how much the property is worth (or your best esti-
mate), and who should be awarded the property or 
debt in the divorce.  

You should support your proposal for dividing the 
property and debts by providing information and 
evidence to the judge as follows: 

•  Where the property came from (gift, inheritance, 
purchase, debt) and when ownership or obliga-
tion occurred;  

•  The estimated value of the property or amount of 

the debt; 

marriage; 

•  If one of the parties owned it before the  

•  If the parties kept their money in joint bank  

accounts or separate; 

•  How much money each party makes now and is 

expected to make in the future; 

•  Whether it would make sense for a specific item 

to go to the parent with custody; 

•  How much the value of the property increased 
during the time the parties were together; 

•  Any other information you believe is important to 
know about the property or how the debt was 

•  Whether you have reached any agreements on 
which property or debts should be assigned to 
which party. 

Important information about debts  

Most debts are contracts with third-parties, like car 
payments, mortgages, or credit card companies. 
Even if the judge says the other party should pay a 
debt incurred by you while you were together, the 
prior contract you entered into for the debt still al-
lows the creditor (car company, mortgage company, 
or credit card company) to seek payment from either 
one of you. If the creditor is not paid by the other 
party, they can file a lawsuit against you, the other 
party, or both of you, for the unpaid amount. If this 
happens, you may be able to get reimbursement 
from the party who the judge ordered to pay the 
debt by filing a case against the nonpaying party. 
This can be very complicated, and you should seek 
the advice of a lawyer.  

Some courts require you to participate in a process 
called “alternative dispute resolution” before a trial 
on financial issues such as division of marital prop-
erty and debts, will be held. Alternative dispute reso-
lution is similar to mediation. Check with your local 
court for more details.

Appendix E 

How to prepare for trial: modification of custody, parenting time, child 
support, or spousal support  

If only one parent wants to change parenting time, a 
hearing may be set to decide this matter. Check with 
your local court to learn about the procedure.  

Changing custody 

The parent with custody will make “major life deci-
sions” for the child, including the child’s education, 
medical treatments, and religious affiliation. A par-
ent may change the terms of the judgment with the 
agreement of the other parent or by asking the court 
to modify custody. If only one parent wants to 
change custody, a hearing (similar to a trial) may be 
set to decide this matter. Check with your local court 
to learn about the procedure.  

Substantial change in circumstances standard 

The parent seeking a change in custody must show 
that there has been a “substantial change of circum-
stances” since the last custody order and that the 
change in custody is in the best interest of the child. 
Examples of substantial change in circumstances 
include:  

•  Safety concerns regarding the children; 

•  Relocation of a parent (in some situations); 

•  Developmental needs of the children; or 

•  Inability or unwillingness to continue to cooper-

ate with the other parent when the parties have a 
joint custody arrangement.  

If the judge decides that a substantial change in cir-
cumstances exists, the judge will consider the “best 
interest factors” listed in the next section to deter-
mine who should have custody of the children. If the 
judge decides that there is no substantial change in 
circumstances, the judge will not change custody. 
Note that “joint custody,” where both parents share 
the decision-making on major life decisions, can only 
be ordered if both parties agree to it.  

Changing parenting time 

One parent may change the terms of the parenting 
time judgment with the agreement of the other par-
ent or by asking the court to modify parenting time. 

The parent seeking a change in custody must show that 
there has been a “substantial change of circumstances” 
since the last custody order and that the change in cus-
tody is in the best interest of the child.  

Best interest standard 

A parent seeking a change in parenting time must 
show that the change is in the child’s best interests. 
A substantial change in circumstances is not re-
quired. The court will consider the following factors 
when determining which custody and parenting 
time arrangement is in a child’s best interests: 

•  The emotional ties between the children and  

family members; 

•  The parent’s interest or attitude towards the  

children; 

relationship; 

•  The desirability of continuing an existing  

•  Whether one parent has abused the other; 

•  Who is the primary caregiver of the children; or 

 25  

•  The presence of extended family members in the 

Substantial change of circumstances standard 

area; or 

•  The willingness and ability of a parent to facilitate 
and encourage a relationship between the chil-
dren and the other parent (unless there has been 
domestic violence or child abuse, then the court 
should not consider this factor). 

The judge cannot give preference to the mother only 
because she is the mother, or to the father only be-
cause he is the father. In addition, the court may not 
consider a parent’s disability or conduct, marital sta-
tus, income, social environment or lifestyle unless it 
is likely to endanger the child or cause emotional or 
physical damage to the child.  

Mediation requirement 

Some courts require the parties to participate in me-
diation before a hearing on modification of custody 
or parenting time will be held. In some circumstanc-
es, mediation may be “waived” (not required) by the 
court, such as when one party has a restraining or-
der against the other. Check with your local court for 
any such requirements.  

If only one parent wishes to change child 
support, that parent must show that there 
has been a “substantial change of  
circumstances” since the previous order 
was finalized.  

Modifying (changing) child support  

A parent may change the terms of a child support 
judgment or order with the agreement of the other 
parent or by asking the court to modify child sup-
port. If only one parent wants to change child sup-
port, a hearing may be set to decide this matter. 
Check with your local court to learn about proce-
dure.  

If only one parent wishes to change child support, 
that parent must show that there has been a 
“substantial change of circumstances” since the pre-
vious order was finalized. Examples of substantial 
change in circumstances include:  

•  The child is living with the other parent the ma-

jority of the time; 

•  The child’s needs have changed; 

•  The number of children involved has changed; 

and 

•  Income of one or both parents has changed; 

Modifying child support through the Oregon Child 
Support Program 

Another way to modify child support is to ask the 
Oregon Child Support Program to “review” the child 
support terms of your order. If it has been at least 
three years since the date the court order was en-
tered, or you can provide proof that there has been a 
substantial change in circumstances, the program 
may modify your support order for you. You do not 
need to file any paperwork with the court to request 
this change. If you qualify, the program will confirm 
the parties’ contact and financial information and 
create a proposed modification order. The Oregon 
Child Support Program will then serve both parties 
with the proposed modification. Both parents may 
correct information, agree to the modification, or 
request a hearing if they disagree. During the hear-
ing, an administrative law judge will determine the 
appropriate amount of support payments. Related 
forms can be found at oregonchildsupport.gov/
forms. 

Modifying (changing) spousal support  

A party may change the terms of a spousal support 
judgment with the agreement of the other party, or 
either ex-spouse/partner can ask the court to modify 
the support judgment if there is a substantial change 
in economic circumstances of a party. The support 
order can be increased, lowered, extended, or ended. 
The motion to modify support must be filed in court 

26  

and served on the other party before the original 
support order ends or is paid in full.  

If the change is to “compensatory support,” the ex-
spouse or partner requesting the change must also 
show that the change of economic circumstances is 
involuntary, extraordinary, and unanticipated (at the 
time of the original judgment) that reduces the abil-
ity of the paying party to earn income. One example 
is when the party paying support is forced to retire 
early due to a medical condition. However, a volun-
tary early retirement would not be considered a 
change in economic circumstances for the purpose of 
modifying compensatory support. An increase in the 
income of the paying party is generally not a basis 
for a spousal support modification.  

Uniform Support Declaration (USD)  

A Uniform Support Declaration is a document that 
outlines your income, sources of income and your 
financial responsibilities. This document allows the 
judge to understand whether either party needs sup-

port and how much such support should be. If you or 
the other party are requesting a modification of ei-
ther child or spousal support (or both), you should 
bring a copy of your Uniform Support Declaration to 
trial, even if you have already provided it to the 
court. Be sure to bring a copy for the other party as 
well. You may find the Uniform Support Declaration 
form here: https://www.courts.oregon.gov/forms/
Documents/Uniform%20Support%
20Declaration.pdf  

You cannot modify any portion of a judgment/order 
that divides property or debts. However, if you dis-
cover that there were assets (property, money or 
something of value) that were left out of the final 
judgment, you may be able to reopen the case to ad-
dress those assets. This should be done as soon as 
possible after the missing asset(s) is/are discovered. 
The court does not offer forms for this process and 
you may need to speak with a lawyer for further in-
formation.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
