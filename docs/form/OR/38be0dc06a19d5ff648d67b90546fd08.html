      <pre>POLICIES AND PRACTICES 

Since 1995, the Court of Appeals has operated an Appellate Settlement 

Conference Program.  The program rules are found in Rule 15.05 of the Oregon Rules of 

 

 

Appellate Procedure. 

In brief, the settlement program works as follows:  After a notice of appeal has 

been filed, the Appellate Court Records Section will assign a case number to the appeal 

and review the notice for jurisdictional requirements.  Once it is determined that the 

jurisdictional requirements have been met, the records section will refer certain 

designated cases to the program as a matter of course.  These designated cases currently 

include general civil, probate, domestic relations, and workers' compensation appeals.  

These appeals are part of the mandatory mediation component of the program, and the 

program generally will accept the referrals and assign the appeals to the program’s 

mediation process.  However, appeals involving stalking or restraining orders, and 

appeals involving pro se parties are not referred to the program, and are excluded from 

the mandatory mediation program.   

Appeals that fall into the mandatory component of the program still are screened 

for appropriateness of mediation.  If there is a compelling reason why mediation should 

not be ordered, the appeal will not be assigned to mediation, and may be removed from 

the program and reactivated.  However, many of these appeals go through some type of 

informal mediation process before reactivation.   

 

At any time during the appellate process, the court may refer any appeal to 

the program on its own motion.  Appeals referred to the program by the court are 

automatically accepted and assigned to mediation under the mandatory component of the 

program.  Court referrals generally are not screened. 

For any other appeal, a party or parties may request referral to the program at any 

time during the appellate process.  If the request comes from only one party, and is made 

before briefing and the case is in one of the designated categories, it generally will be 

accepted by the program and assigned to the mandatory mediation component of the 

program.  In all other appeals, and at any time during the appellate process, the parties 

must join in the request.  These referrals are considered "opt-in" cases, and are part of the 

voluntary component of the mediation program.  Opt-in cases are investigated for 

appropriateness of mediation, availability of program resources, and court needs.  If it 

meets those criteria, the appeal may be accepted into the program and assigned to the 

mediation process.    

Once an appeal is accepted into the program, other than by court referral, a 

settlement conference statement form is sent to the parties.  Appellants and cross-

appellants (or petitioners and cross-petitioners) are required to complete and return the 

form within 10 days from the date on the form.  If parties are unable to complete the form 

within the designated time period, they should contact the program director and request 

an extension of time to submit the form.  Respondents are not required to submit the 

form, but they are encouraged to do so.  However, submission of the form is not required 

if the appeal already has been briefed.  When the program receives the form, program 

staff will conduct an in-depth screening to determine how it may assist the parties in 

reaching a resolution.  This assistance involves many forms, including but not limited to: 

helping the attorneys and parties resolve the matter among themselves without a formal 

mediation; providing assistance to attorneys who want to hire a private mediator; 

assigning a program neutral to mediate the appeal, etc. 

When a case has been assigned to the program for mediation, the court holds the 

preparation of the transcript and record, as well as briefing, in abeyance for a period of 

120 days from the date of notice of the assignment of the case to the program.  However, 

if the parties contact the program director and join in a request for a shorter initial 

abeyance period, the program director may allow a shorter abeyance period.  If the parties 

need additional time to conclude settlement negotiations--usually to prepare settlement 

documents--they may request an extension of the abeyance from the program director.  If 

the case is removed from the program for any reason, the appeal is reactivated and the 

parties will be notified of the due date for the next appellate event. 

When an appeal proceeds to mediation, the program director assigns a mediator or 

"neutral" to the matter.  Typically, the program director discusses any potential conflicts 

the neutral may have before formally assigning him or her to the matter.  If the parties 

request a particular neutral, the director will generally attempt to accommodate the 

request.  If the program director assigns a neutral, and one or both of the parties have a 

conflict with the neutral, the party or parties may request the program director to remove 

the neutral assigned to their case.  The request must state the reason for the request and 

must be made before the first scheduled settlement conference (or “mediation”) date and 

as soon as practicable after receiving the notice designating the neutral.  If the program 

director excuses the first assigned neutral, the director will assign a different neutral to 

mediate the matter, and most likely will need to reschedule the mediation.   

Neutrals are retired judges and experienced practitioners who have completed a 

mediation training program that the program conducts from time to time.  On occasion, a 

sitting judge or person with specific subject matter expertise may serve as a neutral, even 

though they have not participated in the program’s specific training.  Once a case has 

been assigned to a neutral, program staff will provide him or her with copies of the 

settlement conference statement forms, the notice of appeal, and the order or judgment 

being appealed.  The neutral may require the parties to submit additional materials as 

well.  The materials that the parties submit to the neutral are not treated as confidential 

unless the parties mark them as such.  These materials shall not be subject to disclosure, 

except as the law may require or as the parties and the supervising judge may all agree. 

A party or person with actual authority to settle the case must be present at the 

settlement conference unless that person’s absence or appearance through technological 

means is approved prior to the conference by the program director.  In cases where the 

party, person, or group of persons with actual authority to settle is excused from 

attending, a person with actual authority to recommend settlement must be present.  

Mediation sessions usually last up to five hours.  More complex matters may take 

additional time or sessions.  Program settlement conferences are subject to ORS 36.210 

to 36.238.  (Note:  The proposed Amendment to ORAP 15.05 noted below on this 

website clarifies when confidentiality commences and terminates.)  If a settlement is 

reached, however, the terms of the settlement generally are not considered confidential 

unless the parties agree to confidentiality. 

The materials that the parties submit to the neutral do not become part of the court 

record on appeal.  The program maintains separate files from the files maintained by the 

records section and Court of Appeals.  The program maintains those files, and later 

destroys them, pursuant to the Oregon Judicial Department's records retention policy.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
