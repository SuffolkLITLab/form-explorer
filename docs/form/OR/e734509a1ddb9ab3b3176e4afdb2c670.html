Oregon Judicial Branch Mission

As a separate and independent branch of government, our mission is to provide fair and accessible 

justice services that protect the rights of individuals, preserve community welfare, and inspire public 

confidence.  The established goals of Oregon state courts are to:

Protect Public Access to Justice – by making court services for citizens more accessible and easier 

to use through technology; providing safe courthouses; and  supporting the special needs of diverse 

cultures in our communities.

Maintain Public Trust and Confidence – by working closely with the executive and legislative branches 

of government; preserving and enforcing the rule of law in our communities, while upholding the 

human ideals of fairness, impartiality, and accountability.

Provide Quality and Timely Dispute Resolution – by ensuring that disputes are resolved for citizens and 

businesses fairly, promptly, appropriately, and cost-effectively through jury and non-jury trails, alternative 

dispute resolution methods, improvements in court business processes, and use of technology.

Collaborate with Justice System Partners and Other Stakeholders – by achieving better outcomes in 

court proceedings through connections justice system, public safety, and community welfare programs, 

in providing Treatment Courts, Juvenile Programs, and Family Courts.

Enhance Judicial Administration – Oregon courts must use the resources of Oregonians wisely. We 

are accountable to the law, to the other branches of government, and to the public. The effective 

administration of justice requires deliberate attention to and improvement of the core processes of 

our court system.

Introduction

The  Framers  of  the  Oregon  Constitution  decreed  that  “justice  shall  be 

administered,  openly  and  without  purchase,  completely  and  without  delay.” 

Although  fully  achieving  that  lofty  goal  is  an  ongoing  task,  the  Oregon  state 

courts have worked hard for more than 150 years to provide Oregonians a fair, 

accessible, and cost-effective justice system.

During 2015, we took important steps to improve access to justice for those who 

come before the courts. The Oregon eCourt program successfully continued its 

implemention of a new electronic case and document management system in 

more trial courts across the state, rapidly moving towards a mid-2016 completion 

date. Lawyers and others are now able to file court documents electronically and 

access documents on computers and mobile devices. Other features allow users 

digital access to court calendars and case information. We also have developed 

online interactive interviews that help individuals prepare forms that can be filed 

in some of the most common kinds of legal proceedings, including restraining 

orders, small claims, and landlord-tenant matters — reducing time and frustration 

for individuals, court staff, and judges. And we are working to redesign our central 

and individual trial court websites to make them mobile-friendly, streamlined, 

and easier for lawyers, litigants, and the general public to use.

With critical legislative support through matching bond funding, the Oregon 

Judicial Branch is working with counties around the state to repair or replace 

deteriorating  or  unsafe  courthouses.  New  courthouses  in  Union  County  (La 

Grande) and Jefferson County (Madras) were under construction in 2015 and 

scheduled for completion in 2016, while planning is well underway for other 

courthouse  projects,  including  replacement  of  the  1911  Multnomah  County 

Courthouse — the busiest court in the state. Those changes to our courthouses 

will  increase  safety  and  accessibility  for  the  public,  judges,  and  court  staff, 

and  will  provide  the  means  to  advance  our  use  of  new  technology,  including 

Oregon eCourt and statewide video-conferencing. Just as important, thoughtfully 

commitment to equal justice under the law.

For the hundreds of thousands of Oregonians who turn to the courts to resolve 

problems, we continue to implement new strategies to make court services more

OJD
Structure

The  Oregon  Judicial  Branch,  one  of  three  branches  of  state  government 

established by the Oregon Constitution, has a unified statewide court system 

that  is  known  as  the  Oregon  Judicial  Department  (OJD).  Its  judges  have  the 

responsibility to enforce the rule of law by deciding criminal, civil, family, and 

other  types  of  legal  disputes;  interpreting  and  applying  the  state  and  federal 

constitutions and statutes; and holding hearings and trials throughout the state. 

The role of the courts is to ensure that all Oregonians receive fair and accessible 

justice while providing due process, protecting individual rights, and preserving 

community welfare.

OJD is a unified system of state-funded courts consisting of the Oregon Supreme 

Court,  Court  of  Appeals,  Tax  Court,  and  circuit  courts  (trial  level  courts),

Oregon Circuit Courts

Oregon Tax Court

In addition to handling 
all types of cases, the 
circuit courts are actively 
involved in both 
legislatively and court- 
initiated programs 
to provide improved 
dispute resolution processes 
and outcomes for the 
 
people and cases 
that come before them.

 

The Oregon circuit courts serve as Oregon’s trial courts. Circuit courts decide 

civil cases that arise from disputes involving property, contracts, personal injury, 

family  relationships,  probate,  government  rules,  and  regulations;  juvenile 

matters;  and criminal cases that result from violations of criminal law, including 

felonies, misdemeanors, probation violations, traffic, and other violation cases. 

There is at least one circuit court location in each county.

The Oregon circuit courts are divided into 27 judicial districts, made up of one 

or more of the state’s 36 counties. Most are single-county court districts. Some 

circuit courts in counties with small populations and caseloads are combined 

into multi-county districts. The number of judicial positions in each district is 

established by statute. 

Every two years, the Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court appoints or 

reappoints a presiding judge for each judicial district to administer, supervise, 

and distribute the workload within the district. Operations of the circuit courts 

are managed by trial court administrators who are supervised by the presiding 

judge.  Their  duties  include  personnel  administration,  budget  and  financial 

management, court operations, and jury management.

In addition to handling all types of cases, the circuit courts are actively involved 

in both legislatively initiated and court-initiated programs to provide improved 

dispute resolution processes and outcomes for the people and cases that come 

before them. The courts support, as resources permit, the following types 

of programs:

•  Treatment Courts — drug, alcohol, mental health, programs for veterans
Integrated Family Courts — where the same judge is assigned to all cases 
• 

involving a particular family

•  Other specialized courts or programs — addressing domestic violence, 

juvenile delinquency, payment of restitution, providing community court 

services

•  Arbitration and mediation programs
•

Leveraging
Court
Technology

Two  key  areas  of  OJD’s  2014–2019  Strategic  Plan  are  to  modernize  court 

technology  systems  and  to  improve  public  access  to  user-friendly  courts. 

The  implementation  of  Oregon  eCourt  technology  is  the  primary  tool  that 

modernizes how the courts provide access to case data for the public, through 

online  services  including  eFiling,  ePayment,  case  information  search,  court 

calendar search, online interactive forms, and subscription services. 

Oregon eCourt 

During  2015,  OJD 

successfully  continued 

its  multi-year, 

statewide 

implementation  of  Oregon  eCourt  technology  systems.  By  the  end  of  2014, 

these new systems had been implemented in 14 circuit courts, and OJD eFiling 

was  being  used  in  11  of  those  courts  to  electronically  file  case  documents 

twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Online access to court documents 

opened for attorneys, government users, and businesses that utilize court data. 

A mandatory eFiling requirement for attorneys began in all “live” circuit courts 

on  December  1,  2014,  and  was  expandedin  2015  to  each  new  circuit  court 

location 90 days after its Go-Live event.

OJD’s  technology  program  moved  into  2015  having  migrated  63  percent 

of  case  data  from  OJD’s  legacy  case  management  system,  OJIN,  to  the  new 

Oregon eCourt Case Information system (OECI). Over half of OJD’s new cases 

were being filed through OJD eFiling and processed into OECI. With 22 more 

circuit courts and the Oregon Tax Court preparing for implementation, OJD 

began the final phase of statewide implementation, taking multiple courts live 

every three months from 2015 to June 2016.  

Oregon eCourt will 
give courts and judges 
the tools they need 
to provide just, prompt, 
and safe resolution 
of civil disputes; 
to improve public safety 
and the quality of life 
in our communities; 
and to improve the lives 
of children and families 
in crisis.

Innovative
Court
Programs

Specialty Courts (Treatment 
Courts)

Innovation through Oregon’s Specialty Courts (problem-solving and treatment 

courts) began in 1991 when the first adult drug court opened in Multnomah 

County Circuit Court. Multnomah followed the promising lead of a small group 

of innovative drug courts in other states that were reducing prison populations 

by  introducing  diversion  programs  for  qualified  offenders.  In  exchange  for 

completing  the  requirements  of  a  long-term  treatment  program,  participants 

could avoid prison time and benefit further through the dismissal of charges. 

Over time, drug courts developed a therapeutic model that remains the basis for 

different types of treatment courts today, offered as an alternative to traditional 

sentencing  options,  while  helping  to  reduce  prison  populations.  The  model 

depends on developing a system of engagement and joint effort between separate 

groups — courts, justice system partners, corrections officials, probation officers, 

law  enforcement,  attorneys,  government  agencies,  and  community  treatment 

programs. 

Oregon has applied the adult drug court model to other case types — Mental 

Health  Court,  Veterans  Court,  Family  Dependency  Treatment  Court,  DUII 

Court,  Community  Court,  and  Juvenile  Drug  Court.  There  are  currently  68 

treatment  courts  in  Oregon  (See  Figure  1),  and  work  is  ongoing  to  structure

Mental Health Courts
De-institutionalizing therapeutic treatment of mental illness began 

in the 1960s with the closing of 560,000 out of 600,000 treatment 

hospitals  across  the  country.  It  was  thought  that  treatment  of

Oregon’s  jail  and  prison  officials  are  profoundly 

homes  would  absorb  those  displaced,  but  sufficient  funding 

never materialized. Patients with severe personality disorders were 

abandoned  on  community  streets,  with  insufficient  treatment 

options,  an  inability  to  care  for  themselves,  and  nowhere  to  go. 

Many  became  caught  in  a  cycle  of  arrests  and  incarceration  for 

crimes  attributed  to  their  untreated  mental  illnesses.  Since  de-

institutionalization  in  this  country,  there  has  been  a  400% 

increase  in  the  number  of  people  with  serious  mental  illnesses 

incarcerated  in  U.S.  jails  and  prisons.  According  to  a  U.S.

to  provide  therapeutic  treatment  for  mentally  ill

Drug Courts
Using  national  drug  court  best  practices,  Oregon’s  drug  courts  have  24  years 

of  experience  in  addressing  drug-related  crimes.  Statewide,  17  adult  drug 

courts and 10 juvenile drug courts emphasize intervention and comprehensive 

treatment  in  a  therapeutic  setting  for  offenders  involved  in  substance  abuse 

and  related  criminal  activity.  Depending  on  a  circuit  court’s  demographics 

and  case  type  totals,  drug  court  program  requirements  and  services  can  vary 

by county. Diversion is a component of most of Oregon’s drug courts, but not 

all  —  Clackamas  County  Circuit  Court,  for  example,  focuses  exclusively  on 

probationers with the most severe addiction and criminal histories to change 

their  lives  using  intervention,  intensive  treatment,  and  re-entry  support 

services. In Deschutes County Circuit Court, the drug court program focuses 

on “family drug court,” where criteria to participate includes being a justice-

involved  parent  or  in  a  parenting  relationship  with  a  child,  and  where  the 

offender’s addictions compromise their child’s safety, needs, and welfare.

Drug  courts  that  offer  diversion  in  place  of  prison  sentencing  or  probation 

allow  offenders  to  apply  for  participation  in  a  drug  court  program  after  they 

have  been  identified  as  possible  candidates  by  the  district  attorney,  who  acts 

as the gatekeeper, and others. The drug court judge weighs the level of crime 

committed,  criminal  history,  risk  to  the  public,  extenuating  circumstances, 

and information obtained by justice partner and drug team assessments of the 

individual  under  consideration.  If  accepted  for  drug  court,  participants  are 

required to successfully work through an individualized program. Treatment 

plans include treatment for addiction with regular monitoring by an assigned 

local treatment team, building life skills, sustaining family relationships, and 

support in finding employment and housing. Regular face-to-face supervision 

by  the  drug  court  judge  to  review  participant  accomplishments  or  setbacks 

produces  a  sense  of  structure  and  responsibility  in  offenders,  and  is  a  key 

contributor to successful completion of a drug court program.

Drug  courts  are  statistically  shown  to  reduce  recidivism  more  than  any  other 

type of drug treatment program. Program strategies result in breaking the cycle 

of substance abuse and criminal behavior in offenders with both short and long 

criminal histories, and offer the greatest opportunity to return offenders to a 

law-abiding and productive life. OJD’s goal is to obtain permanent funding for 

drug courts and to establish additional drug courts to benefit all of our circuit 

court communities.

prison protocols like isolation and restraint are still used to control combative 

behaviors  and  psychotic  outbursts  of  this  high-needs  population.  These 

practices  show  that  prison  environments  cannot  replace  treatment  for  the 

mentally ill. In fact, general prison culture and control methods like isolation 

and restraint can be particularly damaging to mentally ill offenders, creating 

a cascade of worsened symptoms, suicides, inability to function when released 

from prison, and high recidivism rates.

Oregon’s  Mental  Health  Court  programs,  working  with  law  enforcement, 

corrections,  and  the  treatment  community,  are  best  equipped  to  channel 

justice-involved citizens with mental illness into a full array of services that can 

help them make a safe return to the community.

Oregon currently has 13 Mental Health Courts. Offenders who have committed 

low-level misdemeanor or felony crimes as a result of diagnosed mental disorders 

may  be  recommended  for  admission  to  a  Mental  Health  Court  program  by 

defense attorneys, district attorneys, and probation officers. The court examines 

extenuating circumstances of diagnosed mental disorders, criminal history, and 

risk of recidivism before allowing the offender to voluntarily join the program. 

For  each  offender  in  a  Mental  Health  Court  program,  a  team  is  led  by  the 

Mental  Health  Court  judge  and  otherwise  includes  the  district  attorney, 

defense attorney, case manager, community treatment providers, and probation 

officer. The team assesses the offender’s risk needs to formulate a mental health 

treatment plan directed towards recovery and success. The program begins with 

stabilization, followed by long-term treatment, access to medications, assistance 

with  housing,  teaching  self-management  skills,  and  support  in  finding 

employment.  The  judge  and  the  mental  health  court  team  members  ensure 

that  the  offender  follows  the  program,  makes  restitution  to  the  community, 

and  satisfies  other  court-ordered  obligations,  including  any  probation  terms, 

before the offender is graduated from the program. 

Oregon’s Mental Health Court judges lead the decision-making process that 

monitors  and  holds  the  involved  justice  partners,  human  service  agencies, 

treatment  providers,  and  offenders  accountable  to  the  mental  health  court 

program and to the justice system. Support and funding for additional Mental 

Health  Courts  and  a  unified  system  of    justice  and  community  resources  in 

Oregon could reduce prison populations and costs, help restore people’s lives, 

and make communities safer.

Veterans Courts
Oregon Veterans Courts invest in addressing the complex needs of 

offenders who are veterans. Specialized courts for veterans began 

forming  across  the  country  in  2009–2010,  as  judges  observed  a 

large  percentage  of  veterans  charged  with  crimes  appearing  and 

Veterans  Courts  drew  from  treatment  models 

and  best  practices  of  drug  and  mental  health 

courts. Those models and practices were applied 

to 

specialized 

interventions  and 

remedies 

fundamental  to  healing  military  and  combat-

reappearing in their courtrooms.

related trauma. 

A  closer  look  at  justice-involved  veterans  uncovered  fragmented 

lives  with  service-  or  war-related  mental  and  physical  illnesses, 

along  with  drug  and  alcohol  abuse,  leading  to  incarceration, 

joblessness,  and  homelessness  (another  severe  problem  that 

veterans face). Veterans were also dealing with multiple diagnoses 

that  could 

include  substance  abuse,  post-traumatic  stress, 

cumulative psychological trauma, chronic physical pain, and even 

deep moral injury caused by wartime violations of personal moral 

values.

Funding and resources for these courts can come 

from  the  state,  counties  and  partner  agencies, 

treatment  providers, 

federal  grants,  private 

donations,  and  the  Veterans  Administration, 

which  pays  for  treatment  and  provides  training 

for veteran “peer mentors” who have experienced 

the  effects  of  military  combat.  The  mentors 

are  able  to  develop  a  strong  bond  with  veteran 

offenders helping to break through their feelings 

of isolation.

24

Veterans Courts are a deliberate partnership of local experts who collaborate in 

an effort to help veterans get their lives back on track. Experts include the judge, 

law enforcement, the district attorney, defense attorney; representatives from 

Veterans Justice Outreach, the county Veterans Service Office, and Veterans 

Administration;  health  and  benefit  coordinators,  parole  and  probation 

officers, counselors in vocational rehabilitation, community service agencies, 

and  the  trained  veteran  peer  mentor.  Offenders  accepted  into  the  program 

are  assigned  a  support  team  made  up  of  members  from  the  Veterans  Court 

partnership. The team meets before each court session to review the case and 

make treatment recommendations to the court. 

There are four Veterans Courts in Oregon. Klamath County Veterans Court 

has provided some “courtesy veterans program supervisions” for nearby Lane 

County  Veterans  Court,  and  Lane  County  Veterans  Court  will  also  accept 

transfers  from  other  counties  to  their  veterans  program.  Marion  County 

Veterans  Court  does  not  accept  veterans  from  other  counties;  and  the 

Multnomah  County  Veterans  Docket  and  program  focuses  only  on  veterans 

who will be serving probation.

Statistically, Veterans Courts have even lower recidivism rates than our highly 

successful drug courts, and with rising numbers of military veterans returning 

from  combat,  OJD  and  its  justice  partners  have  good  reason  to  advocate  for 

additional veterans court funding.

Problem-Solving Courts

In  addition  to  treatment-based  specialty  courts,  OJD  has  taken  action  to 

decrease the time and financial hardships involved in certain case types that 

discourage  participation  in  the  court  process  for  citizens  and  businesses  by 

developing  problem-solving  courts.  These  courts  are  based  on  procedural 

innovations that streamline traditional court processes in complex commercial 

(business) cases, civil jury trials, domestic relations trials, and juvenile cases. 

These revised processes result in courts that are more accessible, flexible, and 

efficient. Citizens and businesses that choose litigation through these courts can 

reduce the duration and costs associated with traditional litigation procedures. 

Lane County Commercial Court
Lane County Commercial Court was developed as a procedural efficiency, where 

judicial resources can be shared statewide to relieve the burden that complex

participants from their

Task Force

Juveniles  with  mental  health  disorders  who 

become  involved  in  the  juvenile  justice  system 

experience  the  same  pitfalls  that  adults  with 

mental  health  conditions  encounter  with  the 

justice  system  —  lack  of  a  unified  system  of 

assessment,    intervention,  treatment,  and  care. 

The  lack  of  facilities  for  emergency  placement 

in  communities  across  Oregon  results  in  justice-

involved  juveniles  with  mental  health  disorders 

being held in detention centers, where screening 

for  mental  disorders  is  not  legally  required. 

Although 94% of justice-involved female juveniles 

and  74%  of  male  juveniles  have  been  previously 

diagnosed with a mental health disorder, only 37% 

of Oregons county juvenile departments perform 

some form of mental health screening, the quality 

of which is tied to county resources and policies.

such  as  conducting  a  search  for  relatives,  providing  assessments 

of children and needed services, helping foster parents succeed in 

their  role,  and  ensuring  visitation  with  parents.  The  reviews  are 

conducted by CRB members made up of trained volunteers from 

the  community  (whose  backgrounds  are  scrutinized  thoroughly) 

and  who  are  required  to  follow  board  standards,  applicable  state 

and federal laws, and confidentiality laws.

RB members are appointed by the Chief Justice of the Oregon 

Supreme Court and sworn in by the Presiding Judge of the county

counties and approximately 300 members statewide.

to analyze the program’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and 

risks to develop CRB priorites for a five year strategic plan. They

appointed  special  advocates  (CASAs)  and  Oregon’s  citizen  volunteer  foster 

care  review  board);  and  gives  presentations  at  yearly  educational  conferences. 

Trainings and educational conferences consider current issues of substantive law, 

new legislation, OJD initiatives, caseflow management, performance measures, 

and significant issues impacting juvenile dependency and development. During 

2015, JCIP was involved in:

•  The annual “Through the Eyes of a Child” Conference for juvenile court 
judges. Topics included Engaging Children in Court, Adverse Childhood 

Experiences, strategies for permanency, and transitioning youth to 

successful adulthood.

•  The statewide Summit on Child Abuse and Neglect for model court teams 
and stakeholders who were able to work through case scenarios and ask 

experts on trauma and substance abuse questions about best practices.

•  A workshop at the Shoulder to Shoulder Conference for foster parents, 
CASAs, foster youth, and others about how to participate in and 

contribute to the Citizen Review Board (CRB) process.

•  Webinars and eModules, including: a webinar in collaboration with the

settings are ill-equipped to handle juvenile mental health crises. As a result, the 

behaviors and mental conditions that created a conflict with the justice system 

to begin with are only exacerbated.

In 2014, Chief Justice Thomas Balmer appointed a statewide task force to study 

the existing mental health care services for Oregon’s justice-involved juveniles 

to  identify  inadequacies  and  gaps  in  services.  The  Task  Force  was  asked  to 

provide  a  report  on  their  findings,  along  with  a  set  of  recommendations 

initiating reform of the system and expansion of services to establish a more 

adequate  and  accountable  juvenile  mental  health  care  system.  The  Juvenile 

Justice  Mental  Health  Task  Force  brings  together  an  experienced  group  of 

leaders selected by the Chief Justice to complete the statewide study. The Task 

Force  includes  juvenile  care  experts  from  OJD;  Oregon  Health  Authority; 

Oregon  Youth  Authority;  Department  of  Child  Welfare;  Oregon  Health 

and  Science  University’s  Division  of  Child  and  Adolescent  Psychiatry;  the 

Department  of  Education;  the  Youth  Development  Council;  the  Juvenile 

Department Director’s Association; Attorneys from Youth, Rights, and Justice; 

Youth  Villages;  Trillium  Family  Services;  Association  of  Oregon  Community 

Health  Programs;  Coordinated  Care  Organizations;  and  the  Oregon  Family 

Support Network. Task Force recommendations include:

•  Development of a coordinated system of all juvenile mental health 

stakeholders that uniformly screens, identifies, and treats mental disorders 

before there is involvement with the juvenile justice system. The “first 

points of contact” in juvenile mental health crises — schools, medical 

providers, child welfare, law enforcement, and juvenile departments — are 

best positioned to encounter juveniles with mental disorders and co-

occuring drug abuse issues, initiate assessment and intervention processes, 

and collect information for a statewide data-sharing and tracking system 

that will direct decision-making on diversion, treatment, and rehabilitation 

programs. Funding will be needed for innovative programs that assist “first 

point of contact” stakeholders with these tasks.

•  Use of a standard set of core policies, practices, and programs to guide 
stakeholders working with juveniles. The work of all stakeholders will 

contribute to a mission of community responsibility for juveniles within 

this system. A database should be provided to collect, share, track, and 

analyze information on juveniles entering the system.

•  Engage stakeholders in collaborative input on crisis placement, diversion 
programs, treatment, and rehabilitation approaches, avoiding restrictive

Equal Justice
For All

Over the last two decades, OJD has worked with justice system stakeholders to 

establish a process of inclusion and fairness as the landscape of Oregon’s cultural 

and  human  diversity  broadens.    Insight  into  racial,  ethnic,  limited  English 

speakers, gender identity, elder abuse, disability, human trafficking issues, and 

the need for qualified legal representation in child dependency cases continues 

to unfold in our communities, requiring our courts to accommodate diverse 

needs if there is to be justice for all citizens.

Growth continues in OJD’s offering of interpreters for limited English speakers.

The Oregon Supreme Court 
Council on Inclusion and 
Fairness

In  2015,  Chief  Justice  Thomas  A.  Balmer  established  an  ad  hoc  committee 

to  study  OJD’s  access  and  fairness  activities  and  to  make  recommendations 

responsive to Oregon’s access and diversity needs. That committee, chaired by 

Supreme Court Justice Richard C. Baldwin, submitted a proposal at the end 

of  2015  asking  the  Chief  Justice  to  approve  a  permanent  council  named  the 

Oregon Supreme Court Council on Inclusion and Fairness (OSCCIF) to: 

the  area  of  family  law.  Members  of  SFLAC  are  appointed  by  the 

Chief  Justice  and  include  a  knowledgeable  selection  of  family 

law  stakeholders  —  judges,  trial  court  administrators,  mediators 

and  evaluators,  attorneys,  family  court  service  providers,  and 

representatives  from  various  state  agencies.  The  current  SFLAC 

Chair is Judge Paula Brownhill, Clatsop County Circuit Court.

SFLAC  subcommittees  conduct  research,  draft  publications  on 

issues  involving  family  law  and  the  courts,  and  make  proposals 

for  recommendations  to  the  Chief  Justice  and  the  State  Court 

Administrator. Currently there are seven SFLAC Subcommittees:

•  Court/Child Support Agency Coordination
•  Domestic Violence 
•  Legislative  

advice  and  case  strategies,  to  help  clients  make 

sound  judgements  as  they  represent  themselves 

in court. The attorney may complete tasks for the 

client  such  as  reviewing  documents,  organizing 

evidence,  writing  pleadings  and  orders,  making 

a  limited  appearance  in  court,  or  any  number 

of  tasks  agreed  upon  by  the  client  and  attorney. 

Offering unbundled legal services can also build an 

attorney’s customer base and develop an expanded 

purpose for legal offices within the community. 

Between  2014  and  2015,  State  Family  Law 

Advisory  (SFLAC)  committees,  subcommittees, 

and  a  Limited  Scope/Unbundling  Workgroup 

developed  recommendations  detailing  “filing 

and  service  requirements 

for

in  domestic

(unbundling).”  A  proposal  followed  by  a  draft 

rule change proposal was submitted to the Chief 

Justice and State Court Administrator supporting 

the  adoption  and  promotion  of  limited  scope 

representation processes in Oregon circuit courts. 

The recommendations included:

the Legislature described the issue of funding for legal representation:

The  federal  Preventing  Sex  Trafficking  and 

Strengthening Families Act was passed in 2014 to 

help reduce sex trafficking of youth in the foster 

care system, increase the speed of permanency for 

foster children, and increase the amount of child 

support for families. States are required to ensure 

that specific provisions be implemented in dated 

increments  set  by  the  provisions  in  the  Act.  The 

sex trafficking provisions include:

• 

Identify, document, screen, and determine 

services for foster care children who are 

victims of or at risk of sex trafficking.

•  State child welfare agencies must immediately

must support the work of over 300 attorneys who represent parents

prevailing  billing  model  in  the  current  system  require  these 

attorneys to take on unmanageable caseloads to support themselves 

or their agencies. A constraint on judicial resources for dependency

Task Force on Legal
Representation 
in Childhood Dependency

During  2015,  the  Oregon  Legislature  passed  a  bill  creating  the  Task  Force 

on  Legal  Representation  in  Childhood  Dependency.  Some  of  the  issues  that 

prompted the passage of the bill have occurred over the last decade, the result 

of an outdated model of legal representation in dependency cases that has not 

kept  pace  with  present-day  costs  of  retaining  attorneys  for  dependency  cases. 

Attorneys who represent the State, the Department of Human Services (DHS), 

or children and parents cannot afford to take on the extensive work involved in 

dependency cases for the scheduled wages or flat fees that have not changed 

OJD’s Informal Domestic Relations Trial  (IDRT) program offered by Deschutes 

puts the rights and safeguards of children and families, as well as 

County Circuit Court (see page 28), where a good number of litigants have chosen 

other parties to dependency cases, at risk.

Elder abuse is an 
umbrella term that may 
include physical, sexual, 
or emotional abuse; 
financial exploitation; 
and neglect, abandonment 
or self-neglect. With 
our nation’s population 
continuing to grow older, 
it is important that courts 
provide appropriate

from foster care, determine the child’s experiences while absent from care, 

develop screening to determine if the child is a sex trafficking victim, and 

report information to the HHS.

OJD’s team has helped implement the provisions of the Preventing Sex Trafficking 

and  Strengthening  Families  Act  by  working  with  partners  to  bring  Oregon 

statutes into compliance, and providing sex trafficking training to CRB’s, judges, 

juvenile  law  attorneys,  other  stakeholders,  and  conducting  outreach  to  OJD’s 

Model Court Teams. During 2015, the team attended the National Summit on 

Human Trafficking & the State Courts in New York, the National Convening on 

Trafficking & Child Welfare at the White House, and held an education program 

for judges with national and local experts on human trafficking statistics, trends, 

and initiating active engagement to combat this issue. 

Looking forward to activities in 2016, the team expects to work with the Governor 

and  other  stakeholders  to  improve  Oregon’s  response  to  domestic  violence, 

sexual assault, and sex trafficking challenges. In particular, the Governor will lead 

an interbranch initiative to develop a framework, charge, proposed legislation, 

and resources to improve Oregon’s response to addressing sex trafficking, sexual 

assault, and domestic violence problems.

Protective Proceedings for Elders

The “baby boomer” generation (people currently between 52 and 70 years old) 

are  aging  into  their  more  senior  years  at  the  rate  of  10,000  per  day.  As  the 

elder  population  expands,  we  are  seeing  a  rise  in  reports  and  investigations 

of  elder  abuse  by  family  members,  acquaintances,  caregivers,  scammers,  and 

care  facilities.  Specific  laws  that  protect  the  elderly,  community  awareness, 

and mandatory reporting (by doctors, law enforcement, attorneys and others) 

are also bringing abuse issues that used to be hidden behind closed doors to 

light. Judges are seeing an increase in elder abuse cases in their courtrooms, 

necessitating continued education of judges, attorneys and law enforcement; 

and  coordination  with  community  services  and  adult  welfare  partners. 

Statewide court procedures and business processes for protective proceedings 

will need to be reviewed and developed.

Court Language Access Services

OJD’s  Court  Language  Access  Services  (CLAS)  coordinates  access  to 

interpreting services in Oregon circuit courts in more than 180 languages and 

dialects, including remote interpreter services through phone or video and sign 

language services for the hearing-impaired. With the passing of OJD-sponsored 

legislation in 2015, interpreters are also provided for crime victims who want 

to  attend  court  hearings.  During  2015,  CLAS  answered  32,815  requests  for 

interpreters, 1,038 of which were provided via telephone or video services.

LAS  provided  continuing  education  to  325  interpreters  and  held  training 

sessions on how to work with interpreters for 14 judicial and legal community 

groups in 2015. Language access training for OJD court staff was given in 21 

counties — Benton, Clackamas, Clatsop, Crook, Douglas, Hood River, Jackson, 

Jefferson,  Josephine,  Linn,  Malheur,  Marion,  Morrow,  Multnomah,  Polk, 

Tillamook,  Umatilla,  Wasco,  Washington,  Wasco,  and  Yamhill.  The  training 

included orientation to Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits 

discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and 

activities receiving federal financial assistance; as well as orientation to identifying 

language needs; obtaining an interpreter; remote interpreting services; accessing 

OJD translated forms; and filing a language access complaint. 

The  Oregon  state  courts  provide  accommodations  including  assistive  devices 

and sign language interpreters as necessary to ensure that court visitors, jurors, 

and  case  participants  with  disabilities  have  access  to  the  court’s  services  and 

programs.  Each  circuit  court  has  an  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (ADA) 

coordinator who can be contacted to ensure that accommodations are available. 

There is a statewide ADA coordinator located at the Office of the State Court 

Administrator, which maintains a webpage on the OJD website that provides

Strategies for 
the Future

The Work of CREW 

OJD’s Court Reengineering and Efficiencies Workgroup (CREW) continued 

its work throughout 2015 to identify, review, and recommend court efficiencies 

to the Chief Justice. CREW includes judges and trial court administrators from 

circuit courts across the state who identify and evaluate court innovations, tying 

them to the key strategic goals outlined in OJD’s 2014–2019 Strategic Plan:

•  Protect Public Access to Justice
•  Maintain Public Trust and Confidence
•  Provide Quality and Timely Dispute Resolution
•  Collaborate with Justice System Partners and Other Stakeholders
•  Enhance Judicial Administration

CREW  spent  the  past  year  engaged  in  review  of  multiple  statewide  business 

processes  (many  of  which  followed  time-sensitive  requests);  started  efforts 

to  identify  and  evaluate  opportunities  to  more  effectively  utilize  judicial 

resources  throughout  the  state;  drafted,  adopted,  and  implemented  the 

Oregon  Docket  Management  Initiative  (ODMI);  revised  the  OJD  Strategic 

Plan (now set for the next five years); and began initial efforts to expand how 

OJD  communicates  to  internal  and  external  stakeholders.  CREW  continued 

to  find  new  efficiencies,  shared  in  the  efforts  toward  improvements  within 

OJD  for  all  stakeholders,  and  actively  worked  toward  consistency  with 

available  resources.  The  active  engagement,  timely  responses,  and  valuable 

feedback  from  the  members  of  CREW  continue  to  advance  the  mission  of 

OJD  to  provide  fair  and  accessible  judicial  services  that  protect  the  rights  of 

individuals,  preserve  community  welfare,  and  inspire  public  confidence.

The  work  of  CREW  is  conducted  by  three  ongoing  subcommittees  and 

two  ad  hoc  workgroups.  The  standing  subcommittees,  Business  Processes, 

Organization  and  Structure,  and  Communication  (Outreach,  Internet,  and 

Social  Media),  undertake  new  assignments  throughout  the  year.  Ad 

hoc  workgroups  were  given  the  charge  to  refresh  the  OJD

As  each  circuit  court  prepares  to  “go  live”  with  the  Odyssey  case

and promote statewide consistencies. The review of these business 

processes  is  vetted  through  the  subcommittee,  which  reviews, 

analyzes, discusses, and may take a second look in an effort to find 

the best option for a statewide solution. Topics considered in 2015 

included:  whether a formal ORCP 69 Order of Default should be 

required in Show Cause proceedings; establishment of a policy to 

use Oregon eCourt functionality to relate parties to cases based on 

familial relationships; assistance with developing statewide business

and  evaluate  effective  judicial  resource  structures 

to  efficiently  deliver  timely

to  either  coincide  with  an  implementation  update  to  the  Oregon

In  addition,  the  survey  solicited  feedback  on 

knowledge and use of the complex litigation and 

commercial  court  programs.  All  presiding  judges 

completed  the  survey  and  shared  feedback  on  a 

range of solutions: remote judging through video 

conferencing,  judge  swap  between  districts,  and 

the  need  for  statewide  policy  decisions  associated  with  the 

inclusion  of  senior  judges  to  fill  in  gaps.  The 

development  and  use  of  court  forms  for  both  internal  and 

subcommittee completed the initial analysis of the 

external  use.  To  ensure  greater  consistency  across  the  state  and

that we administer 
justice ‘completely and 
without delay.’ ”

— Oregon Supreme Court 
Chief Justice Thomas A.  
Balmer

Communication: Outreach, Internet, and 
Social Media Subcommittee
With  constant  change  and  advancement  in  technology,  OJD  has  found  it 

necessary  to  look  for  new,  innovative,  and  web-related  ways  to  communicate 

information  internally,  with  external  stakeholders,  and  with  the  public.  The 

subcommittee has started drafting a formal strategic communication plan for 

OJD, is developing guidelines to govern content and  format of  the OJD web 

pages, and is working on a social media engagement strategy for the public and 

court stakeholders.

Ad Hoc Workgroups

2014–2019 OJD Strategic Plan  
This ad hoc workgroup was charged with updating the 2009–2013 OJD Strategic 

Plan,  looking  forward  into  the  next  five  years.  The  purpose  of  updating  the 

OJD Strategic Plan was to promote improvements in service access and define 

efficiencies  in  our  internal  systems  given  the  resources  we  have  and  hope  to 

enhance over the course of the next few years.  The plan stands strong in its 

foundation  of  values,  goals,  strategies,  and  framework;  and,  after  a  thorough 

review and feedback received from judges, leadership, and staff, now expands 

upon the Plan’s initiatives.      

Oregon Docket Management Initiative (ODMI)
Docket and caseflow management is at the heart of effective and efficient court 

management. Compared to the other duties and responsibilities of judges and 

court managers, docket and caseflow management is most directly related to the 

imperative in the Oregon Constitution that the state courts administer justice 

“completely and without delay.” Under the direction of the Chief Justice, this ad 

hoc workgroup gathered docketing information, concepts, data, strategies, and 

national trends to create the basis for a statewide discussion on effective and 

efficient  caseflow  and  docket  management  techniques.  After  several  months 

of  work  and  input  from  presiding  judges  and  trial  court  administrators,  a 

recommendation report was drafted for Chief Justice review. The Chief Justice 

adopted the following ODMI guiding principles in January 2015 to support the 

leadership role that judges and staff play in promoting timely and affordable 

justice for Oregonians and the goal of the OJD Strategic Plan to “provide quality 

and timely dispute resolution” by heightening caseflow and docket management 

accountability: 

Docket management refers to the management of assigning cases to judges and managing groups of case types and similar cases.  In many ways, 
this can be viewed as a calendar and judicial resource management function within a particular court. Caseflow management refers to the way a 
particular type of case moves through the court, from filing to disposition. This is a business process function that requires the identification and 
documentation of each step and the time spent in between each step.

employs differentiated case management techniques where 

appropriate. 

•  The court sets case processing goals and uses consistent  

data to monitor compliance with the goals.

This  initiative  will  be  continuously  supported  through  open 

discussions,  education,  and  planning  efforts  within  each  court 

as well as statewide to advance OJD’s mission to provide fair and 

accessible  judicial  services  that  protect  the  rights  of  individuals, 

preserve community welfare, and inspire public confidence.

Preserving the Past, Building 
for the Future 

Three counties and state circuit courts moved ahead on facility improvements 

in  2015,  with  the  Oregon  Legislature’s  earlier  approval  of  matching  funding. 

State  funding  with  matching  county  funds  has  made  it  possible  for  counties 

to  renovate  and  replace  unsafe  courthouse  facilities,  which  is  an  important 

aspect of modernizing OJD’s foundational framework to bring accessible court 

services to the public. Courthouse projects on the move in 2015 included:

New Union County Courthouse
Construction of a new Union County courthouse in La Grande was completed 

at the end of December 2015. Union County Circuit Court judges and staff 

built  in  1937)  and  open  for  business  in  the  new  courthouse  on  Leap  Day, 

February 29, 2016.

Multnomah County Courthouse
During  2015,  a  cost-effective  construction  site  (land  owned  by  Multnomah 

County at the west end of the Hawthorne Bridge in Portland) was selected by 

the  Multnomah  County  Board  of  Commissioners  on  which  to  build  a  new 

Multnomah County Courthouse that will be the largest in the state. The Oregon 

Legislature approved an additional $17.4 million in matching funds through the 

sale of state bonds to help Multnomah County continue with the design phase 

of the project. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2017.

The Judicial Branch  
is symbolized in every 
county by a courthouse 
facility that provides 
continuous assurance 
that justice is available 
to everyone in every 
community. In many 
communities, not only   
does the courthouse 
symbolize the availability 
of justice to all, but it 
serves as the seat of county 
government and the focal 
point of community life.

Supreme Court Building Rehabilitation
On August 3, 2015, OJD began an exterior and interior rehabilitation project 

on the 102-year-old Supreme Court Building in Salem (the only building owned 

by OJD) to address public safety and building preservation issues.

The building’s cornices received new steel infrastructure, tile rebuilding, and 

new copper flashing; deteriorating columns were rebuilt from the inside out 

with new steel infrastructure, tiles, and mortar; miscellaneous masonry repairs 

were made on decorative details including the eagle wings; entrance canopies 

were  repaired;  and  building  fire  escapes  were  repaired.  All  of  the  terra  cotta 

tiles and the rest of the building surfaces were cleaned, revealing the original 

brightness of the materials.

Interior  repairs  were  made  in  third  floor  offices;  windows  looking  out  from 

each landing on the grand stairwell were removed and rebuilt, as were windows 

in the law library, office areas on the first, second, and third floors, 

and  in  the  second  floor  conference  room.  The  Appellate  Court 

Records Division public service window area was remodeled, the 

hot  water  heater  in  the  basement  was  replaced,  and  the  south 

vestibule entrance doors were repaired.

The  project  has  now  reached  substantial  completion  status.  The 

need  for  some  additional  repairs  to  the  southwest  corner  of  the 

building was discovered, which involves ordering additional terra 

cotta tiles. As the lead time for the terra cotta tiles is quite lengthy, 

the additional repair work is expected to take place in June 2016. 

Only a small section of the scaffolding remains along the southwest 

corner of the building.

Ground was broken in March 2015 to begin construction of a new courthouse in 

Madras, to accommodate the Jefferson County Circuit Court and the Jefferson 

County District Attorney’s Office. Construction is scheduled to be completed 

in August 2016, and judges and staff will move to the new courthouse in July 

2016.

In 2015, 503,244 cases 
were filed in Oregon’s 
circuit courts. Almost 
1,500 cases are filed 
in Oregon circuit courts  
every day, including  
civil cases, felonies,       
and civil commitments.

Case
Statistics 

Between 500,000 and 600,000 cases are filed in Oregon circuit courts every 

year.  Cases  filed  include  traffic  tickets,  disputes  over  minor  fender-benders, 

divorces,  contested  child  custody  cases,  complex  securities  and  trade  secrets 

controversies, serious medical malpractice cases, and cases involving criminal 

acts. All subject matter of cases (civil, criminal, family, juvenile, and probate) 

are  heard  in  the  circuit  courts,  which  are  Oregon’s  courts  of  “general 

jurisdiction,” except for cases involving tax laws, which are heard by the Oregon 

Tax Court. Circuit court case decisions may be appealed to the Oregon  Court 

of Appeals, which will issue a decision in the case. The Court of Appeals also 

decides petitions for judicial review of certain contested agency decisions and 

challenges  to  agency  rules.  A  party  who  is  dissatisfied  with  the  Court  of 

Appeals  decision  may  petition  the  Oregon  Supreme  Court  to  review  that 

decision.  The  Supreme  Court  can  choose  to  allow  or  deny  the  petition. 

The Supreme Court also hears direct appeals and reviews in certain types 

of  proceedings,  including  death-penalty  appeals,  certain  pre-trial  criminal 

appeals, some election-related matters, lawyer discipline and judicial fitness 

matters, and appeals from the Oregon Tax Court.

OJD statistics are collected yearly and issued in February of the following year. 

This section contains the most recent five-year trends in annual case filings for 

the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, circuit courts, and Tax Court. 

The State of Oregon Law Library’s collection, located in the Oregon Supreme Court Building, includes approximately 165,000 volumes and extensive 
digital and online resources, as well as historical legal documents and rare books, United States government publications, and legal periodicals. The 
Law Library’s services and resources are available to judges, court staff, attorneys, state agencies, and the general public.

*  Case filing statistics for calendar years 2012 and 2013 include preliminary Oregon eCourt case    
  filing statistics and may be adjusted.

The types of cases filed in circuit courts have changed since 2011, with fewer violations, misdemeanor, and civil 

and criminal cases being filed, while the numbers of felonies and probate cases have increased. Felony case filings 

have the greatest proportional impact on the courts, requiring extensive use of both judicial and staff resources. 

Violations, small claims, and landlord/tenant cases represent large numbers of filings but require comparatively 

less judicial and staff resources per case. Violations also represent 75% of the fines revenue collected by OJD.

Statistics 

Fiscal Overview 

OJD  receives  funding  for  its  operating  costs  primarily  from  legislative 

appropriations  out  of  the  State  General  Fund.    OJD’s  General  Fund 

appropriation for 2013–2015 amounted to $402 million — approximately 2.53% 

of the General Fund Budget.

The  2015–2017  General  Fund  appropriation  was  $431.8  million  —  7.4% 

greater than the 2013–2015 appropriation. Other revenue amounts are added 

to  the  budget  to  cover  non-operating  costs  such  as  Oregon  eCourt,  facilities 

improvements, and debt payments on bonds. These other funds must receive 

legislative approval and are provided through bond sales, federal funds (usually 

grants), and “other funds.” Total OJD funding in 2013–2015, counting other 

funds, was $511 million; in 2015–2017 it was $586 million.

Increases to OJD funding for the 2015–2017 biennium were due to continuing 

improvements in Oregon’s economy and legislative approval of some of OJD’s 

requests. Those funds allowed OJD to:

•  Restore resources to OJDs Family Law program that were eliminated due 

to budget reduction in a prior biennium

•  Provide cost of living increases for judges and OJD staff 
•  Provide resources for technology, training, and business support related  

to Oregon eCourt 

•  Add court positions to adjudicate cases generated by expansion of  

photo-radar enforcement in the city of Portland 

•  Complete the implementation of Oregon eCourt 
•  Continue the operation of treatment courts 
•  Selling state bonds to help several counties begin to replace or renovate 

unsafe county-owned courthouses

Funding to achieve 
minimum service level 
requirements in our circuit 
courts will:

• Ensure a 72-hour maximum 
for timely entry of court 
documents for enforcement

• Ensure a 24-hour maximum 
for timely entry of recall of

• Support a minimum of seven

Oregon eCourt processes that are replacing them. 

OJD eFiling allows filers to electronically file, serve, distribute, and deliver court documents 24 hours as day from home, 

office, or any other location, in circuit courts that have gone live with the Oregon eCourt Case information system (OECI) 

and eFiling. Filing fees in the Oregon circuit courts that have implemented OJD File & Serve are paid online through the 

OJD File & Serve process and integrated into the Oregon eCourt case management and financial management system. 

The Oregon Tax Court will begin using OJD eFiling in 2016. The Oregon appellate courts use a separate eFiling system 

that operates in a similar manner.

OJD conducted testing of the OJD Guide & File online interactive iForms system with volunteers from the Salem business and legal assistance com-
munities before it was opened to the public in September 2015. OJD Guide & File assists self-represented users in filling out court forms through an 
online interview that generates a correctly completed form based on the user’s answers. Some of the forms can be eFiled through OJD Guide & File, 
others can be printed and submitted to the court (all courts will have OJD Guide & File for some forms by July 18, 2016). The most frequently used 
family law forms are in development to be the next set of interview-based forms for use by the public.

of  OJD’s 

internet  communication  methods  will  require  specialized 

communications staff who can best prepare clear current information, news, 

updates,  and  instructions  for  citizens  who  conduct  court  business  through 

OJD’s online services; and who will develop and monitor informational social 

media engagement with the public and court stakeholders.

We  will  continue  to  ask  the  Oregon  Legislature  to  permanently  fund  the 

operation  of  treatment,  family,  juvenile,  mental  health,  and  veterans  court 

programs that are successfully dealing with crimes related to societal problems 

and  have  proved  to  reduce  recidivism  and  improve  public  safety  in  our 

communities.  Treatment  courts  produce  the  most  effective  long-term  results 

that often are not achieved in traditional courtroom proceedings. And, as the 

courts become more involved in ensuring the protection of vulnerable persons, 

as in the cases of elder abuse and human trafficking, expertise will be needed 

within  the  courts  —  through  trained  judges  and  staff,  and  development  of 

inally, we will continue to work with the Oregon Legislature, the Oregon State 

Bar, and our county partners to ensure that all Oregonians can seek justice in 

effective programs in those areas.

“OJD had a successful 
[2015 Legislative] 
session.  We received 
the funding we need to 
operate the court system 
at its current levels, but 
we did not get all the 
additional resources 
we asked for either to 
restore previously reduced 
staffing or that we need 
to serve the people of 
Oregon as effectively as 
we should in the future.  
In several ways, OJD 
has not fully recovered 
from the recession-era 
budget and service 
level reductions that 
started in the 2009–11 
biennium.”

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
