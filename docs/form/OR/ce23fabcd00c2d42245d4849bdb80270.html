OREGON JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT 
 
POLICY AND STANDARDS FOR ACCEPTANCE OF ELECTRONIC FILINGS IN THE 
OREGON CIRCUIT COURTS  
Version 1.0 5/22/2015 

PURPOSE 

Statewide standards for the acceptance of electronic filings are intended to provide clear 
consistent guidance to practitioners and courts on the proper use of the OJD eFiling system 
(File and Serve).  The standards are grouped into two broad categories:  (1) how to properly use 
the system from a technical perspective to ensure acceptance of eFiled documents, and (2) 
compliance with Uniform Trial Court Rules (UTCR) Chapter 21 or ORCP 9E.   

These standards will help educate efilers on the correct usage of File and Serve to provide them 
with a high quality experience, support consistent statewide messages to accompany returned 
electronic filings with instructions on how to cure the error, and allow the Oregon Judicial 
Department (OJD) and efilers to achieve the full benefits of an electronic filing system.  

These Standards were drafted with the following principles in mind: 

•  Ensure an open and efficient court system 
•  Reasons for acceptance and return should be clear and consistent statewide 
•  Reasons for acceptance and return should remove legal decision making from front line 

•  Reasons for acceptance and return should provide guidance on how to use the system 

consistent with UTCR Chapter 21 

court staff 

 

 
BACKGROUND 

OJD first launched Odyssey File and Serve, a Tyler Technologies product, on April 1, 2013, in 
Yamhill County, followed by seven additional circuit courts between May 2013 and October 
2013 (in order):  Crook, Jefferson, Linn, Jackson, Clatsop, Columbia, and Tillamook.  Between 
March 2014 and July 2014 Benton, Polk, and Multnomah successfully implemented File and 
Serve.   

Effective December 1, 2014, the Chief Justice signed an order directing mandatory eFiling for 
active members of the Oregon State Bar in the 11 counties that were then utilizing the File and 
Serve system.   

As each circuit court “goes live” with the Odyssey case management system, the 
implementation process provides for permissive eFiling to begin 30 business days after a court 

implements Odyssey, and mandatory eFiling to begin 60 business days after implementation of 
Odyssey.  For example, Douglas, Josephine, and Marion Counties implemented Odyssey on 
December 8, 2014, permissive eFiling began January 20, 2015, and mandatory eFiling 
commenced on March 2, 2015.  Mandatory eFiling for active members of the Oregon State Bar 
will be in place in all Oregon circuit courts by the fall of 2016. 

As the first courts began utilizing the File and Serve system, inconsistencies appeared in court 
practices concerning the acceptance and return of electronic filings.  The Oregon eCourt 
Executive Team identified the need for consistency across all courts in the implementation of 
File and Serve and subsequently identified an interim policy with six reasons to return an 
electronic filing.  

The Office of the State Court Administrator (OSCA) continued to collect feedback from courts 
and efilers related to inconsistencies surrounding the acceptance and return of electronic filings.  
OSCA used this information along with electronic filing statistics, to develop these statewide 
standards for the consistent practice of acceptance and return of electronic filings in the circuit 
courts statewide.  The courts initially vetted the proposed standards and the OJD Court 
Reengineering and Efficiencies Workgroup reviewed and recommended the final draft 
standards.  The Chief Justice adopted the standards as part of his policy for the statewide use 
of the OJD eFiling system. (CJO 15-026).  

STANDARDS POLICY (CJO 15-026) 

As provided by the Chief Justice Order, the policy is: 

1)  The Oregon Circuit Courts shall accept filings electronically submitted through the OJD 
eFiling System (File and Serve) unless such filing fails to comply with these Standards.  

2)  Electronic filings that fail to comply with these Standards will be returned by electronic notice 
to the efiler to cure the problem(s) and resubmit to the court.  The OJD eFiling system term 
that identifies the return of a document or filing to the efiler is labeled a “rejection”. 

3)  The court will notify the efiler of the reason for the return of the filing by using the proper 

return code and provide any applicable information to the efiler to assist with resubmittal.  
Notifications will be sent automatically by the electronic filing system unless the efiler user 
has opted out of receiving such notifications.  Users who opt-out will not receive a 
notification from the court regarding the returned electronic filing. 

4)  Electronic filings returned (“rejected”) through the OJD eFiling system are not considered 

filed with the circuit court.  An efiler must correctly resubmit the electronic filing to the circuit 
court and have it accepted by the court, in order to be considered successfully filed.  An 
efiler can affirmatively request relation-back on the filed date of a returned (and corrected) 
filing by following the process and procedure outlined in Uniform Trial Court Rule 21.080(5). 

5)  To maintain currency, these Standards may be amended on an as-needed basis by the 

State Court Administrator for changes as approved by the Chief Justice.

TANDARDS MAINTENANCE 

he Office of Education, Training, and Outreach (OETO) will monitor statistics on eFiling 

acceptance and returns and provide quarterly reports to the courts and leadership for review.  
Once all courts have implemented eFiling, these reports will be reduced to yearly.  Mandatory 
eFiling for Oregon attorneys will be in place in all Oregon circuit courts by the fall of 2016. 

ETO, ETSD, and Tyler Technologies, with input from courts and eFiling users, will work 

together on any necessary changes to these Standards, as well as technical issues and 
configuration changes to File and Serve.  All changes to these Standards and the File and 
Serve system will be communicated with the courts and efilers through multiple mediums to 
enhance and ensure the efficiency of the system for all users.

OJD eFILING STANDARDS FOR ACCEPTANCE AND NON-ACCEPTANCE 
(REJECTION1) IN FILE AND SERVE 

OJD eFilings shall only be returned (rejected) to a filer for failure to comply with any one of three 
broad categories:  

1)  The filing fails to comply with an OJD eFiling process requirement,  
2)  The filing fails to comply with a UTCR requirement or ORCP 9E; or 
3)  The filing includes or has encountered a technical error. 

Below are detailed reasons the circuit courts will reject a filing in each of the three broad 
categories:  

1.  Failure to Comply with an eFiling Process 

If the filer fails to follow a required eFiling process, use the below reason(s): 

a.  A Filer Initiates a New Case When a Case Already Exists 

Filer selects New Case and files the document(s) when the case already exists; 
acceptance of this type of filing would result in the creation of a new case. 

  File and Serve Description:  This case already exists, please file through the existing 

case. 
 

b.  Wrong Case Type Selected When Initiating A Case 

Filer selected the incorrect case type when filing their initial pleadings. 

  File and Serve Description: The wrong case type was selected, please use the 

following case type: [Court Input] 

c.  Wrong Filing Code Selected 

Filer selects an incorrect filing code; acceptance of this type of filing results in court staff 
determining the correct code, changing the code, fixing time standards, and/or resolving 
other data entry issues in File and Serve and/or Odyssey. 

  File and Serve Description:  The wrong filing code was selected, please use the 

following code: [Court Input]. 

d.  Document Must Be Submitted as a Proposed Order – PPOR 
Filer attempts to file a proposed order using another code.  

  File and Serve Description:  Document must be submitted as Order – Proposed –

1 The OJD eFiling System (File and Serve) allows court staff to take two actions on eFiled documents; 
documents can either be accepted or rejected.  When court staff rejects a document or filing, they select a 
rejection reason code.  OJD uses the term rejection here for consistency purposes with the technical 
aspects of the system.
