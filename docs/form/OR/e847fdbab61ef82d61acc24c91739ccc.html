      <pre>INFORMAL DOMESTIC RELATIONS TRIAL 
Is it the Right Choice for Your Case? 

A  new  type  of  trial  is  now  available  for  domestic  relations  cases  statewide:  an 
Informal  Domestic  Relations  Trial  (IDRT).  This  type  of  trial  differs  from 
Traditional  Trials  in  several  ways.  If  you  are  interested  in  an  IDRT  trial,  please 
read the information below.  

Domestic relations cases include divorce, separation, unmarried parent, and modification cases 
about child custody, parenting time, and child support. You may choose the type of trial that you 
think is best for your case. 

What is a Traditional Trial? 
In a Traditional Trial, lawyers or people who 
themselves  usually  present 
represent 
information 
judge  by  asking 
questions of witnesses. Each side gets to ask 
follow-up questions of the other person and 
their  wit-  nesses.  Generally,  the  judge  asks 
few, if any, questions. 

the 

to 

The  Rules  of  Evidence  apply.  The  Rules  of 
Evidence  place 
limits  on  the  things  a 
witness  can  talk  about  and  the  kind  of 
documents that can be given to the judge to 
read. If you or the other person has a lawyer 
in  a  Traditional  Trial,  the  lawyer  will  make 
opening  statements  and  closing  arguments 
to  the  judge  and  will  ask  questions  of  you, 
the other person, and other witnesses. If you 
represent  yourself,  you  will  be  expected  to 
follow the Rules of Evidence and you will be 
the  one  to  make  opening  statements  and 
to  question

Informal  Domestic 

What 
is  an 
Relations Trial (IDRT)? 
In  an  Informal  Domestic  Relations  Trial 
(IDRT),  you  and  the  other  person  speak 
directly  to  the  judge  about  the  issues  that 
are  disputed,  such  as  child  custody  and 
dividing  property  or  debts.  A  question  and 
answer  format  is  not  used.  Only  the  judge 
asks questions of each person. This happens 
even if you or the other person has a lawyer. 
Usually,  other  witnesses  are  not  allowed  to 
testify.  You  can,  however,  ask  the  court  to 
let an expert witness testify, such as doctor, 
counselor, or custody evaluator. 

The  Rules  of  Evidence  do  not  apply  in  an 
IDRT.  This  means  you  can  tell  the  judge 
everything that you think is important. You 
also  can  give  the  judge  any  documents  or 
papers  you  want  the  judge  to  review.  The 
judge  will  decide  the  importance  of  what 
you and the other person say and the papers 
you  each  give  to  the  judge.  In  an  Informal 
Domestic  Relations  Trial,  lawyers  are  only 
allowed to: 

•
•

say what the issues in the case are,
respond when the judge asks if there 
are  other  areas  as 
the  person 
wants  the court to ask about, and
• make short arguments about the law

at the end of the case.

The  Informal  Domestic  Relations  Trial  is  a 
voluntary  process.  In  other  words,  you 
decide  whether  it  is  something  you want  to 
do.    An  IDRT  will  be  used  only  if  both 
people involved in the case agree to it.  Both 
people must complete a form that says what 
type of trial they choose.

INFORMAL DOMESTIC RELATIONS TRIAL 
Is it the Right Choice for Your Case? 

Why  would  I  choose  a  Traditional 
Trial? 
1.  Your  case  is  complicated.  You  and  the 
other person own a business or have lots 
of  stocks,  property,  and  retirement 
funds to divide.  

2.  Rules  and  formal  procedures  are  in 
place  to  protect  each  person’s  rights.  
The  Rules  of  Evidence  apply.  You  or 
your  lawyer  may  feel  more  comfortable 
with this structure. 

3.  You  like  the  fact  that  the  Rules  of 
Evidence  will  limit  what  people  can  say 
and the information that can be given to 
the judge in writing. 

4.   The question and answer format will be 
more  effective 
the 
information  about  your  case.  It  may  be 
important  to  be  able  to  ask  the  other 
person follow-up questions. 

in  getting  out 

5.  You  may  bring  any  witnesses  you  think 

are important to court. 

6.  Generally,  written  statements 

from 
family  members,  teachers,  and  friends 
will  not  be  considered  by  the  judge. 
People with something to say about your 
situation  or  the  other person’s  situation 
will need to come to court.

circumstances and the facts to the judge. 
2.  Fewer rules apply, so Informal Domestic 
Relations  Trials  are  more 
flexible. 
IDRTs may be easier for people who are 
representing  themselves.  The  judge  is 
more  involved  in  asking  questions  and 
guiding  the  process.  The  judge  may  be 
able  to  reduce  conflict  between  the  two 
sides  and  help  them  focus  on  the 
children or other issues.

3.  You  can  speak  directly  to  the  judge 
without 
about 
interruption  or  objections  from  the 
other person or their lawyer.  The other 
person 
is  not  allowed  to  ask  you 
questions. 

situation 

4.  You  do  not  have  to  worry  about  formal 
rules  that  limit  what  you  can  say  in 
court.  You can: 
•  Speak  freely  about  conversations 
between  you  and  other  people  who 
are not in court. 

•  Talk  to  the  judge  about  what  your 
children have said about custody and 
parenting time. 

•  Tell  the  judge  whatever you  think  is 
important  before  he  or  she  makes  a 
decision about your case. 

5.  You  can  give  any  documents  you  think 

are important to the judge. 

6.  Informal Domestic Relations Trials may 
be  shorter.  A  lawyer  may  be  able  to 
prepare  in  a  shorter  amount  of  time. 
Therefore,  the  cost  to  have  a  lawyer 
represent  you  may  be  less.    You  may 
have to take less time off from work. 

7.  The 

judge  usually,  but  not  always, 
makes  a  decision  the  same  day  as  the 
trial.

Trial Works: 
1.  When  the  Informal  Domestic  Relations 
Trial begins both people will be asked if: 
• 
they  understand  the  rules  and  how 
the trial works, and 
they  agreed  to  participate  in  the 
IDRT voluntarily. 

• 

2.  The  person  that  started  the  case  will 
speak first.  He or she swears to tell the 
truth  and  may  speak  about  anything  he 
or she wishes. 

3.  He or she is not questioned by a lawyer. 
Instead, 
judge  will  ask  some 
questions  in  order  to  make  a  better 
decision.

4.  If  the  person  talking  has  a  lawyer,  then 
that  lawyer  may  ask  the  judge  to  ask 
their client questions on specific topics. 
5.  This  process  is  repeated  for  the  other 

person. 

6.  If  there  are  any  experts,  the  expert’s 
report may be given to the judge. Either 
person  may  also  ask  to  have  the  expert 
testify and be questioned by the judge or 
the other person. 

7.  Each person may submit documents and 
other  evidence  that  they  want  to  the 
judge to see. The judge will look at each 
document  and  decide  whether  it  is 
trustworthy and should be considered. 
8.  Each  person  may  briefly  respond  to 
comments made by the other person. 
9.  Each person or their lawyer may make a 
short legal argument about how the laws 
apply to their case. 

10. Once  all  the  above  steps  are  complete, 
the  judge  states  their  decision.  In  some 
cases, the judge may give the ruling at a 
later date. 

11.  Any of the above steps may be modified 
by  the  judge  in  order  to  make  sure  the 
trial is fair for both people.

INFORMAL DOMESTIC RELATIONS TRIAL 
Is it the Right Choice for Your Case? 

1.  You have to decide which type of trial you want to have. Both people must agree to have an 
Informal Domestic Relations Trial. The case will be scheduled for a traditional trial if both 
people want a Traditional Trial or if only one person wants a Traditional Trial. 

2.  Before the trial starts there are several documents that each person must prepare and give to 

• 

the judge and the other person: 
•  A list of everything you and your spouse own and owe. If possible, it is best to give the 
judge one list, even if you do not agree on what each item is worth or who should get it. 
If there are children and child support is an issue or if spousal support is an issue, the 
Uniform  Support  Declaration.  If  the  Uniform  Support  Declaration  is  not  required,  you 
must  submit  an  alternate  affidavit.  An  affidavit  is  a  notarized  letter  explaining  why  a 
Uniform Support Declaration is not applicable in your case. 
If there are children, a parenting schedule. 

• 

3.  Before the trial starts, each person must give the judge and the other person a copy of all of 
the documents and other evidence that you will give to the judge to consider. In a traditional 
trial the judge will decide if the information can be used during the trial. 

4.  The Judge will follow the law and will consider the factors that the law requires in making a 

decision about your case. 

5.  After the trial is over, the judge will direct one person (or their lawyer if they have one) to 
draft  a  final  judgment  in  writing.    The  final,  written  judgment  must  contain  all  of  the 
decisions the judge made at the end of the trial.  The case is not over until the judge receives 
the final written judgment and signs it.
