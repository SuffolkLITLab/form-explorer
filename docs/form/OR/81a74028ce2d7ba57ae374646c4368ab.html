I.  THE PETITION 

 

A.  Venue 
A Family Abuse Prevention Act (FAPA) petition 
must be filed in the county where either party 
resides. No minimum period of residence is 
required. 
 
B.  Showing Required 

A Petitioner is entitled to relief under FAPA when 

1.  “abuse,” as defined in ORS 107.705(1), has 

occurred 

a.  within the preceding 180 days (see I.E.3. 

(pg. 4) regarding exceptions to this 
requirement) 

b.  between “family or household members,” 

as defined in ORS 107.705(4); 

2.  Petitioner is in "imminent danger of further 

abuse" by Respondent; and 

3.  Respondent represents a credible threat to 

the physical safety of Petitioner or 
Petitioner’s child/ren. 
 

C.  Definitions 

1.  “Abuse” is the occurrence of one or more of 

the following acts between family or 
household members: 

a.  attempting to cause or intentionally, 

knowingly, or recklessly causing bodily 
injury; 

b.  intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly 

placing another in fear of imminent bodily 
injury; or 

c.  causing another to engage in involuntary 

sexual relations by force or threat of force. 

ntil 2007, FAPA forms were promulgated by statute. 

ORS 107.718(7) now requires that the State Court 
Administrator (SCA) prescribe the forms described by 
FAPA. 

ORS 107.728. 

ORS 107.710; ORS 107.718. 

ORS 107.705(1) (definition of abuse). 

ORS 107.710(1), (6). 

ORS 107.705(4) (definition of family or household 
members). 

ORS 107.710(1); ORS 107.718(1). 

ORS 107.718(1). 
See I.C.6. (pg. 3). 

ORS 107.705(1). 

The test is whether a reasonable person faced with 
such behavior would be placed in fear of imminent 
bodily injury. Fielder v. Fielder, 211 Or App 668 
(2007). The “placed in fear” element is established by 
consideration of the totality of the circumstances, and 
neither overt threats nor physical violence is required. 
Fielder, 211 Or App at 694. The Court of Appeals 
recently interpreted “imminent” to mean “near at 
hand,” “impending,” or “menacingly near.” Holbert v. 
Noon, 245 Or App 328, 334-336 (2011). Evidence 
outside the 180-day window may be considered. 
Strother and Strother, 130 Or App 624 (1994) (abuse 
found where verbal statements Respondent made 
during six-month window were the same as those that 
preceded battering during much earlier period of the 
relationship). See also Lefebvre v. Lefebvre, 165 Or 
App 297 (2000) (behavior that is “erratic, intrusive, 
volatile, and persistent” may be sufficiently fear- 
inducing). Compare Roshto v. McVein, 207 Or App 
700 (2006) (inundation of e-mail and phone 
messages and asking institutions to send Petitioner 
junk mail without threat of physical harm is 
insufficient).

ORS 107.705(4). 

2.  “Family or Household Members” include 

a.  spouses; 

b.  former spouses; 

c.  adult persons related by blood, marriage, 

or adoption; 

d.  persons who are cohabiting or who have 

cohabited with each other; 

                 

 

Abuse may be claimed solely or partially on the basis 
of verbal threats placing one in fear of imminent 
bodily injury. Although the Oregon appellate courts 
have not held that the more rigorous scrutiny applied 
to speech-based conduct in stalking cases applies 
also to FAPA proceedings, footnotes in two Court of 
Appeals decisions signal appellate interest in the 
issue. See Holbert v. Noon, 245 Or App 328, 338 n 6 
(2011), and Roshto v. McVein, 207 Or App 700, 705 n 
2 (2006) (comments in both cases noting that 
Respondent did not assert such a constitutional 
claim). 

The statute does not define "cohabitation." A test of 
common residence and sexual intimacy should be 
assumed based on legislative history ("roommates" 
were not intended to be covered by FAPA) and 
related case law. In a recent juvenile court case, the 
Court of Appeals held that the definition of "persons 
cohabiting with each other," as used in ORS 
135.230(3), (4), "refers to persons living in the same 
residence in a relationship akin to that of spouses." 
State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. C. M. C., 243 Or App 335, 
339 (2011) (interpreting the definition of "persons 
cohabiting with each other" in the criminal code for 
purposes of applying OEC 803(26), the domestic 
violence exception to the hearsay rule). The court 
also cited its holding in Edwards and Edwards, 73 Or 
App 272 (1985), that focused on a common domicile, 
shared living expenses, and a sexual relationship 
when interpreting the term "cohabitation" in a spousal 
support modification case. 

   

 

 

 

 

See discussion regarding Paternity at III.D.5. (pg. 14). 

f.  unmarried parents of a child. 

ORS 107.705(2). 

ORS 107.705(5) - (8). 

e.  persons who have been involved in a 

sexually intimate relationship within two 
years immediately preceding the filing of 
the petition; and 

3.  “Child” means an unmarried person under 18 

years of age. 

4.  The terms “interfere,” “intimidate,” “menace,” 

and “molest” are defined in FAPA. See 
definitions at III.A.2. (pg. 6). 

 

- 2 - 

 

ORS 107.718(5). 
The totality of the evidence heard is relevant to 
determining the element of “imminent danger of 
further abuse.” Abuse outside the 180-day window 
may be considered. Lefebvre v. Lefebvre, 150 Or 
App 297 (2000) (previous obsession with killing 
employer is relevant to whether Petitioner is currently 
in immediate danger of further abuse).  An overt 
threat of physical violence is not required. Id. at 303. 
See Maffey and Muchka, 244 Or App 308 (2011) 
(order upheld based on the past pattern of abusive 
behavior, now escalating, and Respondent’s violation 
of the order before the contested hearing); Hubbell v. 
Sanders, 245 Or App 321 (2011) (Respondent 
chasing Petitioner in his car, persistent trespasses on 
her property, and a threat to her friend even after 
issuance of the order held sufficient). Compare Baker 
and Baker, 216 Or App 205 (2007) (lack of evidence 
of Petitioner’s current fear of Respondent or his 
concern about a repeat of events fatal to the 
“imminency” element). 
Two recent cases clarify that subjective assertions of 
fear alone do not establish the element of “imminent 
danger of further abuse.” C. J. P. v. Lempea, 251 Or 
App 656 (2012); Hubbell, 245 Or App at 330. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ORS 107.726. 

Note that a two-year limitation does not exist for 
minors who have been in a sexually intimate 
relationship with Respondent, as it does for adult 
Petitioners. 

 

- 3 - 

5.  “Imminent Danger of Further Abuse” 

This requirement is met by a showing that may 
include, but is not limited to, recent threats of 
additional bodily harm. 

6.  “Credible Threat” 

This element of a FAPA claim is very similar to 
the “imminent danger” prong. Evidence for one 
often satisfies the other. See, e.g., Hubbell v. 
Sanders, 245 Or App 321, 327 (2011). The 
“credible threat” language was added to FAPA 
to harmonize Oregon law with federal law 
imposing criminal liability on a Respondent who 
possesses or uses firearms or ammunition 
while subject to qualifying protective order. 18 
USC 922(g)(8). See III.B.1.d.1 (pg. 10). 

 

D.  When Minors May Petition 

1.  A person under the age of 18 may petition 

for a FAPA restraining order if 

a.  Respondent is 18 years of age or older 

and 

b.  Petitioner is 

1)  the spouse of Respondent, 

2)  the former spouse of Respondent, or 

3)  a person who has been in a sexually 

intimate relationship with Respondent. 

ORS 107.710(1), (6). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ORS 107.710(1). 

The location (i.e., the state) of the abuse can be 
significant for purposes of determining whether 
sufficient minimum contacts exist to establish 
personal jurisdiction. However, for purposes of 
subject matter jurisdiction, the abuse need not have 
occurred in Oregon. 

2.  The court will need to appoint a guardian ad 

litem if the minor is unemancipated. 
 

E.  Time Frames 
The petition must allege abuse in two time frames: 

1.  that abuse occurred within 180 days 

preceding the filing of the FAPA petition 
(i.e., past abuse) and 

2.  that Petitioner is in imminent danger of 
further abuse from Respondent (i.e., 
prospective danger). 

3.  ORS 107.710(6) excludes the following for 
purposes of computing the 180-day period: 

a.  any time during which Respondent is 

incarcerated or 

b.  any time during which Respondent has a 
principal residence more than 100 miles 
from the principal residence of Petitioner. 

F.  Specific Allegations Required 
The petition must specifically allege that 

1.  the petitioner is in imminent danger of abuse 

from the respondent,  

2.  the petitioner has been the victim of abuse 

committed by the respondent within the 180 
days preceding the filing of the petition, and 

3.  the petition must particularly describe the 
nature of the abuse and the dates it 
occurred. 

 

II.  UNCONTESTED, IMMEDIATE 

(EX PARTE) HEARING 

A.  Ex Parte Hearing Required: 

ORS 107.718(1). 

1.  in person or by telephone, 

State ex rel Marshall v. Hargreaves, 302 Or 1, 5 
(1986) (ex parte hearing required when FAPA petition 
filed). 

As the statute specifically authorizes ex parte 
appearances, application without notice to the 
adverse party – even with a parallel domestic 
relations proceeding pending – is allowable. See JR 
2-102(B); ORCP 3.5(b). 

 

- 4 - 

The  court  must  order  the  relief  described  in 
subsections 2 through 7 below if requested by 
Petitioner and if the following showing is met: 

a.  Petitioner with an eligible relationship 

requests it and 

b.  the court finds at the hearing that 

1)  Respondent abused Petitioner within 
the preceding 180 days (see I.E.3. 
(pg. 4) regarding exceptions to this 
requirement), 

2)  Petitioner is in imminent danger of 
further abuse by Respondent, and 
3)  Respondent represents a credible 
threat to the physical safety of 
Petitioner or Petitioner’s child/ren. 

 

- 5 - 

Note: ORS 107.718(1) states that the “circuit court 
shall hold an ex parte hearing in person or by 
telephone” (emphasis added). Most courts require in- 
person appearances at ex parte hearings and allow 
telephone hearings when appropriate. Some judges, 
however, grant or deny orders by reviewing the 
petition and proposed order without in-person or 
telephone contact with Petitioner. This practice may 
be efficient in some situations but has no grounding in 
the statute and deprives the judge of the opportunity 
to observe demeanor and ask questions. 

2.  on the day the petition is filed or the next 

judicial day. 

ORS 107.710(2). 

B.  Standard of Proof is Preponderance of 

the Evidence 
 

C.  Required Showing 

See I.B. (pg. 1) and III.A.1. (pg. 5). 

III.  RELIEF 

   

ORS 107.718(1). 

A.  Mandatory (Not Discretionary) Relief 

At the ex parte hearing, Petitioner is entitled to certain 
relief as long as he/she requests it and makes the 
required showing. At a contested hearing or 
exceptional circumstances hearing, however, the 
court has the authority to cancel or change any order 
issued ex parte. See ORS 107.716(3) and ORS 
107.718(10).

ORS 107.705(5). 

ORS 107.705(7). 

 

 

NOTE: 2005 legislative changes provide a narrow 
exception to the previous mandate that the court 
award custody as requested by Petitioner upon the 
required showing. Now, if the court determines that a 
custody order should not be made at the ex parte 
hearing due to “exceptional circumstances,” a special 
hearing must be scheduled. The purpose of the 
“exceptional circumstances” hearing is to consider 
additional evidence regarding custody and parenting 
time and to provide Respondent with an opportunity 
to contest the restraining order. In the interim, the 
court has the authority to make appropriate orders 
regarding the residence of the child/ren and each 
party’s contact with the child/ren. 

Note: Although ORS 107.755(1)(c) requires that 
mediation be provided in any case in which child 
custody, parenting time, and visitation are in dispute, 
a specific statutory exception applies to FAPA cases. 
"Neither the existence of nor the provisions of a 
restraining order issued under ORS 107.718 may be 
mediated." ORS 107.755(1)(d)(B). Neither mediation 
nor mediation orientation can be encouraged or

2.  Restraint from Abuse 

Restrain Respondent from doing the following 
to Petitioner and any child/ren in Petitioner's 
custody: 

a.  Intimidating, defined as “act[ing] in a 
manner that would reasonably be 
expected to threaten a person in 
Petitioner’s situation, thereby compelling 
or deterring conduct on the part of the 
person.” 

b.  Molesting, defined as “act[ing], with 
hostile intent or injurious effect, in a 
manner that would reasonably be 
expected to annoy, disturb or persecute 
a person in Petitioner’s position.” 

c.  Interfering with, defined as “interpos[ing] 
in a manner that would reasonably be 
expected to hinder or impede a person in 
Petioner’s situation.” 

d.  Menacing, defined as “act[ing] in a 
manner that would reasonably be 
expected to threaten a person in 
Petitioner’s situation.” 

e.  Attempting to intimidate, molest, 

interfere with, or menace. 

Award temporary custody to Petitioner, subject 
to reasonable parenting time unless parenting 
time is not in the best interests of the child/ren; 
or award temporary custody to Respondent, if 
requested by Petitioner, except 

If the court determines that “exceptional 
circumstances” exist that affect the custody of 
the child/ren, the court 

a.  shall order the parties to appear at an 
“exceptional circumstances” hearing to 
determine custody and other contested 
issues and 

b.  may make interim orders regarding the 
child/ren’s residence and the parties’ 
contact with the child/ren that are 
appropriate to provide for the child/ren’s 
welfare and the safety of the parties 
pending the “exceptional circumstances” 
hearing.

provided in proceedings under ORS 107.700 to 
107.732. ORS 107.755(2). See also ORS 36.185. 

ORS 107.718(1)(b). 

ORS 107.716(7). 

ORS 107.718(1)(c). 

A typical order might use a 150-foot limitation. 

ORS 107.718(1)(g), (4). 

A typical order might use a 150-foot “safety zone” 
surrounding listed premises or addresses, such as a 
parking lot that Petitioner uses. 

When Petitioner requests restraint from a place 
where a party’s faith is practiced, drafting the order as 
narrowly as possible, after inquiring into the 
availability and timing of services and any safety 
issues, is desirable. One option might be to reduce 
the “surrounding area” radius solely on such premises 
if both parties practice their faith at the same location 
and the timing of services is problematic. 

A similar adjustment (perhaps 50 feet) might be 
practical for a child’s school events if Respondent can 
safely attend. 

The statute mentions bans on contact that is in 
person, by telephone, or by mail. The SCA restraining 
order to prevent abuse, however, includes options 
that forbid Respondent from having contact with 
Petitioner by e-mail or other electronic transmission, 
by cell phone, or by text message. In addition, 

 

- 7 - 

See also III.D.1. (pg. 12) and 2. (pg. 13). 

4.  Ouster 

Require Respondent to move from Petitioner’s 
residence if 

a.  the residence is solely in Petitioner’s 

name, 

b.  the parties jointly own or rent the 

residence, or 

c.  the parties are married to each other. 

The order may not affect title to any real 
property. 

If the court requires Respondent to move from 
Petitioner’s residence, the order can also 
restrain Respondent from entering or 
attempting to enter a reasonable area 
surrounding Petitioner’s current or subsequent 
residence. 
5.  Restraint From Entry Onto Specified 

Premises 

Restrain Respondent from entering onto any 
premises and a reasonable surrounding area 
when the court considers such restraint 
necessary to prevent abuse. Such a 
surrounding area must be specifically 
described. 

a.  Specified premises may include 

1)  Petitioner’s business or place of 

employment, 

2)  Petitioner’s school, 

3)  a close relative’s home that petitioner 

frequently visits. 

b.  The SCA forms anticipate that when 
children are involved, the following 
premises might be addressed: 
1)  the child/ren’s school, 

2)  the child/ren’s day care provider. 

Specify what contact, if any, Respondent is 
banned from having with Petitioner. The court 
must order, if requested, 

a.  no contact in person, 

ORS107.718(1)(i). 

6.  “No Contact” by Telephone or Mail 

b.  no contact by telephone, and 

c.  no contact by mail. 

Broader bans on contact are discretionary and 
would be authorized under ORS 107.718(1)(h) 
(“other relief the court considers necessary”). 
See III.B.1. (pg. 8). Banning written 
communication not otherwise addressed in the 
form order might be appropriate under this latter 
section. 

7.  Police “Standby” for Essential Personal 

Property 

Order that a peace officer accompany the party 
moving from the residence when that party 
removes essential personal items (or property 
of the child/ren) from the residence. 

a.  Such items include clothing, diapers, 

medications, social security cards, birth 
certificates, tools of the trade, and other 
identification. 

b.  The court’s only other authority to divide 
property between the parties under 

c.  FAPA is the section authorizing “other 

relief that the court considers necessary” 
to provide for the safety and welfare of 
Petitioner or any child/ren in Petitioner’s 
custody. See III.B.1.b. (pg. 9). 

d.  The “standby” time is not required to 

exceed 20 minutes and usually does not 
in most jurisdictions. A police “standby” is 
required to be available on only one 
occasion. 

1.  The court may order any relief it considers 
necessary to provide for the safety and 
welfare of Petitioner and any child/ren in 
Petitioner’s custody. 

options include prohibitions against Respondent 
having in-person and other specified contact with 
Petitioner through third parties. Such expansion of 
prohibited contact is authorized by the “other relief” 
clause at ORS 107.718(1)(h). See 
III.B.1. (pg. 8). 

The SCA restraining order form states that nothing in 
the order prevents Respondent from appearing at or 
participating in a court or administrative hearing as a 
party or witness in a case involving Petitioner. The 
reference to administrative hearings was added to 
address the child support hearings handled by the 
Oregon Child Support Program. Respondent must 
stay a certain distance of feet from Petitioner as 
determined by the order (blank space provided in 
form) and is required to abide by any protective terms 
ordered in the other case.

ORS 107.718(1)(h). 

 

B.  Discretionary Relief 

a.  Expanded “No Contact” Provisions 

As discussed in III.A.6. (pg. 7), a ban on all 
contact or all written contact might be 
appropriate in addition to the prohibition on 
in-person, telephonic, and mailed 
communication that is mandatory upon 
Petitioner’s request. Similarly, no “third 
party” contact by Respondent with Petitioner 
might be appropriate. This would prohibit 
Respondent from communicating with 
Petitioner through Petitioner’s friends, 
family, or co- workers. 

b.  Property Division 

While the statute specifically limits the 
property that a party may remove while a 
police officer stands by to “essential 
personal effects,” more comprehensive 
property division arguably could be ordered 
by the court under the “other relief 
necessary” provision – assuming a nexus 
between such relief and the safety and 
welfare of Petitioner or any child/ren in 
Petitioner’s custody. 
 
c.  Emergency Monetary Assistance  

The statute authorizing “any relief the court 
considers necessary” specifically includes, 
but is not limited to, “emergency monetary 
assistance.” Examples of such assistance 
might include money to change locks or to 
repair damaged doors or windows, to obtain 
an unlisted telephone number, or to move to 
a new residence. Responsibility for certain 
debts might also be addressed. 

 

Due process concerns arguably support an 
effective date for an award of emergency 
monetary assistance that coincides or post-
dates the opportunity for hearing by 
Respondent. For this reason, the SCA 
Restraining Order to Prevent Abuse 
provides for 45 days after service. 

d.  Firearm or Other Weapon Dispossession 

SCA restraining order forms provide options that 
prohibit broader categories of contact by the 
Respondent directly and through third parties. 

Consider property division beyond essential items 
cautiously. If tensions surrounding control (or 
destruction) of personal property are precipitating 
contact or otherwise contributing substantially to 
safety concerns, such a temporary ruling may be 
appropriate. Otherwise, the issue is better left to a 
dissolution case or other court filing. 

n addition, due process concerns limit the extent 
such relief should be ordered on ex parte application, 
and the issue, if appropriate at all, would be more 
properly addressed at a contested hearing. See IV. 
(pg. 19). 

ORS 107.718(1)(h). 

While child support is not excluded by this language, 
an order of ongoing support is problematic, given the 
necessity for and time involved in applying the 
support guidelines, the lack of money award 
summaries or other Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure 
(ORCP)-compliant language in the statutory forms, 
and the temporary nature of FAPA relief, especially 
as it might intersect with the operation of ongoing 
support orders. Better practice may be for limited, 
one-time payments and referral of Petitioners to state- 
provided child support services 
(www.oregonchildsupport.gov) or government cash 
programs such as TA/DVS (Temporary Assistance for 
Domestic Violence Survivors). 

No SCA FAPA form is available to reduce an order of 
emergency monetary assistance to a money 
judgment with a separate money award. Arguably, 
the court has authority under the “other relief” section 
at ORS 107.718(1)(h) to enter an enforceable 
judgment if requested to do so and if provided with 
an appropriate document. Presumably, ORS 18.038, 
regarding the form of judgments, and ORS 18.042, 
regarding money awards to establish judgment liens, 
apply.

domestic violence cases, see “Firearms Prohibitions

18 USC § 922(d)(8), (g)(8). 

2)  Federal law (the Violence Against 

1)  The FAPA statute contains no 

specific reference to weapons. The 
“other relief” provision of ORS 
107.718(1)(h), however, gives the 
court the discretion to restrict 
Respondent’s access to or 
possession of firearms when such 
relief is necessary to protect the 
safety and welfare of Petitioner and 
any child/ren in Petitioner’s custody. 

Violation of such a dispossession 
order would be punishable as 
contempt of court. See VIII. (pg. 32). 

 

Women Act (VAWA)) prohibits certain 
individuals from possessing or 
purchasing firearms or ammunition 
while a protective order is in effect. 
Violation of this statute exposes 
Respondent to federal criminal 
liability. 

i.  The relationships that subject a 

Respondent to the federal law are: 
the person protected by the order is 
a spouse or former spouse of 
Respondent, the parent of 
Respondent’s child/ren, a person 
who does or did cohabit with 
Respondent, or Respondent’s 
child/ren or child/ren of an intimate 
partner of Respondent. 

ii.  The types of orders that subject 

Respondent to federal liability are 
those that meet all of the following 
conditions: 

(A) issued after a hearing about 

which Respondent had actual 
notice and an opportunity to 
participate in the hearing; 

Testimony and legislator comments at the legislative 
committee that considered and approved revisions to 
the statute in 1995 support reliance on the “other 
relief” section as authority for restrictions regarding 
Respondent’s access to firearms and ammunition. 

Current FAPA forms promulgated by the SCA allow 
Petitioners to request specific orders relating to 
dispossession of firearms and ammunition. See 
Restraining Order to Prevent Abuse. 

 

 

18 USC § 921(a)(33); 18 USC § 922(d)(8), (g)(8). 

Oregon’s FAPA orders protect more classes of 
Petitioners than those protected under the federal 
dispossession law. People who are sexually intimate 
who have not cohabited, for example, qualify for 
FAPA relief, but Respondents are not subject to the 
federal gun ban. 

For a more detailed analysis of the elements of 18 
USC § 922(g)(8), see Oregon Bench Sheet - 
Qualifying Order of Protection/Restraint. 

18 USC § 922(g)(8)(A). 

Oregon’s ex parte FAPA orders probably do not 
qualify under the federal statute. Only those orders 
issued after a hearing of which Respondent received 
notice and had participatory rights (e.g., a 5- or 21- 
day contest in Oregon) come under the federal gun 
law. 

18 USC § 922(g)(8)(B), (C)(i). 

The FAPA statute requires, and the SCA forms 
contain, the “credible threat” finding. The federal 
statute allows an alternative basis to this finding (an 

- 10 - 

explicit prohibition regarding physical force), but 
Oregon did not codify this language, found at 18 USC 
§ 922(g)(8)(C)(ii). It is, however, included in the 
federal firearms findings (Brady) in the SCA Order 
After Hearing. 

Federal firearms findings are included on page 2 of 
the Order After Hearing that is used for 5- and 21- 
day, exceptional circumstances, modification, and 
renewal hearings. 

ORS 166.291(1)(m); ORS 166.293(3)(a) 

In 2011, the legislature amended FAPA to allow for 
the protection of pets, including service or therapy 
animals. ORS 107.718(1)(h)(B). 

Orders concerning pets should be set out in the 
“Other Orders” section on page 5 of the 
Restraining Order to Prevent Abuse. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

- 11 - 

(B) restrain Respondent from 
harassing, stalking, or 
threatening Petitioner or 
Petitioner or Respondent’s 
child/ren or engaging in other 
conduct that places Petitioner 
in fear of bodily injury to 
Petitioner or Petitioner or 
Respondent’s child/ren; and 

(C) include a finding that 

Respondent represents a 
credible threat to the physical 
safety of Petitioner or 
Petitioner’s or Respondent’s 
child/ren. 

iii.  If the order meets all of the above 
requirements, judges should 
complete the Federal Firearms 
Findings (Brady) in the Order After 
Hearing. Court staff then should 
enter this information in OJIN. 

3)  Revocation and Denial of Concealed 

Weapon Permits 

Concealed weapon permits are issued 
and revoked by county sheriffs. Some 
sheriffs’ offices have a process in place to 
revoke a permit when a restraining order 
is issued. Issuance of a restraining order 
against a permit holder is a ground for 
denial of an application for a permit, as 
well as revocation of an already-issued 
permit. 
 

2.  Protection of Pets 

The court may order other relief it considers 
necessary to prevent the neglect and protect 
the safety of any service or therapy animal or 
any animal kept for personal protection or 
companionship. However, the court cannot 
make orders regarding animals kept for 
business, commercial, agricultural, or 
economic purposes. 

ORS 107.718(1)(a), (2). 

1.  Temporary Custody 

See ORS 107.716(6). 

18 USC § 2265. 

 

 

The subject-matter jurisdiction requirements of the 
Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement 
Act (UCCJEA) apply. Even if Oregon is not the home 
state or does not have modification jurisdiction, it very 
probably can exercise temporary emergency 
jurisdiction because of the child/ren’s presence here 
and the need to prevent abuse to Petitioner. ORS 
109.751. Communication with a judge in another 
state may be required. 

After considering Petitioner’s safety needs, a FAPA 
order may be drafted narrowly to permit Respondent 
to be at restricted locations at specified times solely to 
exercise parenting time rights. 

Reminder: Despite the requirement of ORS 
107.755(1)(c) that mediation be provided in any case 
in which child custody, parenting time, and visitation 
are in dispute, neither mediation nor mediation 
orientation can be encouraged or provided in 
proceedings under ORS 107.700 to 107.732. See 
ORS 107.755(1)(d)(B) and (2). 

C.  Mutual Restraining Orders Only if 

Parties Separately Petition 

In 1995, state legislation prohibited "mutual" 
restraining orders, except when each party files a 
petition and independently meets the statutory 
criteria. This requirement is consistent with 
federal VAWA law compelling full faith and credit 
only in such circumstance. 
 
D.  Custody Issues (See also IV.A.12.b. 

(pg. 24) and c. (pg. 25)) 

a.  The court must make a temporary  

custody award, except as discussed in 
paragraph 2, below, at the ex parte 
hearing if 

 

1)  Petitioner has met the statutory 

criteria and 

2)  Petitioner requests it. 

b.  The court may grant custody to Petitioner 
or Respondent, whichever Petitioner 
requests. 

c.  The child/ren subject to the custody 

award must be the child/ren of both of the 
parties. 
 

d.  The “immediate danger” temporary 

custody and mediation procedures in pre- 
and post-judgment dissolution of 
marriage proceedings do not apply to 
FAPA cases. 

 

- 12 - 

ORS 107.716(2); ORS 107.718(2). 

See discussion of exceptional circumstances 
language at III.A.2. (pg. 6). 

When an exceptional circumstances hearing is 
scheduled, Respondent is not entitled to request a 
contested hearing pursuant to ORS 107.718(10); i.e., 
an additional hearing. If Respondent contests the 
issuance or other provisions of the restraining order, 
Respondent must raise these at the “exceptional 
circumstances” hearing. See ORS 107.716(2)(b) and 
IV.A.1. (pg. 20). 

EXAMPLES of “Exceptional Circumstances” may 
include the following: 

1.  The petition reflects that the 4-year-old child of the 
parties has never resided with Petitioner. In response 
to the court’s inquiries, Petitioner acknowledges 
seeing the child only rarely and for short periods of 
time. 

2.  The petition shows that the parties’ two school-age 
children have lived with Respondent in an Oregon 
community that is 125 miles from the home of 
Petitioner since the beginning of the school year. 
School will be out in 6 weeks. 

3.  The petition alleges that the parties’ child is six 
weeks old. Upon being questioned by the court, 
Petitioner states that Respondent is breast-feeding 
the baby. 

4.  Petitioner appears to be impaired by drugs at the 
ex parte hearing and acknowledges a problem with 
substance abuse. The children have lived with 
Respondent for the last 6 months. 

ORS 107.722(1). 

ORS 107.722(2). 

ORS 107.722(2)(a) permits modification only if 
necessary to protect the safety and welfare of the 
child/ren or Petitioner. 

2.  Exceptional Circumstances Affecting the 

Custody of a Child 

The court must make a temporary custody order 
at the ex parte hearing unless the court 
determines that exceptional circumstances exist 
that affect the custody of the child/ren. 

a.  If exceptional circumstances exist, the 
court must order the parties to appear 
and provide additional evidence 
regarding temporary custody and to 
resolve other contested issues. 

b.  Pending the hearing, the court may make 

any orders regarding the child/ren’s 
residence and the parties’ contact with 
the child/ren that are appropriate to 
provide for the child/ren’s welfare and the 
safety of the parties. 

c.  The court must schedule the hearing 
within 14 days of issuance of the 
restraining order and issue a notice of the 
hearing at the same time the restraining 
order is issued. 

3.  Effect of Subsequent Domestic Relations 

Judgments and Orders on Preexisting FAPA 
Orders (See V. (pg. 29)) 

4.  Modification of Preexisting Domestic 
Relations Orders or Judgments 

a.  The FAPA court may modify the custody 

or parenting time provisions of a 
preexisting order or judgment under ORS 
107.095(1)(b), 107.105, 107.135, or 
109.155, or similar order or judgment 
from another jurisdiction, if necessary to 
protect the safety and welfare of the 
child/ren. 

 

- 13 - 

ORS 107.722(2)(b). 

 

 

 

 

ORS 107.722(2)(c) makes clear that the UCCJEA 
applies if the court is modifying an order or judgment 
from another jurisdiction. 

ORS 109.751(4). 

In order to be compliant with the UCCJEA, a court of 
this state must communicate with a court of another 
state with custody jurisdiction upon being notified that 
the court has made a custody determination. 

ORS 109.094. 

A male’s rights as a legal father are contingent upon 
the establishment of his paternity. 

If paternity is not established, but both parties are 
willing to stipulate to that finding in the FAPA case, 
statutory filiation procedures must still be met, 
including a verified writing. ORS 109.155(1). Given 
the temporary effectiveness of a FAPA “order,” 
paternity establishment independent of the FAPA 
filing is desirable. Paternity can be resolved by 
voluntary acknowledgment (i.e., voluntary 
acknowledgement of paternity form referred to in 
ORS 109.070(1)(e)) or referring the parties to the 
state child support program. 

ORS 107.718(1)(a). 

A Safety-Focused Parenting Plan Guide is available 
on the Oregon Judicial Department website. 

 

- 14 - 

b.  If the court modifies the custody 

provisions of a preexisting order or 
judgment, the FAPA order must specify a 
period of time the court considers 
adequate under the circumstances during 
which Petitioner may obtain a 
modification of the preexisting order or 
judgment. Upon expiration of that period 
of time, if no modification has been 
obtained, the custody provisions of the 
FAPA order expire, and the provisions of 
the preexisting order or judgment become 
effective immediately. 

c.  If the court modifies only parenting time 
provisions of a preexisting order, the 
statute does not require that Petitioner 
seek modification of the preexisting 
parenting time order or judgment. 

d.  If the court modifies a preexisting order or 
judgment of another jurisdiction, ORS 
109.701 to 109.834 (the UCCJEA) apply. 

5.  Paternity 

a.  If paternity has not been established, the 
court has no authority to order custody or 
parenting time to the putative father. 

b.  The court may note on the restraining 
order that the reason no custody or 
parenting time order is being entered is 
because paternity has not been 
established. 

6.  Parenting Time (See also IV.A.12.b. (pg. 24) 

and c. (pg. 25)) 

a.  Once a custody award is made, the court 

must set a parenting time schedule 
unless the court finds that parenting time 
is not in the best interests of the 
child/ren. 

1)  The fact that domestic violence has 
occurred in the family may go to the 
issue of the best interests of the 
child/ren. 

2)  The court is not limited to a 

"traditional" parenting time schedule. 

b.  If the court awards parenting time to a 
parent who committed abuse, the court 
must include adequate provisions in its 
order to protect and provide for the 
safety of Petitioner and the child/ren. 

The protections under ORS 107.718(6) 
include, but are not limited to, requiring 
one or more of the following: 

1) exchange of child/ren taking place at a 

protected location; 

2) parenting time being supervised; 

3) perpetrator of the abuse attending and 
completing a program of intervention 
for perpetrators of domestic violence 
or other counseling program 
designated by the court; 

4) perpetrator of abuse not possessing or 

consuming alcohol or controlled 
substances during parenting time and 
for 24 hours before; 

5) the perpetrator of abuse paying the 

costs of supervision of parenting time 
and any other program designated by 
the court as a condition of parenting 
time; and 

6) no overnight parenting time occurring. 

See ORS 107.137(1)(d) and (2). 

ORS 107.718(6). 

The Restraining Order to Prevent Abuse at paragraph 
16 contains several options for addressing the issue 
of parenting time. 

After considering Petitioner’s safety needs, a FAPA 
order may be drafted narrowly to permit Respondent 
to be at restricted locations at specified times solely to 
exercise parenting time rights. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ORS 107.732(1). Specific addresses identified by 
Petitioner where the child/ren might be found provide 
the particularity that supports the reasonableness of 
the seizure. Waters vs. Williams, Huston, Treat, and

Court Opinion dated May 18, 1999) (unreported) 
(discussion of 4th Amendment issues in context of 
execution of writ of assistance in family law matter). 

7.  Recovery of Child/ren 

On request of a party awarded custody, the 
court must include a provision ordering a peace 
officer to assist that parent in obtaining physical 
custody of the child/ren of the parties. 

ORS 109.701 - 109.990.

b.  When the child/ren may not be subject to 

Oregon court jurisdiction under the 
UCCJEA, the temporary emergency 
provisions may apply. This requirement 
may implicate a mandatory 
communication with a judge in another 
state. 
 

E.  Other Provisions 

1.  Security Amount 

The order must specify the amount of security 
to be posted after arrest for violation of the 
restraining order. The SCA form specifies a 
$5,000 amount, but the court may impose a 
higher or lower sum. The order cannot be 
entered into the Law Enforcement Data 
System (LEDS) without a security amount. 

The order must provide that the court grant the 
relief until the sooner of 

a.  one year or 

b.  the date the order is withdrawn, 

amended, or superseded under ORS 
107.722. 

A hearing request form must be served on 
Respondent with the order. The SCA form 
includes a notice of rights and procedures for 
this purpose. (See IV. (pg. 19)). 

The clerk must provide Petitioner, at no cost, 
the number of certified copies of the petition and 
order necessary to effect service on 
Respondent. If Petitioner requests an 
exemplified copy (usually for registration in 
another state), up to two such copies must be 
provided without charge. 

Service of process or other legal documents on 
Petitioner is not a violation of a FAPA order if 
service is accomplished as provided in ORCP 7 
or 9.

No filing fee, service fee, or hearing fee can be 
charged if the only relief ordered is that 
authorized by ORS 107.700 to 107.735. 

 

F.  Termination 

The court may terminate a restraining order at 
any time, but only by written order. 

FAPA provides no specific standard or 
guidance for terminating restraining orders, 
and court practices vary considerably. 

 

ORS 107.718(8)(c). 

It is common practice to refer to dismissing rather 
than terminating a restraining order. This terminology 
probably arises from the statutory reference in ORS 
107.720(2)(b) to Petitioner’s motion to dismiss. 

The variation in judicial practice is the result of 
attempts to balance safety concerns with respect for 
victim-litigant autonomy. Termination of an order may 
enhance a party’s safety in some circumstances. 
Practices to consider in this scenario – among the 
most challenging decisions in FAPA cases – include 
the following: 

  maximum privacy for the discussion, to the extent 

recording and open-court procedures allow; 
exploration of intimidation and coercion issues; 

    offering the opportunity to speak with a victim 

advocate; 

  encouragement of safety planning and referrals to 

community resources; 

  notice of alternatives to termination that might 
more effectively address a Petitioner’s safety 
needs, such as simply liberalizing existing 
restrictions; and 

  encouragement to return if Petitioner’s safety 

needs change. 

ORS 107.720(2)(b). 

 

ORS 107.725. 

Renewal petitions should be filed before the existing 
order expires. The statute refers to a “renewal” 
procedure rather than a “revival.”

2.  Notarized Signature Required 

If Petitioner moves for dismissal of the 
restraining order, the request must include 
Petitioner's notarized signature. 
 

G.  Renewals 

1.  Renew an Order by Petitioner 

The court may renew an order if the court finds 
that a person in Petitioner’s situation would 
reasonably fear further acts of abuse by 
Respondent. The court may renew the order on 
the basis of a sworn ex parte petition. 

a.  Further Abuse Not Required 

No further acts of abuse are required for 
the restraining order to be renewed.

As a result of 2011 legislation, the now-18-year-old 
need not show abuse within 180 days or that he or 
she is in imminent danger of further abuse, only that 
he or she reasonably fears further acts of abuse if the 
order is not renewed.

Involving Former Protected Child. 

ORS 107.725(4). 

3.  Hearing 

 

 

 

b.  Not Limited in Number 

The statute does not limit the number of 
times a restraining order can be renewed. 
 

2.  Renew an Order by Formerly Protected 

Child, Now 18 

A former minor child who was in the custody of 
the original Petitioner, who was protected under 
the restraining order and who is now 18 years 
old, may ask the court to renew the provisions 
of the restraining order protecting him or her for 
another year. 

a.  The court can issue the order regardless 
of whether the original Petitioner agrees 
to or seeks renewal of the order. 

b.  If the original Petitioner does not agree to 

or ask for renewal of the order 
concurrently with the request of the now- 
18-year-old, the court may exclude 
Petitioner as a protected person in the 
renewed order. 

c.  The now-18-year-old person is not 

required to file a petition under ORS 
107.710. 

a.  ORS 107.716(5) and 107.718(8) to (10) 
apply when a renewal order is granted, 
(See IV.A. (pg. 20)) (Respondent may 
request a hearing within 30 days of being 
served with a renewal order), except that 
the court may hear no issue other than 
the basis for renewal unless requested in 
the hearing form and agreed to by 
Petitioner. 

b.  The court shall hold a hearing within 21 

days of Respondent’s request. 
 
H.  Amendments 
It is not clear if amendments (other than for 
clerical mistakes) are allowed before service or 
the response time has expired. ORS 107.730 
addresses only the court’s modification authority 
after the response time has lapsed. Adding an 
attorney fee claim before this deadline seems to 
be well-grounded, however, since it does not 
affect the ex parte order already issued. Also, 
courts that allow changes to the order prior to 
service or during the response period usually limit 

See IV.B. (pg. 27) for discussion of modification of 
FAPA orders. 

 

- 18 - 

them to less restrictive terms or situations of 
changed circumstance requiring additional 
protections. These courts provide Respondent 
with an opportunity to be heard if the ex parte 
order already has been served. 

  

•  The court may set an “exceptional 

circumstances” hearing to determine 
temporary custody and resolve other contested 
issues when there are exceptional 
circumstances affecting child custody. 

•  Respondent may request a hearing within 30 
days of being served the order to object to the 
order or to its provisions. 

•  Petitioner or Respondent may request a 

hearing on an existing order after the 30 day 
response time has lapsed to modify child 
custody and/or parenting time, restrictions from 
certain locations (including ouster from the 
residence), or restrictions on contact with 
Petitioner. 

•  Thirty days after the restraining order is served 
on Respondent, Respondent no longer can 
request a hearing to object to the order itself. 
After that time period has passed, however, 
Respondent or Petitioner can ask the court to 
modify the order’s terms regarding child 
custody and/or parenting time, restrictions from 
certain locations (including ouster from the 
residence), or restrictions on contact with 
Petitioner for good cause shown. The other 
party may contest this request at a show cause 
hearing. 

 

 

ORS 107.716(2); ORS 107.718(2). 

IV.  THE CONTESTED HEARING 

PROCESS 

Six types of contested hearings may be held after the 
court issues a FAPA restraining order: 

ORS 107.716(1); ORS 107.718(10)(a). 

ORS 107.730(1)(a). 

Depending on local practice, courts either set a show 
cause hearing or require a written response from the 
opposing party before a hearing is set. The SCA 
forms allow for either practice. 

 

- 19 - 

ORS 107.730(1)(b). There is no explicit authority 
giving Respondent the right to a hearing on 
Petitioner’s ex parte motion to make the order less 
restrictive. ORS 107.730(2) indicates that a notice of 
hearing must be included in service of modifications, 
and this section does not distinguish between ex 
parte modification and modification for good cause 
shown. If Respondent objects to the motion to make 
the order less restrictive, due process and fairness 
principles argue in favor of granting a hearing. 

Since Petitioner’s motion should benefit Respondent, 
objection is unlikely.  

 
The SCA Notice to Respondent/Request for Hearing - 
Less Restrictive Order is served on Respondent along 
with Petitioner’s Ex Parte’s Motion for Less Restrictive 
Terms & Declaration in Support. 

 

ORS 107.716(2)(a); ORS 107.718(2). 
See III.A.3. (pg. 6). 

An exceptional circumstances hearing should only be 
set if the court does not award custody as requested 
by Petitioner. 

ORS 107.716(1). 

Respondents contesting custody provisions in FAPA 
orders are entitled to a hearing within five days of 
their request, even if there is a later scheduled 
exceptional circumstances hearing. Some courts are 
avoiding the work of rescheduling by setting all 
exceptional circumstance hearings within five days of 
issuing the order. 

ORS 107.716(2)(c). 

 

- 20 - 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  Respondent may request a hearing objecting 

to Petitioner’s ex parte motion to remove terms 
in the order or make the order less restrictive. 

•  Respondent may request a hearing to 

challenge the basis for renewing an order. See 
III.G. (pg. 17). 

 
A.  Hearings on Ex Parte Orders 

1.  Exceptional Circumstances Hearings 

a.  If there are exceptional circumstances 

that affect child custody, the court must 
hold a hearing to determine temporary 
custody. The hearing must occur within 
14 days after issuance of the FAPA 
order. The court must set the exceptional 
circumstances hearing when it issues the 
restraining order and must 
contemporaneously issue a notice of 
hearing to the parties. 

b.  Even when an exceptional circumstances 
hearing is set, Respondent may request 
a hearing contesting custody, and that 
hearing must be held within five days of 
the request. 

c.  When the court schedules an exceptional 
circumstances hearing, Respondent may 
not request an additional or separate 
hearing to contest the restraining order. 
Respondent’s objections to the 
restraining order must be heard as part of 
the exceptional circumstances hearing. 

2.  Respondent’s Hearing Request 

Respondent must ask for a hearing within 
30 days after being served unless an 
“exceptional circumstances” hearing is 
scheduled. Even if an exceptional 
circumstances hearing is scheduled, 
Respondent may ask for an earlier hearing.  

If Respondent fails to request a hearing 
within 30 days after being served, the 
restraining order is confirmed by operation 
of law. 

 
b.  Forms 

The SCA provides FAPA forms, including 
hearing request forms and an explanatory 
brochure about FAPA relief. The clerk of 
the court shall make these forms 
available. 

3.  Scheduling the Hearing Requested by 

 

Respondent 

Timing 

a.  If custody is contested, the court must set 

a hearing within five days after 
Respondent’s hearing request. 

b.  If custody is not contested, the court must 

set a hearing within 21 days after 
Respondent’s request. 

c.  A hearing held outside the statutory time 
frame is not error when Respondent 
causes or contributes to the delay. 

4.  Continuances 

a.  If service of the notice of hearing is 

inadequate to provide a party with enough 
notice of either an exceptional 
circumstances hearing or a hearing on 
Respondent’s objections, the court may 
continue the hearing for up to 5 days to 
permit the party to seek representation. 

ORS 107.718(11). 

ORS 107.718(7). 

These forms are available on the Oregon Judicial 
Department Family Abuse Prevention Act webpage. 

ORS 107.716(1). 

For purposes of calculating when a hearing must be 
held, see ORS 174.120 (computation of time), not 
ORCP 10. Unlike ORCP 10, ORS 174.120 excludes 
the weekend days only if a weekend day is the last 
day of the period. 

See Strother and Strother, 130 Or App 624, 630 
(1994), rev den, 320 Or 508 (1995) (denying relief to 
Respondent who alleged that the trial court erred by 
holding hearing on the 33rd day, when Respondent 
had disqualified a judge, reducing by one-half the 
number of judges available to conduct the hearing, 
and Respondent's lawyer was not available on 10 of 
21 possible hearing dates). 

ORS 107.716(4)(a). 

If a party does not appear at a scheduled hearing, the 
court should review the file to ensure that the hearing 
notice went to the correct address and gave the party 
sufficient notice of hearing. 

The court may also exercise its discretion to allow a 
continuance to give a party time to arrange for 
witnesses to appear.

b.  If one party is represented by an attorney 
at an exceptional circumstances hearing 
or a hearing on Respondent’s objections, 
the court may continue the hearing for up 
to five days to enable the unrepresented 
party to seek representation. 

c.  If Respondent raises an issue at the 

hearing that was not raised in the hearing 
request form, or if Petitioner seeks relief 
at that hearing that was not granted in the 
original order, the other party shall be 
entitled to a reasonable continuance to 
prepare a response to the issue. 

5.  The Hearing Notice 

a.  Court Clerk’s Duties 

1) The clerk must notify Petitioner of the 
date and time of the hearing, and 

2) the clerk must provide Petitioner with a 

copy of Respondent’s request for 
hearing. 

b.  Petitioner’s Responsibilities 

Petitioner  must  give  the  clerk  information 
to  allow  the  clerk  to  give  notice  of  the 
hearing.  A  physical  address 
is  not 
required. 
Some Petitioners participate in Oregon’s 
address confidentiality program or use 
contact addresses, such as a local 
domestic violence services program, a 
friend or relative’s home, or a post office 
box. Petitioners are responsible to ensure 
that they will receive notices delivered to 
the contact address. 

The court may approve a consent agreement 
that will stop the abuse, with a few exceptions. 

a.  The settlement may not restrain a party 
unless that party petitioned for and was 
granted an order under ORS 107.710. 
Thus, mutual restraining orders can only 
be part of the settlement if each party 
petitioned for and was granted an order 
under ORS 107.710. 

For more information on Oregon’s address 
confidentiality program, see the Oregon Department 
of Justice Address Confidentiality Program webpage.

ORS 36.185; ORS 107.755(2). 
See III.A.2. (pg. 6). 

 

ORCP 1A. 

FAPA was meant to provide a speedy and 
straightforward remedy to domestic violence. 
Discovery may be inconsistent with the statutory 
purpose and result in protracted proceedings. Also, 
Respondents may use discovery to continue to 
harass or deter victims or to obtain information not 
otherwise discoverable in a pending criminal case 
stemming from the same acts of domestic violence. 

 

 

b.  The settlement may not in any manner 

affect title to real property. 

7.  Mediation Prohibited 

The court may not order mediation in a FAPA 
proceeding. 

8.  Discovery 

a.  Applicability to FAPA: The ORCP applies 
to special proceedings such as FAPA 
cases “except where a different 
procedure is specified by statute or rule.” 
Given the conflicts between the 
timeframes set out in FAPA and many of 
the timeframes in the discovery rules, 
discovery in FAPA cases rarely is 
feasible. If a FAPA hearing is delayed for 
some legitimate reason and discovery 
can be fairly conducted before the next 
scheduled hearing date, it may be 
reasonable to permit discovery after 
considering the basis for Respondent’s 
request and issues of safety. 

In the unusual case where discovery is appropriate, 
limiting Respondent to telephonic participation in a 
deposition may be advisable. 

Victims in criminal cases have a constitutional and a 
statutory right to refuse to submit to a deposition or 
other discovery requests by a criminal Defendant or 
any person acting on behalf of that Defendant. In a 
FAPA proceeding when a parallel criminal case is 
pending, this right arguably precludes the criminal 
Defendant/Respondent from deposing the 
victim/petitioner. Article 1, section 42, of the Oregon 
Constitution provides, in part, that a victim has “[t]he 
right to refuse an interview, deposition or other 
discovery request by the criminal defendant or other 
person acting on behalf of the criminal [defendant.]” 
See also ORS 135.970(3). 

b.  Protection Orders: To the extent 
discovery can be appropriately 
accommodated in terms of FAPA- 
mandated timeframes, courts may 
consider crafting protection orders to 
address safety issues, harassment of 
victims by alleged perpetrators, and 
possible restraining order violations (e.g., 
presence of Respondent at a deposition). 

ORS 107.716(3); ORS 107.718(10)(c). 

9.  Scope of the Hearing 

The court may cancel or change any order 
issued under ORS 107.718. The court may 
assess reasonable attorney fees and costs 
incurred in the proceeding against either 
party.

to FAPA must be allowed a reasonably complete 
presentation of evidence, including cross-examination 
of witnesses). 

ORS 45.400; ORS 107.717. 

b.  Telephone Testimony 

The hearing is not limited to issues raised in 
Respondent’s request for hearing. Nor is 
Petitioner limited to the relief granted ex 
parte; different relief can be sought. The 
court must grant a reasonable continuance 
in either of these circumstances. 

10. The Contested Hearing 

a.  Hearing Procedures 

FAPA statutes do not specify what takes 
place at the “contested hearing.” 

Appellate decisions have held that the 
FAPA hearing should be similar to a trial, 
with both parties being allowed to testify, 
present evidence, and examine 
witnesses under oath. 

1) Ex parte hearing: A motion or good 

cause determination are not required 
to hold the ex parte hearing by phone. 

 

2) Contested Hearing:  A party may file a 
motion asking to testify by phone or to 
have a witness testify by phone. The 
court should consider the expedited 
nature of the FAPA process in 
determining whether to allow a motion 
for telephone testimony with less than 
30 days notice. In addition to the 
factors in ORS 45.400(3)(b), the court 
should consider the safety and the 
welfare of the party or witness in 
determining whether good cause for 
telephone testimony exists. 

11. Evidentiary Issues 

a.  If Petitioner fails to appear at the hearing 
and the court terminates the ex parte 
restraining order, Petitioner may file a 
second petition alleging the same 
occurrences, if the termination was not 
based on the merits. 

b.  Evidence: The Oregon Evidence Code 
applies to hearings held under ORS 
107.716. 

See Obrist v. Harmon, 150 Or App 173 (1997) 
(dismissal of a FAPA due to Petitioner’s failure to 
appear at the contested hearing is not a decision on 
the merits or a final judgment for purposes of issue 
preclusion or claim preclusion).

c.  Burden of Proof: Petitioner has the 
burden of proving a claim by a 
preponderance of the evidence. 

d.  Showing Required: 

1) “Abuse,” as defined in ORS 

107.705(1), 

i.  within the preceding 180 days 

ii.  between “family or household 
members,” as defined in ORS 
107.705(4); 

2) “Imminent danger of further abuse”; 

3) Respondent represents a credible 
threat to the physical safety of 
Petitioner or Petitioner’s child/ren. 

e.  Prior Abuse History 

Evidence of abuse that occurred prior to the 
180-day limit cannot justify the issuance of 
the order, but it may be relevant to explain 
the existence or degree of current fear. 

The court may cancel or change any order 
issued ex parte. Even if not granted ex parte, 
relief that is authorized under ORS 107.718 
may be ordered by the court at a contested 
hearing. At a contested hearing, the court 
may do any of the following: 

a.  Terminate the Restraining Order 

Terminate the restraining order if the court 
finds from the evidence presented that 
Petitioner has not proven a claim for relief 
under the statute. 

b.  Award or Modify Temporary Custody 

At the hearing, Respondent may contest the 
temporary custody award. The statutes do 
not specify a basis for awarding temporary 
custody at this hearing; courts generally 
follow the "best interests of the child" 
standard as in other custody matters. 

ORS 107.716(3); ORS 107.718(10)(c). 

12. Available Relief 

c.  Award or Modify Parenting Time 

Respondent may request parenting time 
different from that provided for in the 
restraining order or request an order for 
parenting time if the court found earlier that 
parenting time was not in the best interests 
of a child. 

d.  Require Respondent to Move Out 

The court may require Respondent to move 
out of Petitioner’s residence if the residence 
is solely in Petitioner’s name or jointly 
owned or rented by Petitioner and 
Respondent or if Petitioner and Respondent 
are married. 

e.  Assess Attorney Fees and Costs 

The court may assess against either party 
reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred 
in an exceptional circumstances hearing or 
a contested hearing within 30 days after 
service of the order or a hearing for 
modification of an existing order. 

ORS 107.716(1) - (3); ORS 107.718(1)(a). 

ORS 107.718(1)(b). 

The court may remove the ouster provision if 
Petitioner moves. 

The court may want to consider the application of 
ORS chapter 90 in determining whether the residence 
is jointly “rented” by Petitioner and Respondent. 

ORS 107.716(3). 
ORCP 68 rules regarding the pleading, proof, and 
recovery of attorney fees do NOT apply in FAPA 
cases, because FAPA relief is “granted by order 
rather than entered as part of a judgment.” ORCP 
68C(1)(b). Even though ORCP 68 does not apply, 
ORS 20.075 mandates a set of factors that the judge 
must consider whenever a request for attorney fees is 
authorized by statute. 
 

The statute only authorizes recovery of attorney fees 
and costs incurred for an exceptional circumstances 
hearing or the contested hearing within 30 days after 
service of the order. There is no statutory authority to 
assess attorney fees and court costs for a renewal 
hearing. 

 

FAPA forms do not contain provisions requesting 
attorney fees, so frequently no notice is provided to 
the other party that, in the event of a contested 
hearing, attorney fees may be awarded.  Best 
practice and statutory construction would appear to 
require that, at a minimum, a party requesting fees 
do so prior to the close of the hearing on the merits. 

This position allows for two results if attorney fees are 
requested: (1) a set-over under ORS 107.718(10)(c) 
for an issue raised at hearing but not granted ex parte 
or mentioned in Respondent’s hearing request form, 
or (2) a directive from the judge that ORCP 68 
procedures will be followed regarding submission of 
fee statements and objections. Each choice allows a 
method for eliciting fee-relevant facts not tried at the 
hearing on the merits. The second choice is 
preferable from the standpoint of judicial efficiency, 
but the set-over is required if a party elects a 
postponement to address an issue not raised by the 
pleadings. See IV.A.12 (pg. 25).

f.  Allow Waiver of Later Personal Service 

If requested, the court must allow a party to 
waive personal service in any subsequent 
contempt proceeding to maintain the 
confidentiality of the party’s address. 

g. Order Emergency Monetary Assistance 

Although Petitioner’s need may not be as 
urgent, both the evidentiary and due process 
bases for ordering financial awards would be 
stronger at the contested hearing stage. See 
III.B.1.c. (pg. 9) 

h. Other Available Remedies 

Any relief available under ORS 107.700 to 
107.732 is in addition to any other available 
civil or criminal remedy. 

B.  Modifying the Order 

1.  Ex Parte Modification for Less Restrictive 

 

Terms 

After Respondent’s 30-day period to request a 
hearing has lapsed, Petitioner may ask the court 
to remove or make less restrictive provisions 
concerning ouster, restraint from certain 
specified areas, or provisions regarding 
prohibited contact with Petitioner. Petitioner may 
do this by ex parte motion. Petitioner must show 
good cause for the request. 

a.  Service of Order 

1) The court clerk must provide, without 

charge, the number of certified copies of 
the modified order and notice of hearing 
necessary to effect service. 

2) The sheriff must serve Respondent with 
the less restrictive order and notice to 
respondent/request for hearing by first 
class mail. 

3) If the order recites that Respondent 

appeared in person before the court, the 
order need not be served. 

b.  Respondent may request a hearing on the 
less restrictive order. See IV. (pg. 19). 

- 27 - 

2.  Show Cause Modification 

Once 30 days from service have passed, 
either Petitioner or Respondent can ask to 
change the order’s terms regarding custody, 
parenting time, restriction from certain 
locations (including ouster from the 
residence), or provisions regarding contact. 
The party requesting the modification must 
show good cause to modify the order. 

Respondent cannot object to the order 
itself after the 30-day period has lapsed. 
Only modifications specifically 
authorized under ORS 107.730(1)(a) are 
allowed. 

b.  Service of Request 

1) The court clerk must provide, without 

charge, the number of certified copies of 
the request for modification and notice of 
hearing necessary to effect service. 

2) If requested by the party, the clerk must 
deliver the modification request and 
notice of hearing to the sheriff for service. 

3) The sheriff must personally serve the 
request for modification and notice of 
hearing unless the party elects to have 
service accomplished by a private party. 

3.  Hearings 

The statute allows ex parte relief only when 
Petitioner wants less restrictive terms in the 
FAPA order. For all other modifications, the 
opposing party must be served a copy of the 
request for modification. The court must either 
set a show cause hearing or give the opposing 
party the opportunity to file a response and 
request a hearing. 

The court may assess against either party 
reasonable attorney fees and costs that may 
be incurred in the proceeding. 

 

ORS 107.730(1)(a). 

Within 30 days of service, Respondent may ask for a 
hearing on the order itself and/or custody and 
parenting time provisions in the order. See IV.A.2. 
(pg. 21). 

ORS 107.718(10)(a). 

a.  Limited Relief 

Depending on local practice, courts either set a show 
cause hearing or require a written response from the 
opposing party before a hearing is set. The SCA 
forms allow for either practice. 

ORS 107.730(7). See also IV.A.12.b. (pg. 25).

V.  EFFECT OF FAPA ORDERS ON 

DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE 
PROCEEDINGS 

See III.D.4. (pg. 13) regarding Modification in FAPA 
Cases of Preexisting Order or Judgments (Domestic 
relations order or judgment first, then FAPA). 

 

A.  FAPA Order Followed by Final 
Domestic Relations Judgment 

Provisions of an original or modified judgment of 
dissolution of marriage under ORS 107.105 or 
107.135, custody or parenting time order under 
ORS 109.103, or filiation judgment under ORS 
109.155 supersede contrary provisions in a pre- 
existing FAPA custody or parenting time order. 
Final domestic relations judgments from other 
states filed under ORS 24.105 et seq. also will 
supersede conflicting terms in an earlier Oregon 
FAPA order. 
 
B.  FAPA Order Followed by Temporary 

Domestic Relations Order 

A temporary custody or parenting time order 
made pursuant to ORS 107.095(1)(b) in a 
subsequent dissolution, annulment, separation, or 
unmarried parent’s proceeding supersedes a 
contrary provision of a preexisting FAPA order 
only if the party requesting temporary relief in the 
dissolution action 

1.  consolidates the subsequently filed 

dissolution action with the preexisting FAPA 
proceeding and 

2.  provides the nonmoving party notice of the 
requested temporary order under ORS 
107.095(1)(b) and an opportunity for a 
hearing in the domestic relations case. 
 

VI.  FOREIGN RESTRAINING ORDERS 

A.  Entitled to Full Faith and Credit; 

Registration not required 

1.  Under the Full Faith and Credit provisions of 
VAWA and pursuant to Oregon statutes, a 
foreign restraining order is enforceable in 
Oregon if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ORS 24.190(2). 
18 USC § 2265(d)(2). 

Protection orders entitled to Full Faith and Credit 
under VAWA may be civil or criminal and are not 
limited to those protecting intimate partners. “Foreign 
restraining orders” include those from other states, as 
well as orders of a tribal court. 18 USC §§ 2265, 
2266; ORS 24.190(1)(b)(B). 

A foreign restraining order is enforceable in Oregon 
without the necessity of filing with the court or any 
further action by the protected person. ORS 
24.190(2)(a). See exceptions to enforceability in 
VI.A.2. (pg. ). ORS 

24.190(3)(a). 

a.  the issuing court had subject matter and 
personal jurisdiction over Respondent; 

b.  Respondent was given notice and an 

opportunity to be heard under the law of 
the issuing state or, in the case of an ex 
parte order, Respondent will be given 
notice and an opportunity to be heard 
within a reasonable period of time; and 

c.  the order has not expired. 

2.  A restraining order from another state or 

tribal court is enforceable immediately upon 
the protected person’s arrival in Oregon. 
Registration with the court or law 
enforcement is not required. Federal law 
prohibits states from requiring registration as 
a condition of full faith and credit. 

3.  If the order restrains Petitioner as well as 

Respondent, the order will not be 
enforceable against Petitioner unless 
Respondent filed a separate pleading 
seeking a restraining order and the court 
made specific findings that Respondent was 
entitled to the order. 
 

B.  Optional Registration 

1.  With Law Enforcement 

The protected person may choose to register 
the foreign order with law enforcement. Entry 
into the Law Enforcement Data System (LEDS) 
ensures that all police agencies statewide have 
notice of the order and provide mandatory arrest 
protection. The protected person must provide a 
copy of the order and certify that it is the most 
recent order and that the restrained person has 
actual notice of the order. Federal law prohibits 
the state from notifying Respondent of the 
registration unless Petitioner requests this step.

VII.  MANDATORY ARREST FOR 
VIOLATION OF ORDER 

A.  Oregon Restraining Orders 

18 USC § 2265(d)(1). 
ORS 24.190(6). 

ORS. 24.190(4). See VI.A.2. (pg. 30) regarding 
“qualifying” orders. 

See ORS 107.728. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

- 31 - 

2.  With the Courts 

The protected person may choose to file a 
certified copy of the foreign order with the court. 
Federal law prohibits the state from notifying 
Respondent of the filing unless Petitioner 
requests this notice. When filed, a foreign order 
is enforceable the same as an Oregon order. 

 

C.  Violation of Foreign Orders 

A “qualifying” foreign restraining order is 
enforceable by contempt. In general, venue for 
punitive contempt cases for violations of FAPA 
orders may lie in either the county of issuance or 
the county of violation. Given the fact of issuance 
outside of Oregon, contempt cases for violation of 
foreign restraining orders should proceed in the 
county of violation. The person initiating the 
contempt action must file a certified copy of the 
order with the court in which the contempt action 
is initiated. 

Arrest is mandatory when a law enforcement 
officer has probable cause to believe that 

1.  a court has issued a FAPA order; 

2.  Respondent (called “Defendant” in the 

contempt proceeding) has been served with 
the FAPA order; 

3.  a true copy of the FAPA order has been 
properly filed with law enforcement and 
entered into the LEDS; and 

4.  Respondent has violated the restraining 

order. 

 
B.  Foreign Restraining Orders 

Arrest is mandatory when 

1.  a protected person presents to a law 

enforcement officer a copy of the foreign 
restraining order that is entitled to full faith 
and credit (as defined by ORS 24.190); 

2.  the protected person represents that the 

order is the most recent order in effect and 
that Respondent has been personally served 
with a copy of the order or has actual notice 
or the order; and 

3.  the law enforcement officer has probable 
cause to believe that the person to be 
arrested has violated the foreign restraining 
order. 

4.  Arrest also is mandatory if the protected 
person has filed a copy of the foreign 
restraining order with the court or has been 
identified by a law enforcement officer as a 
party protected by a foreign restraining order 
entered into LEDS or the National Crime 
Information Center database and the officer 
has probable cause to believe that 
Respondent has violated the terms of the 
order. 
 

C.  Mandatory Arrest for Violating Certain 

Release Agreements 

Arrest also is mandatory for violations of a release 
agreement entered into after a person has been 
charged with a domestic violence offense and 
there is probable cause to believe that the person 
has violated a no contact condition of the release 
agreement. 
 

ORS 133.310(6); ORS 135.250(2).

generis, being neither civil nor criminal. 

 

1.  Remedial Sanctions Under ORS 33.015(4) 

A party, city attorney, district attorney, or the 
Attorney General may seek remedial sanctions. 

2.  Punitive Sanctions Under ORS 33.015(3) 

Only a public prosecutor (city attorney, district 
attorney, or the Attorney General) may seek 
punitive sanctions.

B.  Applicability of Procedural Rules 

1.  Remedial Contempt 

The Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure do not 
apply to remedial contempt proceedings unless 
specifically provided in statute or UTCR 
Chapter 19. 

2.  Punitive Contempt 

Generally, criminal procedure and Defendants’ 
constitutional and statutory protections apply in 
punitive contempt proceedings; however 
Defendants are not entitled to a jury trial. 

 

C.  Venue 

A contempt proceeding may be filed in either 
the county of issuance or the county of violation. 
 
D.  Trial 

1.  Burden of Proof and Elements of Charge 

To sustain a finding of contempt, the party 
initiating the contempt must prove that an order 
existed, that Defendant had knowledge of the 
order, and that Defendant willfully violated the 
order. 

a.  The party initiating the contempt must 
prove contempt beyond a reasonable 
doubt if punitive sanctions or confinement 
are sought. If confinement is not sought, 
the burden of proof in remedial cases is by 
clear and convincing evidence. 

b.  To sustain a finding of contempt, the party 

initiating the contempt must prove a 
violation of what the order actually 
prohibits. 

UTCR 19.040(1). 

ORS 33.055(12). 

ORS 33.065(5), (6).

ORS 107.728. 

 

 

 

See Couey and Couey, 312 Or 302 (1991). 

Although private parties may bring remedial contempt 
proceedings (see VIII.A. (pg. 32)), these rarely are 
filed, as typically the district attorney will seek punitive 
contempt sanctions instead. Although most of the 
cases cited and some of the statutory references in 
this section specifically apply to punitive contempt, 
these may apply to remedial contempt by analogy. 

ORS 33.055(11); ORS 33.065(9). 

State v. Trivitt, 247 Or App 199 (2011) (discussing 
meaning of “interfere with” in context of Defendant’s 
actions in holding a sign at the end of a third party’s 
driveway stating that Petitioner had genital herpes); 
Gerlack v. Roberts, 152 Or App 40 (1998) (Defendant 
coming within 150 feet of Petitioner in store not a 
violation, as FAPA order only prohibited Defendant 
from coming within 150 feet of Petitioner in certain 
other designated locations). 

 

 

- 33 - 

OEC 803(8)(b), (d) (ORS 40.460(8)(b), (d)) allows 
proof of service to be established by introduction of a 
sheriff’s return of service. (Note: OEC 803(8)(d) 
(ORS 40.460(8)(d)) was amended in 2011 to 
specifically allow introduction of a sheriff’s return of 
service without necessity of officer testifying.) Return 
of service is sufficient to find that Defendant was 
served and to infer beyond a reasonable doubt that 
Defendant’s violation of the restraining order was 
knowing. Frady v. Frady, 185 Or App 245 (2002). 
However, see commentary to VIII.F.4.d. (pg. 39) 
regarding applicability in punitive contempt 
proceedings. 

Couey and Couey, 312 Or 302 (1991). 

ORS 33.015(2)(b) (contempt includes “willful” 
disobedience of a court order or judgment). 

State v. Montgomery, 216 Or App 221 (2007) (“mere 
accident” not “willful”). 

Note that service of process per ORCP 7 or 9 is not a 
violation of a FAPA order. ORS 107.718(12). 

See cases cited in VIII.D. (pg. 33). 

Actions that may be prohibited by a FAPA order are 
set forth in ORS 107.718(1) and (2). 

The definitions of “interfere,” “intimidate,” “menace,” 
and “molest” are set forth in ORS 107.705(5) to (8). 
See also I.C. (pp. 1-3) and III.A.2. (pg. 6). 

See, e.g., State ex rel Mix v. Newland, 277 Or 191 
(1977). 

Only if Defendant has not had a meaningful 
opportunity to challenge the validity of the FAPA order 
might this defense be available. Such a situation 
appears unlikely, given that the 5- and 21-day 
hearings almost always would occur before 
adjudication of a contempt case. 

ORS 33.055 (10); ORS 33.065(7). 
State v. Keller, 246 Or App 105, 108 (2011); State ex 
rel Mikkelsen v. Hill, 315 Or 452, 459 (1993). 

ORS 161.055(2). 

 

 

 

 

 

- 34 - 

c.  Defendant’s knowledge of the order may 

be proven by evidence that Defendant was 
served with the order. 

2.  Willfulness 

Defendant’s conduct must be a willful violation 
of a court order. Voluntary noncompliance with 
the order is sufficient to establish “willfulness.” 
“Bad intent” is not an element of contempt 
separate from the requirement of “willfulness.” 
“Bad faith” is not required. However, “merely 
accidental” conduct does not establish 
“willfulness.” 

3.  Defenses 

a.  Vagueness of Order 

To sustain the finding of contempt, the party 
initiating the contempt must prove a violation 
of what the order actually prohibits. 

b.  Invalidity of Underlying Order 

The fact that Petitioner’s situation did not 
qualify for the underlying restraining order is 
not a defense to contempt, as that is an 
impermissible collateral attack when argued in 
the contempt case. 

c.  Inability to Comply 

Inability to comply with the restraining order is 
an affirmative defense. Defendant has the 
burden of proof on this defense and must 
establish inability to comply by a 
preponderance of the evidence to prevail. In 
punitive contempt cases, Defendant must file 
and serve prior notice of the defense on the 
prosecutor not less than five days before trial. 

d.  Petitioner’s Conduct Irrelevant 

Although Defendants often raise it as a 
mitigating factor or defense, Petitioner’s 
conduct is not relevant in a contempt 
proceeding. 

ORS 33.055(2) - (5). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

e.  Asserting Parenting Time Rights 

Parenting time with minor children often puts 
Defendant in the vicinity of Petitioner, which 
may result in an arrest for violation of the 
restraining order if a disagreement arises. In 
such cases, Defendant may be found in 
contempt if Defendant's behavior exceeded 
the parameters of Defendant's parenting time 
or was otherwise intimidating, interfering, or 
menacing within the meaning of the FAPA 
statutes. 
f.  Mental Illness 

Mental illness is a defense to the same extent 
that it would constitute a defense or mitigate 
liability in a criminal case. 

 

E.  Remedial Contempt 

1.  Procedure 

a.  A proceeding for remedial sanctions is 

commenced by a motion with supporting 
affidavit or other documentation sufficient 
to give Defendant notice of the specific 
acts alleged as contempt. 

b.  The court may issue an order to appear 

that is specific enough to give Defendant 
notice of the acts of contempt. 

c.  The order to appear must be personally 

served unless 

1) Defendant waives personal service 

under ORS 107.835 as part of the order 
allegedly violated; 

2) the court orders substitute service; or 

3) the court issues an arrest warrant upon 
motion, affidavit, and a finding that 
Defendant cannot be served. 

the sanctions sought. 
 

2.  Defendant’s Rights 

a.  Defendant has only those rights afforded a 

Defendant in a civil action unless the 
sanction of confinement is sought. 

UTCR 19.020(1). 

d.  The motion and order to appear must state 

ORS 33.055(7), (8). 
State ex rel Hathaway v. Hart, 300 Or 231 (1985). 

 

- 35 - 

b.  Where the sanction of confinement is 
sought, the court must not impose 
confinement unless, before the hearing, 
Defendant is 

1) informed that the sanction of 

confinement may be imposed and 

2) afforded the right to court-appointed 

counsel, if eligible. 

c.  If Defendant is not represented by counsel 
when coming before the court, then the 
court shall inform Defendant of the right to 
counsel. The court also shall advise 
Defendant of the right to have counsel 
appointed by the court if confinement is 
sought and Defendant qualifies financially 
for appointed counsel. 

The court must afford Defendant an opportunity 
for a hearing before imposing sanctions unless 
Defendant waives the right to a hearing by 
stipulated order. 

1) Clear and convincing evidence unless 

confinement is sought, and 

2) if confinement is sought, proof must be 

beyond a reasonable doubt. 

b.  Defenses 

The same defenses may apply to punitive 
contempt and remedial contempt. 

c.  Available Sanctions 

Sanctions  should  be  imposed  to  change 
behavior  or  compensate  for  damage,  not  to 
punish. The court may impose one or more of 
the following sanctions: 

1) restitution; 

2) confinement, which may be imposed for 
so long as the contempt continues or six 
months, whichever is the shorter period; 

ORS 33.055(8)(a). 

ORS 33.055(8)(b).

3.  Opportunity for Hearing 

ORS 33.055(11). 

a.  Burden of Proof 

ORS 135.247. 

1.  No Contact with Victim While Lodged 

3) a fine, which may be imposed as a 

compensatory fine of up to $500 or 1 
percent of Defendant's annual gross 
income, whichever is greater; 

4) an order designed to ensure compliance 
with the FAPA order that was violated, 
including probation; 

5) payment of attorney fees; and 

6) any other sanction that the court 
determines would be an effective 
remedy for the contempt. 

F.  Punitive Contempt 

If Defendant is lodged, entering an order 
prohibiting Defendant from contacting the victim 
while in custody should be considered. 

2.  Release from Custody 

a.  Pending a contempt hearing, a person 

arrested for a FAPA violation is subject to 
release decisions under ORS 135.230 to 
135.290. 

b.  Including a provision for “no contact” with 
the victim should be considered. If “no 
contact with the victim” is ordered, the 
court should consider waiving that 
provision if 

1) the victim petitions the court for a 

waiver and 
 

2) the court finds, after a hearing on the 

petition, that waiving the condition is in 
the best interest of the parties and the 
community. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The requirement that a no contact order be entered 
while a Defendant is in custody for a domestic 
violence crime is the result of HB 2925 (2011), 
codified at ORS 135.247. Although punitive contempt 
is not a crime (State v. Reynolds, 239 Or App (2010)), 
ORS 135.247 may apply to these proceedings 
pursuant to ORS 107.720(4) and ORS 33.065(5) 
(same requirements and laws applicable to an 
accusatory instrument in a criminal proceeding apply 
to punitive contempt cases). 

ORS 107.720(4). 

ORS 135.245(3). 

As with the requirement that a no contact order be 
entered while Defendant is in custody, it is an 
unsettled question as to whether ORS 107.720(4) or 
ORS 33.065(5) require the application of ORS 
135.250(2)(a) and (b) re:  imposition of no contact 
with victim and waiver of “no contact” provision by 
victim to punitive contempt proceedings. ORS 
135.250(2)(a) requires a “no contact” provision if 
Defendant is charged with an offense that also 
constitutes domestic violence. The issue is whether a 
punitive contempt proceeding for violation of a FAPA 
order is “an offense that also constitutes domestic 
violence.” (Note: ORS 135.230(3) defines "domestic 
violence" as "abuse between family or household 
members." This definition of "family or household 
members" is similar to the definition for FAPAs found 
at ORS 107.705(4).) 

ORS 135.250(2)(b) sets forth the considerations for 
waiver of the “no contact with victim” order if imposed 
pursuant to ORS 135.250(2)(a).) 

 

 

 

 

- 37 - 

ORS 107.720(4); ORS 135.245(3). 

To release on recognizance, the court should review 
the record of any prior domestic violence arrests. 

The court should consider working with law 
enforcement, release officers, and prosecutors to 
ensure that victims receive notice of the release 
hearing, their right to appear personally at the 
hearing, their right to reasonably express any views 
relevant to the issues in the hearing, and to ensure 
that victims are notified that Defendant will be 
released. See ORS 135.245(5)(a)(A)(B). 

ORS 33.065(2).

also Bachman v. Bachman (consolidated with State 
v.Bachman), 171 Or App 665 (2000). 

 

- 38 - 

c.  The usual security for violation of the 
restraining order is $5,000. The court 
may set a different amount, e.g., higher, 
if the court concludes that the higher 
amount will ensure that Respondent later 
appears and “does not engage in 
domestic violence while on release.” 

3.  Accusatory Instrument Required 

An accusatory instrument is required to initiate a 
punitive contempt proceeding. 

a.  The prosecutor may initiate proceedings 
on his or her own initiative or on the 
request of a party or of the court. 

b.  The accusatory instrument is subject to 

the same requirements and laws 
applicable to those in criminal 
proceedings in general. For example, 

1) Defendant must personally be served 

a copy of the instrument and be 
arraigned; and 

2) Defendant may move against the 

instrument by demurrer. 

c.  In addition, the following information must 
be included in the initiating instrument: 

1) the maximum sanctions sought; 

2) whether those sanctions include 

incarceration; and 

3) for each sanction sought, whether the 
moving party considers it punitive or 
remedial. 

d.  The instrument should set out a separate 
count for each violation to be proved. 

4.  Defendant’s Rights 
Except for the right to a jury trial, Defendant 
generally has all rights normally accorded 
criminal Defendants, including the following: 

a.  the presumption of innocence; 

b.  the right to counsel, including court- 

appointed counsel if indigent; 

c.  the right to a speedy trial; and 

d.  the right to discovery. 

It is reversible error for the court to allow Defendant to 
represent himself without first determining whether 
Defendant’s waiver of right to counsel is voluntary, 
knowing, and intelligent. State v. Cervantes, 238 Or 
App 745 (2010). 

Failure  of  court  to  warn  Defendant  of  risk  and 
difficulties  of  self-representation  warrants  reversal  of 
contempt adjudication. Pearson and Pearson, 136 Or 
App 20 (1995). 

An unsettled question is the extent to which Defendant 
has confrontation rights in a punitive contempt case. 
ORS 33.065 (6) provides that, except for a jury trial, 
Defendant in a punitive contempt proceeding is entitled 
to the constitutional protections that Defendant is 
entitled to in a criminal proceeding. In State v.Tryon, 
242 Or App 51 (2011), the Court of Appeals held that a 
return of service of a restraining order was admissible 
to prove Defendant’s knowledge of the restraining 
order. The court’s holding was premised on its finding 
that a return of service is not testimonial in nature, 
despite objection based on the federal confrontation 
clause. However, the issue of state constitutional 
confrontation rights was not preserved for appeal in 
Tryon. State v. Copeland, 247 Or App 362 (2011), 
then reached the state constitutional objection, holding 
that a return of service is a public record that falls into 
a historical exception to Article 1, section 11, of the 
Oregon Constitution. In October 2012, the Oregon 
Supreme Court granted review in Copeland on both 
the state and federal confrontation clause issues. See 
also State v. Johnson, 221 Or App 394 (2008) 
(discussing in a probation violation context the 
balancing test regarding confrontation rights required 
under federal due process). 

See ORS 135.335. Courts should enter pleas of 
“admit” or “deny”, not “guilty” or “not guilty” to 
distinguish contempt cases from criminal cases in 
accordance with State v. Reynolds, 239 Or App 
(2010). 

 

 

 

 

 

5.  Pleas and Sanctions 

a.  Admit, Deny and No Contest Pleas 

The court may take an admission or a 
denial to allegations. Some, but not all 
courts allow a “no contest” plea. 

b.  Time for Imposition of Sanctions/Entry of 

Judgment 

The time period between plea/adjudication 
and imposition of sanctions/entry of 
judgment is subject to the restrictions of 
ORS 137.020. 

1) protect victims and family members 

who are directly or indirectly affected 
by domestic violence; 

2) hold offenders accountable for their 

behavior; and 

See Article I, section 15, of the Oregon Constitution. 

c.  Sanction Objectives: 

 

- 39 - 

ORS 33.105(2). Judgments for punitive contempt are 
not criminal judgments, therefore, using a criminal 
judgment form is reversible error. State v. Reynolds, 
239 Or App (2010). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3) reduce future violations through 

i.  strict supervision and 

ii.  effective offender treatment 

programs. 

d.  Maximum Punitive Sanctions 

The maximum punitive sanctions are 

1) a fine not to exceed $500 or 1 percent 
of Defendant’s gross annual income, 
whichever is greater; 

2) confinement of no more than six 

months; 

3) forfeiture of any proceeds or profits 
obtained through the contempt; 

4) probation, which may include a 

condition that Defendant attend and 
complete a batterer intervention 
program; and/or 

5) community service.

DECISIONS FROM THE OREGON APPELLATE COURTS 
CITING THE FAMILY ABUSE PREVENTION ACT 
(October 2017) 

regon Supreme Court 

n Re Jagger, 357 Or 295 (2015) 
The court found that Accused, an attorney, had violated RPC 1.1 (failure to provide competent 
representation) and RPC 1.2(c) (counseling or assisting client to engage in conduct the accused 
knows to be illegal or fraudulent). Accused represented Respondent Mr. Fan, who Petitioner Ms. 
Yang had a FAPA restraining order against. At the time, Respondent was also in jail on a criminal 
complaint  arising  from  the  same  incident  that  gave  rise  to  the  restraining  order.  Accused  had 
arranged a time for Petitioner to come by his office at a later date, but Petitioner unexpectedly 
came  by  Accused’s  office  at  a  time  when  Accused  was  on  the  phone  with  Respondent  in  a 
conference  room.  Accused  invited  Petitioner  to  speak  with  Respondent  for  the  purpose  of 
discussing  the  situation.  Accused  then  left  the  conference  room  for  several  minutes  while  Ms. 
Yang and Mr. Fan spoke. 

ased on Mr. Fan’s participation in the conversation he was convicted of contempt of court for 
violating the contact provision of the restraining order. First, Accused contended that Petitioner 
voluntarily  initiated  the  contact  with  Respondent,  but  the  court  found  that  the  record  did  not 
support that contention. Second, Accused contended that he did not knowingly violate the law 
because the FAPA order prohibits the restrained person from taking affirmative action to contact 
the person who filed for the restraining order, and Respondent did not do so. The court disagreed 
with Accused’s interpretation of the FAPA restraining order and suspended him from practicing 
law for 90 days. 

eikkila v. Heikkila, 355 Or 753 (2014) 

The court held that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction in an appeal because of a defect in 
service  of  process.  Petitioner  (wife)  was  granted  a  restraining  order  against  Respondent 
(husband), and Respondent appealed. Respondent’s attorney filed a notice of appeal, and sent 
a  copy  to  Petitioner,  but  not  to  Petitioner’s  attorney,  as  required  by  ORCP  9  B.  Respondent’s 
attorney, citing ORS 19.270, argued that the plain text of the jurisdictional statutes requires that 
notice of appeal be served to other “parties” to the case. Respondent’s attorney said that because 
Petitioner  was  the  other  party  to  the  case,  and  she  had  been  served  with  timely  notice  of  the 
appeal, the court of appeals had jurisdiction. 

he court said that while Respondent’s interpretation was plausible, ORS 19.270 specifies that 
timely service is jurisdictional, but does not specify how such service must be accomplished to 
confer  jurisdiction  to  the  court  of  appeals.  The  court  held  that  ORS  19.500  filled  that  gap  by 
providing that when a document needs to be served or filed, that should be done so in compliance 
with ORCP 9 B, and therefore affirmed the order of the court of appeals. 

tate v. Copeland, 353 Or 816 (2013) 

Defendant was charged with punitive contempt for violating the restraining order. To show the 
Defendant had been served the restraining order, the State offered a deputy sheriff’s certificate 
of service. Defendant objected to the certificate claiming it violated his confrontation rights under

n re Knappenberger, 338 Or 341 (2005) 
Where Husband consulted Attorney about representation in a divorce case but also discussed a 
history of Family Abuse Prevention Act (FAPA) restraining orders between the parties as well as 
Husband’s  thoughts  about  applying  for  new  FAPA  order,  Attorney  may  not  represent  Wife 
regarding the divorce or a restraining order Husband later obtains against Wife. Attorney’s advice 
to  Husband  on  several  substantive  aspects  of  divorce,  even  if  Attorney  was  not  ultimately 
retained, rendered Husband a former client of Attorney for purpose of former client/same matter 
conflict rule and precluded representing Wife on the divorce. 

oreover, as Attorney also discussed with Husband the factual details regarding Wife’s current 
restraining  order  and  each  spouses’  motivation  for  obtaining  such  orders  and  also  advised 
Husband on evidence a court would require from Husband if he sought a new FAPA order for 
himself,  defending  Wife  on  that  new  FAPA  order  that  Husband  later  obtained  pro  se  was 
precluded. Attorney’s representation of Husband provided him with confidences and secrets the 
use of which was likely to damage Husband in the course of Attorney’s defense of Wife. 

State ex rel Marshall v. Hargreaves, 302 Or 1 (1986) 
Defendant judge had no discretion to deny realtor a hearing for a restraining order because she 
had  filed,  withdrawn,  and  dismissed  two  previous  restraining  orders  under  Family  Abuse 
Prevention Act. ORS 107.718 is mandatory, not permissive, and does not give judges discretion 
to deny hearings for restraining orders. 

athaway v. Hart, 300 Or 231 (1985), aff'd 70 Or App 541 (1984) 

A  defendant  in  a  criminal  contempt  proceeding  (under former contempt statutes)  charged  with 
violating a restraining order under the Family Abuse Prevention Act is not entitled to a trial by jury. 
Criminal  contempts  are  unique  proceedings,  not  "criminal  actions"  within  the  meaning  of  state 
statutes  requiring  jury  trials.  Nor  are  criminal  contempts  "criminal  prosecutions"  within  the 
meaning of the state constitution provision that guarantees jury trials, as disposition of contempts 
without jury trials was well established at the time the state constitution was drafted. 

earing v. Weaver, 295 Or 702 (1983) 

Police officers who knowingly fail to enforce Family Abuse Prevention Act restraining orders by 
arrest are potentially liable for resulting physical and emotional harm to persons protected by the 
order.  The  defense  of  discretion  does  not  preclude  liability,  as  officers  are  not  engaged  in  a 
discretionary  function  when  they  must  evaluate  and  act  upon  a  factual  judgment.  Moreover, 
statutory  immunity  for  good  faith  arrests  under  the  Family  Abuse  Prevention  Act  does  not 
immunize the failure to arrest. 

After the court issued plaintiff a restraining order prohibiting her husband from entering her home 
or  molesting  her,  plaintiff's  husband  twice  again  entered  plaintiff's  home.  Plaintiff  reported  the 
incidents  to  defendant  officer  and  asked  him  to  arrest  plaintiff's  husband.  After  confirming  the 
restraining  order  and  the  damage  plaintiff's  husband  caused,  defendant  declined  to  arrest 
husband because defendant had not seen husband on the premises. Husband later threatened 
and assaulted plaintiff's friend in plaintiff's presence.)

regon Court of Appeals 

tate v. Balero, 287 Or App 678 (2017) 

Defendant appeals trial court’s finding him in contempt of court for violating the FAPA restraining 
order.  Defendant  asserts  that  the  state  failed  to  present  legally  sufficient  evidence  that  he 
‘interfered’ or attempted to ‘interfere’ with the person protected by the FAPA order (Petitioner). 
While the FAPA order was in effect, Defendant sent an email to Petitioner’s employer asserting 
that “petitioner had committed theft and fraud, and he expressed concern that she might use her 
position to steal personal information from other employees.” The Court analyzed “interference” 
in this case as they did in State v. Trivitt, 247 Or App 199 (2011) finding that though the conduct 
may have been offensive, and it may have been ‘taking part in the concern of others’ it was not 
interference. Reversed. 

.D.D. v. Alonso, 285 Or App 620 (2017) 

Respondent  appealed  the  trial  court’s  order  continuing  the  FAPA  restraining  order  against 
Respondent.  Respondent  assigned  error  to  the  trial  court’s  issuance  of  the  FAPA  restraining 
order. 

n  appeal,  Respondent  argued  that  “the  record  does  not  support  the  trial  court’s  finding  that 
abuse occurred.” Importantly, Respondent did not preserve the issue that either the second or 
the  third  elements  necessary for  a  FAPA  order to  be  upheld  were  held  in  error,  and  therefore 
those  contentions  were  not  considered  on  appeal.  The  Court  did  consider  whether  abuse 
occurred, but declined to exercise de novo review. The standard of review of a continuance of a 
FAPA restraining order is “whether any evidence supports the court’s finding that abuse satisfying 
FAPA’s criteria occurred.” See Patton v. Patton, 278 Or App 720, 721, 377 P3d 657 (2016). In 
this case, Respondents argues that the facts he disputes were not sufficiently creditable to find 
abuse occurred. Given the standard of review, the Court of Appeals declined to engage in any 
“reweighing of the evidence.” Affirmed. 

.V.-B. v. Burns, 284 Or App 366 (2017) 

Respondent appealed the trial court's order continuing Petitioner’s FAPA restraining order against 
him.  Respondent  argued  that  the  trial  court's  decision  was  not  supported  by  legally  sufficient 
evidence to meet the necessary threshold: that he was a "credible threat" to Petitioner’s physical 
safety. 

he  Court  found  that  the  trial  court  based  its  decision  primarily  on  Petitioner  and  daughter's 
subjective fear of Respondent, and that since the time that Respondent and Petitioner stopped 
living together, there was no evidence regarding abuse or concerns of abuse. The Court held that, 
even if Petitioner proved a qualifying incident of abuse, there was insufficient evidence to support 
a  conclusion  that  Respondent  presented  a  "credible  threat"  to  Petitioner’s  physical  safety. 
Reversed. 

.K. v. Stutzman, 281 Or App 388 (2016) 

Respondent  appealed  the  trial  court’s  order  continuing  the  FAPA  restraining  order  after  a 
contested hearing. The FAPA arises from an incident between Respondent (aunt) and Petitioner 
(niece) where Respondent yelled at Petitioner, accused her of using drugs and being involved in 
pornography, grabs Petitioner’s arm when she walked away, and told Petitioner “if we weren’t at 
church you’d be dead right now.” In Respondent’s assignment of error, she contended Petitioner

failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate she was in “imminent danger of further abuse” 
and that Respondent was “a credible threat to [her] physical safety” ORS 107.718(1). Per the trial 
court’s factual finding, there is no evidence that Respondent had ever harmed or attempted to 
harm Petitioner (or another person). 

he Court held that person’s subjective fear is insufficient to support a FAPA restraining order. 
Hubbel  v.  Sanders,  245  Or  App  321,  326,  263  P3d  1096  (2011).  During  the  single  event  that 
triggered  Petitioner  to  seek  this  temporary  restraining  order,  the  court  found  that  even  if 
respondent’s actions were to be considered “abuse”, Petitioner still failed to establish the other 
two requirements: (1) that she was in “imminent danger of further abuse” and (2) that Respondent 
was “a credible threat to [her] physical safety”. Reversed. 

.M.J. v. Captain, 281 Or App 360 (2016); (EPPDAPA case) 

Respondent  appealed  the  entry  of  an  order  for  a  temporary  restraining  order.  Respondent 
assigned error to the trial court’s denial of an opportunity to question the only witness against him, 
Petitioner. Respondent was not represented by counsel in the trial court. During the outset of the 
hearing, the trial court announced it would not allow parties to ask questions of each other. The 
trial court allowed parties "to respond" and make statements, but did not ask questions on behalf 
of parties. Respondent did not object and so the error was not preserved. Respondent asked the 
Court to review the assignment of error anyway under plain error review. 

nder the  two-step  plain  error review  analysis,  "the  error must  be  apparent  on the  face  of the 
record." If error was committed, the Court must "decide to exercise . . . discretion to reach the 
error." Under step one, it was apparent on the record that the trial court did not give Respondent 
the opportunity to cross-examine Petitioner. Step two permits the Court to exercise its discretion 
to reach the unpreserved error. Balancing the "gravity of error" against the competing interests of 
the parties, and the additional burden of the trial court to allow cross-examination, Respondent's 
fundamental right to cross examination to ensure fair judicial proceedings was not outweighed by 
other  factors.  A  trial  court  has  limited  discretion  to  control  cross-examination,  but  cannot 
completely deny that right; doing so is a legal error. Reversed and remanded. 

.R. v. Gannon, 281 Or App 1 (2016)  

Respondent appealed a supplemental judgment denying him attorney fees and costs. Petitioner 
sought  a  restraining  order.  (ORS  107.710).  The  trial  court  granted  the  order  after  an  ex  parte 
hearing. (ORS 107.718(1)). Respondent requested a hearing (ORS 107.718(10)) to contest the 
factual  basis  of  the  restraining  order;  the  hearing  was  held  December  16,  2014,  during  which 
Petitioner  asked  the  court  to  dismiss  the  petition  and  restraining  order  without  prejudice  and 
without an award of fees and costs. The court dismissed but postponed ruling on fees and costs 
until  Respondent  submitted  a  petition.  Respondent  filed  his  petition,  but  the  court  denied  it, 
concluding because the December 16th hearing was not a contested hearing on the evidence 
concerning  the  restraining  order,  the  court  did  not  make  a  finding  on  the  evidence,  and 
consequently there was no legal basis to award fees. 

espondent appealed, arguing the trial court could award attorney fees under 107.716(3). The 
Court  held  that  a  hearing  held  pursuant  to  107.718(10)  is  a  hearing  where  parties  have  an 
opportunity  to  be  heard  on  the  issues  of  law  or  fact  that  are  placed  before  the  court  in  the 
requested hearing, limited to the relief available to a petitioner in ORS 107.718(1), which includes 
temporary custody orders, a restraining order, and other relief necessary to provide for the safety 
and welfare of the petitioner. Because the December 16th hearing did not reach any of the ORS

107.718(1) issues, the court did not hold a hearing pursuant to ORS 107.718(10) and correctly 
concluded it lacked authority to award attorney fees. Affirmed. 

.L.D. v. Daley, 280 Or App 448 (2016) 

Respondent appealed an order continuing a FAPA restraining order against him after a contested 
hearing. Respondent argued that Petitioner failed to provide evidence satisfying the requirements 
of ORS 107.718(1). Under ORS 107.718(1), “a FAPA restraining order will be upheld only if the 
evidence established that the alleged conduct create[d] an imminent danger of further abuse and 
a credible threat to the physical safety of the petitioner.” Hannemann v. Anderson, 251 Or App 
207, 213 (2012). In this case, Respondent yelled at Petitioner to get out of the home and raised 
his hand “so he was close to her face” which, the trial court found, placed her in fear of imminent 
bodily  injury.  However  there  was  no  testimony  that  respondent  ‘raised  his  hand’  during  the 
incident. The Court held that, even if there was sufficient evidence to prove an incident of abuse, 
the evidence in the record was insufficient to find that there was an “imminent danger of further 
abuse”  or  that  Respondent  was  a  “credible  threat  to  the  physical  safety  of  the  Petitioner.” 
Reversed. 

.M.P. v. Patton, 278 Or App 720 (2016) 

Respondent and Petitioner were married in 2011 and do not have any joint children. On August 
18, 2014, Petitioner and Respondent went to a marriage counseling session where they decided 
that they would separate temporarily and Respondent would remove his trailer from their property. 
The next day, the two had an argument when Respondent said he would not be removing his 
trailer  that  day.  During  the  argument,  Respondent  threatened  to  smash  Petitioner’s  car  and 
destroy  her  belongings.  Respondent  also  cornered  Petitioner  in  a  bedroom.  Petitioner  pushed 
and kicked Respondent and told Respondent she would not call the police, so Respondent left 
the  bedroom.  On  August  22,  Petitioner  filed  for  a  restraining  order.  Respondent  requested  a 
hearing. 

t  the  hearing,  Petitioner  testified  that  Respondent  had  been  moody  and  angry,  that  he  stole 
Petitioner’s prescription medication, and that he said that he was going to get a gun a few months 
previously. The restraining order was granted, and Respondent appealed. 

elying  on  Hubbell,  the  court  said  that  the  question  to  consider  was  whether  the  evidence 
suggested that Petitioner was in imminent danger of further abuse from Respondent and whether 
Respondent  represented  a  credible  threat  the  Petitioner’s  safety.  The  court  concluded  that 
Respondent’s aggressive behavior, threats to destroy Petitioner’s belongings, and statement that 
he was going to get a gun did not demonstrate that Respondent created or continued to create 
an imminent danger of further abuse or a credible threat to petitioner’s physical safety. Reversed. 

ecker v. Klapatch, 275 Or App 992 (2015); (EPPDAPA case) 

Petitioner appealed an order dismissing a restraining order he obtained under the Elderly Persons 
and Persons with Disabilities Abuse Prevention Act (EPPDAPA). Petitioner argued that the trial 
court  erred  first,  in  denying  his  motion  for  a  continuance  in  order  to  have  time  to  present  his 
witness, and second, in refusing to allow him to call his witness. The court limited its discussion 
to the first assignment of error only, and held that the trial court abused its discretion in denying 
Petitioner’s motion for a continuance. 

espondent  was  Petitioner’s  former  landlord.  In  his  petition,  Petitioner  stated  that  he  had 
disabilities relating to his speech, his left leg, his right hand, and that Respondent had harassed 
and abused him. Petitioner stated that he was in fear for his physical safety and that Respondent

had used “derogatory or inappropriate names.” At the contested hearing, Petitioner testified that 
Respondent had attempted to run him over, followed him, and reported him to the police over 150 
times. 

etitioner’s testimony also included several references to a witness he had that would testify in 
support  of  his  petition.  Following  a  lengthy  cross  examination  of  Petitioner  by  Respondent’s 
attorney, the trial court denied Petitioner’s request to continue the matter to give him time to call 
his witness. 

he court found that there was no indication Petitioner was dilatory in presenting his witness or 
was manipulating the judicial process; rather, Petitioner was testifying on his own behalf without 
understanding  that  there  was  a  strict  time  limit  being  imposed  on  him.  Based  on  the 
circumstances, the court concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in denying Petitioner’s 
motion for a continuance. 

.C.L. v. Agustin, 271 Or App 149 (2015) 

Defendant was charged with two counts of violating a FAPA restraining order that his longtime 
domestic partner had filed. Defendant was unable to read English and his primary language was 
Spanish. The Washington County Sheriff served defendant, and explained parts of the restraining 
order  in  English.  Among  other  things,  the  Sheriff  explained  the  distance  and  contact  rules. 
Petitioner was stopped for a traffic violation a few months later. She called defendant and asked 
him to come by. Defendant drove to petitioner’s location to help petitioner, and was arrested to 
violating the restraining order. 

t trial, the court indicated that it found the petitioner and the sheriff’s testimonies credible when 
they  testified  that  the  defendant  understood  the  restraining  order.  After  the  state  rested, 
Defendant’s lawyer called Defendant to the stand. Before he began to testify, the Court cautioned 
the Defendant about testifying. Among other things, the court said: “I should put it this way. If a 
middle class person with 35 years of legal experience thinks he’s lying, you may have a different 
result than if he exercises his right to remain silent.” 

he court of appeals held that the trial court’s advice crossed the line from a permissible warning 
to impermissible coercion, which violated Defendant’s rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
The  court  said  that  the  trial  court’s  colloquy  caused  Defendant  not  to  testify,  even  though 
Defendant  had  planned  to  testify,  and  that  precluded  Defendant  from  presenting  a  defense. 
Reversed and remanded. 

.P.O v. Jeffries, 267 Or App 118 (2014) 

Mother and Father were not married, but had one child together. Father filed a FAPA petition for 
a restraining order, as well as a domestic relations petition for dissolution. In a hearing on March 
9, 2012, the court consolidated the cases and continued the restraining order. On March 16, 2012, 
the trial court entered an Order After Hearing. Mother filed an appeal on July 2, and contended to 
the court that her appeal was timely because the trial court did not dispose of the FAPA case until 
the general judgement was entered on June 13. The court held that the proper date of reference 
for the 30-day window to file an appeal was the date which the Order After Hearing was entered, 
not when the general judgement was entered. The court affirmed the trial court’s judgement in 
the domestic relations case without a written discussion and dismissed the appeal in the FAPA 
case as untimely.

State v. Crombie, 267 Or App 705 (2014) 
The court held that Defendant violated a FAPA restraining order when he used court documents 
to communicate with Victim. In a five-page document entitled “Addendem [sic] to Response and 
Counterclaim”  Defendant  disputed  Victim’s  claim  of  irreconcilable  differences  in  regard  to their 
pending divorce and professed his love for Victim and their children. Defendant then proceeded 
to provide his account of events that had transpired in his and Victim’s marriage, and, referring to 
Victim in the 3rd person, gave reasons the two should not divorce. In the concluding paragraphs, 
Defendant addressed Victim directly with phrases that included: “Bye Baby.  I will ALWAYS love 
you!”  The  court  held  that  the  documents  were  a  violation  of  the  FAPA  order  because  had 
Defendant  expressed  the  content  that  was  in  the  court  materials  in  a  letter  written  directly  to 
Victim, Defendant would be in clear violation of the FAPA order, and the court would not allow 
Defendant to use the court system to accomplish the same aim. 

.M.V. v. Ackley, 261 Or App 491 (2014) 

Petitioner and Respondent were in a three and a half year, live-in intimate relationship. The two 
also worked together. Respondent and Petitioner had a volatile relationship, which led Petitioner 
to  obtain  an  ex  parte  FAPA  limiting  contact  to  emails.  The  parties  continued  to  work  together 
following a work separation plan. The Respondent ended the relationship over email and resigned 
from  a  music-event  group  both  participated  in  over  email.  Petitioner  testified  that  Respondent 
violated the ex parte FAPA on at least two occasions, once by entering her side of the building at 
work, and once by responding to a group email that he was planning on attending an event at 
which Petitioner was performing. However, Respondent did not end up attending the event. 

he Court of Appeals held that a Petitioner’s subjective fear is not enough evidence to show an 
imminent danger or a credible threat. Although the relationship was volatile, once it ended and 
the parties stopped living together, the volatility ended. The parties continued to work together 
and have common social circles and have not had an incident since. Thus the Court of Appeals 
reversed the trial court and the FAPA was dismissed. 

.R.J. v. Kore, 2013 Or App LEXIS 526 (2013)/ N.R.J. v. P.K., 256 Or App 514 (Or 

App 2013) 
Petitioner filed a FAPA against respondent. At the FAPA hearing, the court dismissed the FAPA 
petition  and  then  issued  a  SPO  under  a  new  case  number  against  the  respondent.  The 
respondent  had  no  warning  and  was  not  given  a  chance  to  object  to  the  SPO.  The  Court  of 
Appeals reversed after noting the relevant statutes and the fact that the petitioner never requested 
a SPO and held that a circuit court does not have the authority to impose a SPO sua sponte. 

.K.C. v. Pitts, 258 Or App 676 (2013)* *Overturned on Reconsideration in S.K.C. v. 

Pitts, 259 Or App 543 (2013). 
Defendant was found in contempt of court and ordered to pay attorney fees, a unitary assessment, 
and an offense surcharge. Defendant appealed and Court of Appeals held that the trial court erred 
in assessing a unitary assessment and an offense surcharge. 

.J.P. v. Lempea, 251 Or App 656 (2012) 

Petitioner and Respondent lived together between March 2009 and December 2010. On January 
4, 2011, Petitioner requested, and was granted, a restraining order preventing Respondent from 
entering  Petitioner’s  property.  This  restraining  order  was  dismissed  on  January  13,  2011.  On 
January  23,  2011,  Respondent  and  his  son  arrived  at  Petitioner’s  property  to  get  his  things. 
Petitioner refused him entry and called 911. On January 25, 2011, Petitioner sought a second 
restraining  order.  This  restraining  order  was  continued  at  the  contested  hearing.  Respondent

appealed, contending that Petitioner failed to present sufficient evidence to support issuance of 
the order. The Court of Appeals assumed for sake of discussion that Petitioner’s statement that 
“he squished me in doorway,” constituted abuse under ORS 107.705. The Court held, however, 
that “there was no evidence that Respondent posed an imminent danger of further abuse to the 
Petitioner and represents a credible to threat to her physical safety.” Thus, under the totality of 
the circumstances, the Court concluded that the trial court had erred in continuing the order. The 
Court of Appeals declined to exercise de novo review. 

.M.H v. Anderson, 251 Or App 209 (2012) 

Petitioner obtained a FAPA in 2009 upon learning that after years without contact, the respondent 
had called a mutual friend and asked about her. Petitioner testified that she was afraid he would 
come to Oregon and kill her, based on past threats and acts of abuse, and the trial court granted 
the  ex  parte  protective  order  and  continued  it  in  2010.  Petitioner’s  evidence  was  found  to  be 
legally insufficient to meet the “imminent danger of further abuse” requirement upon challenge by 
respondent, and the Oregon Court of Appeals reversed the trial court’s grant of the original FAPA 
restraining order. 

he court contrasted this case with cases (Hubbell and Lefebvre) where the respondent had made 
recent  communication  that  “reasonably  could  be  construed  as  threatening  imminent  harm” 
because  their  actions  demonstrated  an  obsession  with  petitioner.  (Respondent  in  Hubbell  had 
trespassed on petitioner’s property, chased her in his car, and made veiled threats to her directly; 
respondent  in  Lefebvre  lurked  near  petitioner’s  house  and  called  her  describing  the  sleeping 
clothes she was wearing.) The court acknowledged this petitioner’s genuine fear and the fact that 
“long- past acts or threats of violence, combined with evidence of a respondent’s present overtly 
or implicitly threatening behavior may justify issuance of a restraining order.” Although the court 
stated  this  was  a  “close  case,”  they  found  no  evidence  on  record  “from  which  a  factfinder 
reasonably could infer that petitioner is in imminent danger.” Petitioner presented evidence of the 
phone call in 2009 and a letter sent to her in 2005 wherein respondent stated he wanted to come 
get  his  possessions  from  her.  The  court  reasoned  that  because  neither  of  these  contacts 
contained overt or implicit threats, an inference of imminent danger “falls on the speculative side 
of  the  line,”  and  therefore  would  not  be  reasonable.  Because  the  court  found  that  petitioner’s 
evidence was insufficient to uphold the imminent danger prerequisite, the court did not decide the 
issue of whether the petitioner was a victim of abuse. (Petitioner was strangled by respondent in 
the  late  1990s  when  they  lived  together,  and  argued  that  the  FAPA  tolling  provision  applied; 
respondent argued that ORS 12.140 applied.) 

emingway v. Mauer, 247 Or App 603 (2012) 

Wife and Husband, in the process of dissolution, were disputing the child custody provisions. Wife 
obtained a FAPA restraining order against Husband after he threatened to kill her over the phone 
and, on another day, struck the hood of her car. Husband denied ever threatening to kill Wife. At 
the  FAPA  hearing,  a  DHS  social  worker  was  allowed  to  testify  against  Husband;  however, 
Husband, appearing pro se, was not allowed to cross-examine the social worker. The trial court 
continued the restraining order and temporarily ordered Husband not to have any contact with 
their children. Husband asked the trial court if he could ask the social worker questions, but the 
judge  told  him  “You  know  what,  we  ran  out  of  time,  can’t  do  it.”  Husband  appealed,  now 
represented by counsel, arguing the trial court abused its discretion when it did not allow him to 
cross-examine the DHS social worker. The Oregon Court of Appeals agreed with the husband, 
vacated the order continuing the restraining order, and remanded to the trial court. 

he court cited Howell-Hooyman and Hooyman,113 Or App 548 (1992), concluding that a trial 
court has the authority to reasonably control the presentation of evidence and the examination of

witnesses – but this authority is only reasonable if it is fundamentally fair and allows opportunities 
for a reasonably complete presentation of evidence and argument. At the hearing, the trial court 
allowed the DHS social worker to make a statement, which appeared to affect the court’s decision 
in favor of the wife. Husband was denied a “fundamentally fair” hearing when he was not allowed 
to cross-examine the social worker.

tate v. Trivitt, 247 Or App 199 (2011) 

Defendant was appealing a contempt of court conviction for violating a restraining order. The court 
found that Defendant’s behavior did not fall under the definition of “interfering” contained in the 
statute. 

hile the FAPA order was in effect, Defendant went to Petitioner’s current girlfriend’s home and 
placed a small sign at the end of the current girlfriend’s driveway. The sign read: “[Petitioner] has 
Genital Herpes[.] He won’t tell you unless he has an outbreak[.] Ask his ex-wife she lives just up 
the street.” The trial court found that Defendant had violated the restraining order “beyond any 
doubt.”  However,  Defendant  contended  that  the  restraining  order  did  not  prohibit  her  from 
communicating with the current girlfriend or going to the current girlfriend’s residence. 

he State argued that Defendant’s behavior was an attempt to “interfere” with Petitioner through 
a third party. The court examined the definition of “interfere” and agreed with Defendant that the 
purpose of a FAPA restraining order is to protect a victim from further abuse, and that Defendant’s 
conduct, analyzed within the context of the statute, was simply “offensive.” The court noted that 
the  legislative  history  indicated  that  the  word  “bother”  had  been  left  out  of  the  statute,  and 
suggested that Defendant’s behavior fell more squarely under that definition. 

olbert v. Noon, 245 Or App 328 (2011) 

n Holbert, Respondent told Petitioner, numerous times, that he would kill her if she “took [his] 
children and left.” Respondent also sent several text messages, including “you f----- up bad this 
time, I won’t rest and neither will my resources,” and “one chance to set it right. No guy friends, 
no Wal-Mart, no cell phone, no old friends. Think hard if you want your life back and what you’re 
willing  to  sacrifice for  it. No  more  games.  Last  shot  or  it’s  all  over  and  not  just  us.”  (Emphasis 
added). 

irst, the court provided a brief summary of the proper standard of review for FAPA cases – the 
court is bound by the trial court’s finding of facts that are supported by any evidence in the record. 
A request to review a matter de novo must be requested pursuant to ORAP 5.40(8)(a) and should 
reference ORS 19.415(3)(b). 

ext, the court focused on the interpretation of “imminent bodily injury”. See ORS 107.705(1)(b), 
defining “abuse”. Respondent alleged that Petitioner could not be in fear of imminent bodily injury 
using  the  totality  of  the  circumstances.  The  Respondent’s  counsel  relied  entirely  on  how  the 
Oregon  Court  of  Appeals  construed  the  word  ‘imminent’  in  a  juvenile  delinquency  case, 
Dompelling  v.  Dompelling.  171 Or  App  692 (2000).  In  Dompelling,  “imminent”  was defined  as, 
“near  at  hand,”  “impending,”  or “menacingly  near.”  The  court  concluded that this  interpretation 
was appropriate for FAPA cases. Additionally, the court of appeals reviewed how it had construed

“imminent”  in  previous  FAPA  cases,  concluding  the  totality  of  the  circumstances  may  be 
considered when interpreting “imminent bodily injury”. See Lefebvre v. Lefebvre, 165 Or App 297 
(2000)  and  Cottongim  v.  Woods,  145  Or  App  40  (1996).  Viewed  in  the  totality  of  the 
circumstances, the multiple  death threats  and  text messages  were enough  to show  obsessive 
conduct  and  threats  towards  the  Petitioner.  The  court  of  appeals  also  included  a  “practical 
observation”  that  if  they  adopted  Respondent’s  argument,  an  estranged  spouse  could  tell  the 
other “I’m going to kill you tomorrow” or “If you get custody, you’re dead” and that would not be 
enough for a FAPA restraining order. “We would be sponsoring a parade of horribles . . . [w]e 
decline to do so.”

ubbell v. Sanders, 245 Or App 321 (2011) 

In  Hubbell,  after  their  relationship  had  ended,  Respondent  was  frequently  seen  in  Petitioner’s 
neighborhood and at one point arrested after he was found intoxicated in Petitioner’s back yard. 
After the Petitioner obtained an ex parte FAPA order, Respondent chased her, at high speeds, in 
his  car.  Respondent  challenged  that  there  was  sufficient  evidence  of  ‘imminent  danger’  even 
though he admitted his actions were ‘creepy’. The court of appeals disagreed, concluding that the 
Petitioner was in fear of imminent bodily injury and upheld the FAPA restraining order. 

he court cited Lefebvre, saying overt threats or physical violence are not required to establish a 
fear  of  imminent  bodily  injury.  “For  example,  behavior  that  is  ‘erratic,  intrusive,  volatile,  and 
persistent’ conduct combined with an ‘obsession with the idea of killing another person’ may place 
a Petitioner in ‘fear of imminent serious bodily injury and in immediate danger of further abuse’.” 
Lefebvre v. Lefebvre, 165 Or App 297, 301-02 (2000). “Fear of imminent serious bodily injury” 
can  be  established  by  the  totality  of  the  circumstances.  Fielder  and  Fielder,  211  Or  App  688 
(2007). If a Petitioner makes a subjective claim of fear, there must be sufficient evidence that the 
conduct creates an imminent fear of further abuse. Roshto v. McVein, 207 Or App 700, 704-05 
(2006). 

he  court  labeled  Respondent’s  behavior  as  “chilling”  and  there  was  sufficient  evidence 
establishing  Petitioner  was  in  imminent  danger  of  further  abuse  by  Respondent.  The  same 
evidence also showed Respondent’s actions were credible threat to Petitioner's physical safety. 
Therefore, the court upheld the FAPA restraining order against Respondent. 

acomano v. Burns, 245 Or App 35 (2011) 

Petitioner and Respondent began a sexual relationship after Respondent swore to Petitioner she 
did  not  have  any  sexually  transmitted  diseases.  Their  relationship  ended  after  Respondent 
contracted genital herpes. Petitioner then admitted she had genital herpes. Later, Respondent 
discovered  that  Petitioner  was  using  a  “swingers”  website  and  not  disclosing  her  disease. 
Respondent  sent  Petitioner  several  text  messages,  essentially  threatening  to  inform  her  other 
sexual partners and co-workers that she had genital herpes and that “[her] payback is coming 
soon.” Petitioner filed for a restraining order, which was granted by the trial court. 

he Oregon Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that text messages sent by Respondent do 
not qualify as “abuse” that would support a restraining order under FAPA. See ORS 107.705(1). 
The  court  decided  that  sending  a  text  message, threatening  to tell  others  that  one  has  genital 
herpes and “your payback is coming soon” did not meet the requirements for FAPA; specifically, 
there  was  no  threat  of  physical  violence  that  could  have  placed  Petitioner  in  fear  of  imminent 
bodily injury.

affey v. Muchka, 244 Or App 308 (2011) 

Petitioner and Respondent were in an 18-month relationship and the parents of a young child. 
Respondent has post-traumatic stress disorder, which causes him to occasionally act in a highly 
emotional manner, becoming “extremely angry” over “very small, little things.” Respondent was 
also “extremely controlling” and had limited Petitioner’s ability to access her money and contact 
other people. Respondent had made verbal threats to Petitioner, telling her that he could make 
her life “a living hell” and that he would take their child away from Petitioner “not because I want 
him  but  because  I’m  going  to  take  what  you  love  most.”  Respondent  had  previously  pushed 
Petitioner  into  a  wall  in  2009.  In  2010,  Petitioner  was  preparing  an  Easter  dinner  when 
Respondent became angry and swore at Petitioner. Respondent pushed Petitioner against a wall 
told her to leave. Respondent became “eerily calm” and walked away, which he had previously 
told  Petitioner  was  an  indication  that  he  was  about to  become  violent.  Petitioner  and the  child 
moved  out,  eventually  to  a  safe  house,  and  a  temporary  FAPA  restraining  order  was  issued 
against Respondent. Respondent violated that order by going near the safe house and having a 
friend call Petitioner. The trial court continued the FAPA restraining order against the Respondent. 

he Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court, finding that the Petitioner 
had presented sufficient evidence, which was essentially not disputed, to support continuation of 
a restraining order under FAPA. The Court of Appeals provided a straight forward explanation of 
ORS  107.718(1).  Respondent  argued  that  Petitioner  had  failed  to  prove  that  he  had  either 
committed abuse or that there was an imminent danger of further abuse; however, the Court of 
Appeals quickly dismissed this argument, concluding under ORS 107.705(1)(a) and (b) “a person 
can  commit  ‘abuse,’  .  .  .  even  if  the  person  does  not  actually  cause  bodily  injury.”  Petitioner’s 
testimony was completely credible; therefor there was sufficient evidence of abuse and imminent 
danger that Respondent would abuse Petitioner again. 

tate v. Cervantes, 238 Or App 745 (2010) 

Defendant  was  charged  with  contempt  for  violating  a  Family  Abuse  Prevention  Act  restraining 
order.  The  trial  court  permitted  defendant  to  represent  himself,  but  it  did  so  without  first 
determining  whether  defendant’s  waiver  of  his  right  to  counsel  was  voluntary,  knowing,  and 
intelligent. This omission was legal error requiring reversal. 

ravis & Travis, 236 Or App 563 (2010) 

In a modification of custody case in which the trial court had changed custody to Father, the Court 
of Appeals reviewing the record de novo disagreed with the trial court’s determination that Mother 
was unfit due to abuse of the legal process (not related to the FAPA case) and false accusations 
resulting in police incidents. The Court of Appeals noted that the children were absent from these 
scenes  of  police  involvement  and  no  evidence  existed  of  detriment  to  the  children  from  these 
incidents. The appellate court also noted that mother had obtained a FAPA order against Father, 
thereby establishing a rebuttable presumption that it is not in the best interests and welfare of the 
child to award custody to Father. Because the other statutory factors weighed in favour of Mother, 
the Court did not decide whether the presumption had been rebutted. 

artinez v. Martinez, 234 Or App 289 (2010) 

Without explaining how the evidence was insufficient, the court held petitioner had not shown by 
a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  respondent  committed  abuse,  as  defined  in  ORS 
107.705(1) against petitioner within 180 days preceding the filing of the petition.

avon v. Miano, 232 Or App 533 (2009) 

Respondent  did  not  preserve for  appeal  the  argument  that  the  circuit  court  lacked  authority to 
include custody and parenting time restrictions in the restraining order. His request-for-hearing 
form  conveyed to  petitioner  and to  the trial  court  that  he  did  not  contest the parts  of the  order 
granting  child  custody  to  the  petitioner  or the terms  of the  parenting  time  order.  Moreover,  his 
factual assertion at trial that petitioner took the children does not place the custody provision at 
issue. Finally, his mere assertion of the claim that petitioner was not a biological parent does not, 
by itself, preserve challenges predicated on petitioner's legal relationship to the children. 

eismandel-Sullivan and Sullivan, 228 Or App 41 (2009) 

Entry of a FAPA order against a respondent after an ex parte appearance by petitioner did not 
constitute  a  finding  of  abuse  sufficient  to  trigger  ORS  107.137(2)  presumption  that  awarding 
custody to respondent was presumptively not in the best interests of the children. No hearing was 
held on the FAPA order because the parties reached a temporary settlement prior to a dissolution 
proceeding and petitioner agreed to vacate the restraining order as a part of that settlement. 

ingler and Ringler, 221 Or App 43 (2008), distinguished by Weismandel-Sullivan, 

supra. 
Mother’s FAPA order against father that was upheld at a contested hearing at which father was 
represented by counsel established the ORS 107.137(2) presumption that it was not in the best 
interests of the children to award custody to the father. Evidence presented at trial was insufficient 
to rebut the presumption.

Merely  accidental  conduct  was  not  wilful  violation  of  a  restraining  order  to  sustain  a  contempt 
action. 

aker v. Baker, 216 Or App 205 (2007) 

Where petitioner testifies that the respondent had not threatened him and there was no evidence 
he was afraid of her when applying for the restraining order or at the time of the hearing, there 
was not sufficient proof of imminent danger of further abuse to uphold an order. 

tate v. Dragowsky, 215 Or App 377 (2007), rev denied 343 Or 690 (2007) 

The  Defendant’s  conviction  for  willfully  entering  or  attempting  to  enter  within  150  feet  of  the 
petitioner was upheld in this contempt case. The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to 
the State and the trial court’s findings that the Defendant was not credible allow a reasonable trier 
to disbelieve the Defendant’s testimony that the victim attacked him and caused him to fall on top 
of  her.  Evidence  was  sufficient  to  support  a  finding  that  after  discovering  the  victim  in  his 
residence, the Defendant approached and assaulted her, thereby willfully entering an area that 
he was prohibited from entering by the restraining order. 

tate v. Maxwell, 213 Or App 162 (2007) 

Defendant was charged with burglary and assault for unlawfully entering and remaining in victim’s 
home and assaulting her. Victim had obtained a FAPA restraining order against Defendant, and 
the court held that even if she had invited him into her house, because the FAPA order prohibited 
him from doing so, any invitation by her was unlawful and could not give defendant license to do 
so. Burglary conviction was upheld.

Petitioner was not in fear of imminent bodily injury, where petitioner did not show that respondent 
made threats that put him in imminent fear. Threats were made to petitioner in November 2005 
that respondent’s brother would “kick his ass.” Restraining order was sought in April 2006, after 
an incident where any threats made by respondent were only to petitioner’s girlfriend. The court 
did not address whether threats against a third party (petitioner’s girlfriend) could sustain an order. 

iedler and Fielder, 211 Or App 688 (2007) 

The Family Abuse Prevention Act does not require the petitioner to prove subjective fear when 
the  claim  of  abuse  is  the  respondent’s  “intentionally,  knowingly  or  recklessly  placing  [the 
petitioner]  in  fear  of  imminent  bodily  injury.”  Cottongim,  below.  Nor  are  overt  threats  required. 
Lefebvre,  below.  The  test  is  whether  a  reasonable  person  faced  with  the  described  behavior 
would be placed in fear. Here an incident in which an apparently intoxicated respondent kicked 
and punched petitioner and an additional situation in which she struck petitioner sufficiently hard 
to  cause  a  black  eye  meet  the  articulated  threshold  under  a  totality  of  circumstances. 
Furthermore, the requirement of imminent danger of further abuse is satisfied by the evidence of 
direct and ongoing physical abuse correlated to respondent’s alcohol consumption. 

tate ex rel DHS v. L.S. and J.L.W., 211 Or App 221 (2007) 

This termination of parental rights case finds insufficient the State’s claims that the father is unfit 
due in part to his history of criminal convictions and FAPA orders obtained by three of his former 
domestic  partners.  Noting  father’s  engagement  in  anger  management  and  domestic  violence 
education programs and the lack of evidence that he had participated in any violent or abusive 
conduct  since  DHS  became  involved  with  the  family  more  than  3  years  earlier,  the  Court  of 
Appeals found that he had sufficiently adjusted his behavior. The opinion addresses and finds 
lacking other claims regarding unfitness. 

agyar v. Hayes, 211 Or App 86 (2007) 

This  case  involved  the  sufficiency  of  evidence  needed  to  uphold  a  stalking  protective  order 
between an unmarried couple litigating claims to their jointly owned real property. The Court of 
Appeals  found  that  the  existence  of  a  FAPA  order  between  the  parties  not  relevant  for  two 
reasons: 

1) the FAPA order had been issued for the protection of the stalking order respondent [X] rather 
than the stalking order applicant [Y] and (2) although the original FAPA order had ordered X to 
vacate certain jointly-owned property, the effect of a modifying FAPA order almost one year after 
the FAPA order was first issued was merely to reflect the ruling of a separate domestic relations 
court that Y was the sole owner of that property. The modification action was not a renewal of the 
FAPA order as X had made no renewal request and the court made no findings necessary for 
renewal. The modification order therefore did not extend the effective date of the original FAPA 
order past its original one-year duration so no FAPA order existed at the point X entered the home 
in a manner Y asserts caused him reasonable apprehension for his personal safety. 

osiles-Flores v. Browning, 208 Or App 600 (2006) 

Petitioner’s  sworn  allegations  (in  petition  for  restraining  order),  along  with  her  personal 
appearance at an ex parte hearing, satisfied the statutory requirements for obtaining an ex parte 
restraining  order  under  FAPA.  The  existence  of  a  restraining  order  by  respondent  against 
petitioner  was  not  a  proper  basis  for  denying  petitioner  a  restraining  order,  and  the  text  and 
context of FAPA support the opposite conclusion. Each party must separately establish his or her 
eligibility for a FAPA order.

The petitioner need only make a “showing” that she has met the requirements for issuance of a 
FAPA  order  at  the  ex  parte  hearing.  Because  the  allegations  in  the  petition  are  sworn,  they 
constitute evidence in support of the “showing” requirement. If, at the end of the ex parte hearing, 
there are no un-remedied deficiencies in the petition or contradictions between the petition and 
the petitioner’s testimony, the trial court lacks discretion to deny the petition and “shall” issue the 
requested order. 

oshto v. McVein, 207 Or App 700 (2006) 

An  “inundation”  of  email  and  telephone  messages,  plus  several  uninvited  visits  to  petitioner’s 
house, did not amount to a credible threat to her safety. Without threats of physical harm or actual 
physical  harm, the  behavior  was  not  enough to uphold  a  restraining  order,  despite  petitioner’s 
knowledge that respondent was “on medication,” had “mental problems,” and had erratic behavior 
such as leaving beef jerky in the yard for her dogs to eat and asking institutions to send her junk 
mail. This case was distinguished from LeFebvre v. LeFebvre, 165 Or App 297 (2000) because 
of  the  imminence  of  the  threat  and  the  credibility  of  respondent’s  behavior,  Lefebvre  involved 
behavior that was “more heightened, persistent, and alarming.” 

ooler v. Pooler, 206 Or App 447 (2006) 

Mother’s  unchallenged  testimony  about  father’s prior  abuse,  including  violence  in  front  of their 
children, imposed on the court a duty to put adequate safeguards in place. Where a parent has 
“committed abuse, the court shall make adequate provision for the safety of the child.” 

dwards v. Biehler, 203 Or App 271 (2005) 

The  Legislature  intended  that  the  criteria  for  terminating  unlimited  duration  Stalking  Protective 
Orders  be  similar  to  the  criteria  for  removing  FAPA  orders.  This  conclusion  is  based  on  the 
analogous nature of SPO and FAPA orders (both statutory schemes are directed at similar harms 
and  address  those  harms  through  entry  of  orders  requiring,  among  other  things,  that  the 
respondent  avoid  contact  with  the  petitioner)  and  the  practical  application  FAPA  termination 
procedures have for SPOs. Furthermore, legislative history supports the inference that legislators 
anticipated the terminability of unlimited SPOs. An SPO may be terminated on the respondent’s 
motion  when  the  Court  finds  that  the  petitioner  no  longer  continues  to  suffer  reasonable 
apprehension based on the respondent’s past acts. 

ilson and Wilson, 199 Or App 242 (2005) 

In  Father’s  suit  under  ORS  109.119  for  custody  of  Mother’s  non-joint  child,  Father  did  not 
overcome presumption favoring Mother as legal parent. Father alleged, among other factors, that 
Mother unreasonably denied or limited his contact with the non-joint child by obtaining a Family 
Abuse  Prevention  Act  order  that  alleged  physical  abuse  by  Father’s  cohabitant-girlfriend  and 
prohibited his parenting time until the child was interviewed by a child abuse team in a few days, 
after  which  point  unsupervised  contact  could  occur.  Father  ended  up  with  no  contact  for  one 
month. The Court found Mother’s actions reasonable given that she had acted out of concern for 
the safety of the children and had intended the restriction to be resolved in a matter of days. 

ousing and Community Services Agency of Lane County v. Long, 196 Or App 205

Defendant  prevailed  against  Housing  Agency that  was  attempting  to  evict  him for violating  his 
lease by failing to disclose that Defendant’s Wife was residing with him when not listed on lease 
(and was not just a guest). Defendant argued successfully that Agency had accepted rent while 
knowing  that  Wife  was  residing  with  Defendant,  and  therefore  had  waived  its  claim  of  lease 
violation.  Agency  argued  unsuccessfully  that  it  had  only  a  suspicion  Wife  resided  there  until

Agency obtained copy of Wife’s affidavit in support of FAPA order, which affidavit alleged the co-
residence. Agency’s position failed because Agency accepted at rent for at least 2 rental periods 
after its receipt of the affidavit, which is the minimum standard for such waiver under ORS 90.415. 

ergerson v. Salem-Keizer School District, 194 Or App 301 (2004), review accepted, 

337 Or 616 (2004) 
Fair Dismissal Appeals Board’s reasoning was insufficient to support its determination reversing 
the dismissal of a third-grade teacher on grounds of immorality and neglect of duties. The Court 
found  that  the  Board  did  not  explain  why  dismissal  was  clearly  an  excessive  remedy  for  an 
isolated incident in which depressed Wife, after ingesting medication in a suicide attempt after 
emotional confrontation with her estranged Husband, drove her vehicle into the back of his pick- 
up truck at his girlfriend’s home where he was living and pushed it into the garage. The Court was 
unpersuaded, among other things, with the Board’s notion that crimes committed against family 
members  are  less  serious  than  crimes  committed  against  strangers.  The  Court  noted  that 
teacher/Wife had damaged house of Husband’s girlfriend (who was not a family member), that 
the incident regarding Husband was likely subject to FAPA law and mandatory arrest, and that 
the Oregon  criminal  code  provided  an  enhanced  penalty for  assaults  against  family  members. 
Case was remanded to Appeals Board for further proceedings. 

ajka v. Maher, 192 Or App 173 (2004) 

At  hearing  in  which  Respondent  contested  FAPA  restraining  order,  undisputed  evidence  that 
Respondent assaulted Petitioner causing injury, for which Respondent was immediately arrested, 
and threatened both Petitioner and her husband, implying he had found someone to kill them, 
satisfied requirements for continuation of the restraining order. 

rady v. Frady, 185 Or App 245 (2002) 

Although the trial court erred in taking judicial notice of the contents of the return of service of the 
restraining order, this error was harmless, as the document was otherwise admissible under OEC 
803(8)(b).  Because  service  of  the  order  and  the  reporting  of  that  service  were  routine,  non- 
adversarial  matters,  the  exclusion  from  the  official  records  exception  for  matters  observed  by 
police officers was inapplicable. Based on the return of service, the trial court was entitled to find 
beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant was served with the restraining order and to infer that 
Defendant’s violation of the order was knowing.

tate v. Bachman, 171 Or App 665 (2000) 

Prosecution  for  violation  of  a  restraining  order  must  take  place  in  the  county  that  issued  the 
restraining  order.  In  this  case,  Defendant  was  subject  to  a  restraining  order  issued  by  the 
Multnomah County Court. Defendant violated the order in a different county. The issuing county 
asserted venue for the prosecution, and Defendant appealed the denial of his motion to dismiss 
for improper venue. 

he  Court  of  Appeals  decided  the  case  on  statutory  construction  and  on  state  constitutional 
grounds, and affirmed the trial court’s decision. The Court held that the sanctions for contempt 
are to provide legal teeth for enforcement of court orders and not to replace criminal sanctions. 
Criminal contempt is not a criminal prosecution within the meaning of Article I, Section II of the 
Oregon Constitution. Contempt is a violation of a court order, and the court that issued the order 
has the power to impose sanctions upon the defendant for violations.

Expert  testimony  concerning  battered  women’s  syndrome  (BWS),  offered  to  buttress  victim’s 
credibility by providing an alternative explanation for her behavior in continuing to see defendant, 
was  irrelevant  and  inadmissible  in  prosecution  for  coercion,  where  state  did  not  establish  that 
victim herself suffered from BWS. 

eFebvre v. LeFebvre, 165 Or App 297 (2000) 

The  “totality  of  the  circumstances”  may  be  considered  in  support  of  Petitioner’s  assertion  that 
Respondent has recklessly placed her in fear of imminent serious bodily injury and that she is in 
immediate danger of further abuse. “Remote” behavior (behavior which took place outside FAPA’s 
jurisdictional window) is part of a “factual context” that may be considered in upholding a FAPA 
order, even if the remote behavior did not consist of physical violence or the threat of violence 
towards Petitioner. 

n this case, the court considered the totality of the circumstances to uphold the issuance of a 
restraining order even though Petitioner alleged no actual or overtly threatened physical violence 
on the part of Respondent. The court considered the facts that within the six months preceding 
the filing of the petition, Respondent had screamed obscenities at Petitioner in child’s presence, 
barricaded Petitioner out of her house, telephoned Petitioner’s friends to tell disparaging stories 
about  her,  made  numerous  hang  up  phone  calls  to  Petitioner’s  home,  rummaged  through 
Petitioner’s  possessions,  and  called  her  late  at  night  to  accurately  describe  the  clothes  he 
observed her wearing as he lurked outside her home. The court considered this information in 
light of Petitioner’s testimony that Respondent had access to guns and that, nine years earlier, 
Respondent had been obsessed with the idea of killing his former employer. 

he court upheld the issuance of the restraining order despite the fact that there was no history 
of  physical  or  overtly  threatened  abuse  between  the  parties  because  the  totality  of  the 
circumstances  and  the  ominous  factual  context  (taking  into  account  both  recent  and  remote 
behavior) supported Petitioner’s assertion that Respondent had recklessly placed her in fear of 
imminent serious bodily injury and in immediate danger of further abuse.

Note: Although the Court seemed to consider the remote behavior as relevant to both the issue 
of whether Respondent placed Petitioner in fear of imminent serious bodily injury and to the issue 
of  whether  Petitioner  was  in  immediate  danger  of  further  abuse,  it  summed  up  its  decision  by 
saying only that remote behavior was relevant to the issue of whether Petitioner was in immediate 
danger of further abuse. 

eusel v. Multnomah County District Attorney’s Office, 163 Or App 51 (1999) 

Boyfriend  brought  claims  for  false  imprisonment  and  negligence  against  the  district  attorney’s 
office after he was arrested on a warrant for violation of a restraining order issued on behalf of his 
former girlfriend. The warrant was issued by the court upon the deputy district attorney’s mistaken 
representation  that  the  restraining  order  had  not  expired  at  the  time  of  the  abuser’s  purported 
violation. The victim told the district attorney that the “violation” had occurred just after she had 
renewed  her  restraining  order.  In  fact,  the  victim  had  not  renewed  the  restraining  order.  The 
boyfriend was arrested. The court ruled that the district attorney’s applying for a warrant upon the 
mistaken belief that there had been a violation amounted to an “erroneous exercise of jurisdiction” 
and not a “total absence of jurisdiction” and therefore did not deprive the district attorney’s office 
of total immunity from negligence and false imprisonment claims brought by Boyfriend. 

oldt v. Boldt, 155 Or App 244 (1998) 

*ORS  107.710  (2)  (1999)  overruled  Boldt.  The  requisite  burden  of  proof  is  now  a 
preponderance  of  the  evidence.  Also  see  ORS  107.718  (1)  (1999)  requiring  that 
Petitioner show the imminent danger of further abuse, rather than the previously 
required “immediate and present danger of further abuse.” 
In  addition  to  showing  that  Respondent  “abused”  Petitioner  within  the  meaning  of  the  Family 
Abuse Prevention Act, the Petitioner must show that she is in immediate and present danger of 
further  abuse.  This  showing  must  be  made  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence  given  the 
extraordinary nature of injunctive relief. Petitioner did not meet this burden where there was no 
evidence that Petitioner feared a repetition of the conduct in question or that it was part of a cycle 
of abuse likely to repeat and from which she could not extricate herself. 

he facts of this case involved a relationship between a Russian immigrant and a respondent with 
whom she engaged in physically painful but consensual sexual acts throughout their marriage. In 
light of the holding on imminent danger, the court declined to address the question of whether 
and when consensual conduct may constitute abuse under the FAPA statute. The court stated 
that it was not prepared to declare that consensual pain-inflicting conduct necessarily constituted 
abuse,  but  noted  that  “notions  of  consent,  agreement,  or  mutuality  must  be  approached  with 
particular care  in  domestic  contexts”  given  the  “complicated  emotional  dynamics that  preclude 
free choice and voluntary behavior” 

ogh and McRill, 153 Or App 159 (1998) 

In  this  action  involving  a  real  estate  partnership,  the  Petitioner’s  obtaining  of  a  Family  Abuse 
Prevention Act restraining order ousting Respondent from their home constituted breach of that 
agreement where the Petitioner lacked sufficient cause for the restraining order. (The FAPA order 
was continued for 60 days at the contest hearing without objection by the respondent and then 
dismissed by apparent stipulation of the parties.) Regardless of whether the trial court improperly 
applied  claim  preclusion  by  excluding  evidence  of  the  facts  behind  the  restraining  order,  a  de 
novo review of the record of the FAPA proceedings supports the conclusion that petitioner lacked 
sufficient  cause  for  the  order  and  thus  materially  breached  the  agreement  by  the  “eviction.” 
Because Respondent incurred motel expenses as a direct result of Petitioner’s breach, an award 
for those damages is proper.

erlack v. Roberts, 152 Or App 40 (1998) 

“No contact within 150 feet” requirement in this restraining order followed language referring to 
listed types of premises (home, school, business, place of employment, Copperlight bar, etc.) and 
therefore should not be read as preventing Defendant from coming within 150 feet of Petitioner 
at  any  location.  The  provision  corresponds  to  ORS  107.718(1)(g)  allowing  restraining  from 
entering any premises and reasonable area surround the premises, and contempt can lie only for 
violation of what the order prohibits. Defendant’s conviction for being in video store at same time 
Petitioner was, when Defendant said nothing to her, did not look or stare at her, left after she did 
without any contact with her, and did not discuss her presence with his passenger afterward must 
be reversed. Nor on these facts did Defendant interfere with, menace, or molest Petitioner. 

brist v. Harmon, 150 Or App 173 (1997) 

Where  vacation  of  Petitioner’s  restraining  order  is  due  to  her  failure  to  appear  at  the  contest 
hearing,  issue  preclusion  does  not  bar  a  subsequent  petition  based  on  the  same  facts.  The 
vacation was not a final decision on the merits of the first petition. 

or does claim preclusion bar the second petition when defendant does not argue that the order 
of vacation is a final judgment and no other record from the first proceeding is provided. When 
the parties’ testimony is irreconcilable on the question of whether Respondent struck Petitioner 
and each party offers witnesses providing some support, the issue turns on the credibility of the 
parties. Great reliance is placed on the trial court’s determination of credibility in this circumstance, 
even on de novo review, and the implicit finding favoring petitioner will not be disturbed on this 
record. 

xclusion of testimony from Respondent’s eight-year-old daughter was error where the Petitioner 
did  not  object  and  the  offer  of  proof  indicated  the  relevance  of  the  evidence  in  possibly 
undermining Petitioner’s testimony and touching on issues of self-defense. 

ottongim v. Woods, 145 Or App 40 (1996) 

Expiration of Family Abuse Prevention Act restraining order during pendency of appeal does not 
render  appeal  moot  when  Respondent's  career  may  be  impaired  by  the  judgment,  even  if  no 
evidence  is  offered  of  actual  consequence.  Respondent  was  a  second  year  law  student  and 
commissioned  military  officer;  restraining  order  judgment  could  call  into  question  his  fitness  to 
practice law or be suggestive of unlawful conduct. 

vidence  is  sufficient  to  support  a  FAPA  restraining  order  when  Respondent  became  verbally 
abusive after consuming alcohol; entered her home against her expressed wishes after they broke 
up, holding her down on the couch and trying to kiss her, leaving bruises on her arms; telephoned 
her repeatedly, once stating that he could not live without her and if he were going to die, she 
should too; stated he would do anything he could to make her life hell; sent her letter stating he 
despised her and wished her a long, slow, painful death; and harassed her at new boyfriend's 
home by repeatedly phoning and buzzing the intercom. Reasonable person would be "placed in 
fear  of  imminent  serious  bodily  harm"  and  face  an  "immediate  and  present  danger  of  further 
abuse."

State ex rel Langehennig v. Long, 142 Or App 486 (1996) 
A Family Abuse Prevention Act restraining order is not a "no contact" order unless a specific term 
prohibiting contact is included. Mere contact is not otherwise a violation. [Import not discernible 
from per curiam decision but from State's concession in brief of insufficient evidence]. 

elson v. Nelson, 142 Or App 367 (1996) 

Under ORS 107.718(8), a party contesting a restraining order is entitled to a full hearing on the 
merits as provided in Miller v. Miller, 128 Or App 433 (1994). Respondent argued that the court 
denied her such a full hearing by (1) not allowing her to introduce evidence and (2) by only briefly 
questioning the husband/petitioner as to the truthfulness of his allegations. However, wife had not 
made an offer of proof concerning testimony the judge disallowed in an off-record discussion in 
chambers, and did not clarify this ruling adequately on the record, so the record is insufficient to 
show error. 

etfeld v. Bostwick, 136 Or App 305 (1995) 

Ex-Wife's interference with ex-husband's visitation rights, encouragement of children calling their 
father by his first name, changing the children's last names, and insulting him did not constitute 
the tortuous intentional infliction of emotional distress because this conduct aimed at estranging 
the  father  from  his  children  is  not  an  "extraordinary  transgression  of  the  bounds  of  socially 
tolerable conduct." In substantiating the "prevalence of such conduct" by the ex-wife, the court 
cited the existence of the Family Abuse Prevention Act. If there is a statute, which responds to 
such conduct, the court reasoned that the conduct must not be that outrageous. 

earson and Pearson, 136 Or App 20 (1995) 

Court's  failure  to  warn  alleged  restraining  order  contemnor  of  the  risks  and  difficulties  of  self-
representation warrants reversal of contempt adjudication. 

trother and Strother, 130 Or App 624 (1994) 

An  order  entered  after  a  twenty-one-day  hearing  under  the  Family  Abuse  Prevention  Act  is 
appealable. The standard of review is de novo. 

Immediate danger" can be proven by respondent's calling victim "incredibly stupid" where similar 
statements usually preceded battering during the marriage. It was not error to hold the hearing 
more than 21 days after the Respondent's request where he had affidavited the judge, his attorney 
was unavailable for numerous alternate hearing dates, and the Respondent did not object to the 
delay before or during the hearing. 

ven though unsupervised visitation was ordered in a California divorce, monitored contact may 
be ordered in a Family Abuse Prevention Act case where police contact, alcohol, and the child's 
fears  are  present.  (Decision  did  not mention  any  UCCJA  issues  and  instead  summarily stated 
that the FAPA statute gives the court the power to order temporary visitation.) 

iller and Miller, 128 Or App 433 (1994) 

Contested hearings under the Family Abuse Prevention Act are similar to trials and parties have 
the right to be heard and have legal and factual issues determined. A respondent must be allowed 
to call witnesses. 

The opinion rejects without discussion two other assignments of error made by Respondent, the 
substance of which are identifiable only from the briefs: (1) abuse occurring before 180 days may 
not be considered in evaluating current fear and (2) a protective order prohibiting the deposition

tate v. Delker, 123 Or App 129 (1993) 

Double  jeopardy  is  not  implicated  after  contempt  adjudication  (for  presence  at  Petitioner's 
residence) is followed by criminal prosecution for arson. The charges have different elements and 
are not part of a continuous, uninterrupted course of conduct. 

yle and Pyle, 111 Or App 184 (1992) 

Under former contempt statutes, a defendant in Family Abuse Prevention Act contempt waives 
objections  to  imprecise  allegations  in  the  show  cause  affidavit  when  he  neither  demurs  under 
ORS 135.610 nor moves to make them more definite and certain. 

f a court of equity has subject-matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction over the parties, it may 
mandate or prohibit actions inside or outside the state. Thus telephonic harassment initiated when 
both the Petitioner and Respondent were out of state was properly enjoinable and thus properly 
contemptible. 

efley v. Pefley, 107 Or App 243 (1991) 

Under  the  former  contempt  statutes,  contempt orders  entered  in  Family  Abuse  Prevention  Act 
cases must be vacated when the trial court failed to make findings of the defendant's bad faith. 

tate v. Stolz, 106 Or App 144 (1991) 

The violation of a restraining order (for failure to leave premises) and resisting arrest are not the 
"same criminal episode" within the meaning of ORS 131.515(2), which bar two prosecutions the 
"same act or transaction." 

tate ex rel Emery v. Andisha, 105 Or App 473 (1991) 

A  father  who  telephones  his  14-year-old  step-son  to  tell  him  the  mother/petitioner  is  sick  and 
needs  mental  help  and  that  the  father  wants  to  meet  with  the  boy  has  acted  in  violation  of  a 
restraining  order  prohibiting  him  from  molesting,  interfering,  or  menacing  the  mother  and  her 
children. The prohibited conduct is not so vague that a reasonable person could not understand. 
The plain and ordinary meanings of "molest," "interfere," and "menace" apply. 

tate ex rel Delisser v. Hardy, 89 Or App 508 (1988) 

A contempt judgment under Family Abuse Prevention Act must include the statutory basis for it. 
Former  ORS  33.020  does  not  preclude  enhanced  penalties  for  violating  a  Family  Abuse 
Prevention  Act  restraining  order  when  the  conduct,  which  constitutes  the  contempt,  occurred 
before the show cause hearing. To support an enhanced penalty, however, a contempt judgment 
under  the  Family  Abuse  Prevention  Act  must  contain  the  court's  findings  of  fact  respecting 
defendant's contemptuous conduct that defeated or prejudiced plaintiff's right or remedy. 

tate v. Steinke, 88 Or App 626 (1987) 

Police officer, who received report of abuse prevention restraining order violation and saw a car 
matching  the  description  in  the  report  near  the  scene  of  the  reported  violation  shortly  after 
receiving the report, was justified in making an investigative stop of that vehicle. 

f a police officer has probable cause to believe that a person has violated an abuse prevention 
restraining  order,  that  officer  is  implicitly  authorized  under  ORS  133.31(3)  to  stop  that  person, 
even if it's later shown that the restraining order is invalid.

State ex rel Streit v. Streit, 72 Or App 403 (1985) 
A defendant cannot legally have been in contempt of court unless his violation of a Family Abuse 
Prevention Act restraining order was willful. Evidence that Defendant was very depressed and 
anxious about overwhelming personal problems and did not remember contacting his former wife 
is not sufficient to support a finding that his violation was willful or with bad intent. 

urks v. Lane County, 72 Or App 257 (1985) 

This case involved the question of whether state law requires a county to appropriate a particular 
funding  level  for  the  sheriff's  performance  of  law  enforcement  duties.  Plaintiff  -  sheriff  cited 
Nearing v. Weaver, supra, for his position that a "reasonable" level of funding was required by 
statute. The appellate court found that Nearing was not on point because the specific question in 
the case at hand did not involve the county's potential liability if its funding decision resulted in 
injuries attributable to the sheriff's inability to perform his duties. 

tate v. Smith, 71 Or App 205 (1984) 

This case involved an appeal from a civil commitment hearing in which the appellant argued that 
his acute and chronic alcoholism did not constitute a mental disorder within the meaning of civil 
commitment statutes. The Family Abuse Prevention Act was cited in the opinion's discussion of 
the  factual  record  below.  The  Appellant's  father  had  filed  for  a  restraining  order  under  FAPA, 
which  put  the  appellant  out  of  the  home  because  Appellant  repeatedly  fought  with,  hit,  and 
knocked down his elderly father. 

NREPORTED DECISIONS 

tate ex rel. Evans v. Phillips, Supreme Court No. S50947, ordered 12/17/03. Linn 

County 
Alternative  writ  of  mandamus  issued  compelling  compliance  with  mandatory  ex  parte  custody 
provision  of  FAPA,  or  show  cause  for  not  doing  so.  Petitioner  Danielle  Rae  Evans  had  filed  a 
FAPA action alleging that respondent R. C. Phillips, the father of the couple’s two minor children, 
had abused her. Shortly before initiating her action, petitioner had sent the children to live with 
respondent. Under the statute, upon a showing that a petitioner has been abused by a respondent 
within 180 days of instigating a FAPA complaint, a court must, if requested by the petitioner, grant 
the petitioner temporary custody of the parties’ children. In this case, although the circuit court 
found that respondent had abused petitioner, it nevertheless declined petitioner’s child custody 
request.
