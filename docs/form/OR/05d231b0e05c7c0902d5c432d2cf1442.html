Proposed by: 

Petitioner

Agreed upon by both parents 
Ordered by the Court 

IMPORTANT  NOTICE:  The  provisions  of  your  Parenting  Plan  may  have  important  legal 
consequences. You should consult the complete BASIC PARENTING PLAN GUIDE FOR PARENTS 
available at http://courts.oregon.gov/familylaw before filling out this form.  Your decisions about 
how much time the children will spend in the care of each parent may have important financial 
implications. This decision may affect how much child support a parent is responsible for, whether 
a  parent  can  claim  a  tax  dependency  deduction,  etc.  You  should  consult  an  attorney  or  your 
caseworker before filing your Parenting Plan. 

1.  GOALS FOR OUR CHILDREN 

This  plan  is  intended  to  ensure  the  children’s  optimal  development  by  providing  continuity,  stability  and 
predictability for the children, while ensuring frequent and continued contact with each parent. Because a 
written plan cannot address every possible situation that might occur, the parents will implement this plan in a 
spirit of good faith and mutual cooperation.  Parents are encouraged to re-evaluate this plan from time to time 
as their children’s needs change. 

2.  WHO OUR CHILDREN ARE ( 

additional names are listed on an attached page)

3.  WHO WE ARE 

The parents acknowledge that they remain the children’s parents at all times.  Each parent is responsible 
for providing the children with a quality experience and for acting in the children’s best interests. 

For the purposes of describing the parenting time schedule, “Parent A” is the parent who the children stay 
with more than half the time, and “Parent B” is the parent who the children stay with less than half the time. 
If the parenting time is exactly even, it does not matter who is assigned which letter.  In this document: 

Parent A is (name) 

.  Parent B is (name)

necessary medications at the scheduled time of exchange. All clothing and medications that accompanied

6.  HOW WE WILL MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT OUR CHILDREN 

IMPORTANT NOTICE: Your decision to select Joint or Sole Custody may have important legal 
consequences. You are strongly encouraged to consult with an attorney regarding these 
consequences before making your final decision about Joint or Sole Custody. 

6.1  Day-to-Day Decisions. Each parent will make day-to-day decisions regarding the care and control of 
our  children  during  the  time  they  are  caring  for  our  children.  This  includes  any  emergency  decisions 
affecting the health or safety of our children.

clubs, music, religious organizations, and social activities. Both parents are encouraged to take part in 
non-school  activities  with  their  children  during  their  parenting  time.  Non-school  activities  should  not

last resort will we resolve disputes through court action.  (Local court rules will apply after filing a court 
action)  Prior to filing any court action: (CHECK ONE)
