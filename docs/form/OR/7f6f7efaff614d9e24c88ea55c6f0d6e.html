Getting Started
What is OJD Guide and File? 

 

What do I need to use Guide and File? 

OJD Guide and File (Guide and File) is an interactive interview tool that helps you fill out court forms. 
This service is provided free by the Oregon Judicial Department (OJD) through Tyler Technologies. 

A computer or tablet with an Internet connection and an up-to-date web browser. Internet Explorer 10 
or later, Firefox 40.0 or later, Google Chrome 44.0 or later, Safari 10.8 or later. 

Some forms require specific information and documentation (such as driver’s license numbers, social 
security numbers, and addresses). The specific information depends on the kind of case you’re filing. 
The first two pages of every interview will explain what information and documentation is needed for 
the form(s). 

How do I get started? 

From the OJD Guide and File page click Start Your Legal Process. After the list of available forms 
appears, select the form you are looking for from the list. Your interview will begin immediately.  

Do I need to create an account to use Guide and File? 

No, an account is not required to fill out any of the forms. If you want to save your work or electronically 
file your documents you will need to create an account and you will need an email address to create an 
account.  

If you create an account, you will be able to access your interviews online from anywhere, enabling you 
to have someone review your answers before you file.  

NOTE: If you have an existing OJD eFiling (File and Serve) account, Guide and File allows you to use that 
account to save your forms.

Frequently Asked Questions 

9/4/15 

ill my email or personal information be shared? 

No, OJD and Tyler Technologies will not share your email address or other personal information used to 
create your account. Be aware that information submitted to the court, such as court documents, may 
be available to the public. 

I forgot my password, what do I do? 

From the login page, click the Forgot Password button and follow the prompts to recover your account. 

How long until my session expires from inactivity? 

Your session will expire after 20 minutes of inactivity. 

Can I save the information I have enter into OJD Guide and File and come back to it later? 

Yes, as long as you have registered and are logged into the system your interviews are saved every time 
you finish a page. You can get back to any of your interviews, including completed interviews, by 
selecting My Interviews from the main drop-down list.

How much does OJD Guide and File cost? 

OJD Guide and File is provided free of charge. 

Electronic Filing 
Can I electronically file (eFile) my documents? 

Yes, OJD Guide and File allows several forms to be eFiled with the court if electronic filing is available. If 
you choose to eFile your documents they will be seamlessly filed through the Oregon Judicial 
Department’s circuit court eFiling system OJD File and Serve.  

How does eFiling work? 

If eFiling is available and you want to eFile your document(s) with the court, you will need an email 
address and a valid credit card or debit card with a Visa, Mastercard, or Discover logo on it to pay the 
standard filing fees. There is no charge to use Guide and File or to File and Serve, but most cases require 
filing fees paid to the court. A list of current filing fees can be found here: 
http://courts.oregon.gov/Washington/docs/2015_CircuitFeeSchedule_public.pdf. You will be prompted 
to pay these fees if any are necessary during the electronic filing process. 

Does eFiling change how I need to serve my documents?

OJD Guide and File  
Frequently Asked Questions 

 

9/4/15 

Depending on the type of document or case you are filing, the law may require you to serve (provide) 
documents to the other party. Guide and File does not change this requirement. Is there a cost for 
eFiling? 

No there are no additional fees for eFiling. 

What if I need a fee waiver or fee deferral? 

The Oregon Circuit Courts do not accept requests for fee waivers or deferrals through the eFiling 
system. If you need a waiver or deferral you can complete your forms in Guide and File, print the forms, 
and then file them with the court in person. When requesting a fee waiver or fee deferral, you will need 
to file an application and proposed order. The application and order forms can be found here: 
http://www.ojd.state.or.us/Web/OJDPublications.nsf/Civil%20Fee%20Deferral%20and%20Waiver?Ope
nView 

Bring your completed Guide and File forms, application, and proposed order to the court for filing. 

Why would I want to eFile my document(s)? 

eFiling is a convenient and cost effective alternative to file your documents with the court. With eFiling 
there is no need to go to the courthouse and wait in line to file your documents(s) or spend money on 
postage to mail the court your document(s). 

Is eFiling mandatory? 

eFiling is only mandatory for active members of the Oregon State Bar (attorneys).  

If I eFile when is my document considered filed? 

eFiled documents are considered filed when they are accepted by the court. It can take up to 48 
business hours for a filing to be reviewed by the court, although the majority of filings are reviewed 
within 24 hours. The file stamp date of all eFiled documents is the date and time that the filing was 
submitted for review. 

How will I know if my eFiled document is accepted by the court? 

You will receive a notification through email (your account email address) when your filing is submitted 
for review. After the court reviews your filing you will receive an email notifying you whether your 
document(s) is accepted or if it is being returned for correction. If you are filing a document that starts a 
new case (such as a complaint) your email will contain your case number. 

Do I need to do anything after my filing is accepted?

OJD Guide and File  
Frequently Asked Questions 

 

9/4/15 

Yes, most cases require you to follow certain procedures or do certain actions after filing documents 
with the court. This can include providing the other party the document you filed (service), providing a 
court summons to the other party, or other actions. Consult your Next Steps document for more 
information.  This document is provided upon completion of the interview process. 

If you have questions about the local procedures for the court where you are filing your documents 
contact that court. The court cannot provide legal advice but they can advise you of the procedures for 
their court. 

What do I do if my eFiling is returned? 

If you are not an attorney you have two options, 1) correct the mistake on the form and re-eFile the 
corrected document; or 2) correct the mistake, print the document, and file the document in person 
with the court. 

If I am having problems with eFiling who do I contact? 

Technical support for the eFiling system is provided by Tyler Technologies. You can get support from 
Tyler Technologies from 5:00 AM to 7:00 PM Pacific Standard Time. Tyler Technologies can be contacted 
by email, phone, and live chat. You can access this information under SUPPORT at this website: 
https://oregon.tylerhost.net/ 

Support and Other Questions 
The form is asking me to upload a document, what format does OJD Guide and File accept? 

Documents must be submitted in PDF or PDF-A text-searchable format. The court does not accept 
Microsoft Word, WordPerfect, or any other document format. There are numerous free resources 
available over the Internet that can help you create a PDF document that fits these standard. 

Are the documents I file open to the public? 

Most cases and documents filed with the court are public documents unless the document or case is 
deemed confidential or sealed by law or a court order. 

I don’t see what I am looking for, what do I do? 

Not all forms are available through Guide and File. If you do not see the form you are looking for, go to 
the OJD Forms page to find the appropriate paper form and instructions. Your local circuit court may 
have additional local forms available which can be accessed through the court’s local webpage or at the 
courthouse. You can access the forms page here: http://courts.oregon.gov/ojd/forms/pages/index.aspx.

Frequently Asked Questions 

9/4/15 

hat help is available for Guide and File? 

 

  W

The Oregon Judicial Department provides a quick reference guide for navigating through OJD Guide and 
File. OJD also provides a video on how to complete forms using Guide and File. 

Each interview has help content relevant to the form you are filling out and the questions you are being 
asked.  

While Guide and File can help you fill out the form based on answers you provide, court cases can 
involve complex legal issues. THE OREGON JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT AND COURT STAFF CANNOT 
PROVIDE LEGAL ADVICE. If you have questions you may need to consult an attorney. The Oregon State 
Bar has resources available through their website, http://www.osbar.org/public/, which may help you 
understand the law and find an attorney.  

What languages are available? 

Currently, Guide and File provides interviews in English. OJD provides paper forms in other languages 
which can be accessed here: http://courts.oregon.gov/ojd/forms/pages/index.aspx. Interviews in 
additional languages will come online in the future. All forms must be filled out in English.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
