This pamphlet is for general educational use only and is up-to-date as of March 2011.  It is not a substitute for the advice of 
an attorney. Please consult an attorney for more information or for advice about whether and how the law applies to your 
situation. 

Abusers use what they know about you to stalk, harass or abuse you. 
Oregon laws can help protect your privacy. 
 
Safety Planning 

our local domestic violence program may be able to help you create a safety plan.  A safety plan means thinking of ways to 
make yourself safer from your abuser.  Part of your safety plan may be to keep your location or other information about you 
secret, so your abuser cannot locate you, stalk you or commit identity theft against you. 

or a list of local domestic violence programs, go to:  

http:/courts.oregon.gov/OJD/OSCA/cpsd/courtimprovement/familylaw/domesticviolence.page? 
 

 
Address Confidentiality Program 
 
Oregon’s Department of Justice offers a free substitute address and mail forwarding service for victims of domestic violence, 
sexual assault and stalking called the Address Confidentiality Program (ACP).  You can use your ACP address for any public 
record that requires an address.  For more information about the ACP, go to:  
 

www.doj.state.or.us/crimev/confidentiality.shtml 

  Y

  F

 

SAFETY TIP 

You can keep your address and phone number confidential in public records like DHS, 
DMV and voter registration records even without an ACP address. Call or write the 
state agency you are concerned about for more information. 

                         

 

    

             

       

Confidentiality and Court Proceedings 

Court proceedings are generally open to the public, and most records filed with the court are available for the public to view. 
You must put your address and phone number on most court paperwork, including court paperwork for getting restraining 
orders.  This information is given to the other party and available to the public.  If this would put you in danger, you may use 
a contact phone number and address.  You must check your contact address/phone number often so you do not miss important 
court notices. 

SAFETY TIP 

If you participate in the ACP, you may use that address for court documents. Because the 
ACP forwards your mail, you may have less time to respond to court actions or you may 
have less time to prepare for a hearing. 

 

If you are a crime victim in a criminal case, you can ask that your phone number and address be kept from the defendant.  To 
get more information, talk to the district attorney or a crime victim assistant.  If you have questions about your rights, go to: 
 

www.oregoncrimevictimsrights.org 
 

Confidentiality in Family Law Cases 

n divorce, custody, child support and Family Abuse Prevention Act restraining order cases, confidential personal information-
driver’s license and social security numbers, birthdates, employer information and former legal names- are put in a 
“confidential information form” or “CIF.”  This form is not used for stalking or elder/disabled abuse prevention restraining 
orders. 

he information in the CIF is not available to the public.  The CIF is not given to the other party.  The other party may file 

papers with the court and ask to see your CIF.  If they do, you may ask for a hearing and the judge will decide whether the CIF 
will be given to the other party. 
 

 I

  T

It may seem like changing your name and/or social security number and relocating would 
be the easiest way to escape abuse. Unfortunately, this often causes more problems than it 
solves. Before trying to change your identity, talk to an attorney about whether this choice 
is right for you. If you cannot afford an attorney, call Legal Aid or the Oregon Law Center 
for advice. 

 

Confidentiality and Child Support 
 

hen you ask for benefits from DHS like TANF or OHP, you agree to help the state get child support from the other parent.  

The Division of Child Support (DCS) is the state agency that gets and enforces child support orders. 

DCS may give personal information about you, such as your current address and phone number to the other party.  If this 
would put you in danger, ask your DHS worker for a “Client Safety Packet” and fill out the “Claim of Risk” form.  This will 
allow you to use a contact address and to keep your personal information private. 

1.  Division of Child Support 

  W

 

SAFETY TIP 

If you do not want DCS to get or enforce child support at all for safety reasons, ask your DHS 
worker for a “Client Safety Packet” and fill out the “Good Cause” form. 

2.  District Attorneys 

Your local district attorney can help you find a missing father, establish paternity, get a child support order, and /or collect 
child support if you do not receive public assistance.  If you would like child support, but need to keep your address or other 
personal information confidential, ask your district attorney for a “client safety packet” and complete the “Claim of Risk” 
form. 

Confidentiality and Technology 

Abusers use technology to stalk their victims. This can be as complex as using specialized cameras or taping technologies or 
as simple as misusing cell phones or GPS devices.  Increasingly, abusers are also using spyware to monitor computer use. 
 

  

             

 

 

 

 

               

                       

 

                  

SAFETY TIP 

If you suspect that you are being monitored through technology, take steps such as using a safe computer 
(such as a public computer at the library) for sensitive research or communications. Talk to a Victim 
Advocate about planning to be safer with your technology. The National Network to End Domestic 
Violence has more information about technology safety at www.nnedv.org/resources/safetynetdocs.html. 

Stalking and Identity Theft 

If an abuser gains access to your personal information, she may harass you by stealing your identity.  If you are at risk for 
identity theft, you should check your credit report.  You are can get a free credit report every year - call 1-877-322-8228 or go 
to www.annualcreditreport.com. 

he National Network to End Domestic Violence has more information about technology safety at 

SAFETY TIP 

If you are the victim of identity theft, the Federal Trade Commission has a step by step guide to responding 
www.nnedv.org/resources/safetynetdocs.html 
called “Taking Charge: Fighting Back Against Identity Theft.” This guide is available at:

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
