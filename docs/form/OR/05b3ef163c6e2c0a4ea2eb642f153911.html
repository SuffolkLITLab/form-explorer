he purview of SFLAC is within the discretion of the Chief Justice, who appoints members to 

staggered 3-year terms, renewable indefinitely, in her or his discretion. There are usually 
approximately 15-18 members representing diverse vantage points on family law and the Oregon 
Judicial Department. Members represent a diversity of professions (judiciary, law practice, court 
administration, child support, mediation, mental health, and others).  There is conscious diversity 
of geography, gender and ethnicity.  To date, the Chair has been a judicial officer.  There is no

(1)  The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may appoint a statewide family law advisory committee 
to assist the State Court Administrator in carrying out the administrator's responsibilities under 
ORS 3.438 (2) and (4)(a) and in identifying family law issues that need to be addressed in the 
future. The Chief Justice shall consider the diversity of this state in appointing the members of 
the statewide advisory committee. 

The founding statute, ORS 3.436, includes this language: 
 

STRUCTURE

judicial majority by design and recommendation of the group itself.  The SFLAC, and its 
subcommittees, are committed to supporting successful family law policies, reforms and 
programs that serve all individuals and families who access Oregon’s courts.  We believe we can 
do so only with a diverse membership which actively cultivates a culture of equity and inclusion.  
Thus, we are committed to seeking out and strongly encouraging applicants to apply who are 
Black, Indigenous, Latinx and persons of color; LGBTQIA2+ individuals; veterans; persons with 
disabilities; and persons from other traditionally underrepresented communities.     

ll meetings are subject to Oregon’s public meeting laws.  SFLAC publishes its agendas in 
advance, maintains a public website, assures access to all venues, and provides opportunity for 
public comment. SFLAC members and guests may call in to meetings, and video access is 
provided.  When meetings are held in-person, members may request reimbursement for travel 
expenses if funds are available, but members receive no compensation for service.   

ervice on SFLAC requires a substantial time commitment.  Meetings are quarterly (typically 
March, June, September, and December), usually on Fridays, and last up to four hours.  Prior to 
the pandemic, meetings were held in person usually in Portland and Salem. This year, the 
SFLAC voted on the preference for the platform and format of meetings going forward.  With 
the approval of OJD, the SFLAC chose to have three of the four meetings continue to be remote.  
The fourth meeting, will be held in-person as an all-day retreat where we can engage in 
substantive SFLAC project planning.  The location will vary throughout Oregon, and we will use 
the annual meeting as an opportunity to connect with the local courts and community.  

embers are actively involved and generally serve on one or more subcommittees.  Service on 
the subcommittees require interim meetings and preparation for the quarterly SFLAC meetings. 
Subcommittees and work groups are formed and reformed as needed.  It is not necessary to be an 
SFLAC member to serve on a subcommittee, in fact, the SFLAC benefits when the 
subcommittees pull from a broader pool of members for insight and contributions. Many SFLAC 
members have contributed prior service on a subcommittee, and we have started asking 
applicants interested in serving on the SFLAC to get involved with one of our subcommittees 
prior to considering joining the SFLAC. 

he members have an excellent attendance rate at the meetings, which is critical because each 
member has been specifically chosen to participate in the group based on their unique knowledge 
and skills set. The meetings are comprehensive and allow for an exchange of information and 
sharing of goals for family law policy in the State of Oregon.  There is equality of individual 
respect not arbitrarily hindered by hierarchy, titles, length of service, or deference to rank.  There 
is an atmosphere of businesslike informality, humor and collegiality. There is often outspoken, 
but respectful, frankness in pursuit of consensus, which is almost always reached, but is not 
required.  This refreshing dynamic allows the group to tackle tough issues with fervor and 
continue to strive to have Oregon be a leader in prioritizing service to families involved with the 
litigation process.     

t least annually, the Chief Justice and the State Court Administrator (SCA) meet with SFLAC 
to discuss issues and policies under the purview of the committee.  SFLAC remains advisory to

the Chief and SCA. Additionally, each member serves as liaison to one or more local Family 
Law Advisory Committees (FLAC) and reports on the activities of the local FLACs.  

n addition to the specific work outlined by the subcommittees below, the ongoing Covid-19 
Pandemic provided additional opportunities for the SFLAC to continue their important work.  
The individual subcommittee reports are listed below.  The SFLAC, and its members 
individually, remain active throughout the State promoting the work of the SFLAC as follows:  
 

1)  OJD Change Management Workshops: the subcommittee chairs and SFLAC leadership 

participated in workshops to strategize implementing effective change to address duplication of 
efforts within OJD and community partners, and communication strategies moving forward. 
  

2)  The SFLAC Family Law Conference 2021: Many of the subcommittee Chairs either presented 

(PIOS, Child Support, DV Sub) or recommended presenters/topics. The conference was attended 
by an interdisciplinary audience of 270 (not including those that viewed the recorded 
presentations after the conference).  More details are included in the Education subcommittee 
report. Many speakers were SFLAC members, including: Kate Cooper Richardson, Colleen 
Carter Cox, Sr. Judge Raines, Judge McIntosh, Judge Armstrong, Debra Dority, Ryan Carty, 
Samantha Malloy, Judge McGuire, and Dr. Furchner.  
 

3)  Reconstituting Local FLACs:  While all Presiding Judges are required to constitute an FLAC to 

address policy on family law issues in their county, some counties’ FLACs remain dormant.  The 
SFLAC has identified the importance of supporting the continued growth of local FLACs as an 
ongoing goal and are generating recommendations for OJD to facilitate implementing this 
statutory mandate. With broad outreach efforts, the SFLAC members have managed to 
reconstitute local FLACs in Marion, Washington, and Jackson, Lincoln, and Coos/Curry 
counties with other judicial districts making inquiries into a process to restart their dormant 
groups.  This critical growth will continue to increase the flow of communication, information 
sharing and ultimately improve the work of OJD in serving Oregon families around the state.  
 

4)  Educational Information sessions to the legislature: SFLAC Chair, Judge McIntyre, and Vice-
Chair, Debra Dority, presented to the Oregon House Judiciary Civil Subcommittee in Spring 
2021.  The presentation focused on Family Law 101, to provide legislators a basic understanding 
of the family law system, as family law bills were being considered during the 2021 session.  
With this presentation and the open invitation to the legislators to attend the SFLAC meetings, 
we are hoping to continue building relationships such that legislators recognize the SFLAC as a 
resource in the future when family law-related issues arise. This invitation has resulted in Amie 
Fender-Sosa, (Legislative Policy and Research Office of Legislature) to routinely join our 
meetings.  
 

5)  Strengthened the internal review of projects prior to approval by the SFLAC: When generating 

recommendations, we have created an expectation that projects will be vetted by each 
subcommittee before being forwarded to the SFLAC (and ultimately the Chief Justice and SCA) 

HE WORK OF 2021 and early 2022 

  T

  I

Statewide Family Law Advisory Committee Annual Report - Spring 2022 

Page 3 

for ultimate approval.  This creates a broader audience for review and input to attempt to reach a 
meaningful consensus on projects and recommendations.   
 

6)  Strengthened Organizational Structure and enhanced recruitment efforts:   SFLAC Chair and 
SFLAC Vice Chair met with the Chairs and Co/Vice Chairs of each of the subcommittees 
throughout 2021. The purpose of the meetings:  1) to ensure each committee had a co/vice chair 
and that they were each getting OJD staff support; 2) to afford the chairs an opportunity to 
discuss the subcommittee’s need for any particular voice or skill set not yet represented on the 
subcommittee; and 3) to determine whether there was anyone on their subcommittee they would 
recommend for the SFLAC. The meetings were also an opportunity to discuss how to keep the 
needs of self-represented litigants at the center of the work of each subcommittee as well as a 
discussion of the newly implemented plan to ensure each subcommittee has an opportunity to 
weigh in on the work of other subcommittees to allow for further vetting, rather than only have 
the input of the SFLAC members alone. 
 

7)  In early 2021, SFLAC was asked for and provided input to the OSB Paraprofessional Licensing 
Implementation Committee.  In late 2021, SFLAC received a report and training on the final 
licensing recommendations from the implementation committee.   
  

n addition to the Covid-specific work, many members of the SFLAC are called upon in their 
various capacities to provide independent insight regarding family law policies to the Courts, the 
legislature, and as experts for organizations and conferences locally and nationwide.  It is fairly 
common to see SFLAC members providing testimony or informational interviews to State 
legislators or subcommittees involved in specific family law bills. While these presentations at 
the Capitol and at various educational conferences are not within the charge and purview of the 
work of the SFLAC, it is an additional way that the members are staying involved in their local 
and state efforts to shape and inform family law policies.  
 

SUBCOMMITTEE SUMMARIES 
 

There are several subcommittees of the SFLAC where the bulk of the work of the SFLAC is 
done.  These subcommittees will constitute, expand, decrease, and go dormant from time to time 
depending on the needs of the group.  After careful consideration regarding priorities moving 
forward, in 2016 the SFLAC agreed to absorb the mission of the Self-Represented Subcommittee 
into the work of each and every subcommittee. The currently active subcommittees are listed 
below with a summary statement regarding recent achievements.  

ith the pressing and unique shift occurring in the courts as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic 

the SFLAC’s subcommittees have kept at the forefront of their work, the innovations that have 
already occurred and striving to define the “new normal” that will likely shape up in the coming 
years.  Each subcommittee has made specific COVID-19 recommendations for the Oregon 
Courts and will strive to capitalize on the momentum of positive changes in the courts to better 
serve Oregon families.

hat has been the goal/focus of the subcommittee in 2021?  

PIOS has been working on 2 projects, both related to families who have a child who is resisting 
or refusing parenting time. The first is a handout that will be proposed for Judges in Oregon. The 
second will be a pamphlet for parents and professionals. 

hat are the subcommittee’s top short-term priorities (within the next year)? 

We are working to complete the two projects detailed above. We anticipate that we may need to 
accompany these materials with video or in-person trainings, which have been discussed, but not 
planned. 

hat are the subcommittee’s top long-term priorities (within the next 5 years)? 

We do not have well-articulated goals beyond our current projects but will continue to look for 
opportunities to create tools to assist family law practitioners and litigants especially the self-
represented litigants.  

hat are the subcommittee’s current projects and timelines for completion? 

We hope to have our current projects completed within the next 2-3 months. 

hat are the challenges identified by your subcommittee in furthering your prioritized 

work?  
Our challenges take 2 forms. We have a large, diverse and busy subcommittee, which makes 
coordinating meetings difficult. The diversity also poses challenges and benefits in moving 
efficiently. Our subcommittee takes on issues that can have a wide range of theoretical 
“positions” and political implications. At times we can bog down in our discussions of these 
larger issues. Leading the group demands that we find a way to honor these diverse opinions, 
while still moving efficiently to complete work. 

hat are the challenges for courts in implementing the recommendations from the 

subcommittee?

hat has been the goal/focus of the subcommittee in 2021?  

The DV Subcommittee’s goal is to advise the Chief Justice regarding issues, legislation, and 
resources relating to domestic violence, and provide resources for the same.  In 2021, the DV 
Subcommittee focused on a few main projects: 

irst, updated and expanded the Firearms Benchsheets per 2019’s HB 2013, which greatly 
expanded the class of protection order respondents and criminal defendants prohibited from 
possessing firearms.  
•  https://www.courts.oregon.gov/programs/family/domestic-

violence/Documents/Firearm.Benchsheet.Protection.Orders.pdf  

•  https://www.courts.oregon.gov/programs/family/domestic-

violence/Documents/Firearm.Benchsheet.Protection.Orders.pdf  

Second, we conducted a statewide survey of domestic and sexual violence advocates and 
survivors regarding remote services for obtaining a restraining order in Oregon during the Covid-
19 Pandemic. We also attended national listening sessions led by the National Council of 
Juvenile and Family Court Judges (NCJFCJ) during the summer of 2021 that included 
respondents to assess the adjustments courts made nationally and determine whether any aspects 
of the remote hearings should continue without regard to the Pandemic. The survey results and a 
summary of the findings of the different listening sessions were provided to members of OJD 
already working on surveys.  The result was a recommendation that additional surveys that 
includes a wider pool, including more input from litigants on both sides, as well as providers of 
the services including Judges and court staff was needed.   

ast, we also finalized the Stalking Bench Book in 2021, though the bulk it its creation was in 

2020: https://www.courts.oregon.gov/programs/family/domestic-
violence/Documents/Stalking.pdf

hat are the subcommittee’s top short-term priorities (within the next year)? 

We have only recently finalized our last two projects from 2021 [update of Firearms Bench 
Sheets (Qualifying Protection Orders and Qualifying Convictions) and survey of advocates and 
survivors regarding remote restraining order hearings]. Our current 2022 project is to update the 
Family Abuse Prevention Act (FAPA) Bench Guide.  In 2019, the standard to prevail at a 
contested FAPA hearing was amended by HB 3117. In addition, 2019’s HB 2013 greatly 
expanded Oregon’s firearms prohibition laws including the creation of a declaration and transfer 
procedure for qualifying protective order respondents.  We will make these substantive legal 
updates to the Bench Guide. We also plan to include information on trauma-informed 
courtrooms and judicial practices from which judges can create a trauma-informed script to be 

Statewide Family Law Advisory Committee Annual Report - Spring 2022 

Page 7 

used at protection order hearings, as well as provide information on best practices for using 
interpreters. 

n addition to updating the FAPA Bench Guide, we plan to create a mission statement to ensure 
the work of the DV Subcommittee remains focused.  This may include a vision and purpose 
statement in accord with the best practices from the OJD Change Management training attended 
in 2021-2022. We have a list of additional projects under consideration, including solutions to 
the failure of law enforcement to respond to restraining order violations.   
  
Finally, we have discussed the sections of the OJD website regarding DV resources and 
protection orders.  When someone Googles “domestic violence Oregon” they are taken to the 
OJD website.  We are discussing how to ensure that the website is providing survivors the 
resources they need in obtaining a protection order, while also being directed to other resources 
such as safety planning.  OJD’s Amy Benedum is working on this effort and will bring it back to 
the DV Sub for further input. 

hat are the subcommittee’s top long-term priorities (within the next 5 years)? 

Some long-term priorities include: 
•  Updating the Elderly Persons and Persons with Disabilities Abuse Prevention Act 

(EPPDAPA) Bench Book.  

•  Conduct research and provide resources on best practices to create a trauma-informed 
courtroom, particularly for domestic and sexual violence-related hearings/trials. 

•  Further implementation of Oregon’s firearm dispossession protocols including providing 

• 

training and resources (such as our newly updated Firearms Benchsheets).   
Investigate the increased practice of law enforcement’s failure to respond to calls of 
protection order violations and analyze ways to ensure those protected by such orders remain 
protected.   

We will continue the following work: 

•  Propose updates and changes to court forms, materials, and resources regarding domestic 

violence (including developing updates to the FAPA Bench Book and the EPPDAPA Bench 
Book, and the Stalking Bench Book when necessary). 

•  Support education of the bench and bar related to domestic violence, sexual assault, and 

stalking. 

•  Propose and provide speakers for the SFLAC Conference on domestic violence, working 

with trauma survivors, and firearms. 

•  Advise the Chief Justice on issues relating to domestic violence.

hat are the subcommittee’s current projects and timelines for completion? 

As we have only recently begun our present project of updating the FAPA Bench Guide, our 
timeline has not yet been determined. However, this will be the focus of 2022, which we hope to 
complete within the year.

What are the challenges identified by your subcommittee in furthering your prioritized 
work?  
The DV Subcommittee has identified the need to clarify the mission and focus of this 
subcommittee to ensure that it is consistent with the work of other subcommittees and the 
SFLAC as a whole.  That has informed our priority this year to create a mission statement using 
the OJD Change Management training resources to clarify and accord our shared values and 
establish processes to accomplish our mission.    

elated, the DV Subcommittee conducted a statewide survey of domestic and sexual violence 
advocates and survivors regarding remote services for obtaining a restraining order in Oregon 
during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The survey was targeted to survivor/petitioners and advocates 
(persons present or support for person(s) seeking restraining order) but was more widely 
disseminated, such as to the OSB Family Law Listserv. There were 100 responses: 83 advocates, 
8 survivors, 6 attorneys, 2 law enforcement officers and 1 family justice center staff member. 
Because the responses were mostly advocates, some were concerned that the results would not 
be informative without additional surveys of providers of such hearings (Judges, court staff, 
interpreter services, etc.) and consumers (litigants and their counsel).  Because the subcommittee 
does not have the expertise nor resources to conduct such surveys, and because OJD was already 
engaged in survey work that we do not want to duplicate, it was determined that the results of the 
survey (as well as the summary of the NCJFCJ Listening Sessions referenced above) would be 
shared with Valerie Colas at OJD in case they are helpful for the survey work being used at that 
level. 

hat are the challenges for courts in implementing the recommendations from the 

subcommittee? 
Our subcommittee updated and expanded the Firearms Benchsheets per 2019’s HB 2013, which 
greatly expanded the class of protection order respondents and criminal defendants prohibited 
from possessing firearms.  However, preliminary statewide reports indicate that many qualifying 
respondents/defendants are still not following the required protocol to file a declaration and 
transfer firearms/ammunition.  In addition, reports indicate that district attorneys are not filing 
the available contempt remedies when respondents/ defendants fail to file a declaration.  We 
anticipate significant work remains ahead to ensure this important protection for survivors works 
as intended, including, increased communication between the courts (regarding which cases have 
not yet had a declaration filed) and the district attorneys’ offices, for example. 

hat additional support would lend itself to improving the work of your subcommittee?  
Specifically, the project relating to OJD’s website could use some outside expertise not only in 
technology, but in adult learning styles to create the best resource for those in need of DV 
resources. 

oes your subcommittee evaluate the needs of self-represented litigants within the 

framework of your projects?  
Yes! Much of the survey focused upon petitioners in protection order hearings primarily because 
the vast majority of petitioners apply for POs and attend ex parte PO hearings without

representation of an attorney.  In addition, one focus of our subcommittee has been working to 
include a trauma-informed lens to the work we do, which most benefits self-represented litigants.   

hat are the subcommittee’s top accomplishments over the past five years?  

•  Development of Stalking Bench Book; 
•  Update of the Firearms Benchsheets for both Qualifying Protection Orders and Qualifying 

Convictions; 

•  Proposed DV-related trainings/trainer for the SFLAC Conferences and Facilitator Trainings;  
•  Provision of detailed input on remote court services during the beginning of the pandemic, 

including recommendations for a safety-informed and a trauma-informed response; 

•  Suggested changes to the protection order forms provided by OJD. 

 Given SFLAC’s (and its subcommittees) commitment to supporting a family law system 
that serves all families, is there a perspective, voice, or subject matter expertise that you 
believe is missing from the SFLAC or your subcommittee?  
Our subcommittee will benefit from inclusion of the voice and experience of folks from non-
dominant culture, particularly in race and/or ethnicity, LGBTQIA+ status and persons with 
disabilities. We will also benefit from including those who are or have been users of the system- 
both former family law litigants and survivors.

What has been the goal/focus of the subcommittee in 2021?  

•  The focus of the SFLAC Mediation Subcommittee in 2021 was (1)  to ensure that all family law 
litigants have access to court-connected mediation services to assist them in understanding and 
coming to an agreement about issues between them; (2) to inform and support the OJD and 
mediation services statewide about best practices and innovative programs; and (3) to make 
recommendations to ensure adequate funding for robust services.

What are the subcommittee’s top short-term priorities (within the next year)? 
The Mediation Subcommittee’s top short-term priorities are to:  

•  Make recommendations to address ongoing mediation funding challenges; 
•  Participate in OJD’s efforts to review and update the court-connected mediator qualification 
requirements outlined in Chief Justice Order No. 05-028 and participate in the stakeholder 
process to explore moving those requirements to the Uniform Trial Court Rules; 

•  Make recommendations regarding the dedicated OJD Alternative Dispute Resolution position 
that, once filled, will be responsible for monitoring and supporting court-connected domestic 
relations mediation throughout Oregon; 

•  Review quarterly data and interpret said data to develop statewide-recommended best practices; 
•  Make recommendations for mediator training opportunities through OSCA; 
•  Support the development of resources for family law stakeholders and mediators regarding court-

•  Stay current in domestic relations mediation best practices and encourage innovative services.  

connected mediation; and 

 

What are the subcommittee’s top long-term priorities (within the next 5 years)? 

•  The subcommittee’s top long-term priority is making recommendations to ensure sufficient 

funding so high-quality domestic relations mediation is available statewide to all eligible litigants 
regardless of their ability to pay. 

What are the subcommittee’s current projects and timelines for completion? 

•  Create a resource by fall of 2022 for attorneys whose clients are participating in court-connected 

mediation services.  

•  Participate in OJD’s stakeholder efforts to review and update the court-connected mediator 
qualification requirements outlined in Chief Justice Order No. 05-028. Participate in the 
stakeholder process to explore moving those requirements to the Uniform Trial Court Rules. The 
timeline of this project will be determined by OJD and the UTCR Committee.  

•  Make recommendations to increase statewide mediation funding to enable adequate funding for 

increased access to mediation services. This is an ongoing project.  
 

What are the challenges identified by your subcommittee in furthering your prioritized work?  
•  Aside from the significant funding challenges for court-connected domestic relations mediation 
services across Oregon, the largest challenge identified by the mediation subcommittee in 
furthering the subcommittee’s work is the lack of a full-time dedicated position at OJD whose 
responsibility is to monitor court-connected domestic relations mediation throughout the state.  
We are heartened by OJD’s plan to onboard a full-time position for Alternative Dispute 
Resolution services and we hope that this position will be able to move forward many of the 
mediation subcommittee’s initiatives; we are also aware of the significant work load associated 
with this position’s project priorities and believe that the work of this committee and statewide 
domestic mediation services will benefit most from having a full-time position. We recommend 
that OJD staff person take on the following duties: 

•  Support statewide mediation budget initiatives to address historic underfunding 

including: reviewing the existing funding distribution chart to determine if funds are 
being distributed to Counties equitably and appropriately for service levels being offered; 

Statewide Family Law Advisory Committee Annual Report - Spring 2022 

Page 11 

creating policy option packages to request adequate funding for mediation services; and 
creating a system of reporting regarding use of mediation funds.  

•  Determine a process for reviewing and likely updating the CJO 05-028 governing court-
connected mediator qualifications; participate with other interested parties (for example 
the recently convened UTCR effort) to determine the appropriate location and terms of 
any new set of rules regarding mediator qualifications. 

•  Regularly attend the Mediation Services Subcommittee meetings, bring questions for the 

subcommittee to advise upon and generally serving as a liaison between the 
subcommittee and OJD. 

•  Develop a periodic review process for the Mediator Reports currently being submitted by 
mediators to OJCIN as part of the ongoing data project, and contact courts when their 
results seem incorrect in order to ensure timely and accurate reports so that the ultimate 
data reported statewide will be accurate and complete. Participate with the subcommittee 
in considering trends as shown by the data collected and in making best practice 
recommendations. 

•  Coordinate with OSCA to offer ongoing continuing education opportunities for court-

connected mediators.  

•  Contact each judicial district to determine who is the appropriate point of contact for 

court-connected domestic relations mediation there, and developing and maintaining a 
list of all current, qualified mediators in that judicial district. 

•  Develop (revive) the process for these mediators to report their continuing education 

hours as required under CJO 05-028.  (There is currently no oversight or accountability 
on this issue). 

What are the challenges for courts in implementing the recommendations from the 
subcommittee? 

•  The largest challenge for courts in implementing the recommendations from the mediation 
subcommittee is the existing limited state-wide funding for mediation. The proposed 
mediation/conciliation Current Service Level and Chief Justice’s Recommended Budget amount 
for the 2021-2023 biennium is lower than the 2007-2009 biennium funding levels. We strongly 
recommend increased attention to this issue such that sufficient funding is made available 
statewide, with a transparent mechanism for both how the funds are distributed on a biennial 
basis and accountability from service providers regarding how the funds are used.  We further 
recommend that the funding mechanism be one that provides for appropriate periodic increases 
without the need for policy option packages to cover the increased costs of providing services. 

he previous sentence notwithstanding, given that there are currently no identified avenues for 
remedying the ongoing and significant underfunding of statewide domestic relations services, we 
strongly recommend OJD put forth a Policy Option Package to increase each County’s mediation 
funds for the next biennium. This committee has over ten years of documentable data regarding 
the stagnant underfunding of statewide mediation services and the many negative—and 

  T

Statewide Family Law Advisory Committee Annual Report - Spring 2022 

Page 12 

substantial—impacts of such underfunding including mediation services being cut (for example, 
services being offered for only part of the year in some counties, decreased mediator positions 
for mediation programs, decreased total mediation hours available per case, and increased 
caseloads—often unsustainably so—for existing mediators). While the committee can describe at 
length the harmful outcomes of less than adequate statewide mediation funding, we invite the 
SFLAC and OJD to consider: how much more can we do for family law litigants if we 
adequately fund domestic relations mediation services?  

hile the mediator report data has limitations, it provides a sense of the services being offered. 

In 2021, mediators submitted 4,614 mediator reports that indicated the parties participated in 
mediation. From those reports, 51.7% of cases reported that the parties reached one or more 
agreements during mediation; 31.5% of the mediator reports indicated the parties had reached a 
full agreement at the time of the final mediation session. The mediator report data does not 
include data on how many parents resolved remaining matters on their own after mediation 
ended, nor does it include specifics on how many parents ended up needing a trial despite 
reporting a full agreement in mediation. And, the reports may or may not account for financial 
matters being resolved depending on the jurisdiction. However, basic data exists for which we 
can compare our current mediation services, time spent mediating, number of children served per 
case, and the funding levels per jurisdiction. A basic review will highlight the significant gaps in 
statewide mediation funding. With many counties facing upcoming mediation service cuts (and 
many having already made service cuts), we strongly recommend OJD put forth a Policy Option 
Package to increase each County’s mediation funds for the next biennium. We invite you to 
envision what might be possible for family law litigants, mediation services, and the courts with 
adequate statewide mediation funding. How can we maximize mediation funding to ensure (and 
increase) client access to domestic relations mediation services? How can we guarantee quality 
mediation service delivery rooted in best practices? And how can we further minimize the 
amount of court time needed to resolve matters that family law litigants can resolve on their own 
in mediation?  
 

  W

What additional support would lend itself to improving the work of your subcommittee?  

•  The most essential support needed that the SFLAC make recommendations in support of OJD 

putting forth a POP for the next biennium to increase each county’s mediation fund.  

•  Having a full-time dedicated position at OJD whose responsibility is to monitor court-connected 

domestic relations mediation throughout the state would vastly improve the work of the 
subcommittee. Our currently assigned staff is able to allocate approximately four hours per 
month to support the work of the subcommittee.  

Does your subcommittee evaluate the needs of self-represented litigants within the framework of 
your projects?  
Yes. The mediation subcommittee evaluates the needs of self-represented litigants within the 
framework of our projects.  

hat are the subcommittee’s top accomplishments over the past five years?  
•  Supported OJD in crafting policy option packages to increase mediation funding (both were 

included in the Chief’s budget, but not funded by the legislature). The subcommittee will be able 

  W

Page 13 

to make significant strides toward our goals with the support of a full-time OJD position for the 
benefit of family law litigants and court-connected mediation services across the state. 

•  Designed the Mediation Data Collection Project, a process for reporting and tracking the 
outcome of court-connected domestic relations mediation; drafted instruction letter on 
completing the mediator reports for mediators and court staff; drafted a review letter after a 
year of data collection highlighted needed clarifications and  improvements. 
 

Given SFLAC’s (and its subcommittees) commitment to supporting a family law system that 
serves all families, is there a perspective, voice, or subject matter expertise that you believe is 
missing from the SFLAC or your subcommittee?  

•  The mediation subcommittee has a geographically diverse membership and involves multiple 

court-connected mediation stakeholders. The subcommittee will benefit from reviewing current 
membership to determine if additional perspectives, voices, experiences, or areas of expertise are 
missing from the subcommittee and if so, to determine how to involve those perspectives and 
voices moving forward.  

Any suggestions for improved management or operation of the SFLAC at large?  

• 

Incorporating a communication flowchart for the SFLAC will increase the information and 
education between the SFLAC, subcommittees, and other involved entities to reduce duplication 
of work, increase efficiencies and to improve access to justice across the state.

•  Reorganize the subcommittee to more efficiently address the various educational needs for both 
public and OJD staff.  We have created separate workgroups to plan both the family law and 
facilitator conferences.  The benefits are twofold, allowing us to add subject matter experts from 
outside the subcommittee to participate in each workgroup, and as a result, creating more time 
for the main subcommittee to devote to other projects that conference planning would 
previously consume. 

•  Complete updates to the “How to Serve Legal Papers in Oregon” pamphlet  
•  Plan and conduct the Facilitator Conference, scheduled for September 16, 2022 in Salem 
•  Support JFCPD by providing engaging and relevant discussion topics and training content for 

the monthly facilitator meetings.

•  Providing practical and relevant training materials to apply at a statewide level while 

recognizing the size, demographics, and local court rules vary widely between jurisdictions 
•  Finding the financial and technological support to produce web based educational resources

•  Staff and Administrators are busy with the roller coaster of changes and backload of cases 

resulting from the pandemic 

What additional support would lend itself to improving the work of your subcommittee?   The 
change management series organized by Nanci Thaemert was quite helpful to provide tools and 
education to lead a subcommittee.  It also provided time to engage with other subcommittee chairs.  I 
found this opportunity quite valuable.  The Chairs would appreciate future opportunities for this type 
of engagement. 

oes your subcommittee evaluate the needs of self-represented litigants within the framework of 
your projects?  The subcommittee has made the needs of SRLs a priority.  The facilitator conference 
aims to better educate facilitators about methods and resources to help self-represented litigants.  The 
subcommittee has made it a priority to keep resources for SRLs current and relevant, such as the 
“Divorce and Custody Trials in Oregon” and “How to Serve Legal Papers in Oregon” pamphlets. 

hat are the subcommittee’s top accomplishments over the past five years?  
•  The  update  and  redesign  of  the  trial  preparation  pamphlet,  “Divorce  and  Custody  Trials  in 
Oregon.” The updated version includes new graphics, changes to laws and programs, such as 
IDRT and is  reorganized with  appendices  for litigants  to  access  applicable  information more 
efficiently.  The pamphlet is available in both English and Spanish. 

•  The subcommittee planned and implemented statewide family law conferences in 2017, 2019 

and 2021 despite the challenges presented by the pandemic.  Conference materials are 
available on the OJD website Family Law Program page. 

•  The subcommittee planned and implemented the statewide facilitator conference in April 2018.  
The April 2020 in-person event was cancelled due to the pandemic however the subcommittee 
successfully transitioned to provide the planned sessions in segments during the Monthly 
Facilitator Meetings.  All sessions are recorded and available on Sharepoint.  The agenda 
included the following presentations:

Any additional information you would like to share about your subcommittee experience:  The 
work of this subcommittee requires actively involved participants.  It has been slow to develop 
engaging subcommittee participants who are willing to take on projects or assignments between 
meetings.  This might be due to the combination of multiple new members joining at the same time as 
we were navigating the pandemic.  It appears we are emerging from this and have more actively 
engaged participants who are feeling more confident in meeting participation.

What is the goal/focus of the subcommittee in 2021?   The focus of our committee in 2021 has 
been performance measures, specifically post judgment. Data entry consistency and accuracy. 
We have always prioritized the data reports that can be obtained and developed from the 
Odyssey case management to provide information to OJD, our community partners, and the 
legislature to further the mission and goals of the OJD.  

hat are the subcommittee’s top short-term priorities? We have prioritized the data reports 

we are interested in, some of the reports will take longer to develop to have the data we are 
wanting long term. In the meantime, the subcommittee is working on additional codes needed in 
Odyssey to obtain the data we think is most important. We thought the code for post judgment

was ‘a go’ as of January 1, 2022 but appears it has been delayed due to the new Odyssey roll out.  
Our next meeting will include an update on where we are with code initiation.        

hat are the subcommittee’s top long-term priorities? We have a long list of data that we 
feel is important for the OJD and legislature going forward. For example, getting accurate data 
on post judgment cases in family law. This is an enormous workload for the staff and judges, 
however there is not currently a way to accurately pull that data from Odyssey. Our long term 
goal is to develop reports and queries that will allow us to pull that data. We are also very 
interested in pulling facilitation program data and determining how can we capture the data in 
which we are interested. This data includes whether a facilitator was contacted for assistance, 
and, if so, at what state of the case?  Did having a facilitator involved assist cases with statutory 
timelines as well as time to disposition?            

hat are the subcommittee’s top accomplishments?  

Our immediate priority list has allowed Conor to pull data on mediation and protected person 
cases and get that information to the trial courts where there are data entry errors, so the courts 
can correct the data going into the Odyssey system and have better data. Conor and Ryan have 
also presented to the TCA’s what our committee is doing, why the data is important and Conor 
has gone over the data reports explaining data entry concerns. The TCA’s are on board with 
making sure the data is accurate. 
The information above in italics was in our prior report, however it is still relevant. Conor has 
been able to accomplish so many items on our wish list already. This past year, our 
accomplishments include a new codes to capture post-judgment data, and a move toward 
performance measures for Modifications, Contempt, and Enforcement.    

hat are the challenges for courts in implementing the recommendations from the 

subcommittee? The biggest challenge is training, consistency, and time.  To have accurate data, 
court staff need to be trained and the trial courts need to be consistent in how the data entry is 
performed.  If there is an issue with the data, the courts need to have the time to review and 
correct. We also have time conflicts within the subcommittee, and this has limited our ability to 
meet regularly. Our members have numerous requests for their time, and it can be a struggle to 
schedule meetings. The positive, though, is that all members are committed to this subcommittee 
and when we do meet things are accomplished.     

hat additional support would lend itself to improving the work of your subcommittee?  I 

don’t believe additional support is necessary as far as staff.   The nice way our subcommittee 
works is we meet and then Conor, Jessica and Yousef can go and look into the data and take our 
ideas and requests and make them a reality. A wider conversation with data needs might be a 
good thing; The CJ and Nancy Cozine, to confirm we are on the right track for any data needed 
at the legislative and OSCA level. A conversation with TCAs to confirm we are looking at the 
data the trial courts would be interested in obtaining. 

oes your subcommittee evaluate the needs of self-represented litigants within the 

framework of your projects?  Always looking at how the data can assist us in determining how 
to provide access, and resources for self-represented litigants.

hat has been the goal/focus of the subcommittee in 2021?  At the end of 2022, we adopted 

a mission statement. 
The Futures Subcommittee remains committed to its vision to reimagine "Court" as a service and 
process rather than a specific place where trials and hearings occur.  By so doing, we strive to 
imagine and assist to implement avenues for more and better legal services. Specific focuses 
include:  

  Optimizing existing court personnel and resources: This commitment includes the transition 
from an assumption of resolution through trials/hearings to one that utilizes the wealth of 
experienced judges, excellent court personnel and underutilized prior innovations. 
 

•  Placing a focus on early and frequent intervention in legal disputes: This focus is designed to 
encourage swifter case conclusion that avoids the long-term collateral damage of protracted 
court proceedings. 

  Embracing ideas, innovations, and lessons learned throughout the Covid-19 pandemic: 

Recent changes to our courts and the way we interface with end-users have the capacity to 
both redefine and improve our legal system to better serve the majority of self-represented 
Oregonians. 

  Continuing examination and innovation of established rules and procedures: This focus 
ensures we are informing future projects with an eye on what is in place today and areas

where things are operating smoothly versus areas where we can better meet and address 
the typical court customers. 
 

What are the subcommittee’s top short-term priorities (within the next year)? 
Expand Use of Informal Domestic Relations Trials (IDRT’s). The Futures Subcommittee is 
undertaking several initiatives to expand the use of IDRT’s and better track their existing use 
especially among self-represented litigants.   

reate an Alternative Substitute Service to Notice by Publication. The subcommittee is 

considering a proposal for a court webpage to provide service by publication as an alternative to 
publication requirements in print newspapers.  The initiative is being pursued by other 
jurisdictions to ease the expense burden for petitioners and ensure actual notice for respondents.  
The use of court websites provides greater reliability than other social media sites and provides a 
centralized location for respondents.  

emote Access Initiative. The Futures Subcommittee is continuing to provide support for the 
Remote Access Initiative delayed in some counties by the pandemic. Ongoing efforts include the 
transition to a statewide Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) by the Enterprise Technology 
Division that will ensure a consistent and uniform phone system/number for utilization in 
Remote Facilitation. The subcommittee is continuing to track improved participation rates 
reported by counties to support the efficacy this program can deliver to courts. In addition, the 
subcommittee is examining other forms of facilitation technology such as Artificial Intelligence 
(chat bots) and help desk resources. 

emote Proceedings. The Futures Subcommittee is continuing to gather data and propose 
solutions to refine and enhance remote hearings and trials following the relaxation of the 
pandemic restrictions as we returned to in person proceedings to determine where, when and 
how to continue availability for remote proceedings to reduce barriers to individuals who have 
historically had difficulty engaging in the process due to childcare, transportation, employment 
and other complications.  

emote Access Best Practices. The Futures Subcommittee is examining enhanced remote access 
to support services personnel such as custody evaluators, parenting coordinators, mediators etc. 

mplementation of Change Leadership Strategies. The subcommittee is utilizing knowledge and 
tools learned through the Change Leadership training to enhance the projects and work of the 
Futures Subcommittee. 

hat are the subcommittee’s top long-term priorities (within the next 5 years)? 

Continue efforts to facilitate remote access to courts in appropriate areas that expand beyond 
facilitation services  

romote systems that support access to justice (e.g., improvement and expansion of court 
websites as repositories for self-represented litigants including notice by publication, IDRT 
information, pilot program for allowing litigants to self-schedule court appearances such as 
status conferences, etc.).

dentify case type specific triage that will target and streamline processes to provide early and 
frequent interventions that will help resolve cases without resorting to drawn-out litigation that 
ends in trials and hearings. Examples include case conferences, judicial settlement conferences, 
interim relief through written submissions, etc. 

ontinue to examine innovations across national and international jurisdictions to identify 
initiatives that are increasing the access to justice and evaluate for adoption and innovations 
tailored to Oregon. 

ontinue to identify and promote strategies to facilitate access to justice through unbundling by 

both attorneys and the courts (enhanced access to judicial resources in the form of status 
conferences, settlement conferences, streamlined interim relief such as temporary support on 
pleadings, etc.) 

hat are the subcommittee’s current projects and timelines for completion? 

IDRT Expansion. These efforts include improving the accuracy of tracking and other date 
refinements through clerical training/familiarity of coding, including consideration of the timing 
of capture to ensure that “conversions” from traditional to IDRT’s on the day of trial. 

DRT Expansion. The Futures Subcommittee is examining revisions to the UTCR to improve the 
waiver process (during remote proceedings, written versus on the record), and opt-in versus opt-
out processes. The end of Q4 is the target date for the UTCR rule revision proposal. 

 

 

DRT Expansion Revision of the state-wide IDRT brochure is being examined, working in 
tandem with the Portland State University linguistics/communication department to ensure 
greater clarity and understanding for self-represented litigants. The end of Q3 is the target date 
for a revised brochure. 

Notice by Publication. This project is in its initial phase. The subcommittee will be researching 
the results of other jurisdictions to gather data about operational challenges and successes as it 
considers the most effective way to implement this change. The Futures Subcommittee will be 
exploring the technical aspects of implementing a service page on district websites across the 
state. 

est Practices for Remote Proceedings. The subcommittee is evaluating surveys and other forms 

of engagement to create a “best practices” sheet that will provide both litigants, attorneys and 
OJD staff tips and tools to minimize detractions from remote proceedings. 

What are the challenges identified by your subcommittee in furthering your prioritized 
work?  
The greatest challenge in implementing the recommendations from the subcommittee is that the 
legal industry is entrenched in a preference for the status quo. This is not a new dynamic. The 
legal industry has long lagged behind private business when it comes to embracing new 
technologies and changing practices to better suit an increasingly diverse demographic of users. 
But as technology continues to advance at an ever-increasing pace, users have different

expectations for what their interactions and experiences with courts will look like. Users of today 
prefer text messages to emails and would rather click a button on an online form than talk to a 
person behind a desk. The court needs to recognize these changes in how its constituents desire 
to interface, and pivot to accommodate these desires in a way that ensures better access to justice 
for all Oregonians – particularly in underserved populations. 

hen changes are made, they must be made, to the extent possible, on a uniform basis. It is 
difficult for the consumer (and those attempting to serve the consumer) to navigate an already 
confusing and difficult process when simple things like status conferences or temporary motions 
are handled differently on a county-to-county basis. Yet because our industry is entrenched in a 
long-standing desire to embrace the status quo, such moves to uniformity are often met with 
resistance at a county level. Education and encouragement will be a critical part. 

hat are the challenges for courts in implementing the recommendations from the 

subcommittee? 
The diversity of our jurisdictions in terms of resources and environmental realities has been a 
challenge to the recommendations for uniformity in the early phases of initiatives for both 
implantation, evaluation and iteration. Similarly, the industry-wide preference for the status quo 
and skepticism about technology continue to encumber more sweeping changes and initiatives. 

hat additional support would lend itself to improving the work of your subcommittee?  

Enhanced cross-committee communication and shared roles in projects will enhance capacity 
and output by leveraging common efforts and unique expertise. For example, collaboration with 
the education and mediation subcommittees on expansion of IDRT materials and training will 
ensure that first points of contact (facilitators, mediators, court staff) have the training and tools 
to effectively communicate the benefits of IDRT’s. Similarly, collaboration between futures and 
data will support better capture of data points essential to Futures Subcommittee practices. 

oes your subcommittee evaluate the needs of self-represented litigants within the 

framework of your projects?  
The needs of self-represented litigants are essential to our mission and are the lens through which 
our projects and efforts are focused. While the ease of use for other stakeholders (court 
personnel, OJD staff, judges and the bar) is essential to the success of Futures’ projects, access to 
justice considerations start with self-represented parties. 

hat are the subcommittee’s top accomplishments over the past five years?  

Mission Statement:  The Subcommittee created a mission statement to inform and enhance our 
initiatives. 

emote Facilitation Initiative: Unfortunately, and ironically, the launch of the Remote Access 
Initiative was delayed in some counties by the pandemic. Other counties have fully embraced 
remote facilitation. Ongoing efforts include the transition to a statewide Voice Over Internet 
Protocol (VOIP) by the Enterprise Technology Division that will ensure a consistent and uniform 
phone system/number for utilization in Remote Facilitation. The improved participation rate 
reported by some counties is a testament to the success this program can deliver to courts (e.g., 
Lane County reduced its “no show” rate from 14.65% in 2019 to 6.2% in 2020.

emote Proceedings:   The Futures Subcommittee is continuing to gather data and propose 

solutions to refine, enhance and improve remote hearings and trials. This focus includes 
solutions to the current pandemic-driven processes and proposals for how to ensure that post-
pandemic courts are best able to reduce barriers to individuals who have historically had 
difficulty engaging in the process due to childcare, transportation, employment and other 
complications. Also under consideration is a process to permit expanded use of remote 
proceedings where both parties opt in to ease the burden on litigants: self-represented individuals 
who may have barriers to participation (child care, time away from work, transportation, etc.); 
represented individuals have seen a reduction of attorneys’ fees due to the removal of driving 
and waiting for cases as well as expanded access to attorneys located in other parts of the state 
when travel costs are removed. 

omprehensive Report to the Chief:  In the fall of 2020, the Futures Subcommittee, on behalf of 

the State Family Law Advisory Committee, recommended procedural modifications in light of 
the Chief Justice’s COVID-19 Orders. These recommendations were offered to: (1) maintain 
health and safety of litigants and court employees during the pandemic; (2) promote access to 
justice; (3) ensure the continuing efficient delivery of court connected conflict resolution 
services, both during the pandemic and continuing in the future. That report offered suggestions 
to maintain and, where necessary, modify existing processes, tools and approaches. In addition, 
and in light of the innovation imperative of the pandemic, the recommendations proposed 
broader solutions to meet existing barriers to access to justice with the widely and recently 
adopted technologies. The Futures Subcommittee intends to build upon this momentum of rapid 
adoption of technology and new paradigms to better serve Oregonians by removal of barriers to 
justice. 

FLAC  2021 Conference:  Futures Subcommittee members presented workshops in both the 

morning and afternoon session dealing with remote services and IDRTs/alternative dispute 
resolution approaches. 

ny additional information you would like to share about your subcommittee experience: 
The Future’s Subcommittee comprehensive report to the Chief underscored both the importance 
and feasibility of the Futures Subcommittee work. That experience and the pandemic as a whole 
illustrated the practical imperatives of the more abstract aspirational goals of the Futures 
Subcommittee in real time. Being empowered to recommend action during that crisis was a true 
inspiration.  The Futures Subcommittee Chair and Vice-Chair can think of no better evidence of 
the necessity of the Futures Subcommittee work. 

iven SFLAC’s (and its subcommittees) commitment to supporting a family law system 
that serves all families, is there a perspective, voice, or subject matter expertise that you 
believe is missing from the SFLAC or your subcommittee?  
Futures has one of the larger memberships among the subcommittees that has created a broad 
perspective and diversity of voices.  The cross-committee collaboration that is currently being 
promoted inherently expands the perspectives to inform and assist Futures Subcommittee 
initiatives.

Any suggestions for improved management or operation of the SFLAC at large?  
Use of remote meetings by the SFLAC is both leadership by example and has eased 
participation. Continuing recruitment of subcommittee membership will ensure continuing 
participation by a wider range of community partners and statewide voices which flows up to 
and benefits the SFLAC as a whole. 

EMBERSHIP SUBCOMMITTEE – Fall Report 2021 

hair:  Debra Dority (Oregon Law Center attorney, Statewide)  

 

 
Members:  Stephen Adams (Mediator, Wallowa County), Colleen Carter-Cox (Program 
Coordinator, Lane County) Hon. Karrie McIntyre (Lane County) 

 

What has been the goal/focus of the subcommittee in 2021?  
Recommending and vetting nominees for the SFLAC membership to ensure a diverse, qualified 
and hard-working group.  In addition, the Membership Committee was tasked with considering 
input on the platform of future SFLAC meetings, subject to OJD approval.  As a result, we 
surveyed the members and ultimately recommended that three of the four quarterly SFLAC 
meetings remain virtual, while the fourth meeting (likely the March or June meeting) be an in-
person, all-day mini retreat.    

hat are the subcommittee’s top short-term priorities (within the next year)? 

Presently, we are working on creation of a handbook that can be utilized to better onboard and 
establish expectations for new members.   

hat are the subcommittee’s top long-term priorities (within the next 5 years)?The 

Membership Committee’s future goals include outlining how best to engage those with expertise 
and interest to contribute and get involved in the SFLAC, SFLAC Subcommittees, or 
Subcommittee Workgroups.  We are also focusing on the creation of onboarding resources for 
new SFLAC members.  In addition, our priority will be to work toward our goal of creating a 
more diverse SFLAC membership. 

n addition, the Membership Committee renewed its commitment to ensuring that SFLAC 
supports successful family law policies, reforms and programs that serve all individuals and 
families who access Oregon’s courts. We recognize we can do so only with a diverse 
membership. We therefore reached out to a number of the affinity/diversity bars and encouraged 
Black, Indigenous, Latinx and persons of color; LGBTQIA2+ individuals; veterans; persons with 
disabilities; and persons from other traditionally underrepresented communities who may be 
interested in serving on the SFLAC to apply.

What are the subcommittee’s current projects and timelines for completion?We are 
presently working on the handbook and continue to consider, and interview interested persons 
that submit Membership Inquiry Forms.   

hat are the challenges identified by your subcommittee in furthering your prioritized 

work? In our work to ensure the SFLAC is as diverse as the families who access Oregon’s 
family courts, we have struggled with making some meaningful connections with those who may 
diversify the SFLAC.  We will continue to work on making a space where others feel 
comfortable sitting at the table but could use some additional support in identifying new 
members.   {see below section on ‘additional support’}. 

hat are the challenges for courts in implementing the recommendations from the 

subcommittee? 
N/A 

hat additional support would lend itself to improving the work of your subcommittee?  
The work of Valerie Colas (& others doing the important DEI work at OJD), and in particular the 
connections and discussions with community partners outside of OJD, can help us to identify 
what voices we are missing at the table.  Any recommendations or resources that can be shared 
from that work would help us improve the work of the Membership Subcommittee.     

oes your subcommittee evaluate the needs of self-represented litigants within the 

framework of your projects?  
In working to become as diverse as those who access Oregon Courts, we center all litigants, 
including and especially self-represented litigants. 

hat are the subcommittee’s top accomplishments over the past five years?  

The Membership Committee has enlisted and recommended top-quality candidates to the 
SFLAC.   

iven SFLAC’s (and its subcommittees) commitment to supporting a family law system 
that serves all families, is there a perspective, voice, or subject matter expertise that you

subcommittee work as well as the SFLAC at large.

hat has been the goal/focus of the subcommittee in 2021?  

The Child Support Subcommittee has been on hiatus for the last few years due to the demands on 
the Department of Justice and Oregon Child Support Program with its system modernization 
project and business processes, which was immediately followed by the demand on the program 
with the pandemic. The subcommittee is now re-forming, and most members have been 
identified—some continuing, some new—including a new co-chair. Recruitment for a few more 
members and perspectives is underway. An organizational meeting is planned within a few 
weeks to solidify a meeting cadence and identify short- and long-term goals and priorities. 

hat are the subcommittee’s top short-term priorities (within the next year)? 

The primary short-term priority will be supporting OJD in the development, implementation, and 
launch of the child support referee initiative, with a particular focus on education and outreach. 

hat are the subcommittee’s top long-term priorities (within the next 5 years)? 
Because the re-forming subcommittee has not yet set long-term priorities, they cannot be 
identified with certainty. However, it’s anticipated that the subcommittee will continue support, 
education, and expansion of the child support referee initiative. Other possible long-term 
priorities include development and establishment of child support-specific education and CLEs 
for target audiences, especially the bench, family court facilitators, and trial court administrators. 
Another possible priority in the long term is development of support materials (including videos) 
for self-represented child support parties navigating the judicial process. 

hat are the subcommittee’s current projects and timelines for completion? 

While these are yet mostly to be determined, because the child support referee “go-live” date is 
January 2023, this project and timeline are driving the subcommittee’s initial work.

Not at this time. 

FUTURE WORK OF THE SFLAC 

t our quarterly meetings the SFLAC continues to diligently vet the work that is being done by 

the subcommittees with a hope to continue to provide the statutory advisory opinion to the 
Oregon Judicial Department and to significantly and positively shape family law policy for the 
State of Oregon to benefit the families who interact with the Court system. We have learned so 
much during the Covid Pandemic about what is possible when those dedicated to this work think 
creatively.  The future work of the SFLAC will include considering what pieces of the new 
structures should be retained, how they should be improved, and what other process should and 
can be implemented.  We continue to actively engage in the work necessary to improve the 
family law system all Oregon’s families.
