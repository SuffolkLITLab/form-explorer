Introduction 

This document has been prepared to help persons aspiring to become certified court interpreters 
understand what the written test measures, how it is administered, and how to prepare for taking 
the  exam.  Each  examinee  should  study  this  overview  thoroughly  in  order  to  be  more  fully 
prepared for the written exam. 

The written examination is only one part of the process for becoming a certified or approved 
court  interpreter.  Passing  this  test  does  not  mean  a  person  has  become  a  “certified  court 
interpreter;” rather, it means the examinee has met one of several requirements for certification. 

The written test measures candidates’ knowledge of three areas central to the work of a court 
interpreter at the level of a minimally qualified court interpreter: 

1.  English  Language.  To  function  as  a  professional  court  interpreter,  one  indispensable 
component  is  a  high  degree  of  proficiency  in  the  English  language.  Accordingly,  the  written 
examination assumes a high degree of literacy in the English language and familiarity with a range 
of language constructions. It tests comprehension of written English vocabulary and idioms. 

2.  Court-Related  Terms  and  Usage.  A  second  area  of  knowledge  essential  to  successful 
professional performance is familiarity with the terminology and procedures of the court system. 
Accordingly,  the  written  examination  also  measures  recognition  of  common  court-  related 
situations and vocabulary, especially in the area of criminal courts. 

3.  Ethics and Professional Conduct. The third area of knowledge required of professional court 
interpreters  encompassed  in  the  written  test  is  general  knowledge  of  standards  guiding  the 
performance  of  duties.  Accordingly,  the  written  exam  includes  questions  aimed  at  measuring 
candidates’ knowledge of ethical behavior and professional conduct. 

What does the test look like? 

The examination contains 135 multiple-choice questions. Each question has four choices, labeled 
A, B, C, and D.  The candidate is instructed to select the best choice and mark that choice on the 
answer sheet (the specific form of the answer sheet will vary by state). 

The test has two parts: 

Part I:  General Language Proficiency, and 
Part II: Court-Related Terms & Usage, and Ethics & Professional Conduct. 

[ 1 ] 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

Within  each  part  there  are  several  sections,  each  of  which  contains  a  particular  category  of 
questions.  There are specific instructions for how to proceed at the beginning of each section.  A 
complete list of the sections, including one or more sample questions for each, is provided in 
Appendix A. 

How          will  the  test  be           scheduled - What     do  I  need  to  know? 

[ 2 ] 

An official of the state where you are taking the exam will notify you in writing by mail or e-mail 
a minimum of two weeks before the test date. The notice will advise you when and where to 
report for the test and may include directions to the test site. 

Arrive early. No one will be admitted late. There are no exceptions and no one arriving late for 
any reason will be able to take the test at that test session. 

Only small purses or wallets are allowed in the testing room. Leave everything else at home or in 
your car. Do not try to bring briefcases, laptops or tablets, dictionaries, gym bags, cell phones, 
water,  calculators,  key  fobs,  watches  or  other  timepieces,  paper,  pens,  pencils,  or  any  other 
similar items into the test room as you will not be admitted to the test room with them.  Pencils 
will be provided in the test room. 

There may be a registration area where you will report and sign in. In the testing room, there will 
be a test administration supervisor, and there may be another test proctor present to assist. 

Use the restroom prior to entering the testing room. If you ask to leave the testing room after 
the  test  has  begun,  you  will  be  instructed  to  leave  all  of  your  test  materials  with  the  test 
administration supervisor prior to leaving the room. You may be escorted to the restroom to 
ensure that you do not use a cell phone or converse with other individuals while you are  outside 
of the testing room. No more than one candidate will be allowed to leave the testing room at the 
same time. No adjustments to the time allotted for completion of the exam will be made for any 
time you are outside of the testing room. 

   

Special Accommodations for Americans with Disabilities 

If you have a disability recognized by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), you must request 
special  accommodation  in  advance.  In  order  to  do  that,  you  should  complete  the  attached 
Request  for  Special  Accommodation  and  submit  it  to  the  director  of  the  court  interpreting 
program in your state as far ahead of the test date as possible. You must describe your disability 
and describe the type or kind of accommodation you are requesting. In addition, you must submit 
a statement from an appropriate professional documenting the diagnosis or evaluation of your 
disability. 

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

How will the test be administered? 

The administration protocol, described below, is recommended practice. It is specifically noted 
here that, from state to state, there may be some deviation from the exact recommendation. 
However, the protocol described will, in large part, reflect administration practices. 

In most states, the test will be given in classroom style to a number of candidates at the same 
time in the same room.  A test administration supervisor, who is responsible for oversight of the 
entire  test  administration  process,  will  decide  what  staff  members  are  present  to  assist  with 
proctoring the examination. 

Seating will be assigned. Depending upon the seating arrangements, some candidates may be 
asked to move from one seat and occupy another. If this happens, it is for test security measures 
and the candidates should not be troubled or concerned. 

Security of the test materials is obviously essential. Examinees may not take notes or copy any 
portion of the exam. 

Proctors  will  monitor  candidates  throughout  the  examination  to  prevent  cheating  and,  if 
cheating occurs, detect and deal with it. They may circulate throughout the room, but they will 
not  disturb  the  examinees.  If  a  proctor  suspects  that  an  examinee  is  cheating  in  any  way, 
including  giving  or  receiving  assistance  during  the  examination,  communicating  with  others, 
retaining or copying examination questions, or using prohibited devices or aids, the proctor will 
follow specific protocol for addressing the situation. 

If an examinee is disruptive, engages in clear or flagrant cheating, or attempts to copy questions 
or  retain  or  record  test  materials,  the  examinee  may  be  expelled  from  the  testing  room  and 
advised that his or her examination will not be scored. Documentation of the expulsion and the 
reasons for it will be maintained by the state. 

Once  all  examinees  are  seated  for  the  exam,  the  test  administrator  will  hand  out  materials 
packets  and  two  pencils  to  each  person.  He  or  she  will  read  scripted  instructions  to  the 
examinees in order to ensure that all candidates receive the same instructions each time the 
examination is given. Then the examinees will be directed to read and execute an Agreement 
and Oath Form. Next, examinees will prepare their answer sheets by entering their name and ID 
number, the test date, and the test site. Examinees must listen to the instructions carefully and 
must not begin the examination until the test administration supervisor says, “You may begin.” 

Candidates are allowed two hours and fifteen minutes to complete the examination. A clock will 
be provided in each testing room to assist candidates. Fifteen minutes before the end of the test, 
the test administrator will make the following announcement out loud: “You have fifteen minutes 
remaining.” 

[ 3 ] 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

At the beginning of each section there are instructions on how to answer the questions in that 
section. As examinees work their way through the test, they should carefully read the instructions 
for each section to be sure they understand how to answer that section’s questions.  The types 
of instructions you will find will be to select the answer that: 

Is closest in meaning; 

o 
o  Most appropriately completes a sentence; 
o  Best answers a question or provides the best solution to a situation; 
o  Has the correct sequence of events; or 
o 

Is opposite in meaning. 

See Appendix A for sample questions from the various sections of the exam. 

What is the passing score? 

In order to pass the test, 80 percent of the items must be answered correctly. That means the 
examinee must answer at least 108 of the 135 items correctly in order to pass. The state’s test 
administration supervisor will ordinarily advise the examinee of the results of his or her test by 
mail or e-mail. Reminder: Passing this test does not mean you are now a “certified” or “approved” 
court interpreter. 

What can I do to prepare for the test? 

A list of possible activities and resources has been compiled to help you identify actions you can 
take to help prepare for the exam. Some of the resources may help you decide whether you are 
ready to participate in a test of this nature.  The list is attached and marked as Appendix B. 

What if I don’t pass the exam? 

This written examination is constructed to measure entry-level knowledge of 

  English general vocabulary, 
  common words and phrases likely to be heard in court, 
  the typical progression of cases through the court system, and 
  provisions of a code of professional responsibility 

that a minimally competent person entering the court interpreting field would need.

If you do not pass the exam, it is suggested that you resist the temptation to simply register to 
retake the exam. Experience shows that retaking an examination of this kind within a short time 
period will not substantially change the results. Instead, you are encouraged to review the section 
of this Overview entitled “What can I do to prepare for the test?” and Appendix B, and engage in 
some reading and preparatory study before retaking the examination. 

The time frame within which you can register to retake the written examination varies from state 
to state. Check with your state’s interpreting program manager, administrator, or coordinator to 
find out details. It is recommended to every state that no candidate should take the same test 
more than once in a calendar year and in no event, more than twice.

[Appendix 3] 

Preparing for the test 

If you are not familiar with taking written, multiple-choice tests, you may find it beneficial 
to: 

1.  Review instructions and suggestions on taking multiple-choice tests such as the Federal 
Court Interpreter Certification Examination (FCICE) – Phase One Written Examination. 
2.  Study preparation material developed for similar exams, such as the TOEFL, or even take 

ith respect to Part I, General Language Proficiency, one needs to have a very broad 

command of the English language.  That is not something that is quickly or easily acquired.  
However, some of the following activities might be helpful in expanding one’s knowledge 
of the English language and preparing for the test: 

1.  Take upper-level English courses at a college or university. 
2.  Read widely such items as books and professional journals in many fields, 
American literature, and editorials and articles in major newspapers. 

3.  Brush up on English vocabulary and lexical concepts (go back to the basics and 

review antonyms, synonyms, and idioms).

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
