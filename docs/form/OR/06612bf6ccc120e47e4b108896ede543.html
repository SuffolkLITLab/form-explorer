RELEASE 

   

 

) ) ) ) )

 

 

 

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE STATE OF OREGON 
 
FOR LINCOLN COUNTY 

In the Matter of Pre-Trial Release 

 

 

WHEREAS, the 2021 Legislative Assembly enacted Oregon Laws 2021, Chapter 643, 

initially introduced as Senate Bill 48 (2021) by the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission, to 
reduce reliance on security release and provide statewide guidance for local pretrial release 
orders; and  
 

WHEREAS, ORS 135.233 provides the presiding judge of a judicial district to enter a 

standing pretrial release order, specifying to the sheriff of the county, or to the entity supervising 
the local correctional facility responsible for pretrial incarceration within the judicial district, 
those persons and the offenses: 

1)  Subject to release on recognizance; 
2)  Subject to release with special conditions of release as specified in the 

3)  Not eligible for release until arraignment. 

order; and 

 

WHEREAS, the Chief Justice issued guidelines for presiding judge pretrial orders. 

Additionally, the Chief Justice entered Chief Justice Order 22-010 that requires each presiding 
judge of circuit court to enter a standing pretrial release order as required under ORS 135.233(1) 
that complies with the guidelines established by Chief Justice Order 22-010 with an operative 
date of July 1, 2022. This Order accomplishes that mandate. 
 

THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED the Lincoln County Sheriff shall comply 

with all provisions outlined in this pretrial release order as follows: 
 

 

ECTION 1:  RELEASE DECISION PROCESS: 

To balance the rights of the defendant and presumption of pretrial release against 
community and victim safety and the risk of failure to appear, this order implements a two-step 
release process to be followed by the sheriff in making all release decisions: 
 

1 

 

 

 

 
 

  S

 

 

•  Step 1:  Identify the charge and release category; 
•  Step 2: Determine if the defendant meets the criteria to consider overriding 

circumstances and what, if any, enhanced conditions of release should be ordered.  

Step 1 is Identifying the charge and release guideline category each Oregon felony 

and misdemeanor falls into.  The current Release Guidelines Categorization List is maintained by 
the State Court Administrator of the Oregon Judicial Department and may be found here: List of 
Offenses by Guideline.  The Release Guidelines Categorization List is intended as a tool to assist 
the sheriff, with the application of the release guidelines established in this order. The Release 
Guidelines Categorization List is hereby incorporated into this Order.  

 

 

Attached to this Order is Exhibit A to be used in Step 2, which includes a chart of 

overriding circumstances to be considered and if a defendant meets the criteria of the 
overriding circumstance, the action that should be taken with regard to the release decision.  
Exhibit A is hereby incorporated into this Order.  

Attached to this Order is Exhibit B, also to be used in Step 2, which includes enhanced 
conditions of release.  These enhanced conditions of release shall be used if, after identifying 
the charge and release category, it is determined that there are overriding circumstances which 
require enhanced conditions of release.  Exhibit B is hereby incorporated into this Order.
