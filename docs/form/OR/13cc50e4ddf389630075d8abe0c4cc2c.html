 CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT 

UDICIAL  COUNCIL  COMMITTEE'S  NOTE,  1979:    The  following  rules,  called  the  code  of 
judicial ethics, govern the members of the Wisconsin judiciary.  These rules were originally adopted 
by  the  supreme  court  on  November  14,  1967,  effective  January  1,  1968.    They  were  amended  on 
June 28, 1974; December 23, 1977, March 16, 1978; March 28, 1978; and November 20, 1979.  The 
rules were originally numbered standards 1 to 16 and rules 1 to 17.  They have been clarified and 
numbered 60.001 to 60.19 for uniformity and convenience. 

PREAMBLE 

Our  legal  system  is  based  on  the  principle  that  an  independent, 
fair  and  competent  judiciary  will  interpret  and  apply  the  laws  that 
govern us.  The role of the judiciary is central to American concepts of 
justice and the rule of law.  Intrinsic to all provisions of this Code are 
the precepts that judges, individually and collectively, must respect and 
honor  the  judicial  office  as  a  public  trust  and  strive  to  enhance  and 
maintain confidence in our legal system.  The judge is an arbiter of facts 
and  law  for  the  resolution  of  disputes  and  a  highly  visible  symbol  of 
government under the rule of law. 
 
The rules of the Code of Judicial Conduct are authoritative.  The 
Commentary, has three varying functions:  1) to elaborate a standard in 
the rules; 2) to set forth policy bases for the rules; or 3) by explanation 
and  example,  to  provide  guidance  with  respect  to  the  purpose  and 
meaning of the rules.  The Commentary is not intended as a statement 
of additional rules.   
 
When the text of a rule uses "shall," "shall not" or "may not," it is 
intended to impose binding obligations the violation of which can result 
in disciplinary action.   For a judge's conduct to constitute a violation of 
a rule, the judge must have known or reasonably should have known the 
facts giving rise to the violation. 
The  use  of  "should"  or  "should  not"  in  the  rules  is  intended  to 
 
encourage or discourage specific conduct and as a statement of what is 
or  is  not  appropriate  conduct  but  not  as  a  binding  rule  under  which  a 
judge may be disciplined.  When "may" is used, it denotes permissible 
discretion  or,  depending  on  the  context,  it  refers  to  action  that  is  not 
covered by specific proscriptions.   
 
reason. 
 

The  provisions  of  the  Code  of  Judicial  Conduct  are  rules  of 
  They  should  be  applied  consistent  with  constitutional 

228 

 
 

    J

   

   

requirements,  statutes,  other  court  rules  and  decisional  law  and  in  the 
context of all relevant circumstances.  The Code is to be construed so as 
not  to  impinge  on  the  essential  independence  of  judges  in  making 
judicial decisions.   
 
The  Code  is  designed  to  provide  guidance  to  judges  and 
candidates  for  judicial  office  and  to  provide  a  structure  for  regulating 
conduct through disciplinary agencies.  It is not designed or intended as 
a  basis  for  civil  liability  or  criminal  prosecution.    Furthermore,  the 
purpose of the Code would be subverted if the Code were invoked by 
lawyers or litigants for mere tactical advantage in a proceeding.   
 
The  provisions  of  the  Code  are  intended  to  govern  conduct  of 
judges and to be binding upon them.  It is not intended, however, that 
every  transgression  will  result  in  disciplinary  action.    Whether 
disciplinary  action  is  appropriate,  and  the  degree  of  discipline  to  be 
imposed,  should  be  determined  through  a  reasonable  and  reasoned 
application  of  the  text  and  should  depend  on  such  factors  as  the 
seriousness of the transgression, whether there is a pattern of improper 
activity  and  the  effect  of  the  improper  activity  on  others  or  on  the 
judicial system.  See ABA Standards Relating to Judicial Discipline and 
Disability Retirement.   
Because it is not possible to address every conceivable conduct of 
 
a 
integrity, 
independence  and  impartiality  of  the  judiciary,  some  of  the  binding 
rules of  the  Code are  cast  in general  terms  setting  forth the principles 
their specific provisions are intended to foster.  See, for example, SCR 
60.02,  60.03(1)  and  60.05(1)  and  accompanying  Comments.    Those 
rules  provide  a  touchstone  against  which  judicial  conduct,  actual  or 
contemplated,  is  to  be  measured.    Care  must  be  taken  that  the  Code's 
necessarily general rules do not constitute a trap for the unwary judge or 
a weapon to be wielded unscrupulously against a judge.   
 
The  Code  of  Judicial  Conduct  is  not  intended  as  an  exhaustive 
guide for the conduct of judges.  They should also be governed in their 
judicial and personal conduct by general ethical standards.  The Code is 
intended,  however,  to  state  basic  standards  which  should  govern  the 
conduct  of  all  judges  and  to  provide  guidance  to  assist  judges  in 
establishing  and  maintaining  high  standards  of  judicial  and  personal 
conduct.

An  independent  and  honorable  judiciary  is  indispensable  to

COMMENT   

Deference  to  the  judgments  and  rulings  of  courts  depends  upon  public  confidence  in  the 
integrity and independence of the judges.  The integrity and independence of judges depend in turn 
upon their acting without fear or favor.  Although judges should be independent, they must comply 
with the law, including the provisions of this chapter.  Public confidence in the impartiality of the 
judiciary is maintained by the adherence of each judge to this responsibility.  Conversely, violation 
of this chapter diminishes public confidence in the judiciary and thereby does injury to the system of 
government under law.   
The role of the judicial conduct organization like the Wisconsin Judicial Commission is not 
 
that  of  an  appellate  court.    Wis.  Admin.  Code  Sec.  JC  3.06  (May  1979)  states  as  follows:  
"Commission  not  to  act  as  appellate  court.   The  commission  may  not  function  as  an  appellate 
court  to  review  the  decisions  of  a  court  or  judge  or  to  exercise  superintending  or  administrative 
control over determinations of courts or judges."   It  is important to remember  this concept as one 
interprets this chapter, particularly in light of the practice of some groups or individuals to encourage 
dissatisfied litigants to file simultaneous appeals and judicial conduct complaints.   

SCR 60.03  A judge shall avoid impropriety and the 

appearance of impropriety in all of the judge's activities. 
(1)  A judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act 
 
at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity 
and impartiality of the judiciary.   

COMMENT   

Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by irresponsible or improper conduct of judges.  
A judge must avoid all impropriety and appearance of impropriety.  A judge must expect to be the 
subject of constant public scrutiny.  A judge must therefore accept restrictions on the judge's conduct 
that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen and should do so freely and willingly.   
 
The prohibition against behaving with impropriety or the appearance of impropriety applies 
to  both  the  professional  and  personal  conduct  of  a  judge.    Because  it  is  not  practicable  to  list  all 
prohibited acts, the proscription is necessarily cast in general terms that extend to conduct by judges 
that is harmful although not specifically mentioned in the chapter.  Actual improprieties under this 
standard include violations of law, court rules or other specific provisions of this chapter.  The test 
232 
 

   

   

   

   

   

   

for appearance of impropriety is whether the conduct would create in reasonable minds a perception 
that  the  judge's  ability  to  carry  out  judicial  responsibilities  with  integrity,  impartiality  and 
competence is impaired.   
 
Restrictions on the personal conduct of judges cannot, however, be so onerous as to deprive 
them of fundamental freedoms enjoyed by other citizens.  Care must be taken to achieve a balance 
between  the  need  to  maintain  the  integrity  and  dignity  of  the  judiciary  and  the  right  of  judges  to 
conduct their personal lives in accordance with the dictates of their individual consciences.   
 
 
 
 
 
the judge; 
 
the public or the judicial/legal system.   
 

In striking this balance the following factors should be considered:   
(a)  the degree to which the personal conduct is public or private; 
(b)  the degree to which the personal conduct is a protected individual right;   
(c)  the potential for the personal conduct to directly harm or offend others;   
(d)  the degree to which the personal conduct is indicative of bias or prejudice on the part of 

(e)  the degree to which the personal conduct is indicative of the judge's lack of respect for 

See also Comment to sub. (3).     

(2)    A  judge  may  not  allow  family,  social,  political  or  other 
relationships to influence the  judge's  judicial  conduct or  judgment.   A 
judge may not lend the prestige of judicial office to advance the private 
interests of the judge or of others or convey or permit others to convey 
the impression that they are in a special position to influence the judge. 
A judge may not testify voluntarily as a character witness.   

COMMENT  

Maintaining the prestige of judicial office is essential to a system of government in which 
the  judiciary  functions  independently  of  the  executive  and  legislative  branches.    Respect  for  the 
judicial  office  facilitates  the  orderly  conduct  of  legitimate  judicial  functions.    Judges  should 
distinguish between proper and improper use of the prestige of office in all of their activities.  For 
example,  it  would  be  improper  for  a  judge  to  allude  to  his  or  her  judgeship  to  gain  a  personal 
advantage  such  as  deferential  treatment  when  stopped  by  a  police  officer  for  a  traffic  offense.  
Similarly, judicial letterhead must not be used for conducting a judge's personal business.   
 
A judge must avoid lending the prestige of judicial office for the advancement of the private 
interests of others.  For example, a judge must not use the judge's judicial position to gain advantage 
in a civil suit involving a member of the judge's family.  As to the acceptance of awards,  see SCR 
60.05 (4) (e) 1. 
 
Although  a  judge  should  be  sensitive  to  possible  abuse  of  the  prestige  of  office,  a  judge 
may,  based  on  the  judge's  personal  knowledge,  serve  as  a  reference  or  provide  a  letter  of 
recommendation.  Such a letter should not be written if the person who is the subject of the letter is 
or is likely to be a litigant engaged in a contested proceeding before the court.  However, a judge 
must  not  initiate  the  communication  of  information  to  a  sentencing  judge  or  a  probation  or 
corrections  officer  but  may  provide  to  such  persons  information  for  the  record  in  response  to  a 
formal request.   
Judges may participate in the process of judicial selection by cooperating with appointing 
 
authorities and screening committees seeking names for consideration and by responding to official 
inquiries concerning a person being considered for a judgeship.   
 
A judge must not testify voluntarily as a character witness because to do so may lend the 
prestige of the judicial office in support of the party for whom the judge testifies.  Moreover, when a 
judge testifies as a witness, a lawyer who regularly appears  before the judge may be placed in the 
awkward  position  of  cross-examining  the  judge.    A  judge  may,  however,  testify  when  properly 

 

233 

   

   

   

summoned.  Except in unusual circumstances where the demands of justice require, a judge should 
discourage a party from requiring the judge to testify as a character witness.  

(3)  A judge may not hold membership in any organization that 
practices invidious discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion 
or national origin.    

COMMENT 

Membership of a judge in an organization that practices invidious discrimination gives rise 
to perceptions that the judge's impartiality is impaired.  Whether an organization practices invidious 
discrimination is often a complex question to which judges should be sensitive.  The answer cannot 
be  determined  from  a  mere  examination  of  an  organization's  current  membership  rolls  but  rather 
depends  on  how  the  organization  selects  members  and  other  relevant  factors,  such  as  that  the 
organization  is  dedicated  to  the  preservation  of  religious,  ethnic  or  cultural  values  of  legitimate 
common interest to its members or that it is in fact and effect an intimate, purely private organization 
whose membership limitations could not be constitutionally prohibited. 
 
Whether an organization, club or group is "private" depends on a review of the following 
factors:    1)  size;  2)  purpose;  3)  policies;  4)  selectivity  in  membership;  5)  congeniality;  and  6) 
whether  others  are  excluded  from  critical  aspects  of  the  relationship.    An  organization  that  is  not 
"private" is generally said to discriminate invidiously if it arbitrarily excludes from membership on 
the  basis  of  race,  religion,  sex  or  national  origin  persons  who  would  otherwise  be  admitted  to 
membership.  See, New York State Club Ass'n Inc. v. City of New York, 108 S. Ct. 2225, 101 L. Ed. 
2d  1  (1988);  Board  of  Directors  of  Rotary  International  v.  Rotary  Club  of  Duarte,  481  U.S.  537 
(1987),  95  L.  Ed.  2d  474;  Roberts  v.  United  States  Jaycees,  468  U.S.  609  (1984).    Organizations 
dedicated  to  the  preservation  of  religious,  fraternal,  sororal,  spiritual,  charitable,  civic  or  cultural 
values  which  do  not  stigmatize  any  excluded  persons  as  inferior  and  therefore  unworthy  of 
membership are not considered to discriminate invidiously.   
Public manifestation by a judge of the judge's knowing approval of invidious discrimination 
 
on any basis gives the appearance of impropriety and diminishes public confidence in the integrity 
and impartiality of the judiciary. 
 
When a judge has reason to believe that an organization to which the judge belongs engages 
in invidious discrimination that would preclude membership under sub. (3) or under SCR 60.03, the 
judge  may,  in  lieu  of  resigning,  make  immediate  efforts  to  have  the  organization  discontinue  its 
invidiously  discriminatory  practices  but  must  suspend  participation  in  any  other  activities  of  the 
organization.    If  the  organization  fails  to  discontinue  its  invidiously  discriminatory  practices  as 
promptly as possible, the judge must resign from the organization. 

SCR 60.04  A judge shall perform the duties of judicial office 

impartially and diligently.   
The judicial duties of a judge take precedence over all the judge's 
 
other activities.  The judge's judicial duties include all the duties of the 
judge's office prescribed by law.   
 
following apply to adjudicative responsibilities:   
 
(a)  A judge shall hear and decide matters assigned to the judge, 
except  those  in  which  recusal  is  required  under  sub.  (4)  or 
disqualification  is  required  under  section  757.19  of  the  statutes  and

(d)  A judge shall be patient, dignified and courteous to litigants, 
 
jurors, witnesses, lawyers and others with whom the judge deals in an 
official  capacity  and  shall  require  similar  conduct  of  lawyers,  staff, 
court  officials  and  others  subject  to  the  judge's  direction  and  control.  
During trials and hearings, a judge shall act so that the judge's attitude, 
manner or tone toward counsel or witnesses does not prevent the proper 
presentation of the cause or the ascertainment of the truth.  A judge may 
properly intervene if the judge considers it necessary to clarify a point 
or expedite the proceedings.   

COMMENT   

The duty to hear all proceedings fairly and with patience is not inconsistent with the duty to 
dispose promptly of the business of the court.  Judges can be efficient and businesslike while being 
patient and deliberate.

(e)    A  judge  shall  perform  judicial  duties  without  bias  or 
prejudice.  A judge may not, in the performance of judicial duties, by 
words or conduct, manifest bias or prejudice, including bias or prejudice 
based upon race, gender, religion, national origin, disability, age, sexual 
orientation  or  socioeconomic  status,  and  may  not  knowingly  permit 
staff,  court  officials  and  others  subject  to  the  judge's  direction  and 
control to do so.   

COMMENT   

A  judge  must  refrain  from  speech,  gestures  or  other  conduct  that  could  reasonably  be 
perceived as sexual harassment and must require the same standard of conduct of others subject to 
the judge's direction and control.   
 
A judge must perform judicial duties impartially and fairly.  A judge who manifests bias on 
any  basis  in  a  proceeding  impairs  the  fairness  of  the  proceeding  and  brings  the  judiciary  into 
disrepute.    Facial  expression  and  body  language,  in  addition  to  oral  communication,  can  give  to 
parties or lawyers in the proceedings, jurors, the media and others an appearance of judicial bias.  A 
judge must be alert to avoid behavior that may be perceived as prejudicial.

based upon race, gender, religion, national origin, disability, age, sexual

or others.  This subsection does not preclude legitimate advocacy when 
race, gender, religion, national origin, disability, age, sexual orientation

proceeding.

COMMENT 

In disposing of matters promptly and efficiently, a judge must demonstrate due regard for 
the rights of the parties to be heard and to have issues resolved without unnecessary cost or delay.  
Containing  costs  while  preserving  fundamental  rights  of  parties  also  protects  the  interests  of 
witnesses  and  the  general  public.    A  judge  should  monitor  and  supervise  cases  so  as  to  reduce  or 
eliminate dilatory practices, avoidable delays and unnecessary costs.  A judge should encourage and 
seek to facilitate settlement, but parties  should  not  feel coerced into  surrendering the right to have 
their controversy resolved by the courts.   
 
Prompt  disposition  of  the  court's  business  requires  a  judge  to  devote  adequate  time  to 
judicial  duties,  to  be  punctual  in  attending  court  and  expeditious  in  determining  matters  under 
submission, and to insist that court officials, litigants and their lawyers cooperate with the judge to 
that end. 

 

237 

   

   

   

   

(hm)  A judge shall uphold and apply the law and shall perform 

all  duties  of  judicial  office  fairly  and  impartially.    A  judge  shall  also 

afford to every person who has a legal interest in a proceeding, or to that 

person's lawyer, the right to be heard according to the law.  A judge may 

make  reasonable  efforts,  consistent  with  the  law  and  court  rules,  to 

facilitate the ability of all litigants, including self-represented litigants, 

to be fairly heard.  

COMMENT 

A judge may exercise discretion consistent with the law and court rules to help ensure that 
all litigants are fairly heard.  A judge's responsibility to promote access to justice, combined with the 
growth in litigation involving self-represented litigants, may warrant more frequent exercise of such 
discretion  using  techniques  that  enhance  the  process  of  reaching  a  fair  determination  in  the  case.  
Although  the  appropriate  scope  of  such  discretion  and  how  it  is  exercised  will  vary  with  the 
circumstances of each case, a judge's exercise of such discretion will not generally raise a reasonable 
question about  the judge's impartiality.   Reasonable  steps that a judge  may  take  in the  exercise of 
such discretion include, but are not limited to, the following: 

1.  Construe pleadings to facilitate consideration of the issues raised. 
2.  Provide information or explanation about the proceedings. 
3.  Explain legal concepts in everyday language. 
4.  Ask neutral questions to elicit or clarify information. 
5.  Modify the traditional order of taking evidence. 
6.  Permit narrative testimony. 
7.  Allow litigants to adopt their pleadings as their sworn testimony. 
8.  Refer litigants to any resources available to assist in the preparation of the case or 

9.  Inform litigants what will be happening next in the case and what is expected of them. 

enforcement and compliance with any order. 
 
   
 
(j)  A judge may not, while a proceeding is pending or impending 
in  any  court,  make  any  public  comment  that  may  reasonably  be 
expected to affect the outcome or impair the fairness of the proceeding. 
The judge shall require court personnel subject to the judge's direction 
and  control  to  similarly  abstain  from  comment.    This  subsection  does 
not prohibit a judge from making public statements in the course of his 
or  her  official  duties  or  from  explaining  for  public  information  the 
procedures of the court.  This paragraph does not apply to proceedings 
in which the judge is a litigant in a personal capacity.

COMMENT 

The  requirement  that  judges  abstain  from  public  comment  regarding  a  pending  or 
impending  proceeding  continues  during  any  appellate  process  and  until  final  disposition.    This 
paragraph does not prohibit a judge from commenting on proceedings in which the judge is a litigant 
in a personal capacity, but in cases such as a writ of  mandamus where the judge is a litigant in an 
official capacity, the judge must not comment publicly.   

(k)  A judge may not commend or criticize jurors for their verdict 
other than in a court order or opinion in a proceeding but may express 
appreciation  to  jurors  for  their  service  to  the  judicial  system  and  the 
community.   

COMMENT   

Commending  or  criticizing  jurors  for  their  verdict  may  imply  a  judicial  expectation  in 

future cases and may impair a juror's ability to be fair and impartial in a subsequent case.   

(2)    In  the  performance  of  the  duties  under  this  section,  the 

(m)  A judge may not disclose or use, for any purpose unrelated 
to judicial duties, nonpublic information acquired in a judicial capacity.  
(o)  A judge shall cooperate with other judges as members of a 
 
common  judicial  system  to  promote  the  satisfactory  administration  of 
justice.  
 
following apply to administrative responsibilities:   
 
(a)  A judge shall diligently discharge the judge's administrative 
responsibilities  without  bias  or  prejudice  and  maintain  professional 
competence in judicial administration, and should cooperate with other 
judges and court officials in the administration of court business.   
(b)  A judge shall require staff, court officials and others subject 
 
to the judge's direction and control to observe the standards of fidelity 
and  diligence  that  apply  to  the  judge  and  to  refrain  from  manifesting 
bias or prejudice in the performance of their official duties.   
 
(c)  A judge may not make unnecessary appointments.  A judge 
shall exercise the power of appointment impartially and on the basis of 
merit.  A judge shall avoid nepotism and favoritism.  A judge may not 
approve  compensation of  appointees beyond  the  fair  value of  services 
rendered.

COMMENT 

Appointees of a judge include assigned counsel, officials such as referees, commissioners, 
special  masters,  receivers  and  guardians,  and  personnel,  such  as  clerks,  judicial  assistants  and 
bailiffs.  Consent by the parties to an appointment or an award of compensation does not relieve the 
judge of the obligation prescribed by SCR 60.04 (2) (c).   

(3)    In  the  performance  of  the  duties  under  this  section  the 

following apply to disciplinary responsibilities:   
 
(a)    A  judge  who  receives  information  indicating  a  substantial 
likelihood that another judge has committed a violation of this chapter 
should take appropriate action.  A judge having personal knowledge that 
another  judge  has  committed  a  violation  of  this  chapter  that  raises  a 
substantial question as to the other judge's fitness for office shall inform 
the appropriate authority.   
 
(b)    A  judge  who  receives  information  indicating  a  substantial 
likelihood  that  a  lawyer  has  committed  a  violation  of  the  rules  of 
professional  conduct  for  attorneys  should  take  appropriate  action.    A 
judge  having  personal  knowledge  that  a  lawyer  has  committed  a 
violation of the rules of professional conduct for attorneys that raises a 
substantial question as to the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness 
as a lawyer in other respects shall inform the appropriate authority.  This 
paragraph does not require a judge to report conduct disclosed through a 
judge's participation in a group to assist ill or disabled judges or lawyers 
when  such  information  is  acquired  in  the  course  of  assisting  an  ill  or 
disabled judge or lawyer.

judge's  judicial  duties  and  shall  be  absolutely  privileged  and  no  civil

(c) 

COMMENT   

Appropriate  action  may  include  direct  communication  with  the  judge  or  lawyer  who  has 
committed the violation, other direct action if available, and reporting the violation to an appropriate 
authority or other agency or body.   

(4)  Except as provided in sub. (6) for waiver, a judge shall recuse 
himself or herself in a proceeding when the facts and circumstances the 
judge knows or reasonably should know establish one of the following 
or  when  reasonable,  well-informed  persons  knowledgeable  about 
240 

 

   

     

   

   

   

judicial  ethics standards  and  the  justice system  and  aware of the  facts 
and circumstances the judge knows or reasonably should know would 
reasonably question the judge's ability to be impartial:   

COMMENT   

Under  this  rule,  a  judge  must  recuse  himself  or  herself  whenever  the  facts  and 
circumstances the judge knows or reasonably should know raise reasonable question of the judge's 
ability to act impartially, regardless of  whether any of the specific rules in SCR 60.04 (4) applies.  
For example, if a judge were in the process of negotiating for employment with a law firm, the judge 
would  be  required  to  recuse  himself  or  herself  from  any  matters  in  which  that  law  firm  appeared, 
unless the  recusal was waived by the parties after disclosure by the judge.   
 
Section 757.19 of the statutes sets forth the circumstances under which a judge is required 
by law to disqualify himself or herself from any civil or criminal action or proceeding and establishes 
the procedures for disqualification and waiver.   
A judge should disclose on the record information that the judge believes the parties or their 
 
lawyers might consider relevant to the question of recusal, even if the judge believes there is no real 
basis for recusal.   
 
By decisional law, the rule of necessity may override the rule of recusal.  For example, a 
judge might be required to participate in judicial review of a judicial salary statute or might be the 
only judge available in a matter requiring immediate judicial action, such as a hearing on probable 
cause or temporary restraining order.  In the  latter case, the  judge  must disclose on the record the 
basis for possible recusal and use reasonable efforts to transfer the matter to another judge as soon as 
practicable.  

(a)  The judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party 
or a party's lawyer or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts 
concerning the proceeding.    

COMMENT   

As  a  general  matter,  for  recusal  to  be  required  under  this  provision,  the  personal  bias  or 
prejudice  for  or  against  a  party  or  the  personal  knowledge  of  disputed  facts  must  come  from  an 
extrajudicial source.   A bias or prejudice requiring recusal  most often arises from a prior personal 
relationship but may arise from strong personal feelings about the alleged conduct of a party.  If a 
judge's personal bias or prejudice concerning a party's lawyer is of such a degree as to be likely to 
transfer to the party, the judge's recusal is required under this provision.   

(b)  The judge of an appellate court previously handled the action 

or proceeding as judge of another court.   
 
(c)  The judge served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy, or 
a lawyer with whom the judge previously practiced law served during 
such  association  as  a  lawyer  concerning  the  matter,  or  the  judge  has 
been a material witness concerning the matter.

COMMENT 

A  lawyer  in  a  government  agency  does  not  ordinarily  have  an  association  with  other 
lawyers  employed  by  that  agency  within  the  meaning  of  SCR  60.04  (4)  (c);  a  judge  formerly 
employed by a government agency, however, should recuse himself or herself in a proceeding if the 
judge's impartiality reasonably may be questioned because of such association.  
  

(d)    The  judge  knows  that  he  or  she,  individually  or  as  a 
fiduciary, or the judge's spouse or minor child wherever residing, or any 
other member of the judge's family residing in the judge's household has 
an economic interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to 
the proceeding or has any other more than de minimis interest that could 
be substantially affected by the proceeding.    

COMMENT   

A financial interest requiring recusal does not occur solely because the judge is a member 
of a political or taxing body that is a party or is a ratepayer to a party.  The test then remains whether 
the judge's interest as a taxpayer or ratepayer could be substantially affected by the outcome.   

1.  Is a party to the proceeding or an officer, director or trustee of 

(e)  The judge or the judge's spouse, or a person within the third 
degree of kinship to either of them, or the spouse of such a person meets 
one of the following criteria:

that could be substantially affected by the proceeding.   

2.    Is acting as a lawyer in the proceeding.    
3.  Is known by the judge to have a more than de minimis interest 

4.  Is to the judge's knowledge likely to be a material witness  

In the proceeding.   

(f)  The judge, while a judge or a candidate for judicial office, 
has  made  a  public  statement  that  commits,  or  appears  to  commit,  the 
judge with respect to any of the following: 
1.  An issue in the proceeding. 
2.  The controversy in the proceeding. 

The fact that a lawyer in a proceeding is affiliated with a law firm with which a relative of 
the judge is affiliated does not of itself require the judge's recusal.  Under appropriate circumstances, 
the fact that the judge's impartiality may reasonably be questioned or that the relative is known by the 
judge to have an interest in the law firm that could be "substantially affected by the outcome of the

proceeding" may require the judge's recusal.   
 
subpoena purporting to make his or her relative a witness is false, sham or frivolous.   

Recusal  is  not  required  under  this  provision  if  the  judge  determines  on  the  record  that  a 

(5)  A judge shall keep informed of the judge's own personal and 
fiduciary  economic  interests  and  make  a  reasonable  effort  to  keep 
informed  of the  personal economic interests of  the  judge's spouse  and 
minor children residing in the judge's household, having due regard for 
the confidentiality of the spouse's business.   
 
(6)  A judge required to recuse himself or herself under sub. (4) 
may disclose on the record the basis of the judge's recusal and may ask 
the  parties  and  their  lawyers  to  consider,  out  of  the  presence  of  the 
judge, whether to waive recusal.  If, following disclosure of any basis 
for recusal other than personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, the 
parties and lawyers, without participation by the judge, all agree that the 
judge should not be required to recuse himself or herself and the judge 
is  then  willing  to  participate,  the  judge  may  participate  in  the 
proceeding.    The  agreement  shall  be  incorporated  in  the  record  of  the 
proceeding.   

COMMENT   

A  waiver  procedure  provides  the  parties  an  opportunity  to  proceed  without  delay  if  they 
wish  to  waive  the  recusal.    To  assure  that  consideration  of  the  question  of  waiver  is  made 
independently of the judge, a judge must not solicit, seek or hear comments on a possible waiver of 
the recusal unless the lawyers jointly propose a waiver after consultation as provided in the rule.  A 
party may act through counsel if counsel represents on the record that the party has been consulted 
and consents.  As a practical matter, a judge may wish to have all parties and their lawyers sign the 
waiver agreement.  

(7)    Effect  of  Campaign  Contributions.    A  judge  shall  not  be 
required to recuse himself or herself in a proceeding based solely on any 
endorsement  or  the  judge’s  campaign  committee’s  receipt  of  a  lawful 
campaign  contribution,  including  a  campaign  contribution  from  an 
individual or entity involved in the proceeding.   

Wisconsin vigorously debated an elective judiciary during the formation and adoption of 
the  Wisconsin  Constitution in 1848. An elective  judiciary  was selected and has been part of the 
Wisconsin democratic tradition for more than 160 years.   

Campaign  contributions  to  judicial  candidates  are  a  fundamental  component  of  judicial 
elections.  Since  1974  the  size  of  contributions  has  been  limited  by  state  statute.  The  limit  on 

COMMENT   

243 

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

 

individual contributions to candidates for the supreme court was reduced from $10,000 to $1,000 
in 2009 Wisconsin Act 89 after the 2009 supreme court election. The legislation also reduced the 
limit on contributions to supreme court candidates from political action committees, from 
$8,625 to $1,000.   

The  purpose  of  this  rule  is  to  make  clear  that  the  receipt  of  a  lawful  campaign 
contribution by a judicial candidate's campaign committee does not, by itself, require the candidate 
to recuse himself or herself as a judge from a proceeding involving a contributor. An endorsement 
of  the  judge  by  a  lawyer,  other  individual,  or  entity  also  does  not,  by  itself,  require  a  judge's 
recusal from a proceeding involving the endorser. Not every campaign contribution by a litigant or 
attorney creates a probability of bias that requires a judge's recusal.  

Campaign  contributions  must  be  publicly  reported.  Disqualifying  a  judge  from 
participating  in  a  proceeding  solely  because  the  judge's  campaign  committee  received  a  lawful 
contribution  would create the impression that receipt of a  contribution  automatically impairs the 
judge's integrity. It  would have the effect of discouraging  "the broadest possible participation in 
financing campaigns by all citizens of the state" through voluntary contributions, see Wis. Stat. § 
11.001, because it would deprive citizens who lawfully contribute to judicial campaigns, whether 
individually or through an organization, of access to the judges they help elect.   

Involuntary recusal of judges has greater policy implications in the supreme court than in 
the  circuit  court  and  court  of  appeals.  Litigants  have  a  broad  right  to  substitution  of  a  judge  in 
circuit court.  When a judge withdraws following the filing of a substitution request, a new judge 
will be assigned.  When a judge on the court of appeals withdraws from a case, a new judge also is 
assigned. When a justice of the supreme court withdraws from a case, however, the justice is not 
replaced.  Thus,  the  recusal  of  a  supreme  court  justice  alters  the  number  of  justices  reviewing  a 
case as well as the composition of the court. These recusals affect the interests of non-litigants as 
well  as  non-contributors,  inasmuch  as  supreme  court  decisions  almost  invariably  have 
repercussions beyond the parties. 

(8)  Effect  of  Independent  Communications.  A  judge  shall  not 
be  required  to  recuse  himself  or  herself  in  a  proceeding  where  such 
recusal  would  be  based  solely  on  the  sponsorship  of  an  independent 
expenditure  or  issue  advocacy  communication  (collectively,  an 
"independent communication") by an individual or entity involved  in 
the  proceeding  or  a  donation  to  an  organization  that  sponsors  an 
independent communication by an individual or entity involved in the 
proceeding.  
 

 
COMMENT 

Independent  expenditures  and  issue  advocacy  communications  are  different  from 
campaign contributions to a judge's campaign committee.  Contributions are regulated by statute. 
They  are  often  solicited  by  a  judge's  campaign  committee,  and  they  must  be  accepted  by  the 
judge's campaign committee. Contributions that are accepted may be returned. By contrast, neither 
a  judge  nor  the  judge's  campaign  committee  has  any  control  of  an  independent  expenditure  or 
issue advocacy communication because these expenditures or communications must be completely 
independent  of  the  judge's  campaign,  as  required  by  law,  to  retain  their  First  Amendment 
protection. 

 

 

244 

   

   

   

   

   

A judge is not required to recuse himself or herself from a proceeding solely because an 
 
individual  or  entity  involved  in  the  proceeding  has  sponsored  or  donated  to  an  independent 
communication. Any other result  would permit the sponsor of an independent communication to 
dictate a judge's non-participation in a case, by sponsoring an independent communication. 
Automatically disqualifying a judge because of an independent communication would disrupt the 
judge's official duties and also have a chilling effect on protected speech.

(a)    Cast  reasonable  doubt  on  the  judge's  capacity  to  act 

COMMENT   

Complete separation of a judge from extra-judicial activities is neither possible nor wise; a 

judge should not become isolated from the community in which the judge lives.   
Expressions of bias or prejudice by a judge, even outside the judge's judicial activities, may 
 
cast reasonable doubt on the judge's capacity to act impartially as a judge.   See SCR 60.03 (1) and 
(3).   
 
(2)    Avocational  Activities.    A  judge  may  speak,  write,  lecture, 
teach  and  participate  in  other  extra-judicial  activities  concerning  the 
law,  the  legal  system,  the  administration  of  justice  and  nonlegal 
subjects, subject to the requirements of this chapter.     

COMMENT   

As a judicial officer and person specially learned in the law, a judge is in a unique position 
to  contribute  to  the  improvement  of  the  law,  the  legal  system,  and  the  administration  of  justice, 
including  revision  of  substantive  and  procedural  law  and  improvement  of  criminal  and  juvenile 
justice.    To  the  extent  that  time  permits,  a  judge  is  encouraged  to  do  so,  either  independently  or 
through a bar association, judicial conference or other organization dedicated to the improvement of 
the  law.    Judges  may  participate  in  efforts  to  promote  the  fair  administration  of  justice,  the 
independence of the judiciary and the integrity of the legal profession and may express opposition to 
the persecution of lawyers and judges in other countries because of their professional activities.   
 
In this and other subsections of SCR 60.05, the phrase "subject to the requirements of this 
chapter"  is  used,  notably  in  connection  with  a  judge's  governmental,  civic  or  charitable  activities.  
This phrase is included to remind judges that the use of permissive language in various provisions of 
the  chapter  does  not  relieve  a  judge  from  the  other  requirements  of  the  chapter  that  apply  to  the 
specific conduct.   

(3)  Governmental, Civic or Charitable Activities.

(a)    A  judge  may  not  appear  at  a  public  hearing  before,  or 
 
otherwise  consult  with,  an  executive  or  legislative  body  or  official 
except  on  matters  concerning  the  law,  the  legal  system  or  the 
administration  of  justice  or  except  when  acting  pro  se  in  a  matter 
involving the judge or the judge's interests.   

COMMENT   

See SCR 60.03 (2) regarding the obligation to avoid improper influence.   
As provided in SCR 60.07(2), sub. (3)(a) does not apply to a judge serving on a part-time 

 
basis.   

(b)    A  judge  may  not  accept  appointment  to  a  governmental 
committee  or  commission  or  other  governmental  position  that  is 
concerned  with  issues  of  fact  or  policy  on  matters  other  than  the 
improvement  of  the  law,  the  legal  system  or  the  administration  of 
justice.  A judge may represent a country, state or locality on ceremonial 
occasions  or  in  connection  with  historical,  educational  or  cultural 
activities  and  may  serve  on  a  governmental  or  private  committee, 
commission or board concerned with historical, educational or cultural 
activities.  A judge may serve in any branch of military reserves and be 
called to duty in the active military.   
 
 
COMMENT 

A judge is prohibited from accepting any governmental position except one relating to the 
law,  legal  system  or  administration  of  justice  as  authorized  by  par.  (c).    The  appropriateness  of 
accepting extra-judicial assignments must be assessed in light of the demands on judicial resources 
created  by  crowded  dockets  and  the  need  to  protect  the  courts  from  involvement  in  extra-judicial 
matters  that  may  prove  to  be  controversial.    Judges  should  not  accept  governmental  appointments 
that are likely to interfere with the effectiveness and independence of the judiciary.  
This provision does not govern a judge's service in a non-governmental position.  See par. 
 
(c) permitting service by a judge with organizations devoted to the improvement of the law, the legal 
system or the administration of justice and with educational, religious, charitable, fraternal or civic 
organizations  not conducted  for profit.  For  example,  service on  the board of a public educational 
institution, unless it were a law school, would be prohibited, but service on the board of a public law 
school or any private educational institution would generally be permitted under par. (c).   
 
basis.  

As provided in SCR 60.07(2), sub. (3)(b) does not apply to a judge serving on a part-time 

(c)  A judge may serve as an officer, director, trustee or nonlegal 
advisor  of  an  organization  or  governmental  agency  devoted  to  the 
improvement of the law, the legal system or the administration of justice 
or of a nonprofit educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, sororal or

civic  organization,  subject  to  the  following  limitations  and  the  other 
requirements of this chapter:   

COMMENT   

This provision does not apply to a judge's service in a governmental position unconnected 

with the improvement of the law, the legal system or the administration of justice; see par. (b).   
See  Comment  to  SCR  60.05  (2)  regarding  use  of  the  phrase  "subject  to  the  following 
 
limitations and the other requirements of this chapter."  As an example of the meaning of the phrase, 
a judge permitted by this provision to serve on the board of a fraternal institution may be prohibited 
from  such  service  by  SCR  60.03  (1)  or  (3)  or  60.05  (1)  if  the  institution  practices  invidious 
discrimination or if service on the board otherwise casts reasonable doubt on the judge's capacity to 
act impartially as a judge.   
 
Service by a judge on behalf of a civic or charitable organization may be governed by other 
provisions of SCR 60.05 in addition to sub. (3).  For example, a judge is prohibited by sub. (7) from 
serving as a legal advisor to a civic or charitable organization.   

a.  Engage in proceedings that would ordinarily come before the 

1.    A  judge  may  not  serve  as  an  officer,  director,  trustee  or 
nonlegal advisor if it  is likely  that the organization  will  do  any  of the 
following:   
 
judge.   
b.    Engage  frequently  in  adversary  proceedings  in  the  court  of 
 
which  the  judge  is  a  member  or  in  any  court  subject  to  the  appellate 
jurisdiction of the court of which the judge is a member.   

COMMENT   

The  changing  nature  of  some  organizations  and  of  their  relationship  to  the  law  makes  it 
necessary for a judge to regularly re-examine the activities of each organization with which the judge 
is affiliated to determine if it is proper for the judge to continue the affiliation.  For example, in many 
jurisdictions charitable  hospitals  are  now  more  frequently  in court than in  the past.   Similarly, the 
boards  of  some  legal  aid  organizations  now  make  policy  decisions  that  may  have  political 
significance or imply commitment to causes that may come before the courts for adjudication.

As provided in SCR 60.07(2), par. (c) 1.b. does not apply to a judge serving on a part-time 

2.  A judge, in any capacity:   
 
a.  May assist the organization in planning fund-raising activities 
and  may  participate  in  the  management  and  investment  of  the 
organization's  funds  but  may  not  personally  participate  in  the 
solicitation of funds or other fund-raising activities, except that a judge 
may  solicit  funds  from  other  judges  over  whom  the  judge  does  not 
exercise supervisory or appellate authority;

A  judge  may  solicit  membership  or  endorse  or  encourage  membership  efforts  for  an 
organization devoted to the improvement of the law, the legal system or the administration of justice 
or  a  nonprofit  educational,  religious,  charitable,  fraternal  or  civic  organization  as  long  as  the 
solicitation  cannot  reasonably  be  perceived  as  coercive  and  is  not  essentially  a  fund-raising 
mechanism.    Solicitation  of  funds  for  an  organization  and  solicitation  of  memberships  similarly 
involve the danger that the person solicited will feel obligated to respond favorably to the solicitor if 
the solicitor is in a position of influence or control.  A judge must not engage in direct, individual 
solicitation of  funds or  memberships in person, in  writing or by  telephone except in the  following 
cases:  1) a judge may solicit for funds or memberships other judges over whom the judge does not 
exercise supervisory or appellate authority, 2) a judge may solicit other persons for membership in 
the organizations described above if neither those persons nor persons with whom they are affiliated 
are likely ever to appear before the court on which the judge serves, and 3) a judge who is an officer 
of  such  an  organization  may  send  a  general  membership  solicitation  mailing  over  the  judge's 
signature.   
SCR  60.05  should  not  be  read  as  proscribing  participation  in  de  minimis  fund-raising 
 
activities so long as a judge is careful to avoid using the prestige of the office in the activity.  Thus, 
e.g., a judge may pass the collection basket during services at church, may ask friends and neighbors 
to buy tickets to a pancake breakfast for a local neighborhood center and may cook the pancakes at 
the event but may not personally ask attorneys and others who are likely to appear before the judge 
to  buy  tickets  to  it.    Similarly,  SCR  60.05  should  not  be  read  to  prohibit  judges  from  soliciting 
memberships  for  religious  purposes,  but  judges  must  nevertheless  avoid  using  the  prestige  of  the 
office for the purpose of such solicitation.   
 
Use  of  an  organization  letterhead  for  fund  raising  or  membership  solicitation  does  not 
violate subd. 2 provided the letterhead lists only the judge's name and office or other position in the 
organization  and,  if  comparable  designations  are  listed  for  other  persons,  the  judge's  judicial 
248 

 

designation.  In addition, a judge must make reasonable efforts to ensure that the judge's staff, court 
officials  and  others  subject  to  the  judge's  direction  and  control  do  not  solicit  funds  on  the  judge's 
behalf for any purpose, charitable or otherwise.   
 
A judge may be a speaker or guest of honor at an organization's fund-raising event provided 
there  is  no  advertising  of  the  judge  as  speaker  or  guest  of  honor  in  order  to  encourage  people  to 
attend and make contributions and provided that any contributions at the event are made prior to the 
judge's speech or presentation as guest of honor.  A judge's attendance at such event is permissible if 
otherwise consistent with this chapter.   

(4)  Financial Activities.   
(a)  1.  A judge may not engage in financial or business dealings 

a.    Reasonably  be  perceived  to  exploit  the  judge's  judicial 

 
that could meet any of the following conditions:   
 
position. 
b.    Involve  the  judge  in  frequent  transactions  or  continuing 
 
business  relationships  with  those  lawyers  or  other  persons  likely  to 
come before the court on which the judge serves.   

As provided in SCR 60.07(2), sub. (4)(a)1.b. does not apply to a judge serving on a part-

time basis. 

2.  A judge shall comply with sub. (4)(a)1 as soon as reasonably 
possible and, in any  event,  within one  year of the applicability  of this 
chapter to the judge.   

COMMENT 

COMMENT   

When  a  judge  acquires  in  a  judicial  capacity  information,  such  as  material  contained  in 
filings  with  the  court,  that  is  not  yet  generally  known,  the  judge  must  not  use  the  information  for 
private gain.  See SCR 60.03 (2) and 60.04 (1) (m).   
 
A  judge  must  avoid  financial  and  business  dealings  that  involve  the  judge  in  frequent 
transactions or continuing business relationships with persons likely to come either before the judge 
personally  or  before  other  judges  on  the  judge's  court.    In  addition,  a  judge  should  discourage 
members of the judge's family from engaging in dealings that would reasonably appear to exploit the 
judge's judicial position.  This rule is  necessary  to avoid creating  an  appearance of  exploitation of 
office  or  favoritism  and  to  minimize  the  potential  for  recusal  or  disqualification.    With  respect  to 
affiliation of relatives of a judge with law firms appearing before the judge,  see Comment to SCR 
60.04 (4) relating to recusal.   
 
Participation  by  a  judge  in  financial  and  business  dealings  is  subject  to  the  general 
prohibitions in SCR 60.05 (1) against activities that tend to reflect adversely on impartiality, demean 
the judicial office, or interfere with the proper performance of judicial duties.  Such participation is 
also subject to the general prohibition in SCR 60.03 against activities involving impropriety or the 
appearance of impropriety and the prohibition in SCR 60.03 (2) against the misuse of the prestige of 
judicial  office.    In  addition,  a  judge  must  maintain  high  standards  of  conduct  in  all  of  the  judge's

Subject  to  the  requirements  of  this  chapter,  a  judge  may  hold  and  manage  investments

officer,  director,  manager,  general  partner,  advisor  or  employee  of  a 
business entity if that service does not conflict with the judge's judicial 
duties,  create  the  appearance  of  impropriety,  or  otherwise  violate  any 
provision of this chapter.

general  partner,  advisor  or  employee  of  any  business  entity  affected 
with  a  public  interest,  including  a  financial  institution,  insurance 
company,  and  public  utility,  and  may  not  participate  in  or  permit  the 
judge's  name  to  be  used  in  connection  with  any  business  venture  or 
commercial advertising that indicates the judge's title or affiliation with 
the  judiciary  or  otherwise  lends  the  power  or  prestige  of  office  to 
promote a business or commercial venture. 

COMMENT   

A judge may participate in a business not affected with a public interest if that participation 
does not conflict with the judge's judicial duties, create the appearance of impropriety, or violate any 
other  provision  of  this  Code.    For  example,  a  judge  may  be  prohibited  from  participation  if  the 
business entity frequently appears before a court in the jurisdiction in which the judge serves or the 
participation  requires  significant  time  away  from  judicial  duties.    Similarly,  a  judge  must  avoid 
participation if the judge's participation would involve misuse of the prestige of office.

Because  a  gift,  favor  or  loan  to  a  member  of  the  judge's  family  residing  in  the  judge's 
household  might  be  viewed  as  intended  to  influence  the  judge,  a  judge  must  inform  those  family 
members of the relevant ethical constraints upon the judge in this regard and discourage those family 
members from violating them.  A judge cannot, however, reasonably be expected to know or control 
all of the financial or business activities of all family members residing in the judge's household.

official use, or an invitation to the judge and the judge's spouse or guest

improvement  of  the  law,  the  legal  system  or  the  administration  of 
justice.    

COMMENT   

Acceptance  of  an  invitation  to  a  law-related  function  is  governed  by  sub.  (4)  (e)  1; 
acceptance of an invitation paid for by an individual lawyer or group of lawyers is governed by sub. 
(4) (e) 10.   
 
A  judge  may  accept  a  public  testimonial  or  a  gift  incident  thereto  only  if  the  donor 
organization is not an organization whose members comprise or frequently represent the same side in 
litigation,  and  the  testimonial  and  gift  are  otherwise  in  compliance  with  other  provisions  of  this 
chapter.  See SCR 60.05 (1) (a) and 60.03 (2).

other separate  activity  of  a spouse  or other  family  member of  a  judge

5.  A gift from a friend for a special occasion, such as a wedding, 
anniversary  or  birthday,  if  the  gift  is  fairly  commensurate  with  the 
occasion and the relationship.    

COMMENT   

A gift to a judge, or to a member of the judge's family living in the judge's household, that 
is excessive in value raises questions about the judge's impartiality and the integrity of the judicial 
office  and  might  require  recusal  or  disqualification  of  the  judge  where  recusal  or  disqualification 
would not otherwise be required.  See, however, par. (e) 5.   

6.    Anything  of  value  if  the  activity  or  occasion  for  which  it  is 
given is unrelated to the judge's use of the state's time, facilities, services 
or  supplies  not  generally  available  to  all  citizens  of  this  state  and  the 
judge can show by clear and convincing evidence that it was unrelated 
to  and  did  not  arise  from  the  judge's  holding  or  having  held  a  public 
office. 
 
7.  A gift, favor or loan from a relative or close personal friend 
whose  appearance  or  interest  in  a  case  would  in  any  event  require 
recusal under SCR 60.04(4).  
 
8.    A  loan  from  a  lending  institution  in  its  regular  course  of 
business on the same terms generally available to persons who are not 
judges.

or other person  who has come  or is likely  to come or  whose interests 
have come or are likely to come before the judge.

COMMENT   

Unless authorized by other provisions of sub. (4) (e), sub. (4)(e) 10 prohibits judges from 
accepting gifts, favors or loans from lawyers or their firms if they have come or are likely to come

clients' interests have come or are likely to come before the judge.  See sec. 19.43 et seq., Stats.

personal  representative,  trustee,  guardian,  attorney-in-fact  or  other 
fiduciary,  except  for  the  estate,  trust  or  person  of  a  member  of  the 
judge's family, and then only if such service will not interfere with the 
proper performance of his or her judicial duties.   
 
(b)  A judge may not serve as a fiduciary if it is likely that the 
judge  as  a  fiduciary  will  be  engaged  in  proceedings  that  would 
ordinarily come before the judge or if the estate, trust or ward becomes 
involved  in  adversary  proceedings  in  the  court  on  which  the  judge 
serves or one under its appellate jurisdiction.   
(c)    The  same  restrictions  on  financial  activities  that  apply  to  a 
 
judge  personally  also  apply  to  the  judge  while  acting  in  a  fiduciary 
capacity.   
(d)    A  judge  shall  comply  with  pars.  (a)  and  (b)  as  soon  as 
 
reasonably  possible  and,  in  any  event,  within  one  year  of  the 
applicability of this chapter to the judge.   

COMMENT   

A judge who is a fiduciary at the time this chapter becomes effective for the estate or person 
of one who is not a member of the judge's family may continue to act as such if the demands on his 
or her time and the possibility of a conflict of interest are not substantial and for the period of time 
necessary to avoid serious adverse consequences to the beneficiary of the fiduciary relationship but 
in no event longer than one year.   
The  restrictions  imposed  by  SCR  60.05  may  conflict  with  the  judge's  obligation  as  a 
 
fiduciary.  For example, a judge should resign as trustee if detriment to the trust would result from 
divestiture of holdings the retention of which would place the judge in violation of sub. (4) (d).

arbitrator  or  mediator  or  otherwise  perform  judicial  functions  in  a 
private capacity unless expressly authorized by law.

(7)    Practice  of  Law.    A  judge  may  not  practice  law.  
Notwithstanding  this  prohibition,  a  judge  may  act  pro  se  and  may, 
without  compensation,  give  legal  advice  to  and  draft  or  review 
documents  for  a  member  of  the  judge's  family  and  represent  without

compensation the estate of a person with whom the judge maintains a 
close familial relationship so long as the estate remains uncontested.   

COMMENT   

This prohibition refers to the practice of law in a representative capacity and not in a pro se 
capacity.    A  judge  may  act  for  himself  or  herself  in  all  legal  matters,  including  matters  involving 
litigation  and  matters  involving  appearances  before  or  other  dealings  with  legislative  and  other 
governmental bodies.  However, in so doing, a judge must not abuse the prestige of office to advance 
the interests of the judge or judge's family.  See SCR 60.03 (2).   
 
The chapter allows a judge to give legal advice to and draft legal documents for members of 
the judge's family, so long as the judge receives no compensation.  A judge must not, however, act as 
an advocate for a member of the judge's family in a legal matter.   
 
The restraint against a judge giving advice to parties in matters before the judge does not 
prohibit a judge from advising such parties to obtain lawyers or medical treatment and from advising 
such parties on similar matters unrelated to the merits of the matter before the judge.

(a)    Compensation  and  Reimbursement.    A  judge  may  receive 
compensation  and  reimbursement  of  expenses  for  the  extra-judicial 
activities permitted by this chapter if the source of such payments does 
not  give  the  appearance  of  influencing  the  judge's  performance  of 
judicial duties or otherwise give the appearance of impropriety.   
1.  Compensation may not exceed a reasonable amount nor may 
 
the  compensation  exceed  what  a  person  who  is  not  a  judge  would 
receive for the same activity.   
2.  Expense reimbursement shall be limited to the actual cost of 
 
travel,  food  and  lodging  reasonably  incurred  by  the  judge  and,  where 
appropriate  to  the  occasion,  by  the  judge's  spouse  or  guest.    Any 
payment in excess of that amount is compensation.   
 
(b)  Financial reports.  Except as provided in SCR 60.07, a judge 
shall  file  with  the  ethics  commission  a  timely  financial  report  as 
required by section 19.43 of the statutes.   

COMMENT   

The chapter does not prohibit a judge from accepting honoraria or speaking fees provided 
that  the  compensation  is  reasonable  and  commensurate  with  the  task  performed.    A  judge  should 
ensure, however, that no conflicts are created by the arrangement.  A judge must not appear to trade 
on the judicial position for personal advantage.  Nor should a judge spend significant time away from 
court duties to meet speaking or writing commitments for compensation.  In addition, the source of 
the payment must not raise any question of undue influence or the judge's ability or willingness to be

As  provided  in  SCR  60.07(2),  sub.  (8)  does  not  apply  to  a  judge  serving  on  a  part-time 
basis. Sub. (8) does not apply to a supplemental court commissioner authorized under SCR 75.02(3) 
who  has  performed  fewer  than  40  hours  of  circuit  court  commissioner  duties  in  the  preceding 
calendar year. 

SCR 60.06  A judge or judicial candidate shall refrain from 

inappropriate political activity.   
 
(1g)    Terminology.    In  this  section,  “judge”  has  the  meaning 
given in SCR 60.01(8), except that in subs. (1m), (2), and (4), “judge” 
does not include a court commissioner or a municipal judge who did not 
devote 40 or more hours to the performance of his or her official duties 
in the preceding calendar year. 
(1m)    Candidate  for  Office.    A  judge  shall  not  become  a 
 
candidate for a federal, state, or local nonjudicial elective office without 
first resigning his or her judgeship.  A judge’s eligibility to serve may 
be governed by other rules or constitutional provisions. 

COMMENT 

Article  VII,  section  10  (1)  of  the  Wisconsin  Constitution  provides,  “No  justice  of  the 
supreme court or judge of any court of record  shall  hold any other office of public trust,  except a 
judicial  office,  during  the  term  for  which  elected.”    See  Wagner  v.  Milwaukee  County  Election 
Comm’n, 2003 WI 103, 263 Wis. 2d 709, 666 N.W.2d 816.  

 (b) No judge or candidate for judicial office or judge-elect may 

(2)  Party membership and activities.  
 
(a) Individuals who seek election or appointment to the 
judiciary may have aligned themselves with a particular political party 
and  may  have  engaged  in  partisan  political  activities.    Wisconsin 
adheres  to  the  concept  of  a  nonpartisian  judiciary.    A  candidate  for 
judicial office shall not appeal to partisanship and shall avoid partisan 
activity in the spirit of a nonpartisan judiciary.  
 
do any of the following: 
1. Be a member of any political party.  
 
 
2. Participate  in  the  affairs,  caucuses,  promotions,  platforms, 
endorsements,  conventions,  or  activities  of  a  political  party  or  of  a 
candidate for partisan office.

platforms.  
 
 (c) A partisan political office holder who is seeking election or 
appointment to judicial office or who is a judge-elect may continue to 
engage  in  partisan  political  activities  required  by  his  or  her  present 
position.  
 
 (d) 1. Paragraph (b)  does  not  prohibit  a  judge,  candidate  for 
judicial  office  or  judge-elect  from  attending,  as  a  member  of  the 
public, a public event sponsored by a political party or candidate for 
partisan office, or by the campaign committee for such a candidate.  
2. If  attendance  at  an  event  described  in  subd.  1.  requires  the 
 
purchase of a ticket or otherwise requires the payment of money, the 
amount paid by the judge, candidate for judicial office, or judge-elect 
shall not exceed an amount necessary to defray the sponsor's cost of 
the  event  reasonably  allocable  to  the  judge's,  candidate's,  or  judge-
elect's attendance.  
 (e) Nothing  in  this  subsection  shall  be  deemed  to  prohibit  a 
 
judge,  judge-elect,  or  candidate  for  judicial  office,  whether  standing 
for  election  or  seeking  an  appointment,  from  appearing  at  partisan 
political gatherings to promote his or her own candidacy. 

COMMENT 

The  rule  prohibits  political  party  membership  and  activities  by  judges,  nonincumbent 
candidates for judicial office, and judges-elect. When one becomes a candidate for judicial office 
is  determined  by  the  terms  of  SCR  60.01 (2)  which  defines  "candidate"  as  "a  person  seeking 
selection  for  or  retention  of  a  judicial  office  by  means  of  election  or  appointment  who  makes  a 
public  announcement  of  candidacy,  declares  or  files  as  a  candidate  with  the  election  or 
appointment  authority,  or  authorizes  solicitation  or  acceptance  of  contributions."  The  rule 
prohibits  judicial  candidates  and  judges-elect  as  well  as  judges  from  making  or  soliciting 
contributions to the party or its candidates and from publicly endorsing or speaking on behalf of 
partisan  candidates  or  platforms.  Although 
the  continuance  of 
nonpartisanship on the part of Wisconsin judges and those seeking judicial office, judges are not 
expected to lead lives of seclusion. As members of the public and as public officeholders, judges 
may  attend public events, even those sponsored by political parties or candidates,  so long as the 
attendance  does  not  constitute  the  kind  of  partisan  activity  prohibited  by  this  rule.  The  judge, 
judicial candidate or judge-elect is responsible for so conducting herself or himself that her or his 
presence  at  the  sponsored  event  is  not  made  to  appear  as  an  endorsement  or  other  prohibited 
political  activity.  The  judge,  judicial  candidate,  or  judge-elect  should  also  exercise  care  that  the 
price of his or her ticket to any such event does not include a prohibited political contribution.  
 

the  rule  contemplates 

(3)  Campaign Conduct and Rhetoric. 
(a) In  General. While  holding  the  office  of  judge  or  while  a 
 
candidate  for  judicial  office  or  a  judge-elect,  every  judge,  candidate 
for  judicial  office,  or  judge-elect  should  maintain,  in  campaign 

256 

   

   

 

conduct, the dignity appropriate to judicial office and the integrity and 
independence of the judiciary. A judge, candidate for judicial office, 
or  judge-elect  should  not  manifest  bias  or  prejudice  inappropriate  to 
the judicial office. Every judge, candidate for judicial office, or judge-
elect should always bear in mind the need for scrupulous adherence to 
 
the rules of fair play while engaged in a campaign for judicial office. 

COMMENT 

This  subsection  is  new.  It  states  a  rule  generally  applicable  to  judges,  candidates  for 

judicial office, and judges-elect 

judge, 

(b) Promises  and  commitments. A 

judge-elect,  or 
candidate  for  judicial  office  shall  not  make  or  permit  or  authorize 
others  to  make  on  his  or  her  behalf,  with  respect  to  cases, 
controversies,  or  issues  that  are  likely  to  come  before  the  court, 
pledges,  promises,  or  commitments  that  are  inconsistent  with  the 
impartial performance of the adjudicative duties of the office. 
 

COMMENT 

This section prohibits a candidate for judicial office from making statements that commit 
the candidate regarding cases, controversies or issues likely to come before the court. A judge or 
candidate for judicial office may not, while a proceeding is pending or impending in the court to 
which  selection  is  sought,  make  any  public  comment  that  may  reasonably  be  viewed  as 
committing  the  judge,  judge-elect  or  candidate  to  a  particular  case  outcome.  As  a  corollary,  a 
candidate  should  emphasize  in  any  public  statement  the  candidate's  duty  to  uphold  the  law 
regardless  of  his  or  her  personal  views.  This  section  does  not  prohibit  a  candidate  from  making 
pledges  or  promises  respecting  improvements  in  court  administration.  Nor  does  this  section 
prohibit an incumbent judge from making private statements to other judges or court personnel in 
the  performance  of  judicial  duties.  This  section  applies  to  any  statement  made  in  the  process  of 
securing judicial office, such as statements to commissions charged with judicial selection. 

(c) Misrepresentations. A  candidate  for  a  judicial  office  shall 
not  knowingly  or  with  reckless  disregard  for  the  statement's  truth  or 
falsity  misrepresent  the  identity,  qualifications,  present  position,  or 
other  fact  concerning  the  candidate  or  an  opponent.  A  candidate  for 
judicial  office  should  not  knowingly  make  representations  that, 
although true, are misleading, or knowingly make statements that are 
likely to confuse the public with respect to the proper role of judges 
and lawyers in the American adversary system. 

   

   

   

   

   

 

   

257 

COMMENT 

This subsection is new. The  first sentence is based on the  August 2003 amendments to 

the ABA model code of conduct.   

 
 
The  second  sentence  is  aspirational.  Thus,  "should"  is  used  rather  than  "shall."  The 
remaining  standards  are  mandatory  and  prohibit  candidates  from  knowingly  or  with  reckless 
disregard  for  the  truth  making  various  specific  types  of  misrepresentations.  Candidates  are  not 
responsible  for  misrepresentations  or  misleading  statements  made  by  third  parties  not  subject  to 
the control of the candidate, e.g., through independent expenditures by interest groups.  

lawful  campaign  contributions  from 

 (4) Solicitation and Acceptance of Campaign Contributions. A 
judge, candidate for judicial office, or judge-elect shall not personally 
solicit or accept campaign  contributions. A candidate may, however, 
establish  a  committee  to  solicit  and  accept  lawful  campaign 
contributions.  The  committee  is  not  prohibited  from  soliciting  and 
accepting 
lawyers,  other 
individuals or entities even though the contributor may be involved in 
a  proceeding  in  which  the  judge,  candidate  for  judicial  office,  or 
judge-elect  is  likely  to  participate.  A  judge  or  candidate  for  judicial 
office  or  judge-elect  may  serve  on  the  committee  but  should  avoid 
direct  involvement  with the  committee's  fundraising  efforts.  A  judge 
or candidate for judicial office or judge-elect may appear at his or her 
own  fundraising  events.  When  the  committee  solicits  or  accepts  a 
contribution,  a  judge,  candidate  for  judicial  office,  or  judge-elect 
should  also  be  mindful  of  the  requirements  of  SCR  60.03  and 
60.04(4);  provided,  however,  that  the  receipt  of  a  lawful  campaign 
contribution shall not, by itself, warrant judicial recusal.  

 

COMMENT 

Under  longstanding  Wisconsin  law,  a  judicial  candidate  may  not  personally  solicit  or 
accept campaign contributions. However, a judicial candidate may form and rely upon a campaign 
committee  to  solicit  and  accept  contributions  for  the  judicial  campaign.    Lawyers,  other 
individuals, and entities are not excluded from this process merely because committee members or 
contributors may be involved in proceedings in which the judge is likely to participate. 

The  solicitation  of  contributions  from  participants  in  judicial  proceedings  is  always  a 
matter requiring close, careful attention. Campaign committees should be sensitive to the existence 
of pending litigation, the proximity of judicial elections, and the wording of campaign solicitations 
to avoid the appearance of promise or pressure. 

A judge should avoid having his or her name listed on another's fundraising solicitation 
even when the listing is accompanied with a disclaimer that the name is not listed for fundraising 
purposes.

Acknowledgement  by  a  judge  or  candidate  for  judicial  office  of  a  contribution  in  a 

 
courtesy thank you letter is not prohibited. 
 

(5) 

 Solicitation  and  Acceptance  of  Endorsements. A  judge 
or  candidate  for  judicial  office  may  solicit  or  accept  endorsements 
supporting  his  or  her  election  or  appointment  personally  or  through 
his or her committee. A judge, candidate for judicial office, or his or 
her  committee  is  not  prohibited  from  soliciting  and  accepting 
endorsements  from  lawyers  and  others.  A  judge  or  candidate  for 
judicial  office  shall  not  knowingly  personally  solicit  or  accept 
endorsements from parties who have a case pending before the court 
to which election or appointment is sought. Nevertheless, a judge or 
judicial candidate may personally solicit or accept endorsements from 
the types of  organizations that ordinarily  make recommendations for 
selection  to  the  office.  In  soliciting  or  accepting  an  endorsement,  a 
judge  or  candidate  for  judicial  office  should  be  mindful  of  the 
requirements of SCR 60.03 and 60.04 (4). 
 

COMMENT 

This  subsection  is  new.  In  light  of  the  restrictions  on  campaign  rhetoric  under  SCR 
60.06 (3),  the  receiving  of  endorsements  is  an  important  method  of  informing  the  electorate  of 
broad-based  and  presumably  informed  support  for  a  particular  candidacy.  Knowing  solicitation 
and  acceptance  of  endorsements  from  current  litigants  are  prohibited.  Candidates  for  judicial 
office may solicit and accept endorsements from entities that regularly endorse candidates, such as 
newspapers and trade organizations. Neither culling nor cross-checking of names on mailing lists 
or dockets is required. 
 

60.07 Applicability.  
(1)  General. Subject  to  sub. (2),  all  judges  shall  comply  with 
this  chapter.  Candidates  for  judicial  office  and  judges-elect  shall 
comply with SCR 60.06. 

(2) Part-time  Judicial  Service. A  judge  who  serves  on  a  part-
time basis, including a reserve judge, a part-time municipal judge or a 
part-time  court  commissioner,  is  not  required  to  comply  with  the 
following: SCR 60.05 (3) (a), (b) and (c) 1b., 2.a, and c., (4) (a) 1.b., 
(b) (c), (d) and (e), (5), (6), (7) and (8). All circuit court commissioners 
appointed  under  SCR  75.02  (1)  and  those  supplemental  court 
commissioners authorized under SCR 75.02 (3) who have performed 40 
hours or more of circuit court commissioner duties during the preceding 
calendar year shall comply with SCR 60.05 (8).

except  that,  to  achieve  staggered  terms,  three  of  the  members  first 
appointed,  shall  serve  for  one  year,  three  members  for  two  years,  and

(a)    Render  formal  advisory  opinions  and  give  informal  advice 
concerning the compliance of contemplated or proposed future conduct

under  the  direction  of  a  chair  appointed  by  the  supreme  court.    The 
supreme  court  shall  also  appoint  a  vice  chair  who  shall  assume  the 
responsibilities of the chair in the event the chair is unable to act for a 
period  longer  than  five  business  days.    The  chair  and  vice  chair  shall 
each  serve  for  a  term  of  one  year  and  may  serve  not  more  than  two 
successive  terms.    Staff  of  the  director  of  state  courts  office  shall  be 
available  to  answer  inquiries  concerning  committee  procedures,  to 
receive and process requests for formal advisory opinions, to maintain 
committee records, and to provide other staff assistance as appropriate. 
(4)  Requests  for  opinion  or  advice.    Formal  advisory 
 
opinions  and  informal  advice  may  be  requested  by  a  judge  or  a 
candidate  for  judicial  office  about  his  or  her  own  contemplated  or 
proposed future conduct.  A request for a formal advisory opinion shall 
be submitted in writing and include a detailed statement of all relevant 
facts  and  circumstances,  a  discussion  of  the  issues  presented  in  the 
request, and references to the relevant provisions of the code of judicial 
conduct, advisory opinions, case law, and other authority the requestor 
has consulted in the matter.  A request for informal advice may be made 
orally  or  in  writing  to  any  member  of  the  committee.    The  identity, 
organizational  affiliation,  and  geographic 
location  of  a  person 
requesting  a  formal  advisory  opinion  or  informal  advice  shall  be 
confidential. 
  The  committee  shall 
 
determine  whether  a  request  for  a  formal  advisory  opinion  should  be 
resolved  with  a  written,  published  opinion  or  by  letter  or  other 
communication.    A  formal  advisory  opinion  shall  be  decided  by  a 
majority vote of the committee.  The committee may confer in person, 
by correspondence or by telephone or other electronic means as needed 
to  conduct  committee  business  and  consider  requests  for  formal 
advisory  opinions.    The  committee  shall  maintain  records  of  its 
determinations and formal advisory opinions. 
(6)  Formal advisory opinion.  Formal advisory opinions shall 
 
be  edited  to  omit  the  names  of  persons,  courts,  places  and  any  other 
information that may tend to identify the requestor or any other person.  
Before issuing a formal advisory opinion, the committee shall provide a 
copy  of  the  opinion  to  the  requestor,  and  the  requestor  may  ask  the 
committee  to  omit  from  its  specified  information  that  may  tend  to 
identify  the  requestor  or  any  other  person.    In  the  event  necessary 
editing  produces  an  opinion  that  the  committee  determines  is  not

meaningful,  the  committee  may  determine  that  a  formal  advisory 
opinion not be published and distribute it only to the requestor. 
 
(7)  Opinion  distribution.    Except  as  provided  in  sub.  (6),  a 
formal advisory opinion shall be distributed to the requestor, the justices 
and clerk of the supreme court, the chief judge of the court of appeals, 
the chief judges of the judicial administrative districts in this state, the 
director  of  state  courts,  the  state  law  library,  and  the  state  bar  of 
Wisconsin.    Formal  advisory  opinions  shall  be  accumulated  and 
distributed to all judges at least annually by the office of the director of 
state courts. 
 
(8)  Reconsideration.  Within 30 days after the distribution of 
a formal advisory opinion to all judges, a person authorized to request 
an  opinion  may  ask  the  committee  to  reconsider  the  formal  advisory 
opinion by  submitting  a  written  request  for  reconsideration  explaining 
the basis for the request.  The committee shall respond to the request by 
reaffirming  or  revising  the  formal  advisory  opinion  or  by  denying  the 
request.    The  committee  may,  on its  own motion,  reconsider a formal 
advisory opinion at any time.  A revised formal advisory opinion shall 
be distributed as provided in sub. (7). 
 
(a)    A  formal  advisory 
opinion shall not be binding upon the Wisconsin judicial commission or 
the  supreme  court

the  exercise  of 
responsibilities.  The fact that a judge or candidate for judicial office has 
requested  and  relied  upon  a  formal  advisory  opinion  should  be  taken 
into account by the Wisconsin judicial commission in its disposition of 
complaints and in determining whether to file a formal complaint with 
the  supreme  court.    If  a  judge  or  candidate  for  judicial  office  has 
requested  and  received  a  formal  advisory  opinion,  compliance  of  the 
judge  or  the  candidate  for  judicial  office  with  that  opinion  shall 
constitute  evidence  of  a  good  faith  effort  to  comply  with  the  code  of 
judicial conduct in a judicial disciplinary proceeding based, in whole or 
in part, on the conduct for which the opinion was requested. 
 
(b)  Reliance  of  a  judge  or  candidate  for  judicial  office  on 
informal advice given by the committee or by any of its members may 
not constitute evidence of a good faith effort to comply with the code of 
judicial conduct. 
 
(10)  Confidentiality.  With the exception of published formal 
advisory  opinions,  all  opinions,  inquiries,  replies,  circulated  drafts, 
records,  documents,  files, communications with staff,  and proceedings

the  person  requesting  the  formal  advisory  opinion  or  informal  advice 
expressly  waives  confidentiality  in  writing  or  relies  on  the  opinion  or 
advice  in  a  judicial  disciplinary  proceeding.    Notwithstanding  any 
waiver, committee deliberations shall be confidential. 
 
(11)  Immunity.    Members  of  the  committee  shall  be  immune 
from  liability  for  any  conduct  relating  directly  or  indirectly  to  their 
duties  for the  committee.    When  acting in their advisory  capacity,  the 
judge  members of the  committee shall be exempt  from  the provisions 
regarding  disciplinary  responsibilities  in  the  code  of  judicial  conduct 
and  the  attorney  members  of  the  committee  shall  be  exempt  from  the 
provisions  regarding  reporting  misconduct  in  the  rules  of  professional 
conduct for attorneys. 
B.  Procedures of the Judicial Conduct Advisory Committee 
 
 
(1)  Request  for  formal  advisory  opinions.   A  request for  a 
formal advisory opinion shall be in writing and shall be addressed to the 
chair  of  the  committee.    The  requestor  shall  also  send  a  copy  of  the 
request  to  the  director  of  state  courts.    The  request  shall  include  a 
detailed statement of all relevant facts and circumstances, a discussion 
of  the  issues  presented  in  the  request,  and  references  to  the  relevant 
provisions of the code of judicial conduct, advisory opinions, case law, 
and  other  authority  the  requestor  has  consulted  in  the  matter.    The 
identity, organizational affiliation, and geographic location of a person 
requesting a formal advisory opinion shall be confidential. 
 
(2)  Consideration of Request.  (a)  The chair of the committee 
shall  assign  requests  for  formal  advisory  opinions  in  rotation  to 
committee  members  for  research  and  preparation  of  preliminary 
recommendations and draft opinions.  If the information provided in the 
request  is  insufficient  in  detail  to  enable  the  committee  to  render  a 
formal  advisory  opinion,  the  committee  shall  request  supplemental 
information from the requestor to enable it to render a formal advisory 
opinion.  If the requested supplemental information is insufficient or is 
not provided within 10 days of the request, the committee shall so state 
in  a  letter  to  the  requestor  and  shall  not  render  a  formal  advisory 
opinion. 
 
(b)  Within 30 days after receipt of the assignment of the request 
or  receipt  of  sufficient  supplemental  information,  if  requested,  the 
member to whom the request is assigned shall circulate to all committee 
members  a  preliminary  recommendation  and  draft  opinion.    Prior  to

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
