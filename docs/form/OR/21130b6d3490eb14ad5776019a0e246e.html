      <pre>Domestic Abuse* Information for Child Custody and Parenting Time 
Evaluators 
 

Why should Custody Evaluators screen for domestic abuse in every case? 

ffective and accurate evaluations require knowledge of all relevant facts. Domestic abuse not only 
affects those who are abused, but also has a substantial effect on children, family members, friends, co-
workers, other witnesses, and the community at large. Children who grow up witnessing domestic 
abuse are among those seriously affected by this behavior. Identifying the existence of domestic abuse 
and its past, present, and continuing impact children is critical to recommending safe and appropriate 
parenting plans. Frequent exposure to abuse in the home impacts children and youth neurologically, 
psychologically, socially, academically, and behaviorally, likely resulting in trauma, diminished health, 
and other life challenges.  

  By the time children in the U.S. are between 14-17 years of age, 27% have been exposed to 

 

intimate partner violence. 1 
In the same study, when courts included self-reporting, the incidence of domestic violence was 
78%.2 

  A National Center for State Courts study suggested that up to 24% to 27% of disputed custody 
cases have court documented domestic violence (based on history of protective orders or 
criminal domestic violence cases).3 These are the most physical and reported incidences.  
Locally, 36% of Multnomah County Family Court Services’ mediation clients report on intake 
paperwork that they have concerns for their safety. Staff report they are able to identify 
domestic abuse in about 50% of cases.4 

 

  Exposure to abusive behavior can be as damaging as being directly abused.   

ue to the prevalence noted above and the important implications for custody and parenting time 

decisions, Oregon law (ORS 107.137; (1) (d)) specifically requires the consideration of “the abuse of one 
parent by the other” as a factor in deciding the custody of minor children. New information has 
emerged regarding best practices for assessing domestic abuse in custody cases and nationwide surveys 
indicate that many evaluators have not updated their competency in this area.   

dditionally, the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), the Association of Family and 
Conciliation Courts (AFCC), and the American Psychological Association (APA) require that custody 
evaluators understand and follow the laws governing parenting decisions about children.  NASW, AFCC, 
and Oregon’s State Family Law Advisory Council (OFLAC) specify that custody evaluators receive training 
about intimate partner abuse.  NASW considers domestic abuse one of six Areas of Evaluation.  The 
AFCC recently published guidelines and several national organizations have devoted grant money and 
conference time to ensuring that Custody Evaluators have access to resources to update their training in 
this area. 

                                                           
* Domestic Abuse is used throughout this document to include coercive, power and control dynamics, instead of 
solely criminal, physical violence. When statistics are cited related to intimate partner or domestic violence, they 
do include all forms of abuse, not just physical.

Therefore, credible evaluations require investigating domestic abuse.  Asking if there is domestic 
abuse is only the first step. Parties (including children) may not wish to discuss abuse for a variety of 
reasons, including worry for safety, discomfort, trauma response, shame, and fear of retaliation. 
Additionally, victims may fail to recognize their partner’s behaviors constitute domestic violence. Often 
people in abusive situations will use euphemisms when describing abuse, such as ager, communication 
problems, fighting, controlling, behaviors, or high conflict. Peter Jaffe found that about 20% of cases in 
family court are labeled as “high conflict,” but the majority of these have domestic abuse as a significant 
issue.5  People that are abused, often take responsibility for abuse by saying things like “I push buttons” 
or “I have a mouth on me.” 

lso, important to note that there is not a psychological profile for people that are abusive. An abusive 

person’s profile on tests such as the MMPI often look normal, while an abused person’s profile looks 
abnormal due to trauma from the abuse.  

ithout understanding of domestic abuse, adaptive coping mechanisms can be seen as bad or impaired 
parenting. Once a frame of domestic abuse dynamics is imposed on the case, those coping mechanisms 
are seen as savvy.  Also, take note of what is driving the disclosure, concern for the child(ren) or 
contempt of the other parent.  

t is important that Custody Evaluators recognize the characteristics of abuse so they do not overlook or 
misunderstand behaviors that might further jeopardize child or parent’s safety. Keep in mind that clients 
are more likely to disclose if they: 

  Know you are talking about this subject with all of your clients -- they are not being singled out; 
  Know why the information is important to their case; 
  Understand how the information will be used; 
  Know that they will be heard and understood; 
  Are confident the evaluator understands the impact of domestic abuse on families; and 
  Are confident that disclosure will not lead to further abuse to them or their children. 

ffective evaluations address domestic abuse directly. The goal in each case in which domestic abuse is 
identified is to: 

  Understand the nature of the abuse; 
  Understand the context of abuse; 
  Make factual findings that support the existence of abuse; 
  Determine the implications of abuse; and 
  Account for the abuse in conclusions and recommendations. 

hen domestic abuse is identified, it is important to be very specific in your report regarding the 

procedures used to identify the features of the abuse enumerated above, to identify the impact on the 
children, and to write a specific plan to address safety.  Be specific about details in safety focused 
parenting plans and leave as few things up for negotiation as possible. Plan multiple options for items 
that may likely need to change, like if a family member is supervising exchanges, think of a secondary 
contact.  In general, parenting plans that have flexibility can be easier for families, but in domestic 
violence each opportunity for negotiation offers opportunities to manipulate or exert control.  It is 
perfectly acceptable to acknowledge uncertainties, but equally important to account for them in your 
recommendations.  Also, be prepared to make appropriate referrals and address any immediate safety 
concerns for parents and their children.  Information about resources and relevant laws is included 
below.

Finally, the presence of domestic abuse has safety implications not only for the victim and their children, 
but also for you and your staff.  Being aware of the issue will help you identify and address potential 
safety concerns.  Information about safety planning is included below. Domestic abuse not only affects 
those who are abused, but also has a substantial effect on family members, friends, co-workers, other 
witnesses, and the community at large. Children who grow up witnessing domestic violence are among 
those seriously affected by this behavior. Frequent exposure to violence in the home can impact 
children and youth psychologically, socially, academically, and behaviorally, resulting in trauma, 
diminished health outcomes, and low academic achievement. By the time children in the U.S. are 
between 14-17 years of age, 27% have been exposed to intimate partner violence.  

hat is domestic abuse?6 

omestic abuse is a pattern of abusive behavior in any relationship that is used by one partner to gain or 

maintain power and control over the other partner.  It may or may not be illegal behavior. Domestic 
abuse can be physical, sexual, emotional, economic, stalking, or psychological actions or threats of 
actions that influence another person or used to gain/maintain power and control. This includes any 
behaviors that intimidate, manipulate, humiliate, isolate, frighten, terrorize, coerce, threaten, blame, 
hurt, injure, or wound someone. Below are some examples, these are used in service of power and 
control. 

hysical Abuse: Hitting, slapping, shoving, grabbing, pinching, biting, hair pulling, etc. are types of 

physical abuse. This type of abuse also includes denying a partner medical care (chronic issues, injuries 
from abuse, reproductive care, hormones or surgery for a transgender partner), or forcing alcohol 
and/or drug use upon them. 

exual Abuse: Coercing or attempting to coerce any sexual contact or behavior without consent. Sexual 
abuse includes, but is certainly not limited to, marital rape, attacks on sexual parts of the body, forcing 
sex after physical violence has occurred, or treating someone in a sexually demeaning manner. Sexual 
abuse can also include consequences for not having sexual contact, such as not allowing a partner to 
sleep or not allowing access to family money for food and hygiene items. These may be times 
victims/survivors say “yes” but only because they did not feel as if they could say “no” without 
consequence. 

motional Abuse: Undermining an individual's sense of self-worth and/or self-esteem is abusive. This 
may include, but is not limited to constant criticism, diminishing the other person's abilities, name-
calling, or damaging the other parent's relationship with their children. 

conomic Abuse: Preventing an individual from acquiring, using, or maintaining financial resources by 
maintaining total control over financial resources, withholding someone's access to money, forbidding 
one's attendance at school or employment, ruining the family’s credit/rental history, or not spending 
family money responsibly. 

sychological Abuse: Elements of psychological abuse include - but are not limited to - causing fear by 

intimidation; threatening physical harm to self, partner, children, or partner's family or friends; 
destruction of pets and property; causing the individual to feel “crazy” and confused; and forcing 
isolation from family, friends, school or work. 

omestic violence can happen to anyone regardless of race, age, sexual orientation, religion, or gender. 

Domestic violence affects people of all socioeconomic backgrounds and education levels. Domestic 
violence occurs in both opposite-sex and same-sex relationships and can happen to intimate partners 
who are married, living together, or dating.

Remember: 

  Violence, coupled with a pattern of control and coercion, may be predictive of escalating 

physical and potentially lethal violence. 

  Research shows that victims’ perceptions of high danger are often accurate; their perceptions of 
low danger are not. In fact, victims frequently minimize the occurrence or severity of abuse. 
  The most dangerous time for a victim is when the abuser becomes aware that the victim has 

decided to leave the relationship.  

  Children exposed to DV are at increased risk of neglect, physical and sexual abuse. 
  Many abusive or coercive behaviors that are highly relevant to the children’s well-being and to a 

well-designed parenting plan would not rise to the level that warrants criminal charges or 
qualify for a Family Abuse Protection Act Restraining Order. The absence of protection orders or 
criminal charges does not indicate an absence of domestic abuse.   
 

       

                 

                                                     

 

Domestic Abuse Screening Questions  

elow are some questions that you can integrate into your interviews with clients to screen for domestic 

abuse.  Asking questions about domestic violence is recommended in every case. The questions below 
will help initiate that conversation. “Abuse in relationships utilizes a pattern of power, control and 
exploitation established by one person over another. It is important to look further than who has done 
what to whom, because we find that virtually any behavior can either be used by a person to survive 
abuse or be used by a person to establish power over another. Rather, in assessing who is establishing 
systematic power and control in a relationship, it is crucial to look at the context, intent and effect of a 
pattern of behaviors.7” Finally, your assessment of your client’s level of comfort and your personal 
practice or style should guide when and precisely how you ask the questions.   
 

□  Have you and your partner been involved in other legal cases, including protective order 

matters?  
 

□  What happens when you and your partner disagree?  

□  Have you or your partner ever destroyed your clothing, objects in your home, or something you 

especially cared about? 

□  Have you or your partner taken the children without your consent, threatened to never let them 

see you again, or otherwise harmed them, physically or emotionally? 

□  Do you feel you have to walk on egg shells around your partner? Does your partner feel like that 

□  Have you or your partner tried to control your finances, activities outside the home, or your 

with you? 
 

contact with family or friends?  
 

□  Have you or your partner threatened to reveal sensitive information about you that may get you 
in legal trouble,  impact your work, relationships, or embarrass you in some way (e.g. “outing,” 
criminal history, legal residency status, mental health or drug/alcohol issues)? 
 

□  Do you feel safe at home or when around your partner? Does your partner feel safe with you? 

□  Does your partner prevent you from eating or sleeping, or endanger your health in other ways 
(including withholding hormones, medication, or birth control)? Do you prevent your partner? 
 

□  Have you or your partner ever hurt or threatened you (including pushing, slapping, or hitting 

□  Have you or your partner ever forced you to do something that made you uncomfortable or that 

you did not want to do, including something sexual? 
 

□  Have you or your partner threatened to take a pet away, withhold care, or harm your pet?  

□ 

 
Is there anything else about your relationship with your partner that you want to share? 
 

□  What would your partner say if asked these questions? 

you)?

Assessing the level of danger:   
If your client reveals the existence of domestic abuse, and is the victim, you can ask other questions to 
identify the dangerousness of your client’s situation. Alternatively, you may want to refer the client to a 
domestic violence program for this level of assessment.  If you choose to ask additional questions 
relating to level of danger, here are some common questions that can be used for this purpose.  
Affirmative answers to these questions indicate heightened danger and are cause for concern.8  See the 
resources link below for appropriate referrals. 
 

□  Does your partner have, or can they easily get, a gun? 

□  Has your partner ever tried to choke you? 

□ 

Is your partner constantly jealous? 

□  Does your partner try to control most of your daily activities? 

□  Has your partner ever forced you to have sex when you did not wish to do so? 

□  Have you left your partner or separated after living together or being married? 

  Make sure the victim has support in making a safety plan, especially if time is of the essence.  

For information about safety planning, go to http://stoprelationshipabuse.org/develop-a-safety-
plan/.   

  Refer the victim to a local domestic violence program for safety planning, support, and 

additional resources.  For current information about Multnomah County resources, go to

Child Custody and Visitation Decisions in Domestic Violence Cases: Legal Trends, Risk Factors and 
Safety Concerns 
Daniel G. Saunders with Karen Oehme  
Summary: It may be hard to believe that an abusive partner can ever make good on his threat to gain 
custody of the children from his victim. After all, he has a history of violent behavior and she almost 
never does. Unfortunately, a surprising number of battered women lose custody of their children (e.g., 
Saccuzzo & Johnson, 2004). This document describes how this can happen through uninformed and 
biased courts, court staff, evaluators, and attorneys and how the very act of protecting ones' children 
can lead to their loss. It also describes the major legal and social trends surrounding custody and 
visitation decisions and the social science evidence supporting the need to consider domestic violence in 
these decisions. It ends with some recommendations for custody and visitation in domestic violence 
cases.

hildren in the Crossfire: Child Custody Determinations Among Couples With a History of Intimate 

Partner Violence  
Kernic, M.A., Monary-Ernsdorff, D.J., Koepsell, J.K., & Holt, V. 
Summary: Although most states mandate considerations of intimate partner violence (IPV) in child 
custody proceedings, little is known about how often a preexisting history of IPV is effectively presented 
to the courts in dissolution cases and, when it is, what effect it has on child custody and visitation 
outcomes. This retrospective cohort study examined the effects of a history of IPV, further categorized 
by whether substantiation of that history existed and whether the court handling the custody 
proceedings knew of that history, on child custody and visitation outcomes. The findings from this study 
highlight several issues of concern regarding the reality of child custody among families with a history of 
IPV. These include two primary concerns: a lack of identification of IPV even among cases with a 
documented, substantiated history, and a lack of strong protections being ordered even among cases in 
which a history of substantiated IPV is known to exist.

ustody Disputes Involving Allegations of Domestic Violence: Toward a Differentiated Approach to 

Parenting Plans 
Peter Jaffe, Janet R. Johnston, Claire Crooks, Nicholas Bala 
Summary: Premised on the understanding that domestic violence is a broad concept that encompasses 
a wide range of behaviors from isolated events to a pattern of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse 
that controls the victim, this article addresses the need for a differentiated approach to developing 
parenting plans after separation when domestic violence is alleged. A method of assessing risk by 
screening for the potency, pattern, and primary, perpetrator of the violence is proposed as a foundation 
for generating hypotheses about the type of and potential for future violence as well as parental 
functioning. This kind of differential screening for risk in cases where domestic violence is alleged 
provides preliminary guidance in identifying parenting arrangements that are appropriate for the 
specific child and family and, if confirmed by a more in-depth assessment, may be the basis for a long-

term plan. A series of parenting plans are proposed, with criteria and guidelines for usage depending 
upon this differential screening, ranging from highly restricted access arrangements (no contact with 
perpetrators of family violence and supervised access or monitored exchange) to relatively unrestricted 
ones (parallel parenting)and even co-parenting. Implications for practice are considered within the 
context of available resources.

ifferentiation Among Types of Intimate Partner Violence: Research Update and Implications for 

Interventions 
Kelly, J. & Johnson, M.P. 
Summary: A growing body of empirical research has demonstrated that intimate partner violence is not 
a unitary phenomenon and that types of domestic violence can be differentiated with respect to partner 
dynamics, context, and consequences. Four patterns of violence are described: Coercive Controlling 
Violence, Violent Resistance, Situational Couple Violence, and Separation-Instigated Violence. The 
controversial matter of gender symmetry and asymmetry in intimate partner violence is discussed in 
terms of sampling differences and methodological limitations. Implications of differentiation among 
types of domestic violence include the need for improved screening measures and procedures in civil, 
family, and criminal court and the possibility of better decision making, appropriate sanctions, and more 
effective treatment programs tailored to the characteristics of different types of partner violence. In 
family court, reliable differentiation should provide the basis for determining what safeguards are 
necessary and what types of parenting plans are appropriate to ensure healthy outcomes for children 
and parent–child relationships.

ifferentiating Types of Family Violence: Implications for Child Custody 

Nancy Ver Steegh 
Summary: Child custody determinations are based on the fiction that families with a history of domestic 
violence are all alike. Researchers, scholars, and practitioners increasingly agree that families experience 
(and children are exposed to) different types of domestic violence. These types of violence involve 
distinctly different phenomena - they are not simply separate points along a single continuum of 
abuse. This article examines child custody determinations through the lens of a domestic violence 
typology.  The resulting analysis (1) reconciles competing viewpoints and contradictory evidence about 
domestic violence; (2) matches families with appropriate child custody court procedures and services 
such as parent education, mediation, supervised visitation and parent coordination; and (3) exposes 
serious deficiencies in current domestic violence child custody statutes.   Application of the typology 
leads to the conclusion that child custody courts could more effectively protect children through 
identification and consideration of the type of domestic violence experienced by the family.

omestic Violence and Child Custody 

Hardesty, J.L., Haselschwerdt, M.L., & Johnson, M.P 
Summary: This article reviews the empirical research on several important aspects relevant to parenting 
plan evaluations, including explanations of the subtypes of domestic violence, a summary of the effects 
of DV on children and a discussion of the options available for parenting plans that prioritize safety and 
long-term adjustment of parents and children.  The failure of professionals to adequately differentiate 
subtypes, including cases of intimate terrorism/coercive control, increases the risk for inadequate 
interventions tailored to the specific needs of the parents, or mislabeling appropriately protective 
parents as “alienating.” The research illuminates not only that meta-analyses have well documented the 
detrimental effects of domestic violence on children, but also that there may be different effects

depending upon the age and gender of the child. “One-size-fits-all” conclusions or recommendations risk 
serious errors in divergent directions, including inappropriately over-pathologizing or stigmatizing some 
parents who will needlessly suffer unwarranted estrangement from their child, or tragically failing to 
protect the child from a parent with serious and potentially dangerous parenting deficits.

Domestic Violence, Child Custody and Child Protection: Understanding Judicial Resistance and 
Imagining the Solutions 
Joan Meier 
Summary: This article focuses on the problem of child welfare in the context of private litigation—
divorce, custody/visitation, civil protection orders. While awareness of domestic violence among 
lawmakers and jurists has increased, the understanding of domestic violence has not sufficiently 
integrated the lawmaking and court systems to survive the challenges of truly painful decisions 
regarding families.  The article offers two case studies from the author’s practice that illustrate judges’ 
resistance to battered women’s claims concerning children in private litigation.  The author 
recommends that developing a clear understanding of what is happening in private custody/domestic 
violence litigation is a necessary extension of the Green Book process.

mpirical Problems with Custody Recommendations: A Call for Clinical Humility and Judicial Vigilance 
Timothy M. Tippins, Jeffrey P. Wittmann  
Summary: This article proposes a four-level model of clinical inferences to analyze the psychological 
evaluation process in custody matters. At each level the authors summarize the status of the relevant 
psychological literature and conclude that, as clinicians respond to the ultimate issues (e.g., who should 
be the custodial parent) the empirical foundation for such conclusions is tenuous or non-existent.  A 
jurisprudence argument is also made that such opinions should be routinely excluded from the fact-
ﬁnding process. Given the signiﬁcant potential for speciﬁc custody recommendations to limit personal 
liberties and the trajectory of a child’s life, the paucity of relevant research available in this area, and 
profound evidentiary issues, such recommendations should be viewed as ethically inappropriate.  A 
model for what clinicians can ethically say to courts is proposed.

n Integrative Theoretical Model of Intimate Partner Violence, Coparenting After Separation, and 

Maternal and Child Well-Being 
Hardesty, J.L., Raffaelli, M., Khaw, L., Mitchell, E.T., Haselschwerdt, M.L., & Crossman, K.A. 
Summary: The quality of coparenting relationships after separation is known to affect mothers' and 
children's physical and mental health. It is well established that conflict is a common phenomenon 
among separating parents; however, studies rarely distinguish between relationships characterized by 
violence as opposed to conflict. Because violence creates a distinct separation and co-parenting 
experience, we propose a theoretical model that integrates these disparate literatures. The integrated 
model provides a heuristic tool to guide future theory building, research, and practice.

Summary: Limited work has looked specifically at the issue of mothering in the context of domestic 
violence, and there is a particular dearth of empirical work that focuses on women's experiences of 
mothering in these circumstances. This article reports the findings of a study that investigated women's 
experiences of mothering in the context of domestic violence, and is concerned with the challenges and 
difficulties that abused women face in regard to their mothering. The author argues that these 
challenges and difficulties arise from the interaction between the particular context created by the 
violence and the broader institution of motherhood. More specifically, the article focuses on the 
following two elements: the women's increased sense of responsibility in regard to their children and 
their loss of control over their mothering. The findings suggest that in order to support these women, 
professionals need to understand the challenges and difficulties that they face, and to be mindful not to 
exacerbate the women's sense of responsibility and loss of control.

arenting Arrangements After Domestic Violence: Safety as Priority in Judging Children’s Best Interest 

Peter Jaffe, Claire Crooks 
Summary: The purpose of this article is to discuss some of the controversies surrounding parent-child 
access and outline practical guidelines within a clinical and legal context. It begins with an overview of 
the relevance of domestic violence in custody and access disputes, then provides a framework for 
differential assessment and interventions that are based on a thorough understanding of the dynamics 
of violence in a particular relationship.  Finally, it identifies factors that should be associated with 
terminating access, supervising access, or supervising exchanges, which are the most common remedies 
in these circumstances. Each of the considerations and remedies is discussed with respect to the clinical 
and research literature, followed by judicial considerations from Judge Wong.

oward the Differentiation of High-Conflict Families: An Analysis of Social Science Research and 
Canadian Case Law 
Birnbaum, R., & Bala, N. 
Summary: Social science research and the courts have begun to recognize the special challenges posed 
by “high-conflict” separations for children and the justice system. The use of “high conflict” terminology 
by social science researchers and the courts has increased dramatically over the past decade. This is an 
important development, but the term is often used vaguely and to characterize very different types of 
cases. An analysis of Canadian case law reveals that some judges are starting to differentiate between 
various degrees and types of high conflict. Often this judicial differentiation is implicit and occurs 
without full articulation of the factors that are taken into account in applying different remedies. There 
is a need for the development of more refined, explicit analytical concepts for the identification and 
differentiation of various types of high conflict cases. Empirically driven social science research can assist 
mental health professionals, lawyers and the courts in better understanding these cases and providing 
the most appropriate interventions. As a tentative scheme for differentiating cases, we propose 
distinguishing between high conflict cases where there is: (1) poor communication; (2) domestic 
violence; and (3) alienation. Further, there must be a differentiation between cases where one parent is 
a primary instigator for the conflict or abuse, and those where both parents bear significant 
responsibility.

Custody Evaluations When There Are Allegations of Domestic Violence  
Michael S. Davis, et al.. 
Based on an examination of approximately 70 actual family law case files. In New York where domestic 
violence was pre-identified; each party was represented by an attorney; and a custody evaluation had 
been conducted.  The researchers looked at all of the documentation of abuse, each of the custody 
evaluation reports, and the final judgment or settlement agreement in each case.  They found that 
evaluators’ knowledge about domestic violence (their awareness of risk factors and application of a 
power and control model) was more closely associated with safe parenting plans than either the severity 
of abuse or the thoroughness of their investigations.

ustody Evaluators’ Beliefs about Domestic Abuse in Relation to Custody Outcomes  

Daniel G. Saunders, et al. 
Summary: Based on a national survey of 465 child custody evaluators, respondents reported on their 
past custody recommendations and responded to a vignette involving domestic 
violence.  Recommendations of sole or joint custody for the perpetrator were related to beliefs that 
survivors alienate children from the other parent, make false allegations of domestic abuse, and should 
engage in cooperative parenting.  Such recommendations were also related to the belief that domestic 
violence is not important to consider in evaluations.  The stronger the evaluators’ patriarchal norms, the 
stronger they held the foregoing beliefs and tended to recommend that perpetrators have custody.

he Effect of Domestic Violence Allegations on Custody Evaluators’ Recommendations 
Jennifer Hardesty, et al.  
Summary: Based on a national survey of 600 respondents from 48 states., surveyed custody evaluators 
were given a three-part vignette, with randomly varied facts.  Among other things, the researchers 
found that mothers’ demeanor was more closely associated with evaluators’ recommendations than the 
severity of the violence (mild v. severe), the context of the violence (conflict v. coercive control), or 
whether there was documentation of domestic violence (an order of protection) present in the vignette.
