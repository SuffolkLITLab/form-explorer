INSTRUCTIONS 
(for transmission of agency record by electronic means 
pursuant to ORAP 4.20) 

INTRODUCTION 

Purpose of Instructions 

 As provided in ORAP 4.20, a state agency may transmit the agency record on 
judicial review of a state agency order to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme 
Court is by optical disk or Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).  The primary 
purposes of these instructions are to: 

•  Guide state agencies in preparing and transmitting the record for optimal use 

of optical disk and SFTP technology; 

•  Guide state agencies in uploading agency records to the OJD's SFTP site, 

and 

•  Guide attorneys and self-represented parties being served with the agency 
record by SFTP in downloading the agency record from the SFTP site. 

NOTE REGARDING SEALED AND CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS:  These 
instructions do not apply to documents in the agency record that the state 
agency or the court has ordered sealed. (A sealed document is a document 
that neither the public nor the parties to the case may view.)  The agency 
must separately submit to the court any sealed exhibit either in conventional 
paper form or on an optical disk or, with the consent of the appellate court, 
other similar digital medium, as provided in ORAP 5.20(5).    The agency 
must not serve a sealed document on any party to the judicial review. 

A confidential document is a document that the public may not view but the 
parties may.  A confidential document should be transmitted to the appellate 
court and served on the parties, but in a separate file as provided in ORAP 
4.20(5).

 3 | P a g e  

I.  REQUIREMENTS FOR AGENCY RECORDS 

•  General Requirements The record must be in portable document format 

(PDF) that allows text searching and copying and  inserting into another 
document 

•  Each part of the record (the agency file, each party’s exhibits, and the 

transcript) must be a separate PDF document, except that if the record is 
small (for instance, about 100 pages) and includes only the agency file 
and the parties exhibits, the agency file and party exhibits may be one 
PDF document  

•  The pages of agency record must be numbered.  However, when 

individual documents are combined in to a single PDF document, the PDF 
application should automatically count the pages and display the page 
count on the computer screen when PDF document is open.  The agency 
may rely on the PDF page-counting function to indicate the page numbers 
of the individual documents.  And, if the pages of the transcript are 
numbered, the agency may rely on those page numbers rather than the 
PDF page count function. 

•  The record must include an index of contents.  Each document identified in 
the index of contents must be bookmarked to its place in the record.  The 
bookmark should succinctly describe each document. 

A state agency already may have its agency record in a form that complies 
with ORAP 4.20 or the agency may have its own process for preparing the 
agency record in a form that complies with the rule.  However, if a state 
agency’s record is not in the required format and the agency lacks a process 
for putting the agency record in the required format, Section II of these 
instructions, beginning at page 15, provide guidance for doing so). A state 
agency is not required to use the record-preparation instructions in Section II; 
rather, OJD is making the instructions available for the voluntary use and 
convenience of any state agency.

A. Requirements Facilitating Filing by Electronic Means 

1.  Naming Convention Using Appellate "Short Case" Title. 

.   The  agency  must  identify  the  agency  record  using  this  convention 
<appellate  court  case  number>_<appellate  court  “short  case”  title>  or 
<appellate  court  case  number>  _<appellate  court  case  title>  <agency 
initials>,  depending  on  whether  the  state  agency  is  the  identified  in  the 
appellate court “short case” title. See examples below. 

b.  The  appellate  court  “short”  case  title  is  the  petitioner’s  last  name  (if  a 
natural  person)  or  the  petitioner’s  corporate  name,  versus  the  only 
respondent or the lead respondent. 

1)  Where State Agency is Lead or Only Respondent on Judicial Review.  
If  the  state  agency  is  the  lead  or  only  respondent  on  judicial  review, 
case 
use 
number>_<appellate court “short case” title> 

convention: 

<appellate 

naming 

court 

this 

Example:  The  agency  record  for  Court  of  Appeals  No.  A123456  in  a 
Department  of  Human  Services  case  in  which  Jane  Doe  is  the 
petitioner would be: 

A123456_Doe v Department of Human Services 

2)  Where  State  Agency  is  Not  Lead  or  Only  Respondent  on  Judicial 
Review.    If  the  agency  name  is  not  included  in  the  appellate  court 
“short  case”  title,  use  this  naming  convention:  <appellate  court  case 
number>_<appellate court “short case” title>_<agency initials>. 

Example:  The agency record for Court of Appeals No. A234567 in a 
Workers’  Compensation case  in  which  John  Roe  is  the  petitioner  and 
State Accident Insurance Fund is the only or the lead respondent: 

A234567_Roe v SAIF_WCB 
 
3)  Naming Convention for Confidential or Sealed Document.  If the 
agency record includes one or more confidential documents in a 
separate file, use this naming convention for each such file:   
<appellate court case number>_<appellate court “short case” 
title>_<confidential document(s) <#>.  If the agency record includes 
one or more sealed documents, use this naming convention for each 
file containing a sealed document:   <appellate court case 
number>_<appellate court “short case” title>_<sealed document <#>.

 Preparing Agency Record for Uploading to SFTP Site 

B. Naming Convention 

See Section II, Part B, page 5, of these instructions for a description of the 
naming conventions used to identify the agency record, including any confidential 
document that is part of the agency record, for filing with the appellate court and 
service on the parties. 

C. Preparing the Record 

1.  Combining Documents into Single PDF Document 

a.  Agency File 

The documents constituting the agency file should be combined into a 
single PDF document of up to approximately 100 pages.  Create as many 
combined PDF documents as necessary. Name each PDF document 
consistent with this convention: 

A123456_Doe v Department of Human Services_file 1 
A234567_Roe v SAIF_WCB_file 2 

 

Instructions: Agency Record Submission 

 15 | P a g e  

 

 

 

 

 

 

b.  Parties’ Exhibits 

The documents constituting each party’s exhibits should be combined into 
a single PDF document of up to approximately 100 pages.  Create as 
many combined PDF documents as necessary.  Name each PDF 
document consistent with this convention: 

A123456_Doe v Department of Human Services_pet exh 1 
A234567_Roe v SAIF_WCB_agency exh 2 

Note:  If the agency file and the parties’ exhibits together are approximately 
100 pages or less, the agency may combine all the documents into a 
single PDF document. 

Each volume of the transcript should constitute a file, named consistent 
with this convention: 

A123456_Doe v Department of Human Services_Tr Vol 1 
A234567_Roe v SAIF_WCB_Tr Vol 2 

2.  Pagination, Index of Contents, and Bookmarking Documents within Each PDF 

c.  Transcript 

Document 

a.  Generally 

When documents are combined into a single PDF document, the Adobe 
PDF application counts the pages and, when the PDF document is open, 
displays the page number on the computer screen.  Each PDF document 
containing the agency file and each PDF document containing each 
party’s exhibits should contain an index of contents.  The index of contents 
for each PDF document containing the agency file and each party’s 
exhibits should identify the page number using the PDF page count 
number where the document will be found.  Each individual document 
listed in the index should be bookmarked to where in the PDF document 
the individual document will be found. 

Note:  Create the index of contents without page numbers and bookmarks 

and add it to the PDF document first, because adding the index of 
contents will affect the PDF page count. 

If the transcript already contains its own index of contents and page 
numbers, the agency need not prepare a separate index of contents for 
the transcript.  

 

 

 

Instructions: Agency Record Submission 

 16 | P a g e  

b.  Creating an Index of Contents 

1)  Prepare an index of contents for each combined PDF document that: 

a)  Includes at the top of the first page the appellate short case title and 

the appellate case number. 

b)  Shows the first page number of each individual document in the 

combined PDF document. 

Note:  Create the index of contents without page numbers or 

bookmarks and save it to the combined PDF document first as 
described in the next part, because adding the index will affect 
the PDF page count. 

See the example at subpart E of this section below. 

2)  Saving the Index of Contents 

Save the index of contents in PDF format.  The system will prompt for a 
file name.  Move the index of Contents to the combined PDF document 
as the first document. 

c.  Creating Bookmarks 

Follow these instructions to create a bookmark for each individual 
document in the Index of Contents for each combined PDF document. 

Note:  If you used Adobe Acrobat Pro to combine individual documents, 

including the Index of Contents, into one PDF, then Adobe Acrobat 
Pro will have created the bookmarks for each document included 
into the PDF document. The next step is to complete the 
bookmarks in the Index of Contents, but skip step 8 below. 

1.  Open the document that contains the Index of Contents. 

2.  Select the item "Tools" from the Tool Bar. A task pane will display 

on the left side of the application window. 

   

 

3.  Select "Content Editing" to display available commands.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
