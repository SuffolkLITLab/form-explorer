Introduction 

While remote interpreting is the best way to avoid being exposed to COVID-19, some matters must still be 
interpreted in-person. The Chief Justice’s order gives each Presiding Judge discretion to order that a trial, 
hearing or proceeding be conducted in-person if sufficient social distancing can be maintained. The Chief’s 
order also provides that the court can order reasonable precautions to protect the health of the 
participants, including victims, interpreters, and court staff.  

Procedures and protocols for conducting in-person hearings during the pandemic may vary from county to 
county and courtroom to courtroom. The interpreter must evaluate the interpreting needs of each hearing 
and be prepared to advise the court on appropriate interpreting technology and procedures.  

At all times, the interpreter must obey the orders of the court and adhere to their duty under the Code of 
Professional Responsibility for Interpreters in Oregon Courts. 

If the court deems it necessary for you to provide your services in person, please follow these general 
recommendations. 

Traveling to and from an interpreting assignment:  

• Keep a safe distance from others (as of 3/27/2020—a minimum of six feet per the Chief Justice’s 

Order)  

• CLAS highly recommends that interpreters wear a protective face covering while traveling to and 

from an interpreting assignment and while in the courthouse. In fact, the presiding judge in most 
judicial districts has ordered the use of protective face coverings while inside their court facilities. 

• Learn how to safely put on and take off face coverings and gloves (if you wear them). 
• Enter the courthouse only when needed and don’t congregate there. (consider staying in your car as 

an isolation base when you are on a duty block) 

• Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use hand sanitizer. 
• Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw used tissues in a lined 

trash can.  

• Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.  
• Avoid touching shared court equipment (e.g. pens, microphones, stands, lecterns, the “interpreter 

phone”). You may want to consider wearing gloves while in the courthouse. 

• Avoid using public transportation.  

Simultaneous interpreting in-person 

CLAS believes that the safest way for an interpreter and interpreter teams to provide simultaneous 
interpreting in person is through the use of wireless interpreting equipment and recommends some 
additional precautions: 

•  To facilitate clear communication, the interpreter may need to remove their face covering while 
interpreting. The interpreter should exercise professional judgment as to when this might be 
appropriate. If the interpreter does decide to remove their face covering, they should request 
permission from the judge. 

•  The interpreter should maintain appropriate social distancing from hearing participants, the public 
and other interpreters (as of 3/27/2020—a minimum of six feet per the Chief Justice’s Order). 
•  While CLAS owned interpreting equipment is still available to sign out, interpreters should consider 

bringing their own interpreting equipment to assignments. Interpreters should consider: 

o  Buying their own equipment, and 
o  Buying extra microphone wind-guards/pop-filters.

•  The interpreter must disinfect the transmitter, microphone(s), receiver(s), headphone(s) and 

batteries before each use—then wash their hands. 
Interpreters should not share microphones.  

• 

o  Use one microphone for each member of the interpreting team.  
o  When team members switch places, unplug the microphone and disinfect the transmitter 

before exchanging it. 

•  The interpreter must disinfect each headphone and receiver set before giving it to an LEP user.  
• 

If LEP users refuse to use the headphones and receiver, the interpreter should advise the court and 
ask for guidance. 

•  The interpreter should avoid touching shared court equipment such as notepads, pens, 

microphones, stands, lecterns, etc.  

•  The interpreter must disinfect the transmitter, microphone(s), receiver(s), headphone(s) and 

batteries after each use—then wash their hands. 

Consecutive interpreting in-person 

• The interpreter should assess the environment they are going to interpret in. If there are concerns, 

the interpreter should make them known and ask the judge for help resolving them.  

o To facilitate clear communication, the interpreter may need to remove their face covering 
while interpreting. The interpreter should exercise professional judgment as to when this 
might be appropriate. If the interpreter does decide to remove their face covering, they 
should request permission from the judge. 

o The interpreter should be positioned in a safe location, as of 3/27/2020, that means a 

minimum of six feet away from others per the Chief Justice’s Order (e.g. in the jury box, in 
the gallery, several steps away from counsel table, behind the glass at a counter). 

o The interpreter may want to advise the judge that, for social distancing purposes, they will be 

using the consecutive mode.   

• The interpreter should be positioned near enough to a courtroom microphone to ensure that their 

voice is picked up for the FTR recording. 

• Consecutive mode interpretation can be used to avoid having to use the same set of headphones on 

several LEP participants.   

Privileged in-person communication 

When the interpreter is in-person, appropriate social distancing makes the usual heads together 
whispered consultation huddle problematic. 

• Some judges ask the party and their attorney to move to a separate area to allow for private 

• Other judges order the courtroom cleared and the FTR turned off allowing the confidential 

communication with adequate spacing. 

communication to occur in the courtroom. 

• Another option is for the interpreter to establish a 3-way call between the interpreter, the attorney 
and the LEP client through the interpreter’s private phone. The 3-way call is interpreted in the 
consecutive mode at a volume that is not audible to others. The interpreter should block their 
phone number from appearing on the receiver’s phone by entering code *67 followed by the 
attorney and LEP client phone numbers (e.g. *67-503-986-1234)

An in-person interpreting Case Study 

Recently, I worked in a courtroom that had a strict “face mask” policy. I wore my face mask in the 
courtroom until the case I was assigned to interpret for was called. At which time I requested 
permission to remove my face covering. The judge allowed it. I continued to follow other social 
distancing protocols: standing 6 feet from other participants and using the hand sanitizer provided 
by the court before and after removing my mask.  

In my experience judges have been very understanding and accommodating especially when they 
see interpreters demonstrating professionalism and a concern for public safety.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
