      <pre>OJD Video Remote Interpreting FAQ 

These recommendations are guidelines that attempt to balance the most reliable, least intrusive, simplest and most cost-
effective options to provide simultaneous interpretation to an OJD WebEx court hearing. The interpreter can utilize other 
options  but  should  take  steps  to  avoid  unduly  encumbering  the  conduct  of  the  hearing.  Understanding the  principles 
behind the dual channel architecture for simultaneous interpreting is key. Interpreters and other hearing participants will 
need to be creative and flexible to meet the needs of each hearing or assignment. 

At all times the interpreter must adhere to their duty under the Code of Professional Responsibility for Interpreters in 
Oregon Courts (CPR). 

1. Can the use of this technology (i.e. headphones, earbuds, cell phones and conferencing software) cause injury to the 

interpreter? 

2. Can two VRI interpreters work together under the dual architecture system? 
3. How can a team of VRI interpreters communicate with each other about when to switch?  
4. How can a team of VRI interpreters communicate an interpreter switch to the court?  
5. Can a team of VRI interpreters use Webex to text each other? 
6. Can the interpreter connect to a WebEx hearing through an iPad?  
7. Should the interpreter always have their webcam on while interpreting or can it be turned off? 
8. Can an LEP participant connect to the Webex platform on their cell phone while they are simultaneously on the call 

with the interpreter? 

9. How can the interpreter view files that are introduced or submitted during a hearing?  
10. Will the WebEx court hearing be able to hear the non-English language through the LEP participant’s WebEx 
connection while the interpreter is interpreting simultaneously through the phone connection? 

11. What if the LEP participant doesn’t have reliable internet service or doesn’t have an appropriate device? 
12. How does the interpreter get the LEP Participant’s Phone number? 
13. Will the LEP participant be able to see the interpreter’s phone number? 
14. Some LEP (and other) phones will not accept non-identified calls, i.e. preceded by *67. Is there a way around this?  
15.  What do I do if I receive a phone call while interpreting for the WebEx court hearing? 
16. When an LEP participant is connected to the interpreter via telephone, will the content of the phone call be recorded 

for the record? 

17. How can the LEP participant’s statements be recorded? 
18. Can the LEP participant be connected to the WebEx hearing? 
19. Can the LEP participant hear the original English statements made in the WebEx hearing?  
20. If the LEP participant can’t hear the English speaker’s voices, how will they know who is saying what? 
21. Can the interpreter use a landline to call LEP?  
22. Can we use an online service (e.g. Google Voice) or other device or internet service to establish the non-English line?  
23. Is a wired connection for both phone and pc/tablet required?  
24. Does WebEx work with a Safari browser? 
25. What internet speed is needed for good quality interpretation. 
26. Can you connect to a WebEx hearing through a Virtual Private Network (VPN) over a public network?  
27. Does this system serve in-custody defendants?  
28. When the interpreter’s phone is connected to both the LEP participant and their attorney for a confidential 

conversation, can the conversation be interpreted simultaneously?

29. What does the interpreter do if the LEP participant asks a question or says something while the Judge or attorney is 

speaking?  

30. What if there is poor sound quality on the phone connection to the LEP Participant? 
31. How does the interpreter ask the Judge to instruct the LEP person to speak in short sentences or repeat something? 
32. Does relying on the interpreter’s smart phone connection encourage the LEP participant’s personal dependence on 

the interpreter which is prohibited by Canon 3 of the CPR, “IMPARTIALITY AND AVOIDANCE OF CONFLICT OF 
INTEREST? 

33. Does using the interpreter’s own smart phone service plan and equipment to perform this service, make the 

interpreter responsible for monitoring the connectivity and quality of the Non-English Line? The commentary 
under Canon 8 SCOPE OF PRACTICE states, “The interpreter . . . shall not . . . engage in any other activities that 
may be construed to constitute a service other than interpreting or translating.” 

1. Can the use of this technology (i.e. headphones, earbuds, cell phones and conferencing software) cause injury to 

the interpreter? 

Acoustic injuries (sometimes called acoustic shock) have been reported during the use of these technologies.  
The interpreter can reduce the risk of injury by adjusting the maximum volume of the sound they receive to an 
appropriate level and/or using devices designed to prevent acoustic shock (i.e. a digital acoustic shock 
protection device or a headset equipped with acoustic protection technology). The issue of acoustic safety for all 
video conference participants should be a primary consideration for platform venders and be a focus of 
continuous improvement similar to issues around security and video quality. 

2. Can two VRI interpreters work together under the dual architecture system? 

Yes: 

•  Each interpreter establishes their own WebEx connection to the hearing.  
•  Then, the 1st interpreter calls the 2nd interpreter via cell phone.  
•  After the call is established, the 1st interpreter calls the LEP participant and merges them into a 3-way 

call with the other interpreter. This phone call is the non-English line.  

During the hearing, the interpreters take turns interpreting to the LEP participant through the merged cell 
phone call. 

3. How can a team of VRI interpreters communicate with each other about when to switch?  

The interpreters use their 3-way cell phone connection (see above) to communicate with each other. The 
interpreting team can also make an independent but secure connection using a different platform (e.g. 
WhatsApp) for their own private communication. 

4. How can a team of VRI interpreters communicate an interpreter switch to the court?  

When it is time to switch interpreters, the off interpreter unmutes their WebEx line to the court hearing and 
advises the court of the switch. 

5. Can a team of VRI interpreters use Webex to text each other? 

Probably not. OJD recommends to judges that the chat feature be disabled for everyone in an OJD WebEx 
hearing. Judges have the authority to make a different decision. The interpreting team can make an 
independent and secure connection using a different platform (e.g. WhatsApp) for their own private 
communication. 

6. Can the interpreter connect to a WebEx hearing through an iPad?  

Probably, but we have not tested this option.  

7. Should the interpreter always have their webcam on while interpreting or can it be turned off?  

VRI Training Webinar FAQ.docx 

 

Page 2 of 5 

It is not necessary for a spoken language interpreter to always have their webcam on. In fact, turning off the 
webcam may be a useful technique to use if the interpreter is experiencing bandwidth issues that are degrading 
the audio quality. Defer to the judge’s instructions.  

8. Can an LEP participant connect to the Webex platform on their cell phone while they are simultaneously on the call 

with the interpreter?  

Technically yes by making a 3-way call between the interpreter and the telephone call-in line belonging to the 
WebEx hearing. But if the LEP participant does this, they will hear all of the simultaneous non-English 
interpretation on the phoneline and all the English spoken in the WebEx hearing at the same time. The two 
languages would overlap each other. The LEP participant could use a computer or other device to connect to the 
WebEx hearing. They should mute their line into the WebEx hearing to avoid sound distortion. Then they can 
adjust the volume on either the non-English line (to the interpreter) or the English line (to the WebEx hearing) to 
reduce the overlapping interference of the two languages. 

9. How can the interpreter view files that are introduced or submitted during a hearing?  

OJD recommends to judges that all exhibits be submitted electronically before the hearing and shared within the 
WebEx software when introduced into evidence. The interpreter will be able to view the exhibits while they are 
being shared. 

10. Will the WebEx court hearing be able to hear the non-English language through the LEP participant’s WebEx 

connection while the interpreter is interpreting simultaneously through the phone connection? 

The non-English interpretation will not be audible in the hearing IF: 

•  The interpreter mutes their WebEx line while they are simultaneously interpreting into the non-English 

•  The LEP participant mutes their direct connection to the WebEx hearing (if they have one) any time they 

language over the phone connection AND  

are not speaking directly into the WebEx hearing. 

11. What if the LEP participant doesn’t have reliable internet service or doesn’t have an appropriate device? 

When this is the case, it is for the court to decide how to proceed. Hopefully the LEP participant will have made 
this issue known before the hearing. If it comes up during the hearing and presents an impediment to the 
interpretation, the interpreter must report it to the court per the CPR 

12. How does the interpreter get the LEP Participant’s Phone number? 

If the CLAS scheduler is aware that the hearing will be interpreted simultaneously, they will provide the LEP 
participant’s phone number in the interpreter’s confirmation. If the phone number is not in the confirmation, 
the interpreter can ask their CLAS scheduler to get it from the court. 

13. Will the LEP participant be able to see the interpreter’s phone number?  

No, if the interpreter enters *67 into their phone followed by the LEP participant’s phone number. 

14. Some LEP (and other) phones will not accept non-identified calls, i.e. preceded by *67. Is there a way around this?  

The CLAS scheduler will ask the court to advise the LEP to expect a phone call from the interpreter at the start 
time of their hearing. 

15.  What do I do if I receive a phone call while interpreting for the WebEx court hearing? 

The best course of action is to temporarily block incoming calls. Select Do Not Disturb (DND) in your settings 
menu to prevent incoming calls while you are connected to the LEP participant. On an Android device, you will 
need to go to settings, notifications, then select Do Not Disturb.

16. When an LEP participant is connected to the interpreter via telephone, will the content of the phone call be 

recorded for the record? 

No, the statements and interpretation on the phone line are not recorded. 

17. How can the LEP participant’s statements be recorded?  

If the court wants the LEP’s non-English statements to be recorded, the court must ensure that the LEP 
participant has their own connection to the WebEx hearing either by computer or another device. 

18. Can the LEP participant be connected to the WebEx hearing? 

The LEP participant can establish a connection to the WebEx hearing using a computer or other device that is 
separate from their telephone connection to the interpreter.  

19. Can the LEP participant hear the original English statements made in the WebEx hearing?  

If the LEP participant establishes a connection to the WebEx hearing using a computer or other device that is 
separate from their telephone connection to the interpreter, they can hear the English spoken in the WebEx 
hearing. However, they likely will have to mute the line into the WebEx hearing to avoid audio interference (e.g. 
feedback). They can adjust the volume on either the non-English line (to the interpreter) or the English line (to 
the WebEx hearing) to reduce the overlapping interference of the two languages. 

20. If the LEP participant can’t hear the English speaker’s voices, how will they know who is saying what? 

They interpreter must identify whose English statement they are interpreting (e.g. “The judge said . . .”). This 
does not mean the interpreter is adding information to their interpretation. It is a way to format the 
interpretation to accurately transmit an aspect of the English statement that would otherwise not be received 
by the LEP participant. 

21. Can the interpreter use a landline to call LEP?  

Yes, if the landline can establish a 3-way call. We also recommend that the interpreter use headphones with 
microphone connected to the landline.   

22. Can we use an online service (e.g. Google Voice) or other device or internet service to establish the non-English 

line?  

We have not evaluated these options. 

23. Is a wired connection for both phone and pc/tablet required?  

A wired connection is strongly recommended because wireless connections (e.g. Bluetooth) can be unreliable. If 
you choose to use a wireless connection, please have a back-up connection readily available (e.g. a USB headset 
within reach). 

24. Does WebEx work with a Safari browser? 

It may work but WebEx does not fully support it. Chrome and Firefox browsers are recommended.  

25. What internet speed is needed for good quality interpretation. 

An internet connection speed of 50 to 100 is recommended but not required. 

26. Can you connect to a WebEx hearing through a Virtual Private Network (VPN) over a public network?  

A VPN would improve security over a public network, but the interpreter must also provide a private and quiet 
environment for confidentiality and good audio quality.  

27. Does this system serve in-custody defendants?  

The court is responsible to ensure that a defendant’s access and due process rights are preserved. One reason 
OJD decided to use Webex instead of some other platforms is because of its compatibility with existing

equipment used in many courtrooms and facilities. None the less, the court, the law enforcement/corrections 
agency, CLAS and the interpreter may have to coordinate special arrangements for the interpretation of the 
hearing. 

28. When the interpreter’s phone is connected to both the LEP participant and their attorney for a confidential 

conversation, can the conversation be interpreted simultaneously?  

No, both the English and non-English language travel in the same communication channel, in this case the single 
telephone connection, so the interpretation must be done in the consecutive mode. 

29. What does the interpreter do if the LEP participant asks a question or says something while the Judge or attorney 

is speaking?  

Per the interpreter’s duty under the CPR, the interpreter would unmute their connection to the WebEx hearing 
(i.e. the English line) and interpret the LEP participant’s question or statement into English. 

30. What if there is poor sound quality on the phone connection to the LEP Participant? 

Per the interpreter’s duty under the CPR, the interpreter would unmute their connection to the WebEx hearing 
(i.e. the English line) and report the impediment to the court.  

31. How does the interpreter ask the Judge to instruct the LEP person to speak in short sentences or repeat 

something? 

Per the interpreter’s duty under the CPR, the interpreter would unmute their connection to the WebEx hearing 
(i.e. the English line) and ask the court to instruct the LEP participant accordingly or ask for permission to 
address the LEP participant directly.  

32. Does relying on the interpreter’s smart phone connection encourage the LEP participant’s personal dependence 
on the interpreter which is prohibited by Canon 3 of the CPR, “IMPARTIALITY AND AVOIDANCE OF CONFLICT OF 
INTEREST? 

The LEP participant (and all other WebEx hearing participants) depend upon the interpretation that travels 
through the phone line not on the interpreter as an individual. A dropped cell phone connection presents an 
impediment to the interpretation and thus must be reported by the interpreter to the court per Canon 9 
ASSESSING AND REPORTING IMPEDIMENTS TO PERFORMANCE. 

33. Does using the interpreter’s own smart phone service plan and equipment to perform this service, make the 
interpreter responsible for monitoring the connectivity and quality of the Non-English Line? The commentary 
under Canon 8 SCOPE OF PRACTICE states, “The interpreter . . . shall not . . . engage in any other activities that 
may be construed to constitute a service other than interpreting or translating.”  

As long as the interpreter confines their communication to interpreting and interpreting issues, Canon 8 does 
not apply to this circumstance. A dropped cell phone connection or poor sound quality present impediments to 
the interpretation and thus must be reported to the court per Canon 9 ASSESSING AND REPORTING PEDIMENTS 
TO PERFORMANCE. It is the interpreter’s duty to report the impediment not to resolve the impediment.
