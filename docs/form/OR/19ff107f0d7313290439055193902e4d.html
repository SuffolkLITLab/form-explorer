STATE FAMILY LAW  
ADVISORY COMMITTEE 

1)  The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may appoint a statewide family law advisory 
committee to assist the State Court Administrator in carrying out the administrator's 
responsibilities under ORS 3.438 (2) and (4)(a) and in identifying family law issues 
that need to be addressed in the future. The Chief Justice shall consider the diversity 
of this state in appointing the members of the statewide advisory committee. 

he purview of SFLAC is within the discretion of the Chief Justice, who appoints 
members to staggered 3-year terms, renewable indefinitely, in her or his discretion. 
There are usually approximately 18 members representing diverse vantage points on 
family law and the Oregon Judicial Department. Members represent a diversity of 
professions (judiciary, law practice, court administration, child support, mediation, 
mental health, and others).  There is conscious diversity of geography, gender and 
ethnicity.  To date, the Chair has been a judicial officer.  There is no judicial majority by 
design and recommendation of the group itself.   

ll meetings are subject to Oregon’s public meeting laws.  SFLAC publishes its agendas 

in advance, maintains a public website, assures in-person access to all venues, and 
provides opportunity for public comment.  SFLAC members and guests may call in to 
meetings, and video access is provided for SFLAC members.  Members may request 
reimbursement for travel expenses if funds are available, but members receive no 
compensation for service.   

ervice on SFLAC requires a substantial personal time commitment.  Meetings are 

quarterly, usually on Fridays, and last up to four hours.  Typically, the March, June, and 
December meetings are in Portland, and the September meeting may be in another part 
of the state. Members are active in the group and generally serve on one or more 
subcommittees.  Service on the assorted subcommittees require interim meetings and 
preparation for the quarterly SFLAC meetings.  Subcommittees and work groups are 
formed and reformed as needed.  It is not necessary to be an SFLAC member to serve on 
a subcommittee; in fact, many SFLAC members come from prior service on a 
subcommittee. 

he members have an excellent attendance rate at the meetings, which is critical 

because each member has been specifically chosen to participate in the group based on 
their unique knowledge and skills set. The meetings are comprehensive and allow for an 
exchange of information and sharing of goals for family law in the State of Oregon.  
There is equality of individual respect not arbitrarily hindered by hierarchy, titles,

The founding statute, ORS 3.436, includes this language:

length of service, or deference to rank.  There is an atmosphere of businesslike 
informality, humor and collegiality. There is often outspoken (but respectful) frankness 
in pursuit of consensus, which is almost always reached, but is not required.  This 
refreshing dynamic allows the group to tackle tough issues with fervor and continue to 
strive to have Oregon be a leader in prioritizing service to families involved with the 
litigation process.     

t least annually, the Chief Justice and the State Court Administrator meet with SFLAC 

to discuss issues and policies under the purview of the committee.  SFLAC remains 
advisory to the Chief.  Additionally, each member serves as liaison to one or more local 
Family Law Advisory Committees (FLAC) and reports on the activities of the local 
FLACs. 1 

SUBCOMMITTEE SUMMARIES 
 
There are several subcommittees of the SFLAC where the bulk of the work of the SFLAC 
is done.  These subcommittees will constitute, expand, decrease, and go dormant from 
time to time depending on the needs of the group.  After careful consideration regarding 
priorities moving forward, in 2016 the SFLAC agreed to absorb the mission of the Self-
Represented Subcommittee into the work of each and every subcommittee. It was also 
decided that there would no longer be a specific subcommittee on Legislative Work, but 
rather an ad hoc subcommittee that can be called upon in the future if need be.  Ryan 
Carty, who handles Legislative Liaison work for the Oregon State Bar Family Law 
Section, keeps the SFLAC updated on legislative issues and helps coordinate SFLAC 
involvement if needed.  The Child Support Subcommittee has been dormant since 2016 
as the DOJ was in the midst of a major overhaul of the child support system, but it is 
anticipated that group will reconvene in the coming year.  The currently active 
subcommittees are listed below with a summary statement regarding recent 
achievements.

issues in their county, though some counties remain dormant.

HAPTER 125 SUBCOMMITTEE – Report Fall 2019 

hairs:  Hon. Lauren Holland (Lane County Circuit Court), Hon. Rita Cobb (Sr. Judge, 

Portland) 

embers:  Hon. Sean Armstrong (Marion County Circuit Court), Hon. Claudia Burton 
(Marion County Circuit Court), Hon. Katherine Tennyson (Sr. Judge, Portland), Parmie 
VanDyke (Probate Commissioner, Washington County), Stephen Adams (Mediator, 
Wallowa County), Bryan Marsh (JFCPD, OJD) 

hat is the goal/focus of the subcommittee?  

The subcommittee is focused on all aspects of protective proceedings; this includes both 
emergency temporary placements, as well as indefinite guardianships and 
conservatorships.  Our goals include statewide education and standardization of best 
practices regarding protective proceedings.  

hat are the subcommittee’s top short-term priorities?  

The subcommittee created a training video for court appointed visitors which can be 
utilized by courts statewide.  Creation of a handbook for visitors to supplement the video 
is now in progress; the first draft should be circulated to subcommittee members by the 
end of November.  Uniform auditing of conservatorship and annual accounting is 
another priority.  The committee is investigating options that would be affordable and at 
the same time could be applied to cases statewide.  

hat are the subcommittee’s top long-term priorities?  

The ongoing priority is the education of all those involved in protective proceedings in 
order to insure compliance with the legislative mandates.  Also, assisting courts in 
determining and implementing the best practices in establishing, monitoring, and 
administering protective proceedings.  

hat are the subcommittee’s top accomplishments?  

Creation of a statewide training video and handbook for court visitors.  Providing 
information to legislative proposals in protective proceedings.  

hat are the challenges for courts in implementing the recommendations 

from the subcommittee?  
Funding is the single largest challenge facing courts in implementing recommendations. 
In addition, some courts that have a smaller number of protective proceedings do not 
have the staff or the time to implement effective oversight and administrative processes.

DATA SUBCOMMITTEE – Fall Report 2019 

hair:  Ryan Carty (Attorney, Salem), Linda Hukari (Trial Court Administrator, Marion 

County) 

embers:  Hon. Maureen McKnight (Sr. Judge, Multnomah County), Hon. Matthew 
Donohue (Benton County Circuit Court), Hon. Lauren Holland (Lane County Circuit 
Court), Conor Wall (BFSD, OJD), Jessica Roeser (BFSD, OJD), Leola McKenzie 
(JFCPD, OJD), John Grant (Attorney, Portland (when available)) 

hat is the goal/focus of the subcommittee?    

Prioritizing the data reports that can be obtained and developed from the Odyssey case 
management to provide information to OJD, our community partners, and the 
legislature to further the mission and goals of the OJD in the particular context of family 
law matters.  

hat are the subcommittee’s top short-term priorities?  

Prioritizing the data reports we are most interested in.  Some of the reports will take 
longer to develop the data we believe will be useful in the long term.  In the meantime, 
our immediate priority list has allowed Conor Wall to pull data on mediation, protected 
person cases, and get that information to the trial courts.  This allows the courts to 
identify where there are data entry errors, so the courts can correct the data going into 
the Odyssey system so that we can obtain better data in the future. 

hat are the subcommittee’s top long-term priorities?  

We have a long list of data that we feel is important for the OJD and legislature going 
forward.  For example, getting accurate data on post judgment family law cases. This is 
an enormous workload for the staff and judges, however there is not currently a way to 
accurately pull that data from Odyssey.  Our long-term goal is to develop reports and 
queries that will allow us to pull that data and have meaningful discussions about 
meeting the needs of family law litigants.     

hat are the subcommittee’s top accomplishments? 

While the committee is fairly new, our immediate priority list has improved OJD’s 
ability to pull data on mediation and protected person cases.  This has allowed OJD to 
get that information to the trial courts so they can identify where there are data entry 
errors and then correct those errors.  This improves the quality and reliability of the 
information we get. Conor Wall and Ryan Carty have also presented to the TCAs what 
the committee is doing, why the data is important, and explained data reports 
explaining data entry concerns. Getting the buy-in from the TCAs will assist with 
making sure the data is accurate.

What are the challenges for courts in implementing the recommendations 
from the subcommittee? 
The biggest challenge is training, consistency, and time.  To have accurate data, court 
staff need to be trained and the trial courts need to be consistent in how data entry is 
performed.  If there is an issue with the data, it needs to be identified in a manner that 
will allow the time to review and correct.

Hon. Dawn McIntosh (Clatsop County Circuit Court), LeeAnn O’Neill (Family Court 
Facilitator, Deschutes County)  and Hon. Maureen McKnight (Sr. Judge, Multnomah 
County).  

hat is the goal/focus of the subcommittee?  

Advising the Chief Justice regarding issues, legislation, and resources regarding 
domestic violence, and provide a resource for the same. 
   
What are the subcommittee’s top short-term priorities? 
Creating a Stalking Bench Book similar to the existing FAPA and EPPDAPA Bench 
Books.  We are creating this document from scratch, so it has been our primary focus in 
2019. 
   
What are the subcommittee’s top long-term priorities? 
• 

Proposing updates and changes to court forms, materials and resources regarding 
domestic violence (including developing updates to the FAPA Bench Book). 
Supporting education of the bench and bar related to domestic violence, sexual 
assault, and stalking.   
Proposing and providing speakers for the SFLAC Conference on domestic 
violence, working with trauma survivors, and firearms. 
Many years ago, the firearms taskforce grew out of the DV Subcommittee.  If 
possible, the DV Subcommittee supports the creation of a new firearms taskforce 
to help with the implementation of recent firearms protections as they relate to 
domestic violence.

What are the subcommittee’s top accomplishments? 
The DV Subcommittee drafted a memo to the Law & Policy Workgroup (LPWG), which 
was approved by the SFLAC to forward to LPWG.  The memo proposed important 
changes to FAPA forms, Stalking forms, EPPDAPA instructions and MCDV forms.  
Some of the proposed changes were easily made, while others prompted important 
conversations and the formation of additional work groups.   

ver the years, the DV Subcommittee has been involved in the update of many 

important forms and resources, including OJD’s Firearms Guide for Oregon Courts, 
Firearms Bench Sheets, and multiple OJD forms such as Sexual Abuse Protection Order 
(SAPO) and Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) forms.   

hat are the challenges for courts in implementing the recommendations 

from the subcommittee? 
The committee is motivated to support the implementation of the new firearm 
dispossession protocols per HB 2013.  However, such implementation will require 
training and support of multidisciplinary groups in each county.  This work will require 
financial support as well as significant time investment by the participants.

What are the subcommittee’s top short-term priorities? 
Updating and revising the “Divorce, Custody & Other Family Law Trials in Oregon: How 
to Prepare and What to Expect at Trial” (formerly: “How to Prepare for Your Divorce, 
Legal Separation, Custody or Support Trial” which was last updated in 2001).  The new 
version will include information about IDRT and specific information about what 
should be provided at trial or modifications of custody, child support, parenting time, 
spousal support, and property issues.  It will also be translated into Spanish by CLAS 
once the English version is finalized. 

hat are the subcommittee’s top long-term priorities? 

Each year the subcommittee creates a conference planning committee to plan and 
oversee a Family Law Conference and a Family Court Facilitator Conference (in 
alternating years).  These are comprehensive and valuable trainings about which 
attendees have reported gaining useful and practical information. We also hope to 
continue creating and updating resources for self-represented litigants accessing the 
family court system and improving educational resources and training manuals for staff. 

hat are the subcommittee’s top accomplishments? 

Though this subcommittee is relatively new, it has planned and carried out two 
successful Family Law Conferences and one Family Court Facilitator Conference.  The 
evaluations of each of these Conferences were overall excellent overall, and brought 
important training and materials to many attorneys, judges, facilitators, TCAs, clerks 
and others throughout the state at a relatively low cost.    

hat are the challenges for courts in implementing the recommendations 

from the subcommittee? 
There are plans and ideas for future trainings and webinars, but implementing such 
training will require financial support as well as significant time investment by the 
participants.  We have also found a degree of disconnect from the technology side of 
OSCA.

hat are the subcommittee’s top long-term priorities? 

Continuing to promote access to justice reforms and assisting in creating systems for 
family law dispute resolution that are less adversarial and more accessible to those of 
modest means and self-represented litigants. 

hat are the subcommittee’s top accomplishments? 

The institution of Informal Domestic Relations Trial on a statewide level after 
piloting the project. 
Collaborations with the Institute for the Advancement of the American Legal 
System to promote reform in legal education which promote simpler, fairer, and 
more efficient processes and access to justice for self-represented (this includes      
Multnomah County’s participation in the IAALS self-representation study). 

  
What are the challenges for courts in implementing the recommendations 
from the subcommittee? 
The primary challenge is financial.  There is no dispute that the adversarial system 
serves most family law litigants well (even if it may be too expensive for even most 
middle-class families to navigate).  The adversarial system is also necessary to manage 
the minority of cases involving significant intimate partner violence or where one or 
both parties are not rational actors because of addiction or mental health issues.  
However, for most families, a system that emphasizes less adversarial and more 
therapeutic processes better serves the interests of families and children and the society 
as a whole.

OJD) (and occasional other participants). 

ccomplishments:  

Assisted OJD in two separate data collection projects aimed at establishing a 
baseline of mediation services available statewide. 
Commissioned two white papers on the state of mediation in Oregon and 
mediation best practices. 
Supported OJD in crafting two policy option packages to increase mediation 
funding (both were included in the Chief’s budget, but not funded by the 
legislature). 
Designed new Mediation Data Collection Project, a process for reporting and 
tracking the outcome of court-connected domestic relations mediation; drafted 
instruction letter on completing the mediator reports for mediators and court 
staff; drafted a review letter after a year of data collection highlighted needed 
clarifications and improvements. 
Continued outreach to court-connected mediators and programs throughout the 
state. 
Continued discussion of best practices in mediation. 

rojects:  

We are working on an instructional video to be available on the web regarding 
completion of the mediator reports.  As data reporting continues to improve, we will 
report the results and interpret the data to develop statewide recommended best 
practices and support sufficient funding for these services.

hat are the subcommittee’s top long-term priorities? 

After work on our current project, we hope to provide guidelines, information and 
training for family law professionals about the resist/refuse dynamic that presents in 
high-conflict divorce families. 

hat are the subcommittee’s top accomplishments? 

The Parenting Involvement Workgroup (later renamed the Parenting Involvement and 
Outreach Subcommittee or PIOS) was formed in 2010 to investigate local and national 
trends regarding best interest standards and practices for children of divorce, paying 
particular attention to the distinction between parenting schedules (referred to 
throughout as parenting time) and custody, referring to legal decision-making authority 
as defined by ORS 107.169.  Since that time, the subcommittee has completed several 
major projects as well as a wealth of more minor materials.  

n incomplete list of work is detailed below:

Evaluators, and Parenting Time Supervisors

2015-2017 – Birth Through Three Toolkit and associated presentations, materials and 
trainings around the state.

Three.aspx 

hat are the challenges for courts in implementing the recommendations 

from the subcommittee? 
Our subcommittee often makes recommendations that do not lend themselves to the 
environment of the courtroom.  We tend to advocate for complex, child focused analysis 
that is sometimes beyond the scope of a hearing or evaluation.  At times, our 
recommendations do not conform easily to standard forms of parenting plans, especially 
in the areas of Birth through Three.  For example, we might advocate for more flexible 
and dynamic parenting time schedules, adjusted with the help of professionals or the 
courts, in ways that are difficult for courts to accommodate.

FUTURE WORK OF THE SFLAC 
 

At our quarterly meetings the SFLAC continues to diligently vet the work that is being 
done by the subcommittees, with a hope to continue to provide the statutory advisory 
opinion to the Oregon Judicial Department and to significantly and positively shape 
family law policy for the State of Oregon, to benefit all those families who interact with 
the Court system.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
