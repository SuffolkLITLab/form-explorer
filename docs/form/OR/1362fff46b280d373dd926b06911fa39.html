riority Area #1: Quality Court Hearings 

Outcome #1:  Improved quality of dependency hearings 

Need Driving Activities & Data Source: How do you know this is a need in your state?    In 2015, the National Center for State Courts, as part of a workload study of Oregon’s 
courts, conducted hearing observations aimed at measuring the quality of Oregon’s dependency hearings.  The observations revealed that many topics regarding the child’s 
well-being and the parents’ progress are frequently not discussed during court hearings, suggesting that there is considerable room for improvement in the depth and breadth 
of discussion at Oregon’s dependency hearings.  Other JCIP court observation projects have shown that children are rarely present in court, which means that increasing the 
frequency with which youth attend might also improve the quality of hearings.  JCIP has also received feedback from judges and stakeholders that, in some jurisdictions, agency 
caseworkers often appear in court without legal representation, and that this can reduce the quality of a hearing and also cause delays if the hearing needs to be continued so 
that counsel can be present. 

Theory of Change: Increases in the frequency with which children, parents, children’s attorneys, parents’ attorneys, State/Agency attorneys, tribes, and tribes’ attorneys attend 
dependency hearings will improve the quality of those hearings.

Work on this project has not begun due to JCIP focusing its data analyst’s work in the first half of 2017 on participating in DHS’s ongoing Child and Family Services 
Reviews (CFSR) and Program Improvement Planning, the development of the joint agency – CIP permanency project, and the Reimagining Dependency Courts project.  
Work on monitoring and increasing party and attorney presence at hearings will begin later in 2017. 

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018):  

Work on this project has still not begun because in Year 2 because the JCIP data analyst’s CIP-funded work focused primarily on the following projects:  

• 
• 
• 
• 

the Reimagining Dependency Courts Project (see Outcome 2, Project 5) 
the data transfer from OJD’s Odyssey case management system to the DHS OR-Kids case management system (see Outcome 2, Project 6) 
the joint – agency CIP permanency project (see Outcome 2, Project 1) 
ongoing work to disseminate JCIP’s quarterly statistical reports, train courts on proper data entry procedures, and improve data quality (see Outcome 2, 
Project 2). 

JCIP is in the process of hiring an additional full-time data analyst, and once that person has begun work, they will begin work on Project 1. 

This project has been delayed due to the hiring and training of a new JCIP data analyst.  However, JCIP is in the beginning stages of developing a report that examines 
attendance and representation at hearings.  More specifically, this report will identify the percentage of hearings with various parties and attorneys present.  The 
development phase of this report is scheduled for completion 12/2019.  The implementation phase of this report is scheduled to begin 01/2020. 

Year 3 (July 2018 through June 2019): 

Year 4 (July 2019 through June 2020) 

JCIP has begun working on developing a new report that compares the number of attorneys assigned to a case with the number of attorneys that were present at each 
held hearing.  This report has been in the early stages of testing since March of 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic required much of JCIP’s resources to be allocated 
towards implementing new policies and procedures that impacted the state.  However, the new completion date for the report is 9/2020 with an implementation phase 
set to begin in 10/2020. 

Project 2 – Implement a program to provide judges with training and coaching from experienced master judges on how to better engage parents in dependency 
hearings 

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017):  

This project is planned for the later years of this CIP funding cycle, and work will begin in 2019. 

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018):  

This project is planned for the later years of this CIP funding cycle, and work will begin in 2020.

Year 3 (July 2018 through June 2019) 

This project is scheduled to begin 03/2020. 

Year 4 (July 2019 through June 2020) 

This project is being deleted.  Progress towards this goal has been halted due to the Covid-19 pandemic, as in person coaching and observation cannot 
safely occur. JCIP has been working with Oregon’s juvenile court judges to develop protocols and processes to conduct juvenile hearings virtually 
through WebEx. JCIP has provided training to the juvenile bench on remote hearings and will continue to refine and provide training, including during 
our (virtual) “Through the Eyes of a Child” juvenile judge training in August 2020. Most juvenile court judges are now conducting remote hearings, with 
parties appearing by video conference. The Eyes Conference will include a session on remote hearings, and judges will have an opportunity to learn from 
each other how to best maximize remote hearings to engage all participants in the process.  

Project 3 – Coordinate the development, maintenance, and updating of legally sufficient model forms for juvenile dependency judgments  

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017):  

JCIP finished collecting data from its 2016 survey of courts regarding their model court form usage and presented the information to the JELI Model Forms Group and 
discussed further improvements that can be made to the model court forms and to form usage.  JCIP and JELI Model Forms Group also discussed changes to improve 
orders regarding visitation during the shelter hearing and changes to orders that may be needed to implement the Every Student Succeeds Act. 

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018):  

JCIP made several improvements to its juvenile dependency forms over this period.  As part of a project with the DHS, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Office of 
Public Defense Services (OPDS) to provide children with early and frequent visitation, OJD updated its shelter order to prompt the court to consider whether a visit 
should be ordered within 48 hours or within a week of the child’s removal from the home.  The dependency judgments were also revised to allow courts to make 
findings regarding the appropriateness of a child’s attendance in his or her “school of origin” under the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015.   

JCIP also worked on improvements to its permanency judgment.  JCIP has received consistent feedback that the permanency judgment is too complicated.  During the 
fall of 2017, JCIP simplified some of the findings required for adoption.  Currently, it is working with the OJD Forms Manager, Holly Rudolph, to explore new 
technologies for filling out the permanency judgment.  Holly will be meeting with the JELI Model Forms Group in June 2018 to demonstrate how the permanency 
judgment could be completed with OJD Guide and File.  The goal is to come up with a more user-friendly solution by the end of 2018.  

JCIP is also working with DHS and stakeholders on revisions to the uniform court report to improve readability and ease of completion by caseworkers.  The goal is to 
create a document that is easier for parents to understand and that complies with both case planning and court reporting requirements, so separate documents aren’t 
needed.  This work began in March 2018 and is expected to continue for several months.   

Year 3 (July 2018 through June 2019)

JCIP staff continued to work with DHS on a new version of the Uniform Court Report that incorporates the legal requirements of a case plan.  The purpose of the project 
was to: (1) improve the formatting of the court report and (2) streamline paperwork for caseworkers by allowing a caseworker to use one document for the case plan 
and the court report.  JCIP staff participated in workgroup discussions through 2018.  The final version of the report was launched in February 2019 in three pilot 
counties.  JCIP continues to work with DHS on modifications based on feedback we receive until a revised version can be rolled out statewide. 

JCIP staff also worked internally with judges and staff to create a new more user-friendly format for the permanency judgment.  The permanency judgment is the most 
complex and difficult form to use.  Using new technology through “Guide and File” the user will be able to answer a series of questions.  The program will then produce 
a version of the form that only includes relevant sections to the case.  This will be easier for all users to navigate and for parents to understand.  We anticipate 
demonstrating the new program at the Through the Eyes of a Child Conference in August 2019 and then rolling it out statewide. 

JCIP staff continued to develop and improve dependency forms for juvenile court judges in cooperation with a small group of judges who meet quarterly to review and 
discuss changes:  The new forms that were developed include: 

This form was developed for use when a child is placed in foster care by DHS voluntarily through an agreement with the parent.  Previously, no model form was 
available.  Since these reviews are infrequent, judges have been unsure of which findings to make.  The new form makes it easier for judges to know which findings 
apply to these cases. 
 

(2)  Notice regarding expunction in juvenile dependency 

A new notice of the right of the child to apply for expunction at the conclusion of a dependency case was developed to provide to children and parents. 
 

(3)  Protective Custody Order 

(4)  Continuance Order 

A new order was developed in response to changes in Oregon law which restrict the ability of a caseworker to remove a child without court approval.  The changes 
bring Oregon statute into compliance with federal constitutional limits on state interference with the parent, child relationship. 
 

A new order was developed for courts to use when they allow a continuation of a jurisdictional hearing beyond the 60-day timeline for holding a hearing.   
 

(5)   Order regarding review of child’s placement in a Qualified Residential Treatment Program 

A new order was developed for judges to use to approve or disapprove of a child’s placement in a Qualified Residential Treatment program pursuant to SB 171 
(2019), Oregon’s implementation of the federal Family First Prevention Services Act.  The new order also provides for related state and federal required findings. 
 

(6)    DHS Court Report (Family Report) 

JCIP staff continued to work collaboratively on improvements to the new DHS Court Report/ Family Report form.  The form was piloted in 3 judicial districts 
beginning in early 2019.  Based on feedback from DHS staff, CRB staff and judges, the form has been revised and will be rolled out statewide during the summer of 
2020.  We anticipate the new format will make it easier for caseworkers to comply with timelines for completing court reports and case plans and will provide 
information to the court in a more streamlined format.

Year 4 (July 2019 through June 2020)

In addition to the new forms and notice described above, JCIP helped with the roll out a new form of the permanency judgment that allows the court to fill in a series of 
interview questions through Guide and File.  At the end of the interview, a filled-out version of the permanency judgment is created that only contains the portions of 
the form that are applicable to the particular case.   The end result is a form that is easier for parents and children to read.  Finally, JCIP had Spanish translations 
completed of: (1) a required notice to parents about their financial obligations to support and pay other expenses during the dependency case, and of their right to 
appeal, (2) the letter that is provided to the guardian when he or she is appointed, and (3) the annual report the guardian is required to fill out. 

Need Driving Activities & Data Source: How do you know this is a need in your state?    Lack of timely permanency has been identified as an area needing improvement in the 
Department of Human Services’ (DHS) CFSR self-assessment, as well as the Round 3 CFSR file reviews.  It has also been identified as an area needing improvement by the JCIP 
Advisory Committee.  Finally, data analysis conducted by the National Center for State Courts (NCSC) shows that Oregon has a higher percentage of children in care longer than 
two years than the national average.  With the help of the NCSC’s Reimagining Dependency Courts project, Oregon is currently conducting file reviews to isolate practices that 
need to be improved to decrease the time to permanency. 

Theory of Change: Through joint review of data and targeted measures to address barriers to permanency, compliance with the hearing timeliness measures, and early contact 
with a parent, the percentage of foster children achieving permanency within two years will increase.

Prior to the start of FFY2017, JCIP and DHS met and decided that the joint project should focus on a permanency issue identified in the DHS’s CFSR Program 
Improvement Plan (PIP) process.  Starting in early 2017 JCIP participated actively on the Permanency Committee that DHS convened to work on the permanency portion 
of its PIP, and the committee’s analysis of both DHS and JCIP data focused the joint project on increasing the percentage of children who become legally free who have 
adoptions finalized within twelve months. 

fter the committee completed its work, JCIP worked with DHS Central Office staff to create a joint plan for achieving the goal of having 59.5% of children who become 

legally free have a finalized adoption within 12 months.  The strategic plan above has been updated to include the details of this plan, which include the submission of 
the Adoption Tracking Page from DHS’s OR-Kids system to courts and CRBs; training for courts, CRBs, and stakeholders on understanding the Adoption Tracking Page 
and general adoption finalization process; and support for multi-disciplinary Model Court Teams in counties that do not meet the current goal in creating county-
specific plans to increase the percentage children who become legally free who have an adoption finalized within twelve months.  

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018): 

As part of the joint plan to improve the timeliness of adoptions, in fall 2017 DHS caseworkers began submitting screenshots of the OR-Kids Adoption Tracking Page to 
courts and CRBs ahead of hearings and CRB reviews on cases with a permanency plan of adoption.  JCIP and DHS collaborated on a session at the 2017 Model Court 
Summit to train judges, CRB members, and stakeholders on the information in the Adoption Tracking Page.  Judges and Citizen Review Board members, however, did 
not find the screenshots of the Adoption Tracking Page to be useful for overseeing progress toward finalizing adoptions because the various screens and drop-down 
menus on the Adoption Tracking Page often required several screenshots, and because the screen shots themselves were often difficult to understand or illegible.  DHS 
is now working on a report that can be pulled from OR-KIDS that is simpler to read than the tracking pages 

hree Model Court Teams, however, did develop plans at the 2017 Model Court Summit to increase the percentage of children adopted within less than 12 months of 
becoming legally free.  Strategies included having dedicated CW staff focusing on finalizing adoptions; CRBs and courts utilizing the adoption checklists; and CRB 
providing more detail in reports to let the judge know which steps still needed to be completed for an adoption.  Each of the three courts (Coos, Deschutes and 
Washington) showed improvement in the latter part of 2017 in the percentage of children who became legally free who were adopted within a year, but overall state 
percentage dropped from 45% for children who became legally free in 2015 (and were therefore due to be adopted in 2016) to 41% for children freed for adoption in 
2016. 

ear 3 (July 2018 through June 2019) 

CIP worked collaboratively with DHS to develop an Adoption Tracking Report that pulls data directly from OR-KIDS.  This report is much easier to read than previous 
screen shots.  JCIP and DHS provided training on the Tracking Report at the CRB Every Day Counts Conference on May 17, 2019.  Materials for a webinar have been 
developed and will be delivered as soon as DHS reviews it for accuracy.  Time to adoption and Post TPR Process is also on the agenda for the Model Court Summit on 
Child Abuse and Neglect, August 13, 2019.  At the Summit, participants will be encouraged to go on-line and fill out a survey on the usefulness of the Tracking Report 
and barriers they have experienced in the adoption process. The JCIP State Advisory Committee can then review the results of the survey at their September meeting 
and identify future training needs and systemic barriers commonly identified.  The overall state average for timeliness to adoption is up 2% to 43% which is short of the 
goal of 59.5%.  Eight counties were meeting the adoption finalization target when we first shared the data at the 2017 Model Court Summit and 10 counties are 
currently meeting or exceeding the target.

Project 1 – Work with DHS on a joint data project to increase the percentage of children who have their adoption finalized within 12 months of becoming legally free 
 

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017):  

 

 

25 

Coos County, who developed their plan at the August 2017 Model Court Summit, has increased their percentage of finalized adoptions within 12 months of being legally 
free from 37% to 83%.  They shared how they did that at the Every Day Counts Conference and will again at the Model Court Summit in August.   Seven additional 
counties developed local plans for finalizing adoptions within a year of a child being legally free during our process to Improve the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the 
Juvenile Dependency System. These counties are Baker, Benton, Douglas, Klamath, Lake, Lane, Lincoln and Polk.   Because these counties have only recently developed 
their plans in the later half of 2018, it is still too early to determine the results.  JCIP shares adoption data for each county quarterly. 

CIP staff is participating in a “Barriers to Adoption” workgroup lead by Multnomah County Judge McKnight.  That group has been working to draft a UTCR regarding the 
Process for Petitionless Adoptions, gain access to Odyssey for those counties lacking access, determine where and how to file necessary documents, create a vendor 
attorney guide, and make a processing guide for Judicial Staff. 

e have realized that training needs to be ongoing, as the adoption process is very complicated with many steps.  It is particularly difficult for smaller counties who may 

have few or no adoption cases on a regular basis.   

ear 4 (July 2019 through June 2020) 

CIP collaborated with DHS to update the adoption flow chart and the adoption tracking report. A webinar was developed and finalized and presented to judges and 
CRB Field Managers in June 2020. The webinar will be posted on the JCIP website and made available to community partners. A draft of the webinar and the adoption 
flow chart and tracking report were presented by the agency a workshop at the Adoption Call to Action in January 2020.  Other states contacted Oregon for permission 
to use the materials.  JCIP staff did an adoption podcast on the Change Management Process. 

he statewide percentage of children adopted within 12 months of becoming legally freed was 53% in the first quarter of 2020 which is the highest it has ever been.   

Project 2 – Provide courts and stakeholders with data on the timeliness of key juvenile dependency filings, judgments, and hearings   

ear 1 (December 2016 through June 2017):  

JCIP has continued in FFY2017 to run and disseminate its juvenile statistical reports to judges and stakeholders on a quarterly basis.  JCIP has also provided training to 
statewide court staff at the OJD’s Clerk College, and has worked with CECM on documentation of business process and Odyssey updates.  The other activities under 
Project 2 are new activities that will be funded by the FY2017 data grant and have not yet begun.  

  

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018): 

JCIP continued to disseminate its quarterly statistical reports to judges and stakeholders on a quarterly and annual basis in Year 2, and continued to work with courts to 
improve data quality, particularly around time to jurisdiction on both parents and the timeliness of termination of parental rights petitions and judgments.  JCIP also 
updated its reports at the end of the 2017 to use entered dates, rather than filed dates, for events filed after January 1, 2017, and to include specialty court hearings 
and miscellaneous court hearings on its juvenile event statistics reports.  JCIP also met with judges and courts staff in one of Oregon’s largest juvenile courts (Lane 
County) to discuss its statistical reports and the data entry needed to produce high-quality data.  In June 2018, JCIP will be conducting a webinar on juvenile data entry 
for court staff across the state.

JCIP has continued to produce and disseminate quarterly and yearly statistical reports to judges and stakeholders.  In February of 2019, JCIP began to develop an 
interactive dashboard which displays all of its current reports in a central location and that court staff, judges, and other stakeholders can readily access for statistical 
information.  The dashboard is expected to be available in Year 4. OJD has also begun the process of transferring its reports over to a data warehouse.  This should offer 
an additional layer of security for juvenile data, provide faster turnaround time for data requests, and provide greater consistency in data reports. 

75% with a jurisdictional or dismissal judgment(s) entered regarding all parents on the case within 60 days. 
98% with a jurisdictional or dismissal judgment(s) entered regarding all parents on the case within 90 days. 

n June of 2018, the Court Reengineering and Efficiencies Workgroup (CREW) recommended new OJD Timely Disposition Standards after a review of the Oregon Judicial 
Conference Standards for Timely Disposition.  The recommendations were set as follows: 
Juvenile Dependency-Jurisdictional Petitions 
• 
• 
 Juvenile Dependency- Permanency Hearings 
• 
 Juvenile Dependency- Termination of Parental Rights 
• 

98% within 425 days (14 months) of filing. 

98% within 270 days (9 months) of filing. 

JCIP has adjusted its reports to reflect these standards.  The Time to First Jurisdiction Finding and Time to Jurisdiction on Both Parents reports now feature columns for 
cases that reach jurisdiction within 60 days (with a 75% goal) and 90 days (with a 98% goal).  Additionally, the Time to TPR report now features cases that are resolved 
within 182 days and those resolved within 270 days (with a 98% goal).  Finally, JCIP continues to work closely with courts to improve data quality, particularly around 
the development and refinement of statewide business processes.

CIP has worked to increase the accessibility and number of statistical reports available to judges, court staff, and community stakeholders.  JCIP also has continued to 
disseminate, interpret, and discuss statewide data reports at quarterly Advisory Committee Meetings, which brings together a cross section of stakeholders throughout 
the state.  JCIP completed an interactive dashboard during the FFY 2020, which allows for instant and detailed access to data reports at the court’s leisure as well as a 
public access portal where community members and stakeholders can access a more restricted version of the data reports.  JCIP has implemented OJD Timely 
Disposition Standards across the state, developed and implemented a report that measures the length of time it took a child to achieve permanency, and has begun the 
development of a report that looks at the parties present at various hearings.  While this final report has been delayed in development due to Covid-19 policies, JCIP has 
set a new goal for completion of the report in 9/2020.  Finally, JCIP has worked to upgrade our data entry business processes for both dependency and delinquency in 
an effort to increase the efficiency and accuracy of our data reports. 
 

Project 3 – Support participation by judges and staff in multi-disciplinary task forces and work groups convened to make system improvements in Oregon’s child welfare 
system 

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017):  

The following has been the work accomplished in December 2016 through June 2017 through JCIP’s support of staff and judge involvement on statewide task forces, 
work groups, and committees: 
 

 

27 

Governor’s Foster Care Advisory Committee: JCIP assisted the Chief Justice by identifying several potential OJD candidates for this commission.  A CRB 
volunteer board member was selected by the Governor and approved by the legislature to serve on the commission.  The Commission is planning a first 
meeting in July.  JCIP staff will monitor the meetings and provide technical assistance and information as needed. 

nified Child and Youth Safety Implementation Plan Steering Team: JCIP has been participating in the Unified Child and Youth Safety Implementation Steering 

Team since March of 2017.  Since that time, we have provided input regarding the mission statement, work priorities and measures needed to improve child 
safety.   

Child Welfare Advisory Committee: JCIP staff and a juvenile court judge represent OJD on this advisory committee.  They report regularly on system issues and 
projects of the courts that impact stakeholders.  They provide advice and assistance to the DHS CWP as requested. 

hree Branch Core Team & Expanded Team: JCIP staff and a juvenile court judge meet every other month with 2 legislators and 2 members of the DHS CWP 
leadership.  This group 1) provides information to legislators about the impact of legislation on the child welfare system, 2) identifies strategies and commits 
resources for the three branches to collaborate on state level projects or activities that impact the entire child welfare/juvenile dependency system.  This past 
year this group has provided information on the importance of legal representation for all members of the juvenile dependency system, advocated for the 
implementation of a centralized child abuse reporting system, and advocated for increased education and support for child welfare case workers. 

HS Rules Advisory Committee: JCIP staff worked with this group to develop Oregon Administrative Rules for the implementation of the new  ICWA regulations 

and guidelines. 

HS ICWA Advisory Committee: JCIP staff serving on this Council meets quarterly to advise, consult with, and make recommendations to DHS leadership on 
policy, programs, practice, and data that impact Indian children as defined by the ICWA.  The Council includes members of the nine federally recognized tribes 
of Oregon and considers impact on both children who are members of or eligible for membership in one or more of the nine federally recognized tribes in 
Oregon and those Indian children who are placed in Oregon but are members of or eligible for membership in tribes outside of Oregon and who are involved or 
at risk of involvement in the child welfare system in Oregon.   

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018): 

The following has been the work accomplished in July 2017 through June 2018 through JCIP’s support of staff and judge involvement on statewide task forces, work 
groups, and committees: 

Governor’s Foster Care Advisory Committee: The JCIP has been monitoring and providing technical assistance to the work of the Governor's Foster Care 
Advisory Commission.  In 2016, House Bill 4080 established the Oregon Child Foster Care Advisory Commission (CFCAC) to study the issues within the Oregon 
foster care system and advise the Governor and the Director of DHS on those issues.  JCIP staff attend Commission meetings and provide information on court 
and CRB processes and data.  The Commission has established three subcommittees, and JCIP staff is actively involved in the Judicial Processes Issues 
Committee, which has just started its work and is gathering judges' perspectives on allegations of abuse and neglect of children who are in substitute care.  
JCIP has specifically begun gathering information from judges on the following questions posed by the Committee: 

•  What and when do judges learn about abuse of children in foster care? 
•  What expectations do judges have of DHS, attorneys, CASAs when judges when abuse in care happens?  
•  What authority do judges feel that they have - or need - in reviewing these allegations and making placement decisions?

nified Child and Youth Safety Implementation Plan Steering Team:  JCIP staff and a juvenile court judge serve on this team.  The team is addressing systemic 

problems to ensure that all children in foster care are safe.  As part of this effort, JCIP is working collaboratively with DHS to ensure that systems are put in 
place to give CRBs notice when a child in foster care is found to be the victim of abuse.  The CRB is also providing guidance to volunteers on their 
responsibilities when they receive notice of a report of abuse in foster care. 

hild Welfare Advisory Committee: JCIP staff and two juvenile court judges participate in the CWAC.  This group is a legislatively-mandated 21-member 
Advisory Committee that provides the child welfare program with advice on the development and administration of child welfare policies, programs and 
practices.  The group meets every other month.  Members represent other state agencies, representatives of professional, civic or other private organizations 
and private citizens. 

hree Branch Core Team & Expanded Team: Oregon's official "Three Branch" group focused on DHS's implementation of a statewide hotline and screening 
process.  Those plans are well underway, so the Three Branch group decided to discontinue meetings.  Instead, leaders from the three branches have 
committed to encourage and strongly support three branch efforts where they will be helpful to address system improvements in the foster care system.   

HS Rules Advisory Committee: After working with this group to develop Oregon Administrative Rules for the implementation of the new Bureau of Indian 
Affairs (BIA) ICWA regulations and guidelines, JCIP staff participated in the Train the Trainers for the new rules and, in collaboration with DHS and the Klamath 
Tribes, provided training in Klamath County for CASA and CRB. 

HS ICWA Advisory Committee: In Year 2, JCIP became an official member of the ICWA Advisory Committee, and participated in discussions on: 

implementation of the Every Student Succeeds Act, including the Best Interest Finding that the court must make if a child is going to change schools and the 
educational surrogate requirements;  the ICWA Addendum for the Oregon CFSR; the new Verification of American Indian/Alaskan Native Membership or 
Enrollment form; the Child Welfare Training Redesign; protective action plans involving Indian Children; reasonable vs. active efforts; and the definition of 
imminent physical damage or harm.  JCIP also provided data and updates on the QUICWA Project and participated on the QEW Subcommittee and the 
Customary Adoption Subcommittee. 

rafficking Intervention Advisory Committee:  JCIP staff and a juvenile court judge serve on a statewide trafficking advisory committee convened by the Oregon 
DOJ.  The group provides advice and direction for the statewide commercial and sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) coordinator in her work assisting local 
teams in identifying and responding to trafficking within their counties.  JCIP is working with this group on the development of an Oregon bench card for 
juvenile judges. 

outh with Specialized Needs Work Group: In 2017, JCIP staff worked with staff from the Governor’s Office and Senator Peter Courtney’s Office to convene a 
group to address children with serious behavioral health needs who aren’t being adequately served by current systems.  The Work Group began meeting in 
January of 2018 and will be making recommendations for funding and legislative concepts by June 1, 2018 for consideration during the 2019 legislative session.  
The current focus is to divert children who primarily need mental health services from emergency rooms, juvenile detention, and out-of-state residential 
placements to less restrictive and more appropriate placements.  It is likely the group will continue meeting beyond June in some capacity to conduct long 
term strategic planning.   

ttorney Standards Work Group:  JCIP staff participated in this Work Group’s efforts to establish performance standards for government attorneys practicing 

dependency law.  These standards are new for Oregon lawyers, developed at the recommendation of the Oregon Task Force on Juvenile Dependency

Representation.  The draft standards were distributed to juvenile judges for comment and will be finalized in 2018.   JCIP will provide a session on the new 
standards, along with standards for juvenile defense attorneys that were finalized in June of 2017, at the Through the Eyes of a Child Conference in August 
2018. 

ustomary Adoptions Work Group: One of the nine Oregon Tribes indicated interest in establishing Customary Adoption legislation in Oregon.  A workgroup 
was formed and JCIP staff worked with the Tribes, the DOJ, and DHS to research legislation in other states.  The group provided information to the Tribes to 
help them decide how to proceed. 
 

Year 3 (July 2018 through June 2019):  

he following has been the work accomplished in July 2018 through June 2019 through JCIP’s support of staff and judge involvement on statewide task forces, work 
groups, and committees: 
 
 

Governors Foster Care Advisory Committee: 
JCIP staff monitor the meetings and provide technical assistance and information as needed.  JCIP is collaborating with the Commission to host and facilitate a 
round table discussion/dinner for child welfare stakeholders from four counties (Umatilla, Baker, Klamath, and Coos) when they will be in Salem for the Model 
Court Summit.  This event will give the Commission the opportunity to hear from people who would otherwise need to travel a distance to participate in a 
Commission meeting.   

Unified Child and Youth Safety Implementation Plan Steering Team: 
JCIP staff and a juvenile court judge serve on this team.  The team oversees and provides input on how DHS is addressing systemic problems to ensure that all 
children in foster care are safe.  As part of this effort, JCIP worked collaboratively with DHS to ensure that systems are put in place to give CRBs notice when a 
child in foster care is found to be the victim of abuse.  The steering committee is expected to conclude their work at the June 2019 meeting.  

Child Welfare Advisory Committee: 
JCIP staff and one juvenile court judge participate in the CWAC.  This group is a legislatively-mandated 21-member Advisory Committee that provides the child 
welfare program with advice on the development and administration of child welfare policies, programs and practices.  The group meets every other month.  
Members represent other state agencies, representatives of professional, civic or other private organizations and private citizens.  The CWAC is going through 
some organizational changes as the CW leadership decides how they want to engage the CWAC.

HS ICWA Advisory Committee: JCIP staff meets quarterly with DHS and members of the 9 federally recognized Tribes in Oregon to discuss policy, programs, 
practice, and data that impact ICWA eligible children.  This year’s focus is on reducing disproportionality and the high rate of out-of-home placement for Native 
children in Oregon. The Advisory Council has been consulting with the DHS Office of Reporting, Research, Analytics and Implementation. They have created a 
Native American/Tribal Research Agenda.  Dr. Paul Bellatty and his staff have developed research projects to look at prevention, screening, assessment, 
intervention, placement etc.  They use a methodology of “propensity matching’’ which allows for more immediate results.  The Klamath Tribes are participating 
in a Permanency Barriers Project and findings will be presented at the ICWA Advisory Council. Requests are generated at the ICWA Advisory Council and results 
are reported, along with case themes of the CFSR ICWA reviews. A new position called “Senior ICWA Manager” was created to oversee the Active Efforts 
Specialists and the QEW recruitment and training. JCIP and DHS staff and Tribal members serve on the QEW subcommittee of the ICWA Advisory Council.  We 
presented a training at the National Indian Child Welfare Act Conference on Oregon’s QEW process.  JCIP, the Department of Justice and DHS presented two 
two-day trainings for prospective QEW’s, one to the Siletz Tribe and one to the Klamath Tribes. JCIP presents quarterly data of QEW testimony at shelter and 
jurisdiction hearings, positive active efforts findings, clear and convincing evidence, and whether there is compliance with placement preferences.  DHS

provides JCIP with a list of ICWA cases filed in the previous quarter and JCIP staff reviews the court hearings to determine QEW presence, and if the court made 
the specific findings required by ICWA.  JCIP staff members attended the Tribal/State ICWA Conference, One Heart, One Mind, Strengthening Families. The 
conference was hosted by the Confederated Tribes of Umatilla Indian Reservation and had 260 participants.  JCIP Staff moderated a Tribal and State Judges 
Panel for a general session.     

rafficking Intervention Advisory Committee:  JCIP staff and a juvenile court judge serve on a statewide trafficking advisory committee convened by the Oregon 
DOJ.  The group provides advice and direction for the statewide commercial and sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) coordinator in her work assisting local 
teams in identifying and responding to trafficking within their counties.  JCIP is working with this group on the development of an Oregon bench card for 
juvenile judges.  A dedicated work group consisting of Kristen Farnworth, JCIP, the Honorable Valerie Love, Lane County Circuit Court, and Amanda Swanson, 
has been formed.  This group bench card work group meets regularly in addition to the DOJ CSEC meetings.  The content of the bench card will be educational 
and contain Oregon specific resources.  This choice was made considering the information gathered at the Judicial Education and Leadership Institute (JELI) 
training which was conducted in April 2019 by JCIP.  There, judges from across the state were given the opportunity to provide feedback regarding what they 
would find helpful in a bench card.  That feedback has been used as we create the bench card which will be presented to the committee prior to 
finalization.  The bench card committee hopes to have a completed and approved bench card for distribution no later than December 2019.  

Youth with Specialized Needs Workgroup: In 2017 the new director of OHA and DHS sought information to help them identify systemic barriers to address 
systems which provide care to children and youth with behavioral or mental health needs.  This was largely due to an Oregon State Court Juvenile Justice 
Mental Health task force report issued in January 2016 which identified that a high number of youth in the juvenile justice system meet the criteria for at least 
one mental health disorder.  The study found that the system was not adequately identifying and addressing youth with significant mental health concerns 
who enter the juvenile justice system, and that there was a lack of coordination between service providers when the youth “crossed over” or was involved in 
more than one system and the services which did exist were not trauma informed.  These children or youth were the most likely to be placed in hotels and/or 
out of state placements.  They were more likely to experience “boarding” or stays in the emergency room for extended period of time, and more likely to be 
committed to OYA facilities for reasons not wholly related to delinquent behavior.   The workgroup identified potential areas for exploration and 
recommendations and tasked themselves with identifying specific problems and posing solutions which would not rely solely upon services in the juvenile 
justice system but would incorporate all available services in the community as well.  JCIP participated in this workgroup and helped bridge the gap between 
the courts and the other processes.  The information learned in this workgroup was shared with the Oregon judiciary and community partners through 
trainings put on by JCIP.  JCIP was also able to take information it learned from the judiciary and report back to the committee as a whole.  

  
 ICWA Compliance Workgroup: The ICWA Compliance Workgroup looks at ways to integrate compliance with the ICWA both into existing child welfare 
program improvement plans (Child Welfare Action Plan, Permanency Improvement Plans (PIP)) and judicial requirements such as the ICWA, the federal BIA 
regulations, ICWA related ORS, etc. Topics include improved compliance with placement preferences, ensuring ICWA compliance in emergency removals, 
development of a uniform comprehensive training manual, training for caregivers, and the efficacy of a standalone Oregon ICWA code.   This workgroup was 
initiated by a request to the ICWA Advisory Council from the Tribal Attorney for the Confederated Tribes of Umatilla Indian Reservation. Its first meeting was 
held in November of 2018.  JCIP Staff serve on the workgroup.  The workgroup has three subgroups: The ICWA State Statute Committee, ICWA Stand Alone 
Trainings Committee, and the ICWA Field Work / Case Mapping 

ICWA State Statute Workgroup: JCIP Staff and a Multnomah County Referee participate on this workgroup which began in April 2019. Concerned about legal 
challenges to the Federal ICWA, Oregon plans to introduce its own ICWA Code during the next full legislative session.  There have been several drafts of the 

  T

   

 

31 

legislation.  The group has reviewed several other state ICWA statutes. Also advising the workgroup are David Simmons, NICWA, Craig Dorsay, Siletz Tribal 
Attorneys, Kate Forte, Turtle Talk, Fred Fisher, and Casey Family Programs.   

HS Caregiver Training Redesign Workgroup: This group has worked to create a set of areas, skills, and knowledge that they believe all DHS Child Welfare 

caregivers should be provided.  They have provided recommendations to child welfare leadership on trainers, delivery, timing, competency-based curriculum, 
fidelity, and advanced training.  JCIP staff is providing input on the court process, court appearance and what the court needs to know from caregivers.   

Foster Care Ombudsman Committee: The Foster Care Ombudsman Committee was created from the 2013 passage of Senate Bill 123.  In March 2014, the First 
Foster Care Ombudsman was hired and resided in the Governor’s Advocacy Office and was assigned specifically for matters relating to the Oregon foster care 
system.  The Ombudsman has statutory authority to investigate matters and concerns expressed by those interacting with the foster care system.  The actual 
advisory group was started in August of 2014 and currently consists of current and former foster youth, foster parents, CASA, judicial representatives including 
JCIP, DHS caseworkers, DHS foster home certifiers, Oregon Foster Youth Connection DHS central office program staff, HealthShare, 211 Info, the juvenile 
department, Kinship House, Grand Ronde Tribe, legislative staff and other stakeholders.  The purpose of the committee is accountability and system 
improvement.   The Ombudsman submits fiscal year report regarding the contacts and investigations conducted by the office and collects data. In 2018, the 
office opened 328 cases for investigation.  Training opportunities or opportunities to participate in the legislative process regarding foster care issues are 
presented at these quarterly meetings.  JCIP plays an active role in these meetings in several ways.  JCIP keeps the team apprised of current 
legislation, challenges/innovation experienced by the courts, and incorporates this knowledge into judicial and community partner trainings conducted by 
JCIP.  For example, foster youth have expressed concerns about the emotional care they receive in foster homes and that physical safety is not a substitute for 
emotionally safety.  Foster youth have expressed that their gender or sexual identification is often ignored to the detriment of the child.  In response to shared 
knowledge about this issue, JCIP has presented judicial, community partner, and CRB trainings created to raise awareness of and inclusivity for foster youth 
who identify as LGBTQ.

Legislative FFSPA Workgroup:  Oregon has chosen to implement the Family First Prevention Services Act and a legislative workgroup was formed to that 
end.  JCIP has participated in numerous trainings to understand the act and is an active participant in the legislative workgroup which consulted on several 
prosed bills this legislative session and will continue to assist with the process.  The workgroup itself consists of many stakeholders besides the JCIP team, 
including DHS, attorneys, the juvenile department, judges, and community service providers.  One important function JCIP plays in the workgroup is sharing the 
available data gathered by the team so the potential impact on the court can be assessed and business processes can be created.  JCIP has also been critical in 
bringing judicial concerns to the committee, such as a concern about the numbers of available placements, so that the workgroup can be aware of potential 
impacts.  Several judges were concerned that the implementation of QRTPs would prevent Oregon youth from receiving services if no Oregon programs could 
qualify as a QRTP.  The workgroup then gathered and presented information largely alleviating these concerns.   

Year 4 (July 2019 through June 2020) 
Governors Foster Care Advisory Commission: 
JCIP staff monitor the meetings and provide technical assistance and information as needed.  JCIP collaborated with the Commission to host and facilitate a 
round table discussion/dinner for child welfare stakeholders from four counties (Umatilla, Baker, Klamath, and Coos) in August 2019.  This event gave the 
Commission the opportunity to hear from people who would otherwise need to travel a distance to participate in a Commission meeting.  Since that meeting, 
there has been a major shift among members of the Commission.  JCIP staff helped to recruit potential applicants for vacant positions on the Commission and 
has offered technical assistance and support to the Commission.  The Commission continues to struggle without consistent, dedicated staff support.

Child Welfare Advisory Committee: 
JCIP staff and one juvenile court judge participate in the CWAC.  This group is a legislatively mandated 21-member Advisory Committee that provides the child 
welfare program with advice on the development and administration of child welfare policies, programs and practices.  The group meets every other month.  
Members represent other state agencies, representatives of professional, civic or other private organizations and private citizens who have an interest in the 
foster care and child welfare systems.  The CWAC is going through organizational changes as the new CW leadership decides how they want to engage the 
CWAC. As a result, many of the meetings this past year have been agency reports to the CWAC on key initiatives as well as organizational discussion concerning 
bylaws, membership, and meeting format. 

HS ICWA Advisory Committee: JCIP staff continues to meet quarterly with DHS and members of the 9 federally recognized Tribes in Oregon to discuss policy, 

programs, practice, and data that impact ICWA eligible children.  The Advisory Council continues its focus on reducing disproportionality and the high rate of 
out-of-home placement for Native children in Oregon. They have been monitoring their Native American/Tribal Research Agenda.   JCIP, the Department of 
Justice and DHS presented a two-day training for prospective QEW’s in Multnomah County and had attendees participate in mock testimony and cross 
examination in a courtroom.  Participants said that was a very valuable experience and prepared them to give future QEW testimony.  The Tribal Affairs Unit 
obtained a request from the Tribal Affairs Director in the State of Washington to host a QEW training for some Washington Tribes.  A QEW training video is 
being explored as well. The subcommittee would like to develop a short informational video to help explain QEW under the ICWA and the process of obtaining 
a QEW if the identified tribe under ICWA is unable to provide testimony.  QEW testimony continues to be monitored to ensure compliance with the ICWA and 
correct usage of qualified expert witnesses.    JCIP presents quarterly data of QEW testimony occurring at shelter and jurisdiction hearings. DHS provides JCIP 
with a list of ICWA cases filed in the previous quarter and JCIP staff reviews the court hearings to determine QEW presence.  

ICWA Compliance Committee: The ICWA Compliance Committee brings together tribal partners, DHS representatives and other state partners. The objective 
behind the committee is addressing ICWA compliance within the Oregon Child Welfare system and identify intervention strategies that promote compliance in 
child welfare practice. The committee is divided into three subcommittees: State Statute, Training Development, and Case Mapping. These subcommittees 
report back to the Compliance Committee who then report back to the ICWA Advisory committee.  

ICWA State Statute Workgroup: JCIP and OJD staff participated on the Oregon Indian Child Welfare Act (OICWA) committee.  The bill passed out of the House 
Judiciary Committee, of the House Floor and out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Due to the dynamics at the end of the session, it did not ultimately come 
to a vote on the Senate Floor and therefore did not pass. However, the Oregon Legislature held a special session in late June 2020, and HB 4214 The OREGON 
INDIAN CHILD WELFARE (OICW) Bill passed.  JCIP has been working with a planning group to plan our 2020 Model Court Summit which will focus on the 
ICWA and new OICW provisions. 

HS Caregiver Training Redesign Workgroup: The focus of the Training redesign efforts this year was to ensure that prospective and currently certified foster 

parents/relative caregivers/prospective adoptive parents understand race and racism and the direct impacts to the children, young adults and families they 
serve.  The group wanted to leave families, during their preservice training experience, with tools and skills, and next steps to go deeper in their knowledge, 
and understanding of their very important role as a caregiver. The work around racial equity and how to use our privilege and position to combat racism and 
advance anti-oppressive practice was valuable not only to the redesign efforts but to everyone who actively participated in this advisory group.  Unfortunately, 
due to COVID-19 the curriculum design work has been put on hold.

Foster Care Ombudsman Committee:  JCIP continues to play an active role in these meetings and uses information gained in the meetings to inform 
educational programs for judges and stakeholders.  JCIP staff provides the Committee Members and the Ombudsman with information regarding court 
processes as court related concerns are raised. 

Legislative FFSPA Workgroup:  Oregon has chosen to implement the Family First Prevention Services Act and a legislative workgroup was formed to that 
end.  JCIP has participated in numerous trainings to understand the act and is an active participant in the legislative workgroup which consulted on several 
prosed bills this legislative session and will continue to assist with the process.  The workgroup itself consists of many stakeholders besides the JCIP team, 
including DHS, attorneys, the juvenile department, judges, and community service providers.  One important function JCIP plays in the workgroup is sharing the 
available data gathered by the team so the potential impact on the court can be assessed and business processes can be created.  JCIP has also been critical in 
bringing judicial concerns to the committee, such as a concern about the numbers of available placements, so that the workgroup can be aware of potential 
impacts.  JCIP collaborated with DHS on the development of forms and processes for QRTP reviews and conducted a webinar in June 2020 explaining the court 
role and process with QRTP placements.  The Oregon Legislature passed a bill in the June 2020 Special Legislative Session that sets out the implementation of 
the QRTP provision until December 2020.  JCIP will continue to work with the DHS FFPSA implementation Team. 

In November 2016, JCIP participated in the Parent Representation Leadership Forum with Idaho, Washington and Alaska.  At that forum, JCIP and our statewide 
partners developed an action plan to improve early visitation between children and parents when children are removed from the home.  Pursuant to the plan, DHS has 
conducted outreach with caseworkers about working with parents and care providers to provide a first visit with 48 hours to a week, in accordance with DHS policy.    
JCIP has also been working with partners on a shelter hearing protocol to be presented to judges at the Through the Eyes of a Child conference in August, 2017.  Part of 
the protocol includes an instruction to consider ordering a first visit at the shelter hearing.  JCIP has been working with the JELI model forms group on revising the 
model Shelter Order to include a prompt to order a first visit.  

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018): 

In the second half of 2017, JCIP staff continued working on implementation of the Oregon plan that was developed with DHS, DOJ, and OPDS to increase the 
percentages of children entering foster care who receive a first visit with parents within 48 hours of removal and within one week of removal.  JCIP staff presented at 
the Through the Eyes of a Child Conference to judges, the Model Court Summit to Model Court Teams, and at the Juvenile Law Training Academy to lawyers to explain 
the goals of the project, and to present the elements of the Model Shelter Hearing Protocol that was developed to help Model Court Teams improve their processing of 
cases at the shelter hearing.   

HS is collecting data regarding the number of visits occurring within 48 hours of removal and within a week of removal for each county.  These statistics will be shared 

with Model Court Teams at the annual Model Court Summit in August 2018, where the morning sessions will focus on enhancing visitation as a way to decrease the 
time to reunification.

Project 4 – Work with partners to increase the number of children who receive a first visit with at least one parent within the first week of placement 
 

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017):  

n August 2018, JCIP began the Model Court Summit with a keynote presentation by Dr. Marty Beyer.  She presented research about the importance of parenting time 
for parents and children, appropriate levels of parenting time, and parenting time for incarcerated parents.  As part of the focus on parenting time, JCIP reminded 
Model Court Teams about the joint project to ensure that a first visit happens within a week and provided them planning time to go over statewide and county level 
data regarding the occurrence of visits within the first week. 

During the process of preparing for the summit, JCIP realized that the caseworker data entry regarding the first visit has been inconsistent.  JCIP has been working with 
DHS on that issue during the first half of 2019 and hope to have better protocols in place moving forward.  JCIP anticipates this work will make it easier for model court 
teams to understand if they need to make additional efforts to ensure a greater percentage of parents and children are receiving a first visit within the first week of the 
child’s stay in foster care.  

Year 3 (July 2018 through June 2019)

Year 4 (July 2019 through June 2020) 

JCIP staff continued to meet and work with DHS staff to improve the ability of DHS to collect data regarding how many children are receiving visits within the first week 
of removal.  Collecting and distributing that data is an important step to helping model court teams understand whether sufficient efforts are being made to ensure 
early contact between parent and child in each judicial district. 
 

roject 5 – Collaborate with the National Center for State Courts to implement and evaluate the Reimagining Dependency Courts project 

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017):  

Since December 2016, JCIP has continued work on two pieces of the Reimagining Dependency Courts project: a Differentiated Case Management Project (DCM) 
focusing on four pilot courts, and a predictive analytics project utilizing data one of the four pilot courts.   Work on the DCM project has included working closely with 
judges and staff from pilot courts to develop, document, and implement six case management tracks to which dependency cases may be assigned; creating an 
instrument to use for assigning new cases; and working to configure Odyssey to record the track assignments and alert staff to which track a case has been assigned.   

JCIP has simultaneously been working with court and DHS data to assemble a dataset containing information on parent and child characteristics and case histories for 
dependency cases filed in Deschutes County Circuit Court in 2012, 2013, and 2014.  Once the dataset is complete, it will be sent to NCSC for analysis of whether the 
factors in the dataset – which include child and parent age, size of the sibling group, and parent prior court involvement, are predictive of whether the child will remain 
in foster care for over two years, whether the child will achieve each permanency outcome, and of how timely the child’s permanency will be.  

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018): 

In Year 2, JCIP continued working with NCSC and select Oregon circuit courts on both the DCM and predictive analytics parts of the Reimagining Dependency Courts 
project.  After the DCM Project rolled out in late May 2017, JCIP held monthly calls with the four pilot courts to ensure consistency between the courts.  JCIP staff 
created a Microsoft Access form and database to collect information on case characteristics that are driving case assignments, and provided data to the pilot courts on 
the numbers of cases assigned to each track, the characteristics driving case assignment, and differences in assignments and characteristics between the pilot courts.

JCIP also worked with the pilot courts to create and distribute a survey to assess stakeholder attitudes toward the project.  The survey went out in late February 2018, 
nine months after the start of the DCM Project, and the results showed that many stakeholders believe it remains too early to evaluate the success of the Project, but 
that those that have formed opinions generally believe that the additional hearings from the Project have been somewhat or very productive, that the Project is an 
improvement on how the court ran previously, and that the Project should continue. 

JCIP also worked with NCSC in Year 2 on a predictive analytics project aimed at finding a list of factors that identify children who are likely to stay in foster care for two 
years or more, and then incorporate those factors into the criteria for assigning cases to tracks in the DCM Project.  NCSC’s analysis of data provided by JCIP from 
Deschutes County showed promising results for several case characteristics, and NCSC recommended attempting the analysis on a larger sample of cases.  JCIP then 
assembled data from eight additional courts, but the subsequent analysis showed that only two factors – the child having a previous dependency case, and the child 
having no legal father on the dependency case – were consistently associated with a long stay in foster care, and that those two factors themselves were not strongly 
predictive. 

In light of the implementation of the DCM Project and the lack of strong predictors from the predictive analytics research, JCIP has worked with NCSC on developing an 
evaluation plan and has asked NCSC and Dr. Alicia Summers for a cost estimate.  The plan includes a process evaluation report exploring whether the pilot courts have 
implemented the DCM Project with fidelity and whether the DCM tool is succeeding in identifying high risk cases, and, in 2020, an outcome report examining whether 
the Project has resulted in children exiting foster care more quickly. 

JCIP has also been working on pursuing funding for two part-time positions that are funded by NCSC through September 2018 and is submitting a Policy Option Package 
to the Oregon Legislature to provide ongoing funding for the Project. 

Year 3 (July 2018 through June 2019): 

 JCIP’s focus in Year 3 was working with the National Center for State Courts and Dr. Alicia Summers on a process evaluation of the DCM Project.  JCIP worked with Dr. 
Summers to identify research questions and create a tool for observation of the DCM Project’s limited review hearings; conducted in-person and remote observations 
of the hearings; and funded a court staff person to coordinate the project in two of the courts and conduct a file review to determine which tracks old cases would have 
been assigned to if they had been part of the project.   JCIP also assembled data on: the time from case filing to case closure (both before and after implementation); 
the tracks to which cases were assigned and reassigned; and the timeliness of the permanency hearings, review hearings, and CRB reviews on the assigned cases. 

Dr. Summers completed the process evaluation in February 2019, and her report showed that the courts have implemented the DCM model with fidelity.  The file 
review of older cases, however, showed that there were not significant differences in time to exit between cases that would have been assigned to various tracks had 
they been in the project.  It also showed that, aside from the child having previously been a ward of the court, the factors used to assign cases to the tracks were not 
predictive of longer stays in foster care.  Dr. Summers did find preliminary evidence that children are exiting the system more quickly in the DCM courts than they were 
prior to implementation, but she determined that it was too early to draw conclusions regarding improved outcomes.  Dr. Summers recommended that the courts 
continue the project for another year which will allow for a full outcome evaluation. 

JCIP brought the DCM courts together in May 2019 to discuss the results of the study, and each of the four courts agreed to continue the project through June 2020 to 
generate three full years of data for an outcome evaluation.  The courts also decided to ask for more information from DHS about factors that DHS has found to be 
predictive of long stays in foster care, and to consider changes to the case assignment factors after July 1, 2019. 

 

36 

Year 4 (July 2019 through June 2020) 

JCIP continued to meet with DCM courts throughout year 4, including the months leading up to the Covid-19 pandemic.  All four courts had agreed to continue the 
project through June of 2020 and JCIP was able to generate enough data for an outcome evaluation by Dr. Summers.  However, due to Covid-19 related time and 
financial restraints, it is unknown when that evaluation will take place.  Since the COVID-19 Pandemic greatly impacted court operations, the DCM courts have 
discontinued using DCM procedures and tracks.  The courts have individually discussed plans to reimplement various components of the project that they felt had the 
most positive impact on local permanency outcomes, however those efforts will likely not happen until; late 2020 or early 2021. 

Project 6 – Work with DHS to establish an automated transfer of data from Odyssey to OR-Kids 

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017):  

This project was added to the JCIP Strategic Plan in June 2017 contingent on data grant funding, and JCIP did some work with ETSD and DHS to lay the ground work for a 
data transfer in fall 2016 and spring 2017.  

In Year 2, JCIP has worked with DHS, ETSD, and CECM to determine whether resources are available to work on the data transfer, and, once a determination was made 
that work could proceed, identify the specific case types and data points to be transferred.  JCIP has worked with DHS to develop a tentative list of case types and data 
elements, and stages for implementation, and ETSD is beginning to work on the technical aspects of the transfer.  JCIP however, is waiting the completion of an 
unrelated OJD data transfer, and the completion of a legal agreement between DHS and OJD, before detailed planning can begin.  

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018): 

Year 3 (July 2018 through June 2019): 

In Year 3, JCIP worked with DHS and ETSD to determine what the needs were and what would be transferred.  OJD has agreed to transfer judgements and common 
types of orders for three basic case types (Juvenile Dependency, Juvenile Termination of Parental Rights, and Juvenile Dependency Judicial Determination) to DHS daily.  
Additionally, two separate Enterprise Custom Reports (ECRs) are being developed to supplement the data transfer:  one that provides the necessary information that 
allows DHS to match Odyssey cases with OR-KIDS cases and the other is to provide future hearing dates.  OJD is working with DHS to finalize the details of the data 
transfer as well as a data transfer agreement.  Completion is expected sometime in the second half of 2019. 

Year 4 (July 2019 through June 2020) 

In Year 4, OJD and DHS agreed to the parameters of a data transfer in early July of 2019. The ECR’s were developed by ETSD and were ready for the testing in late July 
2019.  OJD is awaiting confirmation from DHS that the testing phase is complete, and the data transfer can begin.  This was originally delayed because the person at 
DHS who was managing this project was on extended medical leave.  When they returned, many efforts were restricted because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  JCIP hopes 
that DHS will reinitiate the testing phase so this project can be concluded before the end of 2020.  

Project 7 – Plan and deliver annual Oregon Model Court Summit on Child Abuse and Neglect 

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017):  

37 

 

Not applicable - this project not included in the FY2017 strategic plan due to loss of the training grant, but was reincorporated in June 2017 contingent on restoration 
training grant funds.    

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018): 

JCIP held the 2017 Model Court Summit on Child Abuse and Neglect on August 8, and there were 274 attendees.  There were sessions on safety, permanency, and well-
being.  Respondents to the evaluation found it very helpful to have blocks of time after each presentation to have discussion with their team; 88% said there was 
sufficient opportunity to exchange ideas with other participants and 77% said it will assist their team’s work to improve the way their county handles child abuse and 
neglect cases.   

lanning for the 2018 Summit began in late 2017, and the Summit will focus on visitation and permanency (including finalization of adoption), with a closing session on 

ICWA emergency placements, active efforts, and placement preferences. 

ear 3 (July 2018 through June 2019): 

JCIP held the 2018 Model Court Summit on Child Abuse and Neglect on August 7, 2018, and there were 296 attendees.  There were sessions on reunification, how to 
work with the incarcerated parents, moving cases to permanency and the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) placement preferences. Team time was included, and the 
conference received positive reviews.   

lanning for the 2019 Summit began in late 2018, and the Summit will focus on improving practice using specific counties as examples, removals, shelter hearings and 

identification of placement with an emphasis on compliance with the Indian Child Welfare Act, changes to Oregon law, FFPSA and related topics. 

ear 4 (July 2019 through June 2020) 

he 2019 Model Court Summit provided opportunities for local court improvement teams to learn how different jurisdictions implemented specific strategies to 
improve the effectiveness and efficiencies of their juvenile court system.  It also prepared teams for Oregon’s implementation of the FFPSA.  Teams developed their 
own specific strategies to improve outcomes at different stages of dependency proceedings and to participated in intradisciplinary discussion sessions with peers from 
other jurisdictions. There were 284 attendees with 72% rating the conference as facilitating meaningful and challenging discussions among their teams. 

lanning for the 2020 Summit has focused on the Indian Child Welfare Act.  Oregon sent a team to the ICWA Court Collaborative in Denver, Colorado.  Participants came 

back inspired and with a deeper understanding of the Spirit Behind the ICWA.  They heard from Sheldon Spotted Elk who has done training for Casey on this topic.  He 
will be the keynote for the ICWA Model Court Summit.  Brad Lundahl will speak on Motivational Interviewing and how to engage parents in case planning.  Oregon 
Tribes and organizations will talk about their services, how they weave culture into them, and strategies DHS and courts can use to engage Indian children and families.  
There will also be information about major components of the OICW bill and Representative Sanchez will talk about her experience carrying the bill.    The conference 
will be remote in 2020 and there are currently 450 people registered to attend.

Project 8 – Provide training, technical assistance, and data analysis to courts and multi-disciplinary Model Court Teams 

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017):  

 

38 

Not applicable - this project not included in the FY2017 strategic plan due to loss of the training grant, but was reincorporated in June 2017 contingent on restoration 
training grant funds.    

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018): 

JCIP staff facilitated a Model Court start up session in Deschutes County in January 2018 in response to a request from the court for assistance with its planning in 
response to the budget note in Oregon House Bill 5006 (2017), which required all courts to “solicit input on, develop, and implement strategies to improve the 
effectiveness and efficiency of Oregon’s juvenile dependency system and to determine the appropriate level of legal services.”  JCIP staff shared the court’s data with 
the team and then led them through a facilitated discussion to examine their Juvenile Court system using their court’s responses to a survey designed to assist in 
identifying strategies to fulfill the requirements of the HB 5006 Budget Note.  The team prioritized the top three improvements that could be made in their court and 
began to develop strategies to accomplish one of them.     

Year 3 (July 2018 through June 2019) 

JCIP staff facilitated two Model Court Start up sessions.  One was in Lake County and the other was in Multnomah County.  Multnomah County is Oregon’s largest 
county and has not had a true Model Court team.  Prior to this point they had been meeting as a Child Welfare Council that consisted mainly of information sharing 
about programs and on goings in the community.  They have now been looking at their data and making plans for decreasing the time to jurisdiction for both parents.  
Lake County is one of the smallest counties and prioritized setting a consistent daily time for shelter hearings and having attorneys available to meet with parents prior 
to the Shelter Hearing.    Lincoln County had a strong Model Court Team however their judge was out for an extended time and their team dwindled and had become 
inactive.  JCIP staff worked with CRB staff to pull the team back together and helped facilitate a session on Improving the Effectiveness and efficiency of their Juvenile 
Court System.  The Lincoln Model court selected “Improve timeliness to permanency – Finalizing adoptions within a year of a child being legally free” as their goal and 
developed strategies to accomplish that.  They review their adoption data at every Model Court Team to see how strategies are working.       

Year 4 (July 2019 through June 2020) 

JCIP staff facilitated a Model Court session for the Douglas County Model Court Team.  They wanted to look at their data and choose new direction for the team.  They 
decided to plan to decrease their time to Jurisdiction.   

JCIP hosted a virtual Model Court Team convening with the three intervention counties (now Josephine, Lane, and Douglas) on  6/12/20. In addition to MCT members 
from the three counties, three OJD/JCIP staff and six DHS central office permanency program staff participated (CO staff: 2 Permanency Consultants, 3 Legal Assistance 
Specialists/LAS, Assistant Program Manager).  The convening was used as a time to collaboratively: review the improvement strategies developed for each intervention 
county, review permanency data (OJD and DHS) for each county and statewide and discuss ways to use data for planning/assessment, review successes and barriers to 
achieving goals thus far, conduct break-out groups for each county to discuss their strategies/activities/additional permanency improvement and planning regarding 
further implementation and ways to address barriers, and to debrief the county specific planning and sharing of strategies/issues with the entire convening group. 
Expectations were set for the MCTs to continue this important work in their regularly scheduled meetings, for the judges to continue championing this work, and for the 
three teams to provide reports/updates of their progress and any issues.

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018): 

Project 9 – Collaborate with DHS and Oregon’s federally recognized Tribes to continue implementation of the QUICWA Project 

JCIP’s involvement with the QUICWA Project was curtailed after the loss of the data and training grants, but JCIP has continued to participate on the QUICWA Steering 
Committee, which has guided DHS’s work to provide a scope of work to the Oregon CASA Network in the hopes that they may be able to take on and coordinate data 
collection for the project.  

JCIP continued to provide data analysis and data entry support to the QUICWA Project, and, as part of the QUICWA Steering Committee, helped guide the Project’s 
implementation.  JCIP produced statewide QUICWA data reports for the ICWA Advisory Committee in August 2017 and January 2018, as well as a more detailed report 
to introduce new DHS leadership to the Project and assist them in considering whether to prioritize it. 

JCIP also put together a report on data collected in Marion County and facilitated a meeting between the Marion County judges, JCIP, and leaders from the Grand 
Ronde Tribe.   The data led to a rich discussion about ICWA compliance in which the judges shared the difficulties they face and learned about details of the new ICWA 
regulations. 

JCIP also assisted in exploring options for supporting QUICWA data collection, which, for the nearly five years of the Project, has been piecemeal and inconsistent.  DHS 
has shown some willingness to contract with local CASA programs to support data collection in the four target counties, but no progress has been made beyond 
receiving estimates from two local CASA programs as to what ongoing, CASA-supported data collection would cost.   

Due to the lack of progress on support for data collection, JCIP brought up the future of the QUICWA Project at the May 2018 DHS ICWA Advisory Committee Meeting, 
and the Committee decided to put the Project on pause.  Based on this decision, JCIP is removing the QUICWA Project from its strategic plan, but will reinsert it if DHS, 
Oregon’s federally-recognized tribes, and JCIP jointly determine that it is a priority for monitoring and improvement ICWA compliance. 

Project 10 – Collaborate with stakeholders to plan, deliver, and support trainings on issues in juvenile dependency cases for attorneys, DHS, CASAs, CRB volunteers, and other 
stakeholders  

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017):  

Not applicable - this project not included in the FY2017 strategic plan due to loss of the training grant, but was reincorporated in June 2017 contingent on restoration 
training grant funds.    

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018):

In Year 2, JCIP worked with partners in planning and delivering several multi-disciplinary trainings on juvenile dependency cases, and provided both staff planning and 
financial support to two key stakeholder conferences.   The first was the Juvenile Law Training Academy, which took place in October 2017 and included a JCIP 
presentation on the new Model Shelter Hearing Protocol, which is intended to increase the percentages of children who visit with their parents within 48 hours and 
within a week of removal.   

JCIP staff also provided financial support and served on the planning committee of the Shoulder to Shoulder Conference, a conference open to foster parents, CASAs, 
CRB volunteers, and other professionals and volunteers who work with families in child welfare.  One former judge/JCIP employee provided a session on implicit bias, 
and a current judge conducted a session on domestic violence. 

Finally, JCIP staff collaborated with DOJ on a training on the new BIA ICWA Regulations for attorneys, DHS staff, CASAs, CRB volunteers, judges, and tribal child welfare 
staff in Newport.  JCIP and DOJ conducted a webinar on the same topic for judges across the state.  JCIP also collaborated with the DHS and with the Klamath Tribe to 
conduct a similar training for CASAs, CRB volunteers, and tribal child welfare staff in Klamath Falls.   

JCIP staff also facilitated a multi-disciplinary panel discussion at the CRB Conference on how to understand the difference between reasonable and active efforts.  The 
panel included two judges, two attorneys, and an ICWA consultant from DHS. 

Year 3 (July 2018 through June 2019) 

JCIP again worked with partners in planning and delivering multi-disciplinary training.  Staff and financial support were provided for the Juvenile Law Academy and the 
Shoulder to Shoulder Conference.  There were 787 attendees at the Shoulder to Shoulder Conference.  A panel of three judges from Columbia County, Multnomah 
County and Washington County provided a workshop entitled “From the Bench”. JCIP Staff facilitated. The workshop received an aggregate score of 4.25 out of 5. JCIP 
Staff served as the emcee for the conference.  JCIP Staff has been working with DHS on an Adoption Training for the CRB Conference and will be presenting a webinar 
on the Adoption Tracking Sheet (see Project 1 for more details). 

Additionally, JCIP was involved with the planning of the Juvenile Law Training Academy and coordinated and will present the CRB conference on May 17-18, 2019.  
Those two conferences were attended by various stakeholders including attorneys, CASA, judges, juvenile departments and DHS.  

Year 4 (July 2019 through June 2020) 

JCIP again worked with partners in planning and delivering multi-disciplinary training.  Staff and financial support were provided for the Juvenile Law Academy and the 
Shoulder to Shoulder Conference.  There were more than 700 attendees at the fall 2019 Shoulder to Shoulder Conference.  A panel of three judges from Multnomah, 
Clackamas, and Marion counties provided a workshop entitled “From the Bench”. JCIP provided financial support for the Eastern Oregon Diversity Summit that is 
organized by Child Welfare Stakeholders in rural Eastern Oregon.  This event draws more than 100 attendees.  

Additionally, JCIP was involved with the planning of the Juvenile Law Training Academy and had planned to assist with presentations at the CRB conference on May 
2020; however, that event was canceled due to COVID-19.

JCIP did not make progress on this project in Year 2, as the JCIP data analyst’s work focused primarily on other data-related projects: 

the Reimagining Dependency Courts project (see Outcome 2, Project 5) 
the data transfer from OJD’s Odyssey case management system to the DHS OR-Kids case management system (see Outcome 2, Project 6) 
the joint – agency CIP permanency project (see Outcome 2, Project 1) 
ongoing work to disseminate JCIP’s quarterly statistical reports, train courts on proper data entry procedures, and improve data quality (see Outcome 2, 
Project 2). 

Year 3 (July 2018 through June 2019): 

JCIP did not make progress on this project in Year 3, as the JCIP’s data-related work focused primarily on: 

the Reimagining Dependency Courts project (Outcome 2, Project 5) 
the data transfer from OJD’s Odyssey case management system to the DHS OR-Kids case management system (Outcome 2, Project 6) 
development of visual, interactive reports to allow courts and stakeholders to better use and understand court data (Outcome 2, Project 2) 
training JCIP’s new data analyst to provide stakeholders with existing data on juvenile dependency cases (Outcome 2, Project 2) and to create the reports 
needed to implement JCIP’s hearing quality project (Outcome 1, Project 1). 

Year 4 (July 2019 through June 2020) 

Since this project has been delayed due to other activities, rather than spend the time on a full report of a project that is several years old, JCIP staff summarized the 
key findings of the 2016 File Review (see one pager attached below).   

 few items that are most relevant from that review are: 

Courts made negative reasonable/active efforts findings in fewer than 1% of all judgments and orders reviewed (excluding limited review judgments/orders, as 
the court doesn’t need to make reasonable/active efforts findings at those hearings)  
Eleven percent of all hearings reviewed were rescheduled or continued, and the average delay was almost 40 days 

• 
•  Rescheduling and continuances were more common for permanency hearings (16%) and delays were longer (just under two months on average) 
• 

In comparing data to prior reviews, participation of fathers, CASAs, foster parents, and grandparents/other relatives in court hearings has gone up over time for 
most hearing types, as has the percentage of judgments and orders with reasonable/active efforts findings).

The tribe was present at 45% of reviewed hearings, and had an attorney present at 7% 
Shelters orders were rarely based on expert witness testimony and often did not have findings about emergency jurisdiction 
Shelter orders and jurisdiction and disposition judgments frequently lacked findings about whether the tribe received notice of the proceeding 

Also attached below is a one page summary of the ICWA Sample from the 2016 File Review.  The main takeaways are: 
• 
• 
• 
•  Most jurisdiction and disposition judgments referenced expert witness testimony 
• 
 

The sample did not contain any negative active efforts findings and contained only three findings that the placement preferences were not followed

roject 12 – Develop and deliver a training for judges, attorneys and other legal personnel in child welfare cases on federal child welfare policies and payment limitations 

with respect to children in foster care who are placed in settings that are not a family foster home 

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017) 

Not applicable – this is a new project in the JCIP strategic plan, added in June 2018. 

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018) 

This is a new project added as a result of the new court improvement plan training requirements in the Family First Prevention Services Act (FFPSA) of 2018.  A 
workgroup has been convened by State Senator Sara Gelser to coordinate Oregon implementation of the FFPSA.  JCIP and DHS are represented in this group and have 
had initial discussion about the timing of implementation of qualified residential treatment program provisions.  At this time, all indications are that Oregon will not 
request a delay in implementation.  JCIP will be working later in 2018 with DHS, DOJ and OPDS on efforts to implement the new requirements of the FFPSA and 
developing a training consistent with Oregon’s implementation. 

JCIP has been working with DHS, DOJ, OPDS, and other stakeholders on the language which would implement FFPSA.  Curriculum development is underway to provide 
FFPSA specific training at the Through the Eyes of a Child/Model Court Summit planned for August 11-13, 2019.  The JCIP team attended the State Team Planning 
conference and the Children’s Bureau Child Abuse Conference in Washington DC in April and was able to collaborate with DHS, learn from other state teams, and take 
away a wealth of information about prevention services.  This information will be incorporated into various trainings throughout the year.  

Year 3 (July 2018 through June 2019) 

Year 4 (July 2018 through June 2019) 

There were two sessions on the FFPSA at the 2019 Model Court Summit on Child Abuse and Neglect.  The first had presenters from the Department of Human Services, 
the Department of Justice and the Public Defense Services Commission speak about components of the federal law- 1) services to prevent removal 2)family foster

homes as opposed to congregate care and 3)support to recruit and train high quality foster families and relative providers - and how Oregon plans to implement it. The 
second had The Honorable Nan Waller and Staci Barry from the Department of Justice speak about Oregon’s SB 171 and how it codified the federal requirements into 
Oregon law.  Presenters discussed the new funding requirements, placements that will be available, the appropriateness of the placement and the role of attorneys and 
judges. 

Project 13 – Work with local model court teams in driver counties identified in the DHS Program Improvement Plan (PIP) to reduce the time needed to achieve permanency 

This is a new project added to the strategic plan in June 2018 to participate in and support DHS’s work to improve the timeliness of permanency through its CFSR PIP.  
JCIP participated in PIP permanency discussions in which five DHS target districts were chosen, but later versions of DHS’s PIP have narrowed the focus to two or three 
jurisdictions, and work will begin in Year 3 to identify those locations. 

This is a new project added to the strategic plan in June 2018 to participate in and support DHS’s work to improve the timeliness of permanency through its CFSR PIP.  
Work will begin in Year 3. 

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017) 

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018): 

Year 3 (July 2018 through June 2019) 

JCIP focused efforts on the Budget Note Strategies to Improve the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the Juvenile Dependency System, required all Oregon Circuit Courts to 
assess their local court strengths and areas needing improvement, and to develop local plans for improvement in one of four areas.  These areas were 1. Effective 
judicial led settlement conferences, 2. Consistent daily time for shelter hearings, ensuring parents have the opportunity to meet with an attorney prior to the shelter 
hearing, 3. Clearly written policies at the local level prioritizing juvenile dependency cases, and 4. Improve timeliness to permanency for children to finalize adoptions 
within a year of a child being legally available for adoption.  Improving court effectiveness and efficiency should reduce the time needed to achieve permanency. 

Year 4 (July 2019 through June 2020) 

JCIP hosted a virtual Model Court Team convening with the three intervention counties (now Josephine, Lane, and Douglas) on  6/12/20. In addition to MCT members 
from the three counties, three OJD/JCIP staff and six DHS central office permanency program staff participated (CO staff: 2 Permanency Consultants, 3 Legal Assistance

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017):  

This project has been a priority for JCIP for years but was not formally added to the Strategic Plan until June 2018.  In Year 1, JCIP’s data analyst participated in two 
follow-up CFSRs in Marion County, and CRB field managers participated in reviews in Jackson and Clackamas Counties. 

This project was not formally added to the Strategic Plan until June 2018, but JCIP did assist in follow-up CFSR reviews in Year 2 in Washington County, and will be 
assisting with reviews at the end of Year2 in Jackson County. 

JCIP’s Model Court and Training Analyst participated in the Columbia County CFSR review in October of 2018.  The Training Analyst and the Data Analyst will be 
participating in the Jackson County CFSR in June 2019.  One CRB Field Manager did reviews in East Multnomah County in the fall of 2018 and another CRB Field Manager 
will be doing reviews in Multnomah in September 2019.  

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018): 

Year 3 (July 2018 through June 2019) 

Year 4 (July 2019 through June 2020) 

JCIP continues to participate in CFSR reviews around the state.  In 2019, the JCIP Data Analyst and Training Analyst participated in CFSR reviews in Jackson County as 
DHS needed the most help at that location.  A CRB Field Manager participated in the Polk County CFSR review in April.  In 2020, the Data Analyst is scheduled to 
participate in the East Multnomah County CFSR review in September and the Training Analyst participated in the Jackson County CFSR Review in May.   

Project 15 – Conduct Parent-Child Representation Project (PCRP) Summit to bring together system partners from the five PCRP counties to share best practices and lessons 
learned from their implementation 
 

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017):  

Not applicable – this project was not added to the Strategic Plan until June 2018. 

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018):  

Not applicable – this project was not added to the Strategic Plan until June 2018.  JCIP will begin working with the five PCRP counties (Yamhill, Linn, Columbia, Coos, and 
Lincoln) later in 2018 to plan the summit.

Due to staffing changes at the Office of Public Defense Services, and then COVID -19 restrictions, this event was put on hold.  Multnomah County transitioned to a PCRP 
county in July 2020.  JCIP will reach out to OPDS and the PCRP counties to see if there is interest in a virtual summit. 

roject 16 – Identify and implement ways to streamline processing of juvenile dependency cases in Odyssey 

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017) 

This project was not added to the Strategic Plan until June 2018, but JCIP was, in Year 1, listening to feedback from judges and stakeholders on issues with case 
processing in Odyssey and considering potential solutions. 

This project was not added to the Strategic Plan until June 2018, but JCIP did, in Year 2, make a proposal to implement a one-case-per-child-per-care-episode system in 
place of the current system of opening a new case every time a new petition is filed post-disposition.  The OJD’s Court Re-engineering and Efficiencies Workgroup could 
not reach a consensus on the proposal, and JCIP is currently moving towards convening a group of court staff, judges, and stakeholders to discuss identify potential 
efficiencies for case processing in Odyssey. 

In late 2018 and early 2019, JCIP held a series of meetings with court staff and judges to discuss how to best implement a one-case-per-child-per-care-episode.  Though 
contentious, the group eventually decided that the one-case-per-child-per-care-episode would make seeing the case in Odyssey much clearer and allow for faster 
processing by both judges and court staff.  The group settled on some basic concepts for how the process would work and began the process of finalizing changes for a 
proposed UTCR and corresponding business processes.  

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018) 

Year 3 (July 2018 through June 2019) 

Year 4 (July 2019 through June 2020) 

In 2019 JCIP divided the large workgroup that was previously working on the one-case-per-child-per-care-episode into smaller groups to further develop 
the concepts.  These include a: (1) rules group, (2) business process group and (3) forms group.  While this has been challenging at times due to the 
constraints on the ability to hold in person meetings, we’ve made a lot of progress.   

We have created a proposed rule and judgment form, both of which are attached.  We also created new business process to accommodate the new rule, 
which will simplify the Odyssey data entry process for clerks.  We originally were planning a training for court staff on July 16th with an expected

courts are currently experiencing, we have reconsidered.  We are now looking at November 1st as a possible implementation date, or later, if there are 
reasons for further delay.

Priority Area #3: Other 

Outcome #3:  Improved judicial practices and leadership in juvenile dependency cases 

Need Driving Activities & Data Source: How do you know this is a need in your state? JCIP receives consistent feedback from judges that juvenile law and the juvenile code is 
complicated and difficult to navigate.  Furthermore, they indicate that JCIP-sponsored training provides them an otherwise-unavailable opportunity to improve their handling of 
juvenile cases.  It also provides them an opportunity to find out how judges in other jurisdictions handle similar issues within their courts and to discuss best practices.  Finally, it 
provides a forum where JCIP can deliver in-person training to judges about changes in state and federal law, including Title IVE requirements, such as the Preventing Sex 
Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act and the latest information about best practices and the FFPSA. 

Theory of Change: Training and technical assistance will provide Oregon judges with the knowledge and capacity they need to improve judicial practices and provide strong 
leadership in dependency cases.

roject 1 – Develop and deliver the annual “Through the Eyes of a Child” conference to Oregon judges who handle dependency cases 

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017):  

JCIP began planning for the 2017 Through the Eyes of a Child conference by consulting with the JCIP Advisory Committee about training topics in December 2016.  By 
February 2017, JCIP had an agenda outlined and speakers confirmed.  JCIP is currently meeting with speakers for various panels regarding the content and method of 
delivery of the presentations.  JCIP is also developing materials for appellate and legislative updates that will be delivered by JCIP staff at the conference. 

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018):  

In August 2017, JCIP delivered the Through the Eyes of a Child conference to 61 judges.  During the conference, JCIP educated judges on appellate and legislative 
changes; in camera review and disclosure of DHS records; the new BIA ICWA Regulations; how to conduct shelter and permanency hearings; the latest research on the 
impact of screen time on children; and how judges and Model Court Teams can use JCIP data reports to improve outcomes.  The conference also provided opportunities 
for judges to convene and discuss specific issues in small groups.  The chart below provides the data regarding the percentage of respondents who agreed or strongly 
agreed with various statements in a post-conference evaluation.

In December 2017, JCIP began working with the JCIP Advisory Committee on proposed focus areas for the 2018 conference.  Over the past six months, JCIP has 
identified topics, secured presenters, and worked on developing content for the conference.

There were sufficient opportunities to

In August 2018, JCIP delivered the Through the Eyes of a Child conference to 65 judges.  During the conference, JCIP educated judges on appellate and legislative 
changes; presented a Dependency 101 training and trainings on Differentiated Case Management, addressing the needs of LGBTQ Children and Youth, engaging the 
incarcerated parent, and ethics for attorneys representing DHS. 81% of those evaluated the conference indicated the conference was useful in performing their work.  A 
combined 75% indicated they have presided over juvenile dependency cases for less than 10 years.  This information will be used to plan future meetings and trainings. 

In August of 2019, JCIP presented the Through the Eyes of a Child conference to 65 judges.  During the conference, JCIP held trainings on Minimally Adequate Parenting, 
Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC), and permanency planning among other trainings.  95% of evaluation respondents indicated that the 
conference was very good or excellent and that the conference was useful in performing their work.  29% of attendees had less than one year of experience presiding 
over juvenile dependency cases.  As we have done in previous years, JCIP will use this data to inform future meetings and trainings. 

Project 2 – Provide updates to juvenile judges on appellate decisions and changes to state and federal dependency law   

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017) 

JCIP’s Juvenile Law and Policy Counsel provides regular appellate updates to juvenile judges statewide, and maintains and distributes a cumulative case law outline that 
catalogs the holdings by subject matter.  JCIP also continues to monitor state and federal legislative changes that impact juvenile dependency practice.  At the 
conclusion of the legislative session in June or July of 2017, a summary of those changes will be provided to dependency judges.

Year 3 (July 2018 through June 2019) 

Year 4 (July 2019 through June 2020) 

JCIP continues to prepare updates for judges regarding changes to juvenile law.  This includes summaries of Oregon appellate opinions and maintenance of a 
comprehensive searchable case law outline with links to cases and a table of contents.  JCIP also provides regular legislative updates to juvenile judges through various 
formats.  For the 2019 session, an update was provided at the Through the Eyes of a Child Conference and by webinar.  JCIP also provides updates between conferences 
through memos and an annual legislative report.  Attached below is the most recent copy of the case law update.

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017) 

roject 3 – Increase the knowledge of Oregon’s appellate judges about the practical aspects of handling juvenile dependency cases at the trial level   

JCIP organized and delivered a half day presentation to Oregon Court of Appeals judges, Supreme Court Justices and their staff in February about the practical aspects 
of handling juvenile dependency cases.  With about 50 judges, justices and staff in attendance, the seminar provided additional context to appellate courts as to what 
happens in the juvenile court both before and after cases go up on appeal.  We also provided information to appellate judges about observation opportunities at the 
trial court level.  The results of the post seminar evaluation were very positive, with all of those responding to the survey agreeing or strongly agreeing that the seminar 
increased their understanding of practical issues in juvenile dependency cases.  

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018) 

Over this reporting period, JCIP conducted outreach with appellate judges regarding opportunities for observation in juvenile court.  JCIP also extended invitations to 
appellate judges to attend the Through the Eyes of a Child Conference in August, and currently has several appellate judges registered to attend.  JCIP will be exploring 
potential topics for its February 2019 program for appellate judges over the next several months.

  P

 

Year 3 (July 2018 through June 2019) 

During the second half of 2018, JCIP worked with two Oregon Court of Appeals judges and their staff to develop an agenda for a half day program dedicated to 
providing the trial court perspective to appellate judges in Oregon.  Since our focus for the first seminar (in 2017) was on the trial judge perspective, we decided to shift 
and highlight the attorney and child perspectives.   

JCIP recruited several of the state’s most accomplished dependency attorneys, including representatives from the Department of Justice and the defense bar to 
present: (1) how the Oregon State Bar Performance Standards impact what judges see on appeal, and (2) critical legal decision making in dependency cases.  We also 
invited a panel of foster youth, Oregon’s Foster Care Ombudsman and a child’s attorney to talk about some of the challenges facing kids in the foster care system.  
Finally, JCIP staff presented on the Family First Prevention Services Act and other emerging issues in juvenile law. 

Seminar evaluations showed that 73 to 93 percent of attendees experienced an increase in knowledge regarding the practical issues in dependency cases for each 
panel.   

Year 4 (July 2019 through June 2020) 

JCIP continues to encourage appellate judges to attend the Through the Eyes of a Child Conference to help facilitate the exchange of perspectives between appellate 
and trial judges.  For the 2020 conference, JCIP has recruited two appellate and one trial judge to deliver the Appellate Update.  We anticipate the dialogue that is 
created will continue to bridge understanding among the appellate judges of the practical issues that arise in dependency cases.

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017):  

JCIP planned and delivered a training in April 2017 in collaboration with the Judicial Engagement and Leadership Institute (JELI).  The training topics were chosen based 
on a survey of juvenile court judges conducted in August 2016, and feedback received from the JCIP advisory and JELI executive committees.  Approximately 30 judges 
attended, and feedback on attendee evaluations was positive, with respondents particularly reporting that the panel of appellate judges had increased their 
understanding of what the Court of Appeals considers when cases are heard on appeal.   

This project was not a focus for this reporting period.  JCIP has scheduled a meeting in September 2018 to begin planning the 2019 JELI Convening.   

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018): 

Year 3 (July 2018 through June 2019) 

The JELI (Judicial Education and Leadership Institute) Spring Convening: Focus on Hearing Quality was presented in April of 2019.  30 judges and 6 referees attended 
the conference and the topics included the following:  Making an Adequate Record, What Evidence Should the Court Consider? Caseflow and Time Management, a 
Judicial Timelines Refresher and data presentation. 

Year 4 (July 2019 through June 2020)

This project was not a focus for this reporting period. JCIP will plan a JELI Convening in 2021.  

Project 5 – Plan and deliver biennial Mini-Child Abuse and Neglect Institute (mini-CANI) for new juvenile judges 

Project 5 has been newly added to the JCIP Strategic Plan as part of JCIP’s plan for using the training grant.  Planning for the Mini-CANI will begin in fall 2017, with the 
Mini-CANI taking place in the first half of 2018. 

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017):  

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018):  

JCIP planned and delivered a two-day Mini-Child Abuse and Neglect Institute for new juvenile judges in January of 2018. Nine new judges attended.  The program 
focused on the nuts and bolts of holding hearings, and also provided sessions on entry into foster care, ICWA, Trauma Informed Care, and Case Management.  Judge-
presenters from courts around the state provided practical insights to handling each hearing.  Five out of six judges responding to our post institute survey agreed or 
strongly agreed with the statement that “the information presented will be useful in my day to day work.” 

This event occurs every other year and did not occur in 2019.

The 2-day Mini CANI occurred in January 2020.  We had 19 judges participate, our largest group of new juvenile court judges.  A Sitting juvenile court judge who is the 
chair of our JCIP Advisory Committee served as faculty with a Sr. Judge who retired at the end of the 2019.  A copy of the agenda is attached below.  The program was 
well received and provided judges with opportunities to discuss hearings in depth.  The highlight of the event this year was the parent panel that included three parent 
mentors who were involved in the dependency system and now work as mentors to parents with children in foster care.  They were able to share their own stories and 
success as well as describe the challenges current parents have with judges and court proceedings.

Project 6 – Develop and disseminate Oregon-specific child sex trafficking bench card 

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017):  

Not applicable - this is a new project added in June 2018.  

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018):  

In 2017, Multnomah County judges received technical assistance from the National Council of Juvenile Court Judges to examine how they could better respond to 
victims of sex trafficking.  During that process, Multnomah County identified a need for an Oregon-specific bench card that provides information about how to identify 
and respond to victims of sex trafficking that may appear in court.  They asked for a bench card that incorporates Oregon-specific information regarding applicable laws 
and resources.  In 2018, JCIP agreed to collaborate with the CSEC Coordinator at the Oregon DOJ and the DOJ statewide Trafficking Intervention Advisory Committee to 
develop the bench card. 

A team to create a bench card has been establish by working with the DOJ statewide Trafficking Intervention Advisory Committee.  At the recent (April 2019) JELI 
conference judges were asked to provide written feedback regarding what they would like to see in a bench card.  Now that we have that information, we have set a 
meeting to draft the bench card.  

Year 3 (July 2018 through June 2019) 

Year 4 (July 2019 through June 2020) 

JCIP, in collaboration with system partners, drafted a child sex trafficking bench card for Oregon judges that is Oregon-specific. The draft bench card went through 
several revisions as it was shared with system partners and others. It is in the final phase of revisions. JCIP hopes to distribute the bench card by September 1, 2020.  

Project 7 – Improve judicial handling of cases involving incarcerated parents  

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017):  

Not applicable – this is a new project added in June 2018.  

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018):  

Over the past several years, there have been several appellate reversals of trial court findings that DHS made reasonable efforts when a parent was incarcerated.  The 
underlying facts usually involved an incarcerated parent who was interested in having visitation and participating in services and a caseworker who does little to have 
contact with the parent, evaluate available services, and arrange for visitation.  JELI formed a work group to examine this problem in 2018.   

In the spring of 2018, JCIP staff has provided assistance to the JELI Incarcerated Parents Work Group to plan and deliver a session at the Through the Eyes of a Child 
Conference on how courts should evaluate reasonable efforts when a parent is incarcerated.  Over this same time period, JCIP staff also worked with the JELI

Incarcerated Parents Work Group, Dr. Marty Beyer, DHS, and DOC on a session at the Model Court Summit devoted to the topic of the appropriateness of visitation 
when a parent is incarcerated. 

JCIP staff and a judge who serves on the JELI Incarcerated Parents Work Group will also serve on the Children of Incarcerated Parents Implementation Team.  The team, 
consisting of representatives from the DHS, the DOC, and other related entities that serve incarcerated parents, will be working on implementation of SB 241 (2017), 
which established the Oregon Children of Incarcerated Parents Bill of Rights.  The new law requires DOC to develop guidelines for policy and procedure decisions using 
the rights outlined in the bill, including the right to be heard and respected by decision makers when decisions are made about the child; to speak with, see, and touch 
the incarcerated parent; and to have a lifelong relationship with the incarcerated parent.  The Governor’s Office is currently assembling the team and scheduling a first 
meeting. 

JCIP Staff and a juvenile court judge participated in this workgroup.  The group included nearly 20 stakeholders and former incarcerated parents.  JCIP primarily 
explained court programs, processes, and services.   

Year 3 

Year 4 

JCIP staff participated in the Children of Incarcerated Parents Bill of Rights Implementation Team that met in 2019.  Since the 2020 Legislative Session 
concluded with no bills passing, we anticipate that some of these ideas may be considered in the 2021 session.  The Team submitted the following 
recommendations to the Governor’s Reentry Council in December 2019: 

• 

Implement the use of Family Impact Statements in sentencing- recommend that OJD develop a form that includes check boxes and space for 
additional narrative to efficiently provide judges with relevant info, have the FIS compiled by the defense counsel during the initial settlement 
conference. Requesting additional funding for public defenders to handle increased workload and legislation directing the use of FIS. 

•  Rethink long-term parent/child consequences of neglect and endangerment charges- a record of these charges places many barriers between 
healthy parent/child reunification, including visits, parole and probation conditions, DHS reunification, access to public school events, etc.  
•  Educate and engage school counselors and social workers- in 2020, in partnership with Oregon Dept of Education, we will acquire and adapt the 

training on children of incarcerated parents developed by the San Francisco Unified School District to deliver this training to school counselors and 
social workers through their continuing education programs.  

•  Create pre- and post-partum best practices for incarcerated mothers- create a best practice guide and resource collaboration through DOC to then 

be used in county jails as well.  

incarcerated men are fathers.  

•  Establish a parenting contact plan for every parent entering DOC custody- DOC estimated that 85% of incarcerated women are mothers and 60% of 

•  Expand the Family Sentencing Alternative Program- currently five counties participate in the FSAAP, which was established by HB 3503 (2015): 

Deschutes, Jackson, Marion, Multnomah, Washington. Since the inception of the program, 168 individuals have participated and together are the 
primary caregivers of 311 children who would otherwise likely be involved in the foster care system. DHS completed a progress report on FSAPP in 
2018, and found that children of parents involved in FSAPP have a shorter average length of stay in foster care (577 days) than the statewide average 
(677 days). Comparatively, a child with incarcerated parent will spend an estimated 1066 days in care.

Project 8 – Conduct tribal-court/state court visits to the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation and the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and 
Siuslaw Indians.  

Not applicable - this project had been included in prior strategic plans, but was not included in the FY2017 strategic plan, in part due to the loss of the training grant. 

This is a new item added to JCIP’s strategic plan.  In the previous grant cycle, JCIP coordinated visits of circuit court judges and staff to five of Oregon’s nine federally 
recognized Tribes.  Previous site visits by judges to Oregon Tribes were successful and tribes and judges are now asking for additional visits.    JCIP will begin planning for 
visits to the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation and the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians in fall 2018. 

 

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017):  

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018):  

Year 3 (July 2018 through June 2019) 

This project is scheduled to begin 12/2019. 

Year 4 (July 2019 through June 2020) 

A Tribal visit to the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation occurred in November 2019. The purpose of the visit was for cross cultural 
education and understanding and for developing and strengthening relationships between state and tribal courts.  We believe this work is very 
important to the safe and equitable reduction of Native American children in the child welfare system. The Coos, Lower Umpqua, Siuslaw Tribe decided 
not to host a visit. 

Project 9 – Support judicial participation at national trainings and conferences.  

Year 1 (December 2016 through June 2017):  

Not applicable - this project not included in the FY2017 strategic plan due to loss of the training grant, but was reincorporated in June 2017 contingent on restoration 
training grant funds.    

Year 2 (July 2017 through June 2018):  

This Project has been added back into JCIP’s strategic plan after JCIP stopped support judicial participation in national trainings and conferences after the Training Grant 
was not renewed.  JCIP plans on planning to provide financial support to juvenile court judges in attending the following conferences:  (1) the Annual NCJFCJ Conference 
in July 2018, and (2) the National Judicial Institute on Domestic Child Sex Trafficking in August, 2018.
