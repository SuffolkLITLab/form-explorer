Safety Focused Parenting Plan

Do you need a Safety Focused Plan?  This list can help you decide.

Has the other parent:

acted as though violent behavior toward you or your child(ren) is OK in
some situations?

damaged or destroyed property or pets during an argument?

threatened to commit suicide?

pushed, slapped, kicked, punched or physically hurt you or your child(ren)?

had problems with alcohol or other drugs?

needed medication to be safe around others?

threatened not to return or not returned your child(ren)?

used weapons to threaten or hurt people?

threatened to kill you, your child(ren) or anyone else?

sexually abused anyone by force, threat of force, or intimidation?

been served a protection or no contact order?

been arrested for harming or threatening to harm you or anyone else?

<

<

<

<

<

<

<

If you answered yes to any of these questions, please continue to take your safety, and
your children’s safety, seriously.  You may need to use  a Safety Focused Parenting Plan.

Oregon law requires parents to file a Parenting Plan (a document that states when the child will
be with each parent and how decisions will be made) with the final request for divorce or child
custody order.  Parenting Plans may be modified by agreement of the parties (see the paragraph
entitled “Changes to the Parenting Plan”) or by returning to court seeking a modification.  The
purpose of these materials is to help you develop a safety focused parenting plan.  We recommend
that you file a plan when first filing your case in the court.  This packet offers three samples of
safety focused parenting plans: 

Option A:  You feel your child cannot be safe alone with the other parent - supervised
parenting time or no parenting time.

Option B: You feel your child can safely spend limited time with the other parent under
certain conditions - no overnight parenting time.

Option C: You feel your child can safely spend time with the other parent, but you are
not safe when the other parent is with you - overnight parenting time, public drop off and
pick up sites.

These instructions are not a complete statement of the law.  For legal information, please talk to
a lawyer, visit your local law library and/or refer to the “Resource List” in the Parenting Plan Guide
for Parents developed by the Oregon Judicial Department (http://www.ojd.state.or.us/familylaw).
Your court may also have local rules, programs and procedures that are not explained in these
instructions. Some courts have family law facilitators and/or clerks who may provide
you with further assistance.

child(ren), the specific parenting time may be stopped (check all safety rules that apply):

The non-residential parent shall not be under the influence of alcohol or a controlled

healthcare (including medical and dental care), and religious training. The residential parent can make each
of these decisions on the children’s behalf without notice or input from the non-residential parent.

residential parent shall provide care for the children only while they are staying with him or her and will
make only emergency medical or dental decisions on the children’s behalf.  The non-residential parent's
right to make reasonable decisions regarding a child's care while the child is with him or her does not

etc.) unless the residential parent has agreed in advance, in writing, dated and signed. 

4.3

Child Safety.  It is the duty of both parents to keep the children safe.

Each parent shall protect the children in the following ways: 

•

•

Not use illegal drugs at any time or abuse alcohol while the children are present.

Not allow the children to ride in a car unless the driver has a valid driver’s license,
auto insurance, seat belts and child safety seats as required by Oregon law.

The children must be given medication as directed. This means the right amount and
at the right time.  The children must have the medication when parenting time starts
and it must be returned with the children at the end of parenting time.

The nonresidential parent shall follow the safety rules checked below.  If the nonresidential
parent  violates  any  of  the  rules  below,  the  residential  parent  may  seek  the  court’s  help
through a contempt action.  In addition, if the violation poses an immediate threat to the
child(ren), the specific parenting time may be stopped (check all safety rules that apply):

The non-residential parent shall not be under the influence of alcohol or a controlled
substance (e.g., drugs) during any period of time that he or she is to be with the
children. 

The non-residential parent shall not consume alcoholic beverages beginning 12 hours
before the children arrive up to the point they are returned to the residential parent.

5.
Changes to the Parenting Plan.  A specific parenting time may be denied due to the safety concerns
listed in Paragraph 4.3.  Changes to the parenting plan are allowed whenever both parents agree to a change.
Agreed upon changes will be temporary and will be enforced by the court only if the change is written
down, is dated, signed by both parents before a notary public and submitted to the court leaving a space for
the judge’s signature.  See ORS 107.174.

This is part of a Court Order when attached to a signed Judgment. Each party has been put on
6.
notice that an intentional failure to follow the rules of this parenting plan is punishable through the contempt
powers of the court.  One parent's failure to comply with the rules does not excuse the other party from
following the rules.

WORDS I NEED TO KNOW

WORDS I NEED TO KNOW1

Court Order.  Any order made by a judge; the order may be written by the judge or
submitted by a party or attorney and signed by the judge.  The parties may agree to a
plan and, when the judge signs it, it becomes a court order or Judgment.  See also
Stipulation.

Custody.  In Oregon, “custody” means the right to make major decisions for the welfare
of a child.  Major decisions include routine medical care, religion, education and
residence.  Custody may be either joint with both parents or sole with one parent.  “Sole
custody” does not give one parent the right to move away with the child without notice to
the other parent unless the order specifically gives that right.  Having custody does not
necessarily mean having the child live with you (see also Parenting Time).  See also
Regular, Split, and Shared Custody for child support terms.

Dissolution of Marriage.  Divorce.

Divorce.  The legal process of dissolving a marriage;  where parents have not been
married, they can file a petition for custody (or filiation petition) to obtain orders for
custody and a parenting plan.

Domestic Violence.  A learned pattern of physical, verbal, sexual, and/or emotional
behavior in which one person in a relationship uses force, fear and intimidation to
dominate or control the other person, often with the threat or use of violence.  Domestic
violence is a crime.

Facilitator, Family Law Facilitator.  A court employee who helps parents without
attorneys by providing assistance with common family law forms and giving information
about court procedures and other sources of help in their communities. 

Family Abuse Prevention Act (F.A.P.A.).  The law that authorizes courts to issue
protective orders (a special type of restraining order) where there has been violence or
other forms of abuse within a family.  F.A.P.A. orders may include orders for custody
and a parenting plan.

Filing.  Turning your legal papers into the clerk of the court.

1This is not a list of legal definitions but have been prepared for use by persons

who are not lawyers.

Page 1 of 3 - WORDS I NEED TO KNOW (SFPPG) [Rev 6/03]

Hearing.  A motion or other legal action that is handled in the courtroom. Parties and
attorneys may call witnesses and introduce evidence.  A judge will make a decision
based on all the evidence and the decision will become a court order.

Holiday.  Each family has certain holidays and special occasions that it celebrates.  A
parenting plan would specify who the child will spend holidays with and define each
holiday so both parents know when it begins and when it ends.

Joint Custody.  Parents share the responsibility to make major decisions for their child

(see also Custody).  Joint custody does not mean that the child spends equal
time with each parent.  Both parents have to agree for joint custody to be
ordered.  See also Parenting Time.

Judgment.  See Court Order.

Mediation.  A meeting with a trained, neutral third party who helps the parties try to
solve problems cooperatively.  Most courts provide mediation of custody and parenting
plan problems up to a certain number of hours.  Mediation may occur face to face or
separately, if necessary.  Mediation is confidential.  The mediator does not tell the
parents what they should do or make a recommendation to the court.  Mediation may
not be appropriate where there are safety issues or domestic violence concerns. 

Motion.  A formal request filed with the court.  A judge makes a decision to allow or

deny the request, usually after a hearing or trial.

Non-residential Parent.  The non-residential parent is the parent with whom the
children do not live most of the time and who does not have legal custody of them.

Order.  See Court Order.

Parenting Plan.  A document that states when the child will be with each parent and

how decisions will be made.  The parenting plan may be developed by the
parents, through mediation, with the help of attorneys or by a judge after a trial or
hearing.  See also Custody.

Parenting Time.  The actual time a child is scheduled to spend with a parent.  During

parenting time that parent has primary responsibility for making routine decisions
for the child but not major decisions.  See also Custody.

Petition for Custody.  If parents have never been married, instead of filing a

dissolution of marriage (divorce) they file a petition for custody (or filiation
petition) in order to get court orders for custody and a parenting plan.

Physical Custody.  See Custody and Parenting Time.

Pro Se.  Filing legal papers by yourself, without a lawyer. It can also mean appearing in

court in front of a judge by yourself, without a lawyer.

Page 2 of 3 - WORDS I NEED TO KNOW (SFPPG) [Rev 6/03]

Residential Parent.  The residential parent is the parent with whom the children live
most of the time and who has legal custody of them.

Restraining Order.  See F.A.P.A.

Safety Focused Parenting Plan.  A parenting plan specially created for families where

there is mental illness, drug addiction, domestic violence, child abuse, or other
circumstances that impact safety of the child or a parent.  The Oregon Judicial
Department and State Family Law Advisory Committee are currently developing
such a plan.  If you determine that your situation requires a safety-focused
parenting plan, you should consult with an attorney.

Self-Represented.  An individual who files a court case without using the services of an

attorney.  See also Pro Se.

Sole Custody.  One parent has the right and responsibility to make major decisions for

the welfare of the child.  See also Custody.

Statute.  Laws passed by the state legislature (or adopted by initiative).  Most code
sections relating to family law are in volumes 25, 107 and 109 of the Oregon 
Revised Statutes (O.R.S.) and are available at the county law library or on the 
internet at www.leg.state.or.us/ors.

Supervised Parenting Time.  Parenting time during which the parent and child must be

in the presence of another specified adult while the parent visits.  Supervised
visitation may be ordered where there has been domestic violence, child abuse
or a threat to take the child out of the state.  The third party is responsible for
making sure that the child is safe and the rules are followed.  Sometimes
supervision can be arranged and paid for through an agency or provider.  Often,
a trusted family member or friend will agree to take on the responsibility.  Either
way, both the parents and the supervisor need to be informed about the
requirements, the expectations and what to do in the event of an emergency or if
the visit must be ended.  Some courts have guidelines for supervised visits.  Ask
your local court clerk or facilitator. 

Trial.  See Hearing. 

Visitation.  Term no longer preferred.  See Parenting Plan, Parenting Time.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
