      <pre>REQUEST FOR ALTERNATE SERVICE METHOD 

If you are not able to serve another party using any of the methods listed in Oregon Rules of 
Civil Procedure (ORCP) Rule 7D(2)1, you can ask the court to allow you to serve by another 
method. You will have to explain why you cannot use any of the ORCP 7D(2) service options and 
why your request is reasonably likely to let the other party know about the case.  

Other service methods include publication in a newspaper of general circulation, email or social 
media posting, and text message or fax. Any alternative service method must be the most 
reasonably likely way to inform the other party of the action. If there is another way you think 
you can notify the other party, specify your request in the “other” sections.  

You will also have to explain what you have done to try to find the other party. Some common 
efforts include contacting the party’s employer, friends, and family, searching public utility and 
court records, the DMV or post office, and the internet.  

STEP 1: FILLING OUT THE FORMS 

Fill out the Ex Parte Motion for Alternative Service & Declaration in Support. Specify how you 
intend to serve the other party and why you believe your request is likely to advise the party of 
the case.  

 Parties & Case Number – the parties and the case number are the same as they are

on your filing papers

Make copies for your records 

STEP 2: FILE YOUR FORMS 

File the original Motion & Declaration with the court clerk where you filed your case. Courts 
handle these matters differently. You may be scheduled for an appearance, or you may have to 
file and appear at a certain time scheduled for all “ex parte” matters. Ask the clerk at your court 
how to proceed. Filing this motion is free. 

STEP 3: SERVICE 

If the court grants your motion, read the Order carefully. The judge may have made changes to 
your request or ordered additional actions. If you fail to follow the judge’s orders, you risk the 
court dismissing your case. If your case is dismissed for failure to serve and you want to refile, 
you may need to pay your case filing fees again.  

Publication: You can take or send the Summons for Service by Publication to the approved 
newspaper. You do not need to publish the other documents you filed. Your Summons must 
include a summary of the case and the relief you are asking the court to order. If the court orders 
mailing in addition to publication, you must mail the Summons and other filed documents both 
by first class mail and by certified mail, return receipt requested.  

1 In person, by residential or office service, or by certified mail, return receipt requested 

Instructions – Alternative Service 
Page 1 of 2 

OJD OFFICIAL 
(Feb 2022) 

For any other method of service, you must be able to show the court that you successfully 
completed the requirements. For electronic service methods, this can mean a screenshot of the 
email, share, or text message, especially if it shows that the other party actually opened or 
viewed the message. For faxes, keep the confirmation page. 

STEP 4: PROOF OF SERVICE 

An original proof of service must be filed with the court in all cases 

 For publication - you must file the Declaration of Publication completed by a

representative of the newspaper that published your Summons. You only need to file a
Certificate of Alternative Service if the court also ordered you to mail copies. If so, you
must file both a Declaration of Publication and a Certificate of Alternative Service.

 For electronic methods (email, text message, social media, fax, etc.) – complete and

file a Certificate of Alternative Service. You can include screenshots or images.
o The receiver must be able to open and read true copies of the documents
o If you later learn that the other party did not personally receive the message, you
must file an amended Certificate of Alternative Service to let the court know

 For any other method - complete and file a Certificate of Alternative Service

After you file your proof of service, refer to your original instruction document for the next steps 
in your case

Documents will also be mailed by first class mail and by certified mail, return receipt requested, 
to the party’s current address (or the last known address if current address is not known)  

 No address is available for mailing and no address can reasonably be discovered. I ask 

the court to waive the mailing requirement. 

Statement of Points and Authorities 
Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure (ORCP) Rule 7D(6) allows a court to order alternative methods 
of service if service cannot be made by any other method specified by rule or statute. Service 
may be made by any method or combination of methods most reasonably calculated to advise 
the recipient of the action.  

Declaration 

I have made the following efforts to locate the other party (explain who you contacted or steps 

taken to locate the other party or find a valid contact address):  

 

Service cannot be made in person, at the other party’s residence or office, or by mail1, because: 

(Explain why you cannot serve by these methods and the efforts you have made):  

I believe the requested method of alternative service is the most reasonably likely to advise the 

recipient of the action because:  

For electronic service: I believe the other party has recently sent and received messages from 

this email address, text message or fax line, or social media account because:
