      <pre>Oregon Judicial Branch  
Strategic Campaign  

ovember 2021 Report and Renewal for 2022 

 message from Chief Justice Martha L. Walters  

The mission of Oregon’s Judicial Branch is to provide fair and 
accessible justice services that protect the rights of individuals, 
preserve community welfare, and inspire public confidence.  We 
keep that mission in the fore in all we do.  But that alone is not 
enough.   

It is essential that we take a systematic and intentional approach to 
advance that mission.  To do that, we adopted our Strategic 
Campaign 2020-2021, a two-year plan for the courts.  We made four 
commitments to the people of Oregon and undertook 19 initiatives 
to fulfill them.  That two-year plan allowed us to focus on the actions 
that we identified as most critical to advance our mission, while also 
providing flexibility should it be necessary to respond to emerging 

issues.  We were fortunate that it did.  Just after we adopted our Strategic Campaign, the 
COVID-19 pandemic hit, and we had to determine how to continue to provide justice services 
and do so safely.  We had to adjust our operations and our expectations, but I am proud to 
report that our focus and flexibility has allowed us to do more than keep our courts open.  As 
the following summary demonstrates, we have been able to achieve or make significant 
progress on many of our commitments and initiatives.    

It will, however, take additional time to complete our work, and we have decided to continue 
our Strategic Campaign, with renewed commitment and updated initiatives, for an additional 
year.  The following summary includes our plans for 2022.  During that year, we will expand 
our planning process to develop the next full two-year Strategic Campaign for 2023-2024.   

By rededicating ourselves to the commitments we have made and setting out the new or 
continuing initiatives that we will undertake to put those commitments into action, and by 
working collaboratively within the state courts, with the legislative and executive branches, 
and with community partners across the state, we will be well-positioned to address critical 
challenges, increase public trust and confidence in our courts, and improve justice services for 
all.  Thank you for your efforts to those ends.

Strategic Campaign Commitments 
2020-2022 

The Oregon Judicial Department renews these four commitments to the people of Oregon 

We will join with community partners to improve services 
and outcomes for people who are underserved, vulnerable, 
or marginalized; and we will develop effective, supportive, 
and creative solutions to respond to their legal needs. 
 

We will improve access to justice by eliminating barriers; 
continuing to simplify and streamline our processes and 
forms; enhancing service options; leveraging technology; 
improving interpreter services; and advocating for 
resources to keep courts open, safe, and secure. 

We will enhance the public’s trust and confidence in 
Oregon’s state government, including the judicial branch, 
by listening and responding to the needs of those we serve; 
holding ourselves to high standards; and communicating 
the role of our courts in providing justice for all. 

 

Commitment 1 

Commitment 2 

Commitment 3 

Commitment 4 

 

 

We will create a workplace and courthouse culture that is 
supportive, inclusive, welcoming, and affirming; that 
embraces diversity; and where all people can thrive and are 
treated with respect and dignity.
