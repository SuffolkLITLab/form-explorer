      <pre>onsult a family lawyer who works with immigrants 
to discuss how any of these family law options may 
affect or assist you. 

nder U.S. law any crime victim, regardless of 

immigration or citizenship status, can call the police 
for help or obtain a protection order. 
  
Call police at 911 if you or your child(ren) are in 
danger.  The police may arrest your fiancé(e), spouse, 
partner, or another person if they believe that person 
has committed a crime.  You should tell the police 
about any abuse that has happened, even in the past, 
and show any injuries.   Anyone, regardless of 
immigration or citizenship status, may report a crime.  

ikewise, if you are a victim of domestic violence 
you can apply to a court for a protection order. A 
court-issued protection order or restraining order may 
prohibit your abuser from calling, contacting, 
approaching, or harming you, your child(ren), or 
other family members.  If your abuser violates the 
protection order, you can contact the police, who may 
arrest the abuser.  Applications for protection orders 
are available at most courthouses, police stations, 
women’s shelters, and legal service offices.   

f your abuser accuses you of a crime, you have basic 
rights, regardless of your immigration or citizenship 
status, including: the right to talk to a lawyer; the 
right to not answer questions without a lawyer 
present; the right to speak in your defense.  It is 
important to talk with both an immigration lawyer 
and a criminal lawyer.   

hat services are available to victims of domestic 

violence and sexual assault in the United States? 
In the United States, victims of crime, regardless of 
immigration or citizenship status, can access help 
provided by government or nongovernmental 
agencies, which may include counseling, interpreters, 
emergency housing, and even monetary assistance.

omestic violence may include sexual assault, child 
abuse, and other violent crimes.  Sexual assault is any 
type of sexual activity that you do not agree to, even 
with your spouse, and can be committed by anyone. 
Child abuse includes: physical abuse (any injury that 
does not happen by accident, including excessive 
punishment), physical neglect (failure to provide 
food, shelter, medical care or supervision), sexual 
abuse, and emotional abuse (threats, withholding 
love, support or guidance). 
  
Under all circumstances, domestic violence, sexual 
assault, and child abuse are illegal in the United 
States.  All people in the United States (regardless of 
race, color, religion, sex, age, ethnicity, or 
immigration status) are guaranteed protection from 
abuse under the law. Any victim of domestic violence 
– regardless of immigration or citizenship status – 
can seek help.  An immigrant victim of domestic 
violence may be eligible for immigration protections.   

f you are experiencing domestic violence in your 
home, you are not alone.  This pamphlet is intended 
to help you understand U.S. laws and know how to 
get help if you need it. 
   
What are the legal rights for victims of domestic 
violence in the United States? 
All people in the United States, regardless of 
immigration or citizenship status, are guaranteed 
basic protections under both civil and criminal law.  
Laws governing families provide you with: 

•  The right to obtain a protection order for you 

and your child(ren). 

•  The right to legal separation or divorce 
without the consent of your spouse. 

•  The right to share certain marital property.  

In cases of divorce, the court will divide any 
property or financial assets you and your 
spouse have together. 

•  The right to ask for custody of your 

child(ren) and financial support.  Parents of

Information on the  
Legal Rights Available to 
Immigrant Victims of 
Domestic Violence in the 
United States and 
Facts about Immigrating 
on a Marriage-Based Visa 

urpose: 

Immigrants are particularly vulnerable because many 
do not speak English, are often separated from family 
and friends, and may not understand the laws of the 
United States.  For these reasons, immigrants are 
often afraid to report acts of domestic violence to the 
police or to seek other forms of assistance.  Such fear 
causes many immigrants to remain in abusive 
relationships.   

his pamphlet will explain domestic violence and 
inform you of your legal rights in the United States. 
The International Marriage Broker Regulation Act 
(IMBRA) requires that the U.S. Government provide 
foreign fiancé(e)s and spouses immigrating to the 
United States information about their legal rights as 
well as criminal or domestic violence histories of 
their U.S. citizen fiancé(e)s and spouses.  One of 
IMBRA’s goals is to provide accurate information to 
immigrating fiancé(e)s and spouses about the 
immigration process and how to access help if their 
relationship becomes abusive. 

hat is domestic violence? 

  W

Domestic violence is a pattern of behavior when one 
intimate partner or spouse threatens or abuses the 
other partner.  Abuse may include physical harm, 
forced sexual relations, emotional manipulation 
(including isolation or intimidation), economic and/or 
immigration related threats.  While most recorded

residence (green card) and will need to file an 
Application to Register Permanent Residence or 
Adjust Status (Form I-485).   

ll other marriage-based immigration status holders 

should refer to the information given to them from 
the U.S. consulate.  Additional information may be 
found online at http://www.uscis.gov .  

hat are the penalties for marriage fraud? 
Immigrants who commit marriage fraud may be 
subject to removal proceedings and may be barred 
from receiving future immigration benefits in the 
United States. Conviction for marriage fraud can 
involve imprisonment for up to five (5) years and 
fines up to $250,000 (U.S. currency).   

f I am married to a U.S. citizen who filed 
immigration papers on my behalf, what is my 
immigration status?  
If you have been married less than 2 years when your 
Form I-485 is approved, you will receive conditional 
residence status from USCIS.  Ninety (90) days 
before the second anniversary of your conditional 
residence, you and your spouse generally must apply 
together to remove the conditions on your lawful 
residence.  To do so, you must prove the marriage is 
in “good faith” and valid.  Once the conditions are 
removed, you have permanent residency that is not 
dependent on your U.S. spouse. 

f you have been married more than 2 years when 
your Form I-485 is approved, you will receive 
permanent residence status from USCIS.  On that 
date you will no longer be dependent on your U.S. 
citizen spouse for immigration status.  

here are three situations when the law allows 

conditional residents the option to request a waiver of 
the requirement that you and your spouse file jointly 
to request removal of the conditions. 1) The removal 
of the conditional resident from the U.S. would result 
in extreme hardship; OR 2) The marriage was legally 
terminated, other than by death, and the applicant 
was not at fault for failing to file a timely application 
to remove the conditional basis of his or her status;

hese immigration benefits each have specific 
requirements that must be established.  Consult an 
immigration lawyer who works with victims of 
domestic violence to discuss how any of these 
immigration benefits may affect or assist you. 

ow does the marriage-based immigration 

process work?  
The marriage-based immigration process involves 
several steps to obtain legal immigration status in the 
United States, and over time, to be eligible for 
citizenship.  These steps depend on the type of 
marriage-based visa you travel on to the United 
States, as well as other factors.  The following 
information is an overview of some of these types of 
visas, as well as information on your legal rights.  

-1 nonimmigrant status (as the fiancé(e) of a United 

States citizen):  You are required to either marry the 
United States citizen within 90 days of entry or to 
depart the United States.  Following your marriage to 
the U.S. citizen fiancé(e) who petitioned for you, you 
must file an Application to Register Permanent 
Residence or Adjust Status (Form I-485).  If your 
Form I-485 is approved, your status will be adjusted 
from a K nonimmigrant to that of a conditional 
permanent resident.  You will have that conditional 
status for two years.   

f you remain in the U.S. without marrying the U.S. 
citizen who sponsored your K-1 visa, or marry 
someone else, you will violate the terms of your visa, 
have no legal status, and may be subject to removal 
proceedings or other penalties.  

-3 nonimmigrant status (as the spouse of a United 
States citizen):  You are allowed to enter the United 
States temporarily while waiting for approval of a 
family-based visa petition (I-130).  Once the I-130 is 
approved, you are entitled to lawful permanent

an I rely on the criminal background 

information on my U.S. citizen fiancée or spouse? 
The criminal background information compiled by 
the agency comes from various public sources, as 
well as information provided by the U.S. citizen 
clients on immigration applications.  USCIS does not 
have access to all criminal history databases in the 
United States.  The U.S. citizen sponsor may not tell 
the truth in the sponsorship application.  It is also 
possible the U.S. citizen has a history of abusive 
behavior but was never arrested or convicted.  
Therefore, the criminal background information you 
receive may not be complete.  The intent of IMBRA 
is to provide available information and resources to 
immigrating fiancé(s) and spouses. Ultimately you 
are responsible for deciding whether you feel safe in 
the relationship.   

an foreign fiancées or spouses who are victims of 

domestic violence also be victims of human 
trafficking? 
Other forms of exploitation including human 
trafficking can sometimes occur alongside domestic 
violence, when the exploitation involves compelled 
or coerced labor, services, or commercial sex acts.

OR 3) During the marriage the U.S. citizen or lawful 
permanent resident spouse subjected the conditional 
resident to battery or extreme cruelty. All three 
waivers are filed on Form I-751 and require you to 
prove your marriage was in “good faith” and not 
fraudulent.  

hat other ways does the U.S. government try to 

inform foreign fiancées and spouses about their 
rights and protect them and their children from 
abuse? 
The International Marriage Broker Regulation Act of 
2005 (IMBRA) is a law in the United States that 
changed the marriage-based immigration process to 
help foreign fiancé(e)s and spouses.  IMBRA 
mandates that the U.S. Government give immigrating 
foreign fiancé(e)s and spouses information and self-
help tools to help protect them against violence from 
the partners who sponsor their visas.  Immigrating 
fiancé(e)s and spouses are often unfamiliar with the 
U.S. laws and unsupported by family or friends to 
escape violence at home.  

MBRA required this pamphlet be written and 
distributed to tell you about laws and services that 
can help you in the United States if you are abused.  
IMBRA prevents U.S. citizens from sponsoring 
multiple visas for foreign fiancé(e)s if they have a 
history of violent crimes. IMBRA requires the U.S. 
government to give foreign fiancé(e)s and spouses of 
U.S. citizens a copy of the criminal background 
check that USCIS does on U.S. citizen-sponsors, as 
well as a copy of the visa sponsorship application.   

ow does the U.S. government regulate 

“International Marriage Brokers”? 
If an agency qualifies as an “international marriage 
broker,” it is required to give you background 
information on the U.S. client who wants to contact 
you, including information contained in Federal and 
State sex offender public registries, and get your 
written permission before giving the U.S. client your 
contact information. The agency is required to give 
you a copy of this pamphlet.  It is prohibited from 
doing business with you if you are under 18 years of 
age.
