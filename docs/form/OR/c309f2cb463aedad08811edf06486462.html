Instructions for Court Interpreter Practice Materials 

The National Center for State Courts (NCSC) has made available materials for court interpretation 
practice and skills-building. These materials include common courtroom documents, as well as 
audio recordings of scripted scenarios, that you can use to practice the three modes of 
interpretation: sight translation (English into your non-English language and your non-English 
language into English); consecutive interpretation, and simultaneous interpretation. 

These practice materials are provided in English only, so that they can be used by interpreters of 
any non-English language. Instructions are provided below on how to use the materials, including 
how to prepare the materials for practice in two languages, i.e., to help you practice interpreting 
from English into your non-English language and from your non-English language into English. We 
encourage you to use these materials for continued development of your court interpreting skills. 

Disclaimer: Please note that these materials are designed to be used for skills-building and practice 
only. They are not designed to be used as a practice examination. 

Practice Materials Provided 

The following court interpreter practice materials are provided (please be sure to download these 
practice materials to properly prepare them for use): 

❑  To practice your interpreting skills in the three modes of interpretation 

•  Practice Script for Sight Translation 1 
•  Practice Script for Sight Translation 2 
•  Practice Audio Files for Consecutive 
•  Practice Audio File for Simultaneous 

❑  To assess your renditions of keywords 

•  Assessment Script for Sight Translation 1 with Keywords 
•  Assessment Script for Sight Translation 2 with Keywords 
•  Assessment Script for Consecutive with Keywords 
•  Assessment Script for Simultaneous with Keywords 

❑  To build a glossary 

•  Glossary Template with Keywords 

Additional Equipment Needed to Work with Practice Materials 

Additional equipment you will need to work with these practice materials is as follows: 

❑  Recording device 
❑  Playback device 
❑  Headphones 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

How to Use the Practice Materials 

Here are a few ways you can use these materials: 

1.  Practice with the Existing Materials: 

The materials provided are in English only. To help you practice interpreting from English into your 
non-English language, you can use the provided materials in the following ways: 

❑  Practice your interpreting and record yourself. Practice interpreting the English practice 
materials into your non-English language, while recording your performance, so you can 
go back and assess your interpretations afterward. As you listen to your practice 
recordings, think about your delivery and the accuracy of your interpretations. You may 
also want to refer to the NCSC’s Common Oral Interpreting Exam Performance Deficiencies 
document to help you identify possible areas for improvement. (Note that you will need to 
use a recording device and a playback device for both the Consecutive and Simultaneous 
interpretation materials. For the Simultaneous interpretation materials, you will also need 
a set of headphones so that you capture only your voice, and not the source audio, while 
recording your performance.) 

❑  Assess your renditions of English keywords. A set of assessment scripts is provided that 
have bolded, underlined English keywords, which represent various features of language. 
As you listen to your practice recordings, assess your renditions of the keywords to help 
you determine whether you are accurately conveying the same meaning, register, and 
grammatical structure of the source message. 

❑  Build a glossary. As you practice, use the glossary template to note the meaning in context, 
as well as possible renditions in your non-English language, for each of the keywords. 
Compile a glossary of terms and phrases in English and your non-English language, as well 
as possible renditions and contextual cues, to help you choose the appropriate rendition at 
the appropriate time. 

2.  Prepare the Materials for Practice in Two Languages: 

To help you practice interpreting from English into your non-English language and from your non- 
English language into English, take a few minutes to prepare the provided materials in the 
following ways: 

❑  Translate one (or both) of the Practice Scripts for Sight Translation into your non- 

English language. Using your non-English Practice Script, make a separate 
Assessment Script and underline the keywords (or their equivalent in your non- 
English language) in it. After you have translated the document in writing, you can use 
the Practice Script to practice sight translating into English and you can use the 
Assessment Script to assess your renditions of the keywords. 

❑  Translate the “Answer” portions of the Assessment Script for Consecutive with Keywords 
into your non-English language and underline the keywords (or their equivalent in your 
non-English language) in your translated “Answer” portions. Then, record your translated 
“Answer” portions into individual practice audio files. You can do this yourself or with the 
help of another person. This will give you additional non-English practice audio files that you 
can use to practice interpreting in the consecutive mode, simulating a courtroom exchange, 
as well as non-English Assessment Script portions with the keywords underlined that you 
can use to assess your renditions of the keywords. 

3.  Practice with Your Prepared Materials in Two Languages: 

❑  Practice your interpreting and record yourself. Practice interpreting the English materials 
into your non-English language and your prepared non-English materials into English, 
while recording your performance, so you can go back and assess your interpretations. As 
you listen to your practice recordings, think about your delivery and the accuracy of your 
interpretations. You may also want to refer to the NCSC’s Common Oral Interpreting Exam 
Performance Deficiencies document to help you identify possible areas for improvement. 
(Note that you will need to use a recording device and a playback device for both the 
Consecutive and Simultaneous interpretation materials. For the Simultaneous 
interpretation materials, you will also need a set of headphones so that you capture only 
your voice, and not the source audio, while recording your performance.) 

❑  Assess your renditions of English and non-English keywords. A set of assessment scripts is 
provided that have bolded, underlined English keywords, which represent various features 
of language. When you prepared the materials for practice in two languages, you 
underlined the non-English keywords (or their equivalent in your non-English language) in 
your translated script portions. As you listen to your practice recordings, assess your 
renditions of the English and non-English keywords to help you determine whether you are 
accurately conveying the same meaning, register, and grammatical structure of the source 
message. 

❑  Build a glossary. As you practice, use the glossary template to note the meaning in context, 
as well as possible renditions in English or in your non-English language, for each of the 
keywords. Compile a glossary of terms and phrases in English and your non-English 
language, as well as possible renditions and contextual cues, to help you choose the 
appropriate rendition at the appropriate time. 

We hope these materials help you practice and improve your interpreting skills!

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
