      <pre>Domestic Abuse Information for Oregon Family Law Practitioners 

Why should attorneys screen for domestic abuse?1 

The presence of domestic abuse*2 can impact every aspect of a family law case.  Most significantly, it 
has serious adverse effects on children and is therefore highly relevant to custody and parenting time 
issues.   In addition, it may affect the suitability of mediation, relocation concerns, distribution of assets, 
and spousal support, among other matters.  Identifying the existence of domestic abuse and its past, 
present, and future impact on your clients and their children is critical to achieving safe and appropriate 
legal outcomes. Knowing criminal exposure can assist in advising clients properly on risks and options. 
Regardless of whether your client is a perpetrator or victim3, your knowledge of those facts will inform 
your representation and will allow you to develop a suitable case strategy sooner rather than later. 
When domestic abuse is identified, be prepared to make appropriate referrals and address any 
immediate safety concerns and needed support services for all involved, including for the children.  At 
every stage of the case, consider safety issues and domestic abuse related laws in developing your legal 
strategy.  Information about resources and relevant laws is included below. 

regon Rule of Professional Conduct 1.1 relating to competence supports screening for domestic abuse.   

The rule states: 

RULE 1.1 COMPETENCE  
A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires 
the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the 
representation. 

ffective representation hinges on knowledge of all the facts relevant to the case at hand.  Inquiring 
into the existence of domestic abuse is the first step. Lawyers who have elicited such information are 
then well-positioned to provide advocacy that is consistent with the requirements set out in Rule 1.1 
and addresses the legal needs of a client who is either a victim or perpetrator of domestic abuse.    

he odds are great that a family law lawyer has already had or will have a client who is a victim or 
perpetrator of domestic abuse.  People experiencing or perpetrating domestic abuse, however, are 
often reluctant to share that information with anyone, including their counsel.  As noted, effective 
representation requires a foundational knowledge of the relevant facts. Therefore, screening for 
domestic abuse with every client is crucial to every family law attorney’s practice. 

eep in mind that clients are more likely to disclose if they: 

  understand the confidential nature of the attorney-client relationship and feel safe sharing 

information about abuse; 

  know that all clients are being screened, not just them; 
  know that the information is important to their case; and 
  know that the information will be handled responsibly. 

                                                           
1 Source material: Domestic Abuse Committee of the Family Law Section of the Minnesota State Bar Association, “Client 
Screening to Identify Domestic Violence Victimization.” 2013 
2 Domestic Abuse is used throughout this document to include coercive, power and control dynamics, instead of 
solely criminal, physical violence. When statistics are cited related to intimate partner or domestic violence, they 
do include all forms of abuse, not just physical. 
3 In this document, the terms “victim” and “perpetrator” are used throughout because these are commonly 
understood terms. Ask your client what language they prefer and use language supportive of your client and what 
they would use themselves.

Conveying a basic understanding of domestic abuse and communicating support and a lack of judgment 
are essential.  In the course of an interview, it also may be appropriate to share that the attorney has 
information about resources and is able to make referrals as needed.    

inally, the presence of domestic violence has safety implications, not just for the victim, but for you and 
your staff.  Being aware of the issue will help you identify and address potential safety concerns.  
Information about safety planning is included below. 

hat is domestic abuse?4 

omestic abuse is a pattern of abusive behavior in any relationship that is used by one partner to gain or 

maintain power and control over the other partner.  It may or may not be illegal behavior. Domestic 
abuse can be physical, sexual, emotional, economic, stalking, or psychological actions or threats of 
actions that influence another person. This includes any behaviors that intimidate, manipulate, 
humiliate, isolate, frighten, terrorize, coerce, threaten, blame, hurt, injure, or wound someone. Below 
are some examples. 

hysical Abuse: Hitting, slapping, shoving, grabbing, pinching, biting, hair pulling, etc. are types of 

physical abuse. This type of abuse also includes denying a partner medical care (chronic issues, injuries 
from abuse, reproductive care, hormones or surgery for a transgender partner), or forcing alcohol 
and/or drug use upon him or her. 

exual Abuse: Coercing or attempting to coerce any sexual contact or behavior without consent. Sexual 
abuse includes, but is certainly not limited to, marital rape, attacks on sexual parts of the body, forcing 
sex after physical violence has occurred, or treating one in a sexually demeaning manner. Sexual abuse 
can also include consequences for not having sexual contact, such as not allowing a partner to sleep or 
not allowing access to family money for food and hygiene items. These may be times victims/survivors 
says “yes” but only because they did not feel as if they could say no without consequence. 

motional Abuse: Undermining an individual's sense of self-worth and/or self-esteem is abusive. This 
may include, but is not limited to constant criticism, diminishing one's abilities, name-calling, or 
damaging one's relationship with his or her children. 

conomic Abuse: Preventing an individual from acquiring, using, or maintaining financial resources by 
maintaining total control over financial resources, withholding one's access to money, forbidding one's 
attendance at school or employment, ruining the family’s credit/rental history, or not spending family 
money responsibly. 

sychological Abuse: Elements of psychological abuse include - but are not limited to - causing fear by 

intimidation; threatening physical harm to self, partner, children, or partner's family or friends; 
destruction of pets and property; causing the individual to feel “crazy” and confused; and forcing 
isolation from family, friends, or school and/or work. 

omestic abuse can happen to anyone regardless of race, age, sexual orientation, religion, or gender. 
Domestic abuse affects people of all socioeconomic backgrounds and education levels. Domestic abuse 
occurs in both opposite-sex and same-sex relationships and can happen to intimate partners who are 
married, living together, or dating.

omestic abuse not only affects those who are abused, but also has a substantial effect on family 
members, friends, co-workers, other witnesses, and the community at large. Children who grow up 
witnessing domestic violence are among those seriously affected by this behavior. Frequent exposure 
to violence in the home can impact children and youth psychologically, socially, academically, and 
behaviorally, resulting in trauma, diminished health outcomes, and low academic achievement. By the 
time children in the U.S. are between 14-17 years of age, 27% have been exposed to intimate partner 
violence.  

 
Domestic Abuse Screening Questions for Attorneys 

nitial screening for domestic abuse:   
Below are some questions that you can integrate into your interviews with new clients to screen for 
domestic abuse.  Asking questions about domestic violence is recommended in every case. Ideally, 
screening should be part of a conversation with your client. The questions below will help initiate that 
conversation. When discussing incidents and behaviors with your clients, you should consider the 
context, intent, and effect of what is described. Establishing a level of rapport with your client before 
exploring these issues is best.  Finally, your assessment of your client’s level of comfort and your 
personal practice or style should guide when and precisely how you ask the questions.  Seek support 
from a Domestic Violence advocate or program if you need it. 
 

□  Have you and your partner been involved in other legal cases, including protective order 

matters?  
 

□  What happens when you and your partner disagree?  

□  Have you or your partner ever destroyed your clothing, objects in your home, or something you 

especially cared about? 

□  Have you or your partner taken the children without your consent, threatened to never let them 

see you again, or otherwise harmed them, physically or emotionally? 

□  Do you feel you have to walk on egg shells around your partner? Does your partner feel like that 

□  Have you or your partner tried to control your finances, activities outside the home, or your 

with you? 
 

contact with family or friends?  
 

□  Have you or your partner threatened to reveal sensitive information about you that may get you 
in legal trouble,  impact your work, relationships, or embarrass you in some way (e.g. “outing,” 
criminal history, legal residency status, mental health or drug/alcohol issues)? 
 

□  Do you feel safe at home or when around your partner? Does your partner feel safe with you? 

□  Does your partner prevent you from eating or sleeping, or endanger your health in other ways 
(including withholding hormones, medication, or birth control)? Do you prevent your partner? 
 

□  Have you or your partner ever hurt or threatened you (including pushing, slapping, or hitting 

 

you)?

□  Have you or your partner ever forced you to do something that made you uncomfortable or that 

you did not want to do, including something sexual? 
 

□  Have you or your partner threatened to take a pet away, withhold care, or harm your pet?  

□ 

 
Is there anything else about your relationship with your partner that you want to share? 
 

□  What would your partner say if asked these questions? 

ssessing the level of danger:   

If your client reveals the existence of domestic abuse, and is the victim, you can ask other questions to 
identify the dangerousness of your client’s situation. Alternatively, you may want to refer the client to a 
domestic violence program for this level of assessment.  If you choose to ask additional questions 
relating to level of danger, here are some common questions that can be used for this purpose.  
Affirmative answers to these questions indicate heightened danger and are cause for concern.5  See the 
resources link below for appropriate referrals. 
 

□  Does your partner have, or can they easily get, a gun? 

□  Has your partner ever tried to choke you? 

□ 

Is your partner constantly jealous? 

□  Does your partner try to control most of your daily activities? 

□  Has your partner ever forced you to have sex when you did not wish to do so? 

□  Have you left your partner or separated after living together or being married? 

□ 

Is your partner unemployed? 

□  Has your partner threatened or attempted suicide? 

□  Do you have a child that is not a child of your partner’s? 

□  Does your partner stalk you or leave threatening messages?

  Violence, coupled with a pattern of control and coercion, may be predictive of escalating 

physical and potentially lethal violence. 

  Research shows that victims’ perceptions of high danger are often accurate; their perceptions of 
low danger are not. In fact, victims frequently minimize the occurrence or severity of abuse. 
  Perpetrators may sometimes present as victims as a way to discredit a victim’s claim of abuse. 

It’s important to examine the context, intent, and effect of the abusive actions. 

  The most dangerous time for a victim is when the abuser becomes aware that the victim has 

decided to leave the relationship.  

  Children exposed to DV are at increased risk of neglect, physical and sexual abuse. 
  This screen may help identify patterns to further explore with your client, use your professional 

judgment.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
