      <pre>DEVELOPING and ENFORCING YOUR PARENTING PLAN

This booklet explains how parenting plans can be
developed and answers questions about the new
procedure to enforce them.
_____________________________________________________________

Parenting plans may address any of the
following, or other issues, too:
(cid:1)

the schedule for when the child will
be at each parent’s home
holiday, birthday, and vacation plans
how the child will get from one
parent’s home to the other, or to
school or day care
how school, medical, and other
information about the child will be
shared
when a parent should call the child
when the child is in the home of the
other parent
what will happen if one of the
parents has to move
how the parents will try to resolve
any disagreements about the child

Parenting time” is the time with the child
that the parent without legal custody has by
agreement or by court order.  Until recently,
“visitation” was the word used in Oregon for
“parenting time.”

  “

1.    What is “parenting time?”

2.    What is a “parenting plan?”

This is the plan that sets out the schedule
and rules for each parent’s time with the
child.   All custody orders (except for those
in restraining orders) must include parenting
plans.  The plan may be very detailed and
cover many issues about the child, or it may
be very general and address only a few
issues.  

All parenting plans in court orders must set
out the minimum amount of parenting time
(visitation) and access a parent without
custody is entitled to have.  In other words, a
new court-ordered parenting plan cannot say
that the noncustodial parent has just
“reasonable parenting time.”

3.    Who decides on the parenting plan?

The parents decide on the parenting plan if
they can agree.  If they can’t agree on their
own, a mediator may be able to help them to
reach an agreement.  A mediator is a trained,
neutral counselor who meets with parents in

1

Oregon laws encourage separating parents to develop
parenting plans for their children.  Oregon laws also
provide a new way to bring problems about parenting
time to the attention of the courts.  

one or more confidential sessions to help
them discuss their disagreement.  See
Question 4.

If meeting with the mediator (“mediation”)
doesn’t result in an agreement, then the
parents (or their attorneys) may decide on a
custody or parenting time study.  This is an
evaluation of the parents by a trained
counselor or psychologist who will make
recommendations to the judge.  

Without mediation or a study, it is up to the
parents (or their attorneys) to settle on the
parenting plan.  If parents don’t agree, either
parent may ask the judge to decide on the
plan.  Some judges adopt standard schedules
and rules that have been developed for that
county.  Oregon law requires that the plan be
based on what’s best for the child and safe
for the parents.

4.     How can I find out about mediation
in my county?

Courts in many counties provide no-cost
mediation services as a part of open court
cases involving a child.  In some counties,
mediation may be available through the
court even when no court case about a child
is pending but the parents are having a
disagreement about their parenting plan. 
Ask at your courthouse about court-provided
mediation.  Sometimes this service is
provided at the courthouse, sometimes at
other agencies (such as the County Mental
Health Department), and sometimes at the
offices of private mediators who work part-
time for the courts.  

Private mediators not connected with the
courts are also be available for hire in many

counties.   These mediators charge fees. 
Some specialize in family law matters.  You
may be able to find a mediator for your
parenting time problem by asking a family
law attorney, looking in the yellow pages of
the phone book, or contacting the Oregon
Mediation Association.  

Some mediation resources in your
community are listed at the end of this
booklet.  

5.     Will a  parenting plan require  joint
custody?  

No.  A parenting plan does not require that
the parents have, or want, joint custody.  

6.    Who decides on the parenting plan if
the other parent has not participated in
the court case?

When one parent has filed a court case,
sometimes the other parent chooses not to
participate.  Usually this means the other
parent doesn’t file his or her own court
papers in response.  When this happens, the
parenting plan proposed by the first parent is
very often the plan approved by the judge.

2

7.    Do I need to put my parenting plan in
a court order if the other parent and I
have agreed on the terms?

Only parenting plans contained in court
orders are enforceable.  The decision on
whether to put the plan in a court order
depends on your situation and relationship
with the other parent.  

8.    Can parenting time rights in a court
order be denied or restricted?

Yes, but only by a judge, and only if the
parenting time would put the child in real
danger.  Usually, this means showing the
judge that the visiting parent has physically
or sexually abused the child, committed a
violent crime, or has a very serious alcohol
or other drug problem.  Sometimes the judge
will order that visits be supervised by a third
person.

9.   Can I deny parenting time to the other
parent if child support is not paid?

No.  You must allow the other parent the
parenting time ordered in the parenting plan
even if child support is not being paid. 

10.    Can I stop paying child support if
my parenting time is being denied?

No.  You must pay your child support even
if you are not getting the parenting time that
has been ordered.  Only a court or agency
judge can release you from your child
support obligation.

11.    Do I have to make my children go on
visits if they don’t want to?

Your children should follow the parenting
plan even if they don’t agree with it.  You
should try to find out why your child does
not want to go.  Try to work out the
problems by talking to the other parent or
through counseling, if those are safe steps
for you.  You may also want to try
mediation.  See Question 4. In some
situations, a judge may change the parenting
plan.   

12.    What can I do if the other parent
denies me the parenting time ordered by
the court?

You should first try to talk to the other
parent to try to work out the problem if you
can do this safely (and if no court order
prohibits you from contacting the other
parent).  You may also want to contact a
private mediator, or a mediator connected to
the court, to see if that process helps.  See
Question 4, on mediation.  You could also
contact an attorney.  Perhaps negotiation
through attorneys will improve the situation. 
Mediation and low-cost legal resources for
your county are listed at the end of this
booklet

15.  How do I start the “parenting time
enforcement procedure” at the court?

The first step is for you to fill out and file
the “motion” (request) to the court asking
that your parenting plan be enforced.  The
court will give you this form at no charge,  
but there is a fee for filing it.  (See question
13).  You will mark the form to show the
type of enforcement action you want.  See
Question 19.  You must attach to the motion
a copy of the court order setting out your
current parenting plan.

The court will also give you a signed order
requiring the other party to come to court to
“show cause” (explain why) the parenting
plan should not be enforced in the way you
request.  The order also contains a notice
about “contempt of court” penalties.  See
Question 21. The order may have a specific
date for a hearing on it, or it may state that
the hearing will be set later, after the other
parent has had a chance to respond in
writing to the court and to you.

ost courts want mediation to occur before

a court hearing is held on parenting time
issues.   So you may also be given a signed
court order requiring both parents to
participate in mediation.    See Questions 3
and 4.  If mediation is ordered, either parent
can also get forms to fill out for “waiving”
mediation  if either  has good reason to skip
the mediation step. 

  M

4

If these steps fail or if they are not options
for you, you can file papers with the court
complaining about the denial of parenting
time.  Each county has a special procedure
to handle parenting time problems.  Go to
the circuit court clerk’s office at the county
courthouse and ask for the “parenting time
enforcement” forms.  The room number for
this clerk in your courthouse is listed at the
end of this booklet.

13.    Does the court’s “parenting time
enforcement procedure” cost anything?

In most cases, you must pay at least $45 to
file a complaint about denial or interference
with parenting time under this procedure. 
Some counties have added an extra charge
on this filing fee to pay for mediation
services. 

If you have a very low income, the court
might defer (postpone) payment of this fee
until after the case is resolved.  Some courts
may even waive the fee.  If you want to
request a fee deferral or waiver, ask the clerk
if a “fee deferral” or “fee waiver” form is
available.  You might also get these forms
from a local Legal Aid office.   

14.   Do I need an attorney?

The parenting time enforcement procedure is
designed to be easy to understand and use. 
Judges expect that many people will use this
procedure without attorneys.  But it may be
helpful to have an attorney, or at least to
consult with one about your situation before
your file the forms.  Some low-cost legal
resources for your county are listed at the
end of this booklet.

understands what the plan says.  The judge
may then ask the parent who filed the
request for enforcement to explain what
happened.  The other parent will then have a
chance to explain whether or why the
parenting time was denied.  

Each parent may want to bring one or two
witnesses to court to give information about 
times that the plan was not followed (or to
show that the plan has been followed, or was
not followed for a good reason).  The judge
will tell the parents when the witnesses may
offer their information to the court.  Each
parent will have a chance to ask questions of
their own witnesses and the other parent’s
witnesses.

The parent who filed the request for
enforcement has the responsibility to prove
that the other parent violated the parenting
time order.   

It is important to be respectful to the other
parent, to the witnesses, and to the judge. 
Even when you disagree with what is being
said, you should not interrupt or speak
rudely.  It may also be helpful to bring a list
of notes of the most important things that
you want to tell the judge.  You can use
these notes at the hearing to help you
remember all the points you wanted to make. 

his hearing may be very short or it could
last an hour or longer, depending on the case
and the procedure in your county.  Before
you go to court, you may want to ask the
court clerk how much time the hearing has
been scheduled to last.  In some counties,
the court clerk may be able to tell you this
when you first file your “motion” (request). 
In other counties, you may not know this
until right before the hearing.

  T

You must then make sure  a copy of these
court papers is “served on” (officially
delivered to) the other parent.  Some courts
include forms for you (or a third person or
the sheriff) to sign to prove that “service”
(delivery) has taken place.  This form is
called a “Proof of Service” or an “Affidavit
of Service.”   If your court does not make
this form available, you may be able to
obtain one from a local Legal Aid office.

16.    How long will it take to get a court
hearing?

The law says that the hearing must be held
no later than 45 days after you filed your
motion for enforcement, unless the parents
agree to delay the hearing time.  One reason
for delay is the parents’ trying to work out
an agreement with the help of a mediator, an
attorney, or by themselves. 

17.    What if mediation doesn’t work, or
isn’t an option in my case?

If you and the other parent don’t agree on a
solution, the judge will hold a hearing.

18.    What will happen if a hearing is
necessary?

The first step the judge will probably take is
to review the existing parenting plan to
make sure that the judge and each parent

19.    What can the court do at the hearing
if it finds that the parenting time order
has been violated?

The judge has many options available,
depending on the facts of the case.  The
court can:
(cid:1)

Depending on the facts, a judge could decide
that the complaining parent has not shown
that the plan was violated.  The judge could
also decide that the plan was violated, but
that a good reason existed for the violation
in a particular situation.  In cases like these,
the judge might explain to the parties
possible ways to avoid problems in the
future.

specify a detailed schedule,
especially if only a general schedule
now exists
add new terms and conditions to the
parenting time order
order make-up parenting time, to
compensate for time that was
improperly denied to a parent
order the parent who has violated the
plan to post a bond (deposit money)
with the court that the parent would
lose for continuing to disobey the
parenting time order  
require both parents to attend classes
that teach the parents about the effect
on children when parenting time is
denied
order the party who has violated the
order (or the party who failed to
prove the order was violated) to pay
the costs of the hearing process
(including filing fees, court fees,
hearing costs, and attorney fees)
end or modify spousal support terms
that had been ordered between the
parents
end or modify child support (if the
child lives in another state, the court
may not have the power to do this) 
schedule a hearing for modification
of custody, if the parent without
custody has shown he or she has
been repeatedly and unreasonably
denied parenting time and files the
correct legal papers for such a
hearing.

20.    What if I am not satisfied with what
the judge did at the enforcement hearing?

A parent has a right to appeal the decision of
this judge to a higher court.  There is a
deadline for making this request and the
paperwork is complicated and lengthy.  You
will need the assistance of an attorney.  

21.    Are there other remedies for a
parent when parenting time is denied?

Yes.  In addition to the new parenting time
enforcement procedure, a parent can file
legal papers to have the judge decide that the
other parent is in “contempt of court” for
violating a court order about parenting.  The
forms and procedures for this type of case
are complicated and are not available from
the court.  You will need an attorney for this
process.

the advice of an attorney.  If you
have a specific legal question,
you should contact an attorney. 
The information in this booklet

always changing through the
actions of the courts, the
legislature, and agencies.

It is also possible to ask the court to change
(“modify”) custody or parenting time
because of enforcement problems.  A parent
can file a modification motion asking for a
new order.  A few courts might have these
forms available, but in most counties you
will need to contact an attorney for a
modification.

When you have a custody or parenting time
order from another state (or you have an
Oregon order but your children have been
living in another state), special laws control
which state can decide a modification issue. 
You may need an attorney if you have this
situation, too.

Finally, in some situations, major violations
of parenting plans might be considered
crimes.  This is rare, however, and depends
very much on the type of wording in the
court order and the facts of the case. 

2.    Can a parent who has custody use

this enforcement process if the other
parent does not follow a parenting time
court order?

Yes.  Either parent may start this court and
mediation process by filing the forms
available at the courthouse.  If the parent
with custody has the complaint, this parent
must show that the other parent’s failure to
follow the parenting time terms was
“substantial.”  In mediation, any type of
parenting issue can be discussed.
