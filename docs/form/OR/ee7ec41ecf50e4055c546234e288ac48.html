If an individual does not meet the requirements in Section 2.2 regarding eligibility 
through national certification, the individual must have passed all skills segments 
of a qualifying exam within the 24 months before OSCA receives the individual’s 
application for certification. 

Only stenographic and voicewriting skills exams that meet or exceed the

3) 

OSCA recognizes the following exams offered by the NCRA and NVRA as 
meeting or exceeding the minimum standards in subsection (2): 

NCRA’s RPR exam. 

NVRA’s CVR exam. 

NCRA exams open only to RPRs as a prerequisite. 

NVRA exams open only to CVRs as a prerequisite. 

At any time, OSCA may stop accepting any exam that no longer meets at least 
the minimum standards in subsection (2). 

The applicant must provide any documentation necessary to establish that the 
exam qualifies. 

The State Court Administrator may consult the Certified Shorthand Reporters 
Advisory Committee for help in determining whether a particular exam meets the 
requirements of this section.  The State Court Administrator’s decision to accept 
or not accept an exam is final.

Section 3:  Certification Renewal 

.1 

Qualifying for Renewal 

To qualify for certification renewal, a CSR must 

    3

 

At least 60 calendar days before a CSR’s certification expires, OSCA will send a 
renewal notice and renewal forms to the CSR’s most recent mailing address on 
file.  To apply for renewal, a CSR must use the current forms included in the 
packet. 

OSCA urges every CSR to complete and submit the required documents and 
fees for renewal as soon as feasible after the CSR receives the renewal notice 
and forms.  This will allow the CSR maximum time to handle any problems 
before the CSR’s certification expires.  Insufficient documentation, fees, or CEU 
in qualified courses will not be grounds for extending deadlines for renewal of 
certification. 

To apply for renewal, a CSR must submit the following to OSCA: 

A current renewal application with all parts completed. 

A completed CSR Continuing Education Log, even if also submitting an 
education log or education transcript from a state or national association. 

c) 

Either

  Sponsor 
  Course date(s) 
  Hours of actual education 
  Proof of attendance or completion 

The certification renewal fee (see Section 5.1). 

d) 

  (

An individual who holds CSR certification in both stenographic reporting and 
voicewriting reporting must apply for renewal of each certification separately and 
pay separate renewal fees for each certification.  The CSR may use the same 
continuing education courses to renew both certifications if the courses meet all 
other CEU requirements (e.g., the CSR attended the course within the 36 months 
before each certification expires).  

 
Expiration Date of Renewed Certification

previous certification expired. 
 
Grace Period 

3.4 

ertifications renewed on or after January 1, 2014, will expire three years after the 

A certification expires if OSCA does not receive a completed renewal application, 
fully paid fees, and all required documentation to qualify for renewal on or before 
the certification expiration date.   

OSCA allows a maximum 30-calendar-day grace period after a certification 
expires.  The purpose of the grace period is to allow CSRs additional time to 
submit documents and fees. 

A CSR cannot use the grace period to obtain additional CEU needed to qualify 
for renewal. 

A CSR may apply for renewal of an expired certification during the grace period.  
OSCA must receive all required, completed documents and fully paid renewal 
fees no later than 30 calendar days after the certification expired. 

A certification eligible for renewal within the grace period is considered expired 
but still valid until the grace period ends.  Agreements to follow the Code of 
Conduct remain in effect during the grace period, and the individual may continue 
to use the title of “certified shorthand reporter” during the grace period. 

OSCA will not renew certification after the grace period.  If OSCA receives a 
renewal application, required documentation, or fees after the grace period, 
OSCA will send the individual an expiration notice and refund submitted renewal 
fees.

OSCA will not put a certification into “inactive” or any other status that would 
postpone renewal requirements beyond the grace period 

 
Effect of Not Applying for Renewal or Not Qualifying for Renewal 

3.5 

OSCA will not approve extensions beyond the grace period in Section 3.4. 

An individual who does not meet all of the renewal requirements by the end of 
the grace period must immediately stop using the expired certification number 
and the title of “certified shorthand reporter,” CSR, and any other titles, 
abbreviations, or designations indicating that the person is a Certified Shorthand 
Reporter in Oregon.  This applies to work already in progress as well as future 
work and transcribing notes that may have been taken while certified, except to 
note that the individual was a CSR at the time the individual administered any 
oaths.  (See ORS 8.435.) 

The individual may apply to become a CSR again but must meet all the 
requirements for initial certification—including exam requirements—and must 
reapply for initial certification.  

If the individual qualifies and applies for initial certification, OSCA will issue a new 
certification with a new certification number and new expiration date.  The CSR 
must use the new certification number exclusively. 

 
Notice of Mailing Address or Name Change 

3.6 

 CSR must send written notice of any mailing address or name change to OSCA.  
OSCA will not extend any deadlines if a CSR misses important information or mailings 
because the CSR did not send the required notice to OSCA.

Section 4:  Aligning CSR and National Certification Dates (Optional) 

Have current CSR certification.  (Alignment is not available when applying for 
initial certification.) 

Have current NCRA or NVRA certification with an expiration date after the 
individual’s CSR certification expiration date.  (OSCA will move CSR certification 
dates further into the future only, not backwards to an earlier date.) 

Not be serving a period of suspension, revocation, resignation, or denial of any 
shorthand reporter certification, license, or registration from any state or national 
entity for any reason other than failing to meet documentation requirements. 

Not have any convictions for a crime related to a shorthand reporter’s 
qualifications, functions, or duties.  (The State Court Administrator has discretion 
to decide what crimes are related to a shorthand reporter’s qualifications, 
functions, or duties.)  

Submit a completed alignment application, required documentation, and 
alignment fees to OSCA.  OSCA must receive all required documents and fees 
on or before the CSR’s current certification expiration date.  A CSR cannot use 
the 30-day grace period in Section 3.4 to apply for certification alignment.

ecognizing that CSRs may also hold national certification, and may prefer to renew both on 

the same cycle, the State Court Administrator adopts the following option to align CSR 
certification expiration and CEU dates to national certification expiration and CEU dates.

Qualifying for Certification Alignment 

To qualify for certification alignment, an individual must

Applying for Certification Alignment 

(1) 

To align CSR certification dates to national certification dates, a CSR must 
submit the following to OSCA: 

A current alignment application with all parts completed. 

Proof of the date the CSR’s NCRA or NVRA certification expires. 

A total fee equal to the alignment fee in Section 5.1 multiplied by the 
number of months the CSR’s certification is to be extended. 

 
A CSR may contact OSCA before applying to verify the total fee required.

New CSR Certification Expiration Date 

4.3 
 

(1) 

If a CSR qualifies for certification alignment, OSCA will move the CSR’s 
certification expiration date to the end of the calendar quarter that is closest to, 
but not after, the expiration date of the CSR’s national certification. 

Example One: 

  The individual’s CSR certification expires on June 30.   
  The individual’s national certification expires 15 months later, on 

September 30.   

OSCA will extend the individual’s CSR certification expiration date 15 months, 
moving the date to the same date the individual’s national certification expires.  
(September 30 is the end of a calendar quarter.) 

Example Two: 
 

on May 1.   

  The individual’s CSR certification expires on June 30.  
  The individual’s national certification expires 10 months and 1 day later, 

OSCA will extend the individual’s CSR certification expiration date nine months, 
moving the date to March 31 of the same year the individual’s national 
certification expires.  (March 31 is the end of the calendar quarter that is closest 
to, but before, May 1.) 

2) 

OSCA will issue the CSR a new certification with the new expiration date. 

Alignment is not a certification renewal.   

Effect of Certification Alignment 

.4 

  4

An agreement to follow the Code of Conduct remains in effect until the end of the 
grace period following the new certification expiration date. 

Following alignment, the time frame for earning CEU for renewal is based on the 
new certification expiration date.  Courses already taken for renewal may no 
longer fall within the 24- or 36-month period specified in Section 6.1.  For 
example, if a three-year certification is moved from March 31 to September 30 of 
the same year, the CSR must earn 3.0 CEU in the 36 months before the 
September 30 expiration date to be eligible for renewal.  Courses taken early in 
the 36 months, before the original March 31 expiration date, may no longer 
qualify for CEU.

Section 6:  Continuing Education 

The purpose of continuing education is to equip CSRs with the knowledge and skills necessary 
to compete in a world of ever-changing information and technology.  A uniformly applied, 
continuing education program ensures that the public will find a consistent quality of proficiency 
and knowledge among CSRs.   

he goals of continuing education are to 

  ensure the technical competence of reporters 
  strengthen and ensure the professional competence of reporters 
  stimulate professional development 

n line with these goals, the State Court Administrator adopts the following continuing education 
requirements. 

Number of CEU Required for Renewal 

For two-year certifications (those expiring on or before December 31, 2015), a 
CSR must earn 2.0 CEU (20 hours) in the 24 months before the CSR’s 
certification expiration date. 

For three-year certifications (those expiring after December 31, 2015), a CSR 
must earn 3.0 CEU (30 hours) in the 36 months before the CSR’s certification 
expiration date. 

All CEU must be earned during the specified period.  Excess CEU from a prior 
renewal period do not count toward the CEU requirement, including carryover 
allowed by national or other certification programs.  

 
Recordkeeping 

6.2 

Each CSR must 

1) 

Keep his or her own records of CEU and supporting documentation to submit for 
renewal.   

2) 

Keep a copy of all documents submitted for renewal of certification until either 

(a) 

(b) 

The CSR receives a renewed certificate; OR 
  
The 30-day grace period in Section 3.4 expires, if the renewal is denied. 

 
Courses Eligible for CEU 

Courses qualify for CEU based on sponsor, topic, or approval for NCRA or NVRA 
continuing education credit.

The name of the course sponsor and sponsor contact information.

functions of a CSR. 

Official sponsor documentation describing the course (hard copy or 
electronic documents, not internet links). 

b) 

c) 

d) 

e) 

  (

  (

  (

  (

The written request should include 

(a) 

A summary of course content. 

OSCA will make determinations based on written requests only. 

OSCA will use the information in the request, and documents the CSR submits 
with the request, to determine if the course qualifies for CEU.  OSCA is not 
required to research courses or follow internet links to find information about 
courses. 

A CSR may submit a request before or after taking a course to find out if the 
course will be accepted toward the CSR’s renewal requirement.  

Course qualification is based solely on the provisions of Section 6.3, regardless 
of whether or not a CSR submits a request.  OSCA will approve a request if 
OSCA determines that the course meets the requirements of Section 6.3.   
OSCA will not approve any course that does not meet the requirements of 
Section 6.3. 

OSCA’s determination that a course is eligible for CEU does not satisfy the 
documentation requirements for renewal.  The CSR must still obtain and submit 
all required course documentation and proof of attendance as required in Section 
3.2 when applying for renewal. 

6.4 

Earning CEU for Teaching CEU 

A CSR may earn double CEU for teaching a course that is eligible for CEU under 
Section 6.3 (allowing for class time and prep time).   

OSCA will award CEU for teaching a specific course only once within a 36-month 
period. 

 
Finding Out If a Course Qualifies for CEU 

6.5 

 CSR may submit a written request to OSCA to find out if a specific course qualifies for 

CEU.  Submitting a request is not required, but the CSR bears full responsibility if the 
CSR does not meet the CEU requirements for renewal because a course does not 
qualify for CEU.

(7) 

If OSCA determines that the course qualifies for CEU, OSCA may inform other 
CSRs of the educational opportunity. 

 
Online and Correspondence Courses 

6.6 

 CSR may earn CEU for an online or correspondence course if the course qualifies for 
CEU under Section 6.3 and the CSR meets all documentation requirements that apply to 
courses attended in person. 
 
Credit Date for Long-Term Courses 

6.7 

A CSR earns CEU for a qualified course on the last day of the course.  A CSR 
might begin a long-term course during one renewal cycle but complete the 
course during another.  The course is eligible for CEU only in the renewal cycle 
when the CSR completed the course.  For example, if a CSR started an online 
course in medical terminology during February and finished the course over 
several weeks ending in April, the CSR earns CEU for the course in April.  If the 
CSR’s certification expiration date falls in March while the CSR is still taking the 
course, the CSR cannot use the partially completed course to meet the CEU 
requirement for renewal; however, after completing the course, the CSR can use 
the entire course for CEU toward the CSR’s next renewal. 

2) 

For a multi-day event such as a conference, a CSR earns CEU for each 
individual session on the day the specific session ends.   

 
Converting Hours or Credits to CEU 

6.8 

1) 

Except as stated in subsections (2) through (5), a CSR may earn 0.05 CEU for 
each full half hour of instruction in qualified courses.  Break time and lunch time 
are not included. 

 hour = 0.05 CEU 

1 hour = 0.1 CEU 
1½ hours = 0.15 CEU 
2 hours = 0.2 CEU 
10 hours = 1.0 CEU 
30 hours = 3.0 CEU 

Examples: 

  ½

A CSR may earn 0.1 CEU (one hour) for each full half hour of teaching a 
qualified course (0.05 for class time and 0.05 for preparation). 

Courses approved for NCRA continuing education credit receive the same 
number of CEU approved by the national association.  

For courses approved for NVRA continuing education (CE), 1 CE is equal to 
0.1 CEU (one hour). 

For academic courses allowed under Section 6.3(1)(b)(vii), each 1.0 of college or 
university credit is equal to 1.0 CEU (10 hours).

OSCA may require an individual to provide any information or documents needed 
to show that the individual qualifies for certification or continues to qualify for 
certification.  This includes, but is not limited to, information on criminal 
convictions. 

OSCA may take reasonable action to verify information on any application or
