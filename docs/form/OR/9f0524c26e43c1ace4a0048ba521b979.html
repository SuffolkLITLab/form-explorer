POLICY: 

I.

STATE STATUTORY POLICY

Court interpreters act as neutral and impartial officers of the court who assist in ensuring that
court proceedings and courthouse services are accessible to persons eligible to receive
interpreting services according to ORS 45.273.

ORS 45.273 states, “It is declared to be the policy of this state to secure the constitutional rights
and other rights of persons who are unable to readily understand or communicate in the English
language because of a non-English-speaking cultural background or a disability, and who as a
result cannot be fully protected in administrative and court proceedings unless qualified
interpreters are available to provide assistance.”

ORS 45.291 states that the State Court Administrator shall, subject to available funding,
establish a program for the certification of court interpreters.  The Office of the State Court
Administrator (OSCA) manages this program through Court Language Access Services (CLAS).

According to ORS 45.275(9)(c), a “qualified interpreter” is:  “a person who is readily able to
communicate with the non-English-speaking person and who can orally transfer the meaning of
statements to and from English and the language spoken by the non-English-speaking person.
A qualified interpreter must be able to interpret in a manner that conserves the meaning, tone,
level, style, and register of the original statement, without additions or omissions.  ‘Qualified
interpreter’ does not include any person who is unable to interpret the dialect, slang, or
specialized vocabulary used by the party or witness.”

An interpreter is qualified on the record pursuant to ORS 45.275(8):

“A court, a hearing officer or the designee of a hearing officer shall require any person serving
as an interpreter for the court or agency to state the person’s name on the record and whether
the person is certified under ORS 45.291.  If the person is certified under ORS 45.291, the
interpreter need not make the oath or affirmation required by ORS 40.325 or submit the
interpreter’s qualifications on the record.  If the person is not certified under ORS 45.291, the
interpreter must make the oath or affirmation required by ORS 40.325 and submit the
interpreter’s qualifications on the record.”

Pursuant to ORS 45.292, an interpreter may not assume or use the title or designation “certified
court interpreter” or “court certified interpreter” or any other title, designation, words, letters,
abbreviation, sign, or device tending to indicate that the interpreter is OJD certified (or OJD
registered) for the purposes of providing court interpreter services unless the interpreter has met
the requirements outlined in this policy.

The Oregon statutes relevant to court interpreting are found in ORS chapter 45.

II.

PURPOSE OF THE STATE COURT ADMINISTRATOR’S POLICIES

The purpose of these policies is to implement the requirements established by the State Court
Administrator according to ORS 45.291 and to provide interpreters, courts, and interested

C. 

Deadlines for Completion of Credential Requirements

timelines established by CLAS.  If an interpreter misses a deadline, the credentialing 
process may be delayed.

convictions may be an automatic bar to obtaining the certified or registered credential.

VII. COMPLIANCE REVIEW

ORS 45.291 provides that the State Court Administrator, subject to the availability of funding,
shall establish grounds for renewal, suspension or cancellation of credentials, and a process for
receiving comments and input on compliance with the Code of Professional Responsibility for
Interpreters in the Oregon Courts.

OJD’s Oregon Certified Court Interpreter Program 

Effective Date:  11/01/2022 

Page 13 of 17 

A. 

Noncompliance with Renewal Requirements 

The interpreter’s credential will be suspended if the interpreter fails to comply 
with the credential renewal requirements before the expiration date. 

The interpreter’s credential will be cancelled if the interpreter fails to comply with 
the credential renewal requirements within six months after the expiration date. 

If the interpreter’s credential is cancelled due to noncompliance with renewal 
requirements, the interpreter will be required to restart the credential process 
should the interpreter seek to regain the credential. 

B. 

Skills Retesting or Oral Proficiency Reassessment 

An interpreter credential will be cancelled if an interpreter is required to retake the Court 
Interpreting Oral Examination or an Oral Proficiency Interview for a measurement of the 
interpreter’s skills and does not achieve acceptable scores. 

C. 

Noncompliance with the CPR 

Comments concerning a credentialed interpreter’s compliance or noncompliance with 
the Code of Professional Responsibility for Interpreters in the Oregon Courts (CPR) or 
other program policies may be submitted to CLAS for review and possible action. 

oncerns that are not corroborated will be closed without further action.  Corroborated 

concerns will require further review of the interpreter’s credential. 

 

When CLAS receives a complaint, CLAS will notify the affected interpreter. 

Upon receipt of the written notification of concerns, the interpreter may provide a 
written or verbal response to CLAS within fourteen (14) calendar days.  The 
purpose of the response is to give the interpreter an opportunity to address the 
concerns. 

•  Failure to provide a written or verbal response within the 14-day period 

may result in the loss of opportunity to demonstrate compliance. 

Depending on the severity and nature of the findings and after review of all 
information and the interpreter’s response, CLAS may take one or more of the 
following steps: 

Require that the interpreter submit a plan with an implementation timeline 
to address the concerns and provide an opportunity for the interpreter to 
show compliance to the Code of Professional Responsibility for 
Interpreters in the Oregon Courts and other program policies. 

Require the interpreter to retest for an updated psychometric 
measurement of the interpreter’s skills. 

Recommend suspension or cancellation of the interpreter’s credential to 
the State Court Administrator.

The State Court Administrator or designee, having reviewed all information, will make a 
decision regarding renewal, suspension, or cancellation of the court interpreter’s 
credential.  According to ORS 45.291(k), an adversely affected interpreter who objects to 
the decision made by the State Court Administrator or designee may submit a written 
request for further review. 

VIII. OREGON CERTIFIED AND REGISTERED COURT INTERPRETER ROSTER

Oregon Certified and Registered Court Interpreters appear on an OJD public list including the
interpreter’s name, a listing of the language or languages the interpreter provides interpreting
services, and credential expiration date.  An interpreter’s contact information will be listed if they
submit a consent form to release contact information on the publicly distributed roster.  The
interpreter is responsible to keep the information correct and current.

Certified and registered interpreters may update their contact information by sending an email
to:  Court.Interpreter.Program@ojd.state.or.us.
