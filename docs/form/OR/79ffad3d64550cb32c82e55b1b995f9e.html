CUSTODY & PARENTING TIME REPORT OF SFLAC PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT WORKGROUP –  PAGE  1 OF 13  

In March 2010, the Oregon State Family Law Advisory Committee (SFLAC) formed the 

Parental Involvement Workgroup to investigate local and national trends regarding best interest 

standards and practices for children of divorce, paying particular attention to the distinction 

between parenting schedules (referred to throughout as parenting time) and custody, referring to 

legal decision making authority as defined by ORS 107.169.   A multi-disciplinary group was 

established for the purpose of reviewing developmental research, Family Court patterns, and 

legislative policies for the benefit of Oregon families.  The task included examination of factors 

that support specific types of parenting time schedules and decision-making arrangements.  

Focused effort was given to identifying the developmental requirements of children, particularly 

those at risk for harm or maladjustment due to their family circumstances.  

As societal customs and knowledge evolve, remaining abreast of relevant empirical evidence 

and contemporary standards when determining optimal post-divorce or separation arrangements is 

vital.  A critique of existing presumptions and prevailing practices to promote child-centric policies 

and  applications  is  integral  to  the  process  of  creating  viable  custodial  and  parenting  time

arrangements.  

II. 

PROTECTIVE FACTORS   

Custody and parenting time decisions impact children and families for the rest of their 

lives, often influencing future inter-generational patterns.  Given such potential life-altering 

effects, a thorough analysis of the complex and dynamic factors associated with the emotional 

well-being of children is an essential prerequisite to any legislative changes to Oregon’s current 

custody laws.    

To promote “best interest” provisions and positive post-separation adjustment, decisions 

guided by social science research that incorporate individual features of specific families are 

CUSTODY & PARENTING TIME REPORT OF SFLAC PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT WORKGROUP –  PAGE  2 OF 13  

optimal. Oregon’s current legislative scheme, outlined in ORS 107.137, permits the application 

of new knowledge to the existing “best interest” standards. 

Reliable empirical research has emerged over the past three decades that is highly 

relevant to the selection of parenting time schedules and legal authority arrangements.1  Of 

particular importance and application are studies regarding resiliency and risk to children of 

divorce.  The robust finding that the majority of children are resilient, adjusting to divorce and 

family changes without signs of acute distress or residual maladjustment, is easily overlooked.2  

Most parents finalize divorce and custody plans without protracted conflict and contentious 

litigation.  This is a protective factor that is strongly correlated with a positive outcome for 

children. 

Other protective factors that increase a child’s resiliency and capacity to withstand the 

potential deleterious effects of divorce are related to both parental attributes and child 

characteristics.  A key determinate to children’s positive divorce adjustment is their parents’ 

ability to shield them from adult conflict and controversy.  At all ages and developmental stages, 

children benefit from parents who minimize discord while focusing on their offspring’s needs 

and interests.  Post-divorce adaptive functioning in children is enhanced by collaborative and 

cooperative parenting efforts.  Parental communication and effective problem solving skills are 

strongly correlated with children’s resiliency and adaptation.   

Another highly influential protective factor is the quality of the parents’ relationship with 

their child.  Empathetic, nurturing, and sensitive parents, who cultivate close and secure 

emotional attachments with their offspring, foster their children’s sense of stability and well- 

being.   

Finally, children’s pre-divorce functioning is an important factor associated with their 

capacity to cope with family changes and disruptions.  Intelligent, sociable, and confident 

CUSTODY & PARENTING TIME REPORT OF SFLAC PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT WORKGROUP –  PAGE  3 OF 13  

children are more able to deflect the impact of parental break-up and maintain emotional stability 

and academic achievement.  Furthermore, as children mature, their preference and satisfaction 

with their parenting time schedule is related to a positive divorce outcome.  Additionally, the 

studies have suggested that continuity of parental involvement and positive affiliation with step-

parents tends to mediate the possible adverse affects of divorce. 

III.  RISK FACTORS 

Unfortunately, children of divorce are at greater risk for emotional and behavioral problems 

when compared to children of intact, two-parent households.  Social science research has identified a 

long  list  of  potential  adverse  reactions  in  children,  ranging  from  acute  anxiety  and  depressive 

syndromes to conduct disorders and school withdrawal.  

Empirical studies consistently cite intra-familial dynamics and parental factors as heavily 

influencing a child’s post-divorce adjustment.  Exposure to domestic violence as well as protracted 

and intense parental conflict adversely impact a child’s capacity to maintain a healthy developmental 

trajectory. Angry, uncooperative, and litigious parents are disruptive to a child’s sense of security 

and stability, frequently creating loyalty binds and untenable triangulation for children.   In some 

children,  chronic  social  maladjustment  and  inability  to  sustain  interpersonal  attachments  in 

adulthood  is  directly  associated  with  the  upheaval  and  distress  of  divorce  they  experienced  as 

Parental factors that impede a child’s normative and functional development include: limited 

emotional  availability,  low  psychological  insight,  immaturity,  deficient  knowledge,  inadequate 

parenting skills, personality disorders, and significant mental illness.  Poor maternal attachment and 

low paternal education also have been correlated with negative divorce outcomes. 3

FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR SHARED CUSTODY & PARENTING TIME 

CUSTODY & PARENTING TIME REPORT OF SFLAC PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT WORKGROUP –  PAGE  4 OF 13 

Research reviewed by this workgroup examined legal custody, shared parenting time 

arrangements, or a combination of both joint custody and shared care arrangements.  Joint 

custody in the research and in this document refers to equally shared decision-making authority 

on the part of the parents.  The majority of the research on shared care arrangements identified 

shared care as any arrangement in which the parenting time ratio constituted a 35/65 percent 

through a 50/50 percent distribution of parenting time.  

In general, shared parenting time schedules are best suited for older children with 

collaborative parents who live in close proximity to each other, permitting environmental 

continuity.4 Consistent school, social, and family relationships tend to promote confidence, ego-

strength, and achievement.  Parents best serve their children’s interests when they practice child-

centric decision-making and implement parenting time arrangements that reflect their children’s 

developmental requirements. 5 

The literature offers significant insight into what works in shared custody and parenting 

time arrangements.  Research has repeatedly shown when certain qualities or factors are present, 

joint custody and shared parenting arrangements can work well.  Those factors include families 

in which: 

•  The parents are mature, insightful, and free of violence, substance abuse, or 

psychological disturbance; 

•  The parents are able to provide warm, sensitive, and responsive parenting; 

•  The parents are committed to shared parenting and enter into the arrangement 

•  The parents experience low levels of conflict and psychological acrimony 

voluntarily; 

between them; 

•  The fathers have a higher level of formal education; 

CUSTODY & PARENTING TIME REPORT OF SFLAC PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT WORKGROUP –  PAGE  5 OF 15  

•  The mothers perceive that the child’s maternal attachment is not being disrupted; 

•  Both parents trust that the child is reasonably safe in the other parent’s care; 

•  Logistical factors such as geographical distance and facility of transitions do not 

constitute barriers.6   

Parents who demonstrate the above traits routinely and successfully enter into joint 

custody and shared parenting time arrangements of their own accord.  When parents do not enter 

into these arrangements voluntarily, ample evidence sugges that compelling such an arrangement 

leads to increased inter-parental conflict, potential disruption in attachment for young children, 

an increase in children’s experience of loyalty conflicts, and a lack of stability in care 

arrangements over time.  These factors all increase the risk of poor child adjustment after 

divorce. The literature consistently shows that forced joint custody and shared parenting time 

arrangements are not good for children.  

V. 

CONTRA-INDICATIONS FOR SHARED CUSTODY AND PARENTING TIME 

Children with pre-existing vulnerabilities, such as cognitive, emotional, or behavioral 

problems are particularly at risk for maladjustment.  The stress and tumult in high conflict, post-

divorce families tends to exacerbate the children’s maladies, frequently requiring remedial 

services and/or intensive interventions to re-direct detrimental patterns.  Shared parenting time 

schedules and joint custody are not suitable for volatile, hostile, and antagonistic parents. 

Children are harmed by repeated exposure to parental enmity, that occurs often in shared custody 

arrangements with chronically discordant parents.  Children under age ten are particularly 

vulnerable because they have not yet developed the internal coping skills or external support 

systems that would help them navigate family conflict.   

Relevant to this discussion are findings that delineate situations in which joint custody 

and care is problematic or contraindicated.7 Where domestic violence, mental illness and high 

CUSTODY & PARENTING TIME REPORT OF SFLAC PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT WORKGROUP –  PAGE  6 OF 13 

levels of inter-parental conflict exist, joint custody and care result in poor outcomes for children 

and parents alike.  These recurrent findings are reflected by the vast majority of jurisdictions in 

which special consideration is given to cases involving such factors and concerns.

Cumulative research finds additional circumstances that contribute to children and 

families faring poorly.  Parenting plans for very young children, those under age four, pose 

unique challenges for parents.  These challenges are exacerbated by the significant 

developmental and emotional needs of infants, toddlers, and preschoolers and the complexity of 

research on what are the best arrangements for children these ages.  There are notable gaps and 

disparities in research results and professional opinions in certain domains.   

Some research suggests that young children with responsive, skilled, and collaborative 

parents are able to adjust, girls more easily than boys, to overnight parenting on a consistent 

schedule with a non-residential parent with whom the child has a strong bond.8  Other research 

evidence indicates that shared overnight care for infants and very young children has a negative 

impact on certain behavioral and emotional outcomes.  In a 2010 longitudinal study, children in 

shared overnight care situations over time reportedly had greater levels of attachment distress, 

anxiety, and lower initiative. 9  Taken as such, an apparent lack of research congruence and 

differing expert opinions can present a confusing picture when parents and the courts endeavor 

to make decisions in a young child’s best interest. 

In other aspects the studies do offer very helpful guidance.  Of special significance is that 

all of the research supports that whenever young children are involved, careful consideration 

must be given to attachment, infant temperament, level of inter-parental acrimony, consistency 

of contact, and the degree to which a parent has the requisite skills to support a child’s transition 

between two households. Clearly, the critical developmental needs of young children, the 

complexity of the clinical findings, and the unique set of parental qualities and attributes 

CUSTODY & PARENTING TIME REPORT OF SFLAC PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT WORKGROUP –  PAGE  7 OF 13 

required to successfully share time with an infant, toddler or preschooler, all reinforce the 

importance of making diligent and individualized decisions about care arrangements. 

Another salient factor is the stability of shared care arrangements over time.  

Longitudinal studies indicate that the majority of families in these arrangements revert from 

shared care to primary care over a span of several years.  The reasons cited were the expressed 

wishes of the children for a primary home or more time with a primary parent, fundamental 

logistical hurdles, and whether or not the families had entered into shared arrangements 

voluntarily. 

Notably, the research finds that joint arrangements entered into willingly by parents were 

two and a half times more stable than their counterparts over time.10  Of considerable concern 

are the findings that shared parenting time compelled by a legislative presumption appeared to 

perpetuate higher levels of inter-parental conflict that increased over time and appeared to 

increase children’s reports of feeling caught in the middle.11  

VI. 

PRESCRIPTIONS FOR TAILORED ARRANGEMENTS 

In summary, social science research strongly supports the conclusion that legal custody 

and parenting time arrangements premised on the needs and attributes of a given family rather 

than statutory presumptions are most desirable.12  Due to the complex and fluid nature of 

families, parental decision-making authority and residential schedules that represent the 

strengths and characteristics of a specific family unit best support positive outcomes for children. 

 Further, arrangements based on the children’s welfare and best interests, including their parents’ 

ability to collaboratively address their developmental needs, are ideal.  Although joint legal and 

physical custody is  optimal for some families, it is unsuitable and detrimental to others.   

A legislative solution requiring  presumptive joint legal and physical custodial 

arrangements is not supported by empirical evidence.  No other state has a presumption that 

CUSTODY & PARENTING TIME REPORT OF SFLAC PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT WORKGROUP –  PAGE  8 OF 13 

andates joint physical custody reaching the level of shared care.  Of the eight states (and 

District of Columbia) that do have presumptions regarding joint custody, none require more than 

a “significant” amount of parenting time for each parent, let alone equal time.  Thus statutes in 

these states effectively create a presumption for joint legal custody, for which Oregon already 

has a statutory preference. Presumptions or preferences for joint legal custody are often easily 

overcome: for example, by a finding of domestic violence or by a finding that joint custody is 

not in the best interests of the child, or, as in Oregon, when parents do not agree.  Moreover, 

there is no evidence that the absence of presumptions in the other forty-one states creates any 

kind of barrier to parents arriving at joint legal custody – nor is there any evidence that Oregon’s 

existing statutory preference is insufficient for this purpose.  Finally, there has been no 

legislative trend toward joint custody presumptions in the two decades since most were enacted 

in the 1970s and ‘80s.  Instead most jurisdictions, including Oregon, avoid “one size fits all” 

presumptions and encourage custom-tailored arrangements that accurately correspond with a 

    m

child’s best interests.  

VII.  FUTURE TRENDS: 

Oregon families are well served by our current statutory requirement for mediation and 

parent education.  Most parents avoid the need for custody evaluation and litigation by working 

together, often using mediation to establish practical arrangements that benefit their children. 

These families recognize the importance of cooperative care of their children, mutually 

supporting their healthy development.  This large group of parents accepts responsibility for their 

children’s needs without the imposition of legal presumptions and directives.  

Collaborative parental attitudes and efforts are promoted by parent education that affirms 

the value of working together in a flexible and conciliatory manner.  Recent research highlights 

the benefits of a skills based curriculum to teach pragmatic co-parenting skills.13  Early 

CUSTODY & PARENTING TIME REPORT OF SFLAC PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT WORKGROUP –  PAGE  9 OF 13 

participation in the class strengthens a positive outcome, prompting some states to consider 

requiring parents to simultaneously enroll when filing divorce petitions.  At a minimum,  parent 

education completed prior to mediation is suggested to enhance parental understanding and 

motivation for settlement agreements.  Parent education that occurs as early in the dissolution 

process as possible, even prior to filing, is ideal.  

As Oregon moves toward implementing online court access and procedures, parenting 

education materials will be readily available, along with interactive use of the SFLAC parenting 

plan guides.  These will further enhance the parents’ ability to create plans that fit their 

children’s needs.  Instead of reflecting contemporary knowledge and standards, statutory 

presumptions represent rigid adherence to a bygone era.  Oregon families will greatly benefit 

from policies that encourage parents to use all available resources to create optimal custody and 

parenting time schedules that correspond with their unique circumstances.

There is a high risk to children’s overall emotional well-being in families where 
there is shared care of children and parents demonstrate immaturity and low 
levels of insight, parents demonstrate poor emotional availability to the child,

Conciliation Courts Review 25 (1987): 39-47. The article reviews a longitudinal study of twenty-
six children under the age of five years living in shared care arrangements.  It concludes that 
overall there is no evidence that joint custody protects children from the negative impact of 
parental separation and divorce. Children who did well in joint custody arrangements had parents 
that were highly motivated to make joint custody work, had high levels of investment in the 
child, and were able to protect their children from exposure to conflict. In families where fathers 
had engaged in little primary care prior to separation, mothers struggled for years with fears 
about the quality of care young children were receiving Children younger than age three adapted 
better to the frequent transitions required by joint custody than children aged three to five years. 
The key to success for parents and children was the presence of committed, mature, sensitive 
parenting on the part of both parents.

Courts Review 33 (1995): 415-425.  Johnston’s article is a literature review of six separate 
studies exploring the impact of custodial arrangements on children.  The reviewed studies 
include a combined total of 1,300 subjects representing children ages 3 to 16 years and their 
parents.  The article identifies the following conclusions and recommendations. 

1.  Warm, responsive parenting is the best overall predictor of good outcomes for 
children and is therefore “the domain that should carry the most weight” in 
making decisions about residential arrangements post divorce/separation. 

2.  Children fare better in the care of parents free from psychological disturbance and 

substance abuse. 

3.  Children need arrangements that minimize exposure to inter-parental conflict.  
4.  High conflict parents have poor prognosis for cooperative parenting and make 

poor candidates for joint custodial decision making. 

5.  In families where there is high conflict or poor quality of parenting it is beneficial 

to children to maintain supportive relationships with other positive adults. 

6.  The presence of domestic violence should be addressed by: 

o  parenting plans that address the safety of children and the victim, 
o  sole custody for the non-offending parent, and  
o  supervised parenting time when there is current violence or current threats 

of violence.

The authors summarize two studies commissioned by the Australian Government 
Attorney General’s Department to explore outcomes of different post separation 
parenting arrangements on infants and children.  Findings were drawn from a 
study that examined 131 high conflict families and a second study that randomly 
sampled the parents of 10,000 children between birth and five years of age.  The 
authors cite the following findings: 

1.  Educational and employment resources, geographic proximity and inter-parental 

relationship factors such as mutual respect and flexibility made up the 
“component parts” of dyads in which shared care appeared to “work”. 

2.  Nurturing relationships with each parent and a supportive relationship between 

the parents had a greater impact on children’s overall mental well-being than any 
particular pattern of overnight arrangements. 

3.  However, rigid arrangements, especially those fueled by acrimony and poor 
cooperation, did have a negative impact on children’s overall emotional well-
being.  

4.  Children under age two years living with a non-residential parent only one or 

more nights per week were more irritable and anxious. 

5.  Children age two to three years spending five nights or more per fortnight with 
the other parent had lower levels of persistence in tasks, play and learning than 
their peers, higher levels of distress in their relationship with the primary 
caregiver, and overall problems consistent with attachment distress. 

6.  Negative effects for the four to five year age group were negligible and the 
authors hypothesize that this is due to the development of the capacity to 
anticipate contact with the other parent that developments by preschool age.

Underlying Assumptions,” Family Court Review 47 No. 3 (2009): 389-400.  
McIntosh’s article reviews twenty years of research on the impact of shared care 
arrangements on children and families.  The article also reports on the findings of 
a study of 141 families (276 children) involved in Child Involved and Child 
Inclusive Mediation.  Participants were assessed at the one and four year mark 
post mediation.  Based on the literature review and the study specifically 
described in the article, McIntosh concludes the following: 

1.  Over the four year period, 65% of families reverted from shared cared to primary 

care arrangements.

2.  Overall, shared care arrangements entered into voluntarily were 2.4 times more 
stable over time rather than shared care arrangements imposed by the courts.  
3.  Nearly two times as many children in shared care arrangements wanted to change 

their arrangements vs. children in primary care arrangements. 

4.  Approximately one third of the children in shared cared arrangements expressed 
the desire to see more of their mothers.  One in ten expressed the desire to see 
more of their fathers. 

5.  Over the four year period of the study 45% of all the children in shared care 

arrangements expressed the desire to change their arrangements.  All but one of 
those children wanted more time with their mothers. 

6.  Children in shared care arrangements reported sustained inter-parental conflict 

over the four year period, while children in traditional/primary care arrangements 
reported significant decline in inter-parental conflict.  

7.  Children in shared care arrangements were significantly more likely to report 
feeling caught in the middle than children in primary care arrangements. 

8.  Fathers in shared care arrangements ultimately reported higher levels of ongoing 
conflict over time than their counterparts in more traditional arrangements. 
9.  Mediation that included direct input from the child was significantly more likely 
to result in less than shared care arrangements, i.e. less that 65:35 parenting time 
ratio.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
