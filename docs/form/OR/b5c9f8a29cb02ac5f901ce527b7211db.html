      <pre>SMALL CLAIMS INSTRUCTIONS FOR PLAINTIFFS 
 

If these instructions do not answer your questions, you can call the Oregon State 
Bar 503.684.3763, or go to www.oregonstatebar.org. The website 
www.courts.oregon.gov has several useful resources including links to the Oregon 
Revised Statutes and Oregon Administrative Rules. The court clerk may answer 
questions about filing procedures, but cannot give legal advice. 

mall claims are filed to resolve disputes without a lawyer. Court staff cannot give legal advice. 

You may talk to a lawyer at any time for help with your claim, but lawyers are not allowed to 
participate in small claims hearings without the judge’s permission.  
 

 

 

  The amount claimed (including the value of property) must be $10,000 or less 

o  If you are claiming money and property worth more than $10,000, you cannot file a 

Small Claim. Go to www.courts.oregon.gov, or see a lawyer for advice.  
 

o  Claims for more than $750 and up to $10,000 can be filed in either Small Claims or 

general civil court. Lawyers can represent you in general civil court.  

o  Claims for $750 or less must be filed in Small Claims court. An exception allows these 
claims to be filed in general civil court if the law you are suing under specifically 
allows lawyer fees to be awarded. Talk to a lawyer for more information if you think 
you are entitled to recover lawyer’s fees and want to file a claim for $750 or less in 
general civil court.  

  If you are filing the claim, you are the plaintiff; the party you are suing is the defendant. 

This does not change throughout the case.  

o  Ignore the (Inmate SID #) unless you are an adult in custody. If so, use the “Small 

Claims Instructions for In-Custody Plaintiffs”. 

o  If you are a debt buyer or debt collector acting on behalf of a debt buyer, your claim 
must comply with Uniform Trial Court Rule (UTCR) 5.180(2) and ORS 646A.670. If 
not, your case may be dismissed by the court. Go to www.courts.oregon.gov/utcr for 
details. 

o  If you are filing for a consumer debt but are not a debt buyer or debt collector acting 
on behalf of a debt buyer, the caption must state “SUBJECT TO UTCR 5.180(3).”  

 

  You must make a good faith effort to collect your claim from the defendant before you file. 
Your claim form must include a statement under oath that you tried to resolve the issue 
before you filed a claim.  

  To start a case, fill out the Small Claim and Notice of Small Claim form. 

o  MAKE SURE YOU COMPLETE THE COUNTY NAME AT THE TOP OF THE FIRST 

PAGE OF EACH FORM! 

o  If the defendant is in prison, include the defendant’s SID (inmate ID) number like 

this: (John Smith, SID# 12345) so the papers can be properly directed. 

o  If you are asking for money damages, you must itemize and prove your actual loss. 

Guesses or rough estimates are not good enough. Written professional estimates may 
sometimes be appropriate, such as claims for repair costs to a home or vehicle.  

  Do not request a lump sum where itemized costs are involved. For example, 

do not claim “damage to my house: $4,000.” Instead, list the individual costs 
–“Drywall repair $800; Plumbing replacement $1,000; Roof repair $2,000; 
Repainting $200.”

and Notice when you serve the defendant (see below for information about serving 
the defendant) 
 

  PRINT CLEARLY! Write all names first, middle, last. 

 

 

 

  ALWAYS provide written updates to the court if your phone number or address changes 

  
WHERE DO YOU FILE? 
You must file your claim in the court for the county where either: 
 

  At least one defendant lives or can be found at the time you file this claim OR  

  The damage, claim, or injury occurred OR 

  The defendant was supposed to perform an act under the contract (if your claim is based on 

a contract) 

hen you file, the clerk will give you a case number. Put this number at the top of page 1 of each 
document (where the form says “Case Number”), AND at the bottom of each page of the document 
and all attachments.  

WHO SHOULD YOU NAME AS A DEFENDANT?  
When you file a claim, the names of all defendants must be complete and correct. Use the name 
the defendant used at the time your claim first arose. For example, if your contract is with “Easy 
Pay Way” but it is now out of business and you are suing the owners, name BOTH Easy Pay Way 
and the owners John Smith and Angela Smith.  
You may name as a defendant:  

  An individual person (be sure the spelling is correct and use full, formal names – use “John 

Smith and Angela Smith” instead of “Mr. & Mrs. Smith”) 
 

  An individual “Doing Business As” a different name (you must use both the individual’s 

name and write “dba [the other name],” see next section) 
 

  A corporation (you must also have the name of the Registered Agent, see next section). Call 
the Oregon Corporation Division at 503.986.2200 or go to www.filinginoregon.com to get 
this information. Be sure you have the full, proper name and any initials of the corporation 
(like “Inc.” or “LLC”) 
 

It is up to you to get this information. The court cannot do it for you. 

iling a Small Claim FOR a Business or AGAINST a Business  

If you are filing a claim against a business, check with the Oregon Corporation Division at 
503.986.2200 or www.filinginoregon.com for both corporation and Assumed Business Name

Use the full company name and address, and include the name and address of the Registered Agent 
for the company. The Registered Agent is the person who will actually be served with the copy of 
your claim. All companies must have a registered agent for this purpose. You must serve the proper

agencies. Use the defendant’s full name. Do NOT use acronyms like “DOC” – spell out “Oregon 
Department of Corrections.” Make sure you use the current name of the defendant. If the 
defendant used a different name at the time of the event that you are suing about, then include a 
note with the former name: “Current Agency Name (formerly Prior Agency Name).” 
 

  IF THE PLAINTIFF IS A COMPANY  

Follow the same rules about names if you are filing a claim for a business. If you are a company, 
show your full corporation name as the plaintiff. If you are a partnership or a sole proprietorship, 
name the owner or owners “dba [your assumed business name].”

If you cannot pay the filing fee, you can fill out a Fee Deferral or Waiver Application and 
Declaration. If your fees are waived you do not have to pay. If your fees are deferred you will have 
to pay according to the court’s instructions.  

OW DO YOU “SERVE” THE OTHER PARTY? 

The plaintiff must officially notify all defendants that a case has been filed. This is known as service. 
Important Note: If you are suing the Department of Corrections or any other state agency, you 
MUST serve BOTH the agency and the Attorney General. You must also send copies of anything 
you file to the Attorney General (see below for information about service). 

cceptance of Service – You can ask the defendant to sign an Acceptance of Service form as 
an alternative to formal service. The defendant can accept the claim and other papers from you and 
sign the form to prevent having a sheriff or process server perform service. Signing the 
Acceptance of Service does not mean the defendant agrees with anything in your claim, only 
that he or she received the papers. NOTE: this is NOT required.  

f the defendant does not want to sign the Acceptance of Service, you must use another method. 
There are four ways you can serve a defendant after you file your claim:  

OTE: Serving Public Bodies – If you are suing the state, use personal service to serve the 
Attorney General. Or your server can leave the papers with a deputy, assistant, or clerk at the 
Attorney General’s office. For any other public body, you can use personal service or office service 
on an officer, director, managing agent, or lawyer for any party. If you are suing any state agency, 
you must also serve all papers on the state Attorney General. 

 

1.  Personal Service:  

a. By Process Server: Take a copy of the claim to the sheriff’s office in the county where the 
defendant is located and have a sheriff’s officer serve the defendant. The sheriff’s office 
charges a fee for service. You can also hire a private process server of your choice. 
b. By a Non-Party: Have a competent* person 18 years or older serve the papers. The 

server must be a resident of Oregon or the state where the defendant is. The server 
cannot be a party to the case (plaintiff or defendant), or the lawyer for a party. The 
server cannot be an employee or director/ officer of any party. If you have safety 
concerns, have the sheriff serve the defendant.  

*competent means a person who can understand, remember, and tell others about an event 

 Certificate of Service must be filed with the court by whoever serves the 

defendant, including the date of service and the name of the person served 

2.  Substituted Service: The process server may leave the notice at the defendant’s residence 
(where the defendant normally lives) with someone 14 or older who lives there. The process 
server must also mail a copy of the papers (with a statement of the date, time, and place that 
the papers were served) to the respondent by first class mail. Make sure the process server 
completes a Certificate of Service. The date of service is the day the first class mailing is 
put in the mail. 

3.  Office Service: The process server may leave the papers with someone in charge of the 

defendant’s office or normal workplace. The process server must also mail a copy of the 
papers (with a statement of the date, time, and place that the papers were served) to the 
respondent by first class mail. Make sure the process server completes a Certificate of 
Service. The date of service is the day the first class mailing is put in the mail.

4.  By Mail: Send a copy by certified mail, return receipt requested, Restricted Delivery 

(delivery only to the addressee). You must file proof of service with the court, including 
the signed green card, date of receipt and item number along with a Certificate of 
Service by Mail. If you do not receive the green card back, or if someone other than 
the defendant signed for it, service by mail was not effective and you must try another 
type of service. The date of service is the day the defendant signs the green receipt card. 
 

HE DEFENDANT CAN …  

 Pay the Claim within 14 days of receiving service. This includes your court fees and costs. 

 
Payment should come directly to you. Defendant may provide proof to the court that the claim is 
paid, and you may file a notice with the court to dismiss your claim. You are free to settle with the 
defendant for any amount at this point. If you are suing to return property, the defendant can 
return the property to you. 

Or 

Deny the Claim – A defendant who does not agree with any part of your claim can file a 

response within 14 days of service denying the claim and requesting a hearing or jury trial. 
Defendants may also file claims against you called “counterclaims.” Counterclaims must be related 
to the transaction or event that your claim is about. Jury trials are available only if the amount of 
either the claim or counterclaim is over $750. 

f the defendant denies the claim, you will be notified by mail of the date and time to appear for a 
hearing. If you cannot appear at the time set, you must give a good reason in writing to the court at 
least 14 days before the hearing date.  

f the defendant demands a jury trial, you must file a formal complaint within 20 days after the 
court sends you notice to do so. If you don’t, the case will be dismissed and you may have to pay the 
defendant’s fees plus a prevailing party fee. Be aware that additional fees will be due from you. You 
should see a lawyer. The court does not provide forms or samples of formal complaints.

F THE DEFENDANT DOES NOT RESPOND  
If the defendant does not file a response within 14 days of the date of service, you can ask the court 
to grant you a default judgment.  This means that you win because the defendant did not respond. 
You must file a request for default judgment with the court within 35 days from the date the proof 
of service was filed, or your case may be dismissed without notice to you. You may have to re-file 
your claim and pay filing fees again if this happens.  

or public body defendants – you must send a notice of your intent to apply for default to the 
defendant before filing for default. For state agencies you must also send a copy of the notice to the 
Attorney General. The court cannot issue a default less than 10 days from the day you serve the 
notice on the defendant (and the Attorney General if necessary). You must formally serve this 
notice according to Oregon Rule of Civil Procedure 9. You must also file a proof of service with the 
court. 

ill out the Motion for Default Judgment & Defendant Status Declaration, and complete 

a Small Claim General Judgment. File both with the court clerk. The prevailing party fee is 
listed at ORS 20.190. 

f you request more than 9% post-judgment annual interest, you must provide the court with a 
copy of the contract at the time you request a Default Judgment 

You must provide a Declaration of Non-Military Service before the court can order a default 
judgment. This is part of the Motion for Default Judgment. If the defendant is in active 
military service, you cannot get a default judgment unless the servicemember has waived 
protection under the Servicemember’s Civil Relief Act. This federal law starts at 50 U.S.C. § 3901. 
Your local law librarian can help you find it, or go to www.law.cornell.edu * (under Get the Law 
click U.S. Code, then click Title 50 and Chapter 50). SCRA does not apply to all military 
servicemembers at all times.   

 

If the defendant is in the military, you should see a lawyer before trying to get a default judgment. 
If a default is not done properly, the defendant can re-open the case after returning from service. 
Be aware that if you knowingly make false statements about the defendant’s status, you may face 
both federal and state penalties.  

f you know the defendant is not in the military, you must state facts that explain how you know. 
Some things that are not supporting facts are: he has long hair, he has problems with authority, she 
does drugs, she’s too old, or he is not a U.S. citizen.  

f you have the defendant’s Social Security Number or date of birth, you can go to the Department 
of Defense’s website at https://scra.dmdc.osd.mil/scra/#/home  to find out if the defendant is in 
active service. This site can give you a free statement of service status that you can print out (called 
a “certificate of service” on the website). Attach this statement, or a printout of the screen, to your 
motion. You can also call 571.372.1100 for military verification. Put the date and the name of the 
person you spoke with on your motion. If you don’t have the Social Security Number or date of 
birth, commercial websites may be able to provide information.

If you don’t know whether the defendant is in the military and have checked the website, or don’t 
have the necessary information, mark “I am unable to determine whether this person is in military 
service” and add any facts that you do know. The judge will decide whether to grant the default. 

OU ARE STRONGLY ADVISED TO TALK TO A LAWYER IF DEFENDANT IS IN THE 

MILITARY! Contact the Oregon State Bar at the number above for help finding a lawyer.  

The court will send you a notice telling you whether your default was granted 

* * * * *  

 

EDIATION  

Many courts have mediation programs for small claims.  Some may require mediation before a 
judge will hear your case. If a defendant files a response denying the claim or making a 
counterclaim against you, the court may schedule mediation for both parties. Mediation is 
confidential. 

ediation has many benefits:  

Mediation brings all of the parties together to discuss the dispute with a trained, neutral mediator.  
Mediation offers a last chance to maintain control over the outcome of the dispute before turning it 
over to a judge. Remember, no matter how right you think you are, you may not win the case. 
A mediated agreement is enforceable once a judgment is entered.  

f mediation is unavailable or if you are unable to resolve the dispute through mediation, a trial will 
be set. Be prepared to present your case at the date and time on your notice of trial. 

 

 

PREPARING FOR TRIAL  
Small claims trials are informal so that the parties can handle their own cases. Lawyers cannot 
appear without special permission of the court. The plaintiff first, and the defendant second, will 
present sworn testimony, evidence, and witnesses to the judge. The judge is only interested in facts. 
Your testimony should be brief and to the point. You may use written notes, but do not expect the 
judge to read a written statement.  

You, as the plaintiff, must prove your case. The defendant must prove any counterclaims 
(counterclaims are claims the defendant has against you. They are NOT defenses to your claims 
against the defendant). Come prepared with factual evidence like receipts, a written contract, police 
reports, witnesses, etc.  

Bring the following to support your claim:  
Records, documents, bills, original contracts, photos, written repair estimates, etc. Make copies of 
any material that you may wish to submit to the court and bring the copies AND the originals to 
court. You may also want to bring copies for the defendant’s reference.  
On the day of your trial, be sure to allow plenty of time to get through security and find your 
courtroom. Be prepared to present your case at the time listed on your trial notice. 

nything you present to the court may be viewed by the other party and may become part of the 
public record. It may be possible to protect certain kinds of information from disclosure. Talk to a 
lawyer if you are concerned.

COURTROOM RULES: 

*Appropriate dress is required. See UTCR 3.010 and the local court rules. The judge may 
ask you to leave the courtroom if you are not dressed appropriately.  
*Caps and hats must be removed upon entering the courtroom 
*Food and drinks are not allowed in the courtroom 
*Weapons are not allowed anywhere in the court building 
*Pagers, cell phones, and all other electronic devices that may disrupt court proceedings 
must be turned off (not just silenced, because signals interfere with recordings) 
*Audio or video recording is not permitted without advance permission of the judge 

 
UDGMENT  

Once your trial is over, the judge will make a decision. You could: 

  Lose the case.  You cannot collect money from the defendant if you lose. 
  Win the full amount of your claim 
  Win some of your claim, but not all of it  
  Win either the full amount or some of the amount, and lose against a defendant’s 

counterclaim.   

o  Generally, if you and the defendant both asked for money, the amount you lost 

(counterclaims) will be subtracted from the amount you won.  

o  If the counterclaim is for more than you won, then you may win your claim, but still 

have to pay the defendant money.  For example, if you claim $100 and the 
counterclaim is for $150 and the judge decides that you both win, then you will have to 
pay the defendant $50 ($150 counterclaim - $100 claim = $50).   
 

The judge will tell you who has to fill out the Judgment form. Then the Judgment form has to be 
given to the judge to sign. This form says how much the award is for, and who gets paid (if anyone).  

he “judgment creditor” is the person who gets paid, and the “judgment debtor” is the person who 

has to pay 

he party who wins is the prevailing party. The prevailing party may be entitled to additional 

money called a “prevailing party fee.” The judge may tell you how much the fee is, or you can look it 
up at ORS 20.190. Write that amount in the “prevailing party fee” box.  

OTE: There is NO APPEAL from a Small Claims judgment. The judge’s decision is final. 

OW TO COLLECT AFTER JUDGMENT  

Demand Letter  
Once you receive your notice that the judgment was entered, you must send the defendant a written 
demand for payment. This letter must be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested. The 
Oregon Judicial Department does not provide forms for demand letters.  

eep a copy of the demand letter and the receipt card showing the recipient’s signature. Your 

demand letter should say that you are making a demand for payment and give the debtor the total 
balance due and a deadline (usually 10 – 30 days). The judgment will give you the total amount the 
court entered as due to you. 

f you are still not paid after sending the demand letter, several options are available to you. Go to 
www.courts.oregon.gov for more information.

SATISFACTIONS  
A “Satisfaction” is a form that tells the court that your judgment has been paid (satisfied). You 
MUST file a Satisfaction of Judgment when you have received full payment on the money 
award portion of your judgment. You may also file a Satisfaction of Judgment anytime you receive 
a payment.  A “partial satisfaction” means you have received payment, but not the full amount. A 
“full satisfaction” means the award is paid in full. You must also send a copy of the Satisfaction of 
Judgment to the other party. Satisfaction of Judgment forms are available online or at the court, 
and there is no fee to file this form.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
