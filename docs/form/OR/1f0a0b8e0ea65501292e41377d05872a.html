      <pre>Parenting Plan Enforcement Instructions 
Important Notice about Enforcement of Orders from Another Court. 
To enforce an Out-of-State parenting time order or judgment, you will also have to complete the forms: 
Enforcement of Out-of-State Custody and Parenting Time Orders.  The forms are available on the court website 
www.court.oregon.gov/courts/washington or from the Family Law Assistance Program.   
If the order was entered in another Oregon county, you will need to file a request to transfer with the court that 
entered the order (Change of Venue/Transfer Case). 

STEP 1 – FILLING OUT THE FORMS 

For all cases, if the copy of the parenting time judgment or order you attach to your motion contains 
confidential personal information, you must redact—black out or erase—that information.   
You must fill out and file a Confidential Information Form (CIF) for each party and must serve the other 
party with a Notice of Filing of Confidential Information Form (CIF).  See the CIF forms and CIF 
information sheet for the type of information that must be protected. 

If your case involves a Washington County, Oregon order/judgment, fill out the following forms: 
• Motion and Declaration in Support of Order to Show Cause Re: Enforcement of Parenting Time
• Order to Show Cause Regarding Enforcement of Parenting Time
• Confidential Information Form (CIF) (one for each party)
• Notice of Filing Confidential Information Form

The case party information does not change, it is the same as when parenting time was ordered.  If you 
were the Petitioner when the case started, you remain the Petitioner.  If you were the Respondent, you are 
still the Respondent.  Use the same court case number from the original parenting time order/judgment. 

DO NOT fill in the section that sets the hearing date or the judge’s portion of the Order to Show Cause. 

Attach a copy of the order/judgment that established the parenting time that you want to enforce to the 
original Motion and Declaration in Support of Order to Show Cause Re: Enforcement of Parenting Time. 

STEP 2 – FILING THE FORMS 
Forms will be filed with the Domestic Relations Department during regular business hours.  The filing fee 
is paid when the forms are filed.  There will be a signed Order to Show Cause, which grants or denies the 
motion.  Check back in approximately two weeks to see if the order is signed.  If the order is granted, you 
must officially notify the other party.  This is called “service”. 

STEP 3 – NOTIFYING THE OTHER PARTY (SERVICE) 
The Domestic Relations Department will provide a ‘Service Packet’ copy of all filed forms (except CIFs).  
NOTES ABOUT SERVICE:  
1) You CANNOT serve the forms yourself, unless the other party signs an Acceptance of Service form.
2) Service may be done by any competent person, 18 or older, that lives in the state where service is done.
3) Service may be arranged with a local sheriff’s office or a private process server.
4) A Certificate of Service will be filled out by whoever does the service and must be filed with the court.

You must appear at the scheduled hearing or the request to enforce parenting time may be denied.  

STEP 4 – ATTEND THE HEARING 

STEP 5 – SUPPLEMENTAL JUDGMENT 
After the hearing, the judge may require that you prepare the Supplemental Judgment Re: Enforcement of 
Parenting Plan form, or the judge may prepare the form.   
NOTE: You must give the other party opportunity to review the judgment before filing it with the court. 
(See UTCR 5.100 for information)   

Parenting Time Enforcement Instructions — Page 1 of 2 (February 2020) 

Most court files may be viewed by the public.  Uniform Trial Court Rule (UTCR) 2.130 requires certain 
confidential personal information to be protected from public disclosure.  That is done by providing the 
information in a separate form.  After you file your papers, the court keeps the form separate from the part 
of the court file that may be viewed by the public.  The form is UTCR Form 2.130.1, known as the 
Confidential Information Form, or CIF. 

What information does a CIF make confidential? 

The information protected by the CIF is social security numbers, birth dates, driver license numbers, and 
former legal names.  Also protected are the name, address, and telephone number of a party’s employer. 

The CIF should only be used to protect the information described above.  There may be other information 
in your court papers that you do not want the public to be able to see, such as bank account or credit card 
numbers.  The separate process for protecting that information is described in UTCR 2.100. 

How do I know when I need to put information in the CIF?  

When a document filed with the court requires you to include information protected by a CIF, that 
information must only be provided to the court in a CIF and must not be listed in any other document to 
be filed.  Where you would otherwise provide the information in the document to be filed you must make 
a note that the information has been provided in the CIF.  For example, if a document requires a party’s 
full social security number to be listed, you must not list the social security number, but must instead 
make a note on the document that the information has been filed under UTCR 2.130.  The online court 
forms already have that note on the form. 

Do I need to file more than one CIF? 

In most cases, yes.  You must fill out a CIF for yourself, and if the documents you are filing with the court 
require confidential personal information about the other party, you must also fill out a separate CIF with 
the other party’s information.  If your case involves children, you should include their information in your 
CIF.  You do not need a separate CIF for your children. 

If there is CIF information you do not know when you file your papers, or if the information changes 
during your case, you must file an amended CIF that provides the new or updated information. 

The CIF rule requires you to redact—black out or erase—confidential personal information from any 
attachments to documents you file with the court and to make a note on the attachment that the 
information has been provided in the CIF.  The only exception is when you are required to attach a court-
certified document.  Documents that are required to be court certified should not be altered in any way. 

Does the other party get copies of a CIF I file? 

You are not required to serve the CIFs on the other party, though you may share a CIF with the other party 
if you chose to do so.  You are required to serve the other party with UTCR Form 2.130.2, which is a 
notice that a CIF has been filed.  You must also file a certificate with the court showing that you served 
the other party with the notice that a CIF was filed.  

There are steps the other party and other people can go through to ask the court to allow them access to a 
CIF that you have filed.  UTCR 2.130 explains that process in detail and describes the circumstances 
under which the court must deny a request by someone else to view a CIF you have filed.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
