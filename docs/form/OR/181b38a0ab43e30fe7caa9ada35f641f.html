      <pre>The courts use Webex to host these remote hearings. Webex may be 
joined from a computer, mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet, 
or through audio by phone.

his guide is for persons (litigants) with a case scheduled for a remote hearing and who are not an attorney or 

witness. A hearing is remote when one or more people participating in the case appear by video or phone. 
Occasionally, everyone participating will appear by video or phone. If the hearing is fully remote, litigants, 
attorneys, and witnesses will not participate from the courtroom. 

  T

Before the Remote Hearing 

 

• 

Contact the court or, if you have an attorney, ask your attorney to contact the court, if any of the following apply: 

o  Your contact phone number or email address changes. 
o  You are unable to find a private, quiet location with reliable internet connectivity or phone coverage. 
o  You do not have a phone or reliable phone service. 
o  You do not have childcare or coverage for other caregiver responsibilities. 
o  You require an interpreter and the language required, for yourself or a witness. 
o  You need any ADA accommodations. 

•  Make sure you are in a private, quiet location where there are few interruptions and distractions so that you can fully 

participate in your case. 

•  Make sure that whatever device you use to connect to the remote hearing is charged and has a reliable internet connection. 
•  Do not share the hearing invite, link, or password with anyone. Contact the court if you think someone else needs the 

remote hearing information. 
If you are joining by smartphone, download the free Cisco Webex Meetings app. 
Test your audio and video prior to the scheduled remote hearing time at https://www.webex.com/test-meeting.html. 

• 
• 
•  Have the court phone number available. If you have technical issues or your connection drops, you should call the 

court. 
If you are represented by an attorney, talk to your attorney about how you will communicate privately during the 
remote hearing. 

During your Remote Hearing 

Connect to the remote hearing 5 to 10 minutes early to test your connection and resolve any technical issues. 

• 
•  Use headphones equipped with a microphone, if possible. Your voice will be clearer when you talk, and participants in 

the case will be able to hear you better. 
Confirm that your microphone and webcam are on and the speakers are turned up. 
Confirm that audio and video are turned on in Webex, so everyone in the hearing can see and hear you. This can be 
managed through the Webex controls. 
After you make sure that audio and video are working, mute your audio until the judge or other court staff asks you to 
talk. 

•  Mute any other devices that you have in the room. Having a second set of speakers will cause a feedback loop, or 

• 
• 
• 

high-pitched squeal. Other devices may also create an echo. 
Court may not start right away, please be patient and wait. The court may be finishing another hearing. 
Court will begin by taking a roll call of the participants. The judge will give everyone an opportunity to speak. 
Everything you say will be recorded. Do not participate in any conversations during the hearing that should not be part 
of the court record. 
Say your name each time you start talking, by saying, “This is _______,” so that the record (recording) is clear about 
who was talking. 
Stay on mute until you are called on and remember to mute after you are done speaking. 

• 
•  Only one person at a time should talk, and participants must take turns. You should pause 1 to 2 seconds before 

• 

talking in case there is a delay.

Inform the court if you cannot hear, if your phone or computer are cutting out, or if you have other problems with the 
technology. It is important that you are able to participate. 

•  Do not record the hearing without official approval from the court. 
•  Do not broadcast or live stream the hearing. 
•  Do not use a speakerphone. 
• 

If you are connecting by telephone, do not place the call on hold at any time. 

General recommendations when joining a remote 
hearing by video: 
o  Dress appropriately as if you were in a courtroom; 

Additional recommendations when joining from a 
mobile device: 
o  Hold still while appearing via video; moving around 

a solid color is recommended. 

o  Be aware of what is behind you, find a solid color 

is distracting to the other participants. 
o  Keep the camera pointed at your face. 

o  When you talk, look directly at the camera, not at 

wall if possible. 

the screen. 

If you are having a hard time hearing, mute your computer microphone with the Webex controls, and call the phone 
number for the remote hearing. Before you call the phone number, let the judge know that you are having trouble 
hearing and will be calling in. You can participate through by phone and still use video through the computer.

If an interpreter is included as part of the remote hearing, speak slowly and in short sentences. 

• 
•  When speaking, say 1 or 2 sentences and stop to allow the interpreter time to translate. 
•  Wait for the interpreter to finish their interpretation before talking or answering a question. 

 

Interpreters 

Witnesses 

• 
• 

If you are represented by an attorney, your attorney will contact the court to prepare for witnesses. 
If you are not represented by an attorney, check with the court regarding the steps for witnesses. 

If ordered, provide the witness list to the court prior to a remote hearing. 

o 
o  Ask your witnesses for the best phone number and email to reach them for the remote hearing; provide this 

contact information to the court. 

o  Witnesses are generally not allowed to hear other witnesses on the case. Let the court know if a witness is 

watching the hearing and needs to be removed from the courtroom. 

o  Witnesses should be available at the phone number that was provided to the court during the scheduled 

remote hearing time. This way the witness can receive information on the appropriate time to join or for the 
clerk to conference them into the remote hearing.

• 
• 

If you are represented by an attorney, your attorney will submit exhibits to the court.

Sharing Video in Webex  
Sharing video is slightly different from sharing any other type of content. Before sharing a video in a remote hearing, review the 
following recommendations to make sure the video will be able to be viewed successfully. 

It is recommended that:

You have a minimum internet speed of 10Mbps download and 3Mbps upload  
You join on a computer, preferably a computer made within the last 2-3 years 
You contact the court to set up a test session for video sharing before the remote hearing 

• 
• 
• 
• 
•  A video at 720p definition should be a file size of roughly 5MB per minute of video, this means that an hour-long video 

should be around 300MB (sizes may vary up to 18% either smaller or larger). 

Webex Meetings has a sharing mode that is optimized 
for video. To determine if the remote hearing will be 
held in Webex meetings, contact the court.  

1. 

Select Share from the bottom menu bar.
