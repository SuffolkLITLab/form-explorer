      <pre>RESIDENTIAL EVICTION INFORMATION FOR 
LANDLORDS 
An eviction is formally called an FED (Forcible Entry and Detainer). It is a complaint filed with 
the court to remove a tenant from property owned or managed by the person filing the 
complaint. This form is for residential evictions only – DO NOT use this form for a 
commercial property, group home, farm, vacation rental, social or fraternal home, or to remove 
a “squatter.”  

 

OURT CLERKS CANNOT GIVE LEGAL ADVICE! 

andlord/Tenant law is very complex and detailed. Most of the laws are in chapters 90 and 105 

of the Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS). You must also follow other laws, procedures, and prior 
appellate court decisions, including the Oregon Evidence Code (OEC), the Uniform Trial Court 
Rules (UTCR), and the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure (ORCP). 
(www.courts.oregon.gov/rules/Pages/default.aspx). If you do not follow the laws exactly, the 
court may order you to pay the tenant’s lawyer fees. You are strongly urged to talk to a lawyer 
before you try to file an eviction on your own.  

ontact the Oregon State Bar at 503.620.0222 or (in Oregon) 800.452.8260 or go to 

www.oregonstatebar.org for information and help finding a lawyer. 

ollowing these instructions will not guarantee that you win your case. These 

instructions are general and may not apply in a given situation. YOU are responsible for getting 
legal advice about how to properly evict a tenant. These forms do NOT provide legal advice and 
the Oregon Judicial Department is not responsible for the outcome of your case if you rely on 
these forms. 

The landlord is the plaintiff, and the tenant is the defendant throughout the case 

 judgment for the plaintiff (landlord) will be for return of the property and the costs of filing 

and serving the complaint. To collect back rent or damages, you must file a separate civil 
complaint. A judgment for the defendants (tenants) generally means that they do not have to 
move out of the property. It may also include the cost of responding to the complaint and lawyer 
fees.  

ees 

  F

If you are low-income, you can ask the court to defer or waive payment of filing fees. Fill out and 
submit an Application and Declaration for Deferral or Waiver of Fees, and an Order 
Regarding Deferral or Waiver of Fees to the court clerk when you file your Residential 
Eviction Complaint. Your complaint will not be filed until you have paid the filing fee or the 
court grants your application for deferral or waiver.  

IRST: Give the defendant (tenant) an eviction notice  

You must give written notice to the defendant (tenant)  
 

  Your notice must be properly prepared and follow both the statutes (laws) and your 
rental agreement. You should talk to a lawyer about how you can give the defendant 
(tenant) notice. Not all notices can be delivered in the same way.  

  Specific laws may allow you to proceed with another type of notice or no notice in some 

situations. Talk to a lawyer about these kinds of evictions.

Statutes - www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors090.html 

If you have questions about which type of notice you need to give, see a lawyer or contact the

  R

Notices can be purchased at most office supply stores. You can write the notice yourself if all of 
the information required by the law is included.  

Timing of the notice deadline 
  Your notice must specify the date and time that it expires. You must give the defendant 

(tenant) the amount of time required by the laws. 

  When counting time, Day 1 is the day after notice is given. 
  If you mail the notice, add 3 days to the minimum time required by the law (see list above). 

So if you are mailing the notice, you must allow 4 days before you begin counting the 
defendant (tenant)’s time to respond. 

  If your notice period is given in hours rather than days (in the list above or other law you are 

using), then the time begins immediately when you give notice except 
  For 72-hour or 144-hour non-payment notices, the time begins at 11:59 pm on the day 

you serve. Talk to a lawyer for information about this type of service.  

  The last day does not end until midnight. 

SECOND: File a Residential Eviction Complaint if necessary  
  After the time specified in the notice has passed, if the defendant (tenant) has not left the 
property you may file a Complaint with the court for the county where the property is 
located.

must have expired before you file. 

  Complete the veteran’s services contact information on the Summons. Go to 

https://www.oregon.gov/odva/Services/Pages/County-Services.aspx for information. 
Include contact information for the county where Defendant lives. 
  Along with the Complaint, you must give the court clerk the following:  

  Copies of the notice: 

  3 copies if there is one adult defendant (tenant) plus  
  An additional copy for each additional adult defendant (tenant) (so if there are 2 

adults, you need to file 4 copies (3 initial plus 1 additional)) 
  The address of the premises (if there is no street address, see a lawyer)  
  A separate mailing address for the defendant (tenant) if the defendant (tenant) does not 

receive mail at that property and 

  The filing fee. Courts accept cash, credit and debit cards, and checks or money orders 

made payable to the State of Oregon. Go to www.courts.oregon.gov/Pages/fees.aspx.  
 

The court clerk will usually set a court date for 7 -14 days from the judicial day after you file and 
pay the filing fee. A judicial day is a day that the court is open for regular business.  

he clerk will give you the original Summons and copies of the Complaint for service on the 

defendant (tenant).  

OW DO YOU “SERVE” THE DEFENDANT (TENANT)? 

ou must officially notify all defendants (tenants) that a case has been filed. This is known as 
service. Service rules are different for FED cases than for other cases. You must complete service 
by the end of the judicial day after the day you filed your Complaint.  

 

1.  Personal Service:  

a. By Process Server: Take a copy of the Summons and Complaint to the sheriff’s office in 

the county where the property is located and have a sheriff’s officer serve the 
defendant (tenant). The sheriff’s office charges a fee for service. You can also hire a 
private process server of your choice. 

b. By a Non-Party: Have a competent* person 18 years or older serve the papers. The 

server must be a resident of Oregon or the state where the defendant is. The server 
cannot be a party to the case (plaintiff or defendant), or the lawyer for a party. The 
server cannot be an employee of anyparty. If you have safety concerns, have the sheriff 
serve the papers. 

*competent means a person who can understand, remember, and tell others about an event 

 

A Certificate of Service must be completed and filed with the court by whoever serves 
the defendant (tenant). If the server is not a sheriff’s officer, then you must also include 
the address and phone number of the server. This form is available online or at the court.  

2.  Posting: If the defendant (tenant) cannot be personally served, the process server may 

post the notice at the main entrance of the defendant (tenant)’s part of the premises. This 
means that if the property is an apartment, it must be posted on the front door of the 
apartment, not of the whole building.  
 

Service must be completed by the end of the judicial day after you file the Complaint

FIRST APPEARANCE and MEDIATION 
  If the defendant (tenant) leaves the property before the court date, you have two options:  
  Go to court on the date specified and request a judgment and money award for your 

costs of filing and service or 

  Have the case dismissed. Send a written notification with your signature to the court 

clerk, directing the court to dismiss your complaint. 

ou must appear at the time noted on the Summons. If you do not appear, the court will dismiss 

  If the defendant (tenant) does not move, does not appear in court, and has not reached an 

agreement with you, the judge may require the defendant (tenant) to leave the property and 
pay your costs. See the next section about the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. 

  If the defendant (tenant) does appear in court to oppose the eviction, the judge may require 
that you try to reach an agreement. Some courts may have a mediator available. Check with 
your local court to see if it offers this service. A mediator can help you resolve your dispute, 
but cannot make decisions for you or order either party to do anything. Mediation is 
confidential. If you do not reach an agreement, the defendant (tenant) will have to file an 
answer with the clerk, who will provide you with a copy. The case will then be set for trial on 
another day.   

  NOTE: if you get a money judgment and the defendant (tenant) pays it, you MUST file a 
Satisfaction of Money Award with the court. This form is available online or at the 
court.  
 

ervicemembers Civil Relief Act 

The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) may apply to your case. This federal law may not 
allow you to get a default judgment if the defendant (tenant) does not respond. This law starts at 
50 U.S.C. 3901. Your local law librarian can help you find it, or go to www.law.cornell.edu* 
(under Get the Law click U.S. Code, then click Title 50 and Chapter 50). You must provide a 
Declaration of Non-Military Service before a judge can order a default. SCRA does not 
apply to all military servicemembers at all times. If a servicemember has signed the lease, you 
should see a lawyer before trying to evict.  

f you know the defendant (tenant) is not in the military, you must state facts that explain how 
you know. Some things that are not supporting facts are: he has long hair, he has problems with 
authority, she does drugs, she’s too old, or he is not a U.S. citizen. Be aware that if you make 
false statements about the defendant (tenant)’s status, you may face both federal and state 
penalties. 

f you have the defendant (tenant)’s Social Security Number or date of birth, go to the 
Department of Defense website at https://scra.dmdc.osd.mil/scra/#/home to find out if the 
defendant (tenant) is in active service. This site can give you a free statement of service status 
that you can print out (called a “certificate of service” on the website). Bring this statement or a 
printout of the screen to court. You can also call 571.372.1100 for military verification. Put the 
date and the name of the person you spoke with on your motion. If you don’t have the Social 
Security Number or date of birth, commercial websites may be able to provide information.

If you don’t know whether the defendant (tenant) is in the military and have checked the 
website, or don’t have the necessary information, check “I am unable to determine whether this 
person is in military service” and add any facts that you do know. The judge will decide whether 
to grant the default.  

OU ARE STRONGLY ADVISED TO TALK TO A LAWYER IF A DEFENDANT 

(TENANT) IS IN THE MILITARY! Contact the Oregon State Bar at the number on Page 1 
for help finding a lawyer.  

RIAL 

At trial, the judge will hear evidence and testimony, and will make a decision (called the 
“judgment”). Both parties may present physical evidence (like photographs, rental agreements, 
and the eviction notice) and call witnesses. You may read from a prepared statement or refer to 
notes, but do not expect the judge to read your notes or any witness statements.   

he plaintiff (landlord) must prove the case, so be prepared to show that you own or manage the 

property, and facts supporting eviction, including proof of proper notice. Anything you present 
to the court may be viewed by the other party and may become part of the public record. It may 
be possible to protect certain kinds of information from disclosure. Talk to a lawyer if you are 
concerned. 

he Oregon Evidence Code (OEC) and Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure (ORCP) govern how to 
admit your evidence and what you need to prove. Talk to a lawyer about how to properly prove 
your case. You may believe that the facts are on your side, but if you don’t follow proper court 
procedures, you may lose anyway.  Links to these rules are on Page 1 of this form. 

f the judge decides in favor of the defendant (tenant), the court may dismiss the case and 
require the plaintiff (landlord) to pay the defendant (tenant)’s costs and lawyer fees.   

f the judge decides in favor of the plaintiff (landlord), the court may order the defendant 
(tenant) to leave the property (move out). The defendant (tenant) may also have to pay the 
plaintiff (landlord)’s costs and lawyer fees.
