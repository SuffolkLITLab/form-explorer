Introduction

2016  was  a  year  of  significant  accomplishment  for  the  Oregon  Judicial 

Department.  Among  other  things,  we  completed  statewide  implementation 

of  our  new  Oregon  eCourt  system,  opened  two  new  state  bond-supported 

courthouses, worked in numerous forums to improve treatment of children and 

youth in the justice system, and made a formal commitment to examine and 

improve awareness, inclusion, fairness, and access to all in Oregon courts. Each 

of these efforts reflects the various ways in which the Judicial Branch endeavors 

each day, to accomplish its mission and adapt to the needs of the people who 

must use and rely on access to justice.

Oregon  eCourt  has  provided  more  convenient  and  efficient  access.  Litigants 

can electronically file case documents from remote locations at any time of the 

day  or  night  and  remote  electronic  access  to  public  court  case  documents  is 

accessible to Bar members, government users, and others.  The public can access 

court calendars remotely and can access court case documents electronically at 

the courthouse. OJD is also expanding its use of online interview-based forms 

to help people without attorneys file pleadings. The forms are easier to fill out, 

contain  all  the  required  information,  and  reduce  time  spent  tracking  down 

missing  or  illegible  information.  We  are  continuing  to  make  court  business 

processes more consistent statewide, to make it easier for attorneys who practice 

in multiple counties to meet procedural requirements.

Oregon’s  newest  courthouses  promote  safe  physical  access  to  justice.  These 

courthouses  are  designed  to  protect  against  seismic  threats  and  to  reduce 

the  instances  where  criminal  defendants  come  in  close  proximity  to  victims, 
witnesses,  jurors,  judges,  and  staff.  The  courthouses  also  include  design  and 

technology upgrades to allow people to find their way in the courthouse more 

easily and provide better access for people with disabilities.

Procedural  access  and  inclusiveness  are  other  aspects  of  access  to  justice  on 

which OJD is focusing attention. In some cases, procedural fairness can include 

having an attorney present to represent a party.  This is especially true in juvenile 

dependency  cases,  where  the  Department  of  Human  Services,  families,  and 

the  children  themselves  can  benefit  from  legal  representation.  The  Oregon 

Legislature has encouraged additional work in these areas, and the courts are 

playing a prominent role.  

In other instances, a more informal process can lead to better results. Deschutes 

County has a pilot project where people involved in marriage dissolution and

Vision

Oregon 
eCourt
A Technology and Business 
Success Story

As early as 2006, the Oregon Judicial Department developed plans to replace 

its aging case tracking system, the Oregon Judicial Information Network (OJIN) 

that  held  OJD  circuit  court  and  tax  court  case  information  dating  from  the 

1980s — including judgment entries, dockets, citations, complaints, and court 

orders for both the trial and appellate courts. Implementation of an electronic 

court  system  (termed  Oregon  eCourt)  would  move  OJD  from  a  paper-based 

system to a paperless electronic system that would manage the intake, storage, 

security,  distribution,  publishing,  and  electronic  retrieval  of  documents  more 

efficiently for court staff and judges, and would allow improvements in public 

access to the justice system. 

The standard court technology approach at that time was to purchase separate 

best-of-breed software components for each application area (case management, 

financial, content management) from different vendors, and then the in-house 

Enterprise  Technology  Services  Division  (ETSD)  would  interconnect  their 

separate functions (if possible) into a single working system. That process became 

time-consuming and costly, results weren’t always satisfactory, and budget cuts 

caused  by  the  2008–2009  economic  downturn  forced  OJD  to  reverse  course 

and search for a less costly and more effective way to implement Oregon eCourt. 

And, by that time, OJD had installed several components of a “proof of concept” 

for Oregon eCourt in the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals — including 

integrated  case  management,  court  management,  and  eFiling  systems  from  a 

single vendor, LT Court Tech (now Thomson Reuters).

experienced  in  state  court  implementation  successes  (although

court  in  the  country  to  implement  statewide  processes  and 

eCourt  software  would  also  replace  OJD’s  aging, 

configuration  in  36  courts  at  the  same  time).  The  new  and

Government implementations of new technology systems have a longstanding 

reputation as high-risk and failure prone. Sources of risk include the sheer size 

and complexity of government organizations and the data they store and work 

with — some of which may be sensitive; the difficulty of transferring data from 

legacy Cobol-based systems — a 50-year-old programming language that cannot 

be integrated with the more efficient 21st century programs; managing the effect 

of a technology replacement on a large number of internal and external users; 

and  procurement contracts with software vendors that typically lack specified 

delivery and performance requirements, giving project implementation control 

to the vendor and putting the organization’s project success at risk.

OJD’s final implementation plan for Oregon eCourt technology was successful 

— receiving high praise from members of Oregon’s Legislative Assembly and the 

Joint Ways and Means Committee that funded the state bonded project. It has 

been viewed as the most successful State of Oregon technology project in recent 

years, and our project processes have been recommended to other state agency 

technology projects.  

Keys to Success

How did we implement the successful enterprise-wide business change? Careful, 

steady  planning;  participation  by  the  entire  organization  in  36  courts  across 

the  state;  inclusion  of  internal  users  and  external  stakeholders  in  decision 

making; enhanced statewide training, including organizational and operational 

readiness;  forming  a  network  of  implementation  teams  for  each  component 

and  process;  management  teams;  Oregon  eCourt  leadership  guidance  from 

the  Executive  Sponsors;  advisory  committees;  and  a  Consistency  Committee 

Guiding Principles
Guiding  principles  provide  leadership  with  the  opportunity  to 

set a unique list of “house rules” regarding how the organization 

(or  group  within  an  organization)  should  uniformly  proceed 

as  they  work  together  to  achieve  a  united  action.  The  Oregon 

eCourt  Executive  Sponsors  (that  included  the  Chief  Justice  of 

the Oregon Supreme Court, the State Court Administrator, and 

two presiding judges from the circuit courts) established a set of 

Guiding  Principles  for  the  implementation  of  Oregon  eCourt, 

through  an  established  Oregon  eCourt  Project.  The  principles 

served to define our priorities and how we should use and adhere 

to them as we collaborated with Tyler Technologies to achieve full 

implementation of Oregon eCourt.

The Law and Policy Workgroup
As part of planning for the Oregon eCourt Project, OJD created 

a Law & Policy Workgroup (LPWG) to identify and recommend 

law  and  policy  positions  and  changes  necessary  to  support  an 

electronic  court  environment,  and  to  identify  and  facilitate 

adoption of court business processes that could be standardized 

to  accommodate  a  statewide  technology  system.    Membership 

includes  judges;  trial  court  administrators;  circuit  court,  Tax 

Court,  and  appellate  court  staff;  central  OJD  staff;  and  Bar 

members.  Initial  work  in  the  LPWG  focused  on  identifying 

statutory requirements for sealed and confidential treatment of 

certain  case  types  and  documents  and  recommending  security 

court  environment  that  would  include  juvenile 

and  adoption  referrals  (resulting  in  extensive 

statutory  changes);  and  developing  other  related 

recommendations.  As  OJD  began  work  on  the 

statewide  rollout,  the  LPWG  also:  developed 

an  electronic  court  Supplementary  Local  Rule, 

adopted in each court as part of go-live; proposed 

extensive  amendments  to  the  statewide  eFiling 

and  eService  rule  to  ensure  consistency  with 

system  functionality;  drafted  extensive  Uniform 

Trial  Court  Rules  (UTCR)  changes  to  facilitate 

the final transition to a statewide electronic court 

system;  drafted  additional  statutory  and  rule 

amendment  proposals;  worked  collaboratively 

with the OSB-OJD Oregon eCourt Task Force to 

obtain  feedback  on  ongoing  system  functionality 

and  statutory  and  rule  proposals;  and  referred 

statewide  business  process  questions  to  the  OJD 

Court Reengineering and Efficiencies Workgroup 

(CREW).  During  this  same  time,  the  LPWG 

and  its  Statewide  Forms  Subgroup  worked  to 

update  various  online  OJD  forms  packets,  to 

incorporate  statutory  and  process  changes,  a 

standard appearance, as well as to adapt the forms 

to eventual use as interactive forms (iForms).

OJD negotiated a 
deliverables-based contract 
with the Oregon eCourt 
vendor that specified 
requirements for each 
deliverable, paying the 
vendor by deliverable only 
after each requirement 
of each deliverable was 
fully met. This approach 
placed the control 
and management of 
implementation in the 
hands of OJD.

With  the  conclusion  of  the  Oregon  eCourt  statewide  rollout  in  2016, 

LPWG  transitioned  to  a  standing  OJD  workgroup,  continuing  its  previous 

responsibilities;  making  recommendations  to  the  State  Court  Administrator 

and  the  Uniform  Trial  Court  Rules  Committee;  and  developing,  amending, 

reviewing, and making recommendations for adoption of OJD statewide forms, 

including interactive forms (iForms) and online print forms.  

User Buy-In
Organizational Readiness
When an organization’s leaders select a new technology system after carefully 

considering its overall benefits to the organization’s mission and functions, there 

is typically resistance within the organization from those who were not involved 

in the decision-making process, and are not looking at the larger picture. There 

was  resistance  to  (and  support  for)  the  announcement  that  Oregon  eCourt 

would completely transform how the courts conduct business. A new technology 

system, including case management, data codes, and business processes would 

replace the legacy system (OJIN) that OJD staff and judges had become experts 

in utilizing for some 25 years. Internal user acceptance of a new system is critical 

to  its  successful  implementation,  so  the  Oregon  eCourt  project  developed  a 

process to address resistance to change by providing Organizational Readiness 

education  designed  to  systematically  replace  the  unknowns  of  change  with 

knowledge and the tools necessary to deal with it; and later, in Oregon eCourt 

training  in  Odyssey  to  ensure  familiarity  with  the  new  system  in  each  of  the 

circuit courts and the Tax Court. Organizational Readiness education sessions 

were presented to court staff and judges to inform them of practical steps they 

can  take  to  perform  their  jobs  in  the  new  business  environment  created  by 

Oregon  eCourt.  Sessions  included  three  levels  of  education  about  adjusting 

to change: for staff, management, and judges (court leadership). Staff learned 

how to deal with the change in Navigating Change Successfully; management 

learned how to deal with the change and manage those dealing with the change 

in  Leading  and  Managing  Change;  and  judges  learned  how  to  deal  with  the 

change,  manage  those  managing  others  in  dealing  with  the  change,  and  how 

to provide leadership and support for the change in their court with Leading 

Your Court Through Change. Every division in the State Court Administrator’s 

office that worked closely with the vendor’s team on the implementation also 

received Oregon eCourt’s Organizational Readiness education.

mitigation  plans;  lessons  learned;  a  monthly 

vendor  report;  quality  assurance  assessment 

reports;  and 

legislative  oversite  deliverables 

reports.  While  the  report  often  exceeded  60 

pages  (unlike  typical  one-or-two-page  project 

status  reports),  it  gave  OJD  project  committees 

as well as our legislative supporters and those in 

oversight  positions  a  transparent  and  complete 

accounting of the project’s activities and status.

The  Legislature  and  OJD  met  regularly  (outside 

of  budget  hearings)  in  the  first  couple  years  of 

the  Oregon  eCourt  project  to  agree  upon  and 

discuss  deliverables  that  OJD  would  provide  to 

the  Legislative  Fiscal  Office  to  demonstrate  that 

the  Oregon  eCourt  project  was  meeting  their 

expectations  of  progress  while  they  continued 

to approve bond  funding  (this was an important 

exercise  in  gaining  the  Legislature’s  trust  in 

our  project).  OJD  submitted  requested  reports 

and  data  on  the  project  and  supplied  legislative 

committees  with  answers  to  any  concerns  about 

the effects the new court technology may have on 

their constituents.

Vendor Contract
OJD  negotiated  a  deliverables-based  contract  with  the  Oregon 

eCourt vendor that specified requirements for each deliverable, 

paying the vendor by deliverable — only after each requirement in 

each deliverable was fully met. This approach placed the control 

and  management  of  implementation  in  the  hands  of  OJD; 

provided an organized division of implementation activities into 

more  manageable  segments;  and  was  the  basis  for  scheduling 

dates of implementation in each of the 36 courts spread across 

the state as well as the Tax Court. The contract spanned three 

phases to occur over a five-year period — implementation in the 

“pilot court” to prove the solution in 2012; implementation in 

four “early adopter” courts, to prove the implementation during 

2012–2013;  and  implementation  in  the  31  remaining  courts 

and Tax Court in the “velocity” phase between 2013 and 2016. 

Oregon presented a challenge for our vendor and Oregon eCourt 

implementation teams (which was overcome successfully), in that 

OJD’s contract called for implementation of the entire Odyssey 

system in every Oregon circuit court (36 courts widely distributed 

across the state) and the Tax Court, whereas courts in other states 

had only implemented parts of the full Odyssey system.

Legislature 
Building  a  close  working  relationship  with  the  legislative 

committees that gave the go-ahead for Oregon eCourt funding, 

and  the  Legislative  Fiscal  Office,  was  important  to  both  the 

Legislature  and  to  OJD’s  Oregon  eCourt  project.  OJD  gave 

presentation  updates  and  requested  state  bond  and  certificate 

funding  during  biennium  budget  session  hearings,  while 

legislative committees overseeing the funding of Oregon eCourt 

took  the  opportunity  to  ensure  that  all  actions  contributing  to 

the project’s success were being performed.

Legislators  requested  the  development  of  a  lengthy  monthly 

project  status  report  —  a  compilation  of    updates  on  project 

accomplishments; activities of implementation teams; decisions 

log;  budget  numbers  and  variances;  vendor  and  project  team

Without the input 
of judges and staff 
(the people who were 
actually going to use 
the system), and the 
important roles they 
played in implementation, 
Oregon eCourt might 
have been counted 
as one among the 
many failed government 
technology projects. 

External Stakeholder Buy-In
OJD’s  external  stakeholders  affected  by  Oregon  eCourt’s  business 

transformation in the courts included the Oregon State Bar (with whom OJD 

formed an OSB-OJD Joint Task Force on Oregon eCourt); District Attorneys; 

County  Sheriff’s  Offices;  other  public  safety  agencies;  Departments  of 

Revenue,  Motor  Vehicles,  Corrections,  State  Lands  and  Justice;  the  State 

Treasury; Public Defenders Office; the Criminal Justice Commission; and 

bulk data customers (title companies, the media, and collection agencies). 

Overcoming  external  stakeholder  resistance  to  change  is  necessary  in 

developing  and  maintaining  public  support,  which  in  turn  can  make  or 

break  legislative  support  and  funding.  OJD  engaged  in  informational 

communication  with  external  stakeholders  to  help  them  understand  the 

benefits and court vision of the single-solution system, including meetings 

with  local  circuit  court  leaders;  presentations  explaining  the  benefits  of 

Oregon  eCourt;  demonstrations  of  what  the  system  offers  external  users 

and how it would affect them in their business with the courts; press releases, 

newsletters, posters, brochures, and newspaper and magazine articles providing 

updates on Oregon eCourt’s progress. OJD welcomed external stakeholder input 

that helped improve the new system for external users, and allowed stakeholders 

to develop a sense of participation, ownership, and support for the project.

User Participation
The  Oregon  eCourt  implementation  affected  nearly  every  workflow,  every 

business process, every staff person, trial court administrator, and every judge 

in Oregon’s circuit courts and the Tax Court. Without the input of judges and 

staff (the people who were actually going to use the system) and the important 

roles they played in implementation, Oregon eCourt might have been counted 

as a failed government technology project. Some of those statewide efforts by 

judges and staff are explained below:

1.  Before selecting our vendor for Oregon eCourt, we identified 12 teams of 
judges and staff from courts across the state, and sent them requirements 

(things we needed the system to do) for all the different modules and all 

the case types to add, delete, edit, and send the final list back. We ended 

up with 2,700 requirements to see if our vendor’s software — known as 

the Odyssey system — was capable of supporting what OJD needed in a 

statewide integrated technology system.

business processes that, over the years, were entered into the OJIN system 

to serve local court purposes. 

3.  First steps for court staff and judges in their twelve-month process 
preparing for implementation were outlined in an Oregon eCourt 

Implementation Guide. Included was the task of forming a “Local 

Implementation Team” to oversee the court’s preparation activities; 

communicate with CECM, ETSD, and BFSD teams on the court’s 

progress; determine an external communication strategy and arrange 

presentations to inform local community partners (the local Bar, District 

Attorney, Sheriff’s Office and other law enforcement agencies) of changes 

in how they would conduct business with the court after implementation 

of Oregon eCourt.

vendor and OJD implementation teams to review technical readiness, 

court business processes, forms, procedures, and code migration to the 

new system. Configuration and testing activities of the court’s business 

processes were managed by the local court’s designated Subject Matter 

Experts (SMEs), who were trained to manage implementation of all 

court processes including configuration; court forms; data migration and 

conversion; and business processes.

5.  Each court was given a technical readiness review (computers and 

peripherals, servers, network wiring, and bandwidth) attended by the 

court’s technical support specialist; the Trial Court Administrator (TCA); 

the vendor; OJD’s ETSD technical team; and a security assessment that 

was also attended by OJD’s Information Security Officer.

End User Training
Most important to court staff and judges in the adjustment to Oregon eCourt 

was  development  of  new  skills  to  perform  their  jobs  confidently  in  the  new 

Oregon  eCourt  environment.  Judges  and  staff  first  received  Basic  Computer 

Skills training to ensure that they had the necessary computer skills to complete 

Odyssey End User training. (Judge’s jobs in particular had been to that point 

paper-based,  handling  documents  and  case  files;  and  staff  working  with  the 

OJIN system only needed green screen computer skills.) Tyler Technologies and 

the CECM training team then met with each court to develop a training plan 

for each individual in the court based on their key responsibilities. The Tyler

allow judges and staff additional time to reinforce Tyler’s End User 

Training, and gain practice using Odyssey with scenario exercises 

that presented realistic court situations requiring problem solving 

using the court’s new business processes. A minimum of 40 hours 

of training for each staff person was provided; and judges had two 

to three days of training.

As  implementations  continued  across  the  state,  training  teams 

developed  on-demand  training  modules  and  webinars  that 

continue to be created as an online resource to train court users 

on software updates, new statewide business processes, changes 

introduced by UTCRs, and legislative passage of new laws.

that refined the

for each subsequent court.

as needed.

After  pre-implementation  preparations  by  project  teams  and  court  staff  were 

completed  in  a  court  (including  readiness  assessments,  reviewing  business 

processes,  and  training  —  all  usually  within  a  12-month  period)  the  six  day 

process of Go-Live arrived, and teams began OJD’s fine-tuned process for Oregon 

eCourt implementation. Below is a timeline example of how teams coordinated 

and events played out when the Oregon eCourt system was deployed in a court:

Current Benefits of the Oregon eCourt System
About  midway  through  the  five  years  of  Oregon  eCourt’s  implementation, 

benefits enjoyed by the “live” courts were becoming evident to the courts still 

waiting  for  the  new  system.  Live  courts  exchanged  information  and  tips  on 

their go-live and benefits of the system with other courts who wanted advice on 

how to make their implementation process easier. OJD press releases, Oregon 

eCourt Newsletter articles; local county news media, Bar communications, and 

word of mouth spread information on progressive successes, and fixes to glitches 

as implementation of the new system made its way across the state.

For active Oregon State Bar members filing documents in the circuit courts and 

Oregon  Tax Court, mandatory eFiling of  case  documents  began  in the “live” 

courts on December 1, 2014,  and opened statewide on August 29, 2016 when 

all 36 courts and Tax Court had completed implementation of Oregon eCourt. 

In addition to adopting OJD Policy and Standards for Acceptance of Electronic 

Filings  in  Oregon  Circuit  Courts,  OJD  worked  with  the  Bar  and  attorneys 

statewide to propose changes to UTCRs defining formatting and other technical 

requirements, including reducing the time from 10 years to 30 days for retention 

of the hard copies of documents containing the original signature of a person 

other than the filer. Mandatory eFiling for active Oregon State Bar members in 

the appellate courts began on June 1, 2015, with similar rule changes.

Going Forward — Continuing Development
With the completion of statewide implementation, Oregon eCourt begins a new 

phase  involving  system  maintenance  (including  testing  of  new  components, 

upgrades,  and  patches);  improving  the  core  components,  court  business 

processes, and policies for optimal performance of the system; implementation 

of additional capabilities and functions; building judge and staff technology 

Appellate Court 
Technology

In  2011,  the  Supreme  Court  and  Court  of  Appeals  completed 

design and implementation of their integrated case management, 

content  management,  and  eFiling  system  begun  in  2006.  The 

appellate  courts’  Oregon  eCourt  system  creates  an  internal 

electronic case file for each appellate case. Each document filed 

or  issued  in  a  case  is  electronically  linked  to  the  appellate  case 

register, allowing multiple users to access case documents in the 

repository  24/7  from  their  work  computers  or  through  remote 

access.

Benefits include significant time savings for appellate court staff, 

who no longer have to search hard copy case files and documents 

to respond to customer case inquiries or retrieve the physical case 

file from judge’s chambers.

Each branch of 
government in a democracy 
plays a vital role 
in creating a safe, fair,  
and free society. The 
Oregon Constitution 
established the Legislative 
Branch to make laws, 
the Executive Branch  
to administer and enforce 
the laws, and the Judicial 
Branch to resolve disputes 
according to the law.

OJD Structure

The Oregon Judicial Branch, one of three separate but equal branches of state 

government established by the Oregon Constitution, includes a unified statewide 

court system known as the Oregon Judicial Department (OJD). Its judges have 

the responsibility to preserve the rule of law by deciding criminal, civil, family, 

and other types of legal disputes; interpreting and applying the state and federal 

constitutions and statutes; and holding hearings and trials throughout the state. 

The role of the courts is to ensure that all Oregonians receive fair and accessible 

justice while providing due process, protecting individual rights, and preserving 

community welfare.

The OJD system of state-funded courts consists of the Oregon Supreme Court, 

Oregon  Court  of  Appeals,  Oregon  Tax  Court,  and  circuit  courts  (trial  level 

courts), organized into 27 judicial districts. There is at least one circuit court 

location  in  each  of  Oregon’s  36  counties.  The  Chief  Justice  of  the  Oregon 

Supreme Court is the administrative head of OJD. The Chief Justice oversees

the Court of Appeals, the presiding judges of the circuit courts, 

and the State Court Administrator; adopts procedural rules for 

the state courts; and supervises the statewide fiscal plan, budget, 

and resources for all Oregon state courts. 

All  OJD  judges  —  including  those  of  the  appellate  courts,  the 

circuit courts, and the Tax Court — are elected to six-year terms 

in non-partisan elections.

Centralized  administrative  and

Oregon Supreme Court 

The Oregon Court 
of Appeals has continued 
to utilize its highly effective 
and nationally recognized 
mediation program, 
which has allowed parties 
to resolve, on a mutual 
rather than judicial basis, 
civil, domestic relations, 
and workers’ compensation 
cases each year. Those 
cases are frequently among 
the most complex that 
the court would otherwise 
consider.

Oregon Court of Appeals

The  Oregon  Court  of  Appeals  decides  civil  and  criminal  appeals  taken  from 

the circuit courts, as well as cases arising from contested administrative agency 

actions and challenges to agency rules. The members of the court are divided 

into four “panels” (each consisting of three judges) that normally consider all 

matters and cases assigned to them — about 695 cases for each panel per year. 

The Chief Judge  is not a member of any one  panel and  may substitute for a 

member of any panel who is not available or has a conflict of interest. Within 

each panel, one of the judges sits as the presiding judge. Before a panel releases 

an  opinion  in  a  case,  the  proposed  opinion  is  circulated  to  all  the  court’s 

judges. Any one of the judges may disagree with the opinion and refer the case 

to the full 13-judge court to be considered “en banc.” 

The Oregon Court of Appeals has decided an average of 2,732 cases per year 

and is often referred to as one of the busiest appeals courts in the country.

2016 In Review
Judge  Roger  DeHoog,  who  has  served  as  a  Deschutes  County  Circuit  Court 

judge  since  2012,  filled  the  vacancy  left  by  Judge  Nakamoto’s  move  to  the 

Supreme  Court.    Judge  DeHoog  is  the  second  Asian-Pacific  American  to  be 

appointed to the Oregon Court of Appeals. 

Judge  Scott  A.  Shorr  filled  a  vacancy  on  the  court  left  by  the  retirement  of 

Chief Judge Rick Haselton. Judge Shorr has experience as an appellate attorney 

specializing in commercial litigation including class actions and securities fraud.

The Oregon State Bar awarded the 2016 President’s Public Service Award to Judge 

Douglas Tookey “for his commitment to public service and pro bono work.”

In June 2016, the appellate Oregon eCourt system added a component to permit 

remote access to case file documents by certain remote-access subscribers.  Oregon 

attorneys  and  government  partners  can  now  remotely  access  nonconfidential 

documents in Court of Appeals cases, and other authorized users can remotely 

access most of those same documents.

Appellate Settlement Conference Program: The Court of Appeals has continued 

to utilize its highly effective and nationally recognized mediation program, which 

has allowed parties to resolve, on a mutual rather than judicial basis, between 

100  and  150  civil,  domestic  relations,  and  workers’  compensation  cases  each 

year. Those cases are frequently among the most complex that the court would

program has been approximately 70 percent, one of the highest 

2013  after  a  two-year  hiatus  prompted  by  budget 

in the nation. 

Trading  Benches  Program:  The  court  has  developed  and 

implemented this program in coordination with Oregon’s circuit 

court  judges.  Through  the  program,  trial  judges  periodically 

participate  in  the  consideration  and  decision  of  cases  in  the 

Court of Appeals, while appellate judges perform judicial work 

for the circuit courts, including presiding over hearings and trials. 

With a better mutual understanding of the work that other courts 

perform,  expensive  and  time-consuming  reversals  and  remands 

for new trials can be substantially reduced. 

School Program: The Oregon Court of Appeals judges and staff 

regularly travel around Oregon to hear oral arguments in school 

settings  and  talk  with  high  school  and  college  students  and 

community groups about the court’s work and about Oregon’s 

considerations.  Overall,  since  1998,  the  court 

has  held  oral  arguments  at  schools,  universities 

and local courts in more than 60 locations, from 

Astoria  to  Ontario,  from  Portland  to  Spray.  A 

panel of three judges and a staff person work with 

the schools and local courts to schedule the trips. 

The  judges  meet  with  students  who  attend  the 

arguments  to  discuss  the  appellate  process  and 

the court’s work. The students are able to read the 

briefs and court-provided summaries of the cases. 

They discuss them in class before the court arrives, 

integrating the court’s visit into their social studies 

curriculum. The court works to choose cases that 

involve  local  parties  and  attorneys  and  present 

issues that would interest the students.

Oregon Tax Court

The  Oregon  Tax  Court  is  a  specialized  court  with  statewide  and  exclusive 

jurisdiction  over  all  questions  of  law  or  fact  arising  under  state  tax  laws.  It 

is comprised of a Tax Magistrate Division (magistrates are appointed judicial 

officers with training and experience in tax law) and a Regular Tax Division 

(where  cases  are  heard  by  the  Judge  of  the  Oregon  Tax  Court  —  an  elected 

judicial  officer).    The  Tax  Court  has  statewide  jurisdiction  over  cases  that 

involve  Oregon’s  tax  laws,  including  personal  income  tax,  property  tax, 

corporate excise tax, timber tax, local budget law, cigarette taxes, and property 

tax limitations. Decisions of the Magistrate Division may be appealed to the 

Regular Division.  Appeals from the Regular Division are taken directly to the 

Oregon Supreme Court. 

2016 On the Bench
On  March  7,  2016  Oregon  Tax  Court  implemented  the  Oregon  eCourt

Oregon Circuit Courts

The Oregon circuit courts serve as Oregon’s trial courts. Circuit courts decide 

civil cases that arise from disputes involving property, contracts, personal injury, 

family  relationships,  probate,  government  rules,  and  regulations;  juvenile 

matters;  and criminal cases that result from violations of criminal law, including 

felonies, misdemeanors, probation violations, traffic, and other violation cases. 

There is at least one circuit court location in each county.

The Oregon circuit courts are divided into 27 judicial districts, made up of one 

or more of the state’s 36 counties. Most are single-county court districts. Some 

circuit courts in counties with smaller populations and caseloads are combined 

into multi-county districts. Although their geographic areas may be large, the 

number of judicial positions in each district is established by statute. 

Every two years, the Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court appoints or 

reappoints a presiding judge for each judicial district to administer, supervise, 

and distribute the workload within the district. Operations of the circuit courts 

are managed by trial court administrators who are supervised by the presiding 

judge.  Their  duties  include  personnel  administration,  budget  and  financial 

management, court operations, and jury management.

In addition to handling all types of cases, the circuit courts are actively involved 

in both legislatively initiated and court-initiated programs to provide improved 

dispute resolution processes and outcomes for the people and cases that come 

before  them.  The  courts  support,  as  resources  permit,  the  following  types  of 

programs:

•	 Treatment Courts — drug, alcohol, mental health, programs for veterans
Integrated Family Courts — where the same judge is assigned to all cases 
•	

involving a particular family

•	 Other specialized courts or programs — addressing domestic violence, 

services

•	 Arbitration and mediation programs
•	

Jury management programs

Juvenile court improvement programs

•	 Parental education programs

Kingsley W. Click, Oregon State Court Administrator

Oregon’s State Court Administrator supports and assists the Chief 

Justice  in  exercising  administrative  authority  and  supervision 

over the budget and resources of a statewide, state-funded court 

system  that  includes  the  appellate,  circuit,  and  tax  courts;  and 

by establishing and managing statewide administrative programs, 

policies,  and  procedures  for  OJD.  In  this  capacity,  the  State 

Court Administrator supervises administration of OJD’s central 

business and infrastructure services for the court system, such as 

budget, accounting, procurement, grants, human resources, legal, 

audit, statistics, education and outreach, self-represented services, 

information  systems  and  technology,  security  and  emergency 

preparedness,  and  policy  development.  The  Citizen  Review 

Board program and certification programs for court interpreters 

and  court  reporters  also  are  administered  by  the  State  Court 

Administrator’s Office as is the senior judge and pro tem judge 

assignments  program.  Oversight  of  OJD’s  legislative  program, 

providing technical advice and implementation of new laws (by 

changes  to  rules,  forms,  and  programs)  is  also  directed  by  the 

office.

and ensuring adequate legal counsel in dependency cases. 

Judicial Juvenile Engagement and 
Leadership Institute 
JCIP also coordinates and provides support to the activities of the 

Judicial Juvenile Engagement  and  Leadership Institute  (JELI),  a 

judge-led  project  that  works  to  accelerate  juvenile  court  reform 

with the help of judges who actively develop solutions for juvenile 

court system issues. In 2016, JELI provided education for juvenile 

court judges involving juvenile court forms, developmental brain 

science in juveniles, and discussed initiatives for the coming year. 

Communication, Education, & Court 
Management Division
OJD’s  Communication,  Education,  &  Court  Management  

Division  (CECM)  develops  and  coordinates  judicial  and  staff 

education and training programs to ensure that Oregon judges 

and staff are prepared to meet the challenges of new technology, 

greater  public  access  to  the  courts,  wider  engagement  with 

litigants,  outreach  with  government,  community  agencies,  the 

public,  and  navigate  the  incorporation  of  changing  societal 

demands on judicial education. 

•	 Odyssey and Business Processes Training
  During the course of Oregon eCourt implementation, 

from 2011–2016, CECM developed and instructed court-

specific, on-site change management education and business 

processes training labs (statewide in 36 courts) to enhance 

the basic Odyssey training given to all judges and staff by 

our Oregon eCourt vendor, Tyler Technologies. Webinars

Judicial,  Administrative, 
and Staff Education

OJD’s  statewide  implementation  of  the  core  Oregon  eCourt  system  opened 

more efficient pathways through automation for state court business processes, 

court management, online services, technological integration with partners, and 

access to justice. Technology progress and court culture change is demanding 

wider skillsets for court staff, administrators, and judges. More than ever, state 

courts find it necessary to collaborate with public safety partners, government 

agencies,  and  community  services  on  a  variety  of  court-related  social  issues 

where  judges  are  called  upon  to  broaden  their  knowledge  in  non-legal  areas 

of expertise. There are new demands on judges to be accessible court leaders 

in  the  community;  to  work  with  the  Legislature;  and  to  serve  as  experts  on 

progressive task forces, workgroups, and committees that analyze, develop, and 

strategize  the  mastery  of  current  and  upcoming  courtroom  advances.  Such 

emerging responsibilities are framing new roles for the courts and will require a 

committed focus on wider areas of education and training for judges and staff. 

Judicial Leadership & Education Committee
This  year,  Chief  Justice  Thomas  Balmer  charged  OJD’s  Judicial  Education 

Committee  (JEC)  with  determining  the  direction  of  leadership  training  and 

continuing  education  on  leading-edge  issues  facing  our  presiding  judges  and 

judges in the courtroom. “I have renamed the JEC to the Judicial Leadership & 

Education Committee (JLEC) and tasked them with a broader mission — to start 

looking at what we need to do to develop new leaders within the judiciary...all 

of our judges need to understand how to be competent leaders. We also need to 

educate our judges (and staff) on inclusion and fairness issues, access to justice, 

procedural  fairness,  and  so  on.”  The  JLEC  serves  as  an  advisory  committee 

to  the  Chief  Justice  and  works  closely  with  the  Communication,  Education, 

&  Court  Management  Division  (CECM)  in  selecting  educational  topics  and 

speakers for OJD’s yearly judicial education events. 

JCIP’s Juvenile Court Judge Training
OJD’s Juvenile Court Improvement Program (JCIP) produced webinars in 2016 

“It is important for  
all of our judges to be 
leaders…all of us will 
be called upon on some 
occasions to be leaders...
in courtrooms, with 
attorneys, government 
agencies, and in our 
community. We want  
to train our judges across 
the state to be able  
to do the work we are 
called upon to do.”

changes that affect the courts, such as: digital evidence and forensic 

technology; new procedural roles of judges in self-represented cases; 

social media and criminal case investigations; elder abuse reporting; 

the intersection of the Fourth Amendment and technological 

advances; and implicit bias and decision-making in the courtroom.

3.  2016 Judicial Conference
  By Oregon statute, the Judicial Conference of the State of Oregon 

includes all Oregon Supreme Court Justices, Court of Appeals 

Judges, the Tax Court Judge, Circuit Court Judges, and all Senior 

(retired) Judges. The Conference holds an annual meeting to study 

and discuss the current business of the courts — new and updated 

legislation; trends in case law; court procedure and operations; 

caseflow management; and administration practices. Judicial education 

sessions, trainings, and panel discussions are held for several days. 

 

Subject areas studied and discussed at the 2016 Judicial Conference 

included the critical role of judges to ensure justice; the state’s 

crisis of the seriously mentally ill in court; mandatory child abuse 

reporting and the process of the Department of Human Services; 

ex parte matters and matters not appropriate for ex parte decisions; 

judicial analysis of “other acts” evidence; fundamentals of American 

Indian Law; civil motion practice; risk and recidivism in sex offender 

intervention and registration; legal education past and future; and 

recent appellate criminal and civil case updates.

4.  2016 Specialty Courts Symposium
  CECM and the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission (CJC) 

designed this bi-yearly education event for specialty court teams, 

judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, clinical professionals, and 

community partners involved in Oregon’s treatment courts. The 

symposium featured presentations and panel discussions by Oregon 

treatment court judges and local and national experts on treatment, 

quality assurance, incentives and sanctions, ethical issues, and dealing 

with vicarious trauma. Group sessions brought Oregon specialty 

court teams and judges from adult drug court, juvenile drug court, 

veterans court, mental health court, family court, and DUII court

Innovative  
Court 
Programs
Specialty Courts
(Treatment Courts)

The  Oregon  Judicial  Department,  in  collaboration  with  the  Criminal  Justice 

Commission, hosted the 2016 Specialty Courts Symposium in Salem, Oregon 

to  help  expand  the  knowledge  and  skill  of  judges,  specialty  court  teams,  and 

external partners regarding the latest topics, data, and changes that will improve 

the outcomes in our treatment courts. The Symposium brought national experts 

to Oregon who gave presentations on the ins and outs of 21st Century trends in 

treatment courts — how best practices and quality of care are expanding in terms 

of collaboration between treatment courts and providers to identify and treat 

co-occuring disorders, the psychology of incentives and sanctions, customizing 

treatment to assess risks and needs of participants, the appropriate application 

of medication assisted treatment (MAT), and how new brain science factors in 

to trauma-informed care. Oregon treatment court judges on panels and among 

the attendees exchanged ideas on what has and hasn’t worked in their treatment 

courts.

Over  the  last  decade,  the  challenge  for  treatment  courts  has  been  to  focus 

on  adaptation  of  the  drug  court  therapeutic  model  (introduced  in  1989)  to 

Mental Health Court, Veterans Court, Family Dependency Treatment Court, 

DUII  Court,  Community  Court,  and  Juvenile  Drug  Court,  and  customize 

the  model  to  meet  the  specific  needs  of  the  various  treatment  court  types. 

Setting  and  applying  best  practices  for  treatment  courts  was  another  hurdle. 

Oregon published its Oregon Adult Drug Court Standards in August 2016 and its 

Comprehensive Oregon Treatment Court Standards - Mental Health, Family, Veterans, 

“Sometimes topics just 
have their time...
particular truths that 
really set the stage for 
why the interest in 
trauma [informed care] 
is here right now. The 
science of the brain 
has just escalated our 
understanding. We now 
know that so many 
experiences, so many 
childhood experiences, 
and experiences 
that people have in 
adulthood have an 
impact on the brain...”

completely new. Some of the newest ideas included:

A  large  percentage  of  treatment  court  participants  (74–80%)  have  mental 

health/  behavioral  disorders  combined  with  addiction  disorders.  Termed  co-

occuring  disorders,  each  affects  the  other,  and  treatment  court  programs  are 

recognizing that both must be treated or the participant will recidivate. Initial 

assessments can be done to indicate whether the person has dual issues, so that 

courts can ensure that co-occuring disorders will be addressed. Some treatment 

courts across the nation are adapting their programs by implementing specialized 

dockets  for  co-occuring  disorders,  called  dual  treatment  dockets.  These  are 

smaller  dockets  whose  programs  and  treatment  take  a  longer  time.  Sessions 

are  more  numerous,  informal,  provide  education  on  causes  of  disorders,  and 

provide more support and personal conversation with the judge. Another way 

of  creating  a  dual  treatment  docket  would  be  for  established  drug  treatment 

courts  to  develop  a  mental  health  treatment  group  as  part  of  the  drug  court 

program.  Using  trauma-informed  treatment  with  substance  abuse  treatment, 

and  bringing  in  dual-credentialed  mental  health  and  substance  abuse  staff  to 

join the treatment court team, are other important features recommended for a 

successful co-occuring disorder treatment court.

Comprehensive  screening  and  assessments  of  offenders  produce  better 

outcomes in the co-occuring disorder situation. They provide the most thorough 

information on the person’s mental disorder, substance abuse disorder, trauma 

history, and criminal thinking to determine appropriate treatment planning and 

services for any particular individual.

Juvenile Court Programs

Federal  laws  passed  in  1980  called  upon  state  courts  to  provide  judicial 

oversight of court and stakeholder processes in juvenile dependency cases. As 

state courts took on this oversight role, federal compliance reviews noted that 

juvenile  court  processes  varied  from  state  to  state,  prompting  child  welfare 

and legal partner stakeholders to lobby for federal funding to help state courts 

move ahead with juvenile court reforms. The Court Improvement Program 

(CIP)  was  established,  along  with  other  federal  child  and  family  services 

programs,  to  help  state  courts  strengthen  oversight  of  juvenile  dependency 

cases  and  to  provide  funding  for  court  process  assessment,  reform,  and 

implementation of more effective court processes.

IP grant funding has helped state courts establish standard, periodic status 

reviews  of  children  in  care;  collaborate  with  and  monitor  required  tasks 

of  other  stakeholders  (attorneys,  caseworkers,  guardians,  court-appointed 

special  advocates);  and  develop  and  implement  strategies  that  will  enhance 

the  outcomes  of  their  juvenile  court  programs.  Funding  is  used  to  provide

of  this  statewide  effort,  the  Task  Force  met  with 

Oregon  Governor  Kate  Brown  in  April  2016  to 

request  the  formation  of  a  Children’s  Cabinet 

that  would  include  representation  from  all  three 

branches  of  government  —  Legislative,  Judicial, 

and Executive — along with other juvenile mental 

health  stakeholders  in  a  joint  effort  to  establish 

statewide processes to coordinate reforms for the 

well-being of youth.

In  the  mean  time,  the  Task  Force,  OJD,  and 

agency partners are taking steps to move the nine 

recommendations  forward.  Over  the  course  of 

2016,  OJD  worked  with  partners  to:  ensure  that 

all  youth  correctional  facilities  in  Oregon  have 

a  system  in  place  to  screen  youth  for  mental 

health  issues  at  intake;  improve  oversight  of  the 

administration  of  psychotropic  medication  for 

incarcerated  youth;  develop  a  legislative  proposal 

to  improve  information  sharing  practices  when 

youth  move  from  system  to  system;  and  pursue 

funding  for  a  comprehensive  review  of  Oregon’s 

residential care system for youth.

CRB  staff  and  OJD  implementation  teams  also  completed 

CRB’s  transition  from  JOIN  to  Oregon  eCourt’s  Odyssey  case

and  Tyler  Technologies  (the  vendor  for  Odyssey  software 

—  a  system  specifically  designed  for  courts)  completed  the 

implementation and updated CRB business processes. Odyssey 

will  house  CRB  cases  with  access  permissions  separate  from 

those of the circuit courts.

Juvenile Justice Mental 
Health Task Force

At  the  request  of  the  Chief  Justice  of  the  Oregon  Supreme 

Court,  OJD’s  Juvenile  Justice  Mental  Health  Task  Force 

(JJMHTF) continued their work on juvenile justice system mental 

health  care  reforms.  The  Task  Force  began  development  of  an 

implementation  plan  to  carry  out  the  nine  recommendations 

they  provided  in  the  Juvenile  Justice  Mental  Health  Task  Force 

Report and Recommendations 2016, that was submitted to the Chief 

Justice in January. The report outlined indepth findings from a 

statewide survey of juvenile court judges and juvenile department 

directors  that  identified  inadequacies  and  critical  gaps  in  the 

mental health care of Oregon’s justice-involved youth. The Task 

Force based their recommendations for reform and improvement 

of  the  structure  of  mental  health  care  services  in  the  juvenile 

justice system on the report’s findings. 

One  of  the  key  recommendations  was  early  identification  and 

treatment  of  mental  health  issues  and  person-based,  statewide 

data-sharing  between 

juvenile  mental  health  stakeholders. 

Centralized  collection  of  data  as  youth  become  involved  with 

The Citizen Review Board (CRB) 
The federal 1980 Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act requires courts 

to  conduct  regular  periodic  reviews  of  child  foster  care  cases  to  monitor  the 

progress of the case and to ensure that the state agency (DHS) who has custody 

of  the  child  is  following  court  orders  and  other  legally  required  procedures 

designed to protect the well-being of the child.

ermination of parental custody by court order or by voluntary surrender sets a 

series of required policies and procedures for DHS to follow. DHS must search 

for relatives with whom the child may be placed; utilize assessments to determine 

what  safety  and  health  services  are  needed  by  the  child;  ensure  that  parental 

visitations are scheduled; and provide the resources to help foster parents give 

foster children the best care possible. Reports on these procedures and other  

events  on  the  child’s  case  are  submitted  to  the  court.  Court  best  practices 

recommend  that  court  hearings  be  held  to  review  case  status  at  four  months 

and nine months after the onset of the case, but may also call for hearings in 

response to reported events that require immediate action by the court. At the 

six-month  mark,  and  at  least  every  six  months  thereafter,  CRB  provides  the 

court with valuable information through its case reviews. The CRB, established 

by the Oregon Legislature to comply with the federal 1980 Adoption Assistance 

and Child Welfare Act, provides groups (called “boards”) of trained community 

volunteers  that  furnish  the  courts  with  critical  information  obtained  in 

interviews with the family, the child’s attorney, and the DHS caseworker outside 

of the courtroom. In addition to the case interviews conducted by CRB boards, 

the CRB also engages in public oversight of the state child welfare system and 

works to promote conditions that ensure permanency for children, preserving 

families whenever possible. CRB boards make findings that can reveal problems 

that will influence court decisions about permanency planning for children in 

foster care. Currently, there are 62 boards in 33 of Oregon’s 36 counties and 

approximately 300 members statewide. 

During 2016, in response to a federal review of Oregon’s child welfare system 

and public concerns about the safety of children in foster care, the CRB formed 

the Foster Care Safety Team to expand ways for the CRB to safeguard children 

in  care.  The  team  developed  assessment  questions  to  be  asked  at  every  CRB 

review of a foster placement; produced a list of indicators that place the child’s 

safety at risk; and documented action items for CRB boards to refer to when

Problem-Solving Courts

OJD continues to meet its responsibility to administer justice for all Oregonians 

by looking for efficient case processing solutions that will decrease the time 

and costs involved in taking a case to court. OJD’s growing list of problem-

solving courts look to procedural innovations that streamline traditional court 

processes. These efforts in Oregon (and similar efforts in other state courts) 

initiated  the  Commercial  Court  in  2006,  the  Expedited  Civil  Jury  Trial  in 

2010, the Post-Conviction Review Trial (by video), and the Informal Domestic

New court technology has required courts to update their business processes,

offering  unbundled  services  at  less  cost  to  the  growing  number  of  self-

justice stakeholders has sparked improvements in treatment courts, juvenile 

justice,  law  enforcement,  and  related  system-wide  programs  that  improve 

justice system results for Oregonians. These innovations can be seen as some 

of  the  many  forerunners  to  recommendations  made  by  the  Civil  Justice 

Improvements  Committee  in  their  2016  report  to  the  Conference  of  Chief 

Justices titled Call to Action: Achieving Civil Justice for All. “Triaging” cases and 

assigning them to pathways based on estimated court time needed is one of 

the  recommendations  in  the  report.  Termed  in  the  report  as  the  Pathway 

Approach, triaging is a procedural innovation that improves case processing. 

Revised  processes,  including  the  use  of  technology,  results  in  courts  that 

are  more  accessible,  flexible,  and  efficient.  As  courts  reduce  the  duration, 

aggravation,  and  cost  associated  with  traditional  litigation  procedures,  and 

make lives better for justice-involved adults and juveniles with innovative court 

programs,  citizens  will  have  better  expectations  that  the  justice  system  will 

meet their needs.

Lane County Commercial Court
Lane County Commercial Court was developed as a procedural efficiency, where 

Parties are required to agree to participate in pre-court resolution 

efforts,  agree  to  a  specific  discovery  plan,  and  work  to  settle 

issues as quickly as possible. Business litigants benefit by having 

their complex commercial cases moved through the courts more 

efficiently at a lower cost, and smaller courts are able to free up 

their resources to attend to other cases on the docket.

Expedited Civil Jury Trials
OJD  implemented  the  Expedited  Civil  Jury  Trial  program  in 

2010  to  address  concerns  about  increasing  civil  litigation  costs 

that a growing number of citizens cannot afford and a continuing 

decline in civil jury trials caused by a variety of factors, including 

the  complicated  processes  and  time  involved  to  settle  even  a 

small case (sometimes taking years). The program offers a more

New “Streamlined Jury Trial” Pilot 
Projects in Jackson and Lane Circuit 
Courts 
On  July  1,  2016,  the  Streamlined  Jury  Trial 

Project  was  implemented  in  Jackson  and  Lane 

Circuit Courts as an adaptation of the Expedited 

Civil  Jury  Trial  program.  Both  have  the  same 

objectives; the difference is that eligible cases are 

automatically  assigned  to  the  Streamlined  Jury 

Trial  by  the  court,  and  a  party  must  choose  to 

opt out if the party does not want to participate. 

There are also some differences in time limits and 

procedure.  The  Streamlined  Jury  Trial  applies

conference  with  attorneys.  At  this  conference, 

a  judge  discusses  the  streamlined  procedures  for 

discovery  and  trial,  assists  the  parties  in  making 

a  discovery  schedule,  and,  if  appropriate,  sets  an 

earlier trial date. The Streamlined Jury Trial pilot 

projects in Jackson and Lane will help determine 

whether  the  opt-out  approach  will 

increase 

participation  in  the  expedited  trial  process.  The 

pilot  project  may  be  considered  for  statewide 

application if the pilot is successful.

Restoring public confidence

our courts work in 
fundamental ways. 
Citizens must be placed 
at the center of the 
system. They must be 
heard, respected, and 
capable of getting a just 
result, not just in theory 
but also in everyday 
practice. Courts need to 
embrace new procedures 
and technologies. They 
must give each matter 
the resources it needs — 
no more, no less — and 
prudently shepherd the 
cases our system faces now.

How the IDRT process 
reduces conflict at trial: 
•	 Friends, witnesses, family 
members are not called  
to testify and take sides.
•	 Parties are not able to elicit 
spiteful or emotionally 
harmful testimony from 
friends and family.
•	 The parties do not cross-
examine each other on  
the stand, eliminating 
emotional distress or harm  
to the other party.

•	 While allowing both parties 
to completely tell their side 
of the story, judges are able 
to set an example and direct 
that testimony be provided  
respectfully. The judge can 
keep testimony on topic.
•	 The simpler process means 
that the rules “do not get 
in the way” of the parties 
providing information  
to the judge, reducing 
frustration and friction 
among the parties.

Deschutes County Informal Domestic 
Relations Trial
The  Deschutes  County  Informal  Domestic  Relations  Trial  (IDRT)  program 

was  established  in  2013  in  Deschutes  County  Circuit  Court  as  an  option 

to  allow  parties  in  divorce,  separation,  unmarried  parent,  child  custody,  or 

support modification cases to participate in a more informal, less stressful, and 

more economical courtroom procedure. Parties speak directly with the judge 

to  completely  tell  their  side  of  the  story  without  interruption  or  objection 

from the other side. The judge engages each of the parties by asking questions 

to help them provide the information that the judge needs. The attendance of 

attorneys is optional, and if they do attend, they are not allowed to question 

either party — only the judge may ask questions. Witnesses are generally not 

allowed to appear unless the judge gives approval for an “expert witness” to 

testify, and cross-examination is not permitted. Parties may provide the judge 

with  any  documents  to  support  their  claims.  Generally,  the  judge  makes  a 

decision on the same day as the trial.

The most appropriate cases for the IDRT involve two self-represented parties 

in  an  uncomplicated  case  involving  marital  assets;  and  cases  involving 

domestic violence where the victim can present medical and police reports as 

proof, and can avoid cross-examination by the perpetrator. In such cases, the 

judge is the examiner, maintaining judicial control of the questioning. IDRT 

also  has  worked  well  in  cases  involving  more  complicated  assets  where  the 

parties were able to educate themselves about Oregon dissolution laws, and 

come to a proposed agreement, but may still have disagreements on correct 

interpretation of the laws. They may only need to ask the judge which is the 

correct  interpretation  and  application  of  the  laws  to  the  issue  in  order  to 

finalize their agreement. The IDRT process decreases conflict, improves access 

to justice for those who cannot afford or hire an attorney, and offers a more 

informal and less costly process that reduces delays in the system. The table 

below summarizes the number of IDRT cases held in Deschutes compared to 

traditional domestic relations trials from 2013 to December 2016:

Justice Reinvestment 
Initiative Update

Oregon is one of 30 states that have put Justice Reinvestment grants to work for 

justice system reform. All 36 counties in Oregon have partnered through their 

local county public safety coordinating councils, consisting of judges, District 

Attorneys, county agencies, corrections departments, treatment programs, and 

community services stakeholders, to make data-driven decisions about where 

in their counties to direct justice reinvestment funds. The funds must support 

evidence-based programs that reduce criminal behavior, divert offenders from 

prison  populations,  and  reduce  recidivism.  Grants,  monitored  by  Oregon’s 

Criminal Justice Commission (CJC), are distributed by the state through the 

Justice Reinvestment Grant (JRG) Program. Depending on demographics and 

the most critical needs of the local justice system, counties may decide to invest 

grant funds to hire additional public safety and corrections officers; develop 

or maintain prison drug, alcohol, and therapy treatment programs; transition 

housing  and  job  training  for  prison  released  offenders  or  parolees;  provide 

and  support  community  services  including  mental  health  and  addiction 

services and facilities; and develop or expand drug, juvenile, mental health, 

and veterans courts. Ten percent of JRG funding awarded to each county is 

marked for victim services programs. 

Savings in prison costs generated by these programs are reinvested to develop 

additional  programs  or  program  capacities  based  on  data  reporting  and  CJC 

monitoring of program outcomes. Treatment courts, for example, are required by 

legislation to adhere to “statewide, evidence-based standards for specialty courts...

designed  to  reduce  recidivism  in  a  cost-effective  manner  and  target  medium 

and high-risk individuals.” Other evidence-based practices that county programs 

employ  in  Oregon  are:  use  of  oversite  councils,  data  collection,  performance 

measurement;  accountability  reporting;  risk  and  needs  assessments;  and 

graduated sanctions and incentives to keep program participants accountable.

committee  prepared  a  proposal  for  submission  to  the  Chief  Justice  of  the 

Oregon Supreme Court recommending formal establishment of a Tribal-State 

Court Forum in the State of Oregon.

Oregon’s  Supreme  Court  Chief  Justice  Thomas  Balmer  approved  the 

recommendation  and  appointed  nine  state  court  judges  to  join  nine  tribal 

court judges to move forward as the Oregon Tribal-State Court Forum. The 

first  formal  meeting  of  the  Forum  was  held  on  October  7,  2016  and  was 

hosted  by  Chief  Judge  Jeremy  Brave-Heart  of  the  Klamath  Tribe’s  Judiciary 

on  Klamath  Tribal  lands.  Issues  discussed  at  the  meeting  involved  the 

Indian Child Welfare Act; tribal child support programs; cross-jurisdictional 

recognition of Tribal Court orders in protection and family court cases; and 

ideas were exchanged on projects to tackle during the coming year. The Forum 

sponsored a proposal to amend Uniform Trial Court Rules so that out-of-state 

tribal attorneys may appear in Oregon juvenile dependency cases to represent 

out-of-state Native American children without the undue financial burden of 

paying a $500 appearance fee. 

A Governance Group and three workgroups were formed at the meeting to help 

clarify actions that need to be taken to achieve the following projects:

1.  Educate Sheriffs, DA’s, Court Staff, Attorneys:  Recognition of tribal 

court orders in protection and family court cases.

2.  Address the barriers under ORS 24.190 (3)(a) Foreign Restraining Order: 
Barriers include: lack of understanding regarding the legal effect of Tribal 

Court Orders in other jurisdictions; inconsistent local enforcement of Tribal 

The Tribal-State Court 
Forum “is an ongoing,
mission-oriented, Tribal 
and State judges Forum 
that will continue into 
the future, “convening” 
throughout the year. 
This will ensure true

relationships between 
Tribal and State courts. As 
I wrote to you all last year,

is to improve and increase

Equal Justice
For All

The  courts,  along  with  other  justice  system  partners,  are  responding  to  the 

voices of diversity in our communities and hearing the demands for inclusion 

and fairness by changing the justice system of the past to one that wisely accepts 

new challenges and perspectives that will carry its value into the 21st Century 

and beyond.

OJD’s  committees,  workgroups,  councils,  and  task  force  participants  are 

uncovering alternative approaches to litigation for people who can’t afford an 

attorney,  including  the  ability  to  have  a  jury  trial  through  “streamlined  jury

During  meetings  held  in  the  Fall  of  2016,  OSCCIF  adopted 

a  Governance  Structure;  and  established  subcommittees  on 

Community  Engagement,  Data  Analysis,  and  Workforce 

Development.  Each  of  the  subcommittees  declared  specific 

objectives to begin work on in 2017:

Community Engagement Subcommittee:

•	 Provide a public venue to give feedback on the court system
•	 Collect public feedback and perceptions of the court system
•	 Provide suggestions to the Chief on how OJD can:

1.  Engage the community
2.  Provide internal education: Judges and staff about our

Some topics the Oregon 
Supreme Court Council 
on Inclusion and Fairness 
(OSCCIF) Subcommittees 
will be working on are 
ways to:

•	 Engage the community 
•	 Improve public 

understanding of OJD’s 
role in the justice system

•	 Document over-

representation of some groups 
in the justice system and 
at what points the over-
representation occurs

•	 Promote a diverse workforce 
that reflects the community

•	 Encourage re-visioning at the HR level in order to:

1.  Change the way OJD recruits in order to attract a more diverse pool  

of candidates

2.  Incentivize innovation in order to move toward more diversity in OJD

Between September 2015 and March 2016, Hearing Resources, 

LLC performed an assessment of OJD’s auxiliary aids currently 

used in courtrooms, jury rooms, public meeting rooms, and in

The  assessment  was  to  determine  if  OJD’s  auxiliary  aids  were 

suitable, sufficient, and operable for the purposes and locations 

in  which  they  would  be  used  by  hearing-impaired  court 

customers.  OJD  also  requested  a  determination  of  the  quality 

of  maintenance  of  auxiliary  aids  and  if  they  are 

appropriately  located  and  stored,  and  which, 

if  any,  of  the  current  equipment  needs  repair,

The assessment took place in 71 court and division

The Work of CREW 

The  Court  Reengineering  and  Efficiencies  Workgroup  (CREW)  serves  as 

an OJD governance mechanism to identify, examine, and evaluate efficiency 

initiatives consistent with four guiding principles:

•	 Promote convenience for litigants
•	 Reduce cost and complexity of judicial processes
•	 Maintain or improve access to justice
•	

Improve case predictability

In  2016,  CREW  reviewed  a  list  of  requested  changes  and  enhancements 

for  statewide  business  processes  and  forms;  held  discussions  and  dialogue 

throughout the year focused on development of additional statewide efficiencies 

using  the  tools  and  potential  of  the  new  Oregon  eCourt  system;  dispatched 

a  survey  to  help  collect  information  on  new  and  innovative  ways  to  utilize

Business Processes Subgroup
As OJD completed the implementation of Oregon eCourt in the 

circuit courts, the Business Processes Subgroup vetted requests 

to  review  and  analyze  specific  court  processes  to  find  the  best 

option for a statewide solution. Topics reviewed and finalized: 

how  contempt  cases  should  be  styled  in  the  Odyssey  case 

management system; issues and concerns with how the summons 

for FED (landlord/ tenant) cases filed through OJD Guide and 

Internal and External OJD Forms
 
  OJD’s  goal  to  establish  consistent  processes 

in  the  circuit  courts  also  called  for  detailed 

review,  policy  decisions,  modification,  and 

development  of  OJD  statewide  and  local 

court forms. To ensure statewide consistency 

for  court  customers  and  to  comply  with 

best  practices  in  the  use  of  court  business

processes, OJD enlisted internal and external stakeholders to assist in the 

strategies,  target  audiences,  key  messages,  and  the  dispatch  of 

to  identify  and  recommend  law  and  policy 

review  of  statewide  forms.  Before  a  form  can  be  finalized,  any  statewide

clarify issues about these forms, which in turn will allow users to take full 

advantage of the OJD Guide & File service.

Organization and Structure Subgroup
The  Organization  and  Structure  Subgroup  continued  their  evaluation  of 

judicial  resource  structures.  The  subgroup  analyzed  the  results  of  a  survey 

completed by all presiding judges, where they identified needs for additional 

judicial  resources;  discussed  ways  to  assess  the  available  capacity  that  exists 

within  OJD’s  current  judicial  resources;  and  discussed  effective  methods  to 

match  available  judicial  resources  with  additional  judicial  resource  needs 

across districts, for what kind of matters, and by what methods. The subgroup 

examined reasonable steps OJD can take to efficiently enable judicial districts 

to request and receive assistance from other judicial districts when the need for 

additional judicial resources arises — whether short-term, long-term, planned, 

or unplanned. Development, delivery, and completion of the full analysis of 

the survey data are underway, while the subgroup is also focused on refinement 

of their efforts to use the judicial resources structure in new ways (locally and 

centrally) when courts need access to additional judicial resources. 

Communication: Outreach, Internet, and 
Social Media Subgroup
Immediately  following  the  full  CREW  meeting  in  October  of  2015,  this 

subgroup  began  active  engagement  in  research  and  discussion  of  new, 

innovative,  and  web-related  ways  to  communicate  information  internally 

and  externally  with  stakeholders  and  the  public.    They  started  a  review 

process  of  OJD’s  current  communication  efforts  and  researched  best 

practices  for  court  communications,  including  social  media  options.  Their 

During the first few months of the year, the subgroup completed 

research  and  review  of  OJD’s  public  website;  national  best 

practices  for  court  website  redesign;  and  examples  of  other 

websites in other state courts that optimize viewing through a 

mobile device. A full report of their findings was reviewed by the 

full CREW membership, and their feedback was incorporated 

into  a  draft  Public  Website  Governance  document  that  was 

approved  by  the  Chief  Justice.  This  document,  the  first  of  its 

kind at OJD, will help OJD ensure clarity and consistency across 

webpages;  establish  and  maintain  communication  standards; 

offer a platform for collaboration and discussion about OJD’s 

main website and local court webpage needs; and ensure that 

public-facing webpages are designed in the best interest of court 

customers. Next, the subgroup began work on a more detailed 

definition of OJD web content:  statewide web content, required 

local  court  web  content,  and  priority  local  court  web  content 

(information that courts have designated as important for their 

judicial  district).  Content  types  were  vetted  through  CREW 

and approved by the Chief Justice. The Governance document 

and definition of OJD content types will guide OJD’s extensive 

review  and  reconstruction  of  the  webpages  with  the  mobile-

friendly website to be online by early 2017.

Safe, Efficient, 
Accessible 
Courthouses
Preserving the Past, 
Building for the Future

OJD’s  longterm  objectives  for  “the  people’s”  courthouses  are  to  provide  safe, 

efficient  courthouse  facilities  for  the  public  as  they  carry  out  business  at  the 

courthouse; and for court staff, security staff, and judges who carry out their 

work for the public good in our court facilities every day. To make this possible, 

the Oregon Legislature created the Oregon Courthouse Capital Construction 

and Improvement Fund in 2013, to provide state matching funds up to 50% 

with the counties to finance cost-effective replacement or repair of courthouses 

with structural defects that are threats to human health and safety if the facility 

co-locates with other state agencies — if not, the state will match 25% of project 

costs.  

Completely new facilities included in OJD’s courthouse replacement plan are 

all designed to be seismically sound, to provide the appropriate amount of space 

for courtrooms, jury rooms, staff and judicial offices, ADA accommodations, 

and for movement within the hallways and stairways to ensure public safety and 

the efficient delivery of services without delay. Courthouses will apply for funds 

to make necessary repairs — ranging from new water pipes, roof replacement, 

window  replacement,  HVAC  replacement,  new  ADA  compliant  elevators, 

seismic upgrades, addition of space to courtrooms, and sidewalk repairs.

Multnomah County Courthouse Replacement
Groundbreaking  ceremonies  for  the  new  central  Multnomah  County 

Courthouse in Portland were held in October 2016. Multnomah’s current 100 

year-old  courthouse  will  be  replaced  by  a  spacious  17-floor,  ADA  accessible 

building  that  will  provide  40  courtrooms  (three  larger  courtrooms  with 

additional  seating  capacity);  a  bank  of  seven  elevators  with  separate  judge 

and staff elevators; and separate elevators in the basement to bring in-custody 

criminal  defendants  up  to  courtrooms;  non-contact  visitation  rooms  for  in-

the ground floor. 

Construction  begins  January  2017,  with  completion  slated 

for 2020. Using the same funding model as other courthouse 

replacement  projects  (a  partnership  that  combines  matching 

funds  between  state  and  county),  Multnomah’s  central 

courthouse  will  also  house  the  County  District  Attorney’s 

Office,  the  Office  of  Public  Defense  Services,  and  grand  jury 

rooms.

Case
Statistics 

Between  500,000  and  800,000  cases  are  filed  in  Oregon  circuit  courts 

every  year.  Cases  filed  include  traffic  tickets,  disputes  over  minor  fender-

benders, divorces, contested child custody cases, complex securities and trade 

secrets  controversies,  serious  medical  malpractice  cases,  and  cases  involving 

criminal  acts.  All  subject  matter  of  cases  (civil,  criminal,  family,  juvenile, 

and  probate)  are  heard  in  the  circuit  courts,  which  are  Oregon’s  courts  of 

“general jurisdiction,” except for cases involving tax laws, which are heard by 

the Oregon Tax Court. Circuit court case decisions may be appealed to the 

Oregon Court of Appeals, which will issue a decision in the case. The Court of 

Appeals also decides petitions for judicial review of certain contested agency 

decisions  and  challenges  to  agency  rules.  A  party  who  is  dissatisfied  with 

the  Court  of  Appeals  decision  may  petition  the  Oregon  Supreme  Court 

to review that decision. The Supreme Court can choose to allow or deny 

the  petition.  The  Supreme  Court  also  hears  direct  appeals  and  reviews 

in  certain  types  of  proceedings,  including  death-penalty  appeals;  certain 

pretrial criminal appeals; some election-related matters; attorney discipline 

and judicial fitness matters; appeals from the Oregon Tax Court; certified 

questions  from  federal  courts;  and  petitions  for  writs  of  mandamus  and 

habeas corpus.

OJD statistics are collected yearly and issued in February of the following year. 

This section contains the most recent five-year trends in annual case filings 

for the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, circuit courts, and Tax Court. 

The State of Oregon Law Library’s collection, located in the Oregon Supreme Court Building, includes approximately 165,000 volumes and extensive

The types of cases filed in circuit courts have changed since 2011, with fewer violations, misdemeanor, and civil and 

criminal cases being filed, while the numbers of felonies and probate cases have increased. Felony case filings have the 

greatest proportional impact on the courts, requiring extensive use of both judicial and staff resources. Violations, small 

 

resources per case. Violations also represent 75% of the fines revenue collected by OJD.

Chart B on page 76 combines some case types into broader categories. Protective Orders includes Family Abuse Prevention 

Act (FAPAs), Elderly Persons and Persons with Disabilities Abuse Prevention Act (EPPDAPAs), Sexual Abuse Protective 

Order  (SAPOs),  and  Stalking  Orders.  The  Juvenile  category  includes  dependency,  delinquency,  and  termination  of

Oregon Tax Court Cases

The Oregon Tax Court has statewide jurisdiction to hear cases that involve Oregon’s tax laws. It consists of two divisions: 

the Magistrate Division, made up of three magistrates (appointed judicial officers) who encourage cooperation between 

the parties of a dispute or provide mediation before writing a decision; and the Regular Division consisting of one Tax

The 2016 Legislative Session further increased OJD’s all-funds budget by $15.8 million for increased Personal Services 

costs and to fund the planning of the Lane County Courthouse replacement in early 2017. The Legislature increased the 

General Fund appropriation by $2.3 million to cover the increased cost of collections. The combined increase of these 

Legislative actions brings the 2015-17 OJD total budget to $604.1 million.

OJD Revenues 2015–2017*

OJD revenues, collected by OJD, are generated primarily from case filing fees and fines imposed on violations and crimes. 

These revenues are distributed to the state local government accounts as provided by law — they do not directly fund the

Financial
Statistics 

Fiscal Overview 

OJD  receives  funding  for  its  operating  costs  primarily  from  legislative 

appropriations out of the State General Fund. OJD’s General Fund appropriation 

for 2013–2015 amounted to $402 million — approximately 2.53% of the General 

Fund Budget.

The  2015–2017  General  Fund  appropriation  was  $431.8  million  —  7.4% 

greater than the 2013–2015 appropriation. Other revenue amounts are added 

to  the  budget  to  cover  non-operating  costs  such  as  Oregon  eCourt,  facilities 

improvements, and debt payments on bonds. These other funds must receive 

legislative approval and are provided through bond sales, federal funds (usually 

grants), and “other funds.” Total OJD funding in 2013–2015, counting other 

funds, was $511 million; in 2015–2017 it was $586 million.

Increases to OJD funding for the 2015–2017 biennium were due to continuing 

improvements in Oregon’s economy and legislative approval of some of OJD’s 

requests. Those funds allowed OJD to:

•	 Restore resources to OJD’s Family Law program that were eliminated due 

to budget reduction in a prior biennium

•	 Provide cost of living increases for judges and OJD staff 
•	 Provide resources for Oregon eCourt technology, training, and business 

support 

•	 Add court positions to adjudicate cases generated by expansion of  

photo-radar enforcement in the City of Portland 

•	 Complete the implementation of Oregon eCourt 
•	 Continue the operation of treatment courts 
•	 Sell state bonds to help several counties begin to replace or renovate 

unsafe county-owned courthouses

Funding to achieve 
minimum service level 
requirements in our   
circuit courts will:

•	Ensure	a	72-hour	maximum	
for timely entry of court 
documents for enforcement     
of legal rights and judgments

•	Ensure	a	24-hour	maximum	
for timely entry of recall of 
arrest warrants notifications

•	Support	a	minimum	of	seven	
hours of daily public and 
telephone access to court 
services

2013–2016 ePay and eFile Payments 
Receipted

OJD ePayment is an online payment system that accepts payments on citations and civil and criminal cases in the circuit 

courts  with  pre-authorized  payment  plans.  It  is  a  component  of  OJD’s  case  and  financial  management  systems  that 

combine receipts from OJD’s legacy case management and financial systems (OJIN and FIAS) with the Oregon eCourt 

processes that replaced them towards the end of 2016. 

OJD eFiling (mandatory for Bar members) allows filers to electronically file, serve, distribute, and deliver court documents 

24  hours  a  day  from  home,  office,  or  any  other  location,  in  circuit  courts  and  Tax  Court.  Filing  fees  are  paid  online 

through the OJD File & Serve process. The Oregon Tax Court began using OJD eFiling in April of 2016.

OJD’s Future Funding Goals

The Oregon Judicial Branch serves a core function of government by enforcing 

laws and resolving the societal problems and disputes that are brought to the courts 

every day. The constitutional responsibility of the courts is to respond completely 

and without delay to reconcile people’s difficulties and legal crises according to 

the rule of law, and to protect citizens from victimization. Our funding goals 

(below) are to keep our courts open every business day, with adequate staff and 

judges to serve the public; provide safe and efficient courthouses; and to power 

our services with 21st Century technology and business processes.

Funding Goals 2017–2019

•	 Secure sufficient judicial and staff resources to match population 

growth and caseload changes, and to allow Oregon courts to fulfill their 

core responsibilities established by the Oregon Constitution and state 

statutes. Restore positions previously lost and add new judicial and staff 

positions recommended in 2016 by a National Center for State Courts 

OJD workload study, to enable courts to meet case disposition timelines 

that affect public safety — including entering judgments into OJD’s case 

management system within the three-day limit so they may be enforced; 

entering recalls of terminated arrest warrants within the 24-hour limit 

so that persons are not in danger of false arrest; and keeping our public 

counter and public telephone access to court services available to the 

public at least seven hours per business day.

•	 Re-open and develop statewide availability of service centers and legal 

information resources for self-represented citizens. Courts see thousands 

of litigants who do not have legal representation who are involved in life-

changing domestic relations, child support, custody and visitation, and 

other court cases. We need to increase the numbers of court personnel to 

Why it’s important to fund 
the courts:

•	So that courts remain open 

and accessible 

•	So that people receive timely 

judicial decisions

•	So that the Oregon eCourt 

system can sustain operations 
and create efficiencies

•	So that Oregonians have safe 
and accessible courthouse 
facilities

•	So that state courts can recruit 
high quality attorneys to the 
judiciary

•	So that the courts can assist 
people without attorneys, in 
family law and other cases

81

It’s important that courts remain accessible, are efficient, and that people without attorneys obtain the assistance they need. All OJD circuit courts 
provide public access terminals at the courthouse — the photo above shows Marion County Circuit Court’s Public Access terminals. The terminals 
(sometimes called “kiosks”) are a convenient resource for court visitors and self-represented litigants, providing computer access to OJD eServices 
such as Guide & File’s interactive forms and eFiling. 

•	 Continue to fund the long-term investment in Oregon 
eCourt technology with a permanent technology fund. 

•	 Develop and preserve statewide availability of 
our highly effective evidence-based treatment 

help our self-represented court customers understand court procedures or 

Provide adequate staff to maintain and develop the core

and the self-represented options that are less 

time-consuming, less costly, and less stressful 

than traditional court processes.

Courts

•	 Fund judicial compensation to meet the Public Officials Compensation 
Commission’s (POCC’s) recommended compensation levels so that we 

can retain and attract the diversity of highly qualified and experienced 

judicial candidates that are so vital to the demanding responsibilities of 

this important public service. Despite recent increases in compensation, 

Oregon’s judges are among the lowest paid in the country. The Chief 

Justice continues to advocate for compensation that would put Oregon’s 

judges at the median of the 13 Western states.

•	 Our work will continue with the Oregon Legislature and the Association 
of  Oregon Counties Court Facilities Task Force to continue collaborative 

funding with the counties to complete OJD’s long-term state court facility 

and security improvement plan. Safe, accessible, and efficiently designed 

courthouses not only allow the work of the judicial system to be done in 

public and serve as symbols of refuge for citizens in need of justice and 

court services.

Oregon state courts are 
at the core of the critical 
path of preservation 
of public safety, protection 
of families in crisis, 
and economic stability 
of Oregon.
