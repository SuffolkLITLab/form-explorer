      <pre>PRO TEM JUDGE APPOINTMENTS 
INFORMATION AND APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS 

The Oregon Judicial Department welcomes the participation of qualified lawyers to serve as judges pro 
tempore (“pro tem judges”) to assist in the work of the state’s courts and, thereby, improve access to 
justice.  Pro tem judges serve in various capacities in the state’s judicial districts, with their assignments 
coming primarily from the presiding judge of the pro tem judge’s judicial district. 

The Oregon Supreme Court appoints pro tem judges.  To be eligible for appointment, a person must be 
an Oregon resident and have been a member in good standing of the Oregon State Bar for the three 
years preceding the person’s appointment.  In addition, the person must have the legal knowledge and 
experience necessary to perform the duties of a pro tem judge in a manner that will promote the more 
efficient administration of justice.  To preside over courtroom proceedings, a person must have 
substantial courtroom experience and strong communication skills. 

Pro tem judges are subject to the provisions of the Code of Judicial Conduct.  They are also subject to the 
Oregon Constitution’s restrictions on simultaneously holding multiple government positions.  Or Const, Art 
III, § 1; Or Const, Art II, § 10.1  Before applying to serve as a pro tem judge, applicants should determine 
whether they have any potential conflicts of interest that could affect their eligibility to serve. 

To be appointed as a pro tem judge, a person must apply for and receive approval by the Supreme 
Court.  To do so, an applicant must submit 

(1) A completed Application for Pro Tem Judge Approval,

(2) A letter from a judicial district’s presiding judge stating the judge’s position regarding approval of

the applicant, and

(3) A letter from the same judicial district’s pro tem judge screening committee stating the

committee’s position regarding the applicant’s approval.

The letters must be from the presiding judge and screening committee for the judicial district where the 
applicant’s office is located.  However, if an applicant’s office is located in Multnomah, Clackamas, or 
Washington County, the applicant may apply through the screening committee for any one of those 
counties and the presiding judge for the same county.  The application and letters from the screening 
committee and presiding judge should be sent from the presiding judge’s office in one package to the 
Pro Tem Judge Manager at the Office of the State Court Administrator.   

The amount of time to obtain approval varies, depending on the review processes of the judicial 
district’s presiding judge and screening committee.  Once the required materials are submitted to the 
Supreme Court, the materials will be considered at one of the court’s public meetings, which are usually 
held monthly.  Pro tem approvals are for three years.  Persons seeking reapproval should apply early 
enough so that their applications can be considered before the expiration of their current terms. 

If you have questions about the application process, please contact the Office of the State Court 
Administrator, currently Kim Blanding, Pro Tem Manager (kim.l.blanding@ojd.state.or.us) or 
503-986-5512.

Article III, section 1, provides, “The powers of the Government shall be divided into three separate branches, the 
Legislative, the Executive, including the administrative, and the Judicial; and no person charged with official duties under

Article II, section 10, provides, “No person holding a lucrative office, or appointment under the United States, or 
under this State, shall be eligible to a seat in the Legislative Assembly; nor shall any person hold more than one lucrative 
office at the same time, except as in this Constition [sic] expressly permitted; Provided, that Officers in the Militia, to 
which there is attached no annual salary, and the Office of Post Master, where the compensation does not exceed One 
Hundred Dollars per annum, shall not be deemed lucrative.”

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
