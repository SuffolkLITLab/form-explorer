      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre>he State Family Law Advisory Committee (SFLAC) in 2009 approved the revision of the former 

2004 Guidelines, and this foreword was added in 2010 to further explain the intent of the 
revisions.  These 2010 Guidelines reflect a broad, general perspective of the designated 
services, and should be customized for the particular needs and resources of each jurisdiction.  
They were developed in the interest of quality assurance and consumer protection, while 
building in the maximum flexibility for individual courts.  These guidelines are aspirational and 
represent the current national standards, while recognizing the necessity and importance of 
judicial discretion in selection and appointment  

hese Guidelines are based on national trends and research about these roles.  Decades of 
research substantiate the importance of maintaining positive parental and family interactions 
while reducing conflict and harm, and the need for some families to have specialized help.  Our 
state has already developed and revised standards for other court-connected roles, such as 
family mediators.  Families facing divorce, separation, and parenting disputes are complex and 
vulnerable, therefore it logically and ethically follows that PCs, CEs, and PTSs, who are often in 
a more powerful position with clients than mediators, should have similar expectations of 
adequate and evolving guidelines applied to these roles.  The Guidelines approved by the 
SFLAC are offered as a response to the diversity and evolution of these helping roles in 
determining and maintaining the best interests of children.   

ur current statute (ORS 107.425) does not define these roles, so it is necessary to clarify 

them.  The revisions reflected in the 2010 version primarily involve increasing training 
requirements, adding a requirement of licensure for some roles, and clarifying the scope of the 
practice of each role.  This helps ensure more accountability from providers, and provides better 
assurance that providers have the necessary background for these roles.  

ver the years the roles have developed and changed, and more training opportunities have 
become available within the state and nationally for those who seek to meet the Guidelines.  
While the 2010 Guidelines reflect current national standards, they also continue to provide for 
waivers and accommodations for any particular court or area, when practitioners cannot be 
found who meet all the recommendations for training and experience.  The Guidelines refer to 
professional roles and services, recognizing that nonprofessionals may be warranted or 
required for a particular family circumstance.  With respect to parenting time supervisors, the 
guidelines are not applicable when para-professionals, friends, or family members are utilized 
as chaperones. 

t is strongly suggested that jurisdictions establish an evaluation feedback process, to determine 
how well the Guidelines and roles serve the intended purposes.  This will assure continued 
competency, responsiveness, and accountability.  Local Family Law Advisory Committees 
(LFLACs) may be able to develop affordable alternatives within a jurisdiction.  

FLAC continues to welcome comments and feedback concerning the Guidelines from service 

providers, courts, attorneys, and families.

2010 GUIDELINES   
Qualifications for Appointment and Training of  
Parenting Coordinators, Custody Evaluators, and  
 Parenting Time Supervisors  
 

FULL DISCLOSURE:  The PC should inform the court and the prospective clients prior 
to starting PC services regarding 1) the ethics and standards that cover their practice 
due to their licensure, as well as those adopted voluntarily by the PC, and 2) the scope 
and limits to their role and function as a PC. 

.5 

SINGLE ROLE:  A parent coordinator should not function in or assume a dual role with 
any of the parties involved in parent coordination. 

.6   WAIVER:  A court may waive the qualifications set forth in these Guidelines for good 

cause.  It is strongly encouraged that, where qualifications are waived, the PC be 
required to certify to the court that s/he will provide PC services based upon a generally 
recognized set of standards of practice identified and provided to the court and his/her 
clients and will seek continuing education classes, training, and peer supervision 
relevant to the role of parenting coordination. 
 
REVIEW OF NATIONAL STANDARDS:  The Association of Family and Conciliation  
Courts (www.afccnet.org) has published Guidelines for Parenting Coordination, currently 
dated May 2005.  The SFLAC urges courts that are establishing guidelines, 
qualifications, or standards of practice for PCs to consult this professional publication 
and others for further details and updates. 

EXCEPTIONS TO ROLE:  These guidelines encompass the general understanding 
that a parenting coordinator does not function as an arbitrator.  To the extent the 
PC is an arbitrator and renders binding decisions without judicial review, s/he should 
have the qualifications and authority of an arbitrator as defined in Chapter 13 of the 
Uniform Trial Court Rules and Oregon Revised Statutes 36.400-36.425.

ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR THERAPEUTIC PTS PRACTICE:  The Supervised 
Visitation Network guidelines define therapeutic supervision as:  “conjoint parent-child 
therapy conducted by a licensed or certified mental health professional also trained to 
provide supervised visitation.  This includes a student or intern in training for a post-
graduate degree under the direct supervision of a licensed or certified mental health 
professional.”  A PTS who is providing therapeutic supervision under this definition 
should have a Master’s degree and clinical experience working with families, and also 
have additional training and expertise in working with the diagnosis, behavior and 
treatment of mental health, child abuse, and substance abuse.  

BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS:  To the extent that the PTS is associated with a formal 
program, nonprofit or other business entity, that program should have a foundational 
mission statement and set of procedures or rules that address the safety and security of 
children, adults, and the PTS.  Whoever is providing supervision to staff or volunteers 
should have or exceed the above criteria for providing PTS.  The policies and 
procedures should address at least the following: 

• Intake or orientation interview with parents or guardians to assess family needs and 

suitability of program for each family 

• Taking family histories 
• Scheduling visits 
• Fees/costs 
• Documentation and record keeping, including during PTS visits 
• Court-related matters, including PTS testimony

2010 GUIDELINES   
Qualifications for Appointment and Training of  
Parenting Coordinators, Custody Evaluators, and  
 Parenting Time Supervisors  
 

HISTORY OF REVISIONS 

In 2001, the 71st Oregon Legislative Assembly passed Senate Bill 167 modifying ORS 107.425 
to provide for the appointment by the court of individuals, or panels of individuals, to assist the 
court and/or parents in resolving disputes regarding parenting time and in creating and 
implementing parenting plans. 

B 167 provided that the presiding judge of each judicial district would establish qualifications 

for the appointment and training of individuals and panels and the designation of programs 
under ORS 107.425.  “In establishing qualifications, a presiding judge shall take into 
consideration any guidelines recommended by the statewide family law advisory committee.”  
(ORS 107.425(3)(d)) 

he SFLAC appointed a work group to research existing national guidelines and make 

recommendations for qualifications and training in three areas of services: 

parent coordination (PC) 
custody evaluation (CE) 
supervised parenting time (PTS) 

he first set of Guidelines was approved and made available on September 10, 2004. 

n 2008, the SFLAC voted to reappoint the work group to consider whether the Guidelines 
should be updated and revised, based on concerns brought to their attention.  

he work group was reconvened and renamed “SFLAC Qualifications and Guidelines 

Subcommittee”, and was again chaired by Dr. Edward Vien (licensed psychologist, Portland).  
Members of the committee included Leah Baer (supervised parenting time provider, Portland), 
Dave Hakanson (mediator, Bend), Judith Swinney (attorney, parent educator, supervised 
parenting time provider, Portland), Alison Taylor (Executive Director, Oregon Family Institute 
and parent coordinator), Lauren MacNeill (Director, Clackamas Co. Family Court Services), 
Janice Ashe (Manager, Multnomah Co. Family Court Services), Melissa Schuler (supervised 
parenting time provider, Portland), Lisa Carr (Custody Evaluator, Salem), Mark Troseth (Public 
Member, Oregon Board of Licensed Clinical Social Workers), Chiquita Rollins (Coordinator, 
Multnomah Co. Domestic Violence Council), and staff from Oregon Judicial Department, Family 
Law Staff Counsel, Salem.  

The Subcommittee submitted its recommendations for revised qualifications and guidelines to 
SFLAC on June 5, 2009, and SFLAC at their December 2009 meeting approved and 
recommended that these revisions should be approved and distributed.  Based on comments 
received, the group revised the introduction in February 2010, and reported back to SFLAC in 
March 2010.  Additional language was added to the introduction, and SFLAC referred the 
Guidelines and their new introduction to Kingsley Click, State Court Administrator, and to the 
Chief Justice.  The 2010 Guidelines were approved on April 15, 2010.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
