“Birth Through Three” Defined 

• “Birth Through Three” refers in the cited 

literature and this presentation to children 
under the age of four. 
 

• Chronological age is not the only determinant of 

children’s status and abilities.   
 

• Developmental age is also a factor for 

consideration.

Background: Two Research Tracks… 
  
 40 years of research supports: 
phenomenon of infant attachment 
protective factors associated with

children? 

How do parents/professionals balance 

the importance of attachment with 
parental involvement?

Historical Tension Points 

Attachment Theory 

Parental Involvement Research

• Multiple attachments form 

concurrently – there is no such 
thing as primary attachment 

• Involvement of both parents is 

an overarching protective factor 

• Interfering with parental 

involvement is more harmful 
than disrupting attachment 
to the primary parent  

• Research focused primarily on 

fathers, which frequently 
excluded fathers with problems, 
is sufficient to generalize to 
overnights & other special 
circumstances 

     

       

           

           

           

• Primary attachment is an 

overarching protective factor  

attachment is more harmful 
than disrupting the 
relationship with the other 
parent  
 
• Research conducted primarily 
 
on mothers is sufficient to 
understand attachment 
mechanisms and function 

       

• Interfering with primary

Finding Balance 

“Reliance on either attachment theory or joint 

parental involvement research, as if these two 
strands of development are not overlapping and 
inextricably related, has in our view, fostered 
polarizations in legal and academic thinking and 
practice, impeding thoughtful integration of the 
existing reliable knowledge bases.”

Unpacking 
Attachment 

Attachment is the deep and abiding 
emotional relationship between 
an infant and her caregiver.  

t is more than a bond, as it is 

characterized by the sensitive 
attunement of the caregiver to the 
infant’s nonverbal cues, and the 
emotional satisfaction and safety 
experienced by the infant.

Distinguishing Attachment 
Bonding & Attachment are Not Equivalent 

3/31/2017 

Qualities of Bonding 

Qualities of Attachment 

• Strength of adult’s feeling of 
    connection to the child 
• Care giving is focused on 
completing the tasks of 
providing care to the child 

• Caregiver sets pace for 

interaction 

• Child withholds distress 

response until contact with an 
attachment figure 

• Relationship is goal oriented 

(future focused) 

• Quality of child’s emotional 
connection to caregiver 
• Care giving is focused on 

meeting the expressed needs 
of the child (attunement) 

• Child initiates interaction and 
adult responds (reciprocity) 
• Child freely expresses distress, 
openly & without reservation 
• Relationship is interpersonally 
oriented (present focused)

1. Attachment is created 

 

Consistent, warm, 

responsive care that is 
attuned to the physical 
and emotional signals 
of the child creates 
secure attachment. 

   

 

Aspects of Attachment    

▫ Development of critical neural 

connections 

▫ Managing internal states, i.e. emotional 

co-regulation 
 

▫ Developing self-awareness 

▫ Building meaningful relationships with 

others 

▫ Feeling secure enough to explore 

▫ Caring about the feelings of others

Emotional Regulation 101 

3/31/2017 

• Emotional Regulation is the ability to identify, manage 

and recover from strong feelings. 
 

• Repeat experiences of emotional regulation allow a 
child to understand and accept his own feelings, use healthy 
ways to handle them, and keep going even under stress.   

Chronic, unresolved emotional dysregulation exposes 
the infant/young child’s brain to damaging stress hormones 
during critical developmental periods. 

Emotional regulation in infancy is a critical 
component of healthy brain development

Attachment and 
Separating Parents 

Supporting Attachment to Both Parents 

• The key to building and 

maintaining 
attachment is to focus 
on the child’s experience 
and needs, as opposed 
to the parents’ desire for 
fairness. 

22 

3/31/2017 

Encouraging Attachment 

 

• Provide responsive care 

▫ Feeding 
▫ Comforting 
▫ Sleeping or napping 

• Reduce Parental Anxiety 

▫ Primary Residential Parent 
▫ Other Parent 
 

• Create opportunities to build 

attachment without chronically 
distressing the child

Families are Changing 
• More than 40% of parents are not married. 

 

• 16% of all same sex couples in the US are raising children 

together. 

2000. 

 

 

 

 

• The rate of adoption by same sex couples has doubled since 

• Multigenerational families in one household are increasing 

for the first time in decades. 

• Nearly 10% more grandparents are raising children now 

than in 2000. 

Same sex co-parenting relationships and an ever- 
increasing number of never married parents add 
dimension which cannot be encompassed within a 
traditional binary model.

Young Children and Intimate 
Partner Violence (IPV) 
• Children under the age of 6 are at a higher risk than 

 

older children for exposure to IPV  

• IPV often occurs during pregnancy  

 

 

• Perception exists that younger children are not as 

affected by witnessing IPV.  However developmental 
models suggest that there may be devastating effects on 
neurological, emotional and other realms of 
development as well as threats to an infant’s and a young 
child’s sense of security and wellbeing. 
 

25 

3/31/2017 

Young Children and IPV 

Children who live in an environment of IPV are at 

increased risk for: 

• becoming direct victims of child abuse 
• poor school performance 
• structural and physiological changes in the brain 
• higher rates of mental health problems than 

children who are directly abused 

• long-term effects including physical health 

problems, behavioral problems in adolescence 
and emotional difficulties in adulthood

Young Children and IPV 

Reactions to DV for children birth to 5: 

▫ Sleep and/or eating disruptions 
▫ Withdrawal/lack of responsiveness 
▫ Intense/pronounced separation anxiety 
▫ Inconsolable crying 
▫ Developmental regression, loss of acquired skills 
▫ Intense anxiety, worries and/or new fears 
▫ Increased aggression and/or impulsive behavior. 
▫ Disruptions in attachment and bonding occur as 

children focus on survival 

 

27 

3/31/2017 

Young Children and IPV 

Children can be exposed and impacted on many 

levels:  
▫ visually or audibly witnessing violence  
▫ seeing the physical aftermath (bruises, wounds, 

holes in walls, etc.)  

▫ interaction with social and medical services  
▫ impact to a parent’s mental health may negatively 
affect their ability to parent the child in a warm 
and sensitive way 

 “Children may learn that it is acceptable to exert control or relieve stress by using 
violence, or that violence is linked to expressions of intimacy and affection.”

• The consensus of the authors 

regarding research on attachment:  

“Children form concurrent 
attachments to caregivers but still 
prefer proximity to one or the 
other at different ages.”  

   

 

• Thus the goal of parenting plans for 

young children is: 

 

“to foster both developmental security 
and the health of each parent-child 
relationship, now and into the 
future.”

Overnight Considerations - Highlights 

• An existing relationship of at least 6 months is a critical 

first level assumption for overnights. 
 

• Children and parents must be safe (Gateway Factors). 

• The presence of conflict in itself is not prohibitive – 

frequency and intensity of conflict are factors. 
 

• “Step up” plans and activities to increase parental 

capacity make sense and should be supported where 
appropriate. 
 

• Signs of distress can be normal, but significant and/or 
prolonged distress should be addressed (See Birth Through 
Three, p.21).

Overnight Considerations – Caveats 

• “Even when all parenting conditions are met,

hristian and Mandy started dating when they were both 16. Two months later 

Mandy learned she was pregnant. Mandy dropped out of high school in her 
second trimester. She gave birth to a baby boy, Alex, who is now 5 months old. He 
is healthy and developmentally on target. He is securely attached to Mandy and 
her mother.  

hristian graduated high school and is working a minimum wage job. Mandy 

applied for state assistance and 3 months ago the state established paternity and 
issued a child support order against Christian. Christian had no contact with 
Mandy from the time she dropped out of school until paternity was established. 
He did not contribute to Mandy’s or Alex’s expenses before the order, but has paid 
child support regularly since the order was established. Christian also took a 
parenting class for teens during his last semester at school. 

hristian and his family have been persistent in their attempts to spend time with 
Alex since paternity was established. Mandy rarely responds to Christian’s texts or 
emails or phone calls from the paternal grandmother. Two months ago she agreed 
to allow Christian and his mother to meet Alex in her home. She told Christian he 
could see Alex for one hour per week but that visits had to be supervised by her 
or her mother at her home. Christian agreed and showed up for six consecutive 
weeks. Parenting time went well, and Alex was beginning to recognize and reach 
for Christian. 
  
The last two weeks Christian has not visited Alex. He says he is uncomfortable in 
Mandy’s home and sees no reason Alex cannot come to his home. He says his 
mother is willing to help him during his parenting time and that he has set up a 
play area and gathered baby supplies for Alex at his home. He would like to have 
Alex three days a week, including overnights. Christian says he has a big extended 
family which gets together regularly and is eager to meet Alex. 

andy does not agree to Christian taking Alex to his home. She says she barely 
knows him and doesn’t trust he knows how to parent.  She states that Christian 
texts or plays video games on his phone almost the entire time he is supposed to 
be playing with Alex and she worries he won’t watch the baby closely if he is not 
supervised. Mandy says Christian used drugs in high school (pot mostly) and she is

herself holding a beer bong and claims to have a new boyfriend every other week.  
He is afraid she is trying to erase him from Alex’s life and find his son a new daddy. 
Mandy has returned to school to earn her GED and works part-time. She relies on 
her mother to care for Alex about 15 hours each week. Alex is able to take a bottle 
from Mandy’s mother. Neither parent drives and it takes 90 minutes to get from

cenario 2: Esther & Sylvia  

Sylvia and Esther have been together for 10 years as domestic partners, and legally married in 2014. Together they 
decided to become parents, and Esther became pregnant through donor insemination with an anonymous donor. Their 
son, Jason, is now almost 3 years old.  

3/31/2017 

oth parents had time off from work during Jason’s first three months and provided a great deal of direct care for him. 
When their son was four months old, Esther started working an afternoon and evening shift and cared for Jason in the 
mornings. Sylvia began working a morning and afternoon shift and cared for Jason in the afternoon and evenings. Jason 
currently is in day care from 12:00 until 3:00 pm each weekday. On the weekends, they continue this shared care 
schedule. Sylvia is responsible for Jason’s evening routine (dinner, bath and bedtime), while Esther is responsible for 
Jason’s morning routine (wake up, dressing and breakfast).  

sther’s work, often and unpredictably, requires her to work overtime and when this happens Esther does not get home 
until early in the morning. Frequently, Esther “winds down” when she comes home by having several drinks. Sylvia reports 
she has had to care for Jason in the mornings on more than a few occasions, and that has made her late for work. She is 
concerned that when they are living separately, Esther will not be reliable to care for Jason in the mornings.  

oth parents provide day-to-day care for their son, and he is bonded to them. When both are present, Jason prefers Esther 

to comfort him when he is upset. In parenting style, Sylvia tends to be somewhat rigid and Esther more nurturing. Sylvia is 
in a new relationship, and her girlfriend is not comfortable around children. A few times, Sylvia has asked Esther to care for 
Jason during her scheduled time so that Jason is not around her girlfriend. While Esther is fine with this, she wonders how 
Sylvia will handle it when they are living separately.  

o save money, Esther and Sylvia continue to live in their joint house, and plan to do so until it is sold. It is on the market 

and expected to sell quickly and they need to make arrangements for their separation and create a parenting plan, 
especially since tensions between them are rising. When Esther drinks, Sylvia confronts her and the parties argue 
intensely, with accusations, tears, yelling, and slammed doors.

obert and Katie are a couple in mediation. They have a 2 1/2 year old son, James, and are looking for help designing an 

appropriate parenting plan for his care. They say that James is very comfortable with both parents, and that both have 
taken turns being a stay-at-home parent during his infancy. Neither parent expresses any concern about substance abuse 
or violence in the home. They agree that they want to share custody and parenting time, but need some guidance as 
James spends more time with Robert out of the family home. They wish to work together in co-parenting their son as he 
grows up. 

obert has recently moved to a nearby apartment, but has yet to introduce James to that environment. To date, the 

parents have worked flexibly to arrange for Robert to spend time with James in the family home, an arrangement they feel 
is growing increasingly stressful. 

atie’s main concern is that James has not spent overnights away from home. She feels confident that James feels 

comfortable in his father’s care, but is concerned about the disruption that moving to a shared parenting plan might cause. 
Katie would like a very structured plan with predictable overnight care for James, including weekends.  

obert’s goal is to design a plan that would gradually work toward overnight care for James at his apartment. He reports 

that his employment as a musician affords him lots of flexibility during the week, but that he is often busy during the 
weekends, sometimes on short notice.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
