      <pre>OREGON JUDICIAL BRANCH
Strategic Campaign
2020–2022

On  behalf  of  Oregon’s  judicial  branch,  it  is  my  pleasure 

to  introduce  our  strategic  campaign  for  2020-2022.  This 

campaign 

recognizes  our 

constitutional  obligation 

to 

provide 

justice 

for  all  Oregonians,  makes 

four 

commitments to advance that cause, and sets out nineteen 

initiatives that we will undertake over the next two years.  

I hope that you will  study  the  elements  of  this  campaign 

with  interest  and  enthusiasm  and  determine  how  best  to 

contribute your time and talents.

This  campaign  is  the  work  of  the  Oregon  Judicial 

Department’s 

(OJD’s)  Strategic  Planning  Steering 

Committee,  with  assistance  from  the  National  Center  for

State Courts and the State Justice Institute. The Steering 

Martha L. Walters, Chief Justice
Oregon Supreme Court

Committee  reviewed  OJD’s  past  strategic  plans  and  convened  12  focus  groups  to  obtain  the 

insights  and  experiences  of  the  diverse  individuals  who  make  up  our  justice  system.  The  first 

groups included presiding judges, trial court administrators, and division heads from the Office 

of the State Court Administrator (OSCA). Later focus groups included community leaders, legal 

advocates, bar leaders, law enforcement, governmental partners, and court staff. We also solicited 

the advice of legislators and conducted an OJD-wide survey that provided insight about how well 

we measure on national indicators of highly effective courts.  

We compiled what we learned and presented the results at a two-day summit, where 40 volunteer 

participants  from  across  OJD—including  judges,  trial  court  administrators,  and  central  staff—

identified the most pressing concerns and made recommendations to address them. The Steering 

Committee then adopted this plan for a focused two-year campaign. I am thankful to all those 

who participated in this effort, and I hope that this campaign is a faithful reflection of our justice 

community’s aspirations.  

As you will see when you review this campaign, we face many challenges in our constant effort to 

provide justice for all Oregonians. It is my hope that, by undertaking specific commitments and 

initiatives, we can better address those challenges, increase public trust and confidence in our 

courts, and improve our services for all. 

To that end, the Oregon Judicial Department makes these four commitments to the people of 

Oregon: 

We will join with community partners to improve services and outcomes 
for people who are underserved, vulnerable, or marginalized; and we will 
develop effective, supportive, and creative solutions to respond to their 
legal needs. 

We  will  improve  access  to  justice  by  eliminating  barriers;  continuing 
to  simplify  and  streamline  our  processes  and  forms;  enhancing  service 
options;  leveraging  technology;  improving  interpreter  services;  and 
advocating for resources to keep courts open, safe, and secure. 

We  will  enhance  the  public’s  trust  and  confidence  in  Oregon’s  state 
government, including the judicial branch, by listening and responding 
to the needs of those we serve; holding ourselves to high standards; and 
communicating the role of our courts in providing justice for all.   

We  will  create  a  workplace  and  courthouse  culture  that  is  supportive, 
inclusive, welcoming, and affirming; that embraces diversity; and where 
all people can thrive and are treated with respect and dignity. 

On the following pages, we describe those commitments in greater detail and set out the initiatives 

that we plan to undertake in the coming two years.    

To  our  readers,  we  thank  you  for  your  interest,  and  we  invite  your  involvement  and  inquiries. 

To those of you who already have contributed to this campaign, we thank you for sharing your 

experiences  and  your  ideas.  To  be  successful  in  this  campaign  we  will  need  your  continued, 

concerted commitment.

To all who join us in carrying out our goals, we thank you for sharing our mission of providing fair 

and accessible justice services that protect the rights of individuals, preserve community welfare, 

and  inspire  public  confidence.  It  is  you  who  ensure  that  we  achieve  that  mission,  and  we  are 

committed to working together for the benefit of all Oregonians.    

Martha L. Walters, Chief Justice  

Commitment 1

We will join with community partners 
to improve services and outcomes 
for people who are underserved, 
vulnerable, or marginalized; and we 
will develop effective, supportive, 
and creative solutions to respond to 
their legal needs.

1

Commitment 1 — Initiatives
1.1	 We	will	participate	in	statewide	efforts	to	examine	how	to	best	meet	the	needs	of	

Oregonians	with	mental and behavioral health challenges	and	develop	best	
practices	for	courts	to	use	in	cases	where	those	challenges	must	be	addressed.	
Oregon’s court system reflects the growing, state-

1.2	 We	will	continue	to	examine	the	impacts	of	fines and fees,	develop	best	

practices	for	their	imposition,	and	take	affirmative	steps	to	ensure	that	they	do	not	
create	unnecessary	barriers	or	disproportionate	outcomes.		

Fines are imposed as a way to hold people accountable for their actions and fees are imposed to require 

that people contribute financially to administrative costs. Despite those legitimate purposes, when people 

do not have the ability to pay fines and fees, those obligations can hinder them from taking positive steps 

to improve their lives and fulfill other important responsibilities. OJD will pursue legislation to enable 

people to successfully satisfy judgments for fines and fees, and will continue to work closely with judges, 

staff, and stakeholders to improve court practices in the imposition and collection of fines and fees.

wide need for unique and appropriately tailored 

services for those who have mental or behavioral 

health challenges. The Chief Justice has created a 

Behavioral Health Advisory Committee (BHAC) 

to develop policies and procedures to effectively, 

efficiently, and humanely serve individuals with 

such challenges. In doing so, the BHAC will work 

closely with the courts, governmental partners, and 

other mental and behavioral health committees and 

stakeholders.

1.3	 We	will	seek	funding	to	launch	a	

conservatorship pilot project	to	
audit	court-ordered	conservatorships	
and	ensure	that	the	assets	of	people	
who	are	unable	to	manage	their	
financial	affairs	are	protected	from	
waste	or	fraud.

A conservator is a person appointed by the court 

to protect the interests of another person who 

is not capable of making independent decisions. 

A conservator is responsible for managing the 

person’s finances and property, and must maintain and deliver financial records to the court. OJD 

oversees conservators and the records that they file. OJD will seek funding for a pilot project to audit 

conservatorship records in selected courts to ensure that conservators have not engaged in fraud or abuse. 

In designing the pilot project, OJD will work closely with Oregon’s Office of the Public Guardian, local 

communities, social services providers, law enforcement, advocates, and stakeholders.

changes. We will model this program after the interagency and interdisciplinary work of Oregon’s 

Juvenile Dependency Court Improvement Program and plan to create trainings, best practices, 

communication models, and policies that will continue to serve Oregon’s youth, victims of delinquent 

conduct, and all their families.

1.4	 We	will	launch	a	juvenile 

delinquency	improvement	program.

Oregon law related to juvenile delinquency 

is changing significantly, and the field of 

developmental psychology reveals the need for 

specialized responses for those who are not yet 

adults. OJD will research and plan for a statewide 

juvenile delinquency improvement program 

to ensure that Oregon’s judges, court staff, and 

stakeholders are well-positioned to manage these 

1.5	 We	will	continue	efforts	to	expand	
problem-solving	courts,	such	as	
veteran,	family,	and	mental	health	
treatment	courts.	

Oregon’s problem-solving courts are delivering 

results throughout the state. These evidence-based 

courts offer meaningful alternatives to a court’s 

historically limited role after a conviction in a 

criminal case or a disposition in a civil case. 

Oregon’s problem-solving courts provide continuous court involvement and oversight that is focused 

on rehabilitation, treatment, and restorative justice solutions. While problem-solving courts require an 

increase in judicial involvement and the time required to resolve a case, they have been found to lower 

recidivism, improve participation in treatment services, reduce the use of foster care, and garner long-

term savings for both state and local budgets. OJD will continue to advocate and develop support for 

these programs, and their ongoing success. 

1.6	 We	will	work	with	stakeholders	to	ensure	that	Oregon	has	an	effective	and	

consistent	statewide	pretrial release	system.	

Oregon’s Public Safety Task Force (PSTF) has been studying security release, and its statutory scheme, 

and has identified several problems with using money as a tool to secure release. Most significantly, it 

decreases access and fairness in the court system. Those who are unable to pay for release are routinely 

sentenced to longer periods of incarceration, resulting in loss of family and livelihood. Additionally, 

public safety outcomes are better when release decisions are based on an assessment of community risk 

and the likelihood of returning to court. Use of a pretrial risk tool and improved pretrial practices can 

produce other benefits including reduced jail crowding, fewer failures to appear, improved public safety 

outcomes, and significant savings. Oregon courts must be ready to join in efforts to ensure that Oregon 

pretrial release is informed by data, updated to reflect best practices, and applied consistently throughout 

3

the state.

Commitment 2

We will improve access to justice 
by eliminating barriers; continuing 
to simplify and streamline our 
processes and forms; enhancing 
service options; leveraging 
technology; improving interpreter 
services; and advocating for 
resources to keep courts open, 
safe, and secure.

4

Commitment 2 — Initiatives

These cases, and others in which parties lack representation, often have significant impacts on 

Oregonians and their families.

OJD is committed to making it easier for self-represented litigants to obtain legal services, access court 

services, understand court procedures, and advocate effectively for themselves. To deliver on that 

commitment, OJD will collaborate with justice system partners to improve online access, statewide 

forms, facilitation services, and educational resources.

2.1	 We	will	launch	and	participate	in	
collaborative	initiatives	to	better	
serve self-represented litigants 
throughout	the	state.	

When Oregonians seek legal services, access and 

affordability present significant challenges across 

the state. In many cases, even moderate-income 

families struggle to find affordable representation. 

Consequently, in more than 80% of cases involving 

the dissolution of marriages, custody of children, 

domestic violence protective orders, and housing, 

at least one party is not represented by a lawyer.

2.2	 We	will	explore	the	use	of	

technology	to	improve	our	
communications	with,	and	services	
for,	all	court	users,	including	those	
with	challenges	due	to	limited	time,	
location,	or	capacity.
New technology enables courts to expand 

communication and engagement in innovative 

ways. Smart phones and internet-based services 

provide opportunities to connect with those 

who have limitations due to work, family, 

health, transportation, poverty, language, or 

other challenges. OJD will investigate, and 

as appropriate, begin to implement creative 

technology solutions, including expanded eFiling 

materials, video options, text reminders, and 

online dispute resolution (ODR) programs. 

5

diverse court staff to directly serve the public in the languages used in our communities. OJD will 

strengthen efforts to support diverse and capable candidates for court interpreter certification, launching 

skill building pilot programs for interpreters and bilingual court employees who demonstrate promise 

but need more training to achieve certification. We will also seek opportunities for more translation 

of commonly used documents and forms, and will increase efforts to engage interpreters as critical 

stakeholders in the justice system.  

2.3	 We	will	launch	initiatives	to	improve		

OJD’s	ability	to	recruit,	retain,	and	
engage interpreters, and increase 
multi-language	services	across	the	
state. 

Oregon Courts are nationally recognized for 

providing interpreters in more than 100 languages 

for in-person, telephonic, and video-based language 

support across our state, but customer service 

feedback indicates that more assistance is needed. 

OJD will develop new resources to recruit language-

2.4	 We	will	examine,	assess,	and	

advocate	for	adequate resources 
to	keep	courts	open,	safe,	secure,	
and	responsive	to	the	needs	of	
Oregonians.

Access to justice includes being able to safely attend 

court proceedings and having access to court staff 

and services at convenient hours. Due to lasting 

budget cuts from the 2008-09 recession, too many 

courts are not able to remain open throughout 

normal business hours. Moreover, many also lack 

secure premises or security staff at a time when 

protection from harassment and violence is needed 

more than ever before. 

OJD will build the foundation necessary to keep 

courts open, safe, secure, and responsive. To reach 

that goal, OJD will examine and assess resource gaps and will continue to work with county and state 

officials to ensure that there is broad recognition and support for court security.

6

Commitment 3

We will enhance the public’s 
trust and confidence in Oregon’s 
state government, including the 
judicial branch, by listening and 
responding to the needs of those 
we serve; holding ourselves to high 
standards; and communicating 
the role of our courts in providing 
justice for all.

7

Commitment 3 — Initiatives

3.1		 We	will	launch	community	outreach and engagement	initiatives	in	all	judicial	

districts,	with	the	goal	of	listening	and	responding	to	the	needs	of	those	who	rely	
on	our	courts.	  

Oregon courts are a critical part of the welfare of communities, and we serve those communities better 

when we listen and collaborate. OJD will provide tools and options for each judicial district to conduct 

outreach, so that we can determine whether our courts are meeting community needs and address the 

interests of the public and our justice system partners. Tools and options may include written, telephone, 

or text surveys; listening sessions; and the creation of community advisory groups. 

3.2	 We	will	expand	transparency and 

public education	by	communicating	
the	work	of	our	courts.	
The Chief Justice has established a statewide 

communications committee that will provide 

information and devise tools that judicial districts 

can use to inform the public about the services that 

our courts provide, initiatives that our courts are 

undertaking, and the role that our courts play in our 

democracy. The Communications Committee will 

make that information and those tools available 

to each judicial district, and each will develop and 

implement a plan to regularly inform the public 

about the work of our courts.

3.3	 We	will	develop	data-driven	

performance measures and 
analyze	our	effectiveness.			
Measuring and evaluating court work improves 

the administration of justice. OJD will continue 

to develop reliable data sets by documenting data 

entry protocols and providing training to staff to 

ensure that consistent data entry practices are 

utilized across the state. OJD will develop expectations for judicial performance and set standards of 

efficiency and procedural fairness. To enable judges and staff to meet those expectations and standards, 

we will provide training and measure improvement.  

8

3.4	 We	will	assist	the	Office of Public 
Defense Services	in	its	efforts	to	
monitor	attorney	caseloads	and	
performance.

OJD will support Oregon’s Office of Public Defense 

Services (OPDS) in its mission to provide qualified 

individuals with quality legal representation by 

assisting OPDS in its efforts to adopt an effective fi-

nancial case management system and improve both 

data collection and caseload analysis.

3.5	 We	will	pursue	the	resources	

necessary	to	ensure	that	our	judicial	
branch	is	on	sound financial 
footing	for	the	next	generation	of	
Oregonians.	

OJD has benefitted greatly from recent legislative 

funding increases. Despite those improvements, 

our judicial budget remains below what is needed 

to effectively deliver timely court services. Judicial 

compensation also remains below what is needed to 

attract and retain qualified and experienced judges. 

OJD will continue to work with stakeholders to 

encourage investment in our state justice system 

and obtain the funding necessary to provide timely 

and complete justice for all Oregonians. Those 

efforts are critical to our democracy, our system of 

government, and the protection of generations that 

will follow us.

9

Commitment 4 

We will create a workplace and 
courthouse culture that is supportive, 
inclusive, welcoming, and affirming; 
that embraces diversity; and where 
all people can thrive and are treated 
with respect and dignity.

10

Commitment 4 — Initiatives

We also will develop tools to improve outreach and engagement with diverse communities, so that we 

can better understand intersecting challenges to the fair and equitable administration of justice for all 

Oregonians. 

4.1	 We	will	provide	judges	and	staff	with	

ongoing	education	and	training	in	
the	areas	of	diversity, equity, and 
inclusion. 

Diversity, equity, and inclusion in our courts begins 

with judges and staff. OJD will launch new training 

and education programs related to diversity, 

equity, inclusion, and cultural competency. We 

will provide trainings on how to engage in difficult 

conversations, develop leaders who demonstrate 

and model inclusive and equitable behaviors, and 

increase workforce diversity through recruitment, 

outreach, career development, and promotion. 

4.2	 We	will	offer	OJD-led	education	

and	training	to	all	court security 
personnel	in	the	areas	of	diversity,	
equity,	and	inclusion.	

Since the creation of the OJD Marshal’s Office, the 

judicial branch has developed and provided training 

for security personnel who work in our courthouses 

in partnership with the Oregon State Sheriffs’ 

Association (OSSA) and Oregon’s Department of 

Public Safety Standards and Training (DPSST). 

To ensure that our courts are accessible, welcoming, and inclusive, security officers must be prepared 

to appropriately respond to the unique needs and perspectives of our court users. OJD will collaborate 

with law enforcement and private security contractors to provide supplemental training to court 

security personnel that is focused on inclusivity and providing responsive services to the diverse users 

of our courts. This training will give security personnel additional tools necessary to appropriately and 

competently serve all who come to the courthouse. 

11

4.3	 We	will	launch	initiatives	to	enhance		

 workplace collaboration,	peer-to-
peer engagement, and wellness 
among	staff	and	judges.
Oregon courts serve individuals across broad 

geographic locations, and each judicial district 

operates with significant independence. The 

geographic separation has made it difficult for 

peers to collaborate across the state. OJD will 

bring judges and staff together in new, creative 

ways to share skills and knowledge, and engage in 

collaborative problem-solving, through means such 

as expanded use of electronic communication tools, 

statewide training, education, and committee work. 

OJD also will invest in tools to improve staff and judicial wellness and make those tools available to those 

who volunteer in the courts. We will consider tools that address vicarious trauma, mindfulness, and stress 

management.  

4.4	 We	will	begin	to	develop	a	statewide core curriculum	for	OJD	staff	and	judges	

that	includes	education	and	training	on	the	role	of	courts	in	our	democracy,	the	
mission	of	OJD,	and	how	to	provide	procedural	justice,	increase	civility,	and	best	
serve	those	who	use	our	courts.	

OJD must provide training to staff and judges on the technical aspects of each court’s functions, but it 

is essential to the public’s trust and confidence in government that staff and judges fulfill our mission, 

provide procedural fairness, and serve all community members in a way that is respectful and welcoming.  

OJD will begin to develop a statewide core curriculum for staff and judges focused on enhancing those 

efforts.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
