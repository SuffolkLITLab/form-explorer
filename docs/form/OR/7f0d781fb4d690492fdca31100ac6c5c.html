Language Access Planning Technical Assistance Tool for Courts, February 2014 

Overview 

This language access planning and technical assistance tool for courts was created by the 

Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, Federal Coordination and Compliance Section 
(DOJ), to assist courts and court systems as they develop comprehensive language access 
programs.  This tool was developed in response to requests for technical assistance from courts 
and others involved in planning and implementing measures to improve language assistance 
services in courts for limited English proficient (LEP) individuals.  We received many helpful 
comments and feedback to the draft version of this tool from attorneys, judges, court staff, 
advocates, community groups, state court systems, and national state court leadership 
associations and advisory committee members.  We appreciate the time, thought, and expertise 
reflected in those recommendations, all of which were considered and many of which are 
incorporated into this final version of the tool.   

The tool is intended to facilitate planning to supplement and support the growing body of 

technical assistance and other resources developed by the American Bar Association, the 
National Center for State Courts, and other national, state, and local entities.  Based on the 
Department of Justice Language Access Assessment and Planning Tool for Federally Conducted 
and Federally Assisted Programs,1 this tool is tailored for use in courts.  Just as with other 
planning tools, the focus is on identifying suggested areas of assessment and planning for courts.  
In each area, considerations are provided to identify challenges and highlight opportunities for 
improvement.  Some courts will find that they have addressed certain areas and issues in this tool 
but that other areas may need greater priority and attention.  In addition, we hope this tool will 
help courts identify which actions can be taken right away, which need focused attention and 
resources, and which require more long term planning and implementation to accomplish.  
Completing this tool neither establishes nor guarantees a court’s compliance with Title VI of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964 or other civil rights requirements.  The legal requirements for courts 
that receive federal financial assistance from DOJ have been explained in prior guidance 
documents.2  Use of the tool is of course voluntary; courts are not required to use the suggested 
considerations in this tool or submit their responses to DOJ.   

The tool is divided into sections that suggest general areas for assessment and planning.  
Following each section are suggested planning steps.  Because of vast nationwide differences in 
court structures and administrative and financial authorities and responsibilities, some 
considerations may not be applicable to every court.  Courts are encouraged to modify this tool 
to the particular needs and features of their court and court system.

What Terms are Used in the Tool? 

The terms and phrases used in this tool are defined below. 

• Court Operations – Offices, programs and services managed, controlled, contracted or funded
by the court, other than court proceedings, with which the public, parties, or witnesses may
have contact in connection with a potential or actual legal issue, claim, matter, or proceeding.
Examples can include, but are not limited to, intake or filing offices, cashiers, records rooms,
pro se clinics, and other similar operations.

• Court Proceedings – Civil and criminal hearings and trials, including court-annexed

processes or proceedings.

•

Interpreter- An individual who has received training in the skills of interpretation and can
competently render a message spoken from one language into one or more other languages.

• Limited English Proficient (LEP) – Individuals for whom English is not the primary

language or who may have a limited ability to read, write, speak, or understand English, are
limited English proficient, or ‘‘LEP.”3

• Language Access Plan (LAP) – The plan is a management document that outlines how the
court defines tasks, sets deadlines and priorities, assigns responsibility, and allocates the
resources necessary to come into or maintain compliance with language access requirements.

• Language Access Policies – Policies that set forth standards, operating principles, and

guidelines that govern the delivery of language appropriate services in court proceedings and
operations by the court and court staff.

• Language Access Procedures – Procedures that specify for court staff the steps to follow to
provide language assistance services, gather data, and deliver services to LEP individuals.

• Language Assistance Services – Oral communication by competent bilingual staff or assisted

by an authorized interpreter and written communication assisted by translation.

• Provide/Provided/Providing an Interpreter – Means appointing an interpreter free of charge

to an LEP individual. 

• Sight Translation – The reading of text written in one language by a competent interpreter

who orally translates it into another language.        

• Translator – An individual who has received training in the skills of translation and can
competently render written text from one language into one or more other languages.

• Vital Documents – A document will be considered vital and need to be translated if it

contains information critical for obtaining access to court or it is required by law.  Some
examples of vital documents that courts may need to translate to ensure that LEP individuals
are provided meaningful access can include applications, court forms, consent or complaint
forms, notices of rights, and letters or notices that require a response.

3 This tool is not intended to cover considerations regarding individuals with sensory impairments, such as visual or 
hearing; those considerations can be addressed by the DOJ Civil Rights Division, Disability Rights Section, 
available at http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/drs.

Language Access Planning Technical Assistance Tool for Courts, February 2014 

What is a Language Access Plan? 

A Language Access Plan (LAP) is a management document that outlines how the court 

defines tasks, sets deadlines and priorities, assigns responsibility, and allocates the resources 
necessary to come into or maintain compliance with language access requirements.  
Implementing the LAP will help to provide equal access to court proceedings and operations, 
improve the accuracy of communications, enhance the integrity of evidence and decision 
making, promote efficiency in operations, and comply with Title VI and its implementing 
regulations.   

For courts, the LAP identifies, prioritizes, coordinates and sets timeframes and 

responsibility for actions that are helpful to ensure that comprehensive, timely, effective, and free 
language assistance services are provided in court proceedings and operations.  The plan should 
be grounded in an assessment of existing policy, practices, and capacity; it should also reflect 
consideration of the roles to be played by court leadership and various stakeholders.  The scope 
of the plan will vary according to the system the court uses to deliver comprehensive, high 
quality, and timely language assistance services.  The LAP should also seek to obtain and 
address stakeholder feedback.  A court system that is currently delivering comprehensive 
language access services well, for example, might appropriately focus on monitoring 
performance, increasing efficiencies, and adjusting as needs change.  Policy and procedures need 
not be set out in an LAP.  Some courts prefer to include them in the LAP.

Plan Elements

A.  Existing Services and Ongoing Need for Language Assistance Services 

A court benefits from conducting an assessment of its existing language access policies 

and the extent to which such policies are being followed and implemented.  This assessment 
should provide some sense of the work needed to provide comprehensive language access and 
better inform the planning process.  In addition, ongoing assessment helps to measure current 
and future needs and to monitor progress.

B.  Court Rule 

These considerations focus on the statutes, court rules, orders, directives, or other means 

by which your court or court systems sets policy on language access.  While some of these 
considerations reflect the global issues listed in Part A, the focus here is on whether there is a 
consistent and published rule, order, directive or other policy providing notice to judges, clerks,
