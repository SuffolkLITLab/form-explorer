USING THIS BENCHBOOK 

Terminology: Throughout this benchbook, we use the term “victim” rather than “survivor” to 
describe the person being stalked. Both terms are applicable, but national sexual and domestic 
violence organizations differentiate between “victims” as those who have recently been affected 
by violence and “survivors” as those who have gone through the recovery process, or when 
discussing the short- or long-term effects of sexual/domestic violence or stalking. We have also 
chosen to use the term “stalker” in the introduction to refer to those who engage in stalking 
behaviors discussed above. “Defendant” or “Respondent” are used throughout the benchbook 
where the statute or case law use those terms.

Stalking and  
Intimate Partner Femicide: 

76% of intimate partner femicide 
victims have been stalked by their 
intimate partner. 

67% had been physically abused by 
their intimate partner. 

89% of femicide victims who had 
been physically assaulted had also 
been stalked in the 12 months 
before their murder. 

79% of abused femicide victims 
reported being stalked during the 
same period that they were abused. 

54% of femicide victims reported 
stalking to police before they were 
killed by their stalkers.

INTRODUCTION 

While stalking is a crime under the laws of all 50 states and 
U.S. territories, the definitions of stalking and related crimes 
vary from state to state. Stalking is generally defined as 
repeated and unwanted conduct directed at a specific person 
that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear or 
apprehension. Stalking is a serious, often violent crime that 
affects an estimated 7.5 million women and men each year. 
Despite its prevalence, stalking behaviors are often nuanced 
and seen as difficult to prove. Victims can have a difficult 
time recounting all the behaviors in a context that allows 
others to understand why it makes them fearful. Because of 
the ambiguity of stalking behaviors, the crime is not often 
charged or prosecuted. Judges play a critical role in holding 
offenders accountable and intervening before stalking 
escalates to more violent behavior.  

Stalking behaviors may initially seem harmless, but often 
escalate and result in long-lasting emotional and 
psychological harm. Stalking can involve severe, even lethal 
violence. Seventy-six percent of intimate partner femicide 
victims have been stalked by their intimate partner. 
Weapons are used to harm or threaten victims in 1 out of 
every 5 cases.   

  (

    W

A stalker can be someone whom the victim knows well or 
not at all. Most stalkers have dated or been involved with 
the people they stalk. Stalking is a way to maintain or regain 
control over a victim. Intimate partner stalkers frequently 
approach their targets, and their behaviors escalate quickly. 
For example, if calling and sending messages isn’t getting the results they desire, the stalker can 
then escalate to following their victim using GPS or a third party. Almost a third of stalkers have 
stalked before, 78% of stalkers use more than one means of approach, and two-thirds of stalkers 
pursue their victims at least once per week, many daily, using more than one method. Once legal 
action has been taken, this fear of loss of control is often at its most dangerous point. An 
important point to keep in mind is that stalking is a serious and often lethal crime characterized 
this information is taken from materials 
by repeated, unwanted contacts with another person that can quickly escalate.1

Advocates who regularly work with victims of domestic/sexual violence and stalking remind us 
of the following important considerations in stalking cases: 

1.  Threats made by stalkers are often implicit and may appear benign to outsiders. Allowing 
a victim to provide a narrative may provide information that is more complete, provide 
important context and better frames their experience.  

2.  Fear manifests in a variety of ways. When stalked, some people experience anxiety, 

insomnia, and/or severe depression. Other people may shut down or dissociate because of 
the trauma. When giving testimony, some people may discuss incidents with a flat affect, 
while others may sound agitated or excited. Presentation is not necessarily a reliable 
indicator of whether or not someone is afraid. 

3.  Even stalkers with no criminal history can still pose a threat to a stalking victim.  
4.  Stalkers often use technology to track or spy on victims.  
5.  Stalkers may use children they share with the victim as justification for their stalking 
behavior (e.g., frequently “checking in” on the well-being of the children during the 
victim’s parenting time.) 

6.  Stalkers often have additional opportunities to threaten, track, and/or spy on their intimate 

partners due to parenting time exchanges, previously shared technology, known 
passwords or security questions, etc. 

Most commonly reported stalking-related behaviors: 

or work 

messages 

victims go 

  Follow victims, drive by, hang out or show up wherever they are including home, school 

  Have a third-party follow or contact the victim  
  Send unwanted gifts, letters, cards, messages, or e-mails 
  Call and send messages from multiple phone numbers  
  Make unwanted phone calls, including hang-ups, and leave unwanted voicemails and text 

  Damage homes, cars, or other property 
  Monitor phone calls or computer use 
  Use technology, like hidden cameras or global positioning systems (GPS), to track where 

  Threaten to hurt victims, their family, friends, or pets.  
  Find out about their victims by using public records or online search services, hiring 
investigators, going through garbage, or contacting friends, family, neighbors, or co-
workers 

  Post information or spread rumors about their victims on the Internet, in a public place, at 

their workplace, or by word of mouth 

  Other actions that control, track, or frighten their victims 

NOTE: Behaviors that are oppressive, socially unacceptable, possibly illegal, or cause 
apprehension may not meet the statutory and legal qualifications that are required for the 
issuance of a stalking protective order.

Mandatory Arrest for Violation of Stalking Protective Order 

OVERVIEW 

The basic statutory framework for stalking protective orders is set forth in two separate areas of 
Oregon statutes: a civil-petition process for a petitioner to obtain a stalking protective order, and 
a process for courts to issue a stalking protective order after a law enforcement officer has issued 
a citation. This benchbook will cover both processes for issuing a stalking protective order.   

ORS 30.866 provides authority for a petitioner to obtain a stalking protective order via an ex 
parte, civil-petition process.   

ORS 163.730-755 provides authority for issuing a stalking protective order after a law 
enforcement officer has issued a citation as a result of a citizen complaint. The citation does not 
charge a defendant with the crime of stalking under ORS 163.732 or prohibit contact, but rather 
initiates a process that can lead to a court-issued stalking protective order. [Note that ORS 
30.866(2) and (11) cross reference ORS 163.730 and ORS 163.732, statutes that are part of the 
officer citation process.]  

Under ORS 163.732, stalking is also a crime. The elements for the crime of stalking differ 
slightly from those required for issuance of a stalking protective order. The mandatory arrest 
statute, ORS 133.310(3), applies to violations of stalking protective orders. Violation of a court’s 
stalking protective order is a class A misdemeanor or, if the respondent has a prior conviction for 
stalking or violating a court’s stalking protective order, a class C felony. ORS 163.750(2). 

A summary of Oregon appellate stalking cases follows this outline, and review of the summaries 
is essential since these cases are very fact specific. The cases make clear that the trial court 
record must contain facts that support each element of a claim.

Venue (ORS 14.080(1)) 
A Stalking Protective Order (SPO) petition 
must be filed in the county where the 
respondent lives or where the unwanted 
contacts took place. No minimum period of 
residence is required. 
 
Relationship Between the Parties (ORS 
30.866) 
Any person may petition for a court’s stalking 
protective order or damages, or both. 
 
Minor Petitioners  
A person under the age of 18 may petition for 
a SPO. 
The court will need to appoint a guardian ad 
litem if the petitioner is an unemancipated 
minor child. The person who will be the 
guardian ad litem must first file an 
application for a guardian ad litem. 
 
Timing of the Conduct (ORS 30.866(6)) 
Stalking contacts must have occurred within 
the last 2 years.  
 
Showing Required (ORS 30.866(1)) 
A petitioner may bring a civil action for a 
stalking protective order or for damages, or 
both, if:

Case Law –  “Alarm” 
A contact is alarming if it causes apprehension or fear 
resulting from the perception of danger, which means a 
threat of physical injury, and not merely a threat of 
annoyance or harassment.  C.Q.R. v. Wafula, 305 Or 
App 344 (2020); C.J.R. v. Fleming, 265 Or App 342 
(2014); S.A.B. v. Roach, 249 Or App 579 (2012). 

acts are insufficient with contact that is unwanted and 

makes Petitioner uncomfortable but is not the sort of 
behavior that would objectively cause apprehension or 
fear resulting from the perception of danger, and 
Petitioner did not indicate concern about personal 
safety.   K.A.L. v. Hinkle, 288 Or App 341 (2017). 

here must be subjective alarm. See Cress v. Cress, 
175 Or App 599 (2001) (contacts “unnerved” and made 
Petitioner “extremely upset,” which did not satisfy 
burden of proving she was afraid for her physical 
safety); V.L.M. v. Miley, 264 Or App 719 (2014) (court 
reversed because Petitioner did not testify she was 
scared and there was no history of violence or abuse in 
the relationship with Respondent); Pike v. Knight, 234 
Or App 128 (2010) (court found significant in 
reversing issuance of SPO the fact that Petitioner was 
annoyed and irritated by Respondent’s behavior, but 
did not testify she was alarmed or coerced).  

nstances may arise where the other person initially 
believes a contact to be innocuous and later 
understands the contact in a new light and only then 
becomes alarmed. See Schiffner v. Banks, 177 Or App 
86 (2001).  

larm as used in the stalking statute ultimately 

contemplates a reasonable apprehension of physical 
harm. See Schiffner v. Banks, 177 Or App 86 (2001).

b)  It is objectively reasonable for a person in 
the petitioner’s situation to have been 
alarmed or coerced by the contact, and 
 

c)  The repeated and unwanted contact causes 
the petitioner reasonable apprehension 
regarding the personal safety of the 
petitioner or a member of the petitioner’s 
immediate family or household.

“Alarm” means to cause apprehension or fear 
resulting from the perception of danger.

Case Law – “Repeated” 
A single contact cannot become multiple contacts, even 
if it could count as a contact under more than one 
section of the statutory definition of “contact.”  
Goodness v. Beckham, 224 Or App 565 (2008).  

ach contact must independently cause subjective and 

objective harm. K.M.V. v. Williams, 271 Or App 466 
(2015). 
 
Case Law- “Unwanted” 
(For civil order), the person doing the contacting was 
subjectively aware of a substantial and unjustifiable 
risk that the contact was unwanted by the recipient, and 
then consciously and unreasonably disregarded that 
risk.  Giri v. C.S.D., 232 Or App 62 (2009).  

ee C.Q.R. v. Wafula, 305 Or App 344, 471 P3d 
786 (2020); Pinkham v. Brubaker, 178 Or App 
360 (2001) (contacts that “might appear innocuous 
when viewed in isolation often take on a different 
character” when viewed in context); Boyd v. Essin, 
170 Or App 509 (2000) (where Petitioner had 
FAPA against Respondent, driving by the family 
home and watching it with binoculars were 
reasonably alarming contacts in this context); see 
also, Weatherly v. Wilkie, 169 Or App 257 (2000); 
Schiffner v. Banks, 177 Or App 86 (2001). 

an look at conduct outside of the two years for 
context. See Smith v. Di Marco, 207 Or App 558 
(2006) (threat to break Petitioner’s legs well over 
two years prior can be considered as context for

“Coerce” means to restrain, compel or 
dominate by force or threat.   
 
“Immediate family” means father, mother, 
child, sibling, spouse, grandparent, stepparent, 
and stepchild.  

ote: The definition of immediate family 

members does not require that they “cohabit.” 
 
“Household member” means any person 
residing in the same residence as the victim.  

ote: This is not the same as the “family or 
household member” definition for purposes of 
“domestic violence” or eligibility for FAPA 
protection order. 
 
“Repeated” means two or more times. 
 

“Unwanted” means there must be reasonable 
notice to the respondent that the contact is not 
wanted.

innocent misunderstandings, the court should 
consider the context of the parties’ entire 
history.

ven when there is clearly some wanted or 
permitted contact, there can be a finding that 
contact is unwanted if the contact exceeded 
the scope of permission and the respondent 
knew or should have known it was unwanted.

other contacts); Jones v. Lindsey, 193 Or App 674 
(2004) (physical altercation which occurred more 
than two years before the petition cannot be the 
sole basis of the alarm required to issue the SPO; 
at most, incident can be considered to determine if 
subsequent conduct might take on a different 
character when viewed against the backdrop of the 
prior behavior). 

xpressive contacts may be used as relevant 
context. Van Buskirk v. Ryan, 233 Or App 170 
(2010) (communication-based contacts that do not 
in and of themselves establish the basis for the 
SPO can provide context for other 
noncommunicative contacts); Wood v. Trow, 228 
Or App 600 (2009) (same). Amarillas v. White, 
253 Or App 754 (2012) (same); Farris v. Johnson, 
222 Or App 377 (2008) (same); Castro v. 
Heinzman, 194 Or App 7 (2004) (same).  
 
Case Law – “Contact” 
Not an exclusive list of types of contact that can 
qualify for purposes of repeated and unwanted 
contacts.  A.A.C. v. Miller-Pomlee, 296 Or App 816 
(2019). 

ollowing Petitioner by car and watching with 

binoculars at a distance qualify as unwanted contacts. 
Smith v. Di Marco, 207 Or App 558 (2006). 

hredding clothing of Petitioner is an unwanted 
contact.  Pinkham v. Brubaker, 178 Or App 360 
(2001). 

ase Law – “Expressive Contact” 

(denoted with a * in the left column) 
If stalking contacts are purely communicative, 
contact must contain an unambiguous, 
unequivocal, and specific threat, and Petitioner 
must believe the respondent intends to carry out 
the threat.  State v. Rangel, 328 Or 294 (1999). 

 speech-based contact counts only if it constitutes a 
threat and a proscribable threat is a communication that 
instills in the addressee a fear of imminent and serious 
personal violence from the speaker, is unequivocal, and 
is objectively likely to be followed by unlawful acts.  
State v. Rangel, 328 Or 294 (1999). 

xpressive contacts must cause reasonable 

apprehension or alarm in the victim and must involve 
unequivocal threats that instill a fear of imminent and 
serious personal violence and are objectively likely to

ven if communications do not meet the standard 

set forth in State v. Rangel, they can be used to

contacts may be used as relevant context. Van 
Buskirk v. Ryan, 233 Or App 170 (2010); Wood v. 
Trow, 228 Or App 600 (2009); Amarillas v. White, 
253 Or App 754 (2012); Farris v. Johnson, 222 Or

is objectively likely to be followed by unlawful acts.  
T.B. v. Holm, 248 Or App 414 (2012) 

Taunting and inciting to fight through purely 
expressive conduct does not constitute a “threat.”  
Communication that is hyperbole, rhetorical excess, 
and impotent expressions of anger or frustration can 
sometimes be privileged even if it alarms the 
addressee.  State v. Jackson, 259 Or App 248 (2013). 

hone calls during which defendant did not speak 

are not expressive acts and are sufficient to be a 
contact under ORS 163.730. State v. Shields, 184 
Or App 505 (2002). 
 
Case Law – “Reasonable” 
The reasonable person standard should take into 
account the reality of the petitioner’s life, see, e.g., 
Bryant v. Walker, 190 Or App 253 (2003), rev granted 
May 2004 (based on the realities of men’s and 
women’s lives, reasonable women are likely to 
experience fear in situations where reasonable men 
would not); T.B. v. Holm, 248 Or App 414 (2012) (trial 
court found it was reasonable for a person who wore a 
leg brace and walked with the assistance of a cane to 
be intimidated by a person riding a lawnmower beside 
them); D.W.C. v. Carter/Bosket, 261 Or App 133 
(2014) (consolidated with Christensen v. Bosket) 
(approaching with clenched fists and angrily yelling 
might not have met the objectively reasonable alarm 
requirement, but did when considered in context with 
Respondent’s use of homophobic slurs against the gay 
petitioner).

The fear must be objectively reasonable:  Utilize the 
Reasonable Person standard. 

-  Conduct may appear benign when viewed in 

isolation but can take on a different character when 
viewed either in combination with or against the 
backdrop of one party’s aggressive behavior 
toward the other.  E.T. v. Belete, 266 Or App 650 
(2014). 

  Gender may be considered.  Bryant v. Walker, 190 

Or App 253 (2003) 

  Disability may be considered.  T.B. v. Holm, 248 

Or App 414 (2012) 

  Although each contact must give rise to alarm, the 
contacts should be viewed in context in order to 
determine whether they give rise to objectively 
reasonable alarm. C.J.R. v. Fleming, 265 Or App 
342 (2014)  

ee, e.g., E.T. v. Belete, 266 Or App 650 (2014) 
(Petitioner was objectively alarmed where Respondent 
attempted to assault Petitioner and threw trash can 
while yelling and told Petitioner “you will depart this 
church either dead or alive”); C.P. v. Mittelbach, 304 
Or App 569, 579 (2020) (Petitioner’s apprehension was 
objectively reasonable where Respondent, a recently 
fired and emotionally distraught former employee who 
was increasingly fixated on and angry at Petitioner, 
repeatedly engaged in unwanted contacts at place of 
worship despite police warnings and presence where 
Petitioner “was reliably informed[] stalker behavior 
was particularly brazen”). 

But see, K.A.L. v. Hinkle, 288 Or App 341 (2017) 
(merely waiting outside home or leaving bottle of wine 
on doorstop are not objectively alarming); J.D.K. v. 
W.T.F., 276 Or App 533 (2016) (unwanted romantic 
overtures in the absence of inherently threatening 
contacts are not objectively alarming without 
something more); J.L.B. v. K.P.B., 250 Or App 122 
(2012) (not reasonable to be alarmed where 
Respondent repeatedly drove past Petitioner’s house 
and took photographs because parties had to 
communicate about parenting time and financial 
matters, and there was no violence or abuse in the 
record).  
 
Case Law – “Personal Safety” 
“Personal safety” is the state of a particular individual 
being free from danger or harm. Delgado v. Souders,

“Personal Safety”

elgado v. Souders, 334 Or 122, 151-52 (2002) (the 
term personal safety does not encompass apprehension 
of harm other than physical harm); Osborne v. Fadden, 
225 Or App 431 (2009) (applying less stringent 
standard for non-expressive contacts, Court of Appeals 
found that sending 2000 emails, harassing phone calls 
to family and friends, opening credit accounts, signing 
up for subscriptions and mail order services would not 
cause Petitioners to have reasonable apprehension 
about their personal safety). 

easonable apprehension regarding personal safety 
must be pleaded and proved. See Cress v. Cress, 175 
Or App 599 (2001) and Lowrance v. Trow, 225 Or App 
250 (2009) (must actually have apprehension regarding 
personal safety).

(Petitioner’s apprehension regarding personal safety 
was not reasonable where Respondent drove and 
weaved through cul-de-sac, had car in neighbor’s 
driveway, and did not use threatening language); W.M.

tearful or upset is insufficient proof of apprehension 
about personal safety). 
 
 

III. HEARING PROCESS (ORS 30.866) 
 
Initial Uncontested Ex Parte Hearing 

 

nlike the FAPA statute, SPO statute ORS 

30.866 does not specifically authorize ex 
parte appearances. The statute does state, 
however, that the court must enter a 
temporary order upon the required showing 
“at the time the petition is filed” and that 
service on the respondent must then occur, so 
the ex parte nature of the request is strongly 
supported. In practice, most courts consider 
SPO petitions at ex parte hearings on the 
same docket as FAPA petitions. Most courts 
require in-person appearances at ex parte 
hearings and allow telephone hearings when 
appropriate. 
 

  U

13 
 

ORS 30.866(2). But see, K.H. v. Mitchell, 174 Or App 
262 (2001) (where Respondent lived next to Petitioner, 
an SPO prohibiting all contact was overly broad and 
Court of Appeals modified order to prohibit intentional 
contact); O’Neil v. Goldsmith, 177 Or App 164 (2001), 
rev den 333 Or 595 (2002) (where parties live in a very 
small town, it was overly burdensome to prohibit from 
“intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly” coming into 
Petitioner’s physical or visual presence, so Court of 
Appeals modified to prohibit only “intentionally” 
doing so). 

The standard of proof is probable cause based 
on the petitioner’s allegations. 

he court must enter a temporary SPO if the 

following showing is met: 
a)  The respondent intentionally, knowingly, 
or recklessly engaged in repeated and 
unwanted contact with the petitioner or a 
member of the petitioner’s immediate 
family or household thereby alarming or 
coercing the petitioner; 

b)  It is objectively reasonable for a person in 
the petitioner’s situation to have been 
alarmed or coerced by the contact, and 
c)  The repeated and unwanted contact causes 
the petitioner reasonable apprehension 
regarding the personal safety of the 
petitioner or a member of the petitioner’s 
immediate family or household; and 
d)  There are at least two contacts giving rise 

to the claim that occurred within two years 
of the filing of the petition.

elief Granted at Initial Ex Parte Hearing 

he relief may include, but is not limited to, 

prohibiting all contact as defined by ORS 
163.730.  
(See examples of prohibited contact in Section 
II: Definitions above) 

he court must issue an order to show cause 

why the temporary order should not be 
continued for an indefinite time.  

ote: There is no statutory authority which 

requires a show cause hearing to be held 
within a certain amount of time.

Note: ORS 30.866 does not include the “unless 
Respondent appeared at the initial hearing” exception 
to personal service. However, if Petitioner and 
Respondent are both before the court ex parte in an 
SPO application (under ORS 30.866), the exception to 
service in ORS 163.741 would reasonably be 
applicable.   

The petition is not evidence without testimony. Jones 
v. Lindsey, 193 Or App 674 (2004) and Falkenstein v. 
Falkenstein, 236 Or App 445 (2010); Lomax v. Carr, 
194 Or App 518 (2004 (averments of statutory citation 
do not allege all the elements required for a permanent 
SPO and they do not conclusively prove those 
elements, thus requiring an evidentiary hearing).  

If the petitioner testifies that everything in the petition 
is true, however, it is sufficient to bring all of the 
allegations of the petition into evidence. Lowrance v. 
Trow, 225 Or App 250 (2009); but see Faulkenstein v. 
Faulkenstein, 236 Or App 445 (2010) (the evidentiary 
record is limited to the evidence received at the SPO 
hearing and does not include the factual allegations in 
the petition unless those allegations are admitted by the 
respondent). 

hile the respondent has the right to present witnesses 

and cross-examine adverse witnesses, there is no 
authority for the proposition that the court must advise 
a respondent of these rights. See Miller v. Leighty, 158 
Or App 218 (1999); see also J.D. v. S.K., 282 Or App

IV. SERVICE (ORS 163.741) 
 
Service on the respondent is by personal 
delivery of a copy of the order unless the 
order notes that the respondent appeared at 
the initial hearing in person before the court. 

ntry of a final SPO is improper without 
service of the petition and temporary SPO. 

hen a stalking protective order is terminated 

by order of the court, the clerk of the court 
shall immediately deliver a copy of the 
termination order to the county sheriff with 
whom the original order was filed. Upon 
receipt of the termination order, the county 
sheriff shall promptly remove the original 
order from the Law Enforcement Data System 
and the databases of the National Crime 
Information Center of the United States 
Department of Justice.

examination does not constitute a denial of the right to 
cross-examine). 
 
Except for purposes of impeachment, a statement made 
by the respondent at a hearing under this section may 
not be used as evidence in a prosecution for stalking as 
defined in ORS 163.732, or for violation of a court’s 
stalking protective order. ORS 30.866(12)     

he petitioner may appear by phone as there is no 

constitutional right to confront the petitioner. Article 1, 
Section 11, of the Oregon Constitution states that the 
right to confront witnesses face to face applies in a 
criminal prosecution. At a contested hearing on a 
stalking protective order under ORS 30.866, the 
protections for “criminal prosecutions” set forth in 
Article 1, Section 11, do not apply; accordingly, 
respondent is not entitled to the constitutional 
safeguards set out in that provision (such as a right to a 
jury trial) Delgado v. Souders, 334 Or 122. 
Additionally, at a contested hearing, the court may take 
any action provided in ORS 163.738. ORS 
30.866(3)(a). ORS 163.738(2)(a) permits the petitioner 
to testify by phone.

claims for damages. M.K.F. v. Miramontes, 352 Or 401

Ordering a Permanent Stalking Protective 
Order

following showing is met: 
a)  The respondent intentionally, knowingly, 
or recklessly engaged in repeated and 
unwanted contact with the petitioner or a 
member of the petitioner’s immediate 
family or household thereby alarming or 
coercing the petitioner; 

b)  It is objectively reasonable for a person in 
the petitioner’s situation to have been 
alarmed or coerced by the contact, and 
c)  The repeated and unwanted contact causes 
the petitioner reasonable apprehension 
regarding the personal safety of the 
petitioner or a member of the petitioner’s 
immediate family or household; and 
d)  There are at least two contacts giving rise 

to the claim that occurred within two years 
of the filing of the petition.

cause hearing after being served, the court 
may issue a warrant for arrest. 
 
VI. RELIEF GRANTED IN 
PERMANENT SPO 
 
The relief may include, but is not limited to: 

)  Prohibiting all contact as defined by ORS 

163.730; 

)  Ordering the respondent to undergo 

mental health evaluation and treatment if 
indicated by the evaluation. If the 
respondent does not have the resources to 
do either, the Court may refer the

judgment containing the amount of fees and costs is 
issued. See Matthews v. Hutchcraft, 221 Or App 479 
(2008). 

or example, relief under the Family Abuse Prevention 
Act is available concurrently with relief under the SPO 
statute. However, the court does not have the authority 
to impose a SPO sua sponte where a FAPA was 
originally filed. See N.R.J. v P.K., 256 Or App 514 
(2013). 

ome remedies may constitute an abuse of discretion. 

See, e.g., State v. Baker, 235 Or App 321 (2010) 
(extending defendant’s probation in telephonic 
harassment case to avoid a related SPO hearing without 
the agreement of both parties constituted an abuse of 
discretion). 

The legislature’s use of the word ‘shall’ requires a 
court to enter a stalking protective order if it finds a 
violation of the statute, but its use of the word ‘may’ 
makes clear that the scope of the order remains 
discretionary. See Shook v. Ackert, 152 Or App 224, 
230, (1998) (recognizing that discretion). In exercising 
its discretion, a court should weigh the need to protect 
the victim against the restrictions placed on the 
respondent. Cf. Martin v. Board of Parole, 327 Or 147, 
160 n. 5 (1998). On de novo review, we modify the 
reach of the court’s order. See PGE v. Duncan, 
Weinberg, Miller & Pembroke, P.C., 162 Or App 265 
(1999) (modifying the scope of a permanent injunction 
that swept too broadly).”  See also K.H. v. Mitchell,

IX. TERMINATION OF STALKING 
PROTECTIVE ORDERS  
Though there is no statutory authority to 
terminate a stalking protective order, in  
Edwards v. J.B., 203 Or App 271 (2005), the 
Oregon Court of Appeals held that the court 
may terminate a stalking protective order 
under ORS 163.741(3) when, “on the 
respondent’s motion, a court finds that the 
criteria for issuing the order under [the 
statute] are no longer present.”  Edwards, 203 
Or App at 277. In situations in which no new 
contacts causing objectively reasonable 
apprehension have occurred, the court must 
determine the subjective prong, i.e., “whether 
petitioner continues to suffer ‘reasonable 
apprehension’ due to the past acts of the 
respondent under ORS 163.738(2)(a)(B)(iii).” 
Edwards, 203 Or App at 277.  

peech constitutionally protected under State 

v. Rangel, 328 Or 294 (1999) can be 
considered in examining the objective and 
subjective “apprehension” elements in a 
termination hearing.  C.L.C. v. Bowman, 249

A person commits the crime of stalking if: 

 

 

) The person knowingly alarms or coerces 

another person or a members of that 
person’s immediate family or household by 
engaging in repeated and unwanted contact 
with the person; 

) It is objectively reasonable for a person in 
the victim’s situation to have been alarmed

) The repeated and unwanted contact causes 

the victim reasonable apprehension

ontact that is unwanted and makes Petitioner

K.A.L. v. Hinkle, 288 Or App 341 (2017). 

here must be subjective alarm. See Cress v. Cress, 
175 Or App 599 (2001) (contacts “unnerved” and made 
Petitioner “extremely upset,” which did not satisfy 
burden of proving she was afraid for her physical 
safety); V.M. v. Miley, 264 Or App 719 (2014) (court

Case Law – “Repeated” 
A single contact cannot become multiple contacts, even 
if it could count as a contact under more than one 
section of the statutory definition of “contact.”  
Goodness v. Beckham, 224 Or App 565 (2008).  

ach contact must independently cause subjective and 

objective harm. K.M.V. v. Williams, 271 Or App 466 
(2015). 
 
Case Law – “Unwanted” 
(For civil order), the person doing the contacting was 
subjectively aware of a substantial and unjustifiable 
risk that the contact was unwanted by the recipient, and 
then consciously and unreasonably disregarded that 
risk.  Giri v. C.S.D., 232 Or App 62 (2009).  

cGinnis-Aitken v. Bronson, 235 Or App 189 (2010) 
(sending text message stating “being away from you is 
the kind of thing I could do” did not put Respondent on 
notice that future contact was unwanted); Edwards v. 
Lostrom, 224 Or App 253 (2008) (must prove mental 
state that Respondent knew his behavior would result 
in unwanted contact); Courtemanche v. Milligan, 205 
Or App 244 (2006) (same); Tumbleson v. Rodriguez, 
189 Or App 393 (2003) (contact not unwanted when 
Respondent arrived uninvited, was told to leave, and 
then was granted permission to stay for the night).  

ome contacts are so offensive, the court can infer that 
the respondent knew or should have known they were 
unwanted, see e.g., K.H. v. Mitchell, 174 Or App 262 
(2001) (sexual phone calls that, if not consensual, 
would constitute the crimes of sodomy and rape). 

o distinguish unwanted contact from innocent 
misunderstandings, the court should consider the 
context of the parties’ entire history. See M.D.O. v. 
Desantis, 302 Or App 751, 759, 461 P3d 1066, 1072 
(2020) (“unwanted contacts must be consider in the 
context of the parties entire history…So viewed, 
contacts that ‘might appear innocuous in isolation often 
takes on a different character;’ highly acrimonious 
relationship rendered objectively reasonable fear of 
being closely followed for 15 miles in “farm country” 
with no one else around). Pinkham v. Brubaker, 178 Or 
App 360 (2001) (contacts that “might appear 
innocuous when viewed in isolation often take on a 
different character” when viewed in context); Boyd v. 
Essin, 170 Or App 509 (2000), (where Petitioner had 
FAPA against Respondent, driving by the family home 
and watching it with binoculars were reasonably

v. Wilkie, 169 Or App 257 (2000); Schiffner v. Banks, 
177 Or App 86 (2001). 

an look at conduct outside of the two years for 
context. See Smith v. Di Marco, 207 Or App 558 
(2006) (threat to break Petitioner’s legs well over two 
years prior can be considered as context for other 
contacts); Jones v. Lindsey, 193 Or App 674 (2004) 
(physical altercation which occurred more than two 
years before the petition cannot be the sole basis of the 
alarm required to issue the SPO; at most, incident can 
be considered to determine if subsequent conduct 
might take on a different character when viewed 
against the backdrop of the prior behavior). 

ven when there is clearly some wanted or permitted 
contact, there can be a finding that contact is unwanted 
if the contact exceeded the scope of permission and the 
respondent knew or should have known it was 
unwanted. 
 
Case Law – “Contact” 
Not an exclusive list of types of contact that can 
qualify for purposes of repeated and unwanted 
contacts.  A.A.C. v. Miller-Pomlee, 296 Or App 816 
(2019). 

ollowing Petitioner by car and watching with 

binoculars at a distance qualify as unwanted contacts. 
Smith v. Di Marco, 207 Or App 558 (2006). 

hredding clothing of Petitioner is an unwanted 
contact.  Pinkham v. Brubaker, 178 Or App 360 
(2001).

xpressive contacts include contact that must be 

evaluated in light of the constitutional protections for 
free speech. 
 

-  Expressive contacts must cause reasonable 

apprehension or alarm in the victim, and must 
involve unequivocal threats that instill a fear of 
imminent and serious personal violence and are 
objectively likely to be followed by unlawful acts.  
State v. Ryan, 237 Or App 317 (2010). 

  Expressive contacts are those that involve speech, 
either oral or written.  D.W.C. v. Carter, 261 Or 
App 133 (2014). 
 

-  A “threat” for purposes of determining whether 

speech constitutes actionable contact, is a 
communication that instills in the addressee a fear 
of imminent and serious personal violence from the 
speaker, is unequivocal, and is objectively likely to 
be followed by unlawful acts.  T.B. v. Holm, 248 Or 
App 414 (2012) 

  A speech-based contact only counts if it constitutes 

a threat and a proscribable threat is a 
communication that instills in the addressee a fear 
of imminent and serious personal violence from the 
speaker, is unequivocal and is objectively likely to 
be followed by unlawful acts.  State v. Rangel, 328 
Or 294 (1999). 

  Taunting and inciting to fight through purely 

expressive conduct does not constitute a “threat.”  
Communication that is hyperbole, rhetorical excess, 
and impotent expressions of anger or frustration can 
sometimes be privileged even if it alarms the 
addressee.  State v. Jackson, 259 Or App 248 
(2013). 

  When based on an expressive contact, it must 

consist of a threat of imminent and serious physical 
violence that convincingly expresses to the 
addressee the intention that it will be carried out and 
that the actor has the ability to do so; it does not 
require establishment of “actual or substantive 
threat.”  State v. Shields, 184 Or App 505 (2002) 
rev denied 335 Or 355. 

  Stalking statute required proof that alarm and 

threatened act be intended by the speaker.  State v. 
Rangel (Court of Appeals), 146 Or App 571 (1997), 
affirmed 328 Or 294 (1999).

Or App 505 (2002). 

ee, e.g., C.J.R. v. Fleming, 265 Or App 342 (2014) 
(court found that throwing a toy at Petitioner and 
lunging at Petitioner during parenting time exchange 
were qualifying non-expressive contacts). But see, 
Wayt v. Goff, 153 Or App 347 (1999) (no finding 
contact was unwanted because Petitioner initiated the 
contact to provoke Respondent); Osborn v. Fadden, 
225 Or App 431 (2009) (child exchanges are 
considered voluntary contacts). 

Case Law – “Reasonable” 
The state must prove that the victim was in fact 
alarmed or coerced as a result of the repeated and 
unwanted contacts and that the victim’s apprehension 
about personal safety was objectively reasonable. State 
v. Shields, 184 Or App 505 (2002).  

he reasonable person standard should take into 
account the reality of the petitioner’s life, see, e.g., 
Bryant v. Walker, 190 Or App 253 (2003), affirmed 
337 Or 34 (2004) (“based on the realities of men’s and 
women’s lives, reasonable women are likely to 
experience fear in situations where reasonable men 
would not.”); T.B. v. Holm, 248 Or App 414 (2012) 
(trial court found it was reasonable for a person who 
wore a leg brace and walked with the assistance of a 
cane to be intimidated by a person riding a lawnmower 
beside them); D.W.C. v. Carter/Bosket, 261 Or App 
133 (2014) (consolidated with Christensen v. Bosket) 
(approaching with clenched fists and angrily yelling 
might not have met the objectively reasonable alarm 
requirement, but did when considered in context with 
Respondent’s use of homophobic slurs against the gay 
petitioner). 

ee, e.g., E.T. v. Belete, 266 Or App 650 (2014) 
(Petitioner was objectively alarmed where Respondent 
attempted to assault Petitioner and threw trash can 
yelling, and told Petitioner “you will depart this church 
either dead or alive”). 

But see, D.O. v. Richey, 301 Or App 18, 34 (2019)  
(Respondent’s filming Petitioner police chief without 
obstructing passage and screaming without threat of 
violence did not support objectively reasonable fear); 
see also, K.A.L. v. Hinkle, 288 Or App 341 (2017) 
(merely waiting outside home or leaving bottle of wine 
on doorstop are not objectively alarming); J.D.K. v. 
W.T.F., 276 Or App 533 (2016) (unwanted romantic 
overtures in the absence of inherently threatening 
contacts are not objectively alarming without

(2012) (not reasonable to be alarmed where 
Respondent repeatedly drove past Petitioner’s house 
and took photographs because parties had to 
communicate about parenting time and financial 
matters and there was no violence or abuse in the 
record). ORS 30.866(6) and ORS 163.730(7). Each 
contact must independently cause subjective and 
objective harm. K.M.V. v. Williams, 271 Or App 466 
(2015). 
 
Case Law – “Personal Safety” 
“Personal Safety” is the state of a particular individual 
being free from danger or harm. Delgado v. Souders, 
334 Or 122 (2002). 

elgado v. Souders, 334 Or 122, 151-52 (2002) (the 
term personal safety does not encompass apprehension 
of harm other than physical harm); Osborne v. Fadden, 
225 Or App 431 (2009) (applying less stringent 
standard for non-expressive contacts, Court of Appeals 
found that sending 2000 emails, harassing phone calls 
to family and friends, opening credit accounts, and 
signing up for subscriptions and mail order services 
would not cause Petitioners to have reasonable 
apprehension about their personal safety). 

easonable apprehension regarding personal safety 
must be pleaded and proved. See Cress v. Cress, 175 
Or App 599 (2001) and Lowrance v. Trow, 225 Or App 
250 (2009) (must actually have apprehension regarding 
personal safety).  

But see, e.g., Osborne v. Fadden, 225 Or App 431 
(2009); K.E.A. v. Halvorson, 267 Or App 374 (2014) 
(Petitioner’s apprehension regarding personal safety 
was not reasonable where Respondent drove and 
weaved through cul-de-sac, had car in neighbor’s 
driveway, and did not use threatening language); W.M. 
v. Muck, 267 Or App 368 (2014) (Petitioner’s 
reasonable apprehension for father’s safety not 
reasonable where Respondent said things like “the war 
was on” and “what goes around comes around”); 
Soderholm v. Krueger,  204 Or App 409 (2006) (being 
tearful or upset is insufficient proof of apprehension 
about personal safety).

unwanted contact with the other person or 
a member of that person’s immediate 
family or household thereby alarming or 
coercing the other person; 

b)  It is objectively reasonable for a person in 

the victim’s situation to have been

b)  A court’s stalking protective order if the 
court finds by a preponderance of the 
evidence that: 
i. 

The person intentionally, knowingly 
or recklessly engages in repeated and 
unwanted contact with the other 
person or a member of that person’s 
immediate family or household 
thereby alarming or coercing the 
other person; 
It is objectively reasonable for a 
person in the victim’s situation to 
have been alarmed or coerced by the 
contact; and 

iii.  The repeated and unwanted contact 
causes the victim reasonable 
apprehension regarding the personal 
safety of the victim or a member of

In the order, the court shall specify the 
conduct from which the respondent is to 
refrain, which may include all contact listed 
in ORS 163.730 and any attempt to make 
contact listed in ORS 163.730. The order is of 
unlimited duration unless limited by law.  

f the respondent was provided notice and an 
opportunity to be heard, the court shall also 
include in the order, when appropriate, terms 
and findings sufficient under 18 U.S.C. 922

the appearance of the respondent at court and 
shall enter a court’s stalking protective order. 

he circuit court may also order the 
respondent to undergo mental health 
evaluation and, if indicated by the evaluation, 
treatment. If the respondent is without 
sufficient resources to obtain the evaluation or 
treatment, or both, the court shall refer the 
respondent to the mental health agency 
designated by the community mental health 
director for evaluation or treatment, or both. 

f the circuit court, the mental health 
evaluator or any other persons have probable 
cause to believe that the respondent is 
dangerous to self or others or is unable to 
provide for basic personal needs, the court 
shall initiate commitment procedures as 
provided in ORS 426.070 or 426.180. 

 law enforcement officer shall report the 
results of any investigation arising from a 
complaint under ORS 163.744 to the district

under this section may not be used as 
evidence in a prosecution for stalking as 
defined in ORS 163.732 or for violating a 
court’s stalking protective order as defined in 
ORS 163.750. 

III. SERVICE OF STALKING

. RANGEL AND FIRST AMENDMENT 

PROTECTIONS IN STALKING 
Communicative Contacts and the Rangel 
Test 
In both the criminal and civil context, Oregon 
case law has established that expressive or 
communicative contacts must meet a more 
stringent standard than what is set out in the 
statute, because speech is protected under 
Article 1, Section 8, of the Oregon 
Constitution.  State v. Rangel, 328 Or 294 
(1999).   
The Rangel test requires proof that threats or 
contacts that involve expression:   

)  instill a fear of imminent and serious 

personal violence;  
b)  are unequivocal; and  
c)  are objectively likely to be followed by 

unlawful acts.   

n objective standard applies to the court’s 

determination of whether the respondent 
intended to carry out a threat.  See V.A.N. v. 
Parsons, 253 Or App 768 (2012). 

xpressive contacts may be considered 
contextually for purposes of determining 
whether other non-expressive contacts 
support issuance of an order. D.W.C. v. 
Carter/Bosket, 261 Or App 133 (2014); 
Castro v. Heinzman, 194 Or App 7 (2004).  
The court may consider “previous contacts as 
context about the parties’ relationship” in 
determining whether alarm and apprehension 
regarding personal safety are objectively 
reasonable. C.J.R. v. Fleming, 265 Or App 
342 (2014). 

xpressive or speech-based contacts must 
meet the higher standard even when the act of 
making the expressive contact—phone calls,

Note that in State v. Meek, 266 Or App 550 (2014), the 
court held that a letter is a “written communication” 
rather than an “object” for the purposes of a violation 
of a SPO and being held to the higher standard of ORS 
163.750(1)(c).  (see below)  
 

sending text messages, mailing letters or 
leaving notes for someone—are non-
expressive actions.  In K.A.L. v. Hinkle, 288 
Or App 341 (2017), the Court of Appeals 
considered the letters and notes that the 
respondent left on the petitioner’s doorstep to 
be expressive contacts and held them to the 
higher Rangel standard. In State v. Shields, 
184 Or App 505 (2002), the Court of Appeals 
held that telephone calls the respondent made 
without speaking are non-expressive contacts. 
Thus, it is the fact of communication, not the 
action taken in order convey the 
communication, which makes a particular 
contact expressive.   

 

iolation of Stalking Protective Order by 

 

Communicative Contact 
Violation of a court’s stalking protective 
order is a crime. ORS 163.750.  

lements: 

1.  Intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly 
engaging in conduct prohibited by the 
court's stalking protective order after 
service of the order; and 
2.  If the prohibited conduct is 

communicating or speaking with a 
protected person, even through a third 
party, or with a business entity, the 
conduct must have created reasonable 
apprehension regarding a protected 
person's personal safety.  ORS 163.750(1).  
State v. Meek, 266 Or App 550 (2014). 

hen relying on expressive contact 

violations, the state is not required to present 
evidence of  “an unequivocal threat of the sort 
that makes it objectively reasonable for the 
victim to believe that he or she is being 
threatened with imminent and serious 
physical harm,”  as required by State v. 
Rangel, 328 Or 294 (1999). Rather, the 
Rangel standard is only applicable at the time 

    V

  W

32 
 

the underlying stalking protective order is 
obtained.  State v. Ryan, 350 Or 670 (2011). 

 

   

 

33 
 

Note: A temporary stalking protective order issued ex 
parte on the filing of a civil petition will not satisfy this 
requirement.  Therefore, such an order will not subject 
the respondent to federal criminal liability for 
possession of firearms until and unless it is continued 
after a noticed hearing.  

emporary stalking orders issued under the police-
citation process and permanent stalking orders issued 
after a noticed hearing will satisfy the hearing 
requirement as long as the relationship requirements 
are met.   

   

In court stipulation to a SPO or request for a set-over is 
apparently enough to trigger this liability. U.S. v. 
Banks, 339 F3d 267 (5th Cir. 2003); U.S. v. Lippman 
369 F3d 1039 (8th Circ. 2004); U.S. v. Calor, 340 F3d 
428 (6th Cir. 2003).  However, a stipulation done out 
of court where no hearing was scheduled or occurred 
will likely not trigger this liability.  U.S. v. Spruill, 292 
F3d 207 (5th Cir. 2002). 

redible threat finding necessary 

For the federal (and Oregon) firearm prohibition to 
attach, the court must make additional findings 
required by firearms statutes that the respondent 
presents a credible threat to the petitioner. 

hen a SPO respondent is provided with notice and an 

opportunity to be heard ORS 30.866(10) and 
163.738(2)(b) require the court to “include in the order, 
when appropriate, terms and findings sufficient under 
18 U.S.C. 922 (d)(8) and (g)(8) to affect the 
respondent’s ability to possess firearms and 
ammunition or engage in activities involving firearms.”

I. FEDERAL LAW: Firearm and 
Ammunition Prohibition While Subject to 
a Stalking Protective Order 

 Stalking Protective Order issued under Oregon 
law may invoke the federal firearm prohibitions. 
 
18 U.S.C. 922(g)(8) 

he federal prohibition on possession of 
firearms or ammunition applies to a person 
subject to a court order where the following 
are true: 
 

a)  Order was issued after a hearing where 
the respondent had actual notice and 
opportunity to participate; 
 

b)  Order restrains the respondent from 
harassing, stalking, or threatening an 
intimate partner of such person or child 
of such intimate partner or person, or 
engaging in other conduct that would 
place an intimate partner in reasonable 
fear of bodily injury to the partner or 
child; and 

c)  Either:  

  A

i. 

ii. 

includes a finding that the person 
represents a credible threat to the 
physical safety of such intimate 
partner or child; or 
by its terms explicitly prohibits the 
use, attempted use, or threatened use 
of physical force against such 
intimate partner or child that would 
reasonably be expected to cause 
physical injury 

 

34 
 

Note: Under Oregon law, a credible threat finding is 
not required in order for the court to issue a 
stalking protective order.   

f the order explicitly prohibits the use, attempted use, 
or threatened use of physical force against the   
petitioner or child that would reasonably be expected to 
cause physical injury, but does not include a credible 
threat finding, the federal firearm prohibition may 
attach, but the state prohibition will still not attach.

talking Protective Orders issued under Oregon law do 

not require that there be a defined relationship that 
exists between the petitioner and the respondent.   

owever, in order for the federal firearm prohibition to 
attach, the order must specifically state the relationship 
between the parties as one of the eligible relationships 
defined as “intimate partner” under 18 U.S.C. 
921(a)(32) 
 
For example, respondents in the military service, or 
employed as police officers, may use their service 
weapons in the course of their employment despite the 
existence of a restraining order. The exemption, 
however, does not extend to their personal use of 
firearms.

law for prohibitions under ORS 166.255 (see below).

18 U.S.C. 921(a)(32) 

Intimate Partner”: means with respect to a 
person, the spouse of the person, a former 
spouse of the person, an individual who is a 
parent of a child of the person, and an 
individual who cohabitates or has cohabited 
with the person. 
 

FEDERAL LAW: Official Use Exception 

8 U.S.C. 925(a)(1) 

lthough the receipt and possession of 

firearms and ammunition by persons subject 
to restraining orders that meet the above 
requirements, federal law does not prohibit a 
law enforcement officer subject to a 
restraining order from receiving or possessing 
firearms or ammunition for use in performing 
official duties. Possession of the firearm for 
official purposes while off duty would be 
lawful if such possession is required or 
authorized by law or by official departmental 
policy. An officer subject to a disabling 
restraining order would violate the law if the 
officer received or possessed a firearm or 
ammunition for other than official use.

pportunity to be heard 

ote: Unlike the federal firearms prohibitions, no 
hearing is required for state firearms prohibitions to 
apply.  The mere opportunity to request a hearing is 
sufficient.  ORS 166.255(1)(a)(A)(ii) 

emporary stalking orders issued under the police-
citation process and permanent stalking orders issued 
after a noticed hearing will satisfy the hearing 
requirement as long as the relationship requirements 
are met.   
 

In court stipulation to a SPO or request for a set-over is 
apparently enough to trigger this liability. U.S. v. 
Banks, 339 F3d 267 (5th Cir. 2003); U.S. v. Lippman, 
369 F3d 1039 (8th Circ. 2004); U.S. v. Calor, 340 F3d 
428 (6th Cir. 2003).  However, a stipulation done out 
of court where no hearing was scheduled or occurred 
will likely not trigger this liability.  U.S. v. Spruill, 292 
F3d 207 (5th Cir. 2002).

ammunition is not criminalized under ORS 166.250,

subject to a stalking protective order, the 
order must: 
a)  Restrain the respondent from stalking the 
petitioner or engaging in other conduct 
that would place the petitioner in 
reasonable fear of bodily injury’.   
b)  Protect an “intimate partner” of the 
respondent [as defined by 18 U.S.C. 
921(a)(32)], or a child of the “intimate 
partner”  or of the respondent.  Thus, the 
order must protect persons with the 
following relationships with the 
respondent for the respondent to be 
criminally liable:  

Spouse or former spouse  

i. 
ii.  Other parent of respondent’s child

Opportunity to be heard” (#4)-  

  Note: A temporary stalking protective order issued 
ex parte on the filing of a civil petition will not 
satisfy this requirement.  Therefore, such an order 
will not subject the respondent to federal criminal 
liability for possession of firearms until and unless 
it is continued after a noticed hearing.  

  Temporary stalking orders issued under the police-
citation process and permanent stalking orders 
issued after a noticed hearing will satisfy the 
hearing requirement as long as the relationship 
requirements are met.   

n court stipulation to a SPO or request for a set-
over is apparently enough to trigger this liability. 
U.S. v. Banks, 339 F3d 267 (5th Cir. 2003); U.S. v. 
Lippman, 369 F3d 1039 (8th Circ. 2004); U.S. v. 
Calor, 340 F3d 428 (6th Cir. 2003).  However, a 
stipulation done out of court where no hearing was 
scheduled or occurred will likely not trigger this 
liability.  U.S. v. Spruill, 292 F3d 207 (5th Cir.

the respondent’s ability to possess firearms and

Such finding includes the credible threat finding.  

tate criminal firearms liability will apply even if no 
hearing occurs or if a noticed hearing occurred, but the 
respondent did not make the request for the hearing or 
did not attend:  Actual notice of the hearing and 
opportunity to participate is enough. ORS 
166.255(1)(A)(i).  Since an SPO respondent is served 
with notice of a court hearing on an ex parte stalking 
order or as a follow-up to an officer’s citation, all post-
ex parte SPOs should impose state criminal liability for 
firearms if they cover a qualified relationship (see 
above) and contain the required findings on 
relationship (see above).  Even an SPO termination 
hearing, in which situation the respondent does request 
a hearing, should impose liability as a noticed hearing, 
even if the respondent fails to appear or withdraws the 
request.  ORS 166.255(1)(a)(A)(ii).

State Prohibitions Against Purchase or 
Possession of Firearms or Ammunition in 
Stalking Protection Orders 
 
A respondent subject to a stalking protective 
order faces potential state criminal liability 
for purchasing or possessing firearms or 
ammunition while the order is in effect if:  
a)  The protected person is the ‘family or 

household member’ of the respondent:  
current or former spouse, other parent of a 
joint child, current or former cohabitant 
(with sexual intimacy), current or past 
sexually intimate partner, and adult related 
to the respondent by blood or marriage;  
b)  The order includes a specific finding that 
the respondent represents a credible threat 
to the physical safety of the petitioner or 
the petitioner’s child.  ORS 
166.255(1)(C); 

c)  The order must restrain the respondent 
from stalking conduct against certain 
protected persons (outlined above). 

ote: unlike the federal firearms prohibitions, 

no hearing is required for state firearms 
prohibitions to apply.  The mere opportunity 
to request a hearing is sufficient.  ORS

Beginning in 2020, SPO respondents subject 
to the firearms prohibitions discussed above 
are required to follow a detailed firearms 
surrender protocol. Chapter 201 Oregon Laws 
2019, Enrolled House Bill 2013 (“HB 2013”). 

 

 

ithin 24 hours of being prohibited from 

possessing firearms and ammunition, 
respondents must do one of the following: 
a)  Surrender to a law enforcement agency or 
a licensed gun dealer all firearms and/or 
ammunition in their possession, control or 
custody; or  

b)  Have an eligible third party (who does not 

reside with the respondent) take 
possession of any firearms and/or 
ammunition in the respondent’s 
possession, control or custody.   

f the respondent chooses to surrender 
firearms/ammunition to a third party, the 
respondent must arrange for an Oregon state 
police criminal background check on the third 
party.  A fee is charged for such a background 
check.  To be eligible to receive the 
firearms/ammunition, the third party cannot 
live with the respondent and must complete 
the Third Party Recipient’s Declaration and 
provide it to the respondent for filing, as 
discussed below.  

ithin two judicial (business) days of being 

prohibited from possessing firearms and 
ammunition, the respondent must file with the 
court and the district attorney’s office a 
declaration attesting that: 
a)   All firearms or ammunition in the 
respondent’s possession have been

c)  The respondent is asserting the 
constitutional right against self- 
incrimination. 

f the respondent transfers all 
firearms/ammunition to law enforcement, a 
gun dealer, or an eligible third party, the 
respondent must also file with their 
declaration a copy of the proof of transfer and 
a copy of the third-party declaration, if 
applicable.

fficial Use Exemption 

 

The state firearm prohibition in qualifying 
stalking order cases does not apply to the 
official use of firearms by certain government 
employees. ORS 166.255(2). For example, 
respondents in the military service, or 
employed as police officers, may use their 
service weapons in the course of their 
employment despite the existence of a 
restraining order. The exemption, however, 
does not extend to their personal use of 
firearms.  

he firearms ban that results from Oregon 
stalking convictions applies to all use of 
firearms.  No official use exemption applies 
allowing for the use of government 
employees in the course of their employment, 
as exists for prohibitions based on a 
qualifying restraining order ORS 166.255(2).

FEDERAL LAW Subject to Protective 
Order / Official Use Exception 
18 USC 925(a)(1) 

lthough the receipt and possession of 

firearms and ammunition by persons subject 
to restraining orders that meet the above 
requirements, federal law does not prohibit a 
law enforcement officer subject to a 
restraining order from receiving or possessing 
firearms or ammunition for use in performing 
official duties. Possession of the firearm for 
official purposes while off duty would be 
lawful if such possession is required or 
authorized by law or by official departmental 
policy. An officer subject to a disabling 
restraining order would violate the law if the 
officer received or possessed a firearm or 
ammunition for other than official use.

eturn of Firearms/Ammunition - SPO 
The prohibition on firearms/ammunition lasts 
until the restraining order expires or is 
terminated by the court.  Once the prohibition 
ends, a background check must be done on 
the respondent to confirm that the respondent 
is otherwise eligible to receive the 
firearms/ammunition. The law enforcement 
agency, gun dealer, or eligible third party 
holding the firearms/ammunition for the 
respondent may not return the firearms until 
such a background check is performed.  
Section 4(7) and Section 5, Chapter 201 
Oregon Laws 2019, Enrolled House Bill 2013 
(“HB 2013”).   

n addition, if the respondent transferred the 
firearms/ammunition to a law enforcement 
agency, that agency must notify the Oregon 
Department of Justice of the return request for 
the purposes of notifying the petitioner, and 
hold the firearms/ammunition for 72 hours 
after receiving the return request. Section 5, 
HB 2013. 
Return of Firearms/Ammunition- Stalking
