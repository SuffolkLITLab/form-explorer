      <pre>HOW TO SERVE  
(DELIVER) 
LEGAL PAPERS 
IN OREGON 

 

he person who files a legal matter must make sure that notice of the case is “served” (or delivered 

to) the other side. “Service” is how the other side knows: 
•  What the filing party is asking the Court to order 
•  What the served party must do, and by when, if the served party disagrees with what is 

being requested.  See Question #1. 

ervice must be done in the way that the law sets out.  The law covers how and when service can 

be done, by whom, and how “proof” of service is filed with the Court afterward.   Without proper 
notice of a lawsuit, a case usually cannot proceed.  The case could even be dismissed. 

These instructions tell you how to serve legal papers in Oregon.  They cover: 

•  Who can serve legal papers 
•  How legal papers are served 
•  What must be done after the papers are served 
•  Where to ask for help if you have questions about serving papers 

“Legal papers” in this booklet means the paperwork that STARTS A LAWSUIT  (and in family law 
matters, a modification proceeding).  Oregon Rule of Civil Procedure 7 sets out what the law 
requires.    

Once a lawsuit is already underway, different (and less formal) rules apply to delivery of most 
documents.  Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure 9 covers those situations.  These instructions do not 
apply then.

What does “service” of legal papers mean? 

“Service” of legal papers means delivery of legal papers in a way that the law accepts.  Lawsuits 
have important consequences, so the party being sued must be notified of the lawsuit and have 
information about how and when to object. The person serving the papers must file a document with 
the court stating how, when, and where the service happened and what papers were delivered to the  
party who was served.  This document is called a “Proof of Service.” It tells the court that the other 
party did receive notice and could have objected, if the served party does not file an answer or 
objection by the deadline.  

The rules for service can be technical.  It is important to do the service process correctly or your 
case might be postponed or even dismissed.  Follow instructions and get help if you have questions.   
See page 10 for getting help on answering questions about service.   

Can the person filing the lawsuit serve the other party?   

No. The person serving the papers cannot be connected the lawsuit.   But the person 
filing the lawsuit can prepare the papers for someone else (the server)  to deliver.  See 
Question #4.  

Who can serve legal papers? 

      Anyone who is: 

 

•  At least 18 years old, 
•  Lives in the state where the papers will be delivered, and 
• 
Is not a party to the lawsuit (or a party’s attorney or 
employee)  

can serve the legal papers.

A deputy sheriff in the county where the other party can be located will serve the papers for a fee.  
The Court may waive or defer (postpone) this fee if the service will be done in Oregon. You can also 
pay a “process server,” who is someone who works for a private company that delivers papers as a 
business.  The Court cannot waive or defer a fee charged by a private company.  If the situation is 
safe, you may have a friend or someone else serve the papers for you at no cost, but only if this 
person meets the qualifications listed above. 

4. 

How do I know what papers have to be served on the other party? 

The party who filed the lawsuit should prepare the documents for the server. 
Often, there is a “Summons” that must be served.   See #6, “What is a 
Summons?   To start a lawsuit, there should also be a “Complaint.” (In family 
law matters, the Complaint is called a “Petition”).  The original 
Complaint/Petition is filed with the Court.  The served party gets a true 
(accurate) copy.  The Complaint (or Petition) tells the served party what the 
filing party wants.  It could be a Complaint about money owed, and therefore 
a money judgment is asked for, or it could be a Petition for Dissolution 

(Divorce) or Child Custody, or something else.   

There are many types of lawsuits.  There may also be other legal documents such as “motions,” 
“affidavits,”  “declarations,”  “notices,” “temporary orders,” or “Orders to Show Cause” to be served.  
Check at your local court to make sure you have the documents required to be served on the other 
party for your type of case.   

Can I serve the other party first, and then file my lawsuit? 

1,2,3 . . . 

No.  The Complaint or Petition must be filed before the other party can be served.  Do not send 
papers out to be served until the original documents have been filed with the Court.  

What is a “Summons?”  

SUMMONS 

A Summons is the document that tells the other party that a lawsuit has been 
filed.  It states what county the suit is pending in, how long the served party 
has to respond, how to respond, and what the deadline for responding is. 
The deadline is usually 30 days.  A Summons also states the phone 
number and web address for the Oregon State Bar Lawyer Referral 
Service.  These resources are a place to start looking for legal help if the 
party who is served does not have an attorney or know how to get legal 

advice. 

In family law cases, there may not be a Summons if the legal case is a 

modification of a judgment.  If the person filing is asking to change a 
judgment that was already entered in a court, there will likely be only a Motion, a Declaration or 
Affidavit, and an Order to Show Cause (OSC). But the Order to Show Cause should tell the served 
party that he or she has 30 days to file a Response, or state a date and time to appear in court.

7. 

Who are the Petitioner and the Respondent (or the Plaintiff and the Defendant)? 

The parties in each lawsuit have a role or title.  The person (or company) that files the lawsuit is 
called the “Plaintiff” or “Petitioner.” The person (or company) that is being sued is called the 
“Defendant” or “Respondent.”  

The parties keep their original titles throughout the case.  For example, in a family law case, 
modification motions and other matters are often filed after the Judgment to deal with the changed 
circumstances of the children or the parties.  Even if the requesting party at this later point is the 
Defendant/Respondent, he or she will keep that same title instead of becoming the 
“Plaintiff/Petitioner.”  

How is the other party served?  

The law recognizes several ways to serve the other party.  These are discussed 
below, in questions # 9 –19.*  It is important to follow the rules about service 
carefully or delivery of the paperwork may have to be re-done.  Re-doing service 
could delay finalizing the lawsuit because it means a new 30-day period to wait for 
an answer (or response) has to occur.  See #6 above.   In some situations, improper 
service could mean your case is dismissed and you would have to re-file and start 
over. 

* These rules may not be effective for service outside the United States.  See Question #20.  

Can’t the other party just “accept” service? 

Yes.  If the other party is willing to accept service, the filing party may simply mail or hand-deliver a 
copy of the Summons, petition/complaint, and other documents to the Defendant / Respondent, 
along with a form called an “Acceptance of Service.”   In family law matters, the Acceptance of 
Service form is available on the Oregon Judicial Department website.  (Each family law packet has 
an “Acceptance” form for use with that packet).See web addresses at the end of this document.  

An “Acceptance of Service” signed by the Respondent (or Defendant) does not show that the 
Respondent agrees with what was requested in the legal papers.  Signing the Acceptance of Service 
means only that the party receiving the legal papers agrees he or she has received them.  Not all 
Defendants/Respondents are willing to accept service voluntarily.  Often, only individuals who want 
something similar to what the filing party wants (such as a divorce) will agree to “accept service.”  

The Respondent/Defendant who is willing to accept service must fill out the Acceptance of Service 
form and sign it.  Sometimes the form requires notarization (signing it in 
front of a notary public) or a declaration under penalty of perjury that the 
person signing is actually the Respondent/Defendant.  The Respondent / 
Defendant can then either file the Acceptance of Service form with the 
court, or return it to the Petitioner/Plaintiff for filing. Either way, the Acceptance of Service must be 
filed with the court to show that the other side has notice of the lawsuit.

10.  What if the Respondent won’t accept service? 

If the respondent won’t accept service, another method of service must be used. No matter which 
method you use, proof of service must be filed with the court.  

1. 

How is Personal Service done?    

Personal service means that the person doing the service hands the 
papers to the respondent, face to face.  This is the preferred method 

for serving an individual.  The serving party will need to note the date, 
time, and place of service so he or she can fill out this information on the 
“proof of service.”  The server also needs to know that the person he or 
she served is the party named in the lawsuit. 

As long as the server personally handed the legal papers to the Defendant / 

Respondent, service is complete even if the served party then dropped them, ripped them up, 
refused to take them, or threw them back at the server.  Service is complete as long as the served 
party knew he or she was being handed legal papers. It may be best for the server to say “These are 
legal papers I am handing to you” so that there is no doubt about what happened.   

Personal service can occur at any place, at any time, that both the server and the served party are 
present.  

3)  mails another copy of the Summons and other legal papers to the Defendant/ Respondent at 

his or her home address by regular first class mail.  This mailing must include a written 
statement that tells the served party when and with whom the server left the documents that 
were personally delivered. 

Service done by “Substitute Service” is not legally complete until proof is filed with the court stating 
that the in-person  delivery to someone at the home and the mailed notice were both done.  The 
served party’s response time starts to run the day after the mailing is done.   

IMPORTANT NOTE:  If the sheriff’s office did service for you, you will likely receive a copy of their 
Proof of Service in the mail.  Read that document carefully.  If the deputy states that he or she 
handed the papers to someone living in the household (and didn’t give the papers directly the other 

)  personally hands the Summons, Petition, and other documents to 
someone who (1)  lives in the Defendant/Respondent’s home and  
(2) is at least 14 years old and,

Substitute service means that the person doing the service:  

1)  goes to the Defendant’s/Respondent’s current home,

party), the sheriff’s office has done only steps 1 and 2 above.  You must make sure step 3 is done 
by having a friend or someone you know do the mailing, and then have this person sign a document 
saying when the mailing was done.  Proof of this mailing must also be filed with the court. 

Forms for all parts of Substitute Service in family law matters are available online at the court’s 
website.  See Resources on page 10.  

13.  What is Office Service? 

The server can use this method only if the Defendant/Respondent is the 
one maintaining the office to conduct business.   Although the law is not 
clear on this point, it is likely that the served party must be the employer.  If 
the Defendant/Respondent is only an employee, office service cannot be 
used.  In office service, the person serving the papers:  

1)  goes to the office, 
2)  hands the papers to a person who appears to be in charge of 

the office, and 

3)  mails a copy of the papers to the Defendant/Respondent’s home address by regular 
first class mail.  The server must include in this mailing a written statement telling the 
served party when and with whom the server left the documents that were personally 
delivered to the office. 

When service is done by “Office Service,” the notice is not legally complete until proof is filed that the 
delivery and the mailing were both done.  The served party’s response time starts to run the day 
after the mailing is done. 

MPORTANT NOTE:  If the sheriff’s office did service for you, you will likely receive a copy of their 
Proof of Service in the mail.  Read that document carefully.  If the deputy states that he or she 
handed the papers to someone working in the office (and didn’t give the papers directly the other 
party), the sheriff’s office has done only steps 1 and 2 above.  You must make sure step 3 is done 
by having a friend or someone you know do the mailing and then have that person sign a document 
saying when the mailing was done.  Proof of this mailing must also be filed with the court.  

4. 

How is Service by Mail done?  

To serve the respondent by mail, the person serving the papers must  

•  mail the Summons, complaint/petition, and other documents to the 

Defendant’s/Respondent’s home or mailing address by certified mail, 
registered mail, or express mail with a return receipt requested and 
•  mail an additional copy of the papers to the Defendant’s/Respondent’s 

home address by regular first- class mail.

Service by mail of a Summons and Complaint/Petition (or a modification matter in a family law case) 
is not effective unless the served party signs the receipt.  If anyone else signs (such as the 
Defendant’s/Respondent’s roommate or spouse or relative), service has not been completed. The 
green receipt card containing the signature of the Defendant / Respondent must be filed with the 
court, along with  proof of service that the first-class mailing was done.   

The response time for a party served by mail starts running from which happens first: 

• 
• 
• 

the date after the return receipt was signed 
the fourth day after the mailing to an Oregon address 
the eighth day after mailing to an address outside of Oregon 

 filing party can sometimes serve by mail legal documents other than those that start the lawsuit.  
In this situation, first-class mail without a return receipt is allowed. But the mailing party must still file 
proof that he or she mailed the documents to the other party.  Knowing which documents start a law 
suit and which ones do not can be complicated.  Furthermore, certain matters (such as contempt)  
require personal service  even if a lawsuit is already pending between the parties. See #11 above.  It 
is best to get legal help about serving legal papers by mail.  Resources are listed at the end of this 
document.  

15.   Can’t I just serve the other side by eMail or Facebook? 

No.  The law recognizes only certain ways to give notice.  Even if you feel the best 
way to make sure the other side knows about the lawsuit is to let him know through 
email or Facebook, you need court approval first for “Alternative Service” for this 
method to be effective under the law.  See #16. 

  must provide a sworn statement (or declaration under penalty of perjury) explaining why the 
papers setting out  how you have tried every other method of service but cannot get the 
papers served.  This statement must set out why those methods weren’t successful, and list 
whom you contacted to try to locate the Defendant/Respondent (family members, former 
roommates, employers, or co-workers) and what their responses were about the 

  •

If the Defendant/Respondent won’t accept service and none of the four ways 
described in #11-14 above have worked or can work, you may still be able to 
serve the papers by using ”Alternative Service.”  To proceed this way, you must 
have the permission of a Judge in advance.  The Court will need to decide what 
methods are the means (or combination of means) most likely to assure that the 
Defendant/Respondent receives actual notice of the lawsuit.  To get a court order approving 
Alternative Service, the filing party: 

•  must file a Motion for an Order Allowing Alternative Service and 

6.  What is Alternative Service?

Defendant/Respondent’s whereabouts.  Be sure your sworn statement is filled out completely 
and 
 

•  must prepare a proposed Order for the Judge to sign. 

•  may also have to appear before a Judge to answer questions under oath about  the efforts to 

find and serve the other party. 
 

As Alternative Service, the Court may allow you to “post” a notice on a bulletin board in a courthouse 
or another public place or to publish a notice in a newspaper.  The Court might also require you to 
mail notices to family members, or to take a combination of steps, such as email, that appear likely 
to result in the Defendant/Respondent receiving notice of the lawsuit.  

or family law cases, court forms are available on the court’s website to ask for an Order Allowing 

Alternative Service.  See the Resources on page 10. 
 

17. 

What is Service by Posting?  

 

 
 

Service by “posting” is a step approved by the Court that allows notice of the 
lawsuit to be posted on a bulletin board that contains public notices.  Usually the 
Summons is posted but sometimes the Complaint/Petition may be posted as well. 
(Read what your order requires).  The posting is usually ordered done in a 
courthouse in the county where you believe the Defendant/Respondent lives.  
The Court could instead (or in addition) order that you post the Summons and/or 
other legal documents in a public place where the Defendant/Respondent 

frequently goes, such as a particular treatment provider’s office or even a gym.   

Usually, no fee is charged for posting. Remember, though, that you need a court order allowing this 
method before posting. The Judge will decide the time period that the notice has to remain on the 
bulletin board.  And the party who posted the notice will need to sign and file a form with the court 
setting out when he or she posted the notice and removed it. The person who posts the Summons 
cannot be the party who filed the lawsuit.  

For family law cases, court forms are available on the court’s website to ask for an Order Allowing 
Alternative Service.  See the Resources on page 10.   

8.  

 What is Service by Publication?  

Another method of Alternative Service is called service by publication. This 
method of service involves publishing a Summons in a generally-read 
newspaper in the county where the case is pending and/or in the locality where the 
Defendant/Respondent lives. The Judge will specify what newspaper should be used. Newspapers 
charge a fee for publishing this notice. To serve by publication, you need court approval first.  See # 
16 above.  If the Court allows this method, you will need to make your own arrangements with the 

8 

  F

  1

 

newspaper to publish the Summons. Usually, the Summons is published once a week for four 
weeks.  

When the publishing period is over, you will need to obtain an affidavit (sworn statement) from the 
newspaper staff person swearing that the Summons was published and for how long (on which 
dates).  Many newspapers have forms they prepare themselves for this purpose.  No matter who 
prepares the affidavit, it is the filing party’s responsibility to make sure this proof of service is filed 
with the court. 

For family law cases, court forms are available on the court’s website to ask for an Order Allowing 
Alternative Service.  See the Resources at the end of this booklet  

9.  What if the Defendant/Respondent is in jail or prison?    

If the Defendant/Respondent in your case is in custody, the only methods of 
service likely to work are having a deputy sheriff or prison/jail employee serve 
the papers. You can contact the particular correctional facility to find out what 
the practice is there and what fee, if any applies.  If service will be done by an 
Oregon deputy sheriff, your fee waiver or deferral from an Oregon judge should cover this step. 
Check with the facility to see if there is a charge if a correctional officer serves the papers. 

If you are serving a Defendant/Respondent who is in jail or prison outside of Oregon or in a federal 
or tribal facility, you will need to contact the jail administration office or the sheriff in the county where 
the facility is located for information on how service can be done.    

As in any situation, you will need to make sure that the person or deputy doing the service prepares 
a “proof of service” document setting out the details about service.  Deputies often have their own 
form and may sometimes mail it to the court without notice to you. You may need to check court 
records, or back with the deputy, to find out if service was done and if proof of service was filed.  

0.  What if the Defendant/Respondent lives in another country?   

Even if the Respondent is willing to accept service (see #9, above), this is a situation 
in which you will need to get an attorney’s advice.   Depending on the country, there 
could be extra or different steps required for service.  It is best to get an attorney’s 
help with this.  

1.   

 What if the Defendant/Respondent is in the military? 

The ways to serve the Respondent are the same but (1) it may be difficult to locate 
the Respondent and (2) the Respondent is entitled to delay the case if he or she is 
on active duty or training or about to be deployed. This is another situation in which 
advice from an attorney is best.

How do I prove that the Defendant/Respondent has been served?  

Deputy Sheriffs and private process servers often file the proof of service directly with the 
court.  If a friend or family member did the service, the server will need to fill out a proof 
of service form.  Either the server or the filing party can then file the proof of service 

with the court. The original summons must be attached.  For most family law cases, 
proof of service forms are available from the court website.  See Resources at the 

end of this booklet.     

   If you serve by publication, you have to prove that the newspaper actually published the 

Summons.  Newspapers will usually give you an affidavit that says when they published the 
Summons, so you can file that with the court.   

Is there a deadline for filing the Proof of Service with the court?  

You should make sure the Proof of Service is filed as soon as possible.  In some 
courts, if the Proof of Service has not been within 63 days after the lawsuit was 
filed, the court will send a notice to the filing party stating that the case will be 
dismissed if the Proof of Service is not filed within the next 28 days.    

2.  What if I have questions about serving legal papers?  

It is very common for people to have questions about the legal system.  If you need 
help with something or don’t understand something, you can ask a clerk or facilitator at 
the courthouse, your county law librarian, or an attorney. Remember that only an 
attorney can give you legal advice. Some resources are set out below. 

ERMS USED IN THIS BOOKLET 

Defendant – the person who is sued in a non-family law case.  In family law, this person is called 
the “Respondent.” 

Petitioner –   the person who starts a lawsuit in a family law matter by filing a petition.  He or she is 
“petitioning” or asking the Court to order certain things.  In civil law (most non-criminal cases other 
than family and probate matters), the person who starts the lawsuit is called the “Plaintiff.”   After a 
General Judgment (final decision) has been reached in the original lawsuit, the Petitioner keeps 
his/her title for modification proceedings or any other legal matters. 

Plaintiff –  the person (or company) that starts a lawsuit in a non-family law case.  In family law, this 
person is called the “Petitioner.”

Respondent – the person who is sued in a family law case.  He or she is “responding” or answering 
to what the Petitioner has asked from the Court.  After a General Judgment (final decision) has been 
reached in the original lawsuit, the Respondent keeps his/her title for modification proceedings or 
any other legal matters, even if the Respondent is the one making the request to the Court. 

Service – the delivery of legal papers in a way that the law accepts. 

Summons –  the document that tells the served party that a lawsuit has been filed, how long the 
served party has to respond (usually 30 days), and that the filing party will ask for the relief in the 
legal papers if no objection or answer is filed by the deadline.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
