MEDIUM/LONG DISTANCE PARENTING PLAN INSTRUCTIONS/WORKSHEET 

Notice about these instructions: 

These instructions are not a complete statement of the law and are not a substitute for the advice of an attorney. These 
instructions cover basic procedure for parenting plans in uncomplicated divorce or unmarried parent custody cases. If 
you have further questions about parenting plans, see the section “What is a Parenting Plan and How Do I Use This 
Guide?” in the Basic Parenting Plan Guide. 

These instructions are provided in a “worksheet” format so that as you go through the instructions for the 
various sections of the parenting plan, you will be able to fill in information that can then be transferred to 
the final form. 

For more information, including resource and referral information, consult the Basic Parenting Plan Guide for Parents 
and the Safety Focused Parenting Plan Guide. Both of these guides have information about how to select a parenting 
plan that is best for you and your children, and give examples of parenting plans that you may wish to use. The guides 
also include information about where to get basic legal information and how to find an attorney, and each guide 
contains a separate resource list of books, videos, websites and services for children and adults going through divorce 
or custody proceedings. 

This Long Distance Parenting Plan form is suggested when parents live more than sixty miles apart. Otherwise, use the 
Basic Parenting Plan form. 

BEGIN: 
If you will be filling in the form by hand, before you fill in any part of the Long Distance Parenting Plan, you should make a 
copy of the blank form. Save this copy for use when you are ready to fill out a final version of the Long Distance Parenting 
Plan to file with the Court.

Exhibit 1 

IMPORTANT  NOTICE:  The  provisions  of  your  Parenting  Plan  may  have  important  legal 
consequences. You should consult the complete BASIC PARENTING PLAN GUIDE FOR PARENTS 
available at http://courts.oregon.gov/familylaw  before filling out this form.  Your decisions about  how 
much  time  the  children  will  spend  in  the  care  of  each  parent  may  have  important  financial 
implications. This decision may affect how much child support a parent is responsible for, whether 
a  parent  can  claim  a  tax  dependency  deduction,  etc.  You  should  consult  an  attorney  or  your 
caseworker before filing your Parenting Plan. 

1.  GOALS FOR OUR CHILDREN 

This  plan  is  intended  to  ensure  the  children’s  optimal  development  by  providing  continuity,  stability  and 
predictability for the children, while ensuring frequent and continued contact with each parent. Because a 
written plan cannot address every possible situation that might occur, the parents will implement this plan in a 
spirit of good faith and mutual cooperation.  Parents are encouraged to re-evaluate this plan from time to time 
as their children’s needs change. 

2.  WHO OUR CHILDREN ARE (     additional names are listed on an attached page) 

Write down the full legal name (do not use nickname), date of birth, age, and sex (male or female) of each child of 
this relationship. If you have more than four children, check the box above and write their information on a 
separate page. Write “Paragraph 2, Continued” at the top of the separate page, and attach it to your Parenting Plan 
form.

3.  WHO WE ARE 

The parents acknowledge that they remain the children’s parents at all times.  Each parent is responsible 
for providing the children with a quality experience and for acting in the children’s best interests. 

For the purposes of describing the parenting time schedule, “Parent A” is the parent who the children stay 
with more than half the time, and “Parent B” is the parent who the children stay with less than half the time. 
If the parenting time is exactly even, it does not matter who is assigned which letter.  In this document: 

Parent A is (name) 

Parent B is (name)   

 

3.1 Primary Residence. (CHECK ONE) 

Parent A’s home shall be considered the “primary residence”. 

Neither parent’s home shall be considered the “primary residence”. 

3.2  Temporary Changes to Parenting Time.  Temporary changes to the parenting time schedule may be 
made at any time so long as both parents agree ahead of time. (CHECK ONE) 

The parents may agree verbally to any temporary changes in the parenting time schedule; however, 

changes shall be put in writing at the request of either parent. 

Temporary changes to the parenting time schedule must be agreed upon in writing.

4.  WHAT THE SCHEDULE WILL BE (CHECK ONE- AN ATTACHMENT IS REQUIRED) 

Parenting Time  Schedule:  Explain when your children will be in the care of each parent. You can use the 
blank calendar in the Basic Parenting Plan Guide (BPPG) to help you work out your schedule. For questions and 
tips that may help you decide on a parenting time schedule, see the section “Where Do I Start?”  in the BPPG. 
For information about the needs of different-aged children, see the age-specific sections of “What’s Best for My  
Child?” in the BPPG.  For books or other resources about creating a parenting time schedule, see “Where Can I 
Learn More?” in the BPPG. 

The example schedules in Attachments 4A and 4B are there for guidance.  Your situation is unique, and you can 
set whatever schedule will work for your family.  It is more important to think about how often and how easily 
parents and children can manage to travel and less important what the exact distance is between parents’ homes. 

Attachment 4A, the “Medium Distance” schedule is completed and attached (suggested for parents 
who live at least 60 and not more than 180 miles apart from each other). 

Attachment 4B, the “Long Distance” schedule is completed and attached (suggested for parents who live 
180 miles or more apart from each other). 

Because frequent trips over a long distance are difficult for a child, summer vacation and school holidays may 
offer the best opportunity for scheduling parenting time when parents live a long distance apart. 

5.  HOW WE WILL EXCHANGE OUR CHILDREN 

5.1  Transportation. 

The parents shall equally share the transportation of the children by: (CHECK ONE) 

exchanging the children at a midway point between Parent A’s and Parent B’s home. 

taking turns (one parent transports at the beginning and the other transports at the end, 
or one parent transports for one trip and the other transports for the next) 

Other transportation arrangements:   

 

5.2  Clothing & Medication. The parents shall have the children ready with the clothing they need and any 
necessary medications at the scheduled time of exchange. All clothing and medications that accompanied 
the children shall be returned with them to the other parent. 

6.  HOW WE WILL MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT OUR CHILDREN 

IMPORTANT NOTICE: Your decision to select Joint or Sole Custody may have important legal 
consequences. You are strongly encouraged to consult with an attorney regarding these 
consequences before making your final decision about Joint or Sole Custody. 

6.1  Day-to-Day Decisions. Each parent will make day-to-day decisions regarding the care and control of 
our  children  during  the  time  they  are  caring  for  our  children.  This  includes  any  emergency  decisions 
affecting the health or safety of our children. 

6.2  Major Decisions (Legal Custody)  Major decisions include, but are not limited to, decisions about 
the children’s residence, education, non-emergency health care, and religious training.  (CHECK ONE)

Exhibit 1 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

  

 

 

 

Choose an arrangement for making “major decisions” including decisions about the children’s education, 
non-emergency health care, and religious training. If both parents will share in the responsibility for making 
“major decisions”, then check the box for Joint Custody. You can share responsibility in major decision 
making even though the children are not in the care of each parent an equal amount of the time.  If you will 
not be sharing responsibility for major decisions, you need to decide which parent will have decision making 
authority, also called Sole Custody. You have the option to indicate whether the parent with Sole Custody 
will be required to talk to the other parent prior to making some or all “major decisions”. 

The parents have agreed to share in the responsibility for making major decisions about the children. 

This arrangement is known by the courts as Joint Custody. 

  

(parent’s  name)  shall  make  major  decisions  about  the  children. 

This 

arrangement is known by the courts as Sole Custody. 

The parent with sole custody will consult (discuss) with the other parent: 

prior to making major decisions. 
prior to making major decisions on these specific issues:   

(OPTIONAL) 

(OPTIONAL) 

The parent with sole custody will notify the other parent: 

prior to making major decisions. 
prior to making major decisions on these specific issues:   

 

 

Note:  If this parenting plan is attached to a signed order or judgment of the court, the custody 
provisions in the plan should be consistent with what is in the judgment or order.  In the event 
of a conflict, the custody designation in the signed order or judgment shall prevail. 

6.3  Information Sharing.   Unless there is a court order stating otherwise: 

Both parents have equal rights to inspect and receive the children’s school records, and both parents are 
encouraged to consult with school staff concerning the children’s welfare and education. Both parents are 
encouraged to participate in and attend the children’s school events. 

Both parents have equal rights to inspect and receive governmental agency and law enforcement records 
concerning the children. 

Both parents have equal rights  to consult with any person  who may provide care  or treatment for the 
children and to inspect and receive the children’s medical, dental and psychological records. 

Each parent has a continuing responsibility to provide a residential, mailing, or contact address and contact 
telephone number to the other parent. 

Each  parent  has  a  continuing  responsibility  to  immediately  notify  the  other  parent  of  any  emergency 
circumstances or substantial changes in the health of the children, including the children’s medical needs. 

7.  HOW WE WILL COMMUNICATE ABOUT AND WITH OUR CHILDREN 

7.1  Parent and Child Communication. 

Both parents and children shall have the right to communicate by telephone, in writing or by e-

mailing during reasonable hours without interference or monitoring by the other parent.

to  a  residence  more  than  60  miles  further  away  from  the  other  parent  without  giving  the  other  parent 
  

days’ notice of the change of residence and providing a copy of such notice to the court. 

Additional rules about moving: (DESCRIBE)   

9.  OTHER PROVISIONS ON HOW WE WILL WORK TOGETHER FOR OUR CHILDREN 

9.1  Children’s  Activities.  Children are often involved in activities other than school, such as sports, 
clubs, music, religious organizations, and social activities. Both parents are encouraged to take part in 
non-school  activities  with  their  children  during  their  parenting  time.  Non-school  activities  should  not 
unreasonably interfere with either parent’s schedule and parenting time.  Non-school activities that may 
affect the other parent’s schedule: (CHECK ONE) 

Must be coordinated with the other parent. 

Will be planned to occur primarily during one parent’s scheduled parenting time. 

Other:   

Other:   

9.2  Makeup and Missed Parenting Time.   Parenting time should only be postponed for substantial 
medical reasons. 

If a parent fails to have the children during their scheduled parenting time for any reasons, there will be 
no make-up of parenting time unless the parents agree:  (CHOOSE ONE) 
verbally 

in writing 

9.3  Mutual Respect.   The parents  will not say things or knowingly allow others to say things in the 
presence of the children that would take away the children’s love and respect for the other parent. 

9.4  Alternate Care. These are our ground rules for babysitters, day care providers, and other caregivers: 
(CHECK ALL THAT APPLY) 

We choose not to specify ground rules for alternate care. 

If a parent is unable to be with the children during scheduled parenting time, the other parent shall 
be the first choice to provide of their care. 

Only the following people may provide alternate care:  

The following people may not provide alternate care:

10.  PERMANENT CHANGES TO THE SCHEDULE. Any changes that we do not agree on can be made only 
by applying to the court for a modification.  One parent cannot change a court-ordered Parenting Plan on their 
own. 

10.  PERMANENT CHANGES TO THE SCHEDULE. Any changes that we do not agree on can be made only 
by applying to the court for a modification.  One parent cannot change a court-ordered Parenting Plan on their 
own. 

11.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION.  We will try to work out any parenting plan disputes on our own.  Only as a 
last resort will we resolve disputes through court action.  (Local court rules will apply after filing a court 
action)  Prior to filing any court action: (CHECK ONE) 

We  will  use  a  mutually  agreed-upon,  neutral  third-party  (such  as  a  mediator,  counselor,  or  other 
professional) to resolve any parenting plan disputes before filing a court action about the parenting plan. 
This shall not apply in the event of an emergency or abusive circumstance. 

(OPTIONAL) 

For now, the following professional(s) will assist us, if available:  

 

A dispute resolution process shall not be required prior to filing a court action. 

12.  SIGNATURES.  My signature below indicates that I have read and agree with what has been decided and 
written in this document. 

If the plan is proposed by only one parent, that parent alone should sign.  If the plan is agreed to by both parents, both 
parents should sign.  If you are filing this plan with the court, you should attach it to the appropriate legal document, 
such as a Petition or Judgment.
