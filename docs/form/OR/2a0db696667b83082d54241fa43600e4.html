General 
Do I have to register to use File & Serve? 
Yes, all users must register prior to using File & Serve. It is free to sign up for an account, all you need is an 
email address. 

What is the role of the Firm Administrator? 
The Firm Administrator registers the firm and is responsible for setting up and maintaining all information for 
system users, credit card accounts, and attorneys at the firm. 

When a new firm is registered, all users added to that firm are associated with the firm. If a firm has multiple 
locations, those users can be added to the original firm, but Tyler recommends that each location registers 
his or her location as a new firm with its own Firm Administrator. In this way, each firm’s users from each 
location will only see their specific filings for their specific location; otherwise, users will see instead of all 
filings under the original firm. 

Do independent users need a Firm Administrator to register 
for File & Serve? 
No, independent users do not need a Firm Administrator to register to use File & Serve. Independent users 
can register to use File & Serve without the assistance of a Firm Administrator. When registering you can 
choose between a firm account and an individual account. 

How can I get a user name and password? 
You can get a user name and password by registering to use File & Serve.

operating system using Firefox or Internet Explorer 7, 8, 9, or 10.

existing cases? 
Yes, File & Serve can be used to initiate cases, electronically file into existing cases, or electronically serve 
documents. Both attorneys and support staff can use the system to complete these tasks under their own 
user names. UTCR 21.070 sets out a list of documents that, due to technical or other reasons, cannot be 
electronically filed and instead must be conventionally filed.

not be automatically logged out. However, File & Serve will automatically log you out after a period of

What is an envelope? 

 

What is an envelope? 
An envelope is a filing submitted to the court. An envelope can contain one or more documents submitted to 
the court for the same case. File & Serve identifies filings by their envelope number. 

Is my e-filing automatically accepted when it is received? 
No, the documents that were filed will be reviewed by a court clerk before they are accepted. 

What is the filed date of my e-filed document? 
Once the court accepts the filing, the filed date is the date that the document was submitted to File & Serve 
for review. For more information please consult UTCR 21.080. 

How long are file-date-stamped documents available in my 
Filings queue? 
File-date-stamped documents are available for six months. 

Will I receive a notification if the court rejects my e-filing? 
Yes, you will receive a notification by email if your e-filing was rejected. This email will also contain the 
reason(s) for the rejection. Please consult UTCR 21.080(5) and the OJD Standards for Electronic 
Filings in Circuit Courts Supplemental Guide for Users for more information regarding rejections. 

If my e-filing is rejected and I resubmit the filing, what will the 
filed date be for my documents? 
If the corrected filing is submitted within three days of receiving notification of the rejection, and you comply 
with the requirements of UTCR 21.080(5), the court may approve relation back of the filed date to the 
original submission date of the rejected filing. For more information please consult UTCR 21.080(5). 

How do I enter the case number to search when searching for 
a case that I have filed using File & Serve? 
To search for a case in File & Serve, select the court where the case is located and type the case number 
exactly as it was given to you by your local court, with the two-digit year, the two-digit  letter case type, and 
the five-digit case number. For example, 13CR00001. For the old site, the search case field located in the 
upper-right corner of your screen. For the H5 site, select File into an Existing Case from the Filer 
Dashboard.  

How can I view a case filed more than 30 days ago? 
Filter the case listing by entering the date range in the Filings queue to view a case filed more than 30 days 
ago. 

What document formats does File & Serve accept? 
File & Serve only accepts documents in PDF or PDF-A formats. 

Can scanned documents be submitted in color? 
Yes, File & Serve will accept color documents. However, the preferred business process is to scan the 
documents in black and white.

Can I file multiple documents in one transaction? 
Yes, if all of the documents pertain to the same case, multiple documents can be submitted together by 
selecting the Add Another Filing option. The documents will be submitted to the court in a single File & 
Serve envelope. 

I have several documents to submit. What should I do? 
Documents and their incorporated attachments (exhibits, affidavits, declarations, etc.) should be 
submitted as a single PDF document (see UTCR 21.040(1) and (2)). There are two exceptions to this 
rule: 

1.  Any document requiring the court’s signature (such as a proposed order or proposed judgment) 

must be submitted as its own PDF document in the same envelope as its supporting 
documents. 

2.  Any document that is confidential (such as a confidential information form) must be submitted as 

its own PDF document in the same envelope as the other documents that are meant to 
accompany the document (such as a petition for dissolution).  
 

What is the maximum file size that can be electronically 
submitted? 
The file size may not exceed 25 MB per document. Documents greater than 25MB must be broken down 
and submitted as separate documents (within the same envelope) that do not exceed 25 MB. 

Each document should be submitted in order using the same filing code. The filer shall indicate which part 
of the whole document that the filed document represents (1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3) within the Filing Comments 
field. 

Please breakdown the document at logical points to ensure ease of use for judges viewing the documents 
electronically. See UTCR 21.040. 

What if I need to withdraw an e-filing? 
After a filing has been submitted but before the court’s review has begun, a Cancel button is available for 
that filing in your Filings queue. 

As long as the Cancel button is present, the filing has been submitted by File & Serve but not yet been 
reviewed by the court. If the Cancel button is not available, contact your local court clerk’s office. 

Do I have access to the documents that I file in the system? 
Yes, by using the My Filings feature located on the Filings tab, you can find and view information 
concerning electronic filings that have been submitted to File & Serve through your user name or by any 
member of your firm. 

After a transaction is completed, you can access a PDF version of all of your filings through the system for 
up to 180 days. This PDF version is read-only; it can no longer be modified. 

Are hyperlinks permissible in PDF documents? 
Internal links, which point to other places within the same document, are permissible and are accepted by 
File & Serve. However, external links, which point to other documents, websites, or other legal sources, can 
be risky and must be avoided in documents submitted to the court. Use of external links can result in format 
errors that may prevent your document from being accepted by File & Serve.

Fees 

Fees 
Is there a fee to use File & Serve? 
No, there are no fees for using File & Serve. The only fees that users will encounter are statutory filing fees. 

When are the fees assessed if I am filing multiple documents 
in a case? 
Statutory filing fees are assessed against the document contained in the envelope that is subject to the fee, 
such as the complaint or petition. 

Is it necessary to have a firm credit card? 
A credit card is required to pay for statutory filing fees. If you are exempt from paying these fees you can set 
up a waiver account, but some type of payment account is required in order to use File & Serve. 

Will there be a receipt for the fees paid? 

Yes, the Envelope Details screen can be printed for use as a receipt. For the old site, select the Filings tab, 

 icon to view the filing details. For the H5 site, select Envelope Details in the Actions dropdown

What are Firm Service Contacts? 
Firm Service Contacts are a list of the firm’s contacts that can be attached to the case and can be e-served. 

What are Case Service Contacts? 
There are Case Service Contacts for every case. This list contains all individuals being served on the case. 
Attorneys must ensure that they are on the Case Service Contact list. Please refer to UTCR 2.010(6) and 
(7) for definitions of “Service Contacts” and Other Service Contacts”, and to UTCR 2.100(2) and (3) 
regarding entry of contact information and selecting service contacts and other service contacts. 

You cannot add yourself to a case Service Contact list if you have never filed into the case. 

 Note: Once of you have e-filed in a case, it is mandatory to enter your contact information in the 

Case Service Contact list to ensure that you will receive notification of the e-service of any 
documents by others in the case. See UTCR 21.100(2). 

Can I use e-service without filing a document with the court? 
Yes, File & Serve may be used to exchange documents between parties without filing the documents 
through the courts. Courts do not have access to documents that have only been e-served. 

Select the Service check box on the Filings screen, and ensure the E-File check box is not selected. 

How do I serve other individuals with my e-filed documents? 
The filers are responsible for accomplishing service of all filings as required by the applicable court rules. 
For this purpose, filers may use the mail service, serve by hand delivery, use e-mail service as permitted by 
applicable rules, or use electronic service through the use of File & Serve, as it offers the option of 
electronic service of each filing to the designated service contact. 

Is there a work-around for navigating away from a page 
without losing data? 
Yes, perform the following steps before leaving your workspace to save your data: 

1.  Complete entering all of the data on the page you are currently working on. 
2.  Click the button to continue (or Save Changes in the H5 version). This will save your data and take you 

to the next screen. 

Does File & Serve send a service notification after a filing is 
submitted? 
Yes, File & Serve automatically generates service notifications for filing transactions after the filing is 
submitted if you have selected this option using the Manage (E-mail) Notification tab on the My Account 
screen.  

 Note: Check your spam or junk folder if you have not received a notification from File &  Serve. 

When is a service notification sent? 
Service notifications are generated after submitting a service-only filing. 

For E-File & Serve (EFS) filings, a notification is sent only after the court has accepted the filing. 

 Note: Check your spam or junk folder if you have not received a service notification.

Format Errors 

This section describes the format errors received when using File & Serve. 

Format Errors Defined 
I am receiving “Format Errors.” What does this mean? 

When a filing is not successfully processed and identified as having a “Format Error,” this indicates that the 
filing has one or more document files that are not valid for filing document conversion. The underlying cause 
of the issue is typically either that the document was not successfully uploaded or the document has a 
characteristic that prevents the standard processing of the file. 

As a start, errors of this type will be minimized if they comply with a standard format that includes the 
following: 

•  Use 8.5x11-inch paper with portrait orientation. 

•  Set the DPI resolution lower than 300. 

•  Do not use unintelligible images (i.e., all-black images). 

•  Use non-secured document properties (i.e., not password-protected). 

•  Remove external references in the documents, such as URLs and shortcuts. 

Causes of Typical Format Errors 
Format errors are typically caused by the following submissions: 

•  Corrupt files (i.e., files with 0 bytes of data). 

•  Secured or password-protected PDFs. This includes electronic certificates that prevent a document 
from being modified. These are typically used on documents containing electronic signatures. 

•  File types other than PDF. 

•  Files with non-standard image compression. Standard is CCIT; this is usually a scanner setting. 

•  A document that has Optical Character Recognition (OCR) associated with it; usually determined by 

a larger file size. 

•  Any file that experienced an upload issue or time out on the file transfer on behalf of the filing party; 

usually appearing as an incomplete image or file when opened. 

•  A document scan that is in landscape orientation, noticeably off-center, or of an irregular size. 

•  Any scan (PDF) that is unreadable or has large black images in the document where pictures may 

have been.

•  A file that contains an invalid table; usually a result of importing or pasting table data into a word 

processing application. 

Actions to Identify the Format Error Issue 
There are several ways to identify format issues within filed documents. This section can help identify 
documents with formatting issues. 

Checking the Filing Queue 

To determine this, do the following: 

The first action is to determine whether the document uploaded successfully. 

1.  Open the document files using the Filing Queue link on the left menu.

2.  Click the 
3.  Scroll down to the Documents section of the Filing Details page to locate the document uploaded. 
4.  Click on the document link under the File Name column to open the document. 

 Note: If the file does not open using the original authoring tool, cancel this filing and create a 

Prior to uploading documents for new filings, confirm the document files will open successfully from their 
original source. 

new filing. 

Corrupt Files 

Corrupt files, for example, files with zero (0) bytes of data are one of the many reasons a filing has format 
errors. 

Below are examples of corrupt file errors messages: 

•  A corrupted PDF document with zero byte file. 

Figure 1.7 – BAD PDF Corrupted File Message 

 

Document Security 

PDF files have security settings that can prevent documents from being e-filed. A file with document 
security has a padlock icon on the document and/or has “SECURED” shown in the file name.

Figure 1.8 – Document Security Message 

 

The document security can include a number of different options, any of which will prevent the document file 
from being processed. To ensure successful document processing, recreate the PDF with no security 
options.

Unsupported Fonts 

Font resources are included in newly created documents. This is a standard with PDF/A files. Document 
generating tools use non–supported fonts when creating documents, which results in the inability to convert 
the document into the standard e-filing format.

There are multiple ways to examine the fonts embedded in the file. PDF viewers can show the fonts, or the 
file editors can allow you view the fonts used. 

The JBig font is not a supported font. 

The following is an example of a PDF viewer identifying the fonts used by a PDF file.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
