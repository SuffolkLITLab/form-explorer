Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, in the opening statement I will tell you what the 

evidence will be. I will explain to you what we will prove throughout the course of this trial1. 

We will demonstrate that the defendant, Nora Rosendale, is guilty of the charges against her. 

Nora Rosendale was considered part of the popular or “cool2” crowd of kids. She was a senior3 

in high school with a high-end4 car and the latest in name-brand5 clothing. Additionally, she 

was a cheerleader6 for the varsity football team and dating the most popular boy in school—

they were even voted king and queen of their senior prom7. In other words, she was  

sailing through8 life - she was, that is, until April 15th, 20209.  

Larry McCormick, on the other hand10, was not considered popular by any  

stretch of the imagination11. His parents struggled to meet the yearly tuition12 costs of 

Hawthorne High School13. Larry rode the bus to school and wore hand-me-downs14 from his 

older brother. Some kids might have a chip on their shoulder15 under similar circumstances, but 

by all accounts, Larry was a thoughtful16 and kind teenager who mostly kept to himself17. 

On the morning of April 15th, 2020, Nora found some oxycodone hydrochloride, 

commonly referred to as Oxycontin18, in her father Hank Rosendale’s medicine cabinet19. Mr. 

Rosendale suffered then, and still suffers from, terminal20 cancer. For those of us who are 

unaware, Oxycontin is a drug that you can only get with a prescription21 and is a painkiller22 

typically used to help provide relief from severe pain. Unless you’ve been living under a rock23 

for the past decade24, you know that, unfortunately25, this drug is highly abused26 in our 

country. You can barely scan the headlines27 nowadays without reading about another person 

falling victim28 to Oxycontin abuse—celebrities, stay-at-home29 moms, high-powered30 

politicians, junkies—no one is immune31 to the opioid epidemic32 affecting our country and the 

rest of the world.

That said, Nora would have been well aware33 of the tragic turn34 that taking these drugs 

without a prescription could take. Don’t let anyone try and tell you otherwise35. Despite this 

knowledge, later that same evening, Nora pressured36 Larry McCormick into trying some of the 

Oxy at a party they were both attending—teasing37 him in front of a group of peers38 and 

repeatedly calling him a “dumbass39” until he finally caved40. Larry liked how the drugs made 

him feel—happy, almost euphoric41, and incredibly relaxed. He chased that high42 all night, 

eventually crushing and snorting43 the pills as the night progressed, mixing everything with 

alcohol44.  

As you will learn from the expert witnesses45 we will call throughout this case, the 

effects of this drug—the euphoria and pleasant feelings--can change in an instant to very low 

blood pressure46, difficulty breathing, and even unconsciousness47. It can severely limit your 

ability to operate48 a vehicle, or any other type of equipment or machinery49, for that matter. 

The sad fact of this case50 is that Larry McCormick took this drug, after it was given to him by 

Nora Rosendale, the popular girl who pressured the unpopular kid into taking her father’s 

medication. Then, when he was riding51 his bike home after a night of partying52, it made him 

drowsy53. He passed out and drove his bike into oncoming54 traffic and, most tragically,  

ladies and gentlemen of the jury55, he died from injuries sustained56 in that accident—all 

because he made the poor decision to take someone else’s prescription medication. 

 

Just the simple act of taking someone else’s prescription drugs, such as57 Larry taking 

Nora’s father’s Oxy that fateful58 night, is illegal possession59 of a drug. And Larry 

McCormick’s bad judgment60 led to the loss of his life. But he is not the only one who 

exercised61 poor judgment that night. If you sell or distribute62 someone else’s prescription 

drugs to another, that constitutes the offense63 of sale or distribution of a controlled64 substance.

And, if that illegal act65 causes someone else’s death, you can also be found guilty66 of the 

separate offense of involuntary manslaughter. So, the other person who should be held 

responsible for Larry’s death that night is the defendant, Nora Rosendale. 

 

The most serious charge67 against the defendant in this case is that she distributed an 

ultimately lethal quantity68 of this controlled substance to Larry McCormick, causing his death. 

The Court69 will instruct you at the end of this case as to what constitutes  

involuntary manslaughter70 and the Court will go into great detail to make sure you understand 

the charge. But the most basic elements71 are that if a person, by negligent72 or unlawful 

conduct, causes another person to die, even if73 the person didn’t mean to, that person can be 

found guilty of involuntary manslaughter. After hearing all of the evidence , you will agree74 that 

not only is Nora Rosendale guilty of possessing and distributing a controlled substance to Larry 

McCormick, she is also guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the cause75 of his death. Thank 

you for your time.
