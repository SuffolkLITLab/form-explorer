motion with a supporting affidavit and proposed order to the presiding judge for consideration 

unless otherwise directed in the operations plan.

A.  Attorneys are expected to appear in-person for trials or hearings that are held in-person unless the

remotely as reflected in the Lane County Circuit Court Covid-19 Operations Plan. Attorneys are 

expected to assist the court with maintaining the health and safety of the courthouse.   

B.  An attorney who has concerns about appearing in-person, or having their client appear in 

person, due to illness or COVID-19 concerns should seek to be excused, request a 

postponement, or request to appear remotely if feasible. 

C.  An attorney seeking to appear remotely at a scheduled in person court appearance due to 

concerns regarding COVID-19 must submit a motion with a supporting affidavit and proposed 

order. 

a.  The affidavit must include: 

i.  Whether the attorney or a member of the attorney’s household has a concern 

based upon confidentially protected health information that would preclude the 

attorney to safely appear in person at the proceeding. Specific confidentially 

protected health information should not be included in the motion or affidavit, as 

the documents are a public record. 

ii.  Whether their client has been notified of and consents to the attorney 

appearing remotely. 

b.  If the matter is a proceeding in a criminal case and a defense attorney’s request to appear 

remotely is allowed under this section, the defense attorney must arrange for another 

defense attorney to be present in person at the proceeding with the client. 

 

7.  Lane County Circuit Court’s Quarantine and Isolation Judge is:  The Presiding Judge 

8.  Presiding Judge Authority, UTCR and SLR 

A.  Notwithstanding the Lane County Circuit Court Covid-19 Operations Plan, I retain discretion to 

order that a particular trial, hearing, or other court operation will take place in-person or by 

remote means.

B.  The Uniform Trial Court Rules remain in full force and effect unless limited expressly or by 

action of CJO or this PJO.  This includes UTCR 3.180(5), the provision prohibiting the recording 

of any court proceeding without the prior express permission of the court.  These provisions 

apply to all court proceedings regardless of whether the proceeding is in person or remote. 

C.  If I become unable to perform the duties of the presiding judge during these operations 

restrictions, Judge Jay McAlpin shall have authority to act as presiding judge during my 

incapacity.   

9.  Effective Dates 

This order becomes effective on November 29, 2021. 

                                                                                                    ________________________________
