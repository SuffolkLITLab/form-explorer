upon any document delivered for filing the day and month, and the year the 
Administrator received the document.  

(iv)

Delivery for filing using the eFiling system is subject to Chapter 

 
16 of these rules.  

(iii)  Using United States Postal Service or Commercial Delivery 

 
Service 

 
(A)  A person may deliver an initiating document for filing via 
the U.S. Postal Service, and delivery is complete on the date of mailing if 
mailed or dispatched for delivery in accordance with ORS 19.260(1)(a).  If 
the Administrator receives the initiating document within the time 
prescribed by law, the person need not submit proof of the date of mailing. 

7 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If the Administrator does not receive the document within the time 
prescribed law and the person must rely on the date of mailing as the date 
of delivery, the person must file with the Administrator acceptable proof 
from the U.S. Postal Service of the date of mailing. Acceptable proof from 
the U.S. Postal Service of the date of mailing must be a receipt for 
certified or registered mail or other class of service for delivery within 
three calendar days, with the mail number on the envelope or on the item 
being mailed, and the date of mailing either stamped by the U.S. Postal 
Service on the receipt or shown by a U.S. Postal Service postage validated 
imprint on the envelope received by the Administrator or the U.S. Postal 
Service's online tracking system. 

 
(B)  A person may deliver an initiating document for filing via 
commercial delivery service, and the delivery is complete on the date of 
dispatch for delivery by the delivery service if dispatched for delivery in 
accordance with ORS 19.260(1)(a).  If the Administrator receives the 
initiating document within the time prescribed by law, the person need not 
submit proof of the date of delivery for dispatch. If the Administrator does 
not receive the document within the time prescribed by law and if the 
person must rely on the date of delivery for dispatch, the person must file 
with the Administrator proof from the commercial delivery service of the 
date of delivery for dispatch, which may include the commercial delivery 
service's online tracking service. 

 
(C)  A person involuntarily confined in a state or local 
government facility may deliver an initiating document for filing via the 
U.S. Postal Service and the date of filing relates back to the date of 
delivery for mailing if the person complies with ORS 19.260(3).  If the 
person relies on the date of delivery for mailing, the person must certify 
the date of delivery to the person or place designated by the facility for 
handling outgoing mail.  

(D) 

Filing of any other document required to be filed within a 
 
prescribed time, including any brief, petition for attorney fees, statement 
of costs and disbursements, motion, or petition for review, is complete if 
mailed via the U.S. Postal Service or dispatched via commercial delivery 
service on or before the due date if the class of mail or delivery is 
calculated to result in the Administrator receiving the document within 
three calendar days.  

(iv)  Conventional Filing Not Using U.S. Postal Service or Commercial 

 
Delivery Service 

If a person does not deliver a document for filing via the eFiling 

 
system, the U.S. Postal Service, or commercial delivery service as 
provided in this paragraph, then the document is not deemed filed until the 

8 
 

document is actually received by the Administrator.

(ii) 

A party filing a motion for waiver or deferral of court fees and 

 
costs under ORS 21.682 need not serve on any other party to the case a copy of 
the motion or any accompanying documentation of financial eligibility.4  After the 
court has ruled on the motion, if another party to the case requests a copy of the 
motion or documentation of financial eligibility for the purpose of challenging the 
court's ruling, the filing party must comply with the request but may redact 
protected personal information as described in ORAP 8.50(1).  As used in this 
clause, "documentation of financial eligibility" means a document showing 
eligibility for a government benefit based on financial need or an affidavit or 
declaration showing the income, assets, and financial obligations of a party and 
the party's household.  

 
another person as provided in ORCP 9 or by commercial delivery service.

(ii) 

Electronic service via the eFiling system is permitted only on 

 
attorneys who are authorized users of the eFiling system and only as provided in 
ORAP 16.45. 

(iii) 

 
provided in ORCP 9 F or G. 

Service by email or facsimile communication is permitted only as 

(c) 

 
party delivered the document for filing.  

Each service copy must include a certificate showing the date that the 

(d) 

Any document filed with the Administrator must contain either an 

 
acknowledgment of service by the person served or proof of service in the form of a 
statement of the date and manner of service, and the names and addresses of the persons 
served, certified by the person who made service, except that: 

 

(i) 

If a person was served by the appellate courts' eFiling system, the 

9 
 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

certificate must state that service was accomplished at the person's email address 
as recorded on the date of service in the appellate eFiling system, and need not 
include the person's email address or mailing address.  

(ii) 

If a person was served by email or by facsimile communication, 

 
the proof of service must state the email address or telephone number used to 
serve the person, as applicable, and need not include the person's mailing address.  

 

(e) 

Service on Trial Court Administrators and Transcript Coordinators 

(i)  When a copy of a notice of appeal is required to be served on the 

 
trial court administrator, service is sufficient if it is mailed or delivered to the 
person serving in the capacity of trial court administrator for the county in which 
the judgment or appealable order is entered. 

(ii)  When a copy of a notice of appeal is required to be served on the 

 
transcript coordinator, service is sufficient if it is mailed or delivered to the office 
of the trial court administrator, addressed to "transcript coordinator."  

(iii)  An authorized user of the trial court electronic filing system may 

 
serve a copy of a notice of appeal on the trial court administrator and the 
transcript coordinator by using the "Courtesy Copies" email function of that 
system.  The email address for each judicial district's trial court administrator and 
transcript coordinator are available on the judicial district's website. 
 

_________ 
1 At this time, only an active member of the Oregon State Bar may become an authorized user of 
the appellate courts' eFiling system.  Therefore, self-represented litigants and attorneys who are 
not active members of the Oregon State Bar may not file a document with the appellate court 
using the eFiling System. 

 ORAP 1.35 defines "initiating document" for purposes of conventional filing.  For those 
purposes, the term does not include a petition for review under ORAP 9.05.  ORAP 16.05 
defines "initiating document" for purposes of eFiling and eService.  For those purposes, the term 
does include a petition for review under ORAP 9.05.  ORAP 16.05(8).

Rule 2.10 
SEPARATE NOTICES OF APPEAL 

(1) 

If the trial court consolidated two or more cases, a party must file a separate 

notice of appeal in each case in which the party seeks to appeal the judgment.  The Administrator 
will decide whether to place the notices of appeal in the same appellate file, but the appellant 
may state in each notice of appeal a preference that the Administrator place them in the same 
appellate file or assign them separate appellate case numbers.  If the Administrator assigns 
separate appellate case numbers to each notice of appeal, any party to either appeal may move to 
consolidate the appellate cases. 

(2) 

After a party has filed a notice of appeal from a decision in a trial court case, if 

another party files a notice of appeal from a decision in the same trial court case, the 
Administrator may place the subsequent notice of appeal in the same appellate file as the first 
notice of appeal or may assign a new appellate case number to the subsequent notice of appeal, 
subject to the following: 
 

 

(a)  When the Administrator has placed a subsequent notice of appeal in the 

15                                                             Chapter 2

assignment of a new appellate case number to the subsequent notice of appeal. 

(b)  When the Administrator has assigned a new appellate case number to a 

 
subsequent notice of appeal, any party to either appeal may move to consolidate the 
appellate cases. 

(3)  With respect to violation or infraction cases initiated by citations and heard by the 

trial court at the same time, one notice of appeal identifying the judgment or judgments being 
appealed is sufficient. 

Rule 2.15

appellate court case,3 the appellant is required to pay a filing fee at the time of the subsequent 
notice of appeal. 

(3) 

Except as provided in subsection (4) of this rule, a respondent's appearance fee is 

required for each respondent appearing separately or for two or more respondents appearing 
jointly.  When a notice of appeal has been filed and a notice of appeal subsequently is filed in 
circumstances resulting in the creation of a new appellate court case, the respondent shall pay an 
appearance fee at the time of the appearance in the subsequent appeal. 
 

(a) 

(4) 
first appearance, only one appearance fee is required. 

If two or more respondents appearing jointly submit a single brief or other 

(b) 

If a respondent concurs in a brief but does not join in submitting it, no

(c) 

After a brief is filed, if a stipulation is filed allowing a second respondent 
 
to join in the brief, the second respondent is deemed to have appeared, and an appearance 
fee is required from that party. 
 
(5) 

If a party fails to pay the appearance fee, the court will not consider any thing 

 
filed by that party, and that party will not be allowed to argue the appeal.

AND ATTORNEY FEES AFTER NOTICE OF APPEAL FILED 

(1) 

If the trial court enters a supplemental judgment awarding attorney fees or costs 
and disbursements under ORCP 68 C(5)(b) after the notice of appeal has been filed, and if the 
appellant intends to challenge the supplemental judgment on appeal, the appellant, within 30 
days after entry of the supplemental judgment, shall serve and file an amended notice of appeal 
from the supplemental judgment. 

(2) 

If the trial court enters a supplemental judgment disallowing, in whole or in part, 

any request for attorney fees or costs and disbursements after the notice of appeal has been 
served, and if a respondent intends to challenge the supplemental judgment on appeal: 
 

(a) 

If that respondent has, before entry of the supplemental judgment, timely 

 
filed notice of cross-appeal, that respondent, within 30 days after entry of the 
supplemental judgment, shall serve and file an amended notice of cross-appeal from the 
supplemental judgment. 

(b)

function of the appellate courts' eFiling system to notify the attorney for any person who 
was a party under ORS 419B.875(1)(a)(A)-(C), (H), or ORS 419B.875(1)(b) to the case 
in the juvenile court from which the appeal was taken, when 

that person was not designated in the notice of appeal as a party to 

(i) 
 
the appeal; and 

(ii) 

 
under ORAP 2.25(3).  

that person has not filed a notice of intent to participate on appeal 

(b) 

 
The notification sent to an attorney under subsection (a) will notify that 
attorney that the document has been eFiled, but will not permit the attorney to view the 
document, due to security that applies to juvenile cases in the eFiling system.  The 
notification does not operate as service.1  The attorney may access the document through 
the appellate courts' remote electronic access system, if the attorney has juvenile case 
permissions in that system.

If an appeal is pending from an order or judgment of a juvenile court, the juvenile 

court enters a subsequent appealable order or judgment, and a party to the juvenile court case 
wishes to appeal from the subsequent order or judgment: 
 

(a) 

If the party who wishes to appeal is the appellant in the pending appeal, 

 
the appellant shall serve and file an amended notice of appeal from the subsequent order 
or judgment. 

(b) 

If the party who wishes to appeal is the cross-appellant in the pending 

 
appeal, the cross-appellant shall serve and filed an amended notice of cross-appeal from 
the subsequent order or judgment.

(a) 

If the copy of the motion required to be served on the appellate court is not 

 
entitled "MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM ORDER OR JUDGMENT UNDER ORS 
419B.923," the copy shall be accompanied by a letter of transmittal identifying the 
motion as a motion for relief under ORS 419B.923. 

(b) 

 
Any party to the appeal may request the appellate court to hold the appeal 
in abeyance pending disposition of the motion or allow the appeal to go forward.  In the 
absence of a request from a party, the court on its own motion will review the motion for 
relief from judgment and decide whether to hold the appeal in abeyance.  If the court 
does not order the appeal to be held in abeyance, the appeal will go forward. 

(c) 

If the appellate court holds an appeal in abeyance pending disposition of a 

 
motion for relief from order or judgment and subsequently the court receives a copy of 
the juvenile court's order deciding the motion, after expiration of the period within which 
an appeal from the order may be filed, the appellate court will decide whether to 
reactivate the case or take other action. 

(d) 

 
A party wishing to appeal an order deciding a motion for relief from order 
or judgment under ORS 419B.923 during the pendency of an appeal shall file a notice of 
appeal within the time and in the manner prescribed in ORS chapter 19.  The notice of 
appeal as filed shall bear the same appellate case number assigned to the original notice 
of appeal.

including parties or entities dismissed from the case, notwithstanding that the title of the 
judgment being appealed may not refer to all parties in the case. 

(b) 

All parties should be named completely and should be identified by their 

designations in the trial court (e.g., plaintiff, defendant, cross-plaintiff, intervenor) and on 
appeal, as appropriate (e.g., appellant, respondent, cross-appellant, cross-respondent).  A 
party to the case who is not a party on appeal should be designated only by that party's 
designation in the trial court. 

(c) 

Parties to a cross-claim, third-party claim or counterclaim should be set 

forth in a separate case title under the original case title. 

(d)  Where the trial court has used an "In Re" or other similar case title that 
does not identify the adverse parties to the proceeding, such as in probate and juvenile 
court cases, the contesting parties should be set forth in a separate case title under the 
original case title. 

(e) 

The title shall include the trial court case number or numbers.1 

 
(2) 

The Administrator may correct the title of the case on appeal or judicial review to 

 
include all persons who were parties to the proceeding below and to designate properly the 
parties according to their status on appeal or judicial review.  If the Administrator corrects the 
title, the Administrator shall give notice and opportunity to respond to all parties to the appeal or 
judicial review. 
 

(a) 

A person who was a party to the case in the tribunal from which the appeal 
(3) 
was taken but who was not designated in the notice of appeal as a party to the appeal may 
appear as of right as a party to the appeal by filing a notice of intent to participate as a 
party. 

(b) 

If the notice of appeal in a juvenile court, guardianship, conservatorship or 

other similar proceeding does not identify the juvenile or protected person as a party to 
the appeal, the juvenile or protected person may appear as of right as a party to the appeal 
by filing a notice of intent to participate as a party. 

(c) 

A notice of intent to participate on appeal under paragraph (a) or (b) of 

this subsection shall be filed within 21 days after the date of filing of the notice of appeal, 
or within such further time as may be allowed by the court, and shall be served on all 
other parties to the appeal and on the court reporter or transcriber, if any, preparing the 
transcript. 

(d) 

A party who appears on appeal under paragraph (a) or (b) of this 

subsection may recover costs and attorney fees, if any, and is liable for costs and attorney 
fees, if any, the same as any party to an appeal.

avoiding public disclosure of the identity of natural persons who are parties to the case.2  
For the same purpose, in all other cases, on motion of a party or on its own motion, and 
for good cause shown, the court may modify the case title or the version of the court's

Referral to Court of Appeals of Question of Authority to Decide Case 

(a) 
This subsection applies to an action or other proceeding against a public body 
when a circuit court or other tribunal refers the question of its legal authority to decide 
the case pursuant to ORS 14.165. 
 

The court or other tribunal shall: 

(b) 

(i) 

Issue a referral order entitled "REFERRAL ORDER PURSUANT 

 
TO ORS 14.165" stating the nature of the question of authority to decide the 
action or proceeding that has arisen, briefly summarizing the parties' contentions, 
and, if time is of the essence, identifying the date by which the court or other 
tribunal requests that the matter be decided. 

(ii) 

 
through the Administrator, and send a copy of the referral order to each party. 

Transmit the referral order and the record to the Court of Appeals 

(c) 

Any party wishing to address in the Court of Appeals the question of 

 
which court or other tribunal, if any, has authority to decide the action or proceeding may 
file a memorandum addressing the question. Any such memorandum shall be in the form 
prescribed in ORAP 7.10 for motions generally, shall not exceed 10 pages without leave 
of the court, and shall be served and filed within 21 days after the date of receipt by the 
Court of Appeals of the referral order. 

(d) 

The Court of Appeals will decide the question as provided in ORS 

14.165(5) summarily and as expeditiously as practicable, and will endeavor to decide the 
question by the date, if any, identified in the referral order. 

   

(e) 

The Court of Appeals will issue an order communicating its decision to 

 
the parties and to the court or other tribunal that referred the question. If the Court of 
Appeals decides that another court or other tribunal has authority to decide the case, the 
Court of Appeals will enter a transfer order and send a copy of the order to each party. 
Pursuant to ORS 14.165(8), the person who filed the action or proceeding must comply 
with the provisions of ORS 14.165(8) to accomplish the transfer. At the request of the 
court or other tribunal to which the case has been transferred, the Court of Appeals will 
transmit the record to the court or other tribunal. 

(f) 

No filing fee or first appearance fee is due for a referral to the Court of 

 
Appeals for a summary determination under ORS 14.165 of the question of authority to 
decide a case.

(b) 

 
The Court of Appeals will enter an order stating its determination that it is 
the appropriate court to decide the case and identifying any actions that a party must take 
to perfect the case. On entry of the order, the case will be deemed to have been 
transferred to the Court of Appeals. 

(c) 

For the purpose of determining the next event in the appellate process, the 

case will be deemed to have been filed in the Court of Appeals as of the date of entry of 
the order referred to in paragraph (2)(b) of this rule.* 

(d) 

The appellant or petitioner shall pay the appellate court filing fee within 

 
10 days after the date of entry of the order of the Court of Appeals or such additional time 
as the court may allow. Any respondent shall pay the respondent's first appearance fee on 
the respondent's first appearance thereafter. 

(3) 

Transfer of Case to the Court of Appeals 

(a) 

 
If the circuit court determines pursuant to ORS 14.165(1)(a) that the Court 
of Appeals is the court authorized by law to hear an action or proceeding against a public 
body and transfers the case to the Court of Appeals, the person who filed the action or 
proceeding must comply with ORS 14.165(8). 

(b)  When the person who filed the action or proceeding files a copy of the 

 
transfer order with the Administrator, the Administrator will assign a case number to the 
case. For the purpose of determining the next event in the appellate process, the case will 
be deemed to have been filed in the Court of Appeals on the day of filing of a copy of the 
circuit court's transfer order.* 

(c) 

The person filing the action or proceeding shall pay the appellate filing fee 

 
at the same time as filing a copy of the transfer order or within such additional time as 
may be allowed by the Court of Appeals. Any respondent shall pay the respondent's first 
appearance fee on the respondent's first appearance thereafter. 

(d) 

 
must take to perfect the case in the Court of Appeals. 

The Court of Appeals will give a party notice of any actions that the party 

 

   

On referral of a question to the Court of Appeals under ORS 14.165(1)(b) or (3), if the 

 
Court of Appeals decides that it is the appropriate court to decide a case referred to it: 
 

(a) 

The Administrator will assign the case a regular appellate case number. 

________ 
* Regardless of the date that the case is deemed filed in the Court of Appeals for the purpose of 
determining the next event in the appellate process, see ORS 14.165(6) and (7) regarding 
determining the timeliness of the filing of the action or proceeding.

Rule 3.25 
EXHIBITS 

(1) 

Exhibits designated as part of the record on appeal shall not be transmitted to the 
appellate court unless requested by the Administrator. The Administrator will request transmittal 
of documentary exhibits when it requests transmittal of the trial court file under ORAP 3.15(2), 
or sooner if requested by a party. The Administrator will request transmittal of a 
nondocumentary exhibit only if requested to do so by a party to the appeal or at the direction of 
the court. A party wishing to have one or more nondocumentary exhibits transmitted to the 
appellate court shall notify the Administrator by letter specifying the exhibit or exhibits to be 
transmitted. The letter shall be submitted to the Administrator no later than the date of filing of 
that party's brief and shall be copied to all other parties to the appeal. 

(2)  When the appellate court requests transmittal of documentary exhibits, the trial 
court administrator promptly shall transmit the documentary exhibits to the appellate court in a 
single envelope, so far as practicable, and shall note thereon or, if no envelope is used, on a 
separate list, the number and description of all exhibits being transmitted, with notations 
indicating those received and those not received in evidence. 

(3) 

Notwithstanding a party's request for nondocumentary exhibits pursuant to 

subsection (1) of this rule, the trial court administrator need not transmit exhibits which are 
bulky, dangerous or difficult to transmit or store, such as machinery, firearms, clothing, 
narcotics, chemicals, money, or jewelry, unless a party in its request to the Administrator 
identifies the exhibit with particularity and requests that the Administrator arrange to have the 
exhibit transmitted to the appellate court. The trial court administrator shall make appropriate 
notation of retained exhibits on the exhibit list. 

(4) 

If a party fails to comply with UTCR 6.120(2) requiring return of documentary 

exhibits within 21 days after receipt of the trial court's request, following the filing of a notice of 
appeal by any party, the appellate court may order that the appeal proceed without consideration 
of that party's exhibits. 

(5) 

For purposes of this rule, "documentary exhibits" include text documents, 

photographs and maps, if not oversized, and audio and video recordings. An oversized document 
is one larger than standard letter size or legal size.

Rule 3.30 
EXTENSION OF TIME FOR PREPARATION OF TRANSCRIPT 

(1) 

Except as provided in ORAP 3.40(3), only the appellate court may grant an 

extension of time for the preparation of a transcript. 

(2) 

A request for an extension of time to prepare a transcript may be filed by the party 

responsible for causing the transcript to be prepared or by the court reporter or transcriber (in 
audio and video record cases) responsible for preparing the transcript. 

(3) 

A request for an extension of time shall include the amount of time sought, the 

number of previous extensions obtained and the reason for the extension of time. 

(4) 

If all or part of the need for an extension of time is the failure to make satisfactory 

arrangements for payment of the transcript, the request shall so state. If a party makes a request 
for an extension of time under this rule, the party shall show why appropriate arrangements have 
not been made. The court in its discretion may deny the extension of time and direct that the 
appeal proceed without the transcript. 

(5) 

A court reporter's or transcriber's request for an extension of time shall include the 

date on which the transcript was ordered, the number of days of proceedings designated on 
appeal, the approximate number of pages of transcript to be prepared, and information about 
other transcripts due on appeal. The request shall be substantially in the form illustrated in 
Appendix 3.30 and shall show proof of service on the parties and, for the second or any 
subsequent request for extension of time, on the trial court administrator. 

(6) 

Any party may file an objection to a court reporter's or transcriber's request for an 

extension of time within 14 days after the request is filed.  The objection must be served on all 
other parties, the court reporter or transcriber, and the trial court administrator.  An objection 
received after the court has granted the request will be treated as a motion for reconsideration of 
the ruling.  On reconsideration, if the court modifies the extension of time, the court reporter or 
transcriber and the parties will be notified; otherwise, the objection will be noted and placed in 
the file.

in the industry can use to prepare a transcript of the recording.  

(ii) 

If the party offering the recording as evidence is unable to make a 

 
copy of the recording in an appropriate format, with the consent of the adverse 
party, the party offering the recording may prepare a transcript of the recording in 
the format required by ORAP 3.35. The adverse party must not unreasonably 
withhold consent.  

 

(c) 

 
Serve a copy of the transcript on each party required by ORS 19.370 and 
file with the Administrator and serve on each party, the trial court administrator, and the 
transcript coordinator a certificate of preparation and service of transcript2 within the time 
provided in ORS 19.370.  The certificate of preparation and service of the transcript must 
list the dates of all proceedings transcribed, the volume numbers of the transcript(s), and 
the page numbers specific to each transcript.  In a criminal case, the state's copy of the 
transcript shall be served on the Attorney General.3  If the transcript is not served and the 
certificate is not served and filed within that time, the court reporter or transcriber shall 
move for an extension of time. 

(d) 

Upon notice from the Administrator of the settlement of the transcript, file 

 
with the Administrator an electronic version of the transcript in the form required by 
ORAP 3.35(2) and, at the same time, file with the Administrator and serve on each party 
a certificate of filing of transcript.4  The certificate of filing must be a separate document 
and may not be included as part of the electronic version of the transcript.  Filing an 
electronic version of the transcript with the Administrator is in lieu of filing a paper 
transcript and shall be in the form provided in ORAP 3.35(2).

(i) 

If a party is represented by an attorney, unless the attorney has 

 
made other arrangements with the court reporter or transcriber, the court reporter 
or transcriber shall serve the transcript in electronic form on the attorney at the 
email address identified in the notice of appeal as required by ORAP 2.05(5).  If a 
party is not represented by an attorney, unless the party has made other 
arrangements with the court reporter or transcriber, the court reporter or 
transcriber shall serve a paper copy of the transcript on the party.  In addition to or 
in lieu of service by email or by paper copy, an attorney or party may make 
arrangements with the court reporter or transcriber to provide a copy of the 
transcript to that attorney or party on an optical disk or USB drive, or in other 
comparable medium. 

(ii) 

If two or more respondents not represented by attorneys must be 

 
served by paper copy as provided in clause (5)(a)(i) of this rule, the court reporter 
or transcriber shall provide one copy of the transcript to the trial court 
administrator for use by all such respondents.  The copy of the transcript provided 
to the trial court administrator under this clause shall be in the medium (e.g., 
paper or optical disk) requested by the trial court. 

(b) 

 
If a party or attorney negotiates with a court reporter or transcriber to 
provide the transcript in a medium, other than paper or email, provided by the court 
reporter or transcriber, the court reporter or transcriber may request payment of no more 
than $5.00 per optical disk, USB drive, or other comparable medium. 

(c) 

A party may specify in the party's designation of record or other request 

 
for preparation of a transcript on appeal that the version of the transcript to be provided to 
that party be prepared by reducing the pages of the transcript in such a manner as to fit up 
to four pages of transcript onto a single 8-1/2 x 11 inch page or in the one page of 
transcript per one standard page format. If a party not responsible for arranging for 
preparation of a transcript is served with a transcript containing four reduced pages of 
transcript on one standard page, that party may arrange with the court reporter or 
transcriber, at the party's own expense, for preparation of a transcript in the one page of 
transcript per one standard page format.5 

(6) 

The court reporter or transcriber may not charge for preparing more than one 
original transcript and may charge only at the rate for copying a transcript for any additional 
transcript that may be needed for an appeal or appeals: 
 

(a)  When two or more cases are heard simultaneously in the circuit court from 

 
which one or more appeals are taken, either as consolidated cases or otherwise; or 

(b)  When two or more cases not heard simultaneously in the circuit court are 

 
consolidated on appeal before the transcripts are prepared.

electronic transcript to an email directed to appealsclerk@ojd.state.or.us.  If the 
Administrator determines that an electronic transcript must be rejected for security 
reasons (e.g., virus or malware), the court reporter or transcriber shall resubmit the

court administrator shall prepare and sign a proof of service certifying the date or dates 
on which the party received a copy of the audio or video record.  The trial court 
administrator's certificate shall constitute proof of service of the audio or video record on 
that party and shall be forwarded to the appellate court in lieu of the proof of service 
required in paragraph (1)(c) of this rule. 

(c) 

 
If the trial court administrator has provided a copy of all or part of an

video record to a party, the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this subsection 
shall apply to so much of the audio or video record as has been previously provided to a 
party. 

(5) 

If a part of a recording is extracted from the official audio or video recording and 
duplicated for the purpose of appeal, the trial court administrator shall attach a certificate stating 
that the copy is an accurate copy of the extracted part of the original.  The copy containing the 
extract of the official recording shall become the official recording on appeal in lieu of the copy 
referred to in subsection (1) of this rule.  The trial court administrator shall make copies of the 
extracted copy of the recording for service on the parties to the appeal, and prepare a certified 
copy of the relevant part or parts of the official log, to be served and filed as part of the record on 
appeal.

of orders of state agencies in contested cases and shall show the Board of Parole and Post-Prison 
Supervision as respondent. 

Rule 4.15 
FORM, CONTENT, AND SERVICE OF PETITION 
FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW 

(1) 

A petition for judicial review shall be typewritten, double-spaced, and 

substantially in the form illustrated in Appendix 4.15-1 or Appendix 4.15-2 and must contain: 
 

(a) 

The title as it was before the agency to the extent possible.  The title shall 

 
include the names of the parties to the proceeding regardless of whether the title of the 
agency proceeding included the names of the parties.  The title also shall include the 
agency if the agency is a party to the judicial review.  The title must indicate the 
designations of the parties before the appellate court (e.g., petitioner, respondent, cross-
petitioner, cross-respondent).  If a party from the agency proceeding is not named as a 
party before the appellate court, the title shall indicate the party's agency designation, if 
any, followed by "below."1 

(b) 

A designation of the parties in the judicial review proceeding before the 

appellate court, including their positions in the appellate court proceeding (e.g., 

   

 

   

   

   

   

   

  _

petitioner, respondent). 

(c) 

The litigant contact information required by ORAP 1.30. 

(d) 

A self-represented party who consents to service of the agency record by 

SFTP as provided in ORAP 4.20 must so state in the petition for judicial review and 
provide the party's email address in the petition.2  At any time before the agency 
transmits the record to the court, a self-represented party who has consented to service of 
the agency record by electronic means may revoke that consent by notifying the court and 
the agency.  A self-represented party who has provided the court and the state agency 
with an email address under this paragraph must notify the court and the agency of a 
change of email address. 

(e) 

A statement whether the petitioner is willing to stipulate that the agency 

 
record may be shortened. If the petitioner is willing to shorten the record, the petition 
shall designate the part of the record to be included in the record. Under ORS 183.482(4), 
the court may tax the cost of preparing the whole or any part of the record, including the 
transcript, against any party unreasonably refusing to stipulate to limit the record. 

(2) 

Only the original need be filed.  The petition shall be accompanied by a copy of 

the order, rule, or ruling for which judicial review is sought. 

(3) 

The petition shall show proof of service on: 

(a) 

 
the petitioner), even if the agency is not a party; 

the agency whose order, rule, or ruling is involved (unless the agency is 

(b) 

the Attorney General, even if the agency is not a party.3 In a workers' 

 
compensation case, only if the State Accident Insurance Fund is a party to the case and is 
representing a state agency, the petition shall show proof of service on the Attorney 
General; 

(c) 

all other parties of record in the proceeding; and 

(d) 

any other person required by law to be served.4 

(4) 

The petition shall include a certificate of filing specifying the date the petition for 

judicial review was filed with the Administrator.

RECORD ON JUDICIAL REVIEW 

(1) 

As used in this rule: 

(a) 

"Agency" means any state agency whose decision is the subject of a 

 
petition for judicial review filed in the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals; or the Oregon 
State Bar or Board of Bar Examiners in a proceeding under ORAP 11.25, when the 
proceeding below included an evidentiary hearing. 

(b) 

"Agency record" means the record before the agency, including the agency 

 
file, exhibits offered and received (or the subject of an offer of proof), and the transcript 
of oral proceedings, or the shortened part of the record if the parties have so stipulated 
pursuant to ORS 183.482(4), regardless of whether the agency actually conducted a 
hearing. 

(c) 

 
represented by the same attorney or law firm. 

"Each party" may mean multiple parties if two or more parties are 

 
or other similar electronic medium if approved by the Administrator. 

"Electronic means" means optical disk1 or Secure File Transfer Protocol, 

(d) 

 
(e)  "Instructions" means the instructions, located on the Oregon Judicial 
Department website, for filing and serving the agency record via Secure File Transfer 
Protocol by electronic means.2 

 

(f) 

"SFTP" means Secure File Transfer Protocol. 

(2) 

Transmitting Agency Record to Appellate Court. The agency may transmit the 
agency record to the Administrator conventionally in paper form, by optical disk, or by Secure 
File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), as provided in this rule.  

(3) 

Preparation of the Record Generally 

(i) 

If a state agency has its own process for preparing the record, 
(a) 
including any transcript, for use by the agency or tribunal and the form of the 
record substantially complies with this rule, the agency may submit the record in 

45                                                             Chapter 4

that form, subject to this rule.  

(ii) 

 
As provided in ORS 656.298(6), the record on judicial review in a 
workers' compensation case includes the transcript prepared under ORS 656.295, 
all exhibits, and all decisions and orders entered during the hearing and review 
process.  

(b) 

Agency file.  The agency may prepare the agency file either with the first 
 
filed document on top (or in front) or the last filed document on top (or in front).  If the 
agency is submitting the record in paper form, the pages of the agency file and the 
exhibits must be consecutively numbered at the bottom of each page. 

 

(c) 

Exhibits. 

(i) 

Except as provided in this paragraph, the agency must transmit all 
 
exhibits offered and received, including any exhibit that is the subject of an offer 
of proof.  If the agency is transmitting the exhibits by electronic means, the 
agency must identify each disk or electronic file containing exhibits as provided 
in the Instructions. 

(ii) 

Except as provided in clause (iii) of this paragraph, if the exhibits 

 
include any nondocumentary exhibit, the agency must conventionally transmit the 
exhibit.  

(iii) 

If the exhibits include an audio or video recording on an optical 

 
disk, the agency must transmit the disk as part of the exhibits.  If the exhibits 
include one or more audio or video tape recordings, unless a party objects, the 
agency may copy the recording to an optical disk and transmit the optical disk in 
lieu of the tape recording.  A party may move the court to supplement the record 
on judicial review with a transcript of any audio or video recording, to be 
prepared at the party’s expense.  

(d) 

Transcript.  If the agency is submitting the record in paper form, the 

 
transcript must be prepared as provided in ORAP 3.35(1).  If the agency is submitting the 
record by electronic means, the agency must comply with ORAP 3.35(2)(a), (b), and (d). 

(e) 

Indexing.  The record must be indexed.  The index for the record must 

 
identify each document in the agency file, each volume of transcript, and each exhibit.  If 
the agency is transmitting the record by electronic means, each document identified in an 
index must be electronically linked to the document.  If the agency is transmitting the 
record by optical disk and the record requires more than one disk, the second and any 
subsequent disk must have a subindex of the documents on that disk, with electronic links 
to each document on the disk. 

(f) 

 
parties’ exhibits, and any transcript. 

The agency must assemble the record in this order:  The agency file, the 

46                                                             Chapter 4 

(g) 

If the agency is transmitting the record in paper form, the agency must 

 
securely fashion the index and record in a suitable cover or folder showing on the outside 
the case name and the agency name and case number.  If the agency is transmitting the 
record by electronic means, the agency must submit the record as provided in the 
Instructions. 

(4) 

Confidential and Sealed Documents 

(a) 

 
If the record contains a confidential or sealed document* as defined in 
ORAP 3.07, the agency must place the document in an envelope (if the record is being 
transmitted conventionally) or in a separate electronic file as provided in the Instructions 
(if the record is transmitted by electronic means).  If the record includes multiple 
confidential documents, the agency may place all confidential documents in the same 
envelope or electronic file.  If the agency record includes multiple sealed documents, the 
agency must place each sealed document in a separate envelope or electronic file. 

(b) 

An envelope containing a sealed or confidential document must indicate 

 
on the outside of the envelope the case name, the agency name and case number, and that 
it contains a sealed or confidential document.  An electronic file containing a sealed or 
confidential document must be labelled as provided in the Instructions. 

(c) 

If the agency is transmitting the record by optical disk, all confidential 

 
documents must be placed on a separate disk labelled as provided in the Instructions, and 
each sealed document must be transmitted by a separate disk.  If the agency is 
transmitting the record by SFTP, any sealed document must be transmitted by either 
optical disk or in paper form. 

(5) 

Transmitting the Record in Paper Form.  If the agency transmits and serves the 
record in paper form, the record must have a suitable cover or folder bearing on the outside the 
title and agency number of the case and the name of the agency from which the review is taken. 
Whenever feasible, the agency must submit the original record.  The agency’s transmission and 
service of the record in paper form qualifies as transmission of the record within the meaning of 
ORS 183.482(4). 

(6) 

Preparing and Transmitting the Record by Electronic Means. 

(a) 

 
prepare the record as provided in the Instructions.  

 If the agency transmits the record by electronic means, the agency must

(ii) 

Uploading the agency record to the Judicial Department’s SFTP 

 
site as provided in the Instructions, together with notification to the Administrator

Delivery of the record in optical disk form to the party; or 

(iii)  Uploading the record to the Judicial Department’s SFTP site as 

 
provided in the Instructions and providing notification to the other party that the 
upload is complete.  The record will remain on the SFTP site for 14 days to allow 
a party being served by SFTP to retrieve the record and copy it to a suitable 
location on the party’s computer. 

(7) 

Service Generally 

 
 (a)  On the same date the agency transmits the agency record to the 
Administrator, the agency must serve a copy of the record on each other party to the 
judicial review.  The agency may serve the party conventionally in paper form, by optical 
disk, or by Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), as provided in this subsection.    

(b) 

Service on Party Represented by Attorney.  If the agency transmits the 

 
record to the Administrator by optical disk or SFTP, the agency must serve a copy of the 
record on any party represented by an attorney, including an out-of-state attorney 
admitted pro hac vice, by the same means unless the attorney has made arrangements 
with the agency for service by other means.  

 

(c)  Service on Self-Represented Party.   

 

 

   

(i) 

The agency may serve the record on a self-represented party 

conventionally in paper form or by optical disk. 

 
(ii) 

 
(iii) 

The agency may serve the record on a self-represented party by 

 
SFTP, if the party has stated the party's willingness to be served by SFTP as 
provided in ORAP 4.15(1)(d) or if the agency otherwise has obtained the party’s 
consent to be served by SFTP.  

If the agency serves a self-represented party by optical disk or 

 
SFTP, the agency must notify the party that, if the party is unable to access the 
record, the party must notify the agency within 14 days of receipt, with contact 
information for the agency.3  If a party so notifies the agency, the agency must 
serve the record on the party conventionally in paper form within seven days.  

48                                                             Chapter 4 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

  

(d) 

If the record includes one or more confidential documents* as defined in 

 
ORAP 3.07, the agency must serve the parties with a copy of the confidential document.  
If the record includes one or more sealed documents as defined in ORAP 3.07, the 
agency must not serve a copy of the sealed document on the parties. 

(e) 

The agency must accompany the record as transmitted to the court with 

 
proof of service of the record on each party, stating the manner in which each party was 
served. 

(8) 

Transmitting and Serving Corrected or Additional Agency Record 

(a) 

The agency’s initial transmission of the record to the Administrator and 

 
service on the parties to a judicial review triggers the 15-day period under ORAP 4.22(1) 
to move to correct or add to the transcript or to correct the record other than the 
transcript. 

(b) 

 
The record is deemed settled upon exhaustion of the opportunity to move 
to correct or add to the transcript or to correct the record other than the transcript and to 
obtain appellate court review of the agency’s disposition of such a motion as provided in 
ORAP 4.22. 

(c) 

If the agency or the court corrects or adds to any part of the record, the 

 
agency must transmit to the Administrator and serve on the parties the corrected or 
additional part of the record by one of the methods prescribed in this rule.  

(d) 

 
determines that the record is settled. 

The Administrator will notify the parties when the Administrator 

(9)  Modified Record After Court Grants Leave to Present Additional Evidence 

If the appellate court grants a party’s motion under ORS 183.482(5) for leave to present 
additional evidence, following proceedings before the agency, the agency must transmit to the 
Administrator and serve on the parties any additional record by one of the methods prescribed in 
this rule. 

(10)  Disposition of Agency Record upon Issuance of Appellate Judgment 

(a) 

If the agency transmitted the record to the Administrator in paper form, 

 
unless the court directs otherwise, when the Administrator issues the appellate judgment, 
the Administrator will return the record to the agency.  

(b) 

If agency transmitted the record to the Administrator by electronic means, 

 
the Administrator issues the appellate judgment, the Administrator will not return the 
agency record to the agency.  The Administrator will retain the electronic record for at 
least six months; thereafter, unless the court grants a party’s request to retain the agency 
record longer, the Administrator may delete the record from computer storage. 

49                                                             Chapter 4

Rule 4.22 
CORRECTING THE RECORD ON JUDICIAL REVIEW 

Unless a statute prescribes a different procedure in particular cases, the record on direct 

judicial review of an agency order shall be corrected or added to as follows: 

(1)  Within 15 days after the agency files the record of agency proceedings, or such 

further time as may be allowed by the court, any party may file with the agency a motion: 
 

(a) 

 
of the proceedings transcribed, if the record includes a transcript. 

To correct any errors appearing in the transcript or to have additional parts 

(b) 

To correct the record, other than the transcript, by removing material 

 
appearing in the agency record as filed that was not made part of the record before the 
agency, or by adding material that was made part of the record before the agency but was 
omitted from the record as filed.  This paragraph does not authorize supplementing the 
record on judicial review with evidence that never was part of the record before the 
agency.1 

(2) 

The motion shall be captioned "Before the [name of agency to which the motion 
is directed]."  The party shall serve the court with a copy of the motion, which shall include on 
the title page the notation "Court Service Copy." 

(3) 

The agency shall file with the court a copy of its order disposing of the motion to 
correct the record or to correct or add to the transcript.  If the agency grants the motion in whole 
or in part, the agency shall serve on the adverse party or parties and file with the court a 
corrected record, a corrected transcript, or an additional transcript, as appropriate.  When the 
agency files a corrected record or transcript, in the discretion of the agency, the agency may 
serve and file only those pages as have been corrected.

The Court of Appeals considers the items set out below to be relevant to 

 
the decision whether to exercise its discretion to try the cause anew on the record or make 
one or more factual findings anew on the record.  These considerations, which are neither 
exclusive nor binding, are published to inform and assist the bar and the public. 

(i)  Whether the trial court made express factual findings, including 

 
demeanor-based credibility findings. 

(ii)  Whether the trial court's decision comports with its express factual 

 
findings or with uncontroverted evidence in the record. 

(iii)  Whether the trial court was specifically alerted to a disputed 
 
factual matter and the importance of that disputed factual matter to the trial court's 
ultimate disposition of the case or to the assignment(s) of error raised on appeal. 

(iv)  Whether the factual finding(s) that the appellant  requests the court 

 
find anew is important to the trial court's ruling that is at issue on appeal (i.e., 
whether an appellate determination of the facts in appellant's favor would likely 
provide a basis for reversing or modifying the trial court's ruling). 

(v)  Whether the trial court made an erroneous legal ruling, reversal or 

 
modification of which would substantially alter the admissible contents of the 
record (e.g., a ruling on the admissibility of evidence), and determination of 
factual issues on the altered record in the Court of Appeals, rather than remand to 
the trial court for reconsideration, would be judicially efficient. 

(9) 

A concise summary, without argument, of all the facts of the case material to 
determination of the appeal.  The summary shall be in narrative form with references to the 

69                                                             Chapter 5 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

places in the transcript, narrative statement, audio record, record, or excerpt where such facts 
appear. 

(10) 

In a dissolution proceeding or a proceeding involving modification of a 

dissolution judgment, the summary of facts shall begin with the date of the marriage, the ages of 
the parties, the ages of any minor children of the parties, the custody status of any minor 
children, the amount and terms of any spousal or child support ordered, and the party required to 
pay support. 

(11)  Any significant motion filed in the appeal and the disposition of the motion. A 
party need not file an amended brief to set forth any significant motion filed after that party's 
brief has been filed. 

(12)  Any other matters necessary to inform the court concerning the questions and 

contentions raised on the appeal, insofar as such matters are a part of the record, with reference 
to the parts of the record where such matters appear.

* See ORS 19.415(3)(b) regarding discretion of the Court of Appeals to try the cause de novo or

ORAP 5.45(5) concerning the identification of standards of review for each assignment of error 
on appeal. 

Rule 5.45 
ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR AND ARGUMENT 

(1) 

Assignments of error are required in all opening briefs of appellants and cross-

appellants. No matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was 
preserved in the lower court and is assigned as error in the opening brief in accordance with this 
rule, provided that the appellate court may, in its discretion, consider a plain error.1 

(2) 

Each assignment of error must be separately stated under a numbered heading. 

The arrangement and form of assignments of error, together with reference to pages of the 
record, should conform to the illustrations in Appendix 5.45. 

(3) 

Each assignment of error must identify precisely the legal, procedural, factual, or 

other ruling that is being challenged. 
 

(a) 

Each assignment of error must demonstrate that the question or issue 

(4) 
presented by the assignment of error timely and properly was raised and preserved in the 
lower court.  The court may decline to consider any assignment of error that requires the 
court to search the record to find the error or to determine if the error properly was raised 
and preserved.  Under the subheading "Preservation of Error": 

 

(i) 

Each assignment of error, as appropriate, must specify the stage in 

 

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

 

  _

70                                                             Chapter 5 

the proceedings when the question or issue presented by the assignment of error 
was raised in the lower court, the method or manner of raising it, and the way in 
which it was resolved or passed on by the lower court. 

(ii) 

Each assignment of error must set out pertinent quotations of the 

record where the question or issue was raised and the challenged ruling was made, 
together with reference to the pages of the transcript or other parts of the record 
quoted or to the excerpt of record if the material quoted is set out in the excerpt of 
record.  When the parts of the record relied on under this clause are lengthy, they 
must be included in the excerpt of record instead of the body of the brief. 

(iii) 

If an assignment of error challenges an evidentiary ruling, the 

assignment of error must quote or summarize the evidence that appellant believes 
was erroneously admitted or excluded.  If an assignment of error challenges the 
exclusion of evidence, appellant also must identify in the record where the trial 
court excluded the evidence and where the offer of proof was made; if an 
assignment of error challenges the admission of evidence, appellant also must 
identify where in the record the evidence was admitted. 

   

   

 
(b)  Where a party has requested that the court review a claimed error as plain 
error, the party must identify the precise error, specify the state of the proceedings when 
the error was made, and set forth pertinent quotations of the record where the challenged 
error was made. 
 
(5) 

Under the subheading "Standard of Review," each assignment of error must 

 
identify the applicable standard or standards of review, supported by citation to the statute, case 
law, or other legal authority for each standard of review.2 

(6) 

Each assignment of error must be followed by the argument.  If several 

assignments of error present essentially the same legal question, the argument in support of them 
may be combined so far as practicable. 

(7) 

The court may decline to exercise its discretion to consider plain error absent a 

request explaining the reasons that the court should consider the error.3 

________ 
1 For an error to be plain error, it must be an error of law, obvious and not reasonably in dispute, 
and apparent on the record without requiring the court to choose among competing inferences; in 
determining whether to exercise its discretion to consider an error that qualifies as a plain error, 
the court takes into account a non-exclusive list of factors, including the interests of the parties, 
the nature of the case, the gravity of the error, and the ends of justice in the particular case.  See 
State v. Vanornum, 354 Or 614, 629-30, 317 P3d 889 (2013).  See also ORS 138.257(2):  
"Subject to Article VII (Amended), section 3, Oregon Constitution, the appellate court shall not 
reverse, modify or vacate a trial court judgment or order if there is little likelihood that any error 
affected the outcome." 
 

71                                                             Chapter 5

2 Standards of review include but are not limited to de novo review and substantial evidence for 
factual issues, errors of law and abuse of discretion for legal issues, and special statutory 
standards of review such as those found in the Administrative Procedures Act, ORS 183.400(4), 
and ORS 183.482(7) and (8).  See also ORS 19.415(1), which provides that, generally, "upon an 
appeal in an action or proceeding, without regard to whether the action or proceeding was triable 
to the court or a jury," the court's review "shall be as provided in section 3, Article VII 
(Amended) of the Oregon Constitution"; ORS 19.415(3)(b) regarding discretion of the Court of 
Appeals to try the cause de novo  or make one or more factual findings anew on appeal in some 
equitable proceedings; see also ORAP 5.40(8) concerning appellant's request for the court to 
exercise de novo review and providing a list of nonexclusive items Court of Appeals may 
consider in deciding whether to exercise its discretion. 

 See State v. Tilden, 252 Or App 581, 587-94, 288 P3d 567 (2012) (discussing cases in which 
Court of Appeals declined to review for plain error absent a request from the appellant). 

Rule 5.50 
THE EXCERPT OF RECORD 

(1) 

Except in the case of a self-represented party, the appellant must include in the 

opening brief an excerpt of record.1  The parties to an appeal are encouraged to confer regarding 
the content of the excerpt of record, including whether to file a joint excerpt of record to be 
included in the opening brief. 

(2) 

The excerpt of record must contain:2 

 

(a) 

The judgment or order on appeal or judicial review.  

(b) 

 
issues presented by the assignments of error. 

Any written or oral rulings by the lower tribunal or agency addressing the 

(c) 

Any pleading or excerpt of pleadings, particular part of the transcript, 

 
exhibit, evidentiary submission and other filing necessary for reviewing and 
understanding the assignments of error in advance of oral argument, if the parties 
anticipate that the case will be orally argued.3 

(d) 

 
memoranda and the transcript pertinent to the issue of preservation presented by the case. 

If preservation of error is or is likely to be disputed in the case, parts of 

(e) 

 
in an Oregon circuit court. 

A copy of the eCourt Case Information register of actions, if the case arose 

(f) 

In criminal cases in which the defendant appealed after entering a 

 
conditional plea of guilty or no contest under ORS 135.335(3), the defendant must 
include in the excerpt of record the writing in which the defendant reserved for review on 
appeal the trial court's adverse determination of a pretrial motion.

(3) 

The excerpt of record must not contain memoranda of law filed in the trial court 
unless such memoranda are pertinent to a disputed or likely to be disputed issue of preservation. 

(4) 

A respondent may file, as part of the respondent's brief, a supplemental excerpt of 

record containing those materials required by subsection (2) of this rule that were omitted from 
the excerpt of record. 

The excerpt of record and any supplemental excerpt of record must be in the 

(5) 
following form: 
 

(b) 

Contents must be set forth in chronological order, except that the OECI 
case register must be the last document in the excerpt of record.  The excerpt must be 
consecutively paginated, with the first page being page ER-1.  The excerpt must begin 
with an index organized chronologically, describing each item and identifying where the 
item may be found in the trial court or agency record, and the page where the item may 
be found in the excerpt.  The index may include bookmarks as described in ORAP 16.50.  
A supplemental excerpt of record must substantially conform to the same requirements, 
except that a supplemental excerpt must be paginated using "SER," e.g., SER-1, SER-2, 
SER-3. 

(c) 

The materials included must be reproduced on 8-1/2 x 11 inch white paper 

by any duplicating or copying process that produces a clear, black, legible image. 

(d) 

The excerpt of record must comply with the applicable requirements of 

ORAP 5.05. 

   

   

   

(a) 

All documents or parts of documents must be copies of documents 
 
included in the record, rather than summarized or paraphrased.  Omissions, if not 
apparent, must be noted.  No matter may be omitted if to do so would change the 
meaning of the matter included. 

(6) 

Self-represented parties are not required to file an excerpt of record or a 

supplemental excerpt of record.  If a self-represented party files an excerpt of record or a 
supplemental excerpt of record, it must contain only those documents specified in ORAP 
5.50(2)(a) and (b), must contain no other documents, and must otherwise comply with this rule.4 

(7) 

The appellate court may strike any excerpt of record or supplemental excerpt of 

record that does not substantially comply with the requirements of this rule. 
_________ 
1 Any brief containing an excerpt of record filed through the eFiling system that exceeds 25 
megabytes must be filed in compliance with ORAP 16.15(1). 

 For other requirements for the excerpt of record in Land Use Board of Appeals cases, see 
ORAP 4.67.

3 See Appendix 5.50, which sets forth examples of documents that a party should consider 
including in the excerpt of record depending on the nature of the issues raised in the briefs.  The 
full record is available and used by the court after submission of a case; therefore, the excerpt of 
record need include only those parts of the record that will be helpful to the court and the parties 
in preparing for and conducting oral argument. 

 Under ORAP 6.05(2), cases in which a self-represented party files a brief are submitted without 
argument by any party.  For that reason, any excerpt or supplemental excerpt of record submitted 
by a self-represented party shall not contain any of the documents otherwise required by ORAP 
5.50(2)(c) to (f) to assist the appellate court in preparing for oral argument. 

Rule 5.52 
APPENDIX 

The purpose of an appendix to a brief is to provide, for the convenience of the reader, 

materials that would be helpful in understanding and resolving an issue raised on appeal. A party 
appropriately may include in an appendix, for instance, copies of a statute or statutes at issue in 
the appeal, or copies of cases that are not readily available from standard research sources. A 
party should not include in the appendix materials from the record of the tribunal from which the 
appeal is taken that should be in the excerpt of record.1

so by these rules or by order of the court. 

(7) 

In cases in which the appellant is represented in the Court of Appeals by the 

Office of Public Defense Services, the appellant's opening brief shall be served within a period 
of time established by the Chief Judge in consultation with Office of Public Defense Services. 

(8) 

In complex cases, such as cases with multiple parties, multiple appeals or cross-
appeals, or both, the parties are encouraged to confer to develop a briefing schedule that varies 
from the schedule that would otherwise result under this rule but that will present the parties' 
positions in an orderly manner and to file a motion seeking approval of that suggested briefing 
schedule.

Rule 5.90 
"BALFOUR" BRIEFS FILED 
BY COURT-APPOINTED COUNSEL 

(1) 

If counsel appointed by the court to represent an indigent defendant in a criminal 

case on direct appeal has thoroughly reviewed the record, has discussed the case with trial 
counsel and the client, and has determined that the case does not raise any arguably meritorious 
issues, counsel shall file an opening brief with two sections: 
 

(a) 

Section A of the brief shall contain: 

(i) 

A statement of the case, including a statement of the facts of the 

 
case. If the brief contains a Section B with one or more claims of error asserted by 
the client, the statement of facts shall include facts sufficient to put the claim or 
claims of error in context. 

(ii) 

A description of any demurrer or significant motion filed in the 

 
case, including, but not limited to, a motion to dismiss, a motion to suppress and a 
motion in limine, and the trial court's disposition of the demurrer or motion. 

 
(iii)  A statement that the case is being submitted pursuant to this rule, 
that counsel has thoroughly reviewed the record and discussed the case with trial 
counsel and the client, and that counsel has not identified any arguably 
meritorious issue on appeal.  If the brief does not contain a Section B, counsel 
also shall state that counsel contacted the client, gave the client reasonable 
opportunity to identify a claim or claims of error, and that the client did not 
identify any claim of error for inclusion in the brief. 

(iv)  Counsel's signature. 

   

(i) 

Section B of the brief is the client's product and may contain any 

(b) 
claim of error that the client wishes to assert.  The client shall attempt to state the 
claim and any argument in support of the claim as nearly as practicable in proper 
appellate brief form.  Section B of the brief shall not exceed 48 pages in length.  
The last page of Section B of the brief shall contain the name and signature of the 
client. 

(ii) 

 
Counsel's obligation with respect to Section B of the brief shall be 
limited to correcting obvious typographical errors, preparing copies of the brief, 
serving the appropriate parties, and filing the original brief and the appropriate 
number of copies with the court. 

(2) 

A case in which appellant's opening brief is prepared and filed under this rule 

shall be submitted without oral argument, unless otherwise ordered by the court. 

(3) 

On reviewing the record and the briefs filed by the parties, if the court identifies 

83                                                             Chapter 5 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

   

   

one or more arguably meritorious issues in the case, the court shall notify appellant's counsel of 
the issue or issues so identified.  Appellant's counsel shall have 28 days after the date of the 
court's notice to file a supplemental opening brief addressing those issues.  In addition to 
addressing the issue or issues identified by the court, counsel may address any other arguably 
meritorious issue counsel has identified. Respondent shall have 28 days after appellant files a 
supplemental opening brief to file a response or supplemental answering brief addressing the 
issues raised in the supplemental opening brief. 

(4) 

In a case other than a criminal case on direct appeal, court-appointed counsel who 

determines that there are no meritorious issues on appeal may submit a brief under this rule, in 
which case the matter will be submitted without oral argument, unless otherwise ordered by the 
court. 

(5) 

In any case in which the appellant is represented by court-appointed counsel on 

appeal and counsel filed a brief in the Court of Appeals under subsection (1) of this rule, counsel 
may submit a petition for review that contains a Section A that complies with ORAP 9.05(3)(a) 
and a Section B that complies with paragraph (1)(b) of this rule.

Rule 5.92 
SUPPLEMENTAL PRO SE BRIEFS 
 
(1)  When a client is represented by court-appointed counsel and the client is 
 
dissatisfied with the brief that counsel has filed, within 28 days after the filing of the brief, either 
the client or counsel may move the court for leave to file a supplemental pro se brief.1  If the 
client files the motion, in addition to serving all other parties to the case, the client shall serve 
counsel with a copy of the motion.  If counsel files the motion, in addition to serving all other 
parties to the case, counsel shall serve the client with a copy of the motion.  Whoever files the 
motion may tender the proposed supplemental pro se brief along with the motion. 

(2) 

The client shall attempt to prepare a supplemental pro se brief as nearly as 

practicable in proper appellate brief form.  The brief shall identify questions or issues to be 
decided on appeal as assignments of error identifying precisely the legal, procedural, factual, or 
other ruling that is being challenged.2  The last page of the brief shall contain the name and 
signature of the client. Unless the court orders otherwise, the statement of the case, including the 
statement of facts, and the argument together shall be limited to five pages. 

(3)  

If the supplemental pro se brief includes an excerpt of record, the excerpt must 

contain only the information included in ORAP 5.50(2),3 and only if that material is not included 
in the appellant's opening brief. If the supplemental pro se brief includes an appendix, it must 
comply with the appendix rules in ORAP 5.52 and shall not contain any confidential material.

(4) 

A supplemental pro se brief is the client's product; therefore, if the client requests 

 
assistance in preparing the brief, counsel's obligation shall be limited to correcting obvious 
typographical errors, preparing copies of the brief, serving the appropriate parties, and filing the 
original brief with the court.  If the client prepares and files the brief without the assistance of 
counsel, in addition to serving all other parties to the appeal, the client shall serve a copy of the 
brief on counsel. 

________ 
1 "Pro se" means "for oneself" or "on one's own behalf."  A supplemental pro se brief is the 
product of the party himself or herself, and not of the attorney representing the party. 

 See ORAP 5.45, which describes requirements for assignments of error and argument. 

 See ORAP 5.50(2) (indicating that an excerpt of record must contain "[t]he judgment or order 
on appeal or judicial review" and "[a]ny written or oral rulings by the lower tribunal or agency 
addressing the issues presented by the assignments of error"). 

Rule 5.95 
BRIEFS CONTAINING CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL 
 

(1) 

Except as provided in subsection (6) of this rule, if a brief contains material that 

 
is, by statute or court order, confidential or exempt from disclosure,1 the party submitting the 
brief shall file two original briefs: 
 

(a) 

One brief shall contain the material that is confidential or exempt from 

 
disclosure. The title page of the brief shall contain in or under the case caption the words 
"CONFIDENTIAL BRIEF UNDER ______" followed by the statutory citation or a 
description of the court order under which confidentiality is claimed.*  The original of 
the brief shall be placed in a sealed envelope marked "CONFIDENTIAL BRIEF." 

(b) 

One brief shall have the material that is confidential or exempt from 

 
disclosure removed or marked out. The title page of the brief shall contain in or under the 
case caption the words "REDACTED BRIEF UNDER ______" followed by the statutory 
citation or a description of the court order under which confidentiality is claimed.* 

(2) 

A party filing a brief under this rule shall serve two copies of the confidential 
brief and two copies of the redacted brief on each other party to the case on appeal or review. 

(3) 

The Administrator shall keep both original briefs in the appellate file for the case. 

The Administrator shall make the redacted version of the brief available for public inspection 
and copying. 
 

(a) 

On motion of a person, the court shall make available for public inspection 
(4) 
and copying a confidential brief based on a showing that the brief does not contain matter 
that is confidential or exempt from disclosure.

(b) 

 
On motion of a person and under such conditions as the court may deem 
appropriate, the court may authorize inspection or copying of a confidential brief based 
on a showing that the person is entitled as a matter of law to inspect or copy the material 
that is confidential or exempt from disclosure. 

(5)  When the appellate judgment issues terminating a case, the Administrator shall 

distribute to brief storage facilities only the redacted copies of a brief filed under paragraph 
(1)(b) of this rule. 

(6) 

Briefs in the following categories of cases are entirely confidential, and so are 

exempt from the requirements of subsections (1) to (5) of this rule:  adoption, juvenile 
dependency (including termination of parental rights), juvenile delinquency, civil commitment of 
allegedly mentally ill persons and persons with an intellectual or developmental disability (as 
those terms are defined in ORS 427.005), and appeals from orders of the Psychiatric Security 
Review Board and State Hospital Review Panel.  Parties filing in the Court of Appeals briefs in 
those categories of cases must comply with ORAP 5.05(5) regarding the original and number of 
copies to be served on other parties to the case.

6.  SUBMISSION OF CASES 
AND ORAL ARGUMENT; 
RECONSIDERATION IN COURT OF APPEALS 
 
Rule 6.05 
REQUEST FOR ORAL ARGUMENT; 
SUBMISSION WITHOUT ARGUMENT 

(a) 

The Administrator will send the parties notice of the date that a case is 

2) 
scheduled to be submitted to the court ("the submission date").  Parties to the case may 
request oral argument by filing a "Request for Oral Argument" in the form illustrated in 
Appendix 6.05 and directed to the attention of the court's calendar clerk.  If a party files a 
timely request for oral argument, the case will be argued on the submission date and all 
parties who have filed a brief may argue.  If no party files a timely request for oral 
argument, the case shall be submitted on the briefs on the submission date without oral 
argument, unless the court directs otherwise. 

(b) 

A party wanting oral argument must file the request for oral argument and 

serve it on every other party to the appeal within the number of days specified in this 
subsection after the date the notice from the Administrator: 

  (

   

(1) 

This rule applies to proceedings in the Court of Appeals. 

(i) 

On appeal in juvenile dependency (including termination of 

 
parental rights) and adoption cases within the meaning of ORAP 10.15, and on 
judicial review in land use cases as defined in ORAP 4.60(1)(b), 14 days after the 
date of the notice; 

(ii) 

In all other cases, 28 days after the date of the notice. 

   

(3) 

Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this rule, if a self-represented party files a brief, 

the case will be submitted without argument by any party.  An attorney representing himself or 
herself is not considered to be a self-represented party for the purpose of this rule. 

(4) 

Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this rule, when a respondent submits an 

answering brief confessing error as to all assignments of error and not objecting to the relief 
sought in the opening brief, the respondent shall so inform the court by letter when the brief is 
filed or at any time thereafter. On receipt of respondent's notice that a brief confesses error, the 
case will be submitted without oral argument. The appellant may by letter bring to the court's 
attention that a respondent's brief appears to confess error. If the court concurs, the case will be 
submitted without oral argument.

Rule 6.10 
WHO MAY ARGUE; 
FAILURE TO APPEAR AT ARGUMENT 

(1) 

A party may present oral argument only if the party has filed a brief. 

(2) 

An amicus curiae may present oral argument only if permitted by the court on 

motion or on its own motion. 

(3) 

An attorney who was a witness for a party, except as to merely formal matters 
such as attestation or custody of an instrument, shall not argue the cause without leave of the 
court. 

(4) 

Only active members of the Oregon State Bar shall argue unless the court, on 

motion filed not less than 21 days before the date for argument orders otherwise.  If the court has 
allowed a lawyer from another jurisdiction to appear on appeal for a particular case under ORAP 
8.10(4), the lawyer does not need leave of the court to participate in oral argument of the case. 
 

(a) 

After any party has filed and served a request for oral argument pursuant 

(5) 
to ORAP 6.05(2), any party who decides to waive oral argument or cannot attend oral 
argument shall give the court and all other parties participating in oral argument at least 
48 hours' notice that the party will not be appearing for oral argument. 

(b) 

If a party fails to appear at oral argument, the court may deem the cause 

 
submitted without oral argument as to that party.  A party's failure to appear shall not 
preclude oral argument by any other party. 

(c) 

If a party fails to give at least 48 hours' notice of nonappearance at 

 
argument, the court may order counsel for that party to pay the costs and attorney fees 
that reasonably would have been incurred but for failure to give timely notice of 
nonappearance. 

Rule 6.15 
PROCEDURE AT ORAL ARGUMENT 

(1) 

In all cases in the Supreme Court: 

 

(a) 

The appellant, petitioner, or petitioner on review shall have not more than 

 
30 minutes to argue; and the respondent or respondent on review shall have not more 
than 30 minutes to argue. 

(b) 

 
reserve not more than 10 minutes of the time allowed for argument in which to reply. 

The appellant, petitioner, or petitioner on review shall argue first and may 

 

(c) 

If there are two or more parties on one side, they shall divide their allotted 

89                                                             Chapter 6 

 

   

   

   

   

 

 

   

   

 

 

 

time among themselves, unless the court orders otherwise. 

(a) 

Unless the court otherwise orders, on oral argument in the Court of 

(2) 
Appeals in all cases the appellant or petitioner shall have not more than 15 minutes and 
the respondent shall have not more than 15 minutes to argue. 

(b) 

 
time allowed for argument in which to reply. 

The appellant or petitioner may reserve not more than five minutes of the 

(3) 

A motion for additional time for argument shall be filed at least seven days before 

the time set for argument. 

(4) 

No point raised by a party's brief shall be deemed waived by the party's failure to 

present that point in oral argument. 

(5) 

For the purpose of this rule, a cross-appellant shall be deemed a respondent. 

(6) 

It is the general policy of Oregon appellate courts to prohibit reference at oral 

argument to any authority not cited either in a brief or in a pre-argument memorandum of 
additional authorities.1  If a party intends to refer in oral argument to an authority not previously 
cited, counsel shall inform the court at the time of argument and shall make a good faith effort to 
inform opposing counsel of the authority at the earliest practicable time.  The court may, in its 
discretion, permit reference at argument to that authority and may give other parties leave to file 
a post-argument memorandum of additional authorities or a memorandum in response. 

(7) 

If counsel desires to have present at oral argument an exhibit that has been 

retained by the trial court, it is counsel's responsibility to arrange to have the exhibit transmitted 
to the appellate court.2 

________ 
1 See ORAP 5.85 regarding memoranda of additional authorities. 

 See ORAP 3.25 regarding arranging to have exhibits transmitted to the appellate court. 

Rule 6.20 
ARGUMENT IN SALEM AND OTHER LOCATIONS 
 

The Court of Appeals will set most cases for oral argument in Salem, but, pursuant to 

 
Chief Justice Order 98-007, dated January 12, 1998, the court may set cases for oral argument in 
other locations throughout the state.

Rule 6.25 
RECONSIDERATION BY COURT OF APPEALS 
 

(1) 

As used in this rule, "decision" means an opinion, per curiam opinion, affirmance 

 
without opinion, and an order ruling on a motion or an own motion matter that disposes of the 
appeal.  A party seeking reconsideration of a decision of the Court of Appeals shall file a petition 
for reconsideration.  A petition for reconsideration shall be based on one or more of these 
contentions: 
 

 

(a) 

A claim of factual error in the decision; 

(b) 

A claim of error in the procedural disposition of the appeal requiring 

 
correction or clarification to make the disposition consistent with the holding or rationale 
of the decision or the posture of the case below; 

(c) 

A claim of error in the designation of the prevailing party or award of 

 
costs; 

(d) 

 
decision of the Court of Appeals; or 

A claim that there has been a change in the statutes or case law since the 

(e) 

A claim that the Court of Appeals erred in construing or applying the law. 

 
Claims addressing legal issues already argued in the parties' briefs and addressed by the 
Court of Appeals are disfavored. 

(2) 

A petition for reconsideration shall be filed within 14 days after the decision.  The 
petition shall have attached to it a copy of the decision for which reconsideration is sought.  The 
form of the petition and the manner in which it is served and filed shall be the same as for 
motions generally, except that the petition shall have a title page printed on plain white paper and 
containing the following information: 
 

(a) 

The full case caption, including appropriate party designations for the 

 
parties as they appeared in the court from which the appeal was taken and as they appear 
on appeal, and the trial and appellate court case numbers; and 

(b) 

 
Petition for Reconsideration" or "Respondent's Petition for Reconsideration." 

A title designating the party filing the petition, such as "Appellant's 

(3) 

The filing of a petition for reconsideration is not necessary to exhaust remedies or 

as a prerequisite to filing a petition for review. 

(4) 

If a response to a petition for reconsideration is filed, the response shall be filed

consider a petition for reconsideration without awaiting the filing of a response, but will consider 
a response if one is filed before the petition for reconsideration is considered and decided.1

7.  MOTIONS 
 
Rule 7.05 
MOTIONS IN GENERAL 

(a) 

(1) 
request for an order or other relief must be made by filing a motion in writing. 

Unless a statute or these rules provide another form of application, a 

(b) 

 
any of the requirements of a statute or these rules must do so by motion. 

A party seeking to challenge the failure of another party to comply with 

(c) 

 
motion at any time during the appellate process. 

A party may raise an issue of the jurisdiction of the appellate court by 

(d) 

Other than a first motion for an extension of time of 28 days or less to file 
 
a brief, a motion must contain a statement whether opposing counsel objects to, concurs 
in, or has no position regarding the motion.  If opposing counsel objects to the motion, 
the motion must include a statement whether opposing counsel intends to file a response 
to the motion. If the moving party has not been able to learn opposing counsel's position 
on the motion, then the motion must so state. 

(a) 

Generally, a party seeking relief in a case pending on appeal should file 

(2) 
the motion in the court in which the case is pending.1  A party seeking relief from a court 
other than the court in which the case is pending must, on the first page of the motion, 
separately and conspicuously state that the party is seeking relief from a court other than 
the court in which the case is pending. 

(b) 

 
A case is considered filed in the Supreme Court if the motion is captioned 
"In the Supreme Court of the State of Oregon" and in the Court of Appeals if the motion 
is captioned "In the Court of Appeals of the State of Oregon."  Notwithstanding the 
caption, the Administrator has the authority to file a motion in the appropriate court, 
provided that the Administrator must give notice thereof to the parties. 

(3) 

Any party may, within 14 days after the filing of a motion, file a response.2  The 

court may shorten the time for filing a response and may grant temporary relief pending the 
filing of a response, as circumstances may require. 

(4) 

The moving party may, within seven days after the filing of a response, file a 

reply.  The filing of a reply is discouraged; a reply should not merely restate argument made in 
the motion, and should be confined to new matter raised in the response. 

(5) 
argument. 

Unless the court directs otherwise, all motions will be considered without oral 

(6) 

Parties must be referred to by their designation in the appellate court.  Hyphenated 

designations are discouraged.  However, in motions in domestic relations cases, parties must be

(a) 

For a motion other than a motion for extension of time, a title designating 

1) 
the party filing the motion and one of the motion titles listed in the "Motion Titles" 
section of Appendix 7.10-1.1  For example, the motion of a respondent on appeal to 
dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction should be titled "Respondent's Motion–Dismiss 
- Non-Appellant/Non-Petitioner" and the motion of the state for summary affirmance 
should be titled "Respondent's Motion–Summary Affirmance."  If more than one motion 
is contained in a single document, the title of each motion shall be listed.  If none of the 
motion titles listed in Appendix 7.10-1 fairly describes the motion, select the title option 
of "Motion–Other" and add a title that accurately describes the motion.  "Motion–Other" 
should be used only in circumstances in which the party has carefully reviewed the 
motion titles listed in Appendix 7.10-1 and does not find a title that describes the motion; 
or 

 

(i) 

(b) 
For a motion for extension of time (MOET), a title designating the 
party filing the motion for extension of time and one of the MOET titles listed in 
the "Motions for Extension of Time (MOET)" section of Appendix 7.10-1.  For 
example, the motion of an appellant for an extension of time to file the opening 
brief should be titled "Appellant's MOET–File Opening Brief."  If more than one 
motion for extension of time is contained in a single document, or if a motion for 
extension of time is contained in a single document with another motion, the title 
of each MOET and/or motion shall be listed.  If none of the MOET titles listed in 
Appendix 7.10-1 fairly describes the motion for extension of time, select the title 
option of "MOET–Other" and add a title that accurately describes the motion.  
"MOET–Other" should be used only in circumstances in which the party has 
carefully reviewed the MOET titles listed in Appendix 7.10-1 and does not find a 
title that describes the motion for extension of time; or 

(ii) 

For a response to a motion or motion for extension of time 

 
(MOET), an indication that the filing is a response using the title of the motion or 
MOET to which the filing responds.  For example, the response to a respondent's 
motion for summary affirmance should be titled "Response to Respondent's 
Motion–Summary Affirmance" and the response to an appellant's motion for 
extension of time to file the opening brief should be titled "Response to

Appellant's MOET–File Opening Brief." 

(2) 

A motion or response, excluding appendices or exhibits, longer than 20 pages 

shall contain an index of contents, an index of appendices or exhibits, and an index of 
authorities, each with page references.2 

(3) 

Any party filing a motion to dismiss before the transcript has been filed shall 
serve a copy of the motion on the transcript coordinator and, if known to the party filing the 
motion to dismiss, all court reporters and transcribers who are responsible for preparing all or 
any part of the transcript on appeal. 

(4) 

If a party files a motion for leave to file another document and submits the other 

document with the motion, then: 
 

(a) 

 
relates back to the date of filing for the motion; or 

if the court grants the motion, the date of filing for the other document 

(b) 

if the court denies the motion, the court will strike the other document. 

A motion or response that is confidential, filed under seal, or otherwise exempt 

 
from disclosure3 must include:

in the motion or response, a statement citing the authority by which the 

motion is deemed confidential, sealed, or otherwise exempt from disclosure.

A motion or response that includes an attachment consisting of material that is 

 
confidential, sealed, or otherwise exempt from disclosure4 must comply with the requirements of 
ORAP 8.52.

characterizing a motion in their case management system and in displaying a case register that 
more clearly indicates the filing and resolution of the motion.

Rule 7.15 
DECISIONS ON MOTIONS 

(1) 

The Chief Justice or the Chief Judge, except as otherwise provided in ORAP 7.55, 

may determine any motion made before submission of a case to the court or after the date of the 
decision or may refer the motion to any other judge or judges of the court for decision.1 

(2) 

Any motion filed after submission of a case, but before decision, shall be decided 
by the court or, in the Court of Appeals, may be decided by the department to which the case has 
been submitted. 

(3) 

If any motion other than a challenge to the court's jurisdiction is denied before 

submission of the case, the motion may not be resubmitted without leave of the court in the order 
on the motion. 

(4) 

Except for a ruling on an oral motion for extension of time under ORAP 7.27, the 

court will rule on a motion by written order. 

________

to decide motions and own motion matters in that court. 

Rule 7.25 
MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME 

(1) 

Only the appellate court may grant an extension of time for the performance of 

any act pertaining to an appeal. 

(2) 

A motion for an extension of time shall contain: 

(a) 

The date the notice of appeal was filed (or in the case of a petition for 

 
review, the date of the decision of the Court of Appeals for which review is being 
sought); 

 

 

(b) 

The date the brief or other action is due; 

(c)

(e) 

 
the allotted time; and 

The specific circumstances which caused the act not to be completed in 

(f) 

In a criminal case, whether the defendant is incarcerated. 

 

 

(3) 

An objection to a motion for extension of time shall articulate specific grounds for 

the objection and shall identify how an extension of time will prejudice the objector's interest. 
An attorney may object on the ground that the client has instructed counsel to object to any 
extension, but that alone will not be a sufficient ground to deny or reduce any extension of time. 

(4) 

An objection to a request for an extension of time may be filed by facsimile 

transmission,1 provided that the objection does not exceed five pages.  Filing shall be deemed 
complete when the entirety of the objection being transmitted has been received by the 
Administrator.  The facsimile transmission shall have the same force and effect as filing of the 
original. 

(5) 

A motion for an extension of time generally will be decided within a few days 

after it is filed.  An objection to a motion for an extension of time filed after the court has granted 
the extension will be treated as a motion for reconsideration of the ruling.  On reconsideration, if 
the court modifies the extension of time, the parties to the appeal will be notified; otherwise, the 
objection will be noted and placed in the appellate file. 

(6) 

Requests for extensions of time for preparation of transcripts shall be made in 

accordance with ORAP 3.30.

Rule 7.27 
ORAL REQUEST FOR EXTENSION OF 
TIME TO FILE BRIEF 

(1) 

For good cause shown, the Administrator may grant an oral request for an 

extension of time of no more than 14 days to file an opening, answering, or reply brief, provided 
that: 
 

(a) 

The party making the request for an extension of time under this rule shall 

 
give prior notice to the other parties to the appeal, except that such notice need not be 
given to a person confined in a state institution and not represented by counsel; and

A party may request an oral extension of time under this rule, and the 

Administrator may grant or deny the motion, by telephone. 

(3) 

The Administrator acting on an oral request for an extension of time shall enter 

the grant or denial of the request in the appellate case register. 

(4) 

The grant of an extension of time under this rule will bar any further motion for 

time to file the brief unless such motion, made in writing, demonstrates extraordinary and 
compelling circumstances. 

Rule 7.30 
MOTIONS THAT TOLL TIME 

(1) 

Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this rule or if the court 

otherwise orders, any motion that must be ruled on before the next event in the appellate process 
occurs, including but not necessarily limited to a motion to hold the appeal in abeyance, a motion 
to amend a designation of record, to dismiss, to determine jurisdiction, for summary affirmance 
under ORS 34.712, ORS 138.225, or ORS 138.660, to remand, to strike a brief, to supplement  
the record, or for leave to present additional evidence under ORS 183.482(5),1 tolls the time for 
the next event in the appellate process as established in these rules, until the court disposes of the 
motion.  The motions listed in this rule do not toll the running of any period of time established 
by statute. 

(2) 

If the court has ordered that no further extensions of time will be granted, no 

motion tolls the time for the next event in the appellate process as established in these rules.  A 
party may move for relief from a no-further-extensions-of-time order based on a showing of 
extraordinary and compelling circumstances; any such motion must include in its title the 
notation "RELIEF FROM NONTOLLING REQUESTED."

Rule 7.35 
MOTIONS SEEKING EMERGENCY RELIEF 

(1) 

If a party files a motion for substantive relief and requires relief in less than 21 

days, the party shall include in the caption of the motion a statement that the motion is an 
"EMERGENCY MOTION UNDER ORAP 7.35."  The motion should explain in the first 
paragraph the reason for the emergency and identify any deadline for action by the court. 
 

 

 

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

(2) 

Before filing the motion, the movant shall make a good faith effort to notify the 

 
opposing counsel or opposing party, if the party is not represented by counsel.  The motion shall 
state whether the other party has been notified and served. 

(3) 

A motion seeking emergency relief, other than a motion for an extension of time, 

and any response to a motion seeking emergency relief may be served and filed by telephonic  
facsimile communication device,1 provided that the material being transmitted does not exceed 
10 pages and subject to the following conditions: 
 

(a) 

Filing shall not be deemed complete until the entirety of the motion or 

 
response being transmitted has been received by the Administrator, but, as so filed, the 
facsimile transmission shall have the same force and effect as filing of the original. 

(b) 

The party or attorney being served maintains a telephonic facsimile 

 
communication device at the party's address or at the attorney's office and the device is 
operating at the time service is made.  The proof of service shall contain the facsimile 
number of any party or attorney served by facsimile transmission.2

Rule 7.40 
DISMISSAL OF APPEAL FOR LACK OF AN 
UNDERTAKING FOR COSTS ON APPEAL 

(1) 

A motion to dismiss an appeal for lack of an undertaking for costs on appeal shall 

not be filed without at least seven days' notice to the appellant.1  Notice may be written or oral. 
The notice shall not be filed with the court. 

(2) 

A motion to dismiss an appeal for lack of an undertaking for costs on appeal shall 
state that the movant has given the notice required by subsection (1) of this rule or explain why it 
has not. If written notice was given, a copy of the notice shall be attached to the motion. 

(3) 

The filing of an undertaking in response to a motion to dismiss shall not, in and of 

itself, be a sufficient response to the motion.  Appellant shall file an answer to the motion 
explaining whether there was good cause for the failure to comply with the notice or the statutory 
deadline for filing and shall append a copy of the undertaking filed in the trial court. 

(4) 

The movant may, but is not required to, assert that the movant has been 

prejudiced by appellant's failure to file timely an undertaking for costs on appeal.  If, however, 
the motion is based on an assertion that appellant's failure to meet the statutory filing deadline  
should result in dismissal, even though appellant complied with a later filing deadline stated in 
the notice provided under subsection (1) of this rule, the movant must establish that substantial

MOTIONS ARISING FROM SETTLEMENT, 
MEDIATION, OR ARBITRATION 

(1) 

If a party files a motion to dismiss an appeal filed by that party, or files a response 

to such a motion, and the motion is the result of a negotiated settlement or compromise, the 
motion or response shall so state. 

(2) 

If a party files a motion to dismiss or to determine jurisdiction arising from an 

arbitration or mediation required or offered by a court, or files a response to such a motion, the 
caption of the motion or response shall so state. 

Rule 7.50 
MOTION FOR SUMMARY AFFIRMANCE IN 
COURT-APPOINTED COUNSEL CASES 

(1) 

Except as provided otherwise by statute,1 in any case in which one of the parties is 

represented by court-appointed counsel,2 the court on motion of the respondent may summarily 
affirm the judgment if the court concludes, after submission of the appellant's opening brief and 
without submission of the respondent's answering brief, that the appeal does not present a 
substantial question of law.  The Chief Judge may deny a motion for summary affirmance and 
may grant an unopposed motion for summary affirmance.  Only the court may grant, in the 
manner provided by ORS 2.570, a motion for summary affirmance to which the appellant has 
filed written opposition.  A summary affirmance under this rule constitutes a decision on the 
merits of the appeal. 

(2) 

If a motion for summary affirmance is filed under ORS 138.225, ORS 138.660, or 
ORS 34.712, or subsection (1) of this rule and counsel has filed a Balfour brief under ORAP 5.90 
with a Section B or, with leave of the court, counsel's client has filed a supplemental pro se 
brief,3 counsel forthwith shall forward a copy of the motion for summary affirmance to the 
client.  The client shall have 35 days after the date the motion for summary affirmance was filed 
to file an answer to the motion.

(1) 

Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this rule, the appellate 

commissioner for the Court of Appeals is delegated concurrent authority to decide motions and 
own motion matters that otherwise may be decided by the Chief Judge under ORS 2.570(6).1  
The appellate commissioner is delegated concurrent authority to decide any other matter that the 
Court of Appeals or Chief Judge lawfully may delegate for decision. 

(2) 

The appellate commissioner does not have authority to decide a motion that 

would result in the disposition of a case on its merits, except as to:

relief granted is consistent with the relief sought in the motion. 

A joint or stipulated motion for a disposition on the merits, where the

could decide the motion under ORS 30.647(3), ORS 34.712, ORS 138.225, ORS 
138.660, ORS 144.335(6), or any other statute authorizing summary affirmance.

The appellate commissioner shall have the authority to refer any matter to the 

Chief Judge or the Motions Department, as appropriate.

legal issues already argued by the parties or addressed by the court shall not apply 
to petitions or motions for reconsideration of a decision of the appellate 
commissioner, and 

(ii) 

only the original of the petition must be filed. 

 
If a party files a petition or motion for reconsideration of a ruling by the 
appellate commissioner, the appellate commissioner may consider the matter in the first 
instance.  The appellate commissioner shall have the authority to grant a request for 
reconsideration and modify or reverse the result.  However, if the appellate commissioner

forward the request to the Chief Judge or the Motions Department, as appropriate, for 
decision. 

(c) 

Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection, a decision of the 
appellate commissioner is not subject to a petition for review in the Supreme Court, but 
the decision of the Chief Judge or the Motions Department on reconsideration of a ruling 
of the appellate commissioner is subject to a petition for review.  ORAP 6.25(3) is not 
applicable to a ruling of the appellate commissioner.

under ORS 19.235(3) and designates it as a summary determination as provided in ORAP 
2.35(3)(a), the appellate commissioner's order is subject to a petition for review in the 
Supreme Court.

As used in this rule, "own motion matter" includes but is not limited to an order to 
show cause why a case should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or for lack of prosecution, 
an order of dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or lack of prosecution where the court has raised the 
ground for dismissal on its own motion, and an order for substitution of a public officer who is a 
party to the case where a new person has duly assumed the public office.

the appeal but will not vacate the judgment.  If the defendant has assigned error to 
a monetary provision of the sentence, the court will dismiss the appeal and vacate 
the challenged monetary provision, but will not vacate the remainder of the 
judgment. 

(iv)  Notwithstanding subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph, if 

 
the defendant dies after issuance of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the 
judgment and after all right to petition for review has expired, the court will 
dismiss the appeal but will not vacate the judgment. 

(a) 

Any party who learns of the death of a defendant in a criminal case that is 
(2) 
pending on appeal shall notify the court and all other parties of the death within 28 days 
after learning of the death.  Any party may move to dismiss the appeal. 

(b) 

If the appeal is from a judgment of conviction and sentence, the party 

 
filing the notice also may, concurrently with filing the notice of the defendant's death, file 
a memorandum addressing whether the court should dismiss the appeal or vacate the 
judgment, or both.  Within 28 days after the filing of the notice of the defendant's death, 
any other party or interested person may file a memorandum addressing the same issues. 

(c) 

The following are presumptive dispositions under this subsection: 

   

(1) 

Oregon Rule of Civil Procedure (ORCP) 34, relating to substitution of parties in 

civil cases, is adopted. 
 

(3) 

If a defendant in a criminal case, a petitioner in a post-conviction relief 

proceeding, a plaintiff in a habeas corpus proceeding, a petitioner in a parole review proceeding, 
or a petitioner in a prison disciplinary case, on appeal of an adverse decision, escapes or 
absconds from custody or supervision, the respondent on appeal may move for dismissal of the 
appeal.  If the court determines that the appellant is on escape or abscond status at the time the 

104                                                          Chapter 8 
 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

   

court decides the motion, the court may dismiss the appeal or judicial review.  If the court has 
not been advised otherwise, the court may infer that the appellant remains on escape or abscond 
status when the court considers and decides the motion. 

Rule 8.10 
WITHDRAWAL, SUBSTITUTION, AND ASSOCIATION 
OF ATTORNEYS ON APPEAL 

(1) 

During the pendency of an appeal, an attorney may not withdraw from or 

substitute new counsel in a case except on order of the appellate court.  A motion to withdraw or 
substitute new counsel must be filed and served on the client and every other party to the appeal, 
and is subject to ORS 9.380(1)(b) and ORS 9.390. 

(2) 

Except as provided in ORAP 8.12, unless it appears otherwise from the record, 
the court will presume that good and sufficient cause exists for substitution of counsel if both 
attorneys sign the motion for substitution of counsel.  On filing of the motion for substitution of 
counsel in proper form and bearing the signatures of both attorneys, the substitution shall be 
deemed to have been ordered by the appellate court. 

(3) 

An attorney who associates another attorney from a different firm on appeal shall 

file a notice of association with the appellate court, accompanied by proof of service on every 
other party to the appeal. 

(4) 

An attorney admitted to the practice of law in another jurisdiction, but not in 

Oregon, may appear by brief and argue the cause in a proceeding before an appellate court in the 
manner prescribed in UTCR 3.170.1

(b) 

A court-appointed attorney shall have no obligation to move to withdraw 
 
or substitute counsel at the client's request unless the attorney has a good faith basis for 
the motion.

be substituted as new counsel.  Thereafter, if counsel of record files a motion for 
substitution, in addition to satisfying the service requirements provided in ORAP 8.10(1), 
counsel of record shall serve a copy of the motion on the Office of Public Defense 
Services.  Upon expiration of seven days after the date of filing the motion, unless it 
appears otherwise from the record, the court will presume that good and sufficient cause 
exists for substitution of counsel and the substitution shall be deemed to have been 
ordered by the court if: 

(i) 

Counsel of record has signed the substitution; 

(ii) 

The new attorney to be substituted as counsel for a party has been 
 
determined by the Office of Public Defense Services to be qualified for the type 
of case in which the motion for substitution is filed; and 

(iii)  No objection is filed to the proposed substitution. 

 

 

(b) 

If, after consultation by counsel of record with the Office of Public 

 
Defense Services, the Office of Public Defense Services does not concur with the need 
for substitution of counsel or does not approve the attorney to be substituted into the case, 
counsel of record may file a motion for substitution of counsel.  Any such motion must 
satisfy the service requirements of subsection (1) of ORAP 8.10, must include proof of 
service on the Office of Public Defense Services, and is subject to ORAP 7.05 and any 
other rule relating to motions generally.1 

(a) 

If the client of a court-appointed attorney moves to appoint new counsel 
(3) 
based on the client's dissatisfaction with professional services rendered by the attorney, 
the client shall file the motion in the appellate court and serve the motion on the court-
appointed attorney. 

(b) 

 
If a party has a statutory or constitutional right to be represented by court-
appointed counsel, the filing of any motion that would result in the party proceeding on 
appeal or review without counsel constitutes an attempt to waive the right to counsel.2 

(c) 

If the court declines to accept a party's attempt to waive counsel, the court 

 
shall give the party an opportunity to file a supplemental pro se brief as provided in 
ORAP 5.92(2) and (3).3 

(4) 

To the extent practicable, the provisions of this rule are applicable to a legal 

advisor appointed under ORS 135.045(1)(d).4

Rule 8.15 
AMICUS CURIAE 

(1) 

A person1 may appear as amicus curiae in any case pending before the appellate 
court only by permission of the appellate court on written application setting forth the interest of 
the person in the case.  The application must: 
 

(a) 

 
state whether the applicant intends to present a private interest of its own 
or to present a position as to the correct rule of law that does not affect a private interest 
of its own; 

(b) 

 
is unaligned;  

identify the party with whom the amicus is aligned or state that the amicus 

(c) 

 
amicus application (such as the date that the aligned party's brief is due); and  

identify the deadline in the case that is relevant to the timeliness of the 

 

 

(d) 

explain why the application is timely relative to that deadline. 

(e) 

The application shall not contain argument on the resolution of the case. 

(2) 

The application shall be submitted by an active member of the Oregon State Bar.  
A filing fee is not required.  The form of the application shall comply with ORAP 7.10(1) and (2) 
and the applicant shall file the original and one copy of the application.  A copy of the 
application shall be served on all parties to the proceeding. 

(3) 

In the Court of Appeals, the application to appear amicus curiae may, but need 

not, be accompanied by the brief the applicant would file if permitted to appear. In the Supreme 
Court, the application shall be accompanied by the brief sought to be filed.  The form of an 
amicus brief shall be subject to the same rules as those governing briefs of parties.2  If, 
consistently with this rule, a brief is submitted with the application, then: 
 

if the court grants the application, the date of filing for the brief relates 

(a) 

 
back to the date of filing for the application; or

(b) 

if the court denies the application, the court will strike the brief. 

(4) 

In the Court of Appeals, unless the court grants leave otherwise for good cause 
shown, an amicus brief shall be due seven days after the date the brief is due of the party with 
whom amicus curiae is aligned or, if amicus curiae is not aligned with any party, seven days 
after the date the opening brief is due. 

(5)  With respect to cases in the Supreme Court on petition for review from the Court 

of Appeals: 
 

(a) 

 
A person wishing to appear amicus curiae may seek to appear in support 
of or in opposition to a petition for review, on the merits of the case on review, or both. 

(b) 

Unless the court grants leave otherwise for good cause shown, an 

 
application to appear amicus curiae in support of or in opposition to a petition for review 
shall be filed within 14 days after the filing of a petition for review. 

(c) 

 
application to appear amicus curiae on the merits of a case on review shall be filed: 

Unless the court grants leave otherwise for good cause shown, an 

(i) 

 
amicus curiae is aligned, 

On the date the brief is due of the party on review with whom 

(ii) 

 
amicus curiae is not aligned with any party on review,3 or 

On the date the petitioner's brief on the merits on review is due, if 

(iii)  Within 28 days after review is allowed, if petitioner on review has 

 
filed a notice that petitioner does not intend to file a brief on the merits or has 
filed no notice, regardless of the alignment of amicus curiae. 

(d) 

 
If a person filing an application to appear amicus curiae wishes to file one 
brief in support of or in opposition to a petition for review and on the merits of the case, 
the application and brief shall be filed within the same time that an application to appear 
in support of or in opposition to a petition for review would be filed.  If a person has been 
granted permission to appear amicus curiae in support of or in opposition to a petition for 
review and the Supreme Court allows review, the person may file an amicus curiae brief 
on the merits without further leave of the court. 

(e) 

If a party obtains an extension of time to file a petition for review, a 

 
response to a petition for review or a brief on the merits and if an amicus curiae brief was 
due on the same date as the petition, response or brief on the merits, the time for filing the 
amicus curiae brief is automatically extended to the same date. 
 
(6) 

Except as provided in ORAP 11.30(7), with respect to cases in the Supreme Court 

 
on direct review or direct appeal, or other proceedings not subject to subsection (5), amicus 
curiae briefs shall be due as provided in subsection (4) of this rule.

Amicus curiae may file a memorandum of additional authorities under the same 

circumstances that a party could file a memorandum of additional authorities under ORAP 5.85. 

(8) 

Amicus curiae shall not be allowed to orally argue the case, unless the court 

specifically authorizes or directs oral argument.4 

(9) 

The State of Oregon may appear as amicus curiae in any case in the Supreme 

Court and Court of Appeals without permission of the court.  The state shall comply with all the 
requirements for appearing amicus curiae, including the time within which to appear under 
subsections (4), (5), and (6) of this rule.  If the state is not aligned with any party, the state's 
amicus curiae brief shall be due on the same date as the respondent's brief.

Rule 8.20 
EFFECT OF BANKRUPTCY PETITION 

(1)  When a matter is pending in the appellate courts and a party learns that the matter 
is subject to the stay provisions of 11 USC § 362(a)(1)1 (relating to bankruptcy proceedings), the 
party shall give notice of that fact to the appellate court, together with proof of service of the 
notice on all other parties to the case.  The court will enter an order holding the matter in 
abeyance until it is shown to the court's satisfaction that the stay has been lifted or that 11 USC 
§ 362(a)(1) is not applicable to the case. 

(2) 

If a petition in bankruptcy is filed after entry of a judgment or final order but 

before a notice of appeal or petition for judicial review is filed and the adverse party desires to 
appeal, the notice or petition must nonetheless be filed within the time provided by statute or 
rule. 

(3) 

If an appellant believes that a pending bankruptcy proceeding involving a party to 

the judgment being appealed should stay the appeal pending disposition of the bankruptcy 
proceeding, the notice of appeal or petition for judicial review shall contain, in addition to all 
other requirements under a statute or these rules, a statement identifying the party that has filed a 
petition in bankruptcy and a request to hold the appeal in abeyance on account of the bankruptcy 
proceeding.

(a)  Whether the petition in bankruptcy is filed after judgment or final order 
(4) 
but before a notice of appeal or petition for judicial review is filed, or after a notice or 
petition is filed, the appellate court will not exercise jurisdiction as to the debtor party as 
long as the stay under 11 USC § 362 remains in effect. 

(b) 

 If more than one creditor and debtor are parties to the case on appeal and 

 
the presence of the debtor subject to the bankruptcy petition is necessary to resolve on 
appeal the claims of the other parties, then the appellate court will not exercise 
jurisdiction of the entire cause as long as the stay under 11 USC § 362 remains in effect. 

________ 
1 The filing of a petition in bankruptcy under 11 USC §§ 301, 302, or 303 operates as a stay as to 
all entities, of: 
 

"the commencement or continuation, including the issuance or employment of 
process, of a judicial, administrative, or other proceeding against the debtor that 
was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the case under 
this title, or to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the 
commencement of the case under this title *  * *."

Rule 8.25 
MOTION UNDER ORCP 71 FOR 
RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT 

(1) 

If the copy of a motion for relief from judgment under ORCP 71 A or ORCP 71 B 

required to be served on the appellate court1 is not entitled "MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM 
JUDGMENT UNDER ORCP 71," it shall be accompanied by a letter of transmittal identifying 
the motion as a motion for relief under ORCP 71 A or ORCP 71 B. 

(2)  When a party has filed a motion for relief from judgment under ORCP 71 A or 

ORCP 71 B while the judgment is on appeal, the appellate court will decide whether to hold the 
appeal in abeyance pending disposition of the motion or to allow the appeal to go forward.  Any 
party to the appeal may move the court to hold the appeal in abeyance or to allow the appeal to 
go forward.  In the absence of a motion from a party, the court on its own motion will review the 
motion for relief from judgment, decide whether to hold the appeal in abeyance and notify the 
parties if it decides to do so. If the court does not order the appeal to be held in abeyance, the 
appeal will go forward. 

(3) 

A party wishing to appeal an order deciding a motion filed under ORCP 71 A or 
ORCP 71 B during the pendency of an appeal shall file a notice of appeal within the time and in 
the manner prescribed in ORS chapter 19.  The notice of appeal as filed shall bear the same 
appellate case number assigned to the original notice of appeal.

Rule 8.27 
MODIFICATION OF JUDGMENT OF 
DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE DURING 
PENDENCY OF APPEAL 

(1) 

During the pendency of an appeal from a judgment of dissolution of marriage, if it 
comes to the attention of the court that a party has filed a motion under ORS 19.275(1) to modify 
the judgment of dissolution of marriage, including a motion to reconsider spousal or child 
support provisions of a judgment pursuant to ORS 107.135, the appellate court may hold the 
appeal in abeyance pending disposition of the motion or allow the appeal to go forward.  Any 
party to the appeal may move the court to hold the appeal in abeyance or to allow the appeal to 
go forward.  In the absence of a motion from a party, the court on its own motion may review the 
motion filed in the trial court, decide whether to hold the appeal in abeyance and notify the 
parties if it decides to do so.  If the court does not order the appeal to be held in abeyance, the 
appeal will go forward. 

(2) 

A party wishing to appeal the trial court's final decision on a motion under ORS 
19.275 during the pendency of an appeal shall file a notice of appeal within the time and in the 
manner prescribed in ORS chapter 19.  The notice of appeal as filed shall bear the same appellate 
case number assigned to the original notice of appeal. 

(3) 

If the appellate court holds an appeal in abeyance pending disposition of a motion 

under ORS 19.275(1) and subsequently receives a copy of the trial court's final decision, the 
appellate court shall decide whether to reactivate the appeal or take other action after expiration 
of the period within which an appeal from the final decision may be filed.  If a timely appeal 
from the final decision on a motion under ORS 19.275 is filed, the court may direct that both 
appeals be heard at the same time or may allow the appeals to proceed independently of one 
another.

party filing the motion shall transmit a copy of the motion to the appellate court.1 
 

(a) 

If the trial court enters a corrected or supplemental judgment on motion of 

(2) 
a party or on its own motion, a party wishing to appeal the corrected or supplemental 
judgment shall file an amended notice of appeal within the time and in the manner 
prescribed in ORS chapter 138 and shall use the appellate case number assigned to the 
appeal from the original judgment.  The amended notice of appeal shall state when the 
party received notice of entry of the corrected or supplemental judgment. 

(b) 

If the trial court enters a corrected or supplemental judgment and the 

 
appellant no longer wishes to pursue the original appeal, the appellant shall file a motion 
to dismiss the appeal. 

(c) 

If the trial court denies a motion for entry of a corrected or supplemental 

 
judgment subject to subsection (1) of this rule, the party who filed the motion shall notify 
the Administrator in writing and within seven days after the date of entry of the trial 
court's order and shall attach a copy of the order denying the motion. 

(3)  When a party has filed a motion subject to subsection (1) of this rule, pending a 

final ruling on the motion by the trial court, the appellate court, on motion of a party or on its 
own motion, may order that the appeal be held in abeyance.  If an order is entered holding the 
appeal in abeyance, when the court receives notice under subsection (2) of this rule that the trial 
court has entered a corrected or supplemental judgment or a final order disposing of the motion, 
the appellate court shall reactivate the appeal or issue such other order as may be appropriate. 

________ 
1 See, e.g., a motion in the trial court under ORS 137.172 for entry of a corrected judgment to 
correct arithmetic or clerical errors or to delete or modify any erroneous term in the judgment; a 
motion in the trial court under ORS 137.105 for entry of a supplemental judgment specifying the 
amount of restitution to be paid by the defendant; and a motion for entry of a corrected judgment 
under ORS 137.754.

DISQUALIFICATION OF JUDGE 

(1) 

If a party or counsel for a party discovers that a sitting Court of Appeals or 

Supreme Court judge participated in the case in the proceedings being appealed or reviewed, the 
party or counsel shall notify the Administrator by letter of the judge's participation as soon as 
possible after discovering the judge's participation. 

(2) 

The duty of a party or counsel to notify the Administrator of a sitting appellate 
judge's previous participation in the proceeding includes, in post-conviction relief and habeas 
corpus cases, the underlying criminal proceeding.

  _

attorney for a party in a case before the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals may move to 
disqualify a judge of the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals for one or more of the 
grounds specified in ORS 14.210, or upon the ground that the judge's participation in the 
case would violate the Oregon Code of Judicial Conduct.  The motion shall be filed as 
soon as practicable after the party or attorney learns of the ground for disqualification. 
 

(i) 

(b) 
The Administrator shall forward a copy of the motion to the judge 
against whom the motion is directed without waiting for an answer to the motion.  
The judge may grant the motion with or without an answer having been filed.  If 
the judge does not believe that the motion is well taken, the judge shall refer the 
motion to the presiding judge for decision.  The judge's referral may be 
accompanied by any written response the judge may wish to make.  If the judge 
accompanies the referral with written response, the judge shall provide the parties 
with a copy of the written comments.  The presiding judge may rule on the motion 
or may refer the motion to the full court for a decision. 

(ii) 

In the Court of Appeals, "presiding judge" means the Chief Judge, 

 
unless the motion to disqualify is directed at the Chief Judge, in which case 
"presiding judge" means the next senior judge available to rule on the motion.  In 
the Supreme Court, "presiding judge" means the Chief Justice, unless the motion 
to disqualify is directed at the Chief Justice, in which case "presiding judge" 
means the next senior judge available to rule on the motion.

proceedings in the appellate courts shall be allowed in accordance with this rule. 

(3)  Where available, audio pickup for all media purposes shall be accomplished from 

existing audio systems present in the courtroom, except if the audio pickup is attached to and 
operated as part of a television or videotape camera.  If no technically suitable audio system 
exists in the courtroom, microphones and related wiring essential for media purposes shall be 
unobtrusive and shall be located in places designated in advance of the proceeding by the judge 
presiding in the proceeding.

into the courtroom and may not be replaced or closed inside the courtroom.  Television 
film magazines (as distinct from videotape) and still camera film or lenses shall not be 
changed in the courtroom except during a recess.

the proceeding that the equipment that will be used meets the light and sound standards 
of this rule. 

(7) 

"Pooling" arrangements required by the limitations of this rule on media 

equipment and personnel shall be the sole responsibility of the media without calling on the 
judge presiding in the proceeding to mediate any dispute as to the appropriate representative or

Rule 8.40 
REVIEW OF TRIAL COURT RULINGS 
AFFECTING APPEAL 

During the pendency of an appeal, if the trial court rules on a matter affecting the appeal,1 

any party aggrieved by the trial court's ruling may request, by motion filed within 14 days after 
the date of entry of the trial court's ruling, that the appellate court review the trial court's ruling

Rule 8.45 
DUTY TO SERVE NOTICE OR 
FILE MOTION ON OCCURRENCE OF EVENT 
RENDERING APPEAL MOOT 

Except as to facts the disclosure of which is barred by the attorney-client privilege, when 

a party becomes aware of facts that probably render an appeal moot,1 that party shall provide 
notice of the facts to the court and to the other party or parties to the appeal, and may file a 
motion to dismiss the appeal.  If a party becomes aware of facts that probably render an appeal 
moot and fails promptly to inform the other party or parties to the appeal and the court dismisses 
the appeal as moot, the court, on motion of the aggrieved party, may award costs and attorney 
fees incurred by the aggrieved party incurred after notice should have been given of the facts 
probably rendering the appeal moot, payable by the party who had knowledge of the facts. 

________ 
1 For example, the death of the defendant in a criminal case, the release from custody of the 
plaintiff in a habeas corpus case, or settlement of a civil case. 

Rule 8.47 
NOTIFICATION OF RELATED CASES 

When a party files a brief in the Court of Appeals, if the party is aware of another case 

pending in an appellate court that arises out of the same case or consolidated case, or that 
involves the same transaction or event, the party must file a notice with the Court of Appeals

separate document from the party’s brief.  A party may likewise notify the Court of Appeals if 
the party is aware of another case pending in an appellate court that raises the same or a closely 
related issue.  A party need not notify the Court of Appeals of a related case if another party has 
already done so.

For purposes of this rule, "protected personal information" is information that: 

(a) 

Identifies a person beyond that person's name (e.g., Social Security 

 
number, maiden name, driver license number, birth date and location) or identifies a 
person's financial activities (e.g., credit card number, credit report, bank account number 
or location); and  

(b)

The appellate court is permitted to maintain as confidential and not subject 

(a) 

A person or entity required to file a document in the appellate court that 

(2) 
contains protected personal information may submit that information on a separate 
document together with a motion describing the information and requesting that the 
appellate court keep the separate document segregated from the appellate court file.  The 
caption of the separate document must prominently display the words "Segregated 
Personal Protected Information, ORAP 8.50(2)(a), Confidential."  The moving party shall 
serve a copy of the motion on all other parties to the appeal, review, or other proceeding.  
During the pendency of the motion, the separate document will not be available for 
public inspection. 

(b) 

A person or entity who has filed a document in the appellate court that 
contains protected personal information may submit a motion to replace the document 
with a document that redacts the protected personal information and requesting that the 
appellate court keep the original document segregated from the appellate court file.  The 
caption of the motion must prominently display the words "Motion -- Redact Previously 
Filed Document, ORAP 8.50(2)(b)."  The moving party shall submit the proposed 
redacted document with the motion.  The moving party shall serve a copy of the motion 
and the proposed redacted document on all other parties to the appeal, review, or other 
proceeding.  During the pendency of the motion, the document containing protected 
personal information will not be available for public inspection.1 

   

Rule 8.50 
SEGREGATION OF 
PROTECTED PERSONAL INFORMATION 

(3) 

If the court grants the motion, then the court will segregate the document 

containing protected personal information from the appellate court file.  The motion will remain 
in the appellate court file.  Any request for public inspection of such a document containing 
protected personal information must be made in writing, filed with the appellate court, and

(1) 

If the circuit court order sets aside all convictions or expunges all delinquency 
adjudications in the case, the Administrator will seal the appellate court record and modify the 
version of the court's opinion published on the Judicial Department's website to avoid use of the 
party's name in the case title and body of the opinion.* 

(2) 

If a circuit court order sets aside fewer than all convictions or adjudications in a 

case, the Administrator will not seal the appellate court record, but may modify the version of the  
court's opinion published on the Judicial Department's website to avoid use of the party's name in 
the case title and body of the opinion.*

* Appellate court opinions also are published in the softbound Oregon Appellate Courts Advance 
Sheets and thereafter in the hardbound Oregon Reports.  The version of an opinion in those 
publications cannot be modified after publication.  Appellate court opinions also are collected 
and published, in book form or electronically or both, by various persons and entities, including 
private legal research entities.  The court has no control over whether those persons and entities 
will honor the court's post-publication modification of an opinion.

CRITERIA FOR GRANTING 
DISCRETIONARY REVIEW 

The Supreme Court considers the items set out below to be relevant to the decision 

whether to grant discretionary review. These criteria are published to inform and assist the bar 
and the public. They are neither exclusive nor binding. The court retains the inherent authority to 
allow or deny any petition for review. A petition for review may refer to those items that are 
relevant to the case and need not address each listed item.1

may include, for example: 
 

(a) 

The interpretation of a constitutional provision, 

(b) 

The interpretation of a statute, 

(c) 

The constitutionality of a statute, 

(d) 

The legality of an important governmental action, 

(e) 

The use or effect of a rule of trial court procedure, 

(f) 

The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals or the trial court, or 

(g) 

The application or proposed modification of a principle of common law. 

(2)  Whether the issue or a similar issue arises often. 

(3)  Whether many people are affected by the decision in the case. Whether the 

consequence of the decision is important to the public, even if the issue may not arise often. 

(4)  Whether the legal issue is an issue of state law. 

(5)  Whether the issue is one of first impression for the Supreme Court. 

(6)  Whether the same or a related issue is pending before the Supreme Court. 

(7)  Whether the legal issue is properly preserved, and whether the case is free from 

factual disputes or procedural obstacles that might prevent the Supreme Court from reaching the 
legal issue. 

(8)  Whether the record does, in fact, present the desired issue. 

(9)  Whether present case law is inconsistent (among Court of Appeals cases, between 

Court of Appeals cases and Supreme Court cases, or among Supreme Court cases). 

123                                                          Chapter 9

confused in ruling on the issue that the case presents. 

(11)  Whether the Court of Appeals published a written opinion. 

(12)  Whether the Court of Appeals was divided on the case. 

(13)  Whether the Court of Appeals decided the case en banc.

as by legislation or rulemaking. 

   

(a)  Whether the error results in a serious or irreversible injustice or in a 

 
distortion or misapplication of a legal principle. 

(15)  Whether the issues are well presented in the briefs. 

(16)  Whether an amicus curiae has appeared, or is available to advise the court. 

(14)  Whether the Court of Appeals decision appears to be wrong. If the decision 

appears to be wrong: 
 

________ 
1 A party may include in an appendix to a petition for review materials in support of criteria 
under this rule that are not otherwise part of the record on appeal, such as materials 
demonstrating how the case may affect persons other than the parties to the immediate case or 
how the case is important to the public.

less than a majority of the judges eligible to vote on the petition vote to allow it. 

(2) 

If the Supreme Court allows a petition for review, the court may limit the 

questions on review.  If review is not so limited, the questions before the Supreme Court include 
all questions properly before the Court of Appeals that the petition or the response claims were 
erroneously decided by that court.  The Supreme Court's opinion need not address each such 
question.  The court may consider other issues that were before the Court of Appeals. 

(3)  When the Supreme Court allows a petition for review, the court may request the 

parties to address specific questions.  Those specific questions should be addressed at oral 
argument and may also be addressed in the parties' briefs on the merits on review or by

memoranda shall be filed and copies served not less than seven days before argument or 
submission of the case. 

(4) 

The parties' briefs in the Court of Appeals will be considered as the main briefs in 

the Supreme Court, supplemented by the petition for review and any response, brief on the 
merits on review, or additional memoranda that may be filed.1 

(5) 

The record on review shall consist of the record before the Court of Appeals.

Rule 9.25 
RECONSIDERATION IN SUPREME COURT 

(1) 

A party seeking reconsideration of a decision of the Supreme Court shall file a 

petition for reconsideration within 14 days after the date of the decision.  The petition shall be in 
the form of a brief, prepared in conformity with ORAP 5.05 and ORAP 5.95, insofar as they are 
applicable.  The petition must be no longer than a petition for review in the Supreme Court as 
prescribed by ORAP 9.05(3)(a).  The petition shall include a copy of the court's decision.  A 
petitioner shall identify on the cover which party is the petitioner, the date of the decision, and, if 
there is an opinion or if there are opinions, the judges who joined therein. 

(2) 

Any response to a petition for reconsideration must be filed within seven days 

after the filing of the petition for reconsideration. 

(3)

(b) 

 
If a motion for an extension of time to file a petition for review is filed, 
until the Supreme Court denies the motion or, if the Supreme Court allows the motion, 
until the time for filing the petition for review expires; 

(c) 

If a motion to hold a case in abeyance pending disposition of another case 

 
in the Supreme Court is filed, until the Supreme Court denies the motion or, if the

judgment issues, notwithstanding that the case is pending in the Supreme Court. 

(d) 

 
If a case is pending in the Supreme Court as to any action of the Court of 
Appeals that does not dispose of an appeal, until the appellate judgment issues.  In these 
circumstances, the Court of Appeals, in its discretion, may proceed with the case or await 
disposition by the Supreme Court. 

(3)  Motions should not be filed simultaneously in both the Supreme Court and Court 
of Appeals.  If either the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals receives a motion that it determines 
should have been filed in the other court, it shall transfer the motion to the other court.  In the 
event a dispute arises concerning which court should rule on a motion, the Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court and the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals may confer and decide which court 
will rule on the motion.

Rule 10.05 
APPLICATION FOR INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL 
IN CLASS ACTION 

The practice and procedure governing applications to appeal from certain court orders 

involving questions of law under ORS 19.225 shall be as follows: 

(1) 

An application to file an interlocutory appeal under ORS 19.225 shall be entitled 
"Appellant's Application for Interlocutory Appeal Pursuant to ORS 19.225."  The applicant shall 
be entitled "Appellant" and the opposing party "Respondent."  The application shall be 
accompanied by the appellant's filing fee. 

(a) 

A statement not exceeding three pages formally applying for leave to file 

 
notice of appeal and informing the court of the nature of the cause or causes of action 
involved, the specific order desired to be appealed and its effect on the litigation, and the 
controlling question of law pertinent to the application. 

(b) 

 
A memorandum not exceeding 10 pages explaining why the application 
should be allowed, accompanied by a copy of any exhibits necessary to the explanation. 

(c) 

A notice of appeal in the form provided in ORAP 2.05. 

   

(2) 

The application shall consist of: 

(3) 

An applicant shall file with the Administrator the original application and all 

accompanying papers, together with proof of service on all other parties to the case and the trial 
court judge. 

(4) 

The opposing party shall be allowed 14 days within which to file an answer, 

which shall be entitled, "Respondent's Memorandum in Response to Application for 
Interlocutory Appeal Pursuant to ORS 19.225."  The answering memorandum shall not exceed 
10 pages and shall be accompanied only by the exhibits necessary to support the explanation 
why the application should not be allowed. 

(5) 

The respondent shall file with the Administrator the original answering 

memorandum and all accompanying papers, together with proof of service on all other parties to 
the case and the trial court judge.  The answering memorandum shall be accompanied by the 
respondent's appearance fee. 

(6) 

If the respondent seeks to appeal from an order under ORS 19.225 independently 

of the appellant, the respondent shall accompany the answering memorandum with an 
application in the form required by this rule and an appellant's filing fee.  If the respondent seeks 
to cross-appeal from the same order that the appellant seeks to appeal only if the court allows the

appellant's application, respondent shall tender a notice of cross-appeal but need not comply with 
subsections (2), (3), and (5) of this rule. 

(7) 

An applicant shall be allowed seven days within which to file a reply, consisting 

of no more than seven pages, which shall be entitled "Appellant's Reply to Memorandum in 
Response to Application for Interlocutory Appeal Pursuant to ORS 19.225."  The applicant shall 
file the original reply together with proof of service on all other parties to the case and the trial 
court judge. 

(8) 

If the Court of Appeals allows an application under ORS 19.225, the notice of 

appeal and notice of cross-appeal are deemed filed as of the date of the order allowing the 
application.  The appeal shall then proceed in accordance with the statutes and rules governing 
civil appeals. 

Rule 10.10 
CERTIFICATION OF APPEAL TO 
SUPREME COURT BY COURT OF APPEALS 

(1) 

Certification of an appeal to the Supreme Court pursuant to ORS 19.405 shall be 
through the Chief Judge by a majority of the judges of the Court of Appeals not disqualified to 
consider the appeal to be certified. 

(2)  Written notice of certification shall be given to the parties to the appeal by the 

Administrator, but failure to give or receive the notice shall not affect the validity of the 
certification. 

(3) 

Certification shall have the same effect as a motion subject to ORAP 7.30, except 
that the Court of Appeals may consider any motion, petition or other matter presented by a party 
pending the acceptance or denial of acceptance of the certification, on a showing that the matter 
presented should be considered during the pendency of the certification. 

(4) 

If the Supreme Court denies acceptance of a certified appeal, or if the Supreme 
Court fails to accept or deny acceptance of a certified appeal within the time provided by ORS 
19.405, the Administrator shall notify the Court of Appeals and the parties to the appeal in 
writing; the case shall thereafter proceed in due course in the Court of Appeals. 

(5) 

The Court of Appeals may not certify an appeal more than one time. 

(6) 

To accept a certified appeal, a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court 
considering the certification must vote in favor of acceptance.  The court shall file an order 
accepting or denying the certification within 20 days after the date of receiving the certification, 
except that the court, by order entered within that 20-day period, may extend by not more than 
10 days the time for acceptance or denial of the certified appeal.  If the court does not file an 
order accepting or denying the certification within that time, the certification is deemed denied.  

 

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

131                                                          Chapter 10 
 

If the court accepts or denies a certification by written order, the Administrator shall send a copy 
of the order to the parties and to the Court of Appeals. 

(7) 

If the Supreme Court accepts a certified appeal, the Court of Appeals shall 
transmit the record of the case and the briefs of the parties to the Supreme Court, and the 
Supreme Court shall thereafter have jurisdiction of the case, and it shall be considered pending in 
the Supreme Court without additional notice of appeal, filing fee, undertaking or, except as the 
Supreme Court may require, briefs.  The case shall then proceed in the Supreme Court as 
directed in its notification of acceptance.

In a mandamus proceeding that challenges the action of a judge in 

 
a particular case in the circuit court, the Tax Court, or the Court of Appeals, the 
relator shall accompany the petition with proof of service on the adverse party, 
any other party (if any) to the proceeding in the lower court, and the judge or 
court whose action is challenged in the mandamus proceeding. 

(ii) 

In any other mandamus proceeding, the relator shall accompany 

the petition with proof of service on the defendant and, if the mandamus 
proceeding arises from another proceeding or controversy, proof of service on any 
other party to the proceeding or controversy.

(e) 

If the relator seeks a stay in the proceedings from which the mandamus 

 
proceeding arises, the caption shall indicate "STAY REQUESTED," and the relator shall 
show, in the statement in support of the petition, that the relator requested a stay from the 
court, judge, or administrative agency or official whose order or decision is being 
challenged and that the request for a stay was denied, or that it would be futile to request 
a stay from the court, judge, or administrative agency or official.  If the relator seeks to

If the mandamus proceeding arises from a matter in which a record has 
been made, the relator must assemble an excerpt of record containing such parts of the 
record relating to the matter as is necessary for a determination of the question or 
questions presented and the relief sought.  The excerpt of record must comply with 
ORAP 5.50(5).

(c) 

In a mandamus proceeding that challenges the action of the Court of 

Appeals, the Tax Court, or a judge in a particular case in the circuit court, the relator need 
not accompany the petition with a proposed form of writ of mandamus; in any other 
mandamus proceeding, the relator shall do so.

Rule 11.10 
MANDAMUS: 
RESPONSE BY ADVERSE PARTY AND 
CONSIDERATION BY THE COURT 

(1) 

Unless the court directs otherwise, the adverse party in a mandamus proceeding 

that challenges the action of a judge in a particular case in the circuit court, the Tax Court, or the 
Court of Appeals or the defendant in any other mandamus proceeding may file a memorandum 
in opposition.1  The form of the memorandum shall comply with ORAP 7.10(1) and (2).  The 
original memorandum shall be filed within 14 days after the date the petition was filed.  A relator 
may not file a reply memorandum unless the court has requested one. 

(2) 

The petition and any memoranda in opposition to the petition shall be considered 

by the court without oral argument unless otherwise ordered.  If the court determines to accept 
jurisdiction, it shall issue an order allowing the petition.  Otherwise, the petition shall be denied 
by order of the court. 

(3) 

If the court issues an alternative writ of mandamus in a mandamus proceeding 

that challenges the action of a judge in a particular case in the circuit court, the Tax Court, or the 
Court of Appeals, the Administrator shall mail copies of the order allowing the petition and the 
alternative writ of mandamus to the relator, to the adverse party, to any intervenor, and to the 
judge or court whose action is challenged in the petition.  Proof of service of an alternative writ 
of mandamus need not be filed with the court.  Unless the alternative writ of mandamus 
specifically requires that a return, answer, or responsive pleading be filed, the judge or court to 
which the writ is issued need not file a return, answer, or responsive pleading. 

(4) 

If the court issues an alternative writ in any other mandamus proceeding, the court 

shall set a return date in the writ, and the Administrator shall mail copies of the order allowing 
the petition and the alternative writ of mandamus to the relator, to the defendant, and to any 
intervenor.  On or before the return date in the writ, the defendant shall either file a certificate of

compliance or show cause by answer or motion to dismiss as provided by ORS 34.170.  If the 
defendant fails to file a certificate of compliance or show cause by answer or motion to dismiss 
on or before the return date set in the writ, the court, without further notice to the parties, may 
issue a peremptory writ of mandamus, as provided in ORS 34.180. When the case is at issue on 
the pleadings,2 the court will notify the parties to that effect. 

(5) 

At any time after the filing of a petition for writ of mandamus or the issuance of 
an alternative writ of mandamus, if the defendant, judge, or court performs the act sought in the 
petition or required in the alternative writ, the relator shall notify, and the defendant, judge, 
court, or any other party to the lower court case may notify, the court of that compliance.  After 
receiving notice of the compliance, the court on motion of any party or on its own motion may 
dismiss the mandamus proceeding.

mandamus, in a mandamus proceeding that challenges the action of a judge in a 
particular case in the circuit court, the Tax Court, or the Court of Appeals; or

oral argument, the parties shall argue in the order in which their briefs were filed. 

Rule 11.17 
MANDAMUS: 
ISSUANCE OF COMBINED 
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
AND APPELLATE JUDGMENT 

If the court has determined that the relator is entitled to a peremptory writ of mandamus, 
the court shall direct the Administrator to issue the writ.  The peremptory writ may be combined 
with the appellate judgment and issued together as a single document.  If the peremptory writ 
and the appellate judgment are combined, the relator need not file proof of service of the writ 
with the court, and the judge or court to which the writ is issued in a mandamus proceeding that 
challenges the action of a judge in a particular case in the circuit court, the Tax Court, or the 
Court of Appeals or the defendant in any other mandamus proceeding need not file a return 
showing compliance with the writ.

The practice and procedure governing a petition to the Supreme Court to review a ballot 

title shall be: 

(1) 

Any elector dissatisfied with a ballot title provided by the Attorney General under 

ORS 250.067 or ORS 250.075(2), or by the Legislative Assembly under ORS 250.075(1), may 

150                                                          Chapter 11

file with the Administrator a petition to review the ballot title. 

(2) 

The petition must be filed within 10 business days after the day upon which the 
Attorney General certifies the ballot title to the Secretary of State, or the Legislative Assembly 
files the ballot title with the Secretary of State.  If a petition is mailed to the Administrator in 
compliance with ORAP 1.35(1), then the petition is deemed filed when mailed; otherwise, a 
petition is deemed filed when actually received by the Administrator. 

(3) 

The form of the petition shall comply with ORAP 7.10 governing motions. The 

petition shall have a title page containing: 
 

(a) 

 
petitioner and the Attorney General is designated as the respondent. 

A case title in which the party petitioning for review is designated as the 

(b) 

The title "Petition to Review Ballot Title Certified by the Attorney 

 
General" or "Petition to Review Ballot Title Certified by the Legislative Assembly," as 
the case may be. 

(c) 

The date the ballot title was certified. 

(d) 

The chief petitioner referred to in ORS 250.045. 

(e) 

The litigant contact information required by ORAP 1.30. 

(4) 

The body of the petition shall be no longer than 10 pages and: 

(a) 

Shall state the petitioner's interest in the matter, whether the petitioner is 

 
an elector, and whether the petitioner timely submitted written comments on the draft 
ballot title. 

(b) 

Shall include the reason the ballot title does not substantially comply with 

the requirements of ORS 250.035, and a request that the Supreme Court certify to the 
Secretary of State a ballot title that complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035 in 
lieu of the ballot title challenged by petitioner or refer the ballot title to the Attorney 
General for modification. 

(c)  May include under the heading "Arguments and Authorities" legal 

 
arguments and citation of legal authorities. 

(a) 

(5) 
The petition shall have attached to it a copy of the ballot title as certified 
to or filed with the Secretary of State and containing the full text of the ballot title and a 
photocopy of the text of the measure as submitted to the Secretary of State. 

(b) 

The petition shall show proof of service on the Attorney General,1 as well 
 
as any chief petitioner who did not file the petition to review the ballot title and proof of 
written notification to the Secretary of State that the petition has been filed.

(c) 

The original petition shall be filed.  The petition shall be accompanied by 

the filing fee required for an original proceeding in the Supreme Court. 
 
(6) 

The Attorney General has seven business days after the filing of the petition, 

 
unless a shorter time is ordered by the court, to: 
 

(a) 

File the draft ballot title, the certified ballot title, the Attorney General's 

 
letter of transmittal to the Secretary of State and, if not overly lengthy, written comments 
received by the Secretary of State concerning the draft ballot title.  In addition, the 
Attorney General may provide the court with the text of the certified ballot title, and any 
subsequent modified ballot title, by electronic mail. 

(b) 

File an answering memorandum.  If the Attorney General claims that text 

as contained in the petition is in error, the Attorney General must file an answering 
memorandum pointing out the discrepancy; otherwise, the Attorney General may submit 
a letter waiving the filing of an answering memorandum.  Any answering memorandum 
must be in the form prescribed by ORAP 7.10 for answers to motions and may not be 
longer than 10 pages, except that when the court has consolidated review of more than 
one petition to review a ballot title in one proceeding, the length of the answering 
memorandum may be increased by five pages per each additional petition.  The Attorney 
General must file the original answering memorandum, with proof of service on counsel 
for the petitioner.  The answering memorandum may set forth concisely the reasons why 
the Attorney General believes the ballot title filed with the Secretary of State 
substantially complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035 or, alternatively, may 
suggest alterations that in the Attorney General's judgment would make the ballot title 
substantially comply.  The answering memorandum may also contain under separate 
heading legal arguments and citation to legal authorities. 

   

   

(7) 

Any person who is interested in a ballot title that is the subject of a petition, 

including the chief petitioner of a measure, may file a motion in the form prescribed by ORAP 
7.10, asking leave of the Supreme Court to submit a memorandum as an amicus curiae.  The 
motion must be accompanied by the proposed memorandum that the amicus curiae intends to 
submit.  The proposed memorandum must be in the form prescribed by ORAP 7.10 for answers 
to motions and may not be longer than 10 pages.  The motion and proposed memorandum must 
be filed and served on or before the date that the answering memorandum is due.  If a party seeks 
to appear as an amicus curiae after the Attorney General has filed a modified ballot title after 
referral from the Supreme Court, then the motion and memorandum must be filed with and 
actually received by the Administrator and must be served on and actually received by all parties 
within five business days after the date that a party has filed an objection. 

(8) 

The petitioner has five business days after the filing of the answering 

memorandum, unless a shorter time is ordered by the court, to file a reply memorandum. Any 
reply memorandum must be in the form prescribed by ORAP 7.10 for answers to motions and 
must not be longer than five pages.  The petitioner must file the original reply memorandum, 
with proof of service on the Attorney General.

(9) 

After the filing of all memoranda permitted, the Supreme Court will consider the 
matter without the filing of briefs or presentation of oral argument unless otherwise ordered by 
the court, either on its own motion or on request of a party.  If the court orders oral argument, the 
petitioner shall argue first.  Unless otherwise ordered by the court, an amicus curiae may not 
participate in oral argument. 
 

(a) 

For ballot title review proceedings in which the Supreme Court has 

(10) 
referred the Attorney General's certified ballot title to the Attorney General for 
modification, the Attorney General must prepare a modified ballot title.  The modified 
ballot title must be filed with and actually received by the Administrator, and it must be 
served on and actually received by all parties, within five business days after the date of 
the referral. 

(b) 

The petitioner, or an intervenor under paragraph (10)(c), may file an 

 
objection to the modified ballot title within five business days after the date of filing of 
the modified ballot title.  An objection or proposed objection under paragraph (10)(c) 
must be in the form prescribed by ORAP 7.10, and it may not exceed 10 pages.  The 
objection or proposed objection must be filed with and actually received by the 
Administrator within the time required.  The objection or proposed objection must be 
served on and actually received by all parties within five business days after the date of 
filing of the modified ballot title.  The objection or proposed objection may be filed and 
served by telephonic facsimile communication as provided by ORAP 7.35(3).2  A party 
may file a response to the objection or proposed objection within five business days after 
the date of  filing of the objection, unless the court otherwise directs. 

(c) 

A person who submitted written comments to the Secretary of State under 

 
ORS 250.067 regarding the original ballot title, or the chief petitioner, may seek to 
intervene as a party to object to a modified ballot title when the Supreme Court has 
referred the Attorney General's certified ballot title to the Attorney General for 
modification.  The person must file a motion to intervene, together with a proposed 
objection to the modified ballot title, within five business days after the date the modified 
ballot title has been filed.  The motion and proposed objection must comply with the 
filing and service requirements prescribed by paragraph (10)(b).  The proposed objection 
may assert only that the modifications by the Attorney General themselves have caused 
the modified ballot title to not comply substantially with the requirements of ORS 
250.035. 

(a) 

If the Supreme Court issues a dispositional decision in which the court 

(11) 
dismisses the petition, certifies the Attorney General's certified ballot title or certifies the 
Attorney General's modified ballot title, with or without additional modification, the 
Administrator will issue the appellate judgment on the next judicial day after the filing 
date of the decision. 

(b) 

 
Attorney General for modification or refers the Attorney General's modified ballot title to

modified ballot title, then the Supreme Court will certify the modified ballot title, and the 
Administrator will issue the appellate judgment, on the next judicial day after the time for 
filing an objection expires.

The court's decision shall become effective in accordance with ORAP 

14.05(2)(c).

clear and that the petitioner desires the Supreme Court to certify to the Secretary of State in lieu 
of the explanatory statement challenged by the petitioner. 

(4) 

The answering memorandum shall set forth concisely the reasons why the 

explanatory statement challenged is sufficient and clear or, alternatively, may suggest alterations 
that would make the explanatory statement sufficient and clear.  The answering memorandum is

defendant filing a notice of appeal. 

(2) 

If, in addition to a conviction for aggravated murder forming the basis for the 

death sentence, a defendant is convicted of one or more charges arising from the same charging 
instrument, the Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction to review any such conviction without the 
filing of a notice of appeal. 

(3) 

Immediately after entry of the judgment of conviction and sentence of death, the 

trial court administrator shall prepare a packet consisting of the following: 
 

(a) 

A copy of the judgment of conviction.

(4) 

The trial court administrator shall serve a true copy of the packet on the defendant 

and on each attorney and the transcript coordinator.  The trial court administrator shall endorse 
proof of service on the original of the packet and send the original to the Administrator, who 
shall immediately notify the Chief Justice of receipt thereof. 
 

(a) 

Service of a copy of the packet on the transcript coordinator shall be 

(5) 
deemed to be authorization for the transcript coordinator to arrange for preparation of a 
transcript of all parts of the criminal proceeding, including all pretrial hearings and 
selection of the jury. 

163                                                          Chapter 12

defendant serves and files the defendant's opening brief. 

(c) 

 
brief, which shall be due 90 days after the state serves and files its answering brief. 

If the defendant has filed an opening brief, the defendant may file a reply 

(d) 

Specifications for briefs shall be those set forth in ORAP 5.05, except that 

 
the maximum length of a brief without obtaining leave of the court for a longer brief is 
28,000 words or, if the certification under ORAP 5.05(2)(d) certifies that the preparer 
does not have access to a word-processing system that provides a word count, 100 pages. 

(7) 

Notwithstanding UTCR 6.120(1), the trial court administrator shall send the trial 

court file and exhibits to the Administrator.

164                                                          Chapter 12 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

   

   

   

defendant of the right to be represented by counsel and the procedure for notifying the court if 
the defendant has retained counsel or for requesting court-appointed counsel.  The letter shall be 
copied to the defendant's trial attorney, the Solicitor General of the Department of Justice, the 
Office of Public Defense Services, and the transcript coordinator.  

(2) 

If the defendant or the defendant's attorney gives notice to the Administrator that 
the defendant is represented by retained counsel on appeal, the retained attorney shall be shown 
as the attorney of record.  

(3) 

If the defendant requests appointment of counsel and establishes eligibility for 

appointed counsel, the court shall appoint the Office of Public Defense Services.  If the 
defendant does not respond within 28 days to the letter informing the defendant of the right to be 
represented by counsel and it appears from the record that the defendant is indigent, the court 
shall appoint the Office of Public Defense Services. 
 

(a) 

Should defendant object at any time to particular court-appointed counsel, 

(4) 
a motion for substitution of counsel or appointment of legal advisor shall be made in

Rule 12.15 
COORDINATION OF CLASS ACTIONS 
IN TRIAL COURTS 

The practice and procedure for coordination of class actions in circuit court shall be as 

follows: 

(1) 

A motion filed pursuant to ORCP 32 K shall set forth the grounds for 

coordination and may be accompanied by an affidavit.  Service by mail shall be made on all 
counsel and the trial court administrators of the courts where the cases are pending.  If the 
motion is filed by a party, the presiding judge shall allow or deny it within 10 days.  If the 
motion is allowed, the presiding judge shall immediately request the Supreme Court to assign a 
judge to determine whether coordination is appropriate and to forward to the Supreme Court a 
copy of the motion and of the papers filed in support and in opposition to the motion. 

(2) 

The Supreme Court will assign a judge, pursuant to ORCP 32 K(1)(a), within 

seven days after receiving a request for the assignment, and shall notify by mail all counsel and

trial court administrators of the identity and address of the assigned judge.  The Supreme Court 
shall forward to the assigned judge copies of all papers accompanying the request for 
appointment. 

(3)  Within 14 days after the Supreme Court designates the assigned judge, any party 

may file a memorandum in favor of coordination and serve it on all counsel.  Any party may 
serve and file a memorandum in opposition to coordination within 21 days after the Supreme 
Court designates the assigned judge.  The assigned judge may take testimony and hear oral 
argument on the issue of coordination.  Within 28 days after being designated by the Supreme 
Court, the assigned judge shall determine which, if any, cases are to be coordinated and, if any 
are coordinated, recommend the court in which they shall proceed. 

(4) 

In the absence of a stay order, a case which is being considered for coordination 

may proceed as if no motion for coordination had been filed, but no trial shall be commenced 
and no judgment shall be entered in that action. 

(5) 

If the assigned judge orders coordination, the judge shall send a copy of the order 

to the Chief Justice and to all counsel and the trial court administrators of the respective trial 
courts.  The Chief Justice shall sign an order within 14 days designating a trial judge and the 
court where the coordinated cases will proceed and shall serve all counsel and trial court 
administrators with a copy of the order.  An order coordinating the cases shall operate as a stay 
of all proceedings in the coordinated cases except as otherwise permitted by the trial judge 
designated to hear them.  If the assigned judge denies coordination, the judge shall send a copy 
of the order to the Chief Justice and to all counsel and the trial court administrators of the 
respective trial courts. 

(6) 

The trial judge designated to hear the coordinated cases shall have full power to 

control pleadings, discovery, notices, conferences, hearings, and the schedule of the trial or trials 
in any manner the judge deems appropriate with due consideration to the convenience of the 
witnesses, parties, and counsel, efficient judicial administration, and the ends of justice.  The trial 
judge may decoordinate all or some or one of the cases and may order any issue tried separately. 
The trial judge shall pass on motions filed under ORCP 32 K(3) to include an additional case or 
cases. 

(7) 

On a showing of good cause, any time limit in this rule may be extended for a 
period not exceeding seven days by the judge before whom the issue of coordination is then 
pending.

167                                                          Chapter 12 
 

The procedure for certifying a question of law to the Supreme Court under ORS 28.200 

through 28.255 shall be as follows: 
 

(a) 

(1) 
The certification order shall set forth the question of law sought to be 
answered and a statement of facts relevant to the question, including the nature of the 
controversy in which the question arose.  The statement of facts may be a brief, 
memorandum, or other material from the file of the certifying court if it contains the 
relevant facts and shows the nature of the controversy. 

(b) 

The certification order shall be signed by the presiding judge and 
forwarded to the Supreme Court by the certifying court's clerk of court or court 
administrator accompanied by a copy of the court's register of the case.  If the certifying 
court's register does not show the names and addresses of the parties or their attorneys, 
the court clerk or administrator shall separately provide that information. 

(2) 

The filing and first appearance fees in the Supreme Court shall be equally divided 

between the parties unless otherwise ordered by the certifying court in its order of certification. 
The fees shall be collected when the parties file their stipulated or separate designations of 
record, as provided in subsection (5) of this rule. 

(3) 

The Supreme Court will consider whether to accept a question certified to it 
without oral or written argument from the parties unless otherwise directed by the Supreme 
Court. 

(4) 

The Administrator shall send a copy of the court's order accepting or declining to 

accept a certified question of law to the certifying court and to the parties. 
 

(a) 

If the court accepts certification of a question of law, the parties to the 

(5) 
certified question shall attempt to agree on a designation of the part of the record of the 
certifying court necessary to a determination of the question.  If the parties are unable to 
agree on a designation of record, each party may file a separate designation of record. 

(b) 

A stipulated designation of record or the parties' separate designations of 

record shall be filed within 14 days after the date of the court's order accepting 
certification. 

(c) 

On receipt of a stipulated designation or separate designations of record, 

the Administrator shall request from the certifying court's clerk of court or court 
administrator the part or parts of the record as designated, and any parts of the record that 
the Supreme Court determines may be necessary in answering the certified question(s).  
The Administrator shall serve a copy of the request on the parties.

(a) 

Unless otherwise ordered by the Supreme Court, the certified question of 

(6) 
law shall be briefed by the parties.  The proponent of the question certified to the court 
shall file the opening brief and any other party may file an answering brief.  If the nature 
of the question is such that no party is the proponent of the question, the plaintiff or 
appellant shall file the opening brief and the defendant, respondent, or appellee shall file 
the answering brief. 

(b) 

The opening brief shall be served and filed within 28 days after the date 

the Administrator requests the record from the certifying court.  The answering brief shall 
be served and filed within 28 days after the date the opening brief is served and filed. The 
reply brief, if any, is due within 14 days of the date the answering brief is served and 
filed.  

(c) 

As nearly as practicable, briefs shall be prepared as provided in ORAP 

5.05 through 5.52, except that, in lieu of assignments of error, the brief shall address each 
certified question accepted by the court. 

   

   

(7) 

The case will be set for oral argument as soon as practicable after the parties' 

briefs are filed. 

(8) 

The court shall issue a written decision stating the law governing the question 

certified.  Unless specifically ordered by the Supreme Court, costs will not be allowed to either 
party.  The Administrator shall send to the parties copies of the court's decision at the time the 
decision is issued. 

(9) 

Petitions for reconsideration of the court's decision shall be subject to ORAP 9.25. 

After expiration of the period for filing a petition for reconsideration or after disposition of all 
petitions for reconsideration, the Administrator shall send a copy of the decision under seal of the 
Supreme Court to the certifying court and shall send copies thereof to the parties.  Issuance of a 
sealed copy of the court's decision to the certifying court terminates the Supreme Court case.

copies of the record, except exhibits, on all other parties of record in the proceeding and on any 
other person required by law to be served. 
 

(a) 

Petitioner's opening brief and excerpt of record shall be served and filed 

(3) 
not later than 14 days after the filing of the petition for judicial review.  Failure to file the 
opening brief within the prescribed time will result in automatic dismissal of the petition.

Rule 13.05 
COSTS AND DISBURSEMENTS 

170                                                          Chapter 13 
 

(1) 

As used in this rule, "costs" includes costs and disbursements.  "Allowance" of 
costs refers to the determination by the court that a party is entitled to claim costs.  "Award" of 
costs is the determination by the court of the amount that a party who has been allowed costs is 
entitled to recover.1 

(2) 

The court will designate a prevailing party and determine whether the prevailing 

party is allowed costs at the time that the court issues its decision. 

(3)  When an allowance of costs is dependent on identification of a party as a 
prevailing party, the appellant or petitioner (or cross-appellant or cross-petitioner, as appropriate) 
is the prevailing party only if the court reverses or substantially modifies the judgment or order 
from which the appeal or judicial review was taken.  Otherwise, the respondent (or cross-
respondent, as appropriate) is the prevailing party. 

(4)  When a party prevails on appeal or on review and the case is remanded for further 

proceedings in which the party who ultimately will prevail remains to be determined, the court 
may allow costs to abide the outcome of the case.  If the court allows costs to abide the outcome 
of the case, the prevailing party shall claim its costs within the time and in the manner prescribed 
in this rule.  The appellate court may determine the amount of costs under this subsection, and 
may condition the actual award of costs on the ultimate outcome of the case.  In that 
circumstance, the award of costs shall not be included in the appellate judgment, but shall be 
awarded by the court or tribunal on remand in favor of the prevailing party on appeal or review, 
if that party also prevails on remand, and shall be awarded against the party designated on appeal 
or review as the party liable for costs. 
 

(a) 

A party seeking to recover costs shall file a statement of costs and 

(5) 
disbursements within 21 days after the date of the decision.  The filing of a petition for 
review or a petition for reconsideration does not suspend the time for filing the statement 
of costs and disbursements. 

(b) 

A party must file the original statement of costs and disbursements, 

accompanied by proof of service showing that a copy of the statement was served on 
every other party to the appeal. 

(c) 

A party objecting to a statement of costs and disbursements shall file 

objections within 14 days after the date of service of the statement.  A reply, if any, shall 
be filed within 14 days after the date of service of the objections.  The original objection 
or reply shall be filed with proof of service. 

(a) 

(i) Except as provided in paragraph (ii) of this subsection, whether a brief 

   

   

6) 

  (

 

   

   

   

   

is printed or reproduced by other methods, the party allowed costs is entitled to recover 
10 cents per page for the number of briefs required to be filed or actually filed, whichever 
is less, plus two copies for each party served and two copies for each party on whose 
behalf the brief was filed. 

(ii) 

If a party filed a brief using the eFiling system, the party allowed 

costs is entitled to recover the amount of the transaction charge and any document 
recovery charge* incurred by that party for electronically filing the brief, as 
provided in subsection (b) of this section.  The party allowed costs is not entitled 
to recover for the service copy of any brief served on a party via the eFiling 
system, but is entitled to recover for two copies for each party served 
conventionally. 
 
(b) 

If the party who has been allowed costs has incurred transaction charges or 

 
any document recovery charges* in connection with electronically filing any document, 
the party is entitled to recover any such charge so incurred. 

(c) 

If the prevailing party who has been allowed costs has paid for copies of 

audio or video tapes in lieu of a transcript or incident to preparing a transcript, the party is 
entitled to recover any such charge so incurred. 
 

(i) 

For the purposes of awarding the prevailing party fee under ORS 

(d) 
20.190(1)(a), an appeal to the Court of Appeals and review by the Supreme Court 
shall be considered as one continuous appeal process and only one prevailing 
party fee per party, or parties appearing jointly, shall be awarded. 

(ii) 

The prevailing party fee will be awarded only to a party who has 

appeared on the appeal or review. 

(iii)  A prevailing party is not entitled to claim more than one prevailing 

party fee, nor may the court award more than one prevailing party fee against a 
nonprevailing party, regardless of the number of parties in the action.2 

(e) 

If a prevailing party who has been allowed costs timely files a statement of 

costs and disbursements and no objections are filed, the court will award costs in the 
amount claimed, except when the entity from whom costs are sought is not a party to the 
proceeding or when the court is without authority to award particular costs claimed. 

(f) 

If a prevailing party who has been allowed costs untimely files a statement 

of costs and disbursements, that party is entitled to recover the party's filing or first 
appearance fee and the prevailing party fee under ORS 20.190(1). 

(g) 

If a prevailing party who has been allowed costs does not file a statement 

of costs and disbursements, the court shall award that party's filing or first appearance fee 
and the prevailing party fee under ORS 20.190(1) as part of the appellate judgment.

Rule 13.10 
PETITION FOR ATTORNEY FEES 

(1) 

This rule governs the procedure for petitioning for attorney fees in all cases 

except the recovery of compensation and expenses of court-appointed counsel payable from the 
Public Defense Services Account.1 

(2) 

A petition for attorney fees shall be served and filed within 21 days after the date 
of decision.  The filing of a petition for review or a petition for reconsideration does not suspend 
the time for filing the petition for attorney fees. 

(3)  When a party prevails on appeal or on review and the case is remanded for further 

proceedings in which the party who ultimately will prevail remains to be determined, the 
appellate court may condition the actual award of attorney fees on the ultimate outcome of the 
case.  In that circumstance, an award of attorney fees shall not be included in the appellate 
judgment, but shall be awarded by the court or tribunal on remand in favor of the prevailing 
party on appeal or review, if that party also prevails on remand, and shall be awarded against the 
party designated on appeal or review as the party liable for attorney fees.  The failure of a party 
on appeal or on review to petition for an award of attorney fees under this subsection is not a 
waiver of that party's right later to petition on remand for fees incurred on appeal and review if 
that party ultimately prevails on remand. 

(a) 

A petition shall state the total amount of attorney fees claimed and the 

5) 
authority relied on for claiming the fees.  The petition shall be supported by a statement 
of facts showing the total amount of attorney time involved, the amount of time devoted 
to each task, the reasonableness of the amount of time claimed, the hourly rate at which 
time is claimed, and the reasonableness of the hourly rate. 

(b) 

If a petition requests attorney fees pursuant to a statute, the petition shall 
address any factors, including, as relevant, those factors identified in ORS 20.075(1) and 

  (

   

(4)  When the Supreme Court denies a petition for review, a petition for attorney fees 

for preparing a response to the petition for review may be filed in the Supreme Court.

(2) or ORS 20.105(1), that the court may consider in determining whether and to what 
extent to award attorney fees.2 

(6) 

Objections to a petition shall be served and filed within 14 days after the date the 
petition is filed. A reply, if any, shall be served and filed within 14 days after the date of service 
of the objections. 

(7) 

A party to a proceeding under this rule may request findings regarding the facts 

and legal criteria that relate to any claim or objection concerning attorney fees.  A party 
requesting findings must state in the caption of the petition, objection, or reply that the party is 
requesting findings pursuant to this rule.3  A party's failure to request findings in a petition, 
objection, or reply in the form specified in this rule constitutes a waiver of any objection to the 
absence of findings to support the court's decision. 

(8) 

The original of any petition, objections, or reply shall be filed with the 

Administrator together with proof of service on all other parties to the appeal, judicial review, or 
proceeding. 

(9) 

In the absence of timely filed objections to a petition under this rule, the Supreme 
Court and the Court of Appeals, respectively, will allow attorney fees in the amount sought in the 
petition, except in cases in which: 
 

(a) 

The entity from whom fees are sought was not a party to the proceeding; 

(b) 

The Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals is without authority to award 

________ 
1 This subsection does not create a substantive right to attorney fees, but merely prescribes the 
procedure for claiming and determining attorney fees under the circumstances described in this 
subsection. 

 See, e.g., Tyler v. Hartford Insurance Group, 307 Or 603, 771 P2d 274 (1989), and Matizza v. 
Foster, 311 Or 1, 803 P2d 723 (1990), with respect to ORS 20.105(1), and McCarthy v. Oregon

(2) 

The person who submitted the payment request shall take an appeal by filing a 
motion for review of the executive director's decision in the court in which all or a majority of 
compensation and expenses were incurred.  The person shall accompany the motion with a copy 
of the request for payment as submitted to the Public Defense Services Commission and a copy 
of the executive director's disposition of the request.  The person shall serve a copy of the motion 
on the executive director of the Public Defense Services Commission and shall include with the 
motion proof of service on the executive director.

provided in ORAP 13.10.  A request for damages, attorney fees, and reasonable expenses should 
not be included in the party's brief. 

(2) 

A motion for reasonable expenses (including attorney fees) under ORAP 1.40(4) 

and ORCP 17 D based on the filing of a motion or thing shall be included in the answer or 
objection to the motion, statement of costs and disbursements, or petition for attorney fees to 
which the motion for sanctions relates. 

Rule 13.30 
REQUESTS FOR JUDGMENT AGAINST SURETIES 

(1) 

A party entitled to judgment against a surety under ORS 19.450(4) shall file with 

the Administrator and serve on the other parties to the appeal and on the surety a notice 
requesting entry of judgment as part of the appellate judgment.  The notice shall identify the 
party in whose favor judgment will be entered, the surety against whom judgment will be 
entered, the amount of the judgment, the rate of interest and the date from which interest will 
run. In the absence of an indication otherwise, the interest will be simple, at nine percent per 
annum, from the date of entry of the appellate judgment.

________ 
See generally ORS 19.450 regarding appellate judgments in appeals from circuit court and Tax 
Court.  A party considering petitioning the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari 
with respect to an Oregon appellate court decision should review carefully 28 USC § 2101(c) 
and the United States Supreme Court Rules, currently US Sup Ct Rule 13, to determine the event 
that triggers the running of the time period within which to file the petition.  See also 
International Brotherhood v. Oregon Steel Mills, Inc., 180 Or App 265, 44 P3d 600 (2002) 
(majority, concurring, and dissenting opinions). 

Rule 14.10 
STAY PENDING ACTION BY THE 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 

(1) 

A party may file a motion requesting a stay of the issuance of the appellate 
judgment, a stay of the enforcement of the appellate judgment, or a recall of the appellate 
judgment pending the filing of a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the 
United States.1  The motion must show that the certiorari petition would present a substantial 
question and that there is good cause for a stay. 

The motion shall be addressed to and acted upon by: 
 
(a) 

the Court of Appeals when the Oregon Supreme Court has denied review 

 
of a Court of Appeals decision; 

the Oregon Supreme Court in all other instances. 

(b) 
 
The stay will automatically terminate in 90 days, unless: 
 
(a) 

 

(b) 

The appellate court extends the period for good cause shown, or 
 
The party who obtained the stay files a petition for a writ of certiorari with 

 
the United States Supreme Court and so notifies the Appellate Court Administrator in 
writing within the period of the stay.  In that case, the stay will continue until the final 
disposition by the United States Supreme Court.

(a) 

 
The procedures in this rule apply to cases filed in the Court of Appeals. 
The Chief Judge or the Chief Judge's designee shall determine the individual cases or 
categories of cases that may be included or excluded from the appellate settlement 
conference program (program).  Upon the court's own motion, at any time, a panel of the 
Court of Appeals may refer a case to the program. 
 

(i) 

A settlement conference shall be held for any case assigned to the 

(b) 
program unless the program director or the court cancels the conference or 
removes the case from the program.  A party or person with actual authority to 
settle the case must be present at the program settlement conference unless that 
person's absence or appearance by telephone is approved prior to the conference 
by the program director. 

(ii) 

After the first settlement conference is held, any party may 

withdraw from the program, except that the program director may require the 
parties to attend one or more additional conferences as the program director 
deems reasonable and necessary to facilitate a settlement.  If the program director 
requires the parties to attend one or more additional conferences, the neutral's fee 
for any additional conference will be paid by the program and not by the parties. 

   

(2) 

Supervising Judge and Program Director 

(a) 

 
appoint a supervising judge and a program director for the program. 

The Chief Judge shall have overall responsibility for the program but may 

(b) 

If a supervising judge is appointed, the supervising judge shall have the 

powers needed to administer the program.  The Chief Judge, and the supervising judge if 
one is appointed, may delegate authority to the program director. 

(c) 

If the Chief Judge, or the supervising judge if one is appointed, serves as a 
judge or judge pro tempore of the Court of Appeals, the Chief Judge or supervising judge 
may not participate in the consideration of any case in which the judge is aware of 
confidential information concerning the case obtained from the program. 

   

   

(d) 

If a judge or judge pro tempore of the Court of Appeals serves as the 

 
neutral in a case and the case does not settle and proceeds in the Court of Appeals, that 
judge shall not thereafter participate in any way in the case.  Further, such judge shall

take steps as necessary to insure that the judge does not disclose to other judges or to 
court staff any communication from the settlement conference. 

(3) 

Neutrals 

(a) 

The Chief Judge shall determine the responsibilities and qualifications of 

 
neutrals to be provided by the program and shall approve the neutrals selected for the 
program. The supervising judge, if one is appointed, or program director will assign 
neutrals for individual cases. 

(b) 

A neutral shall not act in any other capacity in the case. 

(4) 

Abeyance of Appeal 

(i) 

On assignment of a case to the program, the court will hold 

(a) 
preparation of the transcript (including correcting it or adding to it), preparation of 
the record, and briefing, in abeyance for a period of 120 days after the date of the 
notice of assignment of the case to the program.  During that time, a party to the 
appeal may file an amended designation of record.  A party wishing to hold in 
abeyance any other aspect of the appeal or seeking an extension of time to 
complete any other task required by law or by the Oregon Rules of Appellate 
Procedure must file an appropriate motion with the court. 

(ii) 

At the end of the 120-day abeyance period, if the parties have 

engaged in settlement negotiations and need more time to reduce the settlement to 
writing or to implement a settlement, any party may request the program director 
to order, and the program director may order, an extension of the abeyance period 
for up to 60 days.  If all parties to an appeal agree to an extension for longer than 
60 days, the program director may extend the abeyance period for as long as 
reasonably necessary to implement a settlement. 

(b) 

If a respondent files a motion to dismiss the appeal or an appellant files a 
motion to stay enforcement of the judgment when the case is being held in abeyance, in 
addition to serving a copy of the motion on all other parties to the appeal, the party shall 
serve a copy of the motion on the program director accompanied by a letter of transmittal 
stating whether the party prefers that the motion be decided before the case proceeds in 
the program.  The program director may direct that the case proceed in the program or 
may terminate the referral.  If the program director terminates the referral, the case may 
be re-referred to the program after the court disposes of the motion to stay enforcement or 
denies the motion to dismiss. 

(c) 

The program director may reactivate a case held in abeyance at any time: 

(i) 

On the program director's own motion; or 

(ii) 

On motion of a party showing good cause for reactivating the

appeal.  In addition to serving a copy of the motion on all other parties to the 
appeal, a party filing a motion to reactivate shall serve a copy of the motion on the 
program director. 

 
(5) 

Submission of Information 

The parties may be required to submit information to facilitate the screening of cases for 
the program or the program settlement conference.  The parties shall submit this information in a 
timely manner to the program director or the neutral as designated in the request.  Each party 
also shall submit the requested information to the other parties, with the exception of material 
that is designated by the party as confidential, which shall be treated by the program director or 
the neutral as confidential pursuant to subsection (6) of this rule. 

181                                                          Chapter 15 

 

(a) 

The Appellate Settlement Conference Program is a "mediation program," 

 
as defined in ORS 36.110(8), and the provisions of ORS 36.100 to 36.238 apply to the 
program, including the provisions of ORS 36.220 providing that "mediation 
communications," as defined in ORS 36.110(7), are confidential.  For purposes of the 
program, "mediation," which is defined in ORS 36.110(5), begins when an appeal is 
referred to the program and ends when the program director removes the appeal from the 
program, or when the court dismisses the appeal, whichever occurs first. 

(b) 

All materials submitted to the supervising judge or to the neutral and all 

materials created by the supervising judge or the neutral that pertain to a program 
settlement conference and are not a part of the record on appeal shall be maintained 
separately from the record of the case.  These materials shall not be subject to disclosure, 
except as the law may require or as the parties and the supervising judge may all agree. 
The materials referred to in this paragraph shall be destroyed at the time and in the 
manner prescribed by the policy adopted by the program director pursuant to the Task 
Force on Records Retention. 

(c) 

The supervising judge or program director may request the parties or the 

neutral or both to provide oral and written evaluations of the case settlement process.  
The materials referred to in paragraph (6)(b) of this rule, and oral and written evaluations 
of the case settlement process, may be used to evaluate the program.  Any evaluation of 
the program, whether disseminated to the appellate courts or to the public, shall not 
disclose specific case identifying information.

For the purposes of this paragraph, multiple parties who are represented by 

 
the same attorney or attorneys shall be deemed to be a single party.  Except as provided

program shall pay the initial program fee prescribed in this subsection.  Each party shall 
pay the initial program fee directly to the neutral or, if instructed by the program director,

to the State Court Administrator.  Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this subsection, 
each party shall pay the initial program fee no later than the date of the first settlement 
conference.  Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, the neutral, and the program  
director, each party to a general civil or domestic relations appeal must pay an initial 
program fee of $350, and each party to a workers' compensation appeal must pay an 
initial program fee of $150.  In all other appeals, the parties, neutral, and program 
director shall agree on the fees. 
 

(i) 

The initial program fee shall cover up to one hour of neutral 

(b) 
preparation time and up to five hours of settlement conference time whether or 
not the settlement conference involves more than one session. 

(ii) 

In unusual cases, if the neutral reasonably needs more than one 
hour of preparation time, the neutral may contact the program director and the 
program director may contact the parties to discuss whether to exclude the 
additional preparation time from the initial program fee. 

(iii) 

If the parties agree to extend the settlement conference beyond the 
initial  five hours, the parties shall compensate the neutral for any additional time 
that is expended and recorded by the neutral, with the total cost of the additional 
time being shared equally by the parties.  The rate shall be $150 per hour, unless 
otherwise agreed to by the parties, the neutral, and the program director. 

   

   

(c) 

If an individual or entity who is not a party to the appeal participates in the 

settlement conference as part of an attempt to reach a global resolution of a dispute or 
disputes outside the scope of the appeal but involving some or all of the parties to the 
appeal, the program director may require each such individual or entity to pay the 
program fees prescribed in paragraph (a) of this subsection. 

(d) 

The Chief Judge or the Chief Judge's designee may waive or defer 
payment of program fees on motion of a party based on a showing that the party is 
financially unable to pay the fees without substantial economic hardship in providing 
basic economic necessities to the party or the party's dependent family.  If liability for 
payment of a party's share of program fees is waived or deferred, that party's portion of 
program fees shall be paid by the program from funds appropriated for that purpose. 

(e)  When a settlement conference is conducted by a neutral, an administrative 

law judge, "Plan B" retired judge, or other person who does not accept a fee for the 
services, the parties shall make the program fees payable to the State Court 
Administrator, reference the case name and number, and mail it to:  Appellate Settlement 
Conference Program, 1163 State Street, Salem, OR 97301-2563. 

(f) 

A party whose program fees are deferred and who has not paid the fees by 
the conclusion of the settlement conference shall remain liable for the unpaid fees, unless 
the fees are waived following completion of the settlement conference.  If a party's 
program fees have been paid by the program and the party thereafter pays the fees, the

fees shall be paid to the program as provided in paragraph (e) of this subsection. 

(8) 

Actions Are Not Reviewable 

Except as necessary to decide a motion for sanctions under subsection (9) of this rule, the 
actions of a neutral, a program director, or a supervising judge shall not be reviewed by the Court 
of Appeals or by the Supreme Court. 

At the request of the program director, the court may impose sanctions against a party, or 

counsel for a party, or both, for the failure of the party, or counsel, or both to perform any act 
required by this rule or by the written policies of the Appellate Settlement Conference Program. 
Sanctions include but are not necessarily limited to monetary assessments and dismissal of the 
appeal.

(1) 

 
Any document filed via the eFiling system must be in a Portable Document

seeking approval or application to appear amicus curiae, rather than being submitted as a 
supporting document attached to the motion.  For each electronic filing transaction under 
this paragraph, the eFiler must include the following comments: 
 

(i) 

For the motion seeking approval or application to appear amicus 

 
curiae, a comment that the eFiler is submitting the brief or other document 
through a separate eFiling transaction; and

Rule 16.25 
ELECTRONIC FILING AND ELECTRONIC FILING DEADLINES 

(1) 

Except as provided in subsection (4), the filing deadline for any document filed 

electronically is 11:59:59 p.m. in the time zone in which the court is located on the date by which 
the document must be filed. 

(2) 

The submission of a document electronically by the eFiler and acceptance of the 
document by the court accomplishes electronic filing.  When accepted for filing, the electronic 
document constitutes the court's official record of the document. 
 

(a) 

The court considers a document received when the eFiling system receives 

(3) 
the document.  The eFiling system will send an email that includes the date and time of 
receipt to the eFiler's email address, and to any other email address provided by the 
eFiler, to confirm that the eFiling system received the document. 

(b)  When the court accepts the document for filing, the eFiling system will 

affix to the document the time of day, the day of the month, the month, and the year that 
the eFiling system received the document.  The date and time of filing entered in the 
register relate back to the date and time that the eFiling system received the document.  
The eFiling system will send an email that includes the date and time of acceptance to the 
eFiler's email address and to any other email address provided by the eFiler.  If the 
document was electronically served by the eFiling system pursuant to ORAP 16.45,1 the

date of service will also relate back to the date that the eFiling system received the 
document. 

(a) 

As used in this subsection, "temporary unavailability" means the eFiling 

4) 
system is temporarily unavailable or an error in the transmission of the document or other 
technical problem prevents the eFiling system from receiving the document.  A 
"temporary unavailability" does not include a problem with the eFiler’s equipment or 
software, or other problem within the eFiler’s control. 

(b)  When a party is unable to use the eFiling system because of a temporary 

unavailability, the party may file and serve the document as provided in subparagraph (i) 
or (ii) of this paragraph. 
 

(i) 

The party may conventionally file and serve the document.  If the 

 
party conventionally files and serves the document by the end of the next business 
day following the cessation of the temporary unavailability, together with 
satisfactory proof of the temporary unavailability, the filing and service date 
relates back to the date the party attempted to eFile the document. 

(ii) 

Upon cessation of the temporary unavailability, the party may use 

 
the eFiling system to file and, except as provided in ORAP 16.45(3), serve the 
document.  If the party files and serves the document using the eFiling system by 
11:59:59 p.m. of the next business day following the cessation of the temporary 
unavailability and submits satisfactory proof of the temporary unavailability, the 
filing and service date relates back to the date the party attempted to eFile the 
document.

(c) 

Paragraph (b) of this subsection does not apply to extend any jurisdictional 

 
time period imposed by statute, including those related to the filing and service of a 
notice of appeal, a petition for judicial review, or any other initiating document.  A 
party's circumstances may require the party to conventionally file and serve an initiating 
document within the time period imposed by statute. 

(d) 

"Satisfactory proof of the temporary unavailability" means a written 

description of the temporary unavailability, together with any supporting documentation, 
satisfactory to the court. 
 
(5) 

Documents Conventionally Filed:  The court may digitize, scan, or otherwise 

 
reproduce a document that is filed conventionally into an electronic record, document, or image.  
The court subsequently may destroy a conventionally filed document in accordance with the 
protocols established by the State Court Administrator under ORS 8.125(11). 

 As provided in ORAP 16.45(3), the eFiling system cannot electronically serve some 
documents.

All eFiled documents must be accompanied by a proof of service under ORAP 
1.35(2)(e).  The proof of service must certify service on all parties regardless of the means by 
which service was accomplished, including eService.  The proof of service must state that 
service was accomplished at the person's email address as recorded on the date of service in the 
eFiling system, and need not include that person's email address or mailing address. 

(5) 

If an eFiled document is not eServed by the eFiling system because of an error in 
the transmission of the document or other technical problem experienced by the eFiler, the court 
may, upon satisfactory proof, permit the service date of the document to relate back to the date 
that the eFiler first attempted to eServe the document.  A party must show satisfactory proof by

HYPERLINKS AND BOOKMARKS IN eFILED BRIEFS 
 

(b) 

The functioning of a hyperlink reference is not guaranteed.  The appellate 
courts neither endorse nor accept responsibility for any product, organization, or content 
at any hyperlinked site. 

   

(1) 

An eFiled document may contain one or more hyperlinks to other parts of the 

 
same document or hyperlinks to a location outside of the document that contains a source 
document for a citation. 
 

(a)  When a party eFiles a brief or other memorandum that is accompanied by 

 
excerpts of record or attachments, the party is encouraged to hyperlink citations to the 
relevant portions of the excerpts or attachments. 

(c) 

A hyperlink to cited authority does not replace standard citation format.  

 
The complete citation must be included within the text of the document.  Neither a 
hyperlink, nor any site to which it refers, shall be considered part of the record.  A 
hyperlink is simply a convenient mechanism for accessing material cited in an eFiled 
document. 
 
(2)  When a party eFiles a brief, the party is encouraged to electronically bookmark 

 
the sections of the brief, excerpt of record, and any appendix using PDF document creation 
software.  The caption of a bookmark should be concise.  The sections of the brief that should be 
bookmarked include the discussion on each assignment of error or question presented on review, 
or the response to any assignment of error or presented question.  The sections of the excerpt of 
record or appendix that should be bookmarked include the judgment, order, or opinion under 
review and any separate findings or determinations that are part of that disposition.

RETENTION OF DOCUMENTS BY eFILERS 
AND CERTIFICATION OF ORIGINAL SIGNATURES 
 

(1) 

 
Unless the court orders otherwise, if an eFiler electronically files an image of a 
document that contains the original signature of a person other than the eFiler, the eFiler must 
retain the document in the eFiler's possession in its original paper form for no less than 30 days.

rule, the eFiler certifies by filing that, to the best of the eFiler's knowledge and after appropriate

16.30, or 

 
16.25. 

(2) 

An active member of the Oregon State Bar required under subsection (1) of this 

rule to file a document using the eFiling system may obtain a waiver of the requirement as 
follows: 
 

 

(a) 

The member must file one of the following: 

(i) 

 
Supreme Court, or both, for a specific period of time; or 

a request for waiver in all cases before the Court of Appeals, or the 

 

(ii) 

a motion in an existing case for waiver in that specific case.  

(b) 

 
for the waiver.  The request or motion may be filed conventionally. 

A request or motion must include an explanation describing good cause 

(c) 

The Administrator is authorized to approve or deny a request filed under 

 
subparagraph (a)(i) of this subsection.  If the court or the Administrator approves a 
request under that subsection, the person must

of the waiver.  

(d) 

If the court grants a motion filed under subparagraph (a)(ii) of this 

 
subsection, the person must include the words "Exempt from eFiling per Waiver Granted 
[DATE]" in the caption of all documents conventionally filed in the case.

in the Administrator’s judgment,  the temporary unavailability is likely to prevent electronic 
filing for a substantial period of time under the circumstances. 
 

(a) 

If the Administrator suspends subsection (1) of this rule, then the 
 
Administrator will strive to provide 24-hour advance notice of the suspension to 
registered eFilers via email and to the public via notice on the Oregon Judicial 
Department's website.  If circumstances make it impractical to provide 24 hours' notice, 
the Administrator will provide as much advance notice as is practical under the 
circumstances. 

(b) 

If the Administrator suspends subsection (1) of this rule under this 

subsection, then an active member of the Oregon State Bar may file the document as 
provided in ORAP 16.25(4).  
 
(4) 

If a filer submits a document for conventional filing in contravention of 

 
subsection (1) of this rule and the filer has not obtained a waiver pursuant to subsection (2) of 
this rule, nor is the electronic system unavailable as described in subsection (3) of this rule, then 
the Administrator is authorized to take any of the following actions:  
 

(a) 

Accept the document for filing and provide notice to the filer that the 

 
Administrator will reject future conventional submissions by the filer that are subject to 
subsection(1) of this rule.  

(b) 

Refuse to accept the document for filing.  

(c) 

Return the document to the filer as unfiled.  

Refer the filing to the court for consideration of sanctions under ORAP

The trial court erred in declining to give defendant's requested menacing instruction on 

the ground that menacing is not a lesser included offense of robbery in the first and second 
degrees. 

Preservation of Error 

. 

  A

At the close of the evidence, defendant submitted a requested instruction on menacing. 

(ER-___.)  By way of memorandum in support of the requested instruction, defendant argued to 
the trial court that menacing is necessarily included in the statutory definition of robbery in the 
first degree (the crime with which defendant was charged) and that the record contained evidence 
from which a jury could find defendant guilty of the lesser charge and not guilty of the greater 
charge.  (ER-___.)  The trial court declined to give the instruction, stating: 
 

"I'm not going to give the requested instruction on menacing.  Menacing is not 
expressly included in the charging instrument and, in my view, is not a statutorily 
lesser-included offense of the crime of robbery because it does not share all of the 
same elements as robbery.  The prosecutor could have charged defendant with 
menacing, but didn't.  And without a match on the elements of the two offenses, a 
lesser-included instruction isn't proper." 

The court reviews the trial court's decision either to give or to decline to give a requested 

jury instruction pursuant to a combination of standards of review.  Regarding review of the 
record to support such an instruction, the court "review[s] the evidence in the light most 
favorable to the establishment of facts that would require those instructions."  State v. Boyce, 120 
Or App 299, 302, 852 P2d 276 (1993).  Whether the language of the statute defining the lesser 
offense is necessarily included in the greater offense is a pure question of law, one that the court 
decides without any particular deference to its resolution below.  See State v. Cunningham, 320 
Or 47, 57, 880 P2d 431 (1994), cert den, 514 US 1005 (1995); State v. Moses, 165 Or App 317, 
319, 997 P2d 251, rev den, 331 Or 334 (2000).

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
