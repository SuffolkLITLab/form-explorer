      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre>The Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court is the administrative head of the 
judicial department of government in this state; shall exercise administrative 
authority and supervision over the courts of this state consistent with applicable 
provisions of law and the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure (ORCP); and, to 
facilitate exercise of that administrative authority and supervision, may make 
rules and issue orders as appropriate or take any other action appropriate to 
perform the functions of the office of Chief Justice; and 

The Chief Justice may delegate the exercise of any powers specified in ORS 
1.002 to the Presiding Judge of a court. 

a. 

. 

  b

ORS 1.171(4) provides that a Presiding Judge may delegate the exercise of any of the 
administrative powers of the Presiding Judge to another judge of the court or to the trial 
court administrator. 

On March 8, 2020, Governor Kate Brown signed Executive Order 20-03, which declared 
a state of emergency because of the threat that the COVID-19 coronavirus posed to 
public health and safety (hereafter, “COVID-19 state of emergency”).  On June 30, 2020, 
Governor Brown signed Executive Order 20-30, which extended Executive Order 20-03 
and the declaration of the COVID-19 state of emergency. 

On March 23, 2020, Governor Brown signed Executive Order 20-12, which ordered 
Oregonians to “Stay Home, Save Lives,” including, to the maximum extent possible, 
staying at home or at their place of residence and otherwise observing social distancing 
that provides a distance of at least 6 feet between individuals.  On May 14, 2020, 
Governor Brown signed Executive Order 20-25, which directed a phased reopening of 
the State of Oregon. 

On March 27, 2020, I issued Amended Chief Justice Order 20-006, which imposed 
amended Level 3 restrictions on operations due to the spread of the COVID-19 virus and 
Governor Kate Brown’s March 8, 2020, declaration of an emergency and her issuance of 
Executive Order 20-12.  On May 15, 2020, I issued Chief Justice Order 20-016, which 
imposed updated Level 3 restrictions, as well as Level 2 restrictions, on court operations 
in light of the Governor’s Executive Order 20-25 and Oregon’s phased reopening. 

The Oregon Legislative Assembly has enacted Oregon Laws 2020, chapter 12, section 
6, which became effective on June 30, 2020.  That legislation authorizes the Chief 
Justice to take certain actions, described in paragraph 7 of my findings below, during the 
COVID-19 state of emergency and continuing for 60 days after the declaration of that

state of emergency or any extension is no longer in effect.  Executive Order 20-03, 
described in paragraph 3 of these findings, declared a COVID-19 state of emergency 
within the meaning of Oregon Laws 2020, chapter 12, and Executive Order 20-30, also 
described in paragraph 3, extended that state of emergency. 

Section 6(1)(a)(B) of Oregon Laws 2020, chapter 12, provides that, during any COVID-
19 state of emergency and continuing for 60 days after the declaration of that state of 
emergency or any extension is no longer in effect, and upon a finding of good cause, the 
Chief Justice may extend or suspend any time period or time requirement established by 
statute or rule that applies to the initiation of an appeal to the Magistrate Division of the 
Oregon Tax Court or an appeal from the Magistrate Division to the Regular Division, or 
applies in any case, action, or proceeding after it is initiated in the Tax Court.  Section 
6(1)(b) of Oregon Laws 2020, chapter 12, further provides that the Chief Justice may 
extend or suspend a time period or time requirement notwithstanding the fact that the 
date of the time period or time requirement has already passed as of the effective date 
of Oregon Laws 2020, chapter 12, section 6. 

For the reasons given by Governor Brown in declaring a COVID-19 state of emergency 
in Executive Order 20-03, and in extending that state of emergency in Executive Order 
20-25, and also for the reasons given in Executive Order 20-12, I find that good cause, 
as that term is used in section 6(1)(a) of Oregon Laws 2020, chapter 12, exists to extend 
statutory time periods and time requirements in certain tax appeals, as provided below. 

 HEREBY ORDER THAT, pursuant to ORS 1.002 and Oregon Laws 2020, chapter 12, 
section 6: 

This order applies to cases subject to the jurisdiction of the Oregon Tax Court and both 
extends and provides authority to extend statutory time periods and time requirements 
during the COVID-19 state of emergency for any appeal, case, or proceeding described 
in paragraph 7 of my findings, and continuing for 60 days after the declaration of that 
state of emergency or any extension is no longer in effect. 

Paragraph 3 of this order applies to the initiation of: 

Any appeal to the Magistrate Division subject to the time periods or time 
requirements imposed by ORS 305.280; 

Any other appeal to the Magistrate Division under any statute that imposes a 
time limitation or time requirement for the commencement of the appeal, 
including but not limited to ORS 305.403, ORS 305.265(10)(d), or ORS chapter 
323; or 

Any appeal of a Magistrate Division decision to the Regular Division subject to 
the time periods or time requirements imposed by ORS 305.501(5)(a) and (7). 

In the Oregon Tax Court, for any time period or time requirement limiting the period for 
commencing appeals described in paragraph 2 of this order: 

All time periods and time requirements are extended during the COVID-19 state 
of emergency and continuing for 60 days after the declaration of that state of 
emergency or any extension is no longer in effect.

If a party failed to comply with a time period or time requirement described in
subparagraph 3.a. of this order before the effective date of this order, but on or
after March 8, 2020, then that time period or time requirement is extended as to
that party as described in subparagraph 3.a., and the court shall not impose a
consequence for such failure to comply.

4.

In the Oregon Tax Court, after the initiation of any case, action, or proceeding, the
following apply:

b.

a.

To any extent not already authorized, for statutory time periods and time
requirements that apply post-case-initiation, the Tax Court Judge may extend
any such period or requirement that applies during the COVID-19 state of
emergency and continuing for 60 days after the declaration of that state of
emergency or any extension is no longer in effect, including by holding cases in
abeyance.  The Tax Court Judge may order such an extension as to any
category of case, action, or proceeding, or any particular case, action, or
proceeding.

b.

Exception on motion of a party

(1)

(2)

If the Tax Court Judge extends a statutory time period or time
requirement under subparagraph 4.a. of this order, a party to the case,
action, or proceeding may file a motion requesting that the Tax Court
Judge impose a reasonable time period or time requirement in lieu of the
extension under subparagraph 4.a.

After the parties have had an opportunity to be heard, the Tax Court
Judge may impose a reasonable time period or time requirement, upon a
determination of a need to proceed, imminent harm, or other good cause.
The reasonable amount of time shall not be less than the time period or
time requirement imposed by statute or Tax Court Rule as determined
without regard to this order.

5.

6.

The Tax Court Judge may delegate authority to take actions under this order.

This order takes effect immediately.  The authority granted by this order terminates 60
days after the declaration of the COVID-19 state of emergency or any extension is no
longer in effect, or on further Chief Justice order, whichever first occurs.

Dated this 21st day of July, 2020.
