Pre-trial Work.  An extern will be involved in reviewing the case file, organizing the facts, and 

identifying questions about issues not fully explained by the parties in documents submitted to the court.  
The extern will have the opportunity to attend case management conferences, status conferences, or 
hearings, and will follow the case as it progresses through the court.  Follow-up work on the case might 
include reviewing and summarizing briefs submitted by the parties, researching statutes and case law 
relevant to the matter, and conducting other preparatory work for trial.  Research notes or bench 
memoranda are often prepared in advance of trial on issues raised by the parties or the court. 

Trial Work.  An extern will have the opportunity to participate in trials and observe mediations 
held at the tax court.  During a trial, an extern may serve as the bailiff and call the court to order.  After 
the trial, the extern will work with the magistrate or Judge Manicke to review notes and the evidence 
presented, and then assist the magistrate or Judge Manicke in drafting the decision or legal memorandum.  
Drafting decisions will provide the extern with experience in writing statements of fact, analyzing case 
law and statutes and drawing conclusions of law. 

General Work.  In addition to work specifically related to cases, the extern will be involved in 

research projects of benefit to the court.  Research topics might include constitutional law, civil 
procedure, or evidentiary questions.  An extern may have the opportunity to assist in the review and 
revision of the rules of the court.  An extern will also participate in meetings of the court and become 
familiar with procedures involved in processing a case through the court. 

Communication with Members of the Court 

. 

  2

The presiding magistrate to the tax court will be the primary supervisor responsible for 
coordinating orientation and assignments for the extern with the magistrates and Judge Manicke.  The 
Regular Division and Magistrate Division law clerks may assist at times. 

Orientation.  Prior to beginning work at the tax court, the extern will be expected to meet with the 

law clerks, magistrates, and Judge Manicke to become familiar with the basic operations of the court.  
This “pre-orientation” might include reading significant court decisions and reviewing relevant statutes 
establishing the court and other tax-related materials.  These meetings would be arranged at the 
convenience of the extern and members of the court. 

Once arriving at the court, orientation will include meetings with Judge Manicke, magistrates, 

law clerks, and court staff.  Those meetings will help the extern to become familiar with the progress of 
cases through the court, members of the court, court staff, and important aspects of Oregon tax law. 

Setting Objectives.  The presiding magistrate and law clerk will collaborate with Judge Manicke, 
the magistrates, and the extern to set clear objectives for the externship experience.  Those objectives will 
include developing an understanding of the state’s property and income tax systems, the relationship 
between federal and state taxing systems, and the intersection of constitutional law and tax law.  Law 
clerk and presiding magistrate will regularly check to ensure the extern is working on a variety of 
assignments and progressing at an appropriate pace. 

Assignments.  The magistrates and law clerks will work with the magistrates and Judge Manicke 
to identify cases that would be appropriate for extern participation.  While working with the magistrates

An extern with the Oregon Tax Court will have opportunities to work on a wide range of 

assignments, including research projects, legal memoranda, and draft decisions.

or Judge Manicke, the extern may also receive additional assignments.  The extern will be responsible for 
keeping track of the time spent on each assignment and the current level of work flow and areas of law 
examined in each. 
 

The extern can expect exposure to cases involving at least one of the following issues:  residential 

property tax, personal income tax, business income tax, commercial property, or property valuation.  In 
addition, assignments have the potential to incorporate civil procedure issues such as summary judgment, 
motions to dismiss, and jurisdiction. 

Feedback.  Law clerks, magistrates, and Judge Manicke will provide feedback, either orally or in 
writing, to the extern as each project is completed.  The law clerk may also follow-up with the magistrate 
or Judge Manicke on designated projects for the purpose of passing additional feedback on to the extern 
on the completed assignment. 

Participation in all Available Activities 

. 

  3

An extern with the Oregon Tax Court will have the opportunity to work with the magistrates and 

Judge Manicke on cases pending before the court.  Participation in case work includes observing case 
management conferences, status and pre-trial conferences, mediations, and trials, as well as post-trial 
work, including drafting decisions. 

An extern would also participate in internal meetings of the court.  Other opportunities would 

include attending Supreme Court proceedings reviewing tax court cases, legislative activities pertaining to 
new tax bills (as permitted by legislative session), and attending Oregon Court of Appeals and circuit 
courts proceedings. 

4. 

Professionalism and Ethics 

During the externship, an extern will have the opportunity to explore the ethical and professional 

responsibilities unique to service in the judiciary.  As a single court with two divisions, the court must 
always be mindful of the ethical limitations of discussing cases and pending matters in the Magistrate 
Division with Judge Manicke who hears appealed Magistrate Division cases. 

An extern will also be exposed to a wide range of ethics and professionalism situations related to 
cases pending before the court.  A recurring example of ethical issues before the court stems from the rule 
that the court cannot give out legal advice.  This rule is consistently an issue because of the high number 
of pro se litigants appearing before the court, many of whom are not knowledgeable about court rules and 
procedures.  The extern might be asked to contact a party to clarify a scheduling or procedural matter or 
ethical issue (e.g., attorney seeking to represent client and act as primary witness).  This would expose the 
extern to the ethical responsibility of discussing the procedural matter while avoiding the dangers of ex 
parte communication with the party or parties on the substantive matter before the court.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
