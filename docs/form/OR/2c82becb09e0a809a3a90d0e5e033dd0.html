OREGON JUDICIAL BRANCH  

 A FOUR YEAR REPORT 

Oregon Judicial Branch Mission

As a separate and independent branch of government, our mission is to provide fair and accessible 

justice services that protect the rights of individuals, preserve community welfare, and inspire public 

confidence.  The established goals of Oregon state courts are to:

Protect Public Access to Justice – by making court services for citizens more accessible and easier 

to use through technology; providing safe courthouses; and supporting the special needs of diverse 

cultures in our communities.

Maintain Public Trust and Confidence – by working closely with the executive and legislative branches 

of government; preserving and enforcing the rule of law in our communities, while upholding the 

human ideals of fairness, impartiality, and accountability.

Provide Quality and Timely Dispute Resolution – by ensuring that disputes are resolved for citizens and 

businesses fairly, promptly, appropriately, and cost-effectively through jury and non-jury trials, alternative 

dispute resolution methods, improvements in court business processes, and use of technology.

Collaborate with Justice System Partners and Other Stakeholders – by achieving better outcomes 

in court proceedings through connections with justice system, public safety, and community welfare 

programs, in providing Treatment Courts, Juvenile Programs, and Family Courts.

Enhance Judicial Administration – Oregon courts must use the resources of Oregonians wisely. We 

are accountable to the law, to the other branches of government, and to the public. The effective 

administration of justice requires deliberate attention to and improvement of the core processes of 

our court system.

services.    We  have  tried  to  leverage  both  of 

those  circumstances  to  make  our  processes  more 

efficient and provide better services to the public. 

And we have undertaken new initiatives and pilot 

programs – some of which are highlighted in this 

report – to simplify the process for handling simple 

divorces, reduce cost and delay in civil litigation, 

and deal more effectively with veterans, juveniles 

with mental health issues, and addicted offenders 

who come before our courts.

Although  we  still  face  many  challenges  to  meet 

our constitutional obligation to administer justice 

“completely  and  without  delay,”  the  judges  and 

staff of Oregon’s court system continue to examine 

and  adapt  our  values  of  tradition  and  precedent 

with services and innovations that are the mark of 

a healthy, 21st Century court system.

Chief Justice Thomas A. Balmer, 2014

Introduction

The Oregon state court system is changing in many tangible and intangible ways.

ur function remains the same as it was when Oregon’s courts were established 

in  1859  –  administering  fair  and  impartial  justice  in  a  timely  manner.    The 

manner in which we perform that function and how we interact with government 

and community partners who work with us is changing dramatically.

  O

Oregon’s state courts adjudicate more than a half-million cases every year – from 

traffic citations, landlord-tenant disputes, commercial and business cases of all 

kinds,  to  complex  medical  malpractice  actions,  and  aggravated  murder  trials. 

We  issue  protective  orders  for  seniors  and  victims  of  domestic  violence  and 

preside over drug courts.

From the outside looking in, although budget reductions in recent years caused 

the  curtailment  of  public  court  hours  and  many  court  services,  we  were  still 

able to respond by offering greater online versatility. Oregonians can now pay 

fees  and  fines  online,  and  Oregon  lawyers  can  electronically  file  documents 

in our appellate courts and  many circuit courts.  In addition,  the Legislature 

has appropriated funds to replace or upgrade several deteriorated courthouses 

around the state and added three judges to Oregon’s Court of Appeals to meet 

that court’s heavy workload.

From  an  insider’s  perspective,  we  have  continued  our  efforts  to  identify  and 

implement  efficiencies,  explored  what  procedural  fairness  means  for  litigants 

in today’s courts, updated the Code of Judicial Conduct, and taken many other 

steps  that  are  mostly  invisible  to  the  public  but  necessary  to  keep  Oregon’s 

courts operating in our ever-changing world.

During the last four years the Judicial Department has weathered the budget 

reductions  that  affected  every  Oregon  family  and  public  institution,  as  well 

as  started  implementation  of  the  Oregon  eCourt  system  in  our  trial  courts 

to  automate  court  processes  and  provide  electronic  access  to  many  court

of Oregon’s court system

and adapt our values of

OJD Structure

The  Oregon  Judicial  Department  (OJD)  is  one  of  three  branches  of  state 

government established by the Constitution. It is responsible for exercising the 

“judicial power” by deciding criminal, civil, and other legal disputes; interpreting 

and applying the federal and state constitutions and statutes; and conducting 

trials and appeals throughout the State. 

OJD is comprised of a Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Tax Court, and 36 

circuit courts (trial courts) located within 27 judicial districts in all 36 counties. 

The  Chief  Justice  of  the  Oregon  Supreme  Court  is  the  administrative  head 

and  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the  Oregon  Judicial  Department.  The  Chief 

Justice supervises the state court system, issues orders and adopts rules to ensure 

the effective administration of OJD, appoints the Chief Judge of the Court of 

Appeals and the presiding judges of the state circuit courts, adopts procedural 

rules for the state courts, and supervises the statewide fiscal plan and budget for 

Centralized  services  in  support  of  the  court  system  are  provided  through  the 

Office of the State Court Administrator, which includes eleven divisions and 

all state courts.

  The powers of the 
Government shall 
be divided into three 
separate branches, 
the Legislative, the 
Executive, including  
the administrative, and 
the Judicial; and no 
person charged with 
official duties under 
one of these branches, 
shall exercise any of the 
functions of another,

Oregon Circuit Courts

The Oregon Tax Court

The circuit court is Oregon’s trial court. Circuit courts decide both civil cases 

that  arise  from  disputes  involving  property,  contracts,  personal  injury,  family 

relationships, tax, or government rules and regulations, and criminal cases that 

result  from  violations  of  criminal  law  categorized  as  felonies,  misdemeanors, 

probation violations, and lesser violation cases. Each of Oregon’s counties has 

a circuit court.

Oregon  is  divided  into  27  judicial  districts,  made  up  of  one  or  more  of  the 

state’s 36 counties. State law decides the number of judges elected within each 

district  based  on  population  and  case  volume,  combining  the  counties  with 

small populations and caseloads into multicounty judicial districts.

The  Chief  Justice  of  the  Oregon  Supreme  Court  appoints  a  presiding  judge 

for each judicial district to administer, supervise, and distribute the workload 

within the district. 

“Oregon courts must 
continue to explore and 
understand the ever-
changing demographics 
of Oregon’s population 
to ensure that everyone 
has meaningful access 
to dispute resolution. 
We must enhance our 
current educational 
materials to inform 
participants about court 
processes and must find 
“user-friendly” relevant 
tools for them to use.”

The Oregon Tax Court is one of only three state tax courts in the 

United States and is comprised of a Magistrate Division (Magistrates 

are judicial officers with training and experience in tax law), and a 

Regular Division (cases that go to the Regular Division are heard 

by the Judge of the Oregon Tax Court – an elected judicial officer). 

The  Tax  Court  has  statewide  jurisdiction  over  cases  that  involve 

Oregon’s  tax  laws  including  personal  income  tax,  property  tax, 

corporate  excise  tax,  timber  tax,  local  budget  law,  and  property 

tax limitations. Final decisions of the Magistrate Division may be

for  the  Chief  Judge  of  the  Court  of  Appeals 

and  $132,820  for  each  other  Court  of  Appeals 

judge; and $128,164 for the judge of the Oregon 

Tax  court.  Despite  this  progress,  pay  for  Oregon 

judges  has  lagged  far  behind  inflation  for  at 

least 40 years and far behind the salaries paid to 

judges in other states and to experienced lawyers 

working in comparable state and local government 

positions.  Inadequate  judicial  compensation  is 

making  it  difficult  for  OJD  to  attract  and  retain 

the best and brightest lawyers from diverse practice 

backgrounds as Oregon judges.

2013 Revision to the Oregon 
Code of Judicial Conduct

regon’s  Code  of  Judicial  Conduct,  which 

establishes specific standards for the ethical conduct 

of  judges  and  judicial  candidates,  had  not  been 

updated in 20 years with respect to developments 

in  case  law,  judicial  elections,  and  court  culture. 

Based  on  the  American  Bar  Association’s  2007 

Model  Code  of  Judicial  Conduct  and  four  years 

of work and review by judges, staff attorneys, and 

many  others,  appropriate  revisions  to  the  Code 

were  considered  and  adopted  by  the  Supreme 

Court.  The  revised  Code  of  Judicial  Conduct 

went into effect December 1, 2013.

Challenges
& Strategies

Chronic  decreases  in  court  funding  for  OJD  began  with  the  2008  economic 

crisis and didn’t start to improve until early 2013. Across-the-board state budget 

cuts during that period forced OJD to lay off staff, impose two to three weeks of 

unpaid furlough days, and initiate a freeze on step increases for remaining staff. 

In 2012, courthouses across the state were closed nine full days and daily court 

business hours were cut back, reducing access and creating court service delays 

for the public. Restraining orders, assistance for self-represented litigants, help in 

filling out forms, making payments, and submitting case filings were subject to 

restricted business hours. Continued funding of drug courts and other specialty 

courts was threatened – 10 specialty courts would have shut down in June 2012 

but for strong advocacy by courts, partner agencies, and successful drug court 

program participants that secured a last minute allocation of temporary funding 

by  the  Oregon  Legislature.  Legislative  sessions  held  during  2013  and  2014 

reinstated funding for some (not all) of OJD’s critical funding priorities. 

The series of budget challenges left many of OJD’s funding priorities and plans 

for updating court business processes and public access  in doubt. An uncertain 

funding  climate  challenged  OJD’s  overall  mission  as  the  third  branch  of 

government to administer and provide access to justice as it was forced to delay 

restoration of staff to keep courts open full time, development of our successful 

specialty courts, obtaining more judges in counties with growing populations, 

urgent infrastructure improvements and repairs to our courthouses, providing 

self-help offices and online forms for self-represented litigants, reactivation of 

salary and step increases for judges and staff, and our investment in technology 

to  improve  access  to  the  courts  through  Oregon  eCourt  services.  Uncertain 

funding  for  Oregon  eCourt  from  biennium  to  biennium  slowed  (but  didn’t 

deter)  our  efforts  to  move  forward  with  a  statewide  case  management  system 

for  the  courts,  technological  integration  and  data  sharing  with  public  safety 

partners, electronic access to case information in 

the courtroom for judges, and electronic access to 

the courts for the public and people in crisis.  

In  order  to  move  forward  –  past  the  effects  of  a 

diminishing  budget  –  OJD  searched  for  a  new 

route – a fresh set of business tactics, innovations, 

and processes that were requisite to cutting costs 

and  restoring  a  fully  functioning  court  system. 

OJD  examined  where  the  courts  could  be  more 

efficient,  where  we  could  save  money,  where 

we  could  leverage  new  technology,  and  how  we 

could  raise  our  visibility  with  the  Legislature  to 

highlight  the  importance  of  fully-funded  courts 

in our communities. Judges, court administrators, 

and  staff  were  mobilized  to  identify  new  ideas, 

which were analyzed and developed into key areas 

of  change  by  OJD’s  Court  Reengineering  and 

Efficiencies  Workgroup  (CREW).  The  result  was 

a  well-organized  and  permanent  mission  devoted 

to  innovation  and  implementation  of  statewide 

changes that would not only restore court services, 

but  would  build  and  sustain  an  even  healthier 

court system for the citizens of Oregon.

Doing Things 
Differently 
to Meet Our 
Challenges

The Work of CREW

As the effects of the budget crisis continued to impair the daily administration 

of  justice,  OJD  undertook  an  urgent  effort  to  “do  more  with  less”  –  not  by 

temporarily  cutting  corners  and  continuing  to  reduce  services  until  Oregon’s 

economy recovered, but by “doing things differently” in developing permanent 

OJD-wide  efficiencies,  innovations,  and  budget  savings.    Identification  of 

areas  where  court  efficiencies  could  be  carried  out  despite  reduced  funding 

was  conducted  by  OJD’s  Court  Reengineering  and  Efficiencies  Workgroup 

(CREW),  led  by  then  Associate  Justice  Thomas  A.  Balmer.  The  workgroup 

included  judges  and  trial  court  administrators  from  circuit  courts  across  the 

state who conducted ongoing research and development of court innovations, 

tying  them  to  the  key  strategic  goals  outlined  in  OJD’s  2009  -  2013  Strategic 

Plan:

1.  Protect Public Access to Justice

2.  Maintain Public Trust and Confidence

3.  Provide Quality and Timely Dispute Resolution

4.  Collaborate with Justice System Partners and Other Stakeholders

5.  Enhance Judicial Administration

  CREW determines 
whether a proposed 
idea creates efficiencies, 
creates the necessary 
steps to accomplish the 
efficiency, and advances 
CREW’s Guiding 
Principles: Promote 
convenience for litigants; 
Reduce cost and 
complexity of judicial 
processes; Maintain 
or improve access to 
justice; Improve case 
predictability.

CREW began its task in the Spring of 2010 with an OJD-wide survey calling 

County Presiding Judge Karsten Rasmussen. CREW2 classified the

for suggestions from all judges and staff, generating over 1700 ideas that were 

proposals  under  three  categories:  Technology,  Restructure,  and

Many of CREW’s court innovations are tied to the success of statewide Oregon eCourt implementation. Oregon circuit court judges

efficiencies  improved  business  processes  and  encouraged  additional  ideas 

for  productive  changes  throughout  the  organization.  CREW  reorganized  its 

subcommittees and renamed them to delineate tasks that address OJD’s updated

call of the Chief Justice to discuss, edit, and incorporate new information to the

the lessons we have learned during the past several years from Oregon eCourt, 

and the lessons learned and tasks undertaken as part of the CREW process.

from all three subcommittees. This workgroup will gather docketing information, 

concepts,  data,  and  strategies  in  order  to  create  the  basis  for  a  statewide 

discussion  of  case  management  techniques  among  Presiding  Judges  and  Trial 

Court Administrators initially, and eventually among all judges. The workgroup 

will rely on existing data, time to disposition numbers, and time to disposition 

goals and will research and collect nationwide data and studies regarding best 

practices on this topic.

CREW subcommittee assignments and the formation of ad hoc workgroups will 

occur as new projects are developed.

Summary 

Keeping  in  mind  that  the  technology  of  Oregon  eCourt  will  facilitate  both 

current  and  future  efficiencies  for  OJD,  CREW’s  actions  have  continued 

to  build  and  refine  both  essential  and  new  court  processes  that  will  support 

a  more  efficient  state  court  system  now  and  into  the  future.  By  mid-2014, 

Oregon eCourt implementation has already introduced new uniform business 

processes  (in  data  entry,  case  processing,  case  type,  and  codes)  in  11  circuit 

courts,  and  standardized  internal  and  external  forms,  which  will  include 

online intelligent forms. The Odyssey® integrated case management system has 

The Oregon eCourt Configuration Team made up of TCAs, line staff, supervisors, and analysts from 13 courts, as well as staff from 
three OSCA divisions (BFSD, ETSD, and OETO) configured Odyssey® (the software that powers Oregon eCourt) to meet State, 
County, or municipal statutes, sentencing, statistical reporting, and court business needs. The team set the standard for reviewing 
old business processes and developing new statewide business processes configured to Odyssey®. Each circuit court must update 
their business processes when they implement the Oregon eCourt system.

given  judges  and  staff  access  to  case  data  from  any  computer  at 

any location. Oregon eCourt technology is already enhancing joint 

jurisdictional  arrangements  and  the  sharing  of  judicial  resources 

through  our  successful  post-conviction  docket  program,  where 

cases and documents can be accessed by judges and staff statewide 

from any location, and our current “remote judge” program, which 

stands to grow exponentially when all of our courts have completed 

implementation of the new system in 2016.

to  “paper-on-demand”  in  2008,  as  voluntary  eFiling  of  documents  and 

ePayment  became  available  in  the  Oregon  Supreme  Court.  This  major 

change was followed by installation of an electronic document repository, 

electronic business process workflows, and an eFiling system in the Court 

of  Appeals.  Currently,  at  the  appellate  level,  more  than  half  of  all  briefs 

are eFiled. These first steps in the appellate courts included providing the 

public with live webcasts of oral arguments in Oregon’s Supreme Court over 

the Internet using an upgraded internet system and streaming technology.

  Oregon eCourt

  OJD’s early solution to Oregon eCourt in the trial courts had been to follow 

the  industry-standard  “best  of  breed”  approach.  This  involved  grouping 

different software applications together (one for case management, another 

for financial, and so on), but there were technical difficulties in connecting 

them to work as one system. By 2011, integrated software solutions designed 

specifically for state court systems had appeared on the horizon and were 

proving  to  be  more  effective  operationally  and  financially,  so  OJD  took 

decisive steps to change course and adopt an integrated state court software 

system designed to meet the diverse business and case management needs of 

the courts. 

  Tyler  Technologies  Inc.,  an  experienced  single-solution  provider  of  court 
software, was selected to deploy Odyssey,® their integrated court management 
system.  Odyssey®  offered  Oregon  eCourt  a  system  that  combined  the 

components  of  case  management,  financial  management,  eFiling,  jury 

management,  document  access,  court  session  support  functionality,  and 

ePayment,  ensuring  that  implementation  of  Oregon  eCourt  could  move 

forward without further delay, and at less cost to OJD and the State.

 

Starting  with  statewide  implementation  of  ePayment  from  2011  through 

2012, access to make online payments for tickets, fines, and court cases was 
provided  to  the  public.  Next,  Odyssey®  software  for  Oregon  eCourt  was 

implemented in our first pilot court, Yamhill County Circuit Court in June 

2012, followed by Linn, Crook, and Jefferson circuit courts by the end of 

that year; then Jackson,  Clatsop, Columbia, and  Tillamook circuit courts 

went live with the system in 2013. The long-awaited eFiling component of 

Oregon eCourt was deployed in those “live” courts starting in April through 

Yamhill County Circuit Court was the first court in Oregon to implement Oregon eCourt in June 2012. Current Chief Justice Thomas

the Oregon eCourt knowledgebase. OJD’s entire technical system (computer 

hardware,  servers,  security  systems,  web  capability,  and  so  on)  has  been 

upgraded by our Enterprise Technology Services Division to accommodate 

the  move  from  paper  to  electronic  data,  and  to  maintain  the  integrated 

Odyssey suite of court applications in the future. The upgrade provides for 

system and data recovery capability for all of our electronic data systems in 

the event of an outage or disaster. Electronic integration with the different 

communications  systems  of  partner  agencies  takes  place  in  each  court’s 

county before go-live to enable data-sharing with the Oregon eCourt system 

so our judges and staff can access the most recent case information at the 

click of a mouse. Through all of this, OJD has come together as a model of 

statewide teamwork to support and assist each court as it goes live.

Oregon eCourt is already improving court accessibility for the public and the 

legal community with online services in the “live” courts, and is widening the 

spread of OJD efficiencies in sharing judicial and staff resources from county 

to county with the ability to access Oregon eCourt case information from 

any location. All OJD courts statewide will have completed implementation 

of Oregon eCourt in 2016.

Video Conferencing to Share Judicial Resources

We  are  bringing  established  courtroom  technologies  (such  as  video 

conferencing  in  arraignments  from  prisons  and  detainment  facilities, 

juvenile proceedings, or for witness appearances) up-to-date by using them 

in other capacities. 

The Oregon Legislature funds the number of judgeships in a county based 

on population, leaving some rural counties with only one or two judges to 

hear all circuit court cases. The success and availability of video conferencing 

allows judges to hear cases remotely, providing additional judicial resources 

for rural courts in counties with heavy workloads or when a judge is recused 

from  a  particular  case.  Innovative  use  of  technology  helps  stretch  OJD’s 

budget dollars.

Post-Conviction Review Program 

Video conferencing technology continues  to be developed in OJD’s Post-

Conviction  Review  Program  (PCR),  where  PCR  trials  from  around  the 

state  are  heard  by  senior  judges  stationed  in  Salem.  The  judge  receives 

the case files by disk or secure server one week before the trial dates and 

generally rules from the bench, signs the judgments, and the cases heard 

on any day (generally eight to ten cases) are returned to the circuit court of 

record for filing. The Program started with Malheur County in 2000 and 

currently includes Malheur, Umatilla, Jefferson, Multnomah, Marion, and 

Washington Counties.

Senior judges are also assigned as the trial judges for post-conviction death 

penalty cases, which are filed in Marion County. This has allowed the trial 

court judges in the participating counties to focus on other cases currently 

pending  in  their  courts  and  has  also  brought  many  of  the  pending  non-

death penalty PCR cases up-to-date, so where we may have scheduled two 

hearing days a month in a county we are down to one day a month.

Time,  staff,  fuel  savings,  and  leveraging  judicial  resources  are  current 

benefits of video conferencing. OJD expects to expand those benefits even 

further  once  Oregon  eCourt  has  been  implemented  statewide,  allowing 

all  of  our  circuit  court  judges  to  hear  cases  and  access  case  information 

instantaneously from any computer in any courtroom.

Joint Jurisdiction Efficiencies

Each of Oregon’s 36 counties has a circuit court. Those with small populations 

are grouped together into “Joint Jurisdiction” districts – there are six of these 

out of 27 judicial districts. Joint Jurisdiction judges, trial court administrators, 

and certain staff travel between counties and courthouses working in one 

county  on  one  day,  and  in  another  county  the  next  day.  Oregon  eCourt 

technology has been implemented in one joint jurisdictional district so far – 

Crook/Jefferson, and has introduced tremendous efficiencies for staff and 

judges. Before Oregon eCourt, staff needing to view a case file to assist a 

party to that case could only do so if they were working in that county for the 

day. Now, staff that work in both counties can assist a judge, other staff, and 

the  public  by  accessing  case  information  electronically  at  either  location, 

in a shorter amount of time. Judges used to check out the hard copy case 

files  two  weeks  in  advance  of  hearing  a  case,  leaving  staff  without  access 

to the file – now, the file can be viewed by judges and staff electronically

employment  and  become  a  contributing  member  of  society  when  they 

graduate from the program.

Specialty Courts 

Specialty  Courts  (or  problem-solving  courts)  are  specialized  case  dockets 

within  the  circuit  courts  designed  to  work  with  specific  case  types  and 

clientele.  They  use  their  processes  to  collaborate  with  community  health 

and public safety agencies to place offenders in court-supervised treatment 

and  comprehensive  rehabilitation  programs.  OJD’s  circuit  court  judges 

connect  eligible  offenders  to  resources  and  programs  that  set  in  motion 

an  opportunity  to  resolve  personal  and  social  issues  that  have  derailed 

their  lives.  Drug  courts,  DUII  courts,  juvenile  drug  courts,  veteran’s 

courts, family courts, domestic violence courts, mental health courts, and 

community courts allow offenders to confront and resolve their individual 

issues  and  behaviors  through  treatment,  monitoring,  guidance,  and  hard 

work.  Depending  on  an  offender’s  eligibility  (weighing  the  level  of  crime 

committed,  criminal  history,  and  extenuating  circumstances)  the  court 

may allow entry into a particular program as a condition of probation or 

dismissal of charges upon successful graduation. Specialty court programs 

generally take participants from 9 to 12 months or more to complete. 

Statistical outcomes of these programs show that participants are less likely 

to re-offend, program “graduates” leave with skills to build more productive 

lives for themselves and their families resulting in safer communities, and 

future incarceration costs for the state are reduced.

Veterans Courts

 

 

Before  courts  had  specialized  programs  geared  to  the  unique  problems 

faced by veterans charged with crimes, many such offenders “fell through 

the cracks,” where no consideration was given to war-related medical and 

psychological problems that require special interventions. If conditions like 

PTSD, brain injuries, chronic pain, and life-changing physical injuries aren’t 

healed, self-medication with drugs and alcohol, or anti-social behavior is often 

the result, along with an inability to navigate the Veterans Administration 

system to obtain the therapeutic benefits veterans are entitled to. 

  Oregon’s first Veterans Treatment Court opened in Klamath County Circuit 

Court in 2010 in response to growing numbers of veterans winding up in 

court. The Oregon Judicial Department oversaw the design of a program 

with a framework of best practices (already proven by 44 established veterans 

courts across the country). The programs involve a partnership of the judicial 

system, the US Department of Veterans Affairs, the county Veterans Service 

Office,  veterans  benefit  organizations,  community  agencies,  volunteers, 

and  the  support  of  Peer  Mentors  who  form  a  treatment  team.  The  team 

meets before each veterans court session to review cases and make treatment 

recommendations to the court.

 

By  the  end  of  2013,  Klamath  County  Veterans  Court  had  admitted  57 

veteran defendants to the program. Twenty-eight have graduated (with an 

average of 16.5 months in the program) and there are 24 current participants. 

Since 2010, there have been 4 terminations for non-compliance. Additional 

veterans courts were opened in 2011 and 2012 in Lane and Marion circuit 

courts, and their success has led to plans for programs in Multnomah and 

Deschutes circuit courts.

  Mental Health Courts

 

Like our Veterans courts, where normal case processing has not been effective 

in  restoring  defendants  to  a  productive  life,  Mental  Health  Courts  take 

into  account  the  extenuating  circumstances  of  specific  diagnosed  mental 

disorders  that  contribute  to  an  offender’s  criminal  behavior.  Structured 

supervision and treatment is the focus of Oregon’s Mental Health Courts, 

including  providing  access  to  long-term  treatment,  medications,  housing, 

employment, and programs that teach self-management skills to reduce the 

likelihood of criminal behavior recurring in the future. A Mental Health

Expedited Civil Jury Trials

The Oregon Judicial Department, concerned over the continuing decline 

in jury trials brought about by high litigation costs and overloaded court 

dockets  that  can  delay  trials  up  to  a  year  or  more,  implemented  the 

Expedited Civil Jury Trial program in 2010. The program offers a “speedy” 

jury trial for simple cases (under $50,000) at a reasonable price, and protects 

the right to a jury trial in civil cases. A jury trial of six jurors is guaranteed 

within four months of filing and parties must forego arbitration and agree 

to limited discovery and pre-trial motions in order to reduce costs and move 

the  case  through  the  court  quickly.  Eighteen  Expedited  Civil  Jury  Trials 

were conducted under this program between 2011 and 2014.

and recommendations from CRB reviews are filed with the 

court to help ensure that children and families involved in 

the case get the services they need and that every child lives 

in a safe, secure, healthy and permanent home – preserving 

families whenever possible. From July 1, 2013 through June 

30, 2014, a total of 377 Oregonians served as CRB board 

members, reviewing the cases of 4,533 children who were 

in foster care for six months or longer.

In  2014,  the  CRB  focused  attention  and  resources  on 

recruiting  volunteers  in  areas  with  high  vacancies  and 

improving  the  overall  quality  and  accessibility  of  board 

member trainings.  In an effort to reach as many potential 

volunteers  as  possible  with  limited  staff  resources,  the 

program  began  offering  orientation  training  through 

video  conferencing  in  multiple  parts  of  the  state.  New 

online  training  modules  were  also  developed  that  enable 

prospective volunteers to complete parts of the orientation 

training at home and at their own pace.  Online availability 

of training greatly reduces some barriers to service, especially 

for prospective volunteers from rural communities.

   

 

 

A new Juvenile Court effort established by Chief Justice Balmer 

in 2014 is a task force to study mental health services for youth

JCIP  also  conducted  research  on  how  Oregon’s  courts  and  the  CRB 

address the needs of older youth in foster care.  Through observation of 

court and CRB hearings, youth focus groups and surveys, and stakeholder 

interviews,  the  research  (focused  on  six  Oregon  counties)  received 

strong staff, judge, and stakeholder support.  The research resulted in a 

written report on how older youth experience the court, the CRB, and 

child welfare system and offered recommendations for improvements.

 

JCIP  dedicated  considerable  attention  in  2014  to  a  research  project 

that  monitors  court  compliance  with  the  federal  Indian  Child 

Welfare  Act  (ICWA).  This  included  training  court  observers  and

JCIP’s Judicial Engagement and Leadership Institute

JCIP’s Judicial Engagement and Leadership Institute (JELI) is a judge-
led project that assists and encourages judges to be actively engaged 
in examining juvenile court dependency system issues and in develop-
ing solutions and strategies to address them, with the goal of improv-
ing outcomes for Oregon children and families. To carry out its mission 
during 2014 the JELI:

•  Produced a statewide model DHS court report

•  Updated statewide juvenile court forms

•  Developed  and  delivered  a  full  day  experiential  training  for  judges 

called “Anatomy of a Case” 

  Judicial Leadership Roles

• Adopt and communicate 
a vision of timeliness in 
achieving safe, permanent

• Motivate juvenile court 
stakeholders to work 
cooperatively to identify 
resources and services for at-
risk children and families.

• Encourage inter-agency 

cooperation and coordination 
for those serving children and 
families.

• Convene regular meetings 

of all key juvenile 
court stakeholders to 
collaboratively identify and 
resolve systemic problems, 
plan specialized training 
events, strategize about 
new services to fulfill needs, 
address resource and funding 
issues, improve service 
delivery and court processes, 
and share their successes.

• Communicate regularly with

statewide forms, and user-friendly technology. 

 

A nationwide average of 80% of family law cases will involve at least one, 

and often two, self-represented litigants. The manner in which judges handle 

these cases in court determines whether or not both parties will receive a fair 

hearing. Courtroom practices by judges and staff, such as shifting from legal 

terminology to plain language; explaining what will occur during the hearing 

and reviewing what the legal issues are; pointing out who has to the convince 

the judge and how strong the evidence has to be; and prompting the parties 

to provide information represent the court’s commitment to safeguarding 

justice for the self-represented.

  Oregon eCourt technology will upgrade OJD’s online processes and resources 

for self-represented litigants, including online interactive forms. A statewide 

forms project is in the works and will base a series of interactive online forms 

on Multnomah County Circuit Court’s current Family Abuse Prevention 

Act (FAPA) TurboCourt™ form for restraining orders. The interactive form 

program asks the applicant a series of questions, populating the form with 

the applicant’s answers, and results in a document to submit to the court that 

complies with applicable rules without the need for court staff assistance in 

filling out the form.

6.  Healthy Courts Provide Safe Court Facilities 

security improvements, building new courthouses, and future 

maintenance to keep our court facilities functional and safe.

7.  Healthy Courts Need To Be Able To Attract the Best and The 

Brightest Judges 

  Oregon’s  courts  need  judges  experienced  in  all  areas  of  the 

law: public and private sector law, civil and criminal law, and 

family law. A compensation and benefit level that will attract 

well-qualified judicial candidates who will bring a diversity of 

backgrounds and experience to the courtroom is key to a healthy 

court system. As our current judges retire and new judges replace 

them, Oregon state courts will be hard-pressed to attract the best 

and the brightest without reasonable compensation for qualified 

judges.

OJD’s  focus  in  the  coming  years  will  be  to 

establish  the  basis  for  a  healthy  court  system. 

Ongoing  improvements  and  updated  technical 

processes  will continue  into  the future to  ensure 

that  Oregon  state  courts  will  continue  to  meet 

their constitutional obligation of providing a well-

functioning  judicial  system  –  a  core  function  of 

government. 

Fully 

functioning 

courts  need 

the 

tools 

and  resources  to  protect  our  individual  and 

constitutional rights, guard our civil liberties, and 

make legal decisions that impact businesses and the 

economy. The funding crisis of the last five years 

saw multiple OJD court services slip through our 

fingers,  weakening  the  health  of  the  courts  and, 

in  turn,  threatening  the  health  of  justice  in  our 

society.  As  an  organization,  OJD  has  responded 

by rethinking many of the ways it delivers services, 

adopting  new  methods  and  technologies,  and

Statistics 

In 2013, there were 
541,928 cases filed in 
Oregon’s circuit courts. 
Almost 1,500 cases are 
filed in Oregon courts 
every day, including  
civil cases, felonies,  
and civil commitments.

Nearly 600,000 cases are filed in Oregon courts every year. Cases filed include 

traffic  tickets,  disputes  over  minor  fender-benders,  divorces,  contested  child 

custody cases, complex securities and trade secrets controversies, serious medical 

malpractice cases, and cases involving criminal acts. All subject matter of cases 

(civil, criminal, family, and juvenile) are heard in the circuit courts, which are 

Oregon’s  court  of  “general  jurisdiction,”  except  for  cases  involving  tax  laws, 

which are heard by the Oregon Tax Court. Circuit Court case decisions may be 

appealed to the Court of Appeals, which will issue a decision in the case (Tax 

Court and death penalty case appeals go directly to the Supreme Court). A party 

who is dissatisfied with the Court of Appeals decision may petition the Supreme 

Court to review that decision. The Supreme Court can choose to accept or deny 

the petition.

OJD statistics are collected yearly and issued in February of the following year.

— Chief Justice 

Thomas A. Balmer  
OSB House of Delegates 
Speech 2013

The Oregon Judicial Department receives funding for its operating costs primarily 

from Legislative appropriations out of the State General Fund. OJD’s General 

Fund appropriation for 2011-2013 amounted to $368 million – approximately 

2.49% of the General Fund Budget and ¾ of 1 percent of the total state budget. 

The 2013-2015 State General Fund appropriation was $394.5 million – 7.2% 

greater than the 2011-2013 allocation. Other revenue amounts are added to the 

budget to cover non-operating costs (Oregon eCourt, facilities, treatment courts) 

and  come  from  legislative  approval  for  bond  funding;  federal  funds  (usually 

grants);  “other  funds”  (1%  of  revenues  received  by  OJD  from  fees,  service 

charges, specific taxes, and loan programs, the balance of which goes to the state 

General Fund and specific state services); and special purpose appropriations 

(funds authorized during the biennium by the Legislature’s Emergency Board 

for a specified use). Total OJD funding in 2011-2013, counting other funds, was 

$425 million and $461 million in 2013-2015.

Increases to OJD funding for the 2013-2015 Biennium were due to an improved 

economy  and  legislative  approval  of  some  of  OJD’s  requests.  Those  funds 

allowed OJD to: eliminate full-day furlough closures – keeping our courts open 

every  business  day;  restore  some  staff  positions  –  decreasing  case  processing 

time  and  getting  judgments  entered;  provide  judges  and  staff  with  overdue 

cost-of-living  and  salary  increases;  and  fund  the  three-judge  panel  for  the 

Court of Appeals that had been approved in 2012. Other funds were approved 

to  continue  implementation  of  Oregon  eCourt;  the  continuation  of  a  dozen 

treatment courts; and infrastructure funds for urgent Supreme Court building 

repairs, replacement of the temporary Union County Courthouse, and money 

and access to state bonds for matching funds to help several counties begin to 

replace or renovate unsafe or inadequate county-owned courthouses.   

OJD Revenues 2011 - 2013

OJD revenues are generated from case filing fees, driver license sanction fees, trial and hearing fees, court collection fees, 

and fines imposed on violations and crimes. These revenues are distributed to the state’s General Fund and various state 

services and state, city, and county programs.

OJD’s Future Funding Goals

OJD’s priorities for 2015-2017 are to secure the funding needed to bring our 

courts back to full operating capacity. We will seek to restore staff positions lost 

over the past six years so that the courts can decide cases and enter judgments 

in  a  timely  manner,  and  ensure  access  to  justice,  including  court-based  staff 

support  for  family  law  and  self-represented  litigants.  We  will  continue  to  ask 

the Legislature to permanently fund the treatment, family, and veteran’s court 

programs that are successfully dealing with crimes related to societal problems 

that  can’t  be  resolved  in  a  standard  courtroom  setting;  we  will  analyze  and 

address  the  need  to  hire  more  judges  in  counties  whose  populations  have 

grown;  and  we  will  keep  pushing  to  move  Oregon’s  judicial  salaries  closer  to 

the  national  average  so  as  to  attract  the  most  qualified  judges.  As  in  the  last 

two bienniums,we will point out the need to fund court security and seismic 

retrofitting  of  facilities  to  protect  the  safety  of  people  doing  business  in  our 

courthouses as well as judges and staff.

Oregon eCourt implementations reached the halfway mark in December 2014 

having  completed  7  “go-lives”  in  14  counties,  with  six  remaining  “go-lives” 

scheduled that will inlcude 22 counties by the end of 2016. We are requesting 

that  the  Legislature  provide  General  Fund  appropriations  for  two  additional 

categories that are inseparable with the future use of Oregon eCourt: funding 

for ongoing maintenance of the new technology system and funding for ongoing 

business  process  training,  so  that  judges  and  staff  will  remain  current  with 

technology upgrades and new software features. 

Our  funding  depends  in  good  part  on  developing  an  effective  and  open 

relationship  with  the  Legislative  Branch  along  with  the  continued  support 

voiced  by  our  court-funding  advocates  and  legal  stakeholders.  Part  of  OJD’s 

organizational mission is to strengthen those connections, which contribute to 

OJD’s effort to rebuild, develop, and maintain a healthy and accessible court 

system for Oregon.

OJD will need ongoing training funds in its General Fund allocation in 2015-2017 and beyond to keep our judges and staff in all 
36 counties (some with multiple districts and courthouses) up-to-date on system software developments and upgrades to Oregon 
eCourt technology. New training classes (separate classes for judge needs and staff needs) will need to be created  and staffed with 
trainers for software and feature upgrades, updates to the Online Help system for Oregon eCourt, and development of all related 
court business processes for different categories of staff positions.

OJD Judges and Staff Across 36 Counties Will Require Ongoing Training on Oregon 
eCourt Software and Continuous Development of OJD Business Processes

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
