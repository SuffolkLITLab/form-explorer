Court interpreters act as neutral and impartial officers of the court who assist in ensuring that 
court proceedings and courthouse services are accessible to persons eligible to receive 
interpreting services according to ORS 45.273.  

ORS 45.273 states:  “It is declared to be the policy of this state to secure the constitutional 
rights and other rights of persons who are unable to readily understand or communicate in the 
English language because of a non-English-speaking cultural background or a disability, and 
who as a result cannot be fully protected in administrative and court proceedings unless 
qualified interpreters are available to provide assistance.” 

ORS 45.291 states that the State Court Administrator shall, subject to available funding, 
establish a program for the certification of court interpreters to aid in ensuring quality interpreting 
in court and enumerate the activities this responsibility covers.   

According to ORS 45.275(9)(c), a “qualified interpreter” is:  “a person who is readily able to 
communicate with the non-English-speaking person and who can orally transfer the meaning of 
statements to and from English and the language spoken by the non-English-speaking person.  
A qualified interpreter must be able to interpret in a manner that conserves the meaning, tone, 
level, style and register of the original statement, without additions or omissions.  ‘Qualified 
interpreter’ does not include any person who is unable to interpret the dialect, slang or 
specialized vocabulary used by the party or witness.” 

An interpreter is qualified on the record pursuant to ORS 45.275(8):  
“A court, a hearing officer or the designee of a hearing officer shall require any person serving 
as an interpreter for the court or agency to state the person’s name on the record and whether 
the person is certified under ORS 45.291.  If the person is certified under ORS 45.291, the 
interpreter need not make the oath or affirmation required by ORS 40.325 or submit the 
interpreter’s qualifications on the record.  If the person is not certified under ORS 45.291, the 
interpreter must make the oath or affirmation required by ORS 40.325 and submit the 
interpreter’s qualifications on the record.” 

The Oregon statutes relevant to court interpreting are found in ORS chapter 45.

of providing court interpreter services unless the interpreter has met the requirements listed 
below and has received the credential awarded by OSCA, is certified as an interpreter by the 
federal courts, or is certified as an interpreter by a Consortium for Language Access in the 
Courts (CLAC) member state.  Court Interpreter Services (CIS) also uses the term registered

observation hours, or hours of OJD-mentored assignments; the number and type of

to the beginning of the activity using the CIS application (See Form). 

Sponsors wishing to present a continuing education program and seek OJD CEU 
credits must request approval at least 30 days prior to the beginning of the

The criteria below will be used for purposes of determining if any activity, including those 
classified as independent study, constitutes education for the purpose of meeting the 
OJD continuing education requirements. 

4. 

Continuing education activities must meet the following three criteria:  

The subject matter is relevant to court interpreting, the work of the courts, 
or the judicial branch;  
The education is at least 50 minutes in length; and 
Anticipated learning outcomes are identified before the educational 
activity.

II.  COMPLIANCE REVIEW 

ORS 45.291 provides that the State Court Administrator, subject to the availability of funding, 
shall establish grounds for renewal, suspension, or cancellation of credentials and a process for 
receiving comments and input on compliance with the Code of Professional Responsibility for 
Interpreters in the Oregon Courts.  This policy sets out the process for handling comments 
dealing with noncompliance which may affect an interpreter’s credential status.  Noncompliance 
with the Code of Professional Responsibility for Interpreters in the Oregon Courts and other 
program policies may be reviewed or addressed by one or more of the following: 

A. 

Noncompliance with Renewal Requirements 

The interpreter’s credential will be suspended if the interpreter fails to comply 
with the credential renewal requirements.   

The interpreter’s credential will be cancelled if the interpreter fails to comply with 
the credential renewal requirements within six months of the expiration date.   

If the interpreter’s credential is cancelled due to noncompliance with renewal 
requirements, the interpreter will be required to restart the credential process 
should the interpreter seek to regain the credential. 

B. 

Skills Retesting or Oral Proficiency Reassessment 

An interpreter credential will be cancelled if an interpreter retakes any Court 
Interpreting Oral Examination or Oral Proficiency Interview and does not achieve 
acceptable scores.  

An interpreter credential will be cancelled if an interpreter is required to retake 
the Court Interpreting Oral Examination or an Oral Proficiency Interview for a 
psychometric measurement of the interpreter’s skills and does not achieve 
acceptable scores. 

urrent Oregon certified or registered interpreters who retested prior to the effective date 

of this policy shall not lose their credential based on retesting records from years prior. 

C. 

Credential Review, Suspension, or Cancellation 

Comments concerning a credentialed interpreter’s compliance or noncompliance with 
the Code of Professional Responsibility for Interpreters in the Oregon Courts or other 
program policies may be submitted to CIS for review and possible action.   

1. 

When CIS receives a complaint, CIS generally will notify the affected interpreter 
in writing.

3. 

The interpreter must schedule a meeting with a CIS management representative 
or provide a written response within 14 calendar days of the interpreter’s receipt 
of the concerns.  The purpose of the meeting or written response is to address 
the concerns. 

Depending on the nature and severity of the findings and after review of all 
information and the interpreter’s response, CIS may take one or more of the 
following steps: 

Receive a plan with an implementation timeline from the interpreter to 
address the concerns and provide an opportunity for the interpreter to 
show compliance to the Code of Professional Responsibility for 
Interpreters in the Oregon Courts and other program policies.  
Require the interpreter to retest for an updated psychometric 
measurement of the interpreter’s skills.  
Recommend suspension or cancellation of the interpreter’s credential to 
the State Court Administrator.  

a. 

b. 

c. 

 

The State Court Administrator or designee, having reviewed all information, will make a 
decision regarding renewal, suspension, or cancellation of the court interpreter’s 
credential.  According to ORS 45.291(k), an adversely affected interpreter who objects to 
the decision made by the Office of the State Court Administrator or designee may submit 
a written request for further review.   

III.  OREGON CERTIFIED AND REGISTERED COURT INTERPRETER ROSTER 

Court Interpreter Services compiles rosters of Oregon Certified and Registered Court 
Interpreters.  These rosters are accessible to the public via the Court Interpreter Services’ 
website.  The rosters include the interpreter’s name, contact information, and a listing of the 
language or languages the interpreter provides interpreting services for.  Interpreters will be 
asked to submit a consent form to release contact information in the publicly distributed roster.  
The interpreter is responsible to keep the information correct and current.   

Certified and registered interpreters may update their contact information by sending an email 
to:  Court.Interpreter.Program@ojd.state.or.us.
