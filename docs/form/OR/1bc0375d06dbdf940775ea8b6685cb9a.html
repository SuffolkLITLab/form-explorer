CODE OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR INTERPRETERS IN THE OREGON COURTS 

REAMBLE 

any persons who come before the courts are partially or completely excluded from full 

participation in the proceedings because of limited English proficiency or a speech or hearing 
impairment.  It is essential that the resulting communications barrier be removed, as far as 
possible, so that these persons are placed in the same position as similarly situated persons for 
whom there is no such barrier.1  An interpreter is sworn in as an officer of the court.  As an 
officer of the court, an interpreter is a neutral and impartial participant who assists the court in 
ensuring that court proceedings and court support services are accessible and function 
efficiently and effectively.  The court interpreter is a skilled professional, therefore, who fulfills an 
essential role in the administration of justice.  At a minimum, an interpreter must be a "qualified 
interpreter," under ORS 45.275 (7)-(8), to serve in the courts in Oregon.  However, ORS 45.288 
requires the court to give preference for appointments to an interpreter certified under ORS 
45.291.  In other words, the court is required by ORS 45.288 to appoint a certified interpreter if a 
certified interpreter is available, able, and willing to serve.  If no certified interpreter is available, 
able, and willing to serve, an interpreter still must meet the statutory requirements for 
qualification contained in ORS 45.275 (7)-(8) and ORS 45.288(3)-(4), and state his or her 
qualifications on the record as in ORS 45.275 (7). 

PPLICABILITY 

his code shall guide all persons, agencies, and organizations who administer, supervise use 
of, or deliver interpreting services to the courts.  Ensuring equal access to the communication, 
however, may on occasion conflict with this code.  When unique situations necessitate an 
exception to the rules in order to ensure effective communication, the court may so allow. 

or clarification of this code, the following definitions should be kept in mind.  Interpreting is 
rendering an oral statement from one language into an oral statement to another language.  
Sight translation is rendering written material into oral form.  Translation is rendering written 
material from one language into written form in another language. 

iolations of this code may result in the interpreter being deleted from a court's list of qualified 

and/or certified interpreters. 

.      ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS 

The interpreter shall render a complete and accurate interpretation or sight 
translation, without altering, omitting anything from, or adding anything to what is 
stated or written, and without explanation. 

                                                
1 A non-English speaker should be able to understand just as much as an English speaker with the same 

level of education and intelligence would understand.

Commentary 

The interpreter has a twofold duty:  1) to ensure that the proceedings in English reflect 
precisely what was said by a non-English speaking person, and 2) to place the non-
English speaking person on an equal footing with those who understand English.  This 
creates an obligation to conserve every element of information contained in a source 
language communication when it is rendered in the target language. 

Therefore, the interpreter is obligated to apply the interpreter's best skills and judgment 
to faithfully preserve the meaning of what is said in court, including the style or register 
of speech.  Verbatim, "word for word," or literal oral translations are not appropriate 
when they distort the meaning of the source language, but every spoken statement, 
even if it appears nonresponsive, obscene, rambling, or incoherent, should be 
interpreted.  This includes apparent misstatements. 

The interpreter should never interject his or her own words, phrases, or expressions.  If 
the need arises to explain an interpreting problem, (e.g., a term or phrase with no direct 
equivalent in the target language or a misunderstanding that only the interpreter can 
clarify), the interpreter should ask the court's permission to provide an explanation.  The 
interpreter of an oral language should convey the emotional emphasis of the speaker, 
but it may be in a slightly diminished form.  If the witness weeps during questioning, the 
interpreter should not weep.  Imitating the weeping might appear to mock the witness.  
Sadness can be conveyed by tone of voice alone.  The judge and jury can see a witness' 
emotions for themselves even if they do not understand the target language. 

A sign language interpreter, however, must employ all of the visual cues that the 
language he or she is interpreting requires--including facial expressions and body 
language, in addition to sign language.  A sign language interpreter, therefore, should 
ensure that court participants do not confuse these essential elements of the interpreted 
language with inappropriate interpreter conduct. 

The obligation to preserve accuracy includes the interpreter's duty to correct, in a timely 
fashion, any error of interpretation discovered by the interpreter during the proceeding.  
The interpreter should demonstrate professionalism by objectively analyzing any 
challenge to his or her performance. 

.      REPRESENTATIONS OF QUALIFICATIONS 

The interpreter shall accurately and completely represent his or her certifications, 
training, and pertinent experience.  The court should reassess the interpreter's 
qualifications each time the interpreter is engaged to interpret in court for a non-
English speaking party or witness. 

Commentary 

Acceptance of a case by the interpreter implies the interpreter's linguistic competency in 
legal settings.  Withdrawing or being asked to withdraw from a case after it begins 
causes a disruption of court proceedings and is wasteful of scarce public resources.  It is 
therefore essential that the interpreter present a complete and truthful account of the

interpreter's training, certification, and experience prior to appointment so the court can 
fairly evaluate the interpreter's qualifications for delivering interpreting services. 
IMPARTIALITY AND AVOIDANCE OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST--COURT OR 
PROCEEDING INTERPRETER 

3.     

The interpreter shall be impartial and unbiased and shall refrain from conduct that 
may give an appearance of bias or conflict of interest.  The interpreter shall 
disclose to the judge any real bias or interest in the parties or witnesses in a case, 
or any situation or relationship that may be perceived by the court, any of the 
parties, or any witnesses as a bias or interest in the parties or witnesses in a case.  

Commentary 

When appointed by the court to act as a proceeding interpreter, the interpreter's "clients" 
are all of the parties and witnesses in the court case.  Because of this, it is important that 
the interpreter have no real or perceived interest in any of the parties or witnesses 
beyond the professional interest of interpreting for the non-English speaking parties and 
witnesses in the court case. 

Any condition that interferes with the objectivity of the interpreter constitutes a conflict of 
interest.  Before providing services in a matter, the court interpreter must disclose to all 
parties and the court any prior involvement in the case or with the parties or witnesses, 
whether personal or professional, that could be reasonably construed as a conflict of 
interest.  This disclosure shall not include privileged or confidential information.  If, after 
this disclosure on the record, all parties acknowledge the situation and determine that it 
is in the best interest of justice for the interpreter to serve in the case, the interpreter may 
interpret in the case. 

The following are circumstances that are presumed to create actual or perceived 
conflicts of interest for the interpreter where the interpreter needs to declare the conflict 
of interest before appointment on the record and let the court determine if the interpreter 
should serve in the case: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

The interpreter is a friend, associate, or relative of a party or counsel for a party 
involved in the proceedings; 

The interpreter has served in an investigative capacity in the case at issue for 
any party involved in the case; 

The interpreter has previously been retained by a law enforcement agency to 
assist in the preparation of the criminal case at issue; 

The interpreter or the interpreter's spouse or child has a financial interest in the 
subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding or any other interest 
from which the interpreter may benefit from, that would be affected by the 
outcome of the case; 

5. 

The interpreter has been involved in the choice of counsel or law firm for the 

case. 

3 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

   

   

   

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The interpreter should not serve in any manner in which payment for their services is 
contingent upon the outcome of the case. 
An interpreter who is also an attorney should not serve as the court or proceeding 
interpreter, as well as the attorney in the same case. 

During the proceeding, the interpreter should avoid any conduct or behavior that 
presents the appearance of favoritism toward any of the parties.  The Interpreter should 
maintain professional relationships with the non-English speaking parties and witnesses, 
and should limit his or her involvement in the proceedings to that of interpretation.  The 
interpreter should discourage a non-English speaking party's or witness' personal 
dependence on the interpreter. 

The interpreter should refrain from conversations with parties, witnesses, jurors, 
attorneys, or with friends or relatives of any party in or near the courtroom, except in the 
discharge of their official functions.  It is especially important that the interpreter, who is 
often familiar with attorneys or other members of the courtroom work group, including 
law enforcement officers, refrain from casual and personal conversations with anyone in 
the court that may convey an appearance of a special relationship or partiality to any 
court participant. 

An example of conversation that would be within the interpreter's official duties would be:  
communicating with the non-English speaking party or witness in an informal setting 
where the interpreter would listen to accent, rhythm, and the choice of words of the non-
English speaking party to determine if the interpreter can adequately interpret for the 
non-English speaking party or witness.   

The interpreter should strive for professional detachment.  The interpreter should avoid 
all verbal and nonverbal displays of personal attitudes, prejudices, emotions, or opinions. 

Should the interpreter become aware that a proceeding participant views the interpreter 
as having a bias or being biased, the interpreter should disclose that knowledge on the 
record to the judge and the parties in the case.  This disclosure shall not include 
privileged or confidential information.  If all parties acknowledge the situation and 
determine that it is in the best interest of justice for the interpreter to serve in the case, 
the interpreter may continue to interpret in the case.

IMPARTIALITY AND AVOIDANCE OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST--INTERPRETER 
APPOINTED TO WORK WITH STATE-PAID, APPOINTED ATTORNEY 

An interpreter appointed to work with a state-paid, appointed attorney shall refrain 
from conduct that may give an appearance of personal bias or conflict of interest.  
The interpreter so appointed may appear to have the natural professional bias that 
occurs because the interpreter is part of the appointed legal team.  Interpreters 
appointed to work with an appointed attorney shall disclose to the attorney any 
real bias or interest in the parties or witnesses in a case, or any situation or 
relationship that may be perceived by the court, any of the parties, or any 
witnesses as a personal bias or interest in the parties or witnesses in a case.  The 
appointed attorney shall either petition the court for the appointment of a different 
interpreter to the case, thereby releasing the interpreter from the interpreter's 
obligation in the case, or the attorney shall bring the situation to the attention of 
the court and opposing party, on the record.  If the attorney fails to bring the 
conflict to the attention of the court, the interpreter must notify the court of a 
potential conflict of interest.  This disclosure shall not include privileged or 
confidential information.  If all of the parties agree that the interpreter may serve 
on the case, the interpreter may remain appointed to the case.   

Commentary 

Any condition that interferes with the objectivity of the interpreter constitutes a conflict of 
interest.  Before accepting appointment to a case, the interpreter must disclose to all 
parties and the court any prior involvement in the case or with the parties or witnesses, 
whether personal or professional, that could be reasonably construed as a conflict of 
interest.  This disclosure shall not include privileged or confidential information.  If, after 
this disclosure on the record, all parties acknowledge the situation and determine that it 
is in the best interest of justice for the interpreter to serve in the case, the interpreter may 
interpret in the case.

5. 

The interpreter has been involved in the choice of counsel or law firm for the 
case. 

The interpreter should not serve in any manner in which payment for the interpreter's 
services is contingent upon the outcome of the case. 

The interpreter appointed to work with an appointed attorney is to interpret what is 
spoken by the non-English speaking party in private conferences and conversations 
between the appointed attorney and the non-English speaking party.  In a case where 
the court has appointed the attorney and the interpreter, the interpreter may also sit at 
the counsel table and interpret the proceeding for the non-English speaking person in a 
simultaneous interpretation mode.   

An interpreter who is also an attorney may prepare a case without the aid of an 
additional interpreter; however, it is not required.  An attorney who is also an interpreter 
may not act as the attorney and the interpreter for the non-English speaking party in 
court during a proceeding. 

Though appointed as a member of the legal team, the interpreter should avoid any 
conduct or behavior that presents the appearance of any personal favoritism toward any 
of the parties.  The interpreter should maintain professional relationships with the 
appointed attorney and the non-English speaking party, and should limit their 
involvement with the non-English speaking party to that of interpretation.  The interpreter 
should discourage a non-English speaking party's personal dependence on the 
interpreter and should defer all questions the party may have to the appointed attorney.   

Though a member of the appointed legal team, the interpreter must not take on the role 
of advocate for the non-English speaking party.  Despite the fact that the interpreter is a 
member of the legal team, the interpreter must still interpret everything that is said in 
court to the non-English speaking party and to interpret everything that is said by the 
non-English speaking party.  For example, if in a criminal case the defendant becomes 
angry during the proceeding and starts to shout obscenities at a witness who is 
testifying, it is the interpreter's duty to interpret for the court participants everything that 
the defendant is saying, even if what is being said by the defendant is not helpful to the 
defense effort. 

An interpreter appointed to a case should not perform bilingual paralegal, investigative, 
or clerical work on the same case.  The interpreter shall not claim paralegal, 
investigative, or clerical work as interpretation in any billings. 

During the course of the proceedings, the interpreter should refrain from conversations 
with parties, witnesses, jurors, attorneys, or with friends or relatives of any party in or 
near the courtroom, except in the discharge of their official functions.  It is especially 
important that the interpreter, who is often familiar with attorneys or other members of 
the courtroom work group, including law enforcement officers, refrain from casual and 
personal conversations with anyone in the court that may convey an appearance of a 
special relationship or partiality to any of the court participants other than that of the 

6 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

professional relationship of interpreting for the appointed attorney and the non-English 
speaking party. 

An example of conversation that would be within the interpreter's duties would be: 
communicating with the non-English speaking party prior to appointment to the case in 
an informal setting where the interpreter would listen to accent, rhythm, and the choice 
of words of the non-English speaking party to determine if the interpreter can adequately 
interpret for the non-English speaking party.   

The interpreter should strive for professional detachment.  The interpreter should avoid 
all verbal and nonverbal displays of personal attitudes, prejudices, emotions, or opinions. 

Should the interpreter become aware that a proceeding participant views the interpreter 
as having a bias or being biased, the interpreter should disclose that knowledge to the 
appointed attorney.  The appointed attorney shall either petition the court for the 
appointment of a different interpreter to the case thereby releasing the interpreter from 
the interpreter's obligation in the case, or the attorney shall bring the situation to the 
attention of the court and opposing party, on the record.  If the attorney fails to bring the 
conflict to the attention of the court, the interpreter must notify the court of a potential 
conflict of interest.  This disclosure shall not include privileged or confidential 
information.  If all of the parties agree that the interpreter may serve on the case, the 
interpreter may remain on the case.   

The interpreter shall conduct himself or herself in a manner consistent with the 
dignity of the court and shall be as unobtrusive as possible. 

Commentary 

The interpreter should know and observe the established protocol, rules, and procedures 
for delivering interpreting services.  When speaking in English, the interpreter should 
speak at a rate and volume that enables the interpreter to be heard and understood 
throughout the courtroom, but the interpreter's presence should otherwise be as 
unobtrusive as possible.  The interpreter should work without drawing undue or 
inappropriate attention to himself or herself.  The interpreter should dress in a manner 
that is consistent with the dignity of the court proceedings.  

The interpreter should avoid obstructing the view of any individual involved in the 
proceeding.  An interpreter who uses sign language or other visual modes of 
communication must, however, be positioned so that the sign language, facial 
expressions and whole body movement are visible to the person for whom the 
interpreter is interpreting. 

The interpreter is encouraged to avoid personal or professional conduct that could 
discredit the court.

The interpreter shall understand the rules of privileged and other confidential 
information and shall protect the confidentiality of all privileged and other 
confidential information. 

Commentary 

The interpreter must protect and uphold the confidentiality of all privileged information 
obtained during the course of his or her duties.  It is especially important that the 
interpreter understand and uphold the attorney-client privilege that requires 
confidentiality with respect to any communication between attorney and client.  This rule 
also applies to other types of privileged communications. 

The interpreter must also refrain from repeating or disclosing case information obtained 
by the interpreter in the course of employment. 

In the event that the interpreter becomes aware of information that suggests imminent 
harm to someone or relates to a crime being committed during the course of the 
proceedings, the interpreter should immediately disclose the information to the criminal 
presiding judge or a judge who is not involved in the proceeding (if the presiding judge is 
involved in the proceeding).  At that point, it will become that judge's responsibility to 
determine what action, if any, should be taken regarding the situation. 

.      RESTRICTION OF PUBLIC COMMENT 

The interpreter shall not publicly discuss, report, or offer an opinion concerning a 
matter in which the interpreter is or has been engaged, even when that 
information is not privileged or required by law to be confidential. 

.      SCOPE OF PRACTICE 

The interpreter shall limit himself or herself to interpreting or performing sight 
translating and shall not give legal advice, express personal opinions to 
individuals for whom the interpreter is interpreting, or engage in any other 
activities that may be construed to constitute a service other than interpreting or 
translating.

Commentary 

Because the interpreter is responsible only for enabling others to communicate, the 
interpreter should limit himself or herself to the activity of interpreting or translating only.  
The interpreter should refrain from initiating communications while interpreting unless it 
is necessary for assuring an accurate and faithful interpretation. 

The interpreter may be required to initiate communications during a proceeding when 
they find it necessary to seek assistance in performing his or her duties.  Examples of 
such circumstances include seeking direction when unable to understand or express a 
word or thought, requesting speakers to moderate their rate of communication or repeat 
or rephrase something, correcting the interpreter's own interpreting errors, or notifying 
the court of reservations about his or her ability to satisfy an assignment competently.  In 
such instances, the interpreter should make it clear that the interpreter is speaking for 
himself or herself. 

The interpreter may convey legal advice only when the interpreter is interpreting legal 
advice that an attorney is giving.  The interpreter should not explain the purpose of 
forms, services, or otherwise act as a counselor or advisor unless the interpreter is 
interpreting for someone who is acting in that official capacity. 

The interpreter should not personally perform acts that are the official responsibility of 
other court officials, including, but not limited to, court clerks, pretrial release 
investigators, indigence verification specialists, or probation counselors. 

An interpreter appointed to a case should not perform bilingual paralegal, investigative, 
or clerical work on the same case.  The interpreter shall not claim paralegal, 
investigative, or clerical work as interpretation in any billings. 

.      ASSESSING AND REPORTING IMPEDIMENTS TO PERFORMANCE 

The interpreter shall assess at all times his or her ability to deliver interpretation 
services.  When the interpreter has any reservation about his or her ability to 
satisfy an assignment competently, the interpreter shall immediately convey that 
reservation to the court. 

Commentary 

If the communication mode or language of the non-English speaking person cannot be 
readily interpreted or becomes difficult to readily interpret, the interpreter should notify 
the court immediately. 

The interpreter should notify the court of any environmental or physical limitation that 
impedes or hinders the interpreter's ability to deliver interpreting services adequately, 
e.g., the courtroom is not quiet enough for the interpreter to hear or be heard by the non-
English speaker, more than one person at a time is speaking, or principals or witnesses 
of the court are speaking at a rate of speed that is too rapid for the interpreter to 
adequately interpret.  A sign language interpreter must ensure that he or she can both 

9 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

  9

 

see and convey the full range of visual language elements that are necessary for 
communication, including facial expressions and body movement, as well as sign 
language. 

The interpreter should notify the court of the need to take periodic breaks in order to 
maintain mental and physical alertness and to prevent interpreter fatigue.  The 
interpreter should recommend and encourage the court to use more than one interpreter 
in a lengthy proceeding or trial. 

Even a competent and experienced interpreter may encounter cases where routine 
proceedings suddenly involve technical or specialized terminology unfamiliar to the 
interpreter, e.g., the unscheduled testimony of an expert witness.  When such instances 
occur, the interpreter should request a brief recess in order to familiarize himself or 
herself with the subject matter.  If familiarity with the terminology requires extensive time 
or more intensive research, the interpreter should inform the judge. 

The interpreter is encouraged to make inquiries as to the nature of a case whenever 
possible before accepting an assignment.  This enables the interpreter to more closely 
match his or her professional qualifications, skills, and experience to potential 
assignments, and more accurately assess the interpreter's ability to competently satisfy 
those assignments. 

The interpreter should refrain from accepting a case if the interpreter feels the language 
and subject matter of that case may exceed his or her skills or capacities.  The 
interpreter should feel no compunction about notifying the court if the interpreter feels 
unable to perform competently due to lack of familiarity with terminology, preparation or 
difficulty in understanding a witness or defendant. 

The interpreter should notify the presiding officer of any personal bias he or she may 
have involving any aspect of the proceedings, including any bias as to the subject matter 
of the case, or bias against any of the parties in the case. 

0.      DUTY TO REPORT ETHICAL VIOLATIONS 

The interpreter shall report to the court any actions by any persons that may 
impede the interpreter's compliance with any law, any provision of this code, or 
any other official policy governing court interpreting and sight translating. 

Commentary 

Because the users of interpreting services frequently misunderstand the proper role of 
the interpreter, they may ask or expect the interpreter to perform duties or engage in 
activities that run counter to the provisions of this code or other laws, regulations, or 
policies governing court interpreters.  It is incumbent upon the interpreter to inform such 
persons of his or her professional obligations.  If, having been apprised of these 
obligations, the person persists in demanding that the interpreter violate them, the 
interpreter should turn to the court's interpreter coordinator, the trial court administrator 
or trial court clerk, or the judge to resolve the situation.

1.      PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 

The interpreter shall continually improve his or her skills and knowledge and 
advance the profession through activities such as professional training and 
education and interaction with colleagues and specialists in related fields. 

Commentary 

The interpreter must continually strive to increase his or her knowledge of the languages 
in which the interpreter works professionally, including past and current trends in 
technical, vernacular, and regional terminology, as well as their application within court 
proceedings. 

The interpreter should keep informed of all statutes, rules of courts, and policies of the 
judiciary that relate to the performance of the interpreter's professional duties. 

The interpreter should seek to elevate the standards of the profession through 
participation in workshops, professional meetings, interaction with colleagues, and 
reading current literature in the field.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
