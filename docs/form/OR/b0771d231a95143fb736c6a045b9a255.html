Glossary Development Guide 

2 

Introduction 

he purpose of this document is to guide the reader through the following concrete steps in the 
consideration  and  planning  process  for  the  development  of  a  bilingual  or  multilingual  legal 
glossary: 

tep 1: Identify your audience and setting 

Step 2: Define the overall scope of the glossary  
Step 3: Determine the organization and structure of the glossary 
Step 4: Identify the best platform for delivery of the glossary 
Step 5: Select and coordinate a team of legal and linguist subject matter experts   
Step 6: Develop an ongoing maintenance plan 

ach of these steps is described in detail, with examples provided where appropriate. The examples 

and suggested approaches to each step account for challenges that arise with languages that: 

●  are  spoken  in  countries  with  legal  systems  that  differ  significantly  from  the  U.S.  legal 

system; 

●  have a low 1:1 correspondence with English legal terms; and 
●  use a non-Latin alphabet or present other script-based formatting challenges. 

inally, the document contains a sample project plan, with discrete tasks, responsible leads and 

proposed timeframes for completion. 

hese  guidelines  are  intended  for  use  by  language  access  coordinators  and  other  court-based 

administrators who are considering the development of tools for legal interpreters.   

ote:  Prior to beginning any bilingual or multilingual legal glossary development project, it will 
be essential to review the budgetary resources available for initial development tasks, as well as 
resources  available  for  ongoing  maintenance.  Budgetary  resources  should  be  considered  when 
determining the overall scope of the glossary development project, as well as the platform for the 
delivery  of  the  glossary.  Information  provided  by  language  access  program  managers  and 
estimates included in the Policy for the Development and Modification of Test Inventory indicate 
that legal glossary development costs can range from $13,000–$35,000 for the initial development 
of a standard glossary document of legal terms in both English and the target foreign language (not 
including  the  development  or  implementation  of  a  glossary  database).  Final  costs  can  vary 
depending  on  a  number  of  factors  including,  but  not  limited  to:  available  linguist  expertise  to 
develop the glossary (in-house staff resources vs. contractor work); linguistic resources, such as 
legal reference documents to support the glossary development; level of complexity to create a 
text-based  document  (which  may  contain  two  different  language  fonts)  in  a  final,  searchable 
format; and delivery platform. This initial estimate would not include costs for future maintenance 
of the legal glossary.  Maintenance costs will depend on the scope and volume of work needed 
during future revision processes.

Step-by-Step Guide 

tep 1: Identify your audience and setting  

uch like the development of an organization’s mission statement, asking and answering a series 
of threshold questions will help you clearly define the purpose of your glossary from the outset. 
Later decisions regarding glossary elements, subject matter experts and presentation will all  be 
informed by and benefit from these initial considerations. 

hreshold considerations in the development of a legal glossary are: 

●  Who is the intended user of the glossary?   
●  What does the intended user do? 
●  Where do they work? 
●  Whom does the user serve? 

ome possible answers to each of the above questions include: 

Q: Who is the intended user of the glossary?  
A: Interpreters, translators, bilingual court staff, bilingual agency staff  

: What does the intended user do? 

A: Consecutive interpretation, simultaneous interpretation, translation, sight translation, provide 
direct service in-language  

: Where do they work? 

A: Courtroom, court clerk’s office or other courthouse location, justice partner or court-affiliated 
agency 

: Whom does the user serve? 

A: Litigants only, litigants’ family members, court personnel, the general public 

he following is an example that answers the threshold questions for a sample project to develop 

a bilingual English/Burmese glossary of legal terms. 

xample*:  This  glossary  is  meant  to  serve  as  a  resource  for  English↔Burmese  interpreters 
working in criminal court. Interpreters will be providing in-court interpretation for LEP Burmese 
speakers who are accused of a crime and their family members who attend court proceedings. 

We will use the English/Burmese glossary proposal for our examples throughout this document.

Step 2: Define the overall scope of the glossary  

 glossary is distinguished from a dictionary in that a dictionary captures both general and 

technical terminology, while a glossary is a specialized list of words and phrases. A multilingual 
glossary will provide a specialized list, preferably with a definition, along with an equivalent 
translation.  

he following considerations should be taken into account in the identification of the scope of 

the glossary: 
 

●  Determine what terminology the glossary will contain. The following are some examples 

of the scope of existing glossaries:  

legal terms specific to a state or region 

○ 
○  family law 
○  criminal law 
○  civil law 
○  drugs 
○  weapons 
○ 
○  medical 
○  profanity & slang 

traffic & automotive 

 

●  Identify what, if any, existing multilingual glossaries in the selected language 

combination are readily available to language professionals, and if they can be used for 
the purposes defined under Step 1.  
 

●  Gather existing monolingual glossaries that can serve as a base list of terms. [Links to 

several existing glossaries are provided in Appendix A.] 
 

Upon selection and coordination of a team of subject matter experts (step 5), the scope of the 
glossary should be reviewed to ensure that language experts agree with the content 
determination.  

xample: Because this glossary will be used exclusively for criminal court matters, we will be 
looking for a base group of terms for criminal court that apply to the laws of this state. We will 
base the Burmese/English glossary on the English terms already identified in the 
Spanish/English glossary.

Step 3: Determine the organization and structure of the glossary  

lossary Structure and Organization 

he core of any bilingual glossary is the list of words in English and their equivalents in the 

Target Language. The intended audience and scope (Steps 1 and 2) will determine how complex 
your glossary should be, how to organize your glossary, and what elements to include. Some 
questions for you to consider when planning the glossary include: 
 

●  Will the glossary be bidirectional or unidirectional? 

○  Unidirectional glossaries are organized for users to look up words in one 

language. Bidirectional glossaries can be used to look up terms in both English 
and the Target Language. Bidirectional glossaries are more complex, but may be 
useful depending on the needs of your users. 

●  How will the terminology of the glossary be laid out? 

○  The most basic glossary will be an alphabetical list of terms. Depending on the 

scope of your glossary (Step 2) and needs of your users, you may decide to break 
up the terminology in the glossary into multiple sections based on topic, area of 
law, or other criteria.  

●  Will the glossary include content beyond the legal terminology? Other sections or 

appendices in your glossary could include: 
 

○  Introduction 
○  Abbreviation/label guide (for abbreviations used in word entries), 
○  Usage guide 
○  Copyright information 
○  Bibliographic/reference information 
○  List of commonly used phrases in court 
○  Court signage 
○  Problematic vocabulary (false friends, Latin terms, French terms, etc.) 

egal terminology contains certain types of expressions that can pose challenges to the glossary 

structure. Some considerations include: 

●  How multiword expressions and phrases will be listed. For example:  
○  “beyond a reasonable doubt” vs “reasonable doubt, beyond a” 

“rape, statutory” vs “statutory rape”  
“hung jury” vs “jury, hung” 

Cross references can direct users for potentially confusing vocabulary. For example: 
“hung jury: see jury, hung”  

●  How are terms of art and common words that have a specialized legal meaning to be 

defined? Examples of this kind of vocabulary are: “stay”, “standing”, “party”, and “with

●  How are abbreviations and acronyms to be listed? Depending on how common these 

terms are, they could be listed in their abbreviated forms or full forms. They could also be 
listed in a separate section of the glossary for reference.  

prejudice“ 

tructure of Word Entry 

he minimum components of a bilingual glossary entry are the English term and the equivalent 

term in the Target Language. Depending on the needs of your users, you may also include 
additional elements for all or some of your glossary entries, such as: 

●  English definition 
●  Target language definition 
●  Part of speech 
●  Description of register 
●  Pronunciation guide (pronunciation could be included for all entries or limited to 

challenging entries, such as Latin or French terms. For example “amicus curiea”, “voir 
dire”) 

●  Transliteration of non-Latin characters (for languages using a writing system different 

from English) 

●  Description of usage 
●  Context/example sentences 

ppendix B illustrates how some of the elements listed above have been incorporated in existing 

glossaries. 
Example: This glossary will contain the following components: 
-English term 
-Target language term 
-Transliteration of term 
-Description of usage 
Because Burmese is a language written with non-Latin characters, this glossary will contain a 
transliteration of terms. Because Burmese has a low 1:1 correspondence of legal terms, this 
glossary will contain a description of the usage of each word.   

tep 4: Identify the best platform for delivery of the glossary  

  glossary  of  legal  terms  can  be  as  simple  as  two  columns  in  a  Microsoft  Word  table,  or  as 
complicated  as  a  large-scale  searchable  database  of  terms,  which  includes  multiple  languages, 
definitions of terms in the source and/or target languages, and other indications of register and 
appropriate use. A glossary can be developed in a variety of software applications and presented 
either on paper or online.

•  Can be appropriate when there are fewer languages/fewer glossary elements. 
•  Good for formats that are particularly text-heavy (ex:  use of definitions). 
•  Can be converted to hard-copy format easily. 

•  Does not allow for sorting or other organizational functions. 

•  Particularly helpful for multiple, single-word entries. 
•  Can be a good choice when presenting glossary entries in a variety of ways. 
•  Can allow for sorting based on source and target language, alphabetical order or 

according to other criteria or groupings depending on design). 

•  Would not be the best platform for printing in hard-copy format. 

•  Can include robust functionality for terminology management. 
•  Can be appropriate for glossary with multiple elements and text-heavy entries. 
•  Can allow for various organizational strategies (searching through “queries”).

dvantage(s): 

The identification of the most appropriate software application for development of a glossary will 
depend on consideration of the following factors: 
 

●  How many languages will be included? 
●  How many elements will the glossary have and how text-heavy are these elements? 
●  How will the glossary be accessed by users?   

ome examples of glossary development tools include the following (listed in order from least to 

Disadvantage(s): 

•  May require purchase of platform for use. 
•  May require ongoing maintenance of the platform (in addition to routine 

updates/maintenance of glossary entries). 
 

Translation Software

Disadvantage(s): 

•  Can include a number of functions, including computer-assisted translation, machine 

translation, translation management and glossary development. 

•  Could be used for other translation efforts in the courts or legal settings. 

•  Software can be costly and may require some training/expertise to use. 
•  May not be the ideal investment if the software will not be used/leveraged for other 

translation projects. 

xample: Given budget constraints, the particularities of the Burmese language, and its 

intended use, this glossary will be developed in Microsoft Word, produced as a PDF and made 
available electronically and in hard copy to Burmese interpreters working in the court. 

tep 5: Select and coordinate a team of legal and linguist subject matter experts  

egal and linguist subject matter experts (“SME”) will collaborate on the development, testing, 

and review of the glossary.  

he glossary project should be led by a court employee or delegated lead. This Project Manager 
will facilitate communications, coordinate meetings, oversee budgetary considerations and assist 
the project team as needed. Appendix B contains a Sample Project Plan for the Development of a 
Bilingual Legal Glossary. 

 Legal SME will be selected based on the scope of the project, as outlined in step 2. This 
expert is not required to speak a language other than English, but rather should have extensive 
knowledge and practical experience in the legal area covered in the project scope. It is 
recommended to have one or two Legal SMEs on the project team.  

 Language SME is a linguistic expert in the language identified in the project. The Language 
SME is not required to be an interpreter. It is recommended to have one or two Language SMEs 
on the project team.

At least one Interpreter SME on the project is also recommended. The ideal interpreter team 
member would be credentialed in the language combination identified in the project and have 
recent court experience. If no credentialing is available for the project’s language combination, a 
practicing interpreter in the glossary language or a certified interpreter in another language can 
provide interpreting expertise for the project team. It is recommended to have one or two 
interpreters on the project team. 

xample: The glossary development and review team is composed of a Burmese language 

professor (language SME), a bilingual Burmese/English attorney practicing in the U.S. and two 
Burmese court interpreters. The Project Manager is the Interpreter Coordinator for X Court. 

tep 6: Develop an ongoing maintenance plan 

anguage is always evolving, and a legal glossary will never be complete. It is important to keep 
the original intent and scope of the project in mind when defining an ongoing maintenance plan. 
General  glossaries  that  contain  only  legal  terminology  may  need  less  regular  revision  than 
glossaries  that  include  terms  specific  to  a  region  or  state,  or  than  those  that  include  colloquial 
terms.  

he project plan should provide a mechanism for the submission of content concerns such as errors 
or  omissions,  as  well  as  suggestions  for  additional  translation  options  or  new  terms.  Revision 
suggestions should include the current entry, the suggested change or addition, and a reference to 
a published source that supports the recommendation.  

xisting revision mechanisms include: 

●  email inbox 
●  phone number that leads to a voicemail inbox 
●  website form  
●  paper form that can be delivered or emailed 

he Project Manager or designee will compile all suggestions and categorize them by the response 
required.  If  the  suggestion  involves  formatting,  grammatical  or  spelling  changes,  the  Project 
Manager may update the glossary, documenting all changes. If the suggestions involve legal and 
language issues, the Revision Team will be convened.  

he Revision Team will be tasked with reviewing all suggested legal and language revisions on a 
periodic  basis  and  making  a  determination  regarding  inclusion  in  the  glossary.  The  team  can 
consist of the original project team members or other experts in the same three industries (law, 
language and interpretation).  

he updated glossary should reflect the revision date, and all changes should be documented to 

avoid the duplication of suggested considerations in the future.

Appendix B: Examples of Glossary Entries from Bilingual Legal Glossaries 

his appendix provides sample entries from existing legal glossaries. These samples illustrate 
some of the types of information a glossary entry can have and how the information can be laid 
out.  

Basic Entry 

This entry from a French glossary1 illustrates the most basic kind of entry for a bilingual 
glossary, showing the legal term in English and the equivalent in the TL. 

 

nique Considerations   

This entry from a Chinese glossary2 is very basic, but it illustrates how some languages have 
unique characteristics that need to be considered. This entry includes two TL examples because 
the Chinese writing system has two varieties: Traditional characters and Simplified characters.  

efinitions 

Many glossaries contain a definition of the term in English, the TL, or both languages. The entry 
below comes from a Cantonese glossary3 that includes English definitions for potentially 
problematic terms, such as the word “hearing,” which has a general meaning and a special legal 
meaning.

Glossaries can also indicate the part of speech of the term as this Arabic glossary6 indicates. This 
glossary also includes definitions for both English and the TL.  

ronunciation Guide 

English spelling can be very complex and can pose many challenges for non-Native speakers. 
Some glossaries include a key to help with pronunciation of some terms. This Tagalog glossary7 
includes a pronunciation guide immediately after the English term. 

This Amharic glossary8 entry includes both a pronunciation of the English term in the Amharic 
script and the pronunciation of the Amharic term in Latin characters.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
