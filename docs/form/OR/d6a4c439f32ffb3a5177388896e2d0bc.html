his document is a supplemental guide to CJO 15-026, the Uniform Trial Court Rules (UTCR) 

Chapter 21, and other applicable Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure (ORCP) and UTCRs. Use 
this guide to ensure a successful eFiling experience and avoid returned eFilings through the 
OJD eFiling (File and Serve) system.  

STANDARDS FOR ACCEPTANCE 

The Oregon Circuit Courts accept filings submitted through the OJD eFiling (File and Serve) 
system unless such filing falls under a specific reason to return that filing as defined in CJO 15-
026. When a filing does not meet the standards for acceptance, the court will return the filing to 
the eFiler (through email notification) and provide a reason for that return. The technical term 
that File and Serve uses for this return is Rejection. 

CURING A RETURNED FILING AND RELATION BACK 

Returned filings that are cured and resubmitted to the court can have their filing date relate-back 
to the original submittal date of that filing. The process and rules can be found under UTCR 
21.080(5). Please note that there are specific deadlines that must be met under the rule or your 
relation-back request will be denied. 

WHY eFILINGS ARE RETURNED 

The Oregon Judicial Department strives to provide an open and efficient court system. 
Electronic Filings (eFilings) that do not meet the standards for acceptance will result in 
significant issues to court operations and technical problems with our multiple Oregon eCourt 
systems.  For this reason, the Oregon Circuit Courts will not accept filings if they fall into one of 
three broad categories: 

1)  The filing fails to comply with an eFiling process requirement; 
2)  The filing fails to comply with a Uniform Trial Court Rule or ORCP 9E; or 
3)  The filing includes or has encountered a technical error. 

The following pages discuss each specific reason for the return of an eFiling under these broad 
categories. This includes the description of the reason for return that will appear in the court’s 
notification to you and how to avoid a returned filing. The technical term that File and Serve 
uses for this return is Rejection. 

NOTE:  Several codes contain a requirement for [Court Input].  When this is noted, the court will 
provide the applicable information necessary for resubmission.

nitiates a New Case When a Case Already Exists 
•  Rejection Description:  This case already exists, please file through the existing case. 

•  How to avoid this rejection reason: The court will return a filing if there is an attempt to file 
a new case, but a case already exists. This can occur when the eFiler clicks NEW CASE 
instead of typing the case number and clicking Go. 

             

 

NOTE:  If a case exists, always type the case number into the search box or file directly from 
your workspace. NEW CASE should only be used when filing an initiating pleading (e.g. 
Complaint, Petition, etc.) 

Wrong Case Type Selected When Initiating a Case 
•  Rejection Description: The wrong case type was selected, please use the following case 

•  How to avoid this rejection reason: The court will return the filing if the incorrect case type 

was selected when initiating a case.  

Filers should select a specific code (e.g. Property – Foreclosure; Tort – Malpractice) if one 
exists. If no specific case type fits, select one of the generic case types (e.g. Contract, Tort - 
General, Property – General). 

If you are looking for a case type and you cannot find it, consult the Filing Code Quick 
Reference Guide under the LEARN section on the OJD eFiling login page.

  How to avoid these rejection reasons: The court will return a filing if the incorrect filing 

code was selected. There are hundreds of codes within the system; correctly labeling a filing 
will ensure that court case tracking will occur properly and that the proper fees are available 
for selection. 

eFilers should select a specific code (e.g. Motion – Continuance) if one exists. If no specific 
code exists for what is being filed, select the generic filing code that most corresponds to the 
filing (e.g. Motion, Affidavit, Notice). The Filing Code Quick Reference Guide can provide 
guidance on what filing code to use in some specific situations. This guide can be found 
under the LEARN section on the File and Serve login page.  

OTE (b-d): For filing a proposed document, please consult the Proposed Order Quick 

Reference Guide under the LEARN section for more information. 

Duplicate Filing 
•  Rejection Description: This is a duplicate filing, please check your records. 

•  How to avoid this rejection reason: The court will return a filing if it is found that a 

document or documents have already been eFiled through File and Serve or conventionally 
filed into the same case. 

Check with others in the office to make sure no one else has either eFiled or conventionally 
filed the same document(s).

document does not have a case number. 
 

•  How to avoid this rejection reason: Before converting a document to PDF, ensure the 
case number appears on the document (unless this is an initial filing). Once the filing 
process begins, ensure that the case number appearing on the File and Serve screens 
matches the number on the document.

Failure to Comply with a UTCR/ORCP 

 

ubmitted a Document that Does Not Meet ORCP/UTCR Requirements 

(UTCR 21.040(4)) 
•  Rejection Description: Document does not meet ORCP/UTCR Requirements. See UTCR 

21.040(4). 
 

•  How to avoid this rejection reason: Documents submitted through File and Serve should 
meet all of the formatting requirements for filing a document over the counter. Each PDF 
document, if printed out, must meet those requirements. 

Submitted a Document that Must Be Presented at Ex Parte UTCR 
21.070(3)(m)) 
•  Rejection Description: Ex Parte Filing: Please submit this document at Ex Parte. See 

UTCR 21.070(3)(m). 
 

•  How to avoid this rejection reason: Each circuit court may, under UTCR 21.070(3)(m), list 
any stipulated or ex parte matter under SLR 2.501 that must be presented in person. Check 
the court’s SLR 2.501 for a list of these filings. 

Parties Entered Incorrectly (UTCR 21.040(5)) 
•  Rejection Description: Parties entered incorrectly. See UTCR 21.040(5). 

•  How to avoid this rejection reason: Filing will be returned if the eFiler does any of the 

following when entering party information on the Parties screen: 

 

 

a.  Enter a party’s name using all capital letters (parties must be entered in proper case). 
b.  Adding a DBA, AKA, C/O or other name in an address field. 

NOTE: Court staff will enter this information into the case management system after 
accepting a filing. 

c.  Failing to include all parties contained on the documentation. 
d.  Entering an additional defendant on a criminal case.

e.  Entering a victim on a criminal case. 
f.  Adding an attorney as a party or adding a duplicate party to assign an attorney on the 

case. 
NOTE: If an attorney is already listed as representing a party in the case management 
system and you are now representing that party, file proper documentation with the court 
and the court will add your record. 

g.  Adding a party that is redacted in File and Serve, resulting in a duplicate party in the 

case management system. 
NOTE: If party names are redacted (e.g. juvenile, parent, adoptee, victim, etc.) do not 
add an additional party record on the case. Party names and identifying information for 
certain individuals are confidential. 

h.  Failing to add a new party (3rd party defendant or plaintiff) to the case. 

Submitted a Document that Must Be Filed Conventionally (UTCR 21.070(3)) 
•  Rejection Description: This document must be filed conventionally. See UTCR 21.070(3). 

•  How to avoid this rejection reason: Become familiar with the list of documents and cases 
that fall under UTCR 21.070(3). One of the most common filings that get returned for this 
reason is a Motion for Remedial Contempt. 

Proposed Order or Judgment that Contains an Invalid Date Line (UTCR 
21.040(3)) 
•  Rejection Description: The proposed order or judgment contains an invalid date line. See 

   

 

UTCR 21.040(3). 
 

•  How to avoid this rejection reason: UTCR 21.040(3) provides an example of a proper 

date line for these filings. Part of what Oregon eCourt provides for the judges is the ability to 
electronically sign (eSign) documents. When a judge eSigns a document the date is 
stamped above their signature. The most commonly used INVALID date line is “Dated this 
______ of ______.” Using this type of date line will result in a returned filing. 
 

Filings and Documents with Fee Issues (UTCR 21.050(1)) 
•  Rejection Descriptions: 

a.  No payment for filing fee included (See UTCR 21.050(1)), please resubmit with fee: 

b.  Incorrect filing fee or incorrect responsible party was selected (see UTCR 21.050(1)):

  How to avoid these rejection reasons: Statutory filing fees must be paid at the time of 
filing. Ensure that the filing code selected has the proper filing fee available. These filing 
fees are listed as “Optional Services”. Select the appropriate Optional Service and click 
Add.

not part of the primary document it should be its own PDF, this includes affidavits or 
declarations that are not an attachment to the underlying primary document. 

Document Contains a Proposed Order or Judgment and a Motion as a 
Single PDF (UTCR 21.040(2)(a)) 
•  Rejection Description: Proposed Documents must be submitted as separate documents in 

the same envelope. See UTCR 21.040(2)(a). 
 

•  How to avoid this rejection reason: In an envelope containing a proposed order or 
judgment, the proposed order or judgment should be a separate PDF from supporting 
documentation (such as a motion) but all of the documents should be submitted in the same 
eFiling envelope. For example, if submitting a motion with an affidavit attachment and a 
proposed order: 
a.  Select the proper motion filing code and upload the combined Motion/Affidavit document 

under that code. 

b.  Click Add Another Filing. 
c.  Select Order – Proposed – PPOR as the filing code and upload the proposed order. 

The two major reasons a filing is returned under this rule are 1) the filer combined the 
motion and order document into a single PDF, or 2) the motion is eFiled in one envelope 
and the proposed order is eFiled in another envelope. 

Document that Fails to Meet the Signature Requirements of UTCR 21.090 
•  Rejection Description: Document fails to meet signature requirements. See UTCR 21.090. 

 

•  How to avoid this rejection reason: The court will return filings that don’t have a proper 
original or electronic signature or a document that must be, but is not, notarized. The rule 
does not have a detailed requirement on what constitutes an electronic signature, but it does 
give examples, such as a scanned handwritten signature or a signature block that includes 
the typed named of the signer preceded by s/. 

PDF Document with a Confidential Attachment Included in the Document 
(UTCR 21.040(2)(b)) 
•  Rejection Description: A PDF document contains a confidential document that must be a 

separate PDF. See UTCR 21.040(2)(b). 
 

•  How to avoid this rejection reason: Any document required by law to be confidential, such 

as a Confidential Information Form (CIF) or Segregated Information Sheet, must be

to the court are public and do not fall under this rule.    

 

Proposed Order or Judgment Without a Certificate of Readiness (UTCR 
5.100) 
•  Rejection Description: A proposed order or judgment must include a Certificate of 

Readiness attached to the proposed order or judgment. See UTCR 5.100. 
 

•  How to avoid this rejection reason: For all proposed orders or judgments that fall under 
UTCR 5.100, a Certificate of Readiness must be included as the last page of the PDF that 
contains the proposed order or judgment submitted to the court.  

Technical Errors (Either by the eFiler or the System) 

ocument Submitted With One or More Illegible Pages 

•  Rejection Description: One or more of the pages is illegible. 

•  How to avoid this rejection reason: After converting a document to PDF format, view the 
document in electronic form before uploading and submitting through File and Serve to 
ensure it is legible. 

Document Submitted With One or More Upside-Down or Sideways Pages 
•  Rejection Description: One or more of the pages is upside-down and /or sideways. 

•  How to avoid this rejection reason: After converting a document to PDF format, view the 
document in electronic form before uploading and submitting through File and Serve to 
ensure all pages are right-side up.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
