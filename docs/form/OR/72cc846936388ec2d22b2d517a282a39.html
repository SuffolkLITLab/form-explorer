English Definition
Local Citizen Review Boards review cases every 6 months for each child in 
substitute care under the custody of the Department of Human Services 
(DHS). The board reviews both the court records and the agency records 
involving the child. The board sends its findings and recommendations to the 
court, DHS, and other participants in the review. DHS must implement the 
board's recommendations or, within 17 days of receiving the 
recommendations, give the board written notice if DHS does not intend to 
implement the recommendations.
The court also reviews the findings and recommendations; it may choose to 
set a court hearing to review them with the parties. The court must give 
written notice to the board if the court changes the recommendations or 
takes action on the case as a result of the board's recommendations.  The 
board's recommendations become part of the court's case file and part of the 
DHS case file. 
The CRB review process for delinquency cases is a collaborative model 
wherein CRB and Oregon Youth Authority (OYA) review information about 
youth offenders in substitute care, with the participation of other legal and/or 
interested parties in the case when appropriate, and citizen reviewers make 
case findings and recommendations.

case against the juvenile or after a juvenile’s pleading true to the charges

the best interests of the child against the need to sanction the child for his or 
her actions. If the juvenile is adjudicated a delinquent, the probation staff 
prepares a social history of the youth and his family and recommends a 
disposition. After reviewing the social history and various recommendations, 
the court enters a disposition. Among the possible juvenile sanctions are a 
warning, probation, restitution, counseling, or placement in a juvenile-
detention facility. Probation is the most common sanction. – Also termed

something, such as a tax or fine, according to an established rate; the tax of 
fine so imposed. The Unitary Assessment must ALWAYS be added in the UCJ. 
If the Judge waives the UA, it still has to be added to the revenue table. Once 
it is in the revenue table, the modifier for Waived (WV) can be added. See the 
Criminal Assessments and Fees table in your handbook to determine the 
amount of the Unitary Assessment. If a FINE is imposed, the UA cannot be 
waived by statute.

137.290 Unitary assessment; amount; waiver. (1) In all cases of conviction for 
the commission of a crime or violation, excluding parking violations, the trial 
court, whether a circuit, justice or municipal court, shall impose upon the 
defendant, in addition to any other monetary obligation imposed, a unitary 
assessment under this section. Except when the person successfully asserts 
the defense set forth in ORS 419C.522, the unitary assessment shall also be 
imposed by the circuit court and county court in juvenile cases under ORS 
419C.005 (1). The unitary assessment is a penal obligation in the nature of a 
fine and shall be in an amount as follows:

(a) $107 in the case of a felony.

(3) Subject to subsection (4) of this section, the court in any case may waive 
payment of the unitary assessment, in whole or in part, if, upon consideration, 
the court finds that payment of the assessment or portion thereof would 
impose upon the defendant a total monetary obligation inconsistent with 
justice in the case. In making its determination under this subsection, the 
court shall consider:

(a) The financial resources of the defendant and the burden that payment of 
the unitary assessment will impose, with due regard to the other obligations 
of the defendant; and
(b) The extent to which such burden can be alleviated by allowing the 
defendant to pay the monetary obligations imposed by the court on an 
installment basis or on other conditions to be fixed by the court.
