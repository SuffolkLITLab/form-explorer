When you are asked by an attorney or party in the case to be a witness in a remote hearing, there are rules that 
must be followed to make sure that your testimony is considered. 

Remote hearings are any hearings where parties to a case appear from a remote location not in the courthouse. 
These hearings may be attended by members of the public and are hosted by the courts through Webex Events. 

Preparing to be a Witness 

Verify the date(s) and time(s) for the scheduled hearing for which you will be providing testimony. 
• 
•  Wait to join the remote hearing until prompted by the individual requesting testimony or the court. 
• 

Confirm the approximate start- and end-time that you are expected to be available with the individual requesting your 
testimony. 
Court may run longer or more quickly than anticipated, please be available for the entire time requested. 

• 
•  Maintain open communication with the individual requesting testimony to receive updates on the timeline for your 

• 

testimony. 
Contact the person requesting your testimony and let them know if any of the following apply so they may coordinate 
with the court: 

o  Your contact phone number or email address changes. 
o  You are unable to find a private, quiet location with reliable internet connectivity or phone coverage to 

provide your testimony. 

o  You do not have a phone or reliable phone service. 
o  You do not have childcare or coverage for other caregiver responsibilities. 
o  You require an interpreter and the language required. 
o  You need any ADA accommodations. 

• 

Communicate with the person requesting your testimony and the court to determine how you will join the hearing at 
the appropriate time. 

o  The clerk may call you and transfer you into the hearing via audio only. 
o  You may be sent a link to click and join through a web browser at the appropriate time. See instructions on 

joining Webex. 

•  Once you join the remote hearing, you will be sworn in by the clerk. If connecting through audio only, you will be 

• 

asked to recite the oath. 
Follow to the instructions provided by the judge, including whether you may remain connected to the remote hearing 
when you are not testifying and whether you may listen to the court proceedings. 

Participating in a Remote Hearing as a Witness 

You should be alone in the physical room where you are located (or with your attorney). It is expected that all 
electronic devices, other than the one used to access the remote hearing, are turned off during the testimony. No 
other programs or windows should be open on your device or computer.
