      <pre>The 2021 Legislative Assembly enacted Oregon Laws 2021, chapter 643, initially 
introduced as Senate Bill 48 (2021) by the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission, to 
reduce reliance on security release and provide statewide guidance for local pretrial 
release orders. 

Section 2 of Oregon Laws 2021, chapter 643, now codified as ORS 135.233, requires 
the following: 

a. 

b. 

The Presiding Judge of a judicial district shall enter a standing pretrial release 
order, specifying to the sheriff of the county, or to the entity supervising the local 
correctional facility responsible for pretrial incarceration within the judicial district, 
both the persons who are, and the offenses that are: 

Subject to release on recognizance; 

Subject to release with special conditions as specified in the order; and 

Not eligible for release until arraignment. 

 
The Chief Justice, with input from a Chief Justice-appointed criminal justice 
advisory committee, shall establish release guidelines for Presiding Judge 
standing pretrial release orders described in subparagraph 2.a. of these findings, 
to: 

Provide a consistent release decision-making structure across the state; 

Reduce reliance on the use of security; 

Include provisions for victim notification and input; and 

Balance the rights of the defendant and presumption of pretrial release 
against community and victim safety, and the risk of failure to appear.

The Oregon Judicial Department (OJD) Criminal Justice Advisory Committee (CJAC) 
has recommended to the Chief Justice pretrial release guidelines to govern Presiding 
Judge standing pretrial release orders.  The CJAC recommendations were developed by 
the CJAC’s Pretrial Subcommittee, which included representatives from courts, district 
attorneys and defense attorneys, appellate attorneys, community-based service 
providers and legal service providers for crime victims, law enforcement, community 
corrections, state and local government, and the Oregon State Bar.

4. 

The CJAC’s recommendations and the release guidelines established in this order are 
based on legislative changes resulting from Oregon Laws 2021, chapter 643, effective 
July 1, 2022, including the following: 

a. 

b. 

c. 

Circuit courts will no longer utilize security schedules that apply immediately 
upon a defendant’s arrest; 

Instead, in accordance with a standing pretrial release order as described in 
paragraph 2 of these findings, either a judicial district’s pretrial release program 
or the local correctional facility (i.e., the sheriff or the entity supervising the local 
correctional facility) will determine immediate release; and 

If a defendant remains in custody at arraignment, the court may consider security 
release if the court concludes that recognizance release and conditional release 
are unwarranted. 

This order establishes the release guidelines for Presiding Judge standing pretrial 
release orders, with input from CJAC and as required under ORS 135.233(2). 

 HEREBY ORDER AS FOLLOWS: 

The release guidelines set out in Attachment A are established for the purposes required 
under Oregon Laws 2021, chapter 643, and apply to any standing Presiding Judge 
Pretrial Release Order (PRO) required under ORS 135.233(1). 

Each Presiding Judge of a circuit court shall enter a standing PRO as required under 
ORS 135.233(1) that complies with the guidelines set out in Attachment A.  An order 
entered under this paragraph shall include an operative date of July 1, 2022. 

The State Court Administrator is authorized to determine the release guideline category 
into which each Oregon felony and misdemeanor falls, in accordance with Attachment A, 
and shall create a list setting out that determination (“Release Guidelines Categorization 
List”).  The State Court Administrator shall regularly update the Release Guidelines 
Categorization List and make it publicly available on the OJD website.  The Release 
Guidelines Categorization List is intended to be available as a tool to assist the sheriff of 
the county, or the entity supervising the local correctional facility, with the application of 
the release guidelines established in this order. 

This order is effective immediately. 

Dated this    7th   day of June, 2022.

ATTACHMENT A 
 

CHIEF JUSTICE RELEASE GUIDELINES GOVERNING PRESIDING JUDGE STANDING 
PRETRIAL RELEASE ORDERS (ORS 135.233) 
 

Creation and Effect of Standing Pretrial Release Order (PRO); Required Methodology 

 Presiding Judge shall create and enter a standing Pretrial Release Order (PRO) that directs 

the entity supervising the local correctional facility to determine whether a defendant will be 
released on recognizance, released on conditions, or held for arraignment in accordance with 
Guidelines 1, 2, and 3, set out below.  A PRO also may direct the entity supervising the local 
correctional facility to hold a defendant for arraignment or release a defendant on conditional 
release based on objective, nondiscretionary, person-specific criteria (“overriding 
circumstances”), as provided in the PRO and consistent with Guideline 4, also set out below. 

he methodology just described creates a two-step decision-making process:  (1) identifying the 

offenses in accordance with Guidelines 1, 2, and 3; and then, if applicable, (2) identifying any 
“overriding circumstances.” 

n addition to the offenses described in Guidelines 1, 2, and 3, a PRO may direct the entity 
supervising the local correctional facility whether to release on recognizance, release on 
conditions, or hold for arraignment persons arrested on warrants, contempt charges, and 
probation violations. 

ach Presiding Judge should work closely with the court’s local public safety stakeholders to 

create the PRO for the judicial district and should structure the PRO to utilize already-
established local pretrial release resources. 

nce entered, a PRO provides release direction to the entity supervising the local correctional 
facility.  A PRO does not have the effect of delegating judicial release decision-making authority. 

he State Court Administrator maintains a Release Guidelines Categorization List of all Oregon 

misdemeanor and felony crimes, with each crime organized by release guideline category, as 
set out in this attachment, that is publicly available on the Oregon Judicial Department website.  
The Release Guidelines Categorization List is intended to be available as a tool to assist the 
sheriff of the county, or the entity supervising the local correctional facility, with the application of 
these guidelines.

Guideline 1 

 PRO shall direct the entity supervising the local correctional facility to release on 

recognizance, on a release agreement with the general conditions in ORS 135.250, all 
defendants charged with the following offenses: 
 

Any non-person misdemeanor, except those offenses listed in Guideline 2 or 3; 

Any non-person Class C felony, except those offenses listed in Guideline 2 or 
3; 

Any driving while suspended offense defined in ORS 811.182, except for 
aggravated driving while suspended as defined in ORS 163.196; and 

Any other offense that is not included in Guideline 2 or 3. 

uideline 2 

 PRO shall direct the entity supervising the local correctional facility to release on court-

imposed conditions all defendants charged with the following offenses: 

Any non-domestic violence person misdemeanor, as defined in OAR 213-003-
0001(15); 

Any driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII) offense, as defined in 
ORS 813.010 and ORS 813.011; and 

Any non-domestic violence Class B felony and any non-domestic violence 
person Class C felony as defined in OAR 213-003-0001(14), except for those 
offenses included in Guideline 3. 

 PRO shall include specific conditions of release consistent with ORS 135.260.  Any release 

condition imposed should be available for a defendant’s compliance within the county and 
should be the least onerous condition necessary to ensure both public and victim safety, and 
that the defendant returns to court as required. 

 PRO shall specify if the release conditions provided in the PRO will apply to every person 
charged with a specific offense or, instead, to individual defendants based on either criteria 
provided in the PRO or resulting from a risk assessment that is conducted consistent with the 
law and that is reliable, unbiased, and validated consistent with these Guidelines. 

f a PRO directs or permits the sheriff or the entity supervising the local correctional facility to 
use a risk assessment tool to determine which conditions of release are appropriate for a 
specific defendant, then the PRO shall direct the sheriff or entity supervising the local 
correctional facility as to how and when certain release conditions must be imposed. 

ourts must strive to ensure that release conditions are available to all defendants and not 

contingent upon a defendant’s ability to pay.

n addition to the offense-specific categories described in Guidelines 1, 2, and 3, a PRO also 
may identify person-specific overriding circumstances that, if present, will require a sheriff or 
entity supervising the local correctional facility to either (1) release the defendant on 
conditional release; or (2) hold the defendant for arraignment.  If a PRO identifies overriding 
circumstances, the following apply: 
 

The PRO must specify objective, nondiscretionary, person-specific criteria that 
constitute overriding circumstances.  That criteria may include a score from a 
risk assessment tool that is adopted in a manner consistent with these 
Guidelines. 

The PRO may direct that, if a defendant has been held due to overriding 
circumstances, a representative of the entity determining the hold shall either 
(1) appear at arraignment to report to the court the overriding circumstances for 
the hold; or (2) provide the information in writing to the court at or before 
arraignment. 

ach judicial district should identify and consider using a risk assessment tool to assist with 
release determinations, as provided in the judicial district’s PRO.  The PRO may direct the 
entity supervising the local correctional facility as to the appropriate use of the risk 
assessment score. 

 judicial district may use risk assessment tools to inform decisions about which type of 
release is appropriate for a defendant or in setting the conditions of release.  If a judicial 
district uses a risk assessment tool, the Presiding Judge shall review the selected tool, to 
ensure that it is reliable and unbiased, and the selected tool shall be validated at least every 
five years or following significant changes to the population or laws and policies related to 
arrest/citation, detention, and sentencing.
