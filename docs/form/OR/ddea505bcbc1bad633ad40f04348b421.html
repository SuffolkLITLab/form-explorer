AN ACT

SB 755

Relating  to  substance  use;  creating  new  provisions;
amending  ORS  51.050,  135.242,  137.300,  153.012,
153.018, 153.019, 153.021, 153.064, 153.992, 161.570,

24  and  25,  chapter  2,  Oregon  Laws  2021  (Ballot
Measure  110  (2020));  repealing  sections  3  and  6,
chapter  581,  Oregon  Laws  2021  (Enrolled  Senate
Bill  497);  and  declaring  an  emergency.

Be  It  Enacted  by  the  People  of  the  State  of  Or-
egon:

FINDINGS  AND  POLICY

SECTION  1.  Section  1,  chapter  2,  Oregon  Laws
2021 (Ballot Measure 110 (2020)), is amended to read:
Sec. 1. (1)(a) The people of Oregon find that drug
addiction  and  overdoses  are  a  serious  problem  in
Oregon  and  that  Oregon  needs  to  expand  access  to
drug treatment.

(b)  The  people  of  Oregon  further  find  that  a
health-based  approach  to  addiction  and  overdose  is
more  effective,  humane  and  cost-effective  than  crim-
inal  punishments.  Making  people  criminals  because
they  suffer  from  addiction  is  expensive,  ruins  lives
and  can  make  access  to  treatment  and  recovery
more difficult.

(2)(a)  The  purpose  of  [this]  the  Drug  Addiction
Treatment  and  Recovery  Act  of  2020  is  to  make
screening,  health  assessment,  treatment  and  recov-
ery  services  for  drug  addiction  available  to  all  those
who  need  and  want  access  to  those  services  and  to
adopt  a  health  approach  to  drug  addiction  by  re-
moving  criminal  penalties  for  low-level  drug  pos-
session.

(b)  It  is  the  policy  of  the  State  of  Oregon  that
screening,  health  assessment,  treatment  and  recov-
ery  services  for  drug  addiction  are  available  to  all
those  who  need  and  want  access  to  those  services.

(3)  The  provisions  of  [this  Act]  chapter  2,  Ore-
gon  Laws  2021  (Ballot  Measure  110  (2020)),  shall
be  interpreted  consistently  with  the  findings,  pur-
poses  and  policy  objectives  stated  in  this section and
shall  not  be  limited  by  any  policy  set  forth  in  Ore-
gon  law  that  could  conflict  with  or  be  interpreted  to
conflict  with  the  purposes  and  policy  objectives
stated  in  this  section.

EXPANDING  TREATMENT  AND  SERVICES

SECTION  2.  Section  2,  chapter  2,  Oregon  Laws
2021 (Ballot Measure 110 (2020)), is amended to read:
Sec.  2.  [Grants  Program.  (1)  The  Oversight  and
Accountability  Council  shall  oversee  and  approve
grants  to  implement  Addiction  Recovery  Centers  and

increase  access  to  community  care,  as  set  forth
below.]

[(2)  Addiction  Recovery  Centers.  The  Oversight
and  Accountability  Council  shall  provide  grants  to
existing  agencies  or  organizations,  whether  govern-
ment  or  community-based,  to  create  Addiction  Recov-
ery  Centers  for  the  purposes  of  immediately  triaging
the  acute  needs  of  people  who  use  drugs  and  assess-
ing  and  addressing  any  on-going  needs  thorough  in-
tensive  case  management  and  linkage  to  care  and
services.]

[(a)  Grants  must  be  disbursed  such  that  at  least
one  center  shall  be  established  within  each  existing
coordinated  care  organization  service  area.  Centers
within  each  existing  coordinated  care  organization
service  area  shall  be  established  and  operational  by
October  1,  2021.]

[(b)  Grantees  must  be  able  to  provide  or  display
an  ability  to  provide  the  following  services  to  any
Oregon  resident  who  requests  it,  in  order  to  receive
funding  as  an  Addiction  Recovery  Center:]

[(i) 24/7 triage: Centers shall assess a client’s need
for  immediate  medical  or other treatment shortly upon
the  client’s  arrival  to  determine  what  acute  care  is
needed  and  where  it  can  be  best  provided.  Centers
shall  provide  this  service  twenty-four  hours  a  day,
seven  days  a  week,  365  days  a  year.]

[(ii)  Health  assessment:  Centers  shall  conduct  a
comprehensive  behavioral  health  needs  assessment  for
each  client, 
including  a  substance  use  disorder
screening  by  a  certified  alcohol  and  drug  counselor
or  other  credentialed  addiction  treatment  professional.
The  assessment  shall  prioritize  the  self-identified
needs  of  the  client.]

[(iii)  Individual  intervention  plan,  intensive  case
management  and  connection  to  services:  If,  after  the
completion  of  the  assessment,  the  client  indicates  a
desire  to  address  some  or  all  of  the  identified  needs,
a  case  manager  shall  work  with  the  client  to  design
an  individual  intervention  plan.  The  plan  must  ad-
dress  the  client’s  need  for  substance  use  disorder
treatment,  coexisting  health  problems,  housing,  em-
ployment  and  training,  childcare  and  other  services.
Intensive  case  management  requires,  in  the  least,  that
case  managers  have  a  sufficiently  low  staff-to-client
ratio  to  provide  daily  support  as  needed  to  connect
clients  to  services  and  care  needed  to  fulfill  the  indi-
vidual  intervention  plan  and  have  the  capacity  to
follow-up  to  ensure  clients  are  accessing  care  and,  if
not,  to  reconnect  clients  to  care  as  necessary  and  as
desired  by  clients.]

[(iv)  Peer  support:  Each  center  shall  offer  ongoing
peer  counseling  and  support  from  triage  and  assess-
ment  through  implementation  of  individual  inter-
vention  plans  as  well  as  provide  peer  outreach
workers  to  engage  directly  with  marginalized  commu-
nity  members  who  could  potentially  benefit  from  the
center’s services.]

[(v)  Outreach:  Each  center  shall  assess  the  need
for,  and  provide,  mobile  or  virtual  outreach  services
to  reach  clients  who  are  unable  to  access  the  center.]
[(A)  Notwithstanding  subsection  (2)(a)  of  this  sec-
tion,  only  one  center  within  each  coordinated  care  or-

1

Chap.  591

OREGON  LAWS  2021

ganization  service  area  is  required  to  provide  the
triage  assessments  set  forth  in  subsection  (2)(b)(i)  of
this section.]

[(c)  All  services  provided  at  the  centers  must  be
evidence-informed, 
trauma-informed,  culturally  re-
sponsive,  patient-centered,  non-judgmental,  and  cen-
tered  on  principles  of  harm  reduction.  The  goal  of  the
individual  intervention  plan  and  intensive  case  man-
agement  shall  be  to  address  effectively  the  client’s
substance  use  disorder  and  any  other  factors  driving
problematic  behaviors  without  employing  coercion  or
shame  or  mandating  abstinence.]

[(d)  The  centers  shall  be  adequately  staffed  to  ad-
dress  the  needs  of  people  with  substance  use  disorder
within  their  regions  as  determined  by  the  Oversight
and  Accountability  Council,  but  must  include,  at  a
minimum,  at  least  one  person  qualified  in  each  of  the
following  categories:]

[Certified  alcohol  and  drug  counselor  or  other

credentialed  addiction  treatment  professional;]

[Intensive  case  manager;  and,]
[(C)  Peer  support  specialist.]
[(e)  Each  center  shall  provide  timely  verification
on  behalf  of  any  client  who  has  completed  a  health
assessment,  as  set  forth  in  subsection  (2)(b)(ii)  of  this
section,  if  the  client  requests  such  verification  to  com-
ply  with  section  22  or  section  23  (2)  of  this  Act.]

[(3)  Increasing  Community  Access  to  Care.  The
Oversight  and  Accountability  Council  shall  provide
grants  to  existing  agencies  or  organizations,  whether
government  or  community  based,  to  increase  access  to
one  or  more  of  the  following:]

[(a)  Low  barrier  substance  use  disorder  treatment
that  is  evidence-informed,  trauma-informed,  culturally
responsive,  patient-centered,  and  non-judgmental;]
[(b)  Peer  support  and  recovery  services;]
[(c)  Transitional,  supportive,  and  permanent

housing  for  persons  with  substance  use  disorder;]

[(d)  Harm  reduction  interventions  including,  but
not  limited  to,  overdose  prevention  education,  access
to  naloxone  hydrochloride  and  sterile  syringes,  and
stimulant-specific  drug  education  and  outreach.]

[(4)  The  council  shall  prioritize  providing  grants
to  community-based  nonprofit  organizations  within
each  coordinated  care  organization  service  area.
However, 
if  within  any  such  service  area  a
community-based  nonprofit  organization  does  not  ap-
ply  for  a  grant  or  grants  are  not  sought  within  that
service  area  for  which  services  are  needed,  then  the
council  may  request  and  fund  grants  to  any  commu-
nity  care  organization  or  county  within  that  service
area.]

[(5)  Services  provided  by  grantees,  including  ser-
vices  provided  by  Addiction  Recovery  Centers,  shall
be  free  of  charge  to  the  persons  receiving  the  services.
To  the  extent  consistent  with  applicable  law,  grantees
and  service  providers  may  seek  and  obtain  re-
imbursement  for  services  provided  to  any  person  from
any  insurer  or  entity  providing  insurance  to  that  per-
son.]

(1) The Oversight and Accountability Council
shall  oversee  and  approve  grants  and funding to
implement  Behavioral  Health  Resource  Net-

works  and  increase  access  to  community  care,
as  set  forth  below.  A  Behavioral  Health  Re-
source  Network  is  an  entity  or  collection  of  en-
tities  that  individually  or  jointly  provide  some

(2)(d)  of  this  section.

(2)(a)  The  Oversight  and  Accountability
Council,  in  consultation  with  the  Oregon  Health
Authority,  shall  provide  grants  and  funding  to
agencies  or  organizations,  whether  government

Health  Resource  Networks  for  the  purposes  of
immediately  screening  the  acute  needs  of  people
who use drugs and assessing and addressing any
ongoing  needs  through  ongoing  case  manage-
ment,  harm  reduction,  treatment,  housing  and
linkage  to  other  care  and  services. Recipients

A  recipient  of  a  grant  or  funding  under  this
subsection  may  not  use  the  grant  or  funding  to
supplant  the  recipient’s  existing  funding.

(b)  The  council  and  the  authority  shall  en-
sure  that  residents  of  each  county  have  access
to  all  of  the  services  described  in  paragraph  (d)

(c)  Applicants  for  grants  and  funding  may
apply  individually  or  jointly  with  other  network

provide  the  following  services  and  any  other
services  specified  by  the  council  by  rule:

support  or  wellness specialists or other qualified
persons  designated  by  the  council  to  determine
a  client’s  need  for  immediate  medical  or  other

needed  and  where  it  can  be  best  provided,  iden-
tify  other  needs  and  link  the  client  to  other  ap-
propriate  local  or  statewide  services,  including
treatment  for  substance  abuse  and  coexisting
health  problems,  housing,  employment,  training
and  child  care.  Networks  shall  provide  this  ser-
vice  24  hours  a  day,  seven  days  a  week,  every
calendar  day  of  the  year.  Notwithstanding  para-

provide  the  screenings  described  in  this  subpar-
agraph.

cates  a  desire  to  address  some  or  all  of  the
identified needs, a case manager shall work with
the  client  to  design  an  individual  intervention

violation,  or  fails  to  appear  at  any  other  subsequent

other  than  a  Class  E  violation,  the  court  may  is-
sue  an  order  that  requires  the  defendant  to  appear
and  show  cause  why  the  defendant  should  not  be
held  in  contempt.  The  show  cause  order  may  be
mailed  to  the  defendant  by  certified  mail,  return  re-
ceipt  requested.  If  service  cannot  be  accomplished

tion  21,  chapter  2,  Oregon  Laws  2021  (Ballot  Meas-

(a)  “License”  includes  a  registration,  certifica-

342.175  (3),  a  licensing  board,  commission  or  agency
may  not  deny,  suspend  or  revoke  an  occupational  or
professional  license  solely  for  the  reason  that  the
applicant  or  licensee  has  been  convicted  of  a  crime,
but  it  may  consider  the  relationship  of  the  facts
which  support  the  conviction  and  all  intervening
circumstances  to  the  specific  occupational  or  profes-
sional  standards  in  determining  the  fitness  of  the
person  to  receive  or  hold  the  license.  There  is  a
rebuttable  presumption  as  to  each  individual  appli-
cant  or  licensee  that  an  existing  or  prior  conviction
for  conduct  that  has  been  classified  or  reclassified
as  a  Class  E  violation  [pursuant  to  section  11  to  sec-
tion  19]  does  not  make  an  applicant  for  an  occupa-
tional  or  professional  license  or  a  licensee  with  an
occupational  or  professional  license  unfit  to  receive
or  hold  the  license.

(3)  Except  as  provided  in  ORS  342.143  (3)  and
342.175  (3),  a  licensing  board,  commission  or  agency
may  deny  an  occupational  or  professional  license  or
impose  discipline  on  a  licensee  based  on  conduct
that  is  not  undertaken  directly  in  the  course  of  the
licensed  activity,  but  that  is  substantially  related  to
the  fitness  and  ability  of  the  applicant  or  licensee  to
engage  in  the  activity  for  which  the  license  is  re-
quired.  In  determining  whether  the  conduct  is  sub-
stantially  related  to  the  fitness  and  ability  of  the
applicant  or  licensee  to  engage  in  the  activity  for
which  the  license  is  required,  the  licensing  board,
commission  or  agency  shall consider the relationship
of  the  facts  with  respect  to  the  conduct  and  all  in-
tervening  circumstances  to  the  specific  occupational
or  professional  standards.  There  is  a  rebuttable
presumption  as  to  each  individual  applicant  or  li-
censee  that  an  existing  or  prior  conviction  for  con-
duct  that  has  been  classified  or  reclassified  as  a
Class  E  violation  [pursuant  to  section  11  to  section
19]  is  not  related  to  the  fitness  and  ability  of  the
applicant  or  licensee  to  engage  in  the  activity  for
which  the  license  is  required.

SECTION  18. Section  19  of  this  2021  Act  is

added  to  and  made  a  part  of  ORS  chapter  153.

SECTION  19. (1)  An  enforcement  officer  is-
suing  a  citation  for  a  Class  E  violation  shall

complete  a  screening,  as  specified  in  section  2
(2)(d)(A),  chapter  2,  Oregon  Laws  2021  (Ballot
Measure  110  (2020)).

(1)  of  this  section  may  be  satisfied  by  providing
the  person  with  the  number  for  the  telephone
hotline  established  under  section  23,  chapter  2,
Oregon  Laws  2021  (Ballot  Measure  110  (2020)).

SECTION  20.  Section  22,  chapter  2,  Oregon
Laws  2021  (Ballot  Measure  110  (2020)),  is  amended
to read:

penalty  set  forth  in  ORS  153.018  (2)(e),  the  fine  shall

Measure  110  (2020)),  or  any  other  equivalent  or
more  intensive  treatment  contact,  within  45
days of when the person receives the citation for
the  Class  E  violation.

(2020)),  or  any  other  equivalent  or  more  inten-
sive  treatment  contact,  within  the  time  period
described  in  subsection  (1)  of  this  section,  the
court  shall  dismiss  the  citation.

(3)  The  failure  to  pay  a  fine  on  a  Class  E  vi-
olation  is not a basis for further penalties or for
a  term  of  incarceration.

JUVENILE COURTS

MUNICIPAL  AND  JUSTICE  COURTS

SECTION  25.  ORS 419C.370 is amended to read:
419C.370.  (1)  The  juvenile  court  may  enter  an

order  directing  that  all  cases  involving:

(a)  Violation  of  a  law  or  ordinance  relating  to
the  use  or  operation  of a motor vehicle, boating laws
or  game  laws  be  waived  to  criminal  or  municipal
court;

(b)  An  offense  classified  as  a  violation other
than  a  Class  E  violation  under  the  laws  of  this
state  or  a  political  subdivision  of  this  state  be
waived  to  municipal  court  if  the  municipal court has
agreed  to  accept  jurisdiction;  and

(c) A misdemeanor that entails theft, destruction,
tampering  with  or  vandalism  of  property  be  waived
to  municipal  court  if  the  municipal  court  has  agreed
to  accept  jurisdiction.

(2)  Cases  waived  under  subsection  (1)  of  this

section  are  subject  to  the  following:

(a)  That  the  criminal  or  municipal  court  prior  to
hearing  a  case,  other  than  a  case  involving  a  park-
ing  violation,  in  which  the  defendant  is  or  appears
to  be  under  18  years  of  age  notify  the  juvenile  court
of  that  fact;  and

(b)  That  the  juvenile  court  may  direct  that  any
such  case  be  waived  to  the  juvenile court for further
proceedings.

(3)(a)  When  a  person  who  has  been  waived under
subsection  (1)(c)  of  this  section  is  convicted  of  a
property  offense,  the  municipal  court  may  impose
any  sanction  authorized  for  the  offense  except  for
incarceration.  The  municipal  court  shall  notify  the
juvenile  court  of  the  disposition  of  the  case.

(b)  When  a  person  has  been  waived  under  sub-
section  (1)  of  this  section  and  fails  to  appear  as

to  have  violated  a  condition  of  the  probation,  the
juvenile  court  may  recall  the  case  to  the  juvenile
court  for  further  proceedings.  When  a  person  has
been  returned  to  juvenile  court  under  this  para-
graph,  the  juvenile  court  may  proceed  as  though  the

ceed  in  accordance  with  section  22,  chapter  2,
Oregon  Laws  2021  (Ballot  Measure  110  (2020)).

(2)  Nothing  in  subsection  (1)  of  this  section

court  is  located.  The  election  shall  be  made  within

related  misdemeanor  as  defined  in  ORS  423.478. A
justice  court  does  not  have  jurisdiction  over
Class  E  violations.  Except  as  provided  in  ORS
51.037,  a  justice  court  does  not  have  jurisdiction
over  offenses  created  by  the  charter  or  ordinance  of
any  city.

SECTION  29.  ORS  221.339  is  amended  to  read:

(5)  Subject  to  the  powers  and  duties  of  the  At-
torney  General  under  ORS  180.060,  the  city  attorney
has  authority  to  prosecute  a  violation  of  any  offense
created  by  statute  that  is  subject  to  the  jurisdiction
of  a  municipal  court,  including  any  appeal,  if  the  of-
fense  is  committed  or  triable  in  the  city.  The  prose-
cution  shall  be  in  the  name  of  the  state.  The  city

CONFORMING  AMENDMENTS

SECTION  43.  ORS  161.570  is  amended  to  read:
161.570.  (1)  As  used  in  this  section,  “nonperson

made  by  the  district  attorney  orally  or  in  writing  at
the  time  of  the  first  appearance  of  the  defendant.  If

(2)(c)  or  475.874  [(2)(b)]  (2)(c),  the  district  attorney
and  the  defendant  agree  to  treat  the  charged  offense
as  a  Class  A  misdemeanor,  the  court  may  allow  the
offense  to  be  treated  as  a  Class  A  misdemeanor  by
stipulation  of  the  parties.

(4)  If  a  Class  C  felony  or  a  violation  of  ORS
475.752  (7)(b),  475.854  [(2)(b)]  (2)(c)  or  475.874
[(2)(b)]  (2)(c)  is  treated  as  a  Class  A  misdemeanor
under  this  section,  the  court  shall  clearly  denomi-
nate  the  offense  as  a  Class  A  misdemeanor  in  any
judgment  entered  in  the  matter.

(5)  If  no  election  or  stipulation  is  made  under

this  section,  the  case  proceeds  as  a  felony.

tion  under  subsection  (2)  of  this  section,  the  district

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
