      <pre>On March 8, 2020, Governor Kate Brown issued Executive Order 20-03, which declared 
a state of emergency because of the threat that the COVID-19 coronavirus posed to 
public health and safety (hereafter, “COVID-19 state of emergency”).  Related to that 
declaration, among other restrictions, the Governor imposed protective face covering 
and social distancing requirements on Oregonians, as well as facility capacity limits.  On 
November 25, 2020, the Governor announced a statewide health and safety framework, 
with four different county risk levels based on each county’s level of COVID-19 spread:  
Extreme Risk, High Risk, Moderate Risk, and Lower Risk. 

On June 25, 2021, Governor Brown issued Executive Order 21-15, which extended the 
COVID-19 state of emergency to December 31, 2021, but otherwise rescinded earlier 
Executive Orders that had imposed statewide restrictions relating to protective face 
coverings, social distancing, capacity limits, and the county risk level framework.  
Executive Order 21-15 becomes effective not later than June 30, 2021. 

Since March 16, 2020, I have issued many Chief Justice Orders (CJOs) restricting court 
operations and imposing other requirements relating to the COVID-19 state of 
emergency, including:

Superseding Amended CJO 20-006 (later superseded);

Requirements in Certain Tax Appeals; 

CJO 20-028 (July 21, 2020), Directing or Permitting Appearances at Arraignment 
by Remote Means (later superseded);

Coverings in the Oregon State Courts;

CJO 21-009 (March 11, 2021), Imposing Updated Restrictions on Court 
Operations (including imposing some restrictions based on county risk levels; 
providing for remote arraignments; extending statutory time periods and time 
requirements in Forcible Entry and Detainer (FED) proceedings; providing that 
order in effect until the time when social distancing is no longer required and until 
further Chief Justice Order; and superseding CJO 20-016, CJO 20-028, and CJO 
20-047 (Amended)); and 

i. 

CJO 21-016 (May 25, 2021), Providing Exception to the Required Use of 
Protective Face Coverings in the Oregon State Courts. 

My goal in issuing those orders has been to meet our courts’ obligations to the public 
while also continuing to minimize health risks for judges, staff, litigants and case 
participants, interpreters, and members of the public who come into our courthouses and 
offices. 

I have based prior orders on one or more of the following grants of statutory authority: 

a. 

ORS 1.002 provides that: 

(1) 

The Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court is the administrative 
head of the judicial department of government in this state; shall exercise 
administrative authority and supervision over the courts of this state 
consistent with applicable provisions of law; and, to facilitate exercise of 
that administrative authority and supervision, may make rules and issue 
orders as appropriate or take any other action appropriate to perform the 
functions of the office of Chief Justice; and 

(2) 

The Chief Justice may delegate the exercise of any powers specified in 
ORS 1.002 to the Presiding Judge of a court. 

ORS 1.171(4) provides that a Presiding Judge may delegate the exercise of any 
of the administrative powers of the Presiding Judge to another judge of the court 
or to the Trial Court Administrator for the judicial district. 

Section 6(1)(a) of Oregon Laws 2020, chapter 12, provides that, during a 
declared COVID-19 state of emergency and continuing for 60 days after the 
declaration or any extension is no longer in effect, and upon a finding of good 
cause, the Chief Justice may extend or suspend any time period or time 
requirement established by statute or rule that applies: 

(1) 

(2) 

In any case, action, or proceeding after its initiation in any circuit court or 
the Oregon Tax Court; or 

To the initiation of an appeal to the Magistrate Division of the Tax Court or 
an appeal from the Magistrate Division to the Regular Division.

d.

a. 

b. 

Section 6(4) of Oregon Laws 2020, chapter 12, provides that, during a declared 
COVID-19 state of emergency and continuing for 90 days after the declaration or 
any extension is no longer in effect, 

(1) 

(2) 

Notwithstanding any other statute or rule to the contrary, the Chief Justice 
may direct or permit any appearance before a court or magistrate to be by 
telephone, other two-way electronic communication device, or 
simultaneous electronic transmission; and 

If an appearance is set to occur as just described, a Presiding Judge 
instead may order that the appearance be in person if, upon the request 
of a party, the judge determines that there is a particular need for an in-
person hearing or that a party has a constitutional right to an in-person 
hearing. 

Section 6(5) of Oregon Laws 2020, chapter 12, provides that the Chief Justice 
may delegate the exercise of any powers described in subparagraphs 4.c. and 
4.d. of these findings to the Presiding Judge of a court. 

In Executive Order 21-15, Governor Brown stated that her most recent extension of the 
COVID-19 state of emergency was essential for continuing flexibility for statewide 
recovery, including as to statutes drafted to end once the state of emergency ends, such 
as those providing for extension of certain court deadlines.  Executive Order 21-15 
states that that continued flexibility during the recovery period will help Oregon manage 
the transition back to “normal order” in a manner that is smooth and less disruptive. 

For the reasons given by Governor Brown declaring and extending the COVID-19 state 
of emergency, I find that good cause, as that term is used in Oregon Laws, chapter 12, 
section 6(1)(a) and described in subparagraph 4.c. of these findings, exists to: 

Extend statutory time periods and time requirements in Forcible Entry and 
Detainer (FED) proceedings, as set out in paragraph 5 of this order; and 

Extend statutory time periods and time requirements in Driving Under the 
Influence (DUII) Diversions, as set out in paragraph 6 of this order. 

ORS 1.171(2) provides that, to facilitate exercise of administration and supervision over 
the circuit court of the district consistent with applicable provisions of law, the Presiding 
Judge may apportion and otherwise regulate the disposition of the judicial business of 
the circuit court of the judicial district, and make rules, issue orders, and take other 
appropriate action to that exercise; and ORS 1.171(3) provides that the Presiding Judge 
may assign actions and proceedings pending before a court to other judges of the 
judicial district for hearing and disposition. 

ORS 8.225 provides that a Trial Court Administrator for a judicial district has the duties, 
powers, and functions prescribed by law or by rules of the circuit courts in the district, 
and that the Trial Court Administrator may delegate the powers of the office to 
employees of the Trial Court Administrator.

“Administrative authority” means, as to any judge, the Presiding Judge; as to any 
staff, “administrative authority” has the meaning set out in Judicial Department 
Personnel Rule 2.01. 

“Court facility” means the courthouse or any alternative physical location being 
used by the court or the Office of the State Court Administrator, but not any part 
of a building or location that is not under the court’s control. 

“Fully vaccinated” means that at least 14 days have passed since a person 
received the full number of injections required by the specific COVID-19 vaccine 
maker. 

“In person” means that a court proceeding is being conducted in the court facility, 
including at least one in-person participant who is neither the judge nor court 
staff. 

“Participant” means any individual who is participating in a proceeding, other than 
the judge and staff, including lawyers, parties, witnesses, jurors, interpreters, and 
courtroom security personnel. 

“Presiding Judge” means the presiding judge of a judicial district or any person to 
whom that judge has delegated authority under this order.  For purposes of this 
order, as applicable and pursuant to other statutory authority, the Chief Justice of 
the Supreme Court, the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, and the Tax Court 
Judge have the same authority in their respective courts as that described for a 
Presiding Judge. 

“Proceeding” means a trial, hearing, or other court proceeding.  When this order 
grants authority to a judge presiding over a proceeding, that same authority 
extends to a mediator conducting an in-person mediation, a facilitator providing 
in-person facilitation services, or the Citizen Review Board conducting a review 
of cases involving children in foster care. 

“Protective face covering” means a covering of the nose and mouth to protect 
against spreading the COVID-19 virus, as recommended or described as a 
means of protection by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
and the Oregon Health Authority (OHA). 

“Remote means” means the use of telephone, video, other two-way electronic 
communication device, or simultaneous electronic transmission. 

“Social distancing” means an identified minimum amount of physical distance 
between each person, such as three feet or six feet.

covering to ensure that a particular communication is understood. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

(5) 

The court will provide protective face coverings and information about 
how to use them.

Notwithstanding ORS 131.045(2) and (3), ORS 135.030(3), and 
ORS 135.360(3), any category of arraignment may be conducted 
remotely, without agreement of the parties. 

Notwithstanding any other statute or rule requiring that a person 
“personally appear,” “appear personally,” “appear in person,” make a 
“personal appearance,” or be “present in court,” the proceeding may be 
conducted remotely, and any appearance may be made by remote 
means. 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this order, if the constitution 
requires an in-person appearance or proceeding, then the appearance or 
proceeding must be conducted in person.  If a party contends that a

of the party’s rights, then the party may file a motion seeking an order that 
the appearance or proceeding be conducted in person.  This 
subparagraph applies to any crime victim who contends that an order 
results in a violation of the victim’s constitutional rights. 

Each Presiding Judge shall have authority to suspend any Supplementary 
Local Rule that may be an impediment to conducting proceedings by 
remote means, including any requirement that an ex parte submission be 
made in person. 

4)

to be conducted remotely, any exhibit that can be converted to PDF may be 
submitted through the court’s electronic filing (eFiling) system. 

When submitting exhibits through the eFiling system, the filer shall designate the 
exhibits as described in UTCR 21.070(6). 

The submission of exhibits through the eFiling system must comply with 
UTCR 21.040(1), (2), and current (4) (to be renumbered to (3) effective August 1, 
2021) to the extent applicable, except that the court may direct that multiple 
exhibits in a particular proceeding be submitted as separate eFiled documents. 

Be accompanied by an index that identifies each exhibit, located at the 
beginning of the submission, and each identified exhibit must be 
electronically linked to the index; and 

Include an electronic bookmark for each exhibit. 

(1) 

2) 

  (

The court may reject submissions that do not comply with this paragraph. 

A Presiding Judge shall determine how nondocumentary exhibits, such as audio 
or video exhibits, are to be submitted for a proceeding.

March 8, 2020, is eligible for diversion during the COVID-19 state of 
emergency, provided that the defendant is otherwise eligible under 
ORS 813.215.  The COVID-19 state of emergency constitutes existence 
of good cause for extension of the period of eligibility, and a defendant 
need not file a motion for extension of the period of eligibility. 

(2) 

On or after September 7, 2021, the time for a defendant to file a petition 
for a DUII diversion agreement shall be governed by ORS 813.210(1).

agreement may apply for an order extending the diversion period by filing 
an application for diversion at any time prior to the end of the diversion 
period.  The Presiding Judge also may consider an application filed after 
the end of the diversion period for good cause. 

(2) 

On or after September 7, 2021, the time for a defendant who has 
executed a DUII diversion agreement to apply for an order extending the 
diversion period shall be governed by ORS 813.225(1). 

c. 

Extension of diversion period 

Notwithstanding ORS 813.225(5), the Presiding Judge may extend the diversion 
period as necessary to allow the defendant sufficient time to complete the

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
