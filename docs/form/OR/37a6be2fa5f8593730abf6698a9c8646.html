FOREWORD

On October

20, 1974, a group of experts

in interpreting

for deaf

people

and in law met for a two-week workshop

at Meadow

Brook Hall, Rochester,

Michigan,

to develop

a manual

to be used in training

legal interpreters

for

deaf people.

The participants

in the workshop

represented

(1) the National

Registry

of Interpreters

for the Deaf;

(2) linguists;

(3) deaf consumers

of interpreting

services;

(4) Spanish-speaking and black minority groups;

.

(5) the judiciary; and

(6) the Center

for the Administration

of Justice.

Working

from a list of approximately

1,000 commonly

used legal terms

and their definitions,

the participants

developed

means to convey

the concepts

(

inherent

in the legal terms through signs or combinations

of signs.

The expec-

tation is that the agreed upon signs not only will prove a standard

means of

communicating

legal concepts

to deaf people

involved

in legal procedures,

but

that this Manual will also provide

a training and reference

aid for interpret-

ers, judges,

attorneys

and law enforcement

officials,

and serve as a text on

legal procedures

and terminology

for use in educating

deaf youngsters

in schools

for deaf students.

Two three-week

pilot courses were conducted

at Wayne State University

in May and June,

1975, for those interpreters

with the National

Registry

of

Interpreters

for the Deaf

Comprehensive

Skills Certificate

(CSC).

Input from

the class participants

and further research

and refinement

has resulted

in the

updating

of this Manual

as it is now published.

iv

---

-

!~

The courses in which this Manual

is to be used are for those who

(

hold the R.I.D. Comprehensive

Skills Certificate.

Persons so qualified

are

already familiar with the standard language of signs; accordingly, no attempt

has been made herein to illustrate the signs to be used. Only when it is

felt important

that a specific variant

of a given sign be used in preference

to another variant

of the same sign, is the description

of the sign given.

Therefore,

as an illustration,

the reader will find that the sign for "court"

is not described, it being assumed that all interpreters are familiar with it.

In contrast,

the word "appear," which has several variants

depending

upon cont:ext,

is described
"

so that each variant

is found in context with its meaning:

~,

.you will appear in court on such and so a day.

" is described

by the

sign "face to face," while ". . .the plaintiff did not appear so the case was

dismissed.

" is described

with the "pop up" sign for "appear."

The fact is also important

that the more graphic signs for sexual

activities,

especially

in the case of a deaf person with minimal

language

skill&,

may be needed

to convey the exact meaning of such terms as "carnal knowledge,"

"rape," "fornication,"

"sodomy,"

and the like, if the deaf person

is to have a

fair chance of presenting

his case in the event sexual behavior

is involved

in

his appearance

in court.

It was also the concensus

of the workshop

partici-

pants that not all interpreters

will be familiar with such signs, and that this

presents

an area to be explored.

Wherever

possible,

the existing

language

of signs has been employed

to illustrate

the concepts

through suitable

signs or combination

of signs.

Therefore, NO attempt has been made to develop "new" signs for

any

of

the

legal

v

-~-

terms because

it would not be feasible.

Finally,

this Manual has been developed

primarily

with a deaf person

with minimal

language

skills in mind, for that type of deaf person

usually chal-

lenges most strongly

an interpreter's

skills in conveying

concepts.

In contrast,

a language-competent

deaf person usually poses no problem

for an interpreter.

Indeed, many of the terms can be fingerspelled

for a language-competent

deaf

person.

Nevertheless,

even a well-educated

deaf person

may not understand

what is meant by the ~erm "mens rea," for example.

Consequently,

this Man~~~,

with its lay definitions

of legal terms, may help interpreters

not only to

understand

the terms themselves,

but also to be able to convey

them to deaf

persons,

whatever

their language proficiency.

INTRODUCTION

Interpreting

for deaf people in a legal situation

is probably

the

most challenging

task interpreters

for deaf people

can face.

Upon their ski~ls

rests the ability of deaf people

to obtain justice

equal to that afforded

their

hearing

peers.

Justice

flows to a deaf person only when he fully understands

what is transpiring

around him, even though he cannot hear what is being said.

Grave miscarriages

of justice

are not only possible,

but have happened

in the

past when deaf persons

have appeared

in court either without

an interpreter,

~r

with an interpreter

whose skills were inadequate

for the task.

The problem

is compounded

by the well-documented

language

deficien-

cies of the great majority

of deaf people who appear

in a court of law.

As

c-

noted in the Foreword,

language-competent

deaf people do not often appear in

court; when they do, they usually pose no major problem

for an interpreter.

It is the deaf person with minimal

language

skills who, lacking

a clear under-

standing

of the law, mos~ frequently

runs afoul of the law and ends up in court.

Quite frequently,

his troubles

begin long before he enters

the courtroom.

To illustrate,

consider

the case of a deaf man stopped

by a traffic

policeman

for driving with expired

license plates.

It is night,

and the officer

trains his flashlight

on the deaf man's face--thus

making

it impossible

for the

deaf man to see the officer's

lips and perhaps

to understand

what the officer

is saying.

However,

recognizing

him as an officer,

the deaf man reaches

for

his wallet

containing

his driver's

license.

Instantly,

the officer's

gun is

trained on him--for

the officer

had not yet asked to see his license

(although

--

1

the deaf man does not know this).

When he sees the gun, the deaf person in-

stantly

raises his hands, trying desperately

to show the officer

that he is

deaf by pointing

to his ears and shaking his head.

Despite

this, he is pulled

from his car and frisked.

Meanwhile,

the officer's

partner

examines

the car

and finds that there is no key in the ignition;

the car has been operated

by

jumping

the ignition wires.

That makes it a more serious offense

than merely

driving with expired license plates.

The officer

radios the car's description

to the dispatcher.

It turns out to have been stolen several months previously,

and the deaf man is in trouble.

He is taken into custody.

.

The Miranda warnings,

if anyone

thinks to read them to the deaf man,

of course make no sense at all to the deaf defendant,

who can only nod his head

in a confused

attempt

to be agreeable,

not understanding

that he has "agreed"

(

to submit to questioning

without

an attorney

present.

It is possible

that one

of his jailers

is an officer who fancies himself

an expert

in "talking with his

hands." This officer questions

the defendant,

using pantomime

and shouting,

and obtains

(he thinks) answers

to the questions

he has asked.

Carrying

the illustration

to the next phase,

during

the booking pro-

cess the arrested

person is allowed a phone call.

But there are no provisions

under our law for a person who physically

cannot make a phone call to gain out-

side communication.

A deaf arrestee,

without

benefit

of an interpreter

or a

TTY at both ends of the system, cannot avail himself

of the use of the tele-

phone.

Nor is it fair to ask the person who is arresting

or incarcerating

him to communicate

over the telephone

with the person he is attempting

to call.

If he does, the written

method

he must use to request

information

to be com-

---

2

municated over the phone may incriminate the deaf arrestee.

The next day, somebody

perhaps remembers

that a new law has been

passed requiring

an interpreter

to be provided

for any deaf person appearing

in court.

Since the deaf defendant

is to be arraigned

later in the day, a

call goes out for an interpreter.

The only one available

at the time is not

experienced

in communicating

with deaf persons with minimal

language

skills,

and acknowledges

the fact.

Therefore,

he asks a language-competent

deaf per-

son to corne along to act as an intermediary

interpreter

(one who can communi-

.

cate with language-deficient

deaf persons),

and relay the questions

and answers

between

the hearing

interpreter

and the deaf defendant.

Thus, the two interpreters

go to the courthouse,

and after many ex-

c-

planations

and frustrations

are permitted

into the cell block where the deaf

defendant

is being held.

There,

they encounter

the self-styled

interpreter-

officer who tells them he does not need their help, that he can talk with his

hands, and that he has obtained

all the information

anyone needs

from the de-

fendant.

He recommends

that the two interpreters

wait in court for the defend-

ant to be brought

in for his arraignment.

In exasperation,

the deaf interpreter

signs to the hearing

interpreter

some rude remarks about the officer,

to test

the latter's

ability

to understand

sign language.

Naturally,

the hearing

inter-

preter does not interpret

the deaf interpreter's

remarks.

Since there is no

explosion

from the officer,

both conclude

that he does not understand

sign 1an-

guage despite

his claims.

It is only when the deaf defendant

is brought

into court for arraign-

-~--

--

- - -

----

ment and the two interpreters

meet him for the first time that he has an

opportunity

to tell his side of the story.

He recounts

that a hearing

acquaintance

offered

to sell him a late model sedan for $25.00.

Not being

educated

e~ough to be wary of such a bargain,

he bought

the car despite the

fact that his friend had "lost" the keys, and did not have the car's regis-

tration papers with him.

He states that his friend promised

him he would

send the papers to him in a few days.

He never did, so the deaf defendant

had driven the car from his home town to the city in which he was arrested,

in an effort to locate his friend and obtain the registration

papers so he

.

could get new license plates.

Naturally,

for purposes

of this account

it is immaterial

whether

or not the deaf defendant

had been telling the truth, whether

he had indeed

c

been defrauded

into buying a stolen car, or was lying in an effort to escape

the consequences

of his own act of car theft.

The point is that he had been

effectively

deprived

of his rights long before he first appeared

in court.

Even in court, with a competent

interpreter

present,

there is no

guarantee

that a deaf person will receive a fair hearing

unless

the judge and

attorneys

are aware of the unique communication

problems

which a deaf person

with minimal

language

skills poses.

If the judge insists on a verbatim

trans-

lation of what is said in court, in ignorance

of the facts that a deaf witness

does not understand

standard

English,

let alone legal terminology,

and couches

his replies

in idiomatic,

non-grammatical

sign language,

then a gross miscar-

riage of justice

not only is possible

but probable.

By the same token, if an

opposing

attorney

seizes upon a nodding

or shaking

of the witness's

head as

4

- ---

meaning

a "yes" or a,"no" answer to a question,

when it is meant only to convey

understanding

or lack of understanding

of what the question

means,

then once

more grave misunderstandings

will occur.

In truth, however,

the interpreter's

basic responsibility

is to con-

vey as exactly

as'possible

the words and ideas uttered by both the deaf and

hearing

participants

in a legally-significant

dialogue.

This requires

use of

the signs which

the deaf person

in question

can readily understand,

without

altering

in any way the sense of the oral comments

being interpreted.

Funda- .

mentally, the use of American Sign Language is the key to successful inter-

preting.

However,

there are other sign language

systems now being developed

for educational

and specific

instructional

purposes,

which

include new signs

for technical,

scientific

or cultural

use.

From time to time, certain of

(

these so-called

"new" signs seem to catch on and become

integrated

into the

current manual

communication

system.

There is danger,

however,

in assuming

that these signs have been wholly

assimilated

by all deaf persons.

An inter-

preter must intuitively

assess the deaf persons he or she serves,

so that the

signed interpreting

corresponds

to the comprehension

level of the deaf person

in question.

The use of the manual

alphabet

should not be overlooked.

is very much a part of the American

Sign Language

System.

There will

always be times when the interpreter

must spell out specific words

for which

there are no signs.

This is especially

true of proper names.

However,

an

interpreter

must never forget

that there are times when the legal rights of a

deaf person may be in jeopardy

unless

the exact word is conveyed,

and that may

--~

~-

- ~-

--~-

5

~--

be done only by spelling

out the word in question.

Nevertheless, fingerspell-

ing must be used cautiously.

Otherwise,

there is great danger of misunder-

standing,

or worse, no comprehension

at all.

It is also imperative

that an

interpreter

keep uppermost

in his mind that some English words may not be famil-

iar to deaf clients.

Hence, even though they are spelled out clearly,

they

still may convey nothing.

This Manual,

therefore,

is designed

not only to educate

interpreters

about the exact meaning

of legal terms and how to interpret

them, but also to .

alert members

of the judiciary,

bar, and law enforcement

agencies

to the unique

problems

deaf individuals. face in legal situations,

and to acquaint

them with

the paraphrasing,

defining,

and explaining

required

of an interpreter

in order

to convey meaning

and concepts

to deaf persons with minimal

language

skills.

Since this Manual is intended

primarily

for the training

of inter-

preters

for deaf persons

in legal settings,

it sets forth some 900 of the more

commonly

used legal terms.

Words or phrases are alphabetically

listed, each

with its sign or signs description.

Each word or phrase entry is further anno-

tated with its legal meaning

in parenthesis

and an illustrative

sentence

to

assist

the reader in both understanding

and conveying

the meaning.

If there

are multiple

meanings,

separate

examples

are offered

for each.

The ability of

an interpreter

to convey the correct concept of a sentence

in ASL will confirm

the achievement

of the required

skill in communicating

with deaf persons of

average

or below-average

language

skill.

The terms employed

here to indicate

the different

levels or classes

(

6

~---

of court are those us~d in the Michigan

court system.

An examination

of the

chart given on page

8 will acquaint

the reader with the specific

type of

court in his own state.

Courts of limited jurisdiction

are designated

in

different

states by the terms municipal

court, justice

court, district

court,

county court, police court, or mayor's

court.

All, however,

snould be inter-

preted as "court," .preceded by the fingerspelled

or signed word representing

local usage.

To illustrate,

"municipal

court" would be signed "city court,"

while

"district

court" or "mayor's

court" would be conveyed

by fingerspelling

"district"

or "mayor's"

and then adding the sign for "court."

Courts of

.

general

jurisdiction,

however,

should be signed "higher

court" regardless

of

the term by which

the court is identified

in the particular

state.

By the

same token, the highest

court in a state should be signed

"highest

court,"

whatever it is actually called.

The United

States

Supreme Court shou~d be

(

distinguished

from state supreme courts

simply by prefacing

"highest

court"

with the fingerspelled "U.S.."

APPENDIX

LEGAL STATUS OF INTERPRETING

FOR THE DEAF

B. J. George, Jr.
Professor
Center

of Law and Director
for the Administration

of Justice

I.

Introduction

The law relating

to interpreters

is relatively

unformulated.

In

part this is because most of the precedent

(judicial decisions)

was laid down

Juring

a period in which the appointment

or recognition

of an interpreter

was

stated

to be in the discretion

of the trial court.

Appellate

courts will over-

turn discretionary acts by lower court judges only when discretion has been

c-

grossly

or gravely abused.

Hence, until recently,

there has been no basis for

higher courts to deal with the details of legal interpretation.

Today there is a greater

inclination

to consider

the constitutional

implications

of adequate

interpretation

in criminal

cases, so that one perhaps

should not attach undue weight

to older cases which. deny the applicability

of

constitutional

principles

to the matter of providing

competent

interpreting

services

for the deaf.

Moreover,

special statutes

increasingly

provide

for

many of the more important

aspects of interpretation,

which reduces

consider-

ably the need for litigation.

In what follows, we will consider

(1) the constitutional status of

the claim to interpretation,

(2) the coverage

of current

statutes,

(3) legal

3/76

231

aspects

of the process

of appointing

interpreters,

(4) legal standards

for

the performance

of interpreter

duties, and

(5) the matter of fees for inter-

pretation.

Although most of the users of this Manual are not interested in

researching

original

legal materials

and thus do not particularly

need legal

citations

to statutes

and decisions,

the latter are nonetheless

included

because

of the relative

dearth of published

research

in the field.

In many

instances,

the cited cases include situatjons

of translation

between verbal

languages,

and not interpretation

for the deaf.

This does not matter,

how-

ever, because

the legal rules apply interchangeably

to the two forms of inter-

pretation,

and the practical

problems

posed by both are essentially

the same.

II.

Constitutional Status of the Claim to Interpretation

A.

Criminal Cases

<,

The United

States Constitution

guarantees

to criminal

defendants

the

important

rights to a fair trial, confrontation

of witnesses,

and competent

counsel;

these rights are made binding

on the states through

the due process

clause

of the Fourteenth

Amendment.

In examining

the application

of these rights to a trial in which one

or more of the participants

are deaf, one might distinguish

(1) the deaf

Jefenuant

in the setting of a proceeding

in which other participants

can hear,

and (L) a hearing defendant in proceedings in which one or more of the witnesses

are deaf.

In the first setting,

the basic claim of the defendant

is that he or

she might as well be completely

away from the courtroom

if there is no means of

3/76

~---

232

communication.

As one court noted in the setting o( a trial in which the

defendant

knew only Spanish and the entire proceedings

were in English,

"most

of the trial must have been a babble of voices"

[Unite~ States ex reI. Negron

~ New York, 434 F.2d 386, 388 (2d Cir. 1970]; in the case of a deaf defend-

ant, proceedings

in which nothing

is interpreted

can be only a meaningless

pantomime.

Thus, to try one without

providing

qualified

interpretation

is to

deny fundamental

fairness

[cf. Terry ~ State, 21 Ala. App. 100, 105 So. 386

(1925); In re Muraviov, 192 Cal. App. 2d 604, 13 Cal. Rptr. 466 (1961)].

As perhaps a corollary

to the basic concern

for a fair trial, there

is the Sixth Amendment

right of a criminal

defendant

to confront

the witnesses

against him or her.

While at times the principal

thrust

of this right is to

bar trial in the defendant's

absence or to prevent

the invocation

of technical

(

rules of evidence

to exclude credible

evidence

favorable

to the defendant,

the

application

of the right of confrontation

principally

germane

to the provision

of competent

interpreting

services

for the deaf is the claim to effective

cross-examination

of prosecution

witnesses.

If the defendant

cannot hear or

understand

the testimony

of prosecution

witnesses,

he or she is in no position

to suggest to counsel possible

discrepancies

in those witnesses'

direct

testi-

mony.

There is precedent

for application

of the right of confrontation

to

- protect defendants who do not understand English [Stat~ ~- Vasque~, 101 Utah

444, 121 P.2d 903 (1942); Garcia ~

State, 151 Tex. Crim.

593, 210 S.H.2d 574

(1948)], and the same premise

should apply to protect

deaf defendants

as well.

A second corollary

to the fundamental

principle

that a criminal

trial

must be fair is the Sixth Amendment

right to representation

by cOtlnsel in any

J(J6

-~

.2\'

case in which

there is

any possibility of imprisonml~nt

[i\rgersinger

~ Hamlin,

407 U.S.

25 (1972)].

The

right

to

counsel

means

the

right

to

an

attorney

who

knows

enough

about

the

case

to

be

able

to

represent

the

defendant

effectively;

this

is

one

aspect

of

the

requirement

that

a defendant

be

provided

with

"constitutionally

competent

counsel."

If

the

defendant

is

not

provided

with

interpreting

services

for

the

purpose

ot

consultations

with

counsel

during

the

course

of

trial,

then

arguably

the

attorney

does

not

provide

the

required

level

of

representation.

Certainly,

in

the

setting

of mentally-ill

defendants

who are

placed

on trial,

the

inability

to communicate

with

counsel

is

an

important

element

in determining

whether

due

process

was

afforded

[Jackson

v.

Indiana,

406 u.s. 715 (1972)],

and

the

same considerationshould apply when

it is language (or deafness) and not me~tal

condition

which makes communication

between

counsel and client impossible [cf. United §ta~es ex rel. Negron ~ New

(

York, above

(Spanish-speaking

defendant);

Hothershead

v. ~ing,

112 F.2d 1004

(8th Cir. 1940) (deaf defendant)].

Should it matter that the attorney happens to

be conversantwith

Ameslan?

In the analogous

situation

of a defendant

whose

attorney

speaks

the

defendant's

language,

there has been a tendency

to rule that the defendant's

right to counsel has been adequately

safeguarded

[~nited States ~ Desist,

384

F2d 889 (2d Cir. 1967); Peo~

~

Pelegri, 39 Ill. 2d 568, 237 N.E.2d 453 (1968)],

since whether or not there has been a \vant

of

effective

communication

with

counsel

must be determined on the basis of

the

facts

in tte

particular

case. One might

ask how counsel

can perform

the expected

role of an attorney

and at the same time

provide interpreting services for the defendant, but the cases in wllich that

dilemma was presented as an impairment of the right

to effective counsel failed

3/76

~:l4

to find constitutional

error

[Gonzales ~ United States, 314 F.2d 750 (9th Cir.

1963); People ~

Pelegri,

39 Ill. 2d 568 N.E.2d

453 (1968)].

If the particular

hearing

involves

only questions

of law, so that no

factual

testimony

is to be taken, there is no requirement

that the defendant

be provided

with interpreting

services,

since the entire proceeding

on the

point can be conducted

in his absence without

impairing

his right of confron-

tation [cf. United States y~ faroutian, 299 F.2d 486 (2d Cir. 1962)].

If the defendant

has the means to obtain his or her own qualified

interpreter,

is the court under a duty to provide

interpreting

services

any-

way? On the analogy

to the right to counsel, which benefits

only indigent

persons, one decision holds that only a person without financial resources can

claim the appointment

of an interpreter

on constitutional

grounds

[United States

(

~ Desist, above].

To what extent has the United States Supreme Court spoken on these

matters?

The answer is, very little.

In one rather elderly

case [Felts v.

Mur~,

201 U.S. 123 (1906)], the Court found the issue not to have been proper-

ly presented

on habeas corpus when a deaf person had been tried without

inter-

pretation

services

(although

the tenor of the opinion

suggests

that the Court

thought

the failure to provide

interpreting

unwise).

In another decision

soon

afterwards

[Perovich ~ United States, 205 U.S. 86 (1907)],

there was felt to

be no abuse under the circumstances

of the case in refusing

to provide

a foreigr.

language

interpreter

for the defendant.

In the ~ost recent case [Mar~no ~ Rag~~.

332 U.S. 561 (1947)], the state admitted

that constitutional

error was committed

3/70

--

-- - - --

235

in accepting

a guilty plea from a young, recent immigrant

who did not know

English

and who was unrepresented

by counsel;

the arresting

officer provided

interpreting

services

It is not clear, however,

that the want of interpreta-

tion by an impartial

interpreter

was nearly as important

as the lack of counsel.

It seems probable,

nevertheless,

that the Court's

decision

in Jackson

v. Indiana,

above, applies by analogy

to an instance

in which a deaf defendant

is denied adequate

interpretation.

Jackson was in fact deaf and unable to com-

municate

with the court, but the principal

concern on the part of the Supreme

Court was with his mental condition,

which had brought

about open-ended

hospi-

talization

that served to suspend

indefinitely

trial on pending

criminal

charges.

Nevertheless,

the constitutional

basis for suspending

criminal

proceedings

under

(

circumstances

of mental

incompetence

is the inability

of a criminal

defendant

to

understand

the proceedings

and to communicate

adequately

with counsel.

(Jackson

then holds it improper

to keep a mentally-ill

person compulsorily

hospitalized

without

the usual procedures

required

for civil commitment

of mentally-ill

per-

sons generally,

and to suspend

criminal

proceedings

indefinitely

when the defen-

dant cannot promptly

be restored

to a triable condition.)

If a defendant

suffers

from similar disabilities because of inability to communicate, through deafness

or lack of knowledge

of English,

it seems difficult

to say that due process

of

law has not been denied him.

B.

Civil Cases

The constitutional

rights dealt with in (A) above do not apply to civil

cases. Consequently,

the traditional

viewpoint

is that there is no right to

claim the appointment

of an interpreter

in a civil case

(at least, one to which

3/76

236

a governmental

agency is not a party)

[Cochise ~ounty ~

Michele~a,

15 Ariz.

477, 140 P. 62 (1914)].

Naturally,

this means only that there is no ability

to insist that the court provide interpreting services at no cost to the

parties.

If a party provides

an interpreter,

the only issue for the court is

the qualifications

of the person offered for the purpose

(see below).

However,

the traditional

distinction

between

criminal

and civil cases

may nc longer be a reliable

one for determination

of the legitimacy

of a claim

to interpreting

services.

The Supreme Court has afforded

constitutional

proce-

dural rights

to several classes of persons who are not criminal

defendants

in

a technical

sense; examples

include respondents

in juvenile

delinquency

proceed-

ings [In re Gault,

387 U.S. 1 (1967)], revocation

of probation

and parole

(viewed as administrative

rather

than criminal)

[Gagnon ~ Scarpell~,

411

U.S.

(

778 (1973); Morrissey

~

Brewer, 408 U.S. 471 (1972)], and prison disciplinary

proceedings [Wolft ~ McDonnel~,

418 U.S. 539 (1974)].

Since procedural

rights

in each of these contexts

include information

about charges

and the presentation

of facts through witnesses,

it is probable

that the right

to adequate

interpreta-

tion will be recognized

as appropriate

cases arise to present

the issue.

C. Waiver

A number of the somewhat

older decisions

required

that a criminal

defendant

affirmatively

request

the appointment

of an interpreter,

else any

constitutional

protection

would be waived

[Gonzalez ~ Virgin

Islands,

109 F.2d

215 (3d Cir. 1940); P~o~

~

Soldat, 32 Ill. 2d 478, 145 N.E.2d 86 (1957);

Peo~

~

Ramos, 26 N.Y.2d 272, 258 N.E.2d 197, 309 N.Y.S.2d 906 (1970); Salas

v. State, 385 S.W.2d 859 (tex. Crim. App. 1965)].

If a defendant

is represented

3/76

237

by competent

counsel, who is aware of his or her linguistic

abilities

or aural

capacity,

and counsel does not request an interpreter,

there may be scope to

apply the doctrine

of these decisions.

However,

if the defendant

is unrepre-

sented by coun~el,

or has been unable

to communicate

with counsel,

or has no

knowledge

of the nature of the proceedings,

then it is unlikely

that a court

today will be inclined

to infer waiver

of the right to adequate

interpretation

from the failure

to make a positive

demand

for the services

of an interpreter

[cf. Marino ~ Ragen, above; United States ex reI. Negron ~ New York, above;

In ~ Muraviov,

above].

If a hearing-impaired

defendant

has the ability

through use of a

hearing

aid or whatever

to hear what transpires

in the courtroom,

but refuses

to equip himself,

he can be viewed

to have waived his claim to an interpreter

(

through his conduct [Peo~

~ Guillory,

178 Cal. App. 2d 854, 3 Cal. Rptr.

415 (1960)].

In Guillor~, the defendant refused to equip himself with batteries

for his hearing-aid.

III A Survey

of Statutory

Provisions

The following

material

is intended

to alert one to the nature of

state legislation

affecting

the appointment

of interpreters

for the deaf.

The

238

3/76

--

--- ~

complete

statutory

references

are found at the end of the Appendix.

A.

General Interpreter Statutes

A number of states continue

the practice

of making no special refer-

ence to tile interpreting

needs of the deaf.

Instead,

they provide only for

interpreting services in general [Federal, Ariz., Del., Ga., Hawaii, Idaho,

Miss., Mont., New., Ore. (for witness "who does not understand the English

language"), Vt., Wis. (statute relates only to compensation)].

It is then

the task. of the trial judge to determine

that interpreters

for the deaf are

included.

B.

Special

Statutes

Governing

Interpreters

for the Deaf

(

In recent years, many states have enacted special

statutes

provid-

ing for the needs of the deaf for adequate

interpreting

[Ala., Ark., Conn.,

Fla., Ill., Ind. (civil proceedings only), Iowa, Kan., La., Md. (civil pro-

ceedings only, Mass., Mich., Minn., Mo., Neb., N.J., N.M. (criminal prosecu-

tions) , N.Y., N.C., N.D., Ohio, Okla.

(criminal only), R.I., S.C., S.D.,

Tenn., Tex., Va. (criminal prosecutions)

Wash., W.Va.].

When the legislation

covers directly

only civil or criminal

cases, there may also be a residual

statute

covering

interpreters

in general on which a court might

rely.

A few of the newer statutes

specify

that a deaf person

in initial

police custody have interpreter services [Colo., Minn., Okla., S.D.]. In

the absence

of such a requirement,

whether

or not the services

of an inter-

preter

should be available

to an arrestee will probably

depend on whether

there is interrogation

to produce

a confession;

in that event, a functional

3/76

239

corollary

to the requirement

of effective

warnings

and a valid waiver of

rights [under Miranda ~ Arizona,

384 U.S. 436 (1966)] should be that the

deaf person be given an interpreter.

Several of the statutes

enacted

in recent years also specify

that deaf persons

involved

in administrative

proceedings

also be provided

with interpreters [Colo., Conn., Iowa, Kan., N.D., S.D., Wash., W.Va.].

This pattern

of legislation

is probably

necessary

to guarantee

representation

for deaf persons before administrative

agencies,

since it is doubtful

at the

present

time that courts by judicial

decision

will impose such a requirement

on administrative

bodies and officers.

(

C.

States Without

Statutes

In the handful

of jurisdictions

not found in either

(A) or (B) above,

counsel

for a deaf person will have to rely on the constitutional

doctrines

described

in Part II in a criminal

case or other form of proceeding

to which

due process procedural

guarantees

apply.

In the case of civil proceedings,

one

would need to appeal to the concept of an inherent

power in a court of general

trial jurisdiction

to take whatever

actions are necessary

to ensure

fair and

orderly

proceedings.

Such a concept clearly will allow the appearance

and

participation

by a qualified

interpreter

provided

by a party or witness,

but not

the appointment

of an interpreter

for an indigent

party or witness,

as the law

now appears

to stand.

IV.

Legal Aspects

of the Appointment

of Interpreters

A. Judicial

Discretion

3/76

240

--

Unless a constitutional provision specifically [~,

New Mexico's

constitution]

or by judicial

interpretation

requires

the appointment

of- an

interpreter,

the approval

of an interpreter

lies in the sound discretion

of

the trial court; there is abundant authority for that proposition [~,

Perovich

v. United States, above;

Suarez ~

United

State~,

309 F.2d 709 (5th

Cir. 1962); People.~

Lopez, 21 Cal. App. 188, 131 P. 104 (1913); Casciato ~

Rennick, 380 P.2d 122 (Wyo. 1963)].

r\

Matters

having to do with the appointment

and qualifications

of

interpreters

are strictly

within

the province

of the judge.

Consequently, it

is legal error for a trial court to leave to the jury the decision

as to whether

an interpreter is qualified [Kley ~ Abe~~, 483 S.W.2d 625 (Mo. App. 1972)].

(

Judicial discretion goes to three matters:

(1)

Legal availability

££ interpreter

services.

In the absence of

a constitutional

or statutory

provision

specifically

guaranteeing

the right to

an interpreter,

the trial court must determine

whether

an interpreter

should be

appointed

or supplied.

Even in a criminal

case, if the particular

phase of the

proceeding

involves only legal questions,

the cour~ has discretion

to refuse to

provide an interpreter at that time [United States v. Paroutian, above].

(2)

HearinK

capacity

££ the party or witness.

The foreign language

cases have firmly established

the premise

that the judge has discretion

to deter-

mine whether

the party or witness

indeed lacks English

language

competency

[Perovich ~ United States, above;

Suarez ~ United States,

above; Gonzalez

v.

Virgin Islands, above; Viliborghi v. Sta~~, 45 Ariz. 275, 43 P.2d 210 (1935);

3/76

241

People ~

Avila, 50 Cal~ App. 228, 194 P. 768 (1920); People ~

Soldat, 32 Ill.

2d 478, 145 N.E.2d 86 (1957); People v. Ramos, above;

Salas ~ State,

385

S.W.2d

859 (Tex. Crim. App. 1965); Tompkins ~

~~~~,

267 P.2d 753 (Wyo. 1954)].

A

similar

approach

is taken to the matter

of the hearing

ability

of party or witness

[~,

People ~

Guillory, above; Kelly ~ State, 96 Fla. 348, 118 So. 1 (1928);

Ral~ ~

Stat~, 124 Ga 81, 52 S.E. 298 (1905); Beall ~

~ear§,

106 Kan. 690, 189

P. 938 (1920)].

(3)

Qualifications

£i the interpreter.

Some of the recent statutes

indicate

the qualifications

of or the sources from which

qualified

interpreters

for the deaf are to be drawn

[Ala. (Alabama Association

of the Deaf); Mo. (Miss-

ouri School for the Deaf); N.J. (R.I.D.); Okla. (Oklahoma Association of the Deaf);

S.C. (R.I.D. or National Reistry of Interpreters for the Deaf); Va. (R.I.D.); W.Va.

(

(National

Registry

of Interpreters

for the Deaf or "otherwise

qualified")].

In the absence of such a statutory

requirement,

the court must find the

proffered interpreter to be qualified to conduct the needed translation [~,

Peo~

~

Mendes, 35 Cal. 2d 537, 219 P.2d 1 (1950); Reo ~

Vecchio, 340 Mich.2l6,

65 N.W.2d 773 (1954); Erba ~ Erba ~ros~,

77 R.I. 75, 73 A.2d 697 (1950)].

Although

an interpreter

is sworn like a witness,

he is not treated like a witness

as far as qualifications

are concerned.

In the case of an expert witness,

for

example,

if the counsel

calling

the expert establishes

that the latter has the

necessary

professional

qualifications,

then he is permitted

to testify.

If the

opposing

side believes

that the expert's

opinion

is open to doubt,

then it must

resort

to "impeachment"

(the technical

legal term) through cross-examination

of

the expert on the bases for the claimed scientific

conclusion,

or must use other

.

3/76

242

/'

(

experts to suggest a contrary significance to the data originally relied on.

In the instance

of an interpreter,

in contrast,

the court is under a duty to

find that the proffered

interpreter

is qualified,

since a botched

interpreta-

tion is not something

which can be brought

to light t~rough cross-examination

[St~~e ~

Spadoni,

137 Wash. 684, 243 P. 854 (1926)].

An objection

to the

interpreter's qualifications is required, however [Reo ~ Vecchio,

above].

Because of the nature of the -issue of interpreter

competency,

the

judge must determine

the matter with the jury excused

from the courtroom

[Kley

v. Abell, 483 S.W.2d 625 (Mo. App. 1972)].

What is the standard

by which the proficiency

of an interpreter

for

the deaf must be determined?

Because

statutes do not spell out the requisite

skills,

courts will have to establish

the standards

themselves.

One court has

stated

the requisite

qualifications

in this way [Kley ~ Abel),

above]:

.

.

. Upon proper objection the trial court must determine:

(a) if the witness

can communicate

at all, and if so, how

such communication

is accomplished

(by writing,

normal sign

language,

or personal means such as here),

(b) who can under-

stand the communication, (c) which method of communication

and interpretation is most likely to produce a fdir and honest

pres~ntation

of the witness's

testimony,

and (d) is the person

who understands

the \vitness best also the most qualified

to act

as an officer of the court. .

.

.{483 S.W.2dat

628-29]

3/76

243

There of course is no insistence

that everything

be reduced to

writing

for the benefit of a deaf defendant

or that questions

be written

for a deaf witness;

sign language

is proper

[Ralph ~

State, 124 Ga. 81,

52 S.E. 298 (1905); State ~ Howard, 118 Mo. 127, 24 S.W. 41 (1893)].

However,

the interpreter

must use an established

system

subject to external

monitoring L~~o~ ~ Walker,

69 Cal. App. 475, 231 P. 572 (1924)].

In

Walker,

the wife of a prosecution

witness

claimed to interpret

his bodily

responses,

although

the witness

could not speak and was observed

to make

no ascertainable

response

to the questions.

At a minimum,

the trial judge

would be under a duty to require

the purported

interpreter

to establish

under

oath what the claimed

system of communication

is.

(

There is no objection

to using two interpreters

if that is necessary

to permit communication between the deaf person and the court [Ska~

~ ~ta!~,

108 Ind. 53, 8 N.E. 695 (1886)].

Conversely,

there is no inherent

impropriety

in appointing

a single interpreter

to serve the needs of two or more defendants

in need of interpreting

assistance

[Chavira Gonzales

v. United

States,

314 F.2d

750 (9th Cir. 1963) (Spanish interpreter)].

The fact alone that an interpreter

is replaced

during

trial is not

proof that he or she is unqualified,

since there may be personal

reasons which

account

for the change

[Gallegos ~ Garcia,

14 ARiz. App. 85, 480 P.2d 1002

(1971)].

An interpreter

with the requisite

professional

qualifications

may

still be disqualified

if there are obvious

circumstances

which will bias the

3/7h

--~

244

interpreter

against

the defendant,

party or witness

[Prince Y..:..Beto, 426 F.2d

875 (5th Cir. 1970) (husband of deaf rape victim held excessively

biased;

he

had offered

to call off the prosecution

on payment of money)].

However,

it is

not relationship

alone which determines

bias; the fact that an interpreter

is

a police official

[State Y..:..Firmatura,

121 La. 676, 46 So. 691 (1903)] or a

collateral

relative

[Peo~

Y..:..~ardjn,

255 Ill. 9, 99 N.E. 59 (1912)], or has

interpreted

for the opposing

party on other occasions

[Hsu ~ Mt. Zion Hospital,

259 Cal. App. 2d 562, 66 Cal. Rptr. 659 (1968)] does not automatically require

disqualification.

Instead,

the objecting

party must show additional

factors

indicating

actual bias in the particular

case [State ~ Boulett,

5 Wash. 2d 654,

106 P.2d 311 (1940)].

An objection

of course is required,

so that an attack on

qualifications made only after trial will be ineffective [Sellers ~§tate,

61

Tex. Crim. 140, 134 S.W. 348 (1911)].

(

The South Dakota statute requires

that an interpreter

be acceptable

to the party or witness

for whom the interpreting

is to be done.

Although

one

can understand

the motivation

behind

the provision,

it makes little sense from

the practical

standpoint,

particularly

in light of the paucity

of qualified

interpreters.

If one presses

the logic of the statute,

a deaf defendant

could

delay proceedings

indefinitely

simply by refusing

every interpreter

offered

to

him. One may surmise

that under such circumstances

a trial court \vould probably

ignore the statute or else read into it a requirement

that the refusal be in

good faith or based on some valid explanation

for the rejection

of a qualified

interpreter.

3/76

245

B.

Oath

After an interpreter

has been qualified

to act, he or she must be

administered an oath [Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 604 (1975); Ark., Colo.,

Conn., Ga., Ind., Iowa, Kan., La., Miss., Minn., Mo., Nev., N.D., Ohio, Okla.,

R.I., S.D., Tex., Va., Vt., Wash., W.Va.].

This requirement

stems in part from

the tradition

that likens an interpreter

to a witness

or expert witness,

and

in part from the recognition

that an interpreter

occupies

a status akin to that

of an officer or employee

of the court.

Presumably,

any wilful

failure to per-

form the duties of interpreter

properly

could be dealt with as contempt

of court

[cf. the Florida

statute, which imposes misdemeanor

penalties

upon an interpreter

who wilfully

fails to perform assigned

duties].

V.

Legal Standards

for Interpretation

(

A.

Nature of Duties

The most usual indicator

of the duties which

an interpreter

is to

perform

is the content

of the oath administered

to the interpreter

by the

court. The Federal Rules of Evidence

require

the interpreter

to "make a

true translation"

[Rule 604], and the Georgia

statute

is similar.

The

Colorado

statute

is typical of the language

found in the oath provisions

in

several other states [Conn., Kan., Minn., Mo., Ohio, Okla., R.I., S.D., Tex.,

Wash.]

:

"Every

interpreter.

. . , before entering

upon his duties,

shall take

an oath that he will make a true interpretation

in an understandable

manner

to

the person

for whom he is appointed,

and that he will repeat

the statements

of

such person

in the English laqguage,

to the best of his skill and judgment."

3/76

246

B.

Practical Problems of Interpretation

A handful

of statues

(apparently

based on a model statute prepared

by one or more organizations

of or for the deaf) specify that the interpreter

must be "in a position

not exceeding

ten feet from and in full view of the

deaf person" [La.. R.1.. Tex.].

Even without

such a statute.

it would be

incumbent

on the trial judge to ensure

that the interpreter

is afforded what-

ever position

or conveniences

are necessary

to effective

communication.

An interpreter

must interpret

everything

which a witness

states under

uc.:th r.State ~ Deslovers. 40 R.I. 89.100 A. 64 (1917)]. without holding any-

I ;1ir:y,

bac.k.

It is then the trial court's responsibility

to rule whether

the

answer

is responsive

to counsel's

questioning.

legally relevant.

or whatever.

Correspondingly.

it is the trial judge's

duty to see that a qualified

inter-

(

preter

is provided

so that everything

the witness

says is indeed translated

into English [People ~ Shok. 12 Ill. 2d 93. 145 N.E. 2d 86 (1957)].

Within

these limitations.

however.

there is no legal problem

if the interpreter

uses

the third persbn form rather

than first person in translating

the witness'

testimony [People ~ Jackson.

53 Cal. 2d 89. 346 P.2d 389 (1959)] (a problem

perhaps

more observable

with foreign language

translation

than interpreting

for

the deaf).

The Georgia

statute

is unusual

in that it permits

an interpreter

to

"explain

his evidence."

Judges and legislators

ignorant

of foreign languages

or the conceptual

nature

of Ameslan will usually

insist on a "literal"

trans-

lation.

which of course

is impossible.

Until the nation's

trial bench can be

educated

about the nature of proper

interpretation,

an interpreter

should be

)/76

247

prepared

to indicate

to a trial judge the fundamental

character

of inter-

pretation

for the deaf, and will also bear a practical

burden of educating

the attorney

for a deaf defendant

or party, or counsel who calls a deaf

witness

to the stand.

VI.

Fees

An interpreter

has a claim to a fee for services

performed,

which

in some states may be enforceable

by civil suit [cf. Myers ~ County of Cook,

34 Ill. 2d 541, 216 N.E.2d 803 (1966)].

The matter

is dealt with by statute

in many states.

In some, the amount of the fee is fixed by the statute [~,

Ala.> (.onn.,La., Mich., MonL,

N.D., R.I., Tex., W.Va.].

Particularly

in a

time of inflation,

this is a poor legislative

technique.

In federal practice

and under

the statutes

of a substantial

number of states

[Ark., Colo., Del.,

c

Fla., Iowa, Ill., Md., Minn., Mo., Nev., N.J., N.Y., N.C., Ohio, Okla., S.D.,

Tenn., Tex., Vt., Va., Wah., Wis.], the amount payable in the particular case

is determined

by the trial court.

Presumably,

a clear abuse of discretion

in

that regard can be made the basis of either appeal

(in the instance

of an

interpreter

for the party),

or a special proceeding

by the interpreter.

Some of the statutes

also provide especially

for payment

of expenses

to the interpreter [Ala., La., Okla., Tex., Wash., W.Va.].

If there is no

direct provision

to that effect, one should check the general

statutes

or rules

applicable

to witness

travel;

since an interpreter

for many purposes

is dealt

with as a witness,

the provisions

governing

mileage

and other expense probably

apply to both.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
