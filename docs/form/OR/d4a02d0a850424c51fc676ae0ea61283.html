AFFIRMATIVE ACTION REPORT

A.

Purpose

B.

Policy

This Affirmative Action Report was developed to assure that the Oregon
Judicial Department (OJD) is providing equal employment opportunities.

OJD’s rule on Equal Employment Opportunity is set forth in the Judicial
Department Personnel Rules as follows:

Rule 5, Equal Employment Opportunity 

OJD provides equal employment opportunities to all 
employees and applicants for employment without 
unlawful regard to race, color, religion, national origin, 
sex, political affiliation, age, marital status, mental or 
physical disability, sexual orientation, genetic 
information, veteran status, or any other reason 
prohibited by law.  This applies to all aspects of 
employment, including but not limited to, recruitment, 
hiring, training, promotion, transfer, and administration 
of all personnel policies, procedures, practices, 
programs, and services. 

Administrative authorities are required to assure that 
equal employment opportunity provisions are applied to 
all employment practices.  (Also see the OJD Policy 
Statement on Unlawful Discrimination and Harassment.) 

II.

ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTIONS

A.

Overview

OJD was created in Article III, Section 1, of the Oregon Constitution.  The
Chief Justice is responsible for the administration of the judicial branch of
government and is designated as the administrative head of OJD which
includes the appellate, tax, and circuit courts.  It is the Chief Justice’s
responsibility to promulgate a personnel plan for all officers and
employees of the courts governing appointment, compensation,
promotion, discipline, and all other aspects of employment.  The Chief
Justice is also charged with the duty of supervising a statewide plan for
budgeting, accounting, and fiscal management of OJD.  The department
has 1,506 employees as of September 30, 2018.  Judges are elected
officials and not employees and, as such, not subject to the report.  There
is a total of 194 judges in the Oregon appellate, tax, and circuit courts.

1B. 

Appellate and Tax Courts 

The Supreme Court consists of seven justices and is the court of last 
appellate resort in the state court system.  The Court of Appeals consists 
of thirteen judges who hear appeals from circuit courts, agencies, and 
boards.  One Tax Court judge hears matters arising from Oregon tax law.  
The Tax Magistrate Division includes three tax magistrates, appointed by 
the Tax Judge, who oversee less formal tax appeal proceedings. 

C.  Office of the State Court Administrator 

ORS Chapter 8 (primarily) establishes and defines the duties of the Office 
of the State Court Administrator.  The State Court Administrator serves 
under the direction of the Chief Justice.  The State Court Administrator is 
generally responsible for certain centralized functions of the unified 
Oregon State court system including legal counsel, internal audit, judicial 
and staff education, enterprise technology systems, budget and financial 
administration, court statistics and program support, human resource 
management, and intergovernmental relations.  Administration of the 
Citizens Review Board Program, Juvenile and Family Court Programs, 
Court Language Access Services, State of Oregon Law Library, and 
Appellate Court Records Section are also funded and managed within the 
office. 

D. 

Circuit Courts 

The circuit courts are general jurisdiction trial courts located in each of the 
36 counties, organized as 27 judicial districts, and served by 173 judges.  
These courts adjudicate matters and disputes in criminal, civil, domestic 
relations, traffic, juvenile, small claims, violations, abuse prevention, 
probate, civil commitment, adoption, and guardianship cases. 

Pursuant to ORS 1.003, the Chief Justice appointed 27 judges to serve 
as presiding judge in each district for administrative purposes.  Their 
general authority is described in ORS 1.171.  The nonjudicial operations 
of the circuit courts are managed by 27 trial court administrators who are 
appointed and supervised by the presiding judges.  Their general 
authority is described in ORS 8.225.  Their duties include personnel 
administration, budget and financial management, court operations, and 
jury management. 

E.  Oregon Supreme Court Council on Inclusion & Fairness 

The Oregon Supreme Court Council on Inclusion & Fairness (OSCCIF) 
works to ensure that all persons have equal access to Oregon state 
courts for fair and efficient dispute resolution.  It also advises the Chief 

2Justice on matter of systemic racial, ethnic, and gender bias in the 
Oregon Judicial Department.  Among other efforts, OSCCIF is working 
towards promoting a diverse workforce that reflects the community at 
large, and is monitoring and striving to accelerate OJD’s progress while 
promoting inclusion and fairness opportunities for judges and staff.

6V. 

UTILIZATION ANALYSIS 

The goal of OJD is to have an employee workforce which reflects the 
Oregon labor force in terms of the representation of women, people of 
color, and persons with disabilities.  To determine how close OJD is to this 
goal, the following steps were taken: 

A. 

The Oregon labor force was identified in the “EEO Tabulation 2006-
2010 (5-year ACS data)” provided through “American FactFinder” 
and published by the U.S. Census Bureau.  This report outlines EEO 
residence data for each occupational category by race and ethnicity. 

B. 

The Oregon labor force was summarized by EEO job categories (as 
defined by current EEOC guidelines). 

C.  OJD workforce was summarized by county and by EEO-4 job 
categories based on the workforce as of September 30, 2018. 

D. 

A form requesting information on race/ethnicity and disability status 
is provided to new employees. 

E.  OJD workforce was compared with the Oregon labor force. 

County labor force data was used to evaluate the EEO job categories of 
Administrative Support.  The Administrative Support job category equals 
71 percent of the OJD workforce.  Most persons who apply for jobs in this 
job category reside within the county where the jobs are located. 

Statewide labor force data was used to evaluate the remaining EEO job 
categories of Officials and Administrators, Professionals, and Technicians.  
These jobs tend to attract applicants from all areas of the state as well as 
outside the state.  In addition, they represent such a small number of 
positions per circuit court that a countywide utilization analysis would be 
irrelevant. 

The analysis of OJD’s workforce included individual racial/ethnic groups 
and also a combined total of all racial/ethnic groups.  The analysis further 
separates the racial/ethnic groups and job categories by gender. 

The analysis also included a report of the department’s (self-reported) 
disabled workforce compared to the disabled workforce identified in the 
“2008-2012 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates” report 
provided through the “American FactFinder” and published by the U.S. 
Census Bureau.   

7Note:  This report is not separated by occupational category therefore the 
data is less exact.  Additionally, the data source previously used as a basis 
for analysis had not been updated since October 2004.  To obtain a 
current data source, projected to be available more often, in 2015 the data 
source for the disabled workforce was changed to the 2008-2012 
American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates report.   

A designation was added to this Affirmative Action Report (as of 2003) to 
provide employees the option of choosing “multi-racial/ethnic” (now titled 
“two or more races”) as their primary designation.  (Employees so electing 
were also asked to select from among the state of Oregon’s recognized 
racial/ethnic categories for reporting purposes.)  A work force analysis 
report in the Appendix reflects this information.  The percentage of 
employees designating “two or more races” increased from the previous 
report period ( 4.5 percent) to 5.1 percent.   

uring the 2009 report period, OJD revised the racial/ethnic categories as 

directed by the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs.  
The revision (from five racial/ethnic categories to seven) brings OJD into 
compliance with the reporting requirements for obtaining federal grant 
monies.  As a result, a new census survey was conducted and a database 
was developed to store and analyze the information. 

  D

I.  DATA DURING PERIOD OF REPORT 

  V

A comparison of OJD’s Affirmative Action Report data since 2001 indicates 
that since the 2007 report period the department has 

•  Maintained parity for women in all job categories, although 

improvement is still needed in one category. 

• 

• 

Increased the percentage of representation for people of color, 
although improvement is still needed in two of four categories. 

Improved the overall percentage of representation for persons with 
disabilities, although improvement is still needed in three of four 
categories. 

Below is a summary of the findings.  The following two pages provide 
specific numerical information as well as a comparison to previous years.

Note:  The availability data imported from the "2008-2012 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates" this

disabled workforce may be related to the change in data source as well as implementation of the 2010 U.S.

YEARLY COMPARISON OF “UNDERUTILIZATION” (continued) 

1See Appendix pages 19-62 for data underlying these numbers. 

Note:  The availability data imported from the "2008-2012 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates" this 
reporting period provided an update from 2004 Oregon Employment Department data.  (This is the 
"denominator" of availability.)  Some portion of the difference between the 2013 and 2015 reports for the 
disabled workforce may be related to the change in data source as well as implementation of the 2010 U.S. 
Census data. 

11As of September 2016, OJD met or exceeded parity for women in three of 
the four job categories. The job category with underutilization of women is 
Technicians.  The department’s goal is to improve representation in this 
job category. 

Regarding people of color, the department met or exceeded parity in two of 
the four job categories.  Parity for the Officials and Administrators job 
category was reached this reporting period.  Parity for the Professionals 
job category continued.  The department’s goal is to improve 
representation in the Technicians and Administrative Support job 
categories.   

During this report period, employees with disabilities continue to comprise 
1.4 percent of OJD workforce, a continued decrease from 2.7 percent 
reported in 2009, 2.48 percent reported in 2011, 2.0 percent reported in 
2013, and 1.5 percent reported in 2015.  Although the data on the disabled 
workforce is not separated by occupational category, the department’s 
goal is to continue to improve representation in all categories. 

A summary of each EEO category listed below provides a brief review and 
findings.  A detailed breakdown of each EEO category can be found in the 
Appendix. 

EEO Category:  Officials and Administrators 

Occupations in which employees set broad policies; exercise overall 
responsibility for execution of these policies; direct individual departments 
or special phases of the court’s or division’s operations; or provide 
specialized consultation on a regional, district, or area basis.  
Classifications include: 

JD has 53 employees in this category of work.  There are 34 females, 6 

people of color, and 1 person with disabilities in this category.  The 
statewide labor force availability for this group indicates that a goal should 
be established to hire two persons with disabilities in this category.

Note:  This update of the AA Report reflects a decrease in underutilization of persons with 
disabilities.  (This is the “numerator” of availability). The availability data imported from the 
“2008-2012 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates” this reporting period provided an 
update from 2004 Oregon Employment Department data.  (This is the “denominator” of 
availability.)  Some portion of the difference between the 2013 and 2015 reports for the disabled 
workforce may be related to the change in data source as well as implementation of the 2010 
U.S. Census data.

job category is established, OJD will strive to recruit a more diverse work 
force.  

OJD is working to develop and implement initiatives, as budget allows, 
which attract and recognize diversity in the work place and provide better 
customer service.   

III.  JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT NEW AND ONGOING INITIATIVES 

  V

Some of the initiatives include: 

Language Initiatives 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Providing testing and a pay differential for eligible department 
employees who possess bilingual skills.  (This has been ongoing 
since 2000.  The test and testing process were updated in March 
2016.) 

Training 

Providing a separate, comprehensive recruitment and selection 
training module to supervisors and lead workers with a component 
on affirmative action and diversity.  (This has been ongoing since 
2004.) 

Providing customized affirmative action and diversity training for 
individual court’s management and staff (upon request). 

Providing a training module to supervisors and lead workers with a 
component on implicit bias.  (This has been ongoing since 2016.) 

OJD Job Announcements 

Providing links to all department job announcements postings on 
popular web sites as well as the department’s internet and intranet 
web pages.  (Ongoing) 

16• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Posting all department job announcements on the state of Oregon 
jobs page.  (Ongoing) 

Posting announcements of professional-level positions on the 
National Center for State Courts (NCSC) web page and other related 
sites.  (This has been ongoing since 2002.) 

OJD Recruitment 

Implementing a new recruitment software system (NEOGOV™) 
purchased by the executive branch for use in all three branches.  
This allows applicants to apply for OJD jobs online and to follow the 
recruitment process, and also allows hiring managers to expedite the 
recruitment process by up to 30%. (This occurred in January 2010.) 

 

OJD EEO Census 

Updating the census form regarding race/ethnicity and disability 
status in the new employee packet information to reflect the 
additional racial/ethnic categories.  (This occurred in May 2008.) 

School-to-Work 

Participating in mock interviews of high school students to provide 
feedback on their interviewing skills, résumés, and appearance.  
(This has been ongoing since 2001.) 

Job Fairs and Employee Development 

Creating developmental and rotational job opportunities and job 
shadowing for those employees interested in furthering their career 
with OJD.  (This has been ongoing since 2004.) 

Developing opportunities for underfilling positions for those 
employees who do not meet the minimum qualifications and where 
recruitment for qualified individuals is difficult.  (This has been 
ongoing since 2002.) 

Providing a centrally coordinated mentorship program for new trial 
court administrators and division directors.  (This has been ongoing 
since 2002.) 

Including in all personnel-related training programs (for employees 
and judges) relevant information on affirmative action and 
discrimination. (Ongoing) 

17Attending selected job fairs throughout the state to conduct outreach 
and promote the work of OJD.  (This has been ongoing since 2006.) 

Other Initiatives 

Posting the Affirmative Action Report, personnel rules/policies, and 
other personnel-related information to the department’s intranet web 
page for all employees to access.  (This has been ongoing since 
2001.) 

Posting the Equal Employment Opportunity Plan (EEOP) to the 
department’s intranet web page for all employees to access.  (This 
has been ongoing since 2006.) 

Incorporating the Affirmative Action Report into the existing EEO 
module of supervisory training.  (Ongoing) 

Ensuring OJD statewide committees and boards represent the 
diversity of the workforce.  (Ongoing) 

Maintaining recruitment software (NEOGOV™) which tracks 
applicant data for analysis to determine recruitment and outreach 
strategies. (This was implemented January 2010.) 

The department has maintained parity for representation of women in the 
Officials and Administrators, Professionals, and Administrative Support job 
categories.  Improvement is needed to achieve parity for representation of 
women in the Technicians job category.  The department has maintained 
parity for representation of people of color in the Professionals job 
category; has reached parity in the Officials and Administrators job 
category; and continues to work to achieve parity in the Technicians and 
Administrative Support job categories.  More effort and emphasis is 
needed to recruit for persons with disabilities in the all job categories. 

In the 2019-2021 biennium, OJD will continue to pursue the following goals 
and strategies: 

Recruit open competitively; use diverse interview panels where 
possible. 

Prioritize efforts to recruit people of color, women, and persons with 
disabilities to reflect an improved representation in all job categories.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
