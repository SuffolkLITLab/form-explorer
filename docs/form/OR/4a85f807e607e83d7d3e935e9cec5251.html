      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre>Assignment:  An event assigned to an interpreter during their block. 

vailable:  The interpreter is in communication with the scheduler by mobile telephone 

during the block and is ready to interpret assignments as directed. 

illable:  An assignment or expense that is eligible for payment or reimbursement from 

OJD.  See also canceled billable and canceled non-billable. 

illing Increments:  Interpreting time for extended blocks is recorded in quarter hours 

(15 minutes), rounded up to the nearest 15-minutes (.25 hours). 

illing Statement:  The OJD form completed by interpreters for payment for services 

provided and confirmed expenses. 

lock:  The guaranteed minimum payment for a confirmed interpreter.  A block has a 
designated beginning time and end time; may be 2 to 8 hours (or fractions thereof) in 
length; may be scheduled more than once per day; and may include:  reassignment, 
preparation time, an unpaid lunch break, or extensions of the block.  Multi-day requests 
are separate blocks. 

reak:  An unpaid lunch time determined by the court when the interpreter is not 
expected to interpret.  For services provided during a lunch break, see section 4.m 
below. 

anceled Billable:  An interpreter was no longer needed, and the assignment was 

canceled by the scheduler after 8:00 a.m., two judicial days before the assignment.  The 
interpreter may bill for the block and must remain available for reassignment until the 
block has ended. 

Example:  If a confirmed block for Monday from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. is canceled the 
previous Thursday at 11:00 a.m., then there were less than two judicial days before the 
assignment was canceled.  The block is considered to be canceled billable, and the 
interpreter must remain available for possible reassignment on Monday from 9:00 a.m. 
to 12:00 p.m. 

anceled Non-Billable:  An interpreter was no longer needed, and the assignment was 

canceled by the scheduler before 8:00 a.m., two judicial days before the assignment.  
The interpreter does not need to remain available. 

onfirmed/Confirmation:  OJD pre-assignment written agreement of the services and 

payment terms according to OJD Payment Protocols. 

ourtesy Interpreting:  Incidental interpreting for attorney-client communication limited 

to 10 minutes or less. 

Extended Block:  An interpreter provides services before or after the block, or during a 
lunch break to accommodate the scheduler or the court.

Oregon Judicial Department (OJD) 
Payment Protocols for Contract Court Interpreters 
Effective:  January 1, 2022 

1. 

DEFINITIONS 

Extraordinary Expense:  An unforeseen expenditure confirmed as billable by the 
scheduler (e.g., extraordinary travel circumstances, international calling charges).  
Interpreters must communicate an unforeseen expense to the scheduler for confirmation 
within one judicial day after the expense is incurred. 

ndependent Contractor:  A freelance interpreter who is not an employee of the state, 
who provides services in adherence to the Code of Professional Responsibility for 
Interpreters in the Oregon Courts, and who provides their own tools and transportation. 

nterpreter Services:  In-person or remote professional interpreting for a fee in 
adherence to the Code of Professional Responsibility for Interpreters in the Oregon 
Courts. 

nterpreting Tools:  Interpreting equipment for in-person or remote interpreting 
services, which may include notepads, pens, mobile phone, simultaneous interpreting 
equipment, internet connected computer and videoconferencing applications, web 
camera, or wired headset with microphone and mute button. 

udicial days:  Official court business days. 

ate:  An interpreter arriving after the confirmed assignment start time. 

ileage:  Reimbursable expense for contractor-owned vehicle to travel outside of the 
city of residence, calculated city to city, using the OJD mileage chart.  Mileage is paid at 
the Federal Travel Rates. 

ulti-Day Request:  A request for a language need that spans more than one judicial 
day.  Each day is considered a separate block with distinct canceled billable times (i.e., a 
request for a 5-day trial equates to 5 confirmed blocks, one for each day). 

Example:  A 5-day trial, confirmed as a 7-hour block each judicial day, ends early on the 
morning of the 2nd day.  Days 1 and 2 are billable, days 3 and 4 are canceled billable, 
and day 5 is canceled non-billable.  The interpreter must remain available for 
reassignment for the remainder of day 2 and all day on days 3 and 4. 

JD – CLAS Mileage Chart:  An OJD tool used to calculate distances from city to city 

for billing.  The OJD-CLAS mileage chart replaces the Oregon Department of 
Administrative Services mileage chart (2021). 

er Diem:  A daily allowance for lodging or meal expenses while traveling.  They may 

be offered at the scheduler’s discretion.  Per diem rates are the Federal Standard 
Oregon Rate.  OJD direct-billed lodging reservations will be made by the scheduler. 

reparation Time:  Time offered at the scheduler’s discretion for an interpreter to 

review case-specific information for a complex assignment. 

eassigned/Reassignment:  The scheduler may direct the interpreter to a new OJD 
assignment or assignments in the same or a different county.  The overall time required 
for the new assignment(s), including travel time, must fall within the original block start 
and end times. 

equest:  Language need for interpretation received by CLAS.

Returned Assignment:  When a confirmed interpreter informs the scheduler that they 
are no longer available to fulfill an assignment or block. 

Scheduler:  OJD Court Language Access Services personnel who provide direction to 
and confirm services of interpreters.  Direction from court personnel, judges, attorneys, 
court security officers, or others do not constitute confirmed services payable from 
statewide funds. 

imely Notification:  Communication with the scheduler within one judicial day after an 

incident of extraordinary expense or an extended block. 

ravel Time Formula (OJD formula):  A standard rate of 1.2 minutes per mile (or 1 hour 

for every 50 miles traveled), at half of the hourly interpreting rate. 
Travel time = (total mileage/50) x (0.5 x hourly interpreting rate) 

ravel Time:  Reimbursable expense for the duration of ground travel to and from an 

OJD assignment location.  Ground travel is paid according to the OJD Travel Time 
Formula, regardless of actual time traveled.  Other forms of travel time are negotiable. 

navailable:  The confirmed interpreter is not in communication with the scheduler by 
mobile telephone during the block, is late, or otherwise not ready to provide interpreting 
services as described in the confirmation. 

2. 

OVERVIEW AND PAYMENT AUTHORITY 

The purpose of these policies is to provide interpreters, courts, and interested persons 
information about payments for interpreting services at the Oregon Judicial Department 
(OJD).  The interpreter services provided according to these policies are those of an 
independent contractor who is not an employee of the state.  The State Court 
Administrator assists the Chief Justice in supervising the state courts by setting out the 
statewide personnel and administrative rules and policies for courts in a unified state 
court system.  The State Court Administrator oversees state-funded court interpreter 
services and only the State Court Administrator or their designee can authorize 
exceptions to these policies.  The Office of the State Court Administrator provides 
centralized court interpreter scheduling services through scheduling staff in Court 
Language Access Services (CLAS). 

JD provides limited English proficient (LEP) and deaf or hard-of-hearing court users 
with meaningful language access to court programs and services.  Interpreting services 
are provided for exclusive use in court proceedings and to assist OJD judges and 
personnel to do the work of the court (ORS 45.275).  Where the statutes are silent or the 
law provides for others to pay for judicial-related services, the OJD does not have a 
responsibility to pay for interpreting services.  However, for the efficiency of the court 
process, interpreters may provide brief, courtesy interpreting services for incidental 
communication. 

3. 

ADHERENCE TO THE CPR 

All interpreters must adhere to the Code of Professional Responsibility for Interpreters in 
Oregon Courts (CPR) while providing interpreting services to OJD.

Assignments are offered as blocks of time, which are confirmed at the time of 
scheduling. 

The confirmed block constitutes the guaranteed minimum payment for 
interpreters who remain available to OJD during the entire block. 

During a block, interpreters must have a mobile phone for communication with 
the scheduler. 

Blocks may be two (2) to eight (8) hours in duration, and are scheduled in quarter 
hour increments (e.g., 6.5 hours, 3.25 hours). 

Preparation time, if any, must be approved by the scheduler and included in the 
block. 

Blocks may be confirmed as one or more separate blocks during the same day. 

Blocks may be scheduled in more than one OJD judicial district and may include 
reassignment during the block. 

The court or the scheduler may request an interpreter to extend their block, 
however, the interpreter is not obligated to do so. 

Interpreters must inform the scheduler of court-initiated extended blocks within 
one judicial business day after the extended block. 

After completing the last assignment scheduled during a block, interpreters must 
contact the scheduler for additional assignments during the time remaining in the 
block, if any. 

Unpaid lunch breaks during a block are at the court’s discretion.  Lunch breaks 
are assumed, but not guaranteed to last 60 minutes or fall between 12:00 p.m. 
and 1:00 p.m. 
 
If a block is scheduled to begin before the lunch hour and end after the lunch 
hour: 

The total block duration will reflect the reduction of 60 minutes to 
accommodate the unpaid meal period. 

The interpreter must take their 60-minute meal period during the court 
ordered break. 

If the interpreter receives a shortened meal break or is required to be 
available to the court for longer than the confirmed block time, the 
interpreter must notify the scheduler within one judicial business day after 
the extended block in order to be paid for the additional interpreting time.

BLOCKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES 

OJD Payment Protocols for Contract Court Interpreters 

 

Page 4 of 7 

5. 

CANCELLATIONS 

Blocks may be canceled by the scheduler at any time. 

The time of cancellation determines whether the assignment is canceled billable 
or canceled non-billable and the interpreter’s obligation to remain available or 
not. 

Each day of a multi-day request is a separate block. 

Court closures due to inclement weather or an emergency at the assigned block 
location are canceled billable blocks. 

Interpreters may return assignments by notifying the scheduler at the earliest 
opportunity, and may not send another interpreter in their place. 

6.

a. 

Hourly interpreting rates: 

•  OJD Certified Spoken Language Court Interpreter:  $50/hour

•  OJD Registered Court Interpreter:  $37/hour 

•  Non-Certified Interpreter (must be conditionally approved):  $30/hour 

•  Out-of-state interpreter:  negotiable 
 

OJD will not reimburse or pay for any expense not included in the confirmation. 

Original receipts must accompany a request for reimbursement of confirmed 
expenses. 

Scanned copies or vendor supplied electronic copies of original receipts 
are permitted. 

Original receipts must show the merchant’s name, the expense amount, a 
detailed description of the purchased service or item, and the date of 
purchase. 

Extraordinary expenses must be reported to and confirmed by the scheduler 
within one judicial day after the expense was incurred. 
 
Interpreting time for extended blocks is recorded in quarter hours, rounded up to 
the nearest 15 minutes (.25 hours). 
 
Mileage: 

Mileage reimbursement is billable for travel outside of the interpreter’s city 
of residence, using the OJD – CLAS Mileage Chart. 

For cities not listed on the OJD – CLAS Mileage Chart, Google Maps

Travel time is billed at ½ of the hourly interpreting rate. 

Travel time is billable when: 

•  Travel to an OJD assignment location occurs before the block 

begins and is more than 40 miles each way. 

•  Travel from an OJD assignment location occurs after the block 

ends and is over 40 miles each way. 

•  Travel to or from an OJD assignment is over 40 miles each way 

and is during a block of 2 hours or less. 

Travel time is calculated using the mileage definition and this OJD 
formula:  Travel time = (total mileage/50) x (0.5 x hourly interpreting rate) 
(i.e., total mileage divided by 50, times ½ of the hourly interpreting rate). 

 
Per diem is billable if confirmed by the scheduler. 
 
Other expense reimbursements are billable if confirmed by the scheduler.

Travel Time: 

Interpreters must submit their bill using the OJD billing statement. 
 
Payment for completed services is normally made within 30 days of the date the 
OJD billing statement is received by CLAS. 
 
45 days after CLAS receives the OJD billing statement, the interpreter may 
assess OJD overdue account charges up to a maximum rate of two-thirds of one 
percent per month (8% APR) on the outstanding balance (per ORS 293.462). 
 
The following are examples, among others, of reasons why an interpreter’s 
payment may be reduced, delayed, or denied: 

Payment reduced
