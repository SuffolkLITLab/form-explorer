The Oregon Judicial Branch is the third branch of state government. Its 
powers are equal to the powers of the Executive and Legislative branches. 
Each of the three branches perform different government functions (this is 
called the separation of powers), with limited power over each other’s 
actions in a system of checks and balances. This prevents any one branch 
or official from becoming too powerful.  

he overall role of the state courts is to make sure that: 

  T

•  Oregonians have access to justice 
•  Oregonians receive fair due process (legal rights owed to persons) 
Individual rights of all citizens are protected (the right to life, liberty, 
• 
and the pursuit of happiness)  
•  Community welfare is preserved 
•  The circuit, appellate, and tax courts hear disputes within their 

jurisdictions (the legal authority of a court to hear and decide certain 
types of cases) to: 

–  safeguard the rule of law by deciding criminal, civil, family, and 

– 

other types of legal disputes 
interpret, clarify, and apply the state and federal constitutions 
and laws while making decisions on cases 

–  hold hearings and trials throughout the state 

 

 

 

Although OJD’s circuit courts are spread out over the state’s 36 counties, 
they function as a unified court system using the same court standards, 
practices, business processes, and administrative methods to deliver 
justice. This statewide consistency ensures that all citizens receive the 
same quality of justice in Oregon’s state courts no matter what county they 
live in and which circuit court they do business with.  

dministrative Structure 

  A

An organization’s administrative structure is made up of coordinated levels 
of authority that make decisions, manage personnel, and oversee 
responsibilities and workflows. Oregon law designates the Chief Justice of 
the Supreme Court as the administrative head of the Judicial Department – 
exercising administrative authority over the appellate, circuit, tax courts, 
and the Office of the State Court Administrator. The Chief Justice, along 
with other top administrators govern the functioning of the state courts to 
make sure that Judicial Branch rules, procedures, policies, standards, and 
state laws are followed by all levels of court management and employees, 
as well as legal partners, agencies, the public, and all who do business 
with the courts. OJD’s levels of authority are shown in Chart 1. 
 
 

Introduction 

Judicial Branch 
Mission 

 

As a separate and 
independent branch  
of government, our 
mission is to provide fair 
and accessible justice 
services that protect  
the rights of individuals, 
preserve community 
welfare, and inspire public 
confidence.

Revised November 2019 

 

hief Justice of the Oregon 

Supreme Court 
Martha L. Walters was elected by her fellow Supreme Court justices to 
become Oregon’s 44th Chief Justice on July 1, 2018. Chief Justice Walters 
has served as a justice on the Supreme Court since 2006. By law, the 
Chief Justice is the administrative head of the entire Oregon Judicial 
Branch. She leads the Supreme Court of Oregon; hears and writes 
opinions on Supreme Court cases with the other justices; and supervises 
the state court system that consists of 198 judges and more than 1619.2 
full and part-time staff. As administrative head of the Judicial Branch she 
has the authority to issue Chief Justice Orders (CJOs) and adopt Uniform 
Trial Court Rules (UTCRs) that all 36 circuit courts must comply with. She 
also reviews and approves Supplementary Local Rules (SLRs) submitted 
for approval by any circuit court. If the Chief Justice approves an SLR, it 
will only affect procedures in the court that submitted it. 

he Chief Justice appoints the chief judge of the Court of Appeals, the 
presiding judges of the circuit courts, the state court administrator, and 
members of special committees, councils, task forces, and workgroups. 
She represents the Oregon Judicial Branch on national judicial 
committees, at conferences, and participates in projects, stakeholder 
organizations, and local government.

Oregon Judicial Conference 

The State of Oregon Judicial Conference was enacted by Oregon law. It is 
composed of all Oregon Supreme Court justices, Court of Appeals judges, 
the Tax Court Judge, all circuit court judges, and all senior judges (retired 
judges). The Conference, chaired by the Chief Justice of the Supreme 
Court, allows members to discuss the current business of the Judicial 
Branch, the administration, operation, and procedures of the courts, 
jurisdiction matters, new and updated legislation, court-initiated bills to 
present to the Legislature for consideration, recommendations on 
legislative proposals from outside sources that affect the courts, and 
trends in case law. The Conference provides an annual report of 
significant conference results, including any recommendations for court-
related legislation to the Governor of the State of Oregon.

In addition to hearing appeals and meeting responsibilities as Judicial 
Branch administrative authorities, the Oregon Supreme Court and the 
Oregon Court of Appeals also have explicit decision-making 
responsibilities related to the following Judicial Branch affiliates: 

Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure that govern procedure and 
practice in all Oregon circuit courts). The Oregon Supreme Court 
and the Oregon Court of Appeals each choose a judge from their 
ranks to sit on the Council and eight Oregon circuit court judges 
are selected by the Oregon Circuit Court Judges Association. The 
Supreme Court also selects one member of the public to sit on the 
Council. 

–  Office of Public Defense Services (OPDS) (provides lawyers for 
qualified people who cannot afford a lawyer in criminal, juvenile, 
and mental commitment cases). The Chief Justice of the Oregon 
Supreme Court appoints the Public Defense Services 
Commission, whose job is to establish the OPDS as “a public 
defense system that provides cost-effective public defense 
services that adhere to the Oregon Constitution, the United States 
Constitution, and the Oregon and national standards of justice.” 
–  Commission on Judicial Fitness and Disability (investigates 
complaints about the conduct of judges and recommends 
discipline). The Oregon Supreme Court appoints three judges to 
serve on the nine-member commission, which makes disciplinary 
action recommendations to the Supreme Court that may then 
censure, suspend, or remove the judge from office. 

–  Oregon State Bar – (regulates the practice of law and lawyer 

conduct). The Oregon Supreme Court admits lawyers to practice 
law in Oregon (upon recommendation of the Board of Bar 
Examiners), and can reprimand, suspend, or disbar lawyers 
whose actions have been prosecuted by the Oregon State Bar.

The Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court appoints Oregon’s State 
Court Administrator (SCA) to act as OJD’s chief administrative officer. 
The State Court Administrator assists the Chief Justice by setting out 
statewide personnel and administrative rules and policies that courts must 
follow as part of Oregon’s unified state court system. These 
responsibilities are accomplished with the support and work of the Office 
of the State Court Administrator’s (OSCA’s) divisions, offices, and 
programs under the leadership of the SCA (see Chart 2 below).

Oregon Tax Court 
The Oregon Tax Court, which is a trial court that hears tax law cases from 
all areas of the state, has two divisions – the Magistrate Division and the 
Regular Division. Tax Court complaints are initially submitted to the 
Magistrate Division. The Tax Court Judge of the Regular Division hears 
appeals, de novo (heard as a new case without knowledge of the 
originating complaint), on the decisions of the Tax Court Magistrate 
Division. Oregon’s Tax Court Judge is elected for a six-year term and has 
the same level of administrative authority in the Tax Court as a presiding 
judge in the circuit courts. He administers the business of the Tax Court, 
appoints the magistrates of the Magistrate Division, and assigns causes, 
matters, duties, and proceedings of the Tax Court.

Presiding Judges 
Each of Oregon’s 36 counties has a circuit court. They are grouped 
within 27 judicial districts across Oregon (some districts have multiple 
counties and courthouses). The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court 
appoints presiding judges (PJs) for a two-year term to exercise 
administrative authority over the circuit court/s of each judicial district. 
The PJ administers “local” district court business and programs, 
supervises the circuit court judges, trial court administrator (TCA), and 
staff, assigns cases and workload to circuit court judges within the 
district, oversees the writing and submission of local court SLRs, issues 
Presiding Judge Orders (PJOs), and maintains public outreach in the  
local court communities. This level of administrative authority gives 
circuit courts some flexibility to use resources needed by the local 
population and address local community issues that bring people to 
court (some counties have more drug-related crimes than other 
counties, for example). When requested by the Chief Justice, PJs also 
provide the Chief Justice and State Court Administrator with 
information, reports, data, and recommendations on local or national 
judicial developments that are of importance to state courts and 
Oregon’s Judicial Branch.

Administrative Structure and Function: Oregon Judicial Department 
Revised November 2019 

Trial Court Administrators 
All PJs rely on a trial court administrator (TCA), who is the court’s chief 
operating officer and manages day-to-day business operations of the 
court. The TCA is appointed by and reports directly to the PJ. While most 
TCAs manage a single district, two districts (District 13 – Klamath County 
and District 26 – Lake County) are managed by one TCA who reports to 
two PJs. 
 

•  All circuit court TCAs have a legal responsibility to ensure the court 
operates under the state court system’s rules and policies. They 
make sure that all court proceedings are recorded (circuit courts are 
the “court of record” where every word spoken during a trial must be 
preserved in case the court’s decision is appealed). With the 
assistance of court staff, TCAs ensure that case orders and 
judgments are entered into the case management system and 
cases are stamped with the court seal as required by law, among 
other legally required tasks. TCAs manage the court’s budget, 
supervise staff and supervisors, manage and direct the court’s 
administrative programs, work with agencies and stakeholders in the 
court’s local community, implement new policies and procedures, 
and advise the court PJ of any issues or problems that could affect 
court operations or security.

Oregon’s state court system is structured to coordinate the functions, 
efforts, and accomplishments that each level of administrative authority 
manages. OJD’s administrative authorities, justices, and judges also serve 
on committees, councils, commissions, and forums on a wide range of 
justice, court policy, and public safety topics. They also serve as primary 
communication channels where information flows back and forth from one 
administrative level to the next – expanding organizational knowledge and 
ensuring consistent processes across the state as the work of judges, 
administrators, and staff serves the justice needs of Oregonians 
throughout the state.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
