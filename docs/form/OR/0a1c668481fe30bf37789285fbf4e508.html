OREGON APPELLATE COURTS

Style Manual 
(Updated 2022)

Preface

The Oregon Appellate Courts have adopted this style manual as a guideline for
conventions used in format, citation, quotation, and style when writing opinions.
It is not all-inclusive nor an attempt to dictate writing style. See ORAP 5.20(45)
(referring to Style Manual as guide to conventions in style and citation).

Sincere appreciation to all who added their time and talent to this project.

For form and style questions not covered by this manual,
please contact the OJD Publications Program
(publications@ojd.state.or.us).

In General

FORMATTING

Slip opinions are double spaced; indented quoted material is single spaced and 
 
formatted in the same style as the original material; footnotes are placed at the bottom 
of the page on which they are referenced. Line numbers are set out along the left hand 
margin, except the footnote section. The courts use Times New Roman, 13-point font.

 
Slip opinions consist of a title page, which includes a designation of prevailing 
party	and	award	of	costs	portion,	followed	by	the	body	of	the	opinion.	Cases	Affirmed	
Without Opinion (AWOP) consist of a title page only. Per Curiam Opinions may 
consist of a title page only, but have the same weight of authority as a signed opinion. 
Therefore, it is not necessary to indicate parenthetically whether an opinion cited is 
Per	Curiam.	Cases	that	are	Affirmed	By	An	Equally	Divided	Court	are	resolved	by	
opinion—as opposed to an order—and can consist of a title page only unless a concurring 
or dissenting opinion is written. 

Listed below are the essential elements found on a standard title page of an 

 
appellate court opinion, followed by the substantive components generally contained 
within the body of an opinion. Please note that these are models only and that actual title 
pages and opinions may vary due to the particular requirements of an individual case. 

 

5 

I. Title Page

A. 

Date of Opinion

 
page preceded by FILED:.

The date that the opinion issues is located in the upper right hand corner of the 

B. 

Identifying Caption of the Appellate Court Issuing the Opinion

The	identification	of	the	appellate	court	is	centered	on	the	page	in	uppercase	

	
letters, e.g.,

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE  
STATE OF OREGON

IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE  
STATE OF OREGON

IN THE OREGON TAX COURT  
REGULAR DIVISION

IN THE OREGON TAX COURT  
MAGISTRATE DIVISION

For nonprecedential memorandum opinions issued by the Court of Appeals, the 

 
following recitation will precede the caption:

This is a nonprecedential memorandum opinion pursuant to ORAP 10.30 and may not be cited 
except as provided in ORAP 10.30(1).

C. 

Names and Roles of the Parties to the Case

 
Parties are generally listed in the order in which they appeared in the lower court 
or tribunal, but using their appellate court designations: appellant, respondent, petitioner 
on review, respondent on review, etc. That information is generally taken from the 
originating	document	filed	for	a	case,	e.g., the Notice of Appeal or Petition for Judicial 
Review.

In	criminal	cases,	the	STATE	OF	OREGON	is	the	first	party	listed,	followed	by	

	
the full name of the defendant.

D.	

Identification	Numbers

	
Each	appellate	case	is	assigned	a	number	when	filed,	which	is	centered	on	the	
title page below the names of the parties to the case and preceded by any identifying 
number(s) from the court or agency in which the case originated. If cases have been 
consolidated on appeal or review, then both appellate case numbers are listed. A Supreme 
Court case number begins with an “S,” a Court of Appeals case number begins with an 
“A,” a Tax Court-Regular Division case number begins with “TC,” and a Tax Court-
Magistrate Division case number begins with “TC-MD.”

 

6 

E.	

En	Banc

If	a	case	is	decided	by	the	full	court,	then	that	will	be	noted	in	the	first	line	starting	

	
at the left-hand margin. No period follows the en banc designation. The initial letter in 
each word is in uppercase on the title page (e.g., En Banc), but when used within the text 
of an opinion, the term is in lowercase letters.

F.	

	

Court	/	Agency	of	Origination

Identifies	where	/	how	the	case	originated.

G. 

Trial Court Judge

Identifies	judge(s)	who	signed	the	appealable	judgment(s)	or	order(s)	that	are	the	

	
subject of the appeal. The Supreme Court footnotes that information on the title page with 
an asterisk.

Identifies	when	the	case	was	submitted	and	whether	it	was	argued.	Some	cases	are	

H.	

Argued	and	Submitted	Date

	
submitted on the record only.

I. 

Names of Counsel

 
The attorney(s) for all parties to a case are named. If a party appears for himself or 
herself (sometimes referred to as pro se), then that is noted. A person or entity appearing 
as amicus curiae is	also	identified	here,	along	with	the	counsel	of	record.	Counsel	names	
are	listed	as	they	appear	on	the	signature	line	of	the	briefs	filed	in	the	case.

	
Regarding	Department	of	Justice	(DOJ)	attorneys,	use	official	titles	(e.g., Attorney 
General, Deputy Attorney General, Solicitor General, Deputy Solicitor General, Assistant 
Attorney	General),	but	do	not	uses	any	internal	DOJ	classification	or	position	description,	
such as “Attorney-in-Charge, Post-Conviction Section” or “Senior Assistant Attorney 
General,” etc.

Regarding	Office	of	Public	Defense	Services	(OPDS)	attorneys,	use	official	titles	

	
(e.g., Chief Defender, Criminal Appellate Section; Chief Defender, Juvenile Appellate 
Section;	Deputy	Public	Defender),	but	do	not	use	any	internal	OPDS	classification	or	
position description, such as “Chief Deputy,” “Senior Deputy Public Defender,” etc.

J.	

Panel	of	Judges	/	Justices

 
The panel of judges (in the Court of Appeals and also denoting the Presiding 
Judge) or the names of the Supreme Court justices deciding the case (if not heard en banc) 
are listed. When denoting a judge who has retired or resigned, a judge’s designation will 
reflect	the	status	of	the	judge	at	the	time	the	opinion	issues.

 

7 

K.  Opinion Author(s)

1. 

Signed Opinions

The author’s name is listed in uppercase. When there is a concurring 

 
or dissenting opinion, the name of its author is listed on the title page after the 
decision line (e.g., Smith, J., dissenting.). Each opinion is arranged in this order: 
majority; concurring (the authoring justice / judge wishes to write separately, 
but agrees with both the result and rationale of the majority opinion); specially 
concurring (the authoring justice / judge wishes to write separately and agrees 
with the result, but not the rationale, of the majority opinion); concurring in part, 
dissenting in part; and dissenting (the authoring justice / judge disagrees with the 
result	of	the	majority	opinion).	If	two	or	more	justices	/	judges	file	a	concurring	or	
dissenting	opinion,	then	the	more	senior	justice’s	/	judge’s	opinion	goes	first.	See, 
e.g., State v. Dameron, 316 Or 448, 853 P2d 1285 (1993) (for order of opinions). 

When there is a nonparticipating justice in the Supreme Court, that justice’s 

 
name is footnoted on the title page of the opinion.

2. 

Per Curiam Opinions

An opinion that summarily disposes of the case may be designated as Per 

 
Curiam. The Per Curiam designation is also used for all lawyer discipline, Bar 
admission,	and	judicial	fitness	matters	before	the	Supreme	Court.

3.	

Affirmed	By	An	Equally	Divided	Court

 
In rare circumstances, the court may be split evenly regarding the 
disposition	of	a	case,	in	which	event	the	case	is	deemed	to	be	affirmed,	although	
no signed majority opinion is issued.

L. 

Disposition of Case

 
A brief statement of the court’s holding. This holding is repeated as the last line 
(set out as a separate paragraph) in the body of the opinion and is referred to as the “tag 
line.” The tag line serves as the court’s formal disposition of the case and also serves as 
further instruction to the lower tribunal(s).

M.  Designation of Prevailing Party and Award of Costs

The last part of a Supreme Court or Court of Appeals title page denotes the 

 
prevailing party and whether, and to whom, the court allows costs.

 

8 

II. Body of Opinion

In General

Both	custom	and	tradition	influence	the	content	and	format	of	appellate	opinions,	
	
as does the individual writing style of each judge. It is not the intent here to dictate that 
style, but to list standard conventions often used to organize opinions. In describing the 
elements of a typical opinion, our purpose is to give the reader a better understanding of 
appellate opinions.

Due to the scrutiny to which a published appellate opinion is subjected, the court’s 

 
discussion, analysis, and holding need to be expressed clearly, succinctly, and carefully. 
An opinion is crafted to inform the reader of the legal issues presented, discuss the facts, 
explain	the	court’s	analysis,	and	conclude	with	the	court’s	final	disposition	of	the	case.	
Because overly long sentences and paragraphs tend to appear formidable, all attempts are 
made to present the appellate opinion as straightforwardly as possible. Because appellate 
opinions are formal documents, contractions are used only when quoting from a source in 
which they appear.

Remember, these are general guidelines only, which means that there always will 

 
be exceptions. The requirements of an individual case may demand deviation from the 
norms here listed.

 

9 

A.  General Format

1. 

 Initial Paragraph–Introduction to the Case

The opinion begins by restating the name of the authoring judge or justice 
 
or	by	using	the	Per	Curiam	designation	in	uppercase,	set	out	separately	as	the	first	
line. The introductory paragraph sets out the general nature of the case, which 
includes the results in any lower tribunal(s), the main issues on appeal / review, and 
the	final	disposition	of	the	court.	That	provides	the	framework	for	the	details	that	
follow.

To the extent possible, the opinion refers to parties by their lower 

 
tribunal(s) designations, e.g.,	plaintiff,	defendant,	claimant,	etc.	Exceptions	include	
the following: (1) domestic relations cases, in which the parties are referred to as 
“husband” and “wife”; (2) civil commitment proceedings, in which the person 
for whom commitment is sought is referred to by his or her position on appeal 
(appellant, respondent); (3) termination of parental rights proceedings, in which 
the parents are referred to as “mother” and “father,” and the children are referred 
to as “child” or “children” or sometimes by initials. The proper names of victims 
are not used. See page 103 for further discussion.

When citing a concurring or dissenting opinion, the author’s last name is 

 
used. When a dissenting or concurring opinion refers to the majority opinion, the 
majority opinion is referred to as such, not by its author.

If a party has a long name, a shortened version is usually developed for 

 
use in subsequent references, e.g., First Security Bank of the Northwest may be 
referred to simply as “First Security” or “bank.”

2. 

Statement of Facts 

The pertinent facts of a case are set out in a concise and objective manner. 
 
Those facts can be organized in patterns, e.g., chronologically or geographically, 
or by issue, witness, or actor. If an issue is complex, the facts may be set out in 
general here and then in more detail when discussing the issue to which they 
relate.

3. 

Discussion of Issues 

The opinion then addresses the dispositive issue(s) in a manner appropriate 

 
to the circumstances of the case. One approach is to state the parties’ positions, 
either in the order in which they were raised below, discussed in the briefs, 
or dictated by circumstance; respond to those arguments; and then provide an 

 

10 

explanation for the result reached by stating the authorities relied on. Simply 
stated, the discussion states the issue, how it is resolved on the facts of the case 
with	citation	to	relevant	authority,	and	the	effect	of	the	resolution.

4. 

Disposition of Case

The	final	paragraph	states	the	result	and	gives	instructions	when	necessary.	

	
The conclusion is followed by the tag line, a separate paragraph that sets out the 
court’s	final	ruling	and	serves	as	further	instruction	to	the	lower	tribunal(s).

B.	

Structural	Tools

If a case is complex, then the authoring judge may decide to divide the opinion 

 
into designated parts and label them to identify for the reader the discussion of the case. 
That is accomplished by using the methods discussed below.

1. 

Paragraph or Section Headings

a. 

Format

(1)  Headings

An author may decide to use principal divisions within an 

 
opinion. When used, headings for those divisions are centered 
and set out in uppercase letters. Roman numerals are not used if 
subheads are omitted.

(2)  Outline Method

If dividing and labeling an opinion into sections and 

 
subsections, then the standard outline format is used as set out 
below. Standard outline rules apply, e.g., if there is a heading 
designated I., then there must be a II., if there is a subheading A., 
then	there	must	be	a	B.,	etc.	Initial	caps	are	used	in	the	first	level	
of subheadings (on all words except articles, prepositions, and 
conjunctions) unless the subheading reads as a complete sentence. 
Each new level of subheading starts at a new level of indentation, 
with an indent following the number or letter.

 

The levels of outlining are referred to as follows:

Headings (indicated by Roman numerals)
Subheadings (indicated by uppercase letters)
Paragraphs (indicated by numerals)
Subparagraphs (indicated by lower case letters)
Subsubparagraphs (indicated by numbers within parentheses)

 

11 

I.  HEADING (centered, uppercase, no italic or boldface font, 
if there are no subheadings, then do not number headings)

  A. 

Subheading Example with Initial Uppercase

 
Set	subheading	flush	left,	beginning	with	nonitalicized	alpha	character	“A.”	Indent	
after alpha character, followed by italicized subheading. If subheading is not a sentence, 
then use initial uppercase, but if subheading is a sentence, then use a period and no 
initial	uppercase	after	the	first	word.

Paragraph heading is indented and italicized (do not use initial uppercase 
after	the	first	word;	use	a	period	only	if	a	sentence).

If there is a paragraph 1, then there must be a paragraph 2.

Subparagraph heading is indented twice, no italics.

If there is a subparagraph a, then there must be a subparagraph b.

(1) 

(2) 

Subsubparagraph heading is indented yet again, no italics.

If there is a subsubparagraph (1), then there must be a 
subsubparagraph (2).

1. 

2. 

a. 

b. 

  B. 

This is an example of a subheading that does not require initial uppercase but does 
use a period, because it is a sentence.

If there is a subheading A, then there must be a subheading B.  Paragraphs that 

 
follow	any	of	these	headings	are	formatted	like	this	one,	flush	left	with	a	first-line	indent.

NOTE:  With regard to case names in subheadings, if the opinion subheadings 
only	involve	the	first	scenario	(see	below),	italicize	the	case	name,	which	reads	
better to the reader. But, if the opinion subheadings have both scenarios (or 
only the second one), then format as follows, for internal consistency:

  
 

A.  State v. Baker
B.  State v. Jones and its Progeny

b. 

Bulleted or Numbered Lists 

It may be more clear to organize certain text, e.g., events, dates, 
 
testimony, etc., using a bulleted or numbered list. The bulleted list generally 
is	indented.	The	use	of	bullets	can	help	to	differentiate	items	in	a	list	that	
need no particular order, e.g.,

•  Car of little or no value

•  Boat valued at $10,000

• 
 

Personal jewelry that is valued at more than $5,000, but less than 
$10,000, and similar items.

 

12 

 
Numbered lists, with each numeral appearing inside a set of paren-
theses, help to organize and display information to show relationship, e.g.,

Defendant argues as follows: (1) the trial court erred; (2) the error was 
not harmless; and (3) his conviction should be reversed.

See pages 87 to 88 for further discussion regarding the proper 

 
structure for numbered lists.

2. 

Quotations

When construing a statute or administrative rule, for example, the author 

 
generally quotes the pertinent text. The purpose of quotation is to provide the 
reader with the information necessary to understand the court’s discussion of the 
issues and the law governing its analysis. The proper format for quoted material is 
discussed in the Citation and Quotation sections.

3. 

Footnotes

a. 

In General

Footnotes document sources of information or make ancillary 
 
references. Substantive information is best addressed within the body of the 
opinion. Footnote text begins on the same line as the superscripted footnote 
number, except when the footnote begins with a block quotation.

b. 

Citations in Footnotes

When citing a case in a footnote and the case has not previously been 

 
cited (in text or footnote), use the full case citation. If the case has already 
been cited (in text or footnote), then use a short citation. (Note that, if a case 
is	cited	for	the	first	time	in	a	footnote,	then	the	first	subsequent	citation	to	
that case in the text must also be a full citation. See pages 20 and 25.)

c. 

Referencing to and Setting Out Footnoted Text Within Body of Opinion

 
Footnote numbers, where applicable, are placed after periods, 
commas, colons, semicolons, and quotation marks. Footnote numbers also 
are placed after a closing parenthesis, unless the footnote refers to material 
inside the parentheses. Footnote numbers inserted within quoted material 
are set out using superscripted brackets.

4.  Maps / Pictures / Appendices

 
It may be necessary to include graphic information to convey a more clear 
understanding of the issue(s). In that event, a photograph, map, or chart is either 
appended to the opinion or inserted within the text where applicable. When included, 
an	appendix	is	usually	first	described	in	narrative	form.	The	appendix	typically	
begins on a separate page at the end of the opinion with the heading “Appendix.”

 

13 

C.  Writing Tools

1. 

Fonts

a. 

Italics and Underscoring

Italic typeface is used within opinions to denote case names, to set 

 
out introductory signals, to indicate and less common foreign terminology, 
and to supply emphasis. See examples listed on page 67. Excessive use of 
italics for emphasis is discouraged.

Underscoring is used only in quotations when the original source 

 
used underscoring for emphasis or headings and the like.

b. 

Boldface and Uppercase

 
It is best to avoid using a variety of styles and fonts within an 
opinion. Use of boldface or all uppercase letters in text is discouraged as a 
distraction	to	the	reader.	Italic	type	generally	is	sufficient	to	show	emphasis.	
Avoid using UPPERCASE BOLDFACE ITALIC, as	it	is	difficult	to	read.

2.  Make Smooth Transitions

When turning to a new issue or argument within an opinion, use 
 
introductory sentences or paragraphs to indicate transition between discussions. 
Use signal words to connect thoughts back to a preceding point or ahead to the 
next one, e.g., further, however, consequently, etc. Explore one idea per paragraph, 
relating each sentence to that central idea.

In General

CITATION

In legal citation, it is paramount to cite authorities in a clear and concise manner, 

 
thereby enabling the reader to locate those sources. Within this Style Manual, we have 
endeavored to include citation examples of sources often cited within the framework of 
appellate opinions. When citing an authority not discussed here, follow the format of like 
material.

Citations	should	be	made	to	official	print	sources	whenever	possible.	If	there	is	no	
	
official	printed	version	or	if	it	is	difficult	to	obtain,	or	the	publishing	entity	has	designated	
an	electronic	source	as	the	official	version,	then	citation	to	that	source	should	follow	the	
format (as closely as possible) as described within this manual.

 

15 

I. Organization and Arrangement

A. 

The Bluebook

The appellate courts generally follow the citation practices set out in the most 
 
current version of The Harvard Law Review Association’s The Bluebook, A Uniform 
System of Citation, except as noted in this Style Manual. The Bluebook is used as the 
default source for citation questions not addressed here.

B.	

Consistency	of	Citations

If	you	cannot	find	a	specific	rule	that	addresses	your	particular	citation	situation,	

	
then cite the authority in a clear, sensible manner that will convey the information needed 
to	find	the	cited	authority.	Consistency	within	a	particular	document	is	important	to	avoid	
distracting and confusing the reader.

 
In subsequent case history, if all the decisions in one case take place during the 
same year, then place the date (year) once at the end of the entire citation. However, if 
the decisions span more than one year, then place all years in the appropriate places, as 
shown in the examples. See, e.g., pages 23 to 24.

Standard references used for prior or subsequent case history in citations are as 

 
follows:

 
 

	
 
 
 
 

Acceptable	Abbreviations:	
adh’d to on recons (adhered) 
aff’d (affirmed)   
cert (certiorari)  
cert den (certiorari denied) 
recons (reconsideration; not recon) 
reh’g (rehearing) 
 
rem’d (remanded) 
 
rev’d (reversed)  
 
rev (revised) 
 
 
rev den (review denied)  
vac’d (vacated)   
 
writ den (writ of mandamus denied)

 
 
 
 
 
 

	
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Terms	Not	Abbreviated:
allowed (not all)
appeal dismissed
as improvidently allowed
compiled as a note after
decision by order
dismissed (not dism)
modified (not mod)
overruled on other grounds

C. 

Case Names

 
When citing Oregon appellate cases, DO NOT use the title page, a regional 
reporter,	Premise,	Westlaw,	or	LEXIS	as	a	source	for	the	official	case	name.	Use	the	case	

 

16 

name	exactly	as	published	in	the	official	state	reporter,	located	at	the	top	of	either	the	
odd- or even-numbered pages. In the Oregon Reports and the Oregon Appellate Courts 
Advance Sheets, the case name appears on the even-numbered pages. If citing a case 
from	a	jurisdiction	that	does	not	have	its	own	separate	official	reporter	or	if	you	do	not	
have	access	to	the	official	reports,	then	use	the	case	name	as	used	in	the	regional	reporter	
or follow the naming conventions as set out in The Bluebook when using online services. 
Cases	that	are	Affirmed	Without	Opinion	are	listed	in	tables	using	their	full	case	titles.	In	
the event that such a case needs to be cited using a shortened case name, please contact 
the Publications Program for the correct case name if it is not easily discernible. 

In older bound volumes of the Oregon Reports, case names are shown with small 

 
uppercase letters. Replace those with ordinary Roman type for citation purposes. Also 
in older volumes, running heads are sometimes shown using et al., et ux., or et vir. to 
indicate additional parties. For purposes of consistency when citing such cases, those 
abbreviations should be included, as well as their punctuation.

D.	

Spaces	and	Abbreviations	of	Citations

 
Generally, spaces in citations are used to separate longer abbreviations, e.g., 
S Ct, F Supp, L Ed 2d, Or L Rev, Tex App, etc. A space is not necessary between adjacent 
single uppercase letters or numerals and ordinals that are treated as single uppercase 
letters, e.g., P3d, NE2d, NYS2d, but insert a space before any abbreviation containing 
two or more letters, e.g., So 2d. Periods are not used after abbreviations, except when 
quoting material in which they are included.

E. 

String Citations

 
When using string citations, follow The Bluebook format for the order of 
authorities, i.e., (1) cases decided by the same court, or by all federal circuit courts of 
appeals or federal district courts, are arranged in reverse chronological order; and 
(2)	different	courts	generally	are	set	out	by	rank.	Use	a	semicolon,	not	a	comma	or	the	
word “and,” to separate citations within a string.

F. 

Signals

Introductory signals are used to indicate the level of support to be found in a 

 
citation, suggest comparison, indicate contradiction, or indicate background material. 
When using a signal, it is important to recognize the intent of the signal. Some signals 
indicate support: e.g., see, see also, accord, cf.; others comparison: compare (using the 
construction compare and or compare with); or contradiction: contra, but see, but cf.; 

 

17 

and background: see generally. Like signals are grouped into a single citation sentence, 
separated by a semicolon.

The courts generally follow The Bluebook regarding the appropriate use of signals, 

 
i.e., the meaning of each signal, order of signals, order of authorities within signals, 
and parentheticals with signals. When using signals, the courts typically include a 
parenthetical	explanation	briefly	describing	the	relevance	of	the	authority	cited,	e.g.,

Cf. State v. Brown, 300 Or 125, 130, 860 P2d 498 (1985) (hearsay inadmissible at trial).

See, e.g., OEC 401 (regarding relevancy of evidence).

School Dist. 1, Mult. Co. v. Bingham et al., 204 Or 601, 611, 283 P2d 670, modified on 
reh’g, 204 Or 606, 284 P2d 779 (1955) (when interpreting Oregon Constitution, court 
must assume that every word, clause, and sentence therein inserted for some useful 
purpose).

NOTE: No signal is needed when the cited authority directly states the 
proposition; in some situations, it still may be advisable to include a parenthetical 
explanation, even if no signal is used. Also, note that the internal comma within a 
signal is italicized.

G.	

Parenthetical	Information

Parenthetical explanations are added as needed to describe the relevance of an 

 
authority that is cited in the text. Although not mandatory, often that information is 
helpful	for	clarification.	A	parenthetical	statement	can	consist	of	quoted	material	or	a	
brief statement. When including a parenthetical explanation in a case with citations 
to subsequent history, place the explanation following all the subsequent case history. 
Quoted statements that read as a complete sentence should include an initial uppercase 
letter and period (with brackets and / or an ellipsis, if appropriate), but other material that 
reads as a sentence does not receive an initial uppercase letter or a period, e.g.,

Old v. Navy, 555 Or App 444, 447, 222 P3d 888 (2015) (“[An] award of ‘reasonable’ 
attorney fees does not preclude the use of a multiplier or other fee enhancement *  *  *. 
Such an enhancement may be applied at the beginning of the calculation process.”).

Aber v. Crombie, 123 Or 234, 236, 456 P3d 678 (2015) (the constitution does not pro-
vide that shirts have to be “button down”).

See,  e.g.,  People  v.  Vasquez,  148  P3d  326,  330  (Colo  Ct  App  2006),  rev  den,  No 
06SC556, 2006 WL 3404625 (Colo, Nov 27, 2006) (“Because the reasonable person 
standard requires a ‘defendant [to] appraise the situation as would a reasonable sober 

 

18 

[person],’	evidence	of	voluntary	intoxication	is	irrelevant	to	the	defendant’s	affirmative	
defense of self-defense.” (Quoting LaFave, 2 Substantive Criminal Law § 9.5(d) at 51 
(emphasis in LaFave; brackets in Vasquez).)).

 

More examples of parenthetical phrases can be found on pages 57 to 58.

A.  Oregon–Full Citations

II. Case Law

When	citing	a	case	for	the	first	time	in	the	text	of	an	opinion	(majority,	concurring,	

	
or dissenting) use the full case citation. (If the case has previously been cited in full in a 
footnote,	then	the	first	textual	citation	to	the	case	should	still	be	a	full	citation.)	See	page	
13.

 
The basic citation format for a full case citation includes these elements, in this 
order:	name	of	the	case	(using	the	official	running	head);	volume,	abbreviated	name	of	
the	official	reporter,	and	beginning	page	number	of	the	case;	parallel	citation	to	regional	
reporter; parenthetical indicating year case was decided; subsequent history; and any 
other pertinent parenthetical information.

1. 

Supreme Court

PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, 317 Or 606, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). 

NOTE: Oregon Supreme Court cases issued before 1888 have no parallel 
citations.

 

On rehearing

Older Oregon cases with separate “rehearing” decisions have one Oregon 

 
citation (because the rehearing decision was published immediately after the initial 
decision), but two West citations. For those cases, the year shown in the published 
case name at the top of the odd- or even-numbered pages is the year that a decision  
on	rehearing	was	issued,	not	the	year	that	the	case	initially	was	decided	(if	different). 
Citation to such cases depends on whether you are citing to the original decision or 
the decision on rehearing.

If citing the initial decision, include the date of that decision, then include 

 
the rehearing information as subsequent history:

State v. Laundy, 103 Or 443, 455, 204 P 958 (1921), reh’g den, 103 Or 503, 
206 P 290 (1922). 

NOTE: Opinion on the merits begins on page 443, but opinion on 
rehearing starts on page 503.

 

20 

 

 

 

 

If citing the rehearing decision, then cite both decisions, with the rehearing 

 
year and a “rehearing” indicator:

State v. Laundy, 103 Or 443, 503, 206 P 290 (1922) (on rehearing).

On reconsideration (specify disposition):

Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Tualatin Tire & Auto, 322 Or 406, 908 P2d 300 
(1995), modified on recons, 325 Or 46, 932 P2d 1141 (1997).

NOTE: If citing only the case on reconsideration, it is not necessary to include the 
earlier case citation, e.g., Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Tualatin Tire & Auto, 
325 Or 46, 932 P2d 1141 (1997).

Overruled by subsequent Oregon case:

Rose v. Port of Portland, 82 Or 541, 552, 162 P 498 (1917), overruled in part 
on other grounds by State ex rel Heinig v. Milwaukie et al, 231 Or 473, 479, 
373 P2d 680 (1962).

Rejected by subsequent Oregon case:

State  v.  Smith,  295  Or  200,  625  P2d  20  (1981),  rejected  in  part  by  State  v. 
Jones, 321 Or 100, 805 P2d 150 (1991).

(Other alternatives, such as, “abrogated by” and “questioned by,” can be 

 
 
used as appropriate.)

Certiorari (or writ) denied by United States Supreme Court:

Dept. of Trans. v. Lundberg, 312 Or 568, 825 P2d 641, cert den, 506 US 975 
(1992).

Whitman v. United States, 904 F Supp 2d 363 (SDNY 2012), writ den, 574 US 
___, 135 S Ct 352 (2014).

NOTE: (1) Always include cert den, if applicable. (2) If certiorari is dismissed, 
use the same format as the above example, substituting “cert dismissed” for “cert 
den.” (3) Unless certiorari is denied or dismissed by opinion, parallel citations 
are not necessary for “cert den” or “cert dismissed” after they are published in the 
United States Reports.

 

21 

Certiorari granted by United States Supreme Court (include as much 

 
information as is available at the time that you are writing). These examples list 
earliest to latest sources:

State v. Ice, 343 Or 248, 70 P3d 1049, cert granted, __ US __, 76 USLW 3496 
(Mar 17, 2008).

State v. Ice, 343 Or 248, 70 P3d 1049, cert granted, __ US __, 128 S Ct 1657 
(2008).

State v. Ice, 343 Or 248, 70 P3d 1049, cert granted, 552 US 1256 (2008).

 

Supreme Court opinion reversed by United States Supreme Court:

Gilliam  County  v.  Dept.  of  Environmental  Quality,  316  Or  99,  849  P2d  500 
(1993), rev’d and rem’d sub nom Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of 
Environmental Quality of Ore., 511 US 93, 114 S Ct 1345, 128 L Ed 2d 13 (1994). 

Sub nom indicates that a different case name was used in subsequent 
 
history. Regarding changing case names, follow this rule: When the name of the 
case differs in prior or subsequent history, the new name must be given, except  
(1) when the parties’ names merely are reversed; (2) when the citation in which 
the difference occurs is to a denial of certiorari or rehearing; or (3) when, in the 
appeal of an administrative action, the name of the private party remains the same. 

Use the word “by” when referring to subsequent case history only if 

 
referring to an entirely different case, e.g.,

Keenan v. Norris-Lampe, 330 Or 456, 777 P2d 897 (1999), overruled on other 
grounds by Bennett v. Bauman, 333 Or 566, 790 P2d 654 (2001). 

Otherwise, use sub nom, as explained above, e.g.,

Smith v. Jones, 330 Or 456, 777 P2d 897 (1999), rev’d on other grounds sub nom 
Jones and White v. Smith, 668 US 123, 113 S Ct 1346, 129 L Ed 2d 14 (2001).

 

 

2. 

Court of Appeals

Precedential opinions:  

Lesch v. DeWitt, 118 Or App 397, 847 P2d 888 (1993). 

Nonprecedential memorandum opinions (cited in accordance with ORAP 
10.30):  

State v. Nord, 320 Or App 672 (2022) (nonprecedential memorandum opinion).

NOTE: Because the parenthetical included in nonprecedential 
memorandum opinions concerns weight of authority, it precedes any 
subsequent history, such as opinions on reconsideration or the denial 
of review by the Supreme Court, e.g., Party v. Party, 320 Or App 486 
(nonprecedential memorandum opinion), rev den, 370 Or 56 (2022).

 

22 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Overruled by subsequent Oregon case:

Eklund v. Clackamas County, 36 Or App 73, 583 P2d 567 (1978), overruled on 
other grounds by Forman v. Clatsop County, 63 Or App 617, 665 P2d 365 (1983).

Supreme Court review denied:

Allred v. Board of Parole, 124 Or App 278, 862 P2d 546 (1993), rev den, 318 
Or 325 (1994).

More than one petition for review denied:

Allred v. Board of Parole, 124 Or App 278, 862 P2d 546 (1993), rev den, 318 
Or 325; 318 Or 502 (1994).

NOTE: (1) Always include rev den and cert den, if applicable. (2) Unless the 
review denied or certiorari denied citation is not available or there is an opinion 
denying review or certiorari, parallel citations are not necessary. (3) Before 1976, 
disposition of petitions for review were not published; accordingly, only the year 
and disposition are indicated, e.g., State v. Smith, 14 Or App 72 (1973), rev den 
(1974). (4) When a petition for review has been filed in a case, but not yet acted 
on, the current practice of the appellate courts is NOT to show that review is 
pending. However, practitioners may want to do so when writing a brief. 

Supreme Court review allowed, but case not yet decided:

Lesch v. DeWitt, 118 Or App 397, 847 P2d 888, rev allowed, 317 Or 162 (1993).

Supreme Court review allowed, then later dismissed:

Finch v. Andrews, 124 Or App 558, 863 P2d 496, rev dismissed, 320 Or 267 (1994). 

NOTE: If applicable, it is optional to include “as improvidently allowed” 
after “rev dismissed.”

Court of Appeals decision affirmed by Supreme Court:

State v. McCoy, 17 Or App 155, 521 P2d 1074, aff’d, 270 Or 340, 527 P2d 725 (1974).

Court of Appeals decision reversed by Supreme Court:

State v. Cloutier, 33 Or App 121, 575 P2d 996, rev’d on other grounds, 286 Or 
579, 596 P2d 278 (1979).

Court of Appeals decision remanded by Supreme Court: 

State v. White, 59 Or App 61, 650 P2d 184 (1982), rem’d, 297 Or 302, 685 P2d 
983 (1984).

NOTE: Whether to include “on other grounds” in subsequent history to the Court 
of Appeals opinion depends on the proposition for which the case is being cited.

 

Court of Appeals decision vacated by unpublished order:

Davis  v.  Johnson,  155  Or App  266,  958  P2d  907  (1998),  decision  vac’d  by

den, 528 US 1136 (2000).

If certiorari is dismissed, use the same format as the above example, 

 
substituting “cert dismissed” for “cert den.”

 

Certiorari denied by opinion by United States Supreme Court:

State v. Smith, 30 Or App 462, 575 P2d 369, rev den, 282 Or 823 (1978), cert

B. 

Oregon–Short Citations and Other Issues

1. 

In General

When citing a case that has already been cited in the text of an opinion, use 

 
a short citation. However, if the only previous citation to a case is in a footnote, 
use	the	full	citation	the	first	time	the	case	is	cited	in	the	text.	See	page	13.

 

25 

When using a shortened case name in a short citation, the shortened case 

 
name	is	the	first	nongovernmental	party	appearing	in	the	official	case	name	
citation, e.g.,

State v. Bates,	304	Or	519,	747	P2d	991	(1987).	(full	citation,	first	reference)

Short citation form is [shortened case name], [volume number] [reporter] at 

 
[page], e.g.,

Bates, 304 Or at 522 (eliminating the parallel citation).

	
When	citing	a	specific	page	when	the	case	name	is	used	in	the	sentence	
being cited, or if there otherwise is no doubt as to the case being cited, the case 
name may be omitted from the citation, e.g., 

In Bates,	this	court	stated	that	the	officers	violated	defendant’s	constitutional	
rights by instructing him to move bag into view. 304 Or at 527.

or

In Bates, this court addressed a similar issue. The court held that, by order-
ing defendant to move the bag, the police violated defendant’s constitutional 
rights. 304 Or at 527.

Otherwise, include the shortened case name with the citation:

This	court	held	that	the	officers	violated	defendant’s	constitutional	rights	by	
instructing him to move the bag into view. Bates, 304 Or at 527.

NOTE:	Even	when	a	governmental	official	is	individually	named,	use	the	
first	nongovernmental	party	appearing	in	the	official	case	name	citation	for	the	
shortened case name.

2. 

Variations on Case Name

If a shortened case name causes confusion, such as if two cases with similar 

 
names have been cited within the same opinion, then use the full case name for 
each throughout the opinion, e.g.,

State v. Bates
Bates v. Smith

 

26 

When both parties have the same last name, as in some domestic relations 

 
matters, e.g., Smith and Smith, use Smith as the short cite.

Additionally, an explanation might need to be added for clarity, such as a 

 
modified	case	name	in	parentheses,	if	there	are	related	cases	in	a	series,	e.g.,

The accused has a disciplinary record, having been suspended twice from the 
practice of law. See In re Wyllie, 326 Or 447, 952 P2d 550 (1998) (Wyllie I) 
(one-year  suspension  for  refusing  to  comply  with  remedial  program);  In  re 
Wyllie, 327 Or 175, 957 P2d 1222 (1998) (Wyllie II ) (two-year suspension for 
misrepresenting compliance with MCLE requirements and failing to cooper-
ate). In Wyllie I, *  *  *

or

The	Court	of	Appeals	affirmed	the	tort	judgment,	concluding	that	it	was	unneces-
sary to resolve the breach of contract counterclaim. Northwest Natural Gas Co. v. 
Chase Gardens, Inc., 146 Or App 249, 933 P2d 370 (1997) (Chase I ). This court 
allowed review in Chase I, reversed, and remanded for consideration of Chase’s 
contract claim. Northwest Natural Gas Co. v. Chase Gardens, Inc., 328 Or 487, 
982 P2d 1117 (1999) (Chase II ). On remand, the Court of Appeals, relying in 
large part on its earlier decision and this court’s decision in Chase II, concluded 
that  Chase’s  breach  of  contract  judgment  could  not  be  sustained.  Northwest 
Natural Gas Co. v. Chase Gardens, Inc., 164 Or App 763, 995 P2d 555 (2000) 
(Chase III ). We now reverse the Court of Appeals decision in Chase III.

In lawyer disciplinary cases, the shortened case name is the lawyer’s last 

 
name, without the In re designation, e.g.,

In re Jones, 326 Or 195, 951 P2d 149 (1997). (full citation form)

Jones, 326 Or at 198. (short citation form)

In mandamus cases initiated after 1997, the case name is the same as the 

 
case name of the proceeding in the lower court, and the judge’s name (if the case 
involves a circuit court judge action) does not appear in the title, e.g., State v. 
Foster. In older mandamus cases, the name of the judge whose action was being 
challenged was included in the title, together with a “State ex rel” designation; cite 
such cases as follows:

State  ex  rel  Huddleston  v.  Sawyer,  324  Or  597,  932  P2d  1145  (1997).  (full 
citation form)

Huddleston, 324 Or at 600. (short citation form)

NOTE: The appellate courts do not use “supra” as a substitute for short citations. 

 

27 

3. 

Citation to Series of Pages

 

When citing a series of pages, indicate the page numbers as follows:

Stranahan, 331 Or at 57-58.

Fugate, 332 Or at 202-03. (not 202-3)

Joslin, 332 Or at 499-501. (not 499-01)

4. 

Use of “id.” with Case Names

 
e.g.,

Id. at 525.

 
without the page number. 

When citing the immediately preceding authority, it is acceptable to use id., 

If citing the same page of the immediately preceding authority, then use id. 

CAUTION: Do not use id. where there is an intervening citation to another 
authority (be it a case name, statute, or some other authority). When there is an 
intervening textual reference, use id. only when there is no danger of ambiguity. 

5. 

Citation to Footnote

Trenary, 114 Or App at 610 n 2. (short citation form)

 

When citing a series of footnotes, indicate the page numbers as follows:

State v. Trenary, 114 Or App 608, 610 nn 3-5, 836 P2d 739 (1992).

State v. Trenary, 114 Or App 608, 610 n 3, 611 nn 4 & 5, 836 P2d 739 (1992).

NOTE: Citation	is	to	the	first	page	on	which	the	footnote	appears,	even	if	it	spans	
more than one page, no matter where the pertinent text actually appears.

When citing text contained in the body of the opinion and also in a footnote 

 
set out on the same page, set out the page number twice, e.g.,

or

Trenary, 114 Or App at 610, 610 n 2.

Trenary, 114 Or App at 610 & n 2.

Internal Citations; Dissents; Concurrences

The majority cites a dissenting or concurring opinion in all references 

 
(regardless of the number of dissenting or concurring opinions) as follows: 

The dissent contends that the statute operates prospectively only. ___ Or App 
at ___ (Smith, J., dissenting) (slip op at 3).

A dissent or concurrence cites the majority opinion as follows (do not 

 
include the case name):

The majority concludes that the statute operates retroactively. ___ Or App at 
___ (slip op at 7).

 

A dissent or concurrence cites itself as follows:

As noted above, I dissent because I disagree with the majority’s statutory con-
struction and conclusion. ___ Or App at ___ (Smith, J., dissenting) (slip op at 1).

NOTE: Do not use supra or infra and do not use only “See note 6” when referring 
to earlier or later parts of an opinion (be it majority, concurring, or dissenting); 
instead, use the short citation. For example, a majority internal citation is set out as:

As	noted,	ORS	813.010	prohibits	driving	under	the	influence	of	intoxicants.	
See ___ Or App at ___ n 6 (slip op at 4 n 6).

Possessive Endings on Case Names

When a name of a case takes a possessive ending, the “ 's ” is not italicized, 

 
e.g.,

Federal	Jurisdictions

For United States Supreme Court cases, the case name for citation purposes 
 
is taken from the case name citation in the United States Reports (US), if available 
(which appears on the odd-numbered pages); otherwise, use the case name citation 
from	an	alternative	reporter.	(Note	that	the	case	name	citations	frequently	differ	in	those	

 

29 

publications.) The short citation also is to the US Reports, if available; otherwise, cite 
the Supreme Court reports, if available, if not, then cite the Lawyer’s Edition. (Note that 
some material within the text of the Court’s opinions, such as citations and quotations, 
often varies between publications.) If the US Reports citation is not available, insert 
“___ US ___” (including a blank for a jump / pinpoint) citation, if applicable) in all 
full and short citations, before the citation to an alternative reporter.

Federal Tax Cases

The order of authority for federal tax cases is (1) the United States Supreme 

 
Court; (2) federal courts of appeals; (3) federal district courts; and (4) the United 
States Tax Court. Federal tax cases from the United States Supreme Court, United 
States Court of Appeals, Court of Federal Claims, and United States District Court 
are combined and bound as “U.S. Tax Cases”; therefore, the best citation will 
contain both the federal and parallel citations. For example,

Furlow, Jr. v. U.S., 55 F Supp 2d 360, 2000-1 US Tax Cas (CCH) ¶ 50,684 (D 
Md 1999). 

NOTE: “U.S. Tax Cases” often is abbreviated as “USTC,” but that is not the 
formal citation.

States Other Than Oregon 

NOTE: For abbreviations of state and regional reporters, see The Bluebook.

For	states	other	than	Oregon,	cite	the	official	reporter	first,	then	add	the	regional	

	
reporter	when	using	jump	/	pinpoint	citations	because	that	benefits	readers	who	have	
access to only regional reporters, e.g.,

In Statser v. Statser, 205 Okla 608, 611, 239 P2d 764, 766 (1951), the court stated:

“[T]he terms of the condition are directed to defendant’s granting or withhold-
ing permission; the condition does not purport to authorize police action.”

 

31 

The court continued:

Id. at 615, 239 P2d at 768.

 
“Defendant, of course, may argue that the safeguard for employees 
exceeds the ordinary standard of due care considering the nature of the risk 
and the foreseeability of injury.”

NOTE: The appellate courts accept practitioners’ submissions jump / pinpoint citing only 
regional reporters except when citing Oregon appellate decisions.

For cases not yet appearing in publication, it is acceptable to use a citation to 

 
Westlaw, e.g., 

State v. Smith, No 26245-2-II, 2013 WL 651868 at *2 (Wash App Div 2, Apr 19, 2013).

When	the	official	reporter	(i.e., the state reporter) is the same for both the highest 

	
court and the intermediate appellate court, include the court abbreviation in the date 
parenthetical, e.g.,

State v. Gray, 231 Ariz 374, 295 P3d 951 (Ariz Ct App 2013).

When	the	official	reporter	is	the	regional	reporter,	include	the	court	abbreviation	in	

	
the date parenthetical, e.g.,

Golphin v. State, 945 So 2d 1174 (Fla 2006).

General Laws of Oregon and Other Older Statutory Compilations

Some of these compilations are organized by chapters, which incorporate 

 
several titles, and others are organized by titles, which incorporate several chapters. 
It is advisable to include page numbers when citing the Deady compilations, 
because the various codes are not numbered and there are no indices or general 
tables of contents to guide the reader to the proper location regarding particular 

 

34 

sections of a code (e.g., Criminal Code, Civil Code, etc., each of which is made up 
of multiple chapters). Some older cases incorporate neither chapters nor titles; for 
such codes, cite to the applicable section and page numbers.

citations.

ORS 161.155(1)(a)(A). [chapter 161][section 155][subsection (1)][paragraph 
(a)][subparagraph (A)]

Numbered paragraphs within a section are referred to as subsections, 

 
lettered paragraphs as paragraphs. For example, ORS 305.220(1)(a) would be 
referred to in text individually as paragraph (a) of subsection (1), when referring to 
(1)(a) collectively, use paragraph (1)(a).

ORS 250.035(2)(a), (b). (when citing two parts of the same statute)

NOTE: When citing a sequence of statutes in citation, do not use “et seq.”; 
instead,	set	out	the	first	and	last	statutes	of	the	sequence.

c. 

Repealed or Renumbered Statute Examples

When citing a repealed or renumbered ORS (or OAR), the narrative 

 
and citation forms are the same. The word former is set in italics. Only a 
repealed or renumbered statute, not an amended statute, is referred to as 
“former.”

Former ORS 19.023(2)(a) (1995), renumbered as ORS 19.205(2)(a) 
(1997).	 (first	 reference;	 “1995”	 will	 usually	 refer	 to	 the	 year	 of	 the	
statute	 in	 effect	 when	 the	 facts	 of	 the	 case	 occurred	 (although	 the	
author	may	make	a	different	choice,	depending	on	context);	“1997”	
refers to year that the statute was renumbered) 

Former ORS 19.023(2)(a) (1995). (subsequent reference)

Former ORS 736.317 (1961), repealed by Or Laws 1967, ch 482, § 1. 
(first	reference)

Former ORS 736.317 (1961). (subsequent reference)

 

36 

When a statute has been renumbered or repealed, the author should 

 
cite	the	version	in	effect	at	the	time	of	the	events	in	the	case,	including	
subsequent	history	on	the	first	reference	and	then	including	the	year	of	that	
version in subsequent references.

d. 

Amended Statute Examples

ORS 308.370 - 308.375 (1987), amended by Or Laws 1991, ch 459, 
§§	117-120.	(citation	form,	first	reference)

ORS 308.370 - 308.375 (1987). (citation form, subsequent reference)

NOTE: (1) The above examples for amended statutes require inclusion of 
the year parenthetically at the end of all citations (separated by a space). 
However, it also is acceptable to include a footnote at the outset of the 
opinion, after citing the older statute in full, that explains that all statutory 
citations that follow are to a particular year. In that event, it is not necessary 
to include the parenthetical year in subsequent references. (2) When 
setting out ORS citations or other authorities, be consistent in the use of 
punctuation, e.g.,

The state appeals from a pretrial judgment dismissing an indictment 
that  charged  defendant  with  manufacture  of  a  controlled  substance, 
ORS  475.992(1);  delivery  of  a  controlled  substance  to  minor,  ORS 
475.999; and criminal conspiracy, ORS 161.450.

 
In general, when a statute has been amended, the author may: 
(1)	cite	the	version	in	effect	at	the	time	of	the	events	in	the	case;	or	(2)	cite	
the	current	version,	if	the	amendment	does	not	affect	the	issue	in	the	case.	
If	choosing	option	(1),	then	include	subsequent	history	on	the	first	reference	
and include the year of the version being cited on subsequent references. 
If	choosing	option	(2),	then	include	a	footnote	on	the	first	reference	that	
sets out the subsequent history and explains that the current version is being 
used	because	the	intervening	amendment	does	not	affect	the	analysis.	For	
example,

1  ORS  164.125  has  been  amended  since  defendant  committed  his 
crime;	however,	because	those	amendments	do	not	affect	our	analysis,	
we refer to the current version of the statute in this opinion.

 

37 

 
If a statute has been amended or renumbered more than once, then the best 
practice	is	to	include	the	full	subsequent	history	on	the	first	reference	or	at	least	in	
a footnote (example: cite all amendments, not just the one at issue).

6. 

Oregon Evidence Code (OEC) (ORS chapter 40)

Always use the abbreviated form (OEC) in both narrative references and 

 
citations	when	referring	to	or	citing	a	specific	rule.	Use	“Oregon	Evidence	Code”	
(not “OEC”) when referring to the code as a whole. Do not cite the ORS number, 
e.g.,

OEC 801(3).

OEC 103 Commentary (1981).

Legislative  Commentary  to  OEC  401,  reprinted  in  Laird  C.  Kirkpatrick, 
Oregon Evidence § 401.02, Art IV-4 (4th ed 2002).

Parts of the Oregon Evidence Code suggest that *  *  *. (narrative form)

 
When quoting the Oregon Evidence Code, or when quoting a statute 
that quotes the Oregon Evidence Code, replace any ORS reference with the 
corresponding OEC rule number in brackets, e.g.,

OEC 405(2)(a) provides:

“In all cases in which character or a trait of character of a

Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure (ORCP) 

Always use the abbreviated form (ORCP) in both narrative references and 

 
citations	when	referring	to	or	citing	a	specific	rule.	Use	“Oregon	Rules	of	Civil	
Procedure” (not “ORCPs”) when referring to the rules as a whole. Always add a 
space after the rule number when referring to a section of the rule, e.g.,

ORCP 71 B(1)(b)(i). [rule 71][section B][subsection (1)][paragraph (b)][sub-
paragraph (i)].

ORCP 7 C(3)(a) to (c). (narrative form, when citing a sequence)

ORCP 7 C(3)(a) - (c). (citation form, when citing a sequence)

of Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure (1/1/78 through 12/31/78), June 28, 1978, 
Draft and Proposed Comment to Rule 6, 33 (1979).

When citing the permanent comments to the enacted ORCPs, cite the 

 
Merrill handbook, i.e.:

R. Merrill, Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure: A Handbook 28-29 (1981).

8. 

Oregon Rules of Appellate Procedure (ORAP)

 
Always use the abbreviated form (ORAP) in both narrative references

18.  Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC), Bar Rules of Procedure (BR), and 

American Bar Association (ABA) Standards

NOTE: Do not use “RPC” or “RPCs” when speaking generally about the Rules of 
Professional Conduct; instead, cite the rules separately.

a. 

Rules of Professional Conduct

The  Bar’s  complaint  alleges  that  the  lawyer  violated  Rule  of  Profes-
sional  Conduct  (RPC)  8.4(a)(3)  (conduct  involving  dishonesty,  fraud, 
deceit,	or	misrepresentation).	(narrative	form,	first	reference	to	any	RPC)

The lawyer contends that he did not violate RPC 8.4(a)(3). (narrative 
form, subsequent RPC reference)

 

43 

The lawyer contends that he did not violate any rule of professional 
conduct.  (narrative form)

NOTE: The rule on pages 36 to 37 referring to the use of “former” with 
repealed and renumbered, but not amended, statutes, does not apply to 
rules of professional conduct. With rules of professional conduct, “former” 
is used to refer to amended, as well as repealed and renumbered, rules. If 
citing to a former rule, then include the year.

b. 

Bar Rules of Procedure

This is a reinstatement proceeding under Bar Rule of Procedure (BR) 
8.8.	(narrative	form,	first	reference	to	any	BR)

BR 10.1. (narrative form, subsequent reference; citation form)

c. 

ABA Standards

American Bar Association’s Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions 
(1991) (amended 1992) (ABA Standards), Standard 5.21. (narrative or 
citation	form,	first	reference)

ABA Standard 9.32(a). (narrative or citation forms, subsequent refer-
ence when citing a particular standard)

ABA Standards at 7. (citation form, subsequent reference when citing 
a particular page in the hardcopy manual)

ABA	Standards	at	7	(defining	“injury,”	in		part,		as		“harm		to		*	*	*		the		
profession”)	 (citation	 form	 for	 definitions	 appearing	 on	 a	 particular	
page in the hardcopy manual)

ABA  Standard  9.22(i)  (amended  1992).  (narrative  or  citation  form, 
subsequent  reference  when  citing  a  standard  contained  in  only  the 
1992 amendments)

NOTE: The copyright for the ABA Standards was updated in 2005, 
but the rules were not amended in 2005; therefore, the year for the 
amended version is 1992. The 1992 version is available online at https://
www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/professional_
responsibility/sanction_standards.pdf

19.  Briefs and Other Court Filings

The courts do not cite briefs in the instant case in their opinions; 

 
occasionally, however, an opinion might cite a brief in another case (for example, 
if	the	brief	expanded	on	a	legal	theory	that	the	court	had	addressed	only	briefly	

 

44 

in	that	other	case).	When	citing	a	brief	or	any	other	official	court	filing,	follow	
this format: Full name of the document, include the jump / pinpoint citation (if 
any), followed by the name of the case and its full citation (if rendered), and case 
number.

Appellant’s Opening Brief at 10, State v. Doyle, 213 Or App 456, 111 P3d 87 
(2007) (CA A123456).

If citing an event in a register of actions in the Oregon eCourt Case 

 
Information system (OECI, register of actions for Oregon circuit courts):

Motion for Stay, Filed May 1, 2014, State v. Adios (CR456789)

General Judgment, Entered June 15, 2015, State v. Adios (CR456789)

NOTE: Use the OECI “Created Date” for court-issued entries such as orders or 
judgments (date of entry); otherwise, use the date in the OECI Date column (date 
of	filing	of	a	received	filing).

IV.	Periodical	Articles,	Books,	Treatises,	Restatements,	Etc.

In General

Cite the author’s or editor’s full name as found on the title page of the source 

 
being cited. For books that are compiled and edited by a named editor, place the editor’s 
name where the author’s name would normally be, followed by “ed.” (including the 
period).

Cite	the	author’s	first	name	first.	If	there	are	up	to	three	authors,	then	list	them	all	

	
in	the	same	way.	If	four	or	more	authors	are	listed,	list	the	first	author	and	use	“et al.” 
For articles written by students, the author’s name is used (if available), along with, e.g., 
“Note,” “Comment,” or “Case Note.”

When citing multivolume sets, place the volume number of the book before the 
 
title, not before the author’s name. Include the edition and the year of the publication in 
parentheses at the end of the citation, e.g.,

Jacob Mertens, Jr., 8 Mertens Law of Federal Income Taxation § 32B:01 (rev 1999).

 

Use italics, not quotation marks, to indicate the name of a book, article, or treatise.

2. 

Short Citation Form for Periodical Articles

After an authority has been cited fully in the text, use the following short 

 
citation form for subsequent references to the same authority:

[Author’s last name], [Volume] [Periodical] at [page]:

Karlan, 93 Colum L Rev at 604.

NOTE:	To	determine	the	proper	abbreviation	for	periodicals,	first	check	the	
periodical itself to determine whether it provides for a particular citation form. If it 
does not, then follow The Bluebook abbreviations for periodicals. 

3. 

Volume and Issue Numbers 

Omit volume and issue numbers for newspapers and popular periodicals, 

 
because the numbers might not be easily found:

John Sedgwick, The Complexity Problem, The Atlantic 96 (Mar 1993).

NOTE: “Ed.” (with a period) refers to “editor”; “ed” (without a period) refers to 
“edition.”

In General

QUOTATION

Quotations must duplicate the original material, including spelling, use of 
 
uppercase, and formatting (e.g., indents and tabs). All punctuation is placed inside the 
quotation marks, with the exceptions of colons, semicolons, and question marks that do 
not appear in the original. Permissible changes are set out in this section.

Quoted material that contains 50 or more words is placed in block form. Quoted 

 
material that contains 49 or fewer words may be placed in block form for emphasis. 
Block quotations are single spaced, double indented, and enclosed within quotation 
marks.

In a narrative context, the citation (aside from the case title) may follow the 

 
quotation. For example, 

The petitioner included discussion from Smith v. Jones, where the court stated, 
 
“We don’t know what they were thinking.” 123 Or App 456, 460, 999 P3d 789 (2015). 
While mildly amusing, that did not further his argument.

Words	that	are	used	to	show	special	expression	or	give	special	effect,	such	as	slang	

	
words, words used in an ironic sense, philosophical terms, terms of art, etc., can be used 
within quotation marks. If the same phrase is used repeatedly, then those same quotation 
marks could become distracting, so an author should consider whether or not to repeat 
them.

I.	Citations,	Parenthetical	Phrases,	and	Footnotes

When setting out a block quotation, the citation and parenthetical phrases (if any) 

 
are	placed	flush	left	on	the	next	line	with	a	double	space	between	the	quotation	and	the	
citation, e.g., 

A.	

Placement

1. 

Citation

 
“Defendant,  of  course,  may  argue  that  the  safeguard  for 
employees exceeds the ordinary standard of due care considering 
the nature of the risk and the foreseeability of injury. The court 
may explain the governmentally prescribed safeguard to the jury 
in an instruction that the jury may consider the safeguard in deter-
mining whether the defendant exercised due care.”

Shahtout, 298 Or at 605-06.

2. 

Parenthetical Phrase

ORS 19.205(2)(a) provides, in part:

3. 

Order of Citations and Parentheticals

(Emphasis added.)

As stated in Welker,

“An	order	affecting	a	substantial right,	and	which	in	effect	deter-
mines the action *  *  *.”

“[t]his court has held that a motion is controlled by its substance, 
not	its	caption.	More	specifically,	this	court	has	held	that	a	motion	
was a motion for new trial although it was not denominated as such. 
Under  ORS  19.270(4)(a),  the  trial  court  must  have  intended  to 
enter	an	appealable	judgment	at	the	time	of	the	filing	of	the	notice	
of appeal.” 

332 Or at 313 (citations omitted).

4. 

Footnotes

The preferred method for quoting text that contains a footnote is to omit the 

 
footnote and indicate so by parenthetical, e.g.,

 

53 

“The	difficulty	with	that	argument	is	that	the	state	has	not	estab-
lished the requisite nexus between appellant’s mental illness and 
the potential substance abuse or failure to appreciate the risks of 
such abuse.”

State v. Linde, 179 Or App 553, 561, 32 P3d 78 (2002) (footnote omitted).

To retain a foonote within a blocked quotation, drop the quoted, blocked 

 
footnote under it, separated by a one-inch line, then proceed with new text (that is, 
do not set the quoted footnote as a new footnote at the bottom of the page), e.g.,

As  this  court  explained  in  Kambury  v.  DaimlerChrysler  Corp.,  173  Or App 
372, 387, 21 P3d 1089 (2001) (Edmonds, P. J., dissenting),

“[b]ut the question is one of Oregon law, not federal law, the federal 
court’s  decision  was  the  earlier  of  the  two,  and  it  is  the  Oregon 
court’s decision—not that of the Ninth Circuit—that is binding for 
purposes	of	the	certification	law.8 It follows from the foregoing that 
this	court	should	not	accept	certification	of	the	first	question,	unless	
some  other  discretionary  factor  dictates  a  contrary  conclusion. 
__________

“8  We  recognize  that  the  district  court  appears  to  be  concerned 
about an inconsistency in decisions on this subject. However, our 
focus in searching for controlling precedent is narrower than the 
focus of the district court. The Oregon Court of Appeals decision 
in  [Korbut]  is  “controlling  precedent”  for  the  purposes  of  ORS 
28.200 [the statute authorizing answers to questions of law cer-
tified	 by	 other	 courts]	 and	 our	 exercise	 of	 discretion	 under	 that	
statute.”

It  is  unclear  from  the  opinion  in  Western  Helicopter  Services  whether  the 
Supreme  Court  was  telling  the  United  States  District  Court  that  it  should 
follow  Oregon  law  rather  than  the  federal  cases  interpreting  Oregon  law  or 
whether	the	court	was	in	fact	affirming	that	Korbut was controlling precedent 
on	the	issue	presented	by	the	certified	question.	

5. 

Block Quotations Within Block Quotations

When formatting a second level of blocked quoted text within blocked 
 
quoted	text,	use	the	standard	indent	for	the	first	level	of	quotation,	and	then	for	the	
internal quoted text, use a double indent for both the right and left margins.

“the state must prove that the defendant’s consent was independent of, or only 
tenuously related to, the illegal police conduct. As the court explained, 

“	‘consent	is	insufficient	to	establish	the	admissibility	of	evidence	
from a warrantless search if the state cannot prove that the consent 

 

54 

was  independent  of,  or  only  tenuously  related  to,  any  preceding 
violation of the defendant’s rights under Article I, section 9. Unless 
the state is able to make that showing, then the defendant’s con-
sent cannot operate to validate a warrantless search because the 
defendant’s consent itself derived from a violation of the defen-
dant’s rights under that state constitutional provision.’ ”

Jones, 265 Or App at 678 (quoting State v. Yunker, 330 Or 388, 395, 457 P3d 
890 (2013) (emphasis in Yunker)).

B.	

Use	of	Parenthetical	Phrases	With	Quotations	Within	Text

 

If internal quotation marks or brackets are omitted, so indicate, e.g., 

“By looking to only the current employment of the land, the law ignores the past and 
any intentions with regard to future use.” Everhart v. Dept. of Rev., 15 OTR 76, 81 
(1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). 

or

In Everhart v. Dept. of Rev., 15 OTR 76, 81 (1999), the court rejected that argument, 
stating, “By looking to only the current employment of the land, the law ignores the 
past and any intentions with regard to future use.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

NOTE: It is correct to add either a parenthetical indicating that internal quotation 
marks are omitted or to leave in the quotation marks and add a parenthetical 
indicating the source that you are quoting, but not both.

Oppressive conduct is 

“ ‘burdensome,  harsh  and  wrongful  conduct;  a  lack  of  probity  and  fair 
dealing	in	the	affairs	of	the	company	to	the	prejudice	of	some	of	its	mem-
bers; or a *  *  * departure from the standards of fair dealing, and a violation 
of fair play on which every shareholder who entrusts his money to a com-
pany is entitled to rely.’ ”

Polk v. Hergert Land & Cattle Co., 5 P3d 402, 404 (Colo App 2000) (quoting Jorgensen 
v. Water Works, Inc., 218 Wis 2d 761, 783, 582 NW2d 98, 107 (Wis App 1998) (brack-
ets omitted)).

Include	a	parenthetical	phrase	to	differentiate	emphasis	being	added	to	quoted	

	
material as opposed to emphasis that was already in the original text, e.g., 

“While  mass-appraisal  techniques  may  place  heavy  reliance  upon  cost,  cost  alone 
is not determinative of market value.” Su v. Dept. of Rev., 15 OTR 305, 308 (2001) 
(emphasis added).

 

55 

“ORS  653.295,  however,  provides  no  remedy  for  discharge  of  an  employee  *  *  *.” 
Dymock v. Norwest Safety Protective Equipment, 172 Or App 399, 406, 19 P3d 934 
(2001) (emphasis in original).

When the material being quoted contains a quotation, the text of which is 
 
emphasized, include a parenthetical phrase that notes the source of the emphasis (use 
emphases if plural), e.g.,

As in Gladhart v. Oregon Vineyard Supply Co., this court again repeats that

“the Brown court ‘only acknowledged that perhaps strict liability should 
require the danger	to	be	one	endangering	human	life	or	safety,	a	different	
question from whether tort recovery should be limited to such an injury,’ 
and	that	‘[t]hat	difference	determines	the	decision	in	the	present	case.’	”

164 Or App 438, 451-52, 994 P2d 134 (1999) (quoting Russell v. Ford Motor Company, 
281 Or 587, 593-94, 575 P2d 1383 (1978) (emphases in Russell)). 

“Apparent authority is created ‘only by some conduct of the principal which, when rea-
sonably interpreted, causes a third party to believe that the principal consents to have 
the apparent agent act for him on that matter.’ ” Badger v. Paulson Investment Co., Inc., 
311 Or 14, 24, 803 P2d 1178 (1991) (quoting Mattson v. Commercial Credit Business 
Loans, 301 Or 407, 422, 723 P2d 996 (1986) (emphasis added)).

Badger v. Paulson Investment Co., Inc., 311 Or 14, 24, 803 P2d 1178 (1991) (“Apparent 
authority is created ‘only by some conduct of the principal which, when reasonably 
interpreted, causes a third party to believe that the principal consents to have the appar-
ent agent act for him on that matter.’ ” (Quoting Mattson v. Commercial Credit Business 
Loans, 301 Or 407, 422, 723 P2d 996 (1986) (emphasis in Mattson).)).

Multiple notations about a quotation may follow any order that clearly 
 
communicates whether and how the text was altered. If in doubt, choose this order: 
“in original,” “omitted,” and “added.” It is also acceptable, to improve readability, to use 
“first	emphasis	added;	second	emphasis	in	original,”	etc.

In particular, petitioner focuses on the following emphasized statements that 

 
appear in the form under the heading “Information Considered at the Hearing”:

“Discovery is not permitted. Requests that the Board research and obtain 
information you want considered cannot be honored. It is your responsi-
bility to provide that information. You do not have the right to call wit-
nesses or to cross-examine witnesses who have provided information to 
the Board.”

(Underscoring in original; footnote and boldface omitted; emphasis added.)

 

56 

Consistently  with  those  principles,  the  court  more  recently  summarized  the 

 
requirements of ORS 136.440 as follows:

 
“By its terms, ORS 136.440(1) requires only that the corroborat-
ing  evidence  tend  to  connect  the  defendant  with  the  commission  of  the 
offense,	here,	aggravated	murder.	That	statute	does	not	require	corrobora-
tion of a particular theory	of	the	commission	of	the	offense.

“It is not necessary that the corroborating evidence be direct and 
 
positive; it may be circumstantial. Nor is it necessary that there be indepen-
dent corroborating evidence with respect to every material fact necessary 
to be established to sustain a conviction for the commission of a crime. 
Where there is any evidence apart from that of the accomplice tending to 
connect the defendant with the commission of the crime, the question of 
whether the accomplice’s testimony is corroborated is one for the trier of 
fact.”

State v. Walton, 311 Or 223, 242-43, 809 P2d 81 (1991) (emphasis in original; citations 
omitted).

It  depends,  the  court  stated,  on  the  nature  of  the  restriction—in  particular, 

 
whether the restriction is on the contribution itself:

“If	it	can	be	shown	that	financial	contributions	and	expenditures	are	the	
free expression of opinion, laws limiting such activities run afoul of the 
constitutional protection. But lawmakers might choose to impose require-
ments distinct from contribution or expenditure limitations (e.g., require-
ments of disclosure of financing sources and the extent of any gift) as well 
as various sanctions (e.g.,	civil	or	criminal	penalties,	disqualification	from	
the ballot or Voters’ Pamphlet, and the like) and their choice may not nec-
essarily	offend	the	constitutional	requirement.”

Id.	at	523	(first	emphasis	added;	second	emphasis	in	original;	internal	quotation	marks	
omitted).

When a citation includes both a parenthetical phrase and subsequent history, place 

 
the parenthetical after the subsequent history, e.g., 

Defendant notes that the fact that a search occurred cannot, alone, support an inference 
that	the	searching	officers	had	subjective	probable	cause.	See State v. Bickford, 157 Or 
App 386, 390 n 1, 970 P2d 234 (1998), rev den, 329 Or 589 (2000) (“If a trial court 
could infer subjective probable cause from the arrest, we would never need to inquire 
into subjective probable cause for the arrest.”).

 

57 

When a parenthetical contains a quotation that has been altered, include an internal 

 
parenthetical and adjust the punctuation accordingly, e.g.,

The court held that claims of increasing pain due to injury, standing alone, were insuf-
ficient	to	establish	an	aggravation	claim.	SAIF v. Walker, 330 Or 102, 116, 996 P2d 
979 (2000) (stating that ORS 656.273(1) requires “proof, based upon medical evidence 
supported	by	objective	findings”	(emphasis	added)).

The  court  held  that  claimant’s  claims  of  increasing  pain  due  to  the  injury,  standing 
alone,	were	insufficient	to	establish	an	aggravation	claim.	SAIF v. Walker, 330 Or 102, 
116-17,	996	P2d	979	(2000)	(“Under	ORS	656.005(19),	however,	such	‘objective	find-
ings’ may include evidence of worsened symptoms.” (Emphasis in original.)).

When appending information to a citation, using terms such as cited in, quoted in, 

 
construed in, etc., those words are italicized,

Keenan  v.  Norris-Lampe,  330  Or  456,  777  P2d  897  (1999),  construed  in  Bennett  v. 
Bauman, 333 Or 566, 790 P2d 654 (2001). 

Citing ORS 136.425 (2005), amended by Or Laws 2009, chapter 875, section 1, defen-
dant	contends	that,	by	itself,	a	confession	is	insufficient	to	support	a	conviction	for	an	
offense.

When including works that the primary authority quotes, discusses, or mentions, 

 
the lead-in words should be indicated parenthetically and not italicized, e.g.,

See  Keenan  v.  Norris-Lampe,  330  Or  456,  777  P2d  897  (1999)  (citing  Bennett  v. 
Bauman, 329 Or 566, 770 P2d 654 (1998)); see also Brown v. Uphoff, 381 F3d 1219, 
1226 (10th Cir 2004) (“Unlike Gideon, Crawford does not ‘alter our understanding of 
what constitutes basic due process,’ but merely sets out new standards for the admis-
sion of certain kinds of hearsay.” (Quoting United States v. Mora, 293 F3d 1213, 1219 
(10th Cir 2002).)).

II.	Use	of	Uppercase,	Brackets,	and	Ellipsis	Within	Quotations

A.	

Use	of	Uppercase

	
uppercase, e.g., 

Generally,	the	first	letter	of	a	quotation	that	reads	as	a	full	sentence	must	be	in	

The trial court issued a letter opinion that addressed defendant’s motion as follows: 
“There	is	no	evidence	supporting	the	first	change.”

The	witness	testified,	“Although	I	am	not	a	doctor,	I	play	one	on	TV.”

 

Sometimes this requires changing the initial letter of a quotation to uppercase, e.g.,

The court observed, “[U]npreserved error will ordinarily not be reviewed on appeal.”

The examining physician’s report declared, “[C]laimant was medically stationary as of 
February 12, 1992.”

In the following example, the use of a bracketed lowercase letter indicates that the 

 
initial letter was in uppercase in the original, e.g.,

Incorrect:	

Defendant argued, “[t]he trial court erred in excluding witnesses from 
the courtroom.”

Correct:	

Defendant argued, “The trial court erred in excluding witnesses from 
the courtroom.”

EXCEPTION: When a quotation that reads as a full sentence is incorporated into the 
grammatical	structure	of	the	sentence	(often	preceded	by	“that”),	do	not	uppercase	the	first 
letter	and	use	brackets	if	the	first	letter	of	the	quotation	was	uppercase	in	the	original,	e.g.,

The court observed that “[u]npreserved error will ordinarily not be reviewed on appeal.”

NOTE: For using uppercase after colons, refer to page 79.

B.	

Use	of	Brackets

The use of brackets in quoted material indicates that something has been changed, 

 
modified,	or	deleted	from	how	it	was	originally	published.

1. 

Indicate a Change in Uppercase or Lowercase

You should “[p]lace commas and periods inside quotation marks.”

 

59 

2. 

Alter a Word

“Plaintiff	place[s]	substantial	weight	on	its	belief	that	the	legislature	intended	
to restore the common practice of exempting brooder houses.” 

The prohibition was enacted to “ensure[ ] that dogs will have their day.” 

3. 

Indicate Substituted or Added Words

The  court’s  “jurisdiction  [is  limited]  to  determining  whether  petitioners’ 
assessment may be spread over a period of at least 10 years.”

4. 

Add Punctuation to a Quotation Where There Previously Was No 
Punctuation and the Punctuation Is Not Part of the Larger Sentence

The standard of care applicable to physicians requires the use of “that degree 
of care, skill[,] and diligence” as is used by physicians in the same or similar 
community.

The trial court concluded that “there is no issue of material fact,” but it also 
concluded  that  defendant  was  not  entitled  to  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law. 
[No comma in original; brackets not needed, because comma is part of larger 
sentence.]

5.  Modify Punctuation that Appears in the Original Text 

Punctuation in quoted text can be replaced with other punctuation with the 

 
use of brackets:

Original: 

“The Court of Appeals has 13 members, but they sit in panels 
of three.”

New: 

 

“The  Court  of Appeals  has  13  members[;]  *  *  *  they  sit  in 
panels of three.”

If quoted material ends before the new sentence ends, then punctuation that 

 
is appropriate for the new sentence can be included inside the quotation marks:

Original: 

Defendant’s argument is beyond reproach and compels us to 
strike his brief and order him to pay petitioner’s costs.

New: 

 

In Jones, the court characterized the defendant’s argument as 
“beyond reproach,” struck his brief, and ordered him to pay 
the petitioner’s costs.

 

60 

 
If omitting quoted material at the end of a quoted sentence, but ending 
the new sentence with the partially quoted material, denote the omitted quoted 
material before the period in the new sentence with an ellipsis:

Original: 

A party shall make a notation of exception either orally on the 
record	or	in	a	writing	filed	with	the	court.

New: 

 

ORCP 59 H(2) provides that “[a] party shall make a notation 
of exception either orally on the record or in a writing *  *  *.”

6. 

Insert a Citation Within a Quotation

When quoting text that refers to a case by use of supra rather than a 

 
citation, add the citation in brackets, e.g.,

“This  court  has  declared  that  evidence  is  suppressed  for  violations  of  the 
Oregon Constitution ‘to preserve *  *  * rights to the same extent as if the gov-
ernment’s	officers	had	stayed	within	the	law.’	State v. Davis[, 295 Or 227, 234, 
666 P2d 802 (1983)].”

 

Use a short citation form if the case has already been cited in full, e.g.,

“A discovery rule cannot be assumed, but must be found in the statute or lim-
itations itself. Huff[, 322 Or at 462].”

When modifying quoted material to add emphasized text, emphasize the 
 
brackets themselves, in addition to the inserted emphasized text, only when the 
words on both sides of the brackets are already emphasized, e.g.,

Correct:	

“Plaintiff’s [first] argument *  *  *”

Correct:	

“Plaintiff’s [first] argument *  *  *”

Correct:	

“Plaintiff’s [first] argument *  *  *”

Incorrect:	

“Plaintiff’s [first] argument *  *  *”

Incorrect:	

“Plaintiff’s	[first] argument *  *  *”

7. 

Indicate	a	Significant	Mistake	in	the	Original

“[Sic]” is used to indicate that the author being quoted has used a word 

 
incorrectly or has used an incorrect spelling of a word within the context of 

 

61 

the sentence that confuses or changes the meaning of the sentence. Obvious 
typographical errors may be silently corrected, but any idiosyncrasy of spelling 
(particularly from older works) is preserved, e.g., “defence.” When using [sic], it 
is italicized, enclosed in brackets, and placed after the uncorrected word, e.g.,

“The court’s rational [sic] for its decision was based entirely on legal precedent.” 

“We are going to precede [sic] with our plans for the law suit.”

(Here, the use of [sic] signals the reader that “rational” should actually read 

 
“rationale”; “precede” should read “proceed.”)

Bracketing and correcting an error in quoted material instead of using [sic] 

 
is	usually	sufficient	as	long	as	it	does	not	alter	the	meaning.	The	use	of	[sic] should 
be avoided to point out minor grammatical errors, to indicate disagreement with a 
word’s usage, or to appear highhanded. Instead, the preferred method is to silently 
correct or to use brackets, e.g., 

Incorrect:	

“The  company,  on  its  own  volition,  intervened  in  the  trial 
Court [sic] proceedings *  *  *.”

Correct:	

Correct:	

“The  company,  on  its  own  volition,  intervened  in  the  trial 
[c]ourt proceedings *  *  *.”

“The  company,  on  its  own  volition,  intervened  in  the  trial 
court proceedings *  *  *.”

Incorrect:	

“The lab technician dropped the vile [sic] of blood.”

Correct:	

“The lab technician dropped the vi[al] of blood.”

Correct:	

“The lab technician dropped the vial of blood.”

NOTE: Where a word or sentence would be correct either way, do not use [sic].

C. 

Use of Ellipsis

1. 

Partial Omission

Use three asterisks (not periods), separated by spaces, to indicate omission 

 
of a word or words within a sentence, omission of sentences within a block 
quotation, and omission of text after a subsection number, e.g.,

 

62 

The claimant seeks compensation “for mental and emotional distress and *  *  * 
damages.”

In  amending  ORS  656.273(1)  in  1995,  the  legislature  “neither  repealed  nor 
amended ORS 656.273(8) *  *  * but it may have changed how ORS 656.273(8) 
is applied.”

When quoting a full sentence except the end, use three asterisks, followed 

 
by a period, to indicate omission of the end of the sentence:

“The evidence directly establishes only the truth of the primary fact or facts 
from which an inference may be derived *  *  *.”

EXCEPTION: If quoting a full sentence except the end and the quoted material 
originally ended with a punctuation mark, then use only a bracketed period to 
indicate the change of punctuation (and, by inference, the end of the sentence):

“A court may consider unpreserved error under the plan error doctrine only if 
the error is one of law[.]” (period replaces semicolon and the remainder of the 
sentence)

When including quoted material within a sentence and the new sentence 

 
ends before the quoted material ended, an ellipsis is not needed:

Correct:	

If reasonable minds can disagree, then “any error is not plain.”

Incorrect:	

If reasonable minds can disagree, then “any error is not plain 
*  *  *.”

Use three asterisks (not followed by a period) to indicate omission of one 
 
or more sentences at the end of a paragraph within (as opposed to at the end of) a 
block quotation:

“The  majority’s  reading  of  the  statute  requires  us  to  make  two  leaps  of 
faith.	The	first	leap	is	that,	in	1965,	the	legislature	used	‘gear	or	equip-
ment’  to  mean  exactly  what  ‘appliance’  meant  between  1921  and  1965. 
The	second	leap	of	faith	is	that	the	terms	‘boats,	fishing	gear	and	vehicles’	
mean exactly what ‘gear or equipment’ means in ORS 506.655 *  *  *. *  *  *

“We decline to take those leaps for several reasons.”

NOTE:	In	the	preceding	example,	the	first	ellipsis	indicates	that	a	sentence	
otherwise quoted in full has been ended prematurely. The second ellipsis indicates 
that an additional sentence or sentences has been omitted.

 

63 

 

Omission of text after a subsection number:

 
“(1) As used in ORS 308A.050 to 308A.128, ‘farm use’ means the 
current	employment	of	land	for	the	primary	purpose	of	obtaining	a	profit	
in money by:

 

“(a) *  *  * harvesting and selling crops.”

A block quotation that starts somewhere other than the beginning of the 

 
quoted	sentence	or	paragraph	may	be	treated	a	few	different	ways,	depending	on	
the author’s use of the quoted material. 

An ellipsis is not necessary to begin a quotation that starts somewhere other 

 
than the beginning of the sentence or paragraph, e.g., 

The issue in Merriweather was as follows:

“[W]hether a circuit court order compelling witnesses to appear 
and  testify  before  a  grand  jury  was  appealable  under  ORS 
19.205(4) as the product of a ‘special statutory proceeding.’ ”

The court has previously explained that 

“neither ORS 279.340 nor any other provision setting out require-
ments  for  hours  of  labor  by  public  employees,  ORS  279.334  - 
279.342,  expressly  states  what  is  meant  by  the  phrase  ‘directly 
employed’  or  indicates  the  categories  of  persons  to  whom  the 
phrase applies.”

Place	the	beginning	of	a	block	quotation	flush	left	when	the	original	quoted	

	
material	is	not	the	first	sentence	of	a	paragraph,	e.g.,

As this court has stated before,

“[e]ven	 if	 that	 assumption	 is	 accurate,	 it	 is	 insufficient	 because	
even	 in	 a	 high	 crime	 neighborhood	 unprovoked	 flight	 does	 not	
invariably  lead  to  reasonable  suspicion  *  *  *.  Like  unprovoked 
flight	itself,	presence	in	a	high	crime	neighborhood	is	a	fact	too	
generic and susceptible to innocent explanation to satisfy the rea-
sonable suspicion inquiry.”

 

Do not use an ellipsis if quoting only part of a sentence, e.g., 

Again, the legislature expressly provided that those actions be “commenced 
not	later	than	two	years	after	the	date	on	which	the	plaintiff	first	discovered,	or	
in the exercise of reasonable care should have discovered,” the death, injury, 
or disease.

 

64 

Do not use an ellipsis to denote the omission of a citation or footnote. 

 
Instead, use “citation omitted” or “footnote omitted” in a parenthetical.

 

When quoting only part of a statute, rule, etc., use “in part,” e.g.,

 
ORS 305.440 provides, in part, “If no appeal is taken to the Supreme 
Court,	 the	 decision	 of	 the	 court	 shall	 constitute	 a	 final	 determination	 of	 the	
matter.”

2. 

Block Omission

Use	five	asterisks	to	indicate	omission	of	a	block	of	text	such	as	paragraphs	

	
or sections, but not to indicate an omission of additional material after an ending 
paragraph, e.g., 

OAR 635-005-0180 provides, in part:

“It is unlawful for commercial purposes to take, land, or 

 
possess sea urchins:

“*  *  *  *  *

 

	

“(3)	Without	first	obtaining	a	permit	*		*		*.”

NOTE: If the original has additional text, it is not necessary to add three asterisks 
following the period.

In General

STYLE GUIDE

This section addresses issues of word treatment, grammar, punctuation, and usage 

 
that arise frequently in opinion drafting. It is not exhaustive. Grammar and usage are 
not exact sciences; there are many questions of style about which reasonable minds can 
differ.	To	promote	consistency,	however,	the	courts	generally	follow	the	conventions	
outlined below. 

Other	Resources

The courts use the following reference works (which also have updated editions) 

 
to resolve style issues not addressed in the Oregon Appellate Courts Style Manual 
(Updated 2022).

• 

Webster’s Third New Int’l Dictionary (unabridged ed 2002).

For questions regarding spelling, word usage, or proper hyphenation when 
dividing words, the appellate courts adopted Webster’s, in 1993, as the 
official	dictionary.	

• 

The Chicago Manual of Style (14th ed 1993).

This reference work addresses many grammatical standards and 
punctuation issues not covered here. 

• 

Bryan A. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern American Usage (1998).

This work explains many principles of grammar and punctuation. It is also 
a very helpful guide to word usage.

• 

Bryan A. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage (2d ed 1995).

This is a helpful guide to modern legal usage. It also addresses many 
general questions of grammar and punctuation.

I. Spelling, Font, and Treatment of Words

A.	

Use	of	Italics	and	Roman	Typeface

1. 

Foreign Words

 
italicized, e.g., 

Some foreign words and phrases commonly used in legal writing are not 

ad hoc   
ad hominem 
ad valorem 
de facto  
en banc  

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

etc. 
 
habeas corpus 
mandamus 
per curiam 
pro rata  

pro tempore
quid pro quo
remittitur
subpoena
vice versa

Other less common foreign words and phrases that are italicized include the 

 
following. When using such words in the body of an opinion, use the periods and 
diacritical marks as set out below.

 
 
 

 
 
 

a priori  
ab initio 
ad litem  
amicus curiae / amici curiae 
arguendo 
 
certiorari 
 
contra   
 
coram nobis 
 
de novo  
 
dictum   
 
dubitante 
 
duces tecum 
 
 
e.g. 
 
et al. 
 
 
et seq.   
 
 
ex parte  
ex post facto, but 
   Ex Post Facto Clause

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

i.e.

2. 

Signals

Introductory signals such as cf., accord, see, e.g., compare / with, and see 

 
generally are italicized. “See” is not italicized when it functions as a verb and not 
as a signal, e.g.,

For discussion on the merits, see Smith, 300 Or App at 150.

 

67 

3. 

Case Names and Other Authorities

Case names are italicized, as are the titles of books and other authorities. 

 
Please refer to the Citation Section for examples. 

When a case or other authority takes a possessive ending, the apostrophe 

 
and “s” are not italicized:

Miranda’s holding has been called into question.

NOTE: In state jurisdictions having more than one appellate court at the same 
level, do not use uppercase for any shortened version of the name of that court. 
For example, the full form “California Court of Appeal, First Appellate District” 
uses uppercase, but the shortened form “court of appeal” does not. (There is no “s” 
after “appeal” for the California courts of appeal.) Similarly, “New York Supreme 
Court, Appellate Division, Third Department” uses uppercase, but the shortened 
form “supreme court” does not. (In New York, the Court of Appeals is the highest 
court, while the appellate divisions of the supreme court are the intermediate 
appellate courts.) However, it is permissible to use uppercase for shortened names 
of federal appellate courts, e.g., the Ninth Circuit.

c. 

Months and Days of the Week (usually written in month-day-year 
sequence), e.g.,

He	filed	the	motion	on	Monday,	January	23,	1993.

The action occurred in November 2013. 

Defendant appeals from the January 16, 1994, order.

d. 

Full Title of a Constitution, Constitutional Amendment, or Clause of 
a Constitution, e.g.,

Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution (but “state constitution”) 
Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution 

(but “federal constitution”)

Contract Clause
dormant Commerce Clause
Due Process Clause 
Ex Post Facto Clause 
Privileges and Immunities Clause 
Proportionality Clause

 

69 

 
In the phrase “Oregon and United States constitutions,” do not 
uppercase “constitutions,” because the full title of neither document is 
being used. Note that either of the following formulations is preferred:  
“state and federal constitutions” or “the Oregon Constitution and the United 
States Constitution.”

e. 

“En Banc” and “Per Curiam” on Title Pages

NOTE: When used within the text on an opinion, those terms do not 
start with uppercase letters, e.g., “The Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, 
reversed.”

f. 

“Intoxilyzer” or “Breathalyzer” 
(Those are proper names for particular breath testing equipment.)

“Ziploc” or “Taser” (trademarked names) 
(but zippered bag or stun gun)

g. 

“Class” or “Count” 
(When referring to misdemeanor or felony charges), e.g.,

Class A felony 

Count 1 of the indictment

Counts 1 and 2

“Schedule” 
(When referring to drugs), e.g., 

Schedule I drug

h. 

i. 

“Act” or “Code” 
(When	referring	to	the	full	title	of	specific	Acts	or	Codes),	e.g.,

The	Oregon	Condominium	Act	specifically	lists	those	conditions.	The	
act does not set out the condition on which appellant relies.

The  Bankruptcy  Code  provides  for  that  situation.  The  code  further 
provides a remedy in the event of a violation.

j.	

Particular	Sections	of	the	Oregon	Revised	Statutes	Identified	
Collectively, e.g.,

2. 

Do Not Use Uppercase for the Following:

a. 

Generic Terms, e.g., 

“federal” or “state,”

as in

the state
state constitution
federal constitution
statute of frauds
statute of limitations

Federal Land Bank
State of Oregon

BUT do use uppercase when part of a full proper name, e.g., 

b. 

The Words “chapter” or “section” 
(When	referring	to	a	specific	chapter	or	section	within	a	sentence), e.g., 

ORS chapter 10; Article I, section 9.

But

The Words “website” or “internet”

C.	

Numbers	and	Dates

 

In General

 
series of like objects, e.g.,

Numbers one through nine are spelled out when used in text, except when listing a 

Judges	from	five	states	came	to	the	conference:	5	from	Washington,	2	from	California,	
10 from Oregon, 6 from Idaho, and 1 from Alaska.

All numbers after nine are expressed as numerals, except when they begin a 

 
sentence, e.g.,

Thirty-four judges attended the conference.

Defendant raises 10 assignments of error.

	

Very	large	numbers	are	expressed	in	figures	followed	by	million,	billion,	etc.,	e.g., 

5 million people; 2 billion particles; $10 million

All ordinal numbers (i.e., numbers that measure position) are spelled out when 

 
used in narrative, e.g.,

Plaintiff’s	twelfth	assignment	of	error	is	not	well	taken.

I	chased	my	cat	Jethro	off	the	sofa	for	the	one	hundredth	time.	

This is the court’s seventy-third oral argument day this year. 

NOTE: (1) Ordinal numbers consisting of more than one word are hyphenated if the 
corresponding cardinal number is hyphenated, e.g., “seven hundred and twelfth” is not 
hyphenated, because “seven hundred and twelve” is not hyphenated, but “eighty-second” 
is hyphenated, because “eighty-two” is hyphenated. (2) Ordinal numbers are expressed 

 

72 

numerically to identify reports and courts in citations, e.g., Boston v. Cream Pie, 283 F2d 
1 (9th Cir 1999).

1. 

Fractions, Decimals, and Ratios

Fractions appearing in nonquoted text either alone or with numbers 

 
less than 10 are spelled out; fractions appearing with numbers 10 or higher are 
expressed as numerals, e.g.,

Four and one-half years old

23 1/4 

One third

When fractions are expressed as numerals, insert a space between the whole 

 
number and the fraction. Do NOT use a hyphen. (“10 2/3,” not “10-2/3.”) 

 

 

 

Use numerals when using a decimal point, e.g.,

.08 percent blood alcohol content

Use numerals when denoting ratios, e.g., 

4:1 or ratio of 4 to 1 (as they are easier to read inside text)

However, spell out numbers when denoting measurement, e.g.,

The	subject	was	five	feet	eight	inches	tall.

2. 

Percentages

 
tables, e.g.,

Spell out the word “percent” when used in text. Use the percent sign (%) in 

Fifteen percent of the people in 1993 voted against the ballot measure. 

In 1995, 15 percent of the people voted against the ballot measure.

Year 
1991 
1992 
1993 

 
 
 
 

Percent 
10% 
20% 
15%

 

73 

3. 

Time

 

Include minutes and a.m. or p.m., e.g.,

Oral arguments begin at 8:00 a.m. (not “8 a.m.”)

We will break for lunch at 12:15 p.m.

The defendant was last seen at 8:00 p.m. (not 8 o’clock in the evening)

4. 

Dates

 
year, e.g.,

 
day, e.g.,

Three-part	dates	are	set	off	with	a	comma	between	the	day	and	the	year	

	
and, generally, a comma after the year, e.g.,

Defendant appeals from the January 16, 1994, order.

When	indicating	an	inclusive	period	of	time,	omit	the	comma	after	the	first	

Defendant was on probation from June 14, 1980 to July 30, 1982.

When referring to a date by month and day, do not use endings with the 

the September 19 hearing (not September 19th)

When indicating time by month and year only, there is no comma before or 

 
after the year, unless the sentence structure requires a comma after the year, e.g.,

Three lawyers attended the April 1990 deposition.

The trial, which was scheduled for June 1990, was postponed several times.

When indicating a period of several years, use “to” or “through,” not a 

 
hyphen, e.g.,

Judge Caspar was on the bench from 1900 to 1921.

EXCEPTION: Hyphens are used for tax years. Do not repeat the “19” for 
inclusive years, e.g., tax years 1995-97, but tax year 1999-2000. For years ending 
in double “00” repeat the entire sequence, e.g., 2000-2001.

 

An indication of a decade does not take an apostrophe, e.g.,

1980s

 

74 

 

Indications of time, as shown here, take an apostrophe, e.g.,

24 months’ incarceration (or 24 months of incarceration)
six weeks’ time (or six weeks of time)

When referring to dollars, use the dollar sign; do not spell out “dollars,” 

5.  Money

 
e.g.,

$5 million; $2 billion

Use $25.00 if there are other mixed dollar and cents amounts referred to, 

 
otherwise use $25 if standing alone, e.g., 

Plaintiff	sought	$10,000.00	in	attorney	fees	and	$875.45	in	costs.

The court entered judgment in the amount of $10,000.

 

Use a comma in numbers larger than three digits, e.g.,

$1,500

D.	

Acronyms	/	Initialisms

 
Acronyms are composed of the initial letters or parts of a compound term. An 
acronym is usually read or spoken as a single word, rather than letter by letter, e.g., AIDS. 
Initialisms are abbreviations pronounced letter by letter, e.g., ORCP, LCDC, DWS, HGN, 
JNOV, etc. Periods are usually omitted to improve readability. In either event, all but the 
most	common	acronyms	/	initialisms	are	spelled	out	upon	first	usage,	followed	by	the	
acronym / initialism enclosed in parentheses, e.g.,

Mountain	View	Hospital	District	(MVHD)	filed	a	motion	for	summary	judgment.	

 
The article that precedes an acronym or initialism depends on how the abbreviation 
reads: If it is pronounced beginning with a vowel sound, then use “an.” If it is pronounced 
beginning with a consonant sound, then use “a.”

an LCDC order
an ORAP provision
an ORCP ruling
a LUBA opinion
a	Umatilla	County	sheriff

 

75 

Generally, add an “s” when forming a plural of something singular, e.g., SSNs, 

 
UFOs, MDs, CCRs, and add an apostrophe to show possession, e.g., LUBA’s analysis or 
PERS’s liabilities.

Corpus Juris Secundum (an encyclopedia of United States law at the federal 

 
and state levels) is abbreviated as CJS without periods.

A. 

Apostrophes

II.	Punctuation

 

If a singular word ends in “s,” then add “ 's ” to show possession, e.g.,

or if a name ends in “z,” or “ x,” e.g.,

George Harris’s house
witness’s testimony
Clauss’s land
PERS’s liabilities

Sanchez’s argument
Rex’s children

Boy Scouts’ answer
General Motors’ complaint

the Joneses’ driveway
the boys’ gym

children’s toys
women’s tournament

Exception:	Singular entity names that end in “s” take only an apostrophe, e.g., 

Form the possessive of most plural words by adding only an apostrophe:

Plural words that do not end in “s” take “ 's ” to form the possessive:

 
If there are two (or more) possessors, proper punctuation depends on meaning. If 
the possession is separate, each possessor takes an apostrophe. If the possession is joint, 
only the last possessor takes an apostrophe, e.g.,

mother’s and father’s children (if referring to each parent’s children with another partner)
mother and father’s children (if they have children together)
mother’s and father’s arguments (if they are separate arguments)
mother and father’s arguments (if their arguments are joint)

Use an apostrophe with the following indications of time, e.g.,

36 months’ incarceration
two weeks’ time

77 

 

 

 

 

 

Do not use an apostrophe with these particular word phrases, e.g.,

Attorney fees 
IRAs

When a name of a case or other italicized authority takes a possessive ending, the 

 
“ 's ” is not italicized:

Miranda’s holding has been called into question.

NOTE:	Sometimes	the	use	of	“	's	”	can	be	awkward	and	make	for	difficult	reading.	
In those situations, use “of” instead. E.g., for “Church at 295 S. 18th St.’s analysis,” 
consider using “the analysis of Church at 295 S. 18th St.”; for “ORS 123.456(1)(a)’s 
wording,” consider using “the wording of ORS 123.456.”

B. 

Colons

1. 

Colons may be used to separate a grammatically complete sentence from, 
for example, another grammatically complete sentence or a list:

The court announced a general rule: Attorney fees may not be awarded in the 
absence of an authorizing statute or contract provision.

The	officer	found	several	items	in	defendant’s	apartment:	a	scale,	five	plastic	
bags containing white powder, and $751 in small bills.

 

Colons may not be used after a grammatically incomplete thought:

Incorrect:	

The  panel  consisted  of:  Judge  Yunker,  Judge  Bauman,  and 
Judge Keenan.

Correct:	

The  panel  consisted  of  three  judges:  Judge  Yunker,  Judge 
Bauman, and Judge Keenan.

Incorrect:	

Defendant  argues:  (1)  the  trial  court  erred  in  admitting  evi-
dence,  (2)  the  error  was  not  harmless,  and  (3)  alternatively, 
the trial court erred in denying his motion for directed verdict.

Correct:	

Defendant  makes  three  arguments:  (1)  the  trial  court  erred 
in  admitting  evidence,  (2)  the  error  was  not  harmless,  and 
(3) alternatively, the trial court erred in denying his motion for 
directed verdict.

 

78 

EXCEPTION: Colons may be used after verbs to introduce block 
quotations only, e.g.,

ORS 123.456 provides:

“Now  is  the  time  for  all  good  citizens  to  come  to  the  aid  of  their 
country.”

As part of that analysis, Justice Brennan observed:

“Under Article III of the Constitution, this Court may only adjudi-
cate actual, ongoing controversies.”

 

If the quotation is not blocked, then use a comma.

ORS 123.456 provides, “Now is the time for all good citizens to come to the 
aid of their country.”

2. 

Use of Uppercase After Colons 

If the material following a colon is not a complete sentence, then it does not 

 
begin with an uppercase letter.

The court excluded three items: a gun, a ukelele, and a garden hose.

If the material following the colon is a complete sentence, then it does 

 
begin with an uppercase letter.

The rain in Spain does not fall mainly on the plain: It mainly falls in the north-
ern mountains.

The court did not deny defendant’s motion outright: It deferred its ruling until 
the	evidence	was	offered	at	trial.	

C. 

Commas

 
using one.

Remember the basic comma rule: Use a comma only when you know why you are 

The following guidelines do not set out all the situations in which commas are 
 
correctly used. They may be useful, however, in resolving some of the most frequent 

 

79 

questions about when to use, and when not to use, commas. For more guidance, see The 
Chicago Manual of Style; Bryan A. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern American Usage; 
and William A. Sabin, The Gregg Reference Manual. 

1. 

Items in a Series

 
A series of more than two items should be separated by commas. The 
courts’ convention is to use the serial comma (i.e., a comma before the conjunction 
in a series of more than two items), because it eliminates the possibility of 
misreading:

Sheila invited Ben’s parents, friends, and coworkers. 

I agree that defendant’s brief is well written, his analysis is cogent, and his 
arguments are persuasive. 

A series of only two items should not be separated by a comma, regardless 

 
of the length of the items. 

Plaintiff	contends	that	the	trial	court	erred	when	it	granted	defendants’	motion	
for	summary	judgment	on	her	claim	for	intentional	infliction	of	emotional	dis-
tress and when it denied her motion to exclude witnesses and reporters.

NOTE: It may be more clear to separate two items in a series with a comma when 
the items themselves contain multiple elements, e.g.,

In support of his motion, defendant cited Oregon and Washington cases, and 
state and federal regulations.

2. 

Compound Predicates

A predicate is a part of a sentence that contains a verb, but not a subject. 
 
Compound predicates are simply predicates that contain a series of verbs. They 
should be treated like any other series: if there are three or more verbs, use 
commas; if there are only two, do not. 

The defendant objected to the introduction of Yost’s testimony, asked the court 
to	call	a	recess,	and	requested	permission	to	file	a	memorandum	in	support	of	
her objection. 

The	court	denied	plaintiff’s	motion	for	a	judgment	notwithstanding	the	verdict	
and granted his motion for a new trial.

 

80 

3. 

Compound Sentences 

 
A compound sentence consists of two or more independent clauses joined 
by a coordinating conjunction. A clause consists of a subject and a predicate. The 
most common coordinating conjunctions are and, but, or, and nor.

Independent Clause: 

 

I will go to Elaine’s New Year’s Eve party.

[Coord. Conj.] Indep. Clause:  [and] I will bring a bottle of champagne.

[Coord. Conj.] Indep. Clause:  [or] I will stay home.

Not a Clause: 
 
 

 
 

 
 

and  dance  on  the  table.  [This  is  a  second 
predicate; see “compound predicates” above.] 

The coordinating conjunctions in compound sentences should be preceded 

 
by a comma.

Paul organized the outing, and everyone had a good time.

Defendant’s	brief	presented	a	difficult	argument,	but	Gina	understood	it	better	
after she attended oral argument.

In the narrow factual context of this case, neither the attachment of the trans-
mitter to the truck nor the subsequent monitoring of that transmitter’s location 
invaded a privacy interest of defendant, and, it follows, no search implicating 
Article I, section 9, occurred.

Exception: When the clauses are short and there is no danger of misreading, the 
comma may be omitted.

Anna	sang	and	Becca	played	the	flute.

4. 

Complex Sentences 

A complex sentence consists of one independent clause and one or 

 
more dependent clauses. A clause is dependent when it is introduced with a 
subordinating conjunction (e.g., because, although, if, after, before, until, since, so 
that, unless, while, when, where, even though) or relative pronoun (who, whom, 
whose, whoever, whomever, that, which).

 
Whether to use a comma between an independent clause and a dependent 
clause depends upon the meaning of and relationship between the clauses. When 
the dependent clause is restrictive–or necessary to the meaning of the sentence– 
do not use a comma. When the dependent clause is nonrestrictive–or not necessary 
to the meaning of the sentence–use a comma. (Those rules also explain when to 

 

81 

use “that” and when to use “which.” See page 99. “That” is restrictive and is used 
without a comma; “which” is nonrestrictive and is used with a comma.)

 
Those rules often lead to confusion, because the same sentence can be 
punctuated more than one way and still be correct, depending on its meaning.

Restrictive:	

John  and  Mary  did  not  marry  because  they  wanted  money. 
(Meaning: they married for some other reason.) 

Nonrestrictive:  John  and  Mary  did  not  marry,  because  they  wanted  money. 
(Meaning: they did not marry, and the reason was that they 
wanted money.) 

Restrictive:	

I am not taking that course of action because I distrust Harry’s 
motives. (Meaning: the reason I am not taking that action is 
not distrust of Harry’s motives.)

Nonrestrictive:  I am not taking that course of action, because I distrust Harry’s 
motives. (Meaning: I am not taking that course of action, and 
the reason is distrust of Harry’s motives.)

(No Comma):	 We	first	address	defendant’s	argument	that	the	evidence	should	
have  been  suppressed  because  it  derived  from  an  unlawful 
police-citizen encounter. (Here, the “because clause” explains 
why the evidence should have been suppressed, not why it is 
addressed	first.)

(Comma):	

We	 first	 address	 defendant’s	 argument	 that	 the	 evidence	
should have been suppressed, because it is dispositive. (Here, 
the “because clause” explains why the argument is addressed 
first,	not	why	it	should	have	been	suppressed.)

In some situations, use or omission of a comma can cue the reader about the 

 
relationship between two clauses and accordingly prevent misreading. Compare 
the following two examples:

Defendant  argues  that  the  trial  court  erred  because  he  presented  adequate 
exculpatory evidence.

Defendant now argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to con-
trovert, because he failed to preserve any challenge to the suppression ruling.

In	the	first	example,	the	“because	clause”	explains	the	“that	clause”	element	

	
of the main clause (i.e., why the trial court arguably erred). By contrast, in the 
second example, the “because clause” explains the main subject and verb of the 
main clause (i.e., why defendant is making the argument).

5. 

Parenthetical Elements

a. 

Interrupting Parenthetical Elements

Either	use	two	commas	or	no	commas	to	set	off	parenthetical	
	
elements that interrupt a clause or phrase. (Parenthetical elements include 
nonrestrictive appositives and nonrestrictive clauses.) Generally, longer 
parenthetical	elements	should	be	set	off	by	commas,	while	shorter	
parenthetical elements may go without any.

Correct:	 The  state  argues,  as  an  alternative  basis  for  its  second 
assignment  of  error,  that  the  trial  court  should  not  have 
suppressed the computer disk because it was in plain view 
when	the	officers	searched	defendant’s	apartment.

Correct:	 The  state  argues  alternatively  that  Article  I,  section  9, 

does not require suppression in these circumstances.

Incorrect:	 The state cites as an alternative ground justifying suppres-

sion, Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.

Correct:	 The  state  cites,  as  an  alternative  ground  justifying  sup-
pression, Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.

b. 

Introductory Parenthetical Elements 

The longer the introductory parenthetical element, the more 
 
helpful	it	is	to	set	it	off	with	a	comma.	If	omitting	a	comma	could	lead	to	
misreading, include it.

Yesterday	I	finished	cleaning	out	my	desk.

First, defendant objects to the denial of his motion to strike.

ORS 123.456(7) sets out, in part, the following:

When	this	case	was	before	the	trial	court	for	the	first	time,	defendant	
was sentenced to death. 

c. 

Setting Out “Inc.” Before Parentheticals

 

Usually “Inc.” is set out with two commas, e.g.,

Time, Inc., is the parent company. 

 

83 

But when “Inc.” is followed by a parenthetical element, omit the 

 
second comma, e.g., 

Defendants  Borg-Warner  Automotive,  Inc.  (Borg-Warner)  and 
Tenneco  Automotive  Operating  Company,  Inc.  (Tenneco)  allegedly 
manufactured *  *  *.

6. 

Appositives

An	appositive	points	out	the	same	person	or	thing	by	a	different	name.	

 
Whether to use commas with an appositive depends on whether it is restrictive or 
nonrestrictive, which is a question of meaning. Compare the following examples:

My	sister	Jill	conducted	firefighter	qualification	tests	last	weekend.

My mother, Doris, stands on her head every day.

In	the	first	example,	the	absence	of	commas	indicates	that	“Jill”	is	

 
restrictive (or necessary), because the author has more than one sister and so 
“Jill”	identifies	which	of	the	sisters	is	being	referred	to.	In	the	second	example,	
the author has only one mother, so the commas indicate that “Doris” adds only 
additional, parenthetical information.

D. 

Dashes

Dashes are most commonly used to amplify and explain ideas, digress from the 

 
main idea, or create an abrupt break or sudden change in a sentence:

He spent several hours explaining his case–a case that he knew could not be won.

The attorney–who had been waiting three hours for a ruling on the motion–entered the 
courtroom in an angry mood.

A space can be added before and after a dash when used as punctuation in the text 

 
of a slip opinion; however, when published in the Advance Sheets, those spaces will be 
removed. In slip opinions, use two hyphens “--” not the typographical “–” dash.

Punctuating	Lists

Lists may be set out in several ways. Remember that lists that consist of items 

 
that are themselves sentences can always be written as separate sentences. Otherwise, the 
following guidelines may be helpful:

• 

If a list is introduced by a complete grammatical thought, use a colon at the 
end of the introductory sentence. If the list is not introduced by a complete 
grammatical thought, then a colon may NOT be used.

Correct:	

Correct:	

Defendant assigns error to three rulings: (1) the denial of his 
motion to disqualify Dr. Demento as an expert; (2) the denial 
of  his  motion  to  suppress  chemical  evidence;  and  (3)  the 
granting	of	plaintiff’s	motion	for	a	new	trial.

Defendant assigns as error (1) the denial of his motion to dis-
qualify Dr. Demento as an expert; (2) the denial of his motion 
to suppress chemical evidence; and (3) the granting of plain-
tiff’s	motion	for	a	new	trial.

Incorrect:	

Defendant assigns error to: (1) the denial of his motion to dis-
qualify Dr. Demento as an expert; (2) the denial of his motion 
to suppress chemical evidence; and (3) the granting of plain-
tiff’s	motion	for	a	new	trial.

 

87 

• 

• 

•	

Items in a list may be, but are not required to be, numbered. 

Generally, items in a list, whether numbered or not and whether introduced 
by a colon or not, may be separated by either semicolons or commas. If 
the items are long or contain internal punctuation, it may be clearer to use 
semicolons.

The	first	item	in	a	list	should	not	begin	with	an	uppercase	letter,	unless	the	
items are full sentences. See also page 59.

The trial court announced three ground rules: Witnesses were to be excluded 
from the courtroom; only three members of the press were to be allowed in the 
courtroom at any time; and lions would be admitted only if accompanied by 
tigers and bears.

See also pages 78 through 84 for discussion of the proper use of colons and 

 
commas.

G.	

Punctuating	Parenthetical	Elements

 
Nonrestrictive parenthetical elements (that is, parenthetical elements that give 
additional	information	but	are	not	necessary	to	identify	the	antecedent)	can	be	set	off	
by commas, dashes, or parentheses. If a parenthetical element has a close logical and 
syntactic relation to the rest of the sentence, then use commas. Dashes indicate a more 
remote relation, and parentheses still more remote.

 

See also pages 83 to 84 for discussion of parenthetical elements.

H.	

Semicolons

1. 

Use a semicolon to separate two independent clauses not joined by a 
conjunction, e.g.,

The	defendant	refused	to	testify;	he	later	was	convicted	of	murder	in	the	first	
degree.

2. 

If the elements in a series are long and complex or contain internal 
punctuation, then they are separated by semicolons, rather than by commas, 
e.g.,

Defendant	 was	 charged	 with	 three	 counts	 of	 rape	 in	 the	 first	 degree,	 ORS	
163.375;	 two	 counts	 of	 sexual	 abuse	 in	 the	 first	 degree,	 ORS	 163.427;	 two	
counts of rape in the third degree, ORS 163.355; and one count of sexual abuse 
in the third degree, ORS 163.355.

 

88 

3. 

A semicolon precedes the words however, therefore, hence, thus, 
accordingly, and besides, when used to introduce a clause. A comma 
follows, e.g.,

The Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case; therefore, the Court of 
Appeals had to decide the case for a second time.

The  trial  judge  refused  to  suppress  the  evidence;  thus,  defendant  was  con-
victed on all counts.

 

89 

III. Word Usage and Conventions

A.  Word Pairs

A / An

The	indefinite	article	“a”	is	used	before	words	that	begin	with	a	consonant,	

	
words with a pronounced h and a long u sound (eu) or with words such as “one.”

a historical; a habitual; a union; a Eucharist; a one-time deal

 

“An” is used before words beginning with a vowel or an unsounded “h.”

an eagle; an appellate judgment; an hour; an heir; an honor

The article that precedes an acronym or initialism depends on how the 

 
abbreviation reads: If it is pronounced beginning with a vowel sound, then use 
“an.” If it is pronounced beginning with a consonant sound, then use “a.” For 
examples, see page 75.

A / From a

“Defendant appeals a judgment *  *  *.”

“Defendant appeals from a judgment *  *  *.”

Either is correct. If the authoring judge has a preference, then use the 

 
construction that the judge prefers.

Absent	/	Without

 

“Without” or “in the absence of” is preferred.

Without any arguments against doing so, the trial court dismissed the jury.

or

NOT

In the absence of any arguments against doing so, the trial court dismissed the 
jury.

Absent any arguments against doing so, the trial court dismissed the jury.

 

90 

Administrative	Law	Judge	/	Hearing	Officer

 

In Oregon since 2003, the title “administrative law judge” is now used.

Affect	/	Effect

“Affect”	is	a	verb	that	means	to	have	an	influence	on,	to	bring	about	a	

	
change in, or to touch or move the emotions of.

The	trial	was	affected	by	the	constant	media	attention.

	
“Effect”	is	most	commonly	used	as	a	noun,	but	it	can	also	be	used	as	a	verb.	
As a noun it means something that is brought about by a cause or agent; a result or 
outcome. As a verb it means to achieve a result, to execute, or to cause to occur.

Noun:	 Her	closing	argument	had	no	effect	on	the	jury’s	final	decision.

Verb:	 The	attorney	was	unable	to	effect	any	change	in	the	system.

Allow / Grant

 

 

Alternate / Alternative

 
providing a choice.

Although / While

Typically, allow is used to refer to a ruling on a petition.

Grant is used to refer to a ruling on a motion.

“Alternate” means every other or substitute, while “alternative” means 

She takes early lunch during alternate weeks.

An alternative approach is to take no lunch at all.

“Although” more properly introduces an aside; “while” is more properly 

 
used only in a temporal sense.

Although	many	people	disagree,	Ian	thinks	that	coffee	is	good	for	you.

While I was in Paris, I decided to become a can can dancer.

 

91 

Amicus Curiae / Amici Curiae (Friend/s of the Court)

1. 

Amicus curiae	can	be	used	in	two	different	ways,	either	as	an	adjective	
describing the brief, or as a noun designating the party or person 
immediately following, e.g.,

J.	Marcus	Cool,	of	Cool,	Hand	and	Luke,	Portland,	filed	an	amicus curiae brief 
on behalf of American Theatre Institute.

Sherman	Potter,	of	Potter	&	Daughter,	P.C.,	Portland,	filed	a	brief	on	behalf	of	
amicus curiae Oregon Tempest in a Teapot Association.

2. 

Amici curiae is the plural form used in the same way.

J.	 Marcus	 Cool,	 of	 Cool,	 Hand	 and	 Luke,	 Portland,	 filed	 an	 amici  curiae 
brief  on  behalf  of American  Theatre  Institute, Americans  for  Good  Theatre 
Association, and Oregon Actors Association.

Sherman	Potter,	of	Potter	&	Daughter,	P.C.,	Portland,	filed	a	brief	on	behalf	of	
amici curiae Oregon Tempest in a Teapot Association, Oregonians-R-Us, Inc., 
and We are the World Foundation.

NOTE: The number of parties, not the number of briefs, dictates the use of 
singular or plural. It is acceptable to use amicus curiae or amici curiae	for	the	first	
reference and amicus or amici thereafter.

Appeal / Review

A party “appeals” from a lower court as of right, but a party “seeks review” 

 
in court of the action of an administrative agency or when the higher court has 
discretion whether to take the case. The related documents are called “notice 
of appeal” and “petition for judicial review” (in the case of an administrative 
proceeding) or “petition for review” (in the case of a petition to the Oregon 
Supreme Court).

Within an administrative system, the correct term is “appeal.” For example, a 

 
party may “appeal” to the Workers’ Compensation Board from the order of an ALJ.

Appeals / Appeals from

Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction. 

Defendant appeals from a judgment.

 

Either one is acceptable.

 

92 

Because	/	Since

 

“Because” explains why; “since” expresses time.

Because he attended seven basketball games, David had a busy weekend.

Since	moving	to	a	window	office,	John	has	been	much	more	productive.

Between / Among

As a general rule, “between” is used when the sentence involves two things 

 
or when expressing a close relationship of any number of individual things.

The jury had to decide between the death penalty and life in prison.

His time was divided between school, sports, and work.

 

“Among” is used when the sentence involves more than two things.

His present conviction was just one among many.

Her estate was divided among all her relatives.

The above rule expresses the distinction between “between” and “among” 

 
in	a	simplistic	manner.	Here	are	a	couple	of	specific	rules:	“Between”	is	used	to	
express one-to-one relations of many things, e.g., a treaty between four powers. 
“Among”	is	used	to	express	collective	and	undefined	relations,	e.g., She was the 
best among all the attorneys.

Circuit	Court	/	Trial	Court

When referring to the lower court in a particular case, use “trial court.” Use 
 
“circuit court” when referring to circuit courts generally (“The legislature created 
jurisdiction in the circuit court.”) or to general propositions about particular 
courts	(“Post-certification	challenges	to	the	constitutionality	of	initiative	measures	
generally	must	be	filed	in	Marion	County	Circuit	Court.”).	Also,	use	“circuit	
court,” not “trial court,” in tag lines. See also Post-Conviction Cases, page 104.

Cite / Cite to

NOT

 

“Cite to” is redundant; “cite” is preferred.

In Smith, the court cited ORAP 5.45.

In Smith, the court cited to ORAP 5.45.

 

93 

Compose / Comprise

 

 

 

 

 

The parts compose the whole; the whole comprises the parts.

The whole is composed of the parts; the parts comprise the whole.

The most common error is using “comprise” when “compose” is correct:

Incorrect:	

Judge  Haselton,  Judge  Armstrong,  and  Judge  Duncan 
comprise Department One.

Correct:	

Judge Haselton, Judge Armstrong, and Judge Duncan compose 
Department One.

Incorrect:	

Department  One  is  comprised  of  Judge  Haselton,  Judge 
Armstrong, and Judge Duncan.

Correct:	

Department  One  is  composed  of  Judge  Haselton,  Judge 
Armstrong, and Judge Duncan.

Correct:	

Department One comprises Judge Haselton, Judge Armstrong, 
and Judge Duncan.

Consecutively	to	/	Concurrently	with

A consecutive sentence is served “consecutively to” another sentence:

The trial court ordered that defendant’s 12-month sentence under the sentenc-
ing guidelines for theft be served consecutively to his Measure 11 sentences.

A concurrent sentence is served “concurrently with” another sentence:

The trial court imposed aggregated sentences totaling 36 months, all of which 
were to be served concurrently with the burglary sentences.

Consistent With / Consistently With

For adverbial uses, “consistently with” (that is, “in a manner consistent 

 
with”) is correct.

The court decided the case consistently with its precedent. (in a manner con-
sistent with its precedent)

 

94 

Criterion / Criteria

 
one factor.

Datum / Data

“Criteria” is plural; accordingly, it may not be used when discussing only 

The	court	primarily	relied	on	the	first	criterion.

 

“Data” is plural and takes a plural verb.

The	data	support	plaintiff’s	theory.

Decree	/	Judgment

Historically, equitable proceedings resulted in “decrees,” while legal 

 
proceedings resulted in “judgments.” The distinction between law and equity 
was abolished in Oregon in 1980. See	ORCP	2.	The	final	determination	in	all	
civil actions is now titled a “judgment.” Some statutes still use the term “decree,” 
and occasionally so do trial courts. The appellate courts, however, will substitute 
the word “judgment.” E.g., Webber v. Olsen, 330 Or 189, 192 n 1, 998 P2d 666 
(2000); State ex rel Olson v. Renda, 171 Or App 713, 715 n 3, 17 P3d 514 (2000).

“Disinterested” means lacking a stake in an outcome. “Uninterested” means 

Disinterested / Uninterested

 
bored.

The judge appointed a disinterested arbitrator.

Driver’s	License	/	Driving	Privileges

Different	statutes	use	different	terms;	they	are	not	interchangeable.	For	

	
example, when a person fails or refuses a breath test, the Oregon Department of 
Transportation suspends the person’s “driving privileges,” not his or her “license.” 
Check the statute at issue for the correct term.

Employe / Employee

 
In older statutes and opinions, the spelling of certain words (e.g., 
employee / employe, subpoena / subpena) was changed to enable faster data entry. 
After the advent of word processing, those types of words were restored to their 
original spelling. It is correct, however, to use those shortened spellings when 
directly quoting those sources or to bracket in the missing letters. 

 

95 

Expedient	/	Expeditious

 
“Expedient” means that a particular course of action is a practical solution 
to a problem; it also has overtones of side-stepping tough choices. “Expeditious” 
means speedy.

The lawyers decided that it would be expedient to waive oral argument.

The court must decide all cases in an expeditious manner.

Fewer / Less Than

“Fewer” denotes countable things; “less” denotes things that can’t easily be 

 
counted. However, it is customary to use “less” for time, money, and distance.

If you have 10 items or fewer, then you can go to the express lane.

I have less money than you.

Finding / Holding

	
to particular facts.

A	“finding”	is	a	factual	determination;	a	“holding”	is	an	application	of	law	

The	trial	court	found	that	the	officer	lacked	subjective	probable	cause.

The Court of Appeals held (not found) that the search was invalid because the 
officer	lacked	subjective	probable	cause.

General statements of law unconnected to particular facts are not holdings.

The Supreme Court stated (not held) that probable cause has both an objective 
and a subjective component. 

“Determination” can refer to either. 

Forgo / Forego

“Forgo” means to do without. 

 

 

 

 

I would rather eat late, than to forgo lunch altogether.

“Forego” means to go before.

Based  on  the  crowds  lining  the  streets  to  catch  a  glimpse  of  Justin  Bieber 
entering the courthouse, it is obvious that his reputation foregoes him.

 

96 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If . . . Was / Were

See Subjunctive Mood, page106.

Implicitly	/	Impliedly

“Implicitly” is preferred.

In Light of / In the Light of

“In light of” is preferred.

Loath / Loathe

The	court’s	ruling	implicitly	indicated	several	factual	findings.

“Loath” means unwilling or reluctant: 

I am loath to go to the meeting today.

“Loathe” means to strongly dislike or hate something:

I loathe the thought of eating tofu.

May / Might

“May” expresses authority.

The Secretary of State may certify a ballot measure.

“Might” expresses possibility.

The Secretary of State might resign tomorrow.

Of / For

Most authorities consider the following to be more correct:

Defendant was convicted of three counts of assault.

Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for assault.

 

97 

Over / Under–More Than / Less Than 

Generally, “over” and “under” are used in spatial relationships; they do not 

 
take the place of “more than” or “less than.” 

The train traveled rapidly over miles of desert terrain.

The battleship drifted under the bridge.

The attorney has more than (not over) $5,000 in outstanding legal fees.

He had less than (not under) $20 in his pocket.

 

Pleaded is the preferred form.

Pleaded / Pled

Portion / Part

A “portion” is a piece of a whole that can be divided into shares, as an 

 
estate or a pie. A “part” is a more general term that connotes something less than 
the whole.

Jenny argued that she had been deprived of her rightful portion of the estate.

Scott contended that he owned the part of the property beyond the fence.

Jim challenged the part of the judgment that prohibited wearing bow ties.

That part of the statute supports defendant’s argument.

Proved / Proven

 
participle of prove.

Right / Authority

“Proven” is an adjective, while “proved” remains the accepted past 

Her attorney is a proven winner.

The prosecuting attorney has proved his case.

Generally, individuals have “rights” (e.g., the right against self-

 
incrimination, the right to bear arms); however a governmental body or 
representative needs “authority” to act (e.g., a question of whether a city had 
authority to take property by eminent domain).

 

98 

Since	/	Because

 

“Because” explains why; “since” expresses time.

Because he attended seven basketball games, David had a busy weekend.

Since	moving	to	a	window	office,	John	has	been	much	more	productive.	

That / This; Those / These

“That” is used as a demonstrative pronoun to refer to thought expressed 

 
earlier:

 

 

That	/	Which

The letter was unopened; that in itself casts doubt on the inspector’s theory.

“This” is used when the referent is yet to be mentioned:

This is what bothers me: We have no time to consider late applications.

“Those” and “these” are similarly distinguishable.

Defendant relied on three statutes in his motion. The trial court relied on those 
statutes, as well as two others.

These	are	the	problems	with	plaintiff’s	arguments:	The	arguments	were	not	raised	
to the trial court, they are unsupported by legal authority, and they are wrong.

 
“That” introduces a restrictive clause (a clause that is necessary in context to 
the meaning of the sentence). Commas are not used with a restrictive “that clause.” 

The decision that the judge made regarding suppression of evidence was con-
trary to the legal standard.

“Which” introduces a nonrestrictive clause (a clause that can be omitted 

 
without changing the meaning of the sentence). Commas are required with a 
nonrestrictive “which clause.” 

The decision, which caught the legal community by surprise, was contrary to 
the legal standard.

 

99 

The	meaning	to	be	conveyed,	not	grammatical	differences,	dictate	when	to	
use “that” and “which.” Sometimes the same sentence can correctly use either, 
depending on meaning.

The lawnmower that I borrowed is in the garage. (Correct if there are many 
lawnmowers under discussion and it is necessary for clarity to identify the one 
borrowed.)

The lawnmower, which I borrowed, is in the garage. (Correct if there is only 
one  lawnmower  under  discussion  and  adjectival  clause  serves  only  to  give 
extra information.)

 

See also discussion of commas on page 79.

Who / Whom

 
“Who” is used as a subject. “Whom” is used as an object of a verb or 
preposition. When in doubt about which to use, try rethinking the sentence using 
“he” or “him.”

Who is listening? 
(Is he listening?)

Defendant, who was not present in the courtroom, was found guilty. 
(Defendant–he was not present in the courtroom–was found guilty.)

A woman who I think is a genius wrote this sentence. 
(A woman–I think she is a genius–wrote this sentence.)

He asked whom he should speak to. 
(He should speak to him.)

 

Use “that,” not “who” or “whom,” when the antecedent is not a person.

The bank that Kym uses gives away free blenders with new checking accounts.

Christy sued the company that made the defective golf clubs.

B.	 Word	Functions

1. 

One Word or Two Words

 

 

 

 

“Case Law” and “Grid Block” are always two words (unless being quoted).

“Cannot”

Cannot is used as one word, except when using a “not only” construction:

We cannot reach unpreserved error.

She can not only pitch, but she can catch, too.

Other words are usually spelled as one word, such as: 

caseworker,	 factfinder,	 forestlands,	 handwritten,	 insofar,	 landowner,	 lien-
holder, online, overarching, passersby, pickup, policyholder, statewide, time-
frame, timeline, timesheet, voicemail, and website 

 
Some words, however, are either one word or two, depending on how they 
function within the sentence: e.g., clean up, set over, set back, day care, pat down:

The cleanup crew arrived early to start the clean up.

The trial was set over until tomorrow. The defendant requested a setover.

The setback requirement provides for a six foot easement. The house was set 
back	from	the	property	line	by	five	feet.

Her mother provides day care both privately and at a local daycare center. 

The	subject	was	pat	down	by	the	officer.	The	officer	who	performed	the	pat-
down	testified	that	he	found	a	knife.

2. 

Contractions

Appellate opinions are formal documents and, accordingly, do not use 

 
contractions. When quoting, however, if the original uses contractions, use those 
contractions in the quotation.

 

101 

C.  Word Usage

Language

“Language” technically refers to English, French, Spanish, etc. Although 

 
frequently used in constructions such as “the language of ORS 809.222,” it is more 
correct to use “the wording of ORS 809.222” or “the text of the statute.”

Letter Opinion

Only

“Letter opinion” is preferred to “opinion letter.”

The	placement	of	“only”	can	change	the	meaning	of	a	sentence.	It	modifies	

	
the word or phrase that comes immediately after it, so it should be placed 
accordingly to avoid ambiguity. 

The jurisdiction of the court is constrained only by statute.
(That means that the only thing limiting the court’s jurisdiction is statute.)

The jurisdiction of the court is only constrained by statute.
(That	means	that	there	are	other	effects	on	the	court’s	jurisdiction,	but	the	one	
way	that	statutes	affect	jurisdiction	is	by	constraining	it.)

The statute only pertains to state actors.
(That is unlikely to express what the author means. It communicates that the 
statute	only	pertains,	but	does	not	have	some	other	effect.)

The statute pertains to only state actors.
(That is more likely to express the author’s meaning. It communicates that the 
only actors to whom the statute pertains are “state” actors.)

The statute pertains only to state actors.
(That is an alternative author’s meaning. It communicates that the only cate-
gory of people to whom the statute pertains is “state actors.”)

Parameter(s)

This word will almost never be correct in legal writing; it is a technical 

 
scientific	and	mathematical	term.	When	tempted	to	use	it,	try	“limits,”	
“boundaries,” or “borders.”

The principles of justiciability and preservation keep judicial analysis within 
relatively	confined	boundaries	(not	parameters).

 

102 

Parties,	Victims,	Children,	and	Law	Enforcement

 
Generally, refer to parties to a case using their position in the lower 
tribunal	(plaintiff,	defendant,	claimant,	etc.).	Exceptions	include	the	following:	
(1) domestic relations cases, in which the parties are referred to as “husband” 
and “wife”; (2) civil commitment proceedings, in which the person for whom 
commitment is sought is referred to by his or her position on appeal (appellant, 
respondent); (3) termination of parental rights proceedings, in which the parents 
are referred to as “mother” and “father” and the children are referred to as 
“child”	or	“children”	or	sometimes	by	their	first	initials;	(4)	juvenile	delinquency	
proceedings, in which a person alleged to be within juvenile court jurisdiction is 
referred to as “youth”; (5) juvenile dependency proceedings, in which a minor is 
referred to as “child”; and (6) adoption cases, in which “child” is used.

Additionally, when a word indicating a party’s role in the lower proceeding 

 
or	on	appeal	or	review	is	used	as	a	substitute	for	the	party’s	name,	the	definite	
article “the” is not used (e.g.,	plaintiff,	petitioner,	etc.).	When	using	an	abbreviated	
name (not party designation), use “the” as in, “the state,” “the superintendent.”

Do not use the full names of victims. The following references are 

 
acceptable: 

the victim
the	first	or last name, but not both
an initial (the initial may, but need not, be related to the victim’s name)

In dependency and termination cases, and criminal cases involving a 

 
child victim or witness, do not use the names of children. Instead, use an initial. 
For readability, it is preferred to use a single initial, which may, but need not, be 
related to the victim’s name. If an author would like to use two initials (e.g., to 
differentiate	among	siblings	whose	first	names	begin	with	the	same	letter),	then	do	
not use periods (AG, AM, etc.).

In the following types of cases, do not use the name of a person who is 

 
protected by a court order (or similar); instead, use a role-based description, such 
as “petitioner,” or an initial: Family Abuse Prevention Act (FAPA) (including 
violation of restraining order), stalking (including violation of a stalking order), 
Elder Persons and Persons with Disabilities Abuse Prevention Act (EPPDAPA), 
registration of a foreign restraining order, and Sexual Abuse Protection Order 
(SAPO).

When	referring	to	specific	law	enforcement	personnel,	use	the	correct	title,	

	
e.g.,	officer,	deputy,	trooper,	detective,	etc.

 

103 

Post-Conviction	Cases

When referring to the circuit court in a post-conviction proceeding, “post-

 
conviction court” is preferred to “post-conviction trial court.” The petitioner in a 
post-conviction case is referred to as “petitioner” and the defendant is referred to 
as “the superintendent,” or “the state.”

“Previous” and “prior” as adjectives are equally acceptable.

Father’s parental rights had been terminated in a prior (or previous) proceeding.

“Prior to” is disfavored; “before” is preferred.

Wife	withdrew	joint	funds	from	a	checking	account	before	(not	prior	to)	filing	
for dissolution.

“That” as a relative pronoun or relative adverb is sometimes suppressed in 

 
informal writing; the preferred practice in opinions is to include it.

The court held that the evidence had been wrongly admitted.

Defendant  admitted  at  oral  argument  that  that  proposition  was  subject  to 
debate.

D. 

Variant Spellings

Use kidnapping, not kidnaping.

Use marshalling, not marshaling.

Previous / Prior

Prior to / Before

That

IV.	Common	Grammatical	and	Style	Problems

A.	

Collective	Nouns

Collective nouns require singular verbs when the group is functioning as a unit. 
 
When individual members of the group are acting independently, a plural verb is used. 
If a sentence seems awkward, then insert the words “members of” before the collective 
noun and use the plural verb. Some common examples of collective nouns are:

court 

The court is not in session today.

The members of the court are in conference.

majority 
 
 

The majority states that the assignment of error was not preserved for  
review.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The author of the majority is mistaken on that issue.

jury 

The jury has adjourned for the day. 

The members of the jury have adjourned for the day.

council  

The Council on Court Procedures has adopted new rules.

The members of the council have adopted new rules.

B.	

Parallel	Construction

Sentence parts must match if a sentence is to make logical sense. Therefore, parts 

 
of a sentence that are parallel in meaning are parallel in structure.

Incorrect:	

Correct:	

The court held that the taxpayer was guilty of failing to report income, 
claiming  fraudulent  deductions,  and  in  the  treatment  of  ordinary 
income as capital gain.

The court held that the taxpayer was guilty of failing to report income, 
claiming fraudulent deductions, and treating ordinary income as capi-
tal gain. 

C.	

Passive	Voice

Avoid using the passive voice whenever possible. The passive voice can create 

 
ambiguity about who is doing the acting in a sentence. See State ex rel Click v. Brownhill, 
331 Or 500, 509, 15 P3d 990 (2000) (Durham, J., concurring) (ambiguity in statute arose 
because of the use of the phrase “shall not be used”; through use of passive voice, legislature 
failed to identify who “shall not use”). See also discussion of Active Voice, page 107.

 

105 

D.	

Verbs

1.  Was/Were Agreement:

Ringo Starr argued the cause for the appellant. With him on the brief was The 
Beatles LLP.

Mick Jagger argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Keith 
Richards and the Rolling Stones, PC.

2. 

Past Perfect Tense

 
perfect tense is used.

When referring to an action completed before another past time, the past 

Incorrect:	

Petitioner	testified	at	the	post-conviction	hearing	that	he	asked	
his trial lawyer to investigate his alibi defense.

Correct:	

Petitioner	testified	at	the	post-conviction	hearing	that	he	had	
asked his trial lawyer to investigate his alibi defense.

NOTE: Depending on context, past-perfect tense might not be necessary. For 
example, if describing testimony, the point is to describe an event that happened 
in the past, not that the event happened in the past relative to some other time. For 
example,	“John	testified	that	the	light	was	green.

3. 

Subjunctive Mood

For a much more complete explanation of the proper use of the subjunctive, 

 
see Garner, A Dictionary of Modern American Usage. One situation in which the 
subjunctive is generally correct is to express a condition that is contrary to fact or 
hypothetical:

If Mary were queen of the world, then everyone would want to obey her. 

If the court were to take notice of defendant’s arguments, then it would ignore 
long-standing principles of preservation.

 

Not every “if” clause takes the subjunctive, however:

If defendant was a resident of Oregon in 1999, then he must pay taxes for that 
year.

 

106 

E.	

Active	Voice

 
In the active voice, the subject of a sentence or clause performs the action of the 
verb. In the passive voice, the subject of a sentence or clause is not the actor. Generally, 
the passive voice is wordier and may be vague. The active voice is clearer and stronger 
and tells who did what to whom. See also page 105.

Active:		

I missed the deadline.

Passive: 

The deadline was missed.

F. 

Gender-Neutral Wording

Gender-neutral terms are preferred, and gender-based pronouns are avoided except 

 
when	referring	to	a	specific	person.	Use	“he	or	she”	only	when	all	other	constructions	
fail.

 

For example, use

letter carrier, not mailman 
 
flight	attendant,	not	stewardess	 	

worker, not workman
sales	clerk,	not	salesman

G.	

Informal	or	Technical	Terminology

An	appellate	opinion	is	a	formal	document.	Its	content	reflects	that	formality. 
	
For example, instead of using the word “said” or “says,” use the word “states” or “stated” 
(or any of the words listed below depending on the context of the sentence):

 
adds 
argues   
compares 
concludes	
continues 
declares 
disagrees 

 
 
 
	
 
 
 

emphasizes 
establishes 
explains 
	
finds	
 
insists 
maintains 
notes 

 

 
 
 
	
 
 
 

observes
opines
points out
posits
proposes
suggests
thinks

When using technical terms or terms of art, explain those terms.

 

 

107 

GLOSSARY

(These terms are used internally in appellate opinion drafting, Judicial 
Assistant and Law Clerk materials, on the website, etc., but may or may 
not be referred to elsewhere in this manual.)

Advance	Notice–A one-day advance notice of Oregon Appellate Court cases scheduled 
to be released that is posted on the OJD Publications website–usually Tuesday of each 
week for Court of Appeals cases and Wednesday of each week for Supreme Court cases.

Advance	Sheets–Opinions of cases issued weekly by the Oregon Appellate Courts, 
including, as issued, both the Regular and Magistrate Divisions of the Oregon Tax 
Court, and compiled together into a softbound book that is published bimonthly by the 
Publications Program. Advance Sheets are available by subscription or by issue.

Affirmed	by	an	Equally	Divided	Court–When an even number of justices or judges 
meet to decide a case, a situation can arise where the court is evenly split regarding its 
disposition.	In	that	event,	the	case	will	be	considered	affirmed,	and	no	majority	written	
opinion will be issued.

AWOP–Term	of	art	used	in	the	Court	of	Appeals	to	refer	to	cases	that	are	affirmed	
without opinion. No precedential value is accorded those decisions, which are published 
by case caption and number only.

Bluebook–Shorthand reference to the citation manual, The Bluebook, A Uniform System 
of Citation, which is published and distributed by the Harvard Law Review Association.

Citation–Form	by	which	authoritative	sources	are	identified	for	easy	reference.	For	the	
most part, Oregon Appellate Courts do not use periods in citations.

A string	citation is a proscribed order listing more than one authority to support a legal 
position (usually set out starting with strength of authority, jurisdiction, rank of court, and 
date) and often introduced with a signal.

A parallel	citation	is	an	additional	reference	to	the	same	case	published	by	a	different	source.	

A full	citation	sets	out	the	official	source	followed	by	a	parallel	source.

A short	form	citation is a subsequent reference to a case already set out in full and is a less 
complete	citation	but	which	still	clearly	identifies	the	referenced	material.

A jump	or	pinpoint	citation	refers	to	the	specific	page	on	which	a	legal	authority	is	cited.

 

108 

Common Law–Law created by judicial opinions, not statutes. Hyphenate when using 
this term as an adjective before a noun.

Cost	Box–Printed on title page of slip opinion and used to designate expense costs (not 
attorney fees) that are allowed by the court. This information is not published in the 
Advance Sheets or the Oregon Reports.

Court of Appeals–In Oregon, an intermediate appellate court that has jurisdiction to hear 
most civil and criminal appeals from circuit court (exceptions include death-penalty cases 
and Tax Court appeals) and review most state administrative agency actions. Its primary 
function is the correction of error by the application of principles of law; formulation of 
law is a secondary function performed as required for deciding cases.

Department–A department is a group of three judges in the Court of Appeals, designated 
by the Chief Judge, that generally hears and decides cases together. If a member of a 
department must be recused or is unavailable for any reason, the Chief Judge will assign 
another judge to sit on a particular case. Accordingly, the “panel” of judges that hears and 
decides a case may or may not correspond to the make-up of the “department” to which 
the case is assigned. One judge in each department is the “presiding judge.” The presiding 
judge presides at oral argument, makes written case assignments, and administers the 
department. Each department has a number, which appears, among other places, on the 
court’s oral argument calendar, and a color, which corresponds to the color of the cover 
sheet on its draft opinions. Department 1 is pink; Department 2 is blue, Department 3 is 
green, and Department 4 is purple. Each department generally meets twice a month to 
discuss draft opinions circulated since the last department meeting. When all three judges 
on the panel agree that an opinion is ready, it is “approved to go down.” 

Dictum–Statements in an opinion that are not necessary to the disposition of the case.

Disposition	by	Order–A court may choose to dispose of a matter by issuing an 
order	instead	of	an	opinion.	Acceptance	of	Certified	Questions	or	Appeals,	issuance	
of Alternative Writs of Mandamus, amendments of typographical errors, and the 
certification	of	ballot	titles	are	examples	of	such	orders.

Discretionary	Review–Indicates that a court chooses whether or not to review a case.

En	Banc–Cases in which all available judges participate in the consideration and vote on 
the outcome.

 

109 

Footnotes–Notes at the bottom of a page citing or commenting on the part of the text to 
which they are referenced. Generally a footnote contains information of lesser importance 
to the larger body of work.

Full Court–In the Court of Appeals, any judge may refer to the full court an opinion 
approved to go down by a panel. The full court meets once a month to discuss cases 
referred to it. Reasons for referral include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) the 
opinion would overrule a prior case; (2) the same or similar issue is before several 
departments of the court; (3) a judge not on the panel disagrees with the result or 
reasoning. Not all cases referred to full court are taken en banc; a vote of the majority of 
the judges available to participate is required.

Magistrate Division–The Magistrate Division tries or mediates all tax appeals, unless 
the Tax Court judge assigns the case to the Regular Division. A party may appeal from 
a	magistrate’s	final	decision	to	the	judge	of	the	Tax	Court.	Hearings	in	the	Magistrate	
Division are often informal proceedings. Hearings may be by telephone or in person and 
may be held around the state. A taxpayer may choose to represent himself or herself or 
to be represented by a lawyer, public accountant, real estate broker, appraiser, or other 
individual.

Media Releases–Media releases are issued weekly and contain summaries of cases 
issued or otherwise decided by the Oregon appellate courts. Court of Appeals cases 
that	have	been	Affirmed	Without	Opinion	are	listed	by	name	and	county	of	origin	only.	
Supreme Court petitions for review allowed and denied are listed by case name and 
number. Other miscellaneous Supreme Court matters, such as public meetings, are 
included on the media releases.

Miranda–Refers to the United States Supreme Court decision Miranda v. Arizona, 384 
US 436, 86 S Ct 1602, 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966), from which the rules regarding the right to 
remain silent and the right to an attorney are taken.

On Appeal / Review–A party “appeals” from a lower court as of right, but a party “seeks 
review” in court of the action of an administrative agency or when the higher court has 
discretion whether to take the case. The related documents are called “notice of appeal” 
and “petition for judicial review” (in the case of an administrative proceeding) or 
“petition for review” (in the case of a petition to the Oregon Supreme Court). Within an 
administrative system, the correct term is “appeal.” For example, a party may “appeal” to 
the Workers’ Compensation Board from the order of an administrative law judge.

 

110 

ORAP–Acronym for Oregon Rules of Appellate Procedure. Those rules are applicable 
to proceedings in the Oregon Supreme Court and Court of Appeals and supplement the 
statutory requirements. The most recent version can be accessed on the Oregon Judicial 
Department’s website, on the Rules page.

Oregon Reports–Hardbound volumes of the opinions issued by the Oregon Appellate 
Courts,	published	separately	by	individual	court.	The	Oregon	Reports	is	the	official	
reporter	for	Oregon	case	law,	and	published	and	distributed	by	the	Office	of	the	State	
Court Administrator, Publications Program.

Parenthetical	Information–When used in relation to citation, text within parentheses 
that usually indicates alterations to text or provides explanatory statements.

Per Curiam–By the court.

Precedent–Except as provided in ORAP 10.30, all written Oregon appellate court 
opinions have the same precedential weight, whether signed or issued per curiam.

Publications–The program of the State of Oregon Law Library that is responsible 
for	publishing	the	official	version	of	the	Oregon	Appellate	Courts	opinions	(and	
miscellaneous	other	official	materials)	in	hardbound	volumes	as	the	Oregon	Reports,	in	
softbound biweekly Advance Sheets, and online.

Publications	Website–The Publications website, managed by the Publications Program, 
includes links to Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, and Tax Court opinions since 1998, 
currently in publication format (not slip opinion format). The page numbers in opinions 
on the Publications website can slightly vary from the page numbers ultimately used in 
the Oregon Reports, due to minor edits that might be made after an opinion is issued. 
The Publications website also includes links to all media releases issued by the appellate 
courts, and printable and online versions of this Style Manual.

Release Date–Date that opinions are released to the public via the Appellate Courts 
Records Section. Currently the Court of Appeals releases opinions to the public on 
Wednesdays, and the Supreme Court releases opinions to the public on Thursdays or 
other days as necessary.

Running Head–Term	of	art	used	when	referring	to	the	official	case	name	used	for	
citation purposes that is printed as part of the header information when a case gets 
published	in	the	official	reports.

 

111 

Signals–Introductory words indicating support, comparison, or contradiction of a stated 
proposition. Those words are italicized, and generally are followed by a parenthetical 
statement explaining the relevance of the citation.

Slip Opinion–Appellate	court	decisions	in	an	8½″	x	11″	format	using	the	court’s	initial	
pagination,	and	filed	in	the	electronic	case	file	as	a	document	image	linked	to	the	case	
register in the Appellate Case Management System. Once linked, the slip opinion can be 
viewed	electronically	by	the	public	in	the	Records	Office	public	viewing	station,	unless	
the	case	is	confidential.	Paper	copies	of	slip	opinions	also	are	mailed	to	the	parties.

Summary Disposition–A summary disposition is a disposition of an appeal, a judicial 
review,	or	other	proceeding	pending	in	an	appellate	court	without	full	briefing	and	
submission to the courts on the merits of the case. Summary dispositions include 
dismissals,	summary	affirmances,	and	summary	reversals.	By	various	statutes	governing	
particular	kinds	of	cases,	the	Court	of	Appeals	has	authority	to	summarily	affirm	trial	
court decisions in particular cases if the court determines that the appeal does not present 
a substantial question of law. 

Supreme Court–The	highest	court	in	Oregon	and	the	final	arbiter	of	Oregon	law.	Its	
primary function is as law-announcing forum. The Supreme Court has discretionary 
review, e.g., cases on review from the Court of Appeals; direct review, e.g., death-penalty 
cases, tax cases, and disciplinary matters; and original discretionary jurisdiction, e.g., 
mandamus, quo warranto,	habeas	corpus,	and	certified	questions.

Tag Line–The court’s formal disposition of a case. The tag line is listed both on the title 
page and as the last line of an opinion.

Tax	Court–The Tax Court is a special court that has exclusive, statewide jurisdiction to 
hear only cases that involve Oregon’s tax laws, including income taxes, corporate excise 
taxes, property taxes, timber taxes, cigarette taxes, local budget laws, and property tax 
limitations. There are no jury trials, and appeals go directly to the Supreme Court. The 
Oregon Tax Court has two divisions–the Regular Division and the Magistrate Division.

TCR / TCR-MD–Acronyms for the Tax Court rules and Tax Court Rules-Magistrate 
Division. Those rules are applicable to proceedings in the Oregon Tax Court and 
supplement statutory requirements. To the degree the wording of a Tax Court Rule 
mirrors that of an Oregon Rule of Civil Procedure, case interpretations of the Oregon 
Rules of Civil Procedure are authoritative for applying the Tax Court Rules. For 
circumstances not addressed by the Tax Court Rules-Magistrate Division, proceedings in 
the Magistrate Division defer to the guidance of the Tax Court Rules.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
