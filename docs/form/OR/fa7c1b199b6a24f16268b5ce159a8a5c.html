Assessment Script for Consecutive with Keywords

Good afternoon. Please state your full name for the record.  

 

Kyle Ray Forrester.  

Sir1, what city do you live in?  

I currently live in Missoula, Montana, but I was born and raised2 overseas.  

Exactly3 how long have you lived in Missoula, then?  

About five years. Basically4, I came to the U.S. when I was twenty-seven5  

and wound up in Montana working as a ranch hand6.  

Are you familiar7 with the Clark Fork River near Montana Highway 2008?  

Yes, extremely9 familiar. I spend a lot of time there because it reminds me  

of the river near my childhood10 home.  

9. 

Q. 

How much time would you say11 you spend on the river each year?  

10. 

A. 

I couldn’t tell you an exact average12, but I go there any chance13 I can get.  

My wife14 tells everyone that if I’m not at home or at work, you’ll find me on  

the river.  

11. 

Q.  What type of activities or hobbies15 do you spend time doing on the river?  

12. 

A. 

I’ve got a motorboat and a raft16 that I alternately17 take out on the water   

for fly-fishing, depending on the season18.  

13. 

Q. 

I want to direct your attention19 to a time you were on the water on  

 

September 24th, 2021 around dawn20. Do you recall21 that?  

14. 

A. 

I sure do. I woke22 up early that morning because I planned to spend23 the   

day fishing at my favorite spot24 on the river.  

15. 

Q. 

And what sticks out25 about that particular26 date and time for you?

16. 

A.  Well27, as I arrived at my spot, I noticed that there was already a black28    

 

Toyota Highlander parked on the embankment29, almost in the water.  

17. 

Q. 

Let me stop you there and rewind30 to how you started your morning31 on  

that particular day. What time did you leave your house?  

18. 

A. 

I left my house that morning around 5:00 a.m.32  

19. 

Q 

Did you make any stops33 along the way to the river before arriving to your  

20. 

A 

I stopped at the Clark Mini-Mart to fill35 my car up with gas and grab36 a    

sandwich to throw in my cooler37 for later that day. Then I headed north38 to the  

preferred34 fishing spot?  

river.  

21. 

Q. 

And then you started to tell us what you witnessed39 once you arrived40.    

Describe to us, with as much detail41 as you can, what you saw.  

22. 

A. 

There was this car sitting there within a couple42 of feet of the water, almost in43  

the water, and the hatchback44 of the car was open. And no one was around45.  

23. 

Q. 

Did the car appear to be in decent46 shape or was it damaged47 in some  

 

manner? Was there anything unusual48 near the car?  

24. 

A.  When I walked around to the  passenger side49, I could see that the window was  

shattered50 and glass was strewn51 about. That’s when I noticed52 the body  

beside the car.  

25. 

Q. 

I realize53 this may be difficult, but I need you to describe for the court what you  

saw with the body54. I need you to be as detailed as possible about how you found 

the body and what state55 it was in.

26. 

A. 

The body was lying there, on his back, with his feet facing56 the water. His shirt  

 

was pulled up57 around his chest and he - well, he looked awful58. He was  

purple-looking and, honestly, my first reaction was to vomit59.  

27. 

Q. 

Okay. What were your next actions60? Please walk us through61 what you did  

after your initial62 reaction to seeing the body there by the river.  

28. 

A. 

I grabbed my cell from the console63 of my car and tried to call 911, but there’s  

no service64 in that part of the woods65. So, I drove three-quarters66 of a mile to  

find a signal and then I called the police67.  

29. 

Q. 

Can you tell us what is across68 the river from the location69 where you found the 

30. 

A. 

There’s a little island70, roughly a stone’s throw71 away from the riverbank,  

where teenagers sometimes go to drink beer and have bonfires72 on the  

 

body?  

weekends.  

31. 

Q. 

Are there several73 fishing spots in that area, and if so, how close do you  

estimate74 the nearest one is to where you found the body?  

32. 

A. 

There are a few75 spots around there, including mine. The nearest one is right  

beside where the body was, maybe 75 to 10076 feet down river.  

33. 

Q. 

At any point during the morning of September 24th, 202177 did you see the  

defendant78, Marcus Wexler?  

34. 

A. 

No. I mean, not that I know of. There weren’t many people at the  

Clark Mini-Mart79, since I was there before sunrise80, and I didn’t see anyone  

on the river the entire81 time I was there.

35. 

Q. 

Sir, I am handing you what I have marked82 for identification purposes as State’s  

 

Exhibit83 2. Will you look at that for me? Take your time. What is State’s Exhibit 

2 that I handed84 you?  

36. 

A. 

It’s a statement85 of exactly what I just got through telling you, about what  

happened that morning I found the body.  

37. 

Q. 

To the best of your knowledge86, is that a true and accurate87 copy of the  

statement you gave88 to the police, once they arrived to the scene that day?  

38. 

A. 

Yes, it is. 

39. 

Q. 

I move to admit89 State’s Exhibit 2, Your Honor90. No further questions.
