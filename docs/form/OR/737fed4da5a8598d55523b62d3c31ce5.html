o secure a person’s constitutional rights and other rights, courts must provide qualified interpreters to 

persons who are unable to readily understand or communicate in the English language because of a 
non-English-speaking cultural background or a disability. ORS 45.273(1). 

 criminal defendant who does not speak English has a due process right to an interpreter to interpret 

the proceedings so that defendant can participate effectively in his or her own defense. Arizona v. 
Natividad, 111 Ariz 191 (1974). 
 
Definitions 

 
 “Interpret” and “Translate” 
 
“Interpret” is the appropriate professional term for the oral transfer of meaning from one 
language into another 
a.            Simultaneous interpretation is rendering one language into another  
               while the speaker is speaking.   
b.            In consecutive interpreting, the interpreter waits until the speaker 
               has finished before rendering one language into another. 
c.            Sight translation (also called “sight interpretation”) is the rendering of  
               written material into another spoken language or signed language.

B. 

1. 

Translate” is the appropriate professional term for the transfer of meaning from one written 
language into another written language. 
See Code Prof. Resp. for Interpreters (1995) (Applicability). Note: Several references in ORS 
do not respect the professional terminology, probably because the drafter was not familiar with 
the profession, not because the drafter intended to differentiate. 
 

2. 

“Non-English-Speaking Person”  

 “non-English-speaking person” is a person, who by reason of place of birth or culture: 

Speaks a language other than English; and 
Does not speak English with adequate ability to communicate effectively in the 
proceedings. 
ORS 45.275(9)(b) as amended by 2005 Or Laws, ch. 385, § 2 (effective June 29, 2005).

take an oath or affirmation to make a true and impartial interpretation of the proceedings in an 
understandable manner using the interpreter’s best skills and judgment in accordance with the

Prohibits Discrimination 

itle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination against people 

with disabilities in state and local government services. See 42 USC §§ 12115-12161. 

2. 

Definition of a Person with Disabilities 

 disabled individual means a person: 

With a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major 
life activities of such individual; 
With a record of such an impairment; or 
Who is regarded as having such an impairment. 

42 USC § 12102(2). 

C. 

Oregon Statutes Regarding People with Disabilities 

1. 

Similar to ADA 

regon has statutes similar to the ADA that define disability and mandate that reasonable 
accommodations be granted to those persons with disabilities. See ORS 44.545; ORS 44.547; 
ORS 659A.100; ORS 659A.103; ORS 410.060; ORS 410.710; ORS 410.715. 

2. 

ADA Definition of Disability is Broader 

ven though Oregon has statutes similar to the ADA, the ADA definition of disability is 
broader than the definition of “disabled person” in ORS 45.285(1)(c). Note: Although ORS 
uses “disabled person,” the preferred term is “person with a disability.”

Qualifications 

1. 

ASL 
 

The court must take special care to appoint an interpreter who is uniquely qualified to interpret in the 
language used by the disabled person. See People v. Rodriguez, 546 NYS2d 769 (1989)  (“[T]he level 
of communication skill of the person needing assistance must be matched with the level of 
communication skill or competency of the interpreter . . . .”). 

E. 

Interpreters for Hearing-Impaired Persons 

 

 

   

 

 

OJD Best Practices for Working with Interpreters 

 

10 of 59 

American Sign Language (ASL) is the language most commonly used by hearing-impaired 
Americans, especially those whose hearing was impaired, or who became deaf early or were 
born with the impairment. 
 

2. 

Other Manual Systems 

ther “manual communication systems” frequently used are 

•  Pidgin Sign English; 
•  Manual English; and 
•  Finger Spelling. 

3. 

Relay Interpreting 
 
“Relay interpreting” may be needed if the disabled person has never learned standard signing or 
finger spelling. For example, the disabled person may communicate only with gestures. Relay 
interpreters have studied to become experts in communicating with gesture. If the relay 
interpreter is deaf or hearing- or speech-impaired, the court should appoint a second interpreter 
to interpret the relay interpreter’s ASL into spoken English. 

4. 

Real Time Reporting or Computer-Assisted Transcription 

he court may need to appoint a real time reporter with a monitor or other projection system to 
provide a written record of a proceeding as it occurs, so that a late-deafened person who is not 
fluent in sign language may read the transcription in real time. While not considered 
“interpreting,” real time transcription may be the best or only way to provide meaningful access 
to the proceeding. 

F. 

Interpreters for Persons with Cognitive Disability 

Some persons with a cognitive disability request a “process interpreter” under the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (ADA). 

 

 

1. 

Motion and Hearing at Court’s Discretion 

TCR 7.060(1) requires a party to “notify” the court to request special accommodation under 
the ADA. The court has discretion to require a party to file a motion and may hold a hearing if 
the court determines any additional fact-finding is necessary to permit the court to respond to 
the request. 

2. 

“Meaningful” and “Necessary” Accommodation 

he court has authority to determine whether a process interpreter would be a meaningful 
accommodation. If specific facts and findings support the court’s conclusion that a process 
interpreter is not a meaningful or necessary accommodation, the court would not need to pay 
for the requested accommodation.

Uniform Trial Court Rules Require Notice 

B. 

1. 

Timeliness 

hen a person requires an interpreter or auxiliary aid, the court must be notified as soon as 
possible, but no later than 4 judicial days in advance of the proceeding. UTCR 7.060 (ADA 
accommodations); UTCR 7.070 (foreign language interpreters). 

2. 

Waiver 

he court may waive the 4-day notice requirement for good cause. UTCR 7.060; UTCR 7.070. 

C. 

Determine Whether an Interpreter is Needed  

The court may determine whether an interpreter is needed by asking open-ended questions which require 
complete or near complete sentences to be answered.  Avoid asking “yes” or “no” questions or questions that 
may be answered with only one or two words. 

1.  Suggested Questions to Ask Parties to Determine Whether an Interpreter is Needed 

a.  What has your work experience been prior to coming to Oregon? 
b.  What do you like or dislike about your present employment?

E. 

Interpreter Oath  

 

A certified or registered interpreter, upon attaining the credential (under ORS 45.291), has 
already made the oath or affirmation required by OEC Rule 604 and need not make again an 
oath or affirmation prior to the court proceeding. ORS 45.275(8) as amended by 2005 Or Laws, ch. 
385, § 2 (effective June 29, 2005). For interpreters not holding the certified or registered credential, the 
court swears the interpreter in as an officer of the court.  

The interpreter must make an oath or affirmation to “make a true and impartial interpretation of the 
proceedings in an understandable manner using the interpreter’s best skills and judgment in accordance 
with the standards and ethics of the interpreter profession.” OEC Rule 604; ORS 45.275(8) as amended 
by 2005 Or Laws, ch. 385, § 2 (effective June 29, 2005). 

The following oath (2007) is appropriate: 
(See also Appendix B for a copy of the oath.)“I solemnly swear [or affirm] that in all proceedings in the 
courts of Oregon to which I am appointed as an interpreter, I will interpret truly, accurately, 
completely, and impartially in accordance with the standards prescribed by law, the Code of

“If I am appointed as an interpreter, or assistive communications device operator, for a juror, I also 
swear [or affirm] that I will not participate personally in the jury’s deliberations, nor make any 
comment about my personal recollections of the evidence or my opinions about the outcome of this 
case. I will not disclose, retain, or comment upon anything that I hear in jury deliberations unless 
ordered to do so by the court. I promise this under the pains and penalties of perjury. I understand that 
perjury is a crime under ORS 162.065.”

Number of Interpreters Needed 

1. 

Multiple Parties Needing Same Language Interpreter 
 
a. 

Separate Interpreters 

he court can afford each party a separate interpreter if needed to avoid a conflict of 
interest. See ORS 45.273(1) (declaring a state policy to secure constitutional rights of 
person unable to readily understand or communicate in English). Please note 
“Preferred Procedure” below. 

b. 

Preferred Procedure 

o ensure uniform interpretation, an interpreter interprets the proceeding through 
closed circuit electronic transmission system, and all parties needing an interpreter 
listen by means of individual headphones. 

If an interpreter for the proceeding provides interpretation to multiple parties, another 
interpreter must be available to assist in communication between client and attorney 
during proceedings. 

G. 

Party and Witnesses Needing Interpreter 

The court should provide two interpreters for cases in which a party needs an interpreter and 
witnesses also need the same language interpreter. If only one interpreter is used, the party 
needing an interpreter would be left without the ability to consult with his or her attorney while 
the interpreter is interpreting at the witness stand. See People v. Rioz, 161 Cal App 3d 905, 207 
Cal Rptr 903 (1984) (using only one interpreter to interpret for the party and witness resulted in 
a reversal of conviction); see also State v. Dam, 111 Or App 15, 18 n.1 (1992); People v. 
Aguilar, 35 Cal 3d 785, 677 P2d 1198 (1984).

hen two interpreters are not available, for example in rural communities, then any potential 
conflict should be disclosed and any waiver put on the record. The procedure for attorney-client 
communication also should be put on the record. 

Oral Relay Interpreting 

ral relay interpreting is necessary when an interpreter is not available for the needed 

interpretation directly into English. For example, if there is no Maya-English interpreter, there 
would be two interpreters; one from Maya-Spanish and one Spanish-English.

The court should give the Uniform Criminal Jury Instruction in criminal trials in which an 
interpreter is being used for the parties or witnesses. (See also Appendix K).Instructing the 
Jury if a Jury Panel Member Knows the Language Being Interpreted 
See generally New Jersey Supreme Court Task Force on Interpreter and Translation Services, § 
1.2 (1985); Amaru v. Stratton, 209 NJ Super 1, 18, 506 A2d 1225, 1234 (1985). 

a. 

Suggested Instruction 

If any of you understand the language of the witness, disregard completely what the 
witness says in the other language. Consider as evidence only what is provided by the 
court interpreter in English.” 

b. 

Sign Language 

hen a party needs sign language interpretation and a potential juror understands sign 

language, it may not be appropriate for the potential juror to serve, because the juror 
may be able to observe and understand privileged attorney-client communications. 

An alternative solution to removing the potential juror is to provide the hearing-
impaired party real time interpretation (similar to closed caption television) if available 
and the party reads and understands English. 

c. 

Removing a Juror—ADA Implications 

efore removing a hearing-impaired juror or juror with another disability, the court 

should consider whether removal might violate the ADA’s antidiscrimination 
provisions.

a. 

b.

c. 

d. 

e. 

Court proceedings must be conducted in English; therefore, a person who does not 
speak English is not qualified to serve as a juror. The court may provide an interpreter 
so that the court can determine a potential juror’s English-speaking abilities and to 
interpret an explanation of this requirement to the potential juror. See Commonwealth v. 
Acen, 396 Mass 472, 487 NE2d 189 (1986). 
 
Challenges to allow non-English speaking persons to serve as jurors have been 
unsuccessful in some jurisdictions. These challenges have generally been based on due 
process and equal protection guarantees. Oregon’s appellate courts have not yet 
addressed this issue. See Commonwealth v. Acen, 396 Mass 472, 487 NE2d 189 (1986); 
Majorie A. Shields, Prejudicial Effect of Juror’s Inability to Comprehend English, 117 
A.L.R.5th 1 (2004). 
 

Persons who are disabled are not ineligible to act as jurors and cannot be excluded from 
the jury list or from jury service because of their disability. See ORS 10.030(3)(a); 
People v. Guzman, 76 NY2d 1, 555 NE2d 259, 556 NYS2d 7 (1990); Galloway v. 
Superior Court of the District of Columbia, 816 F Supp 12 (DDC 1993). 
 
On written request of a deaf, hearing-impaired, or speech impaired juror, and on the 
court’s finding that the juror needs an interpreter or assistive communication device, 
the court must appoint a qualified interpreter or provide an assistive communication 
device. ORS 10.115(2). 
 
The court must administer to the qualified interpreter appointed for a disabled juror an 
oath “that the interpreter will accurately communicate the proceedings to the juror and 
accurately repeat the statements of the juror.” ORS 10.115(3). 
 
Except as provided in ORS 10.115(5), a qualified interpreter appointed for a disabled 
juror must be present during deliberations by the jury on which the juror serves. The 
interpreter may not participate in the jury deliberations in any manner except to 
facilitate communication between the disabled juror and the other jurors or other 
persons with whom the jurors may communicate, and the court must so instruct the jury 
and the interpreter. ORS 10.115(4). 
 
When a disabled juror serves on a trial jury each party to the proceeding must stipulate 
to the presence of the qualified interpreter appointed for the juror during jury 
deliberations and must prepare and deliver to the court proposed instructions in respect 
to the interpreter. ORS 10.115(5). 
 

I. 

When a Party or Counsel Challenges an Interpreter 

 

1. 

If a party or counsel believes an interpretation might materially alter the meaning of the words 
or phrases interpreted, the party or counsel should bring this to the judge’s attention. 
 

OJD Best Practices for Working with Interpreters 

 

16 of 59 

b. 

The judge should conduct an inquiry outside the presence of the jury, if any, as to the 
materiality of the alleged error. If the judge finds that the error might affect the understanding 
of the trier of fact, the judge should: 
a. 

Have the question and answer at issue read; 
 
Have the challenger specify the alleged error and suggest the correct interpretation of 
the challenged material; and 
 
Inquire of the interpreter if the alternative proposed by the challenger is acceptable to 
the interpreter. 
 

c. 

If the interpreter and challenger do not reach agreement, the judge should decide which 
interpretation is proper after hearing both sides. The court should: 
a. 

Presume that the assigned interpreter’s version is correct; and 
 
Place the burden of proof on the party challenging the interpretation. If the interpreter 
challenged is not certified, the judge may call in a certified interpreter who is not 
interpreting for the proceeding to consult regarding the interpretation. See State v. Van 
Pham, et al, 234 Kan 649, 675 P2d 848 (1984). 

b. 

   

J. 

Judge’s Responsibility When Judge Believes Interpretation Incorrect 

 

If the judge believes an interpretation might materially alter the meaning of the words or phrases 
interpreted, the judge has a responsibility to act. However, the judge cannot insert himself or herself 
into the proceeding as a witness and correct the record based on the judge’s own opinion regarding how 
a phrase should be interpreted. 

The judge should conduct an inquiry outside the presence of the jury, if any, as to the 
materiality of the alleged error. The judge should: 
a. 

Have the question and answer at issue read or replayed; and  
 
Inquire of the interpreter if the interpreter stands by the interpreter’s previous version. 

b. 
 
If the interpreter stands by the interpreter’s previous version, the judge may call in a certified 
interpreter to review the question and answer and the interpreter’s version. This review should 
occur outside the presence of the jury. 
 
If the certified interpreter believes the challenged interpreter’s version is incorrect and offers a 
different interpretation, the judge must make a determination between the two versions. 

f the judge decides on the certified interpreter’s version, the judge may allow the challenged 
interpreter to make the correction on the record, or the judge may amend the record and advise 
the jury. The judge may decide to remove the challenged interpreter from the case and appoint 
a certified interpreter.

If the certified interpreter confirms that the interpretation is correct, the judge should abide by 
the certified interpreter’s expert linguistic opinion. 
 

K. 

Suggestions for Proper Use of Interpreters in the Courtroom 

 

Speak audibly and require all speakers to do the same. 
 
During consecutive interpretation, speak in phrases, with long pauses. Instruct and 
remind others to do the same.  
 
Allow interpreters to place themselves in the courtroom where they can best hear and 
see the speakers. 
 
Control speed of speech and reading in the court as it can affect the interpreter’s ability 
to understand, retain and interpret information. 
 
Do not let two or more people talk at the same time. 
 

 

f.          If only one interpreter is assigned to a hearing/trial, provide frequent   
            breaks (about every 30 minutes); errors/omissions increase after continual 
            interpretation beyond 30 minutes. See Mirta Vidal, New Study on Fatigue 
            Confirms Need for Team Interpreting, (1997)  

Speak directly to the party or witness, not to the interpreter, and advise counsel to do 
likewise. For example, do not say to the interpreter, “Ask him where he was.” Rather, 
say, “Where were you” directly to the party. 

Assist the interpreter in obtaining access to all relevant documents thus enabling the 
interpreter to prepare for expected interpretation and specialized terminology such as 
medical terms, ballistics, forensics, etc. 

Before trial, allow the interpreter to spend a few minutes to communicate with the 
person who needs the interpreter in order to confirm their mutual ability to 
communicate. Remind the interpreter and the non-English-speaking person not to talk 
about the facts of the case while establishing communication. 

If available, provide accurately translated legal forms.

Oregon Courts on May 19, 1995 in Chief Justice Order No. 95-042, published in Oregon Appellate 
Court Advance Sheets 1995, No. 15. A copy of the order is included in Appendix A. 

he Code is a guide for “all persons, agencies, and organizations who administer, supervise use of, or 

deliver interpreting services to the courts.” Code Prof. Resp. for Interpreters (1995) (Applicability). 

n unique situations, the court, “in order to ensure effective communication,” may authorize deviation 
from the Code. Code Prof. Resp. for Interpreters (1995) (Applicability). 

f an interpreter violates the Code, the court or State Court Administrator may remove the interpreter 
from a court’s list of qualified or certified interpreters. Code Prof. Resp. for Interpreters (1995) 
(Applicability).

ourt Language Access Services (CLAS) advises that Oregon Judicial Department (OJD) contracted court 

interpreters may provide brief “courtesy” interpreting services for incidental communication that occurs 
before, after, or during breaks in proceedings.  

tatutory authority:  

he OJD does not have payment authority to provide court interpreters for off-the-record services between 

limited English proficient (LEP) parties and non OJD personnel. However, for the efficiency of the court 
process, CLAS authorizes incidental off-the-record interpreting services for up to 10 minutes, unless 
otherwise instructed by the court.  

nterpreting considerations:  

roviding interpreting services to one of the case parties for a prolonged period outside of the presence of 

the other parties and the court may give the appearance of bias or a conflict of interest on the part of the 
interpreter. This would violate the court interpreter’s duty under Canon 3 of the Code of Professional 
Responsibility for Interpreters in the Oregon Courts (CPR).  
The OJD contracted interpreter must ensure that the courtesy interpreting services (e.g. sight translating a 
plea petition) do not interfere with the court interpreter’s availability to provide in-court interpreting services 
and must occur in the immediate vicinity of the assigned courtroom.  
Based on all of the circumstances and the interpreter’s best judgment, the interpreter may refuse to provide 
courtesy services. If an attorney requires interpreting services beyond the scope described above, they may 
contract separately with a non-OJD assigned interpreter.

Court Interpreter Services Non-English Written Evidence Interpretation/Translation Guideline 

“Court Interpreter Services advises that non-English written evidence be translated into written document 
form by the moving party prior to being submitted as evidence, and that the court interpreter not perform 
sight-interpretation/translation of written evidence into English, except as instructed by the court.” 

Access to justice considerations: 

• A language-related incomplete provision of equal access to justice issue may exist if non-English 
evidentiary materials have not been provided in both English and the non-English language to the other 
parties in the proceeding in the manner provided by the statutes and rules relating to service, notice and 
discovery of writings in civil and criminal proceedings in courts of justice of this state and before judicial 
officers as required by ORS 1.150(3). 

• An interpreter’s momentary English rendering of non-English written evidence may constitute a language-
related incomplete provision of equal access to justice at the point of deliberation by the Trier of fact, unless 
the court interpreter’s English interpretation were to be made available for review by the Trier of fact in the 
same way that similar English evidence would be made available. 

Interpreting considerations: 

The Code of Professional Responsibility for Interpreters in the Oregon Courts requires that a court interpreter 
render “a complete and accurate interpretation or sight translation, without altering, omitting anything from, or 
adding anything to what is stated or written, and without explanation.” An interpreter may be hindered or 
precluded from doing so by obstacles frequently encountered in written evidence (letters, notes, lists, 
accounts, etc.). Common impediments are: 
 

•  Lack of punctuation, accents or spelling errors which can change the meaning of words 
•  Poor handwriting (whether in personal or official documents) 
•  Unfamiliar abbreviations

•  Lack of access to dictionaries to research unknown or uncommon words  

 

Due to these types of obstacles translators often employ explanatory footnotes. However, such explanations 
go beyond the scope of a court interpreter’s role which is to interpret “without explanation.” 

lso, sight-interpreting written non-English evidence for a party may cause an interpreter to be called as a 
witness by a party in order to explain or defend an interpretation/translation in question. A court interpreter’s 
neutral role as described in the Code of Professional Responsibility requires that an interpreter remain 
impartial, avoiding the appearance of bias. A court interpreter being called as a witness by a party in the 
same proceeding for which the interpreter is providing court interpretation may create a situation perceived 
as a bias.

perform sight-interpretation/translation of written evidence into English, except as instructed by the court.

Court Language Access Services recommends that you, the interpreter, inform the Court and the parties of 
the “complete and accurate” requirement of the Code and of the potential practical difficulties if you are 
asked to be on standby, so that the Court may make an informed decision in answer to a standby interpreting 
request. Unless specifically instructed by the Court, court interpreters should not interpret on standby.  

he Code of Professional Responsibility for Interpreters in the Oregon Courts requires that you, the court 

interpreter, render “a complete and accurate interpretation or sight translation, without altering, omitting 
anything from, or adding anything to what is stated or written, and without explanation.” You will be precluded 
from so doing if you are on standby.  

or example, the typical standby scenario involves an individual who is relatively comfortable with English 
but likes to have an interpreter on standby in order to potentially clarify something which he or she may not 
have understood. Often the individual waits for a break or until the hearing is over and then expects the 
interpreter to summarize and clarify part(s) which may not have been understood. Such summarization and 
clarification, tantamount to explanation, is outside of a court interpreter’s allowed scope of practice.  

hile Court Language Access Services discourages provision of interpreters on a standby basis due to 
these concerns, we also recognize that the court has many factors to keep in mind when making procedural 
decisions. Only the Court may allow an exception to the rule that interpretation be complete and accurate.

Per ORS 45.275(1)(b), CLAS provides interpreting services to victims who seek to exercise their right to

Addendum:  Interpreting Recommendations for Services to Victims– Tips for the Interpreting Team 

n 2015, ORS 45.275 was amended to require the court to appoint an interpreter to interpret open court 
proceedings for a victim who seeks to exercise their rights to attend or participate in proceedings. These 
rights are granted by Article I, sections 42 and 43 of the Constitution of Oregon. 

When CLAS assigns an interpreter or interpreters to a hearing to provide a single interpretation for both a 
defendant and a victim who speak the same language: 

  I

•  The interpreter or interpreters should consider using simultaneous interpreting equipment to avoid the 

victim having to be in close proximity to the defendant.  

• 

If two interpreters are assigned, it is intended that the parties receive one “shared” interpretation and 
not that the interpreters split up and both interpret at the same time.  

When CLAS assigns enough interpreters to a hearing to allow the defendant to receive an interpretation of 
the proceeding that is separate from the interpretation provided to the victim while the victim is observing the 
proceeding: 

•  All of the assigned interpreters are members of the same interpreting team. The interpreting team 
should use their best judgement to decide which interpreter(s) will provide interpreting services to 
whom and how those services will be provided (e.g. the use of equipment, the positioning of the 
interpreters).  

• 

If parties, victims or witnesses not noted on the interpreter confirmation are found to require 
interpretation, the interpreting team will provide appropriate services to all persons with need unless 
otherwise directed by the court. 

•  While the victim is observing the proceeding, one interpreter should not serve both the defendant and 

the victim simultaneously (i.e. no “shared” interpretation). When the observing victim receives a 
separate interpretation, it is possible that the interpretation will be somewhat different from the 
interpretation the defendant receives. 

• 

If the victim is called to give testimony (as opposed to observing the proceeding), the interpreters 
should use their judgement to deploy themselves as would normally be the case for witness 
testimony and to ensure the best possible interpretation for the record.  

•  As with any court interpreting assignment, an interpreter who interprets for either the defendant or the 

victim must avoid any conduct that may give an appearance of bias or a conflict of interest. 

•  While it may appear to other people in the courtroom that there are “extra” interpreters available, all 
interpreters assigned by CLAS are only available to interpret the proceeding and are not to be used 
by the parties in other ways except as described in the OJD-CLAS guideline memo, Interpreting 
Outside of Court or Off the Record. 

When asked to sight-translate a crime victim’s written statement to the judge, interpreters can consider: 

•  Requesting time to review the written statement beforehand; 

•  Requesting permission to ask the victim clarifying questions about the written statement; 

•  Tactfully suggesting to the District Attorney, that the victim read their statement aloud to the court for 
interpretation (NOTE: It is for the victim to choose whether to offer a verbal or written statement). 

Any time an interpreter is unable to provide effective interpreting services to an LEP victim, defendant or 
witness; the interpreter has a duty under the CPR to bring the issue to the attention of the court and the 
parties and to abide by the court’s instructions.

Many persons who come before the courts are partially or completely excluded from full participation in the 
proceedings because of limited English proficiency or a speech or hearing impairment.  It is essential that the 
resulting communications barrier be removed, as far as possible, so that these persons are placed in the 
same position as similarly situated persons for whom there is no such barrier.1  An interpreter is sworn in as 
an officer of the court.  As an officer of the court, an interpreter is a neutral and impartial participant who 
assists the court in ensuring that court proceedings and court support services are accessible and function 
efficiently and effectively.  The court interpreter is a skilled professional, therefore, who fulfills an essential 
role in the administration of justice.  At a minimum, an interpreter must be a "qualified interpreter," under 
ORS 45.275 (7)-(8), to serve in the courts in Oregon.  However, ORS 45.288 requires the court to give 
preference for appointments to an interpreter certified under ORS 45.291.  In other words, the court is 
required by ORS 45.288 to appoint a certified interpreter if a certified interpreter is available, able, and willing 
to serve.  If no certified interpreter is available, able, and willing to serve, an interpreter still must meet the 
statutory requirements for qualification contained in ORS 45.275 (7)-(8) and ORS 45.288(3)-(4) and state his 
or her qualifications on the record as in ORS 45.275 (7). 

APPLICABILITY 

This code shall guide all persons, agencies, and organizations who administer, supervise use of, or deliver 
interpreting services to the courts.  Ensuring equal access to the communication, however, may on occasion 
conflict with this code.  When unique situations necessitate an exception to the rules in order to ensure 
effective communication, the court may so allow. 

For clarification of this code, the following definitions should be kept in mind.  Interpreting is rendering an oral 
statement from one language into an oral statement to another language.  Sight translation is rendering 
written material into oral form.  Translation is rendering written material from one language into written form 
in another language. 

Violations of this code may result in the interpreter being deleted from a court's list of qualified and/or certified 
interpreters. 

 A non-English speaker should be able to understand just as much as an English speaker with the same level of 

education and intelligence would understand.

CODE OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY 

FOR INTERPRETERS IN THE OREGON COURTS 

REAMBLE 

  P

1. 

ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS 

The interpreter shall render a complete and accurate interpretation or sight translation, 
without altering, omitting anything from, or adding anything to what is stated or written, and 
without explanation. 

Commentary 

The interpreter has a twofold duty:  1) to ensure that the proceedings in English reflect precisely what 
was said by a non-English speaking person, and 2) to place the non-English speaking person on an 
equal footing with those who understand English.  This creates an obligation to conserve every 
element of information contained in a source language communication when it is rendered in the 
target language. 

Therefore, the interpreter is obligated to apply the interpreter's best skills and judgment to faithfully 
preserve the meaning of what is said in court, including the style or register of speech.  Verbatim, 
"word for word," or literal oral translations are not appropriate when they distort the meaning of the 
source language, but every spoken statement, even if it appears nonresponsive, obscene, rambling, 
or incoherent, should be interpreted.  This includes apparent misstatements. 

The interpreter should never interject his or her own words, phrases, or expressions.  If the need 
arises to explain an interpreting problem, (e.g., a term or phrase with no direct equivalent in the target 
language or a misunderstanding that only the interpreter can clarify), the interpreter should ask the 
court's permission to provide an explanation.  The interpreter of an oral language should convey the 
emotional emphasis of the speaker, but it may be in a slightly diminished form.  If the witness weeps 
during questioning, the interpreter should not weep.  Imitating the weeping might appear to mock the 
witness.  Sadness can be conveyed by tone of voice alone.  The judge and jury can see a witness' 
emotions for themselves even if they do not understand the target language. 

A sign language interpreter, however, must employ all of the visual cues that the language he or she 
is interpreting requires--including facial expressions and body language, in addition to sign language.  
A sign language interpreter, therefore, should ensure that court participants do not confuse these 
essential elements of the interpreted language with inappropriate interpreter conduct. 

The obligation to preserve accuracy includes the interpreter's duty to correct, in a timely fashion, any 
error of interpretation discovered by the interpreter during the proceeding.  The interpreter should 
demonstrate professionalism by objectively analyzing any challenge to his or her performance. 

2. 

REPRESENTATIONS OF QUALIFICATIONS 

The interpreter shall accurately and completely represent his or her certifications, training, 
and pertinent experience.  The court should reassess the interpreter's qualifications each time 
the interpreter is engaged to interpret in court for a non-English speaking party or witness. 

 

 

Commentary 

Acceptance of a case by the interpreter implies the interpreter's linguistic competency in legal 
settings.  Withdrawing or being asked to withdraw from a case after it begins causes a disruption of 

OJD Best Practices for Working with Interpreters

court proceedings and is wasteful of scarce public resources.  It is therefore essential that the 
interpreter present a complete and truthful account of the interpreter's training, certification, and 
experience prior to appointment so the court can fairly evaluate the interpreter's qualifications for 
delivering interpreting services. 

3. 

IMPARTIALITY AND AVOIDANCE OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST--COURT OR PROCEEDING 
INTERPRETER 

The interpreter shall be impartial and unbiased and shall refrain from conduct that may give 
an appearance of bias or conflict of interest.  The interpreter shall disclose to the judge any 
real bias or interest in the parties or witnesses in a case, or any situation or relationship that 
may be perceived by the court, any of the parties, or any witnesses as a bias or interest in the 
parties or witnesses in a case.  

Commentary 

When appointed by the court to act as a proceeding interpreter, the interpreter's "clients" are all of the 
parties and witnesses in the court case.  Because of this, it is important that the interpreter have no 
real or perceived interest in any of the parties or witnesses beyond the professional interest of 
interpreting for the non-English speaking parties and witnesses in the court case. 

Any condition that interferes with the objectivity of the interpreter constitutes a conflict of interest.  
Before providing services in a matter, the court interpreter must disclose to all parties and the court 
any prior involvement in the case or with the parties or witnesses, whether personal or professional, 
that could be reasonably construed as a conflict of interest.  This disclosure shall not include 
privileged or confidential information.  If, after this disclosure on the record, all parties acknowledge 
the situation and determine that it is in the best interest of justice for the interpreter to serve in the 
case, the interpreter may interpret in the case. 

The following are circumstances that are presumed to create actual or perceived conflicts of interest 
for the interpreter where the interpreter needs to declare the conflict of interest before appointment on 
the record and let the court determine if the interpreter should serve in the case: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

 

 

 

 

The interpreter is a friend, associate, or relative of a party or counsel for a party involved in the 
proceedings; 

The interpreter has served in an investigative capacity in the case at issue for any party 
involved in the case; 

The interpreter has previously been retained by a law enforcement agency to assist in the 
preparation of the criminal case at issue; 

The interpreter or the interpreter's spouse or child has a financial interest in the subject matter 
in controversy or in a party to the proceeding or any other interest from which the interpreter 
may benefit from, that would be affected by the outcome of the case; 

5. 

The interpreter has been involved in the choice of counsel or law firm for the case. 

The interpreter should not serve in any manner in which payment for their services is contingent upon 
the outcome of the case. 

OJD Best Practices for Working with Interpreters

An interpreter who is also an attorney should not serve as the court or proceeding interpreter, as well 
as the attorney in the same case. 

During the proceeding, the interpreter should avoid any conduct or behavior that presents the 
appearance of favoritism toward any of the parties.  The Interpreter should maintain professional 
relationships with the non-English speaking parties and witnesses and should limit his or her 
involvement in the proceedings to that of interpretation.  The interpreter should discourage a non-
English speaking party's or witness' personal dependence on the interpreter. 

The interpreter should refrain from conversations with parties, witnesses, jurors, attorneys, or with 
friends or relatives of any party in or near the courtroom, except in the discharge of their official 
functions.  It is especially important that the interpreter, who is often familiar with attorneys or other 
members of the courtroom work group, including law enforcement officers, refrain from casual and 
personal conversations with anyone in the court that may convey an appearance of a special 
relationship or partiality to any court participant. 

An example of conversation that would be within the interpreter's official duties would be:  
communicating with the non-English speaking party or witness in an informal setting where the 
interpreter would listen to accent, rhythm, and the choice of words of the non-English speaking party 
to determine if the interpreter can adequately interpret for the non-English speaking party or witness.   

The interpreter should strive for professional detachment.  The interpreter should avoid all verbal and 
nonverbal displays of personal attitudes, prejudices, emotions, or opinions. 

Should the interpreter become aware that a proceeding participant views the interpreter as having a 
bias or being biased, the interpreter should disclose that knowledge on the record to the judge and 
the parties in the case.  This disclosure shall not include privileged or confidential information.  If all 
parties acknowledge the situation and determine that it is in the best interest of justice for the 
interpreter to serve in the case, the interpreter may continue to interpret in the case.  

4. 

IMPARTIALITY AND AVOIDANCE OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST--INTERPRETER APPOINTED 
TO WORK WITH STATE-PAID, APPOINTED ATTORNEY 

An interpreter appointed to work with a state-paid, appointed attorney shall refrain from conduct that 
may give an appearance of personal bias or conflict of interest.  The interpreter so appointed may 
appear to have the natural professional bias that occurs because the interpreter is part of the 
appointed legal team.  Interpreters appointed to work with an appointed attorney shall disclose to the 
attorney any real bias or interest in the parties or witnesses in a case, or any situation or relationship 
that may be perceived by the court, any of the parties, or any witnesses as a personal bias or interest 
in the parties or witnesses in a case.  The appointed attorney shall either petition the court for the 
appointment of a different interpreter to the case, thereby releasing the interpreter from the 
interpreter's obligation in the case, or the attorney shall bring the situation to the attention of the court 
and opposing party, on the record.  If the attorney fails to bring the conflict to the attention of the 
court, the interpreter must notify the court of a potential conflict of interest.  This disclosure shall not 
include privileged or confidential information.  If all of the parties agree that the interpreter may serve 
on the case, the interpreter may remain appointed to the case.

Any condition that interferes with the objectivity of the interpreter constitutes a conflict of interest.  
Before accepting appointment to a case, the interpreter must disclose to all parties and the court any 
prior involvement in the case or with the parties or witnesses, whether personal or professional, that 
could be reasonably construed as a conflict of interest.  This disclosure shall not include privileged or 
confidential information.  If, after this disclosure on the record, all parties acknowledge the situation 
and determine that it is in the best interest of justice for the interpreter to serve in the case, the 
interpreter may interpret in the case. 

The following are circumstances that are presumed to create actual or perceived conflicts of interest 
for the interpreter where the interpreter needs to declare the conflict of interest before appointment on 
the record and let the court determine if the interpreter should serve in the case: 

The interpreter is a friend, associate, or relative of a party or counsel for a party involved in the 
proceedings; 

The interpreter has served in an investigative capacity in the case at issue for any party 
involved in the case; 

The interpreter has previously been retained by a law enforcement agency to assist in the

The interpreter or the interpreter's spouse or child has a financial interest in the subject matter 
in controversy or in a party to the proceeding or any other interest from which the interpreter 
may benefit from, that would be affected by the outcome of the case; 

5. 

The interpreter has been involved in the choice of counsel or law firm for the case. 

The interpreter should not serve in any manner in which payment for the interpreter's services is 
contingent upon the outcome of the case. 

The interpreter appointed to work with an appointed attorney is to interpret what is spoken by the non-
English speaking party in private conferences and conversations between the appointed attorney and 
the non-English speaking party.  In a case where the court has appointed the attorney and the 
interpreter, the interpreter may also sit at the counsel table and interpret the proceeding for the non-
English speaking person in a simultaneous interpretation mode.   

An interpreter who is also an attorney may prepare a case without the aid of an additional interpreter; 
however, it is not required.  An attorney who is also an interpreter may not act as the attorney and the 
interpreter for the non-English speaking party in court during a proceeding. 

Though appointed as a member of the legal team, the interpreter should avoid any conduct or 
behavior that presents the appearance of any personal favoritism toward any of the parties.  The 
interpreter should maintain professional relationships with the appointed attorney and the non-English 
speaking party and should limit their involvement with the non-English speaking party to that of 
interpretation.  The interpreter should discourage a non-English speaking party's personal 
dependence on the interpreter and should defer all questions the party may have to the appointed 
attorney.   

Though a member of the appointed legal team, the interpreter must not take on the role of advocate 
for the non-English speaking party.  Despite the fact that the interpreter is a member of the legal 

OJD Best Practices for Working with Interpreters

team, the interpreter must still interpret everything that is said in court to the non-English speaking 
party and to interpret everything that is said by the non-English speaking party.  For example, if in a 
criminal case the defendant becomes angry during the proceeding and starts to shout obscenities at 
a witness who is testifying, it is the interpreter's duty to interpret for the court participants everything 
that the defendant is saying, even if what is being said by the defendant is not helpful to the defense 
effort. 

An interpreter appointed to a case should not perform bilingual paralegal, investigative, or clerical 
work on the same case.  The interpreter shall not claim paralegal, investigative, or clerical work as 
interpretation in any billings. 

During the course of the proceedings, the interpreter should refrain from conversations with parties, 
witnesses, jurors, attorneys, or with friends or relatives of any party in or near the courtroom, except 
in the discharge of their official functions.  It is especially important that the interpreter, who is often 
familiar with attorneys or other members of the courtroom work group, including law enforcement 
officers, refrain from casual and personal conversations with anyone in the court that may convey an 
appearance of a special relationship or partiality to any of the court participants other than that of the 
professional relationship of interpreting for the appointed attorney and the non-English speaking 
party. 

An example of conversation that would be within the interpreter's duties would be: communicating 
with the non-English speaking party prior to appointment to the case in an informal setting where the 
interpreter would listen to accent, rhythm, and the choice of words of the non-English speaking party 
to determine if the interpreter can adequately interpret for the non-English speaking party.   

The interpreter should strive for professional detachment.  The interpreter should avoid all verbal and 
nonverbal displays of personal attitudes, prejudices, emotions, or opinions. 

Should the interpreter become aware that a proceeding participant views the interpreter as having a 
bias or being biased, the interpreter should disclose that knowledge to the appointed attorney.  The 
appointed attorney shall either petition the court for the appointment of a different interpreter to the 
case thereby releasing the interpreter from the interpreter's obligation in the case, or the attorney 
shall bring the situation to the attention of the court and opposing party, on the record.  If the attorney 
fails to bring the conflict to the attention of the court, the interpreter must notify the court of a potential 
conflict of interest.  This disclosure shall not include privileged or confidential information.  If all of the 
parties agree that the interpreter may serve on the case, the interpreter may remain on the case.   

5. 

PROFESSIONAL DEMEANOR 

The interpreter shall conduct himself or herself in a manner consistent with the dignity of the 
court and shall be as unobtrusive as possible. 

Commentary 

The interpreter should know and observe the established protocol, rules, and procedures for 
delivering interpreting services.  When speaking in English, the interpreter should speak at a rate and 
volume that enables the interpreter to be heard and understood throughout the courtroom, but the 
interpreter's presence should otherwise be as unobtrusive as possible.  The interpreter should work

without drawing undue or inappropriate attention to himself or herself.  The interpreter should dress in 
a manner that is consistent with the dignity of the court proceedings.  

The interpreter should avoid obstructing the view of any individual involved in the proceeding.  An 
interpreter who uses sign language or other visual modes of communication must, however, be 
positioned so that the sign language, facial expressions and whole body movement are visible to the 
person for whom the interpreter is interpreting. 

The interpreter is encouraged to avoid personal or professional conduct that could discredit the court. 

6. 

CONFIDENTIALITY 

Commentary 

The interpreter shall understand the rules of privileged and other confidential information and 
shall protect the confidentiality of all privileged and other confidential information. 

The interpreter must protect and uphold the confidentiality of all privileged information obtained during 
the course of his or her duties.  It is especially important that the interpreter understand and uphold 
the attorney-client privilege that requires confidentiality with respect to any communication between 
attorney and client.  This rule also applies to other types of privileged communications. 

The interpreter must also refrain from repeating or disclosing case information obtained by the 
interpreter in the course of employment. 

In the event that the interpreter becomes aware of information that suggests imminent harm to 
someone or relates to a crime being committed during the course of the proceedings, the interpreter 
should immediately disclose the information to the criminal presiding judge or a judge who is not 
involved in the proceeding (if the presiding judge is involved in the proceeding).  At that point, it will 
become that judge's responsibility to determine what action, if any, should be taken regarding the 
situation. 

 

7. 

RESTRICTION OF PUBLIC COMMENT 

The interpreter shall not publicly discuss, report, or offer an opinion concerning a matter in which the 
interpreter is or has been engaged, even when that information is not privileged or required by law to 
be confidential. 

The interpreter shall limit himself or herself to interpreting or performing sight translating and 
shall not give legal advice, express personal opinions to individuals for whom the interpreter 
is interpreting, or engage in any other activities that may be construed to constitute a service 
other than interpreting or translating. 

SCOPE OF PRACTICE

Commentary

40 of 59 

Because the interpreter is responsible only for enabling others to communicate, the interpreter should 
limit himself or herself to the activity of interpreting or translating only.  The interpreter should refrain 
from initiating communications while interpreting unless it is necessary for assuring an accurate and 
faithful interpretation. 

The interpreter may be required to initiate communications during a proceeding when they find it 
necessary to seek assistance in performing his or her duties.  Examples of such circumstances 
include seeking direction when unable to understand or express a word or thought, requesting 
speakers to moderate their rate of communication or repeat or rephrase something, correcting the 
interpreter's own interpreting errors, or notifying the court of reservations about his or her ability to 
satisfy an assignment competently.  In such instances, the interpreter should make it clear that the 
interpreter is speaking for himself or herself. 

The interpreter may convey legal advice only when the interpreter is interpreting legal advice that an 
attorney is giving.  The interpreter should not explain the purpose of forms, services, or otherwise act 
as a counselor or advisor unless the interpreter is interpreting for someone who is acting in that 
official capacity. 

The interpreter should not personally perform acts that are the official responsibility of other court 
officials, including, but not limited to, court clerks, pretrial release investigators, indigence verification 
specialists, or probation counselors. 

An interpreter appointed to a case should not perform bilingual paralegal, investigative, or clerical 
work on the same case.  The interpreter shall not claim paralegal, investigative, or clerical work as 
interpretation in any billings. 

9. 

ASSESSING AND REPORTING IMPEDIMENTS TO PERFORMANCE 

The interpreter shall assess at all times his or her ability to deliver interpretation services.  
When the interpreter has any reservation about his or her ability to satisfy an assignment 
competently, the interpreter shall immediately convey that reservation to the court. 

 

Commentary 

If the communication mode or language of the non-English speaking person cannot be readily 
interpreted or becomes difficult to readily interpret, the interpreter should notify the court immediately.   

The interpreter should notify the court of any environmental or physical limitation that impedes or 
hinders the interpreter's ability to deliver interpreting services adequately, e.g., the courtroom is not 
quiet enough for the interpreter to hear or be heard by the non-English speaker, more than one 
person at a time is speaking, or principals or witnesses of the court are speaking at a rate of speed 
that is too rapid for the interpreter to adequately interpret.  A sign language interpreter must ensure 
that he or she can both see and convey the full range of visual language elements that are necessary 
for communication, including facial expressions and body movement, as well as sign language.  

The interpreter should notify the court of the need to take periodic breaks in order to maintain mental 
and physical alertness and to prevent interpreter fatigue.  The interpreter should recommend and 
encourage the court to use more than one interpreter in a lengthy proceeding or trial. 

OJD Best Practices for Working with Interpreters

Even a competent and experienced interpreter may encounter cases where routine proceedings 
suddenly involve technical or specialized terminology unfamiliar to the interpreter, e.g., the 
unscheduled testimony of an expert witness.  When such instances occur, the interpreter should 
request a brief recess in order to familiarize himself or herself with the subject matter.  If familiarity 
with the terminology requires extensive time or more intensive research, the interpreter should inform 
the judge. 

The interpreter is encouraged to make inquiries as to the nature of a case whenever possible before 
accepting an assignment.  This enables the interpreter to more closely match his or her professional 
qualifications, skills, and experience to potential assignments, and more accurately assess the 
interpreter's ability to competently satisfy those assignments. 

The interpreter should refrain from accepting a case if the interpreter feels the language and subject 
matter of that case may exceed his or her skills or capacities.  The interpreter should feel no 
compunction about notifying the court if the interpreter feels unable to perform competently due to 
lack of familiarity with terminology, preparation or difficulty in understanding a witness or defendant. 

 

The interpreter should notify the presiding officer of any personal bias he or she may have involving 
any aspect of the proceedings, including any bias as to the subject matter of the case, or bias against 
any of the parties in the case. 

10. 

DUTY TO REPORT ETHICAL VIOLATIONS 

The interpreter shall report to the court any actions by any persons that may impede the 
interpreter's compliance with any law, any provision of this code, or any other official policy 
governing court interpreting and sight translating. 

Because the users of interpreting services frequently misunderstand the proper role of the interpreter, 
they may ask or expect the interpreter to perform duties or engage in activities that run counter to the 
provisions of this code or other laws, regulations, or policies governing court interpreters.  It is 
incumbent upon the interpreter to inform such persons of his or her professional obligations.  If, 
having been apprised of these obligations, the person persists in demanding that the interpreter 
violate them, the interpreter should turn to the court's interpreter coordinator, the trial court 
administrator or trial court clerk, or the judge to resolve the situation. 

11. 

PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 

The interpreter shall continually improve his or her skills and knowledge and advance the 
profession through activities such as professional training and education and interaction with 
colleagues and specialists in related fields.

The interpreter must continually strive to increase his or her knowledge of the languages in which the 
interpreter works professionally, including past and current trends in technical, vernacular, and 
regional terminology, as well as their application within court proceedings. 

The interpreter should keep informed of all statutes, rules of courts, and policies of the judiciary that 
relate to the performance of the interpreter's professional duties. 

The interpreter should seek to elevate the standards of the profession through participation in 
workshops, professional meetings, interaction with colleagues, and reading current literature in the 
field.

he practice of having simultaneous interpreters work in teams of two during lengthy assignments, although 

standard procedure in all other forums requiring interpretation has never been universally accepted by the 
courts. In most state and many federal courts, it is simply not done. Attempts by interpreters to institute the 
policy have met with resistance from judges who consider it wasteful and administrators who cite budgetary 
constraints. But a study recently conducted at the University of Geneva has contributed important new 
information on the subject: its findings provide further scientific evidence to support the position that accuracy 
is directly related to the length of time that a person interprets. 

he study by Barbara Moser-Mercer and her colleagues (forthcoming) at the University of Geneva’s Ecole de 
Traduction et d’Interpretation constitutes the first part of a two-part study on stress and fatigue in conference 
interpreting. Its aim is to examine the fatigue factor during extended turns, as well as the coping behavior of 
interpreters when under stress. The subjects –five native English-speakers working from German into 
English, whose professional experience ranged from 12 to 25 years in the booth – were told to work until 
they could no longer provide acceptable quality. During the first 30 minutes the frequency of errors – as 
measured with an elaborate error scale – rose steadily. The interpreters, however, “appeared to be unaware 
of this decline in quality,” according to the report, as most of them continued on task for another 30 minutes. 

he error scale included several different categories by which quality can be determined. “Looking at the total 

number of errors,” the report states, “we can see that the frequency increases from three minutes to 30 
minutes.” 

he category of most serious errors, i.e., errors in meaning, rose consistently with increased time on task. At 
60 minutes, all subjects committed a total of 32.5 meaning errors. “Considering that each meaning error, no 
matter how minor, does distort the message, a considerable increase in the number of meaning errors after 
30 minutes on task does represent a significant decline in output quality,” the authors argue. In the category 
of nonsense, the number of errors committed by the subjects almost doubled after 30 minutes on task – from 
4.5 after 15 minutes to 8.5. 

oser-Mercer and her colleagues conclude: 

he increase in the number of meaning errors combined with the interpreters’ lack of awareness of this 

drastic decrease in quality shed some light on the validity of interpreters’ judgment of their own output quality 
[...] This lack of judgment appears to be the result of cognitive overload: a situation in which the interpreter 
tries to economize on processing capacity and allocate resources only to those parts of the interpreting 
process that will ensure continuous output (irrespective of the quality provided) [...] We can conclude from 
this that shorter turns do indeed preserve a high level of quality, but that interpreters cannot necessarily be 
trusted to make the right decision with regard to optimum time on task. 

his is an important insight, since many interpreters, fearful of not getting work or of exposing what is 

erroneously perceived as a weakness, will insist that they can work for extended periods of time without any 
adverse consequences to accuracy. It also raises an obvious question: if interpreters themselves are unable 
to judge the length of time beyond which the quality of their performance declines significantly, how can 
anyone else have the power to decide how long an interpreter should work without relief? 

n additional conclusion reached by the University of Geneva team concerned the subjects’ emotional 

response to increased time on task. “Interpreters seem to experience an increase in stress during the first 30 
minutes, as indicated by a rise in cortisole levels, but with task overload respond with an ‘I couldn’t care less’ 
feeling,” they report, adding: “This is borne out by anecdotal evidence according to which interpreters try to

NEW STUDY ON FATIGUE CONFIRMS NEED FOR TEAM INTERPRETING

deflect responsibility for the quality of output when they consider the demands to be unrealistic; this would 
include increased time on task, extremely fast speakers, and long working hours.” 

tress investigated among UN interpreters. H. McIlvaine Parsons, a fellow at the Institute for Behavioral 
Research, in Silver Spring, MD, reached similar conclusions in a consultation he conducted in 1975 for the 
United Nations. The study was part of an investigation that followed a job action in which UN interpreters 
stayed away from their jobs for one day to protest “working hours and the stress and tension they said 
resulted from working more than seven half-day sessions per week.” McIlvaine Parsons’ objective was in part 
to “create a wider understanding than there seemed to be of the interpretation process. If some of these 
factors could be ameliorated,” he argues, “the interpreters might experience less stress and tension and they 
might be less likely to avoid that stress and tension by failing to come to work.” 

cIlvaine Parsons reported that “the interpreters were emphatic that more than three hours in a booth 

[taking turns with a colleague] resulted in excessive stress and tension, especially compared with a shorter 
time.” Other factors rated by the subjects as stressful or extremely stressful included: the speaker talking 
very fast, lack of clarity or coherence by the speaker, the need for intense concentration, inexperience with 
the subject matter, a speaker’s accent, long speaker utterances between pauses, background noise in the 
meeting room, and mispositioning of the speaker’s microphone relative to the speaker. 

s a result of his study, McIlvaine Parsons recommended to the UN Secretariat “that a simultaneous 
interpreter should not be required to work more than three half-day sessions in succession.” It should be 
borne in mind that UN interpreters work in teams of two at all times. 

keptics might be inclined to argue that these studies do not refer specifically to interpreters who work in 

court and are therefore not applicable to this sector. A comparison of court and conference interpreting, 
however, can easily demonstrate that the former is in fact more demanding and stressful than the latter. 

hat is fatigue? Although the definition of the word fatigue seems obvious, there is considerable confusion 

among the general public and the legal profession about its meaning and consequences in a courtroom 
setting. Fatigue for interpreters is not primarily physical, as in the case of athletes, whose muscles become 
strained after sustained exertion: it is mental fatigue. It results from complex mental processing and the high 
degree of concentration the interpreter must have to hear, then understand, analyze, and finally express 
ideas coherently in another language. “Most people do not realize that an interpreter uses at least 22 
cognitive skills when interpreting,” states Patricia Michelsen in an article published in The Court Management 
and Administration Report. Other studies of simultaneous interpretation have shown that fatigue is 
exacerbated by environmental factors that interfere with various aspects of the cognitive process. 

aking into consideration both cognitive processes and environmental interference, the degree of 

concentration required of an interpreter is many times greater than that of any other person in a courtroom. In 
a 1995 study on fidelity assessment in consecutive interpretation, Daniel Gile reports that a group of subjects 
asked to rate an interpretation “waned errors that had not been made by the interpreter on the other.” This is 
not surprising to interpretation teachers, according to Gile, since “ordinary listening entails too much loss, 
and [...] interpreters have to listen to speakers with much more concentration than is usual in everyday life.” 
While conference interpreters must cope with the stress generated by the job’s cognitive demands, their 
booth-enclosed environment is relatively stress-free compared to a courtroom setting. As Michelsen 
indicates, “Conference interpreters work under better conditions: they concentrate on only one speaker at a 
time, often have a prepared text of the speech ahead of time, address the audience in only one level of 
rhetoric, and usually do not have audibility problems.” 

nvironmental factors and loss of accuracy. Audibility is one of the key factors contributing to the stress 
suffered by court interpreters. In 1974, an enlightening study on the effects of noise on the performance of 
simultaneous interpreters was conducted by David Gerver, then at the University of Durham, Great Britain. 
He found that, as the listening conditions deteriorated, significantly more errors were committed by the 
subjects when interpreting than when shadowing (repeating a spoken text in the same language).

his finding, according to Gerver, “suggested that difficulty in perceiving source language passages reduced 

the ability of simultaneous interpreters to monitor their own interpretations into the target language.” He 
added that other studies indicated that “levels of noise which would not necessarily impair perception of 
speech by simultaneous conference interpreters could interfere with the processes involved in the retrieval 
and transformation of the messages being interpreted.” Listening conditions are most relevant to any 
discussion of interpreter stress and fatigue. Since monitoring their own utterances and making corrections is 
one of the many cognitive functions performed by interpreters, if their ability to self-correct is impaired, their 
level of stress and resulting fatigue also increase proportionately. “It is perhaps not surprising,” Gerver 
comments, “that simultaneous interpreters are particularly sensitive to environmental noise and that they will 
often refuse to work in conditions which, to the observer at least, do not appear particularly stressful.” While 
Gerver’s study was conducted with a monitored increase in noise level, the same conclusions would apply to 
a situation in which the interpreter is simply unable to hear, as too often occurs in the courtroom.  

iven that acoustic impairments cause conference interpreters stress and fatigue, we can safely conclude 
that court interpreters are at a distinctly greater disadvantage acoustically, and therefore subjected to even 
more severe stress. Unlike conference interpreters, who work in soundproof booths and hear the sound 
through headphones connected to a stationary microphone, court interpreters hear telegraphic, often-
interrupted messages from speakers distributed throughout the courtroom. Although many courts have 
microphones, they are not multidirectional and often distort the sound more than they amplify it. The 
interpreter must then filter this message through myriad other noises polluting the audible space, such as 
telephones ringing, jurors coughing, babies crying in the gallery, and so on.  

he best kept secret in the courtroom may well be that interpreters are often unable to hear what they are 

expected to interpret. When interpreting simultaneously into a microphone, they are invariably made to 
position themselves at the point furthest away from the witness stand, so as not to disturb jurors and those 
testifying. When no simultaneous equipment is available, the interpreter is obliged to sit next to the defendant 
– the hardest place from which to hear the proceedings. (By contrast, court reporters are granted the choice 
spot in the well of the courtroom to maximize their ability to hear every word uttered.) Moreover, no one 
seems to realize that the interpreter’s hearing is further obstructed by the sound of his or her own voice 
overlapping the original speaker’s at all times, creating an additional acoustical impediment. 

he bolder or more experienced interpreters will interrupt to insist that the parties speak up or rearrange 
themselves to improve audibility. But courtroom atmospheres are not always conducive to intransigence on 
the part of someone who is supposed to be invisible and unobtrusive, and even well-meaning judges and 
court clerks often have little or no control over antiquated sound systems or acoustically faulty architecture. 

ll of the factors found by the various studies described here to be major causes of conference interpreter 

stress and fatigue – acoustics, prolonged periods on task, lack of familiarity with relevant terminology, 
excessively fast or incoherent speakers, etc. – are in fact more applicable to interpreters in court than in any 
other setting. Moreover, judiciary interpreters have the additional pressure of knowing that nothing less than 
the life and liberty of human beings are at stake in the proceedings they are called on to duplicate in a 
defendant’s native tongue. The awareness that each word mistranslated or omitted hinders the non-English 
speakers’ ability to follow the proceedings against them is a constant source of tension. Whereas the 
conference setting allows for much more flexibility, interpreting in court requires greater precision, since a 
complete and faithful rendition must include hesitations, false starts, repetitions, and inaccuracies. It follows 
then that judiciary interpreters face more demanding and stressful working conditions than their counterparts 
elsewhere. 

tudies corroborate empirical evidence. While these studies make an important contribution to the body of 
scientific data needed for a better understanding of the interpreting process and its complexities, they merely 
corroborate what practicing interpreters have known and argued all along: that work quality, i.e., accuracy 
and coherence, begins to deteriorate after approximately 30 minutes of sustained simultaneous interpreting,

and that the only way to ensure a faithful rendition of legal proceedings is to provide interpreters with 
adequate relief at approximately half-hour intervals. 

onscientious administrators in several federal courts, the United Nations and the U.S. State Department 
recognized the need for tandem interpreting and adopted the practice early on. Team interpreting, in fact, 
dates back to the Nuremberg Trials. At the State Department, which according to Harry Obst, Director of the 
Office of Language Services, handles 200 to 300 interpreting missions in 100 different locations per day, it is 
considered an inviolable policy. In response to a request from Ed Baca of the Administrative Office of the 
U.S. Courts, Obst pointed out that, “The policy on simultaneous interpreters is simple and corresponds to 
that of all other responsible interpreting services in the entire world (United Nations, European Commission, 
International Red Cross, International Court of Justice, foreign ministries in other nations). No individual 
simultaneous interpreter is allowed to work for more than 30 minutes at a time.” The letter continues, “This is 
also done for the protection of the users. After 30 minutes the accuracy and completeness of simultaneous 
interpreters decrease precipitously, falling off by about 10 percent every five minutes after holding a 
satisfactory plateau for half an hour.” The reason, Obst explains, is that “The human mind cannot hold the 
needed level of focused concentration any longer than that. This fact has been demonstrated in millions of 
hours of simultaneous interpretation around the world since 1948. It is not a question of opinion. It is simply 
the result of empirical observation.”  

choing the results of the University of Geneva study, Obst adds that although some interpreters believe 
they can interpret longer than that, they do so because after 30 minutes “they can no longer differentiate 
between interpreting the original message or just babbling into the target language. Their mind is too tired to 
evaluate their own performance.” The policy on the part of court administrators that interpreters work for an 
hour or more without relief, says Obst, “makes sense only in budgetary terms. It makes reliable interpreting 
impossible and denies the client who has to rely on the interpreter the due process that every person is 
entitled to under our laws.” 

nd that is precisely the point. Unlike their colleagues in any other sector, judiciary interpreters are placed 
under oath to “truly and accurately interpret” the proceedings. Accuracy in a legal context is not an academic 
concept or an abstraction that can be quantified in relative terms. It is the cornerstone that guarantees 
limited-English litigants equality under the law. That was the spirit of the Court Interpreters Act enacted in 
1978. It is also the spirit of the Code of Professional Responsibility drafted by the Administrative Office of the 
U.S. Courts, which compels interpreters to “fulfill a special duty to interpret accurately and faithfully” and 
“perform to the best of their ability to assure due process for the parties” and “refuse any assignment [...] 
under conditions which substantially impair their effectiveness.” If interpreters are to be expected to comply 
with these canons, they will need the full support of administrators in both the state and federal courts, who 
will place due process considerations above the temptation to trim their budgets at the expense of those who 
come before the bar of justice.

Jurors

OREGON JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT 

Office of the State Court  Administrator 

March 15, 2002 

MEMORANDUM 

(SENT BY E-MAIL) 

TO: 

Presiding Judges 

Trial Court Administrators 

FROM:  Kingsley W. Click 

State Court Administrator 

RE: 

 

Parameters on the Use of Foreign Language Interpreters (not Sign Interpreters) for Non-
English Speaking Jurors; Payment Provisions Reminder 

PLEASE FORWARD TO YOUR JUDGES AND STAFF AS APPROPRIATE  

We have just updated the jury policies to reflect the changes to payment of jurors by passage of SB 
1006 (First Special Session). This is a good time, therefore, especially in light of our budget deficit, to 
remind courts of allowable payments and nonallowable payments from mandated payments related to 
interpreters and jurors. 

The purpose of this memorandum is to provide an update to my previous memorandum provided to 
presiding judges regarding this topic, dated April 12, 2000, electronic copy attached, as Attachment. 
(Please contact OSCA if you wish to have the hard copy attachments to this April 2000 memorandum 
faxed to you; they are not available in electronic format.) 

1.  Current Oregon Law 

Currently there is no authority in Oregon statute for appointment of a state-paid interpreter for a non- 
English speaking (foreign language) juror, either sitting on a grand jury or a trial. Current statute 
does not provide for a foreign language interpreter to be in the jury deliberation room. There is 

OJD Best Practices for Working with Interpreters 

 

49 of 59 

     

 

 

 

statutory authority, however, to provide and pay an interpreter for juror orientation and voir dire 
purposes to determine if the juror has sufficient English language skills to serve. 

The statutes require court proceedings to be held in English and documents submitted in English. 
There is no express provision in the Oregon Constitution or Oregon case law to-date that provides 
that non- English speakers are allowed to serve on juries. One concern, I believe, has been that the 
rights of the defendant to a fair trial not be compromised by a “duty” to serve (not a right) as a juror if 
the juror was not able to follow the proceedings and the evidence in the trial accurately due to a 
language barrier. 

Because there is no authority in Oregon law for appointment of an interpreter for an empaneled non- 
English speaking juror, there are no funds provided by the legislature to the OJD that are available 
for payment of an interpreter to provide interpretation to an empaneled non-English speaking juror. 
As discussed below, the budget estimate for supporting legislation to allow a change in policy was 
about $4 million in additional funds needed. 

If a court provides interpreters for non-English speaking jurors providing jury service (trial or grand 
jury), therefore, the cost will need to be paid from the local trial court operating budget and not from 
the centrally administered Mandated Payments Account, which is not funded for these costs. 

In contrast, by statute, deaf or hard-of-hearing persons may still serve on a jury using a sign 
interpreter. This is provided in state law, in compliance with the federal Americans with Disability Act 
(which does not cover foreign language), and codified in ORS 10.115, and the Judicial Department 
is funded by the legislature for this mandate. 

2.  2001 Legislation Not Passed 

In response to the interest shown by the Oregon courts in this issue, last full session (2001), the 
Oregon Judicial Department proposed legislation, SB 78, to 1) specifically allow for non-English 
speaking persons to sit on juries and be provided with a state-paid interpreter, and 2) fund the cost of 
this allowance. Senate Bill 78 received a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 
19, 2001, but the bill did not get referred to Ways and Means nor passed out of committee. 
Therefore, there was no change to Oregon law or our funding on this issue. 

There may be similar legislation reintroduced in 2003, if the OJD sponsors it, and, again, the 
legislature would make a policy choice. 

3.  Authorized Payments 

In summary, without express legislative authority and budget, the only payments for interpreters 
for jurors from the OJD Mandated Payments Appropriation are: 

For interpreters scheduled so that the court’s jury coordinator may determine if the non-English 
speaking juror has the English ability to continue with the jury service. 

For sign interpreters, as required by the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. 

 

If there is a foreign language interpreter provided for an empaneled juror for some reason, it will be 
charged to local operations budget. If you have any questions on this memorandum, please contact Gail 
Bouldrey (finance questions; 503/986-5524; gail.e.bouldrey@ojd.state.or.us) or Cathy Rhodes (interpreter

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
