 INFORMATION FOR RESPONDENTS 
In Family Abuse Prevention Act Cases 

   

  You have been served with a Family Abuse Prevention Act Restraining 
Order.  Read it carefully.  Each part of the order must be obeyed.  The 
petitioner is the person who asked for the restraining order.  You are the 
respondent - the respondent is the person who will respond and answer 
the claim that he/she has committed abuse. 

   
  The Restraining Order has been issued by the court and is now in effect.  

  The Restraining Order affects your rights and may include orders 

regarding custody and parenting time of your children.  It is a serious 
matter. 

  You have the right to contest (object to) the Restraining Order.  

Information about how to contest the restraining order is in the box below. 

  As a result of this order, or any order continuing or changing this order, it 
may be unlawful for you to possess or purchase a firearm or ammunition 
based on federal law under 18 U.S.C. § 992(g)(8).  If you have any 
questions about whether this law applies to you, you should consult an 
attorney. 

 

If you do not object to the Restraining Order, it will continue for one year 
from the date the judge signed it, unless the Petitioner dismisses it earlier.  
It can also be renewed.  More information about renewal is below. 

  A police officer or sheriff who believes that you have violated any part of a 

Restraining Order must arrest you based on ORS 133.310(3). 

  Violation of the Restraining Order may result in civil and/or criminal 

penalties, including a jail sentence of up to 6 months and a fine of $500 or 
1% of your annual gross income, whichever is more. 

It is your responsibility to strictly obey all the parts of the Restraining 
Order, even if the Petitioner invites you to have contact or says it is all 
right for you to ignore the order. This also means you should not contact 
the Petitioner to let him/her know you’ve received the restraining order or 
to ask questions about the restraining order 
 
If you have any questions about the Restraining Order or your rights, you 
should consult an attorney.  Scroll down the page to “Important Notice – 
Right to Consult With or Obtain An Attorney.”

INFORMATION ABOUT HEARINGS 

 
Contesting (Objecting To) the Restraining Order 

If you disagree with the whole Restraining Order or if you disagree with some of parts 
of the Restraining Order, you have the right to a hearing before a judge. 

If a hearing has not been scheduled already (see box about “Exceptional 
Circumstances Hearings” below), you must ask in writing that the hearing take place.   

  To ask for a hearing, you must fill out the form called “Request for Hearing” and mail 
or deliver it to the court before the end of 30 days from the date you were served 
with the Restraining Order.  The court’s address should be on the form. 

  This form is part of the court paper that says “Notice to Respondent/Request for 

Hearing” at the top, right hand side of the page.  You should have received a copy of 
this form when you were served with the Restraining Order.  

If you are objecting to the part of the Restraining Order that has to do with custody of 
your children, the court must schedule a hearing within 5 judicial days of receiving 
your request.  You will receive notice of the hearing from the court by mail or 
telephone.  The notice will include the date, time and location of the hearing. 

If you are not contesting the custody parts of the Restraining Order, the court must 
schedule a hearing within 21 days of receiving your request.  You will receive notice 
of the hearing from the court by mail. 

If you request a hearing and then do not go to the hearing, the Restraining Order 
may be up continued and all matters decided against you.

Exceptional Circumstances Hearing 
 
If the judge has decided that there are exceptional circumstances affecting your 
child(ren), a hearing to decide temporary custody will be ordered.   

 If a hearing has been ordered, paragraph 15 of the Restraining Order will be 
initialed by the judge and the Notice on the top of page 1 of the Restraining Order 
and on the top of the Notice to Respondent form will be filled out with the time, place 
and location of the hearing. Read all of the paperwork carefully to see if a hearing 
has been scheduled. 

IMPORTANT: If you disagree with any other part of the Restraining Order, you must 
go to the scheduled exceptional circumstances hearing and let the court know what 
you object to.  This will be your only chance to contest the issuance of the 
Restraining Order or any of its terms. 

  The hearing will be set within 14 days after the restraining order is signed by the 

judge. 

If you want a hearing before that date, your must fill out the “Request for Hearing” 
form and mail or deliver it to the court. The address of the court should be on the 
form.  Otherwise, you do not need to file a Request for Hearing. 

If you want to be heard about the custody of your children and parenting time 
(visitation) or to contest the Restraining Order, you must go to the hearing 

 

If you do not go to the hearing, the Restraining Order may be upheld (continued) and 
all matters decided against you. 

               

         

IMPORTANT NOTICE - RIGHT TO CONSULT WITH OR 
OBTAIN AN ATTORNEY 
 
If you have questions about how the law works or what it means, you may need 
to see a lawyer.  The court clerk cannot give you any legal advice. 

ou do not have to have a lawyer to object to the Restraining Order, but you may 

have a lawyer represent or help you.  If you do not know a lawyer, you may call 
the Oregon State Bar's Lawyer Referral Service at (503) 684-3763 or toll-free by 
dialing 1-800-452-7636.  If you believe you cannot afford a lawyer, ask the court 
staff if your area has a legal aid program that might help you.

WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT RESTRAINING 
ORDER  HEARINGS 

   

  HOW SHOULD YOU ACT AT THE HEARING? 

  Be prepared. 
  Stand when the judge enters the room. 
  Sit down after the judge or clerk instructs you to sit. 
  When talking to the judge, call her or him "Your Honor." 
  The judge, as well as the Petitioner’s attorney or the Petitioner, if they 
have no attorney, may ask you questions.  If you do not understand a 
question, tell the judge.  Do not answer a question until you fully 
understand it. 
If you don’t know the answer to a question, say so.   

 
  Take your time when answering questions and explain your answers if you 

think it is necessary. 

  Be truthful on all matters, even if you think the truth might hurt you in one 

or more instances.   
  Be brief when you can. 
  Be polite and respectful to everyone involved in your case.   

  WHAT IS THE LAYOUT OF THE COURTROOM? 

he  "bench"  is  where  the  judge  sits.    The  judge’s  clerk  usually  sits  off  to  the 
judge’s side or in front of the judge.  Across from the judge are two tables where 
the parties (you and the Petitioner) and their lawyers sit (if either of you has one). 
 

  WHO WILL BE AT THE HEARING? 

  The judge and the judge’s clerk will be there. 
  A  sheriff  may  be  present.The  Petitioner,  his/her  witnesses,  and  his/her 

lawyer may be there.   

  Your witnesses should also be there, if you have any.   
  Don’t be surprised if there are a number of other people in the courtroom. 
They  are  probably  waiting  for  their  own  hearings.    It  is  not  unusual  for 
several hearings to be scheduled at the same time in the same courtroom.

5 

  HOW WILL YOU KNOW WHEN YOUR HEARING 

BEGINS? 

he judge or clerk will call your case.  When you hear your name called, stand  
up and let the judge know that you are there and wait for the judge to give you 
further instructions. 
 

  WHAT HAPPENS  AT THE HEARING? 

he issues that you checked off in your hearing request form will be addressed 
by the judge.  Be ready to tell the judge whether you object to all of the order or 
just to some parts of the order.  The order will be dismissed if you object to the 
entire  order  and  the  petitioner  does  not  prove  to  the  judge  that  he  or  she  is 
entitled to a restraining order. 
 

  WHO GOES FIRST? 

ho goes first is different from judge to judge. Usually, the Petitioner goes first, 

but don’t be surprised if the judge asks you to begin.  
 

  WHAT DOES THE PETITIONER HAVE TO PROVE? 

he restraining order law requires that certain facts be shown by the Petitioner 
before a Restraining Order will be issued or upheld.  These are: 1) that a certain 
relationship  with  the  Petitioner  exists  that  qualifies  for  protection  under  the 
restraining order law; 2) that you have abused the Petitioner within the last 180 
days  (approximately  six  months);  and  3)  that  the  Petitioner  continues  to  be  in 
imminent  danger  of  abuse  from  you  and  that  you  are  a  credible  threat  to  the 
physical safety of the Petitioner or the children (if any).   
 

  HOW  DO  YOU  SHOW  THAT  THE  RESTAINING  ORDER 

SHOULD BE DISMISSED? 

our Own Testimony 

ou are probably the most important witness in your case.  When it is your turn 
to  talk,  you  should  testify  about  the  facts  that  prove  (show)  that  there  is  not  a 
basis  for  upholding  the  restraining  order.    Use  as  much  detail  as  possible  to 
explain  why  the  Petitioner  has  not  proved  the  required  facts.    Also,  if  you 
disagree with the custody and parenting time parts of the Restraining Order, you 
should  testify  as  to  why  you  should  be  awarded  custody  or  different  parenting 
time, if the judge decides to continue the Restraining Order.

Other Witnesses 

eople who know about your situation may be very important to your case.  Try 
to find people who have personal knowledge about the things you need to prove.  
Having  personal knowledge  means  that  these  persons  saw  or heard  something 
directly.  They cannot testify to rumors or opinions, or to what other people told 
them (unless the other person is the Petitioner). 

e sure you know what your witnesses will say before they testify.  You cannot 
ask your witnesses to lie, but you can find out ahead of time what they will say.  If 
their statements  will hurt your case, don’t use these witnesses.  

f you or the petitioner ask, the court may require that witnesses stay outside the 
courtroom when they are not testifying.  

ther Kinds of Evidence 

n  addition to  testimony  of  witnesses,  you may  wish  to  have  the  judge  consider 
physical  evidence  such  as  photos,  reports,  letters,  voice  mail  messages  or 
pieces of clothing or household goods.  Generally,  you need a witness to explain 
each  piece  of  evidence.    That  witness  could  be  you.    You  need  to  explain  why 
the  item  is  relevant  to  the  case,  and  how  the  item  came  into  your  custody.  For 
writings you need to have the person who wrote it testify about it.  For photos you 
need to have the person who took the photo or anyone else who was there when 
the picture was taken explain when and where it was taken and what the photo 
shows.    Getting  the  court  to  consider  physical  evidence  involves  several 
technical  rules  and  it  would  be  good  to  get  legal  advice  if  these  items  are  very 
important to telling your story. 

  WHAT ARE THE PARTS OF THE HEARING? 

 hearing has different parts.  They include: 

pening Statement 

  Some  judges  like  to  hear  "opening  statements."    For  this  reason,  it  is  best  to 
have something prepared.  Once you are before the judge, ask if he or she would 
like to hear your opening statement.   
 
If so, your opening statement should be a short summary of  what you want the 
court to do, what you intend to present, and how your evidence will support your 
position.

The Petitioner’s Case 
 

our Case  

irect Examination 

Usually  the  judge  will  have  the  Petitioner  put  on  his/her  evidence  first.  The 
Petitioner will likely testify and may call witnesses.  You will have a chance to ask 
the Petitioner and the Petitioner’s witnesses questions. 

his  is  your  chance  to  put  on  your  testimony  and  call  your  witnesses.    The 

Petitioner will be allowed to ask you and your witnesses questions. 

irect examination is your chance to ask your witnesses the questions that you 
have prepared. You should know how the witness is going to respond and only 
ask things that will support or relate to what you want the judge to do about the 
Restraining Order.  Your questions should be simple and direct and should be 
aimed at explaining what happened as clearly as possible.   

ross-Examination 

ross-examination is your chance to ask the Petitioner and his or her witnesses 
any  questions  that  you  may  have  after  listening  to  their  testimony.  It  may  be 
easiest if the Petitioner and his or her witnesses have to answer with a "yes" or 
"no" to most of the questions you ask.  You do not have to ask the Petitioner or 
Petitioner’s witnesses any questions. 

losing Argument 

Ruling 

fter  the  testimony  of  the  parties  and  their  witnesses,  the  judge  may  give  you 
the opportunity to summarize the evidence that helps your case.  This is called a 
closing argument. 

nce everyone has testified, the judge will give his or her decision.  The judge 

might keep the Restraining Order as it is, change it, or dismiss it. 
 

Other Laws May Also Apply To You 

hile the Restraining order, or any order continuing or changing this 

order, is in effect, federal law may prohibit you from:  

  Possessing, receiving, shipping or transporting any firearm or firearm 

ammunition.

order and then violating the order.

Keep in mind that the Restraining Order you have received is in effect and 
remains in effect until the court that issued the order modifies it or dismisses it or 
until it expires.   If you are arrested for violating this order, the security amount 
(bail) is $5,000, unless a different amount is ordered by the court. 

he existence of a Restraining Order may affect pending (current) or future 

criminal, civil or family law cases, including cases involving custody and 
parenting time of your children.  You may want to consult an attorney for more 
information about these and other effects the Restraining Order may have. 
 

Enforceability of the Restraining Order 

his Restraining Order, or any order continuing or changing this order, is 

enforceable throughout Oregon.  It is also enforceable in all 50 states, the District 
of Columbia, tribal lands and territories of the United States.

Violation of any provision of this Restraining Order, or any order continuing or 
changing this order, constitutes contempt of court, punishable by a fine of up to 
$500 or one percent of your annual gross income, whichever is greater, or a jail 
term of up to six months, or both.  Other punishments may also be imposed for 
contempt.

Modification of the Restraining Order 
 

At any time after a restraining order has been entered, you or the Petitioner may 
request that the court change, remove, or make less restrictive those parts of the 
order involving 1) custody and parenting time, 2) your removal from the house, 3) 
restrictions on your presence at certain places, or 4) your contact with the 
Petitioner in-person, by telephone or otherwise.  To make a change, you must file 
paperwork at the courthouse.  The paperwork is available at the courthouse or at: 
http://www.obop.net/OJD/OSCA/cpsd/courtimprovement/familylaw/index.page 

 judge will sign an order for the other party to appear at a hearing. Some courts 
set a hearing when you file the papers. Some courts do not set a hearing until the 
other person has been served and given 30 days to respond. Check with the 
court clerk of the county that issued the order to be sure you follow the right 
process.   

Note: if the Petitioner is asking for a change that removes or makes less 
restrictive the parts of the order involving your removal from the house, 
restrictions on your presence at certain places, or your contact with the Petitioner 
in-person by telephone or otherwise, the judge may sign an order changing the 
terms without requiring a hearing. 
 

Renewal of the Restraining Order  
 

The order may also be renewed for another year.  For this to happen, the 
Petitioner must file papers asking the judge to do so and must show that a 
person in the Petitioner’s situation would reasonably fear further acts of abuse by 
you if the order is not renewed.  If the order is renewed, you will be served with 
the renewal papers and will have the right to request a hearing to contest the 
renewal.
