OREGON TAX COURT 
MAGISTRATE DIVISION 
MEDIATION 
 

What is mediation? 

Mediation in the Oregon Tax Court Magistrate Division is an 

informal voluntary process designed to help the parties reach an 
agreement.  A magistrate, acting as mediator, will lead the mediation.  
The parties are in control of the outcome and work together to reach a 
mutually acceptable agreement that settles their dispute.  The parties are 
expected to look to each other (not the mediator) to resolve the issues. 

Mediation is not a trial.  There is no “winner” or “loser.”  The 

expectation is that all parties leave the mediation satisfied with the 
agreement. 

A successful mediation requires that all parties work toward an 
agreement with open minds and respect for each other’s positions and 
ideas.  The process works best when the parties discuss their dispute 
directly with each other, not the mediator.  A settlement is reached when 
all the parties are in agreement.   

What is the role of the mediator? 

The mediator facilitates a conversation between the parties in an 

 
effort to help the parties reach a mutual agreement.  Any agreement 
reached during the mediation is memorialized in writing and signed by 
the parties.  Based on the signed agreement, the court files a judgment 
and closes the case.  

The mediator is the neutral person in the room, who has no 

 
vested interest in the outcome of the mediation.  The mediator is not a 
decisionmaker and will not issue findings of fact or render a decision in 
favor of one party and against another party.  The mediator does not 
make a finding related to the disputed issues.  The mediator will not 
determine who is right or what the settlement should be.  The mediator 
helps the parties clarify the issue or issues, identify points of agreement, 

 
 

1 

Rev 1/22 

and facilitate discussion of settlement options.  Each party should be 
open and honest with the mediator.   

Although settlement is the goal of mediation, not all mediations 
result in settlement. The magistrate serving as mediator will not be the 
magistrate assigned to hear the case at trial if the parties do not reach an 
agreement.  The mediator will not discuss the mediation and related 
information with the magistrate assigned to hear the case at trial. 

 

MEDIATION PROCESS 

How do I request mediation? 

Mediation in the Oregon Tax Court must be at the mutual 

 
request of the parties.  A party interested in mediation should consult 
with the other party or parties before making a request to the court.  
Mediation is not mandatory.  Not all cases or issues are appropriate for 
mediation.   

 

A mediation request will be granted at the court’s discretion.   

 
Once the request is granted by the court, a date and time for the 
mediation will be set.  It is common practice to set the mediation and trial 
date at the initial case management conference.  The mediation date will 
be scheduled to allow sufficient time for the parties to prepare. 

In general, mediations are held in person at the Tax Court 
 
Mediation Center in Salem.  Mediations are infrequently held at a 
location other than the Tax Court Mediation Center, or by telephone.   

What is the mediation process? 

The mediation process begins after the parties mutually agree to 

 
participate.  The mediator will send a letter to the parties approximately 
three to four weeks before the mediation, requesting a position paper.  
The position paper is a confidential document submitted to the mediator.  
The position paper will not be shared with the other party or parties 

 
 

2 

Rev 1/22 

involved in the mediation or with any other magistrates.  The position 
papers will not be part of the court’s case records.  

Failure by any party to submit a position paper by the 

 
deadline will result in a cancellation of the mediation. 

What should I include in my position paper? 

The position paper should include the main issues to be 
discussed during the mediation.  The position paper should identify the 
strengths and weaknesses of each party’s position.  A party may also 
include any suggestions that would be helpful to reach an agreement.   

The position paper provides an opportunity for each party to 

think about how the dispute can be resolved, considering various 
outcomes and strategies to reach a mutual agreement.  It is important to 
remember that each party’s position will have strengths and 
weaknesses.  Each party’s position paper should include not only the 
strengths, but also the weaknesses of its position.  A common mistake is 
to list only the strengths of your position and list only the weaknesses of 
the other party’s position.  That approach is not beneficial because it fails 
to offer assistance to the mediator who is working with all parties to 
reach an agreement during mediation.   

The mediator is able to assist the parties to reach an agreement 

when the mediator is made aware of all relevant information, and when 
the parties have an honest view of their positions.  

Who can represent a party? 

A party may represent itself at mediation or a party may be 

 
represented by a person who is authorized to represent that party in the 
Magistrate Division of the Oregon Tax Court.  Each party participating in 
the mediation must have at least one person in attendance with full 
authority to settle all matters and issues.  It is unacceptable to delay 
the mediation process because an authorized representative needs 
to get approval to settle the disputed matter based on the mutual 
agreement of the parties who are present at the mediation.

Rev 1/22 

Is the mediation confidential? 

In general, written and oral communications made in connection 

with this mediation are confidential and may not be disclosed to any 
other person, subject to statutory exceptions.  ORS 36.220(1); see also 
TCR-MD 10.  There are exceptions for communications related to abuse 
and the prevention of serious crime, as well as where disclosure to a 
third party is protected by an evidentiary privilege (such as the lawyer–
client privilege).  ORS 36.220(5)–(7).  Evidence otherwise admissible or 
subject to disclosure outside of the mediation does not become 
inadmissible or protected from disclosure solely by reason of its use in 
this mediation.  See ORS 36.220(3)–(4). 

Certain specific rules apply to the Oregon Department of 

Revenue.  See OAR 150-305-0320 (“Any statements made during 
mediation will be confidential except as provided for in ORS 314.840.”) 

What are the rules and proper conduct for mediation? 

The mediation process itself is not governed by formal rules or 
procedures that must be followed.  The mediator will outline the basic 
procedures for the mediation.  Parties should follow rules of common 
courtesy and show respect to the other parties.  Parties should not 
interrupt each other.  Parties should be respectful of all comments, 
suggestions, ideas, and positions. 

 
The parties may meet together with the mediator in the same 
room, individually with the mediator in different rooms (referred to as a 
caucus), or in some combination of the two.  No two mediations are 
alike, and the parties are encouraged to actively participate in designing 
a mediation process that is most beneficial to them.  

What should I expect during mediation? 

 
The mediation will be scheduled for at least one full day.  The 
parties should be prepared to spend the entire day at the mediation.  
Breaks may be taken at any time.  If a party requires a specific break 
time, that request should be made at the start of the mediation. 

 
 

4 

Rev 1/22 

Each party should come to the mediation with an open mind and 

 
with a goal of settlement, and expect the other parties to do the same.  
Each party should be flexible in its positions and be prepared to have the 
strengths and weaknesses of its position discussed during the mediation.  
A party should expect to listen and be heard.  Each party should be 
treated with respect by all of the other parties involved. 

Each party should not assume or expect that the relief requested 

 
will be that reached by the parties at the conclusion of the mediation.  A 
mutual agreement frequently requires each party to compromise with 
respect to its requested relief or desired outcome. 

What is the outcome of mediation? 

 
Mediation will have one of two outcomes.  If the parties agree, 
the court will issue a judgment reflecting that agreement and close the 
case.  If the parties are not able to reach an agreement, the case will 
continue to trial.   

If the parties are unable to reach an agreement during the 

 
mediation, the parties are encouraged to continue to discuss the issues 
and work toward a settlement before trial.  The scheduled trial will not be 
taken off of the court calendar until a stipulation signed by all parties is 
filed by the court.
