Be  It  Enacted  by  the  People  of  the  State  of  Or-
egon:

SECTION  1.  ORS  45.272  is  amended  to  read:
45.272.  As  used  in  ORS  45.272  to  45.297:

(a)  Any  contested  case  hearing  conducted  under

ORS  chapter  183;  or

(b)  Any  hearing  conducted  by  an  agency  in

45.275.  (1)(a)  The  court  shall  appoint  a  qualified
interpreter  in  a  civil  or  criminal  proceeding,  and  a

of  the  court,  agency  or  hearing  officer.

(b)  The  court  shall  appoint  a  qualified  inter-
preter  in  a  criminal  proceeding  whenever  it  is
necessary  to  interpret  the  proceedings  to  a

cise  in  open  court  a  right  that  is  granted  by
Article  I,  section  42  or  43,  of  the  Oregon  Con-
stitution,  including  the  right  to  be  present  at  a
critical  stage  of  the  proceeding.

(2)  A  fee  may  not  be  charged  to  any  person  for
the  appointment  of  an  interpreter  to  interpret  testi-
mony  of  a  non-English-speaking  party  or  witness,  to
interpret  the  proceedings  to  a  non-English-
speaking  party  or  victim  or  to  assist  the  court,
agency  or  hearing  officer  in  performing  the  duties
and  responsibilities  of  the  court,  agency  or  hearing
officer.  [A  fee  may  not  be  charged  to  a  non-English-
speaking  party  who  is  unable  to  pay  for  the  appoint-
ment  of  an  interpreter  to  interpret  the  proceedings  to
the  non-English-speaking  party.]  A  fee  may  not  be
charged  to  any  person  for  the  appointment  of  an  in-
is  made  to  determine
terpreter 

if  appointment 

whether  the  person  is  [unable  to  pay  or]  non-
English-speaking  for  the  purposes  of  this  section.

[(3)  A  non-English-speaking  party  is  considered
unable  to  pay  for  an  interpreter  for  the  purposes  of
this  section  if:]

[(a)  The  party  makes  a  verified  statement  and
provides  other  information  in  writing  under  oath
showing  financial  inability  to  pay  for  a  qualified  in-
terpreter,  and  provides any other information required
by  the  court  or  agency  concerning  the  inability  to pay
for  such  an  interpreter;  and]

[(b)  It  appears  to  the  court  or  agency  that  the
party  is  in  fact  unable  to  pay  for  a  qualified  inter-
preter.]

[(4)]  (3)  Fair  compensation  for  the  services  of  an
interpreter  appointed  under  this  section  shall  be
paid:

(a)  By  the  county,  subject  to  the  approval  of  the
terms  of  the  contract  by  the  governing  body  of  the
county,  in  a  proceeding  in  a  county  or  justice  court.
(b)  By  the  city,  subject  to  the  approval  of  the
terms  of  the  contract  by  the  governing  body  of  the
city,  in  a  proceeding  in  a  municipal  court.

(c)  By  the  state  in  a  proceeding  in  a  circuit

from  the  Public  Defense  Services  Account  estab-
lished  by  ORS  151.225  or  from  moneys  appropriated
to  the  Public  Defense  Services  Commission.  Fees  of
an  interpreter  necessary  for  the  purpose  of  commu-
nication  between  appointed  counsel  and  a  client  or
witness  in  a  criminal  case  are  payable  from  the
Public  Defense  Services  Account  or  from  moneys
appropriated  to  the  Public  Defense  Services  Com-
mission.

(d)  By  the  agency  in  an  adjudicatory  proceeding.
[(5)]  (4)  If  a  party,  victim  or  witness  is  dissatis-
fied  with  the  interpreter  appointed  by  the  court,  the
hearing  officer  or the designee of the hearing officer,
the  party,  victim  or  witness  may  request  the  ap-
pointment  of  a  different  [certified]  interpreter.  A  re-
quest  under  this  subsection  must  be  made  in  a
manner  consistent  with  the  policies  and  notice  re-
quirements  of  the  court  or  agency  relating  to  the
appointment  and  scheduling  of  interpreters.  If  the
substitution  of  another  interpreter  will  delay  the
proceeding,  the  person  making  the  request  must
show  good  cause  for  the  substitution.  Any party may
object  to  use  of  any  interpreter  for  good  cause.  Un-
less  the  court,  hearing  officer  or  the  designee  of  the
hearing  officer  has  appointed  a  different  interpreter
for  cause,  the  party  using  any  interpreter  other than
the  interpreter  originally  appointed  by  the  court,
hearing  officer  or  the  designee  of  the  hearing  officer
shall  bear  any  additional  costs  beyond  the  amount
required  to  pay  the  original  interpreter.

[(6)] (5) A judge or hearing officer, on the judge’s
or  hearing  officer’s  own  motion,  may  substitute  a
different  interpreter  for  the  interpreter  initially  ap-
pointed  in  a  proceeding.  A  judge  or  hearing  officer
may  make  a  substitution  under  this  subsection  at
any  time  and  for  any  reason.

[(7)]  (6)  A  court  may  allow  as  costs  reasonable
expenses  incurred  by  a  party  in  employing  the  ser-

1

OREGON  LAWS  2015

vices  of  an  interpreter  in  civil  proceedings  in  the
manner  provided  by  ORCP  68.

[(8)]  (7)  A  court,  a  hearing  officer  or  the  desig-
nee  of  a  hearing  officer  shall  require  any  person
serving  as  an  interpreter  for  the  court  or  agency  to
state  the  person’s  name  on  the  record  and  whether
the  person  is  certified  under  ORS  45.291.  If  the  per-
son  is  certified  under  ORS  45.291,  the  interpreter
need  not  make  the  oath  or  affirmation  required  by
ORS  40.325  or  submit  the  interpreter’s  qualifications
on  the  record.  If  the  person  is  not  certified  under
ORS  45.291,  the  interpreter  must  make  the  oath  or
affirmation  required  by  ORS  40.325  and  submit  the
interpreter’s  qualifications  on  the  record.

[(9)]  (8)  For  the  purposes  of  this  section:
(a)  “Hearing  officer”  includes  an  administrative

law judge.

(b)  “Non-English-speaking  person”  means  a  per-
son  who,  by  reason  of  place  of  birth  or  culture,
speaks  a  language  other  than  English  and  does  not
speak  English  with  adequate  ability  to  communicate
effectively  in  the  proceedings.

(c)  “Qualified  interpreter”  means  a  person  who
is  readily  able  to  communicate  with  the  non-
English-speaking  person  and  who  can  orally  transfer
the  meaning  of  statements  to  and  from  English  and
the  language  spoken  by  the  non-English-speaking
person.  A  qualified  interpreter  must  be  able  to  in-
terpret  in  a  manner  that  conserves  the  meaning,
tone,  level,  style  and  register  of  the  original  state-
ment,  without  additions  or  omissions.  “Qualified  in-
terpreter”  does not include any person who is unable
to  interpret  the  dialect,  slang  or  specialized  vocabu-
lary  used  by  the  party,  victim  or  witness.

SECTION  3.  ORS  45.285  is  amended  to  read:
45.285.  (1)  For  the  purposes  of  this  section:

law judge.

(c)  “Person  with  a  disability”  means  a  person

is  readily  able  to  communicate  with  the  person  with
a  disability,  interpret  the  proceedings and accurately
repeat  and  interpret  the  statements  of  the  person
with  a  disability  to  the  court.

(2)  In  any  civil  action,  adjudicatory  proceeding
or  criminal  proceeding,  including  a  court-ordered
deposition  if  no  other  person  is  responsible  for  pro-
viding  an  interpreter,  in  which  a  person  with  a  dis-
ability  is  a  party  or  witness,  the  court,  hearing
officer  or  the  designee  of  the  hearing  officer  shall
appoint  a  qualified  interpreter  and  make  available
appropriate  assistive  communication  devices  when-
ever  it  is  necessary  to  interpret  the  proceedings  to
the  person  with  a  disability,  or  to  interpret  the  tes-
timony  of  the  person  with  a  disability.

(3)  In  any  criminal  proceeding,  the  court
shall  appoint  a  qualified  interpreter  and  make

disability  and  who  seeks  to  exercise  in  open
court  a  right  that  is  granted  by  Article  I,  sec-
tion  42  or  43,  of  the  Oregon  Constitution,  in-
cluding the right to be present at a critical stage
of  the  proceeding.

[(3)]  (4)  A  fee  may  not  be  charged  to  the  person
with  a  disability  for  the  appointment  of  an  inter-
preter  or  use  of  an  assistive  communication  device
under  this  section.  A  fee  may  not  be  charged  to  any
person  for  the  appointment  of  an  interpreter  or  the
use  of  an  assistive  communication  device  if  appoint-
ment  or  use  is  made  to  determine  whether  the  per-
son  [has]  is  a  person  with  a  disability  for  the
purposes  of  this  section.

[(4)]  (5)  Fair  compensation  for  the  services  of  an
interpreter or the cost of an assistive communication
device  under  this  section  shall  be  paid:

(a)  By  the  county,  subject  to  the  approval  of  the
terms  of  the  contract  by  the  governing  body  of  the
county,  in  a  proceeding  in  a  county  or  justice  court.
(b)  By  the  city,  subject  to  the  approval  of  the
terms  of  the  contract  by  the  governing  body  of  the

to  the  Public  Defense  Services  Commission.  Fees  of
an  interpreter  necessary  for  the  purpose  of  commu-
nication  between  appointed  counsel  and  a  client  or
witness  in  a  criminal  case  are  payable  from  the
Public  Defense  Services  Account  or  from  moneys
appropriated  to  the  Public  Defense  Services  Com-
mission.

(d)  By  the  agency  in  an  adjudicatory  proceeding.

preter  for a person with a disability, or a person who
meets  the  requirements  of  ORS  45.275  for  an  inter-
preter  for  a  non-English-speaking  person.

(2)  Except  as  provided  by  this  section,  whenever
a  court  is  required  to  appoint  an  interpreter  for  any
person  in  a proceeding before the court, or whenever
a  hearing  officer  is  required  to  appoint  an  inter-
the court,
preter in an adjudicatory proceeding,
hearing officer or the designee of the hearing officer
shall appoint a qualified interpreter who has been

ficer  or  designee  of  the  hearing  officer,  in  the  dis-
cretion  of  the  court,  hearing  officer  or  the  designee
of  the  hearing  officer,  may  appoint  a  qualified  inter-
preter  to  act  as  an  interpreter  in  lieu  of  a  certified
interpreter  in  any  case  or  adjudicatory  proceeding.

(3)  The  requirements  of  this  section  apply  to  ap-
pointments  of  interpreters  for  persons  with  disabili-
ties  and  for  non-English-speaking  persons.

(4)  The  court,  hearing  officer  or  the  designee  of
the  hearing  officer  may  not  appoint  any  person  un-
der  ORS  45.272  to 45.297,  [or] 132.090 or 419C.285  if:
(a)  The  person  has  a  conflict of interest with any

firmation  that  the  interpreter  will  make  a  true  and

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
