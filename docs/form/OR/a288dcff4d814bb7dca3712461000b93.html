EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

The Oregon Judicial Department’s (OJD) circuit court monitoring of guardianship and 

conservatorship cases is a quilt of varied policies and practices. This report describes an in-depth 
look at these practices based on surveying and interviewing staff and judges, reviewing case 
filings, and data generated by the case management system. It highlights instances of 
effectiveness and explains where improvement could be targeted. 

Background – Guardians and conservators are granted substantial authority by a court to 

make decisions and manage the lives of Oregonians who are determined not able to do so 
themselves. Unlike many other case types in Oregon circuit courts, protective proceedings 
require judges and staff to vigilantly monitor the wellbeing of the protected person while 
scrutinizing the performance of their fiduciary, in some cases for decades. From the filing of the 
first petition seeking appointment of a fiduciary through the final report confirming the 
appropriateness of the fiduciary’s last actions, courts have been granted extensive investigative 
and protective authority in the execution of substantial responsibility. As Oregon’s population 
increases and ages, it is the purpose of this assessment to consider our courts’ policies and 
highlight where they could be strengthened. 

Findings and Conclusions – Survey results convey a picture of three tiers of circuit 

courts, generally divided by protective proceeding caseload. The largest tier is generally better 
staffed with a stronger foundation of monitoring practice afforded by training, resources, and 
experience. The middle tier maintains a mix of established process, with strong monitoring on 
some elements of cases and less-developed methods on others. The smallest tier has few 
predictable filings, with judges and staff carrying diverse responsibilities for many non-
protective proceeding case types.  

Every circuit court in the state performs some aspects of case monitoring well, but rarely 
are these aspects universal to all circuits. Some courts are especially diligent before a fiduciary is 
appointed, with stringent processes in place to ensure that appointment is necessary, while others 
appear to focus on monitoring the fiduciary’s administration of the proceeding post-appointment.  

There are specific areas where centralized support would strengthen many courts’ ability 
to better monitor individual cases. Development of materials, resources, and building community 
among judges and staff, will foster long-term improvement statewide and reduce the dependence 
on any particular individuals’ experience or direction.

INTRODUCTION 

 

Between 2010 and 2020 the number of Oregonians aged 65 or older rose from 14% of the 

state population to 18.6%1, notably higher than the national average growth for that 
demographic.2 Such a rise represents a population increase of older Oregonians of 46.9%3, with 
the number of older Oregonians expected to grow even faster in years to come.4 Nationally, the 
number of Americans aged 85 or older is expected to nearly double from 6.5 million in 2020 to 
11.8 million in 2035.5 Based on preliminary court data gathered between January 2020 to 
present, an estimated 40% of the adult protective proceedings in Oregon involve someone aged 
65 or older at the time of filing. The tremendous growth of the older American population, 
predicted as early as 20086, carries with it a direct and correlated impact on Oregon’s probate 
courts, which hold jurisdiction over guardianship and conservatorship proceedings.7     

Although the rise in Oregon’s older population has been expected8, it is not the only life 
circumstance correlated with an increase in protective proceeding case numbers. There are many 
other conditions an individual may experience that causes them to seek the assistance of the 
court and indicia of these conditions also appear to be on the rise. Specifically, the number of 
adults with serious mental illness increased nationally from 8.3 million to 14.2 million between 
2008 and 20209 and there are estimated to be more than 7 million people in the United States

with an intellectual disability.10 Further, the United States has a reported 2.87 million emergency 
room visits for traumatic brain injury every year.11  

Oregon’s growing aged population, combined with these types of illnesses and injury, 

have relatedly increased media attention on individuals affected by guardianship or 
conservatorship, and not just for well-known celebrities12. Since 2010 the Oregonian newspaper 
has published no less than 15 articles directly relating the anecdotal guardianship and 
conservatorship experiences of people in Clackamas, Clatsop, Lane, Linn, Multnomah, 
Washington, and Yamhill counties.13 The Oregon Judicial Department’s court monitoring 
efforts, as reflected in these stories, would be charitably characterized as mixed.  

Within the context of an expanding caseload and increased attention to the efforts our 

state courts provide, the Office of the State Court Administrator (OSCA) applied for and 
obtained an Elder Justice Initiative Grant (EJIG) from the Administration for Community Living 
(ACL). The EJIG intended to support state courts in assessing and implementing improvements 
in their handling of guardianship and conservatorship process, including enhancements to 
fairness, effectiveness, timeliness, safety, and integrity of the system.14 Through funding of the 
EJIG, OSCA hired two employees, an auditor and an analyst, who began this work with existing 
staff in the Juvenile & Family Courts Program Division (JFCPD) and Internal Audit Office (IA). 
This report is the product of the first year of grant work, encompassing OSCA’s examination of 
the monitoring practices of our state circuit courts, the findings from that research, and 
recommendations that will support the goals of the EJIG purposes.  

Definitions and Background 

Many of the legal definitions applied to individuals within this assessment are terms of 
art, granting specific power and authority to some, and potentially removing substantial rights 
from others. Precision matters a great deal when considering the consequences that stem from 
involvement in these types of court proceedings. With an eye towards a baseline of specific

vocabulary, used near constantly throughout this assessment, several distinctions and definitions 
follow.    

At its most basic, a protective proceeding15 in Oregon is a court-approved relationship 

between one person or entity (the “fiduciary”16) and another person (the “respondent”17) 
wherein the fiduciary requests to be appointed by a court to assume certain duties with respect to 
the respondent. A respondent becomes a “protected person”18 when a court finds they lack the 
ability to make certain decisions for themselves. In Oregon a guardian is appointed when the 
protected person is deemed incapacitated, meaning that their ability to receive and evaluate 
information effectively, or to communicate decisions, is impaired to such an extent that the 
person presently19 lacks the capacity to meet the essential requirements for the person’s health or 
safety. A conservator is appointed when the protected person is deemed financially 
incapable.20    

Within this report “respondent” is used to refer to an individual before any appointment 
of a fiduciary is made. Once either a guardian or conservator has been appointed, the individual 
is then referred to as the “protected person,” as a protective order21 would then have been 
entered. Unless otherwise noted, any statutory citation related to protective proceedings will be 
found in Oregon Revised Statutes Chapter 125. The Uniform Trial Court Rules, a set of 
statewide directives applicable to all circuit courts, provide additional direction to counties, with 
each circuit’s Supplemental Local Rules (SLRs) and Presiding Judges Orders (PJOs) rounding 
out the most granular policies for cases discussed in this assessment. The contours of these 
authorities will be discussed more particularly below. 

 

15 “Protective proceeding” means a proceeding under this chapter. Or. Rev. Stat. § 125.005(9). 
16 “Fiduciary” means a guardian or conservators appointed under the provisions of this chapter or any other 
person appointed by a court to assume duties with respect to a protected person under the provisions of this chapter. 
Or. Rev. Stat. § 125.005(2) (2021). 

17 “Respondent” means a person for whom entry of a protective order is sought in a petition filed under 

ORS 125.055. Or. Rev. Stat. § 125.005(10) (2021). 

18 “Protected person” means a person for whom a protective order has been entered. Or. Rev. Stat. § 

125.005(7) (2021). “Protective order” means an order of a court appointing a fiduciary or any other order of the 
court entered for the purpose of protecting the person or estate of a respondent or protected person. Or. Rev. Stat. § 
125.005(8) (2021).  

19 Emphasis added. “Incapacitated” means a condition in which a person’s ability to receive and evaluate 

information effectively or to communicate decisions is impaired to such an extent that the person presently lacks the 
capacity to meet the essential requirements for the person’s physical health or safety. Or. Rev. Stat. § 125.005(5) 
(2021). “Meeting the essential requirements for physical health and safety” means those actions necessary to provide 
the health care, food, shelter, clothing, personal hygiene and other care without which serious physical injury or 
illness is likely to occur. Id.  

20 “Financially incapable” means a condition in which a person is unable to manage financial resources of 
the person effectively for reasons including, but not limited to, mental illness, mental retardation, physical illness or 
disability, chronic use of drugs or controlled substances, chronic intoxication, confinement, detention by a foreign 
power or disappearance. Or. Rev. Stat. § 125.005(3) (2021). “Manage financial recourses” means those actions 
necessary to obtain, administer and dispose of real and personal property, intangible property, business property, 
benefits and income. Id.  

21 “Protective order” means an order of a court appointing a fiduciary or any other order of the court 
entered for the purpose of protecting the person or estate of a respondent or protected person. Or. Rev. Stat. § 
125.005(8) (2021).

The Oregon Judicial Department (OJD) presently uses the Odyssey22 case management 

software, which was implemented in different counties on a rolling basis from 2012 to 2016. 
Oregon Judicial Information Network (OJIN), the antecedent to Odyssey, was a rudimentary 
command-based management system, dependent on paper case files. Using OJIN, individual 
courts invented creative workarounds to mitigate the limitations of the software. Despite 
substantial efforts to thoughtfully convert OJIN cases to Odyssey cases during implementation, 
the effect of unexpected Odyssey conversion issues still appears in older protective proceeding 
cases.23             

 Summary of Recent Protective Proceeding Work in Oregon Courts 

While the award of grant funds has provided the ability to hire dedicated staff to work on 

this assessment and interventions aimed at refining the quality and focus of our courts, the 
process of improving court monitoring of protective proceedings is not new to Oregon. Through 
foundational work of organizations such as the National Association for Court Management 
(NACM), the National Association of State Court (NCSC), the State Justice Institute (SJI), the 
American Bar Association (ABA), and previous support from the ACL, past projects and 
workgroups in Oregon have been built on widespread academic and practical policy aspirations. 

Since 2013 the OJD has supported and facilitated the Oregon Working Interdisciplinary 
Network of Guardianship Stakeholders (WINGS) to bring stakeholders from various disciplines 
together for short-term and long-term planning and action. Through an initial WINGS grant and 
subsequent grants from the ABA Commission on Law & Aging, Oregon WINGS has produced 
materials and tools for professionals and the public about decision-making options, person-
centered planning, alternatives to guardianship, and other curriculum to better understand 
protective proceedings. 

Like WINGS, but more directly court-focused, the State Protective Proceedings Advisory 
Committee (SPPAC) has existed in some form since 2015. Originally organized as the “Chapter 
125 Subcommittee” of the State Family Law Advisory Committee (SFLAC) to focus specifically 
on protective proceedings, it was chaired by two now-retired judges before being spun off into its 
own entity in late 2020. SPPAC produced a series of court visitor training videos, worked on a 
“Decision Making Protocol” bench guide for judges, and crucially developed policy and protocol 
recommendations regarding COVID and the handling of guardianships. Those recommendations 
were adopted by the Chief Justice to maintain reliability during the pandemic and notably 
prescribed remote appearance for protective proceeding hearings.24

Most important for its influence on this self-assessment, SPPAC guided OSCA’s creation 
of the Protective Proceedings Data Dashboard, which was an invaluable tool used during the data 
gathering and analysis phase. The Data Dashboard automatically collects a variety of 
demographic trend data and presents it graphically through a Power BI25 interface. During the 
pandemic SPPAC was less active, but without SPPAC’s foundational data work and inspiration, 
this assessment would not contain the breadth of information on which this review has relied.  

Lastly, following the full implementation of Odyssey in all courts, OSCA initiated efforts 

to connect circuit court probate staff with each other to collaborate on standardized business 
processes using a Process Improvement Team (PIT). PIT meetings connected disparate counties 
in a way that had not been done before, allowing for conversations about business processes, 
case monitoring strategies, and provided networking for similarly situated employees.   

Methodology 

This statewide assessment was guided by a growing body of literature regarding 

recommended improvements to protective proceeding practices26 and drew inspiration from 
recent survey-based assessments of court practices performed on a national level.27 Each phase 
of the assessment was collaboratively reviewed by an advisory committee (AC) comprised of 
community partners and protective proceeding stakeholders. 

Each AC member was solicited to participate in this project to incorporate their 
experience with our courts and provide individual perspective. The AC membership, in addition 
to OSCA support staff and judges, included the Oregon Long Term Care Ombudsman, 
representatives from Oregon AARP and Disability Rights Oregon, a court visitor, a professional 
fiduciary, a formerly protected person, a private protective proceedings attorney, and two Trial 
Court Administrators (TCAs). 

The data collection phase of this project was comprised of multiple steps designed to 
gather thorough and accurate information about protective proceeding case management and 
monitoring. The process included corroborative mechanisms to confirm self-reported behavioral 
information. It also included methods designed to identify trends in data, both in terms of court 
practice and of case demographics and circumstances. The six steps implemented to gather data 
are discussed more thoroughly below, but included:

etermining Monitoring Obligations of Oregon Courts 

Before any circuit courts were contacted, the analyst performed a thorough review of the 
Oregon Revised Statutes and UTCR, itemizing each instance where courts “must” or “shall” do a 
particular thing. Very early in the chapter, ORS 125.025 (titled “Authority of the court in 
protective proceedings.”) states that “a court having jurisdiction over a protective proceeding 
shall exercise continuing authority over the proceeding,” and then continues to contextualize that 
authority in the broadest sense, stating that “the court may act upon the petition or motion of any 
person or upon its own authority at any time and in any manner it deems appropriate to 
determine the condition and welfare of the respondent or protected person and to inquire in the 
proper performance of the duties of a fiduciary appointed under the provisions of this chapter.”  

The list of instances when a court “may” do a particular thing was also included in the 
itemization under the rationale that if the statute suggests a particular action the legislature is 
making a recommendation as to performance. The analyst presented the list to the AC for review 
and discussion. In addition to the gathered opinions of the AC, the OSCA team consulted The

participants throughout this report. Reference to a “respondent” will only mean a party responding to a petition for 
appointment of a fiduciary.

National Probate Standards for comparison and juxtaposition.29 The finalized list titled “Oregon 
Protective Proceeding Court Guidance” was divided into five sections covering different stages 
of a typical protective proceeding (petition through closing), with individual standards included 
for various filings or circumstances. The guidance document, which contains citations to statute, 
UTCR, and other sources, was conferred when reviewing court practices in the Discussion 
section below.   

In addition to the statutory and UTCR review, the analyst completed a comparative SLR 

analysis. The SLRs are additional rules promulgated by each judicial circuit and allow for 
clarification or local interpretation of statute or uniform rule. Despite ostensible standardization 
via ORS and UTCR among circuit courts, SLRs create a wide variation in the practice of 
protective proceedings, depending on where they are filed. Such variance is a consideration 
when viewing how courts monitor cases, and what may need to be standardized or changed to 
improve court supervision. It was likewise considered when analyzing the data gathered during 
the assessment.    

TCA Survey  
To identify individuals within the court system that work on protective proceedings and 

collect preliminary information, OSCA created an online survey that was issued to each circuit’s 
TCA. The TCA is the administrative head of each court.  

The 8-question survey asked TCAs to identify the staff and judges in their court who 

could be contacted to complete a substantive survey about their county’s methods and practices. 
It also asked about the types of trainings provided to those individuals, what tools, materials, or 
trainings would be most desirable, and asked the TCA to score their own court on how well they 
feel they supervise and mange protective proceedings. A copy of the TCA survey is included in 
the References.     

Statewide Survey  
All judges and staff identified in the TCA survey were invited to complete a more 

substantive 31-question survey about their monitoring practices. The OSCA team in 
collaboration with the AC developed the content and questions for the “Statewide Survey.” The 
survey was designed to identify the courts’ monitoring work as it relates to each step of the 
process, mirroring the structure established in the Court Guidance document.   

The questions began with inquiries into petition acceptance and review and continued 

through notice, visitors, and appointment of fiduciaries before advancing into reporting, 
accounting, and resolution of objections. Additional questions sought information regarding the 
courts’ business processes, training, and educational/materials preferences. Finally, the survey 
asked the user to score their court’s performance on monitoring cases. Inclusion of a self-

assessment score, both in the Statewide survey and the TCA survey, was included as a method to 
compare perceived performance before future interventions. At periodic intervals during and 
after intervention projects, future surveys can be used comparatively to track effectiveness and 
confidence.   

Each court was allowed to provide as many responses to the full survey as they wished to 

confirm reported practices and identify any ambiguities or conflicts between answers. It also 
encouraged engagement from participants with different roles in the courts. As will be evident in 
the graphs in the Results section, the total answers to a particular question are not a one-to-one 
representation reflecting whole circuits’ practices. In some instances, survey answers were better 
considered on an individual basis, and for others an understanding of the circuits’ practice is 
more meaningful. For those questions in the latter category, the narrative will supplement the 
data to clarify what the responses reflected as to circuits. A copy of the Statewide Survey is 
included in the References.  

Odyssey Case Sample Review 
While the statewide survey was underway, the project analyst 

began a process of Odyssey case sampling to review data entry and 
case management practices demonstrable in case records. The Data 
Dashboard allows a user to sort by county, year, case type, and sub-
type, among other sorting options.   

Case volume precluded a comprehensive review of all cases 
filed in a particular county but did allow for the analyst to access a 
sample of cases to confirm survey answers. It also assisted in 
identifying differing practices between counties and discovering 
issues for follow-up conversation or clarification. The analyst 
confirmed survey data using this method, and tracked questions 
reserved for the next step of the assessment. 

One additional purpose of the Odyssey case sampling 
approach was to review the accuracy of the underlying data that is 
viewed in the Data Dashboard. Cases that might be characterized as 
“non-complying” for a certain data query could be checked for 
specific content to confirm whether they were counted or measured 
correctly. For instance, if a county had a suspiciously small number of 
cases involving respondents aged 65 or older at the time of the petition filing, the cases not 
flagged as “under 65” could be double-checked. In that way the “cleanliness” of the data query 
could be confirmed, and any data entry concerns could be identified.    

Data Dashboard Sort Options 

Follow-Up Interviews with Survey Participants 
After survey completion and case sampling, relevant judges and staff were invited to 

participate in a follow-up interview. Interviews were intended to be loosely structured, informal 
conversations about the assessment project with a focus on clarifying discrepancies. Notes from 
each county’s interview were combined with survey response information and Odyssey sampling 

13 

 

 

information to produce a data sheet that represented the details of the county’s policies, practices, 
and preferences. A copy of the data sheet template is included in the References.  

Data Dashboard Inter-County Comparison  
The final component of the data gathering process was a comparison of specific data 

trends between counties. Various statistics were compared to uncover potential correlation 
between particular monitoring practices and representative performance. Per OJD Data Use 
Guidelines, the Data Dashboard cannot be reproduced or published at this time. The data held in 
the dashboard will be discussed generally.              

Results 

Before describing the results of the 

assessment, the following information will be 
helpful when reviewing the assessment 
results. First, any representative statistics 
regarding case counts, numerical information, 
or circuit courts’ percentage compliance with 
certain measures were retrieved during the 
first week of September 2022. Many statistics 
fluctuate with daily updates from Odyssey, so 
the numbers presented are a discrete snapshot 
in time and may have changed slightly since 
retrieval.  

Second, the 36 counties in Oregon are 
divided into 27 judicial districts. While most 
judicial districts contain only one county, 
several more rural counties are combined to 
form a single judicial district. In districts containing more than one county, efforts were made to 
determine whether practices vary between district courts within the same county. For instance, 
Hood River and Wasco, two counties within the same district, completed separate surveys and 
interviews as practice varies slightly within, but Wallowa and Union counties, making up the 
10th judicial district, completed joint responses as the probate work there is centralized in one 
circuit courthouse.  

Oregon Circuit Courts 

Third, probate jurisdiction in Oregon was transferred to 

the circuit courts in 1969 excepting six county courts, which 
still retain jurisdiction. Probate jurisdiction in Gilliam, Grant, 
Harney, Malheur, Sherman, and Wheeler Counties vests in the 
circuit court only when appealed from the county. As a result, 
those counties only minimally participated in the assessment. 
Their pending caseload makes up only 19 total cases out of 
14,372 active protective proceedings in Oregon. Since the 

Pending Protective Proceeding Cases in Circuit 
Courts where Probate Retained by County Court

percentage of overall case volume is small, the effect of the absence of their cases should not 
materially affect the assessment results.  

Finally, nothing conveyed in these results will identify specific judges or staff by name, 
nor does it intend to identify any specific county with their responses. Results will be presented 
in the aggregate, with data categorized by response type or theme. The focus of this assessment 
is on trend and pattern of practice and identifying strategic interventions for improvement. If 
county-specific findings warrant outreach to those counties, this report defers that decision to 
OJD decisionmakers.

survey, the TCA data is 
relatively limited. 24 of 27 
counties submitted responses 
within 15 days, but the three 
unresponsive districts were 
not those where county courts 
retain probate jurisdiction. In  
four counties, surveys were 
forwarded to relevant staff, 
other than the TCA, who 
submitted responses on the TCA’s behalf. Additionally, the survey allowed for skipping 
questions with narrative prompts or offering more than one answer to the prompt. This resulted 
in varied number of responses used for each question, even if the sampling size of the survey 
itself was constant (n=24).

Peer-to-Peer Training

Business Process/ODY Help

Training Provided

There were four substantive TCA 
survey questions. The first asked: “What 
protective proceeding training is provided to 
staff?” The responses were open-ended, 
allowing for more than one answer, but can be 
broken down into five types. If more than one 
form of training was described, both were 
entered, even if in the same survey response. 
“Business Process/ODY Help,” the most 
common training answer, refers to the online 
Odyssey help system. This guide is focused 
primarily on the mechanics of accepting filings and entering data, and while it does include 
statutory reference, it does not discuss any substantive protective proceeding considerations. 
Peer-to-peer or supervisor-led on-boarding was the next most common training. Four TCAs 
responded that they provide their staff any webinars or remote training they come across, and 
two TCAs reported that their circuits maintain local written guides for staff. One court relies only 
upon what the judge trains clerks on.

Form of Training

In the same way they were asked what 
training is provided, the survey inquired as to 
what training topics would be preferred, and in 
what preferred form that training should take. 
Notably, more than half of the responses 
regarding training topics were “I don’t know” or 
a variation on “Any training would be 
appreciated.”   

The final TCA question asked them to 

rate (scale 1-10) their court’s ability to 
effectively monitor proceedings and explain 
why. Of the 23 survey responses that included a 
self-score, all responses varied between five and 
ten with an average statewide score of 7.32. 
Counties scoring themselves on the higher end 
(four gave themselves perfect 10/10 scores) were 
more likely to explain their score based on the 
experience or reputation of their court staff (10 - 
“We have a long-term and highly experienced 
staff and judges.”). Those counties scoring 
themselves lowest cited a lack of understanding 
of what to focus on in their case tracking (5 – 
“We are in the process of improving how we 
manage/supervise [protective proceedings], 
learning as we go.”).

tatewide Survey & Follow-Up Interviews 

The next three steps of the data collection efforts included the Statewide Survey, Odyssey 

case sampling, and targeted follow-up interviews with relevant judges and staff. For clarity of 
reporting, the Odyssey and interview steps are integrated into the results of the statewide survey. 
The Odyssey review will only be specifically discussed if it conflicted with the survey and 
interview representations. The interviews provided confirmation of practice and the opportunity 
to clarify some of the survey answers.

WHO COMPLETED THE SURVEY? 

The survey received 54 total 
responses from 26 of the 27 judicial districts. 
The average time spent completing the 31-
question survey was 33 minutes. Of the 
survey participants, 17 were judges, 11 were 
“Probate Commissioner/Probate 
Coordinator,”30 four were clerks who do only 
or almost only probate matters, and the 
remainder were clerks or supervisors who 
assist with probate but have other primary 
responsibilities (including all six participants 
describing their title as “other”). The map 
shows the number of responses from each 
judicial district.

Follow-up interviews were performed with 45 of the survey participants from 25 of the 

27 circuits. Ten of the interviewees were judges, two were TCAs, and the remainder were 
probate commissioners or clerks (both probate and more than probate). Most interviews 
conducted were 45-60 minutes long.  

To gauge probate staffing levels, the survey first asked whether each court has either staff 

or judges dedicated only to probate cases - staff or judges who work only on probate matters. 
Seven responses stated “Yes, we have a judge or judges who do only (or almost only) probate 
case work,” 22 responses stated that their court has staff or clerks who perform only (or almost 
only) probate case work. The remaining 29 responses indicated that their circuit has neither 
judges nor staff focused primarily on probate case work. Only the largest districts have staff 
solely working on probate matters, and despite the seven responses indicating districts have

dedicated probate judges, all judges participating in the survey stated that they have more than 
just probate case responsibility, even the chief probate judges in several circuit courts.  

WHO IN THE COURT MONITORS CASES?      

Following the initial demographic questions, the survey pivoted to questions regarding 
substantive court practices, by asking who in the participant’s court reviews the content of the

statutorily required pre-
appointment filings. Each 
participant was allowed to choose 
more than one reviewer for each 
item. In most circuits, judges 
review the petition, the visitor’s 
report, and the form of judgment, 
while staff is more likely to be 
responsible for checking notice-
related elements. Some elements 
were reviewed by both staff and 
judges. In those circuits with 
probate commissioners, the 
commissioner states that they 
review each element. Of additional 
note was that in two circuits where 
judge and staff responded 
separately, there were conflicting 

responses as to delegation of checking notice. This suggests that the judge believed the clerk was 
doing so, but staff believed the judge was.  

Follow-up interviews generally confirmed the survey answers but did provide additional 

context. The most common practice in those courts without a probate commissioner is that the 
clerk reviews the filing sufficiency (caption, filing fee, signatures, etc.), and will do a cursory 
content review, noting any concerns for the judge. The judge then reviews the petition, visitor’s 
report, notice, and form of judgment after the clerk forwards the judgment following expiration 
of the notice period. In courts with a probate commissioner, the commissioner substantively 
reviews each pre-appointment filing, sending concerning issues on to a judge. These same 
circuits are also likely to include a checklist in the case file to confirm each element of a petition 
was corroborated, with five courts using a locally created checklist.

BACKGROUND CHECKS

As part of the petition phase 
questions, the survey asked whether 
the court completes any form of 
background check on the petitioner, 
the respondent, or the nominated 
fiduciary (if different from the 
petitioner). Though not a statutory 
requirement, some form of 
background check may assist the 
court in determining the 
appropriateness of the nominated 
fiduciary. While far more courts 
were likely to check names of 
parties within the Odyssey system 
than perform a different method of 
background checks, almost a third of participants answered that they do not check backgrounds 
at all. One county, in addition to an Odyssey name check, asks that nominated non-professional 
fiduciaries consent to a Law Enforcement Data System (LEDS) check before appointment. The 
two other participants indicating a different form of background check were judges who said 
additional checks were on a case-by-case basis and only if there were indications a check would 
be necessary. They did not clarify the form of that “other type” of background check.

HEARINGS ON UNCONTESTED MATTERS 

By statute, courts may set a hearing on any petition or motion but must set one when the 

respondent or protected person objects or there is a motion to modify the guardian’s power.31 
Courts were asked on what pre-appointment, uncontested issues they might require a hearing. 
Most participants (29) responded “Not required,” however multiple responses and subsequent 
interviews included instances in which they would set a hearing before appointment. Those 
responses that identified circumstances in which a hearing may be necessary, despite the absence 
of an objection, included:  

•  Judicial concerns with filings in the case, whether on content or background 

checks (seven responses). Interviews suggest that hearings before appointment but 
after a judge’s review of the file are more prevalent than the survey suggests. All 
judges indicated that they would set a hearing if they had unanswered questions 
about the content of a petition, or any other issue, in a filing. 

•  Concerns raised by a visitor in the visitor’s report (three responses). All circuits 

have an SLR32 that requires courts to set hearings when visitors note objections in 

 

31 Or. Rev. Stat. § 125.080(1), (2) (2021). 
32 SLR 9.081, adopted in all circuits, allows the respondent or protected person to make objections orally to 

the court visitor, who is required to include any objections in the visitor’s report. The exact language of SLR 9.081 
varies slightly between jurisdictions, but the relevant portion regarding visitors is universal.

their report, but these responses indicated the court will set a hearing on a matter 
if the report indicates concerning information notwithstanding the lack of an 
objection. 

•  The competency of an unrepresented petitioner/fiduciary to proceed with the case 
without counsel (three responses). In cases in which an unrepresented petitioner 
seeks appointment, the court will set a hearing date to discuss the responsibilities 
with the petitioner and determine their competency.  

•  All cases seeking a temporary fiduciary appointment (three responses). One 

circuit requires a hearing before any temporary appointment. If waiver of notice is 
requested the petitioner and fiduciary (if different) must appear in court. For 2-
day notice cases, the appearance must be set after the expiration of the notice and 
the notice must include the hearing details such that parties may appear. 

TEMPORARY APPOINTMENTS 

On the topic of temporary petitions, courts were asked whether they require different 

factual pleadings in petitions for temporary or emergency appointments. Two judges indicated

that they did not know whether there was 
a difference and two judges said there 
was no difference. If answering “Yes,”

“For a temporary or 
emergency appointment, the 
pleadings must demonstrate an 
immediate and serious danger to 
the life/health (for guardianship) or 
estate (for conservatorship) of the

action is required.” 

participants were asked to explain what the 
difference was. 47% responded with some variation 
quoting or citing to ORS 125.600 et. seq.33 which 
does heighten the pleading requirements and 
requires the court to make specific findings by clear 
and convincing evidence. Two of the “Yes” answers stated they require supplemental doctors’ 
information, but one of those two stated attorneys had vocally complained to a judge that notes 
should not be required. That district has since waived the expectation of doctors’ notes and 
temporaries have been granted more frequently.

UNPUBLISHED LOCAL POLICIES 

Unwritten or informal polices, such as supplemental doctors’ information that might be 
required, was the focus of the next survey question. It asked whether the participant’s court has 
any special local policies, separate from UTCR or their SLRs, that affect practices or monitoring. 
Prompts in the question included Presiding Judge Orders (PJOs), practice guides hosted on the 
court’s website, or any unwritten practice expectations. Almost all participants responded with a 
variation of “No,” with only six “Yes” answers, which explained that there are informal rules 
regarding extensions and PJOs for visitor issues (addressed separately). During the interview 
phase though, nearly every court identified at least two policies within six discrete categories:  

•  Tips and policies directed at attorneys filing protective proceedings posted on the 
court’s website or circulated as Continuing Legal Education materials (four 
Circuits). 

•  PJOs appointing probate commissioners (or deputies), including the authorities 

granted to those commissioners (six or seven circuits; One court could not locate 
the PJO during the pandemic).  

•  Expectations regarding formatting and the bounds of requests for extensions (13 

• 

circuits, addressed in more depth below).  
Informal policies for alerting the court when an attorney plans to file a temporary 
or emergency petition, to make sure that it is prioritized in workflows (five 
circuits).  

•  Pandemic-related practice rules, especially regarding remote appearance hearings 
(all circuits were required to adopt procedures, and many continued to allow 
remote appearance in protective proceedings well after the rest of their circuit 
case types resumed in-person hearings).34 During interviews many staff suggested 
that parties appreciated the flexibility of remote appearance options.  

•  PJOs addressing visitor qualifications, procedures, and fees (19 circuits were 

aware of their PJOs; two believed they had them but could not locate them).     

COURT VISITORS 

With respect to visitors, the survey asked how the participant’s court manages 
appointment and reporting for their visitors. Per ORS 125.165 each circuit’s presiding judge is 
directed to establish, subject to minimum statutory requirements, qualifications for persons 
serving as visitors and the standards and procedures to be used by visitors in the performance of 
their duties. The presiding judge is also directed to establish fees (by PJO) for visitors conducting 
interviews and preparing their reports.35  

During the data collection process, the analyst collected 14 circuits’ PJOs regarding 

visitors, with 3 additional circuits’ interviewees confident that their court had one, but unable to 
find it. Three circuits do not have any PJOs regarding visitors, 10 circuits are unknown. Six

whether the circuit has a pre-

whether the court chooses the 
visitor to be appointed or whether 
the petitioner nominates a visitor. 
22 of the 27 circuits maintain a list 
of court visitors. 11 counties 
within five judicial districts do not 
have any visitor list. All 11 are in 
the smallest third of circuit courts 
when measuring by the number of 
cases filed and cases pending. Six 
of those counties have county-retained probate jurisdiction leaving five counties without any 
known, qualified visitors. One county responded that they do maintain a list, but it presently has 
nobody on it.

Selection of a court visitor is more commonly done by the court, on a rotation from the 

list of visitors, but other methods of selecting visitors were shared through survey responses and 
during interviews. Several circuits maintain a list of visitors but rely on the petitioner, or their 
attorney, to contact one of the visitors for their consent to appointment. The court then appoints 
the selected visitor. Lastly, two circuits have no list, rely on the petitioner to nominate a visitor, 
and leave fee arrangements to be settled between visitor and fiduciary. Visitor qualifications in 
those counties can only be done on an ad hoc basis, if at all.  

The fee due for a court visitor’s appointment is difficult to compare between judicial 

districts because some PJOs direct visitor fees be by the hour, subject to a potential maximum, 
but others direct a flat fee. Further complicating fee comparison is that some courts differentiate 
between the fee for indefinite appointment and the fee for temporary appointment. Still others 
may assess additional visitors’ fees when that visitor must appear at a contested hearing.36 The 
chart included on page 22 shows the range of court visitor fee that could be due to the visitor for 
four hours of their time.37 Those courts with only one data point represent flat visitor fee PJOs. 

 

36 All PJO instances of supplemental court visitor fees in contested matters require the additional fee to be 

paid by the non-respondent/protected person objector.  

37 One prolific and long-serving court visitor commented that four hours is an underestimation of the 

average time obligation. She believed it was at least 6 hours of work for her average appointment, and “probably 
closer to 8 hours.

visitor is appointed, the fee for four hours of work could be as low as $140 or as high as $750. If

districts. There was no observable correlation between the size of a court visitor’s fee and the 
case volume of the court.  

APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL  

As part of earlier work done to improve 

court monitoring, OSCA assisted all courts 
with the implementation of SLR 9.081. That 
rule instructs parties on how oral objections 
may be made to the court, including the 
respondent’s oral objections to visitors and the 
visitor’s obligation to convey objections as part 
of their report. ORS 125.155, which provides 
minimum elements of a visitor’s report, also 
includes the obligation to include any express 
communication made by the respondent about 
their desire to be represented by counsel.38 
Although appointment of counsel remains 
permissive in most of Oregon39, Senate Bill 
578 (2021), which amended ORS 125.080, 
made appointment of counsel for respondents 
and protected persons mandatory under 

 

38 Or. Rev. Stat. § 125.155(2)(g) (2021). 
39 Or. Rev. Stat. § 125.080 (2021). 

 

 

specific circumstances, with a graduated rollout of the change until 2024 when the change 
applies statewide. Since all counties will need to prepare to appoint counsel, participants were 
asked whether their courts were able to appoint counsel for a respondent or protective person 
when either that person or another interested person has objected.  

Of the 54 participants, 18 (representing 12 judicial districts) indicated that their court has 

a list or knows of attorneys who they can appoint, and the court can usually find an attorney to 
appoint. Another 14 participants try to appoint counsel if they can. Six participants representing 
five judicial districts say they have no reliable counsel to appoint. 11 of the 13 participants chose 
the “Other” choice option and entered a comment focused on how difficult it is to find counsel 
for respondents and protected persons when they know there is no money in the estate to pay for 
a lawyer.  

Despite some challenges to appointing counsel, 26 counties across 22 judicial districts 

have appointed counsel sometime in the last five years, but more than two-thirds of all attorney 
appointments occurred in just three counties. Appointment of counsel and the effect of Senate 
Bill 578 are discussed in more detail below.  

TIMELINESS OF OBJECTION HEARINGS  

Once an objection has been filed, and a case becomes contested, courts are required to set 

a hearing40 even though the statute remains silent as to the timeliness of that hearing. There are 
only two instances in the statute indicating a timeline on which a hearing must occur. One is 
when an objection is filed to a temporary appointment41, and the other is found in ORS 125.323 
when a guardian moves to limit an association of the protected person. For the latter motion, the 
hearing must be scheduled no later than 60 days from filing.42 Two circuits, by SLR, require that

contested cases complete alternative dispute resolution before being heard. That extra 
requirement would be expected to delay those circuits’ setting objection hearings.  

Participants were given choices of the general scheduling contours for objection hearings: 

Less than 30 days from the filing of the objection (16 responses); Between 30 and 60 days from 
the filing of the objection (19 responses); More than 60 days (1 response); or “It Depends” (17 
responses). Selecting “It Depends” allowed the participant to clarify their answer, with 12 of 
those responses differentiating between contested temporary proceedings set within two court 
days, and indefinite petitions. Seven of the 17 “It Depends” responses did not know how their 
circuit scheduled matters. The rest were split between “Less than 30” (4); Exactly 30 days (2), 
and “Between 30 and 60 days” (4).  

Although there is not presently a report or query to track the timeliness of protective 

proceeding hearings within Odyssey, case sampling reveals many objections to indefinite 
appointment of a fiduciary led to hearings that occurred well beyond 60 days from the filing of 
the objection. In some of the largest districts, objections filed during 2020 and 2021 took six to 
nine months to be held. It is unclear what correlation exists between pandemic-related court 
restrictions and delay in holding objection hearings.      

POST-APPOINTMENT INSTRUCTIONS & EDUCATION  

The next survey topic began a series of questions regarding the appointment and post-

appointment monitoring phases. Courts were asked about what training or educational 
requirements are expected of newly appointed, non-professional fiduciaries. Based on the 
responses to the survey, and confirmed by Odyssey review, 28 participants (representing 15 
judicial districts) issue an instructional letter to the fiduciary that includes a general outline of 
their fiduciary obligations and the due dates for future filings. 14 participants (representing eight 
judicial districts) require newly appointed non-professional fiduciaries to complete a remote-
access education course tailored to the type of appointment the fiduciary holds. The one

participant who responded that the course is required but no letter issues was mistaken, and their 
circuit does issue a letter in addition to requiring the course.  

The remainder of the responses (less one “I don’t know” response whose circuit issues a 
letter but does not require the course) do not issue any instructional letter nor do they require any 
non-professional fiduciary education. All circuits that do require the training course coordinate 
with a non-profit called Guardian Partners.43  

FORM OF LETTERS  

Once appointed by judgment, courts are 

expected to issue letters of guardianship or 
conservatorship in “substantially the same form” as 
prescribed by ORS 125.310 (guardianship) or 
125.405 (conservatorship). OSCA has established 
a statewide form available through Odyssey for 
court use, but not all circuits use the statewide 
letters template. The participants reporting use of a 
local form (21 responses), who were later 
interviewed, cited dissatisfaction with the format 
of the statewide form and had implemented a local 
version in Odyssey that better reflected their 
business processes following a fiduciary’s 
appointment. Two participants (representing two 
circuits) reported that their circuits rely on a form 
of letters to be submitted by the fiduciary, but 
information in Odyssey suggests that may only be 
accurate for one circuit. All responses in the “I 
don’t know how letters issue” choice were from 
judges whose circuits were represented by either 
use of the statewide version or their own local version of letters.

The ORS, UTCRs, and various SLRs prescribe post-appointment filings be submitted by

appointment44, inventory45, annual guardian’s report46, and annual accounting.47 Courts were 
asked whether they track these future filings, and if so, how. Odyssey software allows for time 
standards to be set or for case events to carry due dates, both of which can be set up to

whether they track completion of a fiduciary class (if required in their circuit)48, and whether 
they track submission of bond and/or acknowledgment of restriction.49 While asking about due 
date tracking, the visitor’s report (due 5-15 days after the appointment of a visitor50) was 
included.

The most important piece of the data collected on due dates is whether certain filings are 
tracked, rather than how they are tracked. Through discussion with court staff, many individuals 
have a strong preference for either “due dates” or for “time standards,” though either can produce 
functional tracking. Based on survey responses the most-tracked filings are guardians’ reports 
(all circuits), inventories (all but one circuit), and annual accountings (all circuits). The least 
likely to be tracked, apart from the fiduciary course which not all circuits require, is the notice of 
appointment of a guardian. While a relatively recent addition to statute, during the interview 

 

48See e.g. Multnomah County SLR 9.076 requiring submission of a certificate of completion of the non-

professional fiduciary course within 90 days of the date of appointment.  

49 An acknowledgment of restriction, permitted under UTCR 9.050, must be submitted within 30 days of 

the date of the judgment appointing. The acknowledgment of restriction functions in lieu of bond by including a 
prohibition on the removal of funds from a depository account without express court order. Although the filing of a 
bond has no fixed or standard due date, ORS 125.405 directs courts to issue letters of conservatorship after 
submission of a bond, but diligent courts would track the submission of a bond as the mechanism of asset protection.

portion, almost half of those interviewed were unaware of the requirement or what the due date 
was. 

Participants were asked to describe any additional due dates they may add to a case. 

Responses included: 

•  Due date added to petition to appoint fiduciary to follow-up on appointment 

•  The end of the month in which a minor protected person will turn 18 years old, to 

documents; 

terminate a minor guardianship; 

•  Six-month status reports in conservatorships that initially do not have assets (such 

as personal injury settlement matters);  

•  Follow-up ticklers when late document courtesy notices issue to a fiduciary, to 

take “next steps” if the missing filing has not been submitted; and 
•  The expiration of any extension granted by letter or motion/order. 

EXTENSIONS  

The focus of the next survey question regarded parties’ requests for extension. 
Participants were asked an open-ended question as to whether their courts have a process for 
handling requests for extension on filings. Two circuits have adopted SLRs addressing their 
policies for extensions, but most others have an informal set of internal guidelines. These 
guidelines are typically liberal with the first request for extension, and more stringent with 
subsequent extensions or those asking for a longer grant of time. Of the 44 participants who 
explained their court’s considerations, relevant features include:  

•  Unrepresented parties may make their first (and sometimes subsequent) request 

for extension by letter. Generally, if a party requests a due date extension for more 
than 60 days, unrepresented parties must submit a motion, declaration, and order.  
•  About half of circuits allow attorneys to make their first extension (or sometimes 

subsequent) request by letter or email. 

•  Clerks are broadly allowed to grant first extension requests up to 30 days, but 

judges review almost all requests made past 60 days.   

•  No circuit will consider anything less than a motion/order if the request extends a 

due date more than 90 days from the original time due. 

•  Most courts will use case notes, document notes, or updated time standards to 

track extensions and the judge’s comments and directions.     

ASSET PROTECTION  

Except for those cases in which good cause is shown, ORS 125.410(1) bond (or other 

asset protection) is expected to secure against misappropriation. Participants were asked whether 
their court requires a bond or other asset protection. Just over half of participants represented that 
their court requires a bond and/or restriction unless good cause is shown. 12 answered that the 
court would defer to the request of the petitioner unless the matter was contested. Four said that 

28

Asset Protection in Conservatorships?

bond is not generally 
required, and nine didn’t 
think the options described 
their process. Of those nine, 
six responses were very close 
to the other options with four 
of those six noting that it is 
up to the judge to decide 
whether a bond will be 
waived. One judge did not 
know whether bonds were 
required in their circuit.  

A cursory case sample

in Odyssey makes clear that 
participants generally 
overstate their courts’ 
requirement for bond or 
restriction, and when a more 
comprehensive count is done, the requirement of bond/restriction is even less likely in any case. 
Multiple participants who said that bond was required represent circuits where the observed 
frequency of bond/restriction is less than one in four cases. One commissioner’s response may 
best describe the results with respect to bonds: “Most of the time parties request bond or 
restrictions be waived. I review the pleadings and note my suggestions before sending it to the 
judge. I feel like it’s half and half whether the bond is waived or not.”  

REVIEW OF GUARDIAN REPORTS  

Question 18 of the survey asked participants to explain their court’s process for review of 

the guardian’s report. Five participants skipped this prompt, but the 49 narrative answers 
received, coupled with extensive discussion in the follow-up interviews, form a general outline 
of how guardian reports are reviewed. There are three common patterns, largely linked to a 
circuit court’s caseload size, for report review: 

• 

• 

• 

In the smallest circuits, clerks accept the reports and screen them for 
completeness – has the guardian completed the report form and signed it? The 
clerk then routes the electronic version of the report to the judge assigned to the 
case and sets the next due date. If the judge has concerns about the content of the 
report, they will direct the clerk as to next steps. 
In medium sized circuits, a probate clerk will review the content of the report in 
addition to the filing sufficiency. They will add document notes about their 
review before routing the electronic version to the assigned judge. That judge will 
direct the clerk if subsequent action is deemed necessary.  
In the largest circuits, a probate clerk or probate commissioner will review the 
content of the report after a different clerk screened for completeness. Most 
probate commissioner’s survey responses included the specific elements of the 

29 

 

 

report that they make sure to check, such as the need to continue the guardianship, 
any money handled by the guardian, and substantial changes from the previous 
year’s report. Based on their review, the probate clerk or commissioner may 
directly inquire with attorneys or parties about the content of the report, or if 
satisfactory, direct the due date for the subsequent report. The probate clerk or 
commissioner will send concerning reports to a judge, but if there are no concerns 
the judge may not see that year’s guardian’s report. When sent concerning reports, 
judges often direct staff to set a hearing.    

One notable practice discovered through this assessment, not linked to court size was 

several circuits’ practice of judicially “approving” guardian’s reports, either by judicial note of 
review or by a court-prepared form order. At least four circuits prepare a separate order to 
approve each guardian’s report. Several other circuits’ clerks check to find a judge’s initials or 
signatures on the report when it is returned from the judge. 

In addition to the survey question regarding review of reports, participants were asked 

whether their circuit requires guardian reports in minor guardianships. 12 participants 
representing eight circuits said reports were not required, two participants were unsure, and the 
remainder said reports were expected. A survey of Odyssey supports that general representation. 
In minor guardianships in those circuits that do not expect a report, no annual due date is set, 
instead setting an “age-out” date to track the time at which the court would close the matter on 
their own motion when the protected minor turns 18.     

ACCOUNTINGS 

Question 20 led off several inquiries into courts’ review of conservatorship accountings 
by asking whether the participants’ circuit requires accountings to be substantially in the form 
required by UTCR 9.160. Under ORS 125.475, provides the information required to be 
submitted as part of the conservator’s accounting but then allows the Chief Justice to specify by 
rule the form and contents of that information.51 UTCR 9.160, with UTCR 9.170 covering 
fiduciary disclosures, and UTCR 9.180 addressing vouchers and depository statements, are the 
product of that rulemaking. The form provided by the rules (or substantially in the form provided 
in the UTCR Appendix of forms) must be accepted by all courts, but the rule is also drafted to 
allow a court discretion as to what form of accounting they may allow in lieu of UTCR 9.160. 
UTCR 9.160 reserves SLR 9.161 for any circuit’s adoption of a mandatory rule requiring 
formatting as in UTCR 9.160.  

In the survey results nearly every participant stated that the UTCR 9.160 format for 

accountings is required in their circuit. Seven participants answered that the format is not 
required. Two participants answered that they do not know what is required in that standard.  

51 Or. Rev. Stat. § 125.475(2), (3), (7) (2021).  

 

30 

 

 

Unfortunately, Odyssey review and consideration 

of the enacted accounting-related SLRs reveals a 
disconnect between the survey results and the actual 
accountings accepted into cases. 14 judicial districts have 
adopted SLR 9.161 which requires UTCR 9.160 
formatting. Of the seven “No” responses in the survey, 
three were from participants in SLR 9.161 circuits. One of 
those circuits also adopted an SLR that waives 
corroborating vouchers. The conflict between an SLR 
requiring UTCR formatting and an SLR waiving elements 
of UTCR formatting may be why the participant answered 
“no.” Seven additional circuits have also implemented an 
SLR that limits the corroborating documents to be filed 
with acccountings (vouchers waived; only opening/closing 
depository statements filed; etc.).  

Of those participants who said that UTCR 9.160 

formatting is required, only one circuit has SRLs both 
requiring the formatting and explicitly requiring vouchers 
and depository statements. Odyssey review and 
interviewing confirmed an additional three circuits that 
routinely require UTCR 9.160 because they have an 
auditor or examiner on staff. Most circuits accept the 
formatting of accounting as the fiduciary files it whether it 
includes all UTCR 9.160 accounting elements or not.   

Four circuits have implemented SLRs allowing for

waiver of an annual accounting when all assets in the conservatorship are held in a restricted 
account, requiring the annual filing of a bank statement showing the balance of the account in 
lieu of a full accounting. When assets are restricted, any disbursement from the account requires 
court ordered approval. One circuit only allows this option if the conservatorship was opened for 
a minor. Based on the survey responses, an additional six circuits follow the same practice of 
allowing a statement of restricted assets in lieu of an accounting, for both adults and minors, 
though they do not have a written rule to that effect. 

After those questions regarding the formatting of accounting, participants were asked 
about how accountings are reviewed once they have been filed. Question 22 provided various 
parts of a UTCR 9.160 accounting and asked who, if anyone, reviews that portion. Those 
accounting elements included the asset schedule52, the list of receipts and disbursements53, 

 

52 UTCR 9.160(2).  
53 UTCR 9.160(3).  

31 

 

 

depository statements54, vouchers55, a narrative of any changes in the assets56, any special 
requests for approval of fiduciary actions or changes to the fiduciary’s authority57, any attorney 
or fiduciary fees requested58, and the notice of opportunity to object and proof of mailing 
notice.59 Options for who reviews 
each included the judge, the 
auditor/commissioner, the clerk, 
the element is not reviewed, or the 
element is not required to be filed.  

Who Reviews Accountings? What Do They 
Review?

Based on the answers 

selected, if the circuit has a 
commissioner (or auditor), that 
person will do a substantive 
review of all parts of an 
accounting before sending either 
the accounting or judgment to the 
judge. In those counties without a 
commissioner or auditor, judges 
were most likely to review any 
narrative portion of the 
accounting, the attorney fee 
requested, and the asset schedule. 
As confirmed by interviews, 
judges often do not have time to 
review the content of the receipts 
and disbursements lists, the 
depository statements, or confirm 
that the vouchers match those 
lists. They are also more likely to 
have staff check notice and proof.

In those counties without a commissioner or auditor, probate staff may do some 
substantive review of the content of the accountings, but were more likely to review filings only 
to confirm the elements were filed. They would then send the accountings on to judges for more 
thorough consideration. Anecdotally, small counties generally rely on objections to accountings 
or any obvious red flags to trigger the need for a more detailed judicial review.

ADDRESSING CONCERNS, REQUESTING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, & ISSUING 
CITATIONS OR SHOW CAUSE 

Participants were next asked three related, open-ended questions: 

• 

• 

If anyone reviewing the above-listed items [accounting elements] finds 
concerning information, what would the reviewer’s “next steps” be in addressing 
the concerns? 
If your court has a standardized process for requesting additional information or 
amendment of a filing, what is that process and who is responsible for initiating 
that process? 

•  Does your court have a local process for issuing citation, show cause, or contempt 
orders to fiduciaries in protective proceedings? If so, please describe that process.  

The responses are best considered in synthesis given the adjacent content of the questions 

and the overlapping answers provided by participants. Substantial parts of follow-up interviews 
were dedicated to discussion of who raises case concerns and how they are addressed by the 
court. Judges and staff were consistent on the first question, distinguishing the severity of the 
concern and who identified it when describing their courts’ response. Where staff identified the 
concerns, they would customarily add document notes and route the filing to a judge for 
direction. A judge may then direct that staff person to inquire with the party/attorney, issue a 
letter themselves, or set a hearing immediately. Where judges identified the concern, they would 
similarly direct staff, issue correspondence, or direct a hearing to be set.  

In those circuits with probate commissioners, most would issue a letter or request for 

additional information when questions might be resolved with additional information or 
clarification. If the concern was minimal and discretionary, they would note the file and route to 
a judge for direction. If the concern was unambiguously concerning, commissioners responded 
that they would set a hearing immediately.  

In responding to the second question, participants frequently referred to an escalating 

system to clarify or supplement filing. Initially courts will correspond with parties (or attorneys 
when represented). Where the circuit does not have a local form dedicated to requesting 
additional information, they will use an informal request – either a phone call or an email – to 
solicit the party or attorney. Five circuits use a locally standardized form, typically referred to as 
an “audit letter,” “courtesy notice,” or “request for information.” That local form is used for 
gathering additional information or to alert parties of an overdue filing. Nearly all probate clerks 
stated they would add a due date to the Odyssey event to keep track of any response filed by the 
party or attorney. Most judges would direct between 30 and 60 days to respond to the request 
before considering a hearing on the same question.  

 While the question did not differentiate between requests for additional information and 
a notice of overdue documents, most courts treated the failure to file a timely document the same 
way they treated an informational request. For overdue filings, OSCA has produced a statewide 
form which courts can use to notify parties which document(s) may be outstanding. That notice, 

33 

 

 

or the local equivalent, has been used in every circuit within the 12 months preceding this 
assessment, meaning every circuit has a business process in place to track their overdue filings.  

Though each circuit reports a 

Days Between A Filing Becoming 
Overdue and Issuance of a Show 
Cause Order and Hearing Date

process for escalating overdue filings to 
hearing, the timelines on which they 
operate vary substantially. Based on 
survey answers to the third question in 
this group, and supplemented with 
interview follow-up and Odyssey case 
review, there are three judicial districts 
that proceed to Show Cause very 
quickly after the due date has been 
missed for a report or accounting, 
setting a hearing within 30 days of the 
missed due date. Eight judicial districts 
allow 30 days from their courtesy notice 
date before they issue a show cause. The 
remainder (15 judicial circuits) all issue 
one or more late document notices 
before issuing an order and setting a 
hearing. Two of those courts set a 
preliminary “status hearing” before 
escalating to a Show Cause order and 
hearing. One circuit only sets two 
“Show Cause” hearing dates per year, so they wait to issue all show causes for a 6-month period 
at the same time. 12 of the 15 circuits issue two, three, or four late notices before setting the 
matter for show cause, causing 90 days or more to pass before an overdue filing might be 
addressed by a judge.

TERMINATION OF PROCEEDING  

The final substantive court monitoring survey question asked participants under what 

circumstances their court might consider termination of the protective proceeding. Participants 
could choose whether, in each of six circumstances, their court might terminate a protective 
proceeding and could also check “Other” to add additional circumstances by short answer.  

Of the 53 participants who answered this question, 51 said they would terminate upon 

death of the protected person.60 41 participants would consider the protected person’s 
rehabilitation or reported improvement61 and 37 would consider the fiduciary’s failure to file 
reports.62 Participants were less likely to choose the protected person’s move outside of

jurisdiction of the court63 (24 responses), depletion of the protected person’s assets below 
$10,00064 (23 responses), or the death of the fiduciary (20 responses).65 The participants who 
chose to specify other answers offered detailed explanations of their courts’ policies regarding 
termination. Besides the 5 participants who cited a minor’s 18th birthday as reason to terminate66, 
several specific answers are worth including in whole:  

•  “The completion of the purpose of a limited protective proceeding is one 
example. In the case of the death of a fiduciary, the termination would be 
dependent on the specific facts of the proceeding and the protected person’s 
stability/continuing need for a fiduciary.” – Probate Commissioner 

•  “Nothing would be done without good cause. There should be no reason to 

dismiss a guardianship when [the protected person is] out of money; They still 
need protection. Also, the death of a fiduciary is not a reason to leave a protected 
person unprotected. If someone moves out of the jurisdiction we don’t require 
them to close or transfer but we do require regular annual reporting. Sometimes 

 

depend on the judge’s determination of the best interests of the protected person. See, e.g. Or. Rev. Stat. § 
125.315(1)(i) (2021).   

63 Or. Rev. Stat. § 125.090 (2021) allows for termination of the proceedings when it is in the best interests 

of the protected person, which may be the case when the protected person has permanently relocated, but ORS 
125.825, part of Oregon’s Uniform Adult Guardianship and Protective Proceedings Jurisdiction Act, directs that a 
court that has appointed a fiduciary has exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over the proceeding, so the court could 
keep it active by choice. 

64 Or. Rev. Stat. § 125.540 (2021) allows for termination of a conservatorship when the net assets of the 

conservatorship do not exceed $10,000. That statute does not require termination. 

65 Or. Rev. Stat. § 125.230 (2021) terminates the fiduciary’s authority upon the fiduciary’s death, but does 

not explicitly direct termination of the proceeding.  

66 Or. Rev. Stat. § 125.090(2)(a) (2021).

we might recommend that they would be better served [by transferring] their case 
but we have a standing policy that protective proceedings are not arbitrarily 
dismissed.” - TCA 

•  “For a death [of the protected person], we would make sure probate [is] initiated 
if needed. If [the protected person is] rehabilitated or improved, we would use a 
Guardian Partners [volunteer monitor] to check it out and report to the court first. 
If funds were depleted and the person is in a care facility with a payee, we may 
terminate. We would not terminate based on a move unless a proceeding was filed 
in the new location or transfer process completed. If the fiduciary failed to file 
reports, we would show cause. If [they failed to appear], we would do Guardian 
Partners and/or adult protective or DHS reporting. If a fiduciary died, we would 
ensure a new one was appointed if necessary.” - Judge    
 

SELF-RANKING PERFORMANCE, TRAINING PREFERENCES, AUDIT HELP 

In the same way that the final TCA Survey inquired as to self-scoring their court’s 

monitoring efforts and sought preferences on the form and content of future training or 
resources, the Statewide Survey closed with similar questions. Question 27 asked to rank (on a 
scale of 1-10) their court’s ability to effectively monitor proceedings and explain why they 
scored their county the way they did.  

51 participants responded, with an average statewide score of 6.97. Seven participants, 

four judges and three staff, gave their courts a perfect score (10/10), all of whom specifically 
cited the experience of their probate staff as the basis for their score. Nine participants scored 
their courts at 5/10 or less. Six of these responses cited the lack of staff, training, and dependence 
on the case filings to evaluate the protected person’s condition, but the other three responses 
were from judges in larger circuits who appear to have seriously under-scored their circuits 
representative performance by comparison to other courts.

how likely they would be, with 33 choosing “Somewhat Likely” or “Very Likely.” One judge 
strongly believed in using  a central auditor “so long as decision-making authority remained with 
the circuit court judge.”

Ongoing Data Collection Efforts 
Briefly discussed above, the Data Dashboard developed by SPPAC and OSCA, is a 

consistently updated, on-demand access tool for various data queries pulled from Odyssey case 
filings. The dashboard is sorted into tabs holding information of similar type, with a summary of 
that tab’s statewide data query held at the top. Users with access to the dashboard can view the 
content of the queries displayed in chart or graph form summarizing the data set on which that 
chart is based. A user can then right-click on the chart or graph to limit the information by 
certain measures including county, case type (adult or minor),  subtype (guardianship, 
conservatorship, both, or unknown), or within a certain date range (by year, quarter, or month). 
Most usefully, a “drill down” feature allows for a user to see a case list on which the query is 
based. The case list includes relevant data points used in creation of the measurement and also 
served as an efficient way to find particular case types to confirm reported circuit court practices.  

At the time of this assessment, there were 12 tabs containing the following summarized 

data, with notes on how the data is sorted:  

1.  Cases Filed – By default, cases are sorted by filing year of the petition (2017 

through present). The tab also displays the percentage of cases filed by case type 
and subtype.   

2.  Timely Disposition & Clearance Rate – By default, cases are sorted by filing 

year (2017 through present) into two measures: The percentage of adult protective 
proceedings with a determination on appointment made within 90 days and the 
percent clearance rate. For the former, “disposition” means either appointment of 

  

38 

 

 

a fiduciary or dismissal of the petition. The “drill through” case list shows the 
number of days between petition and disposition. Clearance rate is measured by 
the number of cases closed divided by the number of cases filed.  

3.  Pending Cases by Case Type & Subtype – Pending cases, which are open and 
active at the time of measure, are tracked by case type and subtype, with the 
number of pending cases tracked over time from 2020 to present.  

4.  Pending Cases by Years Since Filing – Pending cases sorted into “age brackets” 
since filing (less than 1 year, 1-5 years, 5-10 years, 10-15 years, 15-20 years, 20-
25 years, 25 years or more), and also the median years since filing for each case 
type and subtype. This is a snapshot tab, so not sortable by past time periods. 
Over 5% of open Oregon protective proceedings are over 25 years old.    
5.  Judge and Staff Workload – Estimated annual judicial FTE and staff FTE 

necessary per NCSC Workload Assessment Model Documentation67 (though only 
for one time period 2017-2019).  

6.  Assets Under Conservatorship, Over Time – Displays the total known assets 

under conservatorship (as based on the most recent value entered in Inventory or 
Accounting event type) and the percentage of cases with known asset value, 
shown over time. Also shows the estimated total value of assets under 
conservatorship, extrapolated using the value of the known percentage, applied to 
the total pending case number.  

7.  Assets Under Conservatorship, by Court – Displays a snapshot of the total 
known assets under conservatorship by county, the percentage of cases with 
known asset values, and the extrapolated number based on the known-value 
applied to the total pending number of cases. Known assets under conservatorship 
are measured from the most recent Inventory or Accounting data value entered.  
8.  Timeliness of Accountings, Over Time – shows two percentage measures and 

the change over time from 2020 to present: (a) the percentage of conservatorship 
cases open for at least two years with an inventory or accounting filed within the 
past 12 months; and (b) the percentage of conservatorship cases open for at least 
two years with an inventory or accounting filed within the past 18 months.  
9.  Timeliness of Accountings, by Court – Shows two percentage measures, sorted 
by county: (a) the percentage of conservatorship cases open for at least two years 
with an inventory or accounting filed within the past 12 months; and (b) the 
percentage of conservatorship cases open for at least two years with an inventory 
or accounting filed within the past 18 months. Both have options to “drill down” 
to a case list displaying the conservatorship cases, the date of the most recent 
Inventory or Accounting, and whether they have hit 12-month, 15-month, or 18-
month benchmarks. 

10. Timeliness of Guardian Reports, Over Time - shows two percentage measures 
and the change over time from 2020 to present: (a) the percentage of guardianship

cases open for at least two years with a guardian report filed within the past 12 
months; and (b) the percentage of guardianship cases open for at least two years 
with a guardian report filed within the past 18 months. 

11. Timeliness of Guardian Reports, by Court - Shows two percentage measures, 
sorted by county: (a) the percentage of guardianship cases open for at least two 
years with a guardian report filed within the past 12 months; and (b) the 
percentage of guardianship cases open for at least two years with a guardian 
report filed within the past 18 months. Both have options to “drill down” to a case 
list displaying the guardianship cases, the date of the most recent report, and 
whether they have hit 12-month, 15-month, or 18-month benchmarks. 

12. Cases Filed – Respondent 65 or Older at the Time of Filing – Displays the 

number and percentage of adult protective proceedings where the respondent was 
age 65 or older at the time of filing the petition, shown over time from 2020 to 
present. Additionally shows the percentage of adult protective proceedings where 
the respondent was age 65 or older at the time of filing the petition, sorted by 
county.   

Using the data from the dashboard, OJD can make useful comparisons to identify trends 
that warrant investigation or intervention. Accessible, meaningful, and accurate data is a way to 
find patterns in case filings and identify concerns with monitoring practices in order to target 
intervention and improvement at a local and statewide level.         

ANALYSIS & RECOMMENDATIONS 
This statewide self-assessment was undertaken to better understand the local processes of 

each of Oregon’s circuit courts to identify opportunities to enhance fairness, effectiveness, 
timelines, safety, and integrity of protective proceedings. Based on the results of the data 
gathering process, there are a range of concrete opportunities to strengthen court approach and 
process. The following are self-assessment recommendations. 

RECOMMENDATION 1: Statewide Standardized Fiduciary Expectations 

A common theme of the findings presented in this assessment is that monitoring practices 

and court expectations of fiduciaries vary greatly from circuit to circuit. Court staff interviewed 
in multiple circuits reported that fiduciaries’ attorneys and community stakeholders had frequent 
and specific criticism about inter-circuit variance. Variance of practice across the state was also a 
notable and particular concern expressed by multiple Advisory Committee members.   

In some instances, these differences in practice have been an unavoidable result of the 

limitations of smaller county resources. In others, they may stem from an influential judge’s 
opinions on the policies of their circuit. Finally, some courts may deal with a certain case fact 
pattern so rarely that they have no specific policy or plan for monitoring or management, so the 
way that they decide to deal with a new-to-them circumstance takes on an ad-hoc appearance 
with unpredictable results. There are at least two discrete ways to facilitate better uniformity of 

40 

 

 

practice, to standardize expectations of parties, and promote predictability of similarly situated 
cases. This would enhance the fairness and integrity of the system.  

The first would be to systematically look at UTCR and SLR provisions and eliminate 
inconsistencies and ambiguities through amendment while maintaining the ability of courts to 
craft unique rules specific to their particular circumstances.68 Without presuming to identify all 
potential conflicts between these sets of rules, one of the most obvious is the form and content of 
conservatorship accounting. The variance of what constitutes an accounting can lead to 
drastically different acceptable fiduciary behavior, depending on what county the 
conservatorship exists in. A conservator’s management of assets under one set of rules might 
cause them to be removed as a fiduciary in one county but never be identified as a problem in 
another. Fundamentally, there should be predictable community standards by which fiduciaries 
manage assets, paralleling statutory guidelines where provided. The location of a protected 
person’s case doesn’t bear on the likelihood of mismanagement.  

A brief hypothetical situation can demonstrate the disparate outcome from variance in 

accounting formats. Consider a conservator, Conservator Alvin, who diligently visits the 
protected person and takes them shopping every month, purchasing medicine and groceries out 
of the conservator’s own money because they forgot to bring the conservatorship checkbook. 
They reimburse themselves when they get home with a check “grocery reimbursement.” When 
they prepare the annual accounting, they note the reimbursement was for groceries, so describe 
the expense in the disbursements list as “groceries.” Conservator Bob, who doesn’t visit or take 
the protected person shopping, writes himself a check for $100 each month. He characterizes 
each as “groceries” in his annual accounting. 

If the accounting is filed in a county that bars vouchers and interim depository statements 

by SLR, directing conservators only to list the disbursements and a description of the purpose, 
how would a court distinguish between the two situations? If fiduciaries are required to file 
corroborating documents69, as at least contemplated in the UTCR70 before modification by SLR, 
a court could identify Bob’s pattern of undocumented self-dealing and determine if Alvin’s 
single transaction was a concern. Requiring adequate corroborating information supports 
transparency and fairness to interested parties and aids courts in exercising their oversight 
functions.71   

A second way in which fiduciary expectations could be standardized is with thorough 
education for judges and staff. Nearly every Statewide Survey question included multiple “I 
don’t know” answers. Simply put, there is a portion of judges and staff throughout the state that 

 

68 Rulemaking and standardization are encouraged by the National Probate Standards in Standard 2.1.2, the 

commentary of which cites inconsistency between intra-state jurisdictions as a hinderance to legal practice, but 
acknowledges the utility of specific local rules to address specific needs.  

69 Probate National Standard 3.1.5 suggests that probate courts should require fiduciaries to provide 

detailed accountings that are complete, accurate, and understandable. 

70 UTCR 9.160, 9.170, 9.180.  
71 A responsibility implied in ORS 125.025(1), 125.450 and directly stated in National Probate Standard 

3.1.5 and 3.3.17.  

41 

are unsure on what standard of practice should be. This is especially evident if they are in a 
smaller volume circuit that gets infrequent protective proceeding filings. Less than half of 
participants said that a temporary fiduciary appointment required a different level of factual 
pleading than for a longer notice period indefinite appointment, and a fair proportion of 
participants responded that their circuit requires UTCR 9.160 accounting format when it doesn’t. 

OJD should implement a uniform and systematic training module for judges and staff 
whose responsibilities include managing protective proceedings.72 At the initiation of the self-
assessment period the only statewide resource available to courts was the Odyssey Alt-F1 Help 
Guide. While the help guide is directly instructive to staff processing case filings, and does 
contain hyperlinked citations to statutory provisions, there is no substantive training on a court’s 
responsibility. During the interview phase it was clear that judge and court staff universally care 
about the individuals involved in protective proceedings and wanted to better monitor them. 
Unfortunately, there were no established resources for some of them to find more information 
about how to better do so. Creation of training and tools would support efforts to improve the 
scrutiny of fiduciaries throughout the lifespan of a case, and foster consistency among circuits. 
Webinar or video-based trainings were also the highest weighted preference in the future 
resources survey question 28.     

RECOMMENDATION 2: Centralized Resources for Smaller Counties 

A simple, and likely obvious fact is that larger counties have greater resources and are 
more likely to have judges who specialize in specific cases or practice areas. Smaller counties 
have fewer judges and staff, who must manage a more diverse set of customers and cases. Even 
if their overall caseloads are smaller, judges and staff in more rural and smaller-volume circuits 
will individually manage more varied types of cases, as there are fewer others to divide

specializations. Smaller counties also have less developed protective proceeding business 
process, which may be correlated to their smaller case numbers, reflecting calculated time and 
resource cost-benefit considerations of developing more extensive practices. This is not in any 
way to say that these counties ignore these cases. In fact, some were acutely aware of their self-
assessed limitations. Several judges plainly stated that they do not have adequate resources to 
support comprehensive auditing: 

“We are a small court without the resources to do intensive evaluation and oversight of 

complicated conservatorship accountings.” – Judge 

“We try our best with what we have, but we don’t really have the ability to verify all the 

information we receive in an accounting, other than what gets submitted.” – Judge 

Five counties account for over half of the pending protective proceedings in Oregon, each 

of which have a judge who dedicates a substantial portion of their judicial work specifically to 
estate and protective proceedings. Seven of the ten largest circuits (by pending cases and average 
cases filed per year) each have a full-time probate commissioner (or equivalent) who has been 
issued authority to approve certain requests by appointment of a presiding judge.73 Those probate 
commissioners work exclusively on probate case types with dedicated probate clerks (two to four 
full-time clerks, depending on the circuit) supporting case management. By comparison, there 
are only nine individuals who identified as a “probate clerk” in the rest of the state. All other 
staff who participated manage probate cases less than half time, with other case types and 
responsibilities assigned to them as well.  

One notable pattern, identified during the survey and follow-up interviews, was that in 

smaller-sized circuits there was less likely to be a clear business process and assignment of 
responsibility for reviewing the content of petitions for appointments and notice documents. The 
same held true for annual accountings. Some portion of the centralized service developed for all 
courts could be in the form of uniform training and statewide consulting on how best to set up 
local workflows and responsibilities.  

A more directly useful tool for many circuit courts would be an auditing referral service 

where courts could tap a centralized expert to assist with review. Most survey participants 
responded that they would be likely to use an accounting audit option, and the appointment of 
investigators and experts is well within the court’s authority under ORS 125.025.74 A centralized 

 

73 At least two additional circuits would likely warrant appointment of a probate commissioner based on 

their caseloads, with two additional that could also benefit from formalization of such a position. One lower-volume 
circuit court does have a probate commissioner, despite the smaller caseload, but based on the recorded value of 
assets held by conservatorships in that circuit, the commissioner appointment is merited. That circuit was also found 
to have some of the highest scrutiny of accounting filings and audit processes in the state.  

74 The court may act upon its own authority at any time and in any manner it deems appropriate to 

determine the condition and welfare of the respondent or protected person and to inquire into the proper 
performance of the duties of a fiduciary (Or. Rev. Stat. § 125.025(1)) including appointment of investigators, 
visitors, and experts to aid the court in the court’s investigation. Or. Rev. Stat. § 125.025(3)(d) (2021).

auditor should not make decisions on behalf of the court but aid the court in their exercise of 
oversight by reviewing information and presenting opinions and findings. 

RECOMMENDATION 3: Advocates to Assist with Guardianship Monitoring 
Although many smaller courts report to struggle with accounting review, most have 

developed systematic methods of tracking and checking guardian reports. Statewide, 94% of all 
adult guardianship cases that have been open for at least two years have had a guardian’s report 
filed in the previous 18 months, with 14 counties at 98% or better. Further, all circuits that 
participated in the survey and interviews described a known process for reviewing the content of 
the guardian reports as they are filed. In all but the largest courts every guardian’s report is 
routed to a judge for substantive review, with all circuits confirming a process for escalating 
concerns to a judge for direction. In at least seven circuits the judge confirms substantive review 
either by initialing the report, signing the report, or entering a court-generated order that 
approves the annual guardian’s report. Formal approval of guardian reports is not required by 
statute but demonstrates judicial attention to and the importance of reporting requirements.  

Despite processes for collecting and reviewing reporting, several staff and judges 

expressed frustration with the limitations of the annual report. As one judge stated:  

“We really have to rely on court filings to evaluate the situation. Evaluation is only as 

good as the filings we get.” – Judge  

A related source of frustration was also what a court is to do when parties are 
unresponsive. Nearly all survey participants reported methods employed to solicit additional 
information from parties or issue late notices if reports were overdue, but there is a disconnect 
between the court’s concerns and the ability to address those concerns with the parties at hearing. 
A repeated question from both judges and staff was “What do we do with ‘cases in limbo’ where 
the parties don’t respond but we can’t figure out whether legitimate concerns warrant removal or 
termination?”.  

One option is the re-appointment of a court visitor, who may be appointed at any time 
after the appointment of a fiduciary and can be directed to perform any duty the visitor could 
have performed at the time of the initiating petition. Despite that option, many judges are reticent 
to appoint a visitor when guardians are unresponsive, especially in those cases where the court 
may be aware of the protected person’s limited resources to pay the visitor. A similar option at 
no cost to the protected person is to appoint a protected person special advocate.75 In Oregon, a 
special advocate serves a different function that the court visitor, focusing on advocacy for the

protected person rather than determination of capacity and the appropriateness of the nominated 
fiduciary.76 

ORS 125.120, added to statute in 2014, provides an option to appoint a volunteer 

advocate77 on behalf of the protected person whose task is to “investigate and evaluate the 
protected person’s circumstances to establish whether the fiduciary is fulfilling [their duties].78” 
The advocate informs the fiduciary of support services available in the community and provides 
a written report of their findings to the court and all interested persons.79 The caveat to this 
option is that the presiding judge must establish qualifications, standards, and procedures for the 
program by order80, and find volunteer advocates to appoint. 

Originally “Special Advocates for Vulnerable Oregonians”, a non-profit now known as 

Guardian Partners was founded with the express goal of providing courts with trained volunteers 
(guardian monitors) to fill that role of special advocate. As of the date of this report, Guardian 
Partners was serving eight counties in Oregon, covering an estimated 58% of the state’s 
population.81 At no costs to courts, a judge can direct the appointment of a guardian monitor who 
completes the investigation, talks to the parties, and reports back with findings. The form of 
report typically includes updated contact information for the parties, a narrative of the case 
status, and recommendations regarding possible court action necessary. As described by one 
judge, monitor appointment “Reminds them of their obligations as an appointed fiduciary.”  

Some courts appoint monitors only on concerning cases, but others have implemented a 

method of “random monitoring” as an extra level of precautionary oversight meant to address the 
possibility that some guardians may not file accurate reports. Whether the appointment is 
reactive or proactive though, it provides a judge with a method of gathering evidence about the 
protected person apart from the fiduciary’s reporting. With the self-reported delays on setting 
hearings, appointment of a monitor also serves as an indicator of urgency on evaluating the 
proceeding. If before a hearing the judge knows that the monitor has concerns, whether as to the 
continuing need for protection or inadequacies of the proceeding, hearing time can be used most 
effectively. All circuit courts are encouraged to implement a special advocate program, whether 
through Guardian Partners or independently.  

RECOMMENDATION 4: Court Visitor System Revision  

The statewide court visitor system as it currently exists – a patchwork of local orders with 

varying visitor policies, varying flat or hourly fees, and some courts with no policies or known 

 

76 Or. Rev. Stat. § 125.120(2) (2021) establishes different responsibilities of the special advocate than those 

listed of a court visitor, including providing information to the fiduciary regarding community support services to 
assist with the protected person’s care and ensure their welfare.

visitors to appoint – is unlikely to be a sustainable model for ensuring access to qualified and 
capable visitors who can reputably fulfil their obligations, especially in smaller or rural counties.  

 Based on the information gathered during this self-assessment, there are several 

straightforward recommendations regarding visitors.  

1.  Jurisdictions should ensure PJOs are current and accessible regarding visitor 
qualifications, process, and fees as required under ORS 125.165. The SPPAC 
prepared visitor training videos82 explaining customary expectations and process can 
be used as guidance for those jurisdictions without a current PJO.  

2.  Courts that maintain lists of qualified court visitors should be encouraged to select the 

visitor to be appointed on each case, rather than directing the petitioner or their 
attorney to nominate one. Establishing a visitor rotation or pre-selection process helps 
in several ways including: 

a.  Reducing perceived or actual bias or favoritism between visitors and parties; 

and 

b.  Discouraging attorneys from selecting the same visitor repeatedly. 
3.  Encourage courts to use a standardized statewide or local order of appointment and 

visitor’s report form. Establishing uniform authority and formatting provides 
familiarity and predictability when visitors are engaging with medical providers, 
community partners, and other outside stakeholders.  

All three recommendations, if adopted, would promote fairness, effectiveness, and 

integrity of the circuit’s visitor system. 

There remains an even more alarming issue with the current visitor system: Available, 

dependable, visitors. When discussing the visitor system generally during interviews, the primary 
concern regarding the process has been the recruitment and longevity of visitors in all sizes of 
counties.  

To illustrate the issue, consider the situation of a prolific visitor in the largest volume 
county. In 2021 that county had 188 adult guardianship petitions requiring appointment of a 
visitor, with three visitors on their list. None were court employees, meaning that 
multiplying one visitor’s one third share of cases by a $550 flat fee appointment would yield 
less than $35,000 in gross income. This doesn’t take into consideration any self-withholding 
or fee waiver cases that the visitor might take pro bono. Court visitor appointment in most 
counties would be a supplemental source of income at best.

Despite several counties’ attempts to increase visitor fees to attract skilled court visitors, 

raising fees makes guardianship more expensive. Since court visitor fees are reimbursed from 
protected persons’ assets, a large visitor fee can be a significant burden. Given these 
considerations, some circuits’ inability to maintain a list of visitors appears unavoidable. One 
strategy in these courts has been to solicit visitors from neighboring counties, but in 
geographically large but population sparse counties, the visitor can face substantial travel and 
unfamiliarity within communities. Courts, visitors, and guardianship stakeholders should 
convene, via WINGS or the SPPAC, to strategically address the structural limitations of the 
visitor system, and collaboratively develop improvements and changes.              

RECOMMENDATION 5: Systematic Appointment of Counsel 

On January 2, 2022, Senate Bill 578 (SB 578) took effect in two counties: Lane & 
Multnomah, with Columbia County starting January 2023, and statewide in 2024. The bill 
implemented statutory changes requiring court appointment of counsel for respondents and 
protected persons when (a) the respondent or protected person requests counsel be appointed; (b) 
an objection to a petition or motion is made or filed by any person; (c) the visitor recommends 
appointment of counsel; or (d) the court determines that the respondent or protected person is in 
need of counsel. Unless the respondent or protected person is already represented or has objected 
to appointment of counsel, the court shall appoint.83  

There is substantial work to do to prepare counties for this obligation. Despite 12 circuits 

reporting that they can usually find counsel to appoint, the frequency with which they currently 
appoint counsel is much lower than the number of appointments needed under SB 578’s 
requirements. To appoint counsel in the circumstances contemplated by the bill, most of these 12 
circuits would need two to five times as many attorney appointments as they have made over the 
last five years. Anecdotally, multiple judges and probate commissioners from counties that do 
appoint lawyers convey that finding willing counsel to appoint for respondents and protected 
persons is the single hardest part of their job. Provisions of SB 578, which direct Oregon Public 
Defense Services to pay a reduced-rate hourly attorney fee to counsel appointed to eligible 
respondents and protected persons, may encourage attorneys to take on appointments that might 
otherwise be pro bono, but substantial efforts need to be made to educate circuit courts about the 
new contours of attorney appointment. Stakeholders need to convene and form a plan for 
locating willing appointees and maintaining reliable appointment on potentially urgent case facts.  

RECOMMENDATION 6: Fiduciary Training 

There is no statutory requirement that courts require, provide, or facilitate any form of 

fiduciary orientation, education, or assistance. Nor is there a minimum test of experience or 
knowledge of fiduciary responsibility before an appointee assumes important and serious 
responsibilities for a protected person. Nevertheless, fiduciary training and education is a 
commonly recommended element of strong protective proceeding programs.84 As one clerk 

 

83 Or. Rev. Stat. § 125.080(6) (2021).  
84 National Probate Standard, Standard 3.3.14 recommends development and implementation of programs 

for orientation, education, and assistance of fiduciaries. See also U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, Ensuring 

47 

 

 

explained, “A newly appointed guardian will ask me what they’re supposed to do now that 
they’re the guardian. They don’t know what they signed up for, and they don’t know what to do 
next. I’m not allowed to give them legal advice.”  

 That clerk works in a court that neither requires any form of education nor offers an 

introductory letter to newly appointed guardians and conservators. But in five of the six largest 
volume courts non-professional fiduciaries85 are required to complete a training course and are 
issued an introductory letter with brief explanations of future expectations in their role. 14 
separate jurisdictions issue some form of introductory or orientation letter that includes relevant 
due dates for future court filings, with most including some brief explanations of fiduciary 
duties. At minimum, every court should issue some form of explanatory document laying out 
information for new fiduciaries. A state-standardized version should be prepared and made 
available to circuit courts, along with more comprehensive explanations of protective 
proceedings.   

While no comparative evidence has been gathered, judges and staff in counties that 

require educational courses believe an educational requirement has improved fiduciary 
compliance and behavior, therefore reducing the incidence of fraud and abuse, and lowering the 
number of show cause hearings related to mistaken understanding about performance.86 
Guardian Partners, the same non-profit that arranges for special advocate appointments, also has 
recorded classes available to fiduciaries in both English and Spanish, and upon confirmation that 
the class was attended, file into the case a certificate of completion. Minimum education 
standards would improve the knowledge base of non-professional fiduciaries, improving their 
understanding of the responsibilities and expectations involved in their appointment to better 
serve protected persons.  

RECOMMENDATION 7: Encourage Use of Remote Appearance Hearings and 
Cost-Free Record Access  

In June 2022, Chief Justice Martha Walters issued Chief Justice Order 2022-12 which 

addressed the statewide policy regarding remote appearances by summarizing the development 
of remote appearance hearings: 

“Since May 2020, our courts have gained significant experience and expertise in 
conducting remote proceedings. More importantly, we have learned that remote proceedings are 
a key element in providing access to justice. The flexibility provided by remote hearings has

2018), available at https://www.aging.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Guardianship%20Report.pdf.  

85 Defined in Or. Rev. Stat. § 125.240(5), a “professional fiduciary” means a person nominated as a 

fiduciary or serving as a fiduciary who is acting at the same time as a fiduciary for three or more protected persons 
who are not related to the fiduciary. Professional fiduciaries in Oregon carry additional licensure, reporting, 
background check, and fee request obligations. See Or. Rev. Stat. §§ 125.240(5), 125.095(2)(b). (2021). 

86 Several publications have noted lack of training as a particular problem “in cases where family or friends 

are assigned as guardians with little guidance on the boundaries of their authority or knowledge of appropriate 
actions.” B.K. Uekert & T. Dibble, Guardianship of the Elderly: Past Performance and Future Promises, Court 
Manager 23, no. 4, (2008) at 11.

enabled court proceeding participants and other members of our communities across the state to 
participate in and engage with our courts, notwithstanding work and childcare schedules that 
conflict with courthouse hours; limited access to public transit in some communities; 
disabilities that make travel to the courthouse difficult; safety concerns in certain cases; and 
health vulnerabilities that require limited contact with others. The flexibility that we have 
gained from conducting remote proceedings has increased court participation and furthered 
fairness and equity.” [Emphasis added]. 

Developed during a time when trepidation of in-person appearance was universal, probate 

courts should ensure all protective proceedings hearings include a remote appearance option, if 
possible.87 Courtrooms are now equipped with technology allowing for simultaneous in-person 
and remote appearance. Judges and staff, offering their perception of objection hearings during 
survey follow-up interviews, believed that respondents and protected persons were more likely to 
participate in conversations regarding their case, and had an easier time calling in to a hearing 
than coordinating transportation or managing public transportation. So too they believed 
attorneys preferred the ease of telephonic or video appearance, because scheduling remote 
hearings drew fewer rescheduling requests. Although generally positive about remote hearing 
options, several judges did note that some parties do not have access to the technology required 
to participate remotely, which is also a valid and important consideration.   

Besides the conditions noted by the Chief Justice, several additional considerations were 
highlighted by a probate commissioner: Protective proceedings frequently involve a hospitalized 
party who cannot attend in-person and some courtrooms are questionably accessible to those 
with mobility issues. If remote hearings are easier to schedule and preferred by all involved, 
there may be opportunity for additional courts to consider setting remote hearings before 
appointment of temporary fiduciaries. Resources, especially judicial time, is limited, but the 
addition of a brief appearance before appointment allows for conversation about the urgency and 
risk requiring action.  

Separate from remote hearings, but no less important for respondents’ and protected 
persons’ access to courts, an advisory committee member noted that many respondents and 
protected persons do not have access to their funds and may have difficulty confirming or 
obtaining copies of court filings in their case. In contentious, contested proceedings the fiduciary 
may not be trusted to deliver complete records and the respondent or protected person needs to 
obtain their own copies. A TCA suggested that courts develop policy for providing copies of 
court records to respondents and protected persons via phone or letter request, without charge. In 
most circumstances the copy and postage costs would likely be minimal, but if courts are 
concerned with runaway requests, reasonable limits could be developed. Nevertheless, access to 
hearings and access to records is a vital consideration for participation, fairness, and equity and 
policy regarding both should be developed and prioritized.  

87 National Probate Standard, Standard 3.3.8.C recommends all reasonable accommodations to enable 

attendance and participation at all stages of the proceeding.  

 

49 

 

RECOMMENDATION 8: Background Checks & Bonds 

Neither a background check nor requiring a bond will prevent all potential abuse or theft 
in protective proceedings, but both are effective tools for confirming the appropriateness of the 
appointed fiduciary and safeguarding the assets that the fiduciary is charged with managing. 

With respect to background checks, more survey participants than not reported that they 

do an Odyssey name search on the petitioner, the respondent, and the nominated fiduciary (if 
different than the petitioner). An Odyssey name search is not as comprehensive of a background 
check as might be recommended to confirm the integrity of the nominated fiduciary, but it is 
quick and provides a measure of confidence in the nomination.88 Several courts have notably 
enhanced their background check process, including two that require nominated fiduciaries to 
consent to more thorough checking, and one that completes a LEDS check on the nominee. 
These practices are notable and could be shared with other circuits as a more diligent effort to 
ensure the nominee is appropriate. 

Despite the statutory requirement that the petition disclose any of the nominee’s 
potentially disqualifying circumstances, there are legitimate purposes for confirming the content 
of the disclosure. By using Odyssey to check for a nominee’s past Oregon convictions, the court 
is quickly confirming the fiduciary’s honesty, an important factor when the appointee holds a 
position of trust. Disclosure of a conviction, bankruptcy, or license revocation should not be an 
automatic bar to appointment but is one factor a judge can weigh when deciding the 
appropriateness of the fiduciary’s appointment. Annual Odyssey checks performed at the time of 
the annual report or accounting can confirm a fiduciary’s continued appropriateness, especially 
given that the obligation to inform the court of convictions, bankruptcies, and license revocation 
is an ongoing duty.89 

Running an Odyssey name search for the respondent is also recommended to screen for 

potentially conflicting cases. A protected person should have only one protective proceeding 
case open to avoid the possibility of conflicting orders. A clerk taking the time to double-check 
that there are no other Oregon protective proceedings for this respondent can save unnecessary 
time, costs, and corrective action later.  

Bonds or some other form of asset protection is generally required by statute unless good 

cause has been shown.90 Despite most participants responding that their circuit required bond, 
very few case samples confirm that representation. The lack of bond or acknowledgments of 

 

88 While acknowledging the lack of empirical data showing background checks reduce instances of abuse 
and exploitation, the National Probate Standard 3.3.12 recommends a national criminal background check for non-
professional fiduciaries, but not those who have been licensed or certified. The commentary recommends court 
consideration of potentially disqualifying information, weighing the seriousness of the offense or misconduct, its 
relevance to the responsibilities of the fiduciary, how recently the offense or misconduct occurred, the nominee’s 
record since the offense, and the vulnerability of the respondent. National College of Probate Court Judges, National 
Probate Court Standards at 62, 63 (Richard Van Duizend, Reporter & Brenda K. Uekert, Research Director) (2013). 

89 Or. Rev. Stat. § 125.210(2) (2021).

restriction found in most counties (six counties do require bond or acknowledgment in nearly 
every case), suggests that good cause may be a formality in most circuits. The National Probate 
Court Standards emphasize that the bond should not be considered punitive or an unnecessary 
expense.91 Bonds serve as insurance against the protected person’s loss and it, or some equally 
protective alternative such as restricted accounts, also acts to benefit the court.92 Security for 
conservatorship assets serves to guard the court against public criticism should loss, 
misappropriation, or malfeasance by the fiduciary occur.93 Judges should be encouraged to 
require asset protection and educated on its purpose. 

RECOMMENDATION 9: Standardize Data Entry Processes and Develop 
Additional Data Measures 

The Data Dashboard created by SPPAC holds an impressive wealth of information about 
the protective proceedings filed in Oregon. Queries that retrieve details of cases and event entries 
were built to capture data entered under established business processes. These queries are 
correctly retrieving the information they were designed to collect, provided it was entered 
according to the business process. Where data entry does not match existing business processes, 
the dashboard may misrepresent a county’s data trends. Though the non-conforming data across 
different queries appears minimal, correcting mis-entered case events would provide cleaner data 
that would better reflect courts’ actual performance. OJD should make efforts to emphasize the 
importance of data entry business processes, clean up inaccurate data, and standardize as many 
data entry processes as possible. 

 

One concrete example of the latter problem can be found in one circuit’s “case 
disposition” timeliness data. Overall, that circuit is reporting 67% of their cases have either an 
appointment or a dismissal within 90 days of the filing of the petition. But when the “case age 
at disposition” column is viewed the times to disposition range from 158 days to 1,480 days. 
The appointment of a fiduciary in the latter case occurred well before the 90-day mark, but 
because the appointment was entered as an order rather than a judgment, the query could not 
find the true appointment date.  

Data measures are a useful way for tracking not only fiduciaries’ compliance with their 

obligations, but also the way courts monitor cases, understand the demographics of Oregon’s 
protective proceedings, and identify outlying counties and cases for corrective attention. Trial 
Court Administrators and Presiding Judges, with support from OSCA subject matter experts, can

Duizend, Reporter & Brenda K. Uekert, Research Director) (2013) at 67.

track ongoing compliance with outcome measurements and work to address processes that might 
be impacting a particular measure.   

Following are some recommendations for supplementing the Data Dashboard, using 
existing data entry business process, with a brief explanation of why they would be useful. These 
additions to the Data Dashboard would require query development and coding but would not 
change any local business processes: 

Average & Median Time to Appointment – Similar to the “Timely Disposition” 

measure, which tracks what percentage of cases have appointment or dismissal within 90 days, 
an average and median measure would more directly represent trends regarding appointment.  

Timeliness of Visitor Appointment & Timeliness of Visitor Report – ORS direct a 
specific timeliness for both the appointment of a court visitor and the timeliness of their court 
reports. The data entry codes for both visitor appointment and their court report are unique and 
standardized statewide, so implementing measurement of the timeliness between petition and 
visitor appointment, and then appointment and report, with median and average measures, will 
reflect counties and visitors’ adherence to statutory timelines.  

Objection Measurement – Understanding the number of objections filed, and the 

percentage of cases where objections have been filed would be a highly useful data 
measurement. Not only would there be a way to gauge the “contested-ness” of protective 
proceedings by county, case type and subtype, etc., but it would be a useful data point in future 
obligations for court-appointed counsel under SB 578.  

Appointment of Counsel in Protective Proceedings – Tracking the number of cases in 
which counsel has been appointed is an immediate need for future legislative reporting under SB 
578.94 

Asset Protection Tracking in Conservatorships – Adding a measure or percentage of 

cases where no bond or acknowledgment of restriction has been filed into the case could provide 
circuit courts a metric to identify when and how particular courts are ordering bond protection 
and identify opportunities to increase use when appropriate.  

In addition to the Dashboard recommendations, there are two further measures that would 

be useful to collect but would require prospective collection after data entry business process 
development:   

Tracking Temporary Appointments – A business process should be developed to 

capture an accurate count and percentage of temporary appointments. Through Odyssey review, 
some circuits appear to make temporary fiduciary appointments at rates substantially higher than 
many other counties. There is no intention in this assessment to second-guess decisions made in 
past cases, but prospectively gathering information about these unique matters would assist 
future analysis. Acknowledging that many petitions for temporary appointment also seek 

94 Or. Rev. Stat. § 125.035(3) (2021). 

 

52 

 

   

 

indefinite appointment, creation of a separate data entry code or case flag to identify those 
proceedings where a temporary appointment has been granted may be the best method of 
collection. This is a recommended data element for protective proceeding monitoring.95   

Case Termination Categorization – Perhaps the highest interest data demographic in 

the SPPAC’s initial data work, and to the members of the grant advisory committee, categorizing 
the reasons for case termination is a priority. This is also a recommended data element for 
protective proceeding monitoring.96     
 

Conclusions 
Throughout the surveying and interviewing process of this assessment, nearly all circuits’ 

judges and staff were eager to participate and engage in discussion of their local practices and 
were demonstrably invested in considering ways to improve monitoring. Judges were especially 
likely to credit the effectiveness of their monitoring of these cases to the diligence and dedication 
of their support staff, which was reflected in their explanations justifying their self-evaluation 
scores. Connecting the individuals performing this work through collaborative opportunities to 
share their strategies and approaches will reinforce the importance of their efforts. 

Based on the findings of this assessment, some general conclusions regarding monitoring 

can be drawn: 

1.  Circuits of smaller caseloads, especially rural circuits, cannot allocate resources to 
judges and staff to become specialized subject matter experts in these cases. They 
need centralized support and direction in the form of specialized training and direct 
referral services. 

2.  Standardizing court practices, especially with respect to accountings and substantive 
review of filings, will help raise expectations of the fiduciaries appointed in these 
cases, which will improve the quality and reliability of these proceedings for 
protected persons.  

3.  Support of longer-term projects to amend conflicting local rules and unify business 
process for prospective data gathering will allow for development of additional, 
evidence-based interventions that target known structural problems in protective 
proceedings.  

4.  Systems to recruit and retain court visitors and appointed counsel need to be 

considered immediately.

1. If all assets in a conservatorship are restricted does your court 
allow the fiduciary an alternative to a full accounting? Please check each

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
