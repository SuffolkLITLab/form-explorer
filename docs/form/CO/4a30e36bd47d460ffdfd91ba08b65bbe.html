      <pre>How to Guide to Small Claims 

These standard instructions are for informational purposes only 
and do not constitute legal advice about your case. 

GENERAL INFORMATION 

  The  Small  Claims  Court  handles  only certain  cases  per  §13-6-403,  C.R.S.  Some  examples  are  claims  to 

recover money or property, perform or set aside a contract, or comply with restrictive covenants. 

  If the claim amount exceeds $7,500.00, you may waive the balance over $7,500.00. 
  You are not allowed to divide the claims into two separate cases. 
  You cannot file more than two claims in any Small Claims Court in a County during a month nor more than 18 

claims in a County during a calendar year. 

  The Statute of Limitations varies depending upon the type of claim. 
  The legal rate of interest is 8% compounded annually. 
  All actions in the small claims court shall be brought in the county in which at the time of filing of the claim any 
of the  defendants  resides, or is regularly employed, or  has an  office for the  transaction of business,  or is  a 
student  at  an  institution  of  higher  education.  In  an  action  to  enforce  restrictive  covenants  or  arising  from  a 
security deposit dispute, the action may be brought in the county in which the subject real property is located. 
Mediation/settlement assistance may be required in some Small Claims Courts. 

  All cases are heard before a Magistrate or Judge. Jury Trials are not allowed. 
  If you are the Defendant do not disregard the Notice, Claim and Summons to Appear for Trial. A judgment 

could be entered against you, and the other party could start collection procedures. 

  If you are the Plaintiff  do not disregard a response or counterclaim. A judgment could be entered against 

you, and the other party could start collection procedures. 

  The Court cannot collect your judgment for you. 
  For  additional  information,  please  review  the  Colorado  Rules  of  Procedure  for  Small  Claims  (Rules  501  – 

521). 

  If you have a disability and need a reasonable accommodation to access the courts, please contact your local

STEPS TO FILING YOUR CASE 

Step 1:        Complete the Notice, Claim, and Summons to Appear for Trial (JDF 250). 
❑  Identify the names(s) and addresses of the Plaintiff(s) and Defendant(s) in the caption, see page 3. 
❑  In addition, if the Defendant(s) is/are a business or an  entity go online at  www.sos.state.co.us (select 
business  section)  to  determine  who  the  registered  agent  is  to  complete  service  on  the  Defendant(s). 
Note:  It  is  important  that  you  identify  how  the  Defendant’s  business  is  organized.  For  example,  if  the 
business is a sole proprietorship, corporation, etc. Rule 304 of the Colorado Rules of County Court Civil 
Procedure, identifies how service should be completed based on the type of business and this information 
will assist the individual who know the rules of service when they serve JDF 250. 

❑  If the Defendant is a governmental agency, you may be required to file a written notice with the Attorney 
General or other government representative, prior to filing your case with the Court, pursuant to §24-10- 
109, C.R.S. 

❑  Please answer all four questions with a Yes or No. 
❑  The Court will complete the box with the scheduled Court Trial date once you file your papers. 
❑  Under  the  Plaintiff(s) claim  section  please  write  a brief  description of  your claim.  Include  what  you  are 

claiming, the amount you are requesting, and a summary of reasons to support your claim. 

❑  If you are completing JDF 250 using the WORD or PDF version, make sure that you complete all 4- 

parts of the form. 

❑  Do not attach any exhibits or paperwork to this form.

NAME OF FORM 

Step 2:        File your Form with the Court. 

❑  Provide the Court  with the  Form.  If you are  completing the form using the WORD  or PDF version, 
bring  all  four  parts  (7  pages)  with  you  to  Court.  If  you  have  the  NCR  form,  bring  the  four-part 
form. 

❑  Pay the filing fee of $31.00 or $55.00 as appropriate 
❑  The Court will complete the section that identifies the date and time for the Court Trial.  The Court Trial 
date will vary with each Court.  The Court  may require  mediation prior to  the Court  Trial  date  or on the 
Court Trial date. 

Step 3: 

Serve the Notice, Claim, and Summons to Appear for Trial 

❑  It is important that service be completed at least 15 days before the trial date.  If not, the trial date will 

need to be rescheduled or your case may be dismissed. 

❑  A separate copy of the “Defendant’s copy” must be served on each Defendant.  If there is more than 
one Defendant, make a copy of the Front and back of the “Defendant’s copy” for each Defendant. 

❑  You have two options to complete service.

Personal Service: 
❑  Select  either  the  Sheriff’s  Department,  a  private  process  server,  or  someone  you  know  who  is  18 
years  or  older,  who  is  not  a  party  to  the  case,  and  who  knows  the  rules  of  service  to  serve  each 
Defendant.  There  is  a  service  fee  that  is  payable  to  the  Sheriff’s  Department  or  Private  Process 
Server.  The fee for service is usually awarded as part of your court costs if you win your case. 
❑  You can locate private process servers in the yellow pages under Process Servers. 
❑  Provide the process server with one copy for each Defendant of the Notice, Claim, and Summons 

to Appear for Trial “Defendant’s copy” and the “Affidavit of Service” portion. 

❑  The  process  server  will  return  the  completed  Affidavit  of  Service  portion  of  this  form  to  you  to 

bring and file with the Court before or on the day of your Court Trial. 

❑  Keep a copy of the Affidavit of Service for your records. 

Certified Mail by the Clerk of Court: 
❑  You  can  request  that  the  Court  send  the  notice  by  certified  mail.  Only  the  Court  can  do  this. 
Certified mail is not the preferred form of service and could result in a delay in your Court hearing. 
❑  You  will  be  required  to  pay  the  cost  of  certified  mail  at  the  time  you  file  your  case.  This  cost 

❑  If certified mail cannot be completed, you will still need to have a sheriff or process server 

varies from $5.00 to $15.00. 

serve the form. 

PREPARING FOR MEDIATION 

Mediation  can  be  an  effective  way  to  resolve  your  dispute.  In  mediation,  a  neutral  third  party  works  with  the 
parties in a confidential setting to help them negotiate a mutually acceptable agreement. You may be ordered by 
the Court to mediate, or you can choose mediation to resolve your case without going to trial. Mediation services 
are  available  from  the  Colorado  Office  of  Dispute  Resolution  (720-625-5940)  or  from  private  mediators  (see 
listings in the Yellow Pages). Some areas offer no-or low-cost community mediation services. 

You should bring any legal or financial documents and any other information relating to the dispute with you to the 
mediation. 

POSSIBLE OUTCOMES FROM MEDIATION 

❑  You  and  the  other  party  may  reach  a  stipulation/agreement.  Prepare  a  stipulation  form  (JDF  75)  to 

identify the agreement.  Both parties should sign the form and provide it to the Court. 

❑  The party may agree that the money is owed and payment is made. Prepare a stipulation form  (JDF 75) 
to  identify  the  agreement  and  payment  made.  Both  parties  should  sign  the  form  and  provide  it  to  the 
Court, so that the Court knows that the case can be dismissed.  The stipulation must be signed in the 
presence of a court clerk or notary public. 

❑  If you and the other party do not reach a stipulation/agreement, then you will have a Court Trial. 

PREPARING FOR THE COURT TRIAL 

It is important that you are on time or early for your Court Trial and that you have all of your information with you. 
Please turn off your cell phone and respect all parties in the courtroom.  You may be asked to speak to the other 
party before the Court Trial to determine if the claim can be settled to avoid going to trial.  Below are some steps 
to follow: 

❑  Before your court date, ask the Clerk if you can observe a small claims court trial.  This is not required, 

but may help you feel more comfortable in Court and prepare you for your court trial. 

❑  Determine the evidence that you may need.  It is best to organize and label all exhibits, if you have more 
than one.  Examples of exhibits are documents such as photographs, charts, and receipts.  Make copies

of the exhibits for the Defendant(s) and the Court.  If the Court has to make copies for you, copy fees will 
be assessed. 

❑  Determine  if  you  will  need  any  witnesses.  You  can  ask  the  witness  to  appear  voluntarily,  or  you  may 
need to request the Court to issue a subpoena to each witness.  Instructions for Issuing a Subpoena (JDF 
79)  can  be  found  on  the  judicial  website  under  the  General  Section.  The  Court  will  accept  written 
statements from the witnesses in most circumstances. 

❑  Before you appear in court, highlight the key issues you would like to present. When others are testifying, 

take notes on what they say. 

POSSIBLE OUTCOMES FROM YOUR COURT TRIAL 

❑  The Magistrate or Judge will usually determine the facts, who won, and the amount of the judgment. The 
Magistrate  or  Judge  also  may  make  an  award  of  costs  (filing  fee,  service  fee(s),  and  witness  fee(s),  if 
applicable) to the winning party. 

❑  The party who was awarded the judgment is responsible for collecting the money.  The Court cannot do 

this for you. 

❑  The Court may provide the person who owes the money with either a Motion & Order for Interrogatories – 
Short  Form  (JDF  252A)  or  a  Motion  &  Order  for  Interrogatories  –  Long  Form  (JDF  252B).  The 
interrogatories  are  designed  to  help  identify  where  the  party  works,  money  held  in  savings/checking 
accounts, and property that the debtor owns that can help with collecting the money. 

❑  Additional collection information entitled “Instructions for Collecting a Judgment and Completing a Writ of 

Garnishment” (JDF 82) is available on the website under Garnishments.
