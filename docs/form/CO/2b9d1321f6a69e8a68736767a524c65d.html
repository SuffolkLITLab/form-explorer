Investigation  (CBI)  and  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  (FBI)  at  the  time  the  Petition  is  filed.  Please  follow  these 
steps: 

❑  Law  enforcement  agencies  are  no  longer  required  to  provide  fingerprinting  for  civil  cases.  Some  law

❑  If the minor child has an adjudication that would constitute a felony in Colorado or any other state, and you 
know that it is inaccurate, it is your responsibility to obtain the disposition information from the Court where 
such action occurred as identified in the CBI and FBI reports.  

❑  The  Parent/Petitioner  is  also  responsible  for  providing  certified  copies  of  any  criminal  dispositions  of  the 
minor  child  that  are  not  reflected  in  the  Colorado  Bureau  of  Investigations  or  Federal  Bureau  of 
Investigation records and any other dispositions which are unknown, by contacting the agency where such 
actions occurred.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
