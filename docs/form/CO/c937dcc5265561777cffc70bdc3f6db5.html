      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR A NON-EXPEDITED RELINQUISHMENT 

These standard instructions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal 
advice about your case.  If you choose to represent yourself, you are bound by the same rules 
and procedures as an attorney. 

ENERAL INFORMATION  

  
  The Petitioner must be 18 years of age or older. 

  Your  case  should  be  filed  in  the  county  where  you  reside  or  where  the  child  resides.    If  a  child  placement 

agency is involved, the case may be filed in the county where the child placement agency is located. 

  A final order by the court removes the relinquishing parent or parents of all legal rights and obligations they may 
have with respect to the child relinquished. It does not modify the child’s status as an heir at law, which stops 
only upon a final decree of adoption.  

  For additional information, please review §§19-5-100.2. – 19-5-203 of the Colorado Revised Statutes. 

  If you have a disability and need a reasonable accommodation to access the courts, please contact your local 

ADA Coordinator. Contact information can be obtained from the following website: 

http://www.courts.state.co.us/Administration/HR/ADA/Coordinator_List.cfm

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
