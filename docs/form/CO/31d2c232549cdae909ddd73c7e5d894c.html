These standard instructions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal 
advice about your case. 

If you choose to represent yourself, you are bound by the same rules and procedures as an 
attorney. 

General Information 
  Pursuant  to  §19-1-306,  C.R.S.,  you  may  ask  the  court  to  “expunge”  your  juvenile  record.  
“Expungement” means your records will be considered to have never existed, and the public will not be 
able to see the records. You may lawfully deny that you have ever been arrested, charged, adjudicated, 
convicted, or sentenced in regard to the expunged matter.  A respondent parent or guardian (parent or 
guardian named in a case), or a court-appointed guardian ad litem may also ask the court to expunge 
the records.  

  A Petition to Expunge Juvenile Records must be filed in the court that has jurisdiction of the case. If 
the Juvenile’s case was transferred from one county to another, the petition would be filed in the 
county that currently has the case. 
 

  If the Juvenile’s case was transferred from one county to another, the expungement paperwork must 
be filed with the court in each county where a case exists to ensure that all of the records are expunged. 

  You are not eligible to petition for an expungement order if:  

1.  You were adjudicated for a felony offense involving unlawful sexual behavior as defined in §16-22-

2.  You were adjudicated an aggravated juvenile offender pursuant to §19-2.5-1125(4) C.R.S. (or §19-

102(9), C.R.S.; or 

2-516(4), C.R.S. prior to 10/1/2021);  or 

516(3), C.R.S. prior to 10/1/2021); or 

3.  You were adjudicated a violent juvenile offender pursuant to §19-2.5-1125(3) C.R.S. (or §19-2-

4.  You were adjudicated of homicide and related offense pursuant to part 1 of article 3 of title 18; or  
5.  You were charged, adjudicated, or convicted of any offense or infraction pursuant to title 42.  

 

  You are eligible to petition for an expungement order: 

1. 

Immediately under one of the following circumstances: 

A)  You may petition the court to expunge a closed case that has not already been expunged 

within 42 days after: 

i. 
ii. 

iii. 

You are found not guilty at an adjudicatory trial; or 
The petition was dismissed in its entirety prior to any disposition or alterative to 
sentencing including diversion, a deferred adjudication, or an informal adjustment; 
or 
You  successfully  complete  a  sentence  or  alterative  to  sentencing  including 
diversion, a deferred adjudication, or an informal adjustment for a petty offense, 
drug petty offense, class 2 or 3 misdemeanors, level 1 or 2 drug misdemeanor if 
the offense does not involve unlawful sexual behavior as defined in §16-22-102(9),

10/1/2021) or a repeat offender under § 19-2.5-1125(2) (or §19-2-516(2) prior to 10/1/2021) and a 
proceeding concerning a felony, misdemeanor or delinquency action is not pending against you. 

  A Petition may be filed only once during a twelve-month period, unless otherwise stated in § 19-1-

306, C.R.S. 
 

  After your juvenile records are expunged, they are not open to the public, however: 

1.  Basic identification information and a list of any state and local agencies and officials having 
contact with you will be available to a district attorney, local law enforcement agency, the 
department of human services, the state judicial department and the victim. However, they will 
not be available to an agency of the military forces of the United States.

future juvenile or adult sentencing hearing pertaining to you. 

 

  For repeat or mandatory juvenile offenders, any expunged record will be available for use by a court, 
a district attorney, any law enforcement agency, or any agency of the state judicial department in a 
subsequent criminal investigation, prosecution or adjudication. They may also be available during 
probation or parole supervision.

any court that previously had jurisdiction of the case on the order) 
  The Judge or Magistrate will sign the Order at the time of the hearing 

if your Petition is approved. 

Step 2: 

You are ready to file the case with the Court. 

Provide the Court with the documents completed as described in Steps 1 above. 
If you are requesting to expunge multiple cases, you must file a separate Petition 
for each case. 

  If  your  petition  meets  the  eligibility  requirements  of  Section  A  (under  the 
“General Information” section) the court may enter an order to expunge the 
records and provide copies to you, parties in the case, and other agencies who 
have records of the case.  

  If  your  petition  meets  the  eligibility  requirements  of  Section  B  (under  the 
“General Information” section) the court will provide notice to the prosecuting 
attorney. If neither the prosecuting attorney nor victim files an objection within 
35  days  after  the  court  issues  the  notice,  the  court  will  order  the  records 
expunged. If an objection is filed, the court must set a hearing on whether the 
records will be expunged 

In  cases  where  the  Court  has  received  a  Petition  for  Expungement  of  Juvenile 
Records, the Court may order your case expunged and any records of any other 
agency or official, if at the time of the hearing on the Petition, the Court finds that: 

  There  are  no  criminal  or  delinquency  actions  pending  or  being  instituted 

  The Juvenile has rehabilitated to the satisfaction of the Court; and 
  The  expungement  is  in  your  best  interest  and  the  best  interest  of  the 

against you; and 

community. 

 

Step 3: 

Be prepared for the hearing if necessary.   

Steps To Filing Your Case: 

Step 1: 

Complete all applicable forms listed below.

During the hearing, you may be asked questions about the request to have your 
record  expunged.  You  may  present  evidence  to  the  court  in  writing  prior  to  the 
hearing and in person at the hearing. On the hearing date the Court will either grant 
or deny the Petition for Expungement of Records. If the Court grants the Petition, 
the Court will automatically “expunge/seal” the juvenile case. 

Step 4: 

 Once an order for expungement is entered 

The court will send a copy of the order to parties in the case and other agencies 
who have records of the case.
