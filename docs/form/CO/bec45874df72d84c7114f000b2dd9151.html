Issues on Appeal11 

1. The District Court did not err in finding that Goldilocks trespassed. 

2. The District Court did not err in finding outrageous behavior.  

3. The damages awarded were not excessive.12  

4. 

Statement of the Case13 

We include the following additional facts to the Statement of the Case 

found in the Opening Brief: 

Mama Brown-Bear testified that their home was located several miles 

outside of town on a dirt road and that she never met Goldilocks before this 

case. R. Tr. (June 16, 2015), p. 6, line 25.14 Goldilocks testified that she saw no 

signs advertising the home as a bed and breakfast. R. Tr. (June 15, 2015), p. 39, 

line 10.  

                                        
11 This section contains the legal questions the Court of Appeals will answer in deciding the appeal.  

12 You may not include additional Issues on Appeal.  

13 This section contains the facts and procedural history of the case. You only need to include information in 

this section if you are dissatisfied with the Statement of the Case found in the Opening Brief.  

14 Notice that after every sentence that states a fact, there is a reference (citation), to the Record on Appeal 

(R.). The Court of Appeals may only consider facts that are in the Record. Citing to the Record for each fact 

will make sure the Court of Appeals can find and consider that fact when deciding the appeal.

Papa Brown-Bear testified that he was sure they had made the beds 

before leaving on their hike. R. Tr. (June 15, 2015), p. 21, line 7.15 However, 

Officer J. Hopps testified that both Mama’s and Papa Brown-Bear’s beds were 

“unmade and it looked like someone had been sleeping in them”. R. Tr. (June 

15, 2015), p. 20 – 21; R. Ex. Z, p. 2.16  

The Brown-Bears also gave Officer Hopps a list of the home’s missing 

items, including half of the Brown-Bears’ blueberries. R. Ex. Z, p. 3.17 Papa 

Brown-Bear testified that he was outraged to find that half of their blueberries 

had been stolen. R. Tr. (June 15, 2015), p. 22 - 23. Judge Fhair wrote in her 

final orders that she found Papa Brown-Bear’s testimony on making the beds 

and the missing blueberries to be credible. R. CF, p. 353.18  

                                        
15 In your copy of the Record on Appeal (the CD sent to you in the mail) there are likely several different 

PDF documents. One of those documents may be a transcript (Tr.). This citation is saying that the June 15th 

transcript, on Page 7, line 15, is where the Court of Appeals can find the testimony about this fact. 

16 Another part of the Record on Appeal may contain the exhibits from the trial or hearing. This citation is 

saying that Exhibit Z, page 2 is where you will find this information. 

8 The case file (CF) is also a part of the Record on Appeal. The case file contains the documents that were 

filed in your case in the District Court by the parties or their attorneys. 

19 The Argument Summary is a short overview of the arguments you are about to make. It mentions only the 

key point(s) for each issue and is usually not longer than one page.

6.  Argument Summary19 

The District Court did not make the three mistakes alleged in the 

Opening Brief. First, the District Court correctly found that Goldilocks was 

trespassing. And because Goldilocks did not preserve this issue, it may not be 

reviewed on appeal. Even if the issue was preserved, Goldilocks did not have 

implied consent to enter the home because a prior relationship between her 

and the Brown-Bears never existed. Therefore, she was trespassing on their 

private property. 

Additionally, the District Court did not err in finding that Goldilocks’s 

actions were outrageous, which is the first element needed to show she was 

liable for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress. The facts in the record 

reasonably lead to the conclusion of outrageous conduct. Because Goldilocks’s 

behavior was outrageous, she is liable for emotional distress. 

Finally, the District Court did not award excessive damages because 

Goldilocks is liable for Trespass and Intentional Infliction of Emotional 

Distress.

not presented at trial, are not preserved for review on appeal. Blood v. 

Qwest Servs. Corp., 224 P.3d 301, 328 (Colo. App. 2009).  

The argument of implied consent was raised in Goldilocks’s 

Answer to the Complaint. R. CF, p. 7. Because Goldilocks only raised

the Court of Appeals should not review this issue.  

C 

Discussion: 

The District Court did not make a mistake in finding that 

Goldilocks had trespassed on the Brown-Bears’ property because 

implied consent was never given by the Brown-Bears.24  

A person is liable to another for trespass if they intentionally enter 

land in the possession of the other without proper permission.25 § 13-21-

115(5)(c), C.R.S. 2015; Hoery v. United States, 64 P.3d 214, 217 (Colo. 

2003); Betterview Investments, LLC v. Public Service Co., 198 P.3d 1258, 1262 

(Colo. App. 2008).26 However, representation that the public is 

requested, expected, or intended to enter or remain on a property may 

be given by express or implied consent. Corder v. Folds, 292 P.3d 1177, 

                                        
24 The Discussion section starts off with an introductory sentence that states the issue found in the Opening 

25 This paragraph informs the Court of Appeals of what the law is on this issue. In this case, it is the law 

regarding trespass and implied consent.  

26 Note that after every statement of the law, there is a citation to a case, statute, or other law that supports

the statement.

R: July 7, 2021 

Page 9 

1181 (Colo. App. 2012). A landowner may consent to entry, absent 

express words, by his or her course of conduct. Id.27  

However, the Corder case is different from this case. In Corder, the 

landowner and accused trespassers were neighbors. Id. at 1178.28 The 

neighbor was returning a propane tank that he had borrowed from the 

landowner. Id. The landowner and the neighbor had been in each other’s 

houses many times, and the neighbor even had a key to the landowner’s 

home. Id. at 1179.29  

In this case, Goldilocks and the Brown-Bears never met before 

the lawsuit. R. Tr. (June 16, 2015), P. 6, Line 25. There was no 

longstanding relationship between Goldilocks and the Brown-Bears like 

there was in Corder. Because the facts in this case, where the parties were 

strangers, are very different from the Corder case, where the parties were 

                                        
27 “Id.” is short for idem, which is Latin for “same.” You may use Id. if the citation for that sentence is exactly 

the same as the previous citation in your brief. 

28 If the source is the same as the previous citation, but you are referring to a different page, use “Id at (page

arguments that: 

 

1.  Your case is different and should have a different result. 
2.  Your case is the same and should have the same result. 
3.  The other case is much worse/better/more complicated than your case. Therefore, reaching the 

same result is much easier in your case.

close neighbors, implied consent cannot be found in this case. The 

District Court was right to find a trespass had occurred.30  

In addition, Goldilocks claims that implied consent was given 

because the Brown-Bears’ home could have been confused with a Bed & 

Breakfast. However, the facts do not support this argument. The home 

was located far from the commercial center of town, off a dirt road. Id. 

No signs advertised the property as a business. R. Tr. (June 15, 2015), P. 

39, Line 10. Goldilocks points to a welcome mat, the size of the 

property, and the amount of food in the home. However, these are all 

common items also with private houses. They alone do not equal 

implied consent.  

Because there are facts that support the District Court’s finding of 

trespass, the Court of Appeals should affirm that finding.31  

Issue 2 – Findings to Support Emotional Distress 

A. 

Response to Standard of Review: 

                                        
30 This paragraph applies the facts of this case with the law mentioned in the previous paragraph. 

31 The writer is arguing here that the standard of review hasn’t been met. That is, the condition needed to 

have the Court of Appeals correct the case hasn’t been met.

Standard for review for this issue. 

I agree with the Opening Brief that this issue was preserved for

Preservation: 

appeal. 

C.  Discussion: 

The District Court was right in finding that Goldilocks’s actions 

were outrageous and support a claim of Intentional Infliction of 

Emotional Distress.32 

Someone is liable when his or her extreme and outrageous 

conduct intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress in 

another. Culpepper v. Pearl St. Bldg., Inc., 877 P.2d 877, 882 (Colo. 1994). 

The elements to establish intentional infliction of emotional distress are: 

(1), the defendant engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct; (2), the 

defendant engaged in the conduct recklessly or with the intent of causing 

the plaintiff severe emotional distress; and (3), the plaintiff incurred 

                                        
32 Again, this introductory paragraph explains what will be discussed in the following paragraphs. 

JDF 1988  –  Sample Answer Brief 

R: July 7, 2021 

Page 12 

severe emotional distress. Rugg v. McCarty, 476 P.2d 753, 756 (Colo. 

1970).33 

To establish the first element, the conduct must be extreme or 

outrageous. For conduct to rise to the level of extreme or outrageous, it 

must be “so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go 

beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, 

and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.” Destefano v. Grabrian, 

763 P.2d 275, 286 (Colo. 1988).34 

There are enough facts in this case to show that Goldilocks’s 

behavior reaches that level of extreme or outrageous conduct. First, 

Goldilocks trespassed into the Brown-Bears’ home. It is clear from the 

facts that she slept in or jumped on the Brown-Bears’ beds. R. Ex. Z, P. 

2 and R. Tr. (June 15, 2015), P. 21, Line 7. In addition, she ate half of 

their blueberries. R. Ex. Z, P. 3.35 When a person comes into a stranger’s 

home unwelcomed and then takes advantage of a the owner’s private 

space like their bed, this is clearly conduct that is outrageous in 

                                        
33 The next paragraph provides the law regarding this issue. 

34 Some claims require that different criteria or elements be proved for a person to be liable. The writer may 

focus on any one or all of the elements and will explain the law involving each element discussed. 

35 The next paragraph states the facts that are important for the “outrageous conduct” element. 

JDF 1988  –  Sample Answer Brief 

R: July 7, 2021 

Page 13 

character. The act of eating a family’s food supply, so that they may not 

survive the winter, is beyond the bounds of decency and is atrocious. 

The District Court found so, and there are facts in the record to support 

that finding.36 The other two elements of Intentional Infliction of 

Emotional Distress were not covered in the Opening Brief, so we will 

not cover them here. 

Because there were facts in the record that would support a 

finding of outrageous conduct, the District Court was not clearly wrong 

in making that finding. Therefore, the Court of Appeals should affirm 

the District Court’s decision.37  

Issue 3 – Excessive Damages 

A. 

Standard of Review: 

We agree with the Opening Brief. Abuse of Discretion should be 

the Standard the Court of Appeals uses to review this issue. 

B. 

Preservation: 

                                        
36 This sentence applies the facts to the law on this issue. 

37 This paragraph again ends with the writer arguing that the standard of review has not been met. In this case 
the argument is that the District Court’s finding was supported by the facts. The writer concludes by stating 
what the Court of Appeals should do to resolve the appeal. 

JDF 1988  –  Sample Answer Brief 

R: July 7, 2021 

Page 14 

We agree that this issue has been preserved for appeal. 

C.  Discussion: 

The District Court was right in finding that Goldilocks’s actions 

were outrageous and support a claim of Intentional Infliction of 

Emotional Distress.  

The $40,000 in damages awarded to the Brown-Bears is not 

excessive. As argued above, the District Court was not clearly wrong in 

finding that Goldilocks trespassed and intentionally inflicted emotional 

distress on Baby Bear. The amount of damages was supported by the 

testimony of Baby Brown-Bear’s parents and her therapist and the bills 

for the therapist’s services. R. Tr. (June 15, 2015), pp. 6, 15, and 27; R. 

Ex. S. Because Goldilocks is liable, and there was evidence to support 

the amount of the Brown-Bears’ damages, the District Court did not 

abuse its discretion in awarding damages. The Court of Appeals should 

affirm the damages award. 

8.  Conclusion38 

                                        
38 This should be a short statement of want you want the Court of Appeals to do.

For the reasons stated above, the Court of Appeals should affirm the 

District Court’s findings that Goldilocks trespassed on the Brown-Bears’ 

property and that she intentionally inflicted emotional distress on Baby Bear.  

This Court should also affirm the amount of damages awarded.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
