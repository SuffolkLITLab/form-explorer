      <pre>Colorado Child Support Guidelines 

(For cases on or after July 1, 2021 only) 
Revised October 2021 

1. Preface 

The Child Support Guidelines for Colorado were developed by the Colorado Child Support Commission and 
enacted by the Colorado General Assembly. As specified in the statute, the Guidelines have three objectives: 

1)  To establish as state policy an adequate standard of support for children, subject to the ability of 

2)  To make awards more equitable by ensuring more consistent treatment of persons in similar 

parents to pay; 

circumstances; and 

3)  To improve the efficiency of the court process by promoting settlements and giving courts and the 

parties guidance in setting the levels of awards. 

The Guidelines can be found in §14-10-115, Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S.), and are consistent with other 
provisions of that section which place a duty for child support upon either or both parents based on their 
respective financial resources, the financial resources of the child, the needs of the custodial parent, the 
physical and emotional condition of the child, and the standard of living the child would have enjoyed had the 
marriage or civil union not been dissolved. 

The Colorado Child Support Guideline is based on an Income Shares Model. This model provides an objective 
basis for determining the average costs of children in households across a wide range of incomes. Because 
household spending on behalf of children is intertwined with spending on behalf of adults for most expenditure 
categories, it is difficult to determine the proportion allocated to children in individual cases, even with 
exhaustive financial affidavits. However, a number of authoritative economic studies provide estimates of the 
average amount of household expenditures on children in intact households. These studies have found that the 
proportion of household spending devoted to children is systematically related to the level of household income 
and to the number and ages of children. 

Based on this economic evidence, the Colorado Child Support Guidelines calculate child support based on each 
parent’s share of the amount estimated to have been spent on the child if the parents and child were living in an 
intact household.1 If one parent has physical care for 273 or more overnights per year, the amount calculated for 
that parent is presumed to be spent directly on the child. For the other parent, the calculated amount establishes 
the level of child support. For cases with split or third party physical care, or extensive sharing of physical care, 
each parent’s calculated share of child support is adjusted by the time spent with the child(ren). 

2. Use of The Guideline 
 

The Colorado Child Support Guidelines apply as a rebuttable presumption to all child support orders in 
Colorado, except as discussed below. The Guidelines must be used for temporary and permanent orders, and 
for separations, dissolutions, and support decrees arising despite non-marriage or non-civil union of the parties. 
The Guidelines must be used by the Court as the basis for reviewing the adequacy of child support levels in 
non-contested cases as well as contested hearings. The Court may exercise broad discretion in deviating from 
the Guidelines in cases where application would be inequitable to one of the parties or to the child. In cases 
where the award deviates from the Guidelines, however, the Court must provide written or oral findings of fact to 
substantiate the deviation.

The Child Support Guidelines include a schedule of basic child support obligations that establishes the 
recommended amount of child support based on the number of children and parties’ incomes. However, there 
are two low-income adjustments. 

When the obligor’s (the parent ordered to pay child support) monthly adjusted gross income is equal to or less 
than $650, the Guidelines provide for a minimum order of $10 per month, regardless of the number of children 
between the parties and regardless of how many overnights each parent cares for the children. 

When the obligor’s monthly adjusted gross income is equal to or less than $1,500.00 but more than $650, the 
Guidelines require the obligor pay $50.00 per month for one child, $70.00 per month for two children, $90.00 per 
month for three children, $110.00 per month for four children $130.00 per month for five children, and $150.00 
per month for six or more children. The monthly child support obligation will be reduced if the custodial parent 
receives periodic disability benefits granted by the federal “Old-age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Act” 
(also known as Social Security Disability Insurance or “SSDI”) on behalf of dependent children due to the 
disability of the noncustodial parent. The monthly child support obligation will also be reduced if the custodial 
parent receives employer-paid retirement benefits from the federal government on behalf of dependent children 
due to the retirement of the noncustodial parent. The reduction will be equal to the amount of the benefits. The 
monthly child support obligation can also be adjusted to include a share of the work-related and education-
related child care costs, health insurance, extraordinary medical expenses, and other extraordinary adjustments 
as described in the statute in subsections (9) to (11), if, after these adjustments are made, the obligor's child 
support amount (basic obligation plus share of adjustments) does not exceed twenty percent of the obligor's 
adjusted gross income. If the obligor’s calculated support amount exceeds twenty percent of the obligor’s 
adjusted gross income, the child support obligation must be capped at twenty percent of the obligor’s adjusted 
gross income. The minimum guideline amount for obligors earning less than $1,500 per month shall not apply 
when each parent keeps the children more than ninety-two overnights each year. In no case, however, shall the 
amount of child support ordered to be paid exceed the amount of child support that would otherwise be ordered 
to be paid if the parents did not share physical custody. 

The Guidelines provide calculated amounts of child support up to a combined adjusted gross income level of 
$30,000.00 per month ($360,000.00 per year). For cases that exceed this level, the court may decide on a case- 
by-case basis, but may not order less than the amount on the schedule for $30,000.00. 

3. Determination of Child Support Amount 

To calculate child support for children who are under 19 or still in high school, or disabled, use: Worksheet A 
when one parent maintains physical care of the child for 273 or more overnights per year [see (4)(I) below]; use 
Worksheet B if each parent shares physical care of the child for more than 92 overnights per year [see (4)(J) 
below]. 

(A)  Income 

1)  Definition. For purposes of this Guideline, “income” is defined as actual gross income of the parent, if 
employed to full capacity or potential income if unemployed or underemployed. Gross income of each 
parent should be determined as specified below and entered on Line 1 of the appropriate worksheet. 

2)  Gross income. Gross income includes income from any source and includes, but is not limited to, income 
from salaries; wages, including tips declared by the individual for purposes of reporting to the federal 
internal revenue service or tips imputed to bring the employee’s gross earnings to the minimum wage for the 
number of hours worked, whichever is greater; commissions; payments received as an independent

contractor for labor or services, which payments must be considered income from self-employment; 
bonuses; dividends; severance pay; pensions and retirement benefits; royalties; rents; interest; trust income; 
annuities; capital gains; and moneys drawn by a self-employed individual for personal use that are deducted 
as a business expense, which moneys must be considered income from self-employment; social security 
benefits, including social security benefits actually received by a parent as a result of the disability of that 
parent or as the result of the death of the minor child’s stepparent; workers’ compensation benefits; 
unemployment insurance benefits; disability insurance benefits; funds held in or payable from any health, 
accident, disability, or casualty insurance to the extent that such insurance replaces wages or provides 
income in lieu of wages; monetary gifts; monetary prizes, excluding lottery winnings not required by the 
rules of the Colorado Lottery Commission to be paid only at the lottery office; income from general 
partnerships, limited partnerships, closely held corporations, or limited liability companies, however, if a 
parent is a passive investor, has a minority interest in the company, and does not have any managerial 
duties or input, then the income to be recognized may be limited to actual cash distributions received; 
alimony or maintenance (spousal/partner support) received; and overtime pay only if the overtime is 
required by the employer as a condition of the employment. 

For income from self-employment, rents, royalties, proprietorship of a business, or joint ownership of a 
partnership or closely held corporation, gross income is defined as gross receipts minus ordinary and 
necessary expenses required to produce such income. “Ordinary and necessary expenses” does not 
include amounts allowable by the Internal Revenue Service for the accelerated component of depreciation 
expenses or investment tax credits or any other business expenses determined by the court to be 
inappropriate for determining gross income for purposes of calculating child support. In general, income and 
expenses from self-employment or operation of a business should be carefully reviewed to determine an 
appropriate level of gross income available to the parent to satisfy a child support obligation. In most cases, 
this amount will differ from a determination of business income for tax purposes. Expense reimbursements 
or in-kind payments received by a parent in the course of employment, self employment, or operation of a 
business shall be counted as income if they are significant and reduce personal living expenses. 

Gross income does not include benefits received from means-tested public assistance programs, including 
but not limited to assistance provided under the Colorado Works Program, Supplemental Security Income 
(SSI), Food Stamps, and General Assistance. Gross income does not include child support payments 
received; social security benefits received by a minor child or on behalf of a minor child as a result of the 
death or disability of a stepparent of the child; income from additional jobs that result in the employment of 
the obligor more than forty hours per week or more than what would otherwise be considered to be full-time 
employment. Gross income does not include earnings or gains on a retirement account, including an IRA, 
which earnings or gains must not be included as income unless or until a parent takes a distribution from the 
account. If a distribution from a retirement account may be taken without being subject to an IRS penalty for 
early distribution and the parent decides not to take the distribution, the Court may consider the distribution 
that could have been taken in determining the parent’s gross income if the parent is not otherwise employed 
full-time and the retirement account was not received pursuant to the division of marital property. 

3)  Potential income.   If a parent is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed, child support shall be 

calculated based on a determination of potential income, except that a determination of potential income 
should not be made for a parent who is physically or mentally incapacitated or is caring for a child under the 
age of 24 months for whom the parents owe a joint legal responsibility, or for an incarcerated parent 
sentenced to one hundred eighty days or more. A parent is not deemed “underemployed” if their actual 
employment is temporary and is reasonably intended to result in higher income within the foreseeable 
future; or if their actual employment is a good faith career choice that is not intended to deprive a child of 
support and does not unreasonably reduce the support available to a child; or if the parent is enrolled full- 
time in an educational or vocational program or is employed part-time while enrolled in a part-time 
educational or vocational program, based on the institution's enrollment definitions, and the program is 
reasonably intended to result in a degree or certification within a reasonable period of time; completing the 
program will result in a higher income; the program is a good faith career choice that is not intended to 
deprive the child of support; and the parent's participation in the program does not unreasonably reduce the 
amount of child support available to a child. 

In determining potential income, the court or delegate child support enforcement unit shall consider, to the 
extent known, the specific circumstances of the parent, including consideration of the following information, 

JDF 1822  R10/21    Instructions for Completing Worksheets A and B 

Page 3 of 20 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when available: the parent's assets; residence; employment and earnings history; job skills; educational 
attainment; literacy; age; health; criminal record; other employment barriers; record of seeking work; the 
local job market; the availability of employers hiring in the community; prevailing earnings level in the local 
community; and other relevant background factors in the case. 

Determination of potential income shall be made by determining employment potential and probable 
earnings level based on recent work history, occupational qualifications, and prevailing job opportunities and 
earnings levels in the community. If there is no recent work history and no higher education or vocational 
training, it is suggested that income be set at least at the minimum wage level. 

4)  Income verification. Income statements of the parents should be verified with documentation of both 

current and past income. Suitable documentation of current earnings (at least three full months) includes 
pay stubs, employer statements, or receipts and expenses if self-employed. Documentation of current 
income must be supplemented with copies of the most recent tax return to provide verification of earnings 
over a longer period. 

(B)  Alimony, Maintenance (spousal/partner support), Pre-existing Child Support Obligations, 
Responsibility for Other Children, and Contributions to Post-secondary Education 

The amount of alimony or maintenance actually received should be multiplied by 1.25 (if it is not taxable to the 
receiving parent) (Line 1a), and added as a source of income for the receiving parent, and any amount actually 
paid should be multiplied by 1.25 (if it is not tax deductible to the paying parent)(Line 1b), and should be 
deducted from the gross income of the paying parent. If maintenance is taxable (common in orders entered prior 
January 1, 2019) then use the unadjusted amount of maintenance. 

The amount(s) of any pre-existing court order(s) for child support (Line 1c) should be deducted from gross 
income to the extent payment is actually made under such order(s). 

The amount of legal responsibility a parent has for children not involved in this action, but living in his/her home, 
should be deducted from gross income on Line 1d.. The amount entered on Line 1d should be 75% of the 
amount listed in the schedule of basic support obligations, which would represent 75% of a support obligation 
based only on the responsible parent’s gross income, without any other adjustments, for the number of children 
for whom the parent is also responsible, pursuant to §14-10-115(6)(b), C.R.S. 

If a parent has children not involved in this action and not living in that parent’s home, and there is no pre- 
existing court order for child support for those children, then the amount of money payments actually paid by the 
parent in support of those children should be deducted from the parent’s gross income on Line 1d. However, 
documented proof of money payments for support of those children is required and the amount listed on Line 1d 
cannot exceed the amount listed in the schedule of basic support obligations. 

The adjustment applies to a party’s natural or adopted children, but not to step-children, unless a prior court 
order has established a party’s legal responsibility for them. Use of the adjustment is appropriate at the time of 
the establishment of a child support order or in a proceeding to modify an existing order. However, it may not be 
used to the extent the adjustment contributes to the calculation of a support order lower than the previously 
existing order for the children who are the subject of the modification proceeding. 

If modifying an existing child support order, the amount of each parent’s court-ordered contribution for post- 
secondary education for a child should be subtracted from each parent’s gross income on Line 1e. 

(C)  Basic Child Support Obligation (Amount from Schedule) 

The basic child support obligation is determined using the Schedule of Basic Child Support Obligations. For 
combined monthly adjusted gross income amounts falling between amounts shown in the schedule, basic child 
support amounts should be interpolated. The number of children refers to children for whom the parents share 
joint legal responsibility and for whom support is being sought. 

(D)  Child Care Costs 

JDF 1822  R10/21    Instructions for Completing Worksheets A and B 

Page 4 of 20 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Child care costs incurred due to employment or job search of either parent (minus federal tax credit if allowed by 
the IRS) are entered on Line 6a of Worksheet A and Line 10a of Worksheet B. Child care costs incurred on 
behalf of the children due to the education of either parent are entered on Line 6b of Worksheet A and Line 10b 
of Worksheet B. Such costs should not exceed the level required to provide quality care from a licensed source 
for the children. 

The credit against income tax for child care due to employment or job search is provided under Sec. 44A of the 
Internal Revenue Code. The value of this tax credit, if allowed by the IRS, should be subtracted from actual 
costs for child care due to employment or job search (refer to IRS Form 2441).  The credit is only available to 
the parent that has the most overnights scheduled with the child(ren). In situations where the parent with fewer 
scheduled overnights pays work-related child care, put the actual amount spent in this category on the form. 

(E)  Health Insurance 

Amounts paid by parties or by a parties’ spouse/partner for health insurance premiums which cover the 
child(ren) subject to the order are apportioned between the parties. The amount included in the child support 
calculation is the amount of the health insurance premium actually attributable to the child(ren) subject to the 
order. If this amount is not available or cannot be verified, the total cost of the premium is divided by the total 
number of persons covered by the policy and then multiplied by the number of children covered by the policy 
who are subject to the order. This result is entered on Line 6c on Worksheet A or Line 10c on Worksheet B. A 
space to assist in this calculation is provided on page 3 of Worksheet A and page 2 of Worksheet B. 

Health insurance includes medical, or medical and dental insurance carried by either parent or by the parties’ 
spouse. The parent requesting an adjustment for health insurance premium costs must submit proof that the 
child(ren) is enrolled in an insurance plan and proof of the cost of the premium. 

(F)  Extraordinary Medical Expenses 

Any extraordinary medical expenses are entered on the worksheet (Line 6d on Worksheet A, Line 10d on 
Worksheet B) and added to the basic child support obligation. Extraordinary medical expenses, including 
copayments and deductible amounts, are uninsured expenses in excess of $250.00 per child per year. 
Extraordinary medical expenses include, but are not limited to, such costs as are reasonably necessary for 
orthodontia, dental treatment, asthma treatments, physical therapy, vision care and any uninsured chronic 
health problem. At the discretion of the Court, professional counseling or psychiatric therapy for diagnosed 
mental disorders may also be considered as an extraordinary medical expense. 

(G)  Extraordinary Expenses 

Other extraordinary expenses are entered on the worksheet (Line 6e on Worksheet A, Line 10e on Worksheet 
B) and added to the basic child support obligation. Other extraordinary expenses may include: 

1)  Any expenses for attending any special or private elementary or secondary schools to meet the 

particular educational needs of the child or public school mandatory school fees; and 

2)  Any expenses for transportation of the child, or the child and an accompanying parent if the child is less 

than 12 years old, between the homes of the parents. 

(H)  Extraordinary Factors actually diminishing the basic needs of the child. 

Any additional factors that actually diminish the basic needs of the child may be considered for deductions from 
the basic child support obligation. The amount of any such factor is entered on the worksheet (Line 6f on 
Worksheet A, Line 10f on Worksheet B) and subtracted from the basic child support obligation.

To determine child support using Worksheet A, enter all forms of monthly gross income listed in Line 1 and then 
calculate monthly adjusted gross income on Line 2. Next, calculate each parent’s percentage share of the total 
adjusted gross income on Line 3. Select the amount of child support from the Child Support Schedule (included 
below) based on the combined income on Line 2 and put the amount of child support in Line 4a. If the combined 
income on Line 2 is between the amounts listed on the Child Support Schedule, interpolate to determine the 
child support amount using the instructions in the next paragraph. Multiply the amount on Line 4a times each 
parent’s percentage share in Line 3 to determine each parent’s share of the basic obligation. If the monthly 
adjusted gross income of the parent with fewer overnights, or the parents’ combined monthly adjusted gross 
income, is less than $1500, use the Low-Income Adjustment Worksheet on page 2 to determine any low-income 
adjustment. 

To interpolate, subtract the child support amount from the schedule associated with the listed combined income 
below the parties’ actual combined income from the child support amount from the schedule associated with the 
listed combined income above the parties’ actual combined income. Now, divide that number by 50. Next, 
multiply the result by the dollar amount the parties’ actual combined income is above the listed combined 
income amount on the schedule and round to the nearest whole number. Add this number to the child support 
amount from the schedule associated with the listed combined income below the parties’ actual combined 
income. This amount is the interpolated amount of child support. For example, if the parties’ combined income is 
$3,125 and there is 1 child subtract $548 (the child support amount for $3,100) from $556 (the child support 
amount for $3,150) for a result of $8. Divide $8 by 50 for a result of 0.16. Now multiply 0.16 times 25 (the 
amount $3,125 is greater than $3,100) for a result of $4. Add $4 to $548 for an interpolated child support 
amount of $552. 

The total adjustments allowed for each parent are calculated by: i) adding the amount of expenses paid directly 
by each parent, as discussed in (D) through (G) above (Lines 6a through 6e); ii) subtracting any extraordinary 
adjustments discussed in (I) above (Line 6f); and iii) adding each parent’s column. Calculate each parent’s fair 
share of the adjustments by multiplying the amount in Line 7’s Combined column by Line 3 for each parent. 
Please note that if the paying parent qualifies for the $10 minimum order low-income adjustment, because their 
monthly adjusted gross income is less than $650, the adjustments listed in Line 6 do not apply and the 
recommended child support order is $10 for the paying parent, regardless of the number of children. 

Add each parent’s basic obligation (Line 4b, or Line 5 for the parent receiving any low-income adjustment) and 
each parent’s share of adjustments (Line 8) to determine each parent’s share of the total obligation. (If a parent 
qualifies for a low income order of $50/70/90/110/130/150 because their adjusted gross income is between $650 
and $1,500, and Line 8 is 20% or more of their adjusted gross income, no adjustments are applied and the 
recommended order is $50/70/90/110/130/150 and that amount should be listed on Line 11). On Line 10, bring 
down the amount from Line 7 of the parent with the least parenting time only. This is that parent’s share of the 
adjustments. On Line 11, subtract Line 10 from Line 9. This is the amount payable as a child support order.  If 
the result is a negative number, the recommended amount is $0. Although a monetary obligation is computed 
for each parent as child support, the receiving parent’s share is not entered on Line 11 because it is not payable 
to the other parent as child support. Instead, the receiving parent’s share is presumed to be spent directly on the 
child. 

(J)  Computation of Child Support—Shared Physical Care (use Worksheet B) 

Where each parent exercises extensive physical care, (that is, spends at least 93 overnights per year) the 
Guideline provides that a child support obligation be computed for each parent by multiplying that parent’s child 
support obligation by the percentage of time the child spends with the other parent. The respective child support 
obligations are then offset, with the parent owing more child support paying the difference between the two 
amounts. 

Child support for cases with shared physical care is calculated using Worksheet B. An adjustment for shared 
physical care is made only when each parent has the child for more than ninety-two overnights per year. The 
proportion of time with each parent is computed on Lines 7 and 8. On Line 7 is entered the number of overnights 
spent with each parent. These must total 365. 

When two or more children are included in the child support worksheet calculation and the parties have a 
different number of overnights with two or more of the children, the number of overnights used to determine

child support is determined by adding together the number of overnights for each child and then dividing that 
number by the number of children included in the child support worksheet calculation. This adjustment, 
previously referred to as Quam analysis, is now included in statute at §14-10-115(8)(g). If the child spends part 
of the time in the physical care of another person (e.g. a grandparent), that time should be credited to the parent 
responsible for the child during that time. If neither parent or both parents have responsibility, the time should be 
divided between the parents. On Line 8, the percentage of time with each parent is calculated by dividing the 
number of overnights with each parent by 365. 

On Line 4, the basic child support obligation from the child support schedule is entered. (Use the interpolation 
instructions in Paragraph I above, if necessary). This amount is then multiplied by 1.5 to calculate the shared 
care basic obligation. This amount is entered on Line 5. Each parent’s share of the shared care support 
obligation based on the parent’s percentage share of total income is calculated on Line 6 by multiplying the 
income share of each parent from Line 3 times the shared care support obligation from Line 5. The next step is 
to calculate the support obligation of each parent for the time the child(ren) spends with the other parent. This is 
done on Line 9 by multiplying the amount from Line 6 by the percentage found in Line 8 for the OTHER parent. 

Adjustments to the shared care support obligation are entered on Line 10. The expenses, directly paid by each 
parent or by a parent’s spouse/partner, for work-related net child care costs are entered on Line 10a, education- 
related child care on Line 10b, health insurance premiums on Line 10c, extraordinary medical expenses on Line 
10d, extraordinary expenses on Line 10e, and extraordinary adjustments on Line 10f. The amounts from Lines 
10a through 10e are added while the amount from Line 10f is subtracted, and the total is entered on Line 11. 
The amounts entered on Line 11 for each parent are multiplied by each parent’s income share from Line 3 and 
entered on Line 12 as each parent’s fair share of the directly paid expenses. Subtracting the amount on Line 12 
from Line 11 results in the amount each parent has paid in excess of their share of these expenses. This result 
is entered on Line 13, except that if the result is a negative number, zero is entered. By subtracting this excess 
amount from each parent’s support obligation on Line 9, each parent’s adjusted support obligation is entered on 
Line 14. Line 14 can be a negative number if a parent’s excess direct payments of extraordinary expenses is 
greater than that parent’s proportionate share of basic support. 

The child support order is listed on Line 15 by subtracting the lesser amount in Line 14 from the greater amount 
and entering the result in the column of the parent with the greater amount. The child support order amount 
cannot exceed the amount of child support that would otherwise be ordered to be paid if the parents did not 
share physical custody. Therefore, compare the Worksheet B to Worksheet A to determine which recommends 
the lowest amount. 

Note that this shared physical care adjustment is an annual adjustment only and should not be used when the 
proportion of overnights exceeds twenty-five percent for a shorter period, e.g., a month. For example, child 
support is not reduced during a month long summer visitation. 

If either of the parents is directly paying a disproportionate amount of the Basic Support Obligation (clothing, 
housing, food, ordinary medical expenses, for example) the Recommended Child Support Order amount may be 
deviated from in accordance with Section 14-10-115(8)(e), C.R.S. 

(K)  Computation of Child Support—Split Physical Care 

Split care refers to a situation in which there is more than one child and each parent has physical care of at least 
one of the children or they share care of some, but not all, children. In a split care situation, the support is 
calculated by using two Worksheets A, or a combination of Worksheets A and B, to determine the support each 
parent owes the other. The resulting obligations are then offset, with one parent owing the other the difference 
as a child support order. 

Begin by working a Worksheet A calculation for one parent. List the child(ren) for whom the other parent has 
sole physical care. Enter each parent’s income and the appropriate deductions to determine a combined 
adjusted gross income figure. On Line 4, enter the amount from the support schedule for the combined income 
level for the number of children living with the other parent only. Other expenses should be entered only to the 
extent that they are related to that child(ren). For example, consider a parent who covers all three children on 
his health insurance plan, the children’s portion of which is $150.00 per month.  If that parent has sole physical

care of one child, $100.00 is entered on Line 6c on the worksheet for his obligation, while $50.00 is entered on 
the same line when calculating the other parent’s obligation on a separate Worksheet A. 

Worksheet A is then completed for that parent. Next, calculate a Worksheet A amount for the other parent 
based on the number of children living with the first parent or do a Worksheet B for any children whose physical 
care is shared. Then subtract the lesser of the two total amounts from the greater, and use the difference 
between these two obligations as the child support order for the parent with the larger of the two obligations. 

(L)  Post-Secondary Educational Expenses 

For child support orders established on or after July 1, 1997, post-secondary education expenses can be 
ordered by the court only upon written agreement by the parents and approval by the Court. These approved 
expenses should be included on the Support Order on the line for monthly current support. 

4. Modification 

The provisions of a child support order may be modified only if there is a substantial and continuing change of 
circumstances. If application of the Guideline would result in a new order that is less than ten percent different, 
then the circumstances are considered not to be a substantial and continuing change. 

This form is a synopsis only of the Guideline. For additional information, please refer to the entire text of the 
Guideline found in §14-10-115, C.R.S., as amended, or consult legal counsel.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
