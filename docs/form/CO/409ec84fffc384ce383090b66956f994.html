      <pre>Instructions for Custodial Adoption 

   

 

These standard instructions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice about your case.  If you 
choose to represent yourself, you are bound by the same rules and procedures as an attorney. 

  The Petitioner must be 21 years of age or older, unless a minor receives consent of court.  
  Petitioner has had physical custody of the child (the child has lived with Petitioner) for over one year. Legal 

custody may have been established through a Domestic Relations, Probate or Juvenile case. 

  Any child legally available for adoption per §19-5-203, C.R.S., under 18 years of age residing in the state at the 
time the Petition for Adoption is filed or under the jurisdiction of a court in Colorado for at least 6 months may 
be adopted. Any person between the ages of 18 and 21 may be adopted as a child upon approval of the Court. 

  Your case is to be filed in the county in which you reside or where the placement agency is located. 
  The  prospective  adoptive  parent(s)  must  complete  both  state  and  federal  fingerprint-based  criminal  history 

record checks.  

  The prospective adoptive parent(s) must complete a TRAILS background check from the Department of Human 

Services.  The individual inquiry form and current fee information is available on their website.  

  The prospective adoptive parent(s) must provide a statement informing the Court if they have been convicted 

of a felony or misdemeanor in one of the following areas:  

  child abuse or neglect. 
  spousal abuse. 
  any crime against a child.  
  any  crime,  the  underlying  factual  basis  of  which  has  been  found  by  the  Court  to  include  an  act  of

  G

  A  person  convicted  of  a  felony  offense  that  involves  child  abuse,  a  crime  of  violence,  or  a  felony  offense 

involving unlawful sexual behavior shall not be allowed to adopt a child. 

  If the fingerprint-based criminal history record check reveals a felony or misdemeanor conviction, the Court will 
review the type of conviction and determine if it meets the requirements as outlined in 19-5-207(2.5)(a.5)(III) 
where the court may allow the party to adopt the child. 

  The child must not be the subject of a pending dependency and neglect proceeding. 
  Legally  available  for  adoption  means  one  of  the  following:  a  Court  has  terminated  the  parent-child  legal 
relationship; a Court has approved voluntary relinquishment of the parent-child legal relationship; if the parents 
are deceased; a court-appointed guardian has executed written and verified consent; or written and verified 
consent has been given by the parents. 

  If child is not legally eligible for adoption, the Petitioner must provide proof that they have consulted with the 
appropriate local County Department of Social services concerning the possible eligibility of the Petitioner(s) 
and  the  child  for  temporary  assistance  for  needy  families  (TANF),  Medicaid,  subsidized  adoption  and  other 
services or public assistance administered by the County Department of Social Services.  

  For additional information, please review §§19-5-200.2. – 19-5-403 of the Colorado Revised Statutes.

Fees 
A filing fee of $167.00 is required for each adoption.  However, if the Petitioner(s) is/are is seeking to adopt more 
than one child, and the circumstances/availability for the children to be adopted are the same (e.g. the children are 
available for the adoption due to the death of the primary caretaker, e.g. biological parent) then only an additional 
$ 3.00 Vital Stats Fee is required for each additional child the Petitioner(s) is/are seeking to adopt.  The Court will 
determine when  circumstances  exist  for  children  to qualify  under one  adoption  or  separate adoptions such  that 
more than one $167.00 filing fee is required. See Step 4 for completing appropriate forms for each child.   

f you are unable to pay, you must complete the Motion to File without Payment and Supporting Financial Affidavit

these steps:

identified in the CBI and FBI reports. 

  You  are  also  responsible  for  providing  certified  copies  of  any  criminal  dispositions  that  are  not 
reflected in the Colorado Bureau of Investigations or Federal Bureau of Investigation records and 
any other dispositions which are unknown, by contacting the agency where such actions occurred.

Information to complete this background check can be found at the Colorado Department Human Services (CDHS)
