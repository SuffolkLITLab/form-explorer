to an institution pursuant to a court order, you may file your Petition in the county where the court that issued 
the order is located.

Petition in the county where the Respondent is present. 

  A person interested in the welfare of the Respondent may file the case.

credit  report  of  the  proposed  guardian  (the  nominee)  must  be  filed  with  the  Court  along  with  JDF  805  –

requirements  for  physical  health,  safety,  or  self-care,  even  with  appropriate  and  reasonably  available

You  must  personally  serve  the  Respondent  at  least  14  days  prior  to  the  hearing.  Helpful  Hints  to  complete 
personal service: 

❑ Select the Sheriff’s Department, a private process server, or someone you know who is 18 years or order, 

who is not involved in the case, and who knows the rules of service. 

❑ Request the sheriff, private process server, or other person serving the documents to deliver personally to 

the Respondent the Notice of Hearing (JDF 807) and copies of all documents filed with the Court. 

❑ Request  that  the  sheriff,  private  process  server,  or  other  person  serving  the  documents  complete  the 
Personal  Service  Affidavit  on  the  second  page  of  the  Notice  of  Hearing  (JDF  807)  and  return  it  to  the 
Petitioner. 

❑ The Petitioner should then file with the Court, the Notice of Hearing to Respondent (Adult or Minor) (JDF 

807) with the completed Personal Service Affidavit. 

Step 5: Hearing. 

❑ The Petitioner and Respondent must appear at the hearing, unless excused by the Court for good cause. 
❑ If  the  Respondent  cannot  attend  the  hearing  for  medical  or  other  reasons,  the  Petitioner  must  file  a 
Motion to Excuse the Respondent and attach appropriate documentation to support the motion, such as a 
physician’s letter. 

❑ The Respondent may participate in the hearing to present evidence regarding his or her incapacitation. 
❑ The Petitioner should be prepared to present evidence as to why this Guardianship is necessary and that    

the interested persons are aware of the proceedings and that they consent to the Guardianship. 

❑ If  the  Court  appoints  a  Guardian,  the  Court  will  issue  Letters  (JDF  849)  as  a  formal  notice  of  the 

appointment and provide you with a copy of the Order Appointing Guardian. 
❑ You may need certified copies of the Letters and Order. The number needed will vary, depending on 

your circumstances. 

❑ Copies of the Order must be provided to all interested persons identified in the Order. 

tep 6: Requirements after the Court Appoints a Guardian. 

❑ Complete,  sign,  and  file  the  Acknowledgment  of  Responsibilities  (JDF  800)  with  the  court.  Letters  of 

Appointment will not be issued until this form is filed. 

❑ Complete,  sign,  and  file  the  Probate  Case  Information  Sheet  (JDF  705)  with  the  court,  if  you’ve  not 

already done so. Letters of Appointment will not be issued until this form is filed. 

❑ Refer to the Order Appointing Guardian for Adult to determine when the care plan and annual guardian 
report  is  due.  The  annual  report  is  generally  due  within  60  days  after  appointment  or  as  otherwise 
directed by the court. The purpose of the annual report is to report to the Court and interested persons the 
well-being  of  the  Ward.  The  Guardian’s  Report  must  be  provided  to  the  persons  listed  in  the  Order  of 
Appointment. 

❑ Refer  to  the  Order  Appointing  Guardian  for  Adult  regarding  completing  the  Notice  of  Appointment  of 
Guardian and/or Conservator (JDF 812). The purpose of this form is to notify the Ward and persons given 
notice of the Petition that they have the right to request termination or modification of the Guardianship. 

❑ The Ward may not move outside the State of Colorado without an Order from the Court. 

Note: A Guardian’s Manual is available to assist the newly appointed Guardian. This manual identifies 
general responsibilities and important Guardianship issues, along with completed sample forms to assist 
the preparer.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
