When you come to your hearing, you should be ready to explain why you believe your money or property is “exempt property”.  
If you do not appear at the scheduled time, your money or property may be taken by the Court to pay the judgment entered 
against you. 

Remember that this is only a partial list of “exempt property”; you may wish to consult with a lawyer who can advise you of your 
rights.  If you cannot afford one, there are listings of legal assistance and legal aid offices in the yellow pages of the telephone 
book. 

You must act quickly to protect your rights.  Remember, you only have 14 days after receiving this notice to file your claim of 
exemption with the Clerk of the Court.
