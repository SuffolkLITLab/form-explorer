OURT REVIEW 

The Court will review the documents.  If an objection is filed, the Court may require a hearing to determine whether 
the decree or any orders should be registered.   

nce a foreign decree is registered, the Colorado Court has the ability to enforce or modify the decrees, judgments, 
and orders.  When filing a motion to modify, amend or alter a decree or order, a $105.00 filing fee must be paid to 
the Court. 

Please Note: 
Properly registering a foreign decree is a required step before a request can be made before a Colorado Judge to 
enforce or modify the prior state’s orders, judgments, or decrees.   However, the Colorado Court must be satisfied 
that due process has been afforded to the other party before an order can be enforced or modified.  Please seek 
legal counsel to assist you in filing any motions to enforce or modify a registered foreign decree, judgment, or order.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
