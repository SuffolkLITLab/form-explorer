      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR OBTAINING JUDICIAL BYPASS OF PARENTAL 
NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING ABORTIONS FOR 
MINORS  

These standard instructions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice 
about your case. 

ENERAL INFORMATION 

f  you  are  under  the  age  of  18  and  you  want  to  have  an  abortion,  your  doctor  must  first  inform  your 
parent(s)  (which  would  include  any  court-appointed  guardian  or  foster  parent(s)  you  may  have), 
UNLESS: 
 

1.  You  are  at  least  15  years  old,  don’t  live  with  your  parents,  guardian  or  foster  parent  and  financially 

support and take care of yourself (in other words, you are “emancipated”); 

2.  You are married and you don’t live with your parent(s), guardian or foster parent; 
3.  You have been abused by a parent, guardian or foster parent and you tell your doctor or nurse about it.  
The  doctor  or  nurse  will  be  required  by  law  to  report  your  name  and  other  information  to  law 
enforcement once you tell them you have been abused; or  

4.  The doctor decides there is a medical emergency that has to do with your pregnancy and that you must 

have an abortion immediately. 

5.  A court has determined you are mature enough to make the decision to have an abortion without letting 
your parent(s), guardian or foster parent know, or alternatively, that it is in your best interest not to let 
IS  CALLED  “JUDICIAL  BYPASS  OF  THE  PARENTAL  NOTIFICATION 
them  know. 
REQUIREMENTS.”  THE  PROCEDURES  FOR  A  JUDICIAL  BYPASS  ARE  OUTLINED  IN  THESE 
INSTRUCTIONS.    IT  INVOLVES  ASKING  A  COURT  FOR  PERMISSION  TO  HAVE  AN  ABORTION 
WITHOUT TELLING YOUR PARENT(S), GUARDIAN OR FOSTER PARENT. 

  THIS 

If you do not want to tell your parent(s), guardian or foster parent of your decision to have an abortion, you 
may file a Petition in any district court of the State of Colorado or Denver Juvenile court by using the Petition 
form.  You are entitled to get a decision from the court on your petition within four calendar days of the day 
the petition is filed. 

(cid:139)  You may ask that the Court give you a lawyer for free.  The lawyer would represent you and help explain to 
the  Court  that  you  are  mature  enough  to  make  your  decision  on  your  own  without  telling  your  parent(s), 
guardian,  or  foster  parent  and/or  that  it  would  not  be  in  your  best  interest  to  tell.    If  the  judge  appoints  a 
lawyer for you, you should contact the lawyer immediately.    
It does not cost anything to file a Petition with the Court.  You also do not have to pay the lawyer or guardian 
ad litem, if one is appointed to you. 

(cid:139) 

(cid:139)  The process outlined in these instructions is private and confidential.  No one can find out from the court that 
you filed a petition and the people working at the courthouse are not allowed to tell your parent(s), guardian 
or foster parent. 

(cid:139) 

(cid:139)  The Court must hear and decide your request within four calendar days of the day the petition is filed at the 
courthouse.  If the Court does not make a decision within four days, you are entitled to an automatic order 
granting the petition and allowing you to have the abortion without telling your parent(s), guardian or foster 
parent.   
If the Court allows you to have the abortion without telling your parent(s), guardian or foster parent, and you 
have provided the Court with the name and address of your doctor in your petition, the Court will send your 
doctor a certified copy of the Order.  The Court Order is what allows the doctor to perform the abortion. 
If the Court decides you cannot have the abortion without telling your parent(s), guardian or foster parent, 
you may ask a higher level court, the Colorado Court of Appeals, to give you permission.  You, or someone 
on your behalf, would need to file a Notice of Appeal with the Colorado Court of Appeals and also give a 
copy to the district court.  You should receive a copy of the notice of appeal form from the district court if it 
denies your Petition.

(cid:139) 

If the Court of Appeals denies your appeal and does not allow you to have the abortion without telling your 
parent(s), guardian or foster parent, you may ask the Colorado Supreme Court which may or may not agree 
to  hear  a  further  appeal.    You  can  file  your  request  for  free  in  the  form  of  a  letter  to  the  Supreme  Court, 
attaching a copy of the Court of Appeals order.  To keep it private, you should file it in a sealed envelope 
marked “CONFIDENTIAL.”      

(cid:138)  For additional information, please review §12-37.5-105, C.R.S.

local ADA Coordinator. Contact information can be obtained from the following website:

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
