Court Summons: Eviction / Forcible Entry and Detainer 

To the above-named Defendant(s), take notice that your landlord is attempting to evict you. You 

need to take an action or an eviction order will enter against you. Your options are below: 

1. If you do not agree with the Complaint, then you must either: 

a. 

File your Answer with the Court on or before (enter day) ________________________ 

or 

b. 

Attend court on (enter date) __________________, at (enter time) _______________, 

at the court above in (enter location/room number) ____________________________ 

and, if you choose not to reach a written settlement agreement with the Plaintiff, file 

your Answer that same day. 

2. A copy of the Complaint against you, a blank answer form, blank request for documents form, 

blank fee waiver forms, and an eviction information form are attached for your use. 

3. To avoid being evicted for non-payment of rent, you can pay all amounts you owe stated in the 

Notice plus any other amounts due under your rental agreement. You must pay this amount before 

the Court enters an eviction order.  

4.  If you take no action, the Plaintiff may ask the Court to enter an eviction order against you. If 

the Court grants that request, that means you will have to move out and it may mean you have to

pay  money  to  the  landlord.  However,  the  Court  is  not  allowed  to  enter  a  default  judgment  for 

possession before the close of business on the date upon which your appearance is due. 

5.  When you file your Answer, you must pay all applicable filing fees to the Clerk of the Court. If 

you cannot afford the filing fee, file JDF 205 - Motion to Waive Fees and JDF 206 - Order for Fee 

Waiver. 

6.  If you file your Answer, you must provide a copy to the Plaintiff or the attorney who signed the 

complaint. In your Answer to the Court, you can state: 

•  Why you believe you have a right to remain in the property,  

•  Whether you admit or deny the landlord’s factual allegations against you and your legal 

defenses, 

•  Whether  you  believe  you  were  given  proper  notice  of  the  landlord’s  reasons  for 

terminating your tenancy before you got this summons, and 

•  Whether you have a counterclaim or cross claim against a party.   

7. If you are claiming that the landlord’s failure to repair the residential premises is a defense to 

the landlord’s allegation of nonpayment of rent, the Court will require you to pay into the registry 

of the Court, at the time of filing your Answer, the rent due less any expenses you have incurred 

based upon the landlord’s failure to repair the residential premises. If you cannot pay this amount, 

you may be eligible for a waiver by filing a motion. (See JDF 109). 

8. Any records associated with the action are suppressed and not accessible to the public 

until an order is entered granting the Plaintiff possession of the premises. If the Plaintiff is 

granted  possession  of  the  premises,  the  court  records  may  remain  suppressed  if  both 

parties agree to suppress the records.

Relevant Colorado Statutes 

3-40-111. 

Issuance and return of summons. 

(1) Upon filing the complaint as required in section 13-40-110, the clerk of the court or the attorney 
for the plaintiff shall issue a summons.  The summons must command the Defendant to appear 
before the Court at a place named in the summons and at a time and on a day not less than seven 
days but not more than fourteen days from the day of issuing the same to answer the complaint 
of plaintiff.  A court shall not enter a default judgment for possession before the close of business 
on the date upon which an appearance is due.  The summons must  also contain a statement 
addressed to the Defendant stating:  "If you do not respond to the landlord's complaint by filing a 
written answer with the court on or before the date and time in this summons or appearing in court 
at the date and time in this summons, the judge may enter a default judgment against you in favor 
of your landlord for possession.  A default judgment for possession means that you will have to 
move out, and it may mean that you will have to pay money to the landlord.  In your answer to the 
court, you can state why you believe you have a right to remain in the property, whether you admit 
or deny the landlord's factual allegations against you, and whether you believe you were given 
proper notice of the landlord's reasons for terminating your tenancy before you got this summons.  
When you file your answer, you must pay a filing fee to the clerk of the court.  If you are claiming 
that the landlord's failure to repair a residential premises is a defense to the landlord's allegation 
of nonpayment of rent, the court will require you to pay into the registry of the court, at the time of 
filing your answer, the rent due less any expenses you have incurred based upon the landlord's 
failure to repair the residential premises; unless the court determines that you qualify to have this 
requirement waived due to your income." 

13-40-112.   Service. 

(1)  Such  summons  may  be  served  by  personal  service  as  in  any  civil  action.    A  copy  of  the 
complaint must be served with the summons. 
  
(2) If personal service cannot be had upon the Defendant by a person qualified under the Colorado 
Rules of Civil Procedure to serve process, after having made diligent effort to make such personal 
service, such person may make service by posting a copy of the summons and the complaint in 
some conspicuous place upon the premises.  In addition thereto, the Plaintiff shall mail, no later 
than the next day following the day on which he/she files the complaint, a copy of the summons, 
or, in the event that an alias summons is issued, a copy of the alias summons, and a copy of the 
complaint to the Defendant at the premises by postage prepaid, first class mail. 

3) Personal service or service by posting shall be made at least seven days before the day for 
appearance  specified  in  such  summons,  and  the  time  and  manner  of  such  service  shall  be 
endorsed upon such summons by the person making service thereof.
