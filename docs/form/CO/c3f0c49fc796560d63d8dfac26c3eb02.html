Step-by-Step: Collecting Your Judgment 

First ask the Judgment Debtor to pay, preferably in writing. 

Step 1: 

Step 2: 

If the Judgment Debtor refuses to pay and you do not know where the Judgment Debtor works, 
banks or owns property, you will need to have the interrogatories served. The Judgment Debtor is 
ordered by the Court to answer the questions truthfully.  The answers provided in the interrogatories 
can be helpful in collecting your judgment, such as employer’s name and pay dates, location of bank 
accounts and/or other assets. 

❑  If you received an Order for Entry of Judgment, the Court has already authorized you to serve the 
Interrogatories  and  for  the  Judgment  Debtor  to  answer  them.    Pursuant  to  Rule  369(g)  of  the 
Colorado  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  the  Judgment  Creditor  can  automatically  issue  the  Form 
Interrogatories (JDF 105 or 108) as part of the judgment order without further order of the Court. 
❑  If  you  want  to  use  any  interrogatories  other  than  the  Pattern  Interrogatories  forms  mentioned  in 
these instructions, you will need to have them approved by the court before they can be used. 

 

Step 3: 

Serve the Court Order and the interrogatories on the Judgment Debtor.

❑  You can have the Judgment Debtor served by doing one of the following: 
❑  Select either the Sheriff’s Department, a private process server, or someone you know who is 18 
years or older and not a party to the action and who knows the rules of service to serve the 
Judgment Debtor. The process server must follow the Service of Process requirements stated in 
Rule 4 or 304. Be sure to direct the sheriff, private process server, or person serving the 
Interrogatories to return the Affidavit of Service to the Court as soon as possible after service has 
been completed. OR 

❑  Ask the court clerk to mail the interrogatories to the Judgment Debtor. You will be responsible for the 

cost of mailing. 

Step 4: 

Await return of the interrogatories. 

❑  The answers must be filed with the Court and a copy mailed to the sender no later than 14 days 

after the Judgment Debtor received them. 

Step 5: 

Upon receipt of the interrogatories, you are ready to file a Writ of Garnishment OR you may request 
to place a lien against real estate owned by the Judgment Debtor.  If the Judgment Debtor does not 
comply with the order in answering the interrogatories, you will need to file a request for an Order to 
Issue a Contempt Citation to the Judgment Debtor, with return of service of interrogatories on 
debtor. 

Step-by-Step: Filing a Writ
