How to Guide for 
Civil Union Divorce (no kids) 

 

hese standard instructions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice about 
your case.  If you choose to represent yourself, you are bound by the same rules and procedures as an 
attorney.  When you file your case, the Court may provide you with a Case Management Order and other 
information about the procedures to be followed.  Please review that information carefully. 
 

ENERAL INFORMATION  

  This information provides a guide to the forms necessary to obtain a Dissolution of Civil Union or Legal Separation 

of Civil Union if there are not children of this Civil Union or the children are emancipated.  

If you are trying to dissolve a common law marriage, do not use forms for dissolution of civil union.  You will need 
to use the forms for dissolution of marriage (divorce).      

◆  Your case should be filed in the county where you or the Co-Petitioner/Respondent reside, or where the Civil 

Union Certificate was issued. 

◆  Either party must reside in Colorado for at least 91 days prior to the filing of the Petition, or if neither party currently 

resides in Colorado, the civil union must have been obtained in Colorado. 

◆  An automatic temporary injunction will be in effect upon the filing of a Co-Petition, upon service of the Petition 
and  Summons  on  the  Respondent,  or  upon  the  signing  of  a  Waiver  and  Acceptance  of  Service  by  the 
Respondent. The temporary injunction will be in effect until the Decree is  entered or until further Court Order.  
The purpose of the injunction is to prevent the transfer of property, discontinuation of insurance coverage, etc. 
without the consent of the other party. 

◆ 

If there are matters or issues that you and your partner cannot resolve, mediation or other forms of alternative 
dispute resolution may be an option. For more information, call the State Office of Dispute Resolution at (720) 
625-5940 or check with your local Court to obtain information on local mediators.  

◆  There is a mandatory 91-day waiting period before the Court can enter the Dissolution/Legal Separation decree.  
If you and your partner sign the same Petition and file as “Petitioner and Co-Petitioner”, the 91-day period begins 
on the date the papers are filed with the Court.  However, if one of you files a Petition for Dissolution of Civil Union 
or Legal Separation of Civil Union and then serves the other party with a copy, the 91-day period begins on the 
date  the Petition is served. Your  dissolution/legal separation will take at least  91  days, and may take longer, 
depending on the circumstances of your case and court schedules.  

◆ 

If after the Petition is filed you change your mind about the dissolution or legal separation of the civil union, you 
must notify the Court immediately and file a Stipulated Motion to Dismiss (JDF 1305). If all of your paperwork is 
filed and you do not file for a dismissal, you may find that your civil union is dissolved or you are legally separated 
even though you and your partner have reconciled.  

◆  For additional information, please review Colorado Revised Statutes §14-10-101, et.seq and §14-15-115.   

◆ 

If you have a disability and need a reasonable accommodation to access the courts, please contact your local 
ADA Coordinator. Contact information can be obtained from the following website:  

http://www.courts.state.co.us/Administration/HR/ADA/Coordinator_List.cfm

conference and both parties were not present, follow step 3 only.   

ETERMINE THE COURT’S PROCEDURE FOR TEMPORARY ORDERS 

emporary Orders are optional for parties.  When you meet with the Family Court Facilitator, Magistrate, or Judge 
during an Initial Status Conference you should discuss this issue, or you may request the Court to make temporary 
decisions about property, debts, and partner support/maintenance, if applicable, by requesting a Temporary Orders 
Hearing.  A Motion for Temporary Orders (JDF 1106) can not be filed without prior approval of the Court pursuant to 
Colorado Rule of Civil Procedure 16.2(c)(4)(B). 

OURT HEARING  

The Judge or Magistrate will grant your Dissolution/Legal Separation by entering an Order/Decree as to division of 
property, debts and partner support/maintenance, if any.   

❑  You may want to check with the Court to determine if both parties are required to appear.  
❑  You will receive a copy of the Final Decree and Support Order, if applicable following the hearing. 
❑  Provide the Court with a self-addressed stamped envelope to receive a copy of the Order/Decree.   If a Court 

is mandatory e-file, self-addressed stamped envelopes may not be required.    

❑  If your address has changed since you initially filed your case, please provide this information to the Court in

the Court and proof  of service to the  other party,  the Court can  order the change in  accordance with the 
statute.   An additional filing fee of $105.00 is required upon the filing of this motion.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
