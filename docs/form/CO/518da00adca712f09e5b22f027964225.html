      <pre>hese  standard  instructions  are  for  informational  purposes  only  and  do  not  constitute  legal 
advice about your case.  If you choose to represent yourself, you are bound by the same  rules 
and procedures as an attorney.  When you file your case the Court may provide you with a Case 
Management Order and other information about the  procedures to be  followed.  Please review 
that information carefully. 
 

ENERAL INFORMATION  

  This information provides a guide to the forms necessary to obtain a Dissolution of Civil Union or Legal Separation 

of Civil Union with children of this Civil Union.  

If you are trying to dissolve a common-law marriage, do not use forms for dissolution of civil union.  You will 
need to use the forms for dissolution of marriage (divorce).      

◆  Your case should be filed in the county where you or the Co-Petitioner/Respondent reside, or where the Civil 

Union Certificate was issued. 

◆  Either party must reside in Colorado for at least 91 days prior to the filing of the Petition, or if neither party resides 

in Colorado, the civil union must have been obtained in Colorado. 

◆  The children must reside in Colorado for a minimum of 182 consecutive days prior to the filing date or since birth 
if under six months of age. If this time requirement is not met at the time of filing, issues regarding the children 
cannot be addressed as part of the dissolution/legal separation of civil union case.  

◆  An automatic temporary injunction will be in effect upon the filing of a Co-Petition, upon service of the Petition 
and  Summons  on  the  Respondent,  or  upon  the  signing  of  a  Waiver  and  Acceptance  of  Service  by  the 
Respondent. The temporary injunction will be in effect until the Decree is entered or until further Court Order.  
The purpose of the injunction is to prevent the transfer of property, discontinuation of insurance coverage, etc. 
without the consent of the other party. 

◆ 

If there are matters or issues that you and your partner cannot resolve, mediation or other forms of alternative 
dispute resolution may be an option. For more information, call the State Office of Dispute Resolution at (720) 
625-5940 or check with your local Court to obtain information on local mediators.  

◆  There is a mandatory 91-day waiting period before the Court can enter the dissolution/legal separation decree.  
If you and your partner sign the same Petition and file as “Petitioner and Co-Petitioner”, the 91 day period begins 
on the date the papers are filed with the Court.  However, if one of you files a Petition for Dissolution of Civil Union 
or Legal Separation of Civil Union and then serves the other partner with a copy, the 91-day period begins on the 
date  the Petition is served. Your dissolution/legal separation will take at least  91  days, and may take longer, 
depending on the circumstances of your case and court schedules.  

◆ 

If after the Petition is filed you change your mind about the dissolution of civil union or legal separation of civil 
union, you must notify the Court immediately and file a Stipulated Motion to Dismiss (JDF 1305). If all of your 
paperwork is filed and you do not file for a dismissal, you may find that your civil union is dissolved or that you 
are legally separated even though you and your partner have reconciled.  

◆  For additional information, please review Colorado Revised Statutes §14-10-101, et.seq and §14-15-115.   

◆ 

If you have a disability and need a reasonable accommodation to access the courts, please contact your local 
ADA Coordinator. Contact information can be obtained from the following website:

❑  If you or the Co-Petitioner/Respondent is requesting to have a name changed/restored, please 
Identify  the  restored  name  you  or  the  Co-

 

complete  this  section  on  the  Decree. 
Petitioner/Respondent is requesting.  

❑  Support Order (JDF 1117): 

❑  Complete the caption and the sections about the parties and children.   
❑  The Magistrate or Judge will complete the remaining sections of the Support Order and give you and 

your partner a signed copy.  

ETTING STATUS CONFERENCE OR HEARING DATES  

lease review the Instructions to Set a Hearing and to  Complete a Notice of Hearing or Status Conference Form 
(JDF  1122).  It  is  important  to  notify  the  other  party  of  the  future  status  conference  or  hearing  by  completing  the 
appropriate forms and sending the other party a copy. 
 

❑  If the Court has provided you with specific information on how to schedule a status conference or hearing in 

a Case Management Order you received at the time of filing, follow those procedures.    

❑  If the Court provided you with a date for a status conference when you filed your petition or at an initial status 

conference and both parties were not present, follow step 3 only.   

ETERMINE THE COURT’S PROCEDURE FOR TEMPORARY ORDERS 

emporary Orders are optional for parties.  When you meet with the Family Court Facilitator, Magistrate, or Judge 
during an Initial Status Conference you should discuss this issue, or you may request the Court to make temporary 
decisions  about  property,  debts,  allocation  of  parental 
responsibilities,  child  support,  and  partner 
support/maintenance, if applicable, by requesting a Temporary Orders Hearing. A Motion for Temporary Orders (JDF 
1106) can not be filed without prior approval of the Court pursuant to Colorado Rule of Civil Procedure 16.2(c)(4)(B). 

OURT HEARING  

The Judge or Magistrate will grant your dissolution/legal separation by entering an Order/Decree as to division of 
property, debts, parenting time, child support, and maintenance, if any.   
 

❑  A short hearing is required if you have children and both parties are not represented by an attorney. You may 

want to check with the Court to determine if both parties are required to appear.  
❑  You will receive a copy of the Final Decree and Support Order following the hearing. 
❑  Provide the Court with a self-addressed stamped envelope to receive a copy of the Order/Decree.   If a Court 

is mandatory e-file, self-addressed stamped envelopes may not be required.    

❑  If your address has changed since you initially filed your case, please provide this information to the Court in 

writing. 

Notice: 
If you  filed  for a Legal Separation  of Civil Union  only, and  not a Dissolution of  Civil Union, §14-10-120(2), 
C.R.S. and  §14-15-107(4), C.R.S.  allows for a change/conversion of a  Legal Separation  of Civil Union  to  a 
Dissolution of Civil Union no earlier than 182 days after entry of a Decree of Legal Separation.  Upon a motion 
filed with the Court and proof of service to the other party, the Court can order the change in accordance 
with the statute.  An additional filing fee of $105.00 is required upon the filing of this motion.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
