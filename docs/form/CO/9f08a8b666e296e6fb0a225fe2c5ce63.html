Heirs are those people who are entitled by statute to the decedent’s property when there is no will (or 
when the will does not dispose of all assets). 

 

And 

If no descendants 
survive the decedent, 
surviving parents are 
also heirs, unless the 
decedent is survived 
by a designated 
beneficiary. 

 

And 

If decedent was 
married at the time of 
death, the spouse is an 
heir, unless the 
decedent is survived by 
a person with the right 
to inherit property 
pursuant to a 
designated beneficiary 
agreement. In that 
case, the designated 
beneficiary is an heir. 
See §15-11- 102.5. 

If decedent had children 
(or descendants of pre-
deceased children), the 
children/descendants are 
also heirs, unless all of 
them are 
children/descendants of 
the surviving spouse AND 
the surviving spouse does 
not have any surviving 
children/descendants with 
any other person. If the 
spouse is not an heir 
because the decedent is 
survived by a designated 
beneficiary, then the 
children/descendants are 
heirs regardless of their 
relationship to any 
surviving spouse. 

If none of the above, then: 

Decedent’s brothers and sisters (and 
descendants of any pre-deceased brothers and 
sisters) are the heirs. 

 

If none, then: 

Decedent's grandparents, or if both grandparents 
on either side (maternal or paternal) are 
deceased, the descendants of the pre-deceased 
grandparents are also heirs. 

Important Note: 

If any person who would be an heir died before decedent, then their children substitute for 
them and become the decedent’s heirs.    Therefore, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, 
nieces, nephews, etc., must be considered when determining heirship.  Heirs must survive 
the decedent by at least 120 hours.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
