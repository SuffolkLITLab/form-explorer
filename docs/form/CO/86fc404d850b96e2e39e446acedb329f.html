Pattern Interrogatories 

The following Pattern Interrogatories are propounded to: 

[Name]  

pursuant to C.R.C.P. 16(b)(11), 26, and 33(e). 

Section 1.  General Instructions 

These pattern interrogatories and instructions do not change existing Rules or other law 
relating to interrogatories.  For time limitations, requirements for service on other parties, 
and other details, see C.R.C.P. 16(b)(11), 26, 33, 121 § 1-12, and the cases construing 
those Rules. 

These pattern interrogatories and instructions do not affect an answering party’s right to 
assert any privilege or objection.  Parties may object to these pattern interrogatories on 
grounds including, but not limited to, that the interrogatories exceed the scope of 
permissible discovery as defined in C.R.C.P. 26(b)(1) because the inquiry is not relevant 
to the claims and defenses of any party or is not proportional to the needs of the case.

Section 2.  Instructions to the Asking Party 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

(e) 

(f) 

(g) 

These interrogatories are intended for optional use in district courts only.  They are 
approved sample discovery requests but are not intended to be used in every case. 

Parties should carefully consider the claims and defenses at issue to determine whether 
these  pattern  interrogatories  are  applicable  to  their  particular  action.    Parties also should 
carefully consider whether these pattern interrogatories are proportional to the discovery 
needs of their particular case. 

Parties are strongly encouraged to consider whether the information sought through these 
pattern interrogatories would be better obtained through requests for the production of 
documents containing the information sought.  As one example, the objective of an 
interrogatory asking for information relating to a party’s medical treatment might more 
efficiently be achieved by asking for the party’s medical records in a request for 
production. 

C.R.C.P. 26(a)(1)(C) requires production of specific information relating to the categories 
and amounts of a party’s claimed damages.  As a result, interrogatories requesting 
information relating to claimed damages may not be necessary, or may be tailored to 
particular topics relating to a party’s claimed damages. 

Check the box next to each interrogatory that you want the answering party to answer.  
Each checked box counts as one interrogatory for purposes of C.R.C.P. 26(b)(2)(B) and case 
management orders. 

The interrogatories in section 16.0, Defendant’s Contentions—Personal Injury, should not 
be used until the defendant has had a reasonable opportunity to conduct an investigation 
or discovery of plaintiff’s injuries and damages. 

Subject to the limitations in C.R.C.P. 16(b)(11) and 33, additional, non-pattern 
interrogatories may be included.

Section 3.  Instructions to the Answering Party 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

An answer or other appropriate response must be given to each interrogatory checked by 
the asking party. 

As a general rule, within 35 days after you are served with these interrogatories, you must 
serve your responses on the asking party and serve copies of your responses on all other 
parties to the action who have appeared.    See C.R.C.P. 33 for details. 

Each answer must be as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably 
available to you permits.  If an interrogatory cannot be answered completely, answer it to 
the extent possible. 

If you do not have enough personal knowledge to fully answer an interrogatory, say  so, 
but  make  a  reasonable  and  good  faith  effort  to  get  the  information  by  asking other persons 
or organizations, unless the information is equally available to the asking party. 

(e)  Whenever an interrogatory may be answered by referring to a document, the document 

may be attached as an exhibit to the response and referred to in the response.  If the 
document has more than one page, refer to the page and section where the answer to the 
interrogatory can be found.  In addition, C.R.C.P. 33(d) permits an answering party to 
identify and make available business records in lieu of responding to a particular 
interrogatory. 

(f)  Whenever an address and telephone number for the same person are requested in more 
than one interrogatory, you are required to furnish them in answering only the first 
interrogatory asking for that information. 

(g) 

Your answers to these interrogatories must be verified, dated, and signed.  You may use 
the following form at the end of your answers: “I declare under penalty of perjury under 
the laws of the State of Colorado that the foregoing answers are true and correct to the 
best of my knowledge, information and belief.”

Section 4.  Definitions 

Words in BOLDFACE CAPITALS in these interrogatories are defined as 

follows: 

(a) 

INCIDENT includes the circumstances and events surrounding the alleged 
accident, injury,  or  other  occurrence  or  breach  of  contract  giving  rise  to  this 
action or proceeding. 

(b)  YOU OR ANYONE ACTING ON YOUR BEHALF includes you, your 
agents, your employees, your insurance companies, their agents, their 
employees, your attorneys, your accountants, your investigators, and anyone 
else acting on your behalf. 

(c) 

PERSON OR ENTITY includes a natural person and any organization 
other than a natural person. 

(d)  DOCUMENT means a writing, as defined in CRE 1001, and includes the 

original or a copy of a handwriting, a typewriting, printing, photocopying, a 
photograph, electronically stored information (including emails), and every 
other means of recording upon any tangible thing and any form of 
communicating or representation, including letters, words, pictures, sounds, 
or symbols, or combinations of them. 

(e)  HEALTH CARE PROVIDER includes any PERSON OR ENTITY 

referred to as a “Health Care Institution” or “Health Care Professional” in 
C.R.S. § 13-64-202(3) and (4). 

(f) 

ADDRESS means the street address, including the city, state, and zip code. 

The following interrogatories have been approved by the Colorado Supreme Court under 
C.R.C.P. 16(b)(11), 26, and 33(e).  The pattern interrogatories have been modified to more 
appropriately conform to the 2015 amendments to C.R.C.P. 16, 26, and 33.  A change to or 
deletion of a pre-2017 pattern interrogatory should not be construed as making that former 
interrogatory improper, but instead, only that the particular interrogatory is, as of the effective 
date of the 2017 rule change, modified as stated or is no longer a “pattern interrogatory.”
