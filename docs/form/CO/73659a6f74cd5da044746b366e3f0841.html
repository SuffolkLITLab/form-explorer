      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS TO FILE A MOTION OR STIPULATION  
TO RELOCATE MINOR CHILDREN 

   

 

These standard instructions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice about your 
case.  If you choose to represent yourself, you are bound by the same rules and procedures as an attorney. 

  This information provides a guide to the process and forms necessary to file a Motion/Stipulation to Relocate 

  You  are  responsible  for  notifying  the  other  party  in  writing  of  your  request  to  relocate,  the  location 
where you plan to relocate, the reason for the relocation, and a proposed parenting plan. This should 
be done either  before  you  file a  Motion to Relocate the Minor Child(ren), or  as  soon after as  possible.  This 
applies whether the proposed move is within or outside of the State of Colorado. 

  You must have an existing court order concerning parenting time. 
  If  a  motion  has  been  filed  seeking  to  relocate  the  child(ren)  to  a  residence  that  substantially  changes  the 
geographical ties between the child(ren) and the other party, the Court shall consider the following factors.    
1.  whether a party has been a perpetrator of spouse/partner abuse as that term is defined in §14-10-124(4), 
C.R.S.  which  factor  shall  be  supported  by  credible  evidence,  whether  such  spouse/partner  abuse 
occurred before of after the prior decree. 
reasons why the party wishes to relocate with the child(ren); 
reasons why the opposing party is objecting to the proposed relocation; 

2. 
3. 
4.  history  and  quality  of  each  party’s  relationship(s)  with  the  child(ren)  since  any  previous  court  approved 

5.  educational opportunities for the child(ren) at the existing location and at the proposed new location; 
6.  presence or absence of extended family at the existing location and at the proposed new location; 
7.  advantages of the child(ren) remaining with the primary caregiver; 
8.  anticipated impact of the move on the child(ren); 
9.  whether the Court will be able to fashion a reasonable parenting time schedule if the change requested is 

Parenting Plan; 

permitted; and 

10.  any other relevant factors bearing on the best interests of the child(ren). 

  When seeking to relocate the child(ren) and to modify the parenting plan, please consider whether child support 
also  needs  to  be  modified.  Please  review  the  Instructions  JDF  1403I.    If  child  support  needs  to  be  modified, 
check box 9 on the Motion to Relocate Minor Children. Child support is calculated under statutory guidelines.  
If there has been a “substantial and continuing” change in circumstances (for example, one of the parties has 
received a significant pay raise or pay cut), then you may file for a modification.  The change in circumstances 
must amount to a 10% increase or decrease in the current amount of child support.   

  For additional information, please review §14-10-129(1)(a)(II), C.R.S. 
  If you have a disability and need a reasonable accommodation to access the courts, please contact your local 

ADA Coordinator. Contact information can be obtained from the following website:

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
