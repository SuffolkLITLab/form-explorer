access to the records.  The court will make this decision based on the information you provide (see §19-1-309, 
C.R.S.). 
 

  You should file your request to access juvenile records (see Form JDF 534) in the county where the custody, 
relinquishment,  or  adoption  was  located  in  the  existing  case.    You  may  have  to  contact  the  Colorado 
Department of Human Services to determine in which county court records may be located.   

The  Colorado  Department  of  Human  Services  handles  requests  related  to  records  for  the  State  of  Colorado 
Home for Dependent and Neglected Children.  They may be reached at (303)866-3228.  The home was also

ACCESS TO THE ORIGINAL BIRTH CERTIFICATE OR TO A DEATH

  If you are the birth parent and you relinquished (gave up) your child for adoption, you may apply to the State 

Registrar at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) – Vital Records Division for 
a non-certified copy of the child’s original birth certificate IF: 

  Your name is on the original birth certificate OR you signed the original birth certificate; AND 
•  The child was born in Colorado OR the adoption was finalized in Colorado

from the State Registrar a noncertified copy of the unaltered original birth certificate and the amended birth 
certificate of an adult sibling or half sibling who was born, relinquished, or adopted in the State of Colorado. 

  If you are a birth parent, you may ask the State Registrar to search for a death certificate to determine whether 

a former ward or birth parent is deceased.  There may be a fee for this service.
