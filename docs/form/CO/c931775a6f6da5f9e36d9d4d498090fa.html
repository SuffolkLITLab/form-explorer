      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILING A  
COUNTY COURT CIVIL OR SMALL CLAIMS APPEAL 

   

 

These standard instructions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice about your 
case.  If you choose to represent yourself, you are bound by the same rules and procedures as an attorney. 

ENERAL INFORMATION  

  An appeal is not a new trial, but an opportunity to request the District Court to review the proceedings from a 
county court civil case or a small claims case based upon law, if a party believes that the judgment is in error. 

◆  Neither party is present for an appeal; it is a paper review only by the District Court. 
◆  You may not file any new evidence or subpoena witnesses for an appeal. 
◆  An appeal can be filed by either party if they believe that the judgment entered is in error.   
◆  The party appealing, the Appellant, must file the Notice of Appeal and the Appeal Bond in the County Court 

within 14 days of entry of the judgment by the County or Small Claims Court.  

◆  The Appellant must post an Appeal Bond in cash or certified funds within 14 days of the entry of the judgment.  
◆  The  Appeal  Bond  may  be  the  amount  of  the  judgment  in  a  money  demand  case,  the  amount  of  rent  in  an 
eviction case or any designated amount set by the Judge.  The Appeal Bond shall be approved by the Judge 
or the Clerk. 

◆  The  Appellant  must  also  file  the  Notice  of  Appeal  in  the  District  court  within  35  days  after  the  filing  of  the 

notice of appeal in County or Small Claims court. 

◆  The  Appellant  must  request  a  written  transcript  and  deposit  an  estimated  fee  in  advance  of  preparing  the 
record  and  a  written  transcript  of  the  proceedings  from  the  County  or  Small  Claims  Court.  For  any  appeal 
from  a  judgment  entered  after  July  1,  2013,  the  clerk  of  the  County  or  Small  Claims  Court  will  prepare  the 
transcript within 42 days of filing the notice of appeal.  For an appeal from a judgment entered prior to July 1, 
2013, the clerk of the County or Small Claims Court will prepare the transcript  within 42 days of the entry of 
the judgment.  Transcribers usually charge by the page and the Appellant must pay any additional fees above 
the deposit before the clerk will file the record with the District Court.  

◆  For additional information, please review Rule 411 of the Colorado Rules of County Court Civil Procedure, §13-

6-311, C.R.S., and §16-2-114, C.R.S.  

◆  If you have a disability and need a reasonable accommodation to access the courts, please contact your local 

ADA Coordinator. Contact information can be obtained from the following website:

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
