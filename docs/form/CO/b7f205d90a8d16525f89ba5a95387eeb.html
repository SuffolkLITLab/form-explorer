      <pre>Note: 

These standard instructions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal 
advice about your case. 

If you choose to represent yourself, you are bound by the same rules and procedures as an 
attorney. 

General Information 

  A Defendant may petition the Court to seal multiple criminal conviction records, except basic 

identifying information, by filing in the District Court in the county in which the criminal conviction 
records are filed. 

  If you have been convicted of offenses in different judicial districts, you must file a petition in each 

district and attach a copy of each petition filed in the other districts. 

  The Court will not seal criminal conviction records if you still owe restitution. 
  An Order sealing conviction records does not vacate a conviction. 

  If you obtain a conviction for a new criminal offense after an order sealing conviction records is 

entered, the Court shall order the sealed conviction records to be unsealed. 

  The Court, law enforcement, criminal justice agencies, and the prosecuting attorney may use any 
sealed conviction(s) for any lawful purpose relating to the investigation or prosecution of any case 
or for any other lawful purpose within the scope of the their duties. A party or agency required by 
law to conduct a criminal history record check is authorized to use any sealed conviction for the 
lawful purpose for which the criminal history record check is required by law.  

  Pursuant to C.R.S § 24-72-703(4), the conviction records are not physically destroyed. 

  Upon the entry of an Order to Seal and an inquiry in the matter, you and all criminal justice 
agencies may properly respond that public criminal records do not exist with respect to the 
defendant. 

  For additional information, please review C.R.S. §§ 24-72-703, and -709.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
