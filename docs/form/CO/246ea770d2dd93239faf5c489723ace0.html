4.  Certificate of Compliance: Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) 

The juvenile court inquired about the Indian Child Welfare Act 

(“ICWA”) during the initial hearing on January 1, 2021.  TR 01/01/21 p. 4:4-

10.  Appellant C.D. (“Mother”) asserted that she had American Indian heritage 

— specifically, Mother stated she believed her paternal grandmother and 

grandfather were members of one of the Cherokee tribes.  TR 01/01/21 p. 

4:13-20.  Mother claimed she did not know about her own registration status.  

TR 01/01/21 p. 5:8-10.  Father E.F. (“Father”) stated at a separate hearing 

held on February 1, 2021, that he did not have American Indian heritage.  TR 

02/01/21 p. 16:1-4.  Father also submitted a written “Declaration of Non-

Indian Heritage” form.  CF p. 134. 

On March 1, 2021, Mother’s trial counsel told the juvenile court that 

counsel had not found any information to support Mother’s assertion that she 

had American Indian heritage.  TR 03/01/21 p. 10:11-16.  Mother maintained 

that she may have Cherokee heritage, but she did not submit a written “ICWA 

packet.”  TR 03/01/21 p. 11:12-14.  Notices were sent to all federally-

recognized Cherokee tribes, and responses were received from all but one tribe.  

CF p. 220-60.  The juvenile court found that responses received from the tribes 

had not shown that Mother or her paternal grandparents were tribal members.

  J

TR 03/01/21 p. 15:12-20, CF p. 266.  The juvenile court concluded by order 

dated March 15, 2021, that ICWA did not apply to the proceedings.  CF p. 266-

68.   

Upon review of the record, Mother does not raise any claim that the 

juvenile court failed to comply with ICWA.

Issues on Appeal 

I. 

The juvenile court erred in terminating Mother’s parental rights because 

the Department failed to timely notify her of the motion to terminate 

parental rights filed on June 1, 2021, and of the termination hearing held 

on September 1, 2021.

The Denver County Human Services Department (“Department”) filed 

a petition in dependency and neglect on January 1, 2021.  CF p. 1-4.  The 

petition alleged that Mother and Father had substance abuse issues and that a 

neighbor had seen A.B., at the time six years old, outside the home, without 

supervision, multiple times in the last week.  CF p. 2.  The Department took 

custody of A.B. and placed her in a foster home.  CF p. 50. 

 

On March 1, 2021, Mother entered a “no fault” admission to the 

petition and the court adjudicated the child dependent and neglected.  CF p. 

134.  On May 1, 2021, the juvenile court adopted the Department’s proposed 

treatment plan for Mother.  TR 05/01/21 p. 10:13-18.  Mother’s treatment 

plan required her, as relevant here, to cooperate with the Department, address 

mental health and substance abuse issues, and participate in parenting time with 

A.B.  CF p. 283. 

 

On May 1, 2021, Mother’s trial counsel filed a motion to withdraw from 

the representation, because trial counsel, a member of the United States Armed 

Forces, was called to serve Active Duty in a foreign country for an unspecified 

duration.  CF p. 312-13.  The juvenile court granted the motion to withdraw on 

May 28, 2021, without appointing substitute counsel to which Mother was 

entitled.  CF p. 321.

R: January 25, 2023

  J

 

On June 1, 2021, while Mother was still not represented by counsel, the 

Department filed a motion to terminate Mother’s and Father’s parental rights.  

CF p. 433-35.  Notice of the motion to terminate was not served on Mother, 

but only on withdrawn trial counsel.  TR 09/01/21 p. 19:12-16; CF p. 678. 

On June 8, 2021, the juvenile court appointed new trial counsel for 

Mother.  CF p. 445.  New trial counsel was never sent notice of the termination 

motion.  TR 09/01/21 p. 19:12-16; CF p. 678. 

The juvenile court set the termination hearing for September 1, 2021.  

TR 07/01/21 p. 12:13-14, CF 456.  After reviewing the electronic file in this 

case, new trial counsel contacted withdrawn counsel’s office, and since 

withdrawn counsel had already left the country, her administrative assistant — 

who retained access to the file — notified new trial counsel on August 20, 

2021, of the termination motion and the termination hearing set for less than 

two weeks later.  TR 09/01/21 p. 20:1-8, 21:8-20; CF p. 678-79.   

 

 

At the termination hearing, Mother’s counsel told the court that notice 

of the motion to terminate had not been provided to Mother or to trial counsel 

while trial counsel represented her.  TR 09/01/21 p. 19:12-16, 20:1-8, 21:8-20.  

The juvenile court concluded that Mother received sufficient notice of 

the termination motion and hearing.  After hearing evidence, the court granted 

DF 1987 DN – Sample Opening Brief (Dependency & Neglect) 

R: January 25, 2023 

Page 8 

 

  J

the Department’s motion to terminate Mother’s parental rights.  TR 09/01/21 

p. 28:13-19; CF p. 675-80.  This appeal concerns that termination order. 

7.  Argument Summary 

 

The juvenile court erred in terminating Mother’s parental rights because 

the Department failed to timely notify her of the motion to terminate parental 

rights filed on June 1, 2021, and of the termination hearing held on September 

1, 2021.  The Department never served Mother or her trial counsel, while trial 

counsel represented her, with the motion to terminate, or with notice of the 

hearing.  Mother learned of the motion to terminate and the termination 

hearing only by contacting the offices of withdrawn counsel.  And she learned 

of the motion and hearing less than two weeks before the hearing was held, 

leaving her with too little time to prepare for the hearing — indeed, depriving 

her of her constitutional right to due process of law.  

The Department’s failure to properly serve Mother or her current trial 

counsel with notice of the termination hearing violated C.R.C.P. 5 and the 

Colorado Supreme Court’s decision in People in Interest of M.M., 726 P.2d 1108, 

1115-17 (Colo. 1986) (holding former rule C.R.C.P. 5(d) required service on 

respondent parent within forty-eight hours of filing of the motion to terminate 

parental rights).  Moreover, unlike M.M., in the circumstances here, the juvenile

  J

court’s error was not harmless, but was prejudicial — it denied Mother her 

substantial rights and requires reversal of the termination order. 

8.  Argument 

I. 

The juvenile court erred in terminating Mother’s parental rights because 

the Department failed to timely notify her of the motion to terminate 

parental rights filed on June 1, 2021, and of the termination hearing held 

on September 1, 2021. 

A. 

Standard of Review: 

Whether a juvenile court erred in terminating parental rights 

without proper notice is reviewed under a de novo standard.  See People in 

Interest of R.J.B., 2021 COA 4, ¶ 26 (applying de novo review to a 

procedural due process claim); see also People in Interest of A.B-A., 2019 

COA 125, ¶ 49 (reviewing the constitutional sufficiency of service by 

publication de novo). 

B. 

Preservation: 

Trial counsel for Mother preserved this issue for appellate review 

by raising it during opening statement and in closing argument of the 

termination hearing.  TR 09/01/21 p. 19:12-16, 20:1-8, 21:8-20.

C.  Discussion and Argument: 

i. 

Legal Authority 

Because a parent has a fundamental right to the companionship, 

care, custody, and management of his or her child, a parent’s rights 

must be protected with fundamentally fair procedures when a 

permanent termination of parental rights is sought.  In re J.M.A., 240 

P.3d 547, 549-50 (Colo. App. 2010).  Thus, when termination is sought, 

due process requires that the parent be provided with adequate notice 

of the termination hearing and an opportunity to protect his or her 

interests at the hearing itself.  Id. at 550. 

Notice must be reasonably calculated to apprise parents of the 

pendency of an action and afford them an opportunity to present 

objections.  A.B-A., ¶ 50. 

Moreover, to the extent a parent has actual notice of the 

proceeding through their communication with another person, such 

notice may not cure the court’s error in failing to observe that formal 

service requirements were met.  Id. at ¶ 63. 

Turning to applicable rules, the service requirements of C.R.C.P. 

5 apply to a motion for termination of parental rights.  People in Interest of 

DF 1987 DN – Sample Opening Brief (Dependency & Neglect) 

R: January 25, 2023 

Page 11 

 

  J

M.M., 726 P.2d 1108, 1116-17 (Colo. 1986).  It is indisputable that in 

these circumstances, C.R.C.P. 5(a) required that the Department serve 

Mother with the motion to terminate her parental rights.  The rule 

provides, “Except as otherwise provided in these rules, . . . every paper 

relating to discovery required to be served upon a party unless the court 

otherwise orders, every written motion other than one which may be 

heard ex parte, and every written notice . . . shall be served upon each 

of the parties.” 

There is also no doubt that although section 19-3-602, C.R.S. 

2021 — the statute governing motions for termination of parental 

rights in Colorado juvenile courts — does not contain a notice 

provision, Colorado law requires that a juvenile court provide a parent 

with notice of a motion to terminate their parental rights, and of any 

hearing to terminate such rights.  See M.M., 726 P.2d at 1115 (noting 

that even where a statute “contains no express requirement that a 

parent be served with a termination motion or be otherwise notified of 

its filing, due process requires that a parent be provided with adequate 

notice of a termination hearing and an opportunity to protect her 

interests at the hearing itself”).

Page 12 

 

  J

An error in a civil case is harmless if it did not affect a substantial 

right of a party.  People in Interest of. R.D., 2012 COA 35, ¶ 25.  An error 

affects a substantial right only if it can be said with fair assurance that 

the error substantially influenced the outcome of the case or impaired 

the basic fairness of the trial itself.  Id. 

ii. 

Discussion 

Applying the law to the facts of this case, it is evident that the 

juvenile court erred in terminating Mother’s parental rights when she 

lacked sufficient notice of the motion to terminate her parental rights 

and of the termination hearing.  When the Department failed to timely 

notify Mother of the motion to terminate parental rights filed on June 1, 

2021, and of the termination hearing held on September 1, 2021, her 

substantial rights were affected.  Indeed, her constitutional right to due 

process of law was denied because she was deprived of an adequate 

opportunity to protect her own interests at the termination hearing.  

Accordingly, for the reasons stated below, the juvenile court’s 

termination order must be set aside. 

First, here the Department never served Mother with a copy of the 

motion to terminate her parental rights.  TR 09/01/21 p. 19:12-16, 20:1-

DF 1987 DN – Sample Opening Brief (Dependency & Neglect) 

R: January 25, 2023 

Page 13 

 

  J

8, 21:8-20.  This failure to meet the formal requirements for service in a 

dependency and neglect action constituted a violation of C.R.C.P. 5(a) 

and of the Colorado Supreme Court’s dictate in M.M., 726 P.2d at 1115-

17.  To uphold the juvenile court’s order terminating Mother’s parental 

rights when this violation obviously occurred and was never remedied 

would flout Mother’s constitutional rights and depart from Colorado 

law. 

Second, as a division of this court stated in A.B-A., ¶ 63, any 

actual notice imputed to Mother or her newly-appointed counsel — after 

they went out of their way to contact the offices of withdrawn counsel 

to discover that termination had been requested and a hearing set — 

may not cure the juvenile court’s error in failing to observe that formal 

service requirements were met.  In A.B-A., the child’s father was living 

in Iran and was not served with notice that the Department had moved 

to terminate his parental rights.  Id. at ¶ 59.  Although a caseworker 

informed father of the motion to terminate and of the termination 

hearing, this court held that father’s actual notice thereof did not cure 

the juvenile court’s error in proceeding with termination despite failing 

to formally provide notice to father.  Id. at ¶¶ 57-64. 

DF 1987 DN – Sample Opening Brief (Dependency & Neglect) 

R: January 25, 2023 

Page 14 

 

  J

This case is like A.B-A.  Without proper notice of the motion to 

terminate and of the termination hearing, the juvenile court could not 

simply infer that Mother had been provided with an adequate 

opportunity to prepare for the termination hearing because she was 

made aware of the motion to terminate by withdrawn counsel’s 

administrative assistant.  The Department and the juvenile court failed to 

discharge their duties under Colorado law and the United States 

Constitution. 

Finally, the juvenile’s court decision to proceed with termination 

despite the Department’s failure to properly serve Mother was not 

harmless error.  Unlike the parent not served with the motion to 

terminate in M.M., 726 P.2d at 1117, Mother did not obtain actual notice 

of the motion to terminate and the termination hearing four months 

prior to the hearing, nor was she served with the motion to terminate 

twenty-two days prior to the hearing.  TR 09/01/21 p. 19:12-16, 20:1-8, 

21:8-20.  Instead, her substantial rights were vitiated — she was not 

informed of the hearing until twelve days before it was held, and she was 

never served with the termination motion.  TR 09/01/21 p. 19:12-16, 

20:1-8, 21:8-20.

9.  Conclusion 

 

For the reasons stated above, Mother respectfully requests that this court 

reverse the juvenile court’s order terminating her parental rights and remand 

the case for further proceedings.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
