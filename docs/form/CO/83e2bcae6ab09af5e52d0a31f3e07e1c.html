Explanation of Wage Garnishment in Colorado 
Notice of garnishment to judgment debtor. 
Money will be taken from your pay if you fail to act. 

You are getting this notice because a court has ruled that you owe the judgment creditor, who is called 

“Creditor” in this notice, money. Creditor has started a legal process called a “garnishment”. The process requires 
that money be taken from your pay and given to Creditor to pay what you owe. The person who pays you does not 
keep the money. 

Creditor filled out this form. The law requires the person who pays you to give you this notice. Creditor may 
not be the person or company to which you originally owed money. You may request that Creditor provide the name 
and address of the person or company to which you originally owed money. If you want this information, you must 
write Creditor or Creditor’s lawyer at the address at the very beginning of this form. You must do this within 14 days 
after receiving this notice. Creditor will send you this information at the address you give Creditor. Creditor must send 
you this information within 7 days after receiving your request. Knowing the name of the original creditor might help 
you understand why the money will be taken from your pay. 
 

he amount the court has ruled that you currently owe is listed at the top of the writ of garnishment. The 
amount could go up if there are more court costs or additional interest. The interest rate on the amount you owe is 
listed at the top of the Writ of Garnishment. The amount could also go down if you make payments to Creditor. 

  T

2.  How much do I owe? 

3.  How will the amount I owe be paid? 

The person who pays you will start taking money from your paycheck on the first payday that is at least 14 

days after the day the person who pays you sends you this notice. Money will continue to be taken from your pay for 

1.  Why am I getting this notice?

up to 6 months. If the debt is not paid off or not likely to be paid off by that time, Creditor may serve another 
garnishment. 

he rules about how much of your pay can be taken are explained in the notice of Colorado Rules About 
Garnishment that you received with this notice. This notice also contains an estimate of how much of your pay will 
likely be withheld each paycheck. 

t any time, you can get a report that shows how the amount taken from your pay was calculated. To 

receive this report, you must write or e-mail the person who pays you. 

4.  Do I have options? 

es, you have several options, here are three of them: 

.  You can talk with a lawyer: A lawyer can explain the situations to you and help you decide what to do. 
The self-help desk of the court where the garnishment action is pending can provide you help with 
resources to find a lawyer. 

B.  You can contact Creditor: If you can work something out with Creditor, money might not have to be 

taken from your pay. The Creditor’s contact information is on the first page of the writ of garnishment. 

C.  You can request a court hearing: A hearing could be helpful if there are disagreements about the 

garnishment, the amount the court has ruled that you owe, whether the amount of money being 
withheld from your paycheck is correct, or whether the amount being withheld should be reduced to 
help you support your family and yourself. If you disagree with the estimate of the amount of money that 
will be withheld from your paycheck, you must attempt to work this out with the person who pays you 
before going to court. You must do this within 7 days after receiving this notice. If you cannot work it out 
with the person who pays you, you may seek a hearing in court. If you want a court hearing, you must 
request one. If you think that you need more money to support your family and yourself, you may seek a 
court hearing without consulting the person who pays you. For help requesting a hearing, contact the 
self-help desk of the court where the garnishment action is pending. 

5.  What if I don’t do anything? 

If you don’t do anything, the law requires that money be taken out of your paycheck beginning with the first 

payday that is at least 14 days after the day the person who pays you sends you this notice. The money will be given 
to Creditor. This process will continue for 6 months unless your debt is paid off before that. 

6.  How does garnishment work in Colorado? 

Only a portion of your pay can be garnished. The amount that can be withheld from your pay depends on 
something called “disposable earnings”. Your disposable earnings are what is left after deductions from your gross 
pay for taxes and certain health insurance costs. Your paycheck stub should tell what your disposable earnings are. 

he amount of your disposable earnings that can be garnished is determined by comparing two numbers: 

(1) 20% of your disposable earnings and (2) the amount by which your disposable earnings exceed 40 times the 
minimum wage. The smaller of these two amounts will be deducted from your pay. 

f you think that your earnings after garnishment are not enough to support yourself and any members of 

your family that you support, you can try to have the amount of your disposable earnings that are garnished further 
reduced. This is discussed earlier in this notice under 4. Do I have options? 

our employer cannot fire you because your earnings have been garnished. If your employer does this in 
violation of your legal rights, you may file a lawsuit within 91 days of your firing to recover wages you lost because 
you were fired. You can also seek to be reinstated to your job. If you are successful with this lawsuit, you cannot 
recover more than 6 weeks wages and attorney fees. 

Based on your most recent paycheck, the person who pays you estimates that       $ _____ will be withheld 

from each paycheck that is subject to garnishment.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
