      <pre>1.  General Information 

  Use this guide if you want to seal your conviction records within a single case. 

  If you want to seal convictions from multiple cases within the same Judicial District, use JDF 640 

– How to Seal Multiple Convictions instead. 

  If denied, a person may file once every twelve-months unless otherwise ordered by the Court. 

  If you have been convicted of more than one offense in a single case, the conviction records may 

be sealed only if the records of every conviction resulting from the case may be sealed. 

  The Court will not seal the records if you still owe restitution. 

  An Order sealing a conviction record does not vacate the conviction. 

  If you obtain a new conviction, the Court will unseal the records. 

  The government may still use sealed conviction records for any lawful purpose within the scope 
of its duties.  A party or agency required by law to conduct a criminal history record check is 
authorized to use any sealed conviction for the lawful purpose for which the criminal history 
record check is required by law.  

  Note that conviction records are not physically destroyed.  C.R.S. § 24-72-703(4). 

  Once sealed, you and all criminal justice agencies may properly respond that public criminal 

records do not exist with respect to the defendant. 

  For additional information, please review C.R.S. §§ 24-72-703, 24-72-706, and 24-72-707.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
