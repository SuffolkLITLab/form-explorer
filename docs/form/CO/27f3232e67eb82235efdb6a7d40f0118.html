How to 
Modify Child Support 

These standard instructions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice about your 
case.  If you choose to represent yourself, you are bound by the same rules and procedures as an attorney. 

.  General Information 

◆ 

◆ 

◆ 

◆ 
◆ 

Use these instructions if you already have obtained a Court order for Child Support and want 
to modify the amount (either to increase or decrease the amount  paid). 
Child support is calculated under statutory guidelines. If there has been a “substantial and 
continuing” change in circumstances, then you may file for a modification.  The change in 
circumstances must amount to a 10% increase or decrease in the current child support order. 
Two examples of situations that may cause substantial and continuing change are: 
➢  a permanent, significant increase or decrease in the income of either party; and 
➢ 

the emancipation of a child when support is ordered for two or more children. If you are 
paying child support for only one child who is currently emancipated and you wish to 
terminate child support, please complete the Motion to Terminate Child Support (JDF 
1408). 

You may also file for a modification if your current order does not contain a provision 
regarding medical/dental support, such as insurance coverage, payment for medical/dental 
insurance deductibles and co-payments, or unreimbursed medical/dental expenses. 
Added expenses (such as a new car, house, etc.) do not qualify for a modification. 
If the child support is modified, the change can be applied retroactively to the date of the filing 
of the Motion. 

◆  Within 49 days of the date your Motion is filed, the Court will review the matter and determine 
whether the case will be scheduled and resolved under the provisions of Colorado Rule of 
Civil Procedure 16.2(c) or will be handled based on the documents provided with no hearing. 
For additional information, please review Colorado Revised Statute § 14-10-122. 
If you have a disability and need a reasonable accommodation to access the courts, please 
contact your local ADA Coordinator. Contact information can be obtained from the following 
website: http://www.courts.state.co.us/Administration/HR/ADA/Coordinator_List.cfm

5.  Steps 

Selecting these instructions indicates that you are planning to file a motion or stipulation to modify 
child support.  You must identify yourself as the Petitioner or Co-Petitioner/Respondent depending 
on your “title/role” in the original case.  It is important to remember that your “title/role” in the case 
does not change based on who files to reopen a case. 

Pick Option 1 (pg. 3) or Option 2 (pg. 4) below.  Complete the remaining steps. 

Option 1 – Stipulation to Modify Child Support 

You have an existing child support order.  Both parties agree that a change to the child support 
is needed and you agree on the new amount. 

Step 1:  Complete Forms 

❑  Required: any document filed with the Court must also be mailed to every party in the case 

and the County Office of Child Support Services, if they are involved. 

❑  Stipulation Regarding Child Support Modification (JDF 1404): 

❑  Please complete all sections of this form. 
❑  Please provide current addresses and contact information for all parties. 

❑  Sworn Financial Statement (JDF 1111): 

You must provide true and complete information to the Court about your assets, debts, and 
income.  You can be assessed a fine or jailed for providing false information.  In addition, 
your case can be reopened due to fraud. 

❑ 

❑ 

The Financial Statement must contain current personal and financial information to 
determine whether the modification of child support is fair to each party.  Failure of a 
party to file a Financial Statement may result in a refusal by the Court to enter an Order 
to Modify Child Support.  The Court may impose sanctions against the party who does 
not file the required paperwork.  Complete and file with the Court a Supporting 
Schedules for Assets (JDF 1111SS) only if applicable to your case. 

Each party must complete their own Financial Statement and all sections must be 
completed. 

❑  Child Support Worksheet: 

Use the information from each of your Sworn Financial Statements to complete the 
appropriate worksheet. 

❑  Automatic Calculation Option: (Most Common)

Calculate” in the column on the left.  Then click on the “Access the Family Law 
Software” link.

adequacy of child support order negotiated by the parties as well as the financial affidavits.

assignment to reflect that change.

to Modify Child Support was served on the other party.

from the other party. 

❑  Automatic Calculation Option: (Most Common) 

Visit http://www.courts.state.co.us/Forms/family, click on “Child Support – 
Calculate” in the column on the left.  Then click on the “Access the Family Law 
Software” link. 

❑  Complete a Certificate of Service (JDF 1313) indicating that you have provided the

Step 2: 

File your Motion 

Pay the $105.00 filing fee, if  applicable. 

❑ 
❑ 

❑ 

❑ 

❑ 

❑ 

❑ 

Provide the Court with the Motion to Modify Child Support and all other appropriate 
documents. 

You do not need to file your Child Support Worksheet when you file your Motion to Modify 
Child Support if you do not have financial information from the other party.  However, you will 
need to complete the Child Support Worksheet and file it with the Court once you have 
received financial information from the other party. 

If your address has changed since you originally filed your case, please provide your 
current address to the Court in writing. 

Step 3: 

Send a Copy 

You must provide a copy of the Motion to Modify Child Support to all parties to the case. 

❑ 
❑  Complete the Certificate of Service portion on the form.  Without a complete certificate of 

service, your request may be rejected.  The Court must have knowledge that all parties 
involved are aware of the case.  If the Department of Human Services – Office of Child 
Support Services is involved with your case, provide a copy of the Motion to them as well. 

Step 4: 

Court Review of Motion or Hearing 

Within 49 days of the date a post-decree matter is filed, the Court will review the matter and 
determine whether the motion will be approved or not. 

The Judge or Magistrate will review the documents and enter an Order.  The Court may also 
send out a Case Management Order that explains the financial information that must be 
exchanged between the parties and filed with the Court. 

Or 

The Court may set the case for a hearing at which time both parties will have the opportunity 
to appear and make statements to the Court.  The Court may also require parties attend 
mediation or a status conference before the hearing date. 

If child support is modified, you will also receive an updated Support Order. 

Remember: 

if you change the child support amount, you must also modify any income 
assignment to reflect that change.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
