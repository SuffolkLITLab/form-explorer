rustic bed and breakfast to stay the night. TR (June 15, 2015), p 37:11. She 

thought the Brown-Bears’ cabin was a business because it was very large, didn’t 

have a fence or private property sign, and had a “WELCOME” mat. TR (June 

15, 2015), p 37:13. She also stated that she thought they provided food to 

guests because there was a huge garden with vegetables, large amounts of jarred 

berries and salmon, and several moose were stacked up on all of the shelves in 

the kitchen. TR (June 15, 2015), p 37:14. She testified that she looked for

awarded the Brown-Bears $40,000 in damages. CF, p 357. 

On July 16, 2015, Goldilocks filed this appeal. 

The District Court made three errors in the case. First, it found that 

Goldilocks was trespassing. However, Goldilocks had implied consent to enter 

the Brown-Bears’ cabin. Therefore, she was not trespassing.

Court of Appeals may not trust your arguments if you ignore relevant facts just because they don’t work in 

 

your favor.

6.  Argument Summary16 

The District Court also erred in determining that Goldilocks’s actions 

were outrageous. Outrageous conduct is needed for her to be liable17 for 

intentional infliction of emotional distress. Colorado Courts have ruled that 

actions much worse than those involved in this case did not meet the definition 

of outrageous conduct.  

Finally, the District Court was wrong to award damages when 

Goldilocks was not liable for trespass or intentional infliction of emotional 

Issue 1 - Finding of Trespass18 

A. 

Standard of Review: 19 

Determining if a party had consent to be on someone else’s 

property is factual question. Corder v. Folds, 292 P.3d 1177, 1181 (Colo. 

App. 2012). This issue on appeal asks whether or not Goldilocks had

18 Each issue on appeal gets its own separate section. This makes each issue easy for the Court of Appeals to 

19 Each issue must have a Standard of Review section. The standard of review is the measuring tool that the 

Court of Appeals uses to determine whether the District Court made an error that must be reversed. 

Different types of errors may have different standards of review.

consent to be on the Brown-Bear’s property, and is therefore a factual 

finding. An appellate court may set aside a trial court’s findings of fact 

only if they are clearly erroneous. C.R.C.P. 52. Therefore, this issue 

should be reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard of review.20 

Goldilocks raised the defense of implied consent in her Answer to 

the Complaint and during the trial. CF, p 7 and TR (June 16, 2015), p 

41-47. The District Court ruled on this issue in its Final Order. CF, p 

B. 

Preservation: 21 

353. 

C.  Discussion: 

20 “Clearly Erroneous” is a standard of review that requires the Court of Appeals to accept the District 

Court’s findings of fact unless they are clearly wrong (erroneous). Facts are clearly erroneous if there is no 

 

evidence in the record to support them. 

21 Usually issues must have been raised in the District Court, first, before they can be raised on appeal. For 
example, here, Goldilocks argued during the trial that she had implied consent to enter the Brown-Bears’ 
cabin. Therefore, the District Court had an opportunity to consider this argument before the appeal. In civil 

cases, the Court of Appeals may not review an issue if the District Court never had an opportunity to

Page 10 

DF 1987  –  Sample Opening Brief 

  J

consider and rule on it. 

The District Court erred in finding that Goldilocks trespassed on 

the Brown-Bears’ property. Goldilocks was not trespassing because she 

had implied consent to enter the Brown-Bears’ cabin.22 

A person is trespassing if they enter someone’s land without 

permission.23 § 13-21-115 (5)(c), C.R.S. 2015; Hoery v. United States, 64 

P.3d 214, 217 (Colo. 2003); Betterview Investments, LLC v. Public Service Co., 

198 P.3d 1258, 1262 (Colo. App. 2008).24 However, landowners may give 

express or implied consent for someone to be on their property by 

request, expectation, or intent. Corder v. Folds, 292 P.3d 1177, 1181 (Colo. 

App. 2012) (holding that a neighbor did not need express consent to 

22 The Discussion section begins with an introductory sentence that explains what will be discussed in the 

 

other paragraphs of the section. 

23 This paragraph informs the Court of Appeals of what the law is on this issue. In this case, it is Colorado 

law regarding trespass and implied consent. 

24 Note that after every statement of law, there is a citation to a case, statute, or other law that supports the

  J

statement. 

enter the property).25 A landowner may consent to entry by his or her 

course of conduct without words of consent spoken. Id.26  

Goldilocks thought that the Brown Bears’ cabin was a bed and 

breakfast.27 TR (June 15, 2015), p 37:11. Although her assumptions are 

not a legal defense, they reinforce her argument that she had implied 

consent to enter the cabin. The “WELCOME” mat was out in front of 

the door, the door was open, there was food on the table, and there were 

many beds and chairs in the cabin. TR (June 15, 2015), p 37:11-13.  

These facts indicated that the Brown-Bears were prepared for the 

arrival of several people.28 In addition, the facts support Goldilocks’s 

belief that this was a boarding house and there was no reason for her not 

to enter. At least, the Brown-Bears made it appear ready for an “open 

house.” The Brown-Bears’ welcoming decorations and accommodations

what that case is about. This may be especially helpful if the facts or the legal issues of the case are similar to 

 

your own case. 

page, cite it as “Id. at 4.” 

26 “Id.” is short for idem, which is Latin for “same.” You may use Id. if the citation for that sentence is exactly 

the same as the previous citation in your brief. If the source is the same, but you are referring to a different 

27 This next part of your argument restates the facts that are important for this issue. Note that every fact was 

also stated with its citation to the record in the Statement of the Case section. A citation to the record must 

be provided for every new fact.

implied people were expected or intended to enter and remain in their 

home.29  

There were no indications the cabin was closed, off-limits to 

outsiders, or limited to who could enter.  There is no evidence to 

support a finding that Goldilocks’s entry was wrongful.30  

Because the facts support a finding of implied consent and none 

of the facts support a finding of trespass, the District Court’s finding 

that Goldilocks had committed trespass was clearly erroneous. The 

Court of Appeals should reverse this finding.31  

Issue 2 – Finding of Outrageous Conduct 

A. 

Standard of Review: 32 

Outrageous conduct is a determined by the facts. Culpepper v. Pearl 

St. Bldg., Inc., 877 P.2d 877, 883 (Colo. 1994). The Court of Appeals must 

29 This final sentence brings the reader back to the introductory sentence. 

 

30 The Court of Appeals may only reverse a case for error if the standard of review has been met. Because a 

“clearly erroneous” standard of review applies here, the writer will have to show that the District Court’s 

finding is not supported by the record. 

31 Here, the writer ties in the standard of review and concludes the argument with how the Court of Appeals 

should decide the issue. 

32 Again, each issue gets its own Standard of Review section. 

R: July 12, 2021

  J

accept the District Court’s findings of fact in a civil case unless they are 

clearly erroneous. C.R.C.P. 52.  

B. 

Preservation: 

This issue was preserved by Goldilocks at trial. TR (June 16, 

2015), p 47-57, and by the District Court’s final order.33 CF, p 357.  

C.  Discussion: 

The District Court erred in finding that Goldilocks’s conduct was 

outrageous. Her actions fall below the standard of outrageous conduct, 

and therefore the Brown-Bears’ claim of intentional infliction of 

emotional distress fails.34  

A person is liable when his or her extreme and outrageous 

conduct intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress in 

another. Culpepper v. Pearl St. Bldg., Inc., 877 P.2d 877, 882 (Colo. 1994). 

There are three elements to establish intentional infliction of emotional 

distress: (1) the defendant engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct; 

(2), the defendant engaged in the conduct recklessly or with the intent of 

33 In this case, outrageous conduct was a key element to one of the claims that was resolved by the District 

 

Court in the final order. 

34 The first paragraph introduces the discussion on this issue. 

R: July 12, 2021 

Page 14 

DF 1987  –  Sample Opening Brief 

  J

causing the plaintiff severe emotional distress; and (3), the plaintiff 

incurred severe emotional distress. Rugg v. McCarty, 476 P.2d 753, 756 

(Colo. 1970).35 

To establish the first element, the conduct must be extreme or 

outrageous. For conduct to rise to the level of extreme or outrageous, it 

must be “so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go 

beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, 

and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.” Destefano v. Grabrian, 

763 P.2d 275, 286 (Colo. 1988).36 

No facts in this case show that Goldilocks’s conduct meets the 

definition of extreme or outrageous. Goldilocks entered the Brown-

Bears’ cabin believing it was a place to stay for the night. TR (June 15, 

2015), p 37:17. She fell asleep on the couch waiting for someone to get 

her a room for the night. Id. These actions do not go beyond all possible 

bounds of decency. Although her actions were an unfortunate and 

awkward mistake, they certainly are not atrocious or intolerable.37 

35 The next paragraph states the law that applies to this issue. 

 

36 Some claims require that different criteria or elements be proven for a person to be liable. The writer may 

focus on any one or all of the elements and will explain the law involving each element discussed.  

37 This part discusses the facts that are important for the “outrageous conduct” element. The next part will 

apply those facts to the law stated above.

infliction of emotional distress cases. Compare Destefano (finding that a 

priest who was providing marriage counseling to a man while having 

intimate relations with that man’s wife did not engage in outrageous 

conduct); and Culpepper (holding that the accidental partial cremation of a 

body, such that a cause of death could not be determined, was not 

outrageous conduct by the morgue).38  

No facts on the record show outrageous conduct on the part of 

Goldilocks. Therefore, the District Court’s finding that there was 

outrageous conduct is clearly erroneous. Goldilocks is not liable under 

an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim without establishing 

the first element of outrageous conduct. The Court of Appeals should 

reverse this finding.  

 

38 One argument style is to compare your case with another that has similar facts or is based on similar law. 

 

You could then argue that: 

1.  Your case is different and should be decided differently. Or, 

2.  Your case is the similar enough that it should have the same result. Or,  

3.  As in the Brown-Bears’ case, other cases that courts have decided are much worse/better/more 

complicated. And because no outrageous conduct was found in those cases, then this case 

should have that result.

Issue 3 – Excessive Damages 

A. 

Standard of Review: 

Damages may only be reversed if there is a clear abuse of 

discretion.39 Leo Payne Pontiac, Inc. v. Ratliff, 497 P.2d 997, 999 (Colo. 

1970). 

B. 

Preservation: 

Court’s final order. CF, p 358. 

C.  Discussion: 

This issue is preserved by the District Court’s final order. CF, p 

358.B. Preservation on Appeal: This issue is preserved by the District 

The $40,000 in damages awarded to the Brown-Bears was 

excessive. As stated above under issues 1 and 2, Goldilocks did not 

trespass and she did not intentionally inflict emotional distress on Baby 

Brown-Bear. Because Goldilocks is not liable under any claim, the 

 

39 Abuse of Discretion is another standard of review. This standard applies when the District Court may 

choose more than one way to make a decision. To meet this standard, you would have to show that the 

Court’s decision wasn’t among the possible reasonable decisions it could have made.

District Court Judge abused her discretion in awarding damages. The 

Court of Appeals should reverse the judgment. 

However, even assuming Goldilocks is liable for trespass,40 the 

damage award is too high. A plaintiff may recover nominal damages 

when the trespass is intentional, even if there are no actual damages. 

Sanderson v. Heath Mesa Homeowners Ass’n, 183 P.3d 679, 684 (Colo. App. 

2008).  

First, there is no evidence that the the Brown-Bears suffered 

$40,000 in actual damages to their property. The Brown-Bears claim that 

Goldilocks may have eaten a half a bowl of blue berries. CF, p 1. Even 

in that case, no evidence was presented about the blueberries or the 

value of those blueberries.  

Without actual damages, the District Court should have awarded 

only nominal damages to the Brown-Bears for the trespass. An award of 

$40,000 is well beyond nominal, and a clear abuse of discretion. See 

Crawford v. French, 633 P.2d 524, 527 (Colo. App. 1981) (reversing 

40 This is another argument style. The writer argues that even if the Court of Appeals disagrees with one point 

of my argument, it should still rule in my favor on this other point.

damages of $678 for trespass, because damages should only be 

nominal).41  

The Court of Appeals should reverse the judgment because the 

District Court abused its discretion in awarding damages if Goldilocks is 

found liable for trespass.  

8.  Conclusion42 

For the reasons stated above, the Court of Appeals should reverse the 

District Court’s findings that Goldilocks trespassed on the Brown-Bears’ 

property and intentionally inflicted emotional distress on Baby Bear. This Court 

should also reverse the damages award.

41 This is another example of a short sentence after the citation that explains how the case cited is relevant in 

supporting the writer’s argument. Here, the argument is that if a $678 award was reversed as not nominal, 

then the Brown-Bears’ $40,000 judgment should definitely be reversed. 

42 The Conclusion section should include a statement of what you want the Court of Appeals to do.
