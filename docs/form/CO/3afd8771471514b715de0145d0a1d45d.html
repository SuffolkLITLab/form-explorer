OSSIBLE OUTCOMES FROM YOUR COURT HEARING 

❑  If the Plaintiff and Defendant appear, then one of the following situations may occur: 

1.  The  Plaintiff  and  the  Defendant  can  agree  to  talk  and  work  out  certain  agreeable  conditions  that  could 
include the payment of the claim, a payment plan, etc. This is called a Stipulation. The Stipulation form 
(JDF 75) may be purchased from the clerk’s office or you may bring one with you to Court.  
❑  If  a  stipulation  is  reached,  an  Order  re:  Stipulation  (JDF  106)  must  be  filed  with  the  Court  with  the 
Stipulation.  Complete the caption only on the form.  The Court will complete the  remaining sections 
on the form and give you a signed copy.    

2.  The Defendant can file an answer contesting the claim of the Plaintiff any time after being served, up to 
and including the first court date/return date.  The purpose of the answer is for the Defendant to respond 
to the allegations in the complaint and to state any claims against the Plaintiff that the Defendant might 
have. The Defendant may file an answer on the court date as an opportunity to discuss the issues with 
the  Plaintiff  or  his/her  attorney  in  the  courtroom  before  the  case  proceeds.  All  filing  fees  paid  are  non-
refundable and must be paid when filing the answer or counterclaim. 

3.  The Plaintiff can continue the return date if the Plaintiff feels that further discussion with the Defendant is 

necessary or if the Defendant is given another opportunity to fulfill a pre-arranged agreement. 

4.  A Court or Jury Trial can be requested and set for a future date.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
