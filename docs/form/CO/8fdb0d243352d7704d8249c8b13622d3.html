      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS TO FILE FOR GRANDPARENT OR GREAT-
GRANDPARENT VISITATION 

These standard instructions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice 
about your case.  If you choose to represent yourself, you are bound by the same rules and procedures 
as an attorney. 
 

ENERAL INFORMATION  

  This information provides a guide to the forms necessary to file for grandparent or great-grandparent 

visitation.   

  A  grandparent  or  great-grandparent  of  a  child  might  be  eligible  to  obtain  reasonable  visitation 
rights when: (i) there is or has been judicial intervention into the marriage or civil union of the child’s 
parents; (ii) there is or has been a judicial placement of the child outside the family; or (iii) there has 
been  a  death  of  the  grandparent’s  child  or  the  great-grandparent’s  grandchild.    A  grandparent  or 
great-grandparent may seek a visitation order from the court in the following cases: 

1.  Where  the  child’s  parents  have  a  Domestic  Relations  (DR)  Case  that  involves  a  Dissolution  of 
Marriage  or  Civil  Union,  Legal  Separation  (Marriage  or  Civil  Union),  Allocation  of  Parental 
Responsibilities or Invalidity of Marriage or Civil Union (Annulment). 

2.  Where  the  child  is  the  subject  of  a  Juvenile  (JV)  case  that  involves  the  Allocation  of  Parental 

Responsibilities or determination of paternity. 

3. 

If the child is the subject of a Juvenile (JV) case that involves Dependency and Neglect and the 
child has been placed outside of and does not reside in the home of the child’s parent.   

4.  Where  the  child’s  parent  who  is  the  child  of  the  grandparent  or  the  grandchild  of  the  great-
grandparent  seeking  visitation  has  died  and  a  Probate  (PR)  guardianship  case  is  pending  or 
closed.  

5.  Where  the  child’s  parent  who  is  the  child  of  the  grandparent  or  the  grandchild  of  the  great-
grandparent seeking visitation has died and a Probate (PR) decedent’s estate case is pending or 
closed, or where no Probate case exists.  In these situations, the Pleading Affidavit must be filed 
in a new Juvenile (JV) action. 

1. 

2. 

3. 

  A grandparent or great-grandparent of a child might not be eligible to obtain visitation rights if the 
following  circumstances  exist,  unless  the  child’s  parent  who  is  the  child  of  the  grandparent  or  the 
grandchild of the great-grandparent has died: 

If parental rights of the child’s parents have been terminated. 

If the child has been placed for adoption or the adoption has been legally finalized. 

If the parents of the child have not participated in a Domestic Relations, Juvenile or Probate case 
as identified in numbers 1 – 3 above.  

  The grandparent(s) or great-grandparent(s) can file either a Motion to Intervene pursuant to Rule 24 
of  the  Colorado  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  in  an  already  existing  case  or  they  can  file  a  Pleading 
Affidavit  to request grandparent  or great-grandparent visitation in a new Juvenile (JV) action where 
the child’s parent, who is the child of the grandparent or grandchild of the great-grandparent seeking 
visitation, has died.   

1.  Where  there  is  an  existing  case  (see  numbers  1-4  above):  The  Motion  to  Intervene  for 
Grandparent or Great-Grandparent Visitation must be filed in the county where the child resides.  
This must be followed even in the situation where the original case involving the child was filed in 
a different county than where the child currently lives.  

a. 

If the original DR, JV or PR case involving the child is in a different county, you will need 
to file a Motion to Intervene along with a Motion for Change of Venue in the county where

the original case is.  Once the Court issues an Order for Change of Venue, you can file 
the  Order  along  with  the  Pleading  Affidavit  for  Grandparent  or  Great-Grandparent 
Visitation in the county where the child resides.  

b. 

If Colorado does not have the original case, you may need to file in the originating court.  
This is the court that has child custody jurisdiction.  If this situation applies to you consult 
an attorney to assist with the filing of the documents.      

2.  Where  an  Estate  Case  is  pending,  closed  or  no  case  exists  (see  number  5  above):  The 
Pleading  Affidavit  for  Grandparent  or  Great-Grandparent  Visitation  must  be  filed  in  a  new  Juvenile 
action in the county where the child resides.   

  No  grandparent  or  great-grandparent  may  seek  an  order  granting  visitation  rights  more  than  once 

every two years, without court approval.  

  If there are matters or issues that you and the other parties cannot resolve, mediation or other forms 
of  alternative  dispute  resolution  may  be  an  option.  For  more  information,  call  the  State  Office  of 
Dispute  Resolution  at  (720)  625-5940  or  check  with  your  local  Court  to  obtain  information  on  local 
mediators.  

  Review the statute on this subject matter, see §19-1-117, C.R.S.     

  If you have a disability and need a reasonable accommodation to access the courts, please contact 

your local ADA Coordinator. Contact information can be obtained from the following website:

Step 2: 

You are Ready to File your Documents with the Court.   

  Pay the Intervenor filing fee of $234.00, if applicable.  
  The  Motion  to  Intervene  will  be  filed  in  the  existing  (JV,  PR  –  Guardianship  action,  DR)  case 

related to the child.   

  If  you  are  filing  a  Motion  to  Intervene  and  there  is  an  existing  Paternity  or  Dependency  and 
Neglect case, a new Juvenile (JV) case will be established, since such cases are confidential and 
considered a non-public case.

Service  is  to  notify  the  Court  when  and  how  you  provided  copies  of  the  Motion  and  Pleading 
Affidavit to all parties in the case. This is very important, because the Court must have knowledge 
that all parties involved are aware of the Motion to Intervene and the Pleading Affidavit regarding 
grandparent/great-grandparent visitation prior to any Court action being taken. 

 

Court Review of Motion to Intervene. 

Step 4:

Intervene and enter an Order as appropriate.

county where the original case is located.  Once the Court issues an Order for Change of Venue

best interests of the child. If you believe a hearing is necessary, please check with the Court to determine 
what their procedures are for the setting of a hearing. 

  The Judge or Magistrate will review the Pleading Affidavit for Grandparent or Great-Grandparent 

Visitation and enter an Order as appropriate.

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
