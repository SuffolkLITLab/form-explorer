A filing fee of $ 167.00 is required for each adoption.  However, if the Petitioner is seeking to adopt more than one 
child,  and  the  circumstances/availability  for  the  children  to  be  adopted  are  the  same  (e.g.  the  children  are

STEPS TO FILING YOUR CASE

Complete the required fingerprint-based criminal history record checks. 

The prospective adoptive parent must submit a fingerprint-based criminal history record check from the Colorado 
Bureau  of  Investigation  (CBI)  and  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  (FBI)  at  the  time  the  Petition  is  filed.  Please 
follow these steps:  

❑  Law  enforcement  agencies  are  no  longer  required  to  provide  fingerprinting  for  civil  cases.  Some  law 
enforcement agencies will refer you to Colorado Application Background Services (CABS). Below is a link 
to  the  Colorado  Bureau  of  Investigations  website  which  includes  information  and  instructions  sorted  by 
category: 
https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cbi/employment-background-checks 

❑  The criminal history results must be conducted within 90 days prior to the filing of the Petition.   
❑  If you have a felony conviction recorded in Colorado or any other state, and you know that it is inaccurate, 
it is your responsibility to obtain the disposition information from the court where such action occurred as 
identified in the CBI and FBI reports. 

❑  You  are  also  responsible  for  providing  certified  copies  of  any  criminal  dispositions  that  are  not 
reflected in the Colorado Bureau of Investigations or Federal Bureau of Investigation records and 
any  other  dispositions  which  are  unknown,  by  contacting  the  agency  where  such  actions 
occurred.  

tep 2: 

Complete TRAILS Background Check. 

Information  to  complete  this  background  check  can  be  found  at  the  Colorado  Department  Human  Services 
(CDHS) website.  The fee for this background check is payable to CDHS.  This is not a JDF form.  Please use the 
following link to access information about obtaining a TRAILS background check.
