FIRST APPEARANCE 
It is important that you are on time or early for your Return Date and that you have all of your information with you.  
Please turn off your cell phone and respect all parties in the courtroom.  The following may occur at the hearing:   
 
If the defendant disputes they are an unauthorized person, they may appear at the hearing and provide  
testimony and other evidence that they are not an unauthorized person. The court, in its discretion, may  
accept a written statement prior to the hearing in place of testimony from the defendant.  
If no person identified in the motion as an unauthorized person appears at the hearing, and no written  
statement is filed in opposition of the motion; the court may proceed to rule on the motion based on the  
contents of the motion and any additional testimony that you provide.  
After the court hears testimony or after considering the motion, the court will determine  
whether the defendant is an unauthorized person and the court may enter an order for a Temporary  
Mandatory Injunction and issue a Writ of Restitution.  
If the court enters an Order for Temporary Mandatory Injunction and issues a Writ of Restitution, you may  
deliver the order to the Sherriff having jurisdiction to enforce the order. No later than 24 hours after receipt 
of  the  Temporary  Mandatory  Injunction,  a  Sherriff,  Undersheriff,  or  Deputy  Sheriff  shall  remove  the 
unauthorized person from the residential premises and order them to remain off the residential premises or 
be subject to criminal trespass.  
If your motion filed with the court includes a statement that the property has been altered or damaged or  
the Sherriff, Undersheriff, or Deputy Sheriff sees evidence that the property has been altered or 
damaged, the Sherriff, Undersheriff, or Deputy Sheriff shall collect personal information from the person 
or persons and provide that information to you.  
If the court determines that the defendant is not an unauthorized person, the court will deny the Motion for  
Temporary Mandatory Injunction.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
