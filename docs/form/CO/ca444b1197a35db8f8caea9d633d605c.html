These standard instructions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice about

ENERAL INFORMATION  

◆  A conservatorship may be terminated under the following circumstances. 

1.  The Protected Person attains the age of 21 years. 
2.  The death of the Protected Person.  
3.  The Protected Person’s inability to manage property or business affairs has been resolved. 
4.  The assets of the conservatorship are insufficient to warrant continued administration.  

◆  If funds of the Minor were ordered to be placed in a restricted account and no other assets exist and the minor 

is now 21, the filing of a Petition to Terminate a Conservatorship may not be necessary.    

◆  The  Protected  Person  seeking  termination  is  entitled  to  the  same  rights  and  procedures  as  in  an  original 

proceeding for a protective order. 

◆  Upon receiving an Order terminating the conservatorship or  upon receiving  notice of the death  of a protected 
person, the Conservator shall conclude the administration of the conservatorship by filing a Conservator’s Final 
Report (JDF 885), receipt  and release forms, and a  proposed  Decree of Final  Discharge  within  63  days  after 
distribution, unless otherwise directed by the Court.

Provide the  Court  with the  documents completed as described in  Step  1 above.    You may set this matter on the 
non-appearance  docket.    If  you  are  requesting  to  terminate  the  conservatorship,  because  it  is  believed  that  the

required to notify regarding the termination of the conservatorship. 

  You may request to have an evidentiary hearing.  You may receive a hearing date from the clerk at the time of 
filing the Petition.  The date and time of this hearing is important because you will need to complete the Notice 
of Hearing form (JDF 806), see Step 3.     

tep 3: 
 

Send Copies of all Documents Filed with the Court and the Notice of Hearing 
(JDF 806) to Interested Persons.

you may need to make several copies of the documents filed with the Court.    

DF 806 must also be provided to the Protected Person unless he/she  or their successor has signed JDF 

❑  Mail copies of all documents (including the Petition for Termination and Conservator’s Report) filed with the 
Court  and  the  completed  Notice  of  Hearing  to  Interested  Persons  (JDF  806)  at  least  14  days  before  the 
hearing.  

❑  Complete  the  Certificate  of  Service  portion  on  the  form.    List  the  names  and  addresses  of  all  interested

and should be prepared to present evidence showing why the conservatorship should be terminated.

❑  Copies of the Order must be provided to all interested persons identified in the Order.   

❑  Upon receiving an Order, the Conservator shall conclude the administration of the conservatorship. 

tep 5:

the Court for the Conservator’s discharge.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
