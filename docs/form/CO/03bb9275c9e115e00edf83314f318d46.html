      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS TO DISCLAIM PATERNITY  

These standard instructions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice about 
your case.  If you choose to represent yourself, you are bound by the same rules and procedures as an 
attorney.  When you file your case the Court may provide you with a Case Management Order and other 
information about the procedures to be followed.  Please review that information carefully. 

ENERAL INFORMATION 

  This  information  provides  a  guide  to  using  the  forms  necessary  to  file  a  case  to  disclaim  paternity.    Each 
judicial district may have special requirements. You should contact the Court where you plan to file to find out 
about any special requirements the Court may have. 

u  As provided by §19-4-107, C.R.S., legal action may be taken to declare the non-existence of (disclaim) the 
parent-child relationship within a reasonable time after obtaining knowledge of relevant facts but no later than 
five years after the child’s birth. If you are seeking to establish paternity, please see the specific instructions 
(JDF 1500).  

u  The  case  should  be  filed  in  the  county  where  the  child  or  the  alleged  father  resides  or  is  found,  or  in  any 
county where public assistance was or is being paid on behalf of the child.  If the alleged father is deceased, 
the case should be filed in any county in which proceedings for probate have been or could be filed.  

u  The  party  filing  the  case  must  disclose  any  restraining/protection  or  emergency  orders  entered  by  a  Court 

against either party within 90 days prior to the filing of a paternity case. 

u  An  automatic  temporary  injunction  will  be  in  effect  upon  service  of  the  Petition  and  Summons  on  the 
Respondent, or upon the signing of a Waiver and Acceptance of Service by the Respondent. The temporary 
injunction will be in effect for 120 days after its effective date unless all parties consent to a modification of the 
temporary  injunction.  The  Court  may,  upon  the  motion  of  a  party  or  on  its  own  motion,  modify  the  time  the 
temporary injunction is in place.    

u  For additional information, please review §19-4-107 of the Colorado Children’s Code. 
u  If you have a disability and need a reasonable accommodation to access the courts, please contact your local 

ADA Coordinator. Contact information can be obtained from the following website:

Step 1:  Complete Appropriate Genetic Testing Forms  
The  Petitioner  or  Respondent  has  the  right  to  ask  the  Court  to  order  genetic  testing  on  all  parties.    It  is  the 
responsibility of the person requesting the tests to prepare the forms.  If there is agreement among the parties, 
prepare  JDF  1506,  Agreement  of  Genetic  Testing.    If  one  of  the  parties  does  not  agree,  prepare  JDF  1505, 
Motion  for  Genetic  Testing.    It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  party  completing  JDF  1505  or  JDF  1506  to  contact  a 
court-approved testing agency to schedule the date and time for the collection of the genetic specimens. The fee 
for  the  test  is  the  responsibility  of  the  parties  being  tested  and  should  be  paid  to  the  agency  at  the  time  of  the 
test(s). The price of genetic testing varies with each lab.  
 

q  Helpful  hints  to  locate  a  laboratory  that  performs  either  HLA  or  DNA  testing.    There  are  a  number  of 
national  laboratories  that  perform  this  service.  You  can  locate  a  laboratory  in  the  yellow  pages  under 
Paternity.  

  Questions to ask the lab when contacting to schedule an appointment.

ü  Cost for genetic testing, per person and total cost. 
ü  Address for the Lab, as you will need the complete address when completing the forms. 
ü  Identification required for the parties completing the tests. 

 

 

q  If  you  are  filing  a  Motion  with  the  Court  to  order  genetic  testing,  make  sure  you  schedule  the  testing  a 
month out. Once you have scheduled a date and time for the lab test, you are ready to complete and file 
the appropriate motion and order as described below. If you think the Respondent will not agree to the 
genetic tests, complete the motion and order forms under number 2 below.

finding that you or the other party is not biological father.  

q  If  the  genetic  testing  identifies  the  Petitioner/Respondent  to  be  the  biological  Father,  you  or  the 
Respondent may want to review the Instructions for Allocation of Parental Responsibilities (JDF 1413I) to 
address parenting time, decision-making responsibility, child support, and other financial issues, if any.
