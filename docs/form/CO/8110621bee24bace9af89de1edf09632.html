f the person doing your service cannot serve the Defendant(s) personally, the papers should be posted on the door to 
the  main  entrance  of  the  dwelling  or  other  conspicuous  place  upon  the  premises.    The  Court  will  only  award  you 
possession and not money damages if you post and mail the Summons.  A monetary award may be granted only if there 
has been personal service of process on the Defendant(s) and/or the Plaintiff(s). 

ersonal Service: 

 

Select either the Sheriff’s Department, a private process server, or someone you know who is 18 years or older and 
not a party to the action and who knows the rules of service to serve the Defendant. There is a service fee that is 
payable to the Sheriff’s Department or Private Process Server.  The fee for service is usually awarded as part of 
your court costs if the court rules in your favor. 

❑  You can locate private process servers in the yellow pages or on the internet under Process Servers. 
❑  Provide the process server with the Affidavit of Service (JDF 98) for each Defendant and two sets of the 

Summons, Complaint, and Answer forms. In addition, attach all appropriate exhibits as described in Step 2. 

❑  The process server will return the original Summons to you with the Affidavit of Service completed.  
❑  Each Defendant must be served at least five business days before the day for appearance specified in the 

Summons. 

ervice by Posting and Mailing: 

 

❑  If personal service cannot be made upon the Defendant(s), the person completing service, i.e. process 

server or Sheriff’s Department, must post the papers on the door to the main entrance or other 
conspicuous place upon the premises. 

❑  No later than the next day following the day you file the Complaint with the Court, you must mail a copy of 

the Summons, Complaint, and Answer to the Defendant(s) by postage prepaid, first class mail. (In addition, 
attach the appropriate exhibits.) 

❑  After you have placed the forms in the mail, complete the certificate of mailing. The certificate of mailing is

paid, first class mail.

of $98.00 is paid.  The clerk may set a hearing between 7 to 14 days from the date that the clerk (or attorney for 
Plaintiff) completes the Summons.  Defendant(s) may be required to post a bond, if the jury trial cannot be set 
within seven days. Upon the filing of the counterclaim, the first hearing date may be vacated and a new hearing 
date set. Both parties must appear on the new date.
