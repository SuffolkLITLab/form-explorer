      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR APPOINTMENT OF A GUARDIAN - MINOR 

These standard instructions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice about 
your case. If you choose to represent yourself, you are bound by the same rules and procedures as an 
attorney. 

GENERAL INFORMATION 

◆  The Minor child must be a resident or be present at the time of the commencement of the proceeding in the 

county in which you are filing the petition. 

◆  The Minor or a person interested in the welfare of the Minor may file the case. 
◆  A name-based criminal history record check from  the Colorado Bureau of Investigation  (CBI) and a current 

◆ 

credit report of the proposed guardian must be filed with the Court. 
If  the  Minor  has  income,  such  as  Supplemental  Security  Income  (SSI)  or  other  significant  income,  or  owns 
assets, such as real estate or stocks, you may need to file for conservatorship in order to manage the money 
or assets. 

◆  The Court may appoint a Guardian for a Minor, if the Court finds the appointment would be in the best interest 

of the Minor and one of these four statements applies: 
1.  The parents’ consent to the appointment. 
2.  The parents’ parental rights have been terminated by a court order. 
3.  The  parents  are  unwilling  or  unable  to  exercise  their  parental  rights.  For  example,  the  parents  are 

deceased, or they have abandoned the child. 

4.  Guardianship of a child has previously been granted to a third party and the third party has subsequently 
died or become incapacitated and the guardian has not made an appointment of a guardian either by will 
or written instrument. 

◆  For additional information, please review §15-14-201 through §15-14-210, C.R.S. 
◆ 

If you have a disability and need a reasonable accommodation to access the courts, please contact your local 
ADA Coordinator. Contact information can be obtained from the following website: 
http://www.courts.state.co.us/Administration/HR/ADA/Coordinator_List.cfm

to the Court. Once you submit the completed JDF 205 form and a blank Order (JDF 206), the Court will decide 
whether you need to pay the filing fee. 

 

 

 

 

 

   

Other fees that a party to the case may encounter are as follows (also see JDF 1):

receive a hearing date from the clerk at the time of filing your paperwork  or  you may need to contact the clerk 
later to obtain the hearing date. The date and time of this hearing is important, as you will need it to complete the 
Notice of Hearing or publication forms described in Step 3 and Step 4.

publication being at least 14 days before the hearing date. 

❑  The Petitioner must request a publisher’s affidavit from the newspaper after publication is completed. 
This publisher’s affidavit, prepared by the newspaper, will serve as proof that the Notice of Hearing by 
Publication  (JDF  716)  was  published.  This  publisher’s  affidavit  must  be  attached  to  the  Affidavit 
Regarding Due Diligence and Proof of Publication (JDF 714). See form identified below.

❑  The Petitioner must sign this form. 

 

Step 4: Hearing. 
The  Petitioner  must  appear  at  the  hearing  and  should  be  prepared  to  present  evidence  as  to  why  the 
Guardianship is in the child's best interest. 

❑  Be  prepared  to  present  evidence  showing  that  the  parents  are  aware  of  the  proceedings  and  that  they 
consent to the Guardianship. If the Petitioner cannot prove that the parents' consent to the Guardianship, 
then he/she must be prepared to present evidence showing that the parents are either unwilling or unable 
to take care of the child or that their parental rights have been terminated. 

❑  If  the  Court  appoints  a  Guardian,  the  Court  will  issue  Letters  (JDF  830)  as  a  formal  notice  of  the 

appointment and provide you with a copy of the Order Appointing Guardian. 
You  may need  certified  copies  of  the  Letters  and  Order.  The  number  needed  will vary,  depending  on

❑  Complete,  sign,  and  file  the  Probate  Case  Information  Sheet  (JDF  705)  with  the  court,  if  you’ve  not 

already done so.  Letters of Appointment will not be issued until this form is filed. 

❑  Refer  to  the  Order  Appointing  Guardian  for  a  Minor  to  determine  if/when  the  annual  report  is  due.  The 
purpose of  the  annual report is to report to the  Court  and interested persons as to the wellbeing  of the 
Minor.  The  Guardian’s  Report  must  be  provided  to  the  persons  listed  in  the  Order  of  Appointment.  A 
guardian shall give notice of the filing of the guardian’s report, together with a copy of the report to those

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
