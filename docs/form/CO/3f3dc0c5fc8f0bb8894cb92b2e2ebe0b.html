e.  Summary of the Argument 

Briefly state the key arguments that you are making for each 

Issue on Appeal. 

•  Don’t simply repeat your Statement of the Issues. 

•  This section is usually no longer than one page. 

f.  Argument 

Argue one issue at a time. 

For each issue, include: 

Standard of Review 

Propose which Standard of Review the Court of Appeals 

should use to review that issue.  Cite the law that 

supports using that Standard of Review. 

DF 1915 i - Opening Brief Instructions (Family Matter | District Civil) 

R: July 12, 2021 

Page 4 of 8 

  J

 

•  The Standard of Review is the measuring tool that the 

Court of Appeals uses to determine whether the 

District Court made an error that must be reversed. 

•  Different types of errors may have different Standards 

of Review. 

Some examples: 

De novo review: The Court of Appeals will decide the 

issue on its own, regardless of what the District Court 

decided. 

•  This standard is usually used for issues of law, such 

as interpreting a statute. 

Clearly Erroneous Review: The Court of Appeals will 

uphold what the District Court decided unless the 

decision was clearly wrong based on the information 

available at the time it was made. 

•  This Standard is usually used for issues of fact such 

as determining a party’s income for child support 

purposes. 

Abuse of Discretion: The Court of Appeals will uphold 

what the District Court decided unless its decision was 

clearly unreasonable, arbitrary, or unfair. 

•  This Standard is usually used when there was 

more than one way for the District Court to 

decide the issue such as deciding what parenting 

time plan is in a child’s best interests.

Preservation 

You must bring an issue to the attention of the District 

Court before the Court of Appeals will consider it on 

appeal.  This is known as preserving the issue for appeal. 

•  Cite to the location in the Record on Appeal where the 

issue was raised with the District Court and where the 

District Court ruled on the issue. 

Discussion 

State your arguments on the issue. 

•  If you do not thoroughly discuss an issue, the Court 

of Appeals will not address that issue in its decision. 

You will choose how the argument is organized and what 

sources to include.  

One Method: 

Introduction:  Introduce the Issue. 

Law:  Cite to the law that supports your argument. 

Facts:  State the facts from the case that are relevant in 

resolving this issue.  Cite to the Record on Appeal where 

those facts can be found. 

Apply the Facts to Law:  Discuss why the Court of 

Appeals must resolve the case in your favor when it 

applies the facts to the law you cited.
