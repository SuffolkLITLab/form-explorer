      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS TO FILE A MOTION TO TERMINATE CHILD SUPPORT 

     

These standard instructions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice about your 
case.  If you choose to represent yourself, you are bound by the same rules and procedures as an attorney. 
 

  For  child  support  orders  entered  on  or  after  July  1,  1997,  unless  a  court  finds  that  a  child  is  otherwise 
emancipated, emancipation occurs and child support terminates when the child attains nineteen years of age 
unless one or more of the following conditions exist: 
➢  The parties agree otherwise in a written stipulation. 
➢ 

If the child is mentally or physically disabled, the court or the delegate child support enforcement unit may 
order child support, including payments for medical expenses or insurance or both, to continue beyond the 
age of nineteen. 
If  the  child  is  still  in  high  school  or  an  equivalent  program,  support  continues  until  the  end  of  the  month 
following  graduation.  A  child  who  ceases  to  attend  high  school  prior  to  graduation  and  later  reenrolls  is 
entitled  to  support  upon  reenrollment  and  until  the  end  of  the  month  following  graduation, but not beyond 
age twenty-one. 

➢ 

  Emancipation  occurs  upon  a  valid  marriage  or  civil  union  of  a  child,  when  a  child  has  moved  from  the  family 
residence  and  is  capable  of  providing  for  his/her  own  care  and  support  with  his/her  own  earnings,  or  as 
determined by the Court. 

  Within 49 days of the date your Motion is filed, the Court will review the matter and determine whether the case 
will  be  scheduled  and  resolved  under  the  provisions  of  Colorado  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  16.2(c)  or  will  be 
handled based on the documents provided with no hearing.  

  The  Obligor  can  provide  copies  of  the  Order  to  Terminate  Child  Support  to  his/her  employer  to  terminate  an 

income assignment. 

  For additional information, please review Colorado Revised Statute §14-10-122. 
 

If you have a disability and need a reasonable accommodation to access the courts, please contact your local 
ADA Coordinator. Contact information can be obtained from the following website: 
http://www.courts.state.co.us/Administration/HR/ADA/Coordinator_List.cfm

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
