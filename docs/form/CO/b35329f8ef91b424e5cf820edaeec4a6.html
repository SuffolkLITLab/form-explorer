❑  If  you  are  claiming  that  the  landlord’s  failure  to  repair  the  residential  premises  is  a  defense  to  the 
landlord’s  allegation of nonpayment  of rent,  complete  the  Affidavit  to  Support Claim for a Breach of the 
Warrant of Habitability (JDF 109).  The purpose of this form is to support the amount you will need to pay 
into the registry of the Court. 

❑  Keep  a  copy  of  each  form  for  your  own  records  and  make  copies  to  provide  to  the  Plaintiff  and/or 

attorney.  

tep 2: 

You are ready to file your Answer and/or Counterclaim with the Court.   

The  answer  and/or  counterclaim  can  be  filed  at  or  before  the  time  specified  for  the  Court  appearance  on  the 
Summons.    

❑  Provide the Court with the answer form.   
❑  Pay the appropriate answer and/or answer and counterclaim filing fee. 
❑  If  applicable,  provide  the  Court  with  the  Affidavit  to  Support  claim  for  a  Breach  of  the  Warranty  of 
Habitability (JDF 109) form.  The amount identified on the affidavit is what you are required to deposit into 
the registry of the Court.  This amount should be the rent due less any expenses you have incurred based 
upon  the  landlord’s  failure  to  repair  the  residential  premises.      Following  the  court  hearing,  the  money 
deposited will be paid to one of the parties as ordered by the Court. 

❑  If you are requesting a jury trial, the jury demand fee must be paid at this time. 
❑  All filing fees paid are non-refundable. 

OURT DATE 

❑  It  is  important  that  you  are  on  time  or  early  for  your  Court  Hearing  and  that  you  have  all  of  your 

information/supporting documents with you.   

❑  If you filed the Affidavit (JDF 109) identifying that habitation is an issue, you are required to provide the 
court with receipts to support the repair work that was completed.  Make extra copies of the receipts for 
the Court and the Plaintiff and/or attorney.  

❑  Please turn off your cell phone and respect all parties in the courtroom.   
❑  You may be asked to speak to the other party before the Court Hearing to determine if the case can be 

settled to avoid going to trial. 

OSSIBLE OUTCOMES FROM YOUR COURT HEARING 

  If the Plaintiff and Defendant appear, then one of the following situations may occur: 

1.  The  Plaintiff  and  the  Defendant  can  agree  to  talk  and  agree  to  certain  acceptable  conditions  that  could 
include the payment of the claim, a payment plan, etc. This is called a Stipulation. The Stipulation form 
(JDF 75) may be purchased from the clerk’s office or you may bring one with you to Court.  
❑  The Stipulation (JDF 75) must be signed in the presence of a court clerk or notary public.  
❑  If  a  stipulation  is  reached,  an  Order  re:  Stipulation  (JDF  106)  must  be  filed  with  the  Court  with  the 
Stipulation.  Complete the caption only on the form.  The Court will complete the  remaining sections 
on the form and give you a signed copy.

    ❑

2.  The Defendant can file an answer contesting the claim of the Plaintiff any time after being served,  once 
the court has accepted/processed the new case, up to and including the first court date/return date.  The 
purpose  of  the  answer  is  for  the  Defendant  to  respond  to  the  allegations  in  the  complaint  and  a 
counterclaim would need to state any claims against the Plaintiff that the Defendant might have.  All filing 
fees paid are non-refundable and must be paid when filing the answer or counterclaim. 

3.  The Plaintiff can continue, meaning postpone, the return date if the Plaintiff feels that further discussion 
with the Defendant is necessary or if the Defendant is given another opportunity to fulfill a pre-arranged 
agreement. 

4.  A  Court  or  Jury  Trial  can  be  requested.    Certain  restrictions  apply  for  eviction  cases  if  a  Jury  Trial  is 

requested.  Please check with the clerk.  

 
If the Court accepts the Defendant’s Answer and/or Counterclaim as a legal defense, a mediation date or 
trial date will be set. Check with the Court when filing your case to determine what their procedures are.  

 
If you filed the Affidavit (JDF 109) and deposited funds in the court registry, the Court will issue an order 
to release the funds as appropriate.   

  If the Plaintiff appears and the Defendant does not  Appear, and an answer or counterclaim 

was not filed then: 
1.  Complete the Motion for Entry of Judgment (JDF 104). 

2.  Complete the caption only on the Order for Entry of Judgment with Issuance of Interrogatories (JDF 107).   

The Court will complete the remaining sections on the form and give you a signed copy.  

3.  The Court may award monetary judgment to the Plaintiff(s).  

4.  On eviction cases, a judgment for possession of the rental property may occur, with an order for a Writ of 
Restitution to issue after 48 hours from date of judgment.  Execution on the Writ of Restitution is between 
the Plaintiff & the Sheriff. 

  If the Defendant appears and the Plaintiff does not appear.  

If a counterclaim was filed and provided to the Plaintiff, the Court may award judgment to the Defendant. 

If no counterclaim has been filed, the Court may dismiss the case.  

OTION TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT JUDGMENT 

A Motion to Set Aside a Default Judgment can be filed only if the Defendant has a valid legal defense for a non-
appearance  on  the  court/return  date  AND  a  valid  legal  defense  to  the  claim  identified  in  the  Complaint  by  the 
Plaintiff. 

❑  Complete a Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment (JDF 78) and the Answer (CRCCP 3) form.  
❑  Pay the filing fee upon filing the documents.   
❑  After the Court reviews the Motion (JDF 78) and Answer (CRCCP 3), a hearing may be established 

by the Court.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
