      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR APPEALING PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENTS  
WITH THE DISTRICT COURT 

These standard instructions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice about 
your case.  If you choose to represent yourself, you are bound by the same rules and procedures as an 
attorney. 

 

 

ENERAL INFORMATION   

◆  Before a case can be filed in the District  Court,  you must have filed a “protest” with the County Assessor, 
filed  an  appeal  with  the  County  Board  of  Equalization,  and  received  a  decision  from  the  County  Board  of 
Equalization.  

◆  An appeal of the decision of the County Board of Equalization must be made no later than 30 days after the 
date  the  decision  was  mailed  to  you,  (§39-8-107,  C.R.S).  You  can  file  an  appeal  with  the  Board  of 
Assessment  Appeals,  or  file  a  Petition  with  the  District  Court,  or  you  can  submit  your  case  to  arbitration. 
Information regarding the above 3-options is as follows: 
1.  Board of Assessment Appeals:  Testimony, exhibits, or any other evidence may be introduced by you 
to set forth your position at the hearing.  This may be the quickest and least expensive method, (pro se 
taxpayers  representing  themselves,  no  filing  fee  is  required  for  the  first  two  petitions  filed  within  the 
fiscal  year).    However,  you  must  use  their  forms.    To  review  their  instructions  and  required  forms, 
contact the Board of Assessment Appeals at: 
 
 
 
 

Department of Local Affairs - Board of Assessment Appeals, State Centennial Building 
1313 Sherman Street, Room 315 
Denver, Colorado 80203   
(303) 866-7710 

http://dola.colorado.gov/baa/ 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

2.  Submit  your  case  to  arbitration:  To  pursue  arbitration,  you  must  notify  the  County  Board  of 
Equalization  of  your  intent.  The  arbitrator’s  decision  is  final  and  your  right  to  appeal  your  current 
valuation ends.  To obtain  specific details on this option,  you may  want to search for a  website for the 
county where the property is located.   

3.  File  a  Petition  with  the  District  Court:    New  testimony,  exhibits  or  any  other  evidence  may  be 
introduced  at  a  hearing.    If  you  choose  this  option,  please  read  the  information  below  prior  to  filing  a 
Petition.  A filing fee of $235.00 is required.  

◆  For additional information, please review §39-8-106 and §39-8-108 of the Colorado Revised Statutes.   
◆  If  you  have  a  disability  and  need  a  reasonable  accommodation  to  access  the  courts,  please  contact  your 

local ADA Coordinator. Contact information can be obtained from the following website: 
http://www.courts.state.co.us/Administration/HR/ADA/Coordinator_List.cfm

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
