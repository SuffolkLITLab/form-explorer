      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILING A PETITION FOR APPOINTMENT OF CO- 
GUARDIAN/CONSERVATOR OR SUCCESSOR GUARDIAN/CONSERVATOR 

These standard instructions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice about 
your case. If you choose to represent yourself, you are bound by the same rules and procedures as you 
would be if you were an attorney. 

 

 

GENERAL INFORMATION 

  A  person  who  is  interested  in  the  welfare  of  the  Ward/Protected  Person  may  petition  the  court  for  the 
appointment of a co-guardian/successor guardian or a co-conservator/successor conservator. The petitioner 
may nominate himself/herself for appointment, or the petitioner may nominate someone else. The person(s) 
nominated must be 21 years of age or older. 

  A Petition for Appointment of Co-Guardian/Successor Guardian (JDF 857) or a Petition for Appointment of Co-
Conservator/Successor Conservator (JDF 879) can be used when a guardian or conservator has already been 
appointed by the court, and after the fact, there is a need to: (1) add an additional guardian/conservator (or 
multiples) to serve together with the existing guardian/conservator; OR (2) appoint a new guardian/conservator 
to take the place of the original guardian/conservator if that person is no longer able to serve due to death, 
resignation or removal. 

  Co-Guardian/Conservator: A co-guardian/conservator is appointed to serve along-side of the already- existing 
guardian/conservator. Persons serving together as co-guardian or co-conservator have equal authority to act 
unless  otherwise  specified  by  the  court.  The  court  may  appoint  a  co-guardian/conservator  to  start  serving 
immediately, or to start serving upon the happening of some designated event. 

  Successor Guardian/Conservator: A successor guardian/conservator replaces a prior guardian/conservator. 
The court may appoint a successor guardian/conservator to serve in the event of a vacancy due to the death, 
resignation, or removal of the original guardian/conservator. The court may also make the appointment of a 
successor guardian/conservator in contemplation of a vacancy, to serve if the vacancy occurs. The successor 
guardian/conservator has the same power and authority as the prior guardian/conservator unless otherwise 
specified by the court. 

  A  name-based  criminal history  record  check  from  the  Colorado  Bureau  of  Investigation (CBI)  and a  current 
credit report of the proposed co-guardian/conservator or successor guardian/conservator must be filed with the 
court along with JDF 805 -–Acceptance of Office. 

  A  legible  copy  of  a  driver’s  license,  passport  or  other  government-issued  identification  for  the  proposed  co- 

guardian/conservator or successor guardian/conservator must be filed along with the petition. 

  For Adult Guardianship or Conservatorship case only, A Colorado Adult Protective Services (CAPS) – CAPS 
Check Written Authorization form must be complete and signed by the proposed guardian/conservator (the 
nominee) and filed with the Court. That form can be found on the Colorado Department of Humans Services 
website or by clicking this link:  CAPS_Check_Written_Authorization_Form  

NOTE:  Do  NOT  attempt  to  register  an  account  with  CAPS  or  Request  a  CAPS  Check  yourself.    Simply 
download the Written Authorization Form, complete it and file it with the court.  The court is responsible for 
processing the CAPS Check with the Colorado Adult Protective Services (CAPS).  If you have questions, please 
contact the court directly. 

  For additional information, please review §15-14-112, C.R.S. 
  If you have a disability and need a reasonable accommodation to access the courts, please contact your local 

ADA Coordinator. Contact information can be obtained from the following website:

Page 5 of 7 

of publication being at least 14 days before the hearing date. 

  The Petitioner must request a publisher’s affidavit from the newspaper after publication is

714). See form identified below. 

  Affidavit Regarding Due Diligence and Proof of Publication (JDF 714). 

  Complete all sections on this form. The purpose of this form is to describe to the Court your 
efforts to locate the individuals listed in the Notice of Hearing by Publication (JDF 716). 

  The Petitioner must sign this form. 

  Hearing Without Appearance 

  If  you  expect  your  petition  to  be  unopposed/uncontested,  you  can  request  a  hearing  without 
appearance on your petition (it is up to the court whether to allow a hearing without appearance). 
A hearing without appearance is not an actual “hearing” and no one is required to show up to court. 
A hearing without appearance date is simply a date that the court sets on its calendar to take action 
on your petition. If no objections are received by the hearing without appearance  date, the court 
will take action on your petition. If someone objects to your hearing without appearance, the matter 
will be set for a regular appearance hearing. You cannot set your petition for a hearing without 
appearance if it is contested/opposed or if you expect it to be contested/opposed. 

  If you want to set your petition for a hearing without appearance, you will need to complete the 
Notice  of  Hearing  Without  Appearance  Pursuant  to  C.R.P.P.  24  (JDF  712).  Complete  all 
sections of JDF 712, file it with the court, and send a copy of JDF 712 to all interested parties along 
with a copy of your petition. You must select a date for the hearing without appearance 

and enter that date on the form (JDF 712). The date you select must be at least 14 days from 
the date that you serve the notice and petition on interested persons. 
  Complete the Certificate of Service portion on JDF 712, listing the names and addresses of all 
persons to whom you sent the notice and petition, and the date you sent it and file JDF 712 
with the court at or before your hearing. 

  See above under step 3 for the rules regarding service of the Notice of Hearing Without 
Appearance Pursuant to C.R.P.P. 24 (JDF 712) and the petition by mail or by publication. 
The rules are the same as for the Notice of Hearing (JDF 711). 

Step 5: Hearing. 

  If you are required to appear for a hearing on your Petition, you should be prepared to present 
evidence  as  to  the  reasons  why  the  appointment  of  a  co-guardian/successor  guardian  or  a  co- 
conservator/successor conservator is appropriate, and why you (or other persons nominated) are 
appropriate to be appointed. 

  If the Court appoints a co-guardian/successor guardian or co-conservator/successor conservator, 
the  Court  will  issue  Letters  of  Guardianship  or  Conservatorship  (JDF  830,  849,  863  or  880 
depending on your situation) as a formal notice of the appointment and provide you with a copy of 
the  Order  Appointing  Co-Guardian/Successor  Guardian  (JDF  858)  or  the  Order  Appointing  Co- 
Conservator/Successor Conservator (JDF 884) 

  You may need certified copies of the Letters and Order. The number needed will vary, depending 

on your circumstances. 

  Copies of the Order must be provided to all interested persons identified in the Order. 

Step 6:       Requirements after the Court Appoints a Co-Guardian/Successor Guardian or 
Co-Conservator/Successor Conservator.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
