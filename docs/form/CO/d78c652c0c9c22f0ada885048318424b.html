Issues on Appeal 

I. 

The juvenile court erred in determining that J.B. was the legal parent of 

A.B. because the alleged biological father of A.B. was not a party to the 

case or given notice of the case. 

5. 

Statement of the Case 

I.  Nature of Case 

 

This is a parentage case that resulted in a determination that J.B. 

was the legal  parent of A.B. (the child).  J.B. seeks reversal of the 

juvenile court’s parentage determination. 

II. 

Procedural History 

In January 2021, the Adams County Delegate Child Support 

Enforcement Unit (CSEU) filed a petition to establish parentage and 

support for the child.  CF p. 1-4.  CSEU claimed that J.B. was the child’s 

presumed father because he and the child’s mother, K.B., were married 

at the time of the child’s birth.  CF p. 2-3. 

 

A magistrate held a hearing on the parentage petition in March 

2021.  Evidence presented at the hearing established that J.B. and 

mother had married in 2010 and separated in early 2016.  TR 03/01/21 

DF 1987 JV – Sample Opening Brief (Juvenile | Parentage) 

R: January 31, 2023 

Page 4 

 

  J

p. 25-27.  Mother promptly filed for divorce.  TR 03/01/21 p. 28.  While 

the divorce proceeding was pending, mother gave birth to the child in 

early 2018.  TR 03/01/21 p. 28-30.  The divorce was finalized later in 

2018 without addressing the child.  TR 03/01/21 p. 30-33. 

At the parentage hearing before the magistrate, both J.B. and 

mother testified that they always knew that J.B. was not the child’s 

biological parent.  TR 03/01/21 p. 35, 55.  This was also confirmed 

through genetic testing completed by CSEU.  TR 03/01/21 p. 10; EX, 

p. 2.  Mother identified the child’s biological father as her former 

boyfriend, L.L., who was not involved in the case.  TR 03/01/21 p. 37. 

 

At the end of the hearing, the magistrate declared J.B. the child’s 

legal parent based on his marriage to mother at the time of the child’s 

birth.  TR 03/01/21 p. 75-80; CF p. 88-100.  Although the magistrate 

recognized that L.L. did not know about the case, the magistrate 

determined that no notice was required because he had not done 

anything to assert his parentage of the child.  TR 03/01/21 p. 77-78.  

The magistrate also ordered J.B. to pay child support.  CF p. 88-100.  

J.B. then filed a motion asking the juvenile court to review the 

DF 1987 JV – Sample Opening Brief (Juvenile | Parentage) 

R: January 31, 2023 

Page 5 

 

  J

magistrate’s order.  CF p. 101-103.  The juvenile court upheld the 

magistrate’s order.  CF p. 120-123. 

J.B. now appeals. 

6.  Argument Summary 

 

The juvenile court erred in adopting the magistrate’s order because  

CSEU did not give L.L. notice of the case or make him a party to it.  A court 

does not have subject matter jurisdiction to decide parentage unless each 

person presumed to be a parent and each person alleged to be the child’s 

parent are made parties to or given notice of the case.  Because L.L. was an 

alleged biological father of the child and he was not made a party to or given 

notice of the case, the magistrate lacked jurisdiction to determine parentage. 

7.  Argument 

I. 

The juvenile court erred in adopting the magistrate’s parentage order 

because CSEU did not give notice of the case to the child’s alleged 

biological father.

Whether a juvenile court has subject matter jurisdiction is a 

question of law that is reviewed de novo.  People in Interest of E.Q., 2020 

COA 118, ¶ 9. 

B. 

Preservation: 

J.B. preserved this argument by telling the magistrate that L.L. 

should be brought into the case and named the child’s father.  TR 

03/01/21 p. 68.  J.B. raised the lack of notice to L.L. and the 

requirement to do so in the motion for review in the juvenile court.  CF 

p. 101-103. 

C.  Discussion and Argument: 

i. 

Legal Authority 

Subject matter jurisdiction concerns a court’s authority to decide a 

particular matter.  E.Q., ¶ 10; see also In re Support of E.K., 2013 COA 99, ¶ 

8.  The court's authority must be properly invoked before it can act, and 

a judgment rendered without subject matter jurisdiction is void.  E.K., ¶ 

8. 

The Uniform Parentage Act (the Act) governs the court’s 

jurisdiction to establish a parent-child relationship and mandates specific 

procedures that must be followed when a party seeks to establish 

DF 1987 JV – Sample Opening Brief (Juvenile | Parentage) 

R: January 31, 2023 

Page 7 

 

  J

parentage.  E.K., ¶ 9.  The failure to follow the requirements of the Act 

deprives the court of jurisdiction to determine parentage.  Id.; see also In re 

Marriage of Burkey, 689 P.2d 726, 727 (Colo. App. 1984). 

The Act provides that each person presumed to be a child’s 

parent under section 19-4-105, C.R.S. 2021, and each person alleged to 

be a child’s parent shall be made a party to the parentage case or if not 

subject to the jurisdiction of the court, shall be given notice of the case 

in a manner prescribed by the court and the opportunity to be heard.  § 

19-4-110, C.R.S. 2021; In re Parental Responsibilities of A.D., 240 P.3d 488, 

490 (Colo. App. 2010).  Among other things, a person is presumed to be 

a child’s father if he and the child’s mother are or  were married to each 

other and the child is born during the marriage.  § 19-4-105(1)(a). 

Accordingly, a juvenile court lacks jurisdiction to resolve matters 

in a parentage case unless each person presumed to be the child’s father 

and each person alleged to be the child’s father are made parties to or 

given notice of the case.  E.K., ¶ 12; see also Smith v. Casey, 198 Colo. 433, 

435, 601 P.2d 632, 634 (1979) (holding that the failure to join the child, 

which was previously a requirement under section 19-4-110, deprived

  J

the court of subject matter jurisdiction to resolve any matters pertaining 

to the parentage action). 

ii. 

Discussion 

Applying the law to the facts of this case, it is evident that the 

magistrate lacked jurisdiction to determine parentage of the child.  

Although J.B. was a presumed father of the child based on his previous 

marriage to mother, L.L. was identified as the child’s alleged biological 

father.  Thus, to have jurisdiction to determine the child’s parentage, the 

magistrate had to ensure that both J.B. and L.L. were parties to the case 

or were at least given notice of the case. 

Here, L.L. was not a party to the case and there is no indication in 

the record that he had any notice of the case.  As a result, the magistrate 

lacked jurisdiction to determine the child’s parentage and the juvenile 

court order adopting the magistrate’s parentage determination must be 

vacated. 

8.  Conclusion 

 

For the reasons stated above, J.B. respectfully requests that this court 

vacate the juvenile court’s order adopting the magistrate’s determination that he 

is the child’s legal parent.
