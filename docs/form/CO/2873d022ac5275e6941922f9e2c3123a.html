      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL COLORADO WATER COURT DIVISIONS 

   

◆  Standard Water Court forms are available on line at:  

http://www.courts.state.co.us/Forms/Forms_List.cfm?Form_Type_ID=10 
 

◆  The Office of the State Engineer has an excellent website that provides FAQ’s, etc. to assist you 

when filing your water case: http://water.state.co.us/ 

  A    Non  Attorney  Guidebook  to  Colorado  Water  Courts  is  available  here  on  the  state  courts 

website. 

  Please type application and any supporting documents if possible.  The Clerk of the Water Court 
will assign a new case number for all cases, including diligence cases.  The Uniform Local Rules 
for All State Water Divisions are contained in Chapter 36 of the court rules volume of the Colorado 
Revised Statutes (Colo. Rev. Stat.).  The Water Court Rules can be found here. 

  The applicant has the burden to prove all the elements of each claim for water rights.  Failure to 
meet this burden could result in the denial or dismissal of the application in whole or in part. Due 
to the complexity of applications for change of water right and applications for approval of plan for 
augmentation, applicants are strongly advised to seek the assistance of an attorney.  

  Complete the caption at the top of the form showing water division; name(s) of applicant(s); county 
where  structure  is  located;  and  attorney’s  identifying  information,  including  name  and address,  if 
the applicant is appearing through an attorney.  If you are representing yourself, please make sure 
that you include your current e-mail address in the application. 

◆  For new applications, please assign a name for the structure.  If filing for finding of diligence or to 
make a conditional water right absolute, please use the same name used when the structure was 
first conditionally decreed. 

◆  More  than  one  water  right,  claim  or  structure  may  be  incorporated  in  any  one  application  under 
one  caption,  provided  that  the  required  information  is  given  for  each  water  right,  claim,  or 
structure.  In certain instances, multiple owners may use a single application.  See Rule 3.(b) of 
the Uniform Local Rules. 
 

◆  Click here for the applicable filing fees .   Note that the filing fees may be higher for an application 
with  multiple  claims  or  for  an  application  where  one  or  more  of  the  claims  are  for  a  change  of 
water right or to approve a plan for augmentation. 

  Provide  the  legal  description  of  each  structure  using  both  UTM  coordinates  and  perpendicular 
distances  from  section  lines,  if  possible.    Include  the  ¼  ¼,  section  number,  township,  range, 
meridian and county.  Mark the location of each structure on a USGS topographic map and attach 
to  the  application  a  legible  8  ½  x  11  inch  copy  of  the  applicable  portion  of  the  map.    In  areas 
where  section  lines  have  not  been  established,  a  bearing  and  distance  to  an  established 
government  monument  is  acceptable.    In  areas  having  generally  recognized  street  addresses, 
include  street  address,  and  if  applicable,  the  lot,  block,  and  subdivision.    Required  settings  for 
GPS units are: Format must be UTM; Zone must be 12 or 13; Units must be Meters; Datum must 
be NAD83; GPS Unit must be set to true north. (As you prepare the application, you may contact 
the  local  Division  Engineer’s  Office  at  the  number  listed  on  the  chart  below  to  assist  you  in 
determining the UTM coordinates or  converting a GPS reading and/or mapping into the required 
section township/range description.)

◆  You must include in the application the names and addresses of all owners or reputed owners of 
the  land  upon  which  any  new  diversion  or  storage  structure  or  modification  to  any  existing 
diversion  or  storage  structure  is  or  will  be  constructed  or  upon  which  water  is  or  will  be  stored, 
including any modification to the existing storage pool.   

  All  questions  on  the  application  must  be  answered,  do  not  simply  refer  to  an  exhibit  -  the 
publication  notice  is  prepared  from  information  on  the  application  for  location,  dates,  etc.    The 
attachments are considered supporting material only. 

  All applicant(s), either individually, by power of attorney, or by an attorney licensed to practice law 
in  the  State  of  Colorado,  must  sign  the  application.    A  copy  of  the  executed  Power  of  Attorney 
must  accompany  any  application  signed  under  a  power  of  attorney.    Sign  verification  and  any 
supporting  affidavits  before  a  Notary  Public  or  Clerk  of  the  Water  Court.    The  filing  fee  must 
accompany the application or the application will not be considered filed.  Any application filed on 
behalf  of  an  entity  must  be  signed  by  the  representative  of  that  entity  who  recites  his  or  her 
capacity in the entity and authority to act on its behalf (e.g., “XYZ, Inc., by its duly authorized Vice 
President”).  A party that is a corporation must be represented by an attorney to file a pleading to 
protest or support a referee’s ruling.  See Uniform Local Rules for All State Water Court Divisions, 
Rule 1. 
 

◆  You may contact the local Division Engineer’s Office at the number listed on the chart below if you 

require assistance in completing an application. 

  Typically, the following exhibits will be required in a water case.  Please see the individual form for 

material that should be included in the application.  

1.  Legible map identifying location of structure(s) or proposed structure(s) and irrigated acreage 
or  proposed  irrigated  acreage,  except  that,  as  stated  in  the  application  form,  for  applications 
seeking a change of water right or approval of an augmentation plan, applicant  is required to 
file a map that, at least, depicts the approximate location of the historic use of the right. Use a 
USGS  topographic  for  the  map.    Mark  the  location  of  each  structure,  proposed  structure, 
irrigated acreage or proposed irrigated acreage on a USGS topographic map and attach to the 
application an 8 ½ x 11 inch copy of the applicable portion of the map.   

 

2.  Affidavit of person having personal knowledge of date of appropriation.   

3.  Affidavit of person measuring flow rate, including date measured, how flow rate was measured 

and the quantity of water measured.   

4.  If  the  application  involves  a  well,  provide  a  copy  of  well  permit,  well  completion  and  pump 
installation  report,  well  log  or,  if  available,  the  statement  of  beneficial  use,  or  order  of  denial 
containing the denial number for any application relating to underground water rights. 

5.  With  respect  to  applications  for  change  of  water  right  or  for  approval  of  a  plan  for 

augmentation, a copy of the decree involved. 

6.  Summary of Diversion records are available online at:  
 
 

http://water.state.co.us/pubs/research.asp  If you have additional records, you may submit 
them with your application.

the Water Clerk will mail or e-serve through state-approved e-filing system copies to appropriate 
parties, who then have 21 days to file a protest.  If no protests are received, the case is given to 
the Water Judge for entry of a decree.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
