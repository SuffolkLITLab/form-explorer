interrogatory,  you  are  required  to  furnish  them  in  answering  only  the  first  interrogatory  asking  for  that 
information.

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
