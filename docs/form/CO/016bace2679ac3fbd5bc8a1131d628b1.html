      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILING A CHANGE OF NAME  
FOLLOWING CONVICTION/ADJUDICATION FOR A FELONY 

These standard instructions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice about your 
case.  If you choose to represent yourself, you are bound by the same rules and procedures as an attorney. 

ENERAL INFORMATION BEFORE YOU FILE YOUR PETITION 

  These  instructions  only  apply  to  a  person  who  was  convicted  of  a  felony  or  adjudicated  as  a  juvenile 
delinquent for an offense that would constitute a felony if committed by an adult in Colorado or any other state 
or under federal law and the person needs a legal name change in order to be issued in that name a driver’s 
license or an identification card in Colorado.  

  The proposed name change that you are requesting should be the name under which you were convicted or 

adjudicated, unless you can show good cause for proposing a different name. 

  As a general rule, the Petition shall be filed in county court or district court in the county in which the person 
seeking a name change is a resident. However,  if the person seeking a name change  is under 19  years of 
age  and  is  the  subject  of  an  action  concerning  child  support,  allocation  of  parental  responsibilities,  or 
parenting time, the Petition shall be filed in the Court that has jurisdiction over that action. Also, if the person 
seeking a name change is under 19 years of age the Petition shall include the caption of any proceeding in 
which  a  Court  has  ordered  child  support,  allocation  of  parental  responsibilities,  or  parenting  time  regarding 
that person.   

  The Court will not consider a Petition for a name change unless the following occurs: 

✓  If the person seeking a name change is over 14  years of age, a FBI and CBI fingerprint-based criminal 

history record check is conducted within 90 days prior to the filing of the Petition. 

✓  The  Colorado  criminal  history  record  has  the  proposed  name  added  as  an  alias.  If  the  conviction  or 

adjudication occurred in another state, this may not apply.  

✓  The District Attorney’s Office(s) in the district(s) where the felony conviction(s) or adjudication(s) occurred 

received notification of the proposed name change. 

✓  If the Petitioner is in custody of the Department of Corrections, under an order for probation or community 
corrections, or incarcerated in a county jail, written notification was provided to the supervising agency. 

  For additional information, please review Colorado Revised Statutes §§13-15-101, -102, C.R.S. 
  If you have a disability and need a reasonable accommodation to access the courts, please contact your local 

ADA Coordinator. Contact information can be obtained from the following website: 
http://www.courts.state.co.us/Administration/HR/ADA/Coordinator_List.cfm

TEPS TO FILING YOUR CASE 

tep 1: 

Complete required fingerprint-based criminal history checks.  
The Petitioner must submit a criminal history check from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) at the time the  “Petition for Change of Name  (Felon)”  is filed.  Please follow these 
steps: 
❑  Law  enforcement  agencies  are  no  longer  required  to  provide  fingerprinting  for  civil  cases.  Some  law 
enforcement agencies will refer you to Colorado Application Background Services (CABS). Below is a link to 
the Colorado Bureau of Investigations website which includes information and instructions sorted by category: 
https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cbi/employment-background-checks 
Information for a FBI criminal history check can also be found on the CBI website. 

❑  If you have a felony conviction recorded in Colorado or any other state, and you know that it is inaccurate, it is 
your  responsibility  to  obtain  the  disposition  information  from  the  Court  where  such  action  occurred  as 
identified in the CBI and FBI reports. 

❑  You are also responsible for providing certified copies of any criminal dispositions that are not reflected in the 
Colorado  Bureau  of  Investigations  or  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  records  and  any  other  dispositions 
which are unknown, by contacting the agency where such actions occurred.  

tep 2: 

Notify appropriate agencies in writing. 

❑  Notify the CBI  and the FBI, in  writing, to  add  the  proposed  name change  as an alias to  the  Petitioner’s 

criminal history record.   

❑  Notify  the  District  Attorney’s  Office(s)  in  the  district(s)  where  the  felony  conviction(s)  or  adjudication(s) 
occurred that you are seeking a name change. If you are in the custody of the Department of Corrections 
(DOC), under an order for probation or community corrections, or incarcerated in a county jail, notify the 
supervisory agency in writing.  A copy of this written notification must be provided to the Court as Exhibit 
C.  

tep 3: 

Complete appropriate forms.

❑  Complete all sections of this form. 
❑  Insert your current full name and proposed name change as identified in the caption below.   
❑  The  proposed  name  change  should  be  the  name  under  which  you  were  convicted  or 
adjudicated.      For  good  cause,  the  Court  may  allow  a  change  of  name  other  than  a  name  under 
which you were convicted or adjudicated.   

❑  If  the  person  seeking  a  name  change  is  over  14  years  of  age,  attach  the  fingerprint-based  FBI 
criminal  history  record  check  to  the  Petition  as  Exhibit  A  and  the  fingerprint-based  criminal  history 
record check from the CBI as Exhibit B. The CBI record must list the proposed name as an alias. If 
the  conviction  or  adjudication  occurred  in  another  state,  submit  as  Exhibit  B  the  letter  from  CBI 
showing that no CBI record exists. Make sure that the fingerprint-based criminal history record 
checks are conducted within 90 days prior to the filing of the Petition.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
