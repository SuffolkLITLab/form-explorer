EES 

A $ 167.00 filing fee is required for each adoption.  However, if the Petitioner(s) is/are is seeking to adopt more 
than  one child, and the circumstances/availability for the children to be adopted are the same (e.g. the children 
are  available  for  the  adoption  due  to  the  death  of  the  primary  caretaker,  e.g.  biological  parent)  then  only  an 
additional $3.00 Vital Stats Fee is required for each additional child the Petitioner(s) is/are seeking to adopt.  The 
Court  will  determine  when  circumstances  exist  for  children  to  qualify  under  one  adoption  or  separate  adoptions 
such that more than one filing fee is required. See Step 1 for completing appropriate forms for each child.   

f you are unable to pay, you must complete the Motion to File without Payment and Supporting Financial Affidavit 
(JDF 205) and submit it to the Court. Once you submit the completed JDF 205 form and a blank Order (JDF 206), 
the Court will decide whether you need to pay the filing fee.
