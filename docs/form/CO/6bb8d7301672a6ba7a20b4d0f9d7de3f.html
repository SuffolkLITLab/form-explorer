These standard instructions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice about

ENERAL INFORMATION  

  These instructions and forms accommodate a consensual, unopposed transfer of protective proceedings from 
Colorado to another state.  Any Interested Person who objects to any aspect of these proceedings may file an 
objection and/or request an evidentiary hearing at any time.  

◆  Before  you  file  a  Petition  in  Colorado  to  Transfer  to  a  receiving  state,  contact  the  court  in  the  county/state 
(receiving state)  where you plan to transfer the case to  determine what their requirements are for accepting 
guardianships and/or conservatorships from other states. Each state may have different requirements, so this 
step is very important.   

◆  The Petition to Transfer must be filed in the existing Guardianship or Conservatorship case.    
◆  The Petition can be filed by the Guardian and/or Conservator.  
◆  The Petition can be filed if the Ward/Protected Person is physically present or is reasonably expected to move

considering the factors in §15-14.5-201(2), C.R.S.    

◆  For additional information, please review §§15-14.5-301 - 302, C.R.S.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
