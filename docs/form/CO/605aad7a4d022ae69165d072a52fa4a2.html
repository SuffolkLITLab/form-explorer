tep 6: 

Court’s Ruling.   

At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court has several options. The following are the more common options: 
 

  The Court may enter a Judgment and Order for Possession in your favor. If the Court does this, it means 
you have won your case, and the Defendant will be ordered to return the property to you. If this is the result 
of  your  hearing,  you  should  present  to  the  Judge  a  Judgment  and  Order  for  Possession  (JDF  118)  for 
his/her signature. Attach a copy of ‘Exhibit A” to the Order.  

  The Court may enter a Prejudgment Order for Possession after Hearing, if it is determined that you are 
entitled to possession of the property pending a final hearing. If this is the result of your hearing, you should 
present to the Judge the Prejudgment Order of Possession after Hearing (JDF 119) for his/her signature. 
Attach a copy of ‘Exhibit A’ to the Order.  The Court will set another hearing date for final resolution. In the 
interim, the Court’s Order will direct the Sheriff’s Office to take all the property from the Defendant and keep 
it in its custody until further order.  

  The Court may require a bond before ordering the Sheriff to seize the property, to protect the rights of the 

parties.  If you are required to post a bond, complete the Bond in Replevin (JDF 120).  

  The Court may continue the hearing to another date to allow additional testimony. 

 

  The Court may deny your request for possession on the grounds that the Court does not find that you are 
entitled to an Order for Possession. If the Court denies your claim, the Court may set your case for another 
hearing at which time you can bring additional proof of your right to possession, or judgment will be entered 
for the Defendant and your case will be dismissed. 

tep 7: 

Following the Hearing.  

What you need to do following the hearing depends upon how the Judge rules at the hearing. 
 

  If the Judge ruled in your favor and awarded you a Judgment and Order for Possession (JDF 118), the 
Defendant may return the property to you.  If the property is not returned, you will need to obtain from the 
Clerk of Court a certified copy of the Court’s Order.  You will need to prepare a Writ of Assistance (JDF 
121) for the Clerk of Court to issue.  Both documents must be provided to the Sheriff to seize the property 
and return it to you. 

 

 

  If the Judge issued a Prejudgment Order for Possession After Hearing (JDF 119), you will need to obtain 
from the Clerk of Court a certified copy of that Order. You will need to provide a Writ of Assistance (JDF 
121) for the Clerk of Court to issue.  Both documents must be provided to the Sheriff to seize the property 
and return it to you.  You and your witnesses will also need to attend any subsequent hearing that the Court 
may set. 
 

  If the Judge continued the hearing to another date, you and your witnesses will need to attend at that time. 

  If the Judge entered a judgment for the Defendant and dismissed your case, you have lost the case and 

will not be granted possession of the property. 

tep 8: 

Return of the Property. 

If the property is returned to you through the Sheriff’s Office, the Sheriff’s Office is entitled to payment of its fees 
and expenses for seizing and storing the property during the time prior to releasing the property to you. If you do 
pay such fees or expenses, you should take your receipt to the Clerk of Court’s Office to be recorded as court costs, 
which may then be collected from the Defendant. 

tep 9: 

Examine Your Property. 

Once your property is returned to you, you should examine it carefully and make a complete inventory of what was 
returned. Determine whether all of your property has been returned and whether it is in the same condition as when 
it was taken. If any of your property is missing, or has been damaged or destroyed, you are entitled to make a 
supplemental application to the Court for an award of damages against the Defendant to pay for your loss.
