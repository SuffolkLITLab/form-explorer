ontempt actions can be a very difficult legal matter and you may wish to seek the advice of an attorney.  Prior to 
filing  a  motion  for  contempt,  you  may  wish  to  consider  mediation.    Mediation  is  an  informal  process  in  which  a 
neutral third party helps people in conflict to negotiate a mutually acceptable agreement.  Mediation can be faster 
– and less expensive – than going to court.  Many judicial officers in Colorado require an attempt at mediation prior 
to proceeding to contested hearing.  Please see www.ColoradoODR.org or call 1-800-888-0001, ext. 55940 for 
more information.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
