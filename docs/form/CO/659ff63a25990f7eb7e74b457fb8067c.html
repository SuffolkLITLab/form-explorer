      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR ACCESS TO ADOPTION RECORDS  

 
These standard instructions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal advice about your 
case.  If you choose to represent yourself, you are bound by the same rules and procedures as an attorney. 
 

Adoption records are CONFIDENTIAL from the general public.  An “adoption record” includes the following: 

  The adoptee’s original birth certificate and amended birth certificate; 
  The final decree of adoption; 
  Information that does not disclose the name, address, place of employment, or any other material information 

that would lead to the identification of the birth parents (non-identifying information); 

  The final order of relinquishment; and 
  The order of termination of parental rights. 

pon request, information in an adoption record shall be made available ONLY to the following individuals:  

5.  A  spouse  or  partner  in  a  civil  union  of  an  adult  adoptee  with  notarized  written  consent  from  the 

adult adoptee or proof that the adult adoptee is deceased; 

6.  An adult descendant of an adoptee (child, grandchild, great-grandchild, etc.) with notarized written 

consent from the adult adoptee or proof that the adult adoptee is deceased; 

7.  An  adult  sibling  or  half-sibling  of  an  adult  adoptee  with  notarized  written  consent  from  the  adult 

adoptee or proof that the adult adoptee is deceased; 

8.  An adoptive parent or grandparent of an adult adoptee with notarized written consent from the adult 

adoptee or proof that the adult adoptee is deceased; or  

9.  The legal representative of any individual mentioned in numbers 5-8 with notarized written consent 

from the adult adoptee or proof that the adult adoptee is deceased.  

  NOTE:  If one family has adopted two or more siblings, access to adoption records concerning an adoptee 
               SHALL NOT be permitted until all of the siblings adopted by the family have reached 18 years of age. 

  If you are not one of the individuals listed above, the court MAY still allow you to have access to the adoption 
records  ONLY  if  you  can  demonstrate  to  the  court  that  there  is  good  cause  (a  good  reason)  to  allow  you  to 
have access to the records.  The court will make this decision based on the information you provide (see §19-1-
309, C.R.S.). 
 

  You should file your request to access adoption records (see Form JDF 532) in the county where the adoption 

occurred in the existing adoption case. 

  Adoptees  of  Native  American  Ancestry  may  seek  access  to  records  under  the  provision  of  the  Indian  Child 

Welfare Act (See sections 1917 and 1951): http://www.nicwa. org/Indian_Child_Welfare_Act/ 

ACCESS BY A BIRTH PARENT TO THE ORIGINAL BIRTH CERTIFICATE OR 
TO A DEATH CERTIFICATE 

  If you are the birth parent and you relinquished (gave up) your child for adoption, you may apply to the State 

Registrar at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) – Vital Records Division for 
a non-certified copy of the child’s original birth certificate IF: 

•  Your name is on the original birth certificate OR you signed the original birth certificate; AND 
•  The child was born in Colorado OR the adoption was finalized in Colorado 

  

 
 

 

 

 

  

1.  An adult adoptee; 
2.  An adoptive parent of a minor adoptee; 
3.  A custodial grandparent of a minor adoptee; or 
4.  The legal representative of any individual mentioned in numbers 1 – 3.

NOTE: You may not receive a copy of the child’s original birth certificate if your parental rights were terminated 
as a result of a dependency and neglect case.  
 

  If you are one of the individuals listed in 1-9 above or a birth parent, you may ask the State Registrar to search 
for a death certificate to determine whether an adoptee or birth parent is deceased.  If the State Registrar finds 
a death certificate, they shall provide you with a copy.  There may be a fee for this service.

Request for Access to Adoption Records 
Order for Good Cause re: Access to Adoption Records  

STEPS TO FILING YOUR CASE: 

tep 1: 

Complete Forms.  

  Request for Access to Adoption Records (JDF 532):  

  Complete all applicable sections on this form. 
  If you are making your request by mail, you must sign JDF 532 in front of a Notary Public.  If you are 

making your request in person, you do not need to sign in front of a Notary Public.  

  Order for Good Cause re:  Access to Adoption Records (JDF 533):  

Note:  This form is only required if you filled out paragraph #4 of JDF 532 (Request for Access to Adoption 
Records).  
  Only submit the Order form if you are requesting access to an adoption file for good cause pursuant to 

section 19-1-309, C.R.S. 

  The Court upon their review of the Request will complete the Order as appropriate.  

tep 2: 

File the Request Form in the County Where the Adoption was Finalized.  

  File the Request form. 
  File  the  Order  form  ONLY  if  you  filled  out  paragraph  #4  of  JDF  532  (Request  for  Access  to  Adoption 

Records). 

  Check with the Court regarding the cost to locate, retrieve, copy, and mail your adoption records.    

tep 3: 

Provide  the  court  with  proof  of  identification  and  documents  establishing 

how you are related to the adoptee. 
The court must take steps to ensure that it is providing direct access to the adoption records ONLY to persons who 
are  authorized  by  law  to  see  them.    When  you  request  access  to  an  adoption  record,  the  court  will  ask  you  for 
identification.  The court will also ask you for documents that establish how you are related to the adoptee.  Ask the 
court for more details or  click here for a list of acceptable forms of identification  and documents to  establish how 
you are related to the adoptee.  If you are making your request by mail, please send copies of these documents to 
the  court  for  review  (do  not  send  originals).    The  court  will  destroy  the  copies  after  the  information  has  been 
reviewed.  If you send an original document, you will be responsible for the cost incurred in returning the originals 
by certified mail restricted delivery to ensure that these documents are delivered only to you.   

tep 4: 

Response to Your Request  

  Direct Access to Adoption Records:  After you file your Request form (JDF 532) and provide identification 
and establish relationship  as described in Step 3 above, the clerk will verify that you are a person who is 
permitted direct  access to  the  adoption records. Once the clerk verifies that  you can  access the records, 
he/she will locate the adoption records.  Once the adoption records are located and available, you will have 
the option to come to the court to inspect and/or copy the records or to have the records mailed to you by 
certified mail restricted delivery to ensure  that the records are delivered only to you.  Please let the court 
know  your  preference.    Requests  submitted  by  mail  will  be  answered  by  certified  mail  restricted  delivery 
unless you indicate otherwise.  In addition to other applicable costs and fees, you will be responsible for the 
cost  of  having  the  documents  delivered  by  certified  mail  restricted  delivery.    Contact  the  court  for 
instructions on how to submit payment.  If you prefer to inspect the records in person, check with the court 
to determine when you can expect to receive notification that the records are ready for inspection. 

  Good Cause Determinations:  If you are not an eligible party for direct access to the adoption records under 
the statute and you have asked the court to allow you to see the records based on “good cause” (by filing 
JDF 532 and JDF 533), the judge will need to decide whether to allow you access to the adoption records 
based on the information  you provide.  The court may set a hearing before a decision  is made.  You  will 
need to be prepared to attend this hearing.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
