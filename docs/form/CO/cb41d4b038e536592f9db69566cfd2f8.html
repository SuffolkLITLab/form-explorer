      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR AN AGISTOR’S LIEN 

These standard instructions are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legal 
advice about your case.  If you choose to represent yourself, you are bound by the same rules 
and procedures as an attorney. 

ENERAL INFORMATION 

➢  An Agistor’s lien is a lien filed by a person engaged in the business of feeding, herding, pasturing, keeping, 

ranching or boarding or for medical care of livestock.   

➢  An  Agistor’s  lien  is  effective  for  the  entire  period  during  which  the  livestock  is  held  by  the  Agistor.  If  the 
livestock is sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of by someone other than the  Agistor or Agistor’s agent, 
the lien continues and attaches to the proceeds of the sale, exchange or disposition. 

➢  The lien amount is limited to the value of $25,000 in County Court.  
➢  If the amount exceeds $25,000 you must file in District Court.  
➢  Before  documents  can  be  filed  in  the  Court,  the  Agistor’s  Lien  must  be  filed  with  the  Secretary  of  State  at 
www.sos.state.co.us OR the County Clerk and Recorder in the county where the livestock are located.  
➢  The Lien must be filed for at least 30 days before foreclosure.  After 30 days, a foreclosure action may be filed 

in the County OR District Court, depending on the amount of the lien. 

➢  For additional information, please review Colorado Revised Statutes §§38-20-201-210. 
➢  If you have a disability and need a reasonable accommodation to access the courts, please contact your local
