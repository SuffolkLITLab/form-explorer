party as a part of the Complaint/Motion.

❑  Obtain Certified Copies of the Order. The number of copies will vary based on your circumstances.   

❑  You will need one for yourself and one to serve the Restrained Person. 
❑  If you were awarded temporary care and control, parenting time and/or interim decision-making of 
the minor children or if the Restrained Person was ordered to have no contact with the minor 
children, you may need copies for your work, children’s school, daycare provider, etc.  

❑  Remember to carry a copy of the Protection Order and Affidavit/Certificate of Service at all 
times. 

tep 4: 

Complete Personal Service. 

You shall complete personal service on the other party with a copy of the Complaint/Motion, Temporary 
Protection Order and Affidavit/Certificate of Service per rule 4(e) of the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure prior to 
your Permanent Orders Hearing or next hearing date set by the Court. The Permanent Orders hearing is usually 
set within 14 days from your Temporary Orders Hearing or the Court may set a future hearing date to address 
parenting time and decision-making responsibilities.  Helpful Hints to complete personal service: 

❑  Take a copy of the Complaint/Motion, Temporary Protection Order, and Affidavit/Certificate of Service to 
the sheriff, a private process server, or someone you know who is 18 years or older, who is not a party to 
the case, and who knows the rules of service to serve the Respondent.  

❑  Be sure to direct the sheriff, private process server, or person serving the documents to return the original 

and copy of the Affidavit/Certificate of Service to you.   

❑  Remember to bring the original to Court on the day of your Permanent Orders Hearing.   
❑  Carry the returned Affidavit/Certificate of Service with you along with your Temporary Protection Order.  

You may need to provide both forms to law enforcement.  

❑  If personal service cannot be completed, inquire with the Court to determine what other steps can be 

taken to complete service.  

tep 5: 

Permanent Orders Hearing. 

Ask the Court for information or there may be a victim’s advocate program in your area that can provide help. You 
may call witnesses and present evidence if you wish. The Court will issue subpoenas for witnesses you need.  

❑  If you obtained a Temporary Protection Order, you must: 

◆  Appear at the permanent orders hearing or the next hearing date set by the Court on the date and 
time scheduled in the Order or your Temporary Protection Order will automatically expire.  

◆  Bring the original Affidavit/Certificate of Service and submit it to the Court. 

  If the Court grants the Permanent Protection Order, you will be provided with a written order stating such.  

When you receive the Permanent Protection Order, you need to do the following: 
❑  Obtain Certified Copies of the Order. The number of copies will vary based on your circumstances.  

❑  You will need one for yourself and one to serve the Restrained Party.  
❑  If the Restrained Person was ordered to have no contact with minor children, you may need copies 

for your work, children’s school, daycare provider, etc.  

❑  If the Restrained Person is present during the hearing, the Court will submit the Order to him/her and 

personal service is not necessary.  

❑  If the Restrained Person is not present and the Permanent Protection Order is different from the 
Temporary Protection Order, you must complete personal service. Helpful Hints to complete 
personal service: 
❑  Take a copy of the Complaint, Permanent Protection Order, and Affidavit/Certificate of Service to 
the sheriff, a private process server, or someone you know who is 18 years or older, who is not a 
party to the case, and who knows the rules of service to serve the Respondent.  

❑  Be sure to direct the sheriff, private process server, or person serving the order to return a copy 
of the Affidavit/Certificate of Service to you and to file the original with the Court as soon as 
possible after service has been completed.  

❑  If personal service cannot be completed, inquire with the Court to determine what further steps 

  ❑

 

can be taken.  

Remember to carry a copy of the Order at all times.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
