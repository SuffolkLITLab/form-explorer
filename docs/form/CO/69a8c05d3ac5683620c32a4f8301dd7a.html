The filing fee is $ 167.00 for each adoption.  However, if the Petitioner is seeking to adopt more than one child, 
and the circumstances/availability for the children to be adopted are the same (e.g. the children are available for 
the adoption due to the death of the primary caretaker, e.g. biological parent) then only an additional $3.00 Vital 
Stats fee is required for each additional child the Petitioner is seeking to adopt.  The Court will determine when 
circumstances exist for children to qualify under one adoption or separate adoptions such that more than one  $ 
167.00 filing fee is required. See Step 3 for completing appropriate forms for each child.   

f you are unable to pay, you must complete the Motion to File without Payment and Supporting Financial Affidavit 
(JDF 205) and submit it to the Court. Once you submit the completed JDF 205 form and a blank Order (JDF 206), 
the Court will decide whether you need to pay the filing fee.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
