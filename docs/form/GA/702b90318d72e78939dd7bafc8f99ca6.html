7.

This  form  is  to  be  used  when  filing  a  petition  for  an  order  declaring  no
administration necessary, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 53-2-40 et seq., and should only
be used when the decedent died intestate (without a will).

Unanimous  consent  of  the  heirs  at  law  to  the  agreed  upon  division  is  required
according to O.C.G.A. § 53-2-40 (b).

Signatures  of  heirs  who  acknowledge  service  must  be  sworn  to  before  a  notary
public or the clerk of any probate court of this State.  It is not necessary that all
acknowledgments appear on the same page.  An attorney at law may acknowledge
service  on  behalf  of  an  heir;  however,  the  attorney  must  certify  that  he  or  she
currently  represents  that  heir  with  regard  to  the  pending  matter  and,  in  order  to
comply  with  O.C.G.A.  §  53-11-6,  the  attorney's  signature  must  be  sworn  to  as
provided  above.    With  regard  to  a  power  of  attorney,  the  attorney-in-fact  may
acknowledge service on behalf of the grantor of the power, provided that the power
of attorney grants such authority, the signature of the attorney-in-fact is attested, a
copy of the power of attorney is attached, and the attorney-in-fact certifies that the
copy is a true copy and is still in effect. It is not necessary that all acknowledgments
appear on the same page.

O.C.G.A. § 53-11-2 provides that a party to a probate proceeding who is not sui
juris  must  be  represented  by  a  guardian  provided  that  the  Court  may  appoint  a
guardian ad litem or determine that the natural guardian, guardian, conservator, or
testamentary guardian has no conflict and may serve.  Should a guardian ad litem
be necessary because a party is not sui juris, use GPCSF Supplement 1.

O.C.G.A. § 53-11-2 (b) provides that when a party to a proceeding in the probate
court  is  a  post  deceased  heir  whose  estate  has  no  personal  representative,  such
deceased heir’s estate may be represented in the proceeding by a guardian ad litem.

A signed original agreement setting out the heirs’ agreed upon distribution of the
estate  must  be  attached  to  the  petition.    The  legal  description  included  in  the
agreement must sufficiently identify the property in order to pass good title.

Paragraph  4  of  this  form  requires  sufficient  factual  information  for  the  Court  to
conclude that those listed in paragraph 3 of this form include each and every heir
of the decedent and that there are not additional heirs of the same or closer degree
according to O.C.G.A. § 53-2-1.  These facts must allow the Court to rule out the
possibility that there may be other heirs of the same or closer degree who have not
been listed.  Provide the date of death of any deceased heirs and the name of the
deceased heir’s personal representative if applicable.  The personal representative
of a post deceased heir is authorized to consent on behalf of that heir.  O.C.G.A.
§ 53-2-40 (c).  A person’s heirs are determined at the time of that person’s death.

GPCSF 9

Eff. July 2021 

A close relative must be alive at the time the decedent dies to be an heir.  If an heir 
who  outlived  the  decedent  subsequently  dies,  that  post  deceased  heir  must  be 
represented by the personal representative of his or her estate or by a guardian ad 
litem.  [If you are uncertain how to determine the heirs of a decedent, refer to the 
“Heirs  Determination  Worksheet”  available  from  the  probate  court  or  at 
www.gaprobate.gov.]  Examples of such statement would be: (a) “Decedent was or 
was not married at the time of his death and had no children born, adopted, living 
or deceased, other than listed herein”; (b) “Decedent had no other siblings half or 
whole  other  than  those  listed  herein”;  and  (c)  “Decedent’s  brother  who  died 
previously had no other children born, adopted, living or deceased, other than listed 
herein.” 

Use  GPCSF  Supplement  2  if  the  Court  determines  it  is  appropriate  to  appoint  a
special process server.

Use GPCSF Supplement 3 when an additional certificate of service is necessary.

Exhibits should be labeled at the bottom of each exhibit as “Exhibit A,” “Exhibit
B,” etc. in consecutive order.  The corresponding letter of each said exhibit should
be inserted into the appropriate place in the form.

According to Uniform Probate  Court Rule 5.6  (A), unless the  Court specifically
assumes the responsibility, it is the responsibility of the moving party to prepare
the proper citation and deliver it properly so it can be served according to law.  All
pages  after  the  notice  regarding  Uniform  Probate  Court  Rule  5.6  (A)  are  to  be
completed by the moving party, unless otherwise directed by the Court.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
