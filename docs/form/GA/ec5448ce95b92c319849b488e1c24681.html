6. 

This form is to be used when petitioning for leave to convey or encumber property 
set apart as year’s support, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 53-3-20. 

This form is prepared on the assumption that the surviving spouse is the petitioner.  
If this is not the case, modify the form accordingly.  The petition may be brought 
either by a surviving spouse who participated in the award or by the guardian of the 
property of a minor child who participated in the award. 

A recent appraisal should be used if available; otherwise, a copy of the most recent 
ad valorem tax statement should be provided.  If the appraised value or tax value is 
higher than the selling price, explain the discrepancy on an additional sheet, and 
add a reference to this in paragraph 5 of the petition.  In addition, if there is a sales 
contract, a copy of the contract should be attached to this petition as an exhibit.  

According to Uniform Probate Court  Rule  5.6 (A), unless  the  Court specifically 
assumes the responsibility, it is the responsibility of the moving party to prepare 
the proper citation and deliver it properly so it may be served according to law.  All 
pages  after  the  notice  regarding  Uniform  Probate  Court  Rule  5.6  (A)  are  to  be 
completed by the moving party, unless otherwise directed by the Court.  

Use GPCSF Supplement 3 when an additional certificate of service is necessary. 

Exhibits should be labeled at the bottom of each exhibit as “Exhibit A,” “Exhibit 
B,” etc. in consecutive order.  The corresponding letter of each said exhibit should 
be inserted into the appropriate place in the form.

Necessity for filing; venue 

a. 

b. 

a. 

Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 53-3-19, it is not necessary to obtain probate court 
approval if the children  for  whom the award  was made  who are  now sui 
juris will join in the conveyance or encumbrance, unless at least one of the 
children for whom the award was made is still a minor. 

Venue: The petition must be filed in the county where the year’s support 
award was originally granted.  O.C.G.A. § 53-3-19 (b). 

8. 

Method of service pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 53-3-20 is required. 

Adult  children  for  whose  benefit  the  year’s  support  was  set  apart  with 
known  addresses  in  this  State  who  do  not  acknowledge  service  shall  be 
served personally not less than ten days prior to the date set for hearing.

d. 

Signatures of those who acknowledge service must be sworn to before a notary 
public or the clerk of any probate court of this State. An attorney at law may 
acknowledge service on behalf of his or her client.  However, such attorney 
must certify that he or she currently represents that individual with regard to 
the  pending  matter  and,  in  order  to  comply  with  O.C.G.A.  §  53-11-6,  the 
attorney’s signature must be sworn to as provided above.  It is not necessary 
that all acknowledgments appear on the same page. 

Adult  children  for  whose  benefit  the  year’s  support  was  set  apart  with 
unknown addresses or residing out of this State who do not acknowledge 
service shall be served by: 

i. 

ii. 

Publication  of notice  in  the legal organ  one time  not  less than 30 
days prior to the date set for hearing; 

Posting of notice at the courthouse not less than 30 days prior to the 
date set for hearing; and 

iii.  Mailing by First-Class Mail a copy of the notice to the last known 
address not less than 30 days prior to the date set for hearing.  

O.C.G.A. § 53-11-2 provides that a party to a probate proceeding who is not 
sui  juris  must  be  represented  by  a  guardian  provided  that  the  Court  may 
appoint a guardian ad litem or determine that the natural guardian, guardian, 
conservator, or testamentary guardian has no conflict and may serve.  If a 
guardian ad litem is necessary because a party is not sui juris, use GPCSF 
Supplement 1.
