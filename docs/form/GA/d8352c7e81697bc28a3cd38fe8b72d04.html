INSTRUCTIONS

Specific Instructions

5. 

6. 

This form is to be used for filing a petition for year’s support pursuant to O.C.G.A.  
§ 53-3-1 et seq. 

The amount set apart shall be an amount sufficient to maintain the standard of living 
that  the  surviving  spouse  and  each  minor  child  had  prior  to  the  death  of  the 
decedent, for a period of 12 months, taking into consideration the following: (a) the 
support  available  to  the  individual  for  whom  the  property  or  money  is  to  be  set 
apart,  from  sources  other  than  year’s  support,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  any 
separate estate and earning capacity of that individual; and (b) such other relevant 
criteria  as  the  Court  deems  equitable  and  proper,  including  the  solvency  of  the 
estate. 

This petition must be filed within 24 months after decedent’s death. 

The petitioner(s) or his/her/their attorney must prepare and file with the Court, no 
later than the date of the final order, a Georgia Department of Revenue Form PT-61 
for each parcel of real property located in the State of Georgia shown on “Exhibit 
A.” 

Signatures of heirs and beneficiaries who acknowledge service must be sworn to 
before a notary public or the clerk of any probate court of this State.  An attorney 
at law may acknowledge service on behalf of an heir or beneficiary; however, the 
attorney must certify that he or she currently represents that heir or beneficiary with 
regard to the pending matter and, in order to comply with O.C.G.A. § 53-11-6, the 
attorney’s signature must be sworn as provided above.  It is not necessary that all 
acknowledgments appear on the same page.  With regard to a power of attorney, 
the attorney-in-fact may acknowledge service on behalf of the grantor of the power, 
provided  that  the  power  of  attorney  grants  such  authority,  the  signature  of  the 
attorney-in-fact  is  attested,  a  copy  of  the  power  of  attorney  is  attached,  and  the 
attorney-in-fact certifies that the copy is a true copy and is still in effect. 

If  the  decedent  died without a will or  left a  will that has not yet been probated, 
paragraph 3 of this petition requires sufficient factual information for the Court to 
conclude  that  those  listed  on  “Exhibit  B”  include  each  and  every  heir  of  the 
decedent  and  that  there  are  not  additional  heirs  of  the  same  or  closer  degree 
according to O.C.G.A. § 53-2-1.  These facts must allow the Court to rule out the 
possibility that there may be other heirs of the same or closer degree who have not 
been listed.  Provide information as to whether any deceased heirs died before or 
after  the  decedent  and  the  name  and  address  of  the  deceased  heir’s  personal 
representative, if applicable.  The personal representative of a post deceased heir is 
authorized to consent on behalf of that heir.  O.C.G.A. § 53-7-1.  A person’s heirs 
are determined at the time of that person’s death.  A close relative must be alive at 

GPCSF 10

the  time  the  decedent  dies  to  be  an  heir.    If  an  heir  who  outlived  the  decedent 
subsequently  dies,  that  post  deceased  heir  must  be  represented  by  the  personal 
representative of his or her estate or by a guardian ad litem.  [If you are uncertain 
how  to  determine  the  heirs  of  a  decedent,  refer  to  the  “Heirs  Determination 
Worksheet” available from the probate court or at www.gaprobate.gov.]  Examples 
of such statement would be: (a) “Decedent was or was not married at the time of 
his death and had no children born, adopted, living or deceased, other than listed 
herein”; (b) “Decedent had no other siblings half or whole other than those listed 
herein”;  and  (c)  “Decedent’s  brother  who  died  previously  had  no  other  children 
born, adopted, living or deceased, other than listed herein.” 

“Exhibit  B”  also requires that the  tax  commissioner  be  listed  for each county in
which there is real property owned by the decedent.

O.C.G.A. § 53-11-2 provides that a party to a probate proceeding who is not sui
juris  must  be  represented  by  a  guardian  provided  that  the  Court  may  appoint  a
guardian ad litem or determine that the natural guardian, guardian, conservator, or
testamentary guardian has no conflict and may serve.  When a party to a proceeding
in  the  probate  court  is  a  post  deceased  heir  whose  estate  has  no  personal
representative, such deceased heir’s estate may be represented in the proceeding by
a guardian ad litem.  Should a guardian ad litem be necessary because a party is not
sui juris, use GPCSF Supplement 1.

Use  GPCSF  Supplement  2  if  the  Court  determines  it  is  appropriate  to  appoint  a
special process server.

Use GPCSF Supplement 3 when an additional certificate of service is necessary.

Exhibits should be labeled as “Exhibit A,” “Exhibit B,” etc. in consecutive order.
The corresponding letter of each said exhibit should be inserted into the appropriate
place in the form.

According to Uniform Probate  Court Rule 5.6  (A),  unless the Court specifically
assumes the responsibility, it is the responsibility of the moving party to prepare
the proper citation and deliver it properly so it can be served according to law.  All
pages  after  the  notice  regarding  Uniform  Probate  Court  Rule  5.6  (A)  are  to  be
completed by the moving party, unless otherwise directed by the Court.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
