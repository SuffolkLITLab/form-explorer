5. 

6. 

This  form  is  to  be  used  for  a  petition  for  discharge  of  a  personal  representative 
pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 53-7-50 or discharge of a temporary administrator pursuant 
to  O.C.G.A.  §  53-7-52.    A  personal  representative  may,  pursuant  to  O.C.G.A.  
§  53-7-50  (e),  petition  the  court  solely  for  discharge  from  office  but  not  from  all 
liability. 

If  the  petition  is  filed  by  a  personal  representative,  the  notice  to  debtors  and 
creditors must have been published for four weeks, and three months must have 
elapsed from the date of the last publication.  O.C.G.A. §§ 53-7-41; 53-11-4. 

Signatures  of  heirs  who  acknowledge  service  must  be  sworn  to  before  a  notary 
public or the clerk of any probate court of this State.  It is not necessary that all 
acknowledgments appear on the same page.  An attorney at law may acknowledge 
service on behalf of an heir.  However, such attorney must certify that he or she 
currently  represents  that  heir  with  regard  to  the  pending  matter  and,  in  order  to 
comply  with  O.C.G.A.  §  53-11-6,  the  attorney’s  signature  must  be  sworn  to  as 
provided  above.    With  regard  to  a  power  of  attorney,  the  attorney-in-fact  may 
acknowledge service on behalf of the grantor of the power, provided that the power 
of attorney grants such authority, the signature of the attorney-in-fact is attested, a 
copy of the power of attorney is attached, and the attorney-in-fact certifies that the 
copy is a true copy and is still in effect. 

O.C.G.A. § 53-11-2 provides that a party to a probate proceeding who is not sui 
juris, is unborn, or is unknown must be represented by a guardian provided that the 
Court  may  appoint  a  guardian  ad  litem  or  determine  that  the  natural  guardian, 
guardian,  conservator,  or  testamentary  guardian  has  no  conflict  and  may  serve.  
Further, the Court may appoint a guardian ad litem for a deceased heir whose estate 
has  no  personal  representative.    If  a  guardian  ad  litem  is  necessary,  use  GPCSF 
Supplement 1.   

Use  GPCSF  Supplement  2  if  the  Court  determines  it  is  appropriate  to  appoint  a 
special process server. 

Use GPCSF Supplement 3 if an additional certificate of service is necessary.

If the decedent died intestate, paragraph 3 requires that a definitive statement be 
made to show to the court that the persons named in paragraph 2 constitute all of 
the heirs of the decedent and that there are no heirs of the same or closer degree 
according to O.C.G.A. § 53-2-1.  Provide the date of death for any deceased heirs.  
[If you are uncertain how to determine the heirs of a decedent, please refer to the 
“Heirs  Determination  Sheet”  available 
the  probate  court  or  at 
www.gaprobate.gov.]  Examples of such statement would be: (a) “Decedent was or 
was not married at the time of his death and had no children born, adopted, living, 
or deceased, other than listed herein”; (b) “Decedent had no other siblings half or 
whole  other  than  those  listed  herein”;  and  (c)  “Decedent’s  brother  who  died 
previously had no other children born, adopted, living, or deceased, other than listed 
herein.” 

from 

According to Uniform Probate Court  Rule  5.6 (A), unless  the  Court specifically 
assumes the responsibility, it is the responsibility of the moving party to prepare 
the proper citation and deliver it properly so it can be served according to law.  All 
pages  after  the  notice  regarding  Uniform  Probate  Court  Rule  5.6  (A)  are  to  be 
completed by the moving party, unless otherwise directed by the Court.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
