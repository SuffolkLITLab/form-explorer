      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre>.  This form is to be used for filing a Petition for Temporary Letters of Guardianship of a 

Minor pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 29-2-5. 

2.  Notice of the Petition must be given to the “parents” of the Minor.  If an objection to 
the  establishment  of  the  temporary  guardianship  is  filed  by  a  parent  who  is  also  a 
“natural guardian,” the Court will dismiss the Petition without a hearing.  If a parent 
who is not a natural guardian objects, a hearing on the matter will be scheduled. 

A  “parent”  is  defined  as  the  biological  or  adoptive  father  or  mother  whose 
parental rights have not been surrendered or terminated.  However, in the case of a 
child born out of wedlock, the Father shall be considered a “parent” only if he has 
legitimated the Minor. 

 father of a child born out of wedlock has legitimated the Minor if he married 
the Mother after the child’s birth or obtained an order of legitimation from a court 
of competent jurisdiction.  

 “natural guardian” is defined as each parent, unless the parents are divorced.  
If one parent has sole legal custody, that parent is the sole “natural guardian.”  If 
both parents have joint legal custody, then both parents are the “natural guardians.” 

  A

3.  Although a mother or father may not be a “legal parent,” the Court may require service 

on such person. 

4.  A  temporary  guardianship  will  be  deemed  to  be  a  permanent  guardianship  for  the 
purposes  of  obtaining  medical  insurance  coverage  for  the  Minor  if  the  guardian 
assumes  in  writing  the  obligation  to  support  the  Minor  while  the  guardianship  is  in 
effect to the extent that no other sources of support are available. 

.  Unless  otherwise  permitted  by  the  Probate  Court  in  which  the  Petition  is  filed,  a 
separate Petition must be filed for each minor.  Contact the Probate Court in which the 
Petition will be filed for its policy.  If the filing of one Petition for more than one minor 
is permitted by the Probate Court, modify the Petition accordingly. 

.  According  to  Uniform  Probate  Court  Rule  5.6  (A),  unless  the  Court  specifically 
assumes the responsibility, it is the responsibility of the moving party to prepare the 
proper citation and deliver it properly so it can be served according to law.  All pages 
after the Notice regarding Uniform Probate Court Rule 5.6 (A) are to be completed by 
the moving party, unless otherwise directed by the Court.

7.  O.C.G.A. § 53-11-2 provides that a party to a probate proceeding who is not sui juris 
must be represented by a guardian provided that the Court may appoint a guardian ad 
litem  or  determine  that  the  natural  guardian,  guardian,  conservator  or  testamentary 
guardian  has  no  conflict  and  may  serve.    Should  a  guardian  ad  litem  be  necessary 
because a party is not sui juris, use Supplement 1. 

.  Use Supplement 2 if the Court determines it is necessary to appoint a special process 

server. 

 

.  Use Supplement 3 when an additional certificate of service is necessary. 

10. Exhibits should be labeled at the bottom of each exhibit as Exhibit “A,” Exhibit “B,” 
etc.  in  consecutive  order.    The  corresponding  letter  of  each  said  exhibit  should  be 
inserted into the appropriate place in the form. 

1.  An  oath  must  be  administered  by  a  Probate  Judge  or  Clerk  (the  oath  cannot  be 
administered by a notary public).  Use Georgia Probate Court Supplement 4 for the 
oath.  The oath is not included in this form.  Georgia Probate Court Standard Form 53, 
Commission to Administer Oath, can be used if the oath is to be administered by a court 
outside the State of Georgia.
