      <pre>PETITION BY PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR 
WAIVER OF BOND, WAIVER OF REPORTS, WAIVER OF STATEMENTS, AND/OR 
GRANT OF CERTAIN POWERS 

I. 

Specific Instructions 

INSTRUCTIONS 

1.  This  form  is  to  be  used  by  an  administrator,  administrator  with  will  annexed,  or 
executor  who has already been appointed when filing a petition for waiver of bond, 
waiver of  reports,  waiver of  statements, and/or grant of  certain powers contained in 
O.C.G.A. § 53-12-261 and pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 53-7-1 (b). 

2.  Unanimous consent of the heirs to the personal representative’s petition is required, or 
the beneficiaries if the decedent died testate.  O.C.G.A. § 53-11-2 provides that a party 
to a probate court proceeding concerning a decedent’s estate who is unborn or unknown 
or is not sui juris must be represented by a guardian provided that the Court may appoint 
a guardian ad litem or determine that the natural guardian, guardian, conservator, or 
testamentary guardian has no conflict and may serve.  If a guardian ad litem is necessary 
because a party is not sui juris, use GPCSF Supplement 1.  For purposes of the consent 
required, with respect to any heir who is not sui juris, such consent may be given by 
such  guardian  ad  litem,  natural  guardian,  guardian,  conservator,  or  testamentary 
guardian.    The  personal  representative  of  a  post  deceased  heir  or  beneficiary  is 
authorized to consent on behalf of that heir or beneficiary. 

3.  Signatures of those who acknowledge service must be sworn to before a notary public 
or the clerk of any probate court of this State.  An attorney at law may acknowledge 
service on behalf of his/her client; however, the attorney must certify that he or she 
currently represents that individual with regard to the pending matter and, in order to 
comply with O.C.G.A. § 53-11-6, the attorney’s signature must be sworn to as provided 
above.  It is not necessary that all acknowledgments appear on the same page.  With 
regard to a power of attorney, the attorney-in-fact may acknowledge service on behalf 
of the grantor of the power, provided that the power of attorney grants such authority, 
the  signature  of  the  attorney-in-fact  is  attested,  a  copy  of  the  power  of  attorney  is 
attached, and the attorney-in-fact certifies that the copy is a true copy and is still in 
effect. 

4.  Notice must be published once a week for four weeks. 

5.  The relief sought in this petition and provided in the order is not retroactive. 

6.  If bond has been posted, and waiver of bond is sought for the future, check with the 
bonding compan(y)(ies) to obtain the necessary bond description to be placed in the 
petition and order and to coordinate this matter with the bonding compan(y)(ies). 

7.  In the event the assets are to be distributed according to a will, only the beneficiaries 
need to be listed in paragraph 5 of the petition and a completed definitive statement in 
paragraph 4 of the petition is not required.    In  the  event the decedent  died intestate 
(without a will), paragraph 4 of the petition requires that a definitive statement be made 
to show to the Court that the persons named in paragraph 3 of the petition constitute 

GPCSF 32   

[i] 

Eff. July 2021 

each and every heir of the decedent and that there are not additional heirs of the same 
or closer degree according to O.C.G.A. § 53-2-1.  These facts must allow the Court to 
rule out the possibility that there may be other heirs of the same or closer degree who 
have not been listed.  Provide the date of death of any deceased heirs.  The personal 
representative of a post deceased heir or beneficiary is authorized to consent on behalf 
of that heir or beneficiary. O.C.G.A. § 53-7-1.  When a party to a proceeding is a post 
deceased heir whose estate has no personal representative, such deceased heir’s estate 
may be represented in the proceedings by a guardian ad litem.  O.C.G.A. § 53-11-2 (b).  
A person’s heirs  are determined at the time of that person’s death.  A close relative 
must be alive at the time the decedent dies to be an heir.  If an heir who outlived the 
decedent subsequently dies, that post deceased heir must be represented by the personal 
representative of his or her estate or by a guardian ad litem.  [If you are uncertain how 
to determine the heirs of a decedent, refer to the “Heirs Determination Worksheet” 
available  from  the  probate  court  or  at  www.gaprobate.gov.]    Examples  of  such 
statement would be: (a) “Decedent was or was not married at the time of his death and 
had  no  children  born,  adopted,  living,  or  deceased,  other  than  listed  herein”;  (b) 
“Decedent had no other siblings half or whole other than those listed herein”; and (c) 
“Decedent’s brother who died previously had no other children born, adopted, living, 
or deceased, other than listed herein.”  

8.  Use GPCSF Supplement 3 when an additional certificate of service is necessary. 

9.  Exhibits should be labeled at the bottom of each exhibit as “Exhibit A,” “Exhibit B,” 
etc.  in  consecutive  order.    The  corresponding  letter  of  each  said  exhibit  should  be 
inserted into the appropriate place in the form. 

10. According  to  Uniform  Probate  Court  Rule  5.6  (A),  unless  the  Court  specifically 
assumes the responsibility, it is the responsibility of the petitioner to prepare the proper 
citation and deliver it properly so it can be served according to law.  All pages after the 
notice  regarding  Uniform  Probate  Court  Rule  5.6  (A)  are  to  be  completed  by  the 
moving party, unless otherwise directed by the Court. 

II.

INSTRUCTIONS 

Unless an inventory has been waived, an inventory of the estate must be  filed with this 
Court by the personal representative(s) within six months after the date of qualification as 
personal representative(s), and a copy of that inventory must be delivered to the heir(s)/ 
beneficiar(y)(ies) by First-Class Mail within the same period. 

Within 60 days after the date of qualification as personal representative(s), notice must be 
given  once  a  week  for  four  weeks  by  advertisement  in  the  newspaper  in  this  county  in 
which  sheriff’s  notices  are  published,  requiring  creditors  of  the  estate  to  render  their 
demands for payment and requiring debtors to make payment. 

Unless  returns  have  been  waived,  or  a  different  accounting  period  has  been  approved, 
within  60  days  after  the  anniversary  date  of  qualification  as  personal  representative(s), 
every year, every personal representative must make a just and true account, under oath, of 
his  or  her  receipts  and  expenditures  on  behalf  of  the  estate  during  the  preceding  year, 
together with a note or memorandum of any other fact necessary to the exhibition of the 
true condition of the estate.  The vouchers showing the correctness of each item must be 
retained by the personal representative(s). 

Unless statements have been waived, the personal representative(s) shall furnish the heirs 
or beneficiaries of an estate, annually, a statement of receipts and disbursements. 

The  personal  representative(s)  is/are  allowed  six  months  from  the  date  of  his/her/their 
qualification to ascertain the condition of the estate, during which he/she/they is/are exempt 
from suit.  The personal representative(s) should collect all debts due the estate, and pay 
the debts of the estate, wholly or in part, at the end of the six month period.  Payment of 
the debts of the decedent shall be made in accordance with their rank in priority as provided 
in O.C.G.A. § 53-7-40. 

The personal representative(s) may continue the business of the decedent for the first year 
after his/her/their qualification without a court order. 

The  normal  commissions  allowed  the  personal  representative(s)  are  two  and  one-half 
percent of all sums of money received, and a like commission on all sums of money paid 
out.  In addition, the judge of the probate court may allow a commission of up to three 
percent of the value of all property distributed in kind.  There are special rules concerning 
commissions on interest earned and extra compensation. 

After  the  payment  of  all  expenses  of  administration  and  other  debts,  the balance  of  the
