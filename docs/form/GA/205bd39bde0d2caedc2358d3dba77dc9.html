INSTRUCTIONS 

1.

4. 

5. 

This  form  is  to  be  used  for  filing  a  petition  for  termination  of  guardianship/ 
conservatorship pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 29-4-42; 29-5-72. 

The burden of proof is on the petitioner to show by a preponderance of the evidence 
that there is no longer a need for a guardianship/conservatorship. 

According  to  Uniform  Probate Court  Rule  5.6 (A), unless  the  Court specifically 
assumes the responsibility, it is the responsibility of the moving party to prepare 
the proper citation and deliver it properly so it may be served according to law.  All 
pages  after  the  notice  regarding  Uniform  Probate  Court  Rule  5.6  (A)  are  to  be 
completed by the moving party, unless otherwise directed by the Court.  

[Note to Court Staff:]  In any case in which the ward’s rights are restored, when the 
former  ward  owns  real  property,  a  certificate  of  restoration  of  rights  will  be 
completed by the clerk of the probate court and filed with the clerk of the superior 
court  of  each  county  of  this  State  in  which  the  former  ward  owns  real  property 
within 30 days of the date of such order. 

[Note to Court Staff:]  The certificate to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) 
page shall be used in all cases where a guardianship and/or conservatorship is/are 
established.  Individuals so listed in this database will be prohibited from obtaining 
a Georgia weapons carry license.  In the event the ward’s rights are restored, such 
restoration of rights shall be sent to the GBI, so the database can be updated.  Only 
the certificate needs to be sent to the GBI and not the guardianship order.

O.C.G.A. § 29-5-1; therefore, it is
