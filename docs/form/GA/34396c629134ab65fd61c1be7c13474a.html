PETITION FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A  
GUARDIAN AND/OR CONSERVATOR FOR A PROPOSED WARD 

I. 

Specific Instructions 

INSTRUCTIONS 

1.  This form is to be used for filing a Petition for the Appointment of a Guardian and/or 
Conservator for a Proposed Ward pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 29-4-10 and 29-5-10. 

2.  In determining if this Court is the proper place to bring this action, Petitioner(s) should 
consult Georgia law, including but not limited to, Chapters 4, 5 and 11 of Title 29, as 
applicable. 

3.  In any case involving the creation of a Conservatorship when the Proposed Ward owns 
real  property,  a  certificate  of  creation  of  Conservatorship  will  be  completed  by  the 
Clerk of the Probate Court and filed with the Clerk of the Superior Court of each county 
of this state in which the Proposed Ward owns real property within thirty (30) days of 
the date of such order. 

4.  The burden of proof is on the Petitioner to present clear and convincing evidence that 
the  Proposed  Ward  lacks  sufficient  capacity  to  make  or  communicate  significant 
responsible  decisions  concerning  his  or  her  health  or  safety  and  is  in  need  of  a 
guardianship  and/or  that  the  Proposed  Ward  lacks  sufficient  capacity  to  make  or 
communicate significant responsible decisions concerning the management of his or 
her property and is in need of a Conservatorship. 

5.  The Petition must state whether or not the Proposed Ward resided in another state prior 
to the Guardianship Petition being filed. The Petition must list the address at which the 
Proposed Ward resided and the individuals with whom he or she resided. The court 
may require additional service to these individuals according to O.C.G.A. §§ 29-4-10 
(b) (17) and 29-9-7 (b). 

6.  The Certificate to the Secretary of State page is to be used only when a determinative 
finding has been made that the Proposed Ward’s voting rights should be removed due 
to the lack of capacity of the ward. The order of the Court must be modified to reflect 
that this right was removed. The certificate must be mailed to the Secretary of State. 

7.  The Certificate to the GBI page shall be used in all cases where a Guardianship and/or 
Conservatorship  is/are  established.  Individuals  so  listed  in  this  database  will  be 
prohibited from obtaining a Georgia Weapons Carry License. In the event the ward’s 
rights are restored, such restoration of rights shall be sent to the GBI, so the database 
can  be  updated.  Only  the  Certificate  needs  to  be  sent  to  the  GBI  and  not  the 
Guardianship Order.

8.  The  Proposed  Ward  and  his  or  her  appointed  attorney,  and  guardian  ad  litem  if 
appointed,  shall  receive  full  copies  of  the  entire  Petition  as  filed.  All  other  parties 
entitled to service shall receive only a notice of service herein titled:  
 “NOTICE  OF 
FILING OF PETITION FOR GUARDIANSHIP AND/OR CONSERVATORSHIP.”  

9.  According to Probate Court Rule 5.6 (A), unless the Court specifically assumes the 
responsibility, it is the responsibility of the moving party to prepare the proper citation 
and deliver it properly so it can be served according to law.  All pages after the Notice 
regarding Uniform Probate Court Rule 5.6 (A) are to be completed by the moving party, 
unless otherwise directed by the Court. 

10. An  oath  must  be  administered  by  a  Probate  Judge  or  Clerk  (the  oath  cannot  be 
administered by a notary public).  Use Georgia Probate Court Supplement 4 for the 
oath.    The  oath  is  not  included  in  this  form.    Georgia  Probate  Court  Form  53, 
Commission to Administer Oath, can be used if the oath is to be administered by a court 
outside the State of Georgia.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
