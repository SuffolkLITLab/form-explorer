7. 

This form is to be used for petition for declaration of death of missing individual 
believed to be dead pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 53-9-1 et seq. 

The service requirements for this form are covered in O.C.G.A. § 53-9-2.  

This form may be used in conjunction with a petition for letters of administration, 
a petition to probate will in common or solemn form, a petition for year’s support 
or a petition for an order that no administration is necessary.  Any of these other 
petitions may be granted at any time after the death is established, provided that all 
legal requirements for the granting of the other petition have been met.  

Signatures  of  those  who  acknowledge  service  must  be  sworn  to  before  a  notary 
public  or  the  clerk  of  any  probate  court  of  this  state.    An  attorney  at  law  may 
acknowledge  service  on  behalf  of  his  or  her  client;  however,  the  attorney  must 
certify that he or she currently represents that individual with regard to the pending 
matter and, in order to comply with O.C.G.A. § 53-11-6, the attorney’s signature 
must be sworn to as provided above.  It is not necessary that all acknowledgments 
appear on the same page. 

O.C.G.A. § 53-11-2 provides that a party to a probate proceeding who is not sui juris 
must be represented by a guardian provided that the Court may appoint a guardian ad 
litem  or  determine  that  the  natural  guardian,  guardian,  conservator,  or  testamentary 
guardian  has  no  conflict  and  may  serve.    Should  a  guardian  ad  litem  be  necessary 
because a party is not sui juris, use GPCSF Supplement 1.  

The  final  order  includes  language  for  both  clear  and  convincing  evidence  and 
preponderance of  the evidence.    O.C.G.A.  § 53-9-1 dictates the burden  required 
based on the circumstances of the case.   

Paragraph  4  of  this  form  requires  sufficient  factual  information  for  the  Court  to 
conclude that those listed in paragraph 3 of this form constitute all of the would-be 
heirs of the missing individual and that there are not additional heirs of the same or 
closer degree according to O.C.G.A. § 53-2-1.  These facts must allow the Court to 
rule out the possibility that there may be other heirs of the same or closer degree 
who have not been listed.  Provide the date of death of any post deceased heirs and 
the name of the personal representative if applicable.  The personal representative 
of a post deceased heir is authorized to consent on behalf of that heir.  O.C.G.A. § 
53-7-1.  When a party to a proceeding in probate court is a post deceased heir whose 
estate  has  no  personal  representative,  such  deceased  heir’s  estate  may  be 
represented  in  the  proceeding  by  a  guardian  ad  litem.    A  person’s  heirs  are 
determined at the time of that person’s death.  A close relative must be alive at the 
time  the  decedent  dies  to  be  an  heir.  If  an  heir  who  outlived  the  decedent 
subsequently  dies,  that  post  deceased  heir  must  be  represented  by  the  personal 
representative of his or her estate or by a guardian ad litem.  [If you are uncertain 
how  to  determine  the  heirs  of  a  decedent,  refer  to  the  “Heirs  Determination 

GPCSF 18   

[i]

Worksheet”  available  from  the  probate  court  or  at  www.gaprobate.gov.]  
Examples of such statement would be: (a) “Decedent was or was not married at the 
time of his death and had no children born, adopted, living, or deceased, other than 
listed herein”; (b) “Decedent had no other siblings half or whole other than those 
listed herein”; (c) “Decedent’s brother who died previously had no other children 
born, adopted, living, or deceased, other than listed herein.”

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
