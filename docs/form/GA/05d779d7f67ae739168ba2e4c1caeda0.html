      <pre>PETITION FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF AN 
EMERGENCY GUARDIAN AND/OR CONSERVATOR FOR A PROPOSED WARD 

I.  Specific Instructions 

INSTRUCTIONS 

1.  This  form  is  to  be  used  for  filing  a  Petition  for  the  Appointment  of  an  Emergency 
Guardian and/or Conservator for a Proposed Ward pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 29-4-14 
and/or 29-5-14. 

2.  In determining if this Court is the proper place to bring this action, Petitioner(s) should 
consult Georgia law, including but not limited to, Chapters 4, 5 and 11 of Title 29, as 
applicable. 

3.  Regarding 

for 

the  need 

the  pre-hearing  appointment  of  an  Emergency 
Guardian/Emergency  Conservator,  O.C.G.A.  §§  29-4-15  (c)  (5)  and  29-5-15  (c)  (5) 
provide as follows: If the court determines that there is probable cause to believe that 
the  Proposed  Ward  is  in  immediate  need  of  an  emergency  guardian,  the  court  shall 
appoint a pre-hearing emergency guardian to serve until the emergency hearing, with 
or  without  prior  notice  to  the  Proposed  Ward,  but  only  if  the  threatened  risk  is  so 
immediate and the potential harm so irreparable that any delay is unreasonable and the 
existence of the threatened risk and potential for irreparable harm is certified by the 
affidavit of a physician licensed to practice medicine under Chapter 34 of Title 43, a 
psychologist licensed to practice under Chapter 39 of Title 43, or a licensed clinical 
social worker.  However, pending the emergency hearing, the court shall order that no 
withdrawals may be made from any account on the authority of the Proposed Ward’s 
signature without the court’s prior approval and that the emergency conservator shall 
not expend any funds of the Proposed Ward without prior court approval.  

4.  Further, if a pre-hearing emergency guardian/emergency conservator is appointed to 
serve until the emergency hearing, then such guardian and/or conservator shall, prior 
to  the  issuance  of  Letters  of  Emergency  Guardianship/Emergency  Conservatorship, 
take an oath and post such bond as the court may require.  

5.  In any case involving the creation of a Conservatorship when the Proposed Ward owns 
real property in Georgia, a certificate of creation of conservatorship will be completed 
by the Clerk of the Probate Court and filed with the Clerk of the Superior Court of each 
county in which the Proposed Ward owns real property within thirty (30) days of the 
date of such order. 

GPCSF 11 

[i] 

Eff. July 2017 

6.  The burden of proof is on the Petitioner to present clear and convincing evidence that 
the  Proposed  Ward  lacks  sufficient  capacity  to  make  or  communicate  significant 
responsible  decisions  concerning  his  or  her  health  or  safety  and  is  in  need  of  a 
guardianship AND/OR that there is an immediate, clear, and substantial risk of death 
or serious physical injury, illness, or disease unless an emergency guardian is appointed 
and/or  that  the  Proposed  Ward  lacks  sufficient  capacity  to  make  or  communicate 
significant responsible decisions concerning the management of his or her property and 
is  in  need  of  a  conservatorship  AND  that  there  is  an  immediate,  substantial  risk  of 
irreparable  waste  or  dissipation  of  the  estate  unless  an  emergency  conservator  is 
appointed. 

7.  The Certificate to the Secretary of State page is to be used only when a determinative 
finding has been made that the Proposed Ward’s voting rights should be removed due 
to the lack of capacity of the ward.  The order of the Court must be modified to reflect 
that this right was removed.  The certificate must be mailed to the Secretary of State. 

8.  The Certificate to the GBI page shall be used in all cases where a Guardianship and/or 
Conservatorship  is/are  established.    Individuals  so  listed  in  this  database  will  be 
prohibited from obtaining a Georgia Weapons Carry License.  In the event the ward’s 
rights are restored, such restoration of rights shall be sent to the GBI, so the database 
can  be  updated.    Only  the  Certificate  needs  to  be  sent  to  the  GBI  and  not  the 
Guardianship Order. 

9.  According  to  Probate  Court  Rule  5.6  (A)  unless  the  court  specifically  assumes  the 
responsibility, it is the responsibility of the moving party to prepare the proper citation 
and deliver it properly so that it can be served according to law. All pages after the 
Notice  regarding  Uniform  Probate  Court  Rule  5.6  (A)  are  to  be  completed  by  the 
moving party, unless otherwise directed by the court.  

10. An  oath  must  be  administered  by  a  Probate  Judge  or  Clerk  (the  oath  cannot  be 
administered by a notary public).  Use Georgia Probate Court Supplement 4 for the 
oath.  The oath is not included in this form.  Georgia Probate Court Standard Form 53, 
Commission to Administer Oath, can be used if the oath is to be administered by a court 
outside the State of Georgia. 

II.  General Instructions 

General  instructions  applicable  to  all  Georgia  Probate  Court  Standard  Forms  are 
available in each Probate Court or at www.gaprobate.gov, labeled GPCSF 1.
