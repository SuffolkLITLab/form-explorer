INSTRUCTIONS 

I.

Specific Instructions

8.

This  form  is  to  be  used  when  filing  a  petition  to  probate  will  in  common
form  pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 53-5-15 et seq.

An order for probate of a will in common form may be granted without service
to  any one, unless required by the Court.  The Court may refuse to grant a petition
to probate a will in common form.  (Henderson v. McVay, 269 Ga. 7 (494 SE2d
653) (1998).)

According to O.C.G.A. § 53-5-19, a probate in common form is not conclusive on
all  parties until four years from the date of the order admitting the will to probate
(or if minors,  four  years  after said  minor reaches the age of majority).

As set out in O.C.G.A. § 53-5-16 (b) “probate of a will in common form does not
protect the executor in any acts beyond the executor’s normal duties of collecting
and preserving assets.”

This form should not be used in connection with a petition to probate a copy of a
will in lieu of a lost original without checking with the Court in which the petition
will be filed.

This form should not be used to file a combination petition to probate will and for
letters  of  administration  with  will  annexed  [See  GPCSF  7,  Petition  to  Probate
Will in Solemn Form and for Letters of Administration with Will Annexed].

O.C.G.A. § 53-11-2 provides that a party to a probate proceeding who is not sui
juris must be represented by a guardian, provided that the Court may appoint a
guardian ad litem or determine that the natural guardian, guardian, conservator, or
testamentary guardian has no conflict and may serve.  If a guardian ad litem is
necessary because a party is not sui juris, use GPCSF Supplement 1.

Paragraph 4 requires sufficient factual information for the Court to conclude that
those listed in paragraph 3 include each and every heir of the decedent and that
there are not additional heirs of the same or closer degree according to O.C.G.A.
§ 53-2-1.  These facts must allow the Court to rule out the possibility that there
may be other heirs of the same or closer degree who have not been listed.  Provide
the  date  of  death  of  any  deceased  heirs  and  the  name  of  the  deceased  heir’s
personal representative, if applicable.  The personal representative of a deceased
heir is authorized to consent on behalf of that heir.  O.C.G.A. § 53-7-1.  [If you
are  uncertain  how  to  determine  the  heirs  of  a  decedent,  refer  to  the  “Heirs
Determination  Worksheet”  available 
the  probate  court  or  at
www.gaprobate.gov.]  Examples of such statement would be: (a) “Decedent was
or was  not married  at the time of his death  and had no  children born,  adopted,
living or deceased, other than listed herein”; (b) “Decedent had no other siblings
half or whole other than those listed herein”; and (c) “Decedent’s brother who died

previously  had  no  other  children  born,  adopted,  living  or  deceased,  other  than 
listed herein.” 

If a testamentary conservator is named in the will according to O.C.G.A. § 29-3-
5 and the decedent died leaving minor children, then the consent to serve should 
be completed.   

Use GPCSF Supplement 2 if the Court determines it is appropriate to appoint a 
special process server. 

Use GPCSF Supplement 3 when an additional certificate of service is necessary. 

Exhibits should be labeled at the bottom of each exhibit as “Exhibit A,” “Exhibit 
B,” etc. in consecutive order.  The corresponding letter of each said exhibit should 
be inserted into the appropriate place in the form. 

An  oath  must  be  administered  by  a  probate  judge  or  clerk  (the  oath  cannot  be 
administered by a notary public).  Use GPCSF Supplement 4 for the oath.  The 
oath is not included in this form.  GPCSF 53, Commission to Administer Oath, 
can be used if the oath is to be administered by a court outside the State of Georgia. 

According to Uniform Probate Court Rule 5.6 (A), unless the Court specifically 
assumes the responsibility, it is the responsibility of the moving party to prepare 
the proper citation and deliver it properly so it can be served according to law.  All 
pages  after  the  notice  regarding  Uniform  Probate  Court  Rule  5.6  (A)  are  to  be 
completed by the moving party, unless otherwise directed by the Court.

General Instructions 

General instructions applicable to all Georgia Probate Court Standard Forms are

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
