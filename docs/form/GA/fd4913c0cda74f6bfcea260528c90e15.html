This form is to be used when filing a combined petition to probate will in solemn
form pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 53-5-20 et seq., and for letters of administration with
the will annexed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 53-6-13 et seq.

It is permissible, but not mandatory, to use this form in connection with a petition
to probate a copy of a will in lieu of a lost original pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 53-4-46,
provided  that  appropriate  interlineations  are  made,  and  additional  information  is
given to overcome the presumption of revocation.

Signatures of heirs and beneficiaries who acknowledge service must be sworn to
before a notary public or the clerk of any probate court of this State.  An attorney
at law may acknowledge service on behalf of an heir or beneficiary; however, the
attorney must certify that he or she currently represents that heir or beneficiary with
regard to the pending matter and, in order to comply with O.C.G.A. § 53-11-6, the
attorney’s signature must be sworn as provided above.  It is not necessary that all
acknowledgments appear on the same page.  With regard to a power of attorney,
the attorney-in-fact may acknowledge service on behalf of the grantor of the power,
provided  that  the  power  of  attorney  grants  such  authority,  the  signature  of  the
attorney-in-fact  is  attested,  a  copy  of  the  power  of  attorney  is  attached,  and  the
attorney-in-fact certifies that the copy is a true copy and is still in effect.

O.C.G.A. § 53-11-2 provides that a party to a probate proceeding who is not sui
juris  must  be  represented  by  a  guardian  provided  that  the  Court  may  appoint  a
guardian ad litem or determine that the natural guardian, guardian, conservator or
testamentary  guardian  has  no  conflict  and  may  serve.    If  a  guardian  ad  litem  is
necessary because a party is not sui juris, use GPCSF Supplement 1.

O.C.G.A.  §  53-6-15  (b)  provides  that  the  petition  shall  be  served  on  the
beneficiaries of the will and the executor, if any, of any deceased executor whose
death  created  the  vacancy  in  the  manner  described  in  Chapter  11  of  Title  53.
O.C.G.A. § 53-11-3 (a).

O.C.G.A.  § 53-5-22 (c) provides that service of notice, when made personally or
by mail, shall include a copy of the petition and of the will for which probate is
sought.  The same is true when service is acknowledged.  This form may, but is not
required to, be used where service by registered or certified mail with return receipt
requested, restricted delivery, is requested by the petitioner(s) in lieu of personal
service, in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 53-11-3 (e).  Make appropriate changes in
the  order  for  notice,  notice,  and  certificate  of  service.    If  petitioner(s)  request(s)
personal service by registered, certified, or statutory overnight delivery with return
receipt requested and with delivery restricted to the addressee only and that service
is unsuccessful, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 53-11-3 (e) service must be made pursuant
to O.C.G.A. § 53-11-3 (a).

Paragraph 4 of the petition requires sufficient factual information for the Court to
conclude that those listed in paragraph 3 of the petition include each and every heir
of the decedent and that there are not additional heirs of similar or closer degree
according to O.C.G.A. § 53-2-1.  These facts must allow the Court to rule out the
possibility that there may be other heirs of the same or closer degree who have not
been listed.  Provide the date of death of any deceased heirs and the name of the
deceased heir’s personal representative, if applicable.  The personal representative
of a post deceased heir is authorized to consent on behalf of that heir.  O.C.G.A. §
53-7-1.  When a party to a proceeding in the probate court is a post deceased heir
whose  estate  has  no  personal  representative,  such  deceased  heir’s  estate  may  be
represented  in  the  proceeding  by  a  guardian  ad  litem.    A  person’s  heirs  are
determined at the time of that person’s death.  A close relative must be alive at the
time  the  decedent  dies  to  be  an  heir.    If  an  heir  who  outlived  the  decedent
subsequently  dies,  that  post  deceased  heir  must  be  represented  by  the  personal
representative of his or her estate or by a guardian ad litem.  [If you are uncertain
how  to  determine  the  heirs  of  a  decedent,  refer  to  the  “Heirs  Determination
Worksheet”  available  from  the  probate  court  or  at  www.gaprobate.gov.]
Examples of such statements would be: (a) “Decedent was or was not married at
the time of his death and had no children born, adopted, living, or deceased, other
than listed herein”; (b) “Decedent had no other siblings half or whole other than
those listed herein”; and (c) “Decedent’s brother who died previously had no other
children born, adopted, living, or deceased, other than listed herein.”

For paragraph 9 of the petition, if there is a testamentary conservator named in the
will according to O.C.G.A. § 29-3-5 and the decedent died leaving minor children,
then the consent to serve should be completed.  When a testamentary guardian is to
be  appointed,  GPCSF  Supplement  5  (Testamentary  Guardianship)  should  be
included  with  this  petition,  and  the  petitioner(s)  must  provide  full  names  and
addresses for the minor children’s adult siblings and grandparents.  If there are no
living adult siblings or grandparents, the petitioner(s) must provide full names and
addresses for the minor children’s great-grandparents, aunts, uncles, great-aunts, or
great-uncles,  if  any  such  relatives  exist.    If  the  minor  children  shared  the  same
parents,  the  petitioner(s)  may  complete  one  GPCSF  Supplement  5  for  such
similarly situated children.  If the minor children did not share the same parents, a
separate GPCSF Supplement 5 must be filed for each minor.  Contact the probate
court  in which the petition  will be filed for its  policy  as  to the filing of  GPCSF
Supplement 5 when there are multiple children.

Use  GPCSF  Supplement  2  if  the  Court  determines  it  is  appropriate  to  appoint  a
special process server.

Use GPCSF Supplement 3 when an additional certificate of service is necessary.

Exhibits should be labeled at the bottom of each exhibit as “Exhibit A,” “Exhibit
B,” etc. in consecutive order.  The corresponding letter of each said exhibit should
be inserted into the appropriate place in the form.

An  oath  must  be  administered  by  a  probate  judge  or  clerk  (the  oath  cannot  be
administered by a notary public).  Use GPCSF Supplement 4 for the oath.  The oath

GPCSF 7 

[ii] 

Eff. July 2021 

is not included in this form.  GPCSF 53, Commission to Administer Oath, can be 
used if the oath is to be administered by a court outside the State of Georgia. 

13.

According  to  Uniform Probate  Court Rule 5.6  (A),  unless the Court specifically
assumes the responsibility, it is the responsibility of the moving party to prepare
the proper citation and deliver it properly so it can be served according to law.  All
pages  after  the  notice  regarding  Uniform  Probate  Court  Rule  5.6  (A)  are  to  be
completed by the moving party, unless otherwise directed by the Court.

Petitioner(s)  further  show(s)  that  the  circumstances  giving  rise  to  the  need  for  an 

administrator with will annexed are as follows: 

[Initial all that apply] 
______ (a)  The decedent failed to  nominate an executor in the will.   

______ (b)  The nominated administrator has not reached age of majority.  
______ (c)  The  nominated executor is deceased. 

______ (d)  The  nominated executor has  renounced  or declined his/her right to  serve  as 

such. [Attach Renunciation as “Exhibit ____.”] 

______ (e)  Other  reason  a  testate  estate  is  unrepresented:  _______________________ 

______________________________________________________________ 

The  petitioner(s)  ______________________________________________ is/are entitled 

to be appointed administrator with will annexed by reason of: 

[Initial (a) or (b) and complete (b) if initialed] 

 

______ (a)  Having been unanimously selected by the beneficiaries of the will who are 
capable  of  expressing  a  choice.    If  the  sole  beneficiary  is  the  decedent’s 
surviving  spouse,  no  action  for  divorce  or  separate  maintenance  was 
pending at the time of death of the decedent. 

 

______ (b)  Appointment  of  the  proposed  administrator(s)  with  will  annexed  named 
above  will  best  serve  the  interest  of  the  estate  and  the  proposed 
administrator(s) with will annexed is/are: 
______ (1)  A beneficiary or the trustee of any trust that is a beneficiary 

under the will. 

______ (2)  A  surviving  spouse  and  no  action  for  divorce  or  separate 
maintenance  was  pending  or  completed  at  the  time  of  the 
decedent’s death. 

______ (3)  An eligible person as defined in O.C.G.A. § 53-6-1. 
______ (4)  A  creditor  of  the  estate.  [Evidence  of  such  indebtedness  is 

attached as “Exhibit ____.”] 

______ (5)  The county administrator. 

The proposed administrator(s) with will annexed should be allowed to qualify without the 
necessity of posting bond, since only personal representatives of intestate estates and temporary 
administrators are normally required to post bond.  See O.C.G.A. § 53-6-50 (a).
