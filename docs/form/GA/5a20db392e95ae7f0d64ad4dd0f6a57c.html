INSTRUCTIONS

Specific Instructions

6.

This form is to be used when filing a petition to probate will in solemn form pursuant
to O.C.G.A. § 53-5-20 et seq.

It is permissible, but not mandatory, to use this form in connection with a petition to
probate  a  copy  of  a  will  in  lieu  of  a  lost  original  pursuant  to  O.C.G.A.  §  53-4-46,
provided that appropriate interlineations are made, and additional information is given
to overcome the presumption of revocation.

Signatures of heirs who acknowledge service must be sworn to before a notary public
or  the  clerk  of  any  probate  court  of  this  State.    It  is  not  necessary  that  all
acknowledgments  appear  on  the  same  page.    An  attorney  at  law  may  acknowledge
service on behalf of an heir; however, the attorney must certify that he or she currently
represents  that  heir  with  regard  to  the  pending  matter  and,  in  order  to  comply  with
O.C.G.A. § 53-11-6, the attorney’s signature must be sworn to as provided above.  With
regard to a power of attorney, the attorney-in-fact may acknowledge service on behalf
of the grantor of the power, provided that the power of attorney grants such authority,
the  signature  of  the  attorney-in-fact  is  attested,  a  copy  of  the  power  of  attorney  is
attached, and the attorney-in-fact certifies that the copy is a true copy and is still in
effect.

O.C.G.A. § 53-11-2 provides that a party to a probate proceeding who is not sui juris
must be represented by a guardian provided that the Court may appoint a guardian ad
litem  or  determine  that  the  natural  guardian,  guardian,  conservator,  or  testamentary
guardian has no conflict and may serve.  If a guardian ad litem is necessary because a
party is not sui juris, use GPCSF Supplement 1.

O.C.G.A. § 53-5-22 (c) provides that service of notice, when made personally or by
mail,  shall  include  a  copy  of  the  petition  and  of  the  will  (and  codicil(s))  for  which
probate is sought.  The same is true when service is acknowledged.  This form may,
but is not required to, be used where service by registered or certified mail with return
receipt requested, restricted delivery, is requested by the petitioner(s) in lieu of personal
service, in accordance with O.C.G.A § 53-11-3 (e).  Make appropriate changes in the
order for notice, notice and certificate of service.  If petitioner(s) request(s) personal
service  by  registered,  certified,  or  statutory  overnight  delivery  with  return  receipt
requested  and  with  delivery  restricted  to  the  addressee  only  and  that  service  is
unsuccessful, service must be made pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 53-11-3 (a).

Paragraph  4  of  this  petition  requires  sufficient  factual  information  for  the  Court  to
conclude that those listed in paragraph 3 of this petition include each and every heir of
the  decedent  and  that  there  are  not  additional  heirs  of  the  same  or  closer  degree
according  to  O.C.G.A.  §  53-2-1.  These  facts  must  allow  the  Court  to  rule  out  the
possibility that there may be other heirs of the same or closer degree who have not been
listed.  Provide the date of death of any deceased heirs and the name of the deceased
heir’s  personal  representative,  if  applicable.    The  personal  representative  of  a  post
deceased heir is authorized to consent on behalf of that heir.  O.C.G.A. § 53-7-1.  When
a party to a proceeding in probate court is a post deceased heir whose estate has no
personal  representative,  such  deceased  heir’s  estate  may  be  represented  in  the

GPCSF 5 

[i] 

Eff. July 2021 

proceeding by a guardian ad litem.  A person’s heirs are determined at the time of that 
person’s death.  A close relative must be alive at the time the decedent dies to be an 
heir.  If an heir who outlived the decedent subsequently dies, that post deceased heir 
must be represented by the personal representative of his or her estate or by a guardian 
ad litem.  [If you are uncertain how to determine the heirs of a decedent, refer to the 
“Heirs  Determination  Worksheet”  available 
the  probate  court  or  at 
www.gaprobate.gov.]  Examples of such statements would be: (a) “Decedent was or 
was not married at the time of his death and had no children born, adopted, living, or 
deceased, other than listed herein”; (b) “Decedent had no other siblings half or whole 
other than those listed herein”; and (c) “Decedent’s brother who died previously had 
no other children born, adopted, living, or deceased, other than listed herein.” 

from 

For paragraph 6 of the petition, if there is a testamentary conservator named in the will 
according to O.C.G.A. § 29-3-5 and the decedent died leaving minor children, then the 
consent  to  serve  should  be  completed.    When  a  testamentary  guardian  is  to  be 
appointed,  GPCSF  Supplement  5  (Testamentary  Guardianship)  should  be  included 
with this petition, and the petitioner(s) must provide full names and addresses for the 
minor children’s adult siblings and grandparents.  If there are no living adult siblings 
or grandparents, the petitioner(s) must provide full names and addresses for the minor 
children’s great-grandparents, aunts, uncles, great-aunts, or great-uncles, if any such 
relatives exist.  If the minor children shared the same parents, the petitioner(s) may 
complete one GPCSF Supplement 5 for such similarly situated children.  If the minor 
children did not share the same parents, a separate GPCSF Supplement 5 must be filed 
for each minor.  Contact the probate court in which the petition will be filed for its 
policy as to the filing of GPCSF Supplement 5 when there are multiple children. 

Use GPCSF Supplement 2 if the Court determines it is appropriate to appoint a special 
process server. 

Use GPCSF Supplement 3 when an additional certificate of service is necessary. 

Exhibits should be labeled at the bottom of each exhibit as “Exhibit A,” “Exhibit B,” 
etc.  in  consecutive  order.    The  corresponding  letter  of  each  said  exhibit  should  be 
inserted into the appropriate place in the form. 

An  oath  must  be  administered  by  a  probate  judge  or  clerk  (the  oath  cannot  be 
administered by a notary public).  Use GPCSF Supplement 4 for the oath.  The oath is 
not included in this form. GPCSF 53, Commission to Administer Oath, can be used if 
the oath is to be administered by a court outside the State of Georgia. 

According  to  Uniform  Probate  Court  Rule  5.6  (A),  unless  the  Court  specifically 
assumes the responsibility, it is the responsibility of the moving party to prepare the 
proper citation and deliver it properly so it can be served according to law.  All pages 
after the notice regarding Uniform Probate Court Rule 5.6 (A) are to be completed by 
the moving party, unless otherwise directed by the Court.
