      <pre>PETITION OF PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR LEAVE TO SELL PROPERTY 

I.

Specific Instructions

INSTRUCTIONS 

1.

4.

5.

This form is to be used when a personal representative petitions for leave to sell
real  or  personal  property  pursuant  to  O.C.G.A.  §  53-8-13,  or  when  a  temporary
administrator petitions to show good cause for being granted leave to sell real or
personal property pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 53-8-10 (b).

If  the  petition  is  by  a  temporary  administrator,  this  form  should  be  altered  as
follows: The term “temporary administrator” should be placed wherever the term
“personal  representative”  or  “administrator”  appears  throughout  the  entire  form.
Also, if the form is used for a temporary administrator, the final order may need to
be amended, especially if the original order of appointment did not give the power
to sell property.

With  regard  to  paragraph  6  of  the  petition,  a  recent  appraisal  should  be  used  if
available; otherwise, a copy of the most recent ad valorem tax statement should be
provided.  If the appraised value or tax value is higher than the selling price, explain
the discrepancy on an additional sheet and add a reference to this in paragraph 4 of
the petition.  In addition, if there is a sales contract, a copy of the contract should
be attached as an exhibit and labeled appropriately.

In the event the assets are to be distributed according to a will, only the beneficiaries
need to be listed in paragraph 2.  In the event the decedent died intestate (without a
will), paragraph 3 requires that a definitive statement be made to show to the court
that the persons named in paragraph 2 constitute all of the heirs of the decedent and
that there are no heirs of the same or closer degree according to O.C.G.A. § 53-2-1.
Provide the date of death for any deceased heirs.  The personal representative of a
deceased heir is authorized to consent on behalf of that heir.  [If you are uncertain
how  to  determine  the  heirs  of  a  decedent,  refer  to  the  “Heirs  Determination
Worksheet” available from the probate court or at www.gaprobate.gov.]  Examples
of such statement would be: (a) “Decedent was or was not married at the time of
his death and had no children born, adopted, living, or deceased, other than listed
herein”; (b) “Decedent had no other siblings half or whole other than those listed
herein”;  and  (c)  “Decedent’s  brother  who  died  previously  had  no  other  children
born, adopted, living, or deceased, other than listed herein.”

Signatures  of  heirs  or  beneficiaries  who  acknowledge  service  must  be  sworn  to
before a notary public or the clerk of any probate court of this State.  An attorney
at law may acknowledge service on behalf of an heir or beneficiary; however, the
attorney must certify that he or she currently represents that heir or beneficiary with
regard to the pending matter and, in order to comply with O.C.G.A. § 53-11-6, the
attorney’s signature must be sworn to as provided above.  With regard to a power
of attorney, the attorney-in-fact may acknowledge service on behalf of the grantor
of  the  power,  provided  that  the  power  of  attorney  grants  such  authority,  the

signature  of  the  attorney-in-fact  is  attested,  a  copy  of  the  power  of  attorney  is 
attached, and the attorney-in-fact certifies that the copy is a true copy and is still in 
effect. It is not necessary that all acknowledgments appear on the same page. 

O.C.G.A. § 53-11-2 provides that a party to a probate proceeding who is not sui 
juris  must  be  represented  by  a  guardian  provided  that  the  Court  may  appoint  a 
guardian ad litem or determine that the natural guardian, guardian, conservator, or 
testamentary guardian has no conflict and may serve.  When a party to a proceeding 
in the probate court is a deceased heir whose estate has no personal representative, 
such  post  deceased  heir’s  estate  may  be  represented  in  the  proceeding  by  a 
guardian.  If a guardian ad litem is necessary because a party is not sui juris, use 
GPCSF Supplement 1. 

The  service  of  this    petition  is  in  accordance  with  Chapter  11  of  Title  53  per 
O.C.G.A § 53-8-13 (b). 

Use  GPCSF  Supplement  2  if  the  Court  determines  it  is  appropriate  to  appoint  a 
special process server. 

Use GPCSF Supplement 3 when an additional certificate of service is necessary. 

Exhibits should be labeled as “Exhibit A,” “Exhibit B,” etc. in consecutive order.  
The corresponding letter of each said exhibit should be inserted into the appropriate 
place in the form. 

According to Uniform Probate  Court Rule 5.6  (A), unless the  Court specifically 
assumes the responsibility, it is the responsibility of the moving party to prepare 
the proper citation and deliver it properly so it can be served according to law.  All 
pages  after  the  notice  regarding  Uniform  Probate  Court  Rule  5.6  (A)  are  to  be 
completed by the moving party, unless otherwise directed by the Court.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
