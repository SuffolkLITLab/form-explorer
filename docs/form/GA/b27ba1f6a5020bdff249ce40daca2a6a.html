This form is to be used in connection with a petition for letters of administration
with will annexed when the will has been previously probated pursuant to O.C.G.A.
§ 53-6-15 (b).  In the event the will has not been previously probated, GPCSF 7,
Petition for Letters of Administration with Will Annexed, should be used.

Signatures of beneficiaries  who  acknowledge  service must be sworn  to before a
notary public or the clerk of any probate court of this State.  An attorney at law may
acknowledge service on behalf of a beneficiary; however, the attorney must certify
that he or she currently represents that beneficiary with regard to the pending matter
and, in order to comply with O.C.G.A. § 53-11-6, the attorney’s signature must be
sworn as provided above.  It is not necessary that all acknowledgments appear on
the  same  page.    With  regard  to  a  power  of  attorney,  the  attorney-in-fact  may
acknowledge service on behalf of the grantor of the power, provided that the power
of attorney grants such authority, the signature of the attorney-in-fact is attested, a
copy of the power of attorney is attached, and the attorney-in-fact certifies that the
copy is a true copy and is still in effect.

O.C.G.A.  §  53-6-15  (b)  provides  that  the  petition  shall  be  served  on  the
beneficiaries of the will and the executor, if any, of any deceased executor whose
death  created  the  vacancy  in  the  manner  described  in  Chapter  11  of  Title  53.
O.C.G.A. § 53-11-3 (a).

O.C.G.A. § 53-11-2 provides that a party to a probate proceeding who is not sui
juris  must  be  represented  by  a  guardian  provided  that  the  Court  may  appoint  a
guardian ad litem or determine that the natural guardian, guardian, conservator, or
testamentary guardian has no conflict and may serve.  When a party to a proceeding
is a post deceased heir whose estate has no personal representative, such deceased
heir’s  estate  may  be  represented  in  the  proceeding  by  a  guardian  ad  litem.    A
person’s heirs are determined at the time of that person’s death.  A close relative
must be alive at the time the decedent dies to be an heir.  If an heir who outlived
the decedent subsequently dies, that post deceased heir must be represented by the
personal  representative  of  his  or her estate or  by  a guardian  ad  litem.   Should a
guardian  ad  litem  be  necessary  because  a  party  is  not  sui  juris,  use  GPCSF
Supplement 1.

Use  GPCSF  Supplement  2  if  the  Court  determines  it  is  appropriate  to  appoint  a
special process server.

Use GPCSF Supplement 3 when an additional certificate of service is necessary.

Exhibits should be labeled at the bottom of each exhibit as “Exhibit A,” “Exhibit
B,” etc. in consecutive order.  The corresponding letter of each said exhibit should
be inserted into the appropriate place in the form.

An  oath  must  be  administered  by  a  probate  judge  or  clerk  (the  oath  cannot  be
administered by a notary public).  Use GPCSF Supplement 4 for the oath.  The oath
is not included in this form.  GPCSF 53, Commission to Administer Oath, can be
used if the oath is to be administered by a court outside the State of Georgia.

According  to  Uniform Probate  Court Rule 5.6  (A),  unless the Court specifically
assumes the responsibility, it is the responsibility of the moving party to prepare
the proper citation and deliver it properly so it can be served according to law.  All
pages  after  notice  regarding  Uniform  Probate  Court  Rule  5.6  (A)  are  to  be
completed by the moving party, unless otherwise directed by the Court.

Petitioner(s)  further  show(s)  that  the  circumstances  giving  rise  to  the  need  for  an 

administrator with will annexed (will previously probated) are as follows: 

[Initial all that apply] 

______ (a)  The appointed executor is deceased. 
______ (b)  The  appointed  executor  has  renounced  or  declined  his/her  right  to  serve  as 

such. [Attach renunciation as “Exhibit ____.”] 

______ (c)  Other reason a testate estate is unrepresented: _________________________. 

The  petitioner(s)  ______________________________________________ is/are entitled 

to be appointed administrator(s) with will annexed by reason of: 

[Initial (a) or (b) and complete (b) if initialed] 

______ (a)  Having been unanimously selected by the beneficiaries of the will, which was 
previously  probated,  who  are  capable  of  expressing  a  choice.    If  the  sole 
beneficiary  is  the  decedent’s  surviving  spouse,  no  action  for  divorce  or 
separate maintenance was pending at the time of death of the decedent. 

______ (b)  Appointment of the proposed administrator(s) with will annexed named above 
will best serve the interest of the estate and the proposed administrator(s) with 
will annexed is/are: 

______ (1)  A  beneficiary  or  the  trustee  of  any  trust  that  is  a  beneficiary 

under the will. 

______ (2)  A  surviving  spouse  and  no  action  for  divorce  or  separate 
maintenance  were  pending  or  completed  at  the  time  of  the 
decedent’s death. 

______ (3)  An eligible person as defined in O.C.G.A. § 53-6-1. 
______ (4)  A  creditor  of  the  estate.  [Evidence  of  such  indebtedness  is 

attached as “Exhibit ____.”] 

______ (5)  The county administrator. 

The proposed administrator(s) with will annexed should be allowed to qualify without the 
necessity of posting bond, since only personal representatives of intestate estates and temporary 
administrators are normally required to post bond.  See O.C.G.A. § 53-6-50 (a). 

To the knowledge of the petitioner(s), no other proceedings with respect to this estate are 

pending, or have been completed, in any other probate court in this State or any other state.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
