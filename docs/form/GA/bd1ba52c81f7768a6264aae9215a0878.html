This  form  is  to  be  used  for  a  petition  for  temporary  letters  of  administration 
pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 53-6-30 et seq. 

A  probate  court  may  at  any  time  and  without  notice  grant  temporary  letters  of 
administration on an unrepresented estate to continue in full force and effect until 
the temporary administrator is discharged or a personal representative is appointed 
according to O.C.G.A. § 53-6-30.  According to O.C.G.A. § 53-11-5, “The probate 
judge may direct any additional service or notice or extend the time to respond with 
respect to any proceedings covered by this chapter.…” 

Paragraph 4 requires sufficient factual information for the Court to conclude that 
those listed in paragraph 3  include each and every heir of the decedent  and that 
there are not additional heirs of the same or closer degree according to O.C.G.A. § 
53-2-1.  These facts must allow the Court to rule out the possibility that there may 
be other heirs of the same or closer degree who have not been listed.  Provide the 
date of death of any deceased heirs and the name of the deceased heir’s personal 
representative  if  applicable.    The  personal  representative  of  a  deceased  heir  is 
authorized  to  consent  on  behalf  of  that  heir.    O.C.G.A.  §  53-7-1.    [If  you  are 
uncertain  how  to  determine  the  heirs  of  a  decedent,  refer  to  the  “Heirs 
Determination  Worksheet”  available 
the  probate  court  or  at 
www.gaprobate.gov.]  Examples of such statement would be: (a) “Decedent was or 
was not married at the time of his death and had no children born, adopted, living, 
or deceased, other than listed herein”; (b) “Decedent had no other siblings half or 
whole  other  than  those  listed  herein”;  and  (c)  “Decedent’s  brother  who  died 
previously had no other children born, adopted, living or deceased, other than listed 
herein.” 

from 

Temporary administrator(s) should only collect and preserve the assets of the estate 
and only expend funds, if approved, by the judge of the probate court, after such 
notice as the judge deems necessary, according to O.C.G.A. § 53-6-31. 

An  oath  must  be  administered  by  a  probate  judge  or  clerk  (the  oath  cannot  be 
administered  by  a  notary  public).    Use  GPCSF  4  for  the  oath.    The  oath  is  not 
included in this form.  GPCSF 53, Commission to Administer Oath, can be used if 
the oath is to be administered by a court outside the State of Georgia.
