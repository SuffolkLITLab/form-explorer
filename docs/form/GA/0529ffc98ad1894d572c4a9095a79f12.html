      <pre>Instructions for Complaint for Divorce Without Minor Children 

Hello:  

If you want to file for Divorce without an attorney and you do not have any children under 18 
years old, you can use this form:  Complaint for Divorce Without Minor Children.   

Usually, you file for divorce in the County where your spouse lives. In the first blank fill 

in the SUPERIOR COURT OF  ________________COUNTY – State of Georgia.  Sometimes 
you can file where you live, if it has been less than six months since your spouse moved out of 
your marital home or if your spouse now lives out of state. 

You are the Plaintiff or Petitioner.  Your spouse is the Defendant or Respondent.  Leave 

the Civil Action Number blank until you file.  The Clerk will then give you a civil action 
number.  Put in your name in the next blank:  My name is: _______________. 

Paragraph 1) The first paragraph talks about Subject Matter Jurisdiction or where your 

case  must  be  filed.    For  the  court  to  be  able  to  hear  your  case  you  must  have  lived  in 
Georgia for at least the past six months.  If not, your spouse must have lived in Georgia 
for at least the past six months.  Just check one box - a or b. 

Paragraph 2) talks about Venue:  Venue is usually in the county where your spouse lives. 

Check only one box. 

spouse lives now.)

a) The Defendant is a resident of ____________ County (the County where your 

b) If your spouse has moved from your county within the past six months, you can file 
in that county for six months after you separate.  In the first box, put the name of the 
county where s/he lives now. But, in the second box put the county where you two 
lived together and you still live.

c) If your spouse agrees that you can file in your county, you must attach a form called 

an Acknowledgement that your spouse must sign in front of a notary.

d) If your spouse lives out of state, but you live in Georgia, you can still get a divorce.*  

You can get a divorce if your spouse

- (1) has lived in Georgia before or,

- (2) Your spouse was never a resident of Georgia or,

- (3) Your spouse agrees that the case can be heard in Georgia and signs an 
Acknowledgment of Service, Venue, and Jurisdiction.

*In this case, the Court can award a divorce, but may not be able to decide everything, like 
divide some property or debts that you got during the marriage.

Paragraph 3) Service of Process means that the Defendant, your spouse, usually must 

get a copy of the divorce papers.  (a)  The spouse can sign a form acknowledging s/he 
got a copy of the complaint.  Or the Sheriff’s Office can deliver a copy of the 

papers to her/his home or work.  Fill in the home and work address of your spouse.  If 
your spouse lives out of state, you can send a copy of the Complaint to the Sheriff’s 
office in the county in the other state and ask them to deliver the Complaint to your 
spouse.  Usually, the Sheriff will charge you to deliver a copy of your Complaint.  

(c] if you do not know where your spouse is you can still file for divorce.  You must 
show you tried to find your spouse before you can file for divorce.  You can ask his 
family, friends, or look on social media to find your spouse.  If you cannot find where 
your spouse is, you will have to file Motion for Publication and an Affidavit of Due 
Diligence saying you tried to find your spouse. *See form Motion and Affidavit in this 
packet.  

Paragraph 4) Fill in the date you married your spouse in (a).   [OR if you were married 

by common law before January 1, 1997, then you can fill in the date prior to 
January 1, 1997 when you started holding yourself out as married.]  

Paragraph 5) Fill in the date you were separated from your spouse. 

Paragraph 6)  Check the box next to paragraph 6 if you signed a Settlement Agreement. 

A Settlement Agreement is a document that says you and your spouse agree that you 
should get divorced and agree on the terms of the divorce.  Both you and your spouse 
must sign the Settlement Agreement in front of a Notary.  Then you can file it with the 
Complaint.  (See the form Settlement Agreement) 

Paragraph 7) Check (a) if you don’t have children under 18 together. 

Check (b) if you have minor children – If you have minor children, you need 
another Divorce Complaint form.  Stop here and get another form. 

Paragraph 8) Alimony.  Check box (a) or (b) or (c). 

Check box (a) if you are asking the court to award alimony because you depend on 
your spouse for your support.  Check (b) if you are not asking for alimony.  Box (c) 
means that the Court does not have jurisdiction over your spouse – for example, he 
lives out of state and has never lived in Georgia. 

Paragraph 9) If you have property, check one box.  Dividing property, like real estate, 

pensions, or investments can get very complicated. 

Check (a) if you have already divided the property you got during your marriage and you 
both are satisfied with the division.  Check (b) if you and your spouse do not have any 
property you got during the marriage, so you do not need the court to divide it.  Check 
(c) if you have property you got during the marriage and you want the court to divide the 
property.  You should describe the property like:  a house at:   
________________________(address); other real estate located 
at_______________________; a mobile home: model: ___________year: _____; 
pensions:__________; cars/trucks: ______________________; 

furniture _____; bank accounts/or other investments: _________________; or other 
property:  ________________________  You can also list these on separate pages and 
attach them to this Complaint.  Or check (d) the Court cannot divide property because, 
for example, the spouse is out of state or you haven’t been able to get jurisdiction of 
your spouse. 

10)  Joint or Marital Debts: (Check only (a), (b), or (c).

11)

12)

13)

Check (a) if you do not have joint debts.  Check (b) if you want the court to divide the 
debts, including the Creditor-who you owe the debt to, the amount you owe, and which 
person should pay the debt. Check (c) if the Court does not have jurisdiction to divide 
the debts. 

If you have been the victim of domestic violence and you are afraid, you can ask the 
Court for a Restraining Order telling your spouse to stay away from you.

If you want the court to change your name back to what it was before you were married, 
check this box, and put in the former name you want the court to give back to you.

The grounds for Divorce are in Georgia law.  You can check a, b, c, d, or e if you have 
another ground that is in the Georgia law.  Most divorces in Georgia are filed because the 
marriage is irretrievably broken.  That means one party says that the marriage is broken 
and there is no hope of getting back together.  If you choose to file based on cruel 
treatment, you must be able to prove the cruel treatment at trial and you should explain 
the cruel treatment here.  You only need one ground, but you can put in as many as apply 
and that you can prove at trial.

Lastly, you will ask the court for Relief - What do you want the court to do in this divorce 

case? 

Check (a) – You want a divorce.  (b) If you have a Settlement Agreement you want 
included by the court in your divorce, check box b.  If you asked for alimony above, you 
check box (c).  If you asked the court to divide marital property or marital debts, check 
boxes (d) or (e).   If your spouse was violent and you want a restraining order, check box 
(f).  If you want your name changed back to what it was before you were married, check 
box (g). 

Box (h) asks the court to schedule a Rule Nisi or a Hearing to hear your facts, your case, 
and what you want the court to do in this divorce.   Check the last box to cover anything 
else the court might find it should do. 

You must date and sign this form, the Complaint.  Fill in your name, address, and phone 

number. 

You will take the Complaint, along with the other forms you have completed to the 

Superior Court Clerk’s office where you are filing for divorce. You must file a 

Verification with this form, which swears that everything in this complaint is true.  
The Verification form must be signed and notarized.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
