preliminary hearing.  If the date and time of the evidentiary hearing was not set 
until  the  preliminary  hearing,  a  second  notice  shall  be  given  to  the  proposed

PROPOSED MEDICAL CONSENT WARD  ) 

 

 

FINAL ORDER 

A  preliminary  hearing  was  held  on 

above-referenced  petition  on 
____________________ 20 ___ (and an evidentiary hearing was held on __________________, 
20____).    After  considering  the  pleadings  and  the  evidence  taken  at  the  hearing(s),  the  Court 
makes the following: 

the 

All procedural requirements of O.C.G.A. § 29-4-18 have been met. 

FINDINGS OF FACT 
1. 

The  above-named  proposed  medical  consent  ward  is  in  need  of  a  temporary  medical 
consent  guardian    by  reason  of  ___________________________________________________.  
Such need appears to be limited to the following number of days: ___________________.  The 
temporary medical consent guardian shall have the limited authority to consent, on behalf of the 
proposed medical consent ward, to surgical or medical treatment or procedures not prohibited by 
law  that  the  proposed  medical  consent  ward  would  have  wanted  had  he  or  she  not  been 
incapacitated and that is in the best interest of the proposed medical consent ward, if known by 
the medical consent guardian.  If the preferences of the medical consent ward are not known to 
the medical consent guardian, the medical  consent  guardian shall  act in the best  interest  of the 
proposed medical consent ward. 

After  reasonable  inquiry,  a  person  authorized  or  willing  to  consent  for  the  proposed 
medical  consent  ward  under  the  provisions  of  O.C.G.A.  §  31-9-2  was  absent.  The  petitioner 
moved the Court to appoint _______________________________________________________ 
as  temporary  medical  consent  guardian,  asserting  that  he  or  she  should  serve  because 
_____________________________________________________________________________. 

 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 

The  Court  finds  that  the  above-named  proposed  medical  consent  ward,  hereinafter 
referred to as “the ward,” is in need of a temporary medical consent guardian because the ward 
lacks sufficient understanding or capacity to make significant responsible decisions regarding his 
or her medical treatment or the ability to communicate such decisions by any means. 

The temporary medical consent guardian is appointed for the sole and limited purposes of 
consenting  to  surgical  or  medical  treatment  or  procedures  on  behalf  of  the  ward  that  are  not

prohibited by law and that the ward would have wanted had he or she not been incapacitated, if 
known to the medical consent guardian, or, if the ward’s preferences are not known, that are in 
the best interest of the ward. 

The temporary medical consent guardianship shall terminate on the earliest of: 
(1) 
(2) 

the Court’s removal of the temporary medical consent guardian; 
the effective date of the appointment of a permanent guardian under O.C.G.A. § 29-
4-2; 
the  duration  of  the  current  hospitalization  of  the  ward  or  the  duration  of  a 
substantially continuous stay in another health care facility; or 

(3) 

(4)  60 days from the date of appointment of the temporary medical consent guardian. 

IT IS THEREFORE  ORDERED that _________________________________________ 
be,  and  hereby  is,  appointed  temporary  medical  consent  guardian  of  the  ward.    Letters  of 
temporary medical consent guardianship shall issue to the temporary medical consent guardian 
upon  his  or  her  taking  the  required  oath.    The  appointed  temporary  medical  consent  guardian 
shall have no  authority  to  act on  behalf of the  medical  consent  ward until  letters of  temporary 
medical consent guardianship have issued. 

IT  IS  FURTHER ORDERED  that the temporary medical consent  guardian  has the sole 
and limited authority to consent to surgical or medical treatment or procedures on behalf of the 
ward that are not prohibited by law and that the ward would have wanted had he or she not been 
incapacitated,  if  known  to  the  medical  consent  guardian,  or,  if  the  ward’s  preferences  are  not 
known, that are in the best interest of the ward. 

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the temporary medical consent guardian: 

_____________________________________ 
Judge of the Probate Court 

 

is authorized to withdraw life-sustaining procedures; or 

is not authorized to withdraw life-sustaining procedures, unless hereafter authorized 
by the Court. 

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a copy of this order shall be hand delivered or mailed
