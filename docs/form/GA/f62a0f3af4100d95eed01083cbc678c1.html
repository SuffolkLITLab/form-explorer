[To be used when seeking appointment of a Testamentary Guardian] 

I. 

Specific Instructions 

INSTRUCTIONS 

1.  This form should only be used when filing either Form 5 (Petition to Probate Will in 
Solemn Form pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 53-5-20 et seq.) or Form 7 (Petition to Probate 
Will in Solemn Form and for Letters of Administration with Will Annexed pursuant to 
O.C.G.A.  §  53-6-13  et  seq.).  Please  review  the  instructions  for  the  applicable  form 
when completing this Supplement.   

2.  O.C.G.A. § 53-11-2 provides that a party to a probate proceeding who is not sui juris 
must be represented by a guardian provided that the Court may appoint a guardian ad 
litem  or  determine  that  the  natural  guardian,  guardian,  conservator  or  testamentary 
guardian  has  no  conflict  and  may  serve.    Should  a  guardian  ad  litem  be  necessary 
because a party is not sui juris, use Supplement 1. 

3.  Use Supplement 2 if the Court determines it is appropriate to appoint a special process 

server. 

4.  Use Supplement 3 when an additional certificate of service is necessary. 

5.  Exhibits should be labeled at the bottom of each exhibit as Exhibit “A,” Exhibit “B,” 
etc.  in  consecutive  order.    The  corresponding  letter  of  each  said  exhibit  should  be 
inserted into the appropriate place in the form. 

6.  An  oath  must  be  administered  by  a  Probate  Judge  or  Clerk  (the  oath  cannot  be 
administered  by  a  notary  public).    Use  Supplement  4  for  the  oath.    The  oath  is  not 
included in this form. 

7.  According  to  Uniform  Probate  Court  Rule  5.6  (A),  unless  the  Court  specifically 
assumes the responsibility, it is the responsibility of the moving party to prepare the 
proper citation and deliver it properly so it can be served according to law.  All pages 
after the Notice regarding Uniform Probate Court Rule 5.6 (A) are to be completed by 
the moving party, unless otherwise directed by the Court. 

II. 

General Instructions 

     

General  instructions  applicable  to  all  Georgia  Probate  Court  Standard  Forms  are

fiduciary in the Minor(’s)(s’) best interest and exercise reasonable care, diligence, and prudence.

3.  You should inform the Court of any change of address of the Minor(s). 
4.  You  shall,  within  sixty  (60)  days  of  appointment  and  within  sixty  (60)  days  after  each 
anniversary date of appointment, file with this Court and provide to the Conservator(s) of the 
Minor(s), if any, a personal status report concerning the Minor(s).  

5.  You shall promptly notify the Court of any conflict of interest which may arise between you 

as Guardian(s) and the Minor(s) pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 29-2-23.  

6.  The Guardianship automatically terminates when the Minor dies, reaches age 18, is adopted, 

7.  You  shall  act  in  coordination  and  cooperation  with  the  Minor(’s)(s’)  Conservator(s),  if 

appointed, or if not, with others who have custody of the Minor(’s)(s’) property. 

8.  Consult  your  attorney  if  you  have  any  questions.    Your  authority  to  act  pursuant  to  these 

Letters is subject to applicable statutes and to any special orders entered in this case.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
