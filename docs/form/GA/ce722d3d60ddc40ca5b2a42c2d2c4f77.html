6. 

This  form  is  to  be  used  for  a  petition  for  letters  of  administration  pursuant  to 
O.C.G.A. § 53-6-20 et seq. 

Use of this form is permissible, but not mandatory, in connection with a petition for 
appointment  of  a  successor  administrator,  pursuant  to  O.C.G.A.  §  53-6-21  (b).  
Appropriate  strikethroughs  must  be  made,  and  additional  information  must  be 
given  concerning  the  identity  of  the  previous  administrator,  the  reason  for  the 
vacancy in the office, and the date the office became vacant. 

With respect to the conditions under which the judge may, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 
53-7-1  (b),  waive  bond,  waive  reports,  waive  statements,  and/or  grant  certain 
powers contained in O.C.G.A. § 53-12-261, note: 
all of the heirs must consent, and 
(a) 
notice must be published. 
(b) 

Signatures  of  heirs  who  acknowledge  service  must  be  sworn  to  before  a  notary 
public  or  the  clerk  of  any  probate  court  of  this  State.    An  attorney  at  law  may 
acknowledge service on behalf of an heir; however, the attorney must certify that 
he or she currently represents that heir with regard to the pending matter and, in 
order to comply with O.C.G.A. § 53-11-6, the attorney’s signature must be sworn 
to as provided above.  With regard to a power of attorney, the attorney-in-fact may 
acknowledge service on behalf of the grantor of the power, provided that the power 
of attorney grants such authority, the signature of the attorney-in-fact is attested, a 
copy of the power of attorney is attached, and the attorney-in-fact certifies that the 
copy is a true copy and is still in effect. 

O.C.G.A. § 53-11-2 provides that a party to a probate proceeding who is not sui 
juris  must  be  represented  by  a  guardian,  provided  that  the  Court  may  appoint  a 
guardian ad litem or determine that the natural guardian, guardian, conservator, or 
testamentary  guardian  has  no  conflict  and  may  serve.    If  a  guardian  ad  litem  is 
necessary because a party is not sui juris, use GPCSF Supplement 1.   

Paragraph 4 requires sufficient factual information for the Court to conclude that 
those  listed  in  paragraph  3  of  this  petition  include  each  and  every  heir  of  the 
decedent  and  that  there  are  not  additional  heirs  of  the  same  or  closer  degree 
according to O.C.G.A. § 53-2-1.  These facts must allow the Court to rule out the 
possibility that there may be other heirs of the same or closer degree who have not 
been listed.  Provide the date of death of any deceased heirs and the name of the 
deceased heir’s personal representative if applicable.  The personal representative 
of a post deceased heir(s) is authorized to consent on behalf of that heir.  O.C.G.A. 
§ 53-7-1.  When a party to a proceeding in probate court is a post deceased heir 
whose  estate  has  no  personal  representative,  such  deceased  heir’s  estate  may  be 
represented  in  the  proceeding  by  a  guardian  ad  litem.    A  person’s  heirs  are 

GPCSF 3 

[i] 

Eff. July 2021 

determined at the time of that person’s death.  A close relative must be alive at the 
time  the  decedent  dies  to  be  an  heir.    If  an  heir  who  outlived  the  decedent 
subsequently  dies,  that  post  deceased  heir  must  be  represented  by  the  personal 
representative of his or her estate or by a guardian ad litem.  [If you are uncertain 
how  to  determine  the  heirs  of  a  decedent,  refer  to  the  “Heirs  Determination 
Worksheet”  available  from  the  probate  court  or  at  www.gaprobate.gov.]  
Examples of such statement would be: (a) “Decedent was or was not married at the 
time of his death and had no children born, adopted, living, or deceased, other than 
listed herein”; (b) “Decedent had no other siblings half or whole other than those 
listed  herein”;  and  (c)  “Decedent’s  brother  who  died  previously  had  no  other 
children born, adopted, living, or deceased, other than listed herein.” 

7. 

8. 

9. 

10. 

According to  Uniform Probate Court  Rule  5.6 (A), unless  the  Court specifically 
assumes the responsibility, it is the responsibility of the moving party to prepare 
the proper citation and deliver it properly so it may be served according to law.  All 
pages  after  the  notice  regarding  Uniform  Probate  Court  Rule  5.6  (A)  are  to  be 
completed by the moving party, unless otherwise directed by the Court.  

Use GPCSF Supplement 3 when an additional certificate of service is necessary. 

Exhibits should be labeled at the bottom of each exhibit as “Exhibit A,” “Exhibit 
B,” etc. in consecutive order.  The corresponding letter of each said exhibit should 
be inserted into the appropriate place in the form. 

An  oath  must  be  administered  by  a  probate  judge  or  clerk  (the  oath  cannot  be 
administered by a notary public).  Use GPCSF Supplement 4 for the oath.  The oath 
is not included in this form.  GPCSF 53, Commission to Administer Oath, can be 
used if the oath is to be administered by a court outside the State of Georgia. 

II. 

General Instructions 

General instructions applicable to all Georgia Probate Court Standard Forms are

INSTRUCTIONS  

Unless inventory has been waived, an inventory of the estate must be filed with this Court 
by  the  administrator  within  six  months  after  these  letters  are  issued  and  a  copy  of  that 
inventory must be delivered to the sui juris heirs by First-Class Mail within the same period. 

Within 60 days after these letters are issued, notice must be given once a week for four 
weeks by  advertisement in the official newspaper of the county in which  the petition is 
made, requiring creditors of the estate to render in their demands and requiring debtors to 
make payment. 

Unless  returns  have  been  waived,  or  a  different  accounting  period  has  been  approved, 
within 60 days after the anniversary date of issuance of these letters, in  each  and every 
year,  every  administrator  must  make  a  just  and  true  account,  under  oath,  of  his  or  her 
receipts and expenditures on behalf of the estate during the preceding year, together with a 
note or memorandum of any other fact necessary to the exhibition of the true condition of 
the estate.   The vouchers showing the correctness  of each  item  must be retained by the 
administrator.  A copy of each such return must be delivered to the sui juris heirs by First-
Class Mail within the same period.  The administrator is allowed six months from the date 
of his or her qualification to ascertain the condition of the estate, during which he or she is 
exempt from suit.  The administrator should collect all debts due the estate, and pay the 
debts of the estate, wholly or in part, at the end of the six-month period.  Payment of the 
debts of the decedent shall be made in accordance with their rank in priority as provided in 
O.C.G.A. § 53-7-40. 

Unless returns and statements have been waived, at least once in each and every year, every 
administrator must prepare a statement of his or her receipts and expenditures on behalf of 
the estate during the preceding year, and a copy of each such statement must be delivered 
to the sui juris heirs by First-Class Mail within the same period. 

The Administrator may continue the business of the decedent for the current year without 
a court order. 

The  normal  commissions  allowed  the  administrator  are  two  and  one-half  percent  of  all 
sums of money received, and a like commission on all sums of money paid out.  In addition, 
upon petition, the judge of the probate court may allow a commission of up to three percent 
of  the  value  of  all  property  distributed  in  kind.    There  are  special  rules  concerning 
commissions on interest earned and extra compensation. 

After  the  payment  of  all  expenses  of  administration  and  other  debts,  the  balance  of  the 
estate shall be promptly distributed to the heirs.  The administrator must then make a final 
return,  showing  the  receipts  and  disbursements  since  the  last  annual  accounting,  unless 
returns have been waived.  A copy of the final return must be delivered to the sui juris heirs 
by First-Class Mail at the time of filing same. 

It shall not be necessary for the administrator to mail copies of any annual returns, the final 
return, or any statements of receipts and disbursements to any heir who has individually 
waived in writing the right to receive copies of same unless and until such waiver is revoked 
in writing.
