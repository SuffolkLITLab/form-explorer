      <pre>Instructions and Forms for  
  
PETITION FOR A WRIT OF ACTUAL INNOCENCE  
  
TO THE SUPREME COURT OF VIRGINIA  

  
  
  
These instructions and forms are provided to those who seek to petition the Supreme 
Court of Virginia for a writ of actual innocence pursuant to Chapter 19.2 of Title 19.2 of the 
Code of Virginia (§ 19.2–327.2 to –327.6).   
  
1.  What is provided to someone who wants to file a petition for a writ of actual innocence?   
  
  

Included are the following materials:   
  
•  These instructions for the petition process;   

•  A form request, REQUEST FOR COUNSEL ‒ PETITION FOR A WRIT OF ACTUAL 

INNOCENCE, with attached affidavit to proceed in forma pauperis (unable to afford to 
retain an attorney);  

•  A form petition, PETITION FOR A WRIT OF ACTUAL INNOCENCE, with attached 

affidavit to proceed in forma pauperis (without payment of fees);   

  
•  Two copies of a form to be used for proof of service of the PETITION FOR A WRIT OF 

ACTUAL INNOCENCE upon the Attorney General of Virginia and upon the attorney for 
the Commonwealth of the city or county in which you were convicted; and   

  
•  A copy of Chapter 19.1 and of Chapter 19.2 of Title 19.2 of the Code of Virginia  

(§ 19.2-327.1 and § 19.2-327.2 to -327.6).   

  
2.  What is a Writ of Actual Innocence?  
  
 A petition for a writ of actual innocence is a claim by a person who has been convicted of a 
felony or who has been adjudicated delinquent by a circuit court of an offense that would be a 
felony if committed by an adult that   

(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 

he is actually innocent of that crime;   
there is human biological evidence proving that he is innocent of that crime; and   
the human biological evidence was not known or available to the petitioner or his 
attorney at trial or, if it was known, why it was not subjected to scientific testing.

hold a hearing.  
  
  
grounds upon which relief shall be granted to the petitioner. If the Supreme Court holds a 
hearing, it shall then (i) dismiss the petition for failure to establish allegations sufficient to justify 
the issuance of a writ of actual innocence, or (ii) find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that 
the petitioner has proven all of the allegations contained in paragraphs 3 through 7 of the 
PETITION FOR A WRIT OF ACTUAL INNOCENCE and that no rational trier of fact would have found 
proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and vacate the conviction. If the Supreme Court finds 
that no rational trier of fact would have found sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as 
to one or more elements of the offense for which the petitioner was convicted, but the Court 
finds that there remains in the original trial record evidence sufficient to find the petitioner guilty 
beyond a reasonable doubt of a lesser included offense, the court shall modify the conviction 
accordingly and remand the case to the circuit court for resentencing.

unless you have completed the in forma pauperis affidavit attached to the request for appointment 
of counsel. As part of this request, you must attach to that request an attested copy of the order 
of the circuit court ordering that testing of human biological evidence be performed pursuant to 
Virginia Code § 19.2-327.1.  
  
4.  What must be included with a petition for a writ of actual innocence?

Supreme Court of Virginia within sixty days of you or your counsel obtaining the results of the

5. What must be done to file a petition for a writ of actual innocence?  

If your petition is not complete, the Supreme Court may dismiss the petition or return the 
petition to you pending the completion of such petition. The Supreme Court shall not accept your 
petition unless it is accompanied by either a duly executed return of service verifying that a copy 
of this petition and all attachments have been served on the attorney for the Commonwealth of 
Virginia of the jurisdiction where the conviction occurred and a duly executed return of service 

  

 

verifying that a copy of this petition and all attachments have been served on the Attorney

Chapter 19.1 of Title 19.2 of the Code of Virginia  

 

 

19.2-327.1. Motion by a convicted felon or person adjudicated delinquent for 
scientific analysis of newly discovered or previously untested scientific evidence; 
procedure. 

A.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law or rule of court, any person convicted of a felony 
or any person who was adjudicated delinquent by a circuit court of an offense that would be a 
felony if committed by an adult may, by motion to the circuit court that entered the original 
conviction or the adjudication of delinquency, apply for a new scientific investigation of any 
human biological evidence related to the case that resulted in the felony conviction or 
adjudication of delinquency if (i) the evidence was not known or available at the time the 
conviction or adjudication of delinquency became final in the circuit court or the evidence was 
not previously subjected to testing; (ii) the evidence is subject to a chain of custody sufficient to 
establish that the evidence has not been altered, tampered with, or substituted in any way; (iii) 
the testing is materially relevant, noncumulative, and necessary and may prove the actual 
innocence of the convicted person or the person adjudicated delinquent; (iv) the testing requested 
involves a scientific method generally accepted within the relevant scientific community; and (v) 
the person convicted or adjudicated delinquent has not unreasonably delayed the filing of the 
petition after the evidence or the test for the evidence became available. 

B.  The petitioner shall assert categorically and with specificity, under oath, the facts to support 
the items enumerated in subsection A and (i) the crime for which the person was convicted or 
adjudicated delinquent, (ii) the reason or reasons the evidence was not known or tested by the 
time the conviction or adjudication of delinquency became final in the circuit court, and (iii) the 
reason or reasons that the newly discovered or untested evidence may prove the actual innocence 
of the person convicted or adjudicated delinquent. Such motion shall contain all relevant 
allegations and facts that are known to the petitioner at the time of filing and shall enumerate and 
include all previous records, applications, petitions, and appeals and their dispositions. 

C.  The petitioner shall serve a copy of such motion upon the attorney for the Commonwealth. 
The Commonwealth shall file its response to the motion within 30 days of the receipt of service. 
The court shall, no sooner than 30 and no later than 90 days after such motion is filed, hear the 
motion. Motions made by a petitioner under a sentence of death shall be given priority on the 
docket. 

D.  The court shall, after a hearing on the motion, set forth its findings specifically as to each of 
the items enumerated in subsections A and B and either (i) dismiss the motion for failure to 
comply with the requirements of this section or (ii) dismiss the motion for failure to state a claim 
upon which relief can be granted or (iii) order that the testing be done. 

  

   

FORM SC-104 (04/21)

E.  The court shall order the tests to be performed by: 

1. A laboratory mutually selected by the Commonwealth and the applicant; or 

2. A laboratory selected by the court that ordered the testing if the Commonwealth and the 
applicant are unable to agree on a laboratory. 

If the testing is conducted by the Department of Forensic Science, the court shall prescribe in its 
order, pursuant to standards and guidelines established by the Department, the method of 
custody, transfer, and return of evidence submitted for scientific investigation sufficient to insure 
and protect the Commonwealth's interest in the integrity of the evidence. The results of any such 
testing shall be furnished simultaneously to the court, the petitioner and his attorney of record 
and the attorney for the Commonwealth. The Department of Forensic Science shall give testing 
priority to cases in which a sentence of death has been imposed. The results of any tests 
performed and any hearings held pursuant to this section shall become a part of the record. 

If the testing is not conducted by the Department of Forensic Science, it shall be conducted by a 
laboratory that is accredited by an accrediting body that requires conformance to forensic-
specific requirements and that is a signatory to the International Laboratory Accreditation 
Cooperation (ILAC) Mutual Recognition Arrangement with a scope of accreditation that covers 
the testing being performed and follows the appropriate Quality Assurance Standards issued by 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 

F.  Nothing in this section shall constitute grounds to delay setting an execution date pursuant to 
§ 53.1-232.1 or to grant a stay of execution that has been set pursuant to clause (iii) or (iv) of 
§ 53.1-232.1. 
G.  An action under this section or the performance of any attorney representing the petitioner 
under this section shall not form the basis for relief in any habeas corpus proceeding or any other 
appeal. Nothing in this section shall create any cause of action for damages against the 
Commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions or any officers, employees or agents of the 
Commonwealth or its political subdivisions. 

H. In any petition filed pursuant to this chapter, the petitioner is entitled to representation by 
counsel subject to the provisions of Article 3 (§ 19.2-157 et seq.) of Chapter 10. 

 19.2-327.2. Issuance of writ of actual innocence based on biological evidence. 

otwithstanding any other provision of law or rule of court, upon a petition of a person who was 

convicted of a felony or who was adjudicated delinquent by a circuit court of an offense that 
would be a felony if committed by an adult, the Supreme Court shall have the authority to issue 
writs of actual innocence under this chapter. The writ shall lie to the circuit court that entered the 
felony conviction or adjudication of delinquency and that court shall have the authority to 
conduct hearings, as provided for in § 19.2-327.5, on such a petition as directed by order from 
the Supreme Court.

§ 19.2-327.2. When such petition is so joined, the petitioner may file a copy of the petition and 
attachments thereto and the Attorney General's answer with the circuit court that entered the 
felony conviction or adjudication of delinquency and move the court for a hearing to consider 
release of the person on bail pursuant to Chapter 9 (§ 19.2-119 et seq.). Upon hearing and for 
good cause shown, the court may order the person released from custody subject to the terms and 
conditions of bail so established, pending a ruling by the Supreme Court on the writ under 
§ 19.2-327.5. 

 19.2-327.3. Contents and form of the petition based on previously unknown or 

untested human biological evidence of actual innocence. 

.  The petitioner shall allege categorically and with specificity, under oath, the following: (i) the 

crime for which the petitioner was convicted or the offense for which the petitioner was 
adjudicated delinquent; (ii) that the petitioner is actually innocent of the crime for which he was 
convicted or adjudicated delinquent; (iii) an exact description of the human biological evidence 
and the scientific testing supporting the allegation of innocence; (iv) that the evidence was not 
previously known or available to the petitioner or his trial attorney of record at the time the 
conviction or adjudication of delinquency became final in the circuit court, or if known, the 
reason that the evidence was not subject to the scientific testing set forth in the petition; (v) the 
date the test results under § 19.2-327.1 became known to the petitioner or any attorney of record; 
(vi) that the petitioner or his attorney of record has filed the petition within 60 days of obtaining 
the test results under § 19.2-327.1; (vii) the reason or reasons the evidence will prove that no 
rational trier of fact would have found proof of guilt or delinquency beyond a reasonable doubt; 
and (viii) for any conviction or adjudication of delinquency that became final in the circuit court 
after June 30, 1996, that the evidence was not available for testing under § 9.1-1104. The 
Supreme Court may issue a stay of execution pending proceedings under the petition. Nothing in 
this chapter shall constitute grounds to delay setting an execution date pursuant to § 53.1-
232.1 or to grant a stay of execution that has been set pursuant to clause (iii) or (iv) of § 53.1-
232.1. 

.  Such petition shall contain all relevant allegations of facts that are known to the petitioner at 

the time of filing and shall enumerate and include all previous records, applications, petitions, 
and appeals and their dispositions. A copy of any test results shall be filed with the petition. The

return of service in the form of a verification that a copy of the petition and all attachments has 
been served on the attorney for the Commonwealth of the jurisdiction where the conviction or 
adjudication of delinquency occurred and the Attorney General or an acceptance of service 
signed by these officials, or any combination thereof. The Attorney General shall have 30 days 
after receipt of the record by the clerk of the Supreme Court in which to file a response to the 
petition. The response may contain a proffer of any evidence pertaining to the guilt or 
delinquency or innocence of the petitioner that is not included in the record of the case, including 
evidence that was suppressed at trial. 

D.  The Supreme Court may, when the case has been before a trial or appellate court, inspect the 
record of any trial or appellate court action, and the Court may, in any case, award a writ of 
certiorari to the clerk of the respective court below, and have brought before the Court the whole

evidence pursuant to § 9.1-1104, or from any response from the Attorney General that a 
resolution of the case requires further development of the facts under this chapter, the court may 
order the circuit court to conduct a hearing within 90 days after the order has been issued to 
certify findings of fact with respect to such issues as the Supreme Court shall direct. The record 
and certified findings of fact of the circuit court shall be filed in the Supreme Court within 30 
days after the hearing is concluded. The petitioner or his attorney of record, the attorney for the 
Commonwealth and the Attorney General shall be served a copy of the order stating the specific 
purpose and evidence for which the hearing has been ordered. 

 19.2-327.5. Relief under writ.

case, the record of any hearing held under this chapter and the record of any hearings held 
pursuant to § 19.2-327.1, and if applicable, any findings certified from the circuit court pursuant 
to § 19.2-327.4, the Supreme Court shall either dismiss the petition for failure to state a claim or 
assert grounds upon which relief shall be granted; or upon a hearing the Court shall (i) dismiss 
the petition for failure to establish allegations sufficient to justify the issuance of the writ or (ii) 
only upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the petitioner has proven all of the 
allegations contained in clauses (iv) through (viii) of subsection A of § 19.2-327.3, and upon a 
finding that no rational trier of fact would have found proof of guilt or delinquency beyond a

reasonable doubt, grant the writ, and vacate the conviction or adjudication of delinquency, or in 
the event that the Court finds that no rational trier of fact would have found sufficient evidence 
beyond a reasonable doubt as to one or more elements of the offense for which the petitioner was 
convicted or adjudicated delinquent, but the Court finds that there remains in the original trial 
record evidence sufficient to find the petitioner guilty or delinquent beyond a reasonable doubt of 
a lesser included offense, the Court shall modify the conviction or adjudication of delinquency 
accordingly and remand the case to the circuit court for resentencing. The burden of proof in a 
proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter shall be upon the convicted or delinquent person 
seeking relief. If a writ vacating a conviction or adjudication of delinquency is granted, the Court 
shall forward a copy of the writ to the circuit court, where an order of expungement shall be 
immediately granted. 

 19.2-327.6. Claims of relief. 

n action under this chapter or the performance of any attorney representing the petitioner under 

this chapter shall not form the basis for relief in any habeas corpus or appellate proceeding. 
Nothing in this chapter shall create any cause of action for damages against the Commonwealth 
or any of its political subdivisions or any officers, employees or agents of the Commonwealth or 
its political subdivisions.
