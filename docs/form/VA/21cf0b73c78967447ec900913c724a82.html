      <pre>ule 1A:4.  Out-of-State Lawyers – When Allowed to Participate in a 

Case Pro Hac Vice. 

  R

 

1. Introduction.  A lawyer who is not a member of the Virginia 

State Bar, but is currently licensed and authorized to practice law 
                  
in another state, territory, or possession of the United States of 

America (hereinafter called an “out-of-state lawyer”) may apply to 

appear as counsel pro hac vice in a particular case before any 

court, board or administrative agency (hereinafter called 

“tribunal”) in the Commonwealth of Virginia upon compliance with 

this rule.  

2. Association of Local Counsel.  No out-of-state lawyer may 

appear pro hac vice before any tribunal in Virginia unless the out-
of-state lawyer has first associated in that case with a lawyer who 

is an active member in good standing of the Virginia State Bar 

(hereinafter called “local counsel”).  The name of local counsel 

shall appear on all notices, orders, pleadings, and other documents 

filed in the case.  Local counsel shall personally appear and 

participate in pretrial conferences, hearings, trials, or other 

proceedings actually conducted before the tribunal.  Local counsel 

associating with an out-of-state lawyer in a particular case shall 

accept joint responsibility with the out-of-state lawyer to the 

client, other parties, witnesses, other counsel and to the tribunal 

in that particular case.  Any pleading or other paper required to be 

served (whether relating to discovery or otherwise) shall be invalid 

unless it is signed by local counsel.  The tribunal in which such 

case is pending shall have full authority to deal with local counsel 
exclusively in all matters connected with the pending case.  If it 

becomes necessary to serve notice or process in the case, any notice 

or process served upon local counsel shall be deemed valid as if 

served on the out-of-state lawyer. 

3. Procedure for applying.  Appearance pro hac vice in a case 

is subject to the discretion and approval of the tribunal where such 

case is pending.  An out-of-state lawyer desiring to appear pro hac 

vice under this rule shall comply with the procedures set forth 

herein for each case in which pro hac vice status is requested.  For 

good cause shown, a tribunal may permit an out-of-state lawyer to 

appear pro hac vice on a temporary basis prior to completion by the 

out-of-state lawyer of the application procedures set forth herein.  

At the time such temporary admission is granted, the tribunal shall 

specify a time limit within which the out-of-state lawyer must 

complete the application procedures, and any temporary pro hac vice 

admission shall be revoked in the event the out-of-state lawyer 

fails to complete the application procedure within the time limit. 

 

 

(a) Notarized Application.  In order to appear pro hac vice as 

counsel in any matter pending before a tribunal in the Commonwealth 

of Virginia, an out-of-state lawyer shall deliver to local counsel 

to file with the tribunal an original notarized application and a 

non-refundable application fee of $250.00 payable to the Clerk of 

the Supreme Court.  Pro hac vice counsel must submit a notarized 

application with the non-refundable application fee of $250.00 for 

each separate case before a tribunal.  The fee shall be paid to the 

Clerk of the Supreme Court of Virginia.  The tribunal shall file a 
copy of the notarized application, as well as its order granting pro 

hac vice admission in the case and the $250.00 fee, with the Clerk 

of the Supreme Court of Virginia.  Original, notarized applications 

and orders granting, denying or revoking applications to appear pro 

hac vice shall be retained in a separate file containing all 

applications.  The clerk of the tribunal shall maintain the 

application for a period of three years after completion of the case 

and all appeals. 

 

(b) Motion to associate counsel pro hac vice.  Local counsel 

shall file a motion to associate the out-of-state lawyer as counsel 

pro hac vice with the tribunal where the case is pending, together 

with proof of service on all parties in accordance with the Rules of 

the Supreme Court of Virginia.  The motion of local counsel shall be 

accompanied by: (1) the original, notarized application of the out-

of-state lawyer; (2) a proposed order granting or denying the 

motion; and (3) the required application fee. 

 

2

 

(c) Entry of Order.  The order granting or denying the motion 

to associate counsel pro hac vice shall be entered by the tribunal 

promptly and a copy of the order shall be forwarded to the Clerk of 

the Supreme Court.  An out-of-state lawyer shall make no appearance 

in a case until the tribunal where the case is pending enters the 

order granting the motion to associate counsel pro hac vice unless 

temporary admission has been approved pursuant to this rule.  The 

order granting pro hac vice status shall be valid until the case is 

concluded in the courts of this Commonwealth or a court revokes the 

pro hac vice admission. 

4. Notarized Application.  The notarized application required 

by this rule shall be on a form approved by the Supreme Court of 

Virginia and available at the office of the clerk of the tribunal 

where the case is pending.   

5. Discretion and Limitation on Number of Matters.  The grant 

or denial of a motion pursuant to this rule by the tribunal is 

discretionary.  The tribunal shall deny the motion if the out-of-

state lawyer has been previously admitted pro hac vice before any 

tribunal or tribunals in Virginia in twelve (12) cases within the 

last twelve (12) months preceding the date of the current 

application.  In the enforcement of this limitation, the tribunal 

may consider whether the pending case is a related or consolidated 

matter for which the out-of-state lawyer has previously applied to 

appear pro hac vice.  Before ruling on a pro hac vice motion, the 

tribunal shall verify with the Supreme Court of Virginia the number 

of cases during the preceding twelve (12) months in which the out-

of-state lawyer was admitted in Virginia pro hac vice. 

6.  Transfer of Venue and Appeal.  The out-of-state lawyer’s 

pro hac vice admission shall be deemed to continue in the event the 

venue in the case or proceeding is transferred to another tribunal 

or is appealed; provided, however, that the tribunal having 

jurisdiction over such transferred or appealed case shall have the 

discretion to revoke the authority of the out-of-state lawyer to 

appear pro hac vice. 

 

3

7. Duty to Report Status.  An out-of-state lawyer admitted pro 

hac vice shall have a continuing obligation during the period of 

such admission to advise the tribunal promptly of any disposition 

made of pending disciplinary charges or the institution of any new 

disciplinary proceedings or investigations.  The tribunal shall 

advise the Clerk of the Supreme Court of Virginia if the tribunal 

denies or revokes the out-of-state lawyer’s permission to appear pro 

hac vice. 

8. Record-keeping.  The Clerk of the Supreme Court of Virginia 

will maintain an electronic database necessary for the 

administration and enforcement of this rule. 

9. Disciplinary Jurisdiction of the Virginia State Bar.  An 

out-of-state lawyer admitted pro hac vice pursuant to this rule 

shall be subject to the jurisdiction of all tribunals and agencies 

of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the Virginia State Bar, with 

respect to the laws and rules of Virginia governing the conduct and 

discipline of out-of-state lawyers to the same extent as an active 

member of the Virginia State Bar.  An applicant or out-of-state 

lawyer admitted pro hac vice may be disciplined in the same manner 

as a member of the Virginia State Bar. 

10. In-State Services Related to Out-of-State Proceedings.  

Subject to the requirements and limitations of Rule 5.5 of the 

Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct, an out-of-state lawyer may 

provide the following services without the entry of a pro hac vice 

order: 

(a) In connection with a proceeding pending outside of 

Virginia, an out-of-state lawyer admitted to appear in that 

proceeding may render legal services in Virginia pertaining to 

or in aid of such proceeding. 

 

4

(b) In connection with a case in which an out-of-state lawyer 

reasonably believes he is eligible for admission pro hac vice 

under this rule: (1) the out-of-state lawyer may consult in 

Virginia with a member of the Virginia State Bar concerning a 

pending or potential proceeding in Virginia; (2) the out-of-

state lawyer may, at the request of a person in Virginia 

contemplating or involved in a proceeding in Virginia, consult 

with that person about that person’s retention of the out-of-

state lawyer in connection with that proceeding; and (3) on 

behalf of a client residing in Virginia or elsewhere, the out-

of-state lawyer may render legal services in Virginia in 

preparation for a potential case to be filed in Virginia. 

(c) An out-of-state lawyer may render legal services to 

prepare for and participate in an ADR process, regardless of 

where the ADR process or proceeding is expected to take place 

or actually takes place.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
