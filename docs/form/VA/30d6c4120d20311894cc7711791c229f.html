The purpose of these Procedures is to provide a means of enforcing the Standards 
of Ethics and Professional Responsibility for Certified Mediators (hereinafter the 
“Standards”), the Guidelines for the Training and Certification of Court-Referred 
Mediators, the Guidelines for the Certification of Mediation Training Programs, 
and the Mentor Guidelines (hereinafter the “Guidelines”).  

These rules apply to all proceedings involving complaints filed on or after July 1, 
2011 against certified mediators in their capacities as mediators, trainers, and/or 
mentors. 

If a mediator’s certification is suspended or revoked under these Procedures, the 
mediator’s privileges to serve as a mentor or trainer shall also be suspended or 
revoked.  If the mediator’s privileges to serve as a mentor or trainer are suspended 
or revoked, his or her certification as a mediator may also be suspended or 
revoked.   

If the complaint involves the conduct of a certified mediator in a mediation, the 
complaint will not be considered until the mediation is concluded. 

If the complaint involves a procedure that is a combination of mediation with 
another dispute resolution process, such as arbitration, the scope of review under 
these Procedures is limited to the mediation portion of the proceeding. 

The role of the mediator differs substantially from other professional roles.  These 
Complaint Procedures do not apply to a certified mediator providing services in 
another professional role, unless it can be shown that the mediator was also 
clearly conducting mediation services, mediation mentoring services, mediation 
training services or the business of one of these services. 
 
See the “Initiation of a Complaint” section below for the time frame for filing a 
complaint.

INITIATION OF A COMPLAINT

a. 

The complaint procedure may be initiated by anyone with knowledge of the 
actions or behaviors raising concern, including any employee of OES.  A 
complaint must be in writing on the Mediation Complaint Form (OES Form 
ADR-1004).  The complaint must clearly identify:  1) the mediator, mentor or 
mediation trainer who is the subject of the complaint; 2) the person making the 
complaint; 3) the nature of any alleged misconduct or violation; 4) the date(s) the 
alleged misconduct or violation occurred; and 5) the complainant’s contact 
information. 

b. 

Any complaint must be received by DRS within two years of the alleged 
misconduct, except in unusual cases, where 1) the basis for the complaint was 

3 

 

 

. 

  3

 

 

  

discovered after the two-year period and could not reasonably have been 
discovered before and 2) the complaint alleges a serious ethical breach.  If a 
complaint is dismissed for lack of facial sufficiency, the complainant may initiate 
a new revised complaint if the time limit has not elapsed.  The time limitation for 
filing may also be tolled as set forth in paragraph 3.e. below. 

DRS will provide individuals who allege misconduct, violations or failure to 
comply with a Mediation Complaint Form (OES Form ADR-1004), and a copy of 
these Procedures, or direct them to the documents on the Virginia Judicial System 
website.  Where a comment on an evaluation form raises ethics issue(s), DRS may 
provide the commenting individual with the same form and document.   
 
DRS will notify the mediator, trainer or mentor of the complaint and will send 
him or her a copy of the complaint. 

        1)  If the respondent resigns his or her certification or allows it to lapse while 
he or she is the subject of a complaint or the complaint proceeding, that  
decision, and the circumstances surrounding the complaint, will be taken into  
consideration if and when the respondent reapplies for certification.  If and when 
the respondent becomes certified, DRS may reactivate the complaint proceeding.  
 
         2)  If a complaint is filed after the respondent resigns his or her certification 
or allows it to lapse, regarding an incident prior to the resignation or lapse, that 
decision to resign or allow certification to lapse, and the circumstances 
surrounding the complaint, will be taken into consideration if and when the 
respondent reapplies for certification.  The time limitation for filing set forth in 
paragraph 3.b. above is tolled from the date of resignation or lapse to the date the 
respondent becomes certified.   

A complaint may be dismissed upon a request by a complainant to withdraw his   
or her complaint only with the agreement of DRS. 

REVIEW OF COMPLAINTS 

 

a.        Once DRS receives a complaint, it shall first determine whether it has       
jurisdiction to consider the complaint.  If DRS does not have jurisdiction,  
the complaint will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and no further action will  
be taken.  DRS will notify the complainant and respondent of the dismissal in 
writing. 

 

Once jurisdiction is established, an intake attorney will review the complaint to 
determine whether, assuming the allegations were true, the complaint as written is 
facially sufficient to state a claim that the respondent has violated or failed to 
comply with the Guidelines and/or the Standards.

The intake attorney may in his or her discretion refer the complaint to the  
Complaint Review Panel to make the determination of facial sufficiency and carry  
out all the functions of DRS described in this Section. Two (2) out of three (3) 
members of the Complaint Review Panel shall constitute a quorum.  Decisions of 
the Panel shall be made by a majority of those present.   

If the complaint would not constitute a violation of or failure to comply with the 
Guidelines and/or the Standards, assuming the allegations were found to be true, 
the complaint will be dismissed, and no further action will be taken.  DRS will 
notify the complainant and the respondent of the decision in writing.  If DRS 
dismisses the complaint, but believes remedial action or training may be 
beneficial, DRS may suggest that the respondent voluntarily participate in 
appropriate training or mentorship.   

.         If the complaint asserts facts that would, if true, constitute a violation of or failure 
to comply with the Guidelines or the Standards, DRS will send a letter indicating 
the nature of the concerns to the respondent with a copy to the complainant.  The 
respondent has twenty (20) calendar days from the date of the DRS letter to send a 
written response to DRS with a copy to the complainant.   

If DRS receives no written response from the respondent within five (5) calendar 
days after expiration of the twenty (20)-day time period, DRS may immediately 
suspend the respondent’s mediator and/or trainer certification and/or mentor status 
pending resolution of the complaint.          

If the written response addresses the concerns to DRS’s satisfaction, DRS may 
dismiss the complaint.  DRS will notify the complainant and the respondent of the 
decision in writing.  If DRS dismisses the complaint but believes remedial action 
or training may be beneficial, DRS may suggest that the respondent voluntarily 
participate in appropriate training or mentorship.   

If DRS receives no written response from the respondent within the allotted time 
period, or if the response does not adequately address the concerns of DRS, DRS 
shall decide whether further information is necessary to determine how to 
proceed.  If so, DRS staff will investigate the facts stated in the complaint.  The 
investigation may include, but need not be limited to, review of any relevant 
documents and interviews of parties and witnesses.   

)  If after investigation, DRS determines the complaint is unfounded, DRS 

may dismiss the complaint and notify the parties in writing of the 
dismissal.   

)  If DRS determines no further information is necessary, or if the

1)  If the meeting results in resolution of the complaint to the satisfaction of 
the parties and DRS, DRS shall not refer the matter to the Complaint 
Hearing Committee, unless and until it determines the respondent is not 
complying with the requirements, if any, of the facilitated resolution.  
Once the respondent has complied fully with the requirements, if any, the 
facilitated resolution shall become the final disposition of the complaint, 
and DRS shall so notify the parties in writing.  

)  If the meeting with a third party neutral does not result in resolution of the 
complaint to the satisfaction of the parties and DRS, DRS shall refer the 
complaint to the Complaint Hearing Committee and so notify the parties in 
writing.

investigation does not find the complaint to be unfounded, DRS may  
(i) refer the complaint to the Complaint Hearing Committee, or 
(ii) elect an option from subsections i. and j. below. 

 

Upon agreement of the complainant and the respondent, DRS may refer the 
complaint matter to a third party neutral for a facilitated meeting.  

.          If DRS determines that the complaint is best addressed by remedial action, 

training or mentorship, then DRS may send a letter notifying the respondent that, 
based on the facts asserted in the complaint and the respondent’s response, DRS 
proposes that the respondent agree in writing to specific terms and conditions, 
which may include, but are not limited to, any combination of sanctions listed in 
Section 8, to be completed within a specified period of time.  The respondent 
must send a written response to DRS’s proposal within ten (10) calendar days 
from the date thereof, indicating whether he or she accepts or rejects the proposed 
terms and conditions. The written response must be received by DRS within five 
(5) calendar days after expiration of the ten (10)-day time period. 

1)  If the respondent agrees in writing to the specified terms and conditions, 
DRS shall not refer the complaint to the Complaint Hearing Committee, 
unless and until it determines that the respondent is not complying with 
the agreed terms and conditions.  Once the respondent has complied fully, 
the specified terms and conditions shall become the final disposition of the 
complaint, and DRS shall so notify the parties in writing. 

)  If the respondent does not accept the proposed terms and conditions, DRS 
shall refer the matter to the Complaint Hearing Committee and so notify 
the parties in writing.

(i) 

  (

Such complaints, dispositions, reports, information or records shall be considered 
personnel records and shall not be available for discovery or as evidence in any 
civil action, except by order of a court that has taken into consideration the 
confidentiality of the mediation process. 

For educational or research purposes, DRS may disclose a general description of 
the nature of the complaint and its resolution so long as the disclosures protect the 
anonymity of the respondent and any mediation participants.  

DRS will retain indefinitely the Disciplinary Records of any certified mediators, 
trainers or mentors.  DRS may retain records regarding dismissed complaints. 

 
THE HEARING 

The Complaint Hearing Committee shall conduct a proceeding that is private and  
is not open to the public.  The parties may present witnesses, documents and other  
information that would be supportive of their position and helpful to the Hearing  
Committee in making its decision.  Both the respondent and the complainant may 
bring counsel or a support person to the hearing.  The Complaint Hearing 
Committee may elect to take testimony by telephone when appropriate, taking into 
consideration the cost and inconvenience of the witness appearing, and any cost, 
inconvenience and prejudice to the respondent. The Complaint Hearing 
Committee may elect to sequester witnesses.  If any party fails to appear or to 
participate in good faith, the Complaint Hearing Committee may proceed on the 
evidence before it.  If the complainant fails to appear, the Committee may dismiss 
the complaint for want of prosecution.  

DRS, the respondent, or the Complaint Hearing Committee may record the 
hearing electronically or by transcription.  The entity seeking the recording will 
bear the cost of and the responsibility for the recording.  Such record and/or 
transcript shall be made available to DRS, the respondent, the Complaint Hearing 
Committee, and to the Executive Secretary in the event of an appeal.  Any 
recording and/or transcript shall be governed by the confidentiality requirements 
in Section 6 above. 

The rules of civil procedure and rules of evidence do not apply, but may serve as a 
guide for the Complaint Hearing Committee.   

If, after the hearing, the majority of the Complaint Hearing Committee finds that 
clear and convincing evidence establishes a violation of or failure to comply with

the Guidelines and/or the Standards, the Complaint Hearing Committee may 
impose any of the sanctions included in Section 8 below as it deems appropriate.  
If the respondent against whom a violation or failure to comply has been found 
has a Disciplinary Record, the facts and circumstances giving rise to such 
Disciplinary Record may be disclosed (1) to the Complaint Hearing Committee 
upon its request and (2) by the Complaint Hearing Committee in its letter 
decision.  If the Complaint Hearing Committee does not find that clear and 
convincing evidence establishes a violation or failure to comply, it shall dismiss 
the complaint. 

The Complaint Hearing Committee shall make its decision and file a copy of its 
written decision with DRS within thirty (30) calendar days after the close of the 
hearing.  DRS shall promptly mail to the respondent and complainant notice of 
such filing and a copy of the decision.  If no request for reconsideration by the 
Executive Secretary of the Committee’s decision is received from the respondent 
by the expiration of the time period allotted for such requests, the decision of the 
Complaint Hearing Committee shall become the final disposition of the 
complaint. 

If the Complaint Hearing Committee determines that sanctions are warranted, it 
may impose sanctions to be completed within a specified period of time, 
including, but not limited to, any one or more of the following: 

a. 

. 

  b

sending a formal letter identifying the corrective action necessary; 

notwithstanding the confidentiality requirements of Section 6 above, 
notifying the dispute resolution center, court, or other entity with which 
the respondent is affiliated, of sanction of suspended certification or 
decertification; 

requiring one or more consultations or co-mediations with a mentor 
selected from the list maintained by DRS; 

requiring group or individual training;  

restriction of certification by curtailment or modification of the type of 
cases to be mediated, mentored, or of the courses to be taught in the future; 

suspension of certification or mentor status for a specified term; 

1) 

2) 

3)

) 

c.         In those instances in which a sanction less than decertification has been imposed  
            by the Complaint Hearing Committee and DRS determines that the respondent  
has not complied with the sanction, DRS may suspend the respondent’s  
 
certification until compliance has been achieved.  If the respondent objects to this  
 
suspension, he or she may, within ten (10) days of notice of his or her suspension, 
request a hearing before the Complaint Hearing Committee on the limited issue of 
whether he or she has complied with the sanctions.  The Complaint Hearing 
Committee shall convene within sixty (60) days and deliver a written decision 
within thirty (30) days thereafter.  A decision by the Complaint Hearing 
Committee is final. 
 

If sanctions are imposed by the Complaint Hearing Committee, the respondent 
may within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of the notice of filing request 
reconsideration by the Executive Secretary.  The written request must be received 
by the Executive Secretary within five (5) calendar days after expiration of the 
fifteen (15)-day time period. 

Upon receipt of a request for reconsideration, the Executive Secretary shall review 
all documents and other information that was considered by the Complaint  
Hearing Committee.  Review shall be limited to the issues raised before the 
Complaint Hearing Committee.  The Executive Secretary may return the 
complaint to the Complaint Hearing Committee, affirm the imposition of 
sanctions, or dismiss the complaint.  The factual findings of the Complaint 
Hearing Committee shall be accepted unless clearly erroneous and the conclusions 
of law, including the sanctions, shall be reviewed de novo.  This decision of the 
Executive Secretary is final and shall be set forth in a letter to the respondent, 
complainant and the Complaint Hearing Committee.  
     

c.         Any decision of the Complaint Hearing Committee is stayed pending  

reconsideration by the Executive Secretary, or where the Executive Secretary 
returns the complaint to the Complaint Hearing Committee, pending 
reconsideration by the Complaint Hearing Committee.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
