INSTRUCTIONS FOR NOTICE OF DETERMINATION OF CONTROLLING ORDER 

URPOSE OF THE FORM:  This notice provides a standard format for alerting entities in other 

jurisdictions about a controlling order determination.  The actual determination will likely be in a State-
specific format (e.g., order or form) which may be attached to the standard Notice of Determination of
Controlling Order.  
 
Complete this notice when your State’s tribunal makes a determination of controlling order.  Generally, 
this form only needs to be used when there are multiple orders governing the same 
obligor/obligee/child(ren). 

f multiple orders governing the same obligor, obligee, and child(ren) exist, a State can only prospectively 
enforce or modify the "controlling order" in a UIFSA proceeding.  UIFSA contains rules for determining 
which order is recognized when multiple orders exist.  Under these rules: 

The order issued by a tribunal with continuing, exclusive jurisdiction (CEJ) has priority.  An issuing 
tribunal retains CEJ if the issuing State remains the residence of the obligor, individual obligee, or child, 
or until all parties file written consent with the tribunal allowing another State to modify the order. 

If more than one issuing tribunal would have CEJ, the order issued by the child's Home State has priority.  
"Child Home State" is the State where the child has lived for the prior consecutive 6 months before filing 
the UIFSA action, or, if the child is under 6 months of age, since birth. 

.  If more than one tribunal would have CEJ but there is no order in the child's home State, the 

most recently issued order has priority. 

.  If no tribunal would have CEJ, the responding State must issue a new support order and it becomes the 

controlling order.

hile only the controlling order should be recognized for prospective enforcement, arrears that accrued 

under other orders may still be enforced. 

You must use the Notice of Determination of Controlling Order to notify:  

the initiating IV-D agency if you are acting as a responding jurisdiction in an interstate action,  

any tribunal that has issued, registered, or is enforcing a child support order governing the same parties 
and child(ren),

any IV-D agency with an open or closed IV-D case for the parties, 

a party to the order (i.e., the obligor or obligee), as appropriate, or  

a central registry in another State.  It may be particularly important to notify a central entity if it keeps a 
registry of all orders in that State.  A central registry may also be willing to notify tribunals or agencies 
within that State.

use to identify the case, if known. 

In the space marked "From:", list a contact person, agency name, address (street, city, State, zip code), 
phone number (including extension), fax number, and e-mail address. 

In the appropriate spaces, enter your jurisdiction's FIPS code, State, IV-D case number, and tribunal 
number.  Under “IV-D case number”,  enter the unique identifier the State uses for interjurisdictional

INSTRUCTIONS FOR LOCATE DATA SHEET 

PURPOSE OF THE FORM:  The Locate Data Sheet is used by a IV-D agency for requesting locate 
information (regarding either parent, employer, wages, assets) from another State.  The requesting 
jurisdiction completes as much of the form as possible with the information it has. 

In addition to the more common data elements specified on the Locate Data Sheet, space is provided to 
note other locate/asset information particular to the case.  For example, information on wages, violence 
potential, military/veteran status, and relatives may prove useful in working a case. 

USE CSENET IF AN AGREEMENT IS IN PLACE.

Quick Locate. The Locate Data Sheet is used to request "quick locate." You may send the request directly 
to the responding State's Parent Locator Service.  "Quick locate" is useful if a State believes that a parent 
may be in one of several States, but is unsure of which State.  If a State intends to use its long-arm 
jurisdiction to establish or enforce an order, it may choose to use "quick locate" to confirm the parent's 
location. 

HEADING/CAPTION: 

Identify the petitioner and respondent in the appropriate spaces. 

Check the appropriate space to identify the type of case: TANF; IV-E Foster Care; Medicaid only; 
former assistance, never assistance. TANF means the obligee's family receives IV-A cash or "Non 
IV-D case"  payments.  A Medicaid only case is a case where the obligee's family receives 
Medicaid but does not receive TANF (IV-A cash payments). 

In the space marked "To:", list the name and address (street, city, State, and zip code) of the 
central registry or agency where you are sending the Locate Data Sheet. 

In the space marked "From:", list a contact person, agency name, address (street, city, State, zip 
code), phone number (including extension), fax number, and e-mail address. 

In the appropriate spaces, enter the Initiating jurisdiction's FIPS code, State, IV-D case number, and 
tribunal number.  Under “IV-D case number”, enter the number/identifier identical to the one 
submitted on the Federal Case Registry, which is a left-justified 15-character alphanumeric field, 
allowing all characters except asterisk and backslash, and with all characters in uppercase.  Under 
tribunal number, you may enter the docket number, cause number, or any other appropriate 
reference number which the initiating tribunal or agency has assigned to the case. 

BODY OF FORM: 

Check the appropriate box to indicate whether the locate information pertains to the "Non Custodial 
Parent" or "Custodial Parent".  Check the box for "Possibly Dangerous" if the party may be 
dangerous. 

Provide as much information about the party as possible. 

For "Full Name", enter the party's complete name (First, Middle, Last). 

Provide "Social Security Number(s)", if known; this information is vital. 

Enter the party's "Alias", "Maiden Name", or "Mother's Maiden or Father's Name" if known and

INSTRUCTIONS FOR AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF ESTABLISHING PATERNITY 

 
 
  
PURPOSE OF THE FORM:  This affidavit supplements the Uniform Support Petition to summarize 
evidence to establish paternity.  A separate Affidavit in Support of Establishing Paternity is required for 
each child needing paternity establishment.  This is necessary since the circumstances surrounding 
conception and birth will differ unless the children are twins.  Reminder: A putative father may petition for 
paternity establishment under UIFSA.  All appropriate information for the Affidavit in Support of 
Establishing Paternity must be completed or furnished by the parent, properly signed by the parent, and 
notarized as required. A separate Affidavit is required for each allegation of paternity.  
   
HEADING/CAPTION:  [To be completed by the Child Support (IV-D) Worker] 
 

 

Identify the petitioner and respondent in the appropriate spaces. 

Check the appropriate space to identify the type of case: TANF; IV-E Foster Care, Medicaid only; 
former assistance, never assistance, or Non-IV-D. TANF means the obligee's family receives IV-A 
cash payments.  A Medicaid only case is a case where the obligee's family receives Medicaid but 
does not receive TANF (IV-A cash payments). 

Under "Responding IV-D Case No." and "Responding Tribunal No.", enter appropriate case and 
tribunal numbers that the responding State uses to identify the case, if applicable and if known.  
Under “IV-D case number”, enter the number/identifier identical to the one submitted on the 
Federal Case Registry, which is a left-justified 15-character alphanumeric field, allowing all 
characters except asterisk and backslash, and with all characters in uppercase.  Under "tribunal 
number", you may enter the docket number, cause number, or any other appropriate reference 
number. 

Under "Initiating IV-D Case No." and "Initiating Tribunal No.", enter appropriate case and tribunal 
numbers which your IV-D agency or local tribunal has assigned to the case.   Under “IV-D case 
number”, enter the number/identifier identical to the one submitted on the Federal Case Registry, 
which is a left-justified 15-character alphanumeric field, allowing all characters except asterisk and 
backslash, and with all characters in uppercase.  Under "tribunal number", you may enter the 
docket number, cause number, or any other appropriate reference number.  

Enter the "Child's Full Legal Name", "Child's Date of Birth", and "Place of Birth". 

"Date Mother Got Pregnant" - Enter the period of time when you believe the mother 
became pregnant (e.g., 4/89 or from 4/89 to 5/89).  Be sure to include both the month (or 
months) and the year when providing date(s).  Be as specific as possible. 

"Full Term Pregnancy" - Check "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether or not the pregnancy     
lasted nine months.  If no, explain (e.g., 6 months--child born premature). 

"Where Mother Got Pregnant" - List the City, County, and State. 

“Mother’s Maiden Name” - Enter the mother’s maiden name, if known. 

Enter the full name (First, Middle, Last) of the parent or other individual completing the affidavit.

Page 1 of 4

Item 2:  Enter the name of the child's other parent in the blank.  This is the person with whom you (the 
parent completing the affidavit) had sexual intercourse which resulted in the child's conception.  
 

Item 3: The information in item 3 is intended to identify whether there is a presumed or legal father under 
State law.  State laws differ on whether and how a presumption of paternity is created.

Item 3a:  Check "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether or not a man is named as the child's father on the 
child's birth certificate.  If "Yes", attach a certified copy of the birth certificate and provide the man's 
name and address.  The man may be the same man who is named as the father of the child in this 
affidavit, or he may be a different man.  NOTE:  Some responding States may only need a regular copy, 
rather than a certified copy of this document.

Item 3b:  Check "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether or not a man was married to the child's natural mother 
and the child's birth occurred within a year of the end of the marriage. Include the date the marriage 
ended.  If "Yes", provide the man's name and address.  The man may be the same man who is named as 
the father of the child in this affidavit, or he may be a different man. 

Item 3c:  Check “Yes” or “No” to indicate whether a man signed an acknowledgment of paternity before an 
acknowledgment became a legal finding of paternity under State law.  If “Yes”, attach a certified copy 
of the acknowledgment.  The man may be the same man who is named as the father of the child in this 
affidavit, or he may be a different man.   NOTE:  Some responding States may only need a regular copy, 
rather than a certified copy of this document. 

Item 3d:  Check "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether or not a man acted as and presented himself to be the 
child's father.  If "Yes", provide the man's name and address.  The man may be the same man who is 
named as the father of the child in this affidavit, or he may be a different man. 

Item 3e:  Check "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether or not genetic tests (e.g., blood tests) were completed to 
determine the biological father of the child.  If "Yes", attach the test results. 

ECTION II:  (To be completed by Mother Only) 

  
Item 1:  Check "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether you (the mother) did or did not have sexual intercourse 
(sex) with another man or other men during the 30 days before or the 30 days after the child was 
conceived ("Date Mother Got Pregnant").   

f you had sexual intercourse with another man or other men during this period (30 days before or 30 days 
after), complete items 1a through 1c.   

  S

  I

Item 1a:  Provide the name(s) and address(es) of the other man/men. 

Item 1b:  Check "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether the other man/men are biologically related to the 
alleged father.  If "Yes", state the relationship (e.g., brother, cousin, etc).  This may be relevant to 
genetic testing.   

Item 1c:  Explain why you do not believe the other man/men is/are the father of this child (e.g., 
prior exclusion by genetic testing).   

Item 2:  Check "Yes" or "No" to indicate whether or not you were married at the time of the child's birth.  If 
"Yes", complete items 2a and 2b. 

Item 2a:  Provide the name and last known address of the man who was your husband at the time 
of the child's birth. 

Item 2b:  Explain why the husband is not the father.  Attach appropriate documents.

Item 3:  Be sure to enter the name of the father of this child.  Check the appropriate answer for each 
statement (a - r) to support the allegations of paternity against the alleged father.  Remember to attach any 
necessary, relevant documentation.  This includes a certified copy of the birth certificate or the 
acknowledgment of paternity with the alleged father's name on it; and other documents if available (e.g., 
letters or cards from the alleged father regarding the pregnancy or the child).  NOTE: some responding 
States may only need a regular copy, rather than a certified copy, of these documents. 

SECTION III:  (To be completed by Father Only) 

eminder: A putative father may petition for paternity establishment under UIFSA. 

Check the appropriate answer for each statement (a - o).  Remember to attach any necessary, relevant 
documentation.  This includes a certified copy of the birth certificate or acknowledgment of paternity with your 
name as the child's father on it;  and other documents if available (e.g., letters or cards from the mother 
regarding the pregnancy or the child).  NOTE: some responding States may only need a regular copy of a birth 
certificate or paternity acknowledgment, rather than a certified copy. 

SECTION IV:  Provide any additional information not already covered which might be helpful in 
establishing paternity.  One example would be the alleged father's attendance in a child birth class with the 
mother. 

f you are the mother, provide details to "Yes" answers to item 3, statements l through r  in Section II.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR UNIFORM SUPPORT PETITION

PURPOSE OF THE FORM:  The Uniform Support Petition is a legal pleading needed for the responding 
State to initiate action.  Its purposes are to show how the tribunal has jurisdiction, to show enough facts to 
notify the respondent of the claim being made, and to provide the petitioner with a means to request 
specific action or relief.  Additional information can be provided in the accompanying affidavits and other 
attachments. 

HEADING/CAPTION: 

Identify the Petitioner and Respondent names in the appropriate spaces. 

Check the appropriate space to identify the type of case: TANF; IV-E Foster Care, Medicaid only; 
former assistance, never assistance, or Non-IV-D. TANF  means the obligee's family receives IV-A 
cash payments.  A Medicaid only case is a case where the obligee's family receives Medicaid but 
does not receive TANF (IV-A cash payments). 

Under "Responding IV-D Case No." and "Responding Tribunal No.", enter appropriate case and 
tribunal numbers that the responding State uses to identify the case, if applicable and if known.  
Under “IV-D case number”, enter the number/identifier identical to the one submitted on the 
Federal Case Registry, which is a left-justified 15-character alphanumeric field, allowing all 
characters except asterisk and backslash, and with all characters in uppercase.  Under "tribunal 
number", you may enter the docket number, cause number, or any other appropriate reference 
number. 

Under "Initiating IV-D Case No." and "Initiating Tribunal No.", enter appropriate case and tribunal  
numbers which your IV-D agency or local tribunal has assigned to the case.  Under “IV-D case 
number”, enter the number/identifier identical to the one submitted on the Federal Case Registry, 
which is a left-justified 15-character alphanumeric field, allowing all characters except asterisk and 
backslash, and with all characters in uppercase.  Under "tribunal number", you may enter the 
docket number, cause number, or any other appropriate reference number. 

SECTION I, ACTION:  List the children on whose behalf the action in the petition is requested.  Include 
each child's full legal name (First, Middle, Last), date of birth, and Social Security Number. 

Check the appropriate boxes to indicate which actions are requested.  Multiple actions may be requested, 
as appropriate. 

Check "Establishment of Paternity" to request that paternity be established.  In a IV-D case, ask 
another State to establish paternity only if use of long-arm jurisdiction is not available or appropriate. 
Be sure to attach an "Affidavit in Support of Establishing Paternity" for each child whose paternity is 
at issue. 

Check "Establishment of Order for" to request that an order be established.  Indicate the type of 
order by checking the appropriate box. 

Check "Current Child Support, Including Medical Support" to request the establishment of a new 
child support order.  If an order governing the same obligor, obligee, and child(ren) already exists, 
you should generally request the establishment of a new order only if: (1) there is more than one 
existing order, (2) the obligor, obligee, and child have all moved out of the issuing State, and (3) 
the parties have not filed written consent allowing an issuing State to assert jurisdiction.  

Uniform Support Petition 

Page 1 of 3 

Check "Retroactive Child Support" if seeking support for a prior period.  States may establish child 
support awards covering a prior period, but such awards must be based on guidelines and take 
into consideration either the current earnings and income at the time the order is set, or the 
obligor's earnings and income during the prior period.  The award of back support is not required 
under Federal rules, but may be appropriate in accordance with State  law.  Not all States have 
authority to establish support orders for prior periods.  The law of the order State governs the 
extent to which retroactive support is available. A medical support provision must be included in 
any new or modified order in a IV-D case. 

Check "Medical Support Only" in a Medicaid case where a child support order does not exist 
and is not sought.  If seeking to add medical support to an existing child support order, check 
the box for "Modification of a Support Order." 

Check "Spousal Support" to request establishment of a spousal support order.  Do not check this 
item in a IV-D case; establishment of spousal support is not a IV-D function.  When requesting 
establishment of spousal support, contact the support enforcement agency for the appropriate 
procedure. 

Check "Costs and Fees" to request an order for costs, such as costs of the delivery of the child and 
other medical costs not covered by insurance, or any fees.  Provide testimony regarding the type 
and amount of these costs or fees. 

Check "Modification of a Support Order" to request modification of an existing order. 

If you are requesting modification of an order that was issued by the responding State, in most 
instances you do not need to complete a Uniform Support Petition.  On the other hand, if you are 
requesting modification of an order that was issued by a State other than the responding State, a 
Uniform Support Petition is usually necessary. 

If multiple orders exist, do not ask the responding State to modify an order unless that order is the 
"controlling order" that has priority under UIFSA.  UIFSA contains rules for determining which order 
is recognized when multiple orders exist. 

Check “Determination of Controlling Order and Arrears Reconciliation" if you are requesting this 
action. 

Check "Other Remedy Sought" if you are requesting an action not listed in section I.  Specify in the 
space provided what remedy you are requesting. 

SECTION II, GROUNDS FOR REMEDY SOUGHT: 

In those cases where the respondent is the noncustodial parent of the children named in the 
petition, check the first box in section II of the petition.  If appropriate, indicate when support 
payments stopped by checking “child’s birth” or by checking the second box and providing a date. 

Grounds (reasons) for remedy sought are required in actions to register an out-of-state child 
support order for modification.  If you are using the petition to request a modification, check the 
second box under section II of the petition. 

Check “Existence of valid multiple orders” as grounds if a tribunal determination of controlling order 
or a reconciliation of arrears is sought. 

Grounds for remedy sought are also required when seeking a remedy that must be affirmatively 
sought under the responding State's law. 

Uniform Support Petition 

Page 2 of 3 

SECTION III, ADDITIONAL SUPPORTING INFORMATION: 

Check the appropriate boxes to indicate which documents are being sent with the petition.  If you 
are sending forms with the petition that are not specifically identified in this section, mark the 
"Other" box and list the additional forms in the space provided. 

SECTION IV, VERIFICATION: 

The petition must be verified by the petitioner.  Check the box under this part and have the 
petitioner (obligee, guardian, putative father, or authorized IV-D representative) sign and date the 
form. 

The petitioner's signature always requires a notary whether or not the petitioner is represented by 
an attorney. 

UIFSA allows a party to retain independent counsel.  If the petitioner is represented by a private 
attorney, obtain the attorney's signature and Bar Number (if applicable) in the space provided in 
this part.

included with the other appropriate forms and directed to the responding State's central registry.  In non-
IV-D cases, contact the responding State central registry to determine appropriate procedures.  It is 
important to remember that a separate Registration Statement is needed for each order that the initiating 
State is requesting be registered by the responding State. 

HEADING/CAPTION:   

ACTION:

The initiating jurisdiction adds its IV-D case and tribunal numbers to the heading, at the space available.  The 
responding jurisdiction will add its IV-D case and Tribunal numbers to the heading after receiving the form 
from the initiating jurisdiction.  Under initiating and responding “IV-D case number”, enter the number/identifier 
identical to the one submitted on the Federal Case Registry, which is a left-justified 15-character alphanumeric 
field, allowing all characters except asterisk and backslash, and with all characters in uppercase.

Check the appropriate box indicating whether you are registering this order for enforcement or 
modification. NOTE that registration for enforcement should be accompanied by Transmittal #1. 
Registration for modification should be accompanied by Transmittal #1, Uniform Support Petition, and 
General Testimony.

SECTION I, CASE SUMMARY

Provide complete information for all court/administrative actions regarding support for dependents.  Use 
a separate Registration Statement form for each court/administrative order you are requesting be 
registered.   For the listed order, under "Period of Computation", enter the month, day, and year for both 
the beginning of the current support obligation and the end date of the computation.  The information in 
this section will be used to aid in verifying calculated arrearages and to assist in determining/verifying 
which order is controlling and which State has continuing exclusive jurisdiction.  The arrears 
statement/payment history must support this calculation.  If this order was determined by a tribunal to be 
the controlling order, check the appropriate box.  If this is the only  order, check "Only order".

Attach the required number of copies of all pertinent orders that relate to support. You will generally need 
to attach two copies, one of which is certified, of any support order. NOTE, however, that some 
responding States may be able to take certain administrative enforcement actions (e.g., interstate 
income withholding) without having a certified copy of the order, although a regular copy is necessary. 

SECTION II, MOTHER INFORMATION:   

This section provides basic information about the child(ren)'s mother.  Check the appropriate box to 
indicate if the mother is the obligor or obligee.  Provide the mother's full name (first, middle, last) as well 
as aliases and maiden name, and all other information.  Provide the name and full address of the 
mother's employer.  If the mother's name does not match with the court or administrative order, explain in 
Section V. 

Registration Statement 

Page 1 of 2 

SECTION III, FATHER INFORMATION:   

This section provides basic information about the child(ren)'s father.  Check the appropriate box to 
indicate if the father is the obligor or obligee.  Provide the father's full name (first, middle, last) as well as 
aliases, and all other information.  Provide the name and full address of the father's employer.   If the 
father's name does not match with the court or administrative order, explain in Section V.  

SECTION IV, CARETAKER (IF NOT A PARENT):   

Complete this section only if the child(ren)'s caretaker is not the child(ren)'s parent.  In the space labelled 
"Relationship to Child(ren)", indicate the relationship of the caretaker to the child(ren).  Provide the 
caretaker's full name (first, middle, last) as well as aliases or maiden name, and all other information.  
Indicate whether the caretaker has legal custody/guardianship of child(ren), if known. 

SECTION V, ADDITIONAL CASE INFORMATION:   

In this section, provide additional information which may be useful to the responding jurisdiction in 
working the case, such as a complete listing of all States where the child support order has previously 
been registered and a description, including the location, of all known property or assets not exempt from 
execution.   In addition to the requested information, use this portion of the form to provide other 
information which may assist the responding jurisdiction in its efforts to register the order. 

SECTION VI, VERIFICATION / CERTIFICATION: 

The Registration Statement may be signed by either the party seeking registration or an 
authorized IV-D representative/records custodian.  Check the appropriate box to indicate who 
has signed this form.    

The verification signature requires a notary.

rights or to turn over to the State the right to child support payments paid by the obligated parent.

V-E Foster Care means the child is in IV-E foster care and the case has been referred to the State/local 
child support agency to obtain support from the parents. 

edicaid Only means that the obligee is not receiving public assistance (IV-A cash payments) but is 

receiving Medicaid.  Medicaid is a federally-funded program that provides medical support for low income 
families.  These cases can receive "Full Services" or "Medical Services Only".   

ormer Assistance means that the obligee received child support enforcement services while receiving IV-

A cash payments but is no longer receiving these payments. 

ever Assistance means that the obligee applied for child support enforcement services but has  not 

received public assistance (IV-A cash payments).   

on IV-D means the case is a private case that is not being worked by the State or local child support 

enforcement or IV-D agency. 

Under "Responding IV-D Case No." and "Responding Tribunal No.", enter appropriate case and tribunal 
 
numbers that the responding State uses to identify the case, if applicable and if known.  Under “IV-D case 
number”, enter the number/identifier identical to the one submitted on the Federal Case Registry, which is a 
left-justified 15-character alphanumeric field, allowing all characters except asterisk and backslash, and 
with all characters in uppercase.  Under "tribunal number", you may  enter the docket number, cause 
number, or any other appropriate reference number. 

 
Under "Initiating IV-D Case No." and "Initiating Tribunal No.", enter appropriate case and tribunal numbers 
which your IV-D agency or local tribunal has assigned to the case.  Under “IV-D case number”,  enter the 
number/identifier identical to the one submitted on the Federal Case Registry, which is a left-justified 15-
character alphanumeric field, allowing all characters except asterisk and backslash, and with all characters in 
uppercase.  Under "tribunal number", you may enter the docket number, cause number, or any other 
appropriate reference number.  

heck the appropriate boxes to indicate whether the petitioner is the "Obligee", "Obligor", or "Caretaker 

Other than Parent", or whether this is a "Foster Care" case.  Check the appropriate boxes for the 
Respondent as well. 
 

Obligee is the individual or State agency who is owed or is alleged to be owed support.  If an obligee 
receives TANF benefits, s/he assigns certain support rights to the State. 

Obligor is the individual who owes or is alleged to owe support.  This term includes alleged or 
putative fathers whose paternity of the child(ren) has not yet been established. 

Caretaker Other than Parent is an individual who is custodian of the child(ren) but who is not the 
mother or father of the child(ren). 

Foster Care indicates that the child is in foster care.  In such cases, a State or political subdivision 
may seek support from both parents. 

n the name-block immediately above section I, fill in the name (First, Middle, Last) of the individual 
providing the testimony and signing the form.  In most cases this will be the individual obligee.  However, it 
could also be an obligor seeking paternity establishment or modification of a support order, or an 
authorized child support worker if the form is completed with information from the file.  Note that verification 
by an individual petitioner is required for information personally known to him/her, and that testimony is 
given under penalty of perjury.

You are seeking reimbursement for medical assistance costs. 

therwise, skip to section IX, Financial Information. 

omplete items 1 and 2 only if you are seeking support for a prior period (i.e., if you are seeking "back 
support" or support for a period prior to the establishment of an order).  The award of support for a prior 
period is not required under Federal law but may be appropriate in accordance with State law.  Not all 
States have authority to establish support orders for prior periods.  However, the period of time the family 
received TANF benefits may be a relevant factor in setting an award for a prior period; this section 
provides space for this information. 
       
States may not, as a federally-reimbursable function, establish judgments solely for reimbursement of 
public assistance, or pursue enforcement of such judgments established after March 22, 1993.  States 
must use guidelines as a rebuttable presumption, not the amount of unreimbursed public assistance, in 
establishing orders after October 13, 1989.  States may establish child support awards covering a prior 
period, but such awards must be based on guidelines and take into consideration either the current 
earnings and income at the time the order is set, or the obligor's earnings and income during the prior 
period.     

tem 1:  If known, specify the period of time when TANF/Foster Care benefits were paid to the obligee's 
family, and the State which provided the assistance and had an assignment of support rights.  Only 
consider public assistance paid to the obligee or the children in this action (listed in section V). 
     
Item 2:  If known, enter the total amount of TANF/Foster Care benefits paid, and the date as of which the 
amount was correct.  Only include public assistance paid to the obligee or the children in this action (listed 
in section V). 

tem 3:  Complete item 3 only if you are seeking reimbursement for medical assistance related to prenatal, 
postnatal or general expenses. Enter the dollar amount of medical expenses for which you are seeking 
reimbursement.  Enter the name of the agency or person who paid the medical expenses and is due 
reimbursement.  Attach appropriate proof or documentation, such as receipts. 

ECTION IX, FINANCIAL INFORMATION:  This section is used to obtain the petitioner’s financial 

information needed to apply guidelines to determine the appropriate amount of support.   

enerally, you only need to complete this section if you are requesting establishment of an order or 

modification of an existing order, unless a responding State specifically asks for section IX to be completed 
to enforce an order.  It is important to disclose all the information pertaining to income, expenses, and 
assets, as required by the responding State's guidelines.  Failure to disclose information may seriously

heck the other boxes to indicate any other items that are attached, including:  a copy of the certified child 

support payment records; copies of the three most recent pay stubs from the current employer; copies of 
bills for prenatal, postnatal, or general health care of mother and child; assignment or subrogation of 
support rights; "Affidavit in Support of Establishing Paternity"; copy of child(ren)'s birth certificates; an 
acknowledgment of parentage; documentation of legal custody/guardianship of child(ren); documentation 
that child(ren) are in foster care; and any other attachments (such as copies of bills for parentage testing or 
the common law statute of the initiating State).  
 

"Affidavit in Support of Establishing Paternity" is a standard interstate form completed by the moving 
party [usually child(ren)'s mother or alleged father] who is seeking to establish the alleged father's 
paternity of the child(ren).  The form provides evidence regarding the father's paternity.  In interstate 
cases, a separate form must be completed for each child whose paternity is at issue. 

Acknowledgment of Parentage is an affidavit or form signed by the alleged father (and usually the 
mother as well) voluntarily acknowledging the alleged father's paternity of the child(ren).  These 
forms are used by hospital-based programs, State child support agencies, and other entities.  

f the individual petitioner is indigent and unable to pay the costs of these proceedings, check the “Other” 
checkbox and provide an explanation on the line provided.  Note that checking this box does not guarantee 
that the individual petitioner will be exempt from all costs and fees. 

he person(s) providing the testimony -- the individual petitioner and/or agency representative -- should 

sign and date the testimony at the bottom of page 10.  Some States require the individual petitioner's 
signature; check with the Interstate Roster and Referral Guide or the responding State to determine the 
responding State's requirements.  The form contains space for a notary to authenticate the signatures.

Child Support Enforcement Transmittal #1-Initial Request - Return This Page to the Initiating Jurisdiction                                       Page 3 of 3

INSTRUCTIONS FOR 
CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT TRANSMITTAL #1 - INITIAL REQUEST 

PURPOSE OF THE FORM:  The CSE Transmittal #1-Initial Request form is a "cover letter" required to 
refer IV-D interstate cases to any responding State's central registry.  The form can also be used in non-IV-
D cases.  It contains basic case information and space for indicating which services are requested.  The 
form can be used to request administrative or legal action, including establishment of paternity and/or 
support obligation, modification, or enforcement.  It does not take the place of, and therefore must be 
accompanied by, the appropriate standard interstate forms (e.g. Uniform Support Petition, General 
Testimony, etc.) and supporting documentation. A registration statement is needed for each order that the 
initiating State is requesting be registered by the responding State. Transmittal #1 may be sent 
electronically using the appropriate CSENet transaction. 

HEADING/CAPTION (Pages 1 & 3):  The initiating jurisdiction determines the heading.  Note that the 
heading appears on both page 1 of the Child Support Enforcement Transmittal #1 and on page 3, the 
Acknowledgment page. 

Identify the petitioner and respondent in the appropriate spaces. 

Check the appropriate space to identify the type of case: TANF; IV-E Foster Care, Medicaid only; 
former assistance, never assistance, or Non-IV-D. TANF means the obligee's family receives IV-A 
cash payments.  A Medicaid only case is a case where the obligee's family receives Medicaid but 
does not receive TANF (IV-A cash payments). 

In the space marked "To:", list the name and address (street, city, State, and zip code) of the 
central registry, court, or agency where you are sending the CSE Transmittal #1.  In IV-D cases, 
initial referrals must be sent to the responding State's central registry.  In non-IV-D cases, contact 
the responding State central registry to determine appropriate procedures. 

In the appropriate spaces, if applicable and if known, enter the Responding jurisdiction's FIPS code, 
State, IV-D case number, and Tribunal number.  The responding FIPS code is not essential for an 
initial IV-D referral since you will be sending the case to the responding central registry.  Under 
“IV-D case number”, enter the number/identifier identical to the one submitted on the Federal Case 
Registry, which is a left-justified 15-character alphanumeric field, allowing all characters except asterisk 
and backslash, and with all characters in uppercase.  Under "tribunal number", you may enter the docket 
number, cause number, or any other appropriate  reference number that the responding State may use 
to identify  the case, if known. 

In the space marked "From:", list a contact person, agency name, address (street, city, State, zip 
code), phone number (including extension), fax number, and e-mail address. 

In the appropriate spaces, enter the Initiating jurisdiction's FIPS code, State, IV-D case number, 
and tribunal number.  Under “IV-D case number”, enter the number/identifier identical to the one 
submitted on the Federal Case Registry, which is a left-justified 15-character alphanumeric field, 
allowing all characters except asterisk and backslash, and with all characters in uppercase.  Under 
"tribunal number", you may enter the docket number, cause number, or any other appropriate reference 
number which the initiating tribunal or agency has assigned to the case. 

In the space marked "Send Payments To:" enter the address to which payments should be sent, if 
the address is different from the agency address provided in the space labelled "From".  Specify the 
case identifier if you want the responding jurisdiction to use an identifier other than the initiating IV 
D case number when remitting payments.   

In the appropriate spaces, enter the FIPS code and State where payments should be sent. 

If funds can be transmitted electronically via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), enter the bank 
account number under "Bank Account" and the bank routing code under "Routing Code". 

Child Support Enforcement Transmittal #1 – Initial Request 

1 of 7 

ECTION I (page 1), ACTION:  Check the appropriate box(es) to indicate which actions are requested.  

 
Multiple actions may be requested, as appropriate. 

n IV-D cases, the responding jurisdiction should provide the full range of appropriate services.  For 
example, even if the initiating IV-D agency only checks box 1 "Establishment of Paternity", the responding 
jurisdiction should establish paternity, establish a support order, and enforce the support order. 
 

Check item 1 "Establishment of Paternity" where paternity has not been determined.  In a IV-D 
case, ask another State to establish paternity only if use of long-arm jurisdiction is not available or 
not appropriate.  Be sure to attach an "Affidavit in Support of Establishing Paternity" for each child 
whose paternity is at issue. 

Check item 2 "Establishment of Order for" to request that an order be established.  Indicate the type 
of order by checking the appropriate box. 

Check item 2A "Current Child Support, including Medical Support" to request the initial 
establishment of a new child support order.  If an order governing the same obligor, obligee, and 
child(ren) already exists, you should only request establishment of a new order if: (1) there is 
more than one existing order,  (2) the obligor, obligee, and child have all moved out of the issuing 
States, and (3) the parties have not filed written consent allowing an issuing State to assert 
jurisdiction

Check item 2B "Retroactive Child Support" if seeking support for a prior period. States may 
establish child support awards covering a prior period, but such awards must be based on 
guidelines and take into consideration either the current earnings and income at the time the 
order is set or the obligor's earnings and income during the prior period.  The award of back 
support is not required under Federal rules, but may be appropriate in accordance with State 
law.  Not all States have authority to establish support orders for prior periods.  Medical support 
must be requested in all IV-D establishment cases. 

Check item 2C "Medical Support Only" in a Medicaid case where a child support order does not 
exist and is not sought. If seeking to add medical support to an existing child support order, 
check item 4, "Modification of Responding Tribunal Order."

Check item 2D "Spousal Support" to request establishment of a spousal support order.  Do not 
check this item in a IV-D case; establishment of spousal support is not a IV-D function.  When 
requesting establishment of spousal support, contact the support enforcement agency for the 
appropriate procedure. 

Check item 2E "Costs and Fees" to request an order for costs and fees such as: costs of the 
delivery of the child, other medical costs not covered by insurance, genetic testing, and 
attorney's fees.  Describe the costs in section VII "Additional Case Information". 

If multiple orders governing the same obligor, obligee, and child(ren) exist, do not ask the 
responding State to prospectively enforce (or modify) an order unless that order is the 
"controlling order" that has priority under UIFSA.   

IFSA contains rules for determining which order is recognized when multiple orders exist.  

Under these rules: 

  U

1.  The order issued by a tribunal with continuing, exclusive jurisdiction (CEJ) has priority.  An 
issuing tribunal retains CEJ as long as the issuing State remains the residence of the 
obligor, obligee, or child, or until all parties file written consent with the tribunal allowing 
another State to assume CEJ. 

  Check item 3 "Enforcement of Responding Tribunal Order" to request enforcement of an existing 

order that was issued by the responding tribunal.

2 of 7 

  S

  I

 

 

 

 

 

 

2. 

If more than one issuing tribunal would have CEJ, the order issued by the child's current home 
State has priority.   "Child Home State" is the State where the child has lived for the prior 
consecutive 6 months before filing the UIFSA action or, if the child is under 6 months of age, 
since birth.

3. 

If more than one tribunal would have CEJ but there is no order in the child's current home 
State, the most recently issued order has priority. 

4. 

If no tribunal would have CEJ, the responding State may issue a new support order and it 
becomes the controlling order. 

  Check item 4 "Modification of Responding Tribunal Order" to request modification (or review and 

adjustment) of an existing order that was issued by the responding tribunal.   
 

Do not request the responding State to modify its own order if the obligor, obligee, and 
child(ren) have all moved out of that State, or if the parties have filed written consent with the 
issuing tribunal in that State allowing another State to modify the order. 

If multiple orders exist, do not ask a responding State to modify an order unless that order is 
the "controlling order" that has priority under UIFSA.  UIFSA contains rules for determining 
which order is recognized when multiple orders exist. 

Generally, you need to attach a completed General Testimony. 

Check item 5 "Change IV-D Payee of Responding Tribunal Order" to request a change of IV-D 
payee.  Describe your request in Section VII "Additional Case Information".  This is an 
administrative action used when the person or agency entitled to receive funds has changed.  It 
may occur with a change in public assistance or foster care status or if there is a change in 
custody.  In some States, court action, such as a modification, may be required if there is a 
change in custody or foster care status.

Item 6 "Redirect Payment to Obligee State" is an administrative action used when the custodian 
has moved.  In some States a court action may be required if the custodian's move compels 
transfer of documents or funds to another jurisdiction. 

Check item 7 "Registration of Foreign Support Order(s)" to request registration of one or more 
support orders.  Orders from one State may be registered in another State.  Also check item 7A 
"For Enforcement Only", item 7B "For Modification and Enforcement", or item 7C "For 
Modification Only".  Check either item 7B or 7C if you are requesting review and adjustment of a 
foreign order.  Check item 7D “For Tribunal Determination of Controlling Order Including Arrears 
Reconciliation” if you are requesting a determination of controlling order and an arrears 
reconciliation. Check the appropriate box to indicate whether registration is requested by the 
obligor, obligee, or state enforcement agency. 

To modify another State's order, a responding State must first register the order.  To enforce 
another State's order, a responding State may have to register the order; UIFSA allows for 
administrative enforcement without registration (but requires registration for other enforcement 
actions). 

To request registration of an order you must include: 

A letter of transmittal to the tribunal requesting registration for enforcement and/or 
modification.  The CSE Transmittal #1 serves this function.  Check the appropriate boxes in 
item 7 of section I to indicate the action requested.

3 of 7 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Unless a controlling order determination has been made by a tribunal, a certified copy of all 
orders to be registered, including any modification of an order.   

A registration statement for each order that the initiating State is requesting to be registered 
by the responding State. 

A sworn statement by the party seeking registration or a certified statement by the 
custodian of records showing the amount of any arrearage.  At State option, page 6a of the 
General Testimony may be used for this purpose.  In section VIII "Attachments", check the 
first box ("Arrears Statement/Payment History") to indicate that a sworn statement of 
arrears is attached. 

The name of the obligor and, if known: the obligor's address and Social Security Number; 
the name and address of the obligor's employer and any other source of income of the 
obligor; and a description and the location of property of the obligor in the responding State 
not exempt from execution.  Space for most of this information is provided on the CSE 
Transmittal #1.  If you have information about the obligor's other sources of income or 
property, include the information in section VII or an attachment.  In section VIII, check the 
box labelled "Description of Real/Personal Property" if a description is attached. 

The name and address of the obligee.  Space for this information is provided on the CSE 
Transmittal #1.  

If applicable, the agency or person to whom support payments are to be remitted.  Space 
for this information is included in the heading of the CSE Transmittal #1. 

n addition, to allow the responding State to establish a IV-D case, you will probably need to 
complete all other information on the CSE Transmittal #1, particularly information regarding the 
children. 

Furthermore, when requesting registration for modification, you generally need to attach a 
completed Uniform Support Petition and General Testimony. 

Do not ask a responding State to modify another State's order unless:   

(1) the child(ren), individual obligee, and obligor do not live in the State that issued the order; 
(2) the party seeking modification does not live in the responding State; and (3) the 
responding State has personal jurisdiction over the party not requesting modification. 

  I

 

OR 

The responding State has personal jurisdiction over the obligor, individual obligee, or 
child(ren), and the obligor and obligee have filed written consent in the tribunal that issued 
the order providing that the responding State may modify the support order and assume 
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the order. 

If multiple orders governing the same obligor, obligee, and child(ren) exist, do not ask a 
responding State to prospectively enforce or modify an order unless that order is the 
"controlling order" that has priority under UIFSA.  UIFSA contains rules for determining which 
order is recognized when multiple orders exist.   

Generally, the CSE Transmittal #1 is used to send initial case referrals and the CSE 
Transmittal #2 is used to send/request additional information or action after the initial referral.

However, since the CSE Transmittal #2 does not contain the necessary information needed to 
request registration of a foreign order, you may use the CSE Transmittal #1 to request 
registration even in a case that has previously been referred to the responding jurisdiction.  If 
you are requesting registration in a case that has previously been referred to the responding 
jurisdiction, you may send the request directly to the responding entity working the case rather 
than to the responding central registry.  

 

  Check item 8 "Collection of Arrears Only" to request collection of arrears only.  You should request 

enforcement of arrears under all known orders. 

Check item 9 "Income Withholding" to request interstate income withholding.   

Check item10  "Administrative Review for Federal Tax Offset" to request an administrative review 
in the responding State if a Federal income tax refund offset has been challenged. 

Check item 11 "Other" if you are requesting a service other than those listed, such as a lien or levy 
or an administrative remedy, such as license revocation.  Describe the service on the blank line. 

SECTION II (page 1), CASE SUMMARY:  If you know that a tribunal has already determined the 
controlling order, only enter information about the controlling order and check “Tribunal-Determined 
Controlling Order”.   Otherwise, where multiple orders exist, provide complete information for all 
court/administrative actions regarding support for dependents.  If there are more than three orders, use 
additional page(s) or Section VII.  For "Period of Computation", enter the month, day, and year for both 
the beginning and ending dates.  The information in this section will be used to aid in verifying calculated 
arrearages or reconciling arrears under multiple order and to assist in determining/verifying which order is 
controlling and which State has continuing exclusive jurisdiction.  

If you believe a particular order is controlling but there is no tribunal-determined controlling order, check 
the box beside "Presumed Controlling Order"; otherwise leave the box blank. 

Under UIFSA,  a State that issues a child support order maintains CEJ as long as the obligor, 
individual obligee, or child(ren) reside in that State, or until each party files written consent in that 
State allowing another State to assume CEJ.  If there are multiple orders governing the same 
obligor, obligee, and child(ren), UIFSA contains rules for determining which order is controlling.  The 
tribunal that issued the controlling order has CEJ as long as the conditions for CEJ are met.  CEJ 
means the authority to modify the order.  

Attach the required number of copies of all pertinent orders that relate to support. You will generally need 
to attach a certified copy of any support order.  Note, however, that some responding States may be able 
to take certain administrative enforcement actions without having a certified copy of the order, although a 
regular copy is necessary. 

 SECTION III (page 2), MOTHER INFORMATION:  This section provides basic information about the 
child(ren)'s mother.  Check the appropriate box to indicate if the mother is the obligor or obligee.  Provide 
the mother's full name (first, middle, last), as well as aliases, maiden name or other names used, and all 
other information.  List additional information (e.g., phone number changes, relatives' phone numbers, 
multiple employers or assets) in section VII.  In cases where the mother is the respondent, the information 
can be used for location purposes if necessary.  If the mother's address has been confirmed or verified, 
check the "Address Confirmed" box and indicate the date the address was confirmed.  If the 
employer/employer's address has been confirmed or verified, check the "Employer Confirmed" box and 
indicate the date the information was confirmed. Verified, current information expedites processing of any 
child support case.  However, if information cannot be verified, provide last known information.

5 of 7 

SECTION IV (page 2), FATHER INFORMATION:  This section provides basic information about the 
child(ren)'s father.  In a case where paternity has not been established, use this section to provide 
information about the alleged father.  Check the appropriate box to indicate if the father is the obligor or 
obligee.  Provide the father's full name (first, middle, last) as well as aliases and nicknames, and all other 
information.  List additional information (i.e., phone number changes, relatives' phone numbers, multiple 
employers or assets) in section VII.  In cases where the father is the respondent, the information can be 
used for location purposes if necessary.  If the father's address has been confirmed or verified, check the 
"Address Confirmed" box and indicate the date the address was confirmed.  If the employer/employer's 
address has been confirmed or verified, check the "Employer Confirmed" box and indicate the date the 
information was confirmed.  Verified, current information expedites processing of any child support case.  
However, if information cannot be verified, provide last known information.  

SECTION V (page 2), CARETAKER:  Complete this section only if the child(ren)'s caretaker is not the 
child(ren)'s parent.  In the space labelled "Relationship to Child(ren)", indicate the relationship of the 
caretaker to the child(ren).  Check box “Has Legal Custody/Guardianship of Child(ren) (copy of order 
attached)”, if the caretaker has legal custody or guardianship.  Provide the caretaker's full name (first, 
middle, last) as well as aliases, maiden name or other names used, and all other information.  Note: if the 
caretaker does not have a legal obligation to contribute to a child's support, information regarding the 
caretaker's employment may be privileged.  

SECTION VI (page 2), DEPENDENT CHILDREN INFORMATION:  List all children for whom support is 
owed or being sought.  For each child, provide full legal name (first, middle, last), city, State and date of 
birth, sex, Social Security Number.  Add the child’s State of Residence and how many months the child 
has lived there.   If additional space is needed, use section VII. 

ECTION VII (page 2), ADDITIONAL CASE INFORMATION:  In this section, provide additional 

information which may be useful to the responding jurisdiction in working the case, such as pending action, 
amounts reported to credit bureaus, or prior attempts of long-arm action.  If additional space is needed, 
attach page(s). 

f there is an order preventing disclosure of a party's or child's address/identifying information, check the 
box for "Nondisclosure Finding Attached" and attach a copy of the finding.  In accordance with the finding, 
do not provide the address/identifying information; you may provide a substitute address.  A nondisclosure 
finding means a finding that the health, safety, or liberty of a party or child would be unreasonably put at 
risk by disclosure of identifying information (e.g., residential address).  UIFSA provides that interstate 
petitions must include certain identifying information regarding the parties and child(ren) unless a tribunal 
(court or agency) makes a nondisclosure finding by ordering that the address or identifying information not 
be disclosed.  The procedures for obtaining a nondisclosure finding vary from State to State.  

If a State has reason to believe that information should not be released because of safety concerns, please 
note it in item VII and ensure the petition requests a nondisclosure finding under section 312 of UIFSA.

ECTION VIII (page 2), ATTACHMENTS:  Check the appropriate box(es) to indicate all documents 

attached.  For attachments other than those listed, check "Other Attachments" and explain in section VII. 

ttach the required number of copies of all pertinent orders that relate to support. You will generally need 
to attach a certified copy of any support order. Note, however, that some responding States may be able to 
take certain administrative enforcement actions without having a certified copy of the order, although a 
regular copy is necessary. You may include a copy of that State statute if assignment is by operation of 
law. 
 
At the bottom of page 2, provide a specific worker's name, a direct telephone number (with extension if 
necessary), fax number and e-mail address to expedite communications between jurisdictions.

PAGE 3, ACKNOWLEDGMENT: The initiating State should always include the "acknowledgment of receipt" 
page with Transmittal #1.  The initiating State completes the Heading/Caption on the acknowledgment page.  
The rest of the acknowledgment should be completed by the responding State and returned to the initiating 
State.  An automated acknowledgment may be sent through CSENet. 

This information collection is conducted in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 651 et seq. and 45 CFR 303.7 of the 
child support enforcement program.  Standard forms are designed to provide uniformity and standardization 
for interstate case processing.  Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to 
average under half an hour per response.  The responses to this collection are mandatory in accordance 
with the above statute and regulation.  This information is subject to State and Federal confidentiality 
requirements; however, the information will be filed with the tribunal and/or agency in the responding State 
and may, depending on State law, be disclosed to other parties.  An agency may not conduct or sponsor, 
and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid 
OMB control number.

Child Support Enforcement Transmittal #2 - Subsequent Actions                   

Return This Page to the Initiating Jurisdiction                    Page 2 of 2

INSTRUCTIONS FOR  
CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT TRANSMITTAL #2 - SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS 

PURPOSE OF THE FORM:  This transmittal form is for use by either the initiating or responding 
jurisdiction for requesting or providing additional information or services in previously-referred cases.  The 
CSE Transmittal #2 should not be used for making initial referrals, but should only be used for subsequent 
requests and communication.  This form need not be sent when the Notice of Controlling Order form is 
sent.  The CSE Transmittal #2 should be sent to the local entity working the case (rather than the State's 
central registry) unless the local entity working the case is unknown. Transmittal #2 may be sent 
electronically using the appropriate CSENet transaction.    

HEADING/CAPTION (Pages 1 & 2):  The jurisdiction which sends the CSE Transmittal #2 determines the 
heading.  Note that the heading appears on both page 1 of the Child Support Enforcement Transmittal 
#2 and on page 2, the Acknowledgment page. 

Identify the petitioner and respondent name and Social Security number in the appropriate spaces. 

Check the appropriate space to identify the type of case: TANF; IV-E Foster Care, Medicaid only; 
former assistance, never assistance, or Non-IV-D. TANF  means the obligee's family receives IV-A 
cash payments.  A Medicaid only case is a case where the obligee's family receives Medicaid but 
does not receive TANF (IV-A cash payments). 

In the space marked "To:", list the name and address (street, city, State, and zip code) of the court 
or agency where you are sending the CSE Transmittal #2.  Once an initial referral in a IV-D case 
has been made to the responding State's central registry (using CSE Transmittal #1), subsequent 
communication can occur with the local agency/court/jurisdiction that is actually working the case 
(using CSE Transmittal #2). 

In the appropriate spaces, if applicable and if known, enter the Responding jurisdiction's FIPS 
code, State, IV-D case number, and Tribunal number.  Under “IV-D case number”, enter the 
number/identifier identical to the one submitted on the Federal Case Registry, which is a left-
justified 15-character alphanumeric field, allowing all characters except asterisk and backslash, 
and with all characters in uppercase.  Under "tribunal number", you may enter the docket number, 
cause number, or any other appropriate reference number that the responding State may use to 
identify the case, if known.  The Responding jurisdiction is the jurisdiction that is working the case 
at the request of the initiating jurisdiction. 

In the space marked "From:", list a contact person, agency name, address (street, city, State, zip 
code), phone number (including extension), fax number, and e-mail address. 

In the appropriate spaces, enter the Initiating jurisdiction's FIPS code, State, and IV-D case number, 
and tribunal number.  Under “IV-D case number”, enter the number/identifier identical to the one 
submitted on the Federal Case Registry, which is a left-justified 15-character alphanumeric field,

                   Page 1 of 3 

SECTION I (page 1), ACTION:  Check the appropriate box(es) to indicate which actions are requested or 
what information is being provided.  Multiple boxes may be checked, as appropriate.  

  Check item 1 "Status Request" if you are asking for a status update.  Describe the request in 

Section II. 

II. 

  Check item 2 "Status Update" if you are providing a status update.  Provide the update in Section 

  Check item 3 "Notice of Hearing" if you are providing notice of an upcoming hearing.  Provide 

dates and other information in Section II. 

  Check item 4 "Notice of Case Forwarding" if you are providing notice that you have forwarded a 

misdirected case to the appropriate jurisdiction.  Explain in Section II. 

Check item 5 "Document Filed" if you are providing notice that a document has been filed.  Explain 
in Section II. 

  Check item 6 "Order Issued/Confirmed" if you are providing notice that an order has been issued or 

confirmed.  Attach a copy of the order. If using CSENet, mail or fax as separate item.  

  Check item 7 "Notice of Arrearage Reconciliation/Determination of Sum-Certain" if you are 
providing notice of an arrearage reconciliation or determination of sum-certain.  Attach any 
calculations or worksheets used. If using CSENet , mail or fax as separate item. 

Check item 8 "Change IV-D Payee of Responding Tribunal Order" to request a change of 
payee in a IV-D case.  Describe your request in Section II "Additional Information".  This is an 
administrative action used when the person or agency entitled to receive funds has changed.  It 
may occur with a change in Public Assistance or Foster Care status or with a change in 
custody.  In some States, court action, such as a modification, may be required if there is a 
change in custody or foster care status. 

  Check item 9 "Redirect Payment to Obligee State" when the custodian has moved.  This is an 

administrative action, but in some States a court action may be required if the custodian's move 
compels transfer of documents or funds to another jurisdiction. 

Check item 10 "Other" if you are requesting a service or providing information other than the 
types listed.  This would include a new nondisclosure finding by the tribunal in either the 
initiating or the responding State.  Describe the service or information in Section II. 

Check the box beside "Please Return the Acknowledgment Attached" if an acknowledgment is 
needed.  This is used only if requesting information or action.  

SECTION II (page 1), ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  In this section, provide additional information which 
may be useful.   

If there is an order preventing disclosure of a party's or child's address/identifying information, check the 
box for "Nondisclosure Finding Attached" and attach a copy of the finding.  You do not need to resend a 
finding that was sent before. Note in Section II that the finding has already been sent.  In accordance with 
the finding, do not provide the address/identifying information; you may provide a substitute address.  A 
nondisclosure finding means a finding that the health, safety, or liberty of a party or child would be 
unreasonably put at risk by disclosure of identifying information (e.g., residential address).

Child Support Enforcement Transmittal #2 - Subsequent Actions

                   Page 2 of 3 

UIFSA provides that interstate petitions must include certain identifying information regarding the parties 
 
and child(ren) unless a tribunal (court or agency) makes a nondisclosure finding by ordering that the 
address or identifying information not be disclosed.  The procedures for obtaining a nondisclosure 
finding vary from State to State.   

At the bottom of page 1, provide a specific worker's name, a direct telephone number (with extension if 
necessary), fax number and e-mail address to expedite communications between jurisdictions. 

PAGE 2, ACKNOWLEDGMENT:  When a jurisdiction sends a Transmittal #2 to another jurisdiction, it 
should include the acknowledgment only if the jurisdiction is requesting information or action.  The sending 
State completes the Heading/Caption on this page.  If the jurisdiction is sending the Transmittal #2 to 
provide notice or information, the acknowledgment is not needed. 

Upon receiving a request for action or information on a Transmittal #2, the receiving State completes the rest 
of the acknowledgment.  The acknowledgment can be used to provide any information requested on the 
Transmittal #2 or to indicate when (how many days or on what date) the requested information will be 
provided.  The jurisdiction sending the acknowledgment must indicate where the case has been referred for 
action, and the name, telephone, fax number and e-mail address of a contact person.  

This information collection is conducted in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 651 et seq. and 45 CFR 303.7 of the 
child support enforcement program.  Standard forms are designed to provide uniformity and standardization 
for interstate case processing.  Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to 
average under half an hour per response.  The responses to this collection are mandatory in accordance 
with the above statute and regulation.  This information is subject to State and Federal confidentiality 
requirements; however, the information will be filed with the tribunal and/or agency in the responding State 
and may, depending on State law, be disclosed to other parties.  An agency may not conduct or sponsor, 
and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid 
OMB control number.

Child Support Enforcement Transmittal #3 - Request for Assistance Discovery     

Return This Page to the Initiating Jurisdiction     Page 2 of 2

INSTRUCTIONS FOR 
CHILD SUPPORT TRANSMITTAL #3 - REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE/DISCOVERY 

PURPOSE OF THE FORM:  The CSE Transmittal #3-Request for Assistance/Discovery is designed for 
use when the requesting jurisdiction is working its case locally (e.g., by long-arm jurisdiction) and needs 
limited assistance from another jurisdiction, but does not want the other jurisdiction to open a IV-D case.  
Sections 316 and 318 of the model version of UIFSA contain specific provisions that allow a tribunal to 
receive evidence from another State and to obtain discovery through a tribunal of another State. The form 
may be sent electronically using the appropriate CSENet transaction.  

When a jurisdiction receives a CSE Transmittal #3-Request for Assistance/Discovery from another 
jurisdiction, it should not open a IV-D case; it should only provide the limited assistance requested.  By 
contrast, the CSE Transmittal #1-Initial Request is designed for use when the initiating State is requesting 
the responding State to open a IV-D case.  

HEADING/CAPTION (Pages 1 & 2):  The jurisdiction requesting assistance/discovery determines the 
heading.  Note that the heading appears on both page 1 of the Child Support Enforcement Transmittal 
#3 and on page 2, the Acknowledgment page. 

Identify the petitioner and respondent name and Social Security number in the appropriate spaces.  
The jurisdiction requesting assistance/discovery should include a verified address for the 
respondent, if necessary for responding to the request, or if known.

 Enter the children’s legal names to assist the responding State in discussing the request with the 
noncustodial parent.                                            

Check the appropriate space to identify the type of case: TANF; IV-E Foster Care, Medicaid only; 
former assistance, never assistance, or Non-IV-D. TANF  means the obligee's family receives IV-A 
cash payments.  A Medicaid only case is a case where the obligee's family receives Medicaid but 
does not receive TANF (IV-A cash payments). 

In the space marked "To:", list the name and address (street, city, State, and zip code) of the 
agency or court where you are sending the CSE Transmittal #3.  

In the appropriate spaces, if applicable and if known, enter the Responding jurisdiction's FIPS code, 
State, IV-D case number, and tribunal number.  Under “IV-D case number”, enter the number/identifier 
identical to the one submitted on the Federal Case Registry, which is a left-justified 15-character 
alphanumeric field, allowing all characters except asterisk and backslash, and with all characters in 
uppercase.  Under "tribunal number", you may enter the docket number, cause number, or any other 
appropriate reference number that the responding State may use to identify the case, if known.  The 
"responding" jurisdiction is the jurisdiction that receives the request for assistance. 

In the space marked "From:", list a contact person, agency name, address (street, city, State, zip 
code), phone number (including extension), fax number, and e-mail address. 

In the appropriate spaces, enter the Initiating jurisdiction's FIPS code, State, IV-D case number, and 
tribunal number.   Under “IV-D case number”, enter the number/identifier identical to the one 
submitted on the Federal Case Registry, which is a left-justified 15-character alphanumeric field, 
allowing all characters except asterisk and backslash, and with all characters in uppercase.  Under 
"tribunal number", you may enter the docket number, cause number, or any other appropriate 
reference number which the initiating tribunal or agency has assigned to the case.  The "initiating" 
jurisdiction is the jurisdiction that is requesting assistance. 

In the space marked "Response Needed by" enter the date by which a response is needed.

to using Transmittal #3 for this purpose, contact the assisting State and provide all additional 
information and documents needed.  If the assisting State requires "full" case information or 
documentation, use Transmittal #1 instead.

Check item 9 "File a Notice of Determination of Controlling Order with An Order-Issuing Tribunal" if the 
requesting State issued an order that contributed to a determination process.  Attach a copy of the 
Notice of Determination of Controlling Order and a certified copy of the determination itself and any 
arrears reconciliation order.

the blank line, indicate the assistance needed; be as specific as possible. 

f you are requesting that the tribunal in the other State compel a person over whom it has jurisdiction to 
respond to a discovery order issued by a tribunal of another State (in accordance with section 318 of the 
model version of UIFSA), attach certified copies of the discovery order.

Page 2 of 3 

ECTION II, ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  In a narrative format, indicate any other information that will 

be useful in processing your request.  Provide any necessary identifying information and background 
information about why the request is being made, including: (1) information on the nature of the pending 
action (e.g., paternity, support, modification, enforcement, etc.) and (2) the reason assistance from the 
other jurisdiction is needed.  If you have a verified employer address, include it in Section II. 

f there is an order preventing disclosure of a party's or child's address/identifying information, check the 
box for "Nondisclosure Finding Attached" and attach a copy of the finding.  In accordance with the finding, 
do not provide the address/identifying information; you may provide a substitute address.  A nondisclosure 
finding means a finding that the health, safety, or liberty of a party or child would be unreasonably put at 
risk by disclosure of identifying information (e.g., residential address).  UIFSA provides that interstate 
petitions must include certain identifying information regarding the parties and child(ren) unless a tribunal 
(court or agency) makes a nondisclosure finding by ordering that the address or identifying information not 
be disclosed.  The procedures for obtaining a nondisclosure finding vary from State to State.  

t the bottom of page 1, provide a specific worker's name, a direct telephone number (with extension if 

necessary) fax number and e-mail address to expedite communications between jurisdictions. 

PAGE 2, ACKNOWLEDGMENT:  The jurisdiction requesting assistance/discovery completes the 
Heading/Caption on this page.  Upon receiving a request for assistance on a Transmittal #3, the receiving 
State completes the rest of the acknowledgment.  The acknowledgment can be used to provide information 
in response to a request received via the Transmittal #3, or to indicate when (how many days or on what 
date) the requested information/action will be provided.  The jurisdiction sending the acknowledgment 
should indicate where the case has been referred for action, and the name, telephone, fax number and e-
mail address of a contact person.

e. 

This form is used only when a defendant pays a fine and costs or enters into an installment 
agreement after an Abstract of Conviction has been sent electronically or mailed by the court 
to DMV which shows that the license of the defendant was suspended under Virginia Code 
§ 46.2-395 for failure to pay fine and costs.  All other terminations of suspension by the 
court should be reported on the ABSTRACT OF CONVICTION, form DI-18c or the Abstract 
from a Virginia Uniform Summons.  Most often defendants receive the automated DC-30 
generated from PCR (personal computer register) for payment in full or installment 
agreement. 

This form is to be prepared and delivered or mailed to the defendant.  Do not mail a copy to 
DMV. 

List separately each charge, offense date and trial date for such charge for which payment 
has been received or license restored on this form.   

The defendant should be reminded that manual DC-30 or automated PCR DC-30 must be 
taken to DMV in order that the defendant may obtain the removal of the license suspension 
on DMV's records and that he will have to pay a reinstatement fee and comply with other 
DMV requirements (if any). 

Do not use this form to correct an erroneous report of failure to pay fine and costs.  Instead, 
report such error on the ABSTRACT OF CONVICTION, form DI-18c.

*Defense of an unclassified felony punishable by 20 years or less is compensated as a Felony Class III or IV felony; by more than 20 years as a Class II. 

ee waivers may only be awarded by the court in which the case is concluded. 

he General Assembly has authorized the above schedule for compensation for court-appointed counsel in non-capital 
cases. If co-counsel (more than one attorney) is appointed to represent a defendant at the same time in a non-capital case, 
then co-counsel shall share the maximum total compensation permitted for one attorney as set forth above. Upon 
submission by counsel of a detailed accounting of time expended for court-appointed representation, the court in its 
discretion and subject to guidelines issued by the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia may waive the 
limitation of fees and authorize additional compensation up to the supplemental statutory waiver amount when the effort 
expended by counsel, the time reasonably necessary for the particular representation, the novelty and difficulty of the 
issues, or other circumstances warrant such a waiver. 

ounsel may also request additional compensation exceeding these amounts by submitting a written request with a 
detailed accounting of the time spent and justification for the additional amount.  The presiding judge shall determine, 
subject to guidelines issued by the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia, whether this request for 
additional compensation above the supplemental statutory waiver amount is justified, in whole or part, by considering the 
effort expended and time reasonably necessary for the particular representation, and, if so, shall forward the request as 
approved to the chief judge of the circuit court or district court for approval. Additional guidelines are posted at 
http://www.courts.state.va.us/courtadmin/aoc/fiscal/home.html#coa and 
http://www.courts.state.va.us/forms/district/statutory_criteria_fee_cap_waiver_guidelines.pdf.  

here is no appeal process available if an application for waiver of fee cap is denied. Additionally, if at any time the 

funds appropriated to pay for waivers become insufficient, the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia 
shall so certify to the courts and no further waivers shall be approved. 

f you believe that your representation of an indigent defendant warrants consideration for an additional payment, please 
complete the reverse side of this form and present it to the court along with your standard request for payment (Form 
DC-40, LIST OF ALLOWANCES) and your Attorney Time Sheet.  You must complete a separate application for each 
charge for which you are requesting a waiver of the fee cap.  This form along with the Attorney Time Sheet shall be 
retained in the court file.

OTICE OF CONSEQUENCES OF COMPLIANCE AND FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS REQUEST 

PURSUANT TO VIRGINIA CODE § 8.01-286.1 BY THE PLAINTIFF FOR WAIVER OF SERVICE OF PROCESS BY 
THE DEFENDANT: 
1. 

The defendant is allowed no more than 30 days from the date on which the request is sent, or 60 days if the defendant’s 
address is outside the Commonwealth, to return the waiver. 
Upon failure by the defendant to comply with this request for waiver made by the plaintiff, the court shall impose the 
costs subsequently incurred in effecting service on the defendant, unless the defendant shows good cause for the failure 
to comply. These costs shall include, in addition to the costs for effecting service of process, other costs, including 
reasonable attorneys’ fees, of any motion required to collect the costs of service. 
Upon timely return of the requested waiver of service of process, the defendant is not required to serve an answer or 
other responsive pleading to the complaint or other initial pleading until 60 days after the date on which this request for 
waiver of service was sent, or 90 days after that date if the defendant’s address is outside the Commonwealth of 
Virginia.   
The defendant’s waiver of service of process in compliance with this request does not thereby waive any objection to 
the venue or to the jurisdiction of the court over the person of that defendant, or to any other defense or objection other 
than objections based on inadequacy of process or service of process.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
