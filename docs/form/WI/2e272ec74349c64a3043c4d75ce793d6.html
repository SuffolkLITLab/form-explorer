A VIOLATION OF THE ABOVE PROHIBITIONS MAY RESULT IN PUNISHMENT FOR 
CONTEMPT, WHICH MAY INCLUDE MONETARY PENALTIES, IMPRISONMENT, AND 
OTHER SANCTIONS AS PROVIDED FOR IN §785.04, WIS. STATS. 

A violation of paragraphs 3, 4, or 5 above is not a contempt of court if the court finds that the action was 
taken to protect a party or a minor child of the parties from physical abuse by the other party and that there 
was no reasonable opportunity under the circumstances for the party to obtain an order authorizing the 
action. 

These PROHIBITIONS apply until the action is dismissed, a final judgment in the action is entered, or the 
court orders otherwise.

uthority and Purpose 

§49.22(9), Wis. Stats. requires the Department to adopt and publish a standard, based upon a designated 
percentage of the gross income and assets of either or both parents, to be used by courts in determining 
child support obligations. Chapter DCF 150 of the Wisconsin Administrative Code establishes 
Wisconsin's child support standard. It is based upon the principle that the child's standard of living should, 
to the degree possible, be the same as if the child's parents were living together. 

hapter DCF 150 defines the income upon which the support obligation is based, and sets the designated 

percentages of income for computing the support obligation based upon a number of children. It also 
explains optional procedures for adjusting the obligation when the parents share placement, when the 
parent has an obligation to support another family, or when the payer has particularly high or low income. 

pplicability 

The designated percentage applies to any temporary and final order for child support, including child 
support stipulations agreed to by both parents and modifications of existing child support orders.  

efinition of Income and Assets 

Chapter DCF 150 defines gross income as income from any source, whether or not it is reported or taxed 
under federal law. The income can be in the form of money, property, or services. Public assistance or 
child support received from previous marriages or business expenses, which the court determines are 
reasonably necessary for the production of income or operation of a business are subtracted, and wages 
paid to dependent household member are added to determine "gross income available for child support." 

he court may also determine that income may be "imputed" (assumed at a given level) based on earning 

capacity and/or assets, and that imputed income is added to the gross income for the calculation of the 
support obligation. 

HE STANDARD CHILD SUPPORT CALCULATION  

The percentages are: 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

17% for one child 
25% for two children 
29% for three children 
31% for four children 
34% for five or more children 

isconsin Statutes require temporary and final support orders to be expressed as fixed sum in most situations. 

or further details, refer to Chapter DCF 150 of the Wisconsin Administrative Code and Wisconsin Statute 767

Statutory Factors Courts May Consider In Determining Child Support Awards for  
Paternity, Divorce, or Legal Separation 

767.511, Child Support. 

1 m) Upon request by a party, the court may modify the amount of child support payments determined 
under §767.511 (1j) if, after considering the following factors, the court finds by the greater weight of the 
credible evidence that use of the percentage standard is unfair to the child or to any of the parties: 

a) The financial resources of the child.  

b) The financial resources of both parents. 

bj) Maintenance received by either party. 

(bp) The needs of each party in order to support himself or herself at a level equal to or greater than that 
established under 42 USC 9902 (2). 

bz) The needs of any person, other than the child, whom either party is legally obligated to support 

c) If the parties were married, the standard of living the child would have enjoyed had the marriage not 
ended in annulment, divorce or legal separation. 

d) The desirability that the custodian remain in the home as a full-time parent.  

e) The cost of day care if the custodian works outside the home, or the value of custodial services 
performed by the custodian if the custodian remains in the home. 

ej) The award of substantial periods of physical placement to both parents. 

em) Extraordinary travel expenses incurred in exercising the right to periods of physical placement under 
§767.41. 

f) The physical, mental and emotional health needs of the child, including any costs for health 
Insurance as provided for under sub. (4m). 

g) The child's educational needs.  

h) The tax consequences to each party. 

hm) The best interests of the child. 

(hs) The earning capacity of each parent, based on each parent's education, training and work experience 
and the availability of work in or near the parent's community. 

i) Any other factors which the court in each case determines are relevant.
