and potential penalties associated with being a third party who agrees to

that there is a Firearm Surrender Hearing scheduled.  Do I need to go to 
this hearing? 

Please read this section carefully.   

If you are required to appear at the Firearms Surrender Hearing and you fail to do so, 
the judge or commissioner may issue a warrant for your arrest. 

If any of the following situations apply to you, you MUST go to the hearing. 

I did not go to the injunction hearing and I never gave the court my signed

own or possess any firearms.

  3.  File CV-433 with the clerk of court. 

 

 

  4.  Wait for the judge or commissioner to complete and sign the Order Concerning 

Return of Firearms (CV-435).  If the court schedules a hearing, you will be notified of 
that date.  If there is no hearing, you will receive CV-435 in the mail. 
 
The judge or commissioner needs to find the answers to these two questions before 
he/she can order the return of firearms: 
A.  Has the injunction against you been vacated or has it expired? 
B.  Do any other federal or state laws or court orders prohibit you from possessing 

firearms? 
 

  5. 

 
If the judge or commissioner orders your firearms returned, contact the person 
holding your firearms and notify that person of this decision.

beyond the expiration date and for disposal costs. 

  The sheriff will return the original receipts and any copies he/she has.
