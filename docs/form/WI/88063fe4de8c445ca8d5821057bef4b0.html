**IMPORTANT NOTICES** 

ou are notified of the availability of information from the Family Court Commissioner as set forth in §767.105, Wis. Stats. 

767.105 Information from Family Court Commissioner. 

(2)  Upon the request of a party to an action affecting the family, including a revision of judgment or order under §767.59 

or §767.451: 
(a)  The Family Court Commissioner shall, with or without charge, provide the party with written information on the 

following, as appropriate to the action commenced: 
1.  The procedure for obtaining a judgment or order in the action. 
2.  The major issues usually addressed in such an action. 
3.  Community resources and family court counseling services available to assist the parties. 
4.  The procedure for setting, modifying, and enforcing child support awards, or modifying and enforcing legal 

 
 
 
 

custody or physical placement judgments or orders. 

(b)  The Family Court Commissioner shall provide a party, for inspection or purchase, with a copy of the statutory 

provisions in this chapter generally pertinent to the action. 

 

 

You are notified that if the parties to the action have minor children, violation of the following criminal statute is 
punishable by fines and/or imprisonment as set forth in §948.31 Wis. Stats. 
 
§948.31 Interference with custody by parent or others. 
(1) 
 

In this subsection, "legal custodian of a child" means: 
1.  A parent or other person having legal custody of the child under an order or judgment in an action for 

(a) 
 

divorce, legal separation, annulment, child custody, paternity, guardianship or habeas corpus. 

 

2.  The department of children and families or the department of corrections or any person, county 

department under §§46.215, 46.22 or 46.23 or licensed child welfare agency, if custody or supervision of 
the child has been transferred under chapter 48 or chapter 938 to that department, person or agency. 

(b)  Except as provided under chs. 48 and 938, whoever intentionally causes a child to leave, takes a child away, 
or withholds a child for more than 12 hours beyond the court-approved period of physical placement or 
visitation period from a legal custodian with intent to deprive the custodian of his or her custody rights without 
the consent of the custodian is guilty of a Class F felony. This paragraph is not applicable if the court has 
entered an order authorizing the person to so take or withhold the child. The fact that joint legal custody has 
been awarded to both parents by a court does not preclude a court from finding that one parent has 
committed a violation of this paragraph. 

(2)  Whoever causes a child to leave, takes a child away or withholds a child for more than 12 hours from the child's 
parents, or in the case of a nonmarital child whose parents do not subsequently intermarry under §767.803, from 
the child's mother, or if he has been granted legal custody, the child's father, without the consent of the parents, the

(3)  Any parent, or any person acting pursuant to directions from the parent, who does any of the following is 

guilty of a Class F felony: 
(a) 
(b)  After being served with process in an action affecting the family but prior to the issuance of a temporary or

child for more than 12 hours beyond the court-approved period of physical placement or visitation period.

assault to the child; 
Is taken by a parent fleeing in a situation in which the parent reasonably believes that there is a threat of 
physical harm or sexual assault to himself or herself; 
Is consented to by the other parent or any other person or agency having legal custody of the child; or

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
