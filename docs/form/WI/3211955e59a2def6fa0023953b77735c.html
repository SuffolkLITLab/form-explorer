assignment of all commissions, earnings, salaries, wages, pension benefits, 
benefits under Chapter 102 or 108, and other money due or to be due in the 
future, to the WI SCTF.  The assignment shall be for an amount sufficient to 
ensure payment under this judgment, so long as the addition of the amount 
toward arrears does not leave the party at an income below the poverty line 
established under 42 USC 9902(2). 

  2.  Pursuant to §767.57(1)(a), Wis. Stats., all payments for child support and/or 

maintenance ordered shall note the case number and the names of the parties 
on the face of the check, should be made payable to WI SCTF, and sent to:

Box 74200 
Milwaukee, WI  53274-0200. 

The WI SCTF will transmit the payments to the proper persons entitled to them. 
Failure of an employer to pay the proper amount shall not be a defense for 
failure to pay the proper amount. If an employer fails to take out the correct 
amount for child support and/or maintenance, the party paying is responsible for 
paying the full and correct amount directly to WI SCTF. 
Pursuant to §767.57(1e), Wis. Stats., the party making payment for child support 
and/or maintenance is responsible for payment of the annual receiving and 
disbursing fee to WI SCTF. 
If maintenance is not denied, both parties shall notify, in writing, the other party 
and the Clerk of Court and the Child Support Agency of the county in which this 
action is filed, within 10 business days, of any change of employer and 
employer’s address. 

  4.  Pursuant to §767.75, Wis. Stats., a withholding assignment or order under this 

section has priority over any other assignment, garnishment, or similar legal 
process under Wisconsin law.  The employer shall not withhold more of the 
employee’s disposable income than allowed pursuant to the Federal Consumer 
Credit Protection Act unless the employee agrees to have the full amount 
withheld.  No employer may use an assignment under this section to deny 
employment, or to discharge or take disciplinary action against an employee. 
If the court orders child support or maintenance, the parties shall annually 
exchange financial information no later than May 1 or  
of each year including all of the following: 

 Other: [Date]            

 

  A complete copy of the party’s federal and state income tax return for 
the prior calendar year, including all W-2 forms and 1099 forms. 

  A year-end paycheck stub from all sources of employment for the prior 

calendar year. 

  The party’s most recent paycheck stub from all sources of employment 

showing year-to-date gross and net income.  

  Any other documentation of the party’s income from all sources for the 

12-month period preceding the exchange of information. 

 party who fails to furnish the information as required by the court under this 
subsection may be proceeded against for contempt of court under ch. 785, Wis. 
Stats. If the court finds that a party has failed to furnish the information required 
under this subsection, the court may award to the party bringing the action costs 
and, notwithstanding §814.04(1), Wis. Stats., reasonable attorney fees. Failure 
by a party to timely file a complete disclosure statement as required hereunder 
shall authorize the court to accept as accurate any information provided in the 
statement of the other party or obtained under §49.22(2m), Wis. Stats., by WI 
SCTF or the county child support agency under §59.53(5), Wis. Stats.

the judgment does not necessarily affect the ability of a creditor to proceed 
against a party or against that party's property even though the party is not 
responsible for the debt under the terms of the judgment. 

  3.  an instrument executed by a party before the judgment naming the other party 

as a beneficiary is not necessarily affected by the judgment and it may be

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
