information each year 
if other than May 1.  
 

Any court order regarding child support, legal custody, or physical placement is not final and 
may be modified under an appropriate change of circumstances. 

If any court order references child support or maintenance, the parties shall annually 
exchange financial information no later than May 1 or  
including all of the following: 

 Other: [Date]            

 of each year 

  A complete copy of the party’s federal and state income tax return for the prior 

calendar year, including all W-2 forms and 1099 forms. 

  A year-end paycheck stub from all sources of employment for the prior calendar 

year.

§767.34, Wisconsin Statutes 

This form shall not be modified.  It may be supplemented with additional material.

  The party’s most recent paycheck stub from all sources of employment showing 

year-to-date gross and net income.  

Any other documentation of the party’s income from all sources for the 12-month 
period preceding the exchange of information. 

Whenever private, accessible and reasonably-priced health insurance becomes available to 
either parent at a reasonable cost, that parent shall enroll the child(ren) under the plan, 
unless the child(ren) are already enrolled under another private health insurance plan or 
unless the parent's income is below 150% of the federal poverty level. 

Any court order regarding the division of property is final as of the date of the final hearing 
and can never be changed. 

There are certain legal presumptions under Wisconsin law, such as: 

  Marital property should be divided 50/50. 
  Legal custody of minor children should be granted jointly to both parents. 
  A child born or conceived during the marriage is presumed to be a child of both 

parties. 

 

 
  Q. VOLUNTARY EXECUTION / NATURE OF DOCUMENT 
 

I assume responsibility for the entire content of this document. It is entered into freely and 
voluntarily and not because of any undue influence.  I believe the terms to be fair and 
reasonable under the circumstances.   

 acknowledge that there may be substantial legal and tax implications with regard to this 
document.  I understand that lack of knowledge of the law may not be sufficient to convince 
the court that relief from these provisions is required.  I acknowledge that I have the right to 
seek the advice of my own personal attorney.   
 

 
  R. GENERAL RELEASE 
 

The parties are released from any claim of any nature that may exist. Neither party may, at 
any time, sue the other, or heirs, personal representatives, and assigns, for the purpose of 
enforcing any or all of the rights relinquished and/or waived under this document.  In the 
event any suit shall be commenced, this release, when pleaded, shall constitute a complete 
defense to any such claim or suit so instituted by the other party.  I understand that this 
general release shall not become effective until this Marital Settlement is approved by the 
court. 
 

 
  S.  FULL DISCLOSURE AND RELIANCE 
 

I warrant that I have provided an accurate, complete, and current disclosure of all income, 
assets, debts, and liabilities. I have reviewed any financial disclosures made by the other 
party.  I understand that deliberate failure to provide complete disclosure constitutes perjury 
under §767.127, Wis. Stats., and a fraud upon the court.  The property referred to in this 
document represents all the property in which either party has any interest.  
 

Neither party may interfere with the personal liberty of the other, or go on the premises 
occupied by the other as a residence except with permission of that party. 
 

 
  T.  RESTRAINING ORDER

that may be necessary to carry out the terms and conditions of this document. 
 

 
  V.  DIVESTING OF PROPERTY RIGHTS 
 

The parties give up all rights to the property awarded to the other, except as otherwise 
provided for in this document. 

ll property awarded to a party shall be the separate property of that party. The parties shall 

 

have the right to manage their separate property as if they had never been married.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
