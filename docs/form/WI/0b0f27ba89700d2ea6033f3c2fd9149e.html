  The address provided to the court is the address on which the other 
parties may rely for service of any motion relating to modification of 
legal custody or physical placement or to relocating the child's 
residence. 

  A parent granted periods of physical placement with the child must

  5.  Parties are notified of the provisions of §948.31, Wis. Stats., as follows: 
 

 
 
§948.31 Interference with custody by parent or others. 
 
 

(1)   
 

(a)  In this subsection, “legal custodian of a child” means: 

  1.  A parent or other person having legal custody of the child under an 

order or judgment in an action for divorce, legal separation, annulment, 
child custody, paternity, guardianship or habeas corpus. 

 

  2.  The department of children and families or the department of 

corrections or any person, county department under s. 46.215, 46.22 or 
46.23 or licensed child welfare agency, if custody or supervision of the 
child has been transferred under ch. 48 or 938 to that department, 
person or agency. 

 

(b)  Except as provided under chs. 48 and 938, whoever intentionally causes a 

child to leave, takes a child away or withholds a child for more than 12 hours 
beyond the court-approved period of physical placement or visitation period 
from a legal custodian with intent to deprive the custodian of his or her custody 
rights without the consent of the custodian is guilty of a Class F felony.  This 
paragraph is not applicable if the Court has entered an order authorizing the 
person to so take or withhold the child.  The fact that joint legal custody has 
been awarded to both parents by a court does not preclude a court from 
finding that one parent has committed a violation of this paragraph. 

(2)  Whoever causes a child to leave, takes a child away or withholds a child for more 
than 12 hours from the child’s parents or, in the case of a nonmarital child whose 
parents do not subsequently intermarry under s. 767.803, from the child’s mother or, if 
he has been granted legal custody, the child’s father, without the consent of the 
parents, the mother or the father with legal custody, is guilty of a Class I felony.  This 
subsection is not applicable if the legal custody has been granted by court order to the 
person taking or withholding the child. 

(3)  Any parent, or any person acting pursuant to directions from the parent, who does any 

of the following is guilty of a Class F felony: 
 
 

(a)  Intentionally conceals a child from the child’s other parent.

or her child in a situation in which the parent or authorized person 
reasonably believes that there is a threat of physical harm or sexual 
assault to the child;

(b)  A defendant who raises an affirmative defense has the burden of proving the 

defense  by a preponderance of the evidence. 

(5)  The venue of an action under this section is prescribed in s. 971.19(18), which incurred

shall hold an evidentiary hearing to determine the amount of reasonable expenses. 

(6)  In addition to any other penalties provided for violation of this section, a court may 

order a violator to pay restitution, regardless of whether the violator is placed on 
probation under s.973.09, to provide reimbursement for any reasonable expenses 
incurred by any person or any governmental entity locating and returning the child.  
Any such amounts paid by the violator shall be paid to the person or governmental 
entity which incurred the expense on a prorated basis.  Upon the application of any 
interested party, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing to determine the amount of 
reasonable expenses. 
  F.  Child Support/Maintenance 
 

  1.  Pursuant to §767.75, Wis. Stats., this judgment constitutes an immediate 

assignment of all commissions, earnings, salaries, wages, pension benefits, 
benefits under Chapter 102 or 108, and other money due or to be due in the 
future, to the WI SCTF.  The assignment shall be for an amount sufficient to 
ensure payment under this judgment, so long as the addition of the amount 
toward arrears does not leave the party at an income below the poverty line 
established under 42 USC 9902(2). 

  2.  Pursuant to §767.57(1)(a), Wis. Stats., all payments for child support and/or 

maintenance ordered shall note the case number and the names of the parties 
on the face of the check, should be made payable to WI SCTF, and sent to: 
 

Wisconsin Support Collections Trust Fund 
Box 74200 
Milwaukee, WI  53274-0200. 

The WI SCTF will transmit the payments to the proper persons entitled to them. 

Failure of an employer to pay the proper amount shall not be a defense for 
failure to pay the proper amount. If an employer fails to take out the correct 
amount for child support and/or maintenance, the party paying is responsible 
for paying the full and correct amount directly to WI SCTF. 

Pursuant to §767.57(1e), Wis. Stats., the party making payment for child 
support and/or maintenance is responsible for payment of the annual receiving 
and disbursing fee to WI SCTF. 
Pursuant to §767.57(1e)(c), Wis. Stats., an annual fee will be deducted by WI 
SCTF from payments to recipients of child support.

  3.  Both parties shall notify, in writing, the other party and the Clerk of Court and 
the Child Support Agency of the county in which this action is filed, within 10 
business days, of any change of employer and employer’s address, and of any 
substantial change in the amount of his/her income, including receipt of bonus 
compensation, such that his/her ability to pay support is affected.  Notification 
of any substantial change in the amount of the payer’s income will not result in 
a change in the order unless a revision or adjustment of the order is sought.  

f the child support order includes more than one child, child support does not 
automatically adjust when a child reaches the age of majority and is no longer 
eligible for child support. 

  4.  A party ordered to pay child support shall pay simple interest rate according to 

statutory rate on any amount in arrears that is equal to or greater than the 
amount of support due in 1 month.  If there is no current order, interest shall 
accrue on the balances due. 

  5.  Pursuant to §767.75, Wis. Stats., a withholding assignment or order under this 

section has priority over any other assignment, garnishment, or similar legal 
process under Wisconsin law.  The employer shall not withhold more of the 
employee’s disposable income than allowed pursuant to the Federal 
Consumer Credit Protection Act unless the employee agrees to have the full 
amount withheld.  No employer may use an assignment under this section to 
deny employment, or to discharge or take disciplinary action against an 
employee. 
If the court orders child support or maintenance, the parties shall annually 
exchange financial information no later than May 1 or  
of each year including all of the following: 

 Other: [Date]            

 

  A complete copy of the party’s federal and state income tax return for 
the prior calendar year, including all W-2 forms and 1099 forms. 

  A year-end paycheck stub from all sources of employment for the 

prior calendar year. 

  The party’s most recent paycheck stub from all sources of 
employment showing year-to-date gross and net income.  

  Any other documentation of the party’s income from all sources for 

the 12-month period preceding the exchange of information. 

 party who fails to furnish the information as required by the court under this 

subsection may be proceeded against for contempt of court under ch. 785, 
Wis. Stats.  If the court finds that a party has failed to furnish the information 
required under this subsection, the court may award to the party bringing the 
action costs and, notwithstanding §814.04(1), Wis. Stats., reasonable attorney 
fees.  Failure by a party to timely file a complete disclosure statement as 
required hereunder shall authorize the court to accept as accurate any 
information provided in the statement of the other party or obtained under 
§49.22(2m), Wis. Stats., by WI SCTF or the county child support agency under 
§59.53(5), Wis. Stats.
