•  Affidavit Regarding Background Study (GAC102). 

Filing Fee 

 

There will be a fee when filing these documents, unless there is a fee waiver on file.  Check with 
court administration in the county where the case is located for more details.   

Step 8 
Make Copies, Serve Copies, and File Affidavits of Service 

NOTE: Originals must be filed with Court Administration.  Make a copy of everything you file for your 
records. 

Make enough copies for yourself, the person subject to guardianship/conservatorship, and any 
interested persons that need to be served. 

Serving the Person Subject to Guardianship/Conservatorship 

Ask Court Admnistration if a “Court Visitor” will be appointed to meet with the person subject to 
guardianship/conservatorship.  

• 

• 

If a Court Visitor is appointed, then the Court Visitor will serve the person subject to 
guardianship/conservatorship with the papers. 
If no Court Visitor is appointed, then you are responsible for arranging personal service of the 
Notice of Hearing and Notice of Rights and the Petition for Appointment of Successor 
Guardian and/or Succesor Conservator on the person subject to 
guardianship/conservatorship at least 14 days before the hearing.  NOTE: papers cannot be 
served on a legal holiday as defined in Minn. Stat. § 645.44, subd. 5 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44#stat.645.44.5). You cannot be the one to 
serve (a sheriff or another adult must personally serve the forms).  The person who hand-
delivers the papers will need to fill out the Affidavit of Service (GAC 2-U). 

Serving Interested Persons 

Overview 

Interested persons (including the head of the facility if the person subject to 
guardianship/conservatorship is a patient of a state hospital, regional center, or any state-operated 
service) must receive the Notice of Hearing and Notice of Rights and the Petition for Appointment of 
Successor Guardian and/or Successor Conservator. This is called “service of process.”  The papers 
can be served personally (handed to the interested person), or by mail.  The interested persons 
must be served at least 14 days before the hearing.  If papers are served by mail, Court Rules require 
adding 3 days, so the papers served by mail must be postmarked at least 17 days before the hearing.

Glossary 

ffidavit: A statement made under penalty of perjury (Minn. Stat. § 358.116). 

Anniversary Date: The date (month-day-year) that the Letters of Guardianship and/or 
Conservatorship were issued (signed by the judicial officer) is the anniversary date.  This date 
remains fixed from year to year and is the date that is used to determine the period-ending date for 
filing annual reports and other required documents.   

Bond: A promise by a bonding company that protects the person subject to conservatorship from 
mismanagement by the conservator.  In the event of mismanagement, the court may decide that 
the bond will reimburse the estate for the missing money, and the company that issued the bond

Burden of Proof:  Responsibility of a party to prove a fact.  The amount of proof required varies with 
the type of case.  In guardianship and conservatorship cases, the burden of proof is clear and 
convincing evidence. 

CAAP: The Conservator Account Auditing Program (CAAP) provides centralized oversight of 
conservator accounts. 

CARP: The Conservator Account Review Program (CARP) reviews inventories and accounts of 
conservators not subject to audit. 

Contested: When any party objects to the petition or to the hearing. 

Continuance: When the court has agreed to postpone the hearing date. 

Co-Conservator (also, Co-Guardian): When more than one person is appointed to serve as a 
decision-maker. 

Conservator: A person appointed by the court to make financial decisions for the protected person.  
A conservator typically has the power to enter into contracts, pay bills, invest assets, and perform 
other financial functions for the person subject to conservatorship. 

Conservatorship: A conservatorship exists when the court appoints a conservator to handle 
financial matters for another person.  The person for whom a conservator handles financial affairs is 
called a person subject to conservatorship.  Conservatorships are appointed to protect the finances 
of the person subject to conservatorship. 

Emergency Conservatorship (Guardianship): In emergency situations where the process of 
petitioning for a general conservatorship (or guardianship) is reasonably expected to cause danger 
to the respondent’s personal safety or financial security, an emergency conservatorship (or 
guardianship) may be requested.  In this instance, the requirement of providing a minimum of two 
weeks’ notice to the respondent and interested persons is waived.  An emergency conservatorship 
(or guardianship) is granted for a specific, usually short, duration. 

Estate: A person’s income, assets, real estate, or any other financial holdings. 

Guardian: The person appointed by the court to make personal decisions for the person subject to 
guardianship, such as where to live, medical decisions, training and education, etc.

decisions for another person.  The person for whom a guardian handles personal affairs is called a 
person subject to guardianship.  Guardianships are only appointed to protect the personal well-
being of the person subject to guardianship. 

Hearing: A court proceeding that is conducted before a judge or referee which allows a person or 
persons to present their case. 

Incapacitated person: An individual who, for reasons other than being a minor, is impaired to the 
extent of lacking sufficient understanding or capacity to make personal decisions and who is unable 
to meet personal needs for medical care, nutrition, clothing, shelter, or safety, even with 
appropriate tehnological and supported decision making assistance. 

In Forma Pauperis (IFP) (Fee Waiver): Minnesota law states that the court may authorize a case to 
proceed in formal pauperis, without payment of court costs for those who qualify based on current 
federal poverty guidelines.  See Minn. Stat. § 563.01.  The court will consider the income and assets 
of the person subject to guardianship.  Another law states that counties may be responsible for 
paying guardian, attorney, or health care professional fees to establish or maintain guardianships.  
See Minn. Stat. § 524.5-502. 

Indigent: A person with little money or property. 

Interested Party: a person who has suffered some injury-in-fact, a person who is the beneficiary of 
some legislative enactment granting standing, or a person who must have sufficient personal 
interest in the matter so that it is appropriate to allow that person to participate in the matter. 

Interested Person: According to Minn. Stat. § 524.5-102, subd. 7, an “interested person” includes: 

•  The adult subject to guardianship or conservatorship, or respondent; 
•  The nominated guardian or conservator, or the appointed guardian or conservator; 
•  Legal representative; 
•  The spouse, parent, adult children (including adult step-children of a living spouse), and 

siblings; or if none of these are living or can be located, then the next of kin of the person 
subject to guardianship, person subject to conservatorship, or respondent; 

•  An adult person who has lived with the person subject to guardianship, person subject to 

conservatorship, or respondent, for more than 6 months;

Less Restrictive Alternative: If there are other ways to assist an individual with their care and 
management of their finances, such as a family member providing the individual with assistance in 
making personal or financial decisions or appointing a Power of Attorney, these methods are

guardian or conservator, less restrictive alternatives must be explored and ruled out before 
petitioning for the appointment of a guardianship or conservatorship. 

Oath: A sworn promise to perform and act faithfully and truthfully. 

Penalty of Perjury: Perjury is the crime of intentionally lying or misrepresenting the truth. By signing under

Person Subject to Guardianship: A minor or incapacitated adult who has a court-appointed 
guardian, lacks sufficient understanding or capacity to make or communicate responsible personal 
decisions, and who has an inability to meet personal needs for medical care, nutrition, clothing, 
shelter, or safety.  Before the rule changes in August 2020, this person was called the “ward.”

lack the capacity or ability to make decisions regarding their financial affairs or estate. Before the 
rule changes in August 2020, this person was called the “protected person.”
