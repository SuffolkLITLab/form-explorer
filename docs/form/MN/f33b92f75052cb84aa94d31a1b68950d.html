•  The court-ordered support obligation for basic child support and/or spousal maintenance. 

Definitions 

Findings of Fact 

Obligor means the party who owes and pays child  support and/or spousal maintenance to the other 
party. 

Obligee means the party who receives  child support and/or spousal maintenance from the other 
party. 

 

1.  In paragraph #1, you will  include information about the Obligor (the person court-ordered to 

pay child  support and/or spousal maintenance). 

a.  List the Obligor’s name. 

Respondent. 

c.  Include the Obligor’s address. 

b.  Check the box to let the court know whether the Obligor is the Petitioner or 

NOTE: If this is a new address, please give court administration  the address.  
Minnesota law requires you to report any new addresses to the court. 

d.  Include the Obligor’s date of birth (MM/DD/YYYY.  For example: 08/18/1998).

3.  In paragraph #3, fill  out the dollar amount of the current court-ordered monthly obligation: 

a.  For basic  child support (if there is not a court order to pay basic child  support, you can 

fill in “N/A” for “not applicable”); and/or 

b.  For spousal maintenance (if there is not a court order to pay spousal maintenance, you 

can fill in “N/A”). 

4.  The information for #4 is found on the Notice of Cost-of-Living Adjustment. 

First, include the percentage of increase. 

Then list the current year.  NOTE: the first two numbers (20__) are already printed, so you 
only need to fill in the last two numbers. 

If the cost-of-living adjustment goes into effect, tell what the new amounts would be for: 

a.  Basic child  support (or, if no court order for basic child  support, fill in “N/A”); and/or 

b.  Spousal maintenance obligation (or, if no court order, fill in “N/A”). 

 

 

 

Part 2 – AGREEMENT AND REQUEST FOR COURT ORDER 

The second half of the Agreement describes what you and the other party have agreed to about the 
cost-of-living adjustment. 

5.  There are two options in paragraph #5.  You may choose only one option.  You and the other 

party can agree:

Rev 3/23                www.mncourts.gov/forms  
CSX1104      State       ENG 

Page 4 of 9 

•  OPTION 1 – There will be NO cost-of-living increase in court ordered basic child 

support and/or spousal maintenance. 

If you choose this option, fill  in the last 2 digits of the current year. 

OR 

•  OPTION 2 – There will be a partial cost-of-living adjustment.   

This means there will  be a change to the current support obligation, but not in the 
percentage and amount listed in the Notice of Cost-of-Living Adjustment. 

If you choose this option, fill  in the last 2 digits of the current year.  Then show the 
amount you have agreed on: 

a.  For basic  support (or, if no court order for basic child support, fill  in “N/A”); 

and/or 

b.  For spousal maintenance (or, if no court order, fill in “N/A”). 

 

 

6.  This section tells the court the basis for your agreement (why you and the other party are 

agreeing to waive, or partially  waive, the cost-of-living increase. 

If the reason is that the Obligor’s income has not increased by the same percentage as the 
cost-of-living increase that was proposed in the Notice, check the first box under #6. 

If there are other reasons you and the other party agree to waive or partially  waive the cost-
of-living adjustment, check the second box and included on the lines proved.  Some examples 
might be that the cost of providing insurance has increased, or that the Obligor is paying for 
things that were not ordered by the court, such as car insurance, a cell phone bill, athletic 
fees, or other needs of the children.

will be about the cost-of-living adjustment  and child  support and/or spousal maintenance. 

Part 3 – COURT ORDER 

1.  List the current year. 

things: 

a.  Check this box if your agreement is about the basic support  obligation.  Then state 2 

•  The amount of basic support you and the other party have agreed on; and 

•  Whether this amount is the current amount (which means you have agreed

adjustment. 

b.  Check this box if your agreement is about the spousal maintenance obligation.  Then 

state 2 things: 

on; and 

•  The amount of spousal maintenance you and the other party have agreed

(which means you have agreed to a partial  waiver of the cost-of-living 
adjustment. 

 

 

2.  You do not have to do anything for #2.  This statement is meant for you to agree and 

understand that the Order will not apply to future cost-of-living adjustments. 

 

Signature Block 

Each party should read through the Agreement  and Order at least one more time to make sure it 
contains the parties’ full agreement.

Page 6 of 9 

NOTE: Details of an agreement that are not included in this Agreement and Order may not be 
enforceable later.  

Once both parties are sure the form is complete: 

A.  The Petitioner should sign the line on the left side of the page. 

B.  List the date the Petitioner signed the form.  Then check the box telling whether the Petition is 

the Obligor or the Obligee. 

C.  Print Petitioner’s name. 

D.  List the county and state Petitioner is in when they sign the Agreement and Order. 

E.  Repeat Steps A – D on the right side for the Respondent. 

You will  each sign this document under penalty of perjury.  This means you are saying that everything 
in the form is true and correct.  If you know something in the form is not true when you sign it, you 
could be found guilty of the crime of perjury.  See Minn. Stat. § 609.48 
(revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.48).

Step 2 
County Attorney 

If the county child support agency is involved in your case, then contact the public  authority in your 
county to ask them to review the completed Agreement.  

The county child  support office (public authority) in the county where the children live can put you in 
touch with the county attorney’s office (mn.gov/dhs/people-we-serve/children-and-
familes/services/child-support/contact-us/county-offices.jsp). 

If the public authority agrees to the terms you included in the Agreement, then a representative of 
the public authority or county attorney’s office will date and sign the Agreement.  

If the public authority DOES NOT AGREE, you can talk to the public authority to see what their 
concerns are. Maybe you can reach an agreement with the public authority. If you cannot reach an 
agreement with the public  authority, and the county child  support agency is involved in your case, 
then the Agreement form is not the right form for your situation. You may need to get legal advice to 
see what your options are (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx). 

 

 

Step 3 
File with Court Administration and Pay Any Required Court Fee 

If you want copies of the forms you have filled out, make copies before you file them with the court.  

You will  need to file the following form with Court Administration:  

•  Agreement and Order to Waiver (or Partially Waive) Cost-of-Living Adjustment. 

There may be a filing  fee due when you file the Agreement.  If you did not pay an initial  filing fee 
when this case first began, you will  now need to pay the filing fee. 

If you cannot afford to pay the filing  fee, a child support magistrate or other judicial officer may waive 
it under certain circumstances.  The fee waiver paperwork is available from court administration  or 
online at https://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=19&p=69.  A child  support magistrate or other 
judicial  officer will review your fee waiver application  and then decide whether you must pay the fee.  
If the magistrate or other judicial officer does not sign an order that waives the fee, you must be 
prepared to pay the fee. 

HOW TO FILE:

Rev 3/23                www.mncourts.gov/forms  
CSX1104      State       ENG 

Page 8 of 9 

At the Courthouse:  

•  File the forms with Court Administration.  
•  This can be done either in person at the courthouse or by mail. Addresses for courthouses are 

online at https://www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx. 

Electronic Filing through  eFS System:  

• 

If you have an account, or want to create one, with the eFS System, you can file electronically 
(eFile). See https://www.mncourts.gov/eFile.  

•  NOTE: Once you decide to eFile, you must continue to eFile for the entire case.  
•  Along with the filing fee and costs, there is also a fee of $5  for using the eFS System when a 
fee is collected. If a judicial  officer has granted you a fee waiver (IFP), the $5  fee is waived. 

Filing Deadline 

 

The Agreement must be filed before the effective date of the cost-of-living adjustment.  If you 
received the notice about the cost-of-living adjustment from the county child  support agency, then 
you must file your Agreement by April 30th. 

The court will review the form and any attachments you have filed.  

What to Expect Next… 

You will  hear from Court Administration soon after you file. You might receive one or more of the 
following: 

•  Deficiency Notice (a notice that tells the parties there is a deficiency in their filing;  for 

example, that something is missing or that a filing fee needs to be paid) 

•  Notice of Hearing (a notice that tells the parties that a hearing has been scheduled and gives 
details such as the date, time, and location  of the hearing).  There may be a hearing if the 
court has questions or concerns about your agreement. 

If the court approves your agreement, the judicial officer will  sign the “Order” section of your 
Agreement.  Once Court Administration  enters the signed Agreement, which becomes a court order if 
a judicial officer signs it, you will  receive a copy in the mail.
