General Information About The Summary Real Estate Disposition 
Judgment Form  

he information contained in this document is not intended as legal advice but as a general 
guide to you to explain the legal process.  If you do not understand any of these procedures, 
talk to an attorney.  Court staff cannot give legal advice. 

Under Minnesota law, both spouses have an interest in real estate, even if only one spouse’s 
name is on the deed or title of the property.  

Proof of divorce and proof of who was awarded interests in the real estate is usually recorded in 
the real estate records before selling or mortgaging the property after the divorce. 

To give that proof, the complete divorce decree can be filed in the real estate records. Or, a short 
version of the divorce decree can be filed, called Summary Real Estate Disposition Judgment 
Form (SREDJ). The SREDJ only includes information needed for real estate title purposes. If 
you file the SREDJ, information about your children, work, and other personal matters is not 
available in the county real estate records.

decree. 

4.  If the Petitioner (the first person listed in your caption on the top of the page) represented

the page) represented themselves in the divorce case and did not have an attorney, check 
the box “was not represented by an attorney.”  If the Respondent/Co-Petitioner did have 
an attorney, check the box “was represented by the following attorney” and write the 
name of the attorney.

6.  Check the box that matches the way the divorce Summons and Petition was served (the 

paperwork that started your divorce case) on the other party:  

  Check “joint petition for dissolution, no summons required” if you filed your 
divorce together because you agreed on all issues when you first filed for 
divorce.  

  Check “personally” if the spouse who started the divorce served the other 

spouse by having someone else hand-deliver the divorce papers OR if your 
spouse signed an Admission of Service or a Waiver of Service.

the information about:  

•  The name of the legal newspaper*,  
•  The county the legal newspaper was circulated* in, and 
•  The three dates the notice was published.* 

*This information is on the Affidavit of Publication and attached 
newspaper clipping the newspaper sent you after publication was 
finished. Please read it carefully.  

Note: If you don’t know how service was done, you can check your divorce case record 
to see if an Affidavit of Service, Admission of Service, Waiver of Service, or an Affidavit 
of Publication was filed. You can access some case records on the court’s website at 
http://www.mncourts.gov/Access-Case-Records.aspx . You could also go to a courthouse 
or try contacting court administration in the county where your divorce case was filed.  
Contact information for each court can be found at http://www.mncourts.gov/Find-
Courts.aspx .

8. Check the boxes that match the way your case moved forward after your divorce case was 

started, shown above as a, b, OR c:  

Note: For a or b, the legal description is not the street address. If you cannot check “yes” 
because the legal description is not included, or if you’re not sure if the legal description is

a.  Check “Stipulation or Joint Petition for Dissolution” if your case was 

started with a Joint Petition (you filed your divorce case together with your 
ex-spouse because you agreed on all issues when you first filed for divorce) 
OR if you and your spouse didn’t file your case together but later came to an 
agreement and filed a Stipulation telling the court what your agreement was.    

•  Then check “yes” if the legal description for the real estate is written 

in the Joint Petition or Stipulation.   

b.  Check “Default” if one spouse started the divorce by serving the Summons 
and Petition and the other spouse did not file an Answer, did not sign a 
Stipulation, and did not attend a court hearing.  

•  Then check “yes” if the legal description for the real estate is written 

in the Petition.  

•  Then check “yes” if the Petition says who should get the real estate 
AND the Judgment and Decree matches what was asked for in the 
Petition.   

Note: if you cannot check “yes”, then STOP and get legal 
advice from a lawyer before continuing.   

• 

If there was a court hearing in your case, write in the names of the 
people who appeared in court.  If you or your spouse were not 
represented by a lawyer in court, you can write in your name(s). If 
you, or your spouse had a lawyer represent you in court, you can write 
the lawyers name(s). If there was not a hearing in your case you may 
leave it blank or write “no hearing was held.” 

c.  Check “Trial” if one spouse started the divorce by serving the Summons and 

Petition and you had a trial.  

•  Then write in the names of the people who appeared in court. If you or 
your spouse were not represented by a lawyer in court, you can write 
in your name(s). If you, or your spouse had a lawyer represent you in 
court, you can write the lawyers name(s).

your Judgment and Decree.  If neither party’s name was changed, check the box next to 
“neither party.” 

 

10 

10. If your Judgment and Decree listed former names (names you’ve been known as in the 
past) for you or your spouse, check the box next to which party has former names listed 
in the Judgment and Decree and write the former names exactly as it appears in your 
Judgment and Decree.  If neither party had former names listed in the Judgment and 
Decree, check the box next to “neither party.” 

 

 

Note: The next section of the form, section 8, has 7 parts (a-g) for each parcel (piece) of real 
estate. If you have more than one parcel of real estate, you will need to give this information for 
each parcel. You can put the information for “Parcel 1” here. There is space for additional 
parcels on the pages after the signature line on a page marked “Exhibit A”.  If only have one 
parcel of real estate you do not need to write on or file the “Exhibit A” pages after the signature 
line.  

Also note: For section 8, you can either:

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
