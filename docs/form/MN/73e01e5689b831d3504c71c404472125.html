General Information about Docketing a Judgment 

The information in these instructions is a general guide to explain the legal process for docketing 
a civil judgment issued by a Minnesota state court. If you do not understand any of the following 
steps or do not know if these forms are right for your situation, you should speak with an 
attorney for legal advice. Court staff cannot give legal advice. 

Definitions 

•  Docketing:  A  formal  process  to  record  a  money judgment  with the  court  and  make  the 
amount of the judgment a “lien” against certain real estate the debtor owns in that county. 
The judgment creditor must first have a court order that awards the money judgment in 
their favor and the court must direct entry of the judgment. Once a judgment has been 
entered in the court record, the judgment creditor may file an Affidavit of Identification of 
Judgment Debtor (JGM104) to have the judgment “docketed.” 

• 

• 

Judgment Creditor: the party who is owed money or other property 

Judgment Debtor: the party who owes money or property 

What is the reason for docketing a judgment? 

Minn. Stat. § 548.09 (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/548.09) created the process for 
docketing a judgment, which allows the judgment creditor to enforce and collect the judgment. 
The judgment creditor must docket the judgment to: 

•  Create a lien (a legal claim in property) against certain real estate owned by the judgment 

debtor. 

•  Bring an enforcement action against the judgment debtor to get the judgment debtor to 
pay the judgment amount. For example, requesting a Writ of Execution to levy (seize) the 
judgment debtor’s bank account or wages. 

•  Find out about the judgment debtor’s assets, bank, and employer, if unknown, by asking 
the court to order the judgment debtor to fill out and return a Financial Disclosure 
(JGM301). 

Who can use these forms and instructions? 

You can use these forms and follow these instructions if all of the following are true: 

•  You have a court order granting you a judgment, and court administration has entered 

that judgment in the case; 

•  Your judgment has a specific dollar amount; 

•  Your judgment is free of conditions (example of a condition: Judgment in favor of plaintiff 

for $500 against defendant upon sale of the car); and

•  Your judgment was entered in a Minnesota state court (there are separate instructions for 

docketing a judgment from a court outside of Minnesota; see JGM101). 

These forms and instructions may not be right for you, and you may want to get legal advice if 
your judgment is for: 

•  Unpaid Child Support (see the Child Support Help Topic, http://www.mncourts.gov/Help-

Topics/Child-Support.aspx , for more information). 

•  Unpaid Spousal Maintenance (see the Entry and Docketing Spousal Maintenance 

Judgments forms packet, http://www.mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=34&p=92 , for 
more information). 

If your judgment has not been entered, does not have a specific dollar amount, or has conditions 
that must be met, you may need to file other paperwork with the court before you can docket 
the judgment. 

If you are the victim in a delinquency or criminal case and want to docket an Order for 
Judgment for Restitution, please be aware that this form will ask you to give your 
address, phone number, and email. This information will be public and the defendant 

will be able to see it. If you are not comfortable giving this information, talk to an attorney for 
advice on how you can ask to keep this information confidential. 

When can I docket the judgment? 

If your judgment was awarded in conciliation court, and you received your Order for Judgment 
electronically or in person, you must wait 21 days from the date of entry of judgment before you 
can docket it. If the court mailed the Order for Judgment, you must wait 24 days from the date of 
entry of judgment. The last day of the timeframe should be noted on your Notice of Conciliation 
Court Order and/or Order and Entry of Judgment. 

For judgments awarded in all other case types, you may docket the judgment once it is entered. 

Do you have all the information you need to fill out the forms? 

The Affidavit of Identification of Judgment Debtor (JGM104) asks for the following information: 

•  The county and judicial district number where the case is filed. 
•  The names of the judgment debtors. 
•  The home and mailing addresses of the judgment debtors. 
•  The type of employment of the judgment debtors. 
•  The business address of the judgment debtors. 

 

Step 1 
Fill Out Affidavit of Identification of Judgment Debtor (JGM104)

Page 3 of 8 

If there are multiple judgment debtors, you will need to repeat this step for each one. You should 
have one Affidavit of Identification of Judgment Debtor (JGM104) for each judgment debtor. The 
judgment will only be docketed against the judgment debtors you include on each form. 

The “Caption”  

A. 

List the county where you will docket the judgment. You will typically docket your 
judgment in the county where: 

•  Your judgment was granted, if this is your first time docketing the judgment. 

•  The judgment debtor’s real estate is located, if different from where the judgment 
was granted. To do this, you must first docket the judgment in the county where it 
was granted. 

B. 

List the Judicial District. If you are filing in the same county where the case was filed, this 
is on your court order. Each county belongs in 1 of 10 judicial districts. If you need help, 
see http://www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx. 

ill in the Court File Number for your case. If your judgment is already docketed, and you 
are trying to docket it in a different Minnesota county, leave this blank. 

ill in the case type. This is typically going to be the same as your current case, but there 
are some exceptions. If you do not know the Civil Case Type, you can find the list of Civil 
Case Types at 
https://www.mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/scao_library/documents/eFile%20Sup
port/Handout-Case-Type-Index.pdf . 

C. 

Fill in the names of the parties, exactly as it appears in the court order. This information 
stays the same no matter who is awarded the judgment. For example, if you are the 
defendant in the case, you will continue to be the defendant.  

**NOTE** If you are docketing an Order for Judgment for Restitution, you, the victim, will 
be the plaintiff.

ii.  Check whether the person has a different mailing address. If yes, give the 

mailing address. This can be a post office box. 

iii.  This question asks about the person’soccupation. Fill in what the person 

primarily does for a living. Examples include “student, IT, consultant.” If the 
person has multiple occupations, you can choose to list all of the 
occupations, or the one the person does most. 

ote: if this business is also a judgment debtor, writing the name and 
location of the business here does not count as identifying the business 
and will not docket the judgment against the business. You must fill out 
another Affidavit of Identification of Judgment Debtor (JGM104) to identify 
and docket the judgment against the business. 

  N

iv.  Check whether the person owns a business. If yes, fill in the name and 
address where the business is located. Give as much information as 
possible. 

Skip #4b and go to the Signature Block. 

b. 

Check this box if the judgment debtor is a business. 

 

i.  Fill in the full address of the business; give as much information as possible. 

ii.  Check whether the business has a different mailing address. If yes, fill it in

Signature Block 

A. 

Sign your name under penalty of perjury. Then print your name on the line under your 
signature. 

By signing your name under penalty of perjury, you are stating that the information in 
the document is true to the best of your knowledge. If you know something in the form 
is not true when you sign it, you could be found guilty of the crime of perjury (see Minn. 
Stat. § 609.48, https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.48). 

List the date you signed the form. 

List the county and state you were in when you signed the form.  

Fill in your address, telephone number, and email address if you have one. 

If you are not an attorney, skip this part. Attorneys, write your firm name and attorney 
license number.

C. 

D. 

E. 

 

Step 2 
File Your Paperwork with Court Administration 

File the original Affidavit of Identification of Judgment Debtor (JGM104) with court 
administration along with any additional paperwork you may have. You will file in the county 
you wrote in the case caption of your paperwork. 

Depending on the judgment you are docketing, you may have to pay a fee. The fee is for a 
“Transcript of Judgment Docketed in District Court,” and is listed online at 
https://www.mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Court-Fees.aspx. Search under “District Court” then

JGM102      State       ENG 

4/21                   www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 7 of 8 

choose the county where you are filing with the Fee Category as “Judgments” to find the filing 
fee. The fee will automatically be added to your judgment. 

Some common situations where you have to pay a filing fee include docketing a conciliation 
court judgment, and docketing a judgment in another county. If you do not know if you have to 
pay a fee, call your local county court administration or the Statewide Self-Help Center (651-
435-6535). 

If you cannot afford to pay the fee, fill out the Fee Waiver (IFP) and file it with your other 
paperwork. You can find the Fee Waiver forms online at 
http://www.mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=19&p=69. You will need to fill out the Fee Waiver 
forms even if your fees were waived in your conciliation court case. 

 

Step 3 
Next Steps: Collect Your Judgment 

You will receive notice when court administration dockets your judgment. Depending on your 
case type, you may have to wait a certain period of time (typically 30 days) from the date of 
docketing before you can continue the collection process. You may also get a new court file 
number, and you must use this new number when collecting your judgment. 

Do you know what or where the judgment debtor’s assets, bank, or employer are? 

Yes: you can request a Writ of Execution to collect your judgment. 

No: you can file a Request for Order for Disclosure (JGM302) so that you can find 
out this information. 

These requests must be filed in the county where your judgment was awarded. So if 
you docketed your judgment in a different Minnesota county, you will need to 
request the Order for Disclosure or Writ of Execution in the first county. 

To collect from: 

Wages: you must give the judgment debtor notice before the sheriff’s office can 
serve the Writ of Execution. 

Bank account: you must give the sheriff’s office additional paperwork with the 
Writ of Execution.
