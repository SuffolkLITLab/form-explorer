      <pre>IMPORTANT! 

New laws went into effect on August 1, 2020, for guardianship and 
conservatorship cases.  The new laws change some of the words and processes. 
 For example, the word “ward” has been changed to “person subject to 
guardianship.”  And “protected person” has been changed to “person subject to 
conservatorship.” 

The Minnesota Judicial Branch is in the process of updating this Guardianship 
and Conservatorship Manual.  We are making this document available to you 
in its current form while we are working to update it because it has very helpful 
information, even if some of the words and procedures do not match the new 
laws.  Please see the legislation for more information regarding new duties and 
responsibilities for guardians and conservators at Minn. Laws 2020, ch. 86, art. 
1.  Please Note:  By order of the Minnesota Supreme Court issued on 
April 7, 2021, this legislation is NOT applicable to court records to the 
extent inconsistent with the Rules of Public Access to Records of the 
Judicial Branch.  All documents submitted for filing become “court 
records” and are presumed to be public documents unless there is 
authority under court rule, a court order, or a statute that is not 
inconsistent with court rules that authorize a filing to be non-public.  The 
legislation regarding the use of a Bill of Particulars to keep medical / 
health information or financial information confidential does NOT apply 
to court records as it conflicts with court rules.  Filers must follow Minn. 
Gen. R. Prac. 11 when filing non-public documents. 

When we are finished updating the manual, you will see “2021” after “2016” 
on the next page.

INTRODUCTION 

A. 

PURPOSE:    In  April  1996  the  Minnesota  Conference  of  Chief  Judges  completed  the  Report  of  the 
Minnesota  Conference  of  Chief  Judges  Committee  on  the  Treatment  of  Litigants  and  Pro  Se 
Litigants.    The  Pro  Se  Litigant  Implementation  Committee  made  various  recommendations  within  this 
report addressing the growing number of Pro Se litigants and the need for accurate and consumer friendly 
information  regarding  court  procedures.    A  Pro  Se  litigant  is  a  person  who  appears  on  his  or  her  own 
behalf  in  court  and  does  not  retain  a  lawyer.    From  this  committee  a  Probate  and  Mental  Health 
Subcommittee  was  established  which  assigned  a  work  group  to  specifically  address  the  area  of 
Conservatorship and Guardianship proceedings. 

This manual is the result of that work group’s efforts.  The work group adapted and edited existing and 
new materials to develop this book.  The Probate and Mental Health Subcommittee’s Conservatorship 
and Guardianship Work Group, and the Minnesota Conference of Chief Judges would like to thank the 
many  individuals  who  contributed  to  this  effort  for  their  time  and  expertise  and  to  recognize  the 
organizations  they  represented:  Arc  Minnesota,  Ebenezer  Protective  Services  of  Fairview  Senior  & 
Social Services, the Minnesota Association for Guardianship and Conservatorship (MAGIC), and the 
Public Guardianship Office of the State of Minnesota Department of Human Services. 

B.  USE  OF  THIS  MANUAL:    The  information  here  is  a  discussion  of  the  Guardianship  and 
Conservatorship  process  and  what  the  expectations  are  of  the  court  and  the  Guardian  or  Conservator.  
Nothing  in  this  book  should  be  construed  as  legal  advice.    Due  to  the  complexities  of  many  of  the 
proceedings to establish or maintain a Guardianship of the person or Conservatorship of the estate, it is 
recommended  that  a  person  seek  out  the  legal  advice  of  a  competent  attorney  with  experience  in 
Guardianship or Conservatorship law. 

This  manual  is  a  discussion  of  Guardianship  and  Conservatorship  of  adults  only.    It  does  not  contain 
information regarding Guardianship or Conservatorship of minors. 

The information includes brief, easy to read sections which may be used individually or in its entirety.  
These  sections  are  designed  to  be  self-instructional.    The  Conservatorship  and  Guardianship  in 
Minnesota manual is not copyrighted.  You are encouraged to make additional copies of any or all parts 
of this manual for your use. 

The forms referred to in this manual may be found on the state court website. Although most district 
courts  will  accept  these  forms,  some  may  have  specific  forms  which they accept. It is recommended 
that the Court Administrator’s Office of the Probate Division of the District Court in which the petition 
will be filed be contacted to determine which forms to use and what the correct filing fee will be.

 CHAPTER II 
 

I.  GENERAL OVERVIEW 

A.  CONSERVATORSHIP  AND  GUARDIANSHIP:    A  conservatorship  or  guardianship  is 
established  through  a  legal  action,  or  proceeding.    The  person  who  files  a  petition  with  the  court 
requesting that a conservatorship or guardianship be established is the petitioner.  In this proceeding, 
the court orders the appointment of a person (a conservator or guardian) to act as a decision maker for 
another person (the protected person or ward).  The court bases this decision on clear and convincing 
evidence that the protected person or ward has been found to be unable to make necessary decisions on 
his  or  her  own  behalf.      The  court  calls  this  making  a  finding  of  incapacity.  Guardianship  or 
conservatorship should only be sought if the individual's judgment or decision making is a major threat 
to the individual's welfare. 

1.  What  does  incapacity  mean?    Incapacity  is  proven  when  the  petitioner,  the  person  who  is 
asking  the  court  to  appoint  a  conservator/guardian,  can  provide  evidence  to  the  court  that  the 
proposed  ward/protected  person  is  unable  to  make  responsible  personal  decisions,  and  is  also 
unable to meet his or her needs.  

In the case of guardianship of the person, an incapacitated person is: 

"an individual who, for reasons other than being a minor, is impaired to the extent of lacking 
sufficient understanding or capacity to make or communicate responsible personal decisions, 
and who has demonstrated deficits in behavior which evidence an inability to meet personal 
needs  for  medical  care,  nutrition,  clothing,  shelter,  or  safety,  even  with  appropriate 
technological assistance."  (Minnesota Statutes section 524.5-102, subdivision 6).   

In the case of conservatorship of the estate, an incapacitated person is:  

"an individual who, for reasons other than being a minor, is impaired to the extent of lacking 
sufficient understanding or capacity to make or communicate responsible personal decisions, 
and who has demonstrated deficits in behavior which evidence an inability to meet personal 
needs for medical care, nutrition, clothing, shelter, or safety, even with appropriate 
technological assistance” (Minnesota Statutes section 524.5-102, subdivision 6) and the 
incapacity is proven:  
“(1) by clear and convincing evidence, the individual is unable to manage property and 
business affairs because of an impairment in the ability to receive and evaluate information or 
make decisions, even with the use of appropriate technological assistance, or because the 
individual is missing, detained, or unable to return to the United States;  
(2)   by a preponderance of evidence, the individual has property that will be wasted or 
dissipated unless management is provided or money is needed for the support, care, 
education, health, and welfare of the individual or of individuals who are entitled to the 
individual's support and that protection is necessary or desirable to obtain or provide money; 
and  
(3)  
of appropriate technological  assistance.” (Minnesota Statutes section 524.5-409(a)). 

the respondent's identified needs cannot be met by less restrictive means, including use 

2.  What is the difference between Conservatorship and Guardianship?  A guardian is appointed 
to make the personal decisions for the ward.  The guardian has decision making authority for 
matters such as choice of place to live, medical decisions, training and education, etc.  A 
conservator is appointed to make financial decisions for the protected person.  The 
conservator typically has the power to contract, to pay bills, invest assets, and perform other 
financial functions for the protected person.

3.  Guardianship:    At  a  guardianship  hearing  the  Court  makes  a  finding  based  on  clear  and 
convincing evidence that the ward is incapacitated.  The person appointed is called the guardian 
and the person under guardianship is called the ward. 

 

Essentially, the guardian makes decisions regarding the ward’s basic personal needs to the extent 
the court grants the guardian such power.  Such decisions may include: 

The guardian becomes responsible for making decisions in many areas of the ward's personal life.  
The guardian cannot decide on certain medical treatments; there are some medical treatments which 
require court review and approval.  There are other medical treatments which may be considered 
controversial  and/or  highly  intrusive  or  risky.    Court  review  and  approval  of  these  consents  may 
also be recommended. 

udges can treat a petition for guardianship as a petition for conservatorship if the judge believes it 
is a less restrictive alternative.  A judge may also treat a petition for guardianship or conservatorship 
as a petition for a protective order, or may decide that all of these are too restrictive of the person’s 
rights. 
 

4.  Conservatorship:    At  a  conservatorship  hearing  the  court  makes  a  finding  of  incapacity  in 
specific areas where there has been clear and convincing evidence to support the finding and a 
preponderance  of  evidence  that  the  person’s  property  will  be  dissipated  or  wasted  without  a 
conservator.    The  person  appointed  is  called  the  conservator,  and  the  person  under  the 
conservatorship is called the protected person. 

Conservatorship is tailored to transfer financial decision-making power to the conservator only in 
the areas of life where protection and supervision by a conservator has been proven necessary. 

 

A conservatorship does not assume, or presume, that the proposed protected person is incapacitated 
in all areas of his or her life.  There is no evidence of, or finding of, general incompetence.  The 
individual can still marry, make a will or vote (unless specified by the court that the individual is 
incapable of doing so). 
 

5.  How much power and authority does a Guardian or Conservator have?  The law requires that 
in both guardianship and conservatorship the court can grant the guardian or the conservator limited 
power to exercise authority over the ward or protected person.  The guardian or conservator must 
use this authority only as is necessary to provide needed care and services.  It cannot be used in a 
manner  which  limits  the  ward  or  protected  person’s  civil  rights  and  restricts  his  or  her  personal 
freedoms.  This is to make sure that the decision of a guardian or  conservator will not be overly 
protective or restrictive of the person's rights.

to consent to or refuse medical treatment.

  J

.  What  types  of  Guardianships  or  Conservatorships  are  there?    An  adult  who  may  need  a 
guardian for personal decisions, such as where to live, would have a guardian of the person.  An 
adult who may need a conservator for financial matters only would have a conservator of the estate. 
 A guardian of the person and a conservator the estate may also be necessary. 

a.  Guardianship of the Person:  “A guardian of the person” is appointed for personal matters.  

 

A guardian of the person makes decisions regarding: 

general care and needs, and where to live,

care,  comfort  and  maintenance  (food,  clothing,  shelter,  health  care,  social  and 
recreational, training, education, habilitation or rehabilitation), 

taking reasonable care of personal effects,  

giving necessary consent for medical or other professional care, counsel, treatment, or 
service, 

approving or withholding approval of contracts, except for necessities, (this power is 
only given if there is no conservator of the estate) and  

exercising supervisory authority which limits civil rights and restricts personal freedom 
only to the extent necessary to provide needed care and services.  

 

b.  Conservatorship  of  the  estate:    A  conservator  of  the  estate  is  appointed  for  financial 

matters. 

A conservator of the estate must: 

•  pay  reasonable  charges  for  the  support,  maintenance,  and  education  of  the  protected 
person from the protected person’s estate, and in a manner suitable to the person's station 
in  life  and  the  value  of  the  estate  (the  conservator  must  seek  federal,  state  or  local 
services that the protected person is entitled.), 

  pay any just and lawful debts of the ward or protected person from the protected person’s 
estate, possess and manage the estate, collect all debts and claims in favor of the person 
and invest all funds not currently needed as directed by statute,  

approving or withholding approval of contracts, except for necessities, and 

  by approval of the court, sell, exchange, or purchase undivided interest in real estate. 

.  Guardianship of the Person or Conservatorship of the Estate, or both:  A guardian of the 

person and conservator of the estate would have all of the above powers and duties.   

•

  •

 

  •

 

  •

  •

 

  •

  •

A guardian of the person, conservator of the estate, or both, has no duty or obligation to pay 
for  any  service  for  the  ward  or  protected  person  from  his  or  her  own  funds.    Instead,  the 
conservator uses funds from the protected person’s estate or seeks out federal, state, or county 
services to which the protected person is entitled. [Minnesota Statutes § 524.5-417]. 

Emergency Guardianship of the person, Emergency Conservatorship of the estate, or 
both:  Any  person  may  petition  the  court  to  have  an  emergency  guardian  or  conservator 
appointed.    A  petitioner  should  request  a  emergency  guardianship  or  conservatorship  only 
when it can clearly be shown that the person or the person’s estate is in imminent harm or 
danger  and  the  guardianship  or  conservatorship  is  immediately  necessary  for  protection.  
Under these circumstances the petition for an emergency guardianship or conservatorship can 
be  filed  whether  or  not  a  petition  for  general  guardianship  or  conservatorship  has  already 
been filed. The court will grant to an emergency guardian or conservator only those powers 
which are necessary to provide for the demonstrated needs of the ward or protected person.   
 
The  court  will  specify  the  duration,  or  length  of  time,  of  the  emergency  guardianship  or 
conservatorship.  Generally this cannot exceed 60 days, see Minnesota Statutes § 524.5-311, 
§ 524.5-409.  At the time the emergency guardianship or conservatorship ends, or upon the 
granting of letters of a general guardianship or conservatorship, the power of an emergency 
guardian or conservator will also end.

Public vs. private Guardianship or Conservatorship:    A concerned and involved family 
member, close friend, interested party, corporation, professional guardian or conservator, or 
public  agency  may  be  appointed  guardian  or  conservator  for  an  incapacitated  person.  
Generally,  there  is  an  order  of  priority  for  those  who  may  be  considered  by  the  court  for 
appointment.    This  will  depend  in  part  on  the  wishes,  if  any,  of  the  proposed  ward  or 
protected  person,  and  the  availability  of  persons  who  will  be  willing  and  able  to  act  as 
guardian or conservator.   

  A  public  guardianship  or  conservatorship 

Public. 
is  any  guardianship  or 
conservatorship where the court appoints a state or county government agency to act as 
guardian or conservator. 

In  a  public  guardianship  or  conservatorship  a  staff  person  within  the  state  or  local 
county agency is designated to act as the guardian or conservator.  This designation is 
often  referred  to  as  a  "delegation  of  power."      This  means  that  the  powers  of  the 
guardianship or conservatorship are delegated, or passed down, to another person. 

Public guardianship/conservatorship is governed by Minnesota Statutes chapter 252A. 

Private. 
  A  private  guardianship  or  conservatorship  is  any  guardianship  or 
conservatorship  where  the  court  has  appointed  a  private  citizen,  such  as  a  family 
member, close friend, professional guardian or conservator, or a private agency to act 
as guardian or conservator.  If a private agency is appointed, the agency will delegate 
the duties of the guardianship or conservatorship to an agency staff person.

III.  LESS RESTRICTIVE ALTERNATIVES 
 

A.  ALTERNATIVES  TO  GUARDIANSHIP  OR  CONSERVATORSHIP:    Independence, 
respect,  and  equality  are  values  important  to  all  people.    These  values  help  define  the  concepts  of 
autonomy  (independence  and  freedom)  and  self-determination  (the  right  to  make  decisions  for  ones 
self).  Because these rights are so valued in our society the least restrictive alternative must always be 
sought before taking away, or amending, a person's civil and legal rights to make decisions. 

1.  Why  not  Guardianship  or  Conservatorship?    The  right  to  autonomy  and  self-determination 
should allow us to make our own decisions. It should also allow us to make decisions that others 
may  think  are  "wrong."    Guardianship  or  conservatorship  should  not  be  required  or  used  simply 
because a person makes a decision that other people do not understand or agree with, or because the 
person has a certain disability or diagnosis.  The court and the guardian or conservator must try to 
strike a balance between helping adults to decide for themselves, and restricting some of the areas 
where they are in need of decision making assistance. 

2.  What does Least Restrictive Alternative mean?  A least restrictive alternative is an option which 
allows  a  person  to  keep  as  much  autonomy  and  self-determination  as  possible  while  still 
protecting  the  person.    If  a  less  restrictive  alternative  can  provide  proper  protection  for  the 
person, it must be used to avoid guardianship or conservatorship.  Some examples include, but 
aren't  limited  to:  protective  orders,  representative  payee  for  certain  government  benefits, 
establishment of a trust, joint bank accounts, or advance directives for health care. 

.  Can  Less  Restrictive  Alternatives  be  planned  ahead?    There  are  a  variety  of  formal  and 
informal methods, or tools, available to assure that a person's own wishes and decisions about the 
future are followed.  No adult is too young or healthy to plan for incapacity.  Even when a plan has 
not  been  established  for  meeting the future needs of a person whose capacity is in question, less 
restrictive alternatives to guardianship or conservatorship can and need to be considered by those 
who care for, or about, the individual.  Some people may have difficulty talking about these matters. 
 People  who  may  be  facing  incapacity  are often relieved to learn that there are ways for them to 
retain some control over their lives, or at least ensure their wishes will be followed. 

.  What alternative planning tools are available?  The alternative tools include voluntary, where 
the incapacitated person agrees to the arrangement; or involuntary, where another person makes the 
arrangements  on  behalf  of  the  person  with  the  incapacity.    Both  the  voluntary  and  involuntary 
planning tools discussed on the following pages are less restrictive alternatives to guardianship or 
conservatorship.  Once they are in place, a guardianship or conservatorship may not be needed at 
all.  The best choice of alternatives depends on individual needs and preferences. 

.  How are the tools used or written?  It is wise to thoroughly understand a tool before trying to use 
it.  The  descriptions  below  provide  a  general  summary  of  the  tools.    If  additional  information  is 
needed there are resources listed in the back of this handbook, or consulting with an attorney may 
be appropriate.

1.  Health  Care  Declaration  (Living  Will):    The  Adult  Health  Care  Declarations  Act  went  into 
effect August 1, 1989. It has gone through changes over the years and is now in Minnesota Statutes 
section 145C.  Only a competent adult may write a health care declaration, or Living Will.  This 
document gives the declarant’s (the person making the living will) the power to do the following: 

•  To provide health care professionals instructions regarding your desires and wishes 

for health care, e.g., “pull the plug”, “do not pull the plug” etc. 
•  To name an agent to make your health care decisions for you. 
•  To  both  name  an  agent  AND  provide  instructions  for  the  agent  and  health  care 

providers regarding your desires and wishes for health care.  

•  To declare whether you want to be an organ donor and under what circumstances. 
•  To  provide  your  burial/funeral  instructions,  or  name  the  person  responsible  for  making 

such decisions. 

.  Advance psychiatric directive:  An Advance Psychiatric Directive can be written by a competent 
adult  with  mental  health  issues  whose  illness  may  intensify  and  worsen,  leaving  the  individual 
unable to reasonably participate in decision making.  The individual (the declarant) names another 
person (the proxy) to make decisions on behalf of the declarant regarding intrusive mental health 
treatment when the declarant is incapacitated by the mental illness. 

The  directive  addresses  the  giving  and  using  of  Neuroleptic  medications  or  Electro-convulsive 
therapy  (ECT)  when  the  declarant  is  incapacitated  and  admitted  (voluntarily  or  through  the 
commitment process) to a treatment facility. The directive provides for full or limited consent, or 
refusal  to  consent,  to  treatment  by  the  proxy.    The  declaration  may  be  revoked  completely  or 
partially  at  any  time  if  the  person  is  competent  at  the  time  of  the  revocations.    See  Minnesota 
Statutes 253B.03, subd. 6b and subd. 6d. 

.  Individual's plan:  In the case of the individual who is losing the ability to safely care for him or 
herself  in  the  current  living  environment,  and  who  did  not  complete  one  of  the  planning  tools 
described  above  while  competent,  that  person's  own  plan  could  meet  the  needs  and  avoid 
guardianship or conservatorship.  The individual may come up with the plan, or may be directed 
towards acceptance of a plan formulated with the help of formal or informal supports.  This could 
include hiring home health care and other supportive services, moving to an assisted living or other 
supervised environment, or moving to a long term care facility. 

 
4.  Family's plan:  Guardianship or Conservatorship of an adult whose capacity is in question may be 
avoided  in  situations  where  family  members  or  other  informal  support  networks  are  available, 
willing, and appropriate to make a plan of care and to follow through with meeting the needs of the 
individual.  However,  the  best  of  plans  are  useless  if  the  individual  is  unwilling  to  accept  the 
assistance of family members and the services they arrange. 

 

5.  Case  manager’s  plan:    A  social  services  case  manager,  hired  by  the  individual,  family,  or  the 
fiduciary  can  plan,  implement,  and  coordinate  a  home  care  plan.  This  is  appropriate  when  the 
individual is able to cooperate and willing to accept the recommended services, but not necessarily 
able to carry out and oversee the plan him or herself. 

.  Health  care  facility  plan:    As  part  of  the  care  team,  and  in  addition  to  the  involvement  of  any 
friends or family members, the health care facility social workers, nurses, activities directors, and 
others can help meet the ongoing personal care needs of the nursing home resident whose capacity 
is questioned. With the establishment of a nursing home trust fund, the social worker or other staff 
may be able to meet the individual's need for clothing and other personal items.

Banking options:  There are some simple banking options which in some cases could be used 
as alternatives to guardianship or conservatorship. A person can often retain control of his or 
her  own  affairs  with  the  help  of  modern  banking  technology  such  as:    automatic  recurring 
payments to creditors (utilities, mortgages, and others can be routinely paid in this hassle-free 
manner),  banking  by  mail,  phone  or  online,  and  specially  designed  devices  for  the  visually 
impaired  and  physically  disabled.    Direct  deposit  can  be  arranged  for  Social  Security  and 
certain other pension and benefit checks.   

All  of  these  may  be  useful  and  appropriate  for  the  person  who  agrees  to  enter  into  such 
arrangements.    The  person  should  have  the  ability  to  understand  what  is  being  done  each 
month. As this would not work for persons who would fear that their Social Security checks 
which  no  longer  arrive  in  the  mail  have  been  stolen,  or  who  may  become  confused  and  pay 
utility bills a second time. 

Another method often used is joint bank accounts where a trusted friend or family member’s 
name is added to the account. Great caution should be taken, however, as the other person could 
legally withdraw all the money. There could also be tax problems for either party, as well as 
complications in eligibility for Medical Assistance. There is also right of survivorship, which 
may not have been intended. 

Power of Attorney (POA):  This Power of Attorney refers only to powers over finances.  A 
power  of  attorney  is  a  document,  signed  voluntarily  by  a  competent  adult  (the  principal) 
authorizing another person (the attorney-in-fact) to act on behalf of the principal. An attorney 
should be involved in the development and execution of such a document. 

A power of attorney can be a general document used for all authorized transactions and affairs 
related  to  property  owned  by  the  principal.  It can also be as limited as a card signed at one 
bank,  which  only  covers  transactions  at  that  bank.  In  addition  to  being  detailed  about  what 
authority is and is not given, the document should also specify how long it lasts. 

A power of attorney is revocable by a competent principal at any time; the revocation must be 
in writing, and any third party who might be relying on the Power of Attorney should be given 
notice of the revocation.  Once a person is incapacitated, the Durable Power of Attorney cannot 
be  terminated  (unless  it  includes  a  time  limit),  except  if  terminated  by  a  guardian  or 
conservator.   

Authority  to  exercise  the  Power  of  Attorney  can  be  continued  after  the  principal  becomes 
incapacitated if special language is included in the document. This is called a Durable Power of 
Attorney.  Be careful not to confuse this with the Health Care Directive (which is sometimes 
referred to as a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care). 

The  drawback  of  a  power  of  attorney  is  that  a  court  does  not  supervise  it  and  there  are  no 
requirements  of  surety,  bonds,  or  an  annual  accounting,  and  therefore  could  pose  significant 
risk to the principal.  The principal could be extremely vulnerable to the theft of funds by the 
attorney-in-fact; therefore, this should only be used when the attorney-in-fact is trustworthy of 
such a responsibility.  

However, if carefully drafted by an attorney who has a good understanding of the principal’s 
needs  and  wishes,  a  power  of  attorney  can  be  set  up  to  include  many  safeguards.  There  are 
statutory  provisions  which  allow  the  principal  to  ask  for  an  accounting  at  any  time,  and  at

C.  VOLUNTARY ALTERNATIVES FOR FINANCIAL NEEDS:  Because of the complexities 
of  various financial arrangements it is strongly recommended that an attorney who practices in the 
area of guardianship and conservatorship be involved in the development of any financial plan.

execution of the document, it could be required that regular accountings be rendered to some 
designated individual. 

Trusts:  Trusts are another way of planning ahead for property-related matters. A trust is a legal 
plan for placing funds and other assets in the control of a trustee for the benefit of an individual 
(the grantor).  Trusts are most useful in situations involving large assets, as the administration 
fees of trusts are often costly. Trusts can be set up to be revocable or irrevocable.  An attorney 
knowledgeable in the trust area should be consulted to explain all options.  

Trusts can designate one or more persons, an organization, or a bank, to act as trustee.  It can be 
set  up  to  serve  a  wide  variety  of  purposes,  such  as  paying  bills,  managing  investments,  and 
managing real estate.  A trustee provides a financial plan to protect the assets of an individual. 

Living  Trust.    A  living  trust  is  established  by  the  person  who  owns  the  assets  (the 
grantor), directing the trustee to manage the grantor's property for the grantor's benefit. 

Standby Trust.   For planning ahead, it is possible to create a standby trust.  In a standby 
trust  the  grantor  creates  an  unfunded  trust  and  enforces  a  Durable  Power  of  Attorney.  
This  durable  power  of  attorney  will  direct  that  in  the  event  of  medically  certified 
incapacity the grantor's assets are to be transferred to the trust and managed according to 
the terms of the trust agreement. 

Supplemental Needs Trust.  The purpose of a supplemental needs trust is to provide for 
the reasonable living expenses and other basic needs of a person with a disability, when 
benefits from publicly funded benefit programs are not sufficient to adequately provide 
for  those  needs.    It  does  not  include  trusts  funded  by the client, the client’s spouse, or 
anyone obligated to pay damages for the individual.  Also, the trust cannot be created for 
the benefit of the individual under a settlement agreement or judgment.

Social  Security  representative  payee:    This  alternative  can  be  voluntary  on  the  part  of  a 
Social Security beneficiary, and it can also be used without the beneficiary's consent in some 
cases.  This is discussed in the following section on non-voluntary, less restrictive alternatives. 

Social  Security  representative  payee:  Unlike  the  voluntary  alternatives  to  guardianship  or 
conservatorship,  a  representative  payeeship  for  Social  Security  benefits,  which  includes 
Supplemental  Security  Income  (SSI)  benefits,  can  be  set  up  after  the  person  becomes 
incapacitated  through  the  Social  Security  Administration  (SSA).    Representative  payeeship 
might be an appropriate alternative to guardianship or conservatorship if Social Security is the 
only income and there is no need to protect other assets.  Visit your local Social Security office 
 in person to for more information about current policies on representative payees and to apply 
to become the official representative payee. 

Arrangements for veterans and railroad retirement benefits:  For persons receiving either 
Railroad Retirement Benefits or Veterans Benefits, substitute payment arrangements much like 
Social Security Representative Payeeships may be established if the beneficiary is found to be 
incapacitated through the process established by each respective administration. 

The Veterans Administration or the Railroad Retirement Board should be contacted for details 
and  procedures  to  follow. 
  As  with  Social  Security  Representative  Payeeship,  the 
appropriateness  of  such  arrangements  should  be  carefully  considered  given  individual 
circumstances.

to  manage  the  grant  for  his  or  her  own  benefit.  Such  arrangements  are  made  by  the  county

E.  CONSERVATORSHIP  PLANNING: Minnesota Statutes section 524.5-303(a) and section 403 
provides  a  way  for  a  person  to  plan  ahead  for  a  time  when  he  or  she  may  need  a  guardian  or 
conservator. In a written document, witnessed in the same way as a health care directive, a person may 
name the guardian/conservator he or she wants, and may give specific instructions for the person. 

For  example,  the conservator could be instructed on how to manage the person's property, where the 
person would like to live, and the person's wishes regarding health care.  If the person later becomes 
incapacitated or for some other reason needs a guardian/conservator, the court must name the chosen 
person, and must order that the person's instructions be followed, unless the court finds that this would 
not  be 
the 
guardianship/conservatorship plan would have to be presented before the court would refuse to allow it.

in 

hile  it  is  safer  to  plan  ahead,  this  provision  can  even  be  used  at  the  time  of  filing  a  petition  for 
guardianship/conservatorship, as long as the proposed ward/protected person has sufficient capacity to 
form an intelligent preference. 

Example  1:  Ms.  Smith  is  in  frail  health  and  has  become  very  forgetful.    She  knows  that  she  needs 
someone to assist her with bill paying and asset management. She has a close friend, Mary, whom she 
trusts and who agrees to take the responsibility of becoming conservator of the estate of Ms. Smith. Ms. 
Smith can file a voluntary petition naming Mary as her conservator, and giving specific instructions and 
limits  on  Mary's  powers.  The  court  will  hold  a  hearing  and  will  appoint  Mary  and  give  instructions 
unless the court finds that this would not be in the best interest of Ms. Smith. 

xample 2: Ms. Smith's son Tom files a petition to be named guardian of Ms. Smith, but she prefers that 
her  friend  Mary  be  appointed.    Ms.  Smith  can  file  a  petition  with  the  court  asking  that  Mary  be 
appointed  instead  of  Tom.  If  the  court  finds  Ms.  Smith  has  the  capacity  to  form  an  intelligent 
preference, it must appoint Mary instead of Tom, even though Tom is a blood relative, unless the court 
finds that appointing Mary would not be in Ms. Smith's best interest. 

xample 3: Ms. Smith is healthy but wants to plan ahead in case she should need a guardian/conservator 
at some time in the future. She can execute her conservatorship plan, perhaps in conjunction with her 
Durable  Power  of  Attorney  for  Health  Care  or  Trust,  and  if  guardian/conservator  ever  becomes 
necessary,  the  person  she  chose  can  bring  the  document  to  the  probate  court  and  petition  for 
guardian/conservator. 

 guardian/conservator plan, also referred to as a self-petition for guardian/conservator, is obviously the 
least  restrictive  way  of  obtaining  a  guardian/conservator.  It  should  be  offered  to  anyone  who  is  a 
proposed  ward/protected  person  and  has  sufficient  capacity  to  form  an  intelligent  preference.  If  the 
proposed ward/protected person's capacity is questionable, it is a good idea to have another person, such 
as the proposed guardian/conservator or a family member, sign the petition as a co-petitioner. 
 

F.  OTHER  PROTECTIVE  ORDERS:    Minnesota  Statutes  section  524.5-412,  provides  that  the 
court, instead of appointing a guardian or conservator, may after a hearing, authorize, direct, or approve:  

any  transaction  necessary  or  desirable  to  achieve  any  security,  service,  or  care  arrangement 
meeting the foreseeable needs of the protected person, or  

any  contract,  trust,  or  other  transaction  relating  to  the  protected  person’s  financial  affairs  or 
involving his or her estate, if the court determines that the transaction is in the best interests of 
the protected person.

The court will consider the interests of creditors and dependents of the protected person, and in view of 
the disability, whether the person needs the continuing protection of a guardian or conservator.   

he court may appoint an agent, with or without bond, to assist in the accomplishment of any protective 
arrangement or other authorized transaction.  The agent will have only the authority granted by the court 
and will be discharged after reporting to the court all matters relating to the order of appointment. 

 

 

G.  ARC NATIONAL POSITION ON GUARDIANSHIP/CONSERVATORSHIP:  While this 
position  paper  was  specifically  written  in  regard  to  the  use  of  guardianship  or  conservatorship  for 
persons with developmental disability its principles should be considered before pursuing guardianship 
or conservatorship for any person, regardless of diagnosis. 

The  majority  of  persons  with  developmental  disability  can  manage  their  own  affairs  with  informal 
assistance  and  guidance  from  family,  friends,  citizens,  and  service  agency  support  personnel.  The 
appointment  of  a  guardian  or  conservator  is  a  serious  matter  involving  the  limitation  of  a  person's 
independence and rights. When guardianship or conservatorship is appropriate, it should be sparingly 
used and adequately monitored by the legal system and advocates to insure that the best interests of the 
individual are protected. 

ppointment  of  a  guardian  or  conservator  should  be  made  only  to  the  extent  necessary  for  the 
protection and welfare of the individual and not for the convenience of the family, the service system, or 
society. 

ess restrictive alternatives to full guardianship or conservatorship should always be considered first.  

ince  guardianship  and  conservatorship  represents  a  transfer  of  the  responsibility  for  exercising  an 
individual's  rights,  adequate  safeguards  are  needed  to  assure  the  individual  retains  as  much 
decision-making power as possible. 

he restrictions on the individual's rights and decision-making powers should be confined to those areas 
in which the individual clearly cannot understand the serious consequence of his or her decisions or lack 
of foresight, such as through the use of limited conservatorship, power of attorney, etc. 

he guardian or conservator, preferably a family member, should be someone who is committed to the 
well-being  of  the  individual,  knows  and  understands  the  individual's  needs  and  wishes  and  acts  in 
accordance with them whenever possible. 

he guardian or conservator should become knowledgeable of services, supports and systems that could 

impact significantly on the life of the individual. 

he  guardian  or  conservator  shall  be  accountable  for  his  or  her  actions  and  those  actions  reviewed 

periodically.

A.  DETERMINING IF GUARDIANSHIP OR CONSERVATORSHIP IS NECESSARY:  The 
need for a legal guardian or conservator may arise for many reasons.  This often includes the interest of a 
third party, such as a lawyer or a physician, who requires "informed" consent when there is a belief that 
the  adult  is  "incapable"  of  giving  it.    It  is  important  to  understand  that  there  are  many  care-giving 
relationships which exist without legal recognition. 

Family  members  often  take  on  informal  decision  making  roles  for  each other before a person becomes 
incapacitated. A common example would be an adult son who assists his elderly father with personal care 
or  financial  matters  as  part  of  their  ongoing relationship.  If, however, the father's mental "capacity" is 
called  into  question,  e.g.  due  to  Alzheimer's,  or  other  diseases  affecting  the  fathers  decision  making 
ability, a court order appointing the son as guardian or conservator may be needed to legally allow him to 
make  decisions  on  behalf  of  his  father.    Other  times  the  need  for  a  guardian  or conservator may come 
about very quickly as a result, for example, of a severe head injury from an accident. 

1.  What type of people need Guardians or Conservators?  Those who may be thought to be in need 

of a guardian or conservator include many different types of people such as: 

• 
• 
• 

• 

a person with a developmental disability; 
a person who is mentally ill; 
a person who has experienced a stroke or a head injury which may have resulted in a mental or 
physical disability; 
a  person  who  has  a  disease  such  as  Alzheimer's;  or  who  may  be  having  diminished 
decision-making capacity. 

It is important to recognize that although a person may fit into one of these categories, this does not 
mean that he or she is necessarily incapacitated and in need of a guardian or conservator.  A person’s 
need for decision making support or for a decision maker will vary and depend on his or her ability to 
make reasonable decisions.  The availability of formal and informal support from family or friends or 
other  resources,  and  adequate  planning  to  assure  that  his  or  her  needs  are  met.  Guardianship  or 
conservatorship  and  the  need  for  support  in  decision-making  have  to  be  assessed  for  each  person 
individually. 

.  What  is  the  criterion  for  establishing  a  Guardianship  or  Conservatorship?    The  criteria  for 

establishing a guardianship or conservatorship is based on the court making a finding that: 

a. 
b. 
c. 

d. 

the person is incapacitated,  
that the person needs the supervision and protection of a guardian or conservator, 
that there is no appropriate alternative which exists which is less restrictive of the person's civil 
rights and liberties, and,  
that the person chosen to act as guardian or conservator is in the best interests of the proposed 
ward or protected person. 

.  How  is  incapacity  determined? 

  Determining  incapacity  requires  assessing  three  factors:  

Impairment, Functional Capacity, and Decisional Capacity. 

a. 

Impairment. Impairment generally refers to a person’s diagnosed disability or medical condition 
which may affect the person’s decision-making skills.  There is no statutory, or legal, definition of 
impairment, but it generally relates to a person’s functional incapacity. 

b.  Functional Capacity. Functional capacity means a person’s ability to take action to meet personal 
needs,  or  demonstrated  behavior  which  indicates  he  or  she  can  take  appropriate  or  necessary

action  to  have  needs  met.    It  must  be  determined  whether  and  how  well  the  individual  can 
perform  activities  to  meet  personal  needs  and  how  much  assistance  is  needed  with  decision 
making. 

.  Decisional  Capacity.  Decisional  capacity  means  a  person’s  ability  to  understand,  make,  and 
communicate  responsible  personal  decisions  to  make  sure  his  or  her  needs  are  met.    This  is 
similar to informed consent evaluations: 

Is the person aware of an unmet need or inability in managing personal needs? 
Is the person aware of alternatives available to meet these needs? 
Is the person able to express a choice? 

• 
• 
• 
•  Does the person understand and appreciate the choice made, and the risks and the benefits? 

4.  What assessments should be completed and who should complete them?  In order to determine 
if a person is incapacitated, that person’s skills and abilities to make and carry out decisions to meet 
his  or  her  needs  must  be  assessed  in  some  way.    Assessments  should  be  multi-disciplinary, 
personalized,  and  comprehensive.    Every  attempt  must  be  made  to  ensure  that  assessments  are 
sensitive to the language, religion, gender, and cultural differences of the person being assessed, and 
they should involve, as much as possible, family and close friends of the adult.  

The  assessments  should  not  focus  solely  on  a  person's  cognitive  abilities  (such  as  I.Q.)  but  on  the 
decisions  to  be  made  and  the  person’s  ability  to  understand  what  is  required.    A  diagnosis  of 
developmental  disability  or  mental  illness  may  not  indicate  the  need  for  a  guardianship  or 
conservatorship, nor does dependency.  Instead, look for how that person copes with living.  It must 
also  be  recognized  that  at  present,  the  procedures  and  standards  for  determining  "competency"  are 
uncertain and controversial. 

a.  Medical.  A medical assessment must be completed by a physician or medical specialist.  This 
should  include  the  person’s  diagnoses,  a  list  of  any  medications  which  may  affect  decision 
making skills and abilities, and the results of testing to determine if there are treatable causes of 
the person’s impairment. 

.  Behavioral.  A behavioral assessment should be completed by a psychologist, care provider, or 
behavior  specialist.    This  should  include  an  assessment  of  any  behaviors  and  necessary 
interventions which may affect the person’s decision-making skills and abilities. 

.  Activities  of  Daily  Living.    An  assessment  of  activities  of  daily  living,  such  as  getting  dressed, 
cooking, personal hygiene care, household cleaning, budgeting money, paying bills, etc., should 
be  completed  by  a  care  provider,  social  services  provider,  occupational  therapist,  or  physical 
therapist.  This should include an assessment of functional capacity to act on decisions to assure 
personal and financial needs are met. 

.  Social  History.    A  social  history  should  be  completed  by  the  person,  his  or  her  family,  and  a 
social services provider.  This should include: a background of the person, what led to incapacity, 
what  does  the  proposed  ward  or  protected  person  and  the  family,  if  appropriate,  think  of 
guardianship or conservatorship, and the person’s past and present decision-making skills. 

Intelligence.      An  intelligence  test  may  be  completed  by  a  psychologist  or  psychiatrist.    This 
should include an assessment of decisional capacity to understand decisions that need to be made 
to meet personal and financial needs.

 CHAPTER V 

     

V.  WHO MAY ACT AS GUARDIAN OR CONSERVATOR 
 

A.  HOW  GUARDIANS  AND  CONSERVATORS  ARE  CHOSEN:    Any  competent  person 
may  be  appointed  as  the  guardian  or  conservator  for  a  person  who  is  incapacitated.  Such  a person 
may be the spouse, an adult child or parent of the proposed ward or protected person, a person who 
has lived with the ward or protected person for a period of six months or more, an adult related by 
blood, adoption, or marriage, or any other adult or professional guardian. Before being appointed as 
the  guardian  or  conservator,  the  court  may  request  various  background  information  from  the 
individual. 

The law requires that the court ask what the incapacitated adult's wishes are for the choice of his or her 
guardian  or  conservator.    Whenever  possible  the  court  will  ask  the  adult  who  he  or  she  would  like 
appointed  as  guardian  or conservator.  The law states that in selecting a guardian or conservator, the 
primary concern is the interest of the incapacitated adult, over and above those of the family or kin.  The 
court  may  consider  a  proposed  guardian’s  or  conservator's  religious,  cultural,  racial  and  ethnic 
background when determining suitability. 

ere are some, but not all, of the relevant factors considered or evaluated when nominating a guardian 

or conservator: 

 

•  Does the person have a sufficient understanding or mental ability to express a preference of who is 

appointed as guardian or conservator? 

Is  there  regular  and  appropriate  interaction  between  the  person  and  the  proposed  guardian  or 
conservator? 

Is  there  interest  and  commitment  of  the  proposed  guardian  or  conservator  in  advocating  for  the 
welfare and rights of the person? 

  Does the proposed guardian or conservator maintain a current understanding of the person's needs 

in all areas of the person's life? 

  Relationship is not a conclusive factor in determining the best interests of the person, but should be 

considered to the extent that it is relevant to the other factors mentioned here. 

1.  Can more than one Guardian or Conservator be appointed?  Co-guardians or conservators can 
be appointed.  There is no statutory limit on the number of guardians or conservators who may be 
appointed for a person.  For practical purposes and ease in decision-making it is recommended that 
no more than two co-guardians or conservators be appointed.  When co-guardians or conservators 
are appointed both signatures are required for written consent and this requires agreement with all 
decisions. 

.  Must the Guardian/Conservator and Ward/Protected Person live in the same city or state?  
There are no residency requirements for a guardian or conservator, but he or she should be able to 
maintain a current understanding of the ward’s or protected person’s physical and mental status and 
needs.  Also be available to carry out all of the powers and duties granted to him or her by the court. 

For example, a person in need of a guardian or conservator may live in Minneapolis, Minnesota, 
with  a  brother  in  Chicago,  Illinois,  who  is  willing  to  act  as  a  guardian  or  conservator.  In  such  a 
situation the brother should not be prevented from becoming a guardian or conservator solely on the 
basis  of  his  residency  if  he  is  otherwise  able  to  carry  out  his  powers  and  duties.   This may be a 
situation where co-guardians or conservators would work well, one may reside out of town and the

section 524.5-309(c) provides: 

(c) Any individual or agency which provides residence, custodial care, medical care, 
employment training or other care or services for which they receive a fee may not be 
appointed as guardian unless related to the respondent by blood, marriage, or adoption.  

Minnesota Statutes Chapter 245A, The Human Services Licensing Act, also prevents guardians or 
conservators from being licensed service providers (the person who is the actual license holder for 
the service) for the same person.   

 

ome questions to be considered before proceeding with a petition are:  

  What is the history of the relationships between the proposed ward or protected person, the 
employee/guardian  or  conservator,  and  the  employer/service  provider?    Is  there  anything 
about  these  current  or  past  relationships  to  indicate  the  proposed  ward’s  or  protected 
person’s best interests won’t be met in this situation? 

  What  is  the  employee’s  ability  to  act  independently  as  the  guardian  or  conservator  when 
making decisions about the services the ward or protected person receives from the guardian’s 
or conservator’s employer?  

  What  assurances  or  protections  for  the  ward  or  protected  person  regarding  service  provision 
decisions will be included as part of this type of guardianship or conservatorship?  Is there any 
reason to believe such protections won’t be effective? 

  Are there no less restrictive alternatives for a guardian or conservator who is willing and able to 

act in the person’s best interest? 

 

4.  Criminal Background Checks for Proposed Guardians and Conservators 

 

A  completed  background  study  consent  form  and  a  check  for  the  applicable  fee  payable  to 
Department  of  Human  Services  Licensing  must  be  submitted  to  the  Department  of  Human 
Services  for  the  background  study.    The  background  study  must  be  completed  before  a  court 
issues a final order appointing a guardian or conservator on a case.  If the proposed guardian or 
conservator has not been a resident of Minnesota for at least ten years, an additional fee must be 
submitted to the Department of Human Services with fingerprint cards as part of the background 
study request.  Both the background study consent form and fingerprint cards are available from 
Court Administration. 

f the guardian or conservator is not an individual, the law specifies that the background study 
must be done on all individuals employed by the proposed guardian or conservator who will be 
responsible for exercising duties under the conservatorship or guardianship.   

ackground studies are not required if the proposed guardian or conservator is: 

1)  a state agency or county; 
2)  a  parent  or  guardian  of  a  proposed  ward  or  protected  person  who  has  developmental 
disability  or  a  related  condition,  if  the  parent  or  guardian  has  raised  the  proposed  ward  or 
protected  person  in  the  family  home  until  the  time  the  petition  is  filed,  unless  counsel 
appointed for the proposed ward or protected person requests the study; or 

3)  a bank with trust powers, bank and trust company, or trust company. 

fter  the  background  check  is  completed,  the  Department  of  Human  Services  will  return  the 
results to the court.  Background checks filed with the courts will be considered confidential and

A.  ON-GOING RESPONSIBILITIES OF GUARDIANS & CONSERVATORS:  According to 
the  guardianship/conservatorship  statute,  Minnesota  Statutes  section  524.5-111,  a  guardian  or 
conservator shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the court at all times and in all things.  In this sense the 
guardian or conservator acts as an agent, or representative, of the court.  Despite the possibility of being 
given very broad powers, the guardian or conservator is accountable to the court in decisions made on 
behalf of the ward or protected person.  A guardian’s or conservator’s actions are subject to review and 
direction by the court. 

 

 

Overall, the ongoing responsibilities of the guardian or conservator include: 

•  To carry out duties and responsibilities granted to them by the court. 

  To abide by any restrictions, either by statute or court order, placed on their powers.  For example, 
conservators of the estate are not allowed to sell personal property or sell real estate without notice 
to  the  protected  person.    Guardians  of  the  person  are  not  allowed  to  consent  to  sterilization, 
psychosurgery,  electroshock,  experimental  procedures,  or  any  other  medical  procedure  which 
violates known conscientious, religious, or moral beliefs of the ward without prior order from the 
court. 

  To maintain a current understanding of the needs of the ward or protected person.  This includes 
maintaining current knowledge of the ward’s or protected person's diagnosis, prognosis, treatments, 
care plan and needs through regular and frequent visits with the ward or protected person as well as 
frequent contacts with care providers. 

  To seek out services and benefits/entitlements which the ward or protected person may need or is 
eligible  for,  and  ensure  that  the  ward  or  protected  person  receives  all  services  and 
benefits/entitlements to which he or she is entitled. 

  The  ward  or  protected  person,  and  interested  persons  of  record  with  the  court, are to be notified 
annually in writing of the right to have the guardianship or conservatorship modified or terminated, 
or request other appropriate relief.  
 

The guardian or conservator must be aware at all times that the only authority he or she has over the 
ward  or  protected  person is  what  has  been  granted  by  the  court,  and  no  more. Respect for the rights 
maintained  by  the  ward  or  protected  person  must  remain  a  primary  concern  of  the  guardian  or 
conservator  in  all  matters and in all decisions.  The guardian or conservator must exercise his or her 
powers in a way which allows the ward or protected person as much independence as possible. 

1.  What  if  the  Guardian  or Conservator will be temporarily unavailable to act?  Minnesota Statutes 
section 524.5-211 allows a parent to delegate responsibilities. A parent or a guardian of a minor or 
incapacitated  person  may  delegate  to  another  person  any  powers  regarding  care,  custody,  or 
property of the minor or ward, except the power to consent to marriage or adoption of a minor ward. 
This is done with a properly executed power of attorney and is for a period not exceeding twelve 
months. A parent of a minor child may delegate those powers for a period not exceeding one year 
by a designated caregiver agreement under chapter 257A.

2.  Does the Guardian and Conservator act as an advocate?:  An advocate is a person who speaks 
in  favor  of  something,  someone  who  makes  recommendations.    An  advocate  argues  for  a  cause, 
defends beliefs, or supports a position.  An advocate does these things on behalf of another person. 

An interested person does not necessarily have to be appointed guardian or conservator to help a 
vulnerable adult.  A number of adults need some help in making decisions.  Some have family or 
friends to help them.  There are laws to protect those who cannot protect themselves, but often these 
laws do not work unless there is an individual who takes a personal interest in a vulnerable adult’s 
welfare  -  an  individual  who  acts  as  an  advocate.    Upon appointment the guardian or conservator 
assumes the role of advocate. 

3.  How  does  a  Guardian  or  Conservator  advocate  effectively?    The  guardian  or  conservator  is 
appointed to make decisions which will be in the best interest of the ward or protected person and 
which will protect that person's civil and legal rights and personal freedoms.  In order to fulfill his 
or  her  duties  the  guardian  or  conservator  must  become  familiar  with  the  ward’s  or  protected 
person's needs, beliefs and preferences.  The guardian or conservator must then make a choice that 
reflects those beliefs, needs, and preferences.  To do this, the guardian or conservator must become 
informed  about  what  services  the  ward  or  protected  person is entitled to and which services will 
meet  his  or  her  needs.    Actively  participating  in  the  person's  life  is  the  most  meaningful  way  to 
obtain the information required to make decisions for another person. 

It is not necessary for a guardian or conservator to know every law, right, entitlement, or service 
that may affect the ward or protected person.  There are advocacy organizations, and state and local 
agencies  in  the  community  which  can  provide  information  regarding  various  services  and 
entitlements, how to access them, and to help in understanding and protecting the rights of the ward 
or protected person. 

t  is  often  helpful  to  seek  assistance  from  or  to  join  an  organization  that  provides  information, 
advocacy,  and  support  services  that  address  the  needs  of  the  ward  or  protected  person.    Such 
organizations are usually a good source of support for family members or care givers. 

B.  POWERS AND DUTIES OF A GUARDIAN OF THE PERSON:  The powers and duties of a 
guardian  of  the  person  are  governed  by  Minnesota  Statutes  sections  252A.111  and  524.5-313.    The 
guardian may have additional powers granted by the court. 

1.  Custody  of  the  Ward  and  to  establish  the  place  of  residence:    The  power  to  determine  the 
ward's place of residence consistent with state and federal law, and the least restrictive environment 
consistent with the ward's best interest. 

The guardian can change the ward’s place of residence.  Additionally, any other interested person 
can petition the court to begin a change of residence.  This option is available to offset potential 
abuses by the guardian.  The guardian can change the ward’s place of residence even if it is against 
the person’s wishes  only if the court does not object, or if no petition is filed which contests the 
move.  The guardian must also notify the court of any changes of address.    

A  guardian  cannot  relocate  the  ward  out  of  state  without  court  order  granting  permission.  The 
ward may not be admitted to any regional treatment center, except after a commitment hearing in 
which the court orders the admission, for outpatient services, or for temporary care for a specific 
period of time not to exceed 90 days in any calendar year. 

efore making a decision to change a person’s residence the guardian must consider: 

•  Are the living arrangements appropriate and the least restrictive?

Rev 8/16

•  Do the living arrangements reflect the ward’s prior lifestyle and is the ward satisfied with the 

current living arrangements? 

  Do the living arrangements meet the needs of the ward with the least amount of intrusion on the 
privacy  and  independence  of  the  ward?    Is  it  clean  and  safe?    Are  needed  support  services 
available?  If the ward resides in a care facility, are there individual plans in place to assure that 
the ward’s personal and medical needs will be met for activities of daily living, recreation?  Are 
there plans in place, as appropriate, to move to a less restrictive setting? 

2.  Provide for care, comfort, and maintenance needs:  The duty to assure that provision has been 
made for the ward’s care, comfort, maintenance needs, including food, shelter, health care, social 
and  recreational  requirements,  and  whenever  appropriate,  training,  education,  and  habilitation  or 
rehabilitation.  The  guardian  has  no  duty  to  pay  for  these  requirements  out  of  their  own  personal 
funds. 

 

Whenever  possible  or  appropriate,  the  guardian  should  meet  these  needs  through  governmental 
benefits  or  services  to  which  the  guardian  is  entitled  or  eligible,  rather  than  the  ward’s  estate.  
Failure to satisfy the needs and requirements of this clause is grounds for removal of the guardian, 
but the guardian does not have any personal or financial liability. 

n order to perform this duty the guardian must carry out the following functions: 

 

•  The guardian has meaningful visits with the ward and at least one other communication with a 
care professional or interested party, at least once a month, or as often as necessary to assure the 
ward’s well-being and to determine the ward’s status.   

  The  guardian  keeps  a  written  summary  of  visits  and  other  communication  related  to  the 
guardianship.  The guardian keeps records regarding the ward.  The guardian is available for 
routine and emergency communications.   

  The  guardian  promotes  the  care,  comfort,  and  maintenance  of  the  ward.  The  ward’s  attitude 
towards his or her current situation is known.  The guardian is aware of what was the ward’s 
basic, original physical appearance, and psychological and emotional state.  

  The guardian knows the condition of the ward’s personal items.   

•  The guardian knows the religious faith and church affiliation of the ward and helps to maintain 

that participation as desired. 

 

3.  Take  reasonable  care  of  personal  effects:    The  duty  to  take  reasonable  care  of  the  ward's 
clothing, furniture, vehicles, and other personal effects, and, if other property requires protection, 
the power to seek appointment of a conservator of the estate. 

Personal  property  should  be  appraised  and  secured.  Reasonable  care  must  be  taken  with  the 
property.  Depriving the ward of the use of the personal belongings must be balanced against the 
possibility  of  the  items  disappearing  by  gift,  theft,  or  otherwise.    Family  pictures,  items  of 
sentimental or religious value, and items of personal property may be stored. 

he  guardian  must  complete  and  file  a  notice  of  Intent  to  Dispose  in  the  manner  required  in 
Minnesota Statutes section 524.5-313, prior to the disposition or sale of the ward’s personal effects. 
The notice must inform the ward of the right to object to the disposition of the property within ten 
days and to petition the court for review of the guardian’s proposed actions.  The notice of objection 
must be served on the guardian by mail or in person, unless the person filing the objection is the 
ward.  Once the guardian is served with notice of an objection, the property may not be disposed of 
unless the court approves of the disposition after a hearing.

4.  Consent to medical or other professional care:  The power to give necessary consent to enable 
the  ward  to  receive  necessary  medical  or  other  professional  care,  counsel,  treatment,  or  service.  
The  guardian  will  not  consent  to  any  medical  care  for  the  ward  which  violates  the  known 
conscientious,  religious,  or  moral  belief  of  the  ward.    No  guardian  may  give  consent  for 
psychosurgery,  electroshock,  sterilization,  or  experimental  treatment  of  any  kind  unless  the 
procedure is first approved by order of the court.  The guardian must exercise informed consent in 
decision making. 

5.  Contracts:  If there is no conservator of the estate, the power to approve or withhold approval 

of any contract the ward makes, except for necessities. 

.  Supervisory authority:  The duty and power to exercise supervisory authority over the ward in a 
manner  that  limits  the  person’s  civil  rights  and  restricts  personal  freedom  only  to  the  extent 
necessary to provide needed care and services. 
 

7.  What are the annual duties of the Guardian of the person? 

 

  6

a.  Annual  report  of  well-being:    In  private  guardianship  cases,  under  Minnesota  Statutes 
section  524.5-316,  the  guardian  must  file  with  the court an annual report of personal well-
being,  within  30  days  of  the  anniversary  date  of  the  appointment  of  the  guardian.    The 
anniversary  date  is  the  date  the  Letters  of  Appointment are signed and dated by the judge.  
The report must contain the guardian’s good faith evaluation of the following information for 
the previous year: 

•  Changes in the medical condition of the ward. 

  Changes in the living conditions of the ward. 

  Changes in the mental and emotional condition of the ward. 

  A listing of hospitalizations of the ward. 

If  the  ward  is  institutionalized,  an  evaluation  of  the  care  and  treatment  received  by  the 
ward. 

•  Restrictions  placed  on  the  ward’s  rights  to  communicate  and  visit  with  persons  of  the 

ward’s choice. 

his report should describe the personal and non-financial status of the ward, contain updates 
regarding any changes in the guardian’s status and capacity to serve as a guardian, and include 
any reimbursements for services rendered in the past year that were not reimbursed by county 
contract. The court or its designee will review the court file each year to ensure that the report 
has been filed and that it contains the required information stated above.  If the report has not 
been filed within 60 days of the required date or if the report does not include the information 
required, the court shall issue an order to show cause. 

 copy of the personal well-being report must be provided to the ward and to interested persons 

of record with the court. 

OTE:  A public guardianship is one in which the individual is a ward of the state, under the 
supervision of the Commissioner of Human Services.  In public guardianship cases, there is no 
requirement to file an annual well-being report with the court.  Rather, under Minnesota Statutes 
section 252A.16, the Commissioner of Human Services is responsible for conducting an annual 
review of the physical, mental, and social adjustment and progress of every ward.

guardian and sent to the ward and to interested persons of record with the court within 30 days 
after the anniversary date of appointment of the guardian.  This notice informs the ward that he 
or she has a right to end or modify the guardianship. 

8.  Keep the Court promptly informed of status changes of the Guardian:  The guardian must report in 

writing to the court within 30 days when any of the following occur: 

the guardian is removed for cause from serving as a guardian or conservator, 

the  guardian  has  a  professional  license  listed  under  Minn.  Stat.  §  524.5-118,  subd.  2a        

  denied, conditioned, suspended, revoked, or canceled,  

the guardian is found civilly liable for fraud, 

the guardian has filed or receives protection under the bankruptcy laws, 

the guardian has had a civil monetary judgment entered against the guardian, 

the  guardian  has  been  convicted  of  a  crime  other  than  a  petty  misdemeanor  or  traffic         

   offense, or 

the guardian has an order for protection issued against the guardian. 

 

 

 

he guardian must provide the ward and to interested persons of record with the court a copy of 
the written report.  The court may decline to appoint and may remove a person as guardian or 
conservator for failure to report any of the occurrences listed above.  See Minn. Stat. § 524.5-
316(b). 

C.  POWERS AND DUTIES OF A CONSERVATOR OF THE ESTATE:  In order to effectively 
carry out the responsibilities as conservator of the estate, careful record keeping is necessary for annual 
accounting  purposes.    Also,  the  conservator  must  establish  a  separate  protected  person  account  to 
disburse  and  deposit  money,  and  should  not  co-mingle  assets  at  any  time.    If  the  protected  person’s 
income  is  insufficient  to  meet  his  or  her  needs,  the  conservator  may  have  to  borrow  money  in  the 
protected person’s name on the protected person’s behalf.  Also sell some of the person’s assets, and/or 
apply for the  protected person to receive federal, state, or county financial or service resources.  The 
conservator should not enter into any agreements to sell property or assets without first consulting his or 
her attorney. 
 

A conservator of the estate has no duty or obligation to pay for any service for the protected person 
from the conservator’s own funds.  But rather seeks out federal, state, or county services to which the 
protected  person  is  entitled.    It  is  the  responsibility  of  the conservator of the estate to manage and 
invest the protected person's assets for the benefit of the protected person. 

1.  Pay reasonable charges for support, maintenance, and education of the protected person:  
The conservator has the duty to pay reasonable charges on behalf of the protected person. Billings 
should issue in the name of the protected person, and all documents signed by the conservator on 
behalf of the protected person should indicate that relationship, to avoid incurring personal liability. 
This means that the conservator must first make sure that the service has been rendered, and that the 
charge is a reasonable one. 

The  conservator  must  maintain  an  accurate  record  of  services  he  or  she  has  performed,  the  time 
spent, and the expenses incurred in performing duties as conservator.  A conservator may charge a 
reasonable fee for the provision of necessary conservatorship services to the protected person. 

or  a  person  residing  at  home  reasonable  charges  might  include:  payment  of  mortgage,  rent,

insurance,  taxes,  utilities,  maintenance  of  the  home,  needed  in-home  services  of  the  person, 
medical, clothing, and other personal items.   

or a person residing in a facility, reasonable charges may include: reviewing the level of care 
assessment (case-mix) of the protected person to be sure the facility’s charge is correct for the 
level  of  care  required;  ensuring  that  the  protected  person  has  sufficient  funds  on  hand  for 
personal spending, and reviewing and monitoring the medical and personal services provided. 

2.  Pay all just and lawful debts of the protected person, pay reasonable charges for support, 
maintenance,  and  education  of  the  protected  person’s  spouse  and  dependents:    The 
conservator of the estate must pay all of the protected person’s debts as they become due.  The 
conservator  is  also  responsible  for  filing  income  tax  returns  on  behalf  of  the  protected  person.  
With  a  court  determination  of  what  is  reasonable,  the  conservator  must  also  pay  support, 
maintenance, and educational expenses of the protected person’s spouse and dependents. 

.  Possess and manage the estate, collect all debts and claims:  One of the conservator’s first 
duties is to take control of (possess) the protected person’s property.  This involves conducting a 
comprehensive search for all assets the protected person owns, and arranging for transfer of title 
or possession to the conservatorship.  The conservator shall investigate and determine all debts 
and claims in order to pursue collection.  If there is a need to protect assets, the conservator may, 
with the consent of the court, institute lawsuits and act on behalf of the protected person.  Also, 
the  conservator  must  invest  all  funds,  preserving,  protecting,  and  conserving  assets  and 
producing as much income as possible with minimal risk to the principle asset. 

The best source of information of what the protected person owns may be the protected person.  
Review  with  the  protected  person  the  financial  records,  such  as  current  bank  and  broker 
statements, income tax returns, account ledgers, deeds and insurance policies.  The conservator 
has  the  right  to  enter  the  protected  person’s  safe  deposit  box  and  remove  the  contents,  upon 
presenting a certified copy of his or her Letters of Conservatorship to the financial institution.  If 
the  box  is  rented  with  another  person,  that  other  person  should  be  present  when  the  box  is 
opened. 

.  What are the Conservator’s duties at the time of appointment?  At the time of appointment 

the conservator of the estate must complete the following: 

•  Prepare an inventory of all property; being sure to check for all bank accounts, stocks, bonds, 

and real estate in the protected person's name. 

  File  a  change  of  address  with  the  post  office  to  ensure  all  future  mail  is  forwarded  to  the 
conservator to aid in locating assets (1099's issued at year end can often help locate additional 
assets).  Personal mail, however, must be returned to the protected person unopened. 

  Take  control  of  all  property  and  assets,  and  make  sure  they  are  adequately  protected  against

loss. 

  Keep thorough records. 

  Determine and collect all income. 

 

  Pay the protected person's debts as they become due. 

 

Invest the property in investments suitable to the protected person's circumstances. 

  Determine whether or not the protected person must file and pay income taxes, and, determine 

whether real estate taxes are due. 

5.  How  does  a  Conservator  manage  insurance?    The  conservator  must  consider  the  following

when inspecting the protected person's insurance: 

a.  Real  property  insurance.    Is  the  property  adequately  insured/replacement  value?    Are  the 

premiums current? 

.  Household insurance.  Does the policy contain adequate coverage? 

.  Health  insurance.    Is  the  policy  cost  effective?    Is  there  duplicate  coverage  with  multiple 

policies?  Is there Medicare A & B coverage? 

.  Life  insurance.    Locate  any  and  all  policies.    Are  premiums  current?    Is  the  insurance 

necessary? 

6.  How  does  a  Conservator  manage  real  estate?    Care  and  maintenance  of  real  estate.  The 
conservator of the estate must arrange for the care and maintenance of the property such as, cutting 
grass,  snow  shoveling,  trash  removal,  furnace  inspection,  or  adequate  heating  fuel.    When  the 
conservator is appointed he or she must determine the following: 

a.  Sale of real estate.  If the property the conservator wants to sell is the principal residence of the 
protected  person,  it  must  be  determined  that  the protected  person will  be  unable  to  return  to 
independent living.  Conservators should consult with their attorney on such matters.  Keep in 
mind the following requirements: 

  Secure a doctor's statement to determine the protected person's physical health and whether 

or not the person is able to live independently or with assistance at home. 

  Two disinterested persons who are appointed by the court must appraise the property. 

  Petition the court for permission to sell.  The court will choose an appraiser to appraise the 
property.  Appraisals are completed after the hearing.  The appraisal must be attached to the 
Order Directing Sale.  

  Relatives may be given a chance to purchase at appraised value prior to the general public. 

•  Property cannot be sold for less than the appraised price without court approval.  If the sale 

takes longer than six months, the property may have to be reappraised. 

 

  Never give up the abstract without getting a receipt. 

  Prior  to  closing,  have  the  court  issue  an  order  directing  sale,  order  confirming  sale,  and 
current  Letters  of  Conservatorship.  The conservator's deed must be prepared.  Often the 
closing company wants to see these documents prior to closing.

7.  Does the Conservator of the estate ever have to go to court?  A conservator of the estate has 
the  authority  to  complete  most  of  these  tasks,  but  some,  such  as  the  sale  of  real  estate,  require 

GAC101  State 

ENG 

Rev 8/16 

 

www.mncourts.gov/forms 

Page 23 of 63 

additional  authorization  from  the  court.    The  conservator  should  obtain  competent  legal  and 
financial advice, particularly in the management of large asset situations, contested, or controversial 
situations. 

8.  What is the inventory?  An inventory of all assets owned by the protected person at the time of 
the  conservator’s  appointment  must  be  filed  with  the  court  within  60  days of the appointment.  
The  protected  person  may  also  be  required  to  file  appropriate  accounting  with  an  agency 
administering benefits.  The inventory provides several pieces of information to the court: 

It serves as the initial listing of property for which the conservator will be held accountable. 

It assists the court in determining the sufficiency of the conservator’s bond. 

It advises the court of the extent of the protected person’s estate, and indirectly, of the income 
likely to be received for the protected person’s support. 

 

 

 

The inventory of the property includes: 

•  Real estate 

  Furniture and household goods 

  Wearing apparel 

  Corporation stocks 

•  Bank Accounts, Certificates of Deposit, Receivables 

•  All other personal property 
 

The  conservator  determines  the  fair  market  value  of  all  assets  listed  in  the  inventory.    If 
appraisers  are  appointed  by  the  court,  the  value  of  assets  will  be  determined  by  the  court 
appointed appraisers.  The conservator’s attorney should assist in preparing the final draft of the 
inventory and filing it with the court.  If the conservator fails to file an inventory, the court may 
issue a citation, and may remove him or her as conservator. 

9.  What are the Conservator’s annual duties? 

 

a.  Annual accounting and annual notice of rights:  An annual account must be filed with the court 
which shows all receipts to and disbursements from the estate. The conservator must also give 
the protected person and interested persons of record with the court an Annual Notice of Rights 
to  Petition  within  30  days  after  the  anniversary  date  of  the  conservator’s  appointment.    The 
anniversary date is the date the Letters of Appointment are signed and dated by the judge.  This 
initial  account  should  begin  from  the  date  of  appointment,  and  will  use  the  figure  for  the 
personal  property  listed  on  the  inventory.    Later  accounts  will  start  with  the  ending  balance 
from the account of the previous year.   
 

 
  No order settling or allowing an annual or final account shall be issued by the court without a 
hearing to approve the account and notice of the hearing provided to the protected person and 
interested persons.  There must be a hearing on the final account at the death of the protected 
person or at the death of the conservator. 

 

 

A hearing for the settlement and allowance of an annual or final account may be ordered upon 
the  request  of  the  court  or any interested party.  A hearing shall be held for such purpose in 
each conservatorship of the estate at least once every five years upon proper notice.

10.  What financial records is the Conservator responsible for keeping:  The conservator is responsible 
for  keeping  accurate  financial  records  at  all  times.    In  order  to  do  this  the  following  steps  are 
recommended: 

•  Establish a separate conservatorship bank account to receive and disburse all deposits and make 

 

all payments. 

  Maintain  a  complete  and  accurate  ledger  which  shows  all  funds  going  through  the 

conservatorship account. 

  Seek  approval  from  the  court  before  making  large  purchases.    This  court  approval  may  be 

obtained ex parte, meaning without a hearing. 

11.    Keep  the  Court  informed  of  status  changes  of  the  Conservator:    The  conservator  must  report  in

  offense, or 

the conservator has an order for protection issued against the conservator. 

he conservator must provide the protected person and to interested persons of record with the 
court a copy of the written report.  The court may decline to appoint and may remove a person as 
guardian or conservator for failure to report any of the occurrences listed above.  See Minn. Stat. 
§ 524.5-420.

or self-reliant, functioning on the part of the ward or protected person, 

safeguard  the  decision-making  powers  of  the  ward  or  protected  person  so  that  they  are  not 
restricted beyond a clearly established need, and 

  make decisions only to the extent necessary to provide needed care and services for the ward or 

 guardian or conservator needs to recognize that people have the right to make their own decisions.  
We all have an interest, for a number of reasons, in making our own decisions about our lives. When we 
are no longer legally able to do so the effect can be tremendous.  The impact of no longer being able to 
control and enjoy one's property, for example, may be devastating for some people.   

1.  Are there criteria by which to make decisions?  When making decisions the guardian or conservator 

must:

VII.  DECISION MAKING 

 
A.  STANDARDS  AND  PRINCIPLES  OF  DECISION  MAKING:    Guardians  and  conservators  take 
on  a  very  important  task,  to  make  decisions  for  another  person.    This  can  be  a  very  rewarding 
activity.  The guardian or conservator must be careful to act in the ward’s or protected person’s best 
interest and preferences. 

 

CHAPTER VII 

protected person.   

o do this, the guardian or conservator must: 

  get to know the ward or protected person,  

  understand any needs or problems the ward or protected person may have, and  

  be able to ask questions and seek opinions about alternative ways to meet the needs of the ward 

or protected person.   

The guardian or conservator is bound by law to: 

consider the ward’s or protected person's reasonable wishes,  

find the support services that will provide the care that the person requires, and  

  weigh and balance all of the potential benefits or risks to the person.   

2.  What are the standards of ethical decision making?  Ethical substitute decision making assures: 

•  That no less restrictive alternatives exist including the use of technological assistance. 

  That the potential benefit and harm to the ward or protected person has been weighed. 

  That the ward’s or protected person’s desires and preferences have been considered. 

•  That the ward or protected person is involved and included in community settings and activities 

whenever reasonably possible.

This  requires  that  the  guardian  or  conservator  knew  the  person,  or  is  able  to  find  out  this 
information  by  interviewing  people  who  did  know  the  ward  or  protected  person,  before  the 
ward or protected person became incapacitated.  The guardian or conservator must also review 
any written statements or other declarations made by the ward or protected person before the 
ward or protected person became incapacitated. 

A  modified  form  of  substituted  judgment  is  codified  in  M.S.  §  524.5-411  which  allows  the 
conservator to provide estate planning for the protected person.  This can only be done with a 
hearing and court approval.  All persons that may be affected by the estate planning must be 
given notice of the hearing.  Estate planning is not proper if it deprives the protected person of 
assets  that  would  otherwise  be  used  or  applied  for  the  protected  person’s  own  benefit.    For 
example, medical assistance planning that gifts all, or substantially all, of the protected person’s 
assets  away  is  per  se  improper  because  funds  are  being  diverted  away  from  the  protected 
person.  If there is more than enough funds to provide for the protected person’s on-going care 
then excess funds might be properly gifted.  Also, planning for transfers that take place only 
upon the protected person’s death may be appropriate. 

.  Best interest:  If the ward or protected person has always been considered incapacitated then 
the  guardian/conservator  must  make  decisions  that  are  in  the  ward’s/protected  person’s  best 
interest.  Best interest  has two parts:   

  The  second  part  considers  the  benefits  and  harms  to  the  ward  or  protected  person  of  a 
particular act or course of action based on reasonable alternatives, and selects a reasonable 
alternative that provides the most benefit and least harm.   

  •

•  The first part considers the ward’s or protected person's wishes.   

These decisions require the guardian or conservator to obtain enough knowledge of the ward or 
protected person in order to make decisions on the ward’s or protected person's behalf that are 
in his or her best interest. 

.  Least  restrictive  alternative:    Least  restrictive  alternative  means  that  the  guardian  or 
conservator  must  choose  alternatives  that  are  the  least  likely  to  interrupt,  bother,  or  interfere 
with  the  desires,  lifestyle,  or  preferences  of  the  ward  or  protected  person,  and  are  the  most 
likely alternatives other people in the community would choose if they didn’t need a substitute 
decision-maker, given the level of supervision and protection required for the ward or protected 
person.   

Allowing least restrictive alternatives requires: 

•  The level of supervision and protection must allow "risk-taking" to the degree that there is 
no reasonable likelihood that serious harm will happen to the ward or protected person or to 
others.   

  That  reasonable  efforts  have  been  made  to  obtain  the  opinions  of  the  relatives  and  other 

involved persons. 

 

tandards of ethical decision making are based on the following principles:  

a.  Substituted  judgment:    Substituted  judgment  means  the  guardian  or  conservator  makes 
decisions  for the ward or protected person based on how the ward or protected person would 
have decided if not incapacitated.  This standard assumes competence of the ward or protected 
person prior to incapacity when the ward or protected person would have been able to express 
an informed choice.

federal law.   

  The guardian or conservator must plan for the individual needs of the ward or protected 

person and assist and represent the ward or protected person.   

t is the guardian’s and conservator's responsibility to determine that services for the ward or 
protected person are being provided in the least restrictive manner. 

d.  Informed consent:  Informed consent means that consent is valid only if the person giving the 

consent understands: 

the nature of what is being consented to;  

the benefits and/or the risks of harm; and  

  what  alternatives  are  available  to  the  ward  or  protected  person  if  consent  is  given  or  if 

consent is not given.   

he person giving consent must be able to give a reason for selecting a particular alternative.   

nformed consent requires that the person giving consent: 

  has the knowledge available to make a reasonable decision; 

  has the capacity or ability to make reasoned decisions based upon information that applies 

to the situation; and 

is  giving  consent  voluntarily  and  without  coercion,  that  is,  there  is  no  intimidation  or 
pressure, either obvious or suggested from another person. 

3.  How are the Ward’s or Protected person’s rights protected when making decisions?  A person under 
guardianship or conservatorship retains any civil or constitutional rights not specifically given away 
by the court.  When giving consent, the guardian or conservator must protect these legal rights and 
interests of the ward or protected person and must take appropriate action when those rights are, or 
appear to have been, limited or violated.  The guardian or conservator must take appropriate action 
on behalf of the ward or protected person according to the state and federal law which applies to the 
situation.  

4.  Must the ward’s or protected person’s wishes be considered in every decision? Whatever the need 
may  be,  the  guardian  or  conservator  must  always  consider  the  ward’s  or  protected  person’s 
wishes.    A  ward  or  protected  person  always  has  certain  rights  that  must  be  protected  by  the 
guardian  or  conservator  when  making  decisions.    A  guardian  or  conservator  may  not  make 
decisions that restrict these rights.  

A guardian may be given, "the duty and power to exercise supervisory authority over the ward or 
protected  person  in  a  manner  which  limits  civil  rights  and  restricts  personal  freedom only  to  the 
extent necessary to provide needed care and services" (Minnesota Statutes section 524.5-313(c)(6))

B.  RIGHTS  OF  WARDS  AND  PROTECTED  PERSONS:    A  guardian  or  conservator  has  the 
responsibility to ensure that these rights are not violated.  These rights must be reviewed and explained 
to the ward or protected person in a manner which he or she can best understand. 

1.  What  are  a  ward’s  or  protected  person’s  civil  and  constitutional  rights?    A  person  under

decisions made. 

  The right to legal representation. 

  The right to marry. 

2.  What  are  a  Ward’s  or  Protected  person’s  statutory  rights  under  Minnesota  law?    The  ward  or 
protected person also has the following basic protections and rights according to Minnesota Statutes 
sections 524.5-120: 

  The right to treatment with dignity and respect; 

 

•  The  right  to  due  consideration  of  current  and  previously  stated  personal  desires,  medial 
treatment preferences, religious beliefs, and other preferences and opinions in decisions made 
by the guardian or conservator; 
 

•  The  right  to  receive  timely  and  appropriate  health  care  and  medical  treatment  that  does  not 

violate known conscientious, religious, or moral beliefs of the ward or protected person; 
 

•  The right to exercise control of all aspects of life not delegated specifically by court order to the 

guardian or conservator;

•  The right to care, comfort, social and recreational needs, training, education, habilitation, and 

rehabilitation care and services, within available resources; 
 

•  The right to be consulted concerning, and to decide to the extent possible, the reasonable care 
and  disposition  of  the  ward  or  protected  person’s  clothing,  furniture,  vehicles,  and  other 
personal effects, to object to the disposition of personal property and effects, and to petition the 
court for a review of the guardian’s or conservator’s proposed disposition; 
 

•  The right to personal privacy; 

•  The  right  to  communication  and  visitation  with  persons  of  the  ward  or  protected  person’s 
choice,  provided  that  if  the  guardian  has  found  that  certain  communication  or  visitation  may 
result in harm to the ward’s health, safety, or well-being, that communication or visitation may 
be restricted but only to the extent necessary to prevent the harm; 
 

•  The right to marry and procreate, unless court approval is required, and to consent or object to 

sterilization as provided in section 524.5-313, paragraph (c), clause (4), item (iv); 
 

•  The  right  to  petition  the  court  for  termination  or  modification  of  the  guardianship  or 

•  The right to be represented by an attorney in any proceeding or for the purpose of petitioning 

Example 1:  An elderly ward or protected person who is incapacitated, but not incompetent, is in need 
of at least partial daily supervision for medical or safety reasons, but wishes to stay in their home rather 
than being placed in a more supervised living environment. 

xample 2:  A person with developmental disabilities who has limited independent living skills wishes 

to reside independently, rather than live in a home with supervised living services. 

n both examples, the guardian is bound by law to consider the ward’s reasonable wishes.  The guardian 
must then choose services that provide the needed level of support, but that are also the least restrictive 
type of support. For an elderly person that may mean seeking in home health care services and house 
keeping services.   

or the person with developmental disabilities services may include a 24 hour plan of care, but not 24 
hour  supervision.    The  person  may  need  assistance  in  planning  menus,  grocery  shopping,  learning 
homemaking skills, and money management.   

1.  What  if  the  ward  or  protected  person  cannot  speak  or  is  not  understandable?  Some  people  may 
have difficulty expressing their wishes due to a medical condition, a mental health problem, or a 
developmental disability.  A guardian or conservator is required to get to know the person and 
how  they  communicate,  to  aid  in  making  decisions.    The  guardian  or  conservator  may  need  to 
seek  assistance  in  determining  the  ward’s  or  protected  person’s  preferences  by  having  the 
person’s communication skills assessed.

C.  DETERMINING  AND  CONSIDERING  WISHES  OR  PREFERENCES:    A  guardian  or 
conservator  must  always  give  consideration  to  the  ward’s  or  protected  person's  reasonable  wishes.  
What should the guardian or conservator do if the wishes of the ward or protected person conflict with 
what the guardian or conservator thinks is in the ward’s or protected person’s best interest?

conservatorship or for other appropriate relief; 
 

the court; and 
 

•  The right to vote, unless restricted by the court. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

For example, through a communication assessment the guardian or conservator should be able to 
determine  how  the  person  communicates.    Some  people  may  need  some  form  of  assistive 
technology to communicate.   A speech pathologist with expertise with the particular speech and 
communication needs should be sought, such as, persons with speech delays due to developmental 
disabilities, persons recovering from strokes, persons recovering from a traumatic brain injury, or 
persons experiencing dementia.   

D.  CONSENT  OR  DENIAL  CHECKLIST:    Review  the  questions  below  when  making  a  consent 
determination.  If the answer is “no” to any of the questions the guardian or conservator must stop and 
obtain the necessary information in order to continue with the decision making process. 

 

•  Has the court modified the person’s rights in this area? 
•  Does the guardian or conservator have the legal authority to make the decision?   
•  Has  the  guardian  or  conservator  determined  whether  or  not  this  consent  requires  the  review  and 

approval of the court? 

•  Does the guardian or conservator understand the nature of what is being consented to?  
•  Does  the  guardian  or  conservator  understand  the  benefits  and/or  the  risk  of  harm  to  the  ward  or 

protected person if consent is, or is not, given? 

Is the guardian or conservator aware of all the alternatives?   

•  Has the guardian or conservator weighed the benefits and/or the risk of harm?  
• 
•  Can the guardian or conservator give a reason for selecting this particular alternative?   
• 

Is this the least restrictive, most normalized alternative given the person’s need for supervision and 
protection?   

•  Has  the  guardian  or  conservator  obtained  and  weighed  the  opinion,  religious,  moral,  or  cultural 

beliefs, desires, and preferences of the ward or protected person? 

•  Has the guardian or conservator obtained and weighed the opinion of the nearest actively involved 

relative(s)? 

•  Has the guardian or conservator consulted the necessary experts for their opinion? 
•  Are all involved interested parties in agreement with this decision? 
• 

Is this decision a reasonable decision that would be made for any person regardless of disability, 
age, race, ethnicity, place of residence? 

•  Has the guardian or conservator determined what funding resources are necessary and available to 

Is the necessary funding available? 

• 
•  Has the guardian or conservator determined whether this decision requires a revision to the person’s 

pay for this alternative? 

service plans? 

•  Has the guardian or conservator made the necessary changes to the person’s service plans? 

E.  MEDICAL TREATMENT DECISIONS:  A major responsibility given by the court to a guardian 
of  the  person  is  that  of  determining  medical  treatment.    The  guardian  should  consider  the  ward’s 
currently  expressed  wishes,  as  well  as  all  available  information  about  the  ward’s  past  religious 
beliefs,  values,  and  expressed  wishes.    The  guardian  should  also  seek  input  from  involved  family 
members. 

1.  When  is  it  necessary  to  go to court for approval of medical treatment? In  some  cases,  including 
where  the  ward  expresses  any  objection  to  the  proposed  treatment,  the  guardian  may  need  to 

GAC101  State 

ENG 

Rev 8/16 

 

www.mncourts.gov/forms 

Page 35 of 63 

request  a  hearing  to  obtain  the  probate  court’s  decision  on  whether  the  treatment  should  be 
authorized or withheld.  Depending on the circumstances, decisions to authorize termination of 
life-support  may  also  require  a  court  order.    It  is  very  important  for  guardians  to  consult  their 
attorneys  in  these  cases.    Psychosurgery,  electro-convulsive  therapy  (ECT),  sterilization, 
experimental  treatment  of  any  kind,  or  treatment  which  violates  the  known  religious, 
conscientious, or moral beliefs of the ward, requires court approval after a special court hearing. 

.  What  happens  if  the  ward  refuses  treatment?    There  may  be  times  when a medical treatment is 
ordered which has been determined to be in the best interest of the ward, but the ward refuses the 
treatment.    This  can  occur  in  any  case,  but  occurs most frequently in regard to administration of 
psychotropic  medications.  In  these  situations  the  guardian  with  the  power  to  consent  to  medical 
treatment may override the decision of the ward to refuse treatment.  

f the ward refuses treatment the guardian must determine what the refusal is based upon.  Is the 
ward  able  to  express  a  reasonable  objection  based  on  known  religious,  conscientious,  or  ethical 
beliefs?  If so, the guardian may not consent even if treatment is in the ward's best interests.  

f the person’s refusal is not based on any of the reasons above, and is not rational, the guardian 
does  have  the  authority  to  override  the  refusal  and  consent  to  administration  of  the  treatment 
regardless  of  the  person’s  refusal.    When  administering  a  treatment  which  a  ward  has  refused, 
caution  and  protection  must  be  used  if  it  is  necessary  to  physically  or  mechanically  restrain  the 
person in order to administer the medication or treatment.   

or  persons  who  have  a  developmental  disability  and  are  being  served  by  a  licensed  service 
provider,  such  a  procedure  would  be  exempted  from  Minnesota  Rules,  part  9525.2700  to 
9525.2810, commonly known as 40.  This rule regulates aversive and deprivation procedures used 
by  providers  of  services  to  persons  with  developmental  disabilities.    In  this  case  the  restraint  is 
considered a medical mechanical restraint, as the person must be held in order for the treatment to 
be  administered  to  treat  a  specific  medical  condition  that  will  not  improve  without  the  use  of 
restraint.  This action must be planned and documented in the person's individual care or program 
plan and the restraint ordered by the physician. 

uardians  must  use  caution  when  overriding  a  ward’s  refusal  and  assure  that the solutions are 
solutions of last choice after every other less restrictive alternative has been considered and used 
or  rejected  and  this  process  has  been  sufficiently  documented.        In  this  situation,  alternative, 
non-judicial  means  of  securing  consent  are  acceptable  so  long  as  they  ensure  a  high  degree  of 
reliability, the final decision isn't being made by the person recommending or administering the 
treatment, and that there are adequate procedural protections for the ward.  The ward may ask a 
court to review the guardian’s decision. 

 

F.  MEDICAL TREATMENT CONSENT CHECKLIST:  The following is a guideline for procedures 

to follow when making medical decisions: 

 

Is  the  decision  legally  the  guardian’s  to  make?    If  in  doubt,  refer  to  the  guardian’s  Letters  of 
Guardianship issued by the court. 

Is there a regular physician?  Is the physician aware of the ward’s living arrangements and current 
care or assistance being given by others? 

Is the ward now following the recommended medical procedures?  If not, what are the reasons? 

  Can  the  ward  remember  and  correctly  follow  medical  advice,  medication  schedules,  and  report 

warning signs of possible problems? 

  Are there laws governing the requested care or treatment?

  What are the less restrictive options?  Have they been considered prior to this current request for 

alternative care or treatment? 

  Has the guardian visited the ward recently?  Does the situation the guardian observe reflect the facts 

being described to the guardian by others? 
 

•  Has  the guardian solicited the ward’s opinion regarding the requested care or treatment? Has the 

guardian explored for evidence of past opinions of the ward regarding care or treatment? 

  Does the requested care or treatment violate the ward’s religious, conscientious, or moral beliefs? 

  Has the guardian solicited the opinions of the ward’s family and friends?  Is there any evidence that 

their opinions may be based on some personal gain? 

  Should  the  guardian  solicit  the  opinions  of  other  experts  such  as  advocates,  biomedical  ethics 

committee, medical specialist, psychiatrist, psychologist, or others? 

Is there evidence that the care or treatment being requested discriminates against the ward?  Would 
it be requested if the person were not elderly/developmentally disabled/indigent, etc.? 

 

Is there consensus among the interdisciplinary team? 

  Does the guardian have all the necessary information documented in writing? 

 

 

G.  ADDITIONAL  CONSIDERATIONS  FOR  CONSENTS  FOR  LIMITING  MEDICAL 
TREATMENT:    This  would  include,  but  is  not  limited  to:  Consent  for  orders  of  DNR  –  Do  Not 
Resuscitate; withholding or withdrawing ventilators for assisted breathing, withholding or withdrawing 
artificially administered nutrition and hydration, or therapies such as kidney dialysis, chemotherapy or 
radiation, or surgery. 

For  any  medical  treatment  decisions  beyond  those  which  are  fairly  routine,  the  following  steps  are 
recommended: 

  All interested parties should be involved so that all viewpoints are represented.  This may help to 
minimize  legal  risks.    All  family  members  who  are  involved  with  the  ward’s  care  should  be 
included  and  any  other family members who may reasonably wish to be included should also be 
notified. 

Input should be solicited from others directly involved in the care of the ward, as they may have 
information about the ward’s wishes. 

  The physician should participate in a full discussion with the guardian, the ward, if at all possible, 
and other interested persons.  The physician should be prepared to give a medically and ethically 
sound  reason  for  the  treatment  recommendation.    If  the  physician  is  not  clear,  do  not  make  a 
decision until you understand the issue. 

  The guardian should be aware of and understand the ward’s: 

-   history of and current general medical and psychiatric conditions and specific diagnoses and the 

cause and recent history of the person’s deterioration; 

-   is the condition permanent and irreversible; is the condition terminal; what is the prognosis and 

life expectancy with or without treatment; 

-   the  anticipated  results  and  risks  of  the  proposed  treatment;  the  probable  consequences  if  the

treatment is or is not given.   

The guardian will need to consult with the physician on these matters and may need to review the 
medical records. 

•  A second medical opinion should be obtained regarding the medical and ethical soundness of the 

treatment recommendation, and to possibly consider alternative treatment options. 

  A  biomedical  ethics  committee  consultation  should  be  sought  to  assist  the  decision  maker  in 
considering  the  medical  and  ethical  soundness  of  the  treatment  recommendation,  to  request 
clarification on any medical or ethical issues.

H.  CONSENT  FOR  BEHAVIOR  CONTROLLING  INTERVENTIONS:    There  may  be  occasions 
when  the  behavior  of  the  ward  becomes  difficult  for  care  staff  to  deal  with  effectively.    At  other 
times,  some  ward’s  behavior  may  be  of  danger  to  self  or  others.  In these cases the guardian must 
consider which options are available to help the ward get the behavior under control, and which are 
the least restrictive and least intrusive to the ward. 

When considering the use of any behavior management intervention it is important to realize that some 
types of behaviors will not be reduced or eliminated and may increase.  This is most common in persons 
who have Alzheimer’s disease, or other related dementia diseases.  This also occurs in some people who 
develop permanent side effects from long term administration of certain psychotropic medications.  In 
these  cases  the  goals  and  outcomes  of  behavior  management  will  focus  more  on  helping  the  person 
avoid harm or danger to self or others, not on reduction and elimination of the behavior. 

1.  What are the options to control behavior?  There are a variety of options to consider.  These include 
behavior  management,  physical restraints, and medication, or a combination of these approaches.  
The discussion here addresses behavior management and physical restraint, the use of medication is 
discussed later. 

.  What  is  behavior  management?    Behavior  management  or  behavior  intervention  is  based  on  the 
principle  that  behavior  followed  by  a  positive  and  pleasurable  experience  will  strengthen  and 
increase.  A behavior followed by a negative or unpleasant experience will weaken and decrease.  
Behavior  management  is  less  restrictive,  less  intrusive  than  the  use  of  medication  to  control 
behavior or the use of physical restraints.    

.  What  are  the  keys  to  successful  behavior  management?    The  key  to  a  successful  behavior 

management plan is assuring that: 

• 
• 

• 

• 

the behavior management plan fits the needs of the individual,  
that alternative, appropriate behavior skills are developed as part of the behavior management 
plan, as well as concentrating on reducing the undesired behavior,   
it  is  understood  what  the  person  may  be  trying  to  communicate  through  the  inappropriate 
behavior, and 
it is discovered what is happening within the person’s environment that may be reinforcing the 
behavior and causing it to continue, and then planning to change that part of the environment or 
how the person experiences that environment.

4.  What if the Ward’s behavior is very challenging?  The terms "aversive and deprivation" designate 
and  describe  a  category  of  techniques  and  procedures  applied  under  the  general  term  behavior 
management  or  behavior  intervention.    Physical  Restraint  is  a  procedure  which  falls  under  this 
category.    Aversive  and  deprivation  procedures  combined  with  positive  approaches  have  been 
effective in reducing, and in some cases eliminating, challenging behavior.  Most often it serves to 
protect  the  person,  property,  or  others  from  injury  or  harm.    The  use  of  aversive  or  deprivation 
procedures is not recommended unless other less restrictive and positive methods have been tried 
first and it is used under the supervision of a person trained in behavior management and behavior 
analysis. 

Each  individual  behavior  management  program  plan  that  uses  aversive  or  deprivation  techniques 
must  identify  specific  conditions  for  the  individual  that  must  be  met  before  the  aversive  or 
deprivation technique is used.  Positive approaches must be tried and shown to be ineffective before 
the start of an aversive or deprivation procedure.  Positive procedures must be used at the same time 
as  any  aversive  or  deprivation  procedure.    All  parts  of  the  behavior  reduction  plan  must  be 
specifically related to the person’s own needs and closely monitored. 

 

5.  When is behavior management really necessary?  The guardian must closely follow the use of any 
behavior management programming to assure that it is always meeting the needs and best interests 
of  the  ward.    The  guardian  must  also  be  aware  that  such  techniques  may  be  used  more  for  the 
convenience of care staff than for the best interest of the ward.   

Under  federal  regulations  for  nursing  homes,  informed  consent  from  the  guardian  must  be  given 
before aversive procedures are used.  For example, physical restraints, such as a "poesy," for use in 
a  wheel  chair  would  be  considered  a  restraint.    A  doctor  may  prescribe  the  use  of  restraints  for 
medical purposes.  But there may be occasions when care staff use this type of restraint to control a 
person because it is easier than engaging the person in some other appropriate or needed activity.  
This may happen more frequently in care facilities or by in-home care providers where care staff are 
untrained and underpaid, or there is not enough staff to attend to all the people for whom they are 
responsible.  In any situation the guardian must be informed about the use of the restraint and given 
information about how and why it is being used before giving consent for its use. 

6.  What  are  the  Ward’s  rights  when  a  behavior  management  plan  is  used?    All  licensed  service 
providers  operate  under  very  specific  regulations  which  allow  them  to  perform certain functions, 
but  which  also  protect  the  human,  civil,  and  legal rights of the person receiving the service. The 
guardian  should  become  familiar  with  the  rights  of  the  ward  within  any  service  the  person  may 
receive.  Also, the guardian should ask the service provider to give him or her a written copy of the 
rights of persons receiving their services and ask them to explain any portion which the guardian 
may not fully understand. 

I. 

BEHAVIOR MANAGEMENT CONSENT CHECKLIST:  Before consenting to the use of aversive 
or deprivation procedures, make sure that there is careful planning and that it is the last alternative to be 
tried.  To assist the guardian in making these decisions, a checklist has been developed.  If the guardian 
answers  “No”  to  many  of  these  questions,  he  or  she  may  want  to  re-consider  the  use  of  aversive/ 
deprivation procedures. 

•  Does staff have reasonable knowledge of behavior management techniques? 
• 

If aversive and deprivation procedures are being planned, are they truly the ‘last resort?’  Has there 
been  a  succession  of  well  designed  positive  behavior  management  techniques  which  have  been 
completely implemented and found unsuccessful? 

•  Have  staff  been  instructed  on  how  to  develop  non-aversive,  positive  programs  for  challenging 

•  Have  the  possible  side  effects  of  medication,  behavioral  techniques,  deprivation,  and  aversive 

behaviors? 

stimuli been fully discussed?

•  Will the care-giver be able to implement these methods in the ward’s home?  What will happen if 

the care-giver cannot or does not want to implement the programs? 

•  Can the behavior management procedure be used in all the settings in which the ward exhibits the 

• 
• 

• 

behavior? 
Is the environment in which the ward resides or receives services stimulating and supportive?  
Is the guardian sure that the disruptive behaviors are not the result of frustration?  Communication 
limitations? Lack of alternative means to express anger? Refusal? Boredom? The result of untreated 
illness or pain? 
Is  the  facility  or  program  including  the  guardian  in  its  planning  for  behavior  management 
procedures? 

•  Have staff been instructed on how to perform the procedure? 
•  Do  staff  have  resources  available  for  consultation,  such  as  a  social  worker,  a  psychologist,  or 

psychiatrist? 

•  Does  the  guardian  feel  that  the  ward’s  dignity  is  being  maintained  throughout  both  the  planning 

process and the administration of the behavior management procedures? 

•  Has the ward recently experienced life events which would explain the behaviors? 

 

 

 

J.  CONSENT  FOR  USE  OF  BEHAVIOR  ALTERING  MEDICATION:   Any guardian who makes 
decisions for an individual is naturally concerned with choices regarding behavior altering medication.  
These medications are called “psychotropics.”  A subclass of these medications is called “neuroleptic” 
medications.  Psychotropic medication will not necessarily solve or eliminate all problems an individual 
is facing, yet it may be unfair to deprive an individual of medication which can assist in the person's life. 
 It is how the medication is used that is the key. 

1.  What  happens  after  consenting  to  the  use  of  medication?    The  guardian  needs  to  continue 
monitoring the use of this medication.  Consenting to the use of the medication is the beginning 
of  an  on-going  process  of  evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  the  treatment,  to  ensure  that  it  is  of 
benefit to the person.  The guardian has the authority to refuse the use of medication, as well as 
agree  to  the  use  of  this  class  of  medications.  The  guardian  should  include  all  medication 
strategies and results in the annual well-being report which he or she submits to the court.  

K.  BEHAVIOR MEDICATION CONSENT CHECKLIST:  If  the questions in this checklist cannot be 

answered, the guardian should consider an alternative method of behavior management: 

•  What are the specific behaviors or statements of the individual that the medication is to change?  If 
a psychiatric diagnosis is present, what are the specific behaviors that the medication is to change? 

  What information -- or data -- is recorded and collected and used to monitor the behavior in order to 
determine  if  the  psychotropic  medication  is  having  its  desired  effect?    Is  the  data  "opinion"  or 
actually observed behavior?  Is the data shared with the guardian? 

  What  are  the  specifics  of  the  medication:    the  dose,  the  possible  dose  range,  the  route  of 
administration, the expected duration?  How long is it to be used before it is concluded it is working 
or not working? 

  What  are  the  side-effects  and  risks  of  the  medication?    How  are  they  treated?    Is  the  person  at 

higher risk for some of the side effects? 

  How will the medication be monitored?  What is the monitoring system?  What specific assessment 
tools  are  used  to  check  for  side  effects?    How  often  are  they  used?    How  will  the  guardian  or 
conservator be informed if side effects are observed?

•  What other behavior management techniques are being used along with the use of the psychotropic 
medication?  What  kind  of  educational,  environmental  or  skill  building  efforts  are  also  in  place?  
Have these been considered and properly addressed? 

Is the lowest effective dose of the medication being used?  If attempts to lower the dosage are made, 
are these done very gradually in order to prevent withdrawal reactions? 

  Are  medication  changes  occurring  without  the  guardian  being  informed?    Are  too  many 

"emergencies" occurring and medication started without the guardian’s consent? 

  The  most  important  question:    How  is  the  person  doing  when  the  guardian  sees  the  person  and 
observes the person’s daily activities?  Is the individual participating in life's activities to the extent 
of their ability, or: (a) is the behavior still interfering with life despite the medication; or (b) are side 
effects present and interfering with life activities?

VIII.  SERVICE PLANNING   
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A.  HOW TO PLAN FOR SERVICES:  A ward or protected person may be entitled to receive certain 
services  or  financial  assistance,  called  entitlements,  or  certain  benefits,  if  he/she  meets  specific 
eligibility requirements.  The guardian or conservator has responsibility under state statute to investigate 
to determine whether or not the ward or protected person is eligible for any of these programs. The ward 
or protected person may be eligible for certain entitlements or benefits based on his or her income, age, 
or medical condition.   

1.  How does a person apply for these entitlements and benefits?  To apply for these entitlements or 
benefits,  contact  a  financial  worker  or  case  manager  at  the  ward’s  or  protected  person’s  local 
county  social  services  office.    Many  advocacy  and  community  organizations  working  with 
certain populations, such as the elderly or the disabled, can be contacted for information about 
these  programs  as  well.    For  programs  which  are  part  of  the  Social  Security  Administration, 
application is made by contacting the Social Security Administration. 

The guardian or conservator works with service providers and with the person’s case manager or 
social worker, if any, to identify needed services, eligibility for those services, and to plan for how 
those services will be provided.  Any service should be provided with a specific goal in mind so that 
the guardian or conservator can monitor and evaluate the service to determine if the service is being 
provided as needed and as agreed.  

hen  planning  services  the  guardian  or  conservator,  in  consultation  with  case  managers/social 

workers, care providers, and family, should monitor and evaluate services to determine: 

that services are consistent with the person’s service or care plan, 

that services are directed to achieve outcomes/goals specifically identified for the person; 

the extent to which providers are fulfilling responsibilities; 

the  extent  to  which  services  are  coordinated  between,  or  by,  the  guardian  or  conservator,  the 
service provider, and the case manager; 

the person’s health and safety needs are being met; 

the person’s civil and legal rights are being protected; 

the consumer and legal representative are satisfied with the services; and 

if changes are needed in the service plan or service delivery.

2.  What  benefits  are  available?    There  are  a  variety  of  benefit  and  entitlement  programs  which  are 
available. These programs are subject to change and the guardian or conservator should check with 
the county social service agency regarding current eligibility requirements for benefit or entitlement 
programs and availability of services.

This information is not legal advice.  It is recommended that an elder law attorney who practices law in 
the area of guardianship and conservatorship be consulted.  It is very important that a lawyer is found 
who  is  familiar  with  these  procedures  to  ensure  that  they  are  followed  correctly.    Otherwise, 
inexperience in this field can be costly both in money and time.  However, an attorney is not required 
and petitioners may proceed pro se. 

rior  to  going  forward  with  plans  to  establish  a  guardianship  or  conservatorship,  a  petitioner  must 
determine, possibly with the help of medical, social service, and/or other professionals or care givers, 
whether or not guardianship or conservatorship is necessary.  (Refer to section, ASSESSING THE NEED 
FOR LEGAL REPRESENTATION).   

  P

There must be cause, or reason, to believe that the person is incapacitated.  It is not sufficient to proceed 
just because a person has a diagnosis which may indicate incapacity.  There must be evidence which 
supports this belief, such as behavior which demonstrates incapacity, and there must be no other less 
restrictive  alternatives  available  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  person.    It  must  be  kept  in  mind  that  the 
individual has the potential and the right to contest any guardianship or conservatorship proceedings. 

1.  How  is  a  Guardian  or  Conservator  appointed?    In  order  to  establish  a  guardianship  or 
conservatorship,  the  proper  procedures  need  to  be  followed.  First  and  foremost,  an  appropriate 
guardian  or  conservator  must  be  found  (refer  to  section,  WHO  MAY  ACT  AS  GUARDIAN  OR 
CONSERVATOR).  A guardian or conservator may be a relative, or other individual or agency.  Once 
a guardian or conservator is found, a petition is made to the court with the appropriate information, 
for example, the reason for guardianship or conservatorship, treating personnel reports (psychiatrist, 
physician and clinical team), and all relevant documentation.  

A petition for appointment of a guardian or conservator is a legal form requesting that the probate 
division  of 
the  district  court  appoint  a  competent  adult  person(s),  or  a  professional 
guardian/conservator to act as guardian or conservator for a person in need of substitute decision 
making.    Any  person  may  file  a  petition  for the appointment of a guardian or conservator for an 
incapacitated individual.  The person filing the petition is called the petitioner.   

 person may petition to have him or herself appointed as guardian or conservator, or to appoint 
another  family  member,  friend,  or  a  professional  guardian  or  conservator, either an agency or an 
individual.  In Minnesota, two or more people may be conservators or guardians of an incapacitated 
individual.  Guardians or conservators are also permitted to live outside of Minnesota, if they are 
able to carry out their powers and duties effectively. 

n incapacitated person, or any person interested in his or her welfare, may petition for a finding of 
incapacity  and  appointment  of  a  conservator.    An  incapacitated  person  may  not  petition  for 
appointment of a guardian/conservator for a person who is incapacitated.

IX.  LEGAL PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS 
 

 

 

A. 

PROCEDURES  TO  ESTABLISH  A GUARDIANSHIP/CONSERVATORSHIP:  In this 
section  the  basic  steps  necessary  for  a  petitioner  to  begin the process of establishing guardianship or 
conservatorship are discussed.  A petitioner may proceed with these actions with an attorney, or pro se, 
meaning without an attorney.  The following information is meant to familiarize either type of petitioner 
with the overall process.  

 

 

 

 

 

2.  What  is  required  in  the  filing  process?    To  file  for  guardianship  or  conservatorship  the 
petitioner must obtain and complete the correct forms, file them at the right place and in the right 
order, and sometimes even use the right color ink to fill them out.   Filing the incorrect forms or 
filing forms incorrectly may significantly delay the process or in some cases stop it altogether.   
It is recommended that the required filing procedures be verified with the court administrator of 

GAC101  State 

ENG 

Rev 8/16

Page 43 of 63 

the probate division of the district court where the petition will be filed.  The staff of the court 
administrator’s  office  can  answer  questions  regarding  proper  filing  procedures  but  cannot,  and 
will not, answer questions requiring legal advice.   

a.  Step 1: Obtain forms: The forms necessary to begin a probate proceeding can be located on the 
state  court  website  (www.mncourts.gov/forms).      The  forms  may  be  accessed  as  Microsoft 
Word or Adobe/PDF files.  The forms are uniform, meaning that same forms may be used: 

1)  To appoint a guardian of the person and conservator of the estate; 
2)  To appoint only a guardian of the person; 
3)  To appoint only a conservator of the estate; 
4)  To provide the annual filings needed for a guardian and/or conservator; 
5)  To allow conservator accounts; and 
6)  To discharge the guardian and/or conservator. 

b.  Step 2: Complete forms: The petitioner must answer and fill out all the questions on the forms 

according to the specifics of the proposed ward’s or protected person’s circumstances.  

.  Step  3:  File  forms:  Once  completed  all  forms  should  be  filed  with  the  court  administrator.  
There is a filing fee which varies from county to county.  Once the petition is filed a court date 
will usually be scheduled for 4-6 weeks later. 

All forms required for guardianship or conservatorship must be filed in the Probate Division at 
the district court in the county where the proposed ward or protected person resides. 

3.  What are the costs of filing?  When and how to file In Forma Pauperis: Since the total fee, 
filing fee plus law library fee, may vary in each County, you should check with the County in which 
you  wish  to  file  for  the  correct  fee.    If  a  petitioner  is  unable  to  file  for  guardianship  or 
conservatorship because he or she cannot afford court costs or attorney fees, they may file for in 
forma pauperis status.  This allows people who have very low income and assets and are in need of 
a guardian or conservator to have the court costs and other associated costs waived.  However, if a 
petitioner wants to apply for in forma pauperis status, he or she must file the additional forms at the 
same time the petition for guardianship or conservatorship is filed.  These forms can be obtained 
from 
state  court  website  at 
www.mncourts.gov/forms.

  A petition for the appointment of a guardian or conservator is completed and filed with the court. 
The petition may be filed by the person to be protected, any person interested in the estate, affairs or 
welfare  of  the  protected  person  such  as  a  parent  or  any  person  adversely  affected  by  improper 
management of the property and affairs of the protected person. 

Each  petition  for  guardianship  or  conservatorship  must  be  written  specifically  for  each  proposed 
ward  or  protected  person.    The  powers  over  that  individual  must  be  backed  up  by  evidence  that 
demonstrates  that  there  is  a  need  for  the  guardianship  or  conservatorship.    Upon  hearing  the 
petition, the court then makes an order to either appoint the guardian or conservator and will grant 
very specific, limited powers based on the petition and the evidence, or may dismiss the petition due 
to lack of evidence proving the need for a guardian or conservator.   

 

In all cases of guardianship and conservatorship the probate courts must only grant powers based on 
that individual’s specific needs. Petitioners should, therefore, be very specific in requesting powers, 
and should petition for all powers only when they are convinced that other less restrictive options is

2.  Step 2:  Complete and file - Notice of Hearing and Notice of Rights and Setting Date for 

Hearing 
When the Petition for Appointment of General Guardianship/Conservatorship is filed, the Notice of 
 Hearing and Notice of Rights must also be filed.  Once these forms are filed, the court will set the 
time and place for the hearing and must order that notice be given of the hearing.  They do this by 
filling in the bottom half of The Notice of Hearing and Notice of Rights form and sending it back to 
the petitioner.  This will show the time and location of the hearing and notifies the proposed ward 
or protected person that they have the right to request an attorney to represent them. 

3.  Step 3:  Complete and Mail.  Notice of hearing and notice of rights  

After  the  court  has  set  the  date  and  time  for  the  hearing  the  petitioner  must  mail  a  copy  of  the 
Notice  of  Hearing  and  Notice  of  Rights,  and  a  copy  of  the  Petition  for  Appointment  of  General 
Guardian/Conservator to all interested parties, including:  any spouse (or person who lived with the 
person for six months or more), parents, adult children, and brothers or sisters of the proposed ward 
or protected person, and other interested persons (see petition and Minnesota Statutes § 524.5-102 
subd. 7).  Notice of the time and place of the hearing is given to the proposed ward or protected 
person and other persons specified by statute. These must be postmarked at least 14 days prior to 
the hearing date. 

f the proposed ward or protected person lives in a residential facility, which includes group homes, 
nursing homes, and state institutions, the petitioner must also mail the notice to the administrator of 
the facility. It is also necessary to send notice to the program administrator if the proposed ward or 
protected person lives in a waivered services residence or in foster care.  If the proposed ward or 
protected  person  is  currently  under  public  guardianship  or  conservatorship  or  guardianship,  it  is 
necessary to send notice to the Commissioner of Human Services. 

4.  Who  is  the  court  visitor  and  what  does  he  or  she  do?  The  Notice  of  Hearing  and  Notice  of 
Rights, along with the Petition for Appointment is given to the proposed ward or protected person at 
least  14  days  before  the  hearing  indicating  that  someone  is  petitioning  for  guardianship  or 
conservatorship.  That means that a “court visitor” or “process server” must personally give a copy 
of the petition and of the Notice of Hearing and Notice of Rights to the proposed ward or protected 
person and read it to him or her.  If the proposed ward or protected person does not receive personal 
service of the notice at least 14 days before the hearing, the proceedings are invalid. 

The court may appoint a visitor who will visit the proposed ward or protected person, give notice of 
hearing  rights,  and  submit  a  report  to  the  court  before  the  hearing,  or  the  court  may  ask  the 
petitioner if they know someone who could serve notice to the proposed ward or protected person.  
Some  probate  courts  have  staff  members  who  will  perform  the  personal  service  on  the  proposed 
ward or protected person.  If the court assigns someone to do this they may assess the petitioner a 
fee.   

he court visitor must explain to the proposed ward or protected person his or her right to contest 
the  petition.  After  the  visit  the  visitor  will  file  a  report  with  the  court  as  to  his  or  her  own 
independent appraisal of the situation.  The court visitor must serve a copy of the report upon the 
petitioner or petitioner’s attorney if represented, at least 5 days prior to the hearing.  This report 
will include a recommendation as to whether guardianship or conservatorship seems necessary.  
If guardianship or conservatorship is recommended then the report will also recommend which 
specific powers that should be granted.  

 

5.  Step 4:  Complete and File - Affidavit of Mailing Notice of Hearing and Notice of Rights 
and Petition:  Prepare an Affidavit of Mailing of the documents above, attach a copy of each of 
the documents to the Affidavit, and file it with the Court.  The court will require an “Affidavit of 
Mailing” to verify that copies of the petition and the hearing notice were sent to all of the proper

people.  

C.  PREPARING FOR THE HEARING: The hearing itself is the same for both conservatorship and 
guardianship and may be very simple unless it is contested by someone.  The petition may be contested 
by any interested person who thinks there is no need for the appointment of a guardian or conservator, 
or that the proposed guardian or conservator will not be able to act in the best interest of the proposed 
ward or protected person, or by the proposed ward or protected person himself or herself.  

1.  Who  must  contact  witnesses  and  gather  evidence?    The  petitioner  must  make  sure  that  all 
witnesses are ready to testify and that all other documentation is filed with the Court.  The rules of 
evidence apply to these hearings.  There is a legal presumption of the capacity of the proposed ward 
or protected person.  The burden of proof is on the petitioner.  The standard of proof is that of clear 
and convincing evidence. 

2.  How  is  evidence  collected  for  the  hearing?  Before  the  hearing  the  petitioner  should  collect 
evidence that will support the need for a guardian or conservator.  This evidence should include 
specific examples of past behaviors of the proposed ward or protected person which will show 
the  incapacities  the  petitioner  is  trying  to  demonstrate.    This  might  include  the  latest 
psychological  report,  any  medical  reports,  current  service  or  care  plans,  and  any  other  current 
assessments.  The petitioner is responsible for getting all of these reports and bringing them to 
the  hearing.    It  is  also  helpful  to  bring  someone  along  who  can  support  the  petitioner’s 
statements, such as a social worker. 

3.  Should  the  proposed  ward  or  protected  person  attend  the  hearing?    The  proposed  ward  or 
protected person must be present at the hearing if he or she is within the state, unless excused by the 
court. It is strongly encouraged that the proposed ward or protected person attend the hearing even 
if there will be little or no comprehension of the proceedings on his or her part, or even if he or she 
waived their right to attend.  This will allow the court to observe his or her responses to questions 
asked of him or her.  

For some individuals, significant behavior problems may be disruptive in the courtroom.  In these 
cases, the proposed ward or protected person should still attend the hearing.  Allowing the Judge to 
observe  the  person  may  help  support  the  petitioner’s  case.    The  courts  are  understanding  of 
disruptive behavior, but families may want to consider waiting outside of the courtroom with the 
proposed ward or protected person until their case is called if such behavior is likely. 

here  may  be  situations  where  medical  conditions  prohibit  attendance  at  the  hearing.    In  these 
cases,  the  petitioner  will  need  to  have  a  physician  fill  out  the  bottom  portion  of  the  Physician’s 
Statement in Support of Guardianship/Conservatorship (and re: Ward’s/Protected Person’s Inability 
to Attend Hearing). 

  T

 

 

4.  Does the proposed ward or protected person have an attorney? A proposed ward or protected 
person has the right to be represented by legal counsel in every new proceeding.  The petitioner 
should contact the attorney for the proposed ward or protected person and attempt to resolve any 
differences. Appointment of an attorney does not necessarily mean that the proceedings will be 
contested,  but  ensures  that  the  proposed  ward’s  or  protected  person’s  interests  are  being 
protected. 

 

D.  THE HEARING:  The court visitor may be asked to testify about his or her personal observations or 

write a report to the court regarding his or her personal observations. 

The petitioner will be asked to state why he or she thinks the individual needs a guardian or conservator. 
At  this  time  they  should  talk  about  the  evidence  they  have  submitted.    The  court  presumes  that  the 
proposed ward or protected person is competent, so it is up to the petitioner to prove that the individual 
is incapacitated.

nce all of the evidence has been heard, there are several potential outcomes: 

•  The  court  may  grant  conservatorship  or  guardianship,  as  requested,  and  the  court  then  enters  an 

Order stating that fact. 

  The court may decide that the person needs less assistance than was requested and may modify the 
petition  to  a  less  restrictive  form.    For  example,  the  court  may  grant  less  powers  than  were 
requested. 

  The court may determine that the individual does not need a conservator or guardian and dismiss 

1.  What  is  a  bond  and  when  is  it  necessary?  A  Bond  is  a  promise  by  a  bonding  Company  that 
protects the protected person from mismanagement by the conservator of the estate. In the event of 
mismanagement, the court may decide that the bonding company will reimburse the estate for the 
missing money, and that Company can recoup the money from the conservator. 

ffective August 1, 2009, the court shall require the conservator to post a bond where the value of 
the personal property of the estate in the initial inventory filed by the conservator is expected to be 
at least $10,000.  The bond requirement applies to conservators appointed after July 31, 2009 and to 
conservatorships reviewed by the court after August 1, 2009. 

If  a  conservator  of  the  estate  was  appointed,  the  court  may  require  a  bond  which  is  equal  to  the 
value of the estate and set by the court.  Each year the conservator must continue to pay the bond 
premium.    Petitioners  can  get  a  bond  from  any  bonding  Company.    No  bond  is  required  for  a 
guardianship of the person only.  

the petition. 

  E

E.  AFTER  THE  HEARING:    After  the  hearing,  the  petitioner  must  prepare  and  file  the  following 

forms with the court: 

1.  Step 1:  Complete and File - Order Appointing General Guardian or Conservator Once 
the hearing is finished, an Order Appointing General Guardian or Conservator should be filled out 
and filed with the court administrator.  The petitioner should fill out only the top portion of the form 
and  the  Findings  of  Fact  section.    The  court  fills  out  the  conclusions  of  law  section.  In  some 
counties it may be necessary for the petitioner to prepare a proposed Order and file it with the court. 
 In other counties, the court will complete and issue the Order on its own.  Check with the Court 
Administrator to see how the court handles the Order. 

2.  Step 2:  Complete and File - Notice of Entry of Order and Right to Appeal 
  At the same time that the Order Appointing General Guardian or Conservator is filed, a Notice of 
Entry of Order and Right to Appeal form must be filled out and filed.  Copies of these two forms 
must then be sent to the ward or protected person and to his or her attorney.  Some courts will do 
this, other courts require the petitioner to do this mailing.  If so, another Affidavit must be filled out 
and filed with the court to show that this was done (see below).   

Although  the  ward  or  protected  person  has  60  days  to  appeal  the  order,  the  guardianship  or 
conservatorship is effective as soon as the proposed guardian or conservator has qualified and the 
court  issues  letters.  If  the  ward  or  protected  person  appeals  the  court  order  within  60  days,  the 
guardian’s or conservator’s powers and duties may be suspended during the appeal process. 

.  Step  3:    Complete  and  File  -  Acceptance  of  Appointment  by  Corporation/Individual 

and Initial Informational Statement 

  At  this  point  the  petitioner  will  need  to  fill  out  an  “Acceptance  of  Appointment”  form,  have  it 
notarized, and file it with the court administrator.  This qualifies the newly appointed guardian or 
conservator to act as guardian or conservator.  The form asks the guardian or conservator to swear 
that he or she will faithfully perform his or her duties.

Page 47 of 63 

Before  the  initial  appointment,  the  proposed  guardian  /  conservator  must  file  an  informational 
statement  with  the  court.    The  statement  must  be  a  sworn  affidavit  that  contains  information 
regarding  the  proposed  guardian’s  /  conservator’s  status  and  capacity  to  serve  as  a  guardian  / 
conservator.    

.  Step 4:  Request - Letters of General Guardianship/Conservatorship 
  A  “Letters  of  Guardianship  or  Conservatorship”  form  must  also  be  filed  and  completed  by  the 
court.  The petitioner must specifically request and pay for a certified copy of the signed form from 
the  court  administrator’s  office  or  they  will  not  receive  one.    The  letters  are  the  guardian’s  or 
conservator’s  proof  of  authority  to  act  on  behalf  of  the  ward  or  protected  person.    It  may  be 
necessary that the guardian or conservator purchase extra certified copies of the letters. 

.  Step 5:  Complete and File  - Inventory 

If  a  conservator  of  the  estate  is  appointed,  he  or  she  must  complete  and  file  with  the  court  an 
“Inventory” form within 60 days of being appointed.   

F.  ANNUALLY AFTER THE HEARING:  After a person is appointed as guardian or conservator 
he  or  she  will  be  required  to  file  with  the  court  additional  forms  every  year:  a  Personal  Well-being 
Report  (only  filed  by  guardian  of  the  person);  an  Annual  Account  (only  filed  by  conservator  of  the 
estate); and the Annual Notice of Right to Petition.  These forms must be filed within thirty days of the 
anniversary of the date that guardianship or conservatorship was appointed.  The anniversary date is the 
date  the  Letters  of  Appointment  are  signed  and  dated  by  the  judge.    If  an  annual  report  is  not  filed 
within 60 days of the required date, the court shall issue an order to show cause. 

1.  What is the Personal Well-being Report?  The Personal Well-being Report is filed so that the 
court can remain informed about changes in the ward’s residence, medical condition, and mental 
or  emotional  condition,  and  any  changes  in  the  guardian’s  status  and  capacity  to  serve  as  a 
guardian,  and  reports  any  reimbursements  for  services  rendered  in  the  past  year  that  were  not 
reimbursed by county contract.  This form must be served on the ward and interested persons of 
record with the court. 

.  What  is  the  annual  and  final  account?    It  is  required  that  the  courts  review  and  accept  the 
accounts on a regular basis in a court hearing.  The frequency of these reviews is determined by 
court  rules  as  well  as  the  court  in  each  county.    This  form  is  an  accounting  of  the  protected 
person’s estate. The Annual Account form is only required when a conservator of the estate has 
been appointed. This form shows the court how the protected person’s assets have been handled, 
and  provides  information  on  any  changes  in  the  conservator’s  status  and  capacity  to  serve  as  a 
conservator,  and  reports  any  reimbursements  for  services  rendered  in  the  past  year  that  were  not 
reimbursed  by  county  contract.  The  form  must  be  filed  with  the  court  within  30  days  from  the 
anniversary  date  of  the  appointment  of  the  conservator.    The  anniversary  date  is  the  date  the 
Letters of Appointment are signed and dated by the judge. 

3.  What is the annual notice of right to petition and affidavit of service?  The Annual Notice of 
Right to Petition must be filled out by the guardian or conservator and sent to the ward or protected 
person and interested persons of record with the court. This notice informs the ward or protected 
person and interested persons of record with the court of the right to petition the court to request a 
hearing to modify or terminate the guardianship or conservatorship.   

 

 
G.  MODIFICATIONS AND TERMINATION OF GUARDIANSHIP/CONSERVATORSHIP 

1.  What is a modification of guardianship or conservatorship?  If a person no longer needs the 
complete supervision and protection of a guardian or conservator, but still needs some assistance 
with decision-making, it is possible to modify a guardianship to a conservatorship, or to modify the 
powers a guardian or conservator holds to allow the protected person to make more decisions.

Page 48 of 63 

The process for modification of the powers of a guardian or conservator is similar to the process for 
establishing a conservatorship or guardianship.  A Petition for Modification is filed with the court.  
A  hearing  date  is  set  and  notice  of  the  hearing  is  given  to  all  interested  persons  by  petitioner.  
Evidence is given at the hearing showing that the person has functional capacity in specific areas 
and that the right to make decisions in those areas should be restored to the individual.  The court 
will make an appropriate order. 

It  is  also  possible  that  a  guardian/conservator  may  need  to  get  more  powers  from  the  court  than 
when the guardianship/conservatorship was originally established.  This is also handled through the 
modification procedure described above. 

.  When  does  Guardianship  or  Conservatorship  terminate?    A  guardianship  or  conservatorship 
terminates upon the death of the ward/protected person, upon a determination of incapacity of the 
guardian/conservator, upon removal or resignation of the guardian/conservator, or upon restoration 
of capacity of the ward/protected person. 

•  On petition of the ward or protected person, or any person interested in the ward’s or protected 
person’s welfare, the court may remove a guardian or conservator and appoint a successor if it 
is in the best interests of the ward or protected person. 

  On petition of the guardian or conservator, the court may accept the guardian’s or conservator’s 

resignation. 

a.  Restoration to Capacity.  Anyone who is under guardianship or conservatorship but feels that 
guardianship or conservatorship is no longer necessary, or any interested person who believes 
that  an  individual  no  longer  needs  to  be  under  guardianship  or  conservatorship,  may  file  a 
petition  in  court  to  terminate  or  modify  the  guardianship  or  conservatorship  and  have  the 
individual restored to capacity. This means that all of the rights which had been removed from 
the individual under the court order appointing a guardian or conservator are given back to the 
individual and the individual is no longer considered to be incapacitated. 

The process for restoring an individual to capacity is similar to the process for establishing a 
guardianship or conservatorship.  A Petition for Termination of Guardianship / Conservatorship 
and to Dismiss Guardian / Conservator is filed with the court. A hearing date is set and notice 
of the hearing is given to all interested persons.  Evidence is given at the hearing showing that 
the person now has the functional ability to handle their personal care and/or manage property.   

It is not necessary for an individual to have gained total control of all functions.  Evidence must 
be given at the hearing showing that the person now has the functional ability to handle their 
personal care and/or manage property.  The statute provides that a person who still has some 
mental impairment may be restored to capacity if there is functional ability; that is, if he or she 
is  able  to  care  for  self  or  property  despite  the  mental  impairment,  or  if  less  restrictive 
alternatives make the current guardianship powers unneccesary. 

 

.  Death of the Ward or Protected Person.  When a ward or protected person dies the guardian or 
conservator  no  longer  has  authority.    However,  it  does  not  relieve  the  conservator  from  the 
liability of accounting for their actions, nor does it relieve him or her of the obligation to file a 
final account with the court of the disposition of the assets of the protected person’s estate.  The 
conservator  must  file  a  final  accounting  and  ask  the  court  to  set  the  account  for  hearing  and 
discharge. 

c.  Successor Guardian or Conservator. If a guardian or conservator dies, resigns or is removed, 
and the ward or  protected person is still in need of a guardian or conservator, the court must 
appoint  a  successor  guardian  or  conservator.    This  is  true  even  if  another  family  member  is 
listed as the preferred guardian or conservator in a living will.

Filing Fees:  At the time of initial filing of the Petition to establish a guardianship/conservatorship 
you will be required to pay a filing fee.  Check with the County that you are filing the petition in for 
their current fee schedule. 

Copies  of  documents:    Copies  of  documents  filed  with  the  Court  can  be  obtained  upon  request.  
Check with the County you filed the Petition in for their current fee schedule. 

B.  HOW TO PAY GUARDIAN OR CONSERVATOR, AND ATTORNEY FEES:  Minnesota 
Statutes section 524.5-502 sets forth the authority for compensation for services rendered on behalf of the 
ward or protected person.  A lawyer or health professional rendering necessary services related to 
the appointment of a guardian or conservator, the administration of the protected person’s estate 
or  personal  affairs,  or  the  restoration  of  that  person’s  capacity  or  termination  of  the  protective 
proceedings  shall  be  entitled  to  compensation  from  the  protected  person’s  estate  or  from  the 
county having jurisdiction over the proceedings if the ward or protected person is indigent.    

The  court  may  order  payment  of  reasonable  fees  to  be  paid  from  the  estate  of  the  ward  or  protected 
person,  or  from  the  county  having  jurisdiction  over  the  proceedings  if  the  ward  or  protected  person is 
indigent, to the guardian or conservator when he or she has rendered necessary services or has incurred 
necessary expenses for the benefit of the ward or protected person. 

A guardian or conservator may petition the court for reimbursement or reasonable compensation when he 
or she was nominated by the court or by the county adult protection unit because no suitable relative or 
other person was available to provide guardianship or conservatorship services necessary to prevent abuse 
or neglect of a vulnerable adult as defined in the Vulnerable Adult Act. 

n order to receive an award of fees by the court under this statute, it is necessary to prove, and the court 
must make, the following findings of fact; 

the person is legally appointed the guardian of the person or conservator of the estate, or of both;  

the services rendered or expenses incurred are necessary; 

the services rendered or expenses incurred are for the benefit of the ward or protected person; and 

reimbursement  of  expenses  must  be  actual  amounts  incurred;  compensation  for  services  rendered 
(fees) must be reasonable. 

1.  For Ward’s or Protected Person’s with assets:  If the ward or protected person has assets, the court 
may  order  reimbursement  or  compensation  to  be  paid  for  out  of  the  ward’s  or  protected  person’s 
estate.  This is generally accomplished by including the amount of fees paid and expenses reimbursed 
on the annual account, and requesting that the court approve the account.  It is generally not necessary 
to file a separate petition with the court for approval of fees.   

.  For Ward’s or Protected Person’s who are indigent:  If the ward or protected person is indigent, 
the court may order reimbursement or reasonable compensation from the county having jurisdiction 
over the guardianship or conservatorship.  In this case, in addition to the four findings above, the court 
must  make  a  fifth  finding  that  the  ward  or  protected  person  is  indigent.    Generally,  a  person  is

considered  indigent  when  the  standard  for  proceeding  in  forma  pauperis  is  met.    This  standard  is 
outlined in Minnesota Statutes section 563.01, subdivision 3, and includes, but is not limited to: 

  A ward or protected person who is receiving public assistance. 

  A ward or protected person who is represented by an attorney on behalf of a civil legal services 

program or a volunteer attorney program based on indigency. 

  A ward or protected person whose annual income is not greater than 125 percent of the poverty 

line established under United States Code, title 42, section 9902(2). 

 

C.  WHAT  ARE  THE  PROCEDURES  FOR  COLLECTING  GUARDIANSHIP  OR 

CONSERVATORSHIP FEES? 

•  Regardless  of  whether  or  not  the  ward  or  protected  person  has  assets,  the  guardian  or  conservator 
must  keep  an  accurate  record  of  the  services  performed  for  the  benefit  of  the  ward  or  protected 
person.  A log should be kept which tracks the date of service, service performed, and the amount of 
time spent. 

If the ward or  protected person is an indigent person, in forma pauperis status should be requested 
from  the  probate  court  (discussed  in  section  D).    This  is  accomplished  by  filing  a  Petition  and 
Affidavit to Proceed In Forma Pauperis, and a proposed Order Granting In Forma Pauperis.   

Once  In  Forma  Pauperis  status  is  granted,  court  costs  or  fees  concerned  with  the  guardianship  or 
conservatorship will be waived.  This includes initial filing fees, service of process fees, and costs of 
certified copies of Letters or other documents.  This can be done when establishing the guardianship 
or conservatorship, or at any time during the course of the guardianship or conservatorship if the ward 
or protected person becomes indigent at a later date. 

If  the  ward  or  protected  person  is  an  indigent  person  and  resides  in  an  institution,  the  guardian  or 
conservator should consult the county financial worker to ask that guardian’s or conservator’s fees be 
included in the determination of monthly reductions of five percent of income.  The financial worker 
does not automatically do this; it must be requested.  This payment is deducted from the gross income 
on  the  calculation  sheet,  which  is  sent  to  the  institution.    It  is  the  guardian’s  or  conservator’s 
responsibility to actually collect the fees. 

If the ward or protected person has assets, the guardian or conservator of the estate may pay him or 
herself a reasonable fee out of the assets.  Reasonability will be factored upon the difficulty of the 
case, the experience of the ward or conservator, and the going rate for services in the area.  Different 
counties  have  different  standards  to  determine  reasonability.    Remember  that  the  amount  of  the 
guardian  or  conservator  compensation  will  be  reported  on  the  annual  account,  that  at  a  hearing  to 
allow  the  annual  account  any  interested  person  has  the  right  to  contest  the  reasonability  of  the 
guardian or conservator fees, and the judge is the final arbiter. 

Contact the court administrator for the court’s procedures on filing. 

.  Must  the  Court  Order  the  Payment  of  Fees?    The  short  answer  is,  no.    The  language  of 
Minnesota Statutes section 524.5-502 states that the court may order reimbursement or reasonable 
compensation.  This is a discretionary decision on the part of the court, not mandatory.  There is a 
great difference around the state as to how counties respond to this language.   

Some counties have now requested input at the initiation of the guardianship or conservatorship.  
If  the  county  is  going  to  be  the  responsible  party  for  payment  of  the  fees,  they  are  entitled  to 
notice  of  the  initial  hearing  to  establish  whether  a  guardianship  or  conservatorship  is  really

necessary,  that  is,  that  there  are  no  less  restrictive  alternatives  available  which  will  meet  the 
proposed  ward’s  or  protected  person’s    needs.    Some  county  adult  protection  units  have 
developed “screening teams” in order to screen out petitions where such services are not really 
necessary. 
 

2.  What  if  Fees  are  Very  High?    If  the  expenses  incurred  or  compensation  amount  is 
extraordinarily high, it is possible to ask the court for an order allowing the fees.  An ex parte 
petition (a petition filed with the court without a hearing) is usually sufficient.  If there is some 
concern  that  the  county  or  some  other  interested  person  may  have  an interest in contesting the 
fees, it is also possible to ask for a hearing on the petition, giving the interested parties notice of 
the  hearing  and  an  opportunity  to  be  heard  concerning  the  reasonability  or  necessity  of  the 
compensation. 

 

 

D.  FILING IN FORMA PAUPERIS: 

1.  What will In Forma Pauperis status pay for?  In Forma Pauperis status not only excuses payment 
of  attorney,  health  professional  fees  incurred  in  order  to  establish  or  maintain  a  guardianship  or 
conservatorship, and the related court filing fees, but also includes costs for service of process upon 
the proposed ward or  protected person, for costs of certified copies of forms, and photocopy costs.  
These costs are then absorbed by the court system. 

.  What  if  the  Petitioner  will  not  be  using  an  attorney?    If  a  petitioner  wants  to  proceed  with  a 
guardianship or conservatorship pro se, that is, without using an attorney, or if he or she wants to use 
a private attorney, and in either case cannot afford court costs, the Petitioner may complete and file 
the  Petition  and  Affidavit  for  Proceeding  In  Forma  Pauperis  on  behalf  of  the  ward  or  protected 
person. The Petitioner will list the income and asset information of the ward or protected person on 
the Petition and Affidavit for In Forma Pauperis. 

.  What forms are needed?  To petition for In Forma Pauperis, there are two forms that must be filed 
at the same time the petitioner files for guardianship or conservatorship (see court forms IFP401 and 
IFP402 under court form category Fee Waiver / In Forma Pauperis or as a packet under court form 
category Guardianship / Conservatorship).  These forms can be obtained at the Court Administration 
Office or online at www.mncourts.gov/forms.  

i.  Petition and Affidavit for Proceeding In Forma Pauperis.  The Petition and Affidavit is signed by 

the petitioner in front of a notary public. 

i.  Order For Proceeding In Forma Pauperis.  The Order is filled out by the petitioner’s attorney, or 

by the petitioner if proceeding pro se, except for signature by the Judge hearing the case.
