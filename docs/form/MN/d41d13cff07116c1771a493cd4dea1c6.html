hat is a Harassment Restraining Order? 

A person who is a victim of harassment may seek a restraining order from the Court. The parent or 
guardian of a minor who is the victim of harassment may seek a restraining order on behalf of the minor.  
The restraining order prohibits harassment.  A restraining order may be issued against an individual who 
has engaged in harassment, or against organizations that have sponsored or promoted harassment.

What is Harassment? 
Under Minn. Stat. § 609.748, harassment is defined as: 

1. A single incident of  

a.  physical or sexual assault, or 

b.  stalking in which the victim’s personal information is used by another without consent of the 
victim, to invite, encourage, or solicit a third party to engage in a sexual act with the victim 
[See Minn. Stat. § 609.749, subd. 2 clause (8)], or 

c. 

intentionally disseminating a private image of the victim, without consent of the victim, that 
shows the victim in a sexual act or whose intimate parts are exposed, in whole or in part, and 
the victim is identifiable by the victim or by another person or from personal information 
displayed in connection with the image.  (See Minn. Stat. § 617.261). 

2. Repeated incidents of intrusive or unwanted acts, words or gestures that have a substantial adverse 
effect or are intended to have a substantial adverse effect on the safety, security or privacy of 
another, regardless of the relationship between the victim and the alleged harasser. 

3. Targeted residential picketing, which includes: 

a.  marching, standing, or patrolling by one or more persons directed solely at a particular 

residential building in a manner that adversely affects the safety, security, or privacy of an 
occupant of the building, or

b.  marching, standing, or patrolling by one or more persons which prevents an occupant of a 
residential building from gaining access to or exiting from the property on which the 
residential building is located. 

       4. A pattern of attending public events after being notified that one’s presence is harassing to another. 

Change of Address: 
It is important that the court knows your mailing address to send you notices.  If your mailing address 
changes, give court administration (http://mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx) your new mailing address. 

Hearing: 
If a temporary restraining order has been issued, you have the right to ask for a hearing.  You have 20 
days from the date the petition is served to file a Request for Hearing with the court.  You will be required 
to pay a civil filing fee unless the judicial officer has waived the filing fee due to the allegations in the 
petition. Review the Order Regarding Fee Waiver in Harassment Restraining Order Proceedings to see if 
the filing fee has been waived. 

 

If the judicial officer did not order your filing fee waived, you may complete and file a fee waiver 
application (Affidavit for Proceeding In Forma Pauperis, IFP102) that would be reviewed by a judicial 
officer who would determine whether to waive your filing fee based on your income.  Fee waiver forms 
are available from the court administrator and online (http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=19&p=69). 
The court will notify the parties with a date and time to appear for a hearing.   

Violations: 
You may be charged with a misdemeanor, subject to a sentence of up to 90 days in jail and/or a fine of 
$1,000.00, if you are aware of the existence of a restraining order and you violate it.  Some repeat 
violations are gross misdemeanors that may result in a sentence of up to one year in jail and/or a 
$3,000.00 fine.  Other violations are felonies that may result in a sentence of imprisonment for up to five 
years and/or a fine of $10,000.00.   

You may be arrested and taken into custody without warrant if a peace officer has probable cause to 
believe you are in violations of the restraining order.  You will be held in jail for at least 36 hours, 
excluding the day of arrest, Sundays, and legal holidays, unless you are released earlier by a judicial 
officer.  Violation of the restraining order also constitutes contempt of court.  See Minn. Stat. § 609.748, 
subd. 6 (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.748#stat.609.748.6).

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
