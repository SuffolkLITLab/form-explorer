IMPORTANT NOTICES 

 

 

  WARNING: You CANNOT use these forms unless there is already a court order giving you or 
the  other  party  parenting  time  rights.  If  you  do  not  have  such  an  order,  but  you  do  have  a 
Recognition of Parentage or a paternity order, then you might be able to use the “Establishing 
Custody and Parenting Time” packet of forms to bring your parenting time issues before the 
court. 

  The court expects every person who appears in court without an attorney to know and follow the law. 

The judge will not be able to give you any help in court. 

  Court personnel and the County Attorney’s office CANNOT help you fill out these forms.  

  You MUST fill out all forms, and you MUST follow these instructions.  

  You should see an attorney if you do not know how to answer the questions on these forms, or if you 
think the other party will hire an attorney.  Information about finding an attorney is available online 
at http://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx.  

  Type your answers or print neatly using dark ink.

each question that the other party checked.

time.  Check box 1(b) if you want the court to deny the other party’s request.

other party to reach an  agreement between  yourselves  regarding the problem. However, if you and 
the other party are not able to resolve the problem yourselves, then a parenting time expeditor will

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
