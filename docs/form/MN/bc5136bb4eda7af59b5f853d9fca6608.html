Introduction 

This booklet is for parties representing themselves and preparing for trial  in a civil  case. 

Trials are complicated, but this booklet is meant to make them more understandable.  

Most civil  trials do not involve a jury. Instead, a judicial  officer decides the case. A jury is 

used only if a jury is allowed for that type of case, a party requests a jury, and that party pays 

the jury fee. This booklet does not cover issues related to juries.  

In addition to reading this booklet, you are encouraged to: 

•  Watch a trial.  Most trials  are open to the public.  

•  Get advice from a lawyer. You can find information about free legal  advice clinics, 

hiring  a lawyer, and other options for legal advice on our Find a Lawyer Help Topic 

(mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx). 

•  Go to a law library (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Law-Libraries.aspx). 

•  Review the Civil Actions Help Topic (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Civil-Actions.aspx). 

•  Contact  a Self-Help Center (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Self-Help-Centers.aspx). 

Communicating with Court Staff and Judicial Officers 

It is important that you communicate with court staff and judicial officers appropriately.  

Court staff are ready to help you in whatever way they can.  Their role is to provide you with 

information, not legal advice.  For specific information about what court staff can and cannot 

do, visit the What Court Staff Can and Cannot Do for You Help Topic  (mncourts.gov/Help-

Topics/What-Staff-Can-Do.aspx). 

“Ex parte” is a Latin phrase meaning “on one side only; by or for one party.” An ex 

parte communication  is when a party to a case, or someone involved with a party, talks or 

writes to or otherwise communicates directly with the judicial  officer about the issues in the 

case without the other parties’ knowledge.  Judicial officers cannot consider ex parte 

communications in deciding a case unless expressly allowed by law. This helps judicial  officers 

decide cases fairly since their decisions are based only on the evidence and arguments 

presented to the court and the applicable law. The rule ensures that the court process is fair 

and that all parties have the same information as the judicial  officer who will be deciding the 

case.

Please be respectful when communicating  with court staff and judicial  officers. 

Phases of a Civil Case 

While there is really no such thing as a “typical”  case, many civil lawsuits will  include the 

phases listed below. This booklet will  cover only the Pretrial phase and the Trial  phase in detail. 

Many other hearings may happen before the trial  or instead of a trial. A trial is not the same as 

a motion hearing. This booklet does not explain what happens at other court hearings.    Carefully 

read all  orders and letters from the court to understand what is expected at each hearing. If 

you have questions, contact  a Self-Help Center (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Self-Help-

Centers.aspx). 

• 

Initial phase: In this phase, the plaintiff serves paperwork ("Summons” and 

“Complaint") to start the court case, and the other party or parties, called the 

defendant, serves a response ("Answer"). The Complaint makes legal claims  against 

the defendant and states the facts and reasons why the plaintiff should get what 

they are asking for in the case. The defendant may also bring claims of their own 

(“counterclaims”) against the plaintiff. 

•  Discovery phase: During this phase, the parties exchange information and learn 

about the strengths and weaknesses of the other side's case. Discovery can be done 

formally or informally.  It may include many different methods, such as email 

requests, interrogatories, requests for production of documents, depositions, and 

requests for admission. 

•  Pretrial phase: In this phase, the parties start getting ready for trial. They get their 

evidence and witnesses in order, and they may file motions with the court to resolve 

the case or narrow the issues for trial. This is also when the parties may try to settle 

the case. In some cases, the court may order that the parties try Alternative Dispute 

Resolution (ADR). These settlement efforts may happen at any point in the case.   

•  Trial phase: During  this phase, the case is heard by the judicial  officer (or a jury). This 

could last for a couple of hours or a couple of months, depending on the case’s 

complexity. Parties present their evidence, including witnesses and exhibits, and the 

judicial  officer decides the case and issues an order.

•  Post-trial phase: During this phase, one or both of the parties might appeal the 

judgment from trial,  or the winning party might try to collect the judgment.  

Settlement 

Many cases settle before the trial  day or even on the day of trial. “Settle” means that 

the parties involved reach an agreement and the judicial  officer approves the agreement. You 

may be asked many times, at different parts of the case, to try to settle your dispute. The 

judicial  officer may require all parties to meet or to attend a form of ADR, such as mediation, to 

try to reach a settlement before the trial starts.  

The judicial  officer may also schedule a “Pretrial Conference” to talk with the parties 

about the trial  issues and evidence and take steps to speed up the actual trial.  You should 

attend the Pretrial Conference prepared to offer a solution to settle the case and to consider 

settlement offers from the other side. Each time you have a hearing, including at the trial, you 

can expect the judicial officer to ask you and the other party what you have done to try to 

settle the case. 

As part of the pretrial  work, you and the other side might create a list of facts you agree 

on. This is referred to as “Stipulated Facts.” Agreeing that certain things are true will shorten 

the time it takes to try the case and can help limit  the number of witnesses needed. 

A settlement allows the parties to find creative solutions that fit their needs and allows 

parties to have a “known” result in their case. Going to trial  means the judicial  officer or jury 

decides the outcome of the case instead of the parties. If you and the other party reach an 

agreement before the trial, call  your judicial  officer’s clerk right away.  

•  Review the Settle Out of Court Help Topic (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Settle-Out-of-

Court.aspx) or the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Help Topic 

(mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/AlternativeDisputeResolution.aspx) for more 

information. 

Role of the Judicial Officer (Judge or Referee) 

The judicial officer’s role is to oversee the trial, and make sure that both sides have an 

opportunity to be heard as the rules of procedure and evidence allow. In a civil  trial  without a 

jury, the judicial  officer also decides if the plaintiff has proven their case, and what the award or

outcome will be. The judicial  officer and their staff can give you general guidance, but if you are 

representing yourself, you need to decide what topics to cover, what evidence is important, 

and what questions to ask of witnesses. 

The judicial officer must be neutral.  In other words, the judicial  officer must be fair to 

both sides. They may ask a question of a witness to clarify something, but they generally will 

not take over and ask all  questions they think are important. It is your case, and you decide 

what you want the judicial  officer to hear and see. 

Rules of Evidence and Rules of Civil Procedure 

The judicial  officer will conduct the trial  using the MN Rules of Civil  Procedure 

(revisor.mn.gov/court_rules/cp/), the MN Rules of Evidence 

(revisor.mn.gov/court_rules/rule/ev-toh/), and the MN General Rules of Practice 

(revisor.mn.gov/court_rules/gp). Law libraries  (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Law-Libraries.aspx) 

also have books that explain more about the rules and include parts of court cases that have 

interpreted the rules (case law). 

No one can predict exactly which rules will  come into play, but some of the rules that 

most frequently apply are discussed below. The judicial officer is required to follow these rules, 

and so are you and all other trial participants. 

The basic idea of the MN Rules of Evidence is to make sure that the evidence is 

trustworthy. It would be unfair to everyone if the judicial  officer relied on questionable 

evidence when deciding the case. In most trials,  testimony from witnesses is used as evidence. 

The witness takes an oath and promises to tell the truth, and because the witness is present, 

they can be asked questions (“cross-examined”) by the other side. The “hearsay” rule of 

evidence requires that the person who made a statement be present at the trial  to testify. 

Generally, you can’t testify about what someone else told you. There are important exceptions 

to this rule spelled out in the MN Rules of Evidence (see Article 8 – Hearsay). 

Rule 901  of the MN Rules of Evidence addresses what is needed for a document, a 

photograph, telephone and computer record, or a physical object to be reliable and allowed as 

evidence. Usually, for evidence of this type to be admitted (meaning allowed to be considered 

in court), you need a witness to explain how the document or information was created and to

CIV201          State       Eng           Rev  8/22                       www.mncourts.gov/forms

testify that the information really is what it appears to be (that it is authentic). You must ask the 

witness questions to “lay a foundation.”  This means that your questions should allow the 

witness to cover what the item is, who created it, and when, where, and why it was created. 

Some documents can be admitted into evidence without a witness, such as a certified copy of a 

public record (see Rule 902  of the MN Rules of Evidence). If the judicial  officer admits the item 

into evidence, it becomes part of the trial record. 

Another important concept in the MN Rules of Evidence is relevancy (see Article 4 – 

Relevancy and Its Limits). If evidence is not relevant to the case, the judicial  officer will 

generally not allow  it.  Relevant evidence helps the judicial officer decide if your story is true. If 

evidence is not relevant to the case, it is generally not allowed. If your witness is testifying and 

you hear something like, “Objection your honor, that testimony is irrelevant,” you need to be 

able to explain why what the witness is saying is important in helping the judicial  officer decide 

the case. If the judicial  officer decides that the questions being asked will help them make a 

decision, they will say something like, “Objection overruled. Witness, you may continue 

answering the question.” If the judicial officer “sustains” the objection, the witness cannot 

answer the question. 

Even relevant evidence may be kept out in some situations. A judicial officer may not 

allow evidence if it is repetitive and slowing down the trial.  For example, a judicial  officer may 

allow 1 or 2 photos showing the condition of a roof, but not allow 20  photos showing basically 

the same thing. 

Witnesses 

date. 

You are responsible for making sure your witnesses appear for the trial.  Plan ahead. The 

judicial  officer will not reschedule the trial  to let you arrange for witnesses you could have 

contacted earlier. You should contact your witnesses as soon as the court schedules your trial 

Witnesses must be available  the day of the trial. Some witnesses may not be allowed to 

testify. They must be able to offer admissible evidence, which means that a witness must have 

first-hand knowledge of what they are going to testify about. For example: 

1.  Your witness, Mary, testifies that the blue truck ran a red light.  

What to Expect as a Self-Represented  Plaintiff or Defendant in a Civil Trial (without a Jury) 
 
CIV201          State       Eng           Rev  8/22                       www.mncourts.gov/forms

2.  An objection is made because of lack  of personal knowledge.  

3.  You then ask Mary how she knows the blue truck ran the red light.  

o 

o 

If Mary says something like, “My friend was there and told me 

about it,” Mary’s statement will  not be allowed into evidence 

because she does not have first-hand knowledge.  

If Mary saw the truck run the light, she has firsthand knowledge. 

Even if the testimony is admissible, if multiple witnesses are repeating the same 

information, the judicial  officer may not allow  them all  to testify due to time concerns. 

Sometimes a party will  call  an “expert witness” to testify in the case. An expert is 

someone with scientific, technical, or other special knowledge about a certain topic (for 

example, a roofing contractor, medical doctor, engineer, chemist, etc.). Experts often testify to 

give their professional opinion about a fact of the case, such as the speed of impact of a car 

crash or the side effects of using a prescription drug. Rule 702  of the MN Rules of Evidence 

requires that reliability  of the expert’s testimony be established. To do that, you must “lay the 

foundation” of the expert’s qualifications on the topic by asking questions about their 

education and professional experience. As with all  evidence, the expert’s testimony is also 

subject to the hearsay rule and other MN Rules of Evidence. 

Subpoenas and Witness Fees 

The only way to try to guarantee that a witness will  come to court to testify or bring 

documents to court is to use a subpoena. A subpoena is a court order telling someone to 

appear in court and/or produce documents or records.  If you need to subpoena a witness, 

review Rule 45 of the MN Rules of Civil  Procedure. If your witness agrees to come to court, you 

do not need a subpoena. If you need to subpoena a witness, do so as soon as possible. 

To get a subpoena, you need to request it from court administration in the county 

where your case is filed and pay a small fee for each subpoena). Court administration  will 

prepare the subpoena. Next, you will  need to arrange for someone else (not you) who is 18 

years or older to serve the subpoena on the witness, along with the witness fee (you will need 

to pay the witness fee). 

As explained on the subpoena form, if you subpoena a witness, you will  need to pay that

witness $20  per day, plus mileage, if applicable. The fee for mileage is set by law and is stated in 

Minn. Stat. § 357.22  (revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/357.22). Some           witnesses served with a 

subpoena may also be entitled to reasonable compensation for their time, in addition to 

mileage and the $20  witness fee. Review the Subpoenas Help Topic (mncourts.gov/Help-

Topics/Subpoenas.aspx) and Rule 45  of the MN Rules of Civil  Procedure 

(revisor.mn.gov/court_rules/cp/id/45/) for more information about subpoenas.  

If you have an order waiving the court filing  fees (called a “Fee Waiver” or “In Forma 

Pauperis”), and you cannot afford to pay the witness fees, you can ask the court to pay the 

witness fees for you. To do this, fill  out a Supplemental Affidavit for Proceeding In Forma 

Pauperis and file it with court administration.  A judicial  officer will decide who pays the witness 

fees - you or the court. Review the Fee Waiver Help Topic  (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Fee-

Waiver-IFP.aspx) for more information.   

Witness fees and mileage apply only to witnesses who are subpoenaed. To put  

it simply: 

Preparing Evidence 

•  SUBPOENA: You DO have to pay witness fees and mileage. 

•  NO SUBPOENA: You DO NOT have to pay witness fees and mileage. 

Evidence includes witness testimony, your testimony, and documents, pictures, or other 

objects. Documents, pictures and other objects are called  “exhibits.”  Generally, evidence, 

including  exhibits, must be presented the day of trial.  Evidence cannot be submitted after the 

trial (except by order of the judicial  officer in some unusual situations). Judicial  officers often 

send the parties a “Scheduling Order” requiring them to exchange “Exhibit Lists” and “Witness 

Lists” by a certain date. The judicial officer may also require the parties to show each other 

their exhibits before the day of trial.  This allows both sides to better prepare for trial. 

The judicial  officer cannot investigate or gather evidence. It is your responsibility to have 

all the evidence available  and present it during trial. 

You will  generally not be allowed to use your phone to present evidence (for example, 

showing the judicial  officer text messages or pictures on your phone).  You need to be prepared 

ahead of time to present any evidence in the proper format.

Review the Exhibits Help Topic  (www.mncourts.gov/MNDES) for more information 

about how to present your evidence, including information about MNDES, the MN Digital 

Exhibit System used in the MN Judicial  Branch.  

Marking Exhibits 

At the trial, each party’s exhibits will need to be “marked.” Exhibits are marked by 

placing  a sticker on the document or object with consecutive numbers (for example, “Exhibit 1,” 

“Exhibit 2,” “Exhibit 3,” etc.). Sometimes, exhibits are marked before the trial day. Some judicial 

officers prefer that the court clerk or court reporter mark the exhibit when it is offered at trial. 

Sometimes the judicial  officer or their clerk will  assign exhibit numbers for each party to use. 

Check the Scheduling Order or connect with the clerk to see if the judicial officer has a 

preference.  

Exhibit and  Witness  Lists 

Even if the judicial  officer does not order them to be exchanged before the trial, it is a 

good idea to create Exhibit and Witness Lists. The Exhibit List is a listing  of all the documents 

and objects you plan to offer into evidence at the trial.  A Witness List is a listing  of all the 

witnesses you plan to have testify at the trial. You can find Exhibit and Witness List forms at 

www.mncourts.gov/forms in the Civil category. 

Creating a list will  help you organize your case before the trial, and during the trial  you 

can check the list to help avoid forgetting anything. As mentioned above, the judicial  officer 

may also require you to give an Exhibit and/or Witness List to the other side before the trial.   

Trials  will generally be held in-person. Keep in mind that if your trial  is held remotely, 

different requirements for exhibits may apply. On the day of an in-person trial  (or before, if 

ordered to do so earlier), you must have the original  document or object, and at least 3 copies 

of any documents. One copy is for the judicial  officer, one copy is for you, and one copy is for 

the other party (you will need more copies if there are additional parties). During the trial, the 

witness will be looking at the original  document, and the original  will be offered into evidence, 

but you need to have copies available for all  parties to look at while the witness is testifying. If 

the judicial officer admits (accepts) the document into evidence, it becomes part of the trial 

record.

Attorneys often create what is called a “trial  notebook,” and you can too. This helps you 

organize all  the parts of your case (Opening Statement, Witness List, Exhibit List, copies of 

exhibits, questions you plan to ask each witness, Final Argument, etc.). Before creating your 

trial  notebook, think about what you need to prove. A two-column chart can be helpful. On the 

left, list each fact that supports your case. On the right, list the evidence that will prove each 

fact. Use the chart as you decide what evidence you will need, and as you create a list of 

questions for each witness. The trial  notebook is just for your use. You do not give a copy to the 

judicial  officer or to the other parties. 

Trials  are scheduled for a set period of time. If the Scheduling Order does not tell you 

the length of the trial, contact court administration  to see how much time is scheduled for the 

trial.  Knowing how long you have for the trial will  help you prepare. You need to be organized 

and figure out how long you want to spend with each witness and topic. 

The Trial 

At the trial, things will happen in this order: 

•  Opening statements 

•  Plaintiff’s case-in-chief (witnesses and exhibits) 

•  Defendant’s case-in-chief (witnesses and exhibits) 

•  Final arguments (also called  closing statements) 

Be on time for your trial  and make sure you know in advance if your trial is in-person or 

remote. If it is in-person, allow yourself extra time in case you run into traffic or weather issues, 

and allow time to find parking and go through security when you enter the courthouse. If your 

trial  is virtual,  make sure you test your technology ahead of time and allow plenty of time to log 

in. If you are not in the courtroom (in-person or virtual courtroom) when the clerk calls  your 

case, you may lose the case by “default” (by not appearing). If you have an emergency or are 

delayed, call  court administration, and let them know. Even if you call,  the court may hold the 

hearing without you, and you could lose by default.   

Be prepared that your trial  may take longer than expected. If your trial  is in-person, it is 

a good idea to take a bus or park in a ramp instead of at a meter to avoid worrying about an

expired meter. Arrange for childcare and let your employer know that you might be delayed, if 

needed. There is a possibility  that unanticipated or emergency situations will come up that your 

judicial  officer will need to handle. This means your trial  may be delayed or interrupted. 

Courtroom Behavior 

You do not have to buy new clothing  for court but remember that it is a formal place, 

and you want to be conservative and respectful in dress and behavior. Do not bring children 

unless the judicial officer has told you to bring your children to the trial. 

Certain behaviors are not allowed in a courtroom (whether it is in-person or virtual) 

because they are noisy, distracting,  or disrespectful. You should not chew gum, eat, sleep, listen 

to earphones, use a cell phone (except in silent mode in some cases), carry a weapon, or use a 

camera, including cell phone cameras (unless otherwise allowed). Some courts do not allow  cell 

phones in the courtroom, even if they are turned off. 

During the trial, you should listen carefully to the judicial officer and the other party. Ask 

the judicial officer for permission to speak. You should talk directly to the judicial  officer, not to 

the other party. When you talk to the judicial officer, start by saying, “Your Honor.” Speak 

loudly and clearly and remember that only one person can speak at a time. A court reporter is 

taking down everything said during the trial,  and they can only record one speaker at a time. 

Avoid arguing with or interrupting another person and try to control your emotions. 

Opening statements are the first part of a trial. For your opening statement, briefly 

summarize what the case is about, what outcome you will  ask for, and what evidence you will 

present. The evidence consists of witness testimony and exhibits the judicial  officer receives in 

The opening statement is not your testimony. Testimony is given later, under oath. The 

opening statement is not a time for making your arguments. That comes later in the closing 

argument  (also called final argument). In some cases, the judicial officer may not allow the 

parties to make opening statements, especially if the case is simple and the time available for

Plaintiff’s and Defendant’s Case-in-Chief 

After the opening statements, the plaintiff presents their evidence. This is called the 

plaintiff’s case-in-chief. When the plaintiff is done with all their witnesses and evidence, it is 

then the defendant’s turn to present their case-in-chief.  

Your case-in-chief may consist only of your testimony under oath, or it may include the 

testimony of other witnesses. If you have other witnesses, tell the judicial officer who will 

testify first, second, third, and so on. The judicial  officer may also ask you to summarize what 

each witness will say before the witness is called. Be prepared to explain in a few sentences 

how the testimony of each witness is important to your case. 

Direct Examination 

When you call  a witness to testify, you must ask them questions. This is called “direct 

examination.” It is helpful to have a list of questions to refer to as you do your direct 

examination of each of your witnesses. You can tell your witnesses before the trial  what you 

plan to ask so your witnesses are prepared. 

During direct examination, you should ask only one question at a time. It is difficult for 

the witness to respond to complex or compound questions (multiple questions asked at the 

same time). Also, keep in mind that you cannot testify while asking your witness questions; you 

can only testify if/when you are a witness on the stand and placed under oath. Often, the whole 

story does not come out until several witnesses have testified. The judicial  officer may make 

notes to remember the testimony of each witness, and in your final argument, you can explain 

Sometimes a witness is hostile or not answering as you expected. Do not argue with a 

how all the evidence fits together. 

witness. Just ask questions. 

Cross-Examination 

When you are finished asking questions (direct examination) of your witness, tell the 

judicial  officer. The other party (or their lawyer if they have one) will  then ask questions of the 

witness. This is called “cross-examination.” The questions asked during cross-examination must 

be related to the testimony the witness just gave in direct examination. Cross-examination is 

used to clarify the witness’ testimony and can also be used to undermine or discredit the

testimony. For example, if a witness testified that the roof leaked 3 days after the contractor 

put on a new roof, you might ask in cross-examination if it is true that a storm blew a large tree 

over and broke a hole in the roof 3 days after the contractor put in the new roof. 

Cross-examining a witness can be difficult. Non-lawyers often have trouble asking 

questions of the witness instead of making their own statements or arguments. Like in direct 

examination, you cannot testify when you are cross-examining a witness. You can only ask 

questions of the witness. The judicial officer may give you another chance to get it right or may 

say something like “you can testify when you are on the stand as a witness” and end the cross-

examination. 

Redirect Examination  (also called Rebuttal) 

After the other party cross-examines your witness, you may ask the witness more 

questions in what is called “redirect examination,” or “rebuttal,” but those questions must be 

related to something discussed on cross-examination. Do not feel that you must ask questions 

on redirect examination. It is fine to say that you have no further questions. 

Testifying as a Witness in Your Own Case 

If you testify as a witness in your case, you will take an oath and usually sit in the 

witness box (if your trial  is in-person). After you are sworn in, the judicial officer will  let you 

testify in a narrative fashion (telling the facts of the case as a story). When you are finished with 

your testimony, the other party (or their lawyer if they have one) will  be able to ask you 

questions on cross-examination. The judicial officer may also ask you questions.  

Introducing Evidence 

In addition to witness testimony, you may have documents or objects you want to use 

as evidence. Paperwork you may have filed with the court before the trial  is not evidence. If you 

want the court to use something as evidence, list it as an exhibit in your Exhibit List and offer it 

as evidence at the trial.  

To offer an exhibit as evidence, you usually need a witness who can tell the court about 

the exhibit. For example, if you have photos, the person who took the photos should testify 

about them, if possible, to explain when and where the photos were taken. You can be the 

witness if you have enough knowledge about the exhibit.

Objections 

Objections are challenges. Usually, objections are made because a party believes the 

evidence is not admissible according  to the MN Rules of Evidence. You (and the other party) 

can object to questions, witness testimony, or exhibits that you believe do not comply with the 

rules of evidence and procedure. If you want to object, you should say, “Objection,” very clearly 

to the judicial  officer. The judicial  officer will ask you to explain why you object, and then the 

other party will get to respond. If either side objects to something, all  questioning should stop 

immediately (if a witness is testifying, the witness should stop talking immediately). You must 

have a valid reason to object, according to the MN Rules of Evidence.  “The person is lying” is 

not a valid objection. 

•   If the judicial  officer sustains the objection, the witness cannot talk about whatever 

was objected to.   

• 

•

about whatever was objected to.  

If the judicial  officer overrules the objection, the witness can go ahead and talk 

If you don’t understand the judicial officer’s ruling on an objection, ask them 

If you have a key piece of evidence and the other side objects to it, the judicial officer 

will decide if that evidence is admissible and should become part of the trial  record. If the 

judicial  officer rules against you, you might be able to correct the problem. For example, if the 

objection was based on “lack of foundation” for a document, you might be able to ask the 

witness questions to explain what the document is and show that it is authentic so that you can 

get the document admitted into evidence.  Do not expect the judicial officer to tell you what to 

do or say to correct the problem. It is your job to make the legal arguments, and the judicial 

officer’s job is to make a ruling (decision). You should study the MN Rules of Evidence before 

the trial and get advice from a lawyer if you are not sure how to get key evidence into the 

record.  

Final Argument (also called Closing Statement or Closing Argument) 

After all  the evidence is given, you and the other party will be allowed to make final 

arguments. During your final argument, explain what you are asking the court to do, and how

the evidence presented supports your requests. If you want a money judgment, for example, 

tell the judicial officer how much money you want, and summarize the evidence to show why 

you should get that amount. A common mistake is to prove that you were harmed (damaged), 

but then not prove why the amount of money you want makes sense. For example, if your 

home repair was done improperly, you need evidence (such as contractor  bids or testimony) to 

show what it will cost to correct the mistake and get the result you were promised. Showing 

that the work was done improperly is not enough. You must prove the amount of damages. 

You may comment on any evidence that was presented at the trial  (your evidence and 

the other party’s evidence) and tell the judicial  officer what you think that evidence means. You 

are not allowed to tell the judicial officer any new facts about the case during final argument, as 

the opportunity to present evidence is over by this point. 

The plaintiff has the burden of convincing  the court (called the “burden of proof”) that 

their requests should be granted. The plaintiff will  speak first, and then the defendant will 

speak. The judicial  officer may put a time limit  on the final arguments. 

Burden of Proof 

As mentioned above, the party who started the lawsuit has the burden of proof. If the 

defendant counter-sued, the defendant has the burden of proof for their requests. If you  have 

the burden of proof, it is your responsibility to provide evidence that shows the court  that 

you should win the case. If the evidence weighs in favor of the other party, or if the balance is 

equal, you have not met your burden of proof, and the court will not give you what you 

asked for.  

Decision 

The judicial  officer decides the outcome of a case when there is no jury. They will listen 

to all  the testimony presented during the trial  and review all the exhibits. They will decide what 

facts were proven, and whether you are entitled to the relief you seek. 

Sometimes parties ask permission to file a “legal brief” after the trial  is over, or a judicial 

officer may ask for legal briefs. A legal brief is a written paper in which a party (or their lawyer if 

they have one) cites the law and tries to convince the judicial officer that the law supports the 

outcome that party wants. Briefs usually refer to statutes and case law. They cannot contain

new evidence. A law librarian  may be able to show you sample legal  briefs and explain the 

basics of legal research. If legal briefs are allowed or requested by the judicial officer, they will 

be due by a set date.  

After the trial  is over, and after legal briefs (if any) are submitted, the judicial  officer has 

90  days to make a written decision.  When you receive the written decision, it is very important 

that you read it thoroughly. There could be time-sensitive information and it is important to 

understand what your obligations are, if any, in the written decision.
