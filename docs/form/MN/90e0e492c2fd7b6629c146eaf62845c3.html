considered confidential based on court rule and not available to the public.  To keep 
this information confidential and not available to the public, you must take certain 
steps that are described below.   

The steps listed below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  Filers who are

onfidential Information Form 11.1 

All social security numbers, employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers (also 
called “restricted identifiers”) must not be listed on papers you file with the court. This is to protect your 
privacy, the other parties and your children.   Only provide social security numbers, employer 
identification numbers, and financial account numbers when the court requires this information to be 
provided to the court.  For example, if you must provide the court with bank account numbers, or 
medical account numbers, do not include any account number in your document (your motion, 
supporting affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you must use Form 11.1 to list these confidential numbers.  

If account numbers are not required to be provided to the court, and the numbers appear on documents 
that are considered available to the public, (such as medical invoices or credit account numbers on 
statements) you must remove the number on the document before filing the document with the court. 

over Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-public 
documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the time you file 
the documents with the court.  You must complete and file the “Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents 
Form 11.2 (also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public documents.  The most common 
non-public documents are called “financial source documents.”  Examples of financial source 
documents include: 

•  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and business expenses 
•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers   

ou may also need to submit other documents that court rules identify as non-public documents, such as 

a medical record.  For example, a report from a doctor that provides a medical diagnosis or treatment 
plan for you or your child would qualify as a medical record.   

You must use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing other non-public documents, such as medical 
records, with the court.  One Form 11.2 cover sheet can be used for submitting all non-public 
documents.   

The failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being rejected by 
court administration, being available to the public, stricken from the court record, and 
sanctions from the court. 

ee Rule 11 of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice for more information about how to file 

documents containing social security numbers, financial account numbers, “financial source documents” 
and other non-public documents.   

Form 11.1 and Form 11.2 can be found at www.mncourts.gov/forms under the court forms category of

Legal  Custody  identifies  which  parent(s)  has  /  have  the  right  to  make  decisions  regarding  the 
upbringing  of  the  children,  including  education,  health  care,  and  religious  training.  Legal 
Custody can either be sole or joint. Sole Legal Custody means that only one parent has a right to 
make major decisions regarding the upbringing of the children.  Joint Legal Custody means both 
parents share in the decision-making.  

hysical  Custody  identifies  which  parent  will  handle  the  routine  daily  care  and  control  of  the 
children. Generally, the child lives with the parent who has physical custody.  Physical custody 
can either be sole or joint. If Sole Physical Custody is awarded, the parent with whom the child 
does  not  live  with  will  have  scheduled  parenting  time  (visitation)  rights  unless  the  court 
"reserves"  parenting  time.  If  parenting  time  is  "reserved"  there  is  no  order  made  for  parenting 
time.  You must give the court reasons why parenting time should be reserved.  Joint Physical 
Custody means that the  children lives with both parents based upon a schedule that best meets 
the needs of the children and parents, and that the parents have joint responsibility and control in

you  and  the  other  parent  can  cooperate  and  work  together  to  resolve  problems  that  arise  in

disputes regarding joint physical custody before bringing a custody dispute back to court. 
 
Parenting Time is the time a parent spends with a joint child, regardless who has custody of the 
child. You must say if  you want parenting  time to be  unsupervised,  supervised, or  reserved.  If 
you think your children would not be safe alone with your spouse, you can ask the court to make 
parenting time  “supervised." You must explain at 16 a) and b) why supervision is needed, and 
who will do the supervising and pay any costs.  The court may order parenting time to take place 
at  a  parenting  time  center,  or  the  court  may  order  a  family  member  or  someone  from  social 
services  to  supervise  the  parenting  time.  If  you  check  “unsupervised”  the  parent  can  visit  the 
children without anyone else  watching.   If  you  check  “reserved”,  you are  asking  that the court 
give  that  parent  NO  parenting  time.  If  you  check  "reserved"  answer  part  (c)  describing  why 
"reserved" parenting time is best for the children. If parenting time is "reserved" either parent can 
ask the court to make a new order about parenting time in the future, by filing a motion with the 
court.    

This question asks about “Public assistance” paid by the State of Minnesota. Public Assistance 
means  MFIP,  Tribal  TANF,  General  Assistance,  MinnesotaCare,  Medical  Assistance,  or  Child 
Care  Assistance.    Check  YES  or  NO.    If  YES,  write  in  the  name  of  the  county  paying  the 
assistance.  Minnesota law requires the Petitioner to notify the public authority paying assistance 
that a divorce action has been filed.   

Answer whether you, your spouse, or your joint children receive Supplemental Security   Income 
(SSI) from the federal government. This is an income supplement program based  on  need.  To 
get  it,  you  must  be  low  income  and  over  65,  blind  or  disabled.    SSI  is  different  from  Social 
Security retirement or other benefits based on qualifying years of work.  

0.  

“School” includes high school, college, vo-tech, and night classes.  Check YES or NO.  If YES, 
answer (a) – (c). 

1.     This  question  is  about  your  spouse's  employment  status.    Provide  the  requested  information 
about   your  spouse's  employer.    If  your  spouse  is  self-employed,  list  the  business  name  and 
address.  For   purposes  of  setting  child  support,  there  is  a  presumption  that  both  parents  can 
work  full-time.  If  your  spouse  is  unemployed  or  works  less  than  40  hours/week,  answer 
subparagraphs  b)  i.  and  ii.  to  explain  why  your  spouse  is  not  employed  full-time  and 
describe  your  spouse's  past  work  experience.  If  you  do  not  know  the  information,  answer 
"unknown." 

2.      This question asks for  your spouse's  monthly income.  If  you don't have any information about 
your spouse's income, check the first box. If you have information about your spouse's pay, but 
do  not  know  if  your  spouse  has  other  types  of  income,  check  the  second  box.  If  you  know 
all of your spouse’s sources of income, check the third box and complete the income  
information. 

Minnesota law defines "income" a certain way for purposes of setting child support.  
•  When  you  enter income  amounts, enter the  "gross" amount, not the  "net". Gross income is 

• 

the amount received before taxes or other deductions are taken out.  
If  your  spouse  has  a  job,  the  most  accurate  way  to  calculate  gross  monthly  income  is  to 
multiply hourly wage by the number of hours your spouse works per week by 4.33. 4.33 is 
the average number of weeks in a month.

•  Overtime  pay  is  generally  excluded  from  income,  but  may  be  included  depending  on  the 
circumstances. Look at the Minnesota laws or consult a lawyer if you have questions about 
overtime pay or other categories of income. 

•  Public assistance benefits available to low-income people are not included in "income". Do 

not include MFIP, General Assistance, SSI or other public benefits as income.  

•  Look  at  each  category  of  income  and  enter  the  amount  your  spouse  receives  per  month 
(before taxes or deductions). Enter "zero" if your spouse does not have income of that type. 
If your spouse has a type of income not listed at #21, enter that income under "Other". 
When you have entered all monthly income amounts, total the numbers and enter that on the 
line "Total monthly income".  

• 

he 3 final questions at #22 are important for calculating child support.  

1. "Enter the amount of child support your spouse is court-ordered to pay for nonjoint children."  
Does  your  spouse  pay  child  support  for  a  child  that  is  his/her  legal  child,  but  not  your  legal 
child? If yes, write in the amount your spouse is court ordered to pay each month. 

. Enter the amount of spousal maintenance  your spouse is court-ordered to pay to  you or to a 
former spouse.   

. Enter the amount of Social Security of Veteran's Benefits provided to a joint child because of 
your spouse's retirement, disability, or other eligibility.  If a joint child of you and your spouse 
receives  SS  or  VA  benefits  due  to  your  spouse's  eligibility,  enter  the  monthly  amount  of  the 
child's benefit here.   Which parent receives the check on the child's behalf? Check the box for 
Petitioner if your spouse receives the check, and check the box for Respondent if the check goes 
to you on your child's behalf.

Provide the requested information about living expenses for the family.   

4.   Answer  whether  you  and  your  spouse  have  a  joint  child  with  special  needs  and  extraordinary 
medical  expenses.    If  YES,  provide  the  name  of  the  child,  describe  the  needs,  and  answer  (b) 
and (c).  

5.  

This question is about your employment status.  Provide the requested information about  your 
employer and jobs. If you work less than full-time, explain why you are not working full- time 
and what your past work experience is at paragraph c) i. and ii.

This question asks about your monthly income.  Complete the questions.   

7.   Complete  the  questions  about  child  care  costs  necessary  so  that  you  or  your  spouse  can  work 

or attend school. 

8.   Complete  the  questions  about  medical  and  dental  insurance.  The  court  needs  to  know  what 
coverage you, your spouse and your joint children have now and what it costs. If the children do 
not have health coverage, the court needs to know if you or your spouse could purchase health 
coverage through your work (question 27 f.) 

OTE:  If you, your spouse, or your children are covered by medical or dental insurance through 
your job or your spouse’s job, that coverage can be continued even after the divorce. If you want 
the insurance coverage to continue after the divorce, call the Employment Benefits Office of you 
or your spouse’s employer and ask for “COBRA” coverage.

This question is about spousal maintenance.  Spousal maintenance is money paid by one spouse 
to help support the other spouse (formerly called alimony).  If you check YES for either (a) or 
(b), you need to provide details about the length of marriage, education of the spouse who would 
receive maintenance,  gross  monthly income, and  reasons  why  the  spouse  would not be able to 
maintain the standard of living established during the marriage. 

0.  

List all the vehicles owned by Petitioner and Respondent together or separately. 

ARNING:    Questions  31-32  ask  about  marital  and  non-marital  property.  Dividing  marital 
property  and  non-marital  property  can  be  complicated.  You  should  talk  to  an  attorney.  For 
example, a house purchased by one spouse before the marriage, then lived in by both spouses will 
generally be part marital and part non-marital property. An attorney can advise you on the law 
and how to divide the value of the house between you. 

Marital  Property  means  almost  anything  that  you  or  your  spouse  own  that  you  or  your 
spouse received during the marriage, even during the times that you and your spouse were 
separated. This includes real estate, boats, cabins, household goods, furniture, jewelry, and 
other things. 

Non-marital  Property  means:  (1)  anything  that  you  or  your  spouse  owned  before  the 
marriage;  (2)  anything  that  you  or  your  spouse  received  as  a  gift,  bequest,  devise,  or 
inheritance; (3) anything that you or your spouse got in trade or in exchange for your non-
marital property; (4) anything that is an increase in the value of non-marital property; (5) 
anything  you  or  your  spouse  received  after  the  valuation  date  set  by  the  court;  or  (6) 
anything  included  by  a  valid  antenuptial  contract  (STOP:  If  you  have  an  antenuptial 
contract, you should stop here and talk to an attorney.)  

1.   Check YES or NO whether you and your spouse have divided the marital property to   your  

mutual satisfaction, including household goods, furniture, furnishings, and other   belongings. If  
you have NOT divided the marital property, list the items that you want. 

2.  

(a) Check YES or NO whether your spouse claims non-marital property.  Non-marital property 
is property owned before the marriage or acquired during the marriage by inheritance or   gift.   
List all non-marital property your spouse owns.  
 
(b)  Check  YES  or  NO  whether  you  claim  non-marital  property.    Non-marital  property  is 
property you owned before you got married or acquired during the marriage by  
inheritance  or 
gift.  List all non-marital property you own.  

3.   Check  YES  or  NO  whether  you  or  your  spouse  has  money  in  banks,  savings,  cash  or 

investments.  If YES, fill in all columns in the box. 

4.   Check  YES  or  NO  whether  you  and/or  your  spouse  own  part  or  all  of  a  business.    If  YES, 

fill in the name, address and value of the business. 

5.   Check YES or NO if either you or  your spouse owns a manufactured (mobile) home.  If YES, 

complete the detail questions.

WARNING: Question 36 asks you to list all real property. Real property is land and the buildings on 
the  land.  You  must  list  all  real  property  owned  by  you  and  your  spouse  together,  separately,  or  with 
others. Failure to list all property will create serious problems and expense in the future. Dividing real 
property is complicated. You should talk  to an  attorney  if  you and/or your spouse own any real 
property.  You  and  your  spouse  both  have  an  interest  in  all  real  estate  owned  by  either  you  or  your 
spouse until the divorce is finalized and the Decree awards the property to just one party.  For example, 
a  deed  given  by  one  spouse  to  the  other  spouse  before  the  divorce  is  finalized  does  not  transfer  all 
interest to the grantee spouse. 

(a) Check YES or NO if you and your spouse own any real property together.  
(b) Check YES or NO if your spouse owns real property solely in his/her name or with someone 
other than you. 
(c)  Check YES or NO if you own real property solely in your name or with someone other than 
your spouse. 
(d) Answer how many properties are owned by you and your spouse in total. 
If  YES  to  (a),  (b)  or  (c),  complete  the  Real  Property  Information  questions  for  each  piece  of 
property.  (1) List the full names of all owners of the property.  (2) Fill in the legal description of 
the  property  (the  legal  description  is  not  the  same  as  the  street  address).  Example  of  Legal 
Description: Lot 1, Block 4, Hamden Edition, Hennepin County, Minnesota. You can get a copy 
of the legal description from the Deed or Contract for Deed at the office of the County Recorder 
or Registrar of Titles in the County where the real property is located. WARNING: Be sure to 
copy the legal description exactly as is on the Deed or Contract for Deed. (3) Fill in the street 
address, city,  county,  and state  where  your  property is located.   (4)  State  the date  the property 
was purchased and its purchase price. (5) State the amount of any existing loans or mortgages. 
(6) State the current market value of the property and describe how you came up with that value.  
(7) Check YES if this property is the homestead.   

ARNING:  Question  37  asks  about  pension,  profit  sharing,  and  retirement  plans.  Dividing 
pension, profit sharing, and retirement plans is complicated. You or your spouse could face large 
losses if the divorce decree does not divide the pension or retirement plan according to the laws 
that apply. You should talk to an attorney if you or your spouse have any of these types of plan. 

(a)  Check  YES  or  NO  if  your  spouse  has  an  IRA,  401(k),  403(b)  or  other  retirement  plan.  If 
YES,  list  the  last  four  digits  of  the  account  number,  the  name  of  the  bank,  and  the  current 
account balance.  
(b) Check  YES  or  NO  if  your  spouse's  past  or  present  employer,  union,  or  other  group,  paid 
money into a pension, profit-sharing, or other retirement plan for your spouse.  If YES, list the 
name of the plan, the name of the group employer, union, or group providing the plan, the date 
your spouse began working at the job or joined the plan, the type of plan, and the present value 
of the plan.  
(c)  Check YES or NO if you have an IRA, 401(k), 403(b) or other retirement plan. If YES, list 
the last four digits of the account number, the name of the bank, and the current account balance. 
(d) Check YES or NO if your past or present employer, union, or other group, paid money into a 
pension, profit-sharing, or other retirement plan for  you.  If YES, list the name of the plan, the 
name of the group employer, union, or group providing the plan, the date you began working at 
the job or joined the plan, the type of plan, and the present value of the plan.  
 

38.   Check  YES  or  NO  if  you  and/or  your  spouse  have  outstanding  debts  (owe  money)  either 
 
 

together or separately. If YES, list all of the debts you and your spouse now have, even if  only

note.  List  all  debts  still  owed  from  before  you  were  married,  from  during  the  marriage  but 
before separation, and after separation.  The Judgment and Decree (divorce decree) will   state 
who is responsible for paying each debt. Include credit card bills, gas bills, water   bills,    
telephone bills, school loans, car loans, home loans and mortgages, and other bills and loans.   
List to  whom the debt is owed (such as Sears); how the money was used (such as  “clothing for  
the children”); whose name is on the account and when the debt was created (if you cannot get  
the  exact  date  the  debt  was  created,  at  least  state  if  the  debt  is  from  before  the  marriage,  or 
during  the marriage and before separation, or after   separation); the current balance due;  and the 
monthly  payment.  Attach  another  sheet  of  paper  if  you  need  more  space.  You  must 
disclose all debts.  

9.   You may change your name as part of the divorce, but you do not have to do so. You can  change 
your  name  to  a  maiden  name,  or  some  other  name.    You  cannot  make  your  spouse  change 
his or her name, and  your spouse cannot make  you  change  your name.   If  you want to change 
your name, check YES and answer (a) – (c).  If you do not want to change  your  name, 
check 
NO.   

(a)  Print  the  new  name  you  want  (first,  middle,  and  last).    Do  not  use  initials  unless  you 
want only an initial instead of a full name.  Check whether this is a former legal name or 
maiden name.  If not, explain why you want to change to this name. 
(b)  You  cannot  change  your  name  if  your  reason  for  changing  your  name  is  to  defraud  or 
mislead anyone.  Mark True or False to the statement “Respondent has no intent to defraud 
or mislead anyone by changing his/her name.” 
(c)  If  you  have  a  felony  conviction,  you  cannot  change  your  name  unless  you  notify  the 
prosecuting authority that you intend to change your name.  The prosecuting authority has 30 
days  after  being  served  with  your  notice  to  object  to  the  name  change.    If  you  have  been 
convicted  of  a  felony  anywhere  in  the  United  States,  answer  (c)  YES.    Ask  Court 
Administration  to  give  you  the  Felon  Name  Change  Instructions  or  you  can  download  the 
forms at www.mncourts.gov/forms.     

Warning:  If you do not notify the prosecuting authority of the request for name change 
and you use your new name, you may be guilty of a gross misdemeanor.

This  tells  the  court that you  want  your  marriage  dissolved.  You  do  not need  to  write  anything 
here.  

UESTIONS 2 and 3 tell the court and your spouse who you think should have legal custody and 
physical custody of the joint children.  The  court will  decide who should have custody based on 
what is best for the children.   

Legal  Custody  identifies  which  parent(s)  have  the  right  to  make  decisions  regarding  the 
upbringing of the children, including education, health care, and religious training. Legal 
Custody can either be sole or joint. Sole Legal Custody means that only one parent has a 
right to make decisions regarding the upbringing of the children, and Joint Legal Custody 
means both parents share in the decision-making.

Physical Custody identifies which person(s) will handle the routine daily care and control 
of  the  children.  Generally,  the  child  lives  with  the  parent  who  has  physical  custody.  
Physical custody can either be sole or joint. If Sole Physical Custody is awarded, the non-
custodial  parent  will  have  scheduled  parenting  time  (visitation)  rights  unless  the  court 
"reserves"  parenting  time.  If  parenting  time  is  "reserved"  there  is  no  order  made  for 
parenting time. But either parent can request a schedule in the future by filing a motion.   
Joint  Physical  Custody  means  that  the  children  lives  with  both  parents  based  upon  a 
schedule that best meets the needs of the child and parents, and that the parents have joint 
responsibility  and  control  in  the  daily  care  of  the  children.  If  you  request  joint  physical 
custody, you must be able to show that you and the other parent can cooperate and work 
together to resolve problems that arise in raising your children. 

Write the name of each joint child who is under age 18, or is 18 or 19 and still in high school. 
For each child, check the box to show what you want for legal custody.  

Again, write the name of each joint  child who is under age 18, or is 18  or 19 and still in high 
school. For each child, check the box to show what you want for physical custody.  

Write  down  what  parenting  time  arrangements  you  want.  First,  check  the  boxes  to  show  if 
parenting time should be unsupervised, supervised, or reserved. This should match what you said 
at #17 of the Findings section on the Answer and Counterpetition. Then, describe the parenting 
time schedule  you want.   It  should be  clear from  your schedule which parent is taking care of 
each child at all times (24 hours a day/7 days a week).  Include the time of day that the child will 
be exchanged. For example, a weekday schedule might be "the children are with Mother every 
Monday  through  Friday,  except  that  Father  has  parenting  time  every  Wednesday  from  4pm  to 
8am Thursday." What is appropriate for parenting time can depend on the age of the child.  
 
After  you  have  set  out  the  weekday  and  weekend  schedule,  you  can  request  a  different 
schedule  for  summer,  holidays,  birthdays,  or  school  release  days.      Holidays  may  include, 
but are not limited to, the following: New Years Day, Easter, Memorial Day weekend,   Fourth 
of  July,  Labor  Day  weekend,  Thanksgiving  Day,  and  Christmas.  Some  parents  alternate 
holidays each year so that, for example, on Memorial Day weekend the children would be with 
the mother in odd-numbered years and with the father in even-numbered years. The next  holiday 
would be Fourth of July and the children would be with the father in odd-numbered  years and 
with  the  mother  in  even-numbered  years.    Other  parents  keep  the  same  holidays  each  year  so 
that,  for  example,  the  children  spend  every  Christmas  Eve  with  one  parent  and  every 
Christmas Day with the other parent.  Under “Other,” you may want to include how you  would 
like to  handle Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, and any days or events that are special to you.   
 
Some parents include transportation details in the parenting time schedule. If you want to  say 
"Other.” Some 
who is responsible for transporting the child for parenting time, enter that under 
in 
come  up 
parents make very detailed parenting plans that address many more issues  that 
raising the children. If you would like a more detailed parenting plan, you  can  create  one  and 
attach it to your Counter Petition. The court does not have a form for a more detailed plan. It is 
also  possible  to  request  "reasonable  parenting  time."  With  reasonable  parenting  time,  there 
is no schedule in the divorce order. Instead, the parents work out   parenting time themselves, on 
an on-going basis. If you want "reasonable parenting time"  write  that  phrase  under  "Other"  and 
leave the rest of the schedule blank.

5.      The  court  will  make  an  order  regarding  child  support.  Child  support  includes  costs  for  the 
children  for  basic  support  for  daily  living  expenses,  health  care  coverage,  uninsured  and 
unreimbursed health care expenses, and child care expenses if child care is needed so the parent 
can work or attend school.  You do not need to fill in anything at #5.  However, at some point in 
the proceedings,  you will need to be specific about the amount of child support that is needed.  
The Minnesota Department   of  Human  Services  has  created  an  online  calculator  for  child 
support at: 

http://childsupportcalculator.dhs.state.mn.us 

You need income information for yourself and your spouse to use the calculator. This calculator 
is  intended  for  use  by  the  public,  and  after  you  enter  the  required  information,  the  calculator 
produces dollar amounts for support based on Minnesota law. If you think that support should be 
higher or lower in your case, you need to add a statement to your Answer and Counterpetition, 
requesting a "deviation" in child support and stating facts that support your request. You should 
research the law or get help from a lawyer if you wish to request a deviation.   

At  6a.  check  off  whether  you  want  to  pay  for  the  children's  medical  and/or  dental  insurance 
through  employment  or  private  insurance  or  whether  you  want  your  spouse  (Petitioner)  to  pay 
for the children's medical and/or dental insurance through employment or private insurance.  If 
the children are covered by Medical Assistance or Minnesota Care, check box 6b. instead.  If you 
think the court should make no orders about health coverage for the children at this time, check 
box 6c. to "reserve" the issue. Reserving the issue means that in the future either parent can file a 
motion  in  court  asking  for  an  order  deciding  who  must  provide  health  coverage  for  the  joint 
children.  

.      Usually  medical  and  dental  insurance  does  not  pay  every  bill.  For  example,  co-payments  and 
medicine might not be covered. These costs are called unreimbursed costs. Uninsured costs are 
expenses for treatment not covered by the health plan.   These costs are part of the child support 
obligation. The child support calculator provides a percentage allocation of these costs, based on 
the relative incomes of the parents. Check box 7a. to ask that these expenses be shared. Or check 
box 7b. if you want the court to reserve this issue and not make an order about these expenses at 
this time. 

.       This paragraph  states  how  you  want  to handle the health insurance  coverage  costs  for  you and 
your  spouse  (not  your  children).    Check  box  (a)  if  you  want  you  and  your  spouse  to  be 
responsible for  your own insurance after the divorce. Check box (b) if  you want one of  you to 
pay  the  insurance  costs  for  the  other  after  the  divorce.    Box  (c)  is  for  COBRA  coverage.  
COBRA coverage exists under federal law and it allows a spouse to continue to be covered under 
the other spouse's work insurance even after the divorce. For more information on costs, whether 
this  coverage  is  available,  and  how  to  get  it,  check  with  the  employer  of  the  person  who  has 
health coverage.  If you have other questions, or if the boxes provided do not explain what you 
want the court to order, ask an attorney for help. 

.    Minnesota  law  requires  the  parents  to  share  work-related  and  school-related  childcare  costs. 
This  is  part  of  the  child  support  obligation.    You  can  check  the  box  to  have  the  judge 
determine the share of monthly child care expenses according to Minnesota law or you can check

If there are children under the age of 18, parenting classes are required for the parents before you can get 
divorced.    If  the  parties  together  have  children  between  the  ages  of  6  and  17,  the  children  must  also 
attend classes before you can get divorced. 

arenting Programs: 

Both  you and  your spouse must attend the Parent Education.   You can  get a  listing of  local  parenting 
programs from the Court Administrator  along with a  description  of the programs and  how to register.  
Fees may be based on your ability to pay.  Parenting classes must be fulfilled BEFORE your divorce can 
be finalized. 
 

Step 8 
Temporary Relief 

f  you  and  your  spouse  need  a  temporary  order  to  address  temporary  custody,  parenting  time,  child 
support, spousal maintenance or any other matter in the divorce, go to the Court Administrator’s office 
and ask for “Temporary Relief Pending Final Hearing With Children” forms or download the forms at 
www.mncourts.gov./forms.   If the judge signs the temporary order that order is in effect until the judge 
signs the final order divorcing you and your spouse.   
 

Step 9 
Try to Settle All of the Issues with Your Spouse 

If  you  do  not  respond  to  the  Petition  for  Dissolution  of  Marriage  within  thirty  (30)  days,  your 
spouse will  notify the  court and  ask the  court  to grant  everything  asked for  in  the Petition.  The 
court will do so by issuing a final divorce decree called the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, 
Order for Judgment and Judgment and Decree.   

If  you  AGREE  with  everything  your  spouse  is  asking  for  in  the  Petition  for  Dissolution  of 
Marriage,  tell  your  spouse  in  writing.    Your  spouse  will  then  complete  a  document  called 
Stipulated Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order for Judgment and Judgment and Decree 
that you will be asked to review and sign to make sure it says what you agreed to for your divorce.   

If you do NOT AGREE with everything your spouse is asking for in the Petition for Dissolution of 
Marriage, you and your spouse should attempt to reach an agreement regarding as many issues as 
possible. 

If  you  and  your  spouse  reach  an  agreement  regarding  all  issues,  your  spouse  will  fill  out  a 
Stipulated Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order for Judgment and Judgment and Decree 
that you will be asked to review and sign to make sure it says what you agreed to for your divorce.   

f  you  and  your  spouse  DO  NOT  reach  an  agreement  regarding  all  of  the  issues,  you  and  your 
spouse  will  have  to  go  to  court  and  a  judge  will  decide  the  issues  for  you  after  a  trial.    If 
disagreements still exist, go to Step 10 and fill out the Parenting / Financial Disclosure Statement.

OTE:  Fill out the Parenting / Financial Disclosure Statement form ONLY if you and your spouse 
DO NOT reach an agreement regarding all of the issues and you must go to trial so the judge can 
make a decision on how to settle the issues. 

he Parenting/ Financial Disclosure Statement gives the court-updated information regarding income, 
employment,  property,  children,  and  other  issues  since  you  filed  your  Answer  and  Counterpetition.  
Your spouse will also submit a Parenting / Financial Disclosure Statement.  The court will schedule a 
hearing  called  a  “Prehearing  Conference.”    Unless  excused  by  the  court,  you  must  attend  the  hearing 
prepared to negotiate a final settlement of all issues.  If you do not go to the Prehearing Conference, the 
court  can  issue  a  final  divorce  decree  without  considering  anything  that  you  have  asked  for,  and  can 
order  you  to  pay  your  spouse’s  attorney’s  fees  (if  any).    If  you  and  your  spouse  cannot  reach  an 
agreement at the Prehearing Conference, the court will issue an order identifying the issues about which 
you  disagree,  scheduling  the  trial  date,  and  setting  the  date  by  which  you  and  your  spouse  must 
exchange your list of exhibits and witnesses to be offered at trial. 

he  questions  asked  in  the  Parenting  /  Financial  Disclosure  Statement  form  are  similar  to  questions 
asked  on  other  forms  you  have  already  filled  out.    The  purpose  of  this  form,  however,  is  to  give  the 
court-updated  information  in  preparation  for  trial.    To  answer  the  questions  asked  about  YOU,  you 
should  look  at  your  Answer  and  Counterpetition  and  any  Application  for  Temporary  Relief  you  may 
have filled out.  To answer the questions asked about YOUR SPOUSE, you should look at your spouse’s 
Petition for Dissolution of Marriage and any Application for Temporary Relief your spouse may  have 
filled out.  The Application for Temporary Relief is a separate form.

Step 11 
Wait For Your Final Divorce Decree 

If  you  and  your  spouse  reached  an  agreement  settling  all  of  the  issues  in  your  marriage  by 
signing  a  Stipulated  Findings  of Fact,  Conclusions  of  Law,  Order for Judgment and  Judgment 
and  Decree  your  spouse  will  file  the  document  with  the  court.    The  Court  Administrator  will 
send you and your spouse a notice telling you when the Judge has signed the Stipulated Findings 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order for Judgment, and Judgment and Decree. 
 
If you and your spouse were unable to settle all of the issues and you had to go to trial, the court       
will issue the final divorce decree within 90 days after the trial.  This will be called the Findings 
of  Fact,  Conclusions  of  Law,  Order  for  Judgment  and  Judgment  and  Decree.    A  copy  will  be 
sent to you.

make additional copies of your Decree.  However, a copy is “certified” only if it has the original seal of 
the District Court.  You cannot make a certified copy yourself. 
 
OTHER STEPS AFTER ENTRY OF THE DECREE   
It is the responsibility of the parties to take all necessary steps to put into effect the orders of the court. 
For example, if you changed your name you will need to get your driver’s license and social security 
card changed to reflect your new legal name. If you or Respondent were awarded pension or medical 
benefits, the company or provider will need to see the Decree and may have other requirements before 
making the changes ordered by the court. If you and/or Respondent own real estate, there are additional 
steps you must take to transfer the title to the real estate to the party who was granted the real estate in 
the Decree.  

nder Minnesota law, both spouses have an interest in real estate, even if only one spouse’s name is 

on the deed or title of the property.  

roof of divorce and proof of who was awarded interests in the real estate is usually recorded in the 

real estate records before selling or mortgaging the property after the divorce. 

o give that proof, the complete divorce decree can be filed in the real estate records. Or, a short version 

of the divorce decree can be filed, called Summary Real Estate Disposition Judgment Form (SREDJ). 
The SREDJ only includes information needed for real estate title purposes. If you file the SREDJ, 
information about your children, work, and other personal matters is not available in the county real 
estate records.  The Minnesota Judicial Branch publishes a set of instructions to help you with the 
SREDJ process. Those instructions can be found on the court’s website at

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
