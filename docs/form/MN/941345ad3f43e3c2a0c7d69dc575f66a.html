Public Education Brochure  
How to Prepare for Trial for Housing Cases 

ousing cases usually start with a “first appearance.” If the case is not settled or resolved at the 

first appearance, a new court date will be assigned for a trial. This brochure is about the trial.  

alk to a lawyer if possible: 

If possible, get a lawyer to help you with your trial.  Some courts have legal advice clinics at the 
courthouse  or  law  library.    Go  to  www.mncourts.gov/selfhelp  and  select  Self-Help  Services  in 
the courts.   For lawyer referral information, go to www.mncourts.gov/selfhelp/?page=252 

ead all court orders and notices carefully: 

Your trial date will be in a court order or a Notice of Trial Date.  Make sure you get a copy.  If 
there is a court order, read it carefully.  It may require you to do certain things.  The order may 
ask  you  to  exchange  lists  of  witnesses  and  exhibits.    Exhibits  are  the  documents  and  other 
evidence you want to use at trial.  If you do not exchange information on time, the Court may not 
allow  you  to  use  those  witnesses  and  exhibits.  In  addition,  the  order  may  require  you  to  bring 
extra  copies  of  exhibits  to  the  trial  so  that  the  other  party  and  the  Judge  have  copies  of  your 
exhibits to keep.  The order may also require the tenant to deposit rent into court. 
  
Pay the court ordered rent on time: 

 If the Court order tells you to deposit rent, make sure you do so on time.  “Deposit rent” means 
that  you pay the  rent  to  court administration. The Judge will later decide who  gets  the  rent  on 
deposit – the tenant or the landlord. Before bringing the rent money to court administration, ask 
what  type  of  money  is  accepted.  Some  courts  will  accept  only  cash  or  certified  funds.    Some 
courts will accept money orders. Do not bring non-certified checks. 
  
Scheduling and continuances: 

The Court generally schedules the trial within seven days of  your first  court date.  If  you want 
the trial postponed, you must ask the other side and the Court for a continuance.  Ask as soon as 
possible.  It is unusual to be allowed a continuance.  You may have to ask the Court in writing. 

  
Begin preparing now for your trial: 

This is the time to decide who your witnesses will be and what exhibits you want to bring to trial.  
Exhibits are things that you want the Court to look at, such as pictures, letters, your written lease, 
rent ledger sheets and inspection reports.  You must bring them to court if you want the Court to 
look at them; the Court does not automatically get reports from other government agencies. 

ote: Remember that in all Housing Court cases you should at a minimum bring a copy of your 

written lease and some record or documentation about your rent payment history!

Evidence and witnesses: 

The  Minnesota  Rules  of  Evidence  control  what  evidence  the  Court  can  accept  in  a  trial.    For 
example, in general,  you cannot use oral or written statements from a person unless the person 
comes to trial to testify.  This is called the “hearsay rule.”  There are exceptions to it.  The rules 
of  evidence  are  available  at 
the  courthouse  and  online  at 
www.mncourts.gov/selfhelp under “Laws, Rules and Legal Research.” For more information on 
evidence,  see  the  Court’s  booklet  “What  to  Expect  as  a  Self-Represented  Plaintiff  or 
Defendant...Civil Trial (without a jury).” 
  
Subpoenas: 

the  Law  Library 

in 

You  can  subpoena  witnesses  or  documents  to  make  sure  that  they  appear  at  trial.    You  get  a 
subpoena from court administration for a fee, but the fee can be waived by a judge for persons 
with low incomes.  The subpoena must be served on the witness, along with the witness fees and 
mileage  costs,  by  an  adult  who  is  not  a  party  to  the  case.  If  you  subpoena  a  witness,  you  will 
need to pay that witness a fee, plus mileage from the witness’ home to the courthouse and back.   
For  more  information  on  the  witness  fees,  see  the  Instructions  on  the  court  Subpoena  form, 
available at www.mncourts.gov/ctforms. 

f  you  want  to  use  a  Housing  Inspector’s  order  as  evidence,  you  do  not  need  to  subpoena  the 
Inspector.  Instead, you can ask the Inspector for a certified copy of the inspection order to bring 
to court.  However, if you are claiming that the Housing Inspector said anything that is not noted 
on  the  report  or  if  you  want  the  Inspector  to  present  other  evidence,  you  must  subpoena  the 
inspector, unless the Inspector agrees to come to court without being subpoenaed. 

f you want a witness, including an inspector, to bring records to court, you must use a subpoena 
duces tecum to require the witness to bring records.  The duces tecum box on the subpoena must 
be checked and a list of the documents you are requesting clearly written on the subpoena. If a 
witness  agrees  to  bring  a  document  to  court  voluntarily,  you  do  not  need  the  subpoena  duces 
tecum.  However,  a  witness  is  required  to  appear  in  court  or  to  bring  documents  only  if  a 
subpoena is served with the witness fees. 

Consider discussing settlement with the other side: 

Most cases are settled.  A settlement  can save both sides time, money and the stress  of a trial.  
Either side might win or lose at trial, while settlement might allow each party to get something. 

  
  
The  settlement  should  be  in  writing  so  both  sides  and  the  Court  are  clear  about  the  settlement 
agreement.  If you reach your settlement at Court, ask the clerk for a settlement form.  The Court 
will review and approve your agreement. 
  
Trial Day:  Come Early 

Check in with court administration, along with your witnesses, at least 15 minutes before the trial 
is  scheduled  to  begin.    Always  allow  extra  time  for  traffic,  security  screening  and  finding  the 
courtroom.   If you are not on time for your trial, you may lose your case by default.

Trial Procedure: 

At the start  of the trial,  the  Judge  explains how the trial  is run.   If  you have  a question,  ask it 
then,  before  you  start  presenting  your  case.    The  Judge  cannot  give  you  legal  advice.    The 
Judge’s job is to be neutral and fair, and decide the facts and the law.  Everything said in the trial  
is  “on  the  record”,  which  means  that  the  court  reporter  or  the  recording  equipment  takes  it  all 
down.    It  is  your  job  to  prove  to  the  Court  what  you  believe  happened.    It  is  also  your  job  to 
convince the Court to rule in your favor by having good supporting witnesses and documents and 
by showing the court that the law supports the relief you seek. 
  
Do not interrupt: 

Never interrupt the other side, a witness or the Court.  If you think that the other side is violating 
the Minnesota Rules of Evidence, you should stand up and say, “Your Honor, I object.”  After 
making  this  statement,  you  should  explain  your  objection  to  the  evidence.    For  example,  “that 
statement is hearsay, because the person who said it is not here to testify.”  The Court will either 
grant or deny your motion.  If the Court grants your motion, then the other side’s evidence will 
not be allowed into the record. 
  

Do’s and don’ts: 
  
Do not bring young children to court.  No gum, food or drinks are allowed in the courtroom.  All 
cell  phones  must  be  turned  off.    You  must  treat  the  Judge  and  the  other  side  with  respect.  
Address them formally, for example, “Your Honor”, “Mr. Smith”, or “the Defendant.”   
Yelling,  swearing  and  using  abusive  language  are  not  allowed.    These  actions  can  be 
punished as contempt of court with fines and an immediate escort by a court deputy to jail. 
  
The  Court  may  call  a  recess.  If  you  need  a  break  for  a  medical  reason,  ask  the  Court 
immediately. 
  
Who sits at the front tables: 
  
Usually, only the parties and their lawyers or agents sit up front at the tables in the courtroom.  If 
you want someone else, like an advocate or building manager to sit with you, ask the Court at the 
start of the trial.  You need the Court’s permission first.  Stay at  your table unless you need to 
give a witness or the judge or referee a document.  Before you can walk up to a witness on the 
stand  or  the  judge  or  referee.    Ask,  “May  I  approach  the  witness?”  or  “May  I  approach  the 
Bench?” 
  
The end of the trial: 
  
At the end of the trial, the Court may make a decision right away and give you a copy.   If the 
Court  takes  the  case  “under  advisement”,  the  Court  will  mail  you  a  copy  of  the  order  once  a 
decision has been made.  Make sure the Court has your correct mailing address.  Do not call the 
referee or judge about your case.  If you write the Court, you must send a copy of your letter to 
the other side. On the letter to the Court, list the names of all people to whom you sent a copy.
