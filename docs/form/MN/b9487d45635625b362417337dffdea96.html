Important Notices and Resources 

The Minnesota  Judicial  Branch has forms and instructions,  for some types of cases, as a general 
guide  to the court process. These instructions  explain  the steps in more detail  and answer common 
questions,  but are not a full  guide  to the law. Court employees  may be able to give  general 
information  on court rules and procedures,  but they cannot give legal  advice.  

Have a question  about court forms or instructions? 

•  Visit  www.MNCourts.gov/SelfHelp 
•  Call  the MN Courts Self Help Center at (651) 435-6535 

 

Not sure what to do about a legal issue or need advice? 

•  Talk with  a lawyer 
•  Visit  www.MNCourts.gov/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx   

                                           

Helpful  materials may be found at your public county law library. For a directory, see http://mn.gov/law-
library/research-links/county-law-libraries.jsp . For more information, contact your court administrator or call

11. Did you  restrict or put limits  on the person’s right  to communicate,  visit,  or interact with  anyone?    

NOTE: The person subject to guardianship  has the right  to communicate,  visit,  or interact with 
others.  This can include  having  visitors,  making  or receiving  telephone  calls,  personal mail,  or 
electronic  communications,  or participating  in  social activities.   The guardian  can restrict the 
person subject to guardianship from any of these activities if there is good cause to believe 
the restriction is necessary to protect the person subject to guardianship from significant 
physical, psychological, or financial  harm, and there is no other way to avoid the 
significant harm.    

If you restrict the person subject to guardianship, you must give written notice to the: 

•  Court, 
•  Person subject to guardianship,  and 
•  Person subject to the restrictions. 

See Minn.  Stat. 524.5-120  (10),  https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/524.5-120.   

There is a Notice of Restrictions form (GAC116) online  at www.mncourts.gov/forms  (choose 
the “Guardianship/Conservatorship”  category).

12. Payment for Services.   

a.  During  the reporting  period,  have you been paid  for services provided  to the person 

subject to  guardianship?   If yes, list  the amount you  were paid,  and tell  whether any of 
the payment was made by county contract. 

b.  List the current rate you charge for your services.  NOTE: you can enter $0 if you are 

not charging  for your  services. 

13. Continuation or Changes to the Guardianship 

This question  is here so that you can give  the court your opinion  about the guardianship.   Your 
answers here will  not result in any change (there are forms for asking for changes to the 
guardianship  online  at http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=21.  ) 

14. Are you a Professional Guardian 
      Tell the court whether you are a professional  guardian,  which means you  are acting as a guardian      
      for three or more people  who are not related to you by blood,  adoption,  or marriage. 

The Signature Block 

Date, sign,  and give your  contact information. 

If there is more than one guardian, each co-guardian  must also sign the form as long as the co-
guardian’s answers are the same as yours.  The co-guardian’s signature  can be at the end of the form 
in the same section where your signature  goes.  If the co-guardian has a different answer to any of 
the questions in this form, then the co-guardian should fill  out their own form.

Date and sign  the bottom  of the page.   

You must include  the Bill of Rights (GAC100) with  the Annual Notice of Right (GAC 11-G).  The Bill 
of Rights is available  online  at www.mncourts.gov/forms  (choose the “Guardianship/Conservatorship” 
category). 

 

Step 3 
Makes Copies 

For the person subject to guardianship: 

You will  need to make one set of copies  of the completed  

•  Personal Well-Being Report (GAC 11-U),  
•  Annual Notice of Right (GAC 11-G),  and  

GAC201           Eng            State                Rev. 8/20 

 

w ww.mncourts.gov/forms                  Page  9 of 12 

You will  need to make a set of copies  for each interested party of the completed 

•  Bill of Rights (GAC100)   

 

For interested persons of record with the court: 

•  Personal Well-Being Report (GAC 11-U),  
•  Annual Notice of Right (GAC 11-G),  and  
•  Bill of Rights (GAC100)   

  

Make a copy for yourself  (and any co-guardians)  if you  would  like  to keep a copy for your records. 

Step 4 
Serve the Person subject to Guardianship 
and 
Interested Persons of Record with the Court 

Next, you have to see to it that the person subject to guardianship,  and any interested persons of record 
with the court,  get a copy of the the documents listed  in above in  Step 3. This  is called  service of 
process.   

NOTE: Check the court record to see if any interested person has filed  a waiver saying  they do not 
want to receive notices  or reports.  There could  also be a court order saying  who should  not receive 
notices and reports. 

You, or any person age 18 or over can serve the papers (either in person or by mail).   For more 
information  about Service of Process, visit  the Help Topic online  at http://mncourts.gov/Help-
Topics/Service-of-Process.aspx. 

If there is more than one Personal Well-Being Report (because a co-guardian’s answers are different 
than yours), then each report needs to be served along  with the other forms. 
 

Step 5 
Fill Out the Affidavit of Service (Annual Reporting - Guardianship) (GAC 11.2) 

After the papers have been served on the person subject to guardianship  (and any interested persons on 
record with the court), the person who served the papers must fill  out the Affidavit of Service (GAC 
11.2),  which is available  online  at www.mncourts.gov/forms  (choose the 
“Guardianship/Conservatorship”  category).  

The top of the Affidavit of Service should be filled  out like  the other forms. 

Next, the person who served the papers puts their name on the line  in  the first sentence.

Proof of Service for the Person Subject To Guardianship 

A.  The server should  fill  out the name and address of the person subject to guardianship. 

B.  The person subject to guardianship needs to receive at least 3 forms: 

•  Personal Well-Being Report; 
•  Annual Notice of Right to Petition for Termination or Modification or Other Relief; and 
•  Bill of Rights. 

Check the box showing  which forms the person subject to guardianship  received.  You should 
check the first 3 boxes.  If you are giving  the person subject to guardianship  another document, 
check “Other” and include  the name of the document. 

C.  List the date the papers were mailed  or handed to the person subject to guardianship. 

D.  Check the box showing  how the papers were served (by mail  or personal service).

w ww.mncourts.gov/forms                  Page  11 of 12 

 

 

 

 

 

E.  The server fills  out this  section for any person of interest that they served papers to.   

Finally,  the server should  sign  the Affidavit of Service under penalty  of perjury.  By signing  the affidavit 
under penalty  of perjury,  the server is stating  that the information  in the affidavit  is true to the best of 
their knowledge.  Perjury is the crime of intentionally  lying  or misrepresenting  the truth,  punishable  by 
jail  or other sanctions.  

After it has been signed,  you can make one copy of the Affidavit of Service for your records. You must 
file  the Affidavit of Service with the court as part of Step 6.   

Step 6 
File Forms with the Court 

File  the following  forms with the court (there is no filing  fee): 

•  Personal Well-Being Report(s); and 
•  Affidavit of Service (Annual Reporting). 

ou can file  the forms with the court in the following  ways: 

In person at the courthouse;  

• 
•  By mail;  or  
•  Electronically  through  the eFS System (NOTE: once a party files 

The Annual Notice of 
Right and Bill of Rights 
forms are not filed with 
the court.  You only have 
to file the report and the 
proof of service. 

electronically,  they are required to use the eFS System 
throughout  the entire case; this means they cannot go back to paper filing  in that case). For more 
information  about electronic  filing  and the eFS System,  see https://minnesota.tylerhost.net/.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
