 General Information About Filing a  
Petition for Restoration of Firearm and Ammunition Rights (FIR102) 

he information contained in this document is not intended as legal advice but as a general 
guide to you to explain the legal process.  If you do not understand any of these procedures, 
talk to an attorney.  Court staff cannot give legal advice.    

ndividuals convicted of or adjudicated delinquent for a crime of violence are barred from 
possessing, shipping, transporting or receiving a firearm and/or ammunition for the remainder of 
their life unless their rights are later restored.   

inn. Stat. § 609.165, subd. 1(d) allows individuals to ask the court to restore the right to 

possess firearms and ammunition after being convicted or adjudicated delinquent of a crime of 
violence.  Minn. Stat. § 624.712, subd. 5 provides the list of crimes of violence that can cause an 
individual to lose the right to possess firearms and ammunition.   

When do I qualify for Restoration of Firearm and Ammunition Rights? 

he Petition for Restoration of Firearm and Ammunition Rights (FIR102) may ONLY be used 

IF all of the below are true for your case:   
 

• 

It has been at least three years since your last request for restoration of firearm and 
ammunition rights;  

•  You have been discharged from felony probation; and  
•  You are not currently incarcerated. 

f you are not sure if all of the above are true for your case, you should talk to an attorney.  

What information do I need to complete the Petition?  

he judge will need information about any criminal and juvenile delinquency case that resulted 

in the loss of firearm and ammunition rights to determine if there is good cause to grant your 
petition. This includes all charges, convictions, adjudications, and all pending actions involving 
felony level offenses.   

t is recommended that you get the following:  

1.  Register of Action: Request a copy of the Register of Action (ROA) for the case that 

resulted in the loss of the right to possess a firearm. If you were convicted or adjudicated 
delinquent of multiple crimes of violence under different cases, each of these convictions

could have caused you to lose your right to possess a firearm.  Make sure to request and 
attach to your Petition a ROA for each Criminal and Juvenile Delinquency case that 
caused you to lose your right to possess a firearm.  

f you have more than one criminal case in multiple counties and/or judicial districts and 
are unsure which case caused you to lose this right, you should talk to an attorney for 
legal advice.  

he ROA can be printed at a MN county courthouse through the Records Center or the 

Minnesota Public Access terminals. There is a court copy fee for the ROA.  

2.  Background Check: Criminal background checks are available through the Minnesota 

Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  
The BCA offers a Minnesota-only background check, but may not offer a national check.  
The FBI offers a national background check.   

ifferent judges may have different preferences regarding nationwide and Minnesota-
only background checks.  The more information you provide, the better informed the 
judge is to decide your Petition.  

osts and Process:  It costs money to request a background check and takes time to 

complete.   

ou can get full details about the costs and process from the BCA and FBI websites.

OTICE: Even if the judge grants your Petition, you may still be prohibited from possessing 
firearms and ammunition under other applicable state or federal laws. We strongly encourage 
you to get legal advice and not assume you may lawfully possess a firearm even if your Petition 
is granted.  

Where and how should I file the Petition?  

here are a few issues to keep in mind when deciding where (county) to file your case and 

whether to file within your existing case or to start a new Civil case. Please consider the 
following issues to help decide where to file and in which case.  

ne Case with Conviction: If you were convicted, or adjudicated delinquent, of a crime of 
violence in only one case, you may choose to file this Petition in that case. Filing within that 
specific case will make sure that any order restoring your rights is available in that case and is 
communicated to state and federal justice partners who are responsible for determining your

eligibility to possess firearms. There is no filing fee when you file into your existing Criminal or 
Juvenile Delinquency case. If you choose to open a new Civil case then you will pay the filing 
fee in that county.  

ultiple Cases with Convictions: If you were convicted, or adjudicated delinquent, of multiple 

crimes of violence in different cases, each of these convictions could have caused you to lose 
your right to possess a firearm.  Make sure to include all of the Criminal and Juvenile 
Delinquency cases that caused you to lose your right to possess a firearm.   
 

•  Cases in the same Judicial District – If all of your cases are in the same Judicial 

District, even if in different counties (for example, all the cases are in the 10th Judicial 
District but are in Anoka County and Washington County) then you may: 
 

o  File one Petition in the county where one of the cases is located. You must list 

only that case on the caption in your Petition, but should include all Criminal and 
Juvenile Delinquency case numbers in the body of the Petition. There is no filing 
fee when filing into your existing Criminal or Juvenile Delinquency case. OR  
 

o  File one Petition in the county where one of the cases is located, or where you 
live, as a new Civil case. Each case will need to be included in the body of the 
Petition. There is a filing fee to open a new Civil case.  
 

•  Cases in different Judicial Districts – If you have multiple cases in different judicial 

districts then you may:  
 

o  File a Petition within each judicial district in one of the Criminal or Juvenile 

Delinquency case that resulted in the loss of your firearm rights. There is no filing 
fee when filing into your existing Criminal or Juvenile Delinquency case. OR 
 

o  File one Petition in the county where one of the cases is located, or where you 
live, as a new Civil case. Each case will need to be included in the body of the 
Petition. There is a filing fee to open a new Civil case. 

 

OTE ON JUVENILE DELINQUENCY CASE INFORMATION: If you choose to file a 
Civil case, you are required to give information about all Criminal and Juvenile Delinquency 
cases that resulted in the loss of firearm rights.  All of the information in your Petition, including 
any references to confidential Juvenile Delinquency cases, will be public in the Civil case file.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
