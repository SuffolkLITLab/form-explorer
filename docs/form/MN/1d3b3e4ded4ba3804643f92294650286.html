      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre>APPENDIX A 

OTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN TO THE PARTIES: 

I.  PAYMENTS TO PUBLIC AGENCY.  According to Minnesota Statutes, section 518A.50, payments ordered 
 
for maintenance and support must be paid to the Minnesota child support payment center as long as the person entitled to 
receive the payments is receiving or has applied for public assistance or has applied for support and maintenance collection 
services.  Parents mail payments to: P.O. Box 64326, St. Paul, MN 55164-0326.  Employers mail payments to: P.O.  Box 
64306, St. Paul, MN 55164. 

II.  DEPRIVING ANOTHER OF CUSTODIAL OR PARENTAL RIGHTS -- A FELONY.  A person may be 
 
charged with a felony who conceals a minor child or takes, obtains, retains, or fails to return a minor child from or to the 
child's parent (or person with custodial or parenting time rights), according to Minnesota Statutes, section 609.26.  A copy of 
that section is available from any court administrator. 

III.    NONSUPPORT  OF  A  SPOUSE  OR  CHILD  – CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A person who fails to pay 
court-ordered  child  support  or  maintenance  may  be  charged  with  a  crime,  which  may  include  misdemeanor,  gross 
misdemeanor, or felony charges, according to Minnesota Statutes, section 609.375.  A copy of that section is available from 
any district court clerk. 

IV.  RULES OF SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, PARENTING TIME. 
Payment of support or spousal maintenance is to be as ordered, and the giving of gifts or making purchases of food,  
clothing, and the like will not fulfill the obligation.   
Payment of support must be made as it becomes due, and failure to secure or denial of parenting time is NOT an 
excuse for nonpayment, but the aggrieved party must seek relief through a proper motion filed with the court. 
Nonpayment of support is not grounds to deny parenting time.  The party entitled to receive support may apply 
for support and collection services, file a contempt motion, or obtain a judgment as provided in Minnesota 
Statutes, section 548.091. 
The payment of support or spousal maintenance takes priority over payment of debts and other obligations. 
A party who accepts additional obligations of support does so with the full knowledge of the party's prior obligation 
under this proceeding.   
Child  support  or  maintenance  is  based  on  annual  income,  and  it  is the responsibility of a person with seasonal 
employment to budget income so that payments are made throughout the year as ordered. 
A Parental Guide to Making Child-Focused Parenting Time Decisions is available from any court administrator. 
The nonpayment of support may be enforced through the denial of student grants; interception of state and federal 
tax refunds; suspension of driver’s, recreational, and occupational licenses; referral to the department of revenue or 
private collection agencies; seizure of assets, including bank accounts and other assets held by financial institutions; 
reporting to credit bureaus; income withholding, and contempt proceedings; and other enforcement methods allowed 
by law.  
The  public  authority  may  suspend  or  resume  collection  of  the  amount  allocated  for  child  care  expenses  if the 
conditions of Minnesota Statutes, section 518A.40, subdivision 4, are met. 
The  public  authority  may  remove  or  resume  a  medical  support  offset  if  the  conditions  of  section  518A.41, 
subdivision 16, are met. 

V.  MODIFYING CHILD SUPPORT.  If either the obligor or obligee is laid off from employment or receives a 
pay reduction, child support may be modified, increased, or decreased.  Any modification will only take effect when it is 
ordered by the court, and will only relate back to the time that a motion is filed.  Either the obligor or obligee may file a 
motion to modify child support, and may request the public agency for help.  UNTIL A MOTION IS FILED, THE  CHILD 
SUPPORT  OBLIGATION WILL CONTINUE AT THE CURRENT LEVEL.  THE COURT IS NOT PERMITTED TO 
REDUCE SUPPORT RETROACTIVELY. 

VI.    PARENTAL  RIGHTS  FROM  MINNESOTA  STATUTES,  SECTION  518.17,  SUBDIVISION  3.  

UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BY THE COURT: 
A. 

Each party has the right of access to, and to receive copies of, school, medical, dental,  religious training, police 
reports, and other important records and information about the minor children.  Each party has the right of access to 
information regarding health or dental insurance available to the minor children.  Presentation of a copy of this order 
to the custodian of a record or other information about the minor children constitutes sufficient authorization for the 
release of the record or information to the requesting party.

Each party has the right to be informed by the other party as to the name and address of the school of attendance of 
the  minor  children.  Each  party  has  the  right  to  be  informed  by  school  officials  about  the  children's  welfare, 
educational progress and status, and to attend school and parent teacher conferences.  The school is not required to 
hold a separate conference for each party. 
Each party has the right to be notified by the other party of an accident or serious illness of a minor child, including 
the name of the health care provider and the place of treatment. 
Each  party  has  the  right  to  be  notified  by  the  other  party  if  the  minor  child is the victim of an alleged crime, 
including the name of the investigating law enforcement officer or agency.  There is no duty to notify if the party to 
be notified is the alleged perpetrator. 
Each party has the right of reasonable access and telephone contact with the minor children. 

VII.  WAGE AND INCOME DEDUCTION OF SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE.  Child support and / or 
spousal  maintenance  may  be  withheld  from  income,  with  or  without  notice  to  the  person  obligated  to  pay,  when  the 
conditions  of  Minnesota  Statutes,  section  518A.53,  have  been  met.   A copy of that section is available from any court 
administrator. 

VIII.  CHANGE OF ADDRESS OR RESIDENCE.  Unless otherwise ordered, each party shall notify the other 
party, the court, and the public authority responsible for collection, if applicable, of the following information within ten days 
of any change: residential and mailing address, telephone number, driver's license number, social security number, and name, 
address, and telephone number of the employer. 

IX.  COST OF LIVING INCREASE OF SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE.  Basic support and / or spousal 
maintenance may be adjusted every two years based upon a change in the cost of living (using the U.S. Department of Labor, 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, consumer price index Mpls. St. Paul, for all urban consumers (CPI-U), unless otherwise specified 
in  this  order)  when  the  conditions  of  Minnesota  Statutes,  section  518A.75,  are  met.    Cost  of  living  increases  are 
compounded.  A copy of Minnesota Statutes, section 518A.75, and forms necessary to request or contest a cost of living 
increase are available from any court administrator. 

X.  JUDGMENTS FOR UNPAID SUPPORT.  If a person fails to make a child support payment, the payment 
owed becomes a judgment against the person responsible to make the payment by operation of law on or after the date the 
payment is due, and the person entitled to receive the payment or the public agency may obtain entry and docketing of the 
judgment without notice to the person responsible to make the payment. 

XI.  JUDGMENTS FOR UNPAID MAINTENANCE.   
A  judgment  for  unpaid  spousal  maintenance  may  be  entered  and  docketed  when  the  conditions  of  Minnesota 
Statutes, section 548.091, are met.  A copy of that section is available from any court administrator. 

The public authority is not responsible for calculating interest on any judgment for unpaid spousal maintenance.  
When  providing  services  in  IV-D cases, as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 518A.26, subdivision 10, the 
public authority will only collect interest on spousal maintenance if spousal maintenance is reduced to a sum certain 
judgment. 

XII.  ATTORNEY FEES AND COLLECTION COSTS FOR ENFORCEMENT OF CHILD SUPP ORT.  A 
judgment for attorney fees and other collection costs incurred in enforcing a child support order will be entered against the 
person responsible to pay support when the conditions of Minnesota Statutes, section 518A.735, are met.   A copy of that 
section  and  forms  necessary  to  request  or  contest  these  attorney  fees  and  collection  costs  are available from any court 
administrator. 

XIII.  PARENTING TIME EXPEDITOR PROCESS.  On request of either party or on its own motion, the court 
may appoint a parenting time expeditor to resolve parenting time disputes under Minnesota Statutes, section 518.1751.  A 
copy of that section and a description of the expeditor process is available from any court administrator. 

XIV.    PARENTING  TIME REMEDIES AND PENALTIES.  Remedies and penalties for wrongful denial of 
parenting  time  are  available  under  Minnesota  Statutes,  section  518.175,  subdivision  6.    These  include  compensatory 
parenting time; civil penalties; bond requirements; contempt; and reversal of custody.  A copy of that subdivision and forms 
for requesting relief are available from any court administrator.
