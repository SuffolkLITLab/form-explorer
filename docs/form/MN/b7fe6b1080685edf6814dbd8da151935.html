IMPORTANT NOTICES 

   

•  WARNING: You CANNOT use these forms UNLESS there is already a court order giving you 
or the other party parenting time. If you do not have such an order, then you may need to talk 
to an attorney to see which set of forms is right for your situation.  Information about finding 
an attorney is found online at http://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx.  

 “Parenting time” means the time a parent spends with a child regardless of the custodial 
designation regarding the child.  See Minn. Stat. § 518.003, subd. 5 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/518.003).  

  The Court expects every person who appears in court without an attorney to know and follow the 

law. The judge will not be able to give you any help in court. 

  Court personnel and the county attorney’s office CANNOT help you fill out these forms.  

  You MUST fill out all forms, and you MUST follow these instructions.  

  You should see an attorney if you do not know how to answer the questions on these forms, or if you 

think the other party will hire an attorney.

Petitioner and Respondent as listed on your current Parenting Time Order, or divorce or paternity

off only the boxes for the type of help you are asking for from the courtyou do not need to check off 
every box. You may check off as many types of help as you wish, but it will be up to the court to 
decide what types of help (if any) will be ordered. 

.  Check box 1 if you are asking for makeup (compensatory) parenting time because a scheduled time 

was wrongfully denied and the other party has not let you have makeup parenting time.

other party to resolve the parenting time problems and/or any future parenting time problems that

other parties reach an agreement between yourselves regarding the problem. However, if you and 
the  other  party  are  not  able  to  resolve  the  problem  yourselves, then the parenting time  expeditor 
will make  a decision settling  the  problem. The parenting time expeditor cannot make a decision 
that changes the existing parenting time order.

form, and list what county and state they are in when they sign the Affidavit of Service by 
Mail. 

fter the server signs the Affidavit of Service by Mail, make one copy for your records. The original is 

filed with the court as part of Step 7. 
 

Step 7 
File the Forms with the Court 

he  original  documents  must  be  RECEIVED  by  the  Court  Administrator’s  office  at  least  21  days 
before  the  date  of  the  hearing.    You  can  file  the  documents  listed  below  in  person,  by  mail,  or 
electronically (you must allow three extra days if you mail your forms).    

ile the following documents with the Court Administrator: 

  The original of the Notice of Motion and Motion for Parenting Time Assistance; 
•  The original of your Affidavit in Support of Motion for Parenting Time Assistance; 
•  The original of the Affidavit of Service by Mail OR Affidavit of Personal Service. 

here will be a motion fee due when you file your paperwork.  You can make checks payable to 

“District Court.” 

f you cannot afford to pay the motion fee, you can ask for a fee waiver by completing the forms in the In 
Forma Pauperis/IFP packet of forms (found online at http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=19&p=69).   
If  a  judge  does  not  sign  the  fee  waiver  order,  then  you  must  pay  the  motion  fee  before  Court 
Administration can process your forms.     
 

Step 8 
Appear in Court 

ou must go to court on the date set for the hearing. Be sure to be on time. Bring with you to the hearing 
your copies of the papers.  Do not bring children to the first hearing. The hearing is very formal.  You 
should be polite to everyone in the courtroom, and address the judge as “your honor.” Remember to talk 
to the judge, not to the other party.  Do not argue with the other party or be unnecessarily disparaging of 
the other party.  After the hearing, the judge will issue an Order.  The judge may issue the Order at the 
end of the hearing or may send a copy of the Order to you in the mail.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
