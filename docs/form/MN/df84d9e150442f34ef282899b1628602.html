nswering the Questions about Children 

Questions  10  through  15  ask  about  all  children,  including  children  both  you  and  your  spouse 
have together AND all children from other relationships (nonjoint children).  It is important that 
these questions are completed thoroughly.  A joint child is a child born to you and your spouse 
born before or during your marriage, or adopted by you and your spouse during the marriage – it 
does NOT include stepchildren.  A nonjoint child is a legal child born to you or your spouse, or 
adopted by you or your spouse – it does NOT include stepchildren. 

f either party has given birth to a child born during the marriage from another relationship and a 
Recognition of Parentage and/or Spouse’s Non-Parentage Statement has been signed,  you must 
be sure to attach a certified copy of both forms.  Certified Copies of the Minnesota Recognition 
of  Parentage  and  Non-Parentage  Statement  can  be  obtained  by  completing  and  notarizing  the 
required form provided by the Minnesota Department of Health.

omplete the Questions on Custody and Parenting Time.  Questions 16 and 17 in the petition 
and  paragraph  2  through  4  of  the  Agreement  tell  the  Court  who  you  and  your  spouse  think 
should  have  legal  custody  and  physical  custody  of  the  joint  children  and  establish  a  parenting 
time  schedule.    The  Court  will  decide  who  should  have  custody  based  on  what  is  best  for  the 
children.   

egal  Custody  identifies  which  parent(s)  has  /  have  the  right  to  make  decisions  regarding  the 
upbringing  of  the  children,  including  education,  health  care,  and  religious  training.  Legal 
Custody can either be sole or joint. Sole Legal Custody means that only one parent has a right to 
make major decisions regarding the upbringing of the children.  Joint Legal Custody means both 
parents share in the decision-making.  

hysical  Custody  identifies  which  parent  will  handle  the  routine  daily  care  and  control  of  the 
children. Generally, the child lives with the parent who has physical custody.  Physical custody 
can either be sole or joint. If Sole Physical Custody is awarded, the parent with whom the child 
does not live with will have scheduled parenting time rights unless the court "reserves" parenting

time. If parenting time is "reserved" there is no order made for parenting time.  You must give 
the court reasons why parenting time should be reserved.  Joint Physical Custody means that the 
children lives with both parents based upon a schedule that best meets the needs of the children 
and  parents,  and  that  the  parents  have  joint  responsibility  and  control  in  the  daily  care  of  the 
children. If you request joint physical custody, you must be able to show that you and the other 
parent can cooperate and work together to resolve problems that arise in raising  your children.  
The court may require you and the other parent to agree to mediate any disputes regarding joint 
physical custody before bringing a custody dispute back to court. 

Parenting Time.  Question 17 tells the Court what type of parenting time  you and  your spouse 
believe is in the best interests of the joint children.  Paragraph 4 of the Agreement is where you 
will write down what parenting time arrangements you agree upon.  It should be clear from your 
schedule which parent is taking care of each child at all times (24 hours a day/7 days a week).  
Include the time of day that the child will be exchanged. For example, a weekday schedule might 
be "the children are with Petitioner A every Monday through Friday, except that Petitioner B has 
parenting time every Wednesday from 4pm to 8am Thursday."  What is appropriate for parenting 
time can depend on the age of the child.  
 
After you have set out the weekday and weekend schedule, you can agree to a different schedule 
for  summer,  holidays,  birthdays,  or  school  release  days.    Some  parents  include  transportation 
details in the parenting time schedule. If you want to say who is responsible for transporting the 
child for parenting time, enter that under  
"Other".  It  is  also  possible  to  request  "reasonable 
parenting  time."  With  reasonable  parenting  time,  there  is  no  schedule  in  the  divorce  decree. 
Instead,  the  parents  work  out  parenting  time  themselves,  on  an  on-going  basis.  If  you  want 
"reasonable  parenting  time"  write  that  phrase  under  "Other"  and  leave  the  rest  of  the  schedule 
blank.  

 

hild  Support.    When  there  are  children  in  dissolution  actions,  the  court  must  make  an  order 
regarding child support. Child support includes costs for the children for basic support for daily 
living  expenses,  health  care  coverage,  uninsured  and  unreimbursed  health  care  expenses,  and 
child  care  expenses  if  child  care  is  needed  so  the  parent  can  work  or  attend  school.    The 
Minnesota  Department  of  Human  Services  has  created  an  online  calculator  for  figuring  out  an 
amount for child support at: 

http://childsupportcalculator.dhs.state.mn.us 
You need income information for yourself and your spouse to use the calculator. This calculator 
will  produce  a  dollar  amount  for  support  based  on  Minnesota  law.  Enter  this  information  at 
paragraph  5  of  the  Agreement.    If  you  think  the  amount  of  support  should  be  higher  or  lower 
than what the calculator figured out, mark the box that says the amount is a "deviation" in child 
support.  You may need to research the law or get help from a lawyer if you wish to request a 
deviation.   

hild  Care  Support.    Minnesota  law  requires  parents  to  share  work-related  and  school-related 
childcare costs.  Question 26 is where you will tell the Court the costs for child care, if any.  The 
child support calculator will calculate the share  each parent should pay, based on their relative 
incomes.  If  you or  your spouse do not have child care expenses at this time, check the box to 
reserve the issue in Agreement paragraph 9.

Public Assistance 
Question  18  asks  about  “Public  assistance”  paid  by  the  State  of  Minnesota.  Public  Assistance 
means  MFIP,  Tribal  TANF,  General  Assistance,  MinnesotaCare,  Medical  Assistance,  or  Child 
Care  Assistance.    Check  YES  or  NO.    If  YES,  write  in  the  name  of  the  county  paying  the 
assistance.  Minnesota law requires you, as the petitioner, to notify the public authority that you 
are  filing  a  divorce  action  when  the  public  authority  is  paying  assistance  or  processing  your 
application for assistance.  Use the form called Notice to Public Authority (court form DIV813) 
to  notify  the  county  of  your  divorce  action.  The  county  attorney  for  the  public  authority  must 
sign off on the Joint Petition and Agreement before the joint petition is submitted to the court for 
the  court’s  approval  and  signature.    Be  sure  to  contact  the  county  attorney’s  office  to  make 
arrangements for the county attorney to review your Joint Petition and Agreement.   

nswering the Income Questions: 

Questions 21 and 25 ask for monthly gross income (before taxes and deductions). 
Do not guess at income. Look at your pay stub or tax return.   
If you are paid monthly, enter the amount shown on your paycheck for gross income.  
If you are paid twice a month, multiply gross income by 2 to get the monthly amount. 
If you are paid every two weeks, multiply gross income by 2.17 to get the monthly amount. 
If you are paid every week, multiply gross income by 4.33 to get the monthly amount. 

f you are self-employed, or you work only part of the year, or your earnings vary, divide your 
yearly income by 12 to  reach an  average monthly  income  figure  and write on  the petition that 
you are averaging your income. 

 

omplete  the  questions  and  agreement  paragraphs  about  medical  and  dental  insurance. 
The court needs to know what coverage you, your spouse and your joint children have now and 
what it costs. If the children do not have health coverage, the court needs to know if you or your 
spouse can afford to purchase health care coverage.   

OTE:    If  you,  your  spouse,  or  your  children  are  covered  by  medical  or  dental  insurance 
through your job or your spouse’s job, that coverage can be continued even after the divorce. If 
you  want  the  insurance  coverage  to  continue  after  the  divorce,  call  the  Employment  Benefits 
Office of you or your spouse’s employer and ask for “COBRA” coverage. 

Medical Support.   Question 27  tells  the  court  about health  care  coverage  you  and  your spouse 
currently have and the costs for that coverage.  Agreement paragraphs 6, 7, and 8 tell the court 
how you and your spouse will handle the health insurance coverage costs for you, your spouse, 
and  the  joint  children.    (COBRA  coverage  exists  under  federal  law  and  it  allows  a  spouse  to 
continue to be covered under the other spouse's work insurance even after the divorce. For more 
information  on  costs,  whether  this  coverage  is  available,  and  how  to  get  it,  check  with  the 
employer of the person who has health coverage.  Unreimbursed costs are expenses for treatment 
not covered by the health plan.   These costs are part of the child support obligation. The child 
support  calculator  provides  a  percentage  allocation  for  costs  of  health  care  costs  based  on  the 
relative incomes of the parents.

Income Withholding.  Minnesota law requires an employer or other source of funds to withhold 
spousal  maintenance  and/or  child  support  from  the  employee’s  paycheck  when  a  party  is 
receiving  or  has  applied  for  public  assistance,  or  spousal  maintenance  or  child  support 
enforcement services.  The employer will send it to the county where you are getting the divorce. 
The county will then send the spousal maintenance / child support to the parent who is supposed 
to receive it.   Upon filing your Joint Petition for Marriage Dissolution, court administration will 
mail  out  a  Notice  of  Services  that  explains  child  support  and  maintenance  services  available 
through  the  public  authority,  including  income  withholding  and  the  fees  for  such  services.    If 
you,  your  spouse,  and  child(ren)  do  not  receive  government  assistance,  income  withholding 
through the public authority is not required.  You and your spouse may agree to direct payments 
of  spousal  maintenance  and/or  child  support.    NOTE:  If  you  did  not  elect  automatic  income 
withholding and  you later decide  you want it, contact your local county child support office to 
find out how to start income withholding services. 

Most documents filed with the court are considered public documents and 
are available to the public.  Certain information that is filed with the court 
may be considered confidential based on court rule and not available to the 
public.  To keep this information confidential and not available to the public, 
you must take certain steps that are described below.   

The steps listed below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  Filers 
who are using eFS to submit their court documents must identify and 
designate their filings as required in Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 11.03 and 14.06.   

onfidential Information.   

NOTE! 

  C

 

Confidential Information Form 11.1 

All social security numbers, employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers 
(also called “restricted identifiers”) must not be listed on papers you file with the court. This is to 
protect your privacy, the other parties and your children.   Only provide social security numbers, 
employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers when the court requires this 
information to be provided to the court.  For example, if you must provide the court with bank 
account numbers, or medical account numbers, do not include any account number in your 
document (your motion, supporting affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you must use Form 11.1 to list these 
confidential numbers.  

If account numbers are not required to be provided to the court, and the numbers appear on 
documents that are considered available to the public, (such as medical invoices or credit account 
numbers on statements) you must remove the number on the document before filing the 
document with the court. 

Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-
public documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the 
time you file the documents with the court.  You must complete and file the “Cover Sheet for

 Rev 1/21

www.mncourts.gov/forms 

Page 5 of 8 

Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 (also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public 
documents.  The most common non-public documents are called “financial source documents.”  
Examples of financial source documents include: 

•  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and business 

expenses 

•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers   

ou may also need to submit other documents that court rules identify as non-public documents, 
such as a medical record.  For example, a report from a doctor that provides a medical diagnosis 
or treatment plan for you or your child would qualify as a medical record.   

You must use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing other non-public documents, such as 
medical records, with the court.  One Form 11.2 cover sheet can be used for submitting all non-
public documents.   

The failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being 

rejected by court administration, being available to the public, stricken from the 
court record, and sanctions from the court. 

See Rule 11 of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice for more information about how to file 
documents containing social security numbers, financial account numbers, “financial source 
documents” and other non-public documents.   

Form 11.1 and Form 11.2 can be found at www.mncourts.gov/forms under the court forms 
category of “Confidential Information” and is court form number CON111 and CON112. 

o You or Your Spouse Own Real Estate? 

You  must  include  real  estate  that  you  and  your  spouse  own  together,  separately,  or  with  other 
people.  WARNING:  Be sure to copy the legal description exactly as it is on the Deed, Contract 
for  Deed,  or  Certificate  of  Title.    You  must  fill  out  Attachment  “C”,  which  is  included  at  the 
back of the Joint  Petition with Children.  You will need  to make  a  copy  of  Attachment  “C” if 
there is more than one property that must be listed.  Use a separate Real Estate Attachment sheet 
for each parcel of real estate.  Use the correct legal description – do not guess or abbreviate. 
There are many ways to handle real estate and many potential problems. You should talk to an 
attorney if you own real estate. For example, you may want the real estate awarded to one person 
with  a  lien  in  favor  of  the  other  person.    An  attorney  can  help  you  understand  the  legal 
consequences and necessary language.  

o You Want to Change Your Name? 

You and/or your spouse can ask for a legal change of name in the Joint Petition.    If you want to 
change  your name  and  you have been convicted  of  a  felony,  you must  get the handout  “Felon 
Name Change Instructions” and follow the steps in the handout.

Modifying the Joint Petition 
You may make changes to the Joint Petition to fit your situation, but do not omit any paragraphs. 
It  is  recommended  that  you  consult  with  an  attorney  before  making  any  changes  to  the  Joint 
Petition. 

hat to Do After Completing the Forms 

•  Both  Petitioners  (you  and  your  spouse)  must  sign  the  “Joint  Petition,  Agreement,  and 
Judgment and Decree”.  It is not necessary for both spouses to sign the document at the same 
time, but both signatures must be signed under penalty  of perjury.  By signing the Petition 
under penalty of perjury, you are stating that the information in the document is true to the 
best  of  your  knowledge.    Perjury  is  the  crime  of  intentionally  lying  or  misrepresenting  the 
truth, punishable by jail or other sanctions. 

ile with the Court: 

The  completed  “Joint  Petition,  Agreement,  and  Judgment  and  Decree,”  including  the  Asset 
Sheet, the Debt Sheet, and the Real Estate sheet.  File Form 11.1 - Confidential Information with 
names, social security numbers, and financial account numbers, and Form 11.2 - Cover Sheet for 
Non-Public Documents with all confidential documents attached. 

ay:  The District Court filing fee. 

ait:    You  are  not  divorced  until  the  Judge  signs  the  Decree  and  the  Court  Administrator 
“enters” the Decree. Wait to receive a Notice from the Court telling you that you are divorced.   
The Judge will decide if a court hearing is necessary and court administration will notify you if a 
hearing must be scheduled. 

f you have real estate, there are additional steps you must take to transfer the title to the party 
who was granted the real estate in the divorce.  
Under Minnesota law, both spouses have an interest in real estate, even if only one spouse’s 
name is on the deed or title of the property.  

Proof of divorce and proof of who was awarded interests in the real estate is usually recorded 
in the real estate records before selling or mortgaging the property after the divorce. 

To give that proof, the complete divorce decree can be filed in the real estate records. Or, a short 
version  of  the  divorce  decree  can  be  filed,  called  Summary  Real  Estate  Disposition  Judgment 
Form  (SREDJ).  The  SREDJ  only  includes  information  needed  for  real  estate  title  purposes.  If

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
