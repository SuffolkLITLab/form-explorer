General Information 

inn. Stat. § 518A.80 establishes a process to transfer an existing child support, custody, and/or 
parenting time action to Tribal Court.  If you do not agree with the other party’s motion to transfer a 
postjudgment action to Tribal Court, you can serve and file an objection in the form of a Responsive 
Motion Objecting to Transfer of Postjudgment Action to Tribal Court (FAM1105) and an Affidavit in 
Support of Responsive Motion Objecting to Transfer of Postjudgment Action to Tribal Court 
(FAM1106). 

Do you have all the information you need to fill out the forms? 

The forms ask for: 

•  The county, judicial district, and court file number where the district court or expedited 

process case is filed. 

•  The name of the Tribal Court (for example, Red Lake Nation Tribal Court).  
•  Whether: 

o  The case requires interpretation of Tribal law; 
o  The case involves Tribal traditions or cultural matters; 
o  The tribe is a party to the action; 
o  The case involves the issue of Tribal sovereignty, jurisdiction, or territory; 
o  The parties have chosen the District Court of the State of Minnesota and/or the laws of 

the State of Minnesota to be applied to any disputes in a prior court order; 

o  There is an open IV-D Tribal Agency case. 

Fill out the forms completely and accurately. 

•  If something does not apply to you, you may answer "N/A" (meaning "not applicable").   
•  If the answer to a question is "none," write "none."  
•  If you do not know the answer to a question, write "unknown." But try not to leave blanks in 

your forms. 

Expedited Process or District Court? 

You must file this motion in the Expedited Child Support Process if: 

•  The action is for child support only, AND 
•  A case participant is receiving IV-D services from the county.

Read through the Acknowledgment.  If every statement is true, then sign and date the Motion to 
Transfer Postjudgment Action to Trial  Court.  Then print your contact information under your 
signature. 

Step 2 
Fill Out Affidavit in Support of Responsive Motion Objecting to Transfer of 
Postjudgment Action to Tribal Court (FAM1106) 

Fill  out the caption the same way you did on the Motion. 

Check the box telling what kind of action this request involves (child support, custody, and/or 
parenting time).  Then answer questions 1-9. 

Sign and date the Affidavit form, and print your contact information in the blanks under the 
signature line.  When you sign the Affidavit, you are signing under penalty of perjury.  This means 
you are saying that everything in the form is true and correct; if you know something in the form is 
not true when you sign it, you could be found guilty of the crime of perjury (see Minn. Stat.  
§ 609.48,  https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.48). 

If you are not using the eFS System to serve and file papers in your case, then you will  need to make 
one copy of the Responsive Notice of Motion and Motion and one copy of the Affidavit for each 
party (including yourself) 

Step 3 
Make Copies 

Step 4 
Serve the Other Parties 

The other party (parties) must receive complete copies of all documents you have prepared. This is 
called "service of process." The papers can be served personally (handed to the other party), or by 
mail. Papers cannot be served on a legal holiday (as defined in Minn. Stat. § 645.44,  subd. 5, 
https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44#stat.645.44.5).   

The method of service depends on whether you are filing these papers in the expedited child 
support process or in district  court. 

You will use one of the methods of service for the Expedited Child Support Process if: 

•  The action is for child support only, AND 
•  A case participant is receiving IV-D services from the county.

If the action involves child custody and/or parenting time, AND 

• 
•  A case participant is receiving IV-D services from the county. 

SERVICE DEADLINE: Service must be completed within 30  days of the date the Motion to Transfer 
(that you received from the other party) was served.  Note that the date of service is not always 
the date you received it; it could be the date that the Motion to Transfer was mailed to you.  If you 
are not sure of the date of service, you can look at the Affidavit of Service that the other party filed. 

You will  need to arrange to have another adult serve the copy of the Notice of Motion and Motion 
Objecting to Transfer Postjudgment Action to Tribal  Court and the Affidavit in Support of Responsive 
Motion Objecting to Transfer Postjudgment Action to Tribal Court on the other party and the county 
attorney’s office.  NOTE:   You cannot serve the documents yourself.  You must have someone else 
over the age of 18 who is not a party to the case hand-deliver or mail  the documents for you.  

Personal Service  – the forms are hand-delivered to the county attorney’s office or to other party 
personally or by leaving them at that party’s place of residence with some person who is of suitable 
age or discretion who also lives at that same address.  You can hire a private process server or the 
sheriff’s office to personally serve for you.  

Service by Mail – the forms are mailed by first class U.S. mail  to the other party and the county 
attorney’s office.

at that same address.  You can hire a private process server or the sheriff’s office to personally serve 
for you.   

Service by Mail – the forms are mailed by first class U.S. mail  to the other party.   

Step 5 
The Affidavit of Service (SOP105) 

The person who hand-delivers or mails  the forms must fill out an Affidavit of Service form for each 
party served.  The Affidavit of Serivce must be filled out completely.  If a private process server or 
the sheriff serve for you, they may give you a document called Certificate of Service. 

The server must sign the Affidavit of Service under penalty of perjury.  By signing the Affidavit of 
Service under penalty of perjury, the server is stating that the information in the Affidavit of Service 
is true to the best of their knowledge.  Perjury is the crime of intentionally  lying or misrepresenting 
the truth, punishable by jail or other sanctions. 

Step 6

If you cannot afford to pay the fee, you may qualify to have the fee waived by the court. You need 
to fill  out an In Forma Pauperis (IFP), or fee waiver, application  and file it with court administration. 
Your application  will be reviewed by a judge who will decide whether you must pay the fee. If the 
judge does not sign an order that waives the fee, you must be prepared to pay the fee.  For more 
information and links to the fee waiver forms, see https://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Fee-Waiver-

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
