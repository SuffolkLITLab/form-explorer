General Information About Expungement of Eviction Record 
Minn. Stat. § 484.014 

he information contained in  these instructions is not intended as legal advice but as a general 
guide to you to explain the legal process.  If you do not understand any of these steps or do not 
know if these forms fit your situation, talk to an attorney.  Court staff cannot give legal advice. 

hat is eviction expungement?  

Eviction expungement asks for a judge to seal an eviction court record  (formerly known as unlawful 
detainer) from public view.  If your eviction expungement request is granted, then a search of court 
records will not show your eviction case.   

hy would you ask for an expungement of your eviction court record? 

Usually, someone asks for expungement of an eviction court record because it impacts their ability 
to  rent  another  property.    Eviction  court  records  can  be  viewed  by  the  public,  and  landlords 
commonly use tenant screening companies to do background checks on individuals asking to rent 
their property.  

hen can the court expunge an eviction court record? 

You can ask for an expungement when the landlord wrongly filed an eviction case and it would be 
unfair to keep it on your record.  Minnesota law says expungements are allowed when: 

  The landlord’s case was “sufficiently without basis in fact or law,” 
 
  The public’s interest in knowing about the case is not stronger than the justice that would 

It is “clearly in the interests of justice,” and 

be accomplished by expunging the case. 
 

Do you have all the information you need to fill out the forms? 
The Motion and Affidavit for Expungement of Eviction Record forms ask for the following 
information: 

  The county, judicial district number, and the court file number where the eviction was filed.   
  The name and address of the landlord and/or the attorney representing the landlord.  
  Your address listed in the Eviction Complaint.   
  Details about why you should have your eviction court record expunged.   
  Any evidence or documentation to support your request to have your eviction court record 

expunged.

 
If you cannot view your case online, you may be able to view your court file at any 
courthouse in Minnesota.  If your eviction case is older, you may need to go to the

your court file.  

.  At the top of the page, write in the following information: 

  The county where the case is located; 
  The judicial district number (each county is located in one of ten judicial districts); 

and 

 

  Your court file number (this usually starts with a two-digit number, followed by 

letters and numbers.  For example, 15-CV-17-0001). 

2.  Write in the name of the plaintiff (landlord) as listed on the eviction complaint.  Write in the 

name of each defendant (tenant) as listed on the eviction complaint.   If your name is

Your Burden of Proof.  

You must explain to the court why you are asking to expunge your eviction record.  You may 
check the box next to “a,” or “b,” or both “a” and “b.” 
 

8.  You may be entitled to expungement of your eviction record if the property you rented was 
subject to contract for deed cancellation or mortgage foreclosure.  This is called mandatory 
eviction expungement.  Check the appropriate boxes if this applies to your situation.  

.  You may also be entitled to discretionary expungement of your eviction record.  You must 

prove all of the following: 

 

HOU501      State       ENG     Rev. 2/20                 www.mncourts.gov/forms

i.    the landlord’s eviction case was “sufficiently” without basis in fact or law;  
ii.   the expungement is “clearly in the interest of justice;” AND  
iii.  the “interests of justice” are not outweighed by the “public’s interest in knowing the    
       record.”  

e sure to give a detailed explanation for i., ii. and iii.  If you fail to provide an explanation 

for all three sections, the judge may deny your request to expunge your eviction record.   
 

10. To prove the landlord’s eviction case was without sufficient basis in law or fact, you can talk 
about things that were wrong with the case.  For example, the court papers were not served 
the right way, you won the case, the parties settled the eviction with an agreement and the 
landlord agreed he or she did not have good legal reasons for starting the case, you moved 
out before the eviction was filed, or the case was about nonpayment of rent but there were 
things at the property that needed repairs.     
 

11. The court also needs to know why the expungement is in the interests of justice.  Describe 
why the expungement is important to you and how it will help you.  For example, you can 
explain if you still live at the property the eviction was about or if the eviction was related to 
a hard time in your life, like job loss, medical problems, or divorce.   

12. You also need to prove the interests of justice are not outweighed by the public knowing 

about the eviction.  For example, you can explain if the case is old, if you have not had any 
recent evictions, if you are having trouble finding housing, or why safe, stable and affordable 
housing is important to you.   
 

 
 
 
 

  B

 

13.  If you have any documents or other evidence to support your request to expunge your 

eviction record, you should attach it to your Affidavit.   List the evidence you are attaching.  
You may attach things like a settlement agreement, proof you moved, a letter from the 
landlord agreeing not to object to expungement, rental application denials, pictures of the 
repair problems, etc.

Step 3 

Contact Court Administration About a Hearing Date 

n some districts, you need to schedule the hearing before you file your Motion for Expungement 
of Eviction Record.  In other districts, you get a hearing date after you have filed.  It is important 
that you check with your local Court Administration to see how to schedule a hearing for an 
eviction expungement motion.  If you do not schedule a hearing, the court will not do anything 
with your motion.   
 

14

  Then you can write in “To Be Determined” in the “Notice” section of your Notice of 

Motion and Motion for Expungement of Eviction Record (HOU502).  Note: It is okay to 
fill in the name and address of the courthouse.    

  Later on, once you do have a hearing date, you will need to fill out the Notice of Hearing 

form (CIV604) and serve that form on the landlord (See Step 7 below).   
 

Step 4 

Make Copies

Affidavit in Support of Motion for Expungement of Eviction Record, and any attachments for 
each party, including yourself.  Be sure to bring your copy with you to court when you go to the 
hearing.   
 

Step 5 

Serve Notice on the Other Party 

The other party must receive notice of the hearing and complete copies 
of all documents you have prepared for the eviction expungement 
hearing.  This is called “service of process.”  The papers can be served 
personally (handed to the other party), or by mail.  The other party must 
receive the papers at least 21 days before the hearing.     If papers are 
served by mail, Court Rules require adding 3 days, so that papers must 
be postmarked at least 24 days before the hearing.   

If the other party is 
represented by an 
attorney, serve the 
other party’s attorney, 
instead of the party 
directly.   

apers CANNOT be served on legal holidays as defined in Minn. Stat. § 645.44, subd. 5 

(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44#stat.645.44.5).

look it up online at www.mncourts.gov/publicaccess.  

5.  Date and sign the form, then print the requested information.  

6.  Make one copy of this Notice of Hearing form for each party (including for yourself).  

7.  Arrange to serve a copy of the Notice of Hearing form on the other party like you did 
with the Notice of Motion and Motion for Expungement of Eviction Record.  See Step 
5 above.  

8.  File the original Notice of Hearing form and Affidavit of Service form (for the other 

party or other party’s attorney, if represented) with Court Administration.  

Step 9 

Go to Your Hearing 

  
To prepare for your hearing, it is a good idea to look at the court rules that apply to civil cases.  
You can find links to these rules online at http://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Civil-
Actions.aspx#tab06RulesAndLaws.  You could also visit a law library to read the court rules.  
  
You must go to court on the date set for the hearing.  It is important to be on time.  If you are 
even a few minutes late, the judicial officer may dismiss your motion.   

ring copies of the paperwork with you to the hearing.  If you are unsure how to prepare for the 
hearing, or what evidence you should bring, you should get legal advice before your court date.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
