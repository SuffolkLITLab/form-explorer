IMPORTANT NOTICES 

•  You CANNOT use these forms if there is already a Court Order awarding custody. 

If your child is the subject of a child in need of protection or services (CHIPS) 
proceeding or certain delinquency proceedings, the Court may be not able to 
immediately decide your request to establish custody. 

  Court personnel and the county attorney’s office CANNOT help you fill out court 

form(s).  

  You should see a lawyer if you do not know how to answer the questions on these 

forms or if you think the other party will hire a lawyer.  

The Court expects every person who appears in court without a lawyer to know and 
follow the law. If you act as your own lawyer, you must do what a lawyer would do.  

Type your answers or print neatly using dark ink.  

If you need more space to answer a question use an additional full sheet of paper. 
 

•  Where to Get a Certified Copy of the Recognition of Parentage (“ROP”)

Parenting time is the time a parent spends with the children, regardless of who has custody of the 
child.  If you are asking for joint physical custody, check the boxes to grant parenting time to the 
Mother and Father.  If you are asking for sole physical custody, check the box to grant parenting 
time to the other parent.  Or, if you think your children would not be safe alone with the other 
parent, you can ask the Court to make parenting time “supervised.”    NOTE: Supervised 
parenting time is not likely to be ordered unless unsupervised visits will cause harm to the 
children.  If you check “deny parenting time,” you are asking that the court give the other parent 
NO parenting time.     

Child support is money parents pay for the care, support, and education of the children.  It may 
include a monthly court ordered amount for basic support, child care support, and medical 
support.  The MN Department of Human Services (DHS) has created a child support calculator 
to estimate the amount of child support that the court may order on a case.  The calculator is on 
the DHS website at http://childsupportcalculator.dhs.state.mn.us/.   

Check the first box if there is no existing child support order and you want the Court to establish 
child support.  Check the second box if you are not asking the Court to establish child support.  
Check the third box if there is an existing child support order for the children and fill in all of the 
information (County, State, court file number). 

ILL OUT PARAGRAPHS 1-6 where it says “The Respondent requests that the Court grant the 

following relief.” 

Check the same box as you checked in Paragraph 7a. 
Check the same box as you checked in Paragraph 7b. 
Check the same box as you checked in Paragraph 10. 
Only check this box this box if you checked the first box in Paragraph 11. 
You do not have to write anything for this paragraph. 
Read a. through d. carefully. By signing your name you are telling the Court that you are telling 
the truth and that you have a good faith reason for your requests. If you are not telling the truth 
or if you are misleading the Court or if you are serving or filing this document for an improper 
purpose, the Court can order you to pay money to the other party or impose other sanctions. 

ill in your address and phone number.  Then date and sign the Answer and Counter-Petition to 

Establish Custody form. 
 

Step 2 
Complete the Financial Affidavit for Child Support Form  

f child support is being requested, fill out the form called Financial Affidavit for Child Support. This form 
asks for your income information. The Financial Affidavit for Child Support has separate instructions that 
you should read. It is very important to attach to the Financial Affidavit for Child Support any proof you 
have regarding your income. This proof may include the last 3 months of pay stubs, income tax returns, or 
other documents. Make sure the copy of the Financial Affidavit for Child Support you provide to the other 
party also has copies of your proof of income included.

Step 3 
Complete Confidential Information Forms 

OTE!    Most documents filed with the court are considered public documents and are available 
to the public.  Certain information that is filed with the court may be considered 
confidential based on court rule and not available to the public.  To keep this 
information confidential and not available to the public, you must take certain steps 
that are described below. 

The steps listed below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  Filers who are 
using eFS to submit their court documents must identify and designate their filings as 
required in Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 11.03 and 14.06.   

onfidential Information Form 11.1 

All social security numbers, employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers (also 
called “restricted identifiers”) must not be listed on papers you file with the court. This is to protect your 
privacy, the other parties and your children.   Only provide social security numbers, employer 
identification numbers, and financial account numbers when the court requires this information to be 
provided to the court.  For example, if you must provide the court with bank account numbers, or 
medical account numbers, do not include any account number in your document (your motion, 
supporting affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you must use Form 11.1 to list these confidential numbers.  

If account numbers are not required to be provided to the court, and the numbers appear on documents 
that are considered available to the public, (such as medical invoices or credit account numbers on 
statements) you must remove the number on the document before filing the document with the court. 

over Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-public 
documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the time you file 
the documents with the court.  You must complete and file the “Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents 
Form 11.2 (also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public documents.  The most common 
non-public documents are called “financial source documents.”  Examples of financial source 
documents include: 
•  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and business expenses 
•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers

ou may also need to submit other documents that court rules identify as non-public documents, such as 

a medical record.  For example, a report from a doctor that provides a medical diagnosis or treatment 
plan for you or your child would qualify as a medical record.   

You must use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing other non-public documents, such as medical 
records, with the court.  One Form 11.2 cover sheet can be used for submitting all non-public 
documents.   

The failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being rejected by 
court administration, being available to the public, stricken from the court record, and 

sanctions from the court. 

ee Rule 11 of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice for more information about how to file 

documents containing social security numbers, financial account numbers, “financial source documents” 
and other non-public documents.   

Form 11.1 and Form 11.2 can be found at www.mncourts.gov/forms under the court forms category of 
“Confidential Information” and is court form number CON111 and CON112. 

Step 4 
Make Copies of Forms 

.  Make two (2) copies of the following documents: 

 

•  Answer and Counter-Petition to Establish Custody and Parenting Time,  
•  Financial Affidavit for Child Support (if applicable), and 
•  All attachments.  

Keep one copy of each form for yourself (make sure you bring your copies with you to Court. 

Step 5 tells you how to serve the second copy of each form upon the other party. Step 7 tells you 
how to file the forms with the Court. 

Step 5

A complete copy of all documents you have prepared must be served on the other party. This is called 
"service of process." Papers cannot be served on legal holidays.

http://www.mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=19&p=69. You need to fill out the forms and sign them. 
Your fee waiver forms will be reviewed by a judge who will determine whether you must pay the filing

Step 8 
Appear in Court 

ou should receive a document from the court that contains the court file number for your case and 
other important information.  There could be a court date already set, or you may need to call the court 
to ask about scheduling a court date. 

irst Court Date 

When your first court date is scheduled, there are things you can do to prepare:  

•  Plan to arrive at least 15 minutes before your court time.    
•  Bring with you to the hearing your copies of the papers you filed with the court.  
•  Do not bring children to the first hearing, unless the court administrator/deputy tells you to. 
•  Do not bring witnesses and evidence to the first hearing, unless instructed to by the court 

administrator/deputy. 

ustody Evaluations 

On many occasions at the end of the first court date, the judge will ask for a custody evaluation in order 
to have someone gather facts to help the judge make a decision.  A custody evaluation may take several 
days, and you must pay the cost of the evaluation.   

his is a formal process. You are expected to know and follow the court rules of procedure.  You 
should be respectful to the other party and to everyone in the courtroom.  Do not interrupt the judge or 
other party.  Try to stay calm, and avoid unnecessarily criticizing the other party.  Answer any questions 
from the judge honestly. Direct all your comments to the judge or judicial officer, not the other party. 

inally, be aware that this matter may be scheduled for a Settlement Conference. The purpose of the 
Settlement Conference is to facilitate discussions with a judge in settling the case before trial. Each of 
you will be expected to be present at that Settlement Conference, along with the person who completed 
the custody evaluation. You will be expected to seriously consider settlement proposals that would be in 
the best interests of the child/children.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
