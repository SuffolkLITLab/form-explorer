IMPORTANT NOTICES 
 

OTE: If all of the above statements are true AND you and the other parent agree on 

all issues regarding custody, parenting time, and child support, then you can use 
the Joint Petition forms, which are available online at 
http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=4&p=121.  

Use the Forms to Establish Custody and Parenting Time only if:  

         1.   You are the child’s parent, and  

2.  At the time of the child’s birth you and the other parent were not married to each other, 

3.  You have signed and filed a Recognition of Parentage with the Minnesota Department 

4.  There is no court order deciding custody and / or parenting time rights. 

of Health, and 

and 

  N

  Use these instructions for completing the following forms, which are required to be filed with 

the court when requesting an order establishing custody and parenting time:   

o  Summons to Establish Custody and Parenting Time, CHC102;  
o  Petition to Establish Custody and Parenting Time, CHC103;  
o  Affidavit in Support of Establishing Custody and Parenting Time, CHC105. 

  The Recognition of Parentage (“ROP”) must be signed by both parents; you must have a 

certified copy of the Recognition of Parentage.  

 

•  Where to Get a Certified Copy of the Recognition of Parentage  (“ROP”) 

Certified Copies of the Minnesota Recognition of Parentage and Non-Paternity Statement 
can be obtained by completing and notarizing the required form provided by the Minnesota 
Department of Health.  You can get the form from the Minnesota Department of Health 
website at https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/vitalrecords/childsupport/formrequest.html, 
or you can call 651-201-5970 to request a copy of the form.  There is a fee for a certified 
copy.  The completed form and fee should be mailed to: 

Minnesota Department of Health 
 Recognition of Parentage Program 
Office of the State Registrar 
 P.O. Box 64499 
 St. Paul, MN 55164-0499 

Signing a “ROP” Now 
If you do not have an “ROP” but you and the other parent are willing to sign one now, you can 
get  a  form  “ROP”  from  your  local  Child  Support  Enforcement  Office.    The  form  must  be 
signed, notarized, and filed with the Minnesota Department of Health.  Signing a “ROP” has 
serious legal consequences and you should understand those consequences before signing the 
“ROP.”

If you do not have an “ROP” and you or the other parent are unwilling to sign one now, you 
or the other party can apply for paternity establishment services with your local county child 
support enforcement office.   
 
If you have a Declaration of Parentage or a Birth Certificate naming the father but you do 
not  have  a  “ROP,”  you  cannot  use  this  packet.    You  can  ask  the  other  parent  to  sign  a 
Recognition  of  Parentage  now.    If  that  is  not  possible,  you  must  file  an  action  to  establish 
paternity.  You may want to seek legal advice from a private attorney or other legal services 
provider for more information. 
 

•  If the Child is in Danger 

In extremely rare cases, a judge will change custody on a temporary basis before a full hearing 
with live testimony has been held.  Those rare cases involve situations in which the child is in 
immediate, significant danger if the existing custody arrangement continues.  If your child is 
in immediate danger, you may seek legal advice from a private attorney or other legal services 
provider;  contact  social  services;  seek  an  Order  for  Protection;  or  request  an  emergency 
expedited hearing.   

lease Note:  An Order for Protection (OFP) might be available in extreme situations, but an 
Order for Protection will not permanently decide custody.    You can get help with Orders for 
Protection from the court administrator’s office or local domestic abuse advocacy programs.   

f you choose to request an emergency expedited hearing, you will need to draft your own court 
forms or seek help from a private attorney or other legal service provider, as there are no court 
forms available from court administration or on the public website.   

If your child is the subject of a child in need of protection or services (CHIPS) proceeding or 
certain delinquency proceedings, the court may not be able to immediately decide your request 
to establish custody. 

  Court personnel and the county attorney’s office CANNOT help you fill out any court forms.  

  You should see an attorney if you do not know how to answer the questions on the forms or if 

you think the other party will hire an attorney.  

  The court expects every person who appears in court without a lawyer to know and follow the 

law.   

  Type your answers or print neatly using dark ink.  

If you need more space to answer a question, use an additional full sheet of paper. 

elpful materials may be found at your public county law library.  For a directory, see 
http://mn.gov/law-library/research-links/county-law-libraries.jsp.  For more information, 
contact your court administrator or call the Minnesota State Law Library at 651-297-7651.

the children and each parent, siblings, and other significant persons in the children’s life; 
j)  Write down what you see as the benefits of the children to maximize parenting time with 
each parent and the detriment to the children in limiting parenting time with either parent;

children; how you and the other parent will maximize the sharing of information and

parent plan to use for resolving disputes regarding any major decisions concerning the 
life of the children.  

 

5.  Parenting Time.  Check the appropriate box for parenting time as you did in Paragraph #10 
on your Petition. Fill out the parenting time schedule that you think is in the best interests of 
the children.  Clearly explain when each parent will have the children.  State the time when 
the children will transfer from one parent to the other.  If you want the order to say who will 
pick up and drop off the children, or where the transfer of the children should take place, 
include that in the section titled “Other.” 
 

6.  Overnights.  Based on the parenting time schedule you described in paragraph # 5, list the 

number of overnights the children will have with each parent each year.   

a.  The number should add up to 365.  If parenting time is equal, use 182.5 

overnights for each parent. 

b.  If one parent’s parenting time is reserved, that parent has 0 overnights. 
c.  “Overnight Equivalents” may count towards annual overnights.  They may be 

used if a parent has significant time periods on separate days where the children 
are with the parent yet do not stay overnight. 

If you need help calculating the number of overnights: 

•  Look at the FAQs (frequently asked questions) of our “Child Support” Help Topic 
online at http://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Child-Support.aspx#tab02Faqs, and 
•  Look at the handout called “Calculating the Number of Overnights,” which is found 
at 
online 
http://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/scao_library/SelfHelpCenters/documents
/Handout-Calculating-the-Number-of-Overnights-(002).pdf    You  can  also  find 
help  on 
the  Minnesota  Department  of  Human  Services’  website: 
https://mn.gov/dhs/people-we-serve/children-and-families/services/child-support/.  

.  Check the appropriate box that tells the court and the other parent what type of parenting 
time you want and how that is in the best interest of the children.  The court will grant 
parenting time that enables the children and the parents to maintain a parent-child 
relationship that will be in the best interest of the children.  If you are requesting supervised 
parenting time or other limits, write in the things that have happened and are likely to happen 
that will put the children’s emotional and physical health in danger, or will impair the 
children’s emotional development if the parenting time is unsupervised.  Write in the name 
of the person or agency that you would like to supervise the parenting time.

or  #  28,  write  in  any  additional  information  you  think  might  be  helpful  to  the  court  when  it 

considers your request to establish custody and parenting time. 

Most documents filed with the court are considered public documents and 
are available to the public.  Certain information that is filed with the court 
may be considered confidential and not available to the public.  To keep this 
information confidential and not available to the public, you must take 
certain steps that are described below. 

The steps below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  Filers who are 
using eFS to submit their court documents must identify and designate their 
filings as required in Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 11.03 and 14.06.   

Step 4 
Fill out the Confidential Information Forms (CON111 and CON112) 

OTE! 

  N

onfidential Information Form 11.1 

All social security numbers, employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers 
(also called “restricted identifiers”) must not be listed on papers you file with the court. This is to 
protect your privacy, the other parties and your children.   Only provide social security numbers, 
employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers when the court requires this 
information to be provided to the court.  For example, if you must provide the court with bank 
account numbers, or medical account numbers, do not include any account number in your 
document (your motion, supporting affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you must use Form 11.1 to list these 
confidential numbers.  

If account numbers are not required to be provided to the court, and the numbers appear on 
documents that are considered available to the public, (such as medical invoices or credit account 
numbers on statements) you must remove the number on the document before filing the 
document with the court.

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-
public documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the 
time you file the documents with the court.  You must complete and file the “Cover Sheet for 
Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 (also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public 
documents.  The most common non-public documents are called “financial source documents.”  
Examples of financial source documents include: 

•  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and business expenses 
•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers   

ou may also need to submit other documents that court rules identify as non-public documents, 
such as a medical record.  For example, a report from a doctor that provides a medical diagnosis 
or treatment plan for you or your child would qualify as a medical record.   

You must use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing other non-public documents, such as 
medical records, with the court.  One Form 11.2 cover sheet can be used for submitting all non-
public documents.   

The failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being 

rejected by court administration, being available to the public, stricken from the 
court record, and sanctions from the court. 

See Rule 11 of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice for more information about how to file 
documents containing social security numbers, financial account numbers, “financial source 
documents” and other non-public documents.   

Fill out the Confidential Information Form (Form 11.1) (CON111) and the Cover Sheet for Non-
Public Documents Form (Form 11.2) (CON112) according to the Instructions (CON110).  These 
forms are available online: 

•  CON110 – http://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/CourtForms/CON110.pdf?ext=.pdf

Collections Services office) if you or the other party receives public assistance, or if 
you have applied for child support services from the county.  See Step 6

.  Keep one copy of each form for yourself (make sure you bring your copies with you to the 

court date). 

Step 6 tells you how to serve a copy of each form upon the other party. Step 8 tells you how 
to file the forms with the court. 

Step 6 
Serve Notice on the Other Parent / Public Assistance Notice 

ou  must  arrange  for  the  other  parent  to  receive  complete  copies  of  all  documents  you  have 
prepared. This is called "service of process." A party to an action is not allowed to serve the 
other party. You must have someone else who is 18 years of age or older serve the other parent. 
Papers CANNOT be served on a legal holiday.  

ersonal service:  The other party is personally served by someone else (friend or family 

member, sheriff, or process server) hand-delivering the forms and supporting documents to the 
other party personally or by leaving them at that party’s place of residence with some person 
who is of suitable age or discretion who also lives at the same residence.    

o you or the other party receive public assistance or child support services from the State? 
If either you or the other parent has applied for or is receiving public assistance benefits from the 
State  of  Minnesota,  such  as  MFIP,  Tribal  TANF,  General  Assistance,  Medical  Assistance, 
MinnesotaCare, or Child Care Assistance, or is receiving child support services, you must notify the 
county child support office of your custody action.  

•  Fill out the form called Notice to Public Authority (DIV813).  
•  Make a copy of the Notice. Hand-deliver or mail the copy of the Notice to Public Authority to 
the  County  Support  and  Collection  Services  office  for  the  county  paying  the  assistance  or 
providing child support services. You may deliver or mail the copy yourself, or ask someone 
else to do it for you.  

•  The person who delivered or mailed the copy must fill out the Affidavit of Service to Public 
Authority (DIV816) stating when the Notice was served on the county attorney’s office. The 
Affidavit must be signed under penalty of perjury.  

•  You will file the Notice to Public Authority and Affidavit of Service to Public Authority with 
the court when you file the Summons, Petition, and Affidavit in Support of Establishing Custody 
and  Parenting  Time.    You  must  also  arrange  for  the  county  attorney’s  office  to  receive 
complete copies of all forms and supporting documents you have prepared.    

Step 7 
The Person Who Served the Papers Fills Out the Affidavit of Service Form 
(SOP102) 

fter the papers are served on the other party, the person who served the papers must fill out the 

Affidavit of Personal Service form (SOP102), which is available online at 
http://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/CourtForms/SOP102.pdf?ext=.pdf. This form is 
evidence that the papers were served on the other parent.  

Fill in the top part of the form the same as you did for the Summons and Petition

Fill in the name and birth date of the server. 
 
Fill in the date the papers were handed to the other party. 

Fill in the address where the documents were served. 

Fill in the name of the other party. 

The person who served the papers signs the Affidavit under penalty of perjury.  By signing 
the  Affidavit  under  penalty  of  perjury,  the  server  is  stating  that  the  information  in  the 
Affidavit is true to the best of his / her knowledge.  Perjury is the crime of intentionally lying 
or misrepresenting the truth, punishable by jail or other sanctions.  After it has been signed, 
make  one  copy  of  the  Affidavit  of  Personal  Service  for  your  records.  You  will  file  the 
Affidavit with the court as part of Step 8. 

Step 8 
File the Forms with the Court 

ile the documents with the court. Make sure you have a copy of each document for your records.  

ou can file the forms with the court in the following ways: 

In person at the courthouse;  

• 
•  By mail; or 
•  Electronically through the eFS System (NOTE: once a party files electronically, they are 
required to use the eFS System throughout the entire case; this means they cannot go back 
to  paper  filing  in  that  case).    For  more  information  about  electronic  filing  and  the  eFS 
System, see https://minnesota.tylerhost.net/.    

here is a court filing fee.  Contact court administration to find out the amount of the filing fee, 

or look online at http://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Court-Fees/District-Court-
Fees.aspx?cat=dissolution/custody&cookieCheck=true.    

• 

• 
• 

If you file in person, payment can be in the form of a credit/debit card, money order, cash, 
or check.   
If you file by mail, payment can be in the form of a money order or check. 
If you file electronically (eFile), you must use a credit card or debit card, even if you ask 
for a fee waiver.   

f you are asking for child support, you must file copies of all supporting documents (such pay 
stubs, employer statements, tax returns, verification of medical/dental insurance costs or expenses, 
child care expenses, disability payments) and complete and file with the court one Form 11.2 for 
supporting documents that contain confidential information (see Step 4).  Check your documents 
to make sure all blanks are filled in.  All papers served must be identical copies of the forms and 
supporting documents filed with the court. 

OTE:  If you fail to use the Form 11.2 cover sheet to protect confidential information in your 
supporting documents, the court may order you to pay additional court costs or other sanctions as 
a penalty for failing to follow the court rules.

f you cannot afford to pay the fees, a judge may waive it under certain circumstances.  Ask the 
court  clerk  for  an  In  Forma  Pauperis  (IFP)  application,  or  find  the  IFP  application  online  at 
http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=19&p=69. You need to fill out this application and file it 
with  court  administration.  This  application  will  be  reviewed  by  a  judge  who  will  determine 
whether you must pay the fees.  If the judge does not sign the form to waive the fees, you must 
be prepared to pay the fees or court administration cannot accept your forms.   
 

Step 9 
Appear in Court 

fter  you  file  your  papers  with  the  court,  you  should  receive  a  document  from  the  court  that 
contains the court file number for your case and other important information.  There could be a 
court date already set, or you may need to call the court to ask about scheduling a court date. 

ou must go to court on the date set for the hearing. 

•  Plan to arrive at least 15 minutes before your court time.    
•  Bring with you to the hearing your copies of the papers you filed with the court.  
•  Do not bring children to the first hearing, unless the court administrator/deputy tells you 

to. 

f the other party disagrees with your request, there will usually be two court hearings.  At 
the first hearing, the judge will only consider the written affidavits you and the other party 
filed.  The first hearing is short.  Usually, the judge will not listen to live testimony at the first 
hearing.  You will only have the opportunity to make a brief statement summarizing your position.  
However, if you have requested an emergency hearing and claim the children are in immediate 
danger, you may have to testify at the first hearing and have your witnesses.  If you are not sure 
whether to bring witnesses to the first hearing, call the court administrator’s office. 

he  hearing  is  very  formal.    You  are  expected  to  know  and  follow  the  court  rules  of 
procedure.  You should be respectful to the other party and to everyone in the courtroom.  Do not 
interrupt the judge or the other party.  Try to stay calm, and avoid unnecessarily criticizing the 
other party.  Answer any questions from the judge honestly.  Direct all your comments to the judge, 
not to the other party. 

fter the hearing, the judge will issue an Order.  The judge may issue the Order at the end of the 
hearing or may send a copy of the Order to you in the mail (or, if you have eFiled your forms, then 
you may receive a copy of the Order through the eFS System). 

ustody Evaluations 

On many occasions at the end of the first court date, the judge will ask for a custody evaluation in 
order to have someone gather facts to help the judge make a decision.  A custody evaluation may 
take several days, and you must pay the cost of the evaluation.  If a custody evaluation is ordered, 
the gap between the first short hearing and the second evidentiary hearing often will be at least 
several months.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
