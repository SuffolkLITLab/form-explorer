General Information about the Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea and Vacate 
Conviction Packet 

The information contained in this document is not intended as legal advice but as a general guide to 
you to explain the legal process.  If you do not understand any of these procedures, talk to an 
attorney.  Court staff cannot give legal advice. 

You may be able to use this packet IF: 

•  You were charged with an offense, and a guilty plea was entered because: 

o  You did not appear or respond; OR 
o  You paid all  or part of the fine; OR 
o  You pled guilty before a judge or hearing officer and a petty misdemeanor sentence 

was imposed; OR 

o  You entered into a continuance for dismissal  which was later updated to reflect a 

guilty plea and petty misdemeanor conviction; 

•  Now you want the court to reopen your case. 

IMPORTANT:  It is strongly recommended that you get legal advice (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Find-
a-Lawyer.aspx).  If you do not know if you should use these forms, what you should write in your 
forms, or want the forms reviewed by an attorney, you should get legal advice. 

AND 

 

Step 1 

Gather Important Information and Contact Court Administration  
about a Hearing Date 

Gather Important Information 
You are going to need the following information: 

•  A court file number (also known as a case number); and 
•  The name and address of the prosecutor.  You may be able to locate this information on the 

“Register of Actions,” which is available at the courthouse and online. 

To find the “Register of Actions” online, go to Minnesota Judicial  Branch - AccessCaseRecords 
(mncourts.gov).  Click  on “Minnesota District  (Trial) Court Case Search.”  If you read and accept the 
terms and conditions of use, you can search court records online. 

Contact Court Administration 
It is important that you check with your local  Court Administration  (mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx) 
to see how to schedule a hearing for your motion.  If you do not schedule a hearing, the court will

Rev 5/22                 www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 2 of 6 

not do anything with your motion.  You will write the hearing date on the Notice of Motion and 
Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea and Vacate Conviction (See Step 2 below). 

Step 2 
Fill Out the Notice of Motion and Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea and Vacate 
Conviction (CRM1002) 

The Caption  

1.  At the top of the page, write: 

a.  The county where the case is located; 
b.  The Judicial District number (each county belongs in one of ten judicial  districts.  If 

you need help, see http://www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx); and 

c.  Your court file number (this usually starts with a two-digit number, followed by 

letters and numbers; for example, 88-VB-17-1234). 

d.  The case type has already been filled in for you. 

2.  Write your name on the line for “Defendant.”   

The Notice of Hearing 
Fill  in the details of the hearing (date, time, location). 

The Motion 
Explain why you are asking the court to withdraw your guilty plea and to have your conviction 
vacated. 

Signature Block 

When you sign the form, you are signing under penalty of perjury.  Perjury is the crime of 
intentionally lying or misrepresenting the truth.  By signing under penalty of perjury, you are stating 
that information in your form is true and correct to the best of your knowledge. 

Date and sign the form.  Then write the names of the county and state you are in when you signed 
it, and print your personal contact information below your signature. 

Step 3 

Make Copies 

You will  need to make one copy of the Notice of Motion and Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea and 
Vacate Conviction for the prosecuting authority and one copy for yourself.  Be sure to have your 
copy with you at the court hearing. 

Next, you have to arrange for the prosecuting authority to be served with a copy of the form. 

Instructions – Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea and Vacate Conviction 
CRM1001      State       ENG 

Rev 5/22                 www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 3 of 6 

Step 4 
Arrange for Service 

Service of Process 
You must arrange for the prosecuting authority to receive notice of the hearing and copies of all 
documents you have prepared for the hearing.  This is called “service of process.”  For more 
information, see the “Service of Process” Help Topic  on the court’s website at Minnesota Judicial 
Branch - Service of Process (mncourts.gov). 

NOTE: Papers cannot be served on a legal holiday as defined in Minn. Stat. § 645.44,  subd. 5 
(revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44#stat.645.44.5). 

Service must be completed by either service by mail or personal service. 

Service by Mail 
You or another adult with need to mail a copy of the Notice of Motion and Motion to Withdraw 
Guilty Plea and Vacate Conviction (and any attachments) to the prosecuting authority. 

Personal Service 
You or another adult  will  hand to someone in the prosecuting authority’s office a copy of the Notice 
of Motion and Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea and Vacate Conviction (and any attachments). 

Step 5 
Affidavit of Service (Proving the Prosecuting Authority Was Served) 

After the paperwork is served on the prosecuting authority (not before), the server must fill out the 
Affidavit of Service form (SOP105) (mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=33&f=147).   

Caption 
Fill  out the form’s caption the same as you did for the Notice of Motion and Motion to Withdraw 
Guilty Plea and Vacate Conviction. 

Part 1: Information about the Server, What Was Served, and Who Was Served 
In this section of the Affidavit of Service, the server needs to fill in 5 things: 

1.  Server’s name; 

 

Instructions – Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea and Vacate Conviction 
CRM1001      State       ENG 

Rev 5/22                 www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 4 of 6 

2.  Server’s date of birth (to show that the server is at least 18 years old); 
3.  The date the server either mailed or hand-delivered the papers; 
4.  The names of the papers that were served (Notice of Motion and Motion to Withdraw Guilty 

Plea and Vacate Conviction, and any attachments); 

5.  A check mark or “x” showing which party was served (for this form, the “Petitioner/Plaintiff” 
box should be checked).  The Plaintiff (State of Minnesota) is represented by the prosecuting 
authority, and that is who has to be served. 

Part 2: How the Other Party Was Served 
Service by Mail 

If the server mailed a copy of the papers to the prosecuting authority, the server should fill out the 
“Mail  service” section of the Affidavit of Service (SOP105). 

The server needs to do 4 things in this section if the prosecuting authority was served by mail: 

1.  Check the box next to the words “Mail service”; 
2.  Write the name of the prosecutor (the name that was put on the envelope); 
3.  Write the address that the papers were mailed to; and 
4.  Write the city, state, and zip code that the server was in when they mailed the papers. 

Personal Service 

If the server hand-delivered a copy of the papers to the prosecuting authority, or to an employee in 
the prosecutor’s office, then the server should fill out the “Personal service” section of the Affidavit 
of Service (SOP105). 

The server needs to do 2 things in this section if the prosecuting authority was personally served: 

1.  Check the box next to the words “Personal service”; 
2.  Write the name of the person the server gave the papers to. 

Part 3: Signature Block 
The server has to sign the Affidavit of Service form under penalty of perjury, and then fill  in the 
county and state they were in when they signed the Affidavit of Service, and personal contact 
information. 

After the server signs the Affidavit of Service (SOP105), make one copy for your records.  The 
original  is filed with the court as part of Step 6 below. 

Step 6 
File with Court Administration 

You will  need to file the following with Court Administration: 

Instructions – Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea and Vacate Conviction 
CRM1001      State       ENG 

Rev 5/22                 www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 5 of 6 

•  Notice of Motion and Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea and Vacate Conviction; and 
•  Affidavit of Service. 

IMPORTANT!  The forms must be filed before the hearing date, or your hearing may be cancelled.  
Contact your local  court administration  to find out how many days before the hearing the forms 
must be filed. 

Step 7 
Attend the Hearing 

To prepare for your hearing, it is a good idea to look at the court rules.  You can visit a law library 
(mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Law-Libraries.aspx) to read court rules. 

You must attend court on the date set for the hearing.  It is important to be on time.  If you are even 
a few minutes late, the judicial officer may dismiss your motion. 

Have your copies of the paperwork with you when you attend the hearing.  If the prosecuting 
authority has served you with a responsive motion, be prepared to talk about your response at the 
hearing.  If you are unsure how to prepare for the hearing, or what evidence you should bring, you 

should get legal advice (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx) before your court date.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
