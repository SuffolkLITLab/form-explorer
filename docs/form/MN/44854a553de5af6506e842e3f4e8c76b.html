Fourth Judicial District (Hennepin) Supplemental Name Change Guide  

pouses:  Married couples  may apply jointly  for a change of name in the same 

application.  Each person  changing  their  name should  include  a separate  proposed 
order with the application. 

on-Citizens: You do not have to be a U.S. citizen to request  a name change for 
yourself or your child. If you are not a citizen,  you must contact the Department  of 
Homeland  Security – U.S. Citizenship  and Immigration  Services (USCIS) to determine 
any special  requirements  they may have. 

ackground  Check: The judge  assigned  to your name change case may require you to 

take additional  steps  regarding  your criminal history. For example, a judge  may require 
you to obtain  your background  check from the  Bureau of Criminal Apprehension,  1430 
Maryland Avenue, St. Paul, MN 55106,  and bring  it to your name change  hearing.   
When you schedule  your name change hearing,  ask the judge’s  clerk whether the judge 
will require  this background  check. 

f Only One Parent is Applying for a Minor Child’s Name Change: Minnesota  law 
states  that no minor child's name may be changed  without  both parents  having  notice. 
The applicant  must show proof that  the non-applicant  parent(s)  has received notification 
of the Application  for Name Change  of a Minor. 

he applicant  does  not need to send  notice to the non-applicant  parent  IF ALL the 

statements  below are true: 

1.  The non-applicant  parent  is not listed  on the birth certificate; AND 
2.  The applicant  was not married to the non-applicant  parent  at the time the child 

was born or within 280 days of the birth (this  includes  attempted  marriages);  AND 

3.  The non-applicant  parent  never signed  a “Recognition  of Parentage;”  AND 
4.  There is no court order determining  the non-applicant  parent is a legal  parent.

f notifying the non-applicant  parent is required,  follow the instructions  below: 
  

• 

If you know the address  of the non-applicant  parent:  

1.  Get a hearing  date.  See section  below,  “Schedule a Name Change 

Hearing.” 

NAM101 - Supp. 

Dist4   ENG   Rev 1/23 

www.mncourts.gov/forms 

Page 1 of 4  

2.  Send a certified letter  (return receipt requested)  to the parent  indicating  the 

date,  time, place, and  purpose  of the hearing.  Include  a copy of the 
Application  for Name Change  of a Minor. 
3.  File an Affidavit of Service with the court. 
4.  Bring the certified mail receipt with you to the hearing  with a copy of the 

letter.  If the non-applicant  parent  signed  the return receipt, bring  the return 
receipt to your court hearing  as proof to the judge  that the non-applicant 
parent  received notice of the name change  proceedings. 

 

• 

If you do not know the address  of the non-applicant  parent(s): 

1.  Schedule  and attend  your hearing.  See section  below,  “Schedule a Name 

Change  Hearing.” 

2.  The judge  may ask about: 

▪  Your last contact with the non-applicant  parent; 
▪  Information indicating  that you are unaware  of the whereabouts  of 

the non-applicant  parent,  and 

▪  What efforts you have made to contact the non-applicant  parent.  If 
ordered  by a judge,  you may be required  to submit an affidavit 
regarding  this information. 

▪  A judge  may require  you serve the non-applicant  parent  by 

alternative  means  or publish  a Notice of Hearing by Publication. 

 

Best Interest Factors for a Minor Name Change: If you are asking for a minor’s name 
to be changed, the judge  will consider  these  factors: 

1.  The child’s  preference; 
2.  The effect of the change of the child’s surname  on the preservation  and 

development  of the child’s  relationship  with each parent; 

3.  The length  of time the child has  borne a given name; 
4.  The degree  of community respect  associated  with the present  and the 

proposed  surname; 

5.  The difficulties, harassment  or embarrassment,  that the child may experience 

from bearing  the present  or the proposed  surname. 

roperty Owners: If you or your minor child has interest  in any real property, you must 
list  the legal description  of the property on your name change application.  This  is not the 
address.  You can find the legal  description  on the deed, contract for deed, or mortgage. 
DO NOT use  the description  found on your tax returns. 

f the property is in Hennepin  County, you can get the legal description  from the  
Real Estate  Services Office by calling 612-348-3011.  If the property is in another 
county, you must get the legal description  from the Property Recorder of that county. 

irth Record Change Requests:  Sometimes, the Minnesota  Department of Health  will 

change information  on a birth record, and  you won’t need  to go to court. The MDH

about  this option.   

f you need a court order:

•  And you are asking  for a name change  with birth record changes,  you can use 

•  And you are not asking  for a name change,  you can use the Motion (NAM113) 

and Order (NAM114) to Replace Birth Record. 

our paperwork must explain to the court what you want changed and  why. Requests  to 

change a birth record are not automatically  granted.  Your request  could be denied  by 
the judge. 

f you are requesting  a court order for the sex/gender  marker change,  you should  come 
to court with written medical certification of appropriate  clinical treatment  for gender 
transition.  This  should  be an original  letter  from a licensed  physician. 
 

•  Note about Parents:  You can use the name change process  to change the 

name of the parents  if: 

o  The parent’s  name is misspelled;  OR 
o 

if the parent changed  (or is changing)  their name and now wants their new 
name on their child’s  birth record. 

he name change process  cannot change who is listed  on the birth record. If you are 
looking  to change  the parent listed  on your birth record, please  get legal  advice. You 
can find a list  of legal  resources  on the Find a Lawyer Help Topic (mncourts.gov/Help-
Topics/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx)  on the MN Judicial Branch website. 
 

•  Note about Out of State Birth Records. You may ask for your out-of-state  birth 
record to be amended,  and a judge  may recommend that the other state  update 
your record. However, some states  may not accept an order  from Minnesota  to 
update  the birth record. It is up to you to reach out to the other state  to ask if 
they will accept an order from Minnesota.   

ee Waiver:  If your income is low and your name change request  has  merit, the court 

may waive or reduce the filing fee. To ask for this, you must fill out the fee waiver 
paperwork (mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=19&p=69)  (IFP forms) and  turn it in with 
your name change paperwork.  IFP forms are available  at the Self-Help Center or online 
at mncourts.gov/forms (mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx)  (click on “Fee Waiver / In Forma 
Pauperis.”) 

urn in (File) Your Original Name Change Paperwork with the Court: File  your 
paperwork with Civil Filing,  either in-person,  by mail, or electronically.  There will be an 
initial  filing fee. You must have the fee (cash, check, money order, or credit) or an IFP

300 South  6th Street,  Room C-300 
Minneapolis,  MN 55487 

chedule  a Name Change  Hearing: Within  2 weeks after filing your papers,  the court 
will send  you a letter telling  you which judge  has  been assigned  to your case, and  the 
judge’s  clerk’s phone  number. Call the judge’s clerk  to schedule  a hearing. If there 
are other parties  you need to serve (for example,  a non-applicant  parent),  ask for a 
court date that is at least  30 days away so you have enough  time to give everyone 
notice. Make sure  you write down the date and time of the hearing.  If you need an 
interpreter,  let the clerk know. 
  
Go To Your Court Date: Be on time! You will need to bring two witnesses  to the 
hearing.  Your witnesses  can be anyone  who has known you for at least  one year. If you 
are married, one witness  can be your spouse.  If you are requesting  the name change  of 
a minor, the minor should  attend  the hearing. 

et a Certified Copy of the Order: You will need  a certified copy of the Court’s order 

to change important  documents (such as MN I.D. or driver’s license,  social  security 
card, bank account, etc.). If you requested  a birth record amendment and the judge 
granted  it, you will need  a certified copy of the  Court’s order to apply for the new birth 
certificate through  the Minnesota  Department of Health.  There are copy fees. You can 
also  find a list of other suggested  items to update  in the Notice to Persons  Who Have 
Had Their Name Changed  (mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=27&f=301)  (NAM106).

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
