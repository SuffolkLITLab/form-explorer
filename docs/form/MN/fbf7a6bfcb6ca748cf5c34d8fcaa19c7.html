here Do We File? 

File in the County where you or your spouse lives now. To file for Marriage Dissolution 
(Divorce) in Minnesota, you must have lived in Minnesota for at least the past 180 days.  There 
is a limited exception to the residency requirements for same sex couples who were married in 
Minnesota but no longer reside in Minnesota.  See Minn. Stat. § 518.07, subd. 2 (2013).  Court 
administration staff cannot assist you with questions on where to file your dissolution action.  
You may wish to seek legal advice if you have questions. 

ho Can Use this Form? 

You can use this form if you and your spouse agree on everything and there are no children born 
to you and your spouse before or during the marriage, or adopted into your marriage.  This form 
may not address all of your needs or concerns. Real estate, pensions, businesses, and other types 
of property can be handled many different ways. There may be serious negative consequences 
and tax implications from your decisions on how to divide your property and handle the issues in 
your divorce.  

hese forms and instructions do not explain the many legal and financial issues involved in 

divorce and cannot warn you of specific problems.  Please see an attorney if you have questions. 

o not use this form if:  

a)   You and your spouse are not in agreement on all issues, or 
b)  Your spouse will not agree to sign the forms under penalty of perjury, or 
c)   you and your spouse have a child together (a child is defined as a person under age 
18, or under age 20 and still in high school, or a person over 18 who by reason of 
physical or mental condition are incapable of self-support), or 

d)  A spouse is pregnant, or 
e)   A spouse has given birth to a child since the marriage date. 
However, this form may be used 

• 

• 

if there is a child born during the marriage and there is no husband of the 
marriage, or  
if a spouse had a child with another man while married to current husband, you 
can use this form if: 

  There is a Paternity Order naming another man as the father, OR 
  The spouse who gave birth to a child and the biological father have a 

signed Minnesota Recognition of Parentage (ROP) and the husband has 
signed Husband’s Non-Paternity Statement (HNPS). 
If applicable, a certified copy of the Paternity Order or the ROP and HNPS must be 
submitted to the court with the Joint Petition.  Certified copies of the ROP and HNPS are 
available from the MN Department of Health by sending them a Request for Certified 
Copies form.  For more information see: 
https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/vitalrecords/rop.html.

n same sex marriages, a child conceived or born during the marriage that is not legally adopted 
by the other spouse, may or may not be presumed to be the legal child of both spouses. Ask a 
lawyer for advice. If both spouses claim to be the legal parents, the divorce "with children" forms 
are probably most appropriate, but changing the forms may be required.

illing out the forms: 

Print very neatly or the court may return your forms to you.  Use black or dark blue ink.  Because 
both parties agree to dissolve the marriage, both parties are called “Co-Petitioner” and it makes 
no difference which party is listed first.  Whoever is listed first will be referred to as “Petitioner 
A” and the other party will be referred as “Petitioner B” in the Joint Petition for Dissolution of 
Marriage without Children.  Answer every question completely.   You must disclose all financial 
information so the Judge can determine if your proposed division of property and debt is “fair 
and equitable.”  Include property/debts you own separately and together.  For example, if you 
have a car and only your name is on the title, you still must list the car.  

nformation you will need: 

•  Pay stubs or tax return for you and your spouse 
•  Medical Insurance information 
•  Records of bank accounts and investments 
•  Pension information 
•  Legal description of any real estate and details about the mortgage and value of the real 

•  Descriptions of vehicles, their value and monthly payment amounts and total owed  
• 

Information about credit card and other debt. 

estate   

ublic Assistance 

Question 11 asks about “Public assistance” paid by the State of Minnesota. Public Assistance 
means MFIP, Tribal TANF, General Assistance, Minnesota Care, Medical Assistance, or Child 
Care Assistance.  Check YES or NO.  If YES, write in the name of the county paying the 
assistance.  Minnesota law requires you, as the filing party, to notify the public authority paying 
assistance that you are filing a divorce action.  Use the form called “Notice to Public Authority” 
(Court Form DIV813) to notify the county of your divorce action. Hand-deliver or mail the copy 
of the Notice to Public Authority to the County Support and Collection Services office for the 
county paying the assistance. You may deliver or mail the copy yourself, or ask someone else to 
do it for you. The person who delivered or mailed the copy must fill out the Affidavit of Mailing 
or Delivery stating when the Notice was served on the Public Authority. The Affidavit must be 
signed under penalty of perjury.  By signing under penalty of perjury, you are stating that the 
information in the document is true to the best of your knowledge.  Perjury is the crime of 
intentionally lying or misrepresenting the truth.  You will file the Notice to Public Authority and 
Affidavit of Service with the court when you file the Summons and Petition. The county attorney 
for the public authority may need to sign off on the Joint Petition and Agreement before being 
submitted to the court for the court’s approval and signature.  Be sure to contact the county 
attorney’s office to arrange for the county attorney to review your Joint Petition and Agreement.   

o You Want to Change Your Name? 

You and/or your spouse can ask for a legal change of name in the Joint Petition.    If you want to 
change your name and you have been convicted of a felony, you must get the handout “Felon 
Name Change Instructions” and follow the steps in the handout.   

o You or Your Spouse Own Real Estate?

You must include real estate that you and your spouse own together, separately, or with other 
people.  WARNING:  Be sure to copy the legal description exactly as it is on the Deed, Contract 
for Deed, or Certificate of Title.  You must fill out Attachment “C,” which is included at the 
back of the Joint Petition without Children.  You will need to make a copy of Attachment “C” if 
there is more than one property that must be listed.  Use a separate Real Estate Attachment sheet 
for each parcel of real estate.  Use the correct legal description – do not guess or abbreviate. 
There are many ways to handle real estate and many potential problems. You should talk to an 
attorney if you own real estate. For example, you may want the real estate awarded to one person 
with a lien in favor of the other person.  An attorney can help you understand the legal 
consequences and necessary language.  

nswering the Income Questions: 

Questions 12 and 14 ask for monthly gross income (before taxes and deductions). 
Do not guess at income. Look at your pay stub or tax return.   
If you are paid monthly, enter the amount shown on your paycheck for gross income.  
If you are paid twice a month, multiply gross income by 2 to get the monthly amount. 
If you are paid every two weeks, multiply gross income by 2.17 to get the monthly amount. 
If you are paid every week, multiply gross income by 4.33 to get the monthly amount. 
If you are self-employed, or you work only part of the year, or your earnings vary, divide your 
yearly income by 12 to reach an average monthly income figure and write on the petition that 
you are averaging your income. 

 

odifying the Joint Petition 

You may make changes to the Joint Petition to fit your situation, but do not omit any paragraphs. 
It is recommended that you consult with an attorney before making any changes to the Joint 
Petition. 

onfidential Information 

NOTE! 

Most documents filed with the court are considered public documents and 
are available to the public.  Certain information that is filed with the court 
may be considered confidential based on court rule and not available to the 
public.  To keep this information confidential and not available to the public, 
you must take certain steps that are described below.   

The steps listed below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  Filers 
who are using eFS to submit their court documents must identify and 
designate their filings as required in Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 11.03 and 14.06.   

Confidential Information Form 11.1 

All  social  security  numbers,  employer  identification  numbers,  and  financial  account  numbers 
(also called “restricted identifiers”) must not be listed on papers you file with the court. This is to 
protect your privacy, the other parties and your children.   Only provide social security numbers, 
employer  identification  numbers,  and  financial  account  numbers  when  the  court  requires  this 
information to be provided to the court.  For example, if you must provide the court with bank 
account  numbers,  or  medical  account  numbers,  do  not  include  any  account  number  in  your

document (your motion, supporting affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you must use Form 11.1 to list these 
confidential numbers.  

If  account  numbers  are  not  required  to  be  provided  to  the  court,  and  the  numbers  appear  on 
documents that are considered available to the public, (such as medical invoices or credit account 
numbers  on  statements)  you  must  remove  the  number  on  the  document  before  filing  the 
document with the court. 

Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-
public documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the 
time you file the documents with the court.  You must complete and file the “Cover Sheet for 
Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 (also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public 
documents.  The most common non-public documents are called “financial source documents.”  
Examples of financial source documents include: 

•  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and business 

expenses 

•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers   

You may also need to submit other documents that court rules identify as non-public documents, 
such as a medical record.  For example, a report from a doctor that provides a medical diagnosis 
or treatment plan for you or your child would qualify as a medical record.   

You  must  use  the  Form  11.2  cover  sheet  when  filing  other  non-public  documents,  such  as 
medical records, with the court.  One Form 11.2 cover sheet can be used for submitting all non-
public documents.   

The  failure  to  use  Form  11.2  or  Form  11.1  may  result  in  your  document  being 
rejected  by  court  administration,  being  available  to  the  public,  stricken  from  the 
court record, and sanctions from the court. 

See Rule 11 of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice for more information about how to file 
documents containing social security numbers, financial account numbers, “financial source 
documents” and other non-public documents.   

Form  11.1  and  Form  11.2  can  be  found  at  www.mncourts.gov/forms  under  the  court  forms 
category of “Confidential Information” and is court form number CON111 and CON112. 
What to Do After Completing the Forms 
Both spouses must sign the “Joint Petition, Agreement, and Judgment and Decree.”  It is not 
necessary for both spouses to sign the document at the same time, but both spouses must sign 
under penalty of perjury.  By signing under penalty of perjury, you are stating that the 
information in the document is true to the best of your knowledge.  Perjury is the crime of 
intentionally lying or misrepresenting the truth.

•  The completed “Joint Petition, Agreement, and Judgment and Decree,” including: 

o  Attachment A (Division of Assets and Value); 
o  Attachment B (Division of Liabilities/Debt); and 
o  Attachment C (Real Estate Attachment), even if neither party owns real estate; 

•  “Form 11.1: Confidential Information” with names and social security numbers. 

f you are submitting non-public documents such as paystubs or bank records in paper form, you 
must file “Form 11.2: Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents.” 

ay:  The District Court filing fee. 

ait:  You are not divorced until the Judge signs the Decree and the Court Administrator 
“enters” the Decree. Wait to receive a letter from the Court telling you that you are divorced.  
You will not attend a court hearing unless the Judge decides a hearing is necessary.   

f you have real estate, there are additional steps you must take to transfer the title to the party 
who was granted the real estate in the divorce.  
Under Minnesota law, both spouses have an interest in real estate, even if only one spouse’s 
name is on the deed or title of the property.  

Proof of divorce and proof of who was awarded interests in the real estate is usually recorded 
in the real estate records before selling or mortgaging the property after the divorce. 

To give that proof, the complete divorce decree can be filed in the real estate records. Or, a short 
version  of  the  divorce  decree  can  be  filed,  called  Summary  Real  Estate  Disposition  Judgment 
Form  (SREDJ).  The  SREDJ  only  includes  information  needed  for  real  estate  title  purposes.  If 
you  file  the  SREDJ,  information  about  your  children,  work,  and  other  personal  matters  is  not 
available  in  the  county  real  estate  records.    The  Minnesota  Judicial  Branch  publishes  a  set  of 
instructions to help you with the SREDJ process. Those instructions can be found on the court’s 
website at http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=15&f=572.  

Questions? 
If you have questions about the Joint Petition, you probably need to ask an attorney or 
accountant.  Court staff can give you limited help with procedures.  Only an attorney can give 
you legal advice. 
 

 
Helpful materials may be found at your public county law library.  For a directory, see

your court administrator or call the Minnesota State Law Library at 651-297-7651.
