      <pre>Information about Conciliation Court 

he information contained in this document is not intended as legal advice but as a general 
guide to you to explain the legal process.  If you do not understand any of these procedures, 
consult an attorney.  This office cannot give legal advice. 

hat is conciliation court? 

Minnesota  statute  491A.01  created  the  conciliation  court  -  also  called  small  claims  court.  This 
court  allows  citizens  to  bring  their  legal  claims  to  court  without  expensive  costs  or  complicated 
legal procedures. 

o you have a claim to file in conciliation court? 

You can file a claim in conciliation court for an amount up to $15,000.00, or $4,000.00 if the claim 
involves  a  consumer  credit  transaction.    This  is  the  limit  set  by  law.  You  cannot  file  a  claim 
involving  title  to  real  estate,  libel,  slander,  class  actions  or  medical  malpractice  in  conciliation 
court. 

onciliation court will not accept a claim that exceeds the dollar limits as set forth above.  If you 
reduce  your  claim  to  the  limit  of  conciliation  court,  you  cannot  claim  more later. This  rule may 
apply to any other claims related to the same incident.  Obtaining a judgment in conciliation court 
may prevent you from bringing any other claims based on the same transaction or occurrence. 

n  deciding  whether  to  file  your  claim,  be  aware  that  obtaining  a  judgment  in  conciliation  court 
does not guarantee payment.  As you attempt to collect the judgment, you will have out of pocket 
expenses for filing fees, transcription costs and other costs of collecting a judgment.     

ote:  Only a business or government entity  may be represented in conciliation court by a 
someone  who  is  not  a  lawyer  (a  “nonlawyer”).    A  power  of  attorney  form  does  not 
authorize  a  nonlawyer  to  file  a  claim,  appear,  or  in  any  other  way  “represent”  a 
natural person in conciliation court. 

here do you file a claim in conciliation court? 

The person against whom you are making a claim is called the defendant and you must file your 
complaint  in  the  county  where  the  defendant  lives.    You  may,  however,  seek  recovery  for 
dishonored checks in the county where the check was issued.  You may make a claim for unpaid 
rent or return of a security deposit in the county where the rental property is located.  You may sue 
corporations  in  the  county  where  their  business  office  or  branch  office  is  located.    IT  IS  YOUR 
RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE THE CORRECT COUNTY FOR FILING YOUR CLAIM. 

ow do you file a claim in conciliation court? 

If  you are filing the  claim,  you are the plaintiff in the action.   The person you file against is the 
defendant. The form for filing your claim is available from any court administrator's office or on-
line  at  www.mncourts.gov/forms.    If  you  have  difficulty  completing  the  form,  you  may  contact 
court administration for assistance.  You must have the following information:

• 
•  The amount of your claim  
•  The reason for the claim and the date your claim arose 
 

You must sign the claim under penalty of perjury and pay the current filing fee.   By signing the 
claim under penalty of perjury, you are stating that the information in the claim is true to the best 
of your knowledge.  Perjury is the crime of intentionally lying or misrepresenting the truth.  The 
amount of the filing fee will be added to your claim. 

fter  you  have  filed  your  claim,  it  must  be  served  on  the  defendant.  For  cases  under  and  up  to 
$2,500.00, the court administrator's office will serve the claim on the defendant by first class mail 
or by any electronic means of delivering notice as authorized by Rule 14 of the General Rules of 
Practice for the District Courts.  The summons shall include the date and time that the case will be 
heard.  You will also receive a notice from the court as to the date and time of the hearing.  For 
claims  over  $2,500.00  or  if  service  cannot  be  made  by  first  class  mail,  the  court  administrator’s 
office will give you instructions as to how service must be performed.  Many cases settle when the 
defendant receives notice of the hearing.   

t is your responsibility to inform the court administrator in writing if you and the defendant settle 
your case.  If you and the other parties agree on a settlement prior to the hearing, each party who 
has  made  a  claim  or  counterclaim  must  promptly  tell  the  Court  in  writing  that  the  claim  or 
counterclaim  has  been  settled  and  that  it  may  be  dismissed.    You  may  notify  the  court  by 
completing  and  filing  with  the  court  the  Notice  of  Settlement  section  on  the  Statement  of  Claim 
form.   

hat happens if a defendant files a claim against you? 

The defendant may file a claim against you.  This is called a counterclaim.  The defendant must file 
the claim at least 7 days before the date set for a hearing. 

he defendant will pay a filing fee and the court administrator will notify you if a counterclaim is 

filed. The counterclaim will be heard at the same date and time as your claim.   

f the counterclaim is more than the dollar limits as set forth above, your claim will be transferred 
to district court and you will be notified if a transfer is needed.  If the defendant then fails to file the 
counterclaim  in  district  court  after  giving  notice  of  intent  to  do  that,  you  may  have  your  claim 
reinstated in conciliation court.  You may do this any time after 28 days and before 3 years expire 
by  filing  an  affidavit  with  conciliation  court.    The  affidavit  must  say  that  the  defendant  has  not 
served you with a district court summons stating his counterclaim. 

hat if the hearing date is changed? 

The court administrator may change the hearing date if there is good cause for a continuance, but 
only if you request a different hearing date at least five days prior to the scheduled hearing.  The 
court administrator may change only one hearing date per party.  All other requests for a change 
of hearing date must be determined by the judge.  All parties will be notified by the Court of any

new hearing date.  The Court in its discretion may assess costs of not more than $50.00, either 
absolute or conditional, to the other party as a condition of granting an order for a continuance of 
any case. 

ow do you prepare for the hearing? 

Conciliation court hearings are informal, but you must be prepared to present your case.  Attorneys 
are only allowed to represent parties in conciliation court with permission of the court.   All parties 
and witnesses who appear will testify under oath.   The witnesses should be present and ready to 
testify.  If a witness is reluctant to appear, you may get a subpoena to compel them to appear.  You 
can  get a  subpoena  from the  court  administrator’s office.   You will need one subpoena for each 
witness  you  want  to  testify.  There  is  a  fee  for  each  subpoena  requested.  Written  statements  and 
affidavits of persons not present in court have very little value. 

f  you  plan  to  submit  any  documents,  photos,  etc.  to  the  judge  for  consideration,  YOU  MUST 
BRING 2 EXTRA COPIES TO THE HEARING.  If you request court administration to make your 
copies when you arrive for the hearing, you will be charged for copies.  You should also bring to 
court all other evidence, such as receipts, repair bills, estimates, and other items to help prove your 
claim.  If the defendant or some other person has documents relating to your claim that they will 
not give to you, you can get a subpoena to require the person to provide the documents.  

efore you go to court, prepare a list of facts you wish to present.  Organize your presentation as 

clearly and completely as possible so you will not forget important facts and details.    

n your assigned court date and time, prior to calling your case and hearing testimony, the judge 
may ask you to speak to the other parties in your case to determine if you can reach any agreements.   

f  you  have  exhibits  or  informational  items  related  to  your  case  which  fall  within  the  hazardous 
exhibit  policy,  you  are  required  to  properly  secure  those items  before  offering  it  to  the  judge  for 
inspection.  Check with court administration for the complete policy regarding hazardous exhibits.  
If you have exhibits which are bulky, you may not be allowed to enter through the security system 
and should consider other options which can include taking photographs of that exhibit for the judge 
to review.  

hat happens if you do not appear for the hearing? 

All  parties  must  appear.    Failure  of  defendant  to  appear  at  the  hearing  may  result  in  a  default 
judgment being entered for the plaintiff.  Failure of the plaintiff to appear may result in dismissal 
of the action or a default judgment being entered in favor of the defendant on any counterclaim that 
has been filed.   

hat happens after the hearing? 

After hearing the evidence, the Judge will either issue an order right away  or take the case under 
advisement and issue an Order at a later date.  The parties will be notified by mail or by electronic 
means  as  authorized  by  Rule  14  of  the  General  Rules  of  Practice  for  the  District  Courts  of  the 
Judge’s decision.  If a party changes his or her address, the Court must be notified. 

he judgment will not become effective until 24 days after mailing the notice or 21 days if notice

you to appeal or make a motion to vacate the judgment.  The court may vacate the judgment and 
order a new hearing if a party that did not appear has a good reason for not appearing.  Before it 
grants a new hearing, the court may require the party who did not appear to pay costs to the other 
party.

ow do I pay the judgment? 

You  must  make  arrangements  to  pay  the  judgment  directly  to  the  creditor  (the  party  you  owe 
money to).  Remember judgment records are public and credit bureaus routinely take information 
from them.  If your judgment is not paid before it becomes final, it may have an adverse affect on 
your credit rating.  If you make good faith efforts to pay the judgment and are not successful or the 
creditor refuses to accept your payment, you may bring a motion to allow payment to be made to 
the court administrator.  You may pay all or any part of the judgment to the  court administrator 
instead  of  paying  the  creditor  directly  only  if  the  court  issues  an  order  that  allows  you  to  make 
payments to the court administrator. 

hen you pay the creditor, obtain a statement of payment called a Satisfaction of Judgment from 
the  party  you  paid  and  file  it  with  the  court.    If  this  is  not  done,  your  record  will  show  an 
unsatisfied judgment, which may affect your credit rating.   

ow do I collect a conciliation court judgment? 

Although a case was decided in your favor, it is not always easy to collect a judgment.  You cannot 
collect assets that a person or business does not have.  The collection process will be worthwhile 
only if you can locate collectable assets.  Once a judgment is entered, the judgment is enforceable 
for 10 years from the date of entry.   

onciliation court is not a collection agency and cannot assist  you in locating assets of the other 
party.  You can, however, try to collect the judgment yourself if it has not been paid by the date 
indicated on the judgment notice, and if an appeal has not been filed.  Here are a few tips on how 
you can locate the debtor and/or their assets: 

  You may be able  to locate the debtor’s bank  by looking at any canceled checks that  you

  C

Paying, Collecting,  and Appealing a Conciliation Court Judgment 

might have written to the debtor. 
 

  You can find out whether the debtor has a motor vehicle registered under his/her name, or 
the name of the lender that the debtor is doing business with, by submitting a record request 
form to the Minnesota Driver and Vehicle Services.  The form is available at DVS offices 
or on the web at: http://www.dps.state.mn.us/dvs/PDFForms/DVSFormFrame.htm. 

 

When your judgment is final, the appeal time has expired,  and the judgment debtor has not paid 
you, you may choose to have the judgment enforced by following these steps: 
 

1.  Request  a  transcript  of  your  judgment  from  conciliation  court.      File  the  transcript  of 
judgment with district court.  To docket your judgment, which will allow you to have the 
judgment enforced, you must file an Affidavit of Identification.  Ask court administration 
for an Affidavit of Identification form, or go to www.mncourts.gov/forms.   Be prepared to 
pay  any  statutory  fee  for  transcribing  the  judgment.    These  fees  will  be  added  to  the 
judgment  and  will  be  collected  from  the  judgment  debtor  if  assets  are  found.    Checks 
should be made out to the “Court Administrator.”  Your judgment will then be entered and 
docketed  in  district  court.    This  creates  a  lien  against  abstract  real  estate  owned  by  the 
debtor  in  this  county.    You  may  wish  to  file  a  lien  against  torrens  real  estate  that  the

Rev 1/20 

 

www.mncourts.gov/forms 

Page 5 of 7 

judgment debtor owns by contacting the county recorder of the county where the real estate 
is located.  A docketed judgment also affects the judgment debtor’s credit rating. 
 

2.  You may request court administration to issue a Writ of Execution if you know where the 
debtor banks or where the debtor works.  There will be a fee charged for the writ.  If you do 
not know either of these you are not ready for an execution.  The execution must be issued 
to the county where the bank or the employer is located.  The court administrator’s office 
will send the execution to you and you are to take it to the sheriff of that county for service.  
The sheriff will charge a fee. 
 

3.  If you do not know where the debtor works or banks, you may file a Request for Order for 
Disclosure.    There  is  a  filing  fee  for  each  involved  debtor’s  name.    The  court 
administrator’s  office  will  issue  an  Order  for  Disclosure  and  send  it  to  the  debtor  along 
with a Financial Disclosure form.  This order requires the debtor to disclose all non-exempt 
property and financial information to you within ten (10) days from receipt of the order.  If 
the Financial Disclosure form is served upon you by mail, three (3) days are added to the 
ten  (10)  days  to  complete  service.    It  is  your  responsibility  to  supply  the  court  with  a 
current address for the debtor. 

f  a completed Financial  Disclosure  form is received  from  the  debtor,  you  can then decide  what 
options are available for collection. 

f no answer is received, you can complete an Affidavit in Support of an Order to Show Cause, and 
schedule a court hearing before a judge.  When the hearing is scheduled, this office will then issue 
an Order to Show Cause.  A judicial officer may not issue an Order to Show Cause if service of 
the Financial Disclosure was undeliverable upon the judgment debtor.   It is your responsibility to 
have  the  debtor  served  with  the  Order  to  Show  Cause.    The  sheriff  or  any  party  who  has  no 
financial interest in the judgment can serve this order.  It must be served on the debtor personally.  
It cannot be left at his/her residence with anyone else. 

he Order to Show Cause requires the debtor as well as the creditor to appear at the court hearing.  
At the hearing, the debtor will be instructed to complete the Financial Disclosure form or give the 
judge a valid reason for not doing so.  If the debtor fails to appear at this hearing, the judge may 
issue  an  order  for  a  Writ  of  Attachment.    When  the  Writ  of  Attachment  is  issued,  you  will  be 
required to furnish a physical description of the debtor. 
 

4.  If  you  wish  to  have  the  cost  of  collection  added  to  your  judgment  after  an  unsuccessful 
attempt to collect, you  may  need to file  an affidavit stating the costs  and  requesting those 
costs be added to your judgment.  Please attach a copy of your receipt from the sheriff to 
your affidavit. 

.  If  the  debtor  pays  the  judgment  in  full  it  is  your  obligation  to  provide  the  debtor  with  a 
Satisfaction of Judgment.  This form can be obtained through this   office 
any 
legal stationery store.  A Satisfaction of Judgment must be filed with the court and a filing 
fee  must  be  paid.    This  must  be  done  within  10  days  if  paid  in  cash  or  within  30  days 
for another type of payment.

.  If  the  judgment  is  for  property  damage  sustained  in  an  auto  accident  with  an  uninsured 
driver,  you  may  wish  to  ask  the  Commissioner  of  Public  Safety  to  suspend  the  driving 
privileges  of  the  driver.    Conciliation  court  staff  can  help  you  do  this  after  your 
judgment becomes final. There is a fee for the certified copy that must be sent to DPS to 
suspend driving privileges.

f the sheriff or attorney is unable to collect, or if you have determined that there are no assets on 
which  you  can  collect,  it  does  not  mean  you  will  never  collect  your  judgment.    A  judgment  in 
conciliation court is valid for 10 years and may be executed on at any time during those 10 years.  
This is important because the debtor may, at some future time, have collectable assets.  The fact 
that an unpaid judgment may affect the debtor’s credit rating could result in voluntary payment at a 
later time. 

ow do you appeal a judgment of the conciliation court? 

Appeal procedures are more complex than conciliation court rules.  Although it is not required, it is 
suggested that the appealing party be represented by an attorney.  Court administration staff are not 
attorneys  and  cannot  practice  law.    Therefore,  they  cannot  assist  you  in  preparing  your  appeal.  
Some forms are available at the court administrator's office or online at www.mncourts.gov/forms.   

ny party who appeared at the conciliation court hearing and is dissatisfied with the conciliation 
court judgment may appeal to the district court.  To do this, you must file a Demand for Removal, 
an Affidavit of Good Faith, and an Affidavit of Service with the court  administrator within 21 
days of the date the judgment was mailed or sent electronically.  The appealing party must pay an 
additional  fee.  The  district  court  is  more  formal  than  conciliation  court  and  its  proceedings  are 
governed by the Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure.    

f  you  did  not  appear  and  a  default  judgment  was  entered,  you  will  have  to  get  the  judgment 
vacated.  Read your judgment notice carefully. 

hat happens upon an appeal? 

Filing an  appeal (removal)  means  a  completely new trial will take  place.     You  may file  a Jury 
Trial Demand if you wish the appeal be heard before a jury. An additional fee is required for a 
jury trial demand.  Attorneys may represent both parties.  If the appealing party is a corporation, 
the Demand for Removal must be signed by the party’s attorney.  You should not rely on anything 
that was said or that happened at the conciliation court trial.  Again, you should prepare to present 
your case, have your witnesses ready to testify, and have all your other evidence available.   

f you appeal and do not win, you may have to pay costs to the other party.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
