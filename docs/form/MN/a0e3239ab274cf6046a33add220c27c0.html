Important Notices 

  You can use these forms if:  A Court Order exists directing another person to do 
something, the person has personally received a copy of the Order, the person has 
disobeyed the Order and the person did not have a good reason for disobeying the 
Order.  Exception:  If your Divorce Decree orders your ex-spouse to pay you money 
as part of the division of your property, and not as support, and the money has not 
been paid, DO NOT use the civil contempt process.  Instead, go to the division of 
your  court  that  deals  with  civil  judgments,  show  them  your  Divorce  Decree,  and 
inquire  about  procedures  to  docket  a  judgment  against  the  other  party  for  the 
amount unpaid.  You then can use Collection procedures to try to get the money. 

  The court expects every person who appears in court without a lawyer to know the law.  

If you act as your own lawyer, you must do what a lawyer would do. 

  You  should  see  an  attorney  if  you  don't  know  how  to  answer  the  questions  on  these 

forms or if you think the other party will hire an attorney. 

  Court personnel and the county attorney's office cannot help you fill out these forms. 

  As you fill out the form(s), you MUST follow all of the instructions. 

  Type your answers or print neatly using dark ink. 

  If you need more space to answer a question, use an additional full sheet of paper.

INSTRUCTIONS 

 

What “Contempt of Court” Means 

Only  a  judge  can  determine  whether  someone  is  in  “contempt  of  court.”  “Contempt  of  Court”  is  a 
decision by a judge that someone who has been ordered to do something, knew about the Order, and has 
knowingly, and without good reason, disobeyed the Order.  Because  a judge can order the contemnor 
(the person who disobeyed) to be put in jail until they or obeys the Order, extra safeguards are built into 
the procedures to ensure that the person who might be put in jail is treated fairly. 

ARNING: When asking the court to find someone in Contempt of Court, it is very important to 
follow the procedures set out in these instructions. If you do not follow them, the court may not 
give  you  what  you  want,  even  if  the  other  person  has  disobeyed  the  prior  order  without  good 
reason. 

Two-Part Hearing Process Required 

he court cannot put a person in jail simply because you say the person disobeyed a 
court order.  In most cases there will be several hearings.  If you want the court to 
decide that the person is in contempt and that they be put in jail, then certain forms 
asking for a first-stage hearing must be served upon (given to) the other person and 
filed  with  the  court  (those  forms  are  listed  on  the  cover  page  of  the  these 
Instructions). 

First-Stage Hearing 

t the first hearing, the court will decide if: 

1.  The person knew the contents of the prior Order; 

2.  The person disobeyed the prior Order, but had a good reason for disobeying it; 

3.  The person disobeyed the prior Order and did not have a good reason for disobeying it.   

If  the  court  decides  that  the  person  obeyed  the  Order  or  that  the  person  disobeyed  the  Order  but  had 
good reason for disobeying it, then the motion for contempt will be denied.

If  the  court  decides  that  the  person  disobeyed  the  prior  Order  and  did  not  have  a  good  reason  for 
disobeying it, and if the court also decides that putting the person in jail will make that person obey the 
prior  Order,  the  court  must  tell  the  person  that  incarceration  is  a  possibility  and  advise  the  person  to 
obtain an attorney, and explain that if the person cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed. 

f the person wishes to talk with an attorney, a second hearing will be scheduled.  If the person waives 
his/her right to an attorney the court may conduct the hearing at that time.  The court may not punish a 
person and put them in jail for not following the order.  That would be a criminal matter.  The court may 
only  put  someone  in  jail  if  the  court  believes  the  person  has  the  ability  to  do  what  is  ordered  and 
willfully refuses to do it and that putting the person in jail will cause the person to obey the prior Order.   

f the court finds that the person knew the contents of the Order, willfully failed to follow it, and that jail 
or the threat of jail may reasonably cause compliance with the court Order, the court may immediately 
sentence the person to jail or may “stay” (not immediately enforce) the jail sentence to give the person 
time to “purge” (correct) the prior behavior by doing what the court Order required.  The court may also 
require  the  person  to  do  other  things,  such  as  pay  money,  cooperate  in  visitation,  follow  future  court 
orders, etc. 

Revocation Hearing 

f the Court sentences the person to jail, but gives the person a chance to purge the contempt and the 
person does not do what they were supposed to do to cure the problem, you may wish to have the person 
jailed.  If you want the person jailed, then certain forms asking for a hearing for revocation of the stay 
must be served upon (given to) the other person and filed with the court. 

t the revocation hearing the court will decide one of the following: 

1.  The person has purged (cured) the contempt; OR 

2.  The person has not purged (cured) the contempt, but jailing the person is not necessary to cause 

obedience and, therefore, the person will not be jailed; OR 

3.  The person has not purged (cured) the contempt, and jailing the person is necessary to make the 

person obey the Order and, therefore, the person should be immediately jailed. 

If the court decided to order the person to jail, that person must stay in jail until they purge the contempt 
by obeying the court Order (for example, by paying overdue support, or allowing visitation, or agreeing 
to  follow  all  future  court  Orders).    It  is  often  said  that  the  person  in  jail  “holds  the  keys  to  the  jail” 
because that person controls when they are released.

Step 1 
Fill Out the Notice of Motion and Motion for Contempt of Court Form 
for the First-Stage Hearing 

ill out the Notice of Motion and Motion for Contempt of Court form. This form tells the court and the 
other  party  what  you  think  the  other  party  has  done  to  disobey  an  existing  court  Order,  what  you  are 
asking for from the court, and the date and time of the hearing. 

ILL IN THE TOP PART OF THE FORM (this is known as “the caption”): 

OTE:  The  information  to  fill  in  the  top  part  of  the  form  can  be  found  at  the  top  of  your  current 
custody  order  or  your  divorce  or  paternity  decree  or  other  existing  Order.  Be  sure  to  copy  the 
information EXACTLY as it is on your current Order. 

  Write the case number, which is also called “the court file number.” 

  On the line marked “Name of Petitioner,” write the name of the Petitioner as listed on your current 

Order or divorce or paternity decree. 

  On  the  line  marked  “Name  of  Respondent,”  write  the  name  of  the  Respondent  as  listed  on  the 

current Order or divorce or paternity decree. 

  On the “TO” line, write the full name and street address of the other party. 

o not fill in the date, time, name of judge and location of the hearing yet. You will do that as part 

of Step 3. 
 

FILL OUT THE REST OF THE FORM: 

OTE:  The  instructions  that  follow  are  numbered  the  same  as  the  paragraphs/questions  on  the 

Notice of Motion and Motion form. 

.  Write in the name of the other party that you are asking the court to find in contempt. Write in the 
paragraph numbers that the other party has not obeyed and the date of that Order. After the word 
“by,” write in what the other party did that violated the Order.  Include the paragraph number and 
the actual language from the Order that sets forth the specific duty or obligation.  

.  You  do  not  need  to  answer  this  question  UNLESS  you  are  asking  for  something  else  from  the 
court  besides  a  finding  of  contempt  (for  example,  compensatory  visitation  or  a  change  in  the 
Order). List any other requests you are making of the court. 

.  You do not have to write anything for this paragraph/question. 

Read  the  Verification  and  Acknowledgment  carefully.  By  signing  your  name  you  are  telling 
the  court  that  you  are  telling  the  truth  and  that  you  have  a  good  faith  reason  for  your 
requests.  If  you  are  not  telling  the  truth  or  if  you  are  misleading  the  court  or  if  you  are

serving  or  filing  this  document  for  an  improper  purpose,  the  court  can  order  you  to  pay 
money to the other party or impose other sanctions. 

Date and Sign the Notice of Motion and Motion Form. 

Step 2 
Fill Out the Affidavit in Support of Motion Form 
 

Fill out the Affidavit in Support of Motion form, which tells the court and the other party what you are 
asking for from the court and WHY you are asking for it. 

•  Fill in the top part of the form (caption) the same way you did on the Notice of Motion and Motion 

form. 

NOTE: The instructions that follow are numbered the same as the paragraphs/questions on the 
Affidavit in Support of Motion form. 

1.  Write in your name at paragraph/question 1. 

2.  Check off whether you are the Petitioner or Respondent in this case as listed on your Divorce 

Decree or other existing Order.   

3.  On the blank line, fill in the name of the person you would like to have found in contempt. 

4. 

Fill in the date of the Judgment and Decree or Order that the other person has disobeyed.  Mark a 
copy of the Decree or Order as “Exhibit A” and attach the copy of the Order to this Affidavit.  Fill 
in the page and paragraph number(s) of the Order that the other party has disobeyed.  If there is 
more than one order, refer to Exhibit A, page ____, paragraph ____, then to Exhibit B, page____, 
paragraph ____, etc. 

5.  On the blank line, fill in the date that the other party was mailed or given a copy of the Order that 
the party disobeyed.  Check off which evidence of service exists.  You will probably need to look 
through the court file for evidence of service.  There should be an Affidavit of Service if the Order 
was mailed or handed to the other party.  There may be an Admission of Service, which is a paper 
signed by the other party admitting that they received a copy of the Order.  The other party may 
have admitted receiving a copy by signing an admission of receipt of copy statement on the Order 
or Decree.  If the party signed an admission on the Order itself, your copy of the Order attached as 
“Exhibit A” should show that signature.  That proves service.  If your proof of service is not on the 
Order itself, get a copy of the Affidavit of Service or Admission of Service and attach it to the 
Affidavit in Support of Motion.  The Affidavit of Service or Admission of Service should be in the 
court file.  To obtain a copy go to the Court Administrator’s office where the Order was issued.  
There will be a fee for obtaining a copy.  If the Affidavit or Admission of Service is not in the 
court file, it may be in the office file of the attorney who represented the party who asked the court 
for the Order. The attorney’s name and address should be in the Order.  Contact the attorney’s 
office for a copy of the Affidavit of Service.

IMPORTANT:  If you cannot prove that the other party received a copy of the Order or 
Decree, the court cannot find the other person in contempt. 

•  For the remaining paragraphs, fill out only those that apply to your situation. 

7-9 

These are for non-payment of child support. 

10-12  These are for non-payment of spousal maintenance.

•  Reminder:  The court cannot find the other party in contempt for failing to pay money (other 
than child support and spousal maintenance).  See the IMPORTANT NOTICES page of these 
instructions for information on obtaining a judgment. 

 

Sign the Affidavit in Support of Motion under penalty of perjury.  By signing your name under 
penalty of perjury, you are telling the court that you are telling the truth and that you have a 
good faith reason for your requests. If you are filing these documents just to harass the other 
party or without good legal reason, or if you mislead the court, the court can make you pay 
money to the other party.  Perjury is the crime of intentionally lying or misrepresenting the 
truth, punishable by jail or other sanctions. 

Step 3 
Fill Out the Order to Show Cause and Appear Form 

The Order to Show Cause and Appear is an order that tells the other party they must appear in court to 
explain to the judge why an order for contempt should not be entered against him or her.

in this case.  Fill in: 
•  The date, time, and court number (Fill this in later, as part of Step 4)  
•  The paragraph(s) the other person violated (same as on your Affidavit form).  
•  The date of the Order that the other person violated (same as on your Affidavit form).  
•  State exactly what the other party was ordered to do by copying the exact words from the 

Order the person violated. 

2.  You do not need to write anything for paragraph/question 2 through 5. 

Do not date or sign this order – the judge will do that.

Step 4 
Obtain from Court Administrator Hearing Date, Time and Location 

otice:  Read through Steps 4 and 5 now.   

When your Notice of Motion and Motion and Motion and Affidavit in Support of Motion have been 
completed, go to the Court Administrator’s office. The Court Administrator/Deputy will help you get a 
court date and time for your hearing. The hearing date should be scheduled no later than 60 days after 
the issuance of the notice of motion or order to show cause. 

Fill in the date, time, location, name of the judge and room number of the hearing on the first page of 
the Notice of Motion and Motion form. Fill in the date, time, location and room number on the Order to 
Show Cause form. 
 

Step 5 
Make Copies of Forms 

•  Make two copies of the Notice of Motion and Motion form and all attachments, and two copies of 

your Affidavit in Support of Motion form and all attachments. 

•  Keep one copy of each form for yourself (make sure to bring your copies with you to Court on the 

day of your hearing). 

•  Step 7 tells you how to serve the other party. Step 6 tells you how to file the forms with the court. 

Step 6 
Filing the Forms With the Court and Get Judge’s Signature on the  
Order to Show Cause and Appear Form 

ou must file your documents with the court and you will need to pay the filing fee. You can contact the 

Court Administrator’s office to find out the amount of the filing fee.   

If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, a judge may waive it under certain circumstances. Ask the 
Court Administrator/Deputy for an In Forma Pauperis application. You need to fill out this application 
and sign it under penalty of perjury. This application will be reviewed by a judge who will determine 
whether you must pay a filing fee.  If the judge does not sign the form waiving the fee, you must pay the 
filing fee or the Court Administrator cannot accept your forms. 

The Court Administrator/Deputy will arrange for the judge to review the Order to Show Cause and 
return it to you if the judge signs it.

Step 7 
Serve Notice on the Other Party at Least 21 Days Before the Hearing Date 

ou  must  arrange  for  the  other  party  to  receive  notice  of  the  hearing  and  complete  copies  of  all 
documents  you  have  prepared  for  the  hearing.  This  is  called  “service  of  process.”  Service  of  process 
MUST  be  completed  at  least  21  days  before  the  hearing  date,  (unless  the  judge  has  issued  an  Order 
stating some other requirement).  For example, if the hearing is September 30, the other party must be 
handed the papers on or before September 9.  

Ask a friend or relative or other person who is over the age of 18 to help you with service.  For an Order 
to Show Cause, the person serving the papers must bring the signed Order to Show Cause with them.  
The  person  must  hand  a  copy  of  the  Notice  of  Motion  and  Motion,  Affidavit  in  Support  and  Order  to 
Show Cause directly to the other party. Another person (such as a child or roommate) cannot accept the 
papers for the other party.  

If you do not have a friend or family member who will give the documents to the other party, you could 
call  a  private  process  server  (look  in  the  yellow  pages  under  “process  server”)  or  the  sheriff  in  the 
county where the other party lives to serve the papers. Private process servers and the sheriff charge a 
fee to serve papers. 

WARNING: You cannot give the documents to the other party. Someone else over the age of 18 
must hand-deliver the documents directly to the other party. The documents cannot be mailed to 
the other party. 

Note:    When  the  other  party  is  not  in  the  state  of  Minnesota,  you  may  have  the  person  served 
outside  of  Minnesota.   However,  if  the  person  does  not  personally  attend  the  hearing,  the  judge 
cannot find the person in contempt of court. 
 

Step 8 
The Person Who Handed the Forms to the Other Party Must Fill Out the Affidavit 
of Personal Service Form 

he Affidavit of Personal Service proves to the court that the other party received a copy of the Notice of 
Motion and Motion, Affidavit in Support of Motion, and Order to Show Cause. The person who handed 
the  forms  to  the  other  party  should  fill  out  the  Affidavit  of  Personal  Service  by  following  these 
instructions: 
• 

Fill in the top part of the form (caption) the same way as on the Notice of Motion and Motion 
form.  
After “I,” fill in the name of the person who handed the forms to the other party. 
Fill in the date of birth of the person who handed the forms to the other party.  
Fill in the date the documents were handed to the other party.  
Fill in the name of the other party.  
Fill in the address of where the other party was served.

the  Affidavit  is  true  to  the  best  of  their  knowledge.    Perjury  is  the  crime  of  intentionally  lying  or 
misrepresenting the truth, punishable by jail or other sanctions. 

•  After it has been signed, make one copy of the Affidavit of Personal Service for your records. 

Note:  You must file the signed Affidavit of Personal Service with the court. 
 

Step 9 
Receive the Other Party’s Response 

f the other party is going to respond to your Motion for Contempt of Court, by law they must respond at 
least 7 days before the hearing. The other party will respond by mailing or delivering a written response 
to you. If the other party responds but it is not at least 7 days before the hearing, the court has the option 
of not looking at or considering the other person’s papers during the court hearing. 
 

egardless of whether the other person does or does not respond in writing, YOU must go to court on 
the date set for the hearing and be on time. Bring with you to the hearing your copies of the papers and 
any witnesses you want to talk to the judge.  If you have been served with a response, you should write 
your response to it and be prepared to give that information to the judge and a copy to the other party at 
the hearing. 
 

Step 10 
Appear in Court 

Step 11 
Order for Contempt 

fter the hearing the judge will issue an Order.  The judge may issue the Order at the end of the hearing 

or may send a copy of the Order to you in the mail.   

If the court determines that the other party is in Contempt of Court, and decides to give the person a 
second chance to obey the Order before putting him/her in jail, the court then sets a return date to review 
the other party’s compliance with the new Order.  If the other party does not obey the new Order, you 
will want to appear in court on the new date to tell the judge.  If the court has not set a return date to 
review the other party’s compliance, you may bring a Motion to ask the court to impose the jail sentence 
because the person failed on his/her second chance. If you want the person jailed, ask for a second 
hearing following steps outlined herein for the first hearing.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
