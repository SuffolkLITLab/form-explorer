INSTRUCTIONS 
Application for Ex Parte Order Regarding Children’s Passports 

Important Notices and Resources 

The Court has forms and instructions, for some types of cases, as a general guide to the court process. These 
instructions explain the steps in more detail and answer common questions, but are not a full guide to the law. 
Court employees may be able to give general information on court rules and procedures, but they cannot give 
legal advice.  

Have questions about court forms or instructions? 

• Visit www.MNCourts.gov/SelfHelp 
• Call the MN Courts Self-Help Center at 651-435-6535 

Not sure what to do about a legal issue or need advice? 

• Talk with a lawyer 
• Visit www.MNCourts.gov/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx  

There are certain documents that parents must provide when applying for a passport for their child.  
One of these documents is an original or certified copy of the child’s birth certificate.  When a 
father’s name is listed on the child’s birth certificate, the federal government requires both parents 
to sign or give written consent before issuing a passport for that child.   

here are some exceptions when the consent of both parents is not required.  Under Minnesota 
law, a biological mother of a child born to a mother who was not married to the child’s father when 
the child was born or conceived has sole custody of the child until there is a court order that 
establishes custodial rights of the child’s father.   This means the father named on the birth 
certificate has no rights to custody of the child until there is a court order granting custody rights to 
the father, and the biological mother has sole legal custody.  If there is no court order granting sole 
legal custody to one parent and no custody action is pending before the court, the biological mother 
who has sole legal custody by law may request the court to issue an order that authorizes her to 
apply for a passport for her child without needing the consent of the other parent.

Instructions – Passport Only Relief 

You cannot use these forms if there is a court order granting custody of the child to you or any 
other person. 

f you are not sure if you have sole legal custody of your child, you may want to get legal advice.  
Visit www.MNCourts.gov/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx for legal resources.

Do you have more than one child? 

You can use this form for multiple children as long as the children have the same father.  If the 
children have different fathers, then you will need to use separate forms. 

The judge will need information about you and your children.  It is important to give complete and 
accurate information regarding the birth of your children, where you and your children live, and 
how long your children have  lived at the current address, and whether there are any other court 
orders or cases about custody of the children.     

 

Helpful materials may be found at your public county law library. For a directory, see 
http://mn.gov/law-library/research-links/county-law-libraries.jsp . For more information, 
contact court administration or call the Minnesota State Law Library at 651-297-7651.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
