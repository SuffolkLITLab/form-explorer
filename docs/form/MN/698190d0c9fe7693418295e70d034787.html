General Information about Levying on Earnings 
General Information About Levying on Earnings  

he information  in these instructions  is a general guide to you to explain  the legal process for 

levying  on earnings after winning  a judgment.  If you do not understand any of the following  steps 
or do not know if these forms are right for your situation,  you should  speak with an attorney for 
legal advice. Court staff cannot give legal advice. 

he execution levy process can be used to try to collect a judgment  awarded to you by the court. 

Even if you win a judgment  in court, it is not always easy to get paid. Sometimes a debtor’s 
income or assets are “exempt” (protected) from collection  under Minn. Stat. § 550.37 . To view a 
summary of property that is exempt from collection,  visit 
http://www.mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=24&f=392  .  

•  “Judgment” is a word that means “the judge’s decision” or “the judge’s order.” 
•  "Creditor" is the party who won the case and is owed money  (because a judgment  was 

awarded by the court). 

•  "Debtor" is the party who lost the case and owes money to the creditor.  
•  "Entry" or "Entered" is the word used when a judgment  is filed  in the case by the 

Court Administrator.  This usually  starts the timeframe during  which a judgment  can be 
appealed. 

•  "Docketed" or “Docketing” is the word used when the creditor files  an Affidavit  of 
Identification  form with  the court. Docketing  the judgment  is the first step a creditor 
takes when he or she wants to try to collect payment  of the judgment. 

•  “Levy” or “Execution Levy” is the action taken by the sheriff to collect money owed to 

xample:  The creditor  won the case against the debtor and a judgment  was entered. The 
creditor docketed the judgment  and set up an execution  levy  by the sheriff on the debtor’s 
earnings.  
 

A judgment  can be enforced at any time for ten (10) years from the date it was entered. It can also 
be “renewed” if not satisfied (paid) within  the 10 years.  

OTE: The steps listed below can be followed  to try to collect a judgment  when the debtor is 

employed  and you have information  about the debtor’s employer. If you do not know this 
information  about the debtor already, you will  not be able to levy on the debtor’s earnings until  you 
collect this information.  To read more about how to find out this information  through  the Financial 
Disclosure form (JGM301), visit  http://www.mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Judgments.aspx  .

3.  Fill  in the Court File  Number from the case where the judgment  was docketed. 

Sometimes  the court assigns a new Court File  Number  when a judgment  is docketed (for 
example,  the Court File  Number will  be different  for a Conciliation  Court case where a 
judgment  was entered than for the District  Court case opened to docket the judgment).  Be 
sure to enter the Court File  Number for the case where the judgment  was docketed.  
4.  Fill  in the case type. This will  generally  be “Civil,”  but in some cases it could  also be 

something  like  “Restitution  Judgment,”  “Dissolution,”  or “Support.”   

5.  Fill  in your first,  middle,  and last name as the creditor.  
6.  Fill  in the first,  midde,  and last name of the debtor.  
7.  Fill  in the name of the debtor’s employer.   

Date and sign  the form,  and fill  in your contact information.   

Do not fill  out any of the sections under “Judgment  Debtor’s Exemption  Claim  Notice.” This 
section is only  for the debtor to complete  and return to you  if the debtor is claiming  that his or 
her earnings are exempt from an execution  levy.   

Complete  the caption  (top part of the form) on the Earnings Execution Disclosure and Earnings 
Disclosure Worksheet form (JGM703  for non-child  support  judgments;  JGM704  for child 
support  judgments)  the same way as above. Do not fill  out any of the sections below the caption, 
because this  form is for the debtor’s employer  to complete.   

 

 

Sign and make copies of the Execution Exemption Notice and Notice of 
Intent to Levy on Earnings (JGM702) 

Sign  the Execution Exemption Notice and Notice of Intent to Levy on Earnings with your name, 
address, telephone  number,  and email  address. Make a copy to keep for yourself.

Step 3 

Serve the debtor with the Execution Exemption Notice and Notice of Intent 
to Levy on Earnings (JGM702)

The debtor must receive a copy of the Execution Exemption Notice and Notice of Intent to Levy 
on Earnings before earnings can start being  collected.  Delivering  the copy to the debtor is called 
“service of process.” 

These instructions  describe two ways to do “service  of process”: (1) Personal  Service, or (2)  Mail 
Service. You  can choose whichever service method  you prefer.  

1. Service of Process #1: Personal Service  

With  Personal  Service,  a third person (not yourself)  who is at least  18 years old  must hand  a copy of 
the Execution  Exemption  Notice  and  Notice  of Intent to Levy on Earnings  directly  to the debtor. 
Papers cannot be served on legal  holidays. 

2. Service of Process #2: Mail  Service 

With  Mail  Service, a third  person (not yourself) who is at least  18 years old  mails  the Execution 
Exemption  Notice  and Notice  of Intent to Levy on Earnings  to the last  known address of the debtor by 
first class mail.   

 

Step 4 

Get a Writ of Execution from court administration 

You must  wait 10 days if you had the Notice personally  served on the debtor, or 13 days if you 
served the debtor by mail.  If you do not receive a statement of exemption  from the debtor within 
this period,  you can contact court administration  in  the county where your judgment  was 
docketed and request a Writ of Execution.  Contact information  for court administration  in each 
county  can be found  here: http://www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx  (choose your county  from 
the drop-down  menu and click  “Go”).  

Court administration  will  charge a fee for issuing  the Writ of Execution,  but this fee can be 
added to the amount  of the judgment  owed. If you  cannot afford to pay this  fee, you can ask for a 
fee waiver by completing  the application  in the  In Forma Pauperis/IFP packet of forms (found 
online  at www.mncourts.gov/forms).  If a judge  does not sign  the order granting  you a fee waiver, 
then you must pay the fee before court administration  can issue the Writ of Execution.   

A Writ of Execution  is an order issued by District Court directing  the sheriff to collect  money to 
satisfy a judgment.  The Writ should  be directed  to the sheriff of the county  where the debtor’s 
employer  is located. For example,  if the debtor’s employer  is in Anoka County,  the Writ should

w ww.mncourts.gov/forms                  Page  5 of 7 

be directed to the Anoka County  Sheriff’s Department. A Writ of Execution  expires  180 days 
after the date it was issued by court administration.   

Step 5 

Deliver the Writ of Execution and other paperwork to the sheriff’s office 
for service 

hen you  get the Writ of Execution  from court administration,  you will  need to sign  it and 
deliver  it to the sheriff’s office that will  be collecting  the judgment  for you  (this is sometimes 
called  “conducting  a wage levy”). Along  with the writ,  you must give  the sheriff a blank 
Earnings Execution Disclosure and Earnings Disclosure Worksheet (JGM703 for non-child 
support  judgments  or JGM704  for child  support  judgments)  for the debtor’s employer.   

You must also give  the sheriff’s office a check for $15 written out to the debtor’s employer.  The 
sheriff will  give  the check to the employer  when they serve the Writ of Execution. The sheriff’s 
office may also require you  to pay a deposit  to help  cover its costs for executing  the Writ. 

Employers  can collect  earnings  for up to 90 days. At the end of this  period,  the debtor’s 
employer  will  send a check to the sheriff’s office for the amount  that has been collected.  If this 
check is not enough  to pay off the full  judgment  (called  “satisfying”  the judgment),  the sheriff’s 
office will  start a second 90-day  wage levy. After the second levy  is done, all  of the money  that 
was collected  is processed and a check will  be sent to you. If the amount  collected  is still  not 
enough  to satisfy the judgment,  you  will  need to get a new Writ of Execution  from court 
administration  to ask the sheriff to continue  the wage levy.  

If for some reason no funds are collected  in the wage levy,  a notice will  be mailed  to you stating 
the reason. You can then try to find  other assets the debtor may have that could  be used to pay 
the judgment.  See http://www.mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Judgments.aspx  for more information 
about how to start a levy  on the debtor’s bank or financial  institution.   

If you do not serve a Writ  of Execution  within  one year of serving  the Notice on the debtor, you 
will  need to serve a new Notice form before you can go ahead with  levying  on the debtor’s 
earnings.

Step 6 

Serve the debtor with copies of the Writ of Execution and any other 
paperwork served on the debtor’s employer 

Within  five days  after the sheriff serves the Writ of Execution  on the debtor’s employer,  you 
must mail  the debtor copies  of all of the paperwork you gave to the sheriff to serve on the 
debtor’s employer  (the Writ  of Execution  and the Execution Earnings Disclosure and Earnings 
Disclosure Worksheet).
