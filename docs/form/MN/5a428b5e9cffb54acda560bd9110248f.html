hat is a Harassment Restraining Order? 

A Harassment Restraining Order (HRO) is an order signed by a judicial officer (judge or referee) 
that orders someone to stop harassing you and have no contact, unless allowed in the court order. 
It is not a criminal proceeding and takes place in civil court.  

ho May Apply for a HRO? 

The person applying for the HRO is called the petitioner.  The 
person you are seeking protection from is called the respondent. 
The Petitioner does not have to have had a personal relationship 
with the Respondent. An adult can ask the court (petition) for an 
order for themselves or on behalf of their minor children if there 
have been incidents of harassment against their children. An 
adult can ask the court (petition) for an order on behalf of another adult if there is a court order 
granting legal guardianship. 

Please see the legal 
definition below to see if 
harassment has happened in 
your situation. 

he Respondent could be any adult or juvenile alleged to have 

engaged in harassment, OR an organization alleged to have 
sponsored or promoted harassment. You may only file against one 
Respondent. If you are being harassed by more than one person, you 
must file a separate petition for each Respondent. 

here May the Petitioner Apply for a HRO? 

You can start a Harassment case in the District Court of the county 
where: 

•  you or the Respondent lives, OR 
• 

the harassment occurred;

Is there a Fee to Apply for or to Serve the HRO? 

There is a filing fee to start a harassment case, but the fee may be waived under the law depending 
on the facts of your case. If the court determines your petition includes acts described in Minn. 
Stat. § 609.749, subd. 2, 3, 4, or 5 (specific acts related to harassment crimes), or Minn. Stat. §§ 
609.342 to 609.3451 (specific acts related to sexual assault or contact), fees will be waived.  

f you have a low income, you may ask that filing fees be waived by filing an “IFP form” with the 
court. You can get this form from court administration or online at 
http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=19&p=69.  There is no cost to the petitioner for serving the 
respondent. 

efinitions 

See Minn. Stat. § 609.748, subd. 1: https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.748.  

egardless of the relationship between the parties: 

(a) "Harassment" includes: 

(1) a single incident of physical or sexual assault, a single incident of stalking/harassment 

under § 609.749, subdivision 2, clause (8), a single incident of nonconsensual 
dissemination of private sexual images under § 617.261, or repeated incidents of

another, regardless of the relationship between the actor and the intended target; 

(2) targeted residential picketing; and 

(3) a pattern of attending public events after being notified that the actor's presence at the

one occasion: 

 

(1) marching, standing, or patrolling by one or more persons directed solely at a 

particular residential building in a manner that adversely affects the safety, security,

To get a temporary restraining order, the Petition must also describe an immediate and present 
danger  of  harassment.  Because  the  purpose  of  the  HRO  is  to  protect  a  person  from  future 
harassment, the Petition must include how the petitioner believes that the harassment will continue. 

arassing actions may also be crimes that can be reported to the police. 

Step 1 
Fill Out Petition for Harassment Restraining Order (HAR102) 

Every question on the Petition (HAR102) and in the Guide & File “Protective Orders” 
interview is important.  The judicial officer uses your information to decide whether to 
issue an HRO. If you choose not to provide all of the information, the judicial officer 
may not be able to grant your request and issue an HRO. 

Whatever information you give to the court will become public information as soon as 
the court receives notice that the Respondent has been served with the HRO.  If the 
Respondent does not know your address and/or telephone number, and you do not want 
the Respondent to know this information, you may file a Petitioner's Request to Keep 
Address/Phone Confidential (HAR104) to ask the court to keep your address and/or 
telephone number confidential in this case.   

Please note that if you choose to keep your address confidential, your address will not 
be listed on the Harassment Restraining Order, and it may be more difficult to enforce 
the order for any violations occurring at or near your address.

A Note about Gender: 

The court recognizes that binary gender options of male and female do not fully represent the 
gender identities of all individuals. 

The court has to pass information electronically to the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) in 
order for law enforcement to be able to see the HROs in a statewide system.  The court is limited to 
the gender options allowed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) – male and female. 

If you do not choose male or female, HRO data cannot be passed to the BCA.  That means law 
enforcement will not have access to the electronic version of any HRO. 

HRO 
data 

 

Whatever information you give to the court will become public information as 
soon as the court receives notice that the Respondent has been served with the 
HRO.  If the Respondent does not know your address and/or telephone number, 
and you do not want the Respondent to know this information, you may file a 
Petitioner's Request to Keep Address/Phone Confidential (HAR104) to ask the 
court to keep your address and/or telephone number confidential in this case.   

Please note that if you choose to keep your address confidential, your address will 
not be listed on the Harassment Restraining Order, and it may be more difficult to 
enforce the order for any violations occurring at or near your address.

Questions #6 and #7 are about OTHER COURT CASES. 

6.  This question is about restraining orders.  

a.  Tell how many restraining orders there have been in the past where Respondent was 
ordered to stay away from you or anyone you listed at #3 (your choices are none, 
one, or two or more).  If there have been other restraining orders, list the court file 
number (if you know it) and the place where the order was issued (county/state). 

b.  Does the Respondent have a current HRO or OFP (Order for Protection) against 

you?  If so, give the court file number if you know it. 

7.  If there are any court cases about child custody or parenting time involving both you and the 

Respondent, give the court file number and location of the case.   

ACTS OF HARASSMENT 

8.  This question asks you to describe how the Respondent 
has harassed you and anyone you listed at #3.  Check all 
of the boxes that apply (a-p), and give the date (or date 
range) and details of the harassment.   

If you need more space, add paper. 

It may be helpful to look at the 
definitions of harassment found at the 
beginning of these instructions, and 
online at Minn. Stat. § 609.748, subd. 1 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cit

• 

• 

In section “a,” you are checking the boxes to show who the court should order 
Respondent not to harass. 

In section “b,” check the box or boxes to show who the Respondent should have no 
contact with. 

•  Section “c” asks whether you want the Respondent to stay away from your home (or 
a protected person’s home).   You can also ask the court to order the respondent to 
stay away from a reasonable area surrounding the home (you should describe 
what you mean).  You can also list exceptions.  For example, if it is okay for the 
Respondent to park at the curb in front of your home to exchange the children for 
parenting time, you can write that in the “except as follows” section. 
 

Section “d” asks whether you want the Respondent to stay away from a place of employment.

 

If the judicial officer issues a HRO without a hearing, the Respondent can request a 
hearing within 20 days of the date the Petition is served. If Respondent requests a 
hearing, the court will notify you by mail at least five days before the hearing date. 
If there is a hearing, you must attend the hearing and prove that the statements in your 
Petition are true, and that Respondent’s actions are harassment, as defined by Minnesota 
law.

12b 

12.  Do you want to ask for a hearing? 

a.  Check “a” if you are not asking for a hearing now.  And do you want a hearing if the 

court denies your request for a restraining order because the judicial officer did not find 
an immediate and present danger of harassment?  

b.  Check “b” if you are asking for a court hearing. 

13.  How long do you want the HRO to last?  You have three options in #13: 

•  Until a specific date (the date must be less than 2 years from the date you fill out the petition); 

•  2 years; or 

•  Up to 50 years (note: a court can grant a Harassment Restraining Order 
for up to 50 years if you have had 2 or more restraining orders against 
Respondent, or if Respondent has violated a restraining order between 
you at least twice). 

There will likely be a 
hearing scheduled if you 
ask for a restraining order 
to last more than 2 years.

File Completed Forms with Court Administration 

ile the following forms with court administration: 

•  Petition for Harassment Restraining Order (HAR102) 
•  Law Enforcement Information Sheet – Harassment (HAR103)  
•  Petitioner's Request to Keep Address/Phone Confidential (HAR104) –if you want the 

court to keep your address and/or phone number confidential. 

 

You can file the forms in the following ways:  

In person at the courthouse;  

• 
•  By mail; or  
•  Electronically through the eFS System. 

o  NOTE: once a party files electronically, they are required to use the eFS System 
throughout the entire case; this means they cannot go back to paper filing in that 
case).  

o  For more information about electronic filing and the eFS System, see 

www.mncourts.gov/efile. 

Step 6 

After You File… 

nce all of your forms are filed, a judicial officer will make a decision about your requests 

and issue an order. When the order is ready, you will get a copy of the order.  

ead your order carefully. Did the judicial officer:  

•  Grant an order without a hearing (called an Ex Parte Order)? 
•  Deny an Ex Parte Order but schedule a hearing to hear more information from you? 
•  Deny an Ex Parte Order and dismiss the case? 

If the judicial officer GRANTS the Ex Parte Order, it will be effective immediately. The judicial 
officer may have also ordered a hearing. If the judicial officer did not order a hearing, the 
Respondent has the right to request a hearing within 20 days of service of the petition and Ex 
Parte Order.

If a hearing is ordered, the Harassment Restraining Order (HRO) will be in effect until the date 
of the hearing. Depending on what happens at the hearing, the HRO may or may not continue. 
You must attend the hearing if you want the court to issue a harassment restraining order. 

If the judicial officer DENIES the request for the Ex Parte Order and you have asked for a 
hearing, then court administration will schedule a hearing. The court will send a notice of the 
date and time of the hearing to you and to Respondent. There will be no HRO in effect before the 
hearing. You must attend the hearing. If you do not attend the hearing, the HRO may be 
dismissed.  

If the judicial officer DENIES the request for the Ex Parte Order and you have NOT asked for 
hearing, then no hearing will be scheduled, and your case is dismissed.  

If the judicial officer DISMISSES the case and does not schedule a hearing even if you asked 
for one, this means that the judicial officer does not believe that what you described in your 
petition fits the definition of harassment, or may not have enough information to make a 
decision. You may get legal advice to see what your options might be. 

A copy of any order (except dismissed HROs) must be served on the Respondent. If your 
petition gave an address in Minnesota where the Respondent can be served, court administration 
will send the documents to the Sheriff who will try to personally serve the Respondent. There is 
no fee for this service.  

If Respondent is under 18 years old and you gave the court the name and address of the parent or 
legal guardian, the court will mail a copy of the order to Respondent’s parent or legal guardian.  

Service is complete when law enforcement personally delivers a copy of the papers to 
Respondent. It may take them several tries to serve the Respondent, which could take a week or 
more.  

If law enforcement is not able to serve Respondent you may file the Affidavit and Request for 
Publication (Harassment) (HAR701). This form is used to ask the court to publish information 
about the order as a way to serve the Respondent. 

HAR701 is available online at http://www.mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=22&f=354.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
