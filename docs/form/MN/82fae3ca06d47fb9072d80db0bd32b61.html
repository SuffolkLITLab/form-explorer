process. These instructions  explain  the steps in more detail  and answer common  questions,  but are 
not a full  guide  to the law. Court employees may be able to give  general information  on court rules 
and procedures,  but they cannot give  legal advice.

General Information About  

Application for Discharge of Judgment (BKY101) 

he information  contained in this document is not intended as legal advice but as a general 
guide to you to explain the legal process.  If you do not understand any of these procedures, 
talk to an attorney.  Court staff cannot give legal advice. 

Use the Application for Discharge of Judgment forms if all of the following are true:  

•  You have a judgment  entered against  you for a debt  

•  You have filed  for bankruptcy  in  United States Bankruptcy  Court  

•  The judgment  is for a debt you  owed before you filed  your  bankruptcy  case 

•  There has been a Bankruptcy  Discharge order entered in your bankruptcy  case   

Note: Most types of debts can be discharged  (forgiven)  in  bankruptcy  but some 
cannot be. If you are unsure whether your judgment  debt was discharged in  your 
bankruptcy,  you may want to get legal  advice from a bankruptcy  attorney.  

Step 1 

Gather documents and information you will need to fill out and file 
your Application for Discharge of Judgment 

n addition  to the Application for Discharge of Judgment (BKY101) and Affidavit of Service 
(BKY104) court forms,  you will  need:   

1)  Information  about the judgment  including:   

•  Court file  number (also called  the Case Number) 
•  Your name as it is listed  on the judgment   
•  Name(s) of the creditor(s) listed  on the judgment   
•  Address for the creditor(s)  
•  Date the judgment  was docketed (entered in  the court case) 
•  Amount  of the judgment   

If you do not have the judgment  information  you can look  your case up by going  to 
www.mncourts.gov/Access-Case-Records.aspx . Once you find  your  case, click  on the

case number in  blue. This will  open a page called “Register  of Actions.” The Register of 
Actions has all  of the information  about the judgment  that you will  need.  If you are 
unable  to look  up your  case information,  you  can contact court administration  in  the 
county  the case is in for more instructions  on how to get the information.  Contact 
information  for court administration  in each county  can be found  at 
www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx  .  

2)  Certified copy of your  Bankruptcy Discharge order  

You will  need to contact the United  States Bankruptcy  Court directly  and request a 
certified  copy of your Bankruptcy  Discharge order.  If you have judgments  in more than 
one county,  you will  need one certified copy for each county that you  file an Application 
for Discharge of Judgment in.  

Example: If you are requesting  the discharge of one judgment  in County  A and 
two judgments  in  County  B, you  will  need a total  of two certified  copies of your 
Bankruptcy  Discharge order (one for County  A and one for County  B).  

You can contact the United  States Bankruptcy  Court in  person, by phone,  or by  mail 
using  the contact information  below.  There will  be a fee that you  need to pay for each 
certified  copy before the court will  send you your copy(ies).  Please contact the United 
States Bankruptcy Court to ask what the fee is for a certified  copy of your Bankruptcy 
Discharge order. There are three United  States Bankruptcy  Court locations  in Minnesota 
with staff that can help you. You can ask for a certified copy from any of these locations.

1.  Write the name of the county  where you are filing  your Application.  This  will  be the county   
that your judgment  case is in.  Note: If you have more than one case with judgments  you want 
discharged,  you  will  need to file  a separate Application  for each judgment  case. However, if 
you have more than one judgment  in  the same case, you can list  those judgments  on one 
Application. 

2.  Write the Judicial  District  of the county  where you are filing  your Application.  If you do not 

know the Judicial  District,  you can look  at your judgment  paperwork if you  have it or you can 
find  a map with all  of the Judicial  Districts at http://www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx  . 

.  Write the court file  number  from your judgment  paperwork.  Note: If your case started in 

Conciliation  Court,  you may have two court file  numbers,  one for the Conciliation  Court case 
and one for the judgment  (in District  Court). Be sure to use the court file  number  from your 
judgment  paperwork,  not the Conciliation  Court paperwork.  

.  Write your  name as it appears on the judgment  case. Note: If you changed your name since 
the judgment  was entered and your new name is used on your bankruptcy  case paperwork, 
you should  write both of your names on the Application.  List the name the judgment  is in 
first,  then write N/K/A and your new name. N/K/A stands for “now known  as.”

Reminder: If you have a case with more than one judgment  in  it,  list  all of the creditors,  dates of 
docketing,  and amounts  for each judgment  in that case on a single  Application.  But, if you have 
more than one case with judgments  you want discharged,  you  will  need to file  separate 
Applications  for each judgment  case.

Make copies of the Application for Discharge of Judgment and copies of your  certified 
Bankruptcy Discharge order.  The number  of copies you  will  be making  of each of these 
documents  will  depend on how many  Applications  you are filing  and how many creditors  are 
included  in  each Application.   

Number of copies  of the Application for Discharge of Judgment you will  need:  

□ Make 1 copy to keep for your records 
□ Make 1 copy for each creditor  listed  on the judgment 

Number of plain  (uncertified)  copies of the Certified Bankruptcy Discharge order you 
will  need: 

□ Make 1 copy to keep for your records  
□ Make 1 copy for each creditor  listed  on the judgment   
□ If you are filing  more than one Application  in  a particular  county,  make 1 extra    
   copy for each additional  Application  you are filing  in  that county.  

Step 4 

Arrange for Service  

 
 

 

 

   

 

 

  Y

ou must arrange for the creditor(s) to receive copies of the papers you are filing  with the court. 

This is  called  “service of process.” You must have someone else who is over the age of 18 and 
not involved  in  the case serve the creditor; you cannot serve the papers.  

Each creditor needs to be served with:   

□   1 copy of your Application for Discharge of Judgment  

□   1 plain  (uncertified)  copy of your certified  Bankruptcy  Discharge order 

Note: Keep the original  Application  and certified copy of your  Bankruptcy Discharge 
order to file  with the court in the next step.  

There are two ways you can have the creditor served:   

Certified  Mail:   Someone  else (not you) who is over the age of 18 and not involved  in the case 
can mail  the papers to the creditor  by Certified  Mail  to the creditor’s last known  address.   

Personal Service:   Someone  else (not you) who is over the age of 18 and not involved  in the case 
can hand the papers to the creditor or a person “of suitable  age and discretion”  at the creditor’s

home if that person  lives  with the creditor.  You can have a friend  or family  member serve the 
creditor,  you can contact the Sheriff’s Department in the county  in which  the creditor lives  or has 
a place of business,  or you can contact a private process server.   

Note: Papers cannot be served on legal  holidays,  which  are defined  in Minn.  Stat. § 645.44, 
subd. 5 (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44#stat.645.44.5).   

Step 5 

Affidavit of Service (BKY104) 

fter the paperwork is served on the creditor  (not before), the person who served the papers 
must fill  out the Affidavit of Service form. The affidavit  does not need to be notarized  because the 
server is signing  it under penalty  of perjury.  This form is the proof that someone served the 
papers on the creditor.  

Step 6 

File your papers with the Court   

ile  these papers:  

□ Original  Application(s) for Judgment Discharge (BKY101) 

□ Original  certified copy of your  Bankruptcy Discharge order 

□ One extra plain  (uncertified)  copy of your Bankruptcy  Discharge for each additional      
   Application  you are filing.   

□ Affidavit of Service  

□ Note: Court administration  will  charge you $5 for each judgment  you are trying  to     
   discharge. This  fee must be paid at the time you file  your papers. If you are unable  to    
   afford the fees, you  can ask a judge  for a fee waiver.  More information  about fee  
   waivers can be found  on the courts website at www.mncourts.gov/Help-Topics.aspx  . 

You can file  your papers by going  in person to the courthouse  in the county  that your judgment  is 
in,  or you  can mail  your papers with the fee(s) to the court by regular U.S. mail.  For location  and

mailing  information  for the courthouse  for your  case, you can go to www.mncourts.gov/Find-
Courts.aspx and choose the county from the drop  down menu and click  “Go.” 

Step 7 

Wait 20 days if the creditor was served by personal service OR  

Wait 23 days if the creditor was served by Certified Mail 

 

 

Court administration  will  discharge  your judgment(s)  20 days after the creditor  was served if the 
creditor was served by personal  service; or 23 days after the creditor  was served if the creditor 
was served by Certified  Mail,  so long  as there is no objection  filed  by the judgment  creditor 
during  this time.   

Certification of Discharge of Judgment 

If you want court administration  to send a Certification  of Discharge of Judgment  after the 
judgment  is discharged,  you can contact court administration  to ask for more information  about 
how to get a Certification  of Discharge of Judgment.  There is a separate $5 fee for each 
Certification  of Discharge of  Judgment  that you request.

no further action  will  happen unless  you,  the 
judgment  creditor,  or other interested party 
serves and files a motion  asking  the court to rule 
on the objection  and the application  for 
discharge of judgment. 

If you receive an objection  from the judgment 
creditor and want to file  a motion,  you  may find

fee, you can ask for a fee waiver by filling  out 
the fee waiver application.
