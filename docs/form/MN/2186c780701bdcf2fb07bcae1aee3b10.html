Most forms are available  online at https://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=1#subcat2.   

Consent by Non-Petitioning Parent 

Before a child may be adopted by a stepparent, the child  must be available to be adopted.  This 
means that the non-petitioning parent, if one exists, must give written consent to the child’s 
adoption or that parent’s parental rights must be terminated by the Court if they have not already 
been terminated (see form ADO203).   

These stepparent adoption forms can be used only in cases where the non-petitioning 

parent voluntarily consents to the child’s adoption or where that parent’s rights to the child  have 
already been terminated.  You CANNOT use these forms if the non-petitioning parent refuses to 
consent to the stepparent adoption.  If the non-petitioning parent refuses to consent to the 
adoption, you will  need to consult a lawyer (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx). 

Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) 

Adoptions involving an Indian child (a child  who a member or eligible for membership in an Indian 
tribe) are more complex than adoptions involving non-Indian children.  You CANNOT use these 
forms if the child  to be adopted is an Indian child.  Instead, you should consult a lawyer 
(mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx) to ensure that all of the legal requirements for 
adopting an Indian child are met. 

Consent by Child Aged 14 or Older 

If the child to be adopted 14 years old or older, that child must sign a written consent to the 
adoption (see form ADO204). 

Other Important  Information 

• 

If your child is the subject of a child in need of protection or services (CHIPS) proceeding, the 
Court may not be able to immediately decide your request for stepparent adoption. 

•  Court personnel and the county attorney’s office CANNOT help you fill out these forms. 

•  You should talk to a lawyer if you don’t know how to answer the questions in these forms 

(mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx). 

•  The Judicial  Officer expects every person who appears in court without a lawyer to know and 
to follow the law.  If you act as your own lawyer, you must do what a lawyer would do.  See 
the “Representing Yourself in Court” Help Topic  (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Representing-
Yourself-in-Court.aspx).

This Introduction summarizes general information about stepparent adoptions. 

Introduction 

Legal Consequences of Stepparent Adoption 

When a stepparent adopts a child, there are legal consequences to the child, to the child’s birth 
parents, and to the adopting parents.  Following is a brief summary of some of the key 
consequences, but you should contact an attorney (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx) 
to learn about all  of the consequences: 

•  Adoption by a stepparent does not change the legal relationship between the child and the 

child’s birth parent who is married to the adopting stepparent.   

•  The non-petitioning parent whose parental rights are terminated by the stepparent adoption 
will have no rights over the child or the child’s property, will have no future child support 
obligation, and will no longer have parental custody or parenting time rights regarding the 
child unless a communication and contact agreement is signed by the parties as part of the 
adoption proceedings. 

•  When the adoption is finalized, the child becomes the legal child  of the stepparent, and the 
stepparent becomes the legal parent to the child,  with all  of the rights, responsibilities, and 
duties as if the child was the stepparent’s child by birth.   

•  As a result of the adoption, the child  shall inherit from the adoptive parent the same as 

though the child was born to the parent.   

•  The adoption of a child whose birth parent or parents are enrolled in an Indian tribe shall  not 

change the child’s enrollment in that tribe. 

Venue (Location) for Adoption Proceeding 

Stepparent adoptions must be filed in the county where the stepparent resides.  However, if the 
child is under the guardianship of the Commissioner of Human Services, the stepparent adoption 
must be filed in the county where the termination of parental rights proceeding is filed.  Upon 
request, the Court may change the venue to another county. 

Child’s Consent to Adoption 

If the child to be adopted is 14  years old or older, the child must give written consent to the 
adoption.  See court form ADO204  – Consent to Adoption by Child Aged 14  or Older. 

Parent’s Consent to Adoption 

Before any child  may be adopted by a stepparent, the child must be available  to be adopted.  This 
means that the non-petitioning parent, if one exists, must give written consent to the child’s 
adoption or that parent’s parental rights must be terminated by the Court if they have not already

been terminated.  You cannot use these forms if the non-petitioning parent refuses to consent to 
the adoption.  See court form ADO203  – Consent of Parent to Adoption by Stepparent. 

Communication and Contact  Agreement 

Even though the child’s non-petitioning parent has consented to the child’s adoption, that parent 
may still  contact or communicate with the child if all  parties agree in writing and if that agreement is 
filed with and approved by the Court as part of the adoption proceeding.  See court form ADO212 –
Communication and Contact Agreement and Order. 

Stepparent One-Year Residency in Minnesota 

A stepparent who has resided in Minnesota for one year or longer may petition to adopt children in 
Minnesota.  Upon request, the Court may reduce the one-year residency requirement to 30  days 
whenever it appears to be in the best interests of the child.  The forms to ask for waiver of the one-
year residency requirement are: 

•  Ex Parte Motion to Waive One-Year Residency Requirement (ADO205); 

•  Affidavit in Support of Motion to Waive One-Year Residency Requirement (ADO206); and 

•  Proposed Order Waiving  One-Year Residency Requirement (ADO207).  

Biological Parent Social and Medical History 

In a stepparent adoption, the birth parent is not required to provide the stepparent with the social 
and medical history of the birth family. 

Adoption Study 

An adoption study is not required in stepparent adoptions. 

Postplacement Assessment 

Upon the filing  of the stepparent adoption petition, if a child-placing  agency is not involved in the 
adoption, the Court must immediately refer the petition to the local social  services agency in the 
county where the prospective adoptive parent lives to conduct a postplacement assessment and file 
a report with the Court within 90  days of the agency’s receipt of the petition.  The petitioners must 
pay the cost of the postplacement assessment.   

The assessment must evaluate the child’s environment, the petitioners’ home, the child’s health and 
well-being in the prospective adoptive home, whether the child’s cultural  and ethnic practices are 
being met, whether the adoptive placement meets the needs of the child, and must include a 
background study, including  fingerprint check, of all  individuals in the home age 13  or older.  The 
assessment report must make a recommendation as to whether the adoption should be granted.

ADO201      State       ENG 

Rev 12/22                 www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 4 of 20 

The petitioners may ask the Court to waive the postplacement assessment and report.  The forms to 
request waiver of the postplacement assessment must be completed and filed with the court 
(ADO208, ADO209,  ADO211).  

Some Courts waive the postplacement assessment and report and instead require the Petitioners to 
submit an Affidavit in Place of Postplacement Assessment Report (ADO210).   

Even if the postplacement assessment and report is waived by the Court, the Court must still  order 
the county social  services agency to conduct a background study, including  fingerprint check, for all 
persons in the home age 13 or older. 

Background  Study 

Upon the filing  of a petition for stepparent adoption, if a child-placing  agency is not involved in the 
adoption, the Court must refer the petition to the local  social  services agency in the county where 
the prospective adoptive parent lives so that the agency may conduct a background study, including 
fingerprint check, regarding all  persons in the home age 13  or older.  The background study and 
fingerprint check cannot be waived. 

Minnesota Fathers’ Adoption Registry Search 

In stepparent adoptions, the agency responsible for the background study must also request a 
search of the Minnesota Fathers’ Adoption Registry to determine whether a putative father is 
registered in relation to the child  to be adopted.  Proof of the search must be filed with the Court 
before the adoption may be granted. 

Child’s Birth Certificate 

You will  need to file with the Court a certified copy of the birth certificate of each child to be 
adopted.

OLDER FORM (ADO204) 
(this is known as "the case caption")

Motion to Waive One-Year Residency Requirement (ADO205) 
Affidavit in Support of Motion to Waive One-Year Residency Requirement (ADO206)

If you do not intend to ask the Court to waive the one-year residency requirement, you may skip 
this step and go to Step 5.  

A stepparent who has resided in Minnesota for one year or more may petition to adopt one or more 
children.  Upon request, the one-year residency requirement may to be reduced to 30 days by the

Step 5 
If necessary, fill out the forms to ask the Court to waive the postplacement assessment and 
report: 
Motion to Waive Postplacement Assessment (ADO208) 
Affidavit in Support of Motion to Waive Postplacement Assessment (ADO209) 
Order Waiving One-Year Residency Requirement (ADO211) 

If you do not intend to ask the Court to waive the Postplacement Assessment, you may skip this 
step and go to Step 6.  

•  Upon the filing  of the stepparent adoption petition, the Court must immediately refer the 
petition to the local social  services agency in the county where the prospective adoptive 
parent lives to conduct a postplacement assessment and file a report with the Court within 
90  days of the agency’s receipt of the petition.  The petitioner must pay the cost of the 
postplacement assessment.  The assessment must evaluate the child’s environment, the 
home of the petitioners, the health and well-being of the child in the prospective adoptive 
home, whether the child’s cultural  and ethnic practices are being met, whether the adoptive 
placement meets the needs of the child, and must include a background study, including 
fingerprint check, of all  adults in the home age 13 or older.  The assessment report must 
make a recommendation as to whether the adoption should be granted. 

•  The petitioners in a stepparent adoption may ask the Court to waive the postplacement 

assessment and report.   

•  Even if the postplacement assessment and report is waived by the Court, the Court must still 
order the county social  services agency to conduct a background study, including  fingerprint 
check, for all  persons in the home aged 13 or older. 

• 

If the postplacement assessment and report is waived by the Court, the judicial officer may 
instead require the petitioners to complete an affidavit regarding the length of marriage, 
criminal  background information, and other important information.   

If you want to have the postplacement assessment waived, you will need to fill out three 
documents: 

•  Ex Parte Motion to Waive Postplacement Assessment (ADO208);  
•  Affidavit in Support of Motion to Waive Postplacement Assessment (ADO209);  and  
•  Order Waiving Postplacement Assessment (ADO211).

Rev 12/22                 www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 18 of 20 

•  Keep the copies for yourself (make sure to bring your copies with you to court on the day of 

your adoption hearing – see Step 11). 

•  You will  file the originals of each document with Court Administration following the 

instructions at Step 10. 

 

Step 10 
File the Forms with the Court 
Pay the Filing Fee 
Obtain Date, Time, and Location of Adoption Hearing from Court Administration 

The following original  documents must be filed with the Court before the Court can set the date for 
the adoption hearing: 

•  The original Petition for Stepparent Adoption; 

•  The original parent’s consent to adoption. 

•  The original child’s consent to adoption, if the child being adopted is age 14 or older. 

•  The original proof that the Minnesota Fathers’ Adoption Registry has been searched. 

•  The original Ex Parte Motion to Waive Postplacement Assessment and Report, Affidavit in 

Support of Motion to Waive Postplacement Assessment, and Order Waiving Postplacement 
Assessment, if you decide to ask the judicial officer to waive this assessment. 

•  The original Ex Parte Motion to Waive One-Year Residency Requirement, Affidavit in Support 

of Motion to Waive One-Year Residency Requirement, and Order Waiving One-Year 
Residency Requirement, if you decide to ask the judicial  officer to reduce the residency 
requirement. 

•  The original Communication  and Contact Agreement if there is one. 

•  The required filing fee (Court Administration office can tell you the correct amount). 

HOW TO FILE 

At the Courthouse: 

•  File the original  forms with court administration.   

•  This can be done either in person at the courthouse or by mail.  Addresses for courthouses 

are online at www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx.   

Electronic Filing (eFiling) through the eFS System: 

Instructions – Stepparent Adoption 
ADO201      State       ENG 

Rev 12/22                 www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 19 of 20 

•  The eFS System allows you to eFile your forms.  Information about eFiling is on the MN 

Judicial  Branch website at www.mncourts.gov/eFile under the “eFile and eServe Training” 
tab. 

•  Once you choose to eFile, you will need to continue to use the eFS System for the rest of the 

case.  See Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 14.01(b)(5)(i) 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/court_rules/gp/id/14/).  

Once all of the papers are filed, ask Court Administration to let you know the date, time, and 
location  of the final adoption hearing. 

Step 11 
Appear in Court 

Arrive on time.  For your hearing, plan to arrive at least 15  minutes before your court time.   

Bring your copies of all the papers you filed with the court. 

Bring the child(ren) to be adopted to the hearing. 

The hearing is very formal. You are expected to know and follow the court rules of procedure.  You 
should be respectful to the other party and to everyone in the courtroom.  Do not interrupt the 
judicial  officer or other party.  Answer any questions from the judicial officer honestly. Direct all 
your comments to the judicial  officer, not the other parties who may be present. 

Courts operate by rules and laws that may not necessarily make sense to you. If you choose to 
represent yourself, the court rules say that you are responsible for knowing the law and rules, just 
like an attorney.  The judicial officer cannot give you special consideration or help because you are 
not a lawyer.   

What Happens at the Court Hearing?  At the hearing the judicial  officer will review your Petition for 
Stepparent Adoption and ask you many of the same questions that are in that Petition to be certain 
that your answers have not changed.  At the end of the hearing the judicial officer will  issue a 
decision either granting or denying or request to adopt the child(ren). 

Step 12 
After the Court Hearing 

Following the hearing, the judicial officer will  issue the written order granting or denying the 
adoption petition.  If the petition is granted, the judicial  officer will also issue an adoption decree. 

You will  need to obtain a certified copy of the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Adoption 
Decree so that you can obtain a new birth certificate for the child(ren). 

Instructions for obtaining a new birth certificate are located on the website for the Department of 
Health: http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/chs/osr/birth.html.
