      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS 
Appealing a Conciliation Court Judgment in 
District Court 

Important Notices and Resources 

The Court has forms and instructions, for some types of cases, as a general guide to the court process. 
These instructions  explain the steps in more detail and answer common questions but are not a full 
guide to the law. Court employees may be able to give general information on court rules and 
procedures, but they cannot give legal advice.  

Have questions about court forms or instructions? 

• Visit www.MNCourts.gov/SelfHelp 
• Call the Statewide Self-Help Center at 651-435-6535 

Not sure what to do about a legal issue or need advice? 

• Talk with a lawyer 
• Visit www.MNCourts.gov/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx  

Helpful materials may be found at your public county law library. For a directory, see  
http://mn.gov/law-library/research-links/county-law-libraries.jsp . For more information, contact court 
administration or call the Minnesota State Law Library at 651-297-7651. 

DO THIS BEFORE THE DEADLINE SPECIFIED IN THE NOTICE OF CONCILATION COURT 
ORDER/ENTRY OF JUDGMENT MAILED TO YOU 

Failure to follow all the requirements of the laws and rules for a removal, which is appealing a 
judgment granted in a conciliation  court action , governing removal to District  Court may result in 
dismissal of your appeal. 

The appeal forms are available free of charge at any Court Administrator’s office and online at 
https://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=10&p=39, and must be completed by you or your attorney. 
You must pay the civil filing  fee when filing your Demand for Removal/Appeal from Conciliation 
Court to District  Court. A person who is unable to pay the filing fee may apply for a fee waiver (see 
https://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Fee-Waiver-IFP.aspx).   

The following is a brief explanation of the requirements for filing an appeal.  You or your attorney 
must perform these steps by the date specified on the Notice of Conciliation Court Order/Entry of 
Judgment, which was mailed or delivered to you. 

Instructions – Appealing a Conciliation Court Judgment in District Court 
CCT401      State       ENG 

Rev 2/23                www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 1 of 3 

Step 1 

Fill Out Demand for Removal/Appeal from Conciliation Court to District Court and 
Affidavit of Good Faith (CCT402) 

Fill  out the Demand for Removal/Appeal from Conciliation  Court to District  Court and Affidavit of 
Good Faith form (CCT402).   Use the same names of the parties as they appear on the Notice of 
Conciliation Court Order/Entry of Judgment that you received.   

The plaintiffs remain the plaintiffs and the defendants remain the defendants when completing the 
Demand for Removal/Appeal form.   

Leave the Court File Number blank as a new District  Court File number will be assigned by court 
administration  when you file the document.   

Include the Conciliation  Court File Number on the form so court administration can copy certain 
documents from the Conciliation  Court case into the new District  Court case.   

The Demand for Removal tells the court and the other party that you want to start over with a new 
trial  where you will again bring your evidence and make your legal arguments. You must have a 
good faith reason for requesting a new trial.    

Check the box indicating  if you want a trial  by the court or by jury.  If you want a trial  by jury, you 
must include the fee for a jury trial. 

Signature Block 

Date and sign the completed Demand for Removal form, then print your contact information 
underneath your signature.  When you sign the Demand for Removal form, you are signing under 
penalty of perjury.  Perjury is the crime of intentionally lying or misrepresenting the truth, 
punishable by jail or other sanctions. 

If a lawyer represents the appealing party, the lawyer’s name, address and phone number must be 
printed on the form.  If the appealing party is a corporation, a lawyer must represent the 
corporation and the lawyer must sign the form. If the appealing party is self-represented, the party 
must sign the form and list their address and telephone number. 

Step 2 
Make Copies 

Make a copy of the completed and signed form for each party to the action, including  yourself.

Step 3 
Serve the Other Parties 

A copy of the Demand for Removal/Appeal from Conciliation Court to District  Court and Affidavit of 
Good Faith must be served on each opposing party or their attorney if represented, by first class 
mail or by electronic means as set forth in the Rules of General Practice 14  and 521(b)(1). 

Service may also be by personal service.  See Minnesota Rules of Court, Rules of Civil Procedure, 
Rule 4.03  Personal Service.  Personal service must be made by someone at least eighteen (18) years 
of age and not a party to the action.  Papers cannot be served on legal holidays as defined in Minn. 
Stat. § 645.44,  subd. 5 (revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44). 

Step 4 
Fill Out the Affidavit of Service (CCT103) 

The Affidavit of Service (mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=10&f=172) tells the Court who served the 
papers on the other parties and how and when the papers were served. 

Service must be completed within 21  days of the date that the Court mailed or delivered the Notice 
of Conciliation Court Order/Entry of Judgment to you and before the deadline specified in the 
Notice. 

The person who served the papers (by mail or by personal service) should complete the Affidavit of 
Service form and sign it under penalty of perjury.  Perjury is the crime of intentionally lying or 
misrepresenting the truth, punishable by jail or other sanctions. 

 

 

Step 5 
File Your Forms with the District Court 

The Demand for Removal/Appeal form with a completed Affidavit of Service form must be filed with 
the Court Administrator of district  court. 

This is a new court action  to be heard in District  Court.  Do not file the Demand for Removal/Appeal 
and Affidavit of Service in the Conciliation  Court case. 

A filing fee must be paid at the time of filing, or a fee waiver request must be completed and 
approved by a judicial  officer.  See https://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Fee-Waiver-IFP.aspx.  

You or your attorney must perform all of these steps by the date specified on the Notice of 
Conciliation Court Order/Entry of Judgment that was mailed or delivered to you. 

If you do not understand the procedures or are unable to prepare the necessary forms, you should 
talk to an attorney  (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx).

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
