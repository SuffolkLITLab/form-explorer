      <pre>RENT ESCROW INSTRUCTIONS 
Minnesota Statutes § 504B.385  

lease  read  the  complete  instructions  before  you  begin.    If  you  do  not  understand  these 

instructions, you may need to contact an attorney.   

MPORTANT INFORMATION 
•  A rent escrow action is a legal way for a residential tenant to bring a claim that requires the 

landlord to make needed repairs or to comply with the terms of the lease.   

•  The court can only hear cases involving residential property located in its own county.  
•  A tenant cannot be evicted on the basis of demanding repairs, calling a Housing Inspector or 
starting  a  rent escrow  action.  The tenant can  be  evicted for  not  paying  the rent  due to the 
landlord up to the time of filing the rent escrow action or not depositing the full amount with 
the court at the time the action is filed.  The landlord may allege that there are other reasons 
the tenant should be evicted.  

•  The tenant must reside in the problem property.  The tenant cannot file a rent escrow action 

after they have moved.  

•  The  tenant  can  ask  the  court  to  order  the  landlord  to  make  repairs,  reduce  the  rent  until 
repairs  are  complete,  refund  a  portion  of  past  rent  when  repairs  were  not  made  and  other 
relief.  

ne of the following must have occurred before the tenant may file: 

•  The  tenant  must  provide  the  landlord  with  written  notice  listing  the  needed  repairs  or 
describing what part of the lease the landlord has not completed.  The notice must have 
been  personally  delivered  to  the  landlord  or  mailed  to  the  place  where  rent  is  usually 
paid.  If it has been at least 14 days since the tenant provided the landlord with a written 
notice, then the tenant may file. 

•  A  local  housing  inspector  completed  a  code  violation  report  and  the  deadline  the 
inspector  gave  the  landlord  to  make  repairs  has  passed  without  the  repairs  being 
completed.  The tenant must ask the inspector for a copy of the report.  

•  A local housing inspector completed a code violation report and the tenant believes the 
inspector gave the landlord too much time to complete the repairs.  The tenant must ask 
the inspector for a copy of the report.  

 

REQUIREMENTS TO FILE A RENT ESCROW 
•  Complete an Affidavit of Rent Escrow (available at the Court Administrator/Housing Court 

office or online at www.mncourts.gov/forms ). 

•  Attach a  copy  of the Code  Inspection  Report  by  the inspector  OR the tenant’s letter  to the 

landlord requesting repairs (Case can be filed if the tenant does not have a copy).   

•  Pay the filing fee or obtain an order from the court waiving the fee.  
•  Deposit  any  rent  that  is  owed  with  the  court.    Personal  checks  are  not  accepted.    Cash  or 
cashier’s  check  is  acceptable.    Check  with  the  Court  Administrator/Housing  Court  for 
acceptable forms of payment.

COMPLETING THE AFFIDAVIT OF RENT ESCROW 
Remember  as  you  answer  the  questions  on  the  affidavit,  you  are  under  oath  and  must  tell  the 
truth.  
Caption of the Affidavit: 

•  The tenant(s) is the plaintiff.   
•  The landlord is the defendant.  The landlord may be a corporation or an individual.  Be 

sure to list the landlord, not their agent.  

Body of the Affidavit: 

1.  Fill in your complete address including  your apartment number, city, state, ZIP, county 

and phone number including area code.  

2.  Fill  in  the  landlord’s  name,  complete  address,  city,  state,  ZIP  and  phone  number 

including area code.  

3.  If  the  property  manager  is  different  from  the  landlord,  fill  in  their  name,  address,  city, 

state, ZIP and phone number including area code.  

4.  List  all  problems  or  violations  with  your  housing  that  have  NOT  been  repair.  Attach 

additional pages if needed.  

5.  Give an estimate of how much it would cost to repair the problems or violations listed in 

#4.  If you don’t know, contact someone to give you a professional estimate. 

6.  If the inspector issued a code violation report, complete “a”.  If you mailed or personally 

delivered a letter requesting repairs, complete “b”.  

7.  Fill in the amount of your monthly rent and when it is due.  If rent is paid in full to date, 
check  “a”.    If  rent  is  due,  check  “b”  and  be  prepared  to  deposit  that  amount  with  the 
court. Check with Court Administrator/Housing Court for acceptable forms of payment. 
8.  If there is something you would like the court to do, indicate by checking the appropriate 

box(es). You may leave this question blank.  

•  By  signing  the  Affidavit  under  penalty  of  perjury,  you  are  stating  that  the 
information in the document is true to the best of your knowledge.  Perjury is the 
crime of intentionally lying or misrepresenting the truth. 

•  Fill in today’s date 
•  Print your name, address, city, state, ZIP and phone number including area code.  

ETTING A COURT DATE 

•  Once  your  Affidavit  has  been  filed  with  the  court,  the  clerk  will  prepare  a  Notice  of 
Hearing for Rent Escrow and attach a copy of the Affidavit of Rent Escrow and either the 
code violation report or your letter to the landlord requesting repairs.  

•  A  court  date  will  be  set  within  10  to  14  days  after  the  rent  is  deposited  with  the  court 
unless there is a pending eviction action.  If so, both the eviction and the rent escrow will 
be set for the same date (Minn. Stat. § 504B.385, subd. 8).

Signing the Affidavit: 

504B.385, subd. 5)  
Cost of Repairs is $15,000 or Less: 

be by first class mail.   
Cost of Repairs is More than $15,000: 

•  The court clerk will serve the landlord at the address provided by the tenant. Service will 

•  The tenant  is  responsible for arranging for personal  service  on  the  landlord(s).   Service 
may  be  done  by  any  one  18  years  of  age  or  older  who  is  not  a  party  to  the  case.  The 
tenant can not serve the landlord.  Service must be made at least five days but not more

than ten days before the date of the hearing.   The person doing the service must complete 
an Affidavit of Personal Service.  The tenant must file this affidavit with the court at least 
three days prior to the court date.  

T THE HEARING 

Once the case is decided, the judicial officer will issue a Decision and Order.  The Decision and 
Order  will  address  who  is  to  receive  the  rent  that  is  deposited  with  the  court.    The  court  may 
order  a  portion  to  the  landlord  and  a  portion  to  the  tenant  or  may  order  all  the  monies  to  one 
party.  The court may schedule a future date to ensure the landlord has complied with its court.  

F THE REPAIRS ARE MADE PRIOR TO THE COURT DATE 
The  tenant  notifies  the  court  in  writing  that  the  needed  repairs  have  been  made,  the  clerk  will 
release the rent to the landlord.  The hearing will be cancelled.  If the tenant and landlord enter 
into a written agreement signed by all parties distributing the rent between them, the clerk must 
release the rent in accordance with the written agreement.    

HAT CAN HAPPEN IF RENT DUE IS NOT DEPOSITED WITH THE COURT (Minn. 

Stat. § 504B.385, subd. 2) 
The landlord may file a Counterclaim for Possession of the Premises or a separate eviction action 
if the tenant did not or does not deposit all rent due.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
