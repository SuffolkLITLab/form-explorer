STEP 9 
HAVE COPIES OF THE FORMS AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS SERVED ON 
THE OTHER PARTY AND COUNTY ATTORNEY’S OFFICE 

You must arrange for the other party to receive complete copies of all forms and supporting 
documents you have prepared for the hearing.  This is called “service of process.”  You cannot 
serve the papers yourself. Someone else at least 18 years of age must serve the papers.  NOTE: If 
the County Child Support Agency is involved in your case, you must arrange for the County 
Attorney’s Office to be served as well. 

A copy of the forms and supporting documents must be served upon all parties, either personally 
or by mail.  If a party is represented by an attorney, the forms and supporting documents must be 
served on the attorney instead of the party, at the attorney’s office. 

Personal service:  forms and supporting documents are hand-delivered to the other party 
personally or by leaving them at that party’s place of residence with some person who is of 
suitable age or discretion who also lives at the same residence.  Forms and supporting documents 
must be hand delivered at least 14 days before the hearing date.   

Mail service:  forms and supporting documents are mailed by first class U.S. mail to the other 
party at least 17 days before the hearing date.   

If your forms and supporting documents are not timely served upon the other party (or 
his/her attorney), your motion may not be heard by the court. 

YOU  CANNOT  HAND  DELIVER  OR  MAIL  THE  DOCUMENTS 
YOURSELF.  YOU MUST HAVE SOMEONE ELSE OVER THE AGE OF 
18 WHO IS NOT A PARTY  TO THE CASE HAND  DELIVER OR MAIL 
THE DOCUMENTS FOR YOU. 

OTE! 

  N

STEP 10 
COMPLETE THE “AFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE” FORM 

he person who hand delivers or mails the forms and supporting documents must fill out an 
“Affidavit of Service” form for each party served. After service is completed, the person signs 
the “Affidavit of Service” under penalty of perjury.  Perjury is the crime of intentionally lying or 
misrepresenting the truth, punishable by jail or other sanctions. 

STEP 11 
FILE THE FORMS AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS WITH COURT 
ADMINISTRATION AND PAY ANY REQUIRED COURT FEE 

ile the following forms and supporting documents with court administration in the county 
where your case is located as soon as practical but no later than 5 days before the scheduled

the original documents must not be filed, but you must keep all original documents and make 
them available to the court or any party upon request. 

ourt Fees 

There is no fee for filing this motion. However, if you did not pay an initial filing fee when this 
case first began you must pay that fee now.  Court administration will be able to tell you if you 
have paid the initial filing fee. 

f a filing fee is owed and you cannot afford to pay the fee, you may qualify to have the filing fee 
waived by the court.  You need to fill out a Fee Waiver (In Forma Pauperis) application 
(available from court administration or at www.mncourts.gov/forms) and have it reviewed by a 
judge. Court administration can tell you how to get your request to a judge.  If the judge does not 
sign an order that waives the fee, you must be prepared to pay the fee. Court Administration 
cannot accept your filing without payment or an order waiving the fee. 

STEP 12 
APPEAR AT THE HEARING 

ome to court on the date and time scheduled for the hearing allowing extra time for traffic, 

courthouse security, and finding the courtroom.  Be sure to bring the papers you sent to the other 
party, and your copy of the “Notice of Motion, Motion and Affidavit to Collect Unreimbursed or 
Uninsured Health Care Expenses” and supporting documents.  If you have additional documents 
to offer into evidence bring a copy for the judicial officer, one for the other parent, one for the 
county attorney, and one for yourself.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
