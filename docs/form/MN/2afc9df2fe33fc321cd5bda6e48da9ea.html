Step 4 
Confidential Information Form 11.1 (CON111) and

Most documents filed with the court are considered public documents and 
are available to the public.  Certain information that is filed with the court 
may be considered confidential based on court rule and not available to the 
public.  To keep this information confidential and not available to the public, 
you must take certain steps that are described below.   

The steps listed below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  Filers 
who are using eFS to submit their court documents must identify and 
designate their filings as required in Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 11.03 and 14.06.   

Confidential Information Form 11.1 

All social security numbers, employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers 
(also called “restricted identifiers”) must not be listed on papers you file with the court. This is to 
protect your privacy, the other parties and your children.   Only provide social security numbers, 
employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers when the court requires this 
information to be provided to the court.  For example, if you must provide the court with bank 
account numbers, or medical account numbers, do not include any account number in your 
document (your motion, supporting affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you must use Form 11.1 to list these 
confidential numbers.  

If account numbers are not required to be provided to the court, and the numbers appear on 
documents that are considered available to the public, (such as medical invoices or credit account

Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-
public documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the 
time you file the documents with the court.  You must complete and file the “Cover Sheet for 
Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 (also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public 
documents.  The most common non-public documents are called “financial source documents.”  
Examples of financial source documents include: 

•  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and business 

expenses 

•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers   

You may also need to submit other documents that court rules identify as non-public documents, 
such as a medical record.  For example, a report from a doctor that provides a medical diagnosis 
or treatment plan for you or your child would qualify as a medical record.   

You must use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing other non-public documents, such as 
medical records, with the court.  One Form 11.2 cover sheet can be used for submitting all non-
public documents.   

The failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being 

rejected by court administration, being available to the public, stricken from the 
court record, and sanctions from the court. 

See Rule 11 of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice for more information about how to file 
documents containing social security numbers, financial account numbers, “financial source 
documents” and other non-public documents.   

Form  11.1  and  Form  11.2  can  be  found  at  www.mncourts.gov/forms  under  the  court  forms 
category of “Confidential Information” and is court form number CON111 and CON112. 
 

Step 5 
Make Copies of the Forms  

Make  two  copies  of  the  Responsive  Notice  of  Motion  and  Motion  form,  two  copies  of 
your Affidavit, and  two copies of your Parenting / Financial Disclosure Statement form 
and all attachments (for example: pay stubs, proof of expenses).
