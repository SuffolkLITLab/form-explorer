      <pre>DISTRICT COURT 
MOTION TO MODIFY CHILD SUPPORT AND/OR SPOUSAL MAINTENANCE 
 
USE CHILD SUPPORT FORMS FOR DISTRICT COURT IF: 
 

There is already an existing court order setting or reserving child support and/or spousal maintenance;  
You are asking the court to change basic support, medical support, child care, and/or spousal 
maintenance; and 
You or the other party are not receiving public assistance or child support enforcement services (Title 
IV-D services) from the local child support enforcement agency, or you or the other party ARE receiving 
public assistance or child support enforcement services AND you are requesting to modify spousal 
maintenance and/or seeking other relief from the court that will be set for hearing at the same time as the 
motion for modification.   

f you or the other party are receiving Title IV-D services, and only want to change child support, you must use 
the child support forms for the expedited child support process (found online at 
http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=6#subcat12).  

ou cannot use the motion to modify child support forms to change parenting time or custody. 

Joint child – is the dependent child of both parents in the support action. 
Nonjoint child – is the legal child of one, but not both parents in the support action.   

•  Court personnel cannot help you fill out these forms. 
•  You may need to speak with a lawyer or other legal services provider if you do not know how to answer 

the questions on the forms. 

•  You must fill out all forms listed in these instructions (the Motion to Modify, the Affidavit in Support of 

Motion to Modify, the Affidavit of Service, Form 11.1 (if necessary), and Form 11.2).  

GENERAL INFORMATION 

When filling out the forms, be as accurate and as detailed as possible.  The hearing will be held before a district 
court judge or referee.  According to Minn. Stat. § 518A.39, subd. 2 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/518A/full#stat.518A.39), a court order for child support may be 
changed by showing that the current support order is unreasonable and unfair because of: 

•  Substantial increase / decrease in gross income of a party; 
•  Substantial increase / decrease in need of a party or the joint children involved in this court order; 
•  Receipt of public assistance; 
•  A change in the cost of living  for either party as measured by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics; 
•  A change in the obligee’s living arrangements  
•  Extraordinary medical expenses of the child not provided for under a health care plan; 
•  A change in the availability of appropriate health care coverage or a substantial change in the cost of 

existing health care coverage; 

•  The addition of work-related or education-related child care expenses of the obligee or a substantial 

increase or decrease in existing work-related or education-related child care expenses; 

•  The emancipation of a child.  Emancipation may occur by attaining the age of 18, graduating from high 

•  A change in the residence of the children. 
•  A change in either party’s Parenting Expense Adjustment, based on the number of court-ordered overnights 

school, or joining the military; 

each parent has with each child.  

If you are now ordered to pay child support and are requesting child support to be suspended because the 
children is/are living with you, you must provide proof.  Examples of things that you can file with the court as

proof are: 

•  a signed and notarized statement from the other party stating the children has/have changed residence 
•  school records 
•  day care records or medical records  
 

If you are ordered to pay spousal maintenance and are requesting spousal maintenance to be reduced, suspended, 
reserved, or terminated due to the obligee living with another adult, the court shall consider: 
•  whether the obligee would marry the adult companion but for the maintenance award; 
• 
the economic benefit the obligee derives from living with the other adult companion; 
• 
the length of time the obligee and the adult companion have lived together and the likelihood the living 
arrangement will continue in the future; and 
the economic impact on the obligee if maintenance is modified and the living arrangement with the other 
adult companion ends. 

• 

ote:  A motion to modify spousal maintenance based on the obligee living with another adult may not be 
brought within one year of the date of entry of the decree of dissolution or legal separation that orders spousal 
maintenance unless the parties have agreed in writing that the parties may modify the spousal maintenance 
award or the court finds that failing to allow the motion to proceed would create an extreme hardship for one of 
the parties.

punishable by jail or other sanctions. 

ather documents that support your reasons why the support order should be changed.  Examples of these 

documents include the following: 

•  Proof of your gross income (recent pay stubs, employer statements, or statements of receipts and 

expenses if you are self-employed.  Other documentation may include W-2 forms or copies of your tax 
returns for the most recent year) 

•  Proof of unemployment / disability (lay-off notice, doctor’s statement, etc.)

•  Verification of receipt and amount of social security income 
•  Verification of child care expenses

STEP 3 
FILL OUT THE “COVER SHEET FOR NON-PUBLIC DOCUMENTS” FORM 11.2.  
FILL OUT “CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION” FORM 11.1 WHEN NECESSARY 

OTE! 

 

 

Most documents filed with the court are considered public documents and are available to 
the public.  Certain information that is filed with the court may be considered confidential 
based on court rule and not available to the public.  To keep this information confidential 
and not available to the public, you must take certain steps that are described below. 

The steps listed below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  Filers who are using 
eFS to submit their court documents must identify and designate their filings as required in 
Minn. Gen. R. Pract. 11.03 and 14.06. 

Confidential Information Form 11.1 

All social security numbers, employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers (also called 
“restricted identifiers”) must not be listed on papers you file with the court. This is to protect your privacy, the 
other parties and your children.   Only provide social security numbers, employer identification numbers, and 
financial account numbers when the court requires this information to be provided to the court.  For example, if 
you must provide the court with bank account numbers, or medical account numbers, do not include any

account number in your document (your motion, supporting affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you must use Form 11.1 to 
list these confidential numbers.  

If account numbers are not required to be provided to the court, and the numbers appear on documents that are 
considered available to the public, (such as medical invoices or credit account numbers on statements) you must 
remove the number on the document before filing the document with the court. 

Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-public 
documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the time you file the 
documents with the court.  You must complete and file the “Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 
(also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public documents.  The most common non-public 
documents are called “financial source documents.”  Examples of financial source documents include: 
 

•  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and business expenses 
•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers   

You may also need to submit other documents that court rules identify as non-public documents, such as a 
medical record.  For example, a report from a doctor that provides a medical diagnosis or treatment plan for you 
or your child would qualify as a medical record.   

You must use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing other non-public documents, such as medical records, with 
the court.  One Form 11.2 cover sheet can be used for submitting all non-public documents.   

The failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being rejected by court 

administration, being available to the public, stricken from the court record, and sanctions from 
the court. 

See Rule 11 of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice for more information about how to file documents 
containing social security numbers, financial account numbers, “financial source documents” and other non-
public documents.   

Form 11.1 and Form 11.2 can be found at www.mncourts.gov/forms under the court forms category of 
“Confidential Information” and is court form number CON111 and CON112. 

STEP 4 
OBTAIN A HEARING DATE, TIME, AND LOCATION 
FROM COURT ADMINISTRATION  

•  Contact the court administrator's office in the county where your case is located.   

  Ask for a hearing date, time, location of the hearing, and the name of the judge or referee who will hear the 
matter.  The hearing date must be at least 24 days away from the date the motion papers are mailed to the 
other party.  Count the day before the hearing as Day 1, then continue to count backwards.

The other party must receive complete copies of all documents you 
have prepared for the hearing. This is called "service of process." The 
papers can be served personally (handed to the other party), or by mail.

Papers cannot be served on a legal holiday (as defined in Minn. Stat. 
§ 645.44, subd. 5, https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44#stat.645.44.5).  

If the other party is represented 
by an attorney, serve the other 
party’s attorney, instead of the 
party directly. 

The forms you have prepared can be served by any of the following: 

ho Can Serve 

•  The sheriff;

Check your documents to make sure all blanks are filled in, especially on the Affidavit of Service and the 
motion.  All papers served must be identical copies of the forms and supporting documents filed with the court. 

Pay the motion filing fee at the time you file this motion.  If you did not pay an initial filing fee when this case 
first began, you will be asked by court administration to pay the initial filing fee and library fees as well as the 
motion fee before your motion can be heard by the court.  Court administration will be able to tell you if you 
have paid the initial filing fee.
