General Information about Agreements Establishing Custody, Parenting 
Time, and Child Support for Unmarried Parents 

hildren’s Best Interests: The judge must make an order that is in the children’s best 
interests according to Minn. Stat. § 518.17 (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/518.17).  If 
the judge does not agree that terms of your joint petition is in the children’s best interests, 
the judge will not sign the order.  It is good practice to be able to explain why your agreements 
regarding custody, parenting time, and child support are in the best interests of the children. 

  C

Who May Use these Forms? 

Unmarried parents may use the Joint Petition (CHC107) only if all of these statements are true: 

1.  Parties agree on all issues about child custody, parenting time, and child support; and 

2.  There is no other person who is the alleged or presumed father; and 

3.  Parties have signed and filed a ROP for each child with the MN Department of Health, 
and they will file a certified copy of each ROP (or a copy of the certified copy) with the 
Joint Petition (CHC107). 

In what county should you file your case? 

According to Minn. Stat. § 518.156, subd. 1(2) (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/518.156), 
you must file your case to establish custody and parenting time: 

•  Where the child permanently lives; OR 

•  Where the child is currently found; OR 

•  Where there is an earlier court order for custody of the child. 

Do you have all the information you need to fill out the forms? 

You will need the following information to fill out the Joint Petition for Establishing Custody, 
Parenting Time, and Child Support set of forms: 

•  The name, address of each petitioner.  If child support is being requested, you also need the 

Social Security Number of each petitioner and child.  

•  The length of time each party and child have lived in Minnesota. 

•  Each child’s age and date of birth. 

• 

Information about any other court case involving the parties and children. 

•  Detailed agreement regarding child custody, parenting time, and child support. 

If child support is being requested, you also need:

o  Detailed financial information for each party. 
o  Proof of each party’s financial situation (for example, pay stubs, bank records, 

etc.). 

o  Worksheets from the Child Support Calculator (the calculator is found on the 

Minnesota Department of Human Service’s website at 
https://childsupportcalculator.dhs.state.mn.us/).  

•  Certified copy of the ROP for each child (or a copy of the certified copy).  The Minnesota 

Department of Health’s Office of Vital Records has directions on their website for 
purchasing certified copies of the ROP: 
https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/vitalrecords/rop.html#getcopy1.  The Office of Vital 
Records does not have a walk-in service.  If you have questions about how to get a 
certified copy of a filed ROP, you can email the Office of Vital Records at 
health.vitalrecords@state.mn.us, or call them at 651-201-5970.

B.  List the Judicial District.  Each county belongs in one of ten judicial districts.  If you need 
help, see http://www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx.  Leave the line for Court File 
Number blank.  

C.  Include the full name of one of the parents on the line for “Petitioner A.”  This parent will 

be “Petitioner A” throughout this case.  

D.  The other parent will be “Petitioner B.”  Include this parent’s full name 

on the line for “Petitioner B.” 

Do not switch names.  
Whichever parent is 
listed as “Petitioner A” 
in the caption should 
stay “Petitioner A” 
throughout all of the 
forms. 

PART 1 – INFORMATION  

In the first half of the Joint Petition (CHC107), you will be giving the court 
information about the parents, children, and other court cases. 

Information about the Parents

a

1.  In Paragraph #1, print or type information about Petitioner A. 

a.  Add Petitioner A’s full name and address.  Also include prior or other names Petitioner A 

has used (for example, a maiden name), if any. 

b

b.   This section is about the residency requirement.  Generally, Minnesota law requires that 
at least one of the petitioners has resided in Minnesota for at least 6 months before starting

CHC106      State       ENG      

Rev 1/21                   www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 4 of 21 

the custody case.  A parent may meet the residency requirement if they are in the military 
and stationed in Minnesota for at least 6 months, or if they have been a “domiciliary” of 
Minnesota for at least 6 months.   

“Domiciliary” is a legal term that is not easily defined, especially as it applies to residency 
for custody cases.  Please get legal advice if you have questions about the residency 
requirements. 

c.  Does Petitioner A receive public assistance or SSI (Supplemental Security Income) either 
for themselves or for the children?  If YES, there are 2 things the parents will need to 
do: 

•  Answer the follow-up question (explain what type of assistance and/or who the SSI 

benefits are for).  You may check more than one box. 

•  When this Joint Petition is completely filled out, you will need to follow-up with 
the public authority (the county attorney’s office) to see if they will approve of 
the parents’ agreement and sign the Joint Petition. 

The form (CHC107) includes enough space for information about 6 children.  If parents are asking 
the court to establish custody, parenting time, and child support for more than 6 children, then you 
will need to add the information for the other children on the Child Information Attachment form 
(CHC107-Ch).

•  Be sure to include a certified copy of the ROP for 

each child (or a copy of the certified copy). 

•  If you checked NO to anything in the ROP section 

above, you cannot use the Joint Petition (CHC107) to establish custody.   

•  If the ROP is from another state (not Minnesota), STOP.   The Joint Petition 
(CHC107) is designed for situations where the child was born in Minnesota, and 
parents signed and filed a Minnesota ROP.  If your situation involves another state, 
please get legal advice before using these forms. 

4.  This paragraph asks parents to let the court know whether they are involved in other court

PART 2 – AGREEMENT AND REQUEST FOR COURT ORDER 

In the second half of the Joint Petition (CHC107), you will be describing the agreement the parents 
have reached about child custody, parenting time, and child support.

Page 6 of 21 

You will see the phrase “best interests of the children” used throughout Part 2.  This phrase 
comes from Minn. Stat. § 518.17 (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/518.17).   
Parents are encouraged to look at the “Child-Focused Parenting Time Guide” (found 
online at http://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/CourtForms/Child-Focused-Parenting-Time-
Guide.pdf) and the factors listed in Minn. Stat. § 518.17 as they discuss what is best for the 
children. 

See Minn. Stat. § 518.003, subd. 3 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/518.003#stat.518.003.3), for definitions of legal and 
physical custody. 

NOTE: If there are more than 6 children, please continue your answers on the Custody Attachment 
(CHC107-Cus).

2.  Physical Custody. 

a.  List each child individually. 
b.  Check the box showing how physical custody should be granted. 

3.  Parenting Time.  Parenting time can be unsupervised, supervised, or reserved. 

Unsupervised – a parent’s time with the children does not need to be supervised. 

Instructions – Joint Petition for Establishing Custody, Parenting Time, and Child Support 
CHC106      State       ENG      

Rev 1/21                   www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 7 of 21 

Supervised – a parent’s time with the children must be supervised by someone else (the other 
parent, a relative, the county welfare department, or at a special parenting time center).  This is 
a limitation on a parent’s parenting time that is meant to protect the children’s physical or 
emotional health.  

Reserved – a parent whose parenting time is reserved will not have court-ordered parenting 
time.  This parent could ask the court at a later time for parenting time if circumstances change 
and spending time with the children is in the children’s best interests.  

NOTE: If you need more space, please use the Parenting Time Attachment (CHC107-PT).

a.  What have you agreed on for Petitioner A’s parenting time? 
b.  What have you agreed on for Petitioner B’s parenting time? 

 

 

c.  Parenting Time Schedule.  In this section, print or type the schedule you have 

agreed on.  Besides the regular schedule (Monday through Sunday), you can have 
special schedules for the following:

•  Summer,  
•  Holidays (include detailed information such as the name of the holiday and 

whether the holiday schedule includes weekends),  

•  School release days, and  
•  Birthdays.   

It may be easier to enforce a parenting time schedule that has specific details such 
as the time and location when transferring the children from one parent to the other, 
and who will provide transportation. 

Also include what you have agreed on regarding telephone contact with the 
children.  

 

d

d.  Average Number of Overnights.  This information is needed for the Child Support 

Calculator (See below).   

NOTE: A helpful handout called “Calculating the Number of Overnights” is 
found online at 

http://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/scao_library/SelfHelpCenters/documents/
Handout-Calculating-the-Number-of-Overnights-(002).pdf.  

 

hild support includes costs for the children for basic support for daily living expenses, health 

care coverage, uninsured and unreimbursed health care expenses, and child care expenses 
if child care is needed so the parent can work or attend school.  You can read more about these in 
the “Child Support” Help Topic online starting at http://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Child-
Support.aspx#tab01Overview. 

The Minnesota Department of Human Services has created an online Child Support Calculator 
for figuring out an amount for child support at:  

http://childsupportcalculator.dhs.state.mn.us

Rev 1/21                   www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 9 of 21 

For Paragraphs #4 - #7, you will need the worksheets from the 
calculator. You need income information for yourself and the other 
parent to use the calculator. This calculator will produce a dollar 
amount for support based on Minnesota law. If you think the amount 
of support should be higher or lower than what the calculator figured 
out, mark the box that says the amount is a "deviation" in child 
support. You may need to research the law or get help from an 
attorney if you wish to agree to a deviation.  

The worksheets must be included 
with the Joint Petition when you 
file your papers with court 
administration, even if you are 
agreeing to reserve child support.  

NOTE: If there is not already a court order for child support, the court must make an order about 
child support.  The court has to find that your agreements are in the best interests of the children, or 
the court will not sign the order section.  You can read about the factors the court must consider 
in Minn. Stat. § 518A.43 (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/518A.43). 

4.  Basic Child Support.  Parents can agree to one of the following: 

a.  One parent pays an amount for basic child support to the other parent as agreed upon in 

the Joint Petition; 

b.  If there is already a court order for child support, payment of child support can continue 

as has been ordered in another case; or 

c.  Parties can reserve basic child support (meaning there won’t be any basic child support 
ordered at this time).  If the court approves an agreement to reserve basic child support, 
either party can file a motion to set a basic child support amount in the future if 
circumstances change. 

Each option is explained in more detail below: 

Option a. 

a

If parents choose option a, there are several sections to fill out: 

Who Pays, Amount – One parent will pay the other parent a certain amount per month.  
First, tell which parent, Petitioner A or Petitioner B, will pay child support.  Then after 
the words “shall pay to,” tell which parent will receive child support.  On the blank line, 
print or type the monthly amount of basic child support.

Rev 1/21                   www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 10 of 21 

Guidelines or Deviation? – Compare the amount of basic support you included above 
with the basic child support amount listed on the worksheet from the Child Support 
Calculator.  If the amounts are 
the same, check the first box. 

If the amount you agreed on is 
different than what is listed in the 
worksheet, then your amount is a 
deviation.  A deviation can be  upward (more than the guidelines amount listed in the 
worksheet) or  downward (less than the guidelines amount).  You would check the 
deviation box, and then answer the follow-up questions. 

Which follow-up question should you choose? It depends whether the children 
receive public assistance. 

If the children do not receive public 
assistance, check the first box in the 
deviation section and explain why you and 
the other parent have agreed to a different 
amount for basic child support.  

OR 

If the children receive public assistance, 
check the second box.  Generally, a downward deviation of basic child support is 
not allowed when the children receive public assistance.  However, there may be an 
exception if it would be an extreme hardship to the obligor to pay the guidelines 
amount.  Give details in your explanation. 

 

How Paid – Describe how child support will be paid (through income withholding, or 
by direct payment).

Option b or Option c: 

b

If parents do not choose a, they can choose b or c: 

 

If there is a child support order already in place, and you do not want to change the child 
support amount, then check “b” and include the court file number of the child support case. 

 

5.  The next section is about medical and dental insurance for the children. 

If you agree to reserve basic child 
support, check “c” and explain how 
the children’s needs will be met and 
how this is in the best interest of the 
children. 

c

Medical Insurance 

There are 4 options for medical insurance: 

union; 

b.  One parent buys private medical insurance; 

a.  One parent gets medical insurance for the children through the parent’s employer or 

c.  If the children receive Medical Assistance, then one parent will need to pay an amount 

each month to reimburse the public authority (NOTE: this applies to each month that the 
obligor is not also receiving Medical Assistance); OR 

d.  Reserve the issue of medical insurance for the children. 

If parents choose option a: 

a

Check the box to show who will provide medical insurance for the children through that 
parent’s employer or union (Petitioner A or Petitioner B).  Then state whether the other 
parent will:

•  Not pay anything at this time. 

f parents choose option b: 

Check the box to show who will purchase private medical insurance for the children 
(Petitioner A or Petitioner B).  Then state whether the other parent will: 

•  Pay an amount (list how much) as part of the cost for medical insurance, or 
•  Not pay anything at this time.

There are 3 options for dental insurance: 

a.  One parent gets dental insurance for the children through the parent’s employer or 

union; OR 

b.  One parent buys private dental insurance; OR 
c.  Reserve the issue of dental insurance for the children. 

Include your agreements in the “Dental Insurance” section like you did in the “Medical 
Insurance” section above.

6.  Often there are medical and dental expenses that are not covered by insurance.  In Paragraph 
#6, include your agreement about these uninsured and unreimbursed medical and dental 
expenses. 

 

a.  Choose “a” if you have agreed on the percentage that each parent is going to pay 
AND on the details of the payment arrangement.  The percentage for Petitioner A 
and the percentage for Petitioner B should total 100% (for example: 100% + 0% = 
100% or 60% + 40% = 100% or 50% + 50% = 100%). 

NOTE:  Requests for payment from the other parent generally must be made within 
2 years of the date of the expense.

8.  Tell when the child support obligation will start.  You can list a specific date, or you can 
include a description like “on the first day of the month after the judge signs this order.”  

According to Minn. Stat. § 256.87, subd. 5 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/256.87#stat.256.87.5), a parent may be able to ask 
for up to 2 years of past support from the other parent.  Check the box if you and the other 
parent agree not to ask each other for past child support.  If you do not agree, you can use 
Paragraph #9 to describe your agreement about past child support. 

9.  Paragraph #9 is used if you have an agreement regarding custody, parenting time, or child 

support that the form has not asked about yet.

Once both parents are sure the form is complete, each will sign the Joint Petition under penalty 
of perjury.  This means you are saying that everything in the form is true and correct; if you 
know something in the form is not true when you sign it, you could be found guilty of the crime 
of perjury (see Minn. Stat. § 609.48, https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.48). 

Be sure to include the date, the location of each parent (county and state) when they sign this 
form, and then print your names and other information. 

Legal Representation 

 

 

Check the box for Petitioner A and for Petitioner B to say whether each petitioner is representing 
themselves or is represented by an attorney.  

Public Authority 

a

 

b

Minnesota law requires the public authority to review the Joint Petition if the parents or 
children receive public assistance.  You must complete this step before you file the 
Joint Petition. 

a.  If there is no public assistance, check this box. 
b.  If a parent or child receives public assistance, then contact the public authority in your 
county to ask them to review and sign this completed Joint Petition.  See Step 4 
(Public Authority/County Attorney) below for more information. 

Leave the Order section blank, unless court staff tell you to fill out any of the blanks.

Step 2 

Petitioner A – Fill Out the Financial Affidavit for Child Support (FAM102) 

Petitioner B – Fill Out the Financial Affidavit for Child Support (FAM102) 

Each parent fills out a Financial Affidavit for Child Support (FAM102) according to the 
Instructions – Financial Affidavit (FAM101).  You will use this form to give the court 
information about all of your (and the other parent’s) sources of income and other facts to help 
the court decide if your agreements are fair. 

These forms are available online: 

• 

Instructions for Financial Affidavit (FAM101) –
http://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/CourtForms/FAM101_1.pdf?ext=.pdf  

•  Financial Affidavit for Child Support (FAM102) – 
http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=18&f=282   

On other forms, such as the Financial Affidavit for Child Support, the caption at the top of the form 
has lines for “Petitioner” and “Respondent”  or “Plaintiff” and “Defendant” or a similar 
combination (not for “Petitioner A” and “Petitioner B” like the Joint Petition).   

 

Petitioner A’s full name goes on 
the line for the first party (in this 
case, the line for “Petitioner”). 

Petitioner B’s full name goes on 
the line for the second party (in 
this case, the line for 
“Respondent”).

OTE!    Most documents filed with the court are considered public documents and are 
available to the public.  Certain information that is filed with the court may be 
considered confidential based on court rule and not available to the public.  To 
keep this information confidential and not available to the public, you must take 
certain steps that are described below.   

The steps below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  Filers who are 
using eFS to submit their court documents must identify and designate their 
filings as required in Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 11.03 and 14.06. 

onfidential Information Form 11.1 

All social security numbers, employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers 
(also called “restricted identifiers”) must not be listed on papers you file with the court. This is to 
protect your privacy, the other parties and your children.   Only provide social security numbers, 
employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers when the court requires this 
information to be provided to the court.  For example, if you must provide the court with bank 
account numbers, or medical account numbers, do not include any account number in your 
document (your motion, supporting affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you must use Form 11.1 to list these 
confidential numbers.  

If account numbers are not required to be provided to the court, and the numbers appear on 
documents that are considered available to the public, (such as medical invoices or credit account 
numbers on statements) you must remove the number on the document before filing the document 
with the court. 

Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-
public documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the 
time you file the documents with the court.  You must complete and file the “Cover Sheet for Non-
Public Documents Form 11.2 (also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public 
documents.  The most common non-public documents are called “financial source documents.”  
Examples of financial source documents include: 

•  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and business 

  N

 

  C

expenses 

•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers   

You may also need to submit other documents that court rules identify as non-public documents, 

Instructions – Joint Petition for Establishing Custody, Parenting Time, and Child Support 
CHC106      State       ENG      

Rev 1/21                   www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 18 of 21 

such as a medical record.  For example, a report from a doctor that provides a medical diagnosis 
or treatment plan for you or your child would qualify as a medical record.   

You must use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing other non-public documents, such as 
medical records, with the court.  One Form 11.2 cover sheet can be used for submitting all non-
public documents.   

The failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being 

rejected by court administration, being available to the public, stricken from the 
court record, and sanctions from the court. 

See Rule 11 of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice for more information about how to file 
documents containing social security numbers, financial account numbers, “financial source 
documents” and other non-public documents.   

Fill out one Confidential Information Form 11.1 (CON111) and one Cover Sheet for Non-Public 
Documents Form 11.2 (CON112) according to the Instructions (CON110).  These forms are 
available online: 

•  CON110 – http://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/CourtForms/CON110.pdf?ext=.pdf  
•  CON111 – http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=11&f=30  
•  CON112 – http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=11&f=31  

NOTE: You can put both parties’ and the children’s Social Security Number, bank account 
numbers, etc., on the same Confidential Information Form 11.1 (CON111).  You can include 
both parties’ pay stubs and other financial documents on the same Cover Sheet for Non-Public 
Documents Form 11.2 (CON112).  
 

Step 4 

Public Authority 
County Attorney 

If you, the other parent, or any of the children receives public assistance, then contact the 
public authority in your county to ask them to review the completed Joint Petition.  The county 
child support office (public authority) in the county where the children live can put you in touch 
with the county attorney’s office.  See https://mn.gov/dhs/people-we-serve/children-and-
families/services/child-support/contact-us/county-offices.jsp.  

If the public authority agrees to the terms you included in the Joint Petition, then a representative 
of the public authority or county attorney’s office will date and sign the Joint Petition. 

If the public authority DOES NOT AGREE, you can talk to the public authority to see what their 
concerns are.  Maybe you can reach an agreement with the public authority.  If you cannot reach 
an agreement with the public authority, and a parent or child receives public assistance, then the 
joint petition form is not the right form for your situation.  You may need to get legal advice to 
see what your options are.

Rev 1/21                   www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 19 of 21 

NOTE:  The public authority can start a separate legal case under Minn. Stat. § 256.87, subd. 1 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/256.87), to ask for reimbursement of public assistance 
that the children received in the past (up to the past two years).  Before the representative of the 
public authority signs off on this agreement, you may ask if they will agree to waive the right to 
ask for reimbursement of past public assistance.  If they agree to this, you can add this agreement 
to Paragraph #9 – Other Agreement (for example:  “The public authority waives the right to ask for 
reimbursement of past public assistance expended on behalf of the children.”).  
 

Step 5 

File with Court Administration 

If you want copies of the forms you have filled out, make copies before you file them with the 
court. 

You will need to file the following forms with Court Administration:  

•  Joint Petition and any attachments;  
•  Certified copy of the Minnesota Recognition of Parentage (ROP) form for each child (or 

a copy of the certified copy); 

•  Worksheets from the online Child Support Calculator; 
•  Petitioner A’s Financial Affidavit for Child Support; 
•  Petitioner B’s Financial Affidavit for Child Support; 
•  Confidential Information Form; and 
•  Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents. 

You can file the forms in person at the courthouse, by mail, or electronically through the eFile 
and eServe (“eFS") tool (http://mncourts.gov/File-a-Case/File-in-A-District-Trial-Court.aspx).  

If you need to find the address of a courthouse, look online starting at http://mncourts.gov/Find-
Courts.aspx (choose the county from the drop-down menu and click “Go”). 

Filing Fee 

There will be a filing fee due when you file your paperwork (see http://mncourts.gov/Help-
Topics/Court-Fees.aspx). You can make checks payable to “District Court.”  

If you will be asking the court for a fee waiver because you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, 
both parties must fill out the forms in the In Forma Pauperis/IFP packet of forms (found online 
at http://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Fee-Waiver-IFP.aspx). Both parties must qualify for IFP 
status in order for the court to grant a fee waiver.  If a judge does not sign the fee waiver order, 
then you must pay the filing fee before court administration can process your forms.

What to Expect Next 

According to Minn. Stat. § 518.156, subd. 6 (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/518.156), 
the court will review all of the forms and attachments you have filed.   

You will hear from court administration soon after you file.  You might receive one or more of 
the following: 

•  Deficiency Notice (a notice that tells the parties there is a deficiency in their filing; for 

example, that something is missing or that a filing fee needs to be paid); 

•  Notice of Judicial Assignment (a notice that tells the parties the name of the judicial 

officer assigned to the case); or 

•  Notice of Hearing (a notice that tells the parties that a hearing has been scheduled and 

gives details such as the date, time, and location of the hearing). 

There must be a hearing in the case unless each party is represented by an attorney.  If either 
party is representing themselves, you can contact court administration to ask if the court will 
schedule a hearing, or if you will be expected to schedule the hearing.  

If the court approves your agreements, the judicial officer will sign the “Order” section of your 
Joint Petition.  Once court administration enters the signed Joint Petition, which is now a court 
order, you may want to get a copy (either plain or certified) of the order.  Having a copy is 
helpful in case there are questions in the future about custody, parenting time, or child support.  
There is a cost for copies (http://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Court-Fees/District-Court-
Fees.aspx?cat=copies&cookieCheck=true).  If the court has signed a fee waiver order within the 
last year, the copy costs may be waived.
