  F

a business):  

•  Notice of Levied Funds (JGM602) 
•  Exemption Form (JGM401)  
•  Exemption Form Instructions (JGM406) 

NOTE: These forms are not needed to levy on a business account. If you are collecting on a 
judgment against a business, contact court administration to request a Writ of Execution that you 
can deliver to the sheriff’s office in the county where the debtor’s financial institution is located.

he Court has forms and instructions, for some types of cases, as a general guide to the court 

process. These instructions explain the steps in more detail and answer common questions, but are 
not a full guide to the law. Court employees may be able to give general information on court rules 
and procedures, but they cannot give legal advice.

General Information about Levying on Funds at a Financial Institution 
General Information About Levying on Earnings  

he information in these instructions is a general guide to you to explain the legal process for 

levying on an account at a financial institution after being awarded a judgment against an 
individual (not a business). If you do not understand any of the following steps or do not know if 
these forms are right for your situation, you should speak with an attorney for legal advice. Court 
staff cannot give legal advice. 

he execution levy process can be used to try to collect a judgment that you won in court. While 

people commonly refer to this process as “garnishing” someone’s wages or bank account, 
“execution levy” is the technical legal term that generally applies when the sheriff helps to collect 
the judgment.  

ven if you win a judgment in court, it is not always easy to get paid. Sometimes a debtor’s 
income or assets are “exempt” from collection under Minn. Stat. § 550.37 . Exempt money or 
assets cannot be collected from the other party. To view a summary of property that is exempt 
from collection, visit http://www.mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=24&f=392 .  

•  “Judgment” is a word that means “the judge’s decision” or “the judge’s order.” 
•  "Creditor" is the party who won the case and is owed money (because a judgment was 

awarded by the court). 

•  "Debtor" is the party who lost the case and owes money to the creditor.  
•  "Entry" or "Entered" is the word used when a judgment is filed in the case by the 

Court Administrator. This usually starts the timeframe during which a judgment can be 
appealed. 

•  "Docketed" or “Docketing” is the word used when the creditor files an Affidavit of 
Identification form with the court. Docketing the judgment is the first step a creditor 
takes when he or she wants to try to collect payment of the judgment. 

•  “Levy” or “Execution Levy” is the action taken by the Sheriff to collect money owed to 

the creditor.  

•  “Financial Institution” generally refers to the bank where the debtor has an open account.  

xample: The creditor won the case against the debtor and a judgment was entered. The 
creditor docketed the judgment and set up an execution levy by the sheriff on the debtor’s 
account with the financial institution.  

 

  E

A judgment can be enforced at any time for ten (10) years from the date it was entered. It can also 
be “renewed” if not satisfied (paid) within the 10 years.

NOTE: The steps listed below can be followed to try to collect a judgment when the debtor is an 
individual who has money in an account at a financial institution (such as a bank) and you have 
information about the debtor’s financial institution.  

f you do not already know this information about the debtor, you will not be able to levy on the 
debtor’s funds until you collect this information. To read more about how to find out this 
information through the Financial Disclosure form (JGM301), visit

1.  Fill in the county where the judgment was entered. If you are unsure of any information 

needed for the caption, you can find this information on any official court document from 
your case.  

2.  Fill in the Judicial District for the county where the judgment was entered. If you do not 

know the Judicial District, you can find a map with all of the Judicial Districts at 
http://www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx . 

3.  Fill in the Court File Number from the case where the judgment was docketed. 

Sometimes the court assigns a new Court File Number when a judgment is docketed (for 
example, the Court File Number will be different for a Conciliation Court case where a 
judgment was entered than for the District Court case opened to docket the judgment). Be 
sure to enter the Court File Number for the case where the judgment was docketed.  
4.  Fill in the case type. This will generally be “Civil,” but in some cases it could also be 

something like “Restitution Judgment,” “Dissolution,” or “Support.”  

5.  Fill in your first, middle, and last name as the creditor.  
6.  Fill in the first, midde, and last name of the debtor.  
7.  Fill in the name of the debtor’s financial institution.  

There is no need to write anything on the form where it says “Your account balance is _____” or 
“The amount being held is _____” because this information will be provided by the debtor’s 
bank. Leave these two areas blank.  

Complete the caption on the Exemption Form (JGM401) the same way as above, but leave the 
rest of this document blank. 

On the Exemption Form Instructions (JGM406), fill in your name and address, as well as the 
name and address of the financial institution, so that the debtor knows where to mail his or her 
Exemption Form (JGM401) if necessary.  

 

Step 2 

Make copies of the completed forms.  

Make copies of your completed forms: 

• 1 copy of the Notice of Levied Funds (JGM602) for your records.  
            • 1 copy of the Exemption Form Instructions (JGM406) for your records. 
            • 2 copies of the Exemption Form (JGM401) – 1 for your records, and 1 for the sheriff to 
serve on the financial institution.

Step 3 

Get a Writ of Execution from court administration.  

ontact court administration in the county where your judgment was docketed and request a Writ 

of Execution. Contact information for court administration in each county can be found here: 
http://www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx (choose your county from the drop-down menu and 
click “Go”).  

The name on the debtor’s bank account must be the same as the name of the judgment debtor on 
the Writ of Execution, otherwise the financial institution will not collect the money. It is possible 
to levy on a joint account as long as the debtor is named on the account.  

Court administration will charge a fee for issuing the Writ of Execution, but this fee can be 
added to the amount of the judgment owed. If you cannot afford to pay this fee, you can ask for a 
fee waiver by completing the application in the In Forma Pauperis/IFP packet of forms (found 
online at www.mncourts.gov/forms). If a judge does not sign the order granting you a fee waiver, 
then you must pay the fee before court administration can issue the Writ of Execution.  

A Writ of Execution is an order issued by District Court telling the sheriff to collect money to 
satisfy a judgment. The Writ should be directed to the sheriff of the county where the debtor’s 
financial institution is located. For example, if the debtor’s bank is in Anoka County, the Writ 
should be directed to the Anoka County Sheriff’s Department. A Writ of Execution expires 180 
days after the date it was issued by court administration.

Step 4 

Deliver the Writ of Execution and other paperwork to the sheriff’s office 
for service. 

When you get the Writ of Execution from court administration, you will need to sign it and 
deliver it to the sheriff’s office that will be collecting the judgment for you (this is sometimes 
called “conducting a bank levy”). If the judgment debtor is an individual (not a business), you 
will also need to give the sheriff’s office copies of these forms you completed in Step 1: 

• Notice of Levied Funds (JGM602) – 1 copy 
            • Exemption Form Instructions (JGM406) – 1 copy 
            • Exemption Form (JGM401) – 2 copies

www.mncourts.gov/forms                  Page 5 of 7 

ou must also give the sheriff’s office a check for $15 witten out to the debtor’s financial 

institution. The sheriff will give the check to the financial institution when they serve the Writ of 
Execution. The sheriff’s office may also require you to pay a deposit to help cover its costs for 
executing the Writ.  

Money in the debtor’s bank account is frozen the day the sheriff serves the Writ of Execution 
and the other paperwork on the financial institution. The financial institution will serve the 
Notice of Levied Funds, Exemption Form Instructions, and two copies of the Exemption Form on 
the debtor by sending them in the mail to their last known address within two business days of 
being served by the sheriff. The debtor then has 14 days from the date of mailing to complete the 
Exemption Form, attach bank statements for the prior 60 days, and send one copy of these 
documents to the creditor (you) or the creditor’s attorney and one copy to the financial 
institution.  

If the debtor properly completes the Exemption Form and delivers copies within 14 days, all 
money that the debtor claims is exempt will be unfrozen and released by the financial institution 
back to the debtor unless you file an objection to the exemption.  

Step 5 (Optional) 

Complete the Creditor’s Notice of Objection and Notice of Hearing on 
Exemption Claim and send copies to the debtor, the financial institution, 
and the court.  

f you do not agree with the exemptions claimed by the debtor, you can complete the Creditor’s 
Notice of Objection and Notice of Hearing on Exemption Claim (JGM403). You must file the 
objection with the court along with a $1 filing fee. Court administration will schedule a hearing 
date that will take place five to seven days later. After the hearing date has been filled in, make 
three copies of the objection form. One copy will be for you to keep for your records, and the 
other copies will be for the debtor and the financial institution.  

You must mail or deliver one copy of the completed objection form (with the hearing date filled 
in) to the financial institution and one copy to the debtor within six business days of receiving 
the exemption claim by the debtor. The debtor can request more time for the court hearing by 
sending notice to you and to the court, but the rescheduled hearing must happen within seven 
days of the original hearing.

You must attend the court hearing to explain your objection to the debtor’s exemption claim. The 
court will issue an order deciding whether the debtor’s funds are exempt within three days of the 
hearing. If you do not know how to prepare for the hearing, it is a good idea to get legal advice.
