Support Agency is involved in your case, you must arrange for the County Attorney’s Office to 
be served as well.   

 copy of the “Notice of Motion, Motion and Affidavit to Contest Request for Payment of 
Unreimbursed or Uninsured Health Care Expenses” and any supporting documents must be 
served upon all parties, either personally or by mail.  If a party is represented by an attorney, the 
forms and supporting documents must be served on the attorney instead of the party, at the 
attorney’s office. 

The forms you have prepared can be served by any of the following: 

ho Can Serve 

•  The sheriff; 
•  Another adult; or 
•  You. 

ersonal Service 

The server hands the other party (or their attorney, if they have one) one copy of your completed 
forms and attachments, or leaves them at the other party’s place of residence with some person 
of suitable age and discretion who also lives at the same residence.  Forms must be hand-
delivered  at least 14 days before the hearing date.  NOTE: If responding to the other party’s 
motion, the forms must be personally served at least 5 days before the hearing date. 

ervice by Mail 

The server mails a copy of your forms to the other party (or their attorney, if they have one) by 
first class U.S. mail at least 17 days before the hearing date. The server must drop the letter in 
the mailbox or give it to the postal worker.  NOTE: If responding to the other party’s motion, the 
forms must be mailed at least 8 days before the hearing date. 

ARNING:  The  Court  may  ignore  your  response  if  you  do  not  serve  and  file  the 

responsive papers on time. 

STEP 5

fter a copy of your forms is hand-delivered or mailed to the other party (and to the County 
Attorney, if applicable), the person who did the service must fill out an Affidavit of Service form 
and sign it under penalty of perjury. Perjury is the crime of intentionally lying or misrepresenting 
the truth.

After it has been signed, make one copy of the Affidavit of Service for your records. 

STEP 6 
FILE THE FORMS AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS WITH COURT 
ADMINISTRATION AND PAY ANY REQUIRED COURT FEE 

ile the following forms and supporting documents with court administration in the county 
where your case is located as soon as possible but no later than 5 days before the scheduled 
hearing.  It is best to go to the Courthouse to file your forms, in case there are any questions or 
problems.  

  The “Notice of Motion, Motion and Affidavit to Contest Request for Payment of 

Unreimbursed or Uninsured Health Care Expenses” 

•  Copies of documents the other party sent to you (for example, bills, statements, etc.) 
•  The signed “Affidavit(s) of Service” 

iling by facsimile:  Any paper may be filed with the court by fax.  If documents are filed by fax, 

the original documents must not be filed, but you must keep all original documents and make 
them available to the court or any party upon request. 

ourt Fees 

There is no motion filing fee for this motion.  However, if you did not pay an initial filing fee 
when this case first began, you will be asked by court administration to pay it now. Court 
administration will be able to tell you if you have paid the initial filing fee. 

f a fee is owed and you cannot afford to pay the fee, a judge may waive it under certain 
circumstances.  Ask Court Administration for the In Forma Pauperis (IFP) (Fee Waiver) forms 
or download the forms at http://www.mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=19&p=69. You need to 
fill out the forms and sign them. Your fee waiver forms will be reviewed by a judge who will 
determine whether you must pay the filing fee or if it can be waived.  If the judge does not sign 
the form which waives the fee, you must be prepared to pay the filing fee.   

STEP 7 
APPEAR AT THE HEARING 

ome to court on the date and time scheduled for the hearing allowing extra time for traffic, 
courthouse security, and finding the courtroom.  Be sure to bring the papers the other party sent 
you, and your copy of the “Notice of Motion, Motion and Affidavit to Contest Request for 
Payment of Unreimbursed or Uninsured Health Care Expenses” and supporting documents.  If 
you have additional documents to offer into evidence bring a copy for the judicial officer, one for 
the other parent, one for the county attorney, and one for yourself.
