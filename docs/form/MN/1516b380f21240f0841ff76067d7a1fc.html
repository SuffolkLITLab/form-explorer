General Information about Third Party Custody 

hese Instructions are for responding to a Petition for Third Party custody.  If you were not served with 

a Petition for Third Party Custody, then you should not be using these forms.  Third Party Custody is 
when someone other than the child’s biological, adopted, or legal parents are asking for custody.   

oes the Petitioner (or Co-Petitioner if there is one) have a legal right to ask for 

custody of a child who is not his or her child (this is called “standing”)? 

ccording to Minnesota law, a person can ask for third party custody if they are a “de facto custodian” or “an 
interested third party.”  The following definitions from Minn. Stat. § 257C.01, subd. 2 and 3, should help you 
determine if the Petitioner (or Co-Petitioner if there is one) meets the definition of a “de facto custodian” or an 
“interested third party.” 

EFINITION OF “DE FACTO CUSTODIAN” 

A.  If the child is under three years old, a Petitioner may qualify as a “de facto custodian” if all of 

the following statements are true: 

their home; and 

•  The Petitioner has been the  primary caretaker to the child while the child was living in 

•  The child lived with the Petitioner for at least 6 out of the last 24 months.  The months do 
not have to be consecutive (in a row).  (For example, the time can be 1 month with the 
Petitioner, 2 weeks not with the Petitioner, 2 weeks with the Petitioner—just so the total 
amount of time is 6 out of the last 24 months); and  

•  During this time, neither parent was residing in the Petitioner’s home, and the parents have 

not consistently participated in the child’s life. 
 

B.  If the child is more than three years old, a Petitioner may qualify as a “de facto custodian” if 

all of the following statements are true: 

•  The Petitioner has been the primary caretaker to the child while the child was living in 

their home; and 

•  The child lived with the Petitioner for at least 12 out of the last 24 months.  The months do 
not have to be consecutive (in a row).  The time can be, for example, 1 month with the 
Petitioner, 2 weeks not with the Petitioner, 2weeks with the Petitioner—just so the total 
amount of time is 12 out of the last 24 months; and  

•  During this time, neither parent was residing in the Petitioner’s home, and the parents have 

not consistently participated in the child’s life. 

EFINITION OF “INTERESTED THIRD PARTY” 

A Petitioner may qualify as an “interested third party” if he or she is not a de facto custodian and one or 
more of the following statements is true: 

•  The parents have abandoned, neglected, or otherwise show a disregard for the child’s 

wellbeing and the child would be harmed by living with either parent; or 

•  The child is in physical or emotional danger if the child lives with either parent; or 
•  Other grave and weighty reasons make it necessary for the child to live with the Petitioner 

and for the Petitioner to have legal custody.

hat if the child is in danger? 

n Order for Protection (OFP) or a Child Protection (CHIPS) order may be options in extreme situations as a 
way to get temporary custody. An OFP will not permanently change custody and you still need to go to court to 
ask for permanent custody.   For information about Orders for Protection, contact your local courthouse (or 
County Domestic Abuse Service Center if your county has one).  For information about Child Protection 
orders, contact your local County Child Protection office.   

n extremely rare cases, a judge will make a temporary decision about custody before a full hearing with sworn 
testimony has been held.  Those rare cases may be where the child is in immediate, significant danger if the 
existing custody arrangement continues

The court has to consider every single “best interest factor” 
when deciding the custody arrangement that you want, so it 
is very important that you answer every question and give 
specific details. 

Answer all the questions.  You may 
need to continue your answers on 
other sheets of paper (do not write in 
the margins or on the back of the 
pages). 

Do not just restate the question in your answer.  For 
example, when asked how close you are to the children, do 
not just write “I am very close to the children.”  Instead, give details that show how close you are.  For 
example, “I listen to the children when they are sad or upset; we go to the park together every weekend; 
we read together before bed every night; etc.”

a.  One of the best interest factors in Minn. Stat. § 257C.04, subd. 1 is the reasonable preference of the 

child, if the court believes the child is of “sufficient ability, age, and maturity to express an 
independent, reliable preference.”   

If you believe one of the children meets these requirements, then list that child, his or her preference, 
and age. 

b

 

b.  Include the name of the children’s primary caretaker.  A primary caretaker provides most of the 
day-to-day care and decision-making for each child.  Examples of caregiving include preparing 
meals, attending medical appointments, disciplining, helping the child get dressed, reading to the 
child, providing transportation to activities, and looking over homework.  If at different times in each 
child’s life, different people have been the primary caretaker, name all adults who have provided this 
care and when that care took place.  If this person is not you, the other parent, or the Petitioner, this 
person should also be listed in the chart at #12 on CHC702. 

c.  Tell about the closeness of the relationship between each child and each party, and with anyone else 

who is significant in each child’s life (for example, a grandparent or cousin). 

d.  Tell about how each child plays, talks, opens up to or interacts with the all of the parties, with 

brothers and sisters, and with anyone else who is significant in each child’s life (for example, a 
grandparent or cousin). 

e.  Tell about how each child has adjusted (or not) to life at home, in school, and in the community. 

f.  Do the children currently live in a safe, stable place?  Check YES or NO.  Then answer the follow-up 

questions.

Then describe how permanent your family is or how permanent the people are in your home.  For 
example: Have the people living in the home been there for a while?  Have you lived in one house or 
apartment for a period of time, or are there frequent moves? 

h.  Describe the mental and physical health of everyone involved in this case.  If there is not enough 
space on the lines for your full answers, continue writing your answers on another piece of paper.

•  Explain whether you are able to give each child love, affection, and guidance; and 
•  Explain how you will do this.

tribe, then check YES, and list the names of the children.  You will also need to list the name of the 
tribe, if you know it. 

Check NO if the children are not members of, or eligible for enrollment in, an Indian tribe.  If you 
do not know, then check UNKNOWN. 

Is either parent a member of, or eligible for enrollment in, an Indian tribe?  If YES, then list the 
name of the tribe.   

If the answer to either of these questions is YES, then the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), the 
Minnesota Indian Family Preservation Act, and other laws give rights to the Indian child’s family 
and tribe.  The tribe has the right to receive notice of any family law proceeding where someone 
other than the child’s parent is seeking custody of the child.  It is a good idea to get legal advice if 
you think this applies to your case. 

•  Explain whether you are likely to continue educating and raising the children in their 

k.  This question has two parts: 

culture, religion and creed; and 

•  Explain how you will do this. 

l.  There are three parts to this question: 

•  Whether there has been any domestic abuse between any of the parties in this case; 
• 
• 

If YES, who has been involved in the domestic abuse; and 
If YES, how the domestic abuse has affected the children. 

 

4.  This question asks if you know about a child support order that orders a parent to pay or reserves the 

issue of child support.

1.  You can ask the court to dismiss the entire petition.  That means you are asking the court to say no to all 

of Petitioner’s requests for custody, parenting time, and/or child support. 

2.  You can ask the court to issue an order in this case for custody, parenting time, and/or child support.  If 
you choose #2, then you will need to fill out the rest of the form to let the court and the other parties 
know the details of your request. 

Legal custody refers to the right to make decisions about how to raise the child, including decisions 
about education, health care, and religious training.  

Physical custody refers to the right to make decisions about the routine day-to-day activities of the 
child and where the child lives. 

Joint custody means sharing the rights and responsibility with someone else.  Sole custody means 
only one person may make the important decisions about the child. 

See Minn. Stat. § 518.003, subd. 3 (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/518.003).

5.  You do not have to fill in anything at #5.  This is standard language in many court forms. 

erification, Acknowledgements, Signature and Signature Block 

Read the Verification and Acknowledgments very carefully. When you sign your name to this 
Counterpetition, you are telling the court that you are telling the truth in the Counterpetition and that your 
requests are made in good faith.  If you are not telling the truth, if you are misleading the court, or if you are 
using this Counterpetition for an improper purpose, the court can order you to pay money to the other party 
or impose other sanctions.   

Date and sign the last page of the Counterpetition (CHC702), and then print your name, address, phone 
number, and e-mail address. 

Step 3 

Fill out the “Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents” Form 11.2 

Fill out “Confidential Information” Form 11.1 when necessary 

Most documents filed with the court are considered public documents and are available 
to the public.  Certain information that is filed with the court may be considered 
confidential based on court rule and not available to the public.  To keep this 
information confidential and not available to the public, you must take certain steps that 
are described below.   

The steps listed below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  Filers who are using 
eFS to submit their court documents must identify and designate their filings as required 
in Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 11.03 and 14.06.   

Confidential Information Form 11.1 

All social security numbers, employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers (also called 
“restricted identifiers”) must not be listed on papers you file with the court. This is to protect your privacy, 
the other parties and your children.   Only provide social security numbers, employer identification numbers, 
and financial account numbers when the court requires this information to be provided to the court.  For 
example, if you must provide the court with bank account numbers, or medical account numbers, do not 
include any account number in your document (your motion, supporting affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you must 
use Form 11.1 to list these confidential numbers.

www.mncourts.gov/forms                  Page 15 of 19 

If account numbers are not required to be provided to the court, and the numbers appear on documents that 
are considered available to the public, (such as medical invoices or credit account numbers on statements) 
you must remove the number on the document before filing the document with the court. 

Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-public 
documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the time you file the 
documents with the court.  You must complete and file the “Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 
11.2” (also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public documents.  The most common non-public 
documents are called “financial source documents.”  Examples of financial source documents include: 

•  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and business expenses 
•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers   

You may also need to submit other documents that court rules identify as non-public documents, such as a 
medical record.  For example, a report from a doctor that provides a medical diagnosis or treatment plan for 
you or your child would qualify as a medical record.   

You must use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing other non-public documents, such as medical records, 
with the court.  One Form 11.2 cover sheet can be used for submitting all non-public documents.   

The failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being rejected by court 
administration, being available to the public, stricken from the court record, and sanctions 
from the court. 

ee Rule 11 of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice for more information about how to file documents 
containing social security numbers, financial account numbers, “financial source documents” and other non-
public documents.   

Form 11.1 and Form 11.2 can be found at www.mncourts.gov/forms under the court forms category of 
“Confidential Information” and is court form number CON111 and CON112.

Supporting Documents 

If you have any supporting documents (such as police reports or domestic abuse orders) that you want the 
court to see, then be sure to label these supporting documents very clearly (for example: Attachment 1).  If a 
document supports a statement you have made in your Counterpetition (CHC702), then be sure to mention 
the document in your answer (for example, you can write “See Attachment 1” if that attachment supports 
your answer). 

There is a packet of forms online that includes Instructions (FAM901) and a blank List of Supporting 
Documents (FAM903).  See http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=18&p=127. 

Copies for Each Party 

Make copies of the completed Answer and Counterpetition (CHC702), the Financial Affidavit for Child 
Support, and any supporting documents.  You need to make a copy for each of the parties listed in the 
caption. 

ou may need more copies: 

• 

• 

If there is any public assistance, you will need an extra copy for the county support agency.  See 
Step 6 below. 
If either of the parents are eligible for membership or members of an Indian tribe, you will need a 
copy for the tribe. 

You have to arrange for the other parties to get copies of all of your forms.   

The forms you have prepared can be served by any of the following: 

ervice 

Who Can Serve 

•  The sheriff; 
•  Another adult; 
•  You. 

ne way the documents can be served is by U.S. Mail.   

•  The server places one copy of the completed Answer and Counterpetition (and all attachments) in an

envelope. 

of the envelope.   

•  The server places the correct amount of postage on the envelope (the server may want to take the 

envelope to the post office to be weighed to make sure there is sufficient postage).   

The papers can also be served “personally” (handed to the other party). This is called “personal service.”  

NOTE: Papers cannot be served on a legal holiday as described in Minn. Stat. § 645.44, subd. 5 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44).

Step 5 

Completing the Affidavits of Service (SOP102 or SOP104) 

fter the Answer and Counterpetition along with the supporting documents are served, then the person who 

served them (the “server”) must fill out an Affidavit of Service.  Use the Affidavit of Service by Mail 
(SOP104) if the papers were served by mail.  If the forms were served personally, then the person who 
served them must fill out the Affidavit of Personal Service (SOP102).  You will need a separate Affidavit of 
Service for each party that was served. 

hese affidavits of service tell the court when, where, and how a copy of your papers were served on each 

party. 

Step 6 

Giving Notice to the Public Authority 

f anyone involved in the case receives public assistance from the State of Minnesota, or receives county 
child support services, then you must mail or hand-deliver a Notice to the Public Authority (DIV813) and a 
copy of the Answer and Counterpetition to the Public Authority (usually the county support agency) in the 
county where the third party custody case has been filed. 

ou have to do each of the following steps: 

•  Fill out the Notice to the Public Authority (DIV813) form, and make a copy.   
•  Make one copy of Confidential Information Form (CON111) (see Step 3 above). 
•  Make a copy of the Answer and Counterpetition. 
•  Mail or hand-deliver a copy of DIV813, CON111, and the Answer and Counterpetition to the county 

support agency.     

•  Fill out the Affidavit of Mailing or Delivery of Notice to the Public Authority (DIV816).  You will 
file the original DIV813, the original DIV816, and the original Answer and Counterpetition with 
Court Administration (see Step 7). 

Step 7 

Filing the Forms with the Court, Filing Fee 

ile the following with the court: 

•  The Answer and Counterpetition (CHC702), and all attachments; 
•  All Affidavits of Service or Admissions of Service proving that all of the parties have been served;

•  Financial Affidavit for Child Support (FAM102);  
•  Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 (CON112); and 
• 

If it applies, the following two forms: 

o  Original Notice to the Public Authority (DIV813); and 
o  Affidavit of Mailing or Delivery. (DIV816). 

There is a filing fee due when you file.  You can make checks payable to “District Court.” 

If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can ask for a fee waiver by completing the forms in the In 
Forma Pauperis/IFP packet of forms.   If a judge does not fully grant the fee waiver, then you must pay the 
filing fee before Court Administration can process your forms.  

Step 8 

Getting an Order 

hat happens next depends on what the other parties might do and the facts of your case.  You must attend 

all hearings that you receive notice about.   

MPORTANT:  If you need help deciding what steps you should take after filing the Answer and 
Counterpetition, you should talk to an attorney.
