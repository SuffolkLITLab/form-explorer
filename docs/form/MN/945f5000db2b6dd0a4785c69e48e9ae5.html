Instructions – Petition to Decrease or Waive Bond 
GAC301     State       ENG 

Rev 3/21                   www.mncourts.gov/forms

Minn. Stat. § 524.5-415 (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/524.5-415) gives the court the 
ability to require a conservator to purchase a conservatorship bond. A conservatorship bond is a 
type of surety bond which protects the assets of the person subject to conservatorship. 

Conservatorship bonds protect against theft, fraud, misrepresentation, or improper handling of 
assets by the conservator. The amount of the bond needed depends on the amount of assets that are 
under the control of the conservator: 

• 

• 

If the person subject to conservatorship has limited assets, the court may find that a bond is 
not needed.  

If the value of the personal property of the person subject to conservatorship is at least 
$10,000, the judge will require the conservator to post a bond.  

Why might a conservatorship bond be decreased? 

The amount of a conservatorship bond required by the court might be lowered if the assets of the 
person subject to conservatorship under the control of the conservator: 

•  Decrease to be under $10,000; or 
•  Are placed in a restricted account that prevents access to the assets by the conservator; or 
•  Are required by the Veterans Administration to have a separate bond for VA funds. 

Do you have all the information you need to fill out the forms? 

The Petition to Decrease or Waive Surety Bond form (GAC302) asks for the following 
information: 

•  The county and Judicial District number where the Conservatorship case was filed; 
•  The court file number of the case; 
•  The bondable asset value of the person subject to conservatorship according to the last 

annual accounting report filed; 

•  Whether a bond has been filed in the case and, if so, the date and value; and 
• 

If the Veterans Administration has required a bond, the amount and evidence of that bond.

evidence of that bond along with your Petition.  

5.  Check a box to ask the court to either decrease the surety bond that was previously ordered by 

the court or to waive the surety bond altogether.  

Step 2 
Sign the Petition to Decrease or Waive Bond (GAC302) 

ign the Petition form and print your phone number, date of birth, and e-mail address in the 
blanks under the signature line. When you sign the Petition, you are signing under penalty of 
perjury. This means you are saying that everything in the form is true and correct; if you know 
something in the form is not true when you sign it, you could be found guilty of the crime of 
perjury (see Minn. Stat. § 609.48, https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.48). 

Step 3 

•  Serve the Person Subject to Conservatorship,  
Interested Persons, and the Surety 

•  File the Completed Forms with the Court 

ake copies of the completed form. Keep one copy for your own records and mail one to the 
person subject to conservatorship and to interested persons listed in the conservatorship case.  
You must also serve the surety at the address shown in the conservatorship case and to any other 
address that is known to you for that surety. Complete an Affidavit of Service 
(Guardianship/Conservatorship) (GAC 2-U) giving the details of when, where, and how you 
served the person subject to conservatorship, interested persons, and the surety.  

File the affidavit and your completed Petition to Decrease or Waive Surety Bond form with the 
court. A motion fee must be paid when you file the Petition (see http://mncourts.gov/Help-
Topics/Court-Fees/District-Court-Fees.aspx?cat=probate&cookieCheck=true). Check with court 
administration in the county where the conservatorship case is located for information on the 
exact fee.  

Step 4 

•  Wait to Hear from the Court 
•  Attend the Court Hearing, if One Is Scheduled

nce you have filed your paperwork with the court, the judge will hold a hearing to approve or 
deny your petition. If a hearing is scheduled, court administration will send you a notice with the 
hearing details. If the judge decides that a hearing is not needed, court administration will send 
you a copy of the order issued by the judge either granting or denying your petition.  

If the judge does schedule a hearing, you must appear at the hearing and be ready to testify to the 
facts included in your petition. If your petition is approved at the hearing, the judge will sign an 
order that decreases or waives the surety bond.  

What to Expect Next… 

nce you get an order, read it carefully.  It will contain important information. 

If the court changes the amount of the surety bond, you will need to take your order to the 
bonding company. 

If the court decreases the surety bond, you will need to file a new bond with the court (the order 
may have more details).
