General Information about Third Party Custody 

hese Instructions are for starting a court case to establish custody of a child who is not your 

biological, adopted, or legal child.   

now all of your options before filing for Third Party Custody.  There are many options for either 
temporary or permanent custody of a child who is not your own child.  These options may include 
the following: 

•  Delegation of Parental Authority (not a court proceeding, good for up to one year, signed 

by a parent and the person taking custody, but is limited in nature); 

•  Standby Custodian (if a parent named you as the standby custodian and the reason for 

having the standby custodian has happened); 
•  Third Party Custody (through the Family Court); 
•  Child Protection (known as CHIPS through the Juvenile Court); 
•  Guardianship (through the Probate Court); 
•  Adoption (through the Juvenile Court). 

o you have a legal right to ask for third party custody? 

efore you complete these papers, you should determine if you have a legal right to seek 

custody of a child who is not your child (this is called “standing”). 

ccording to Minnesota law, you have standing if you are a “de facto custodian” or “an 

interested third party.”   Use these forms only if you are a "de facto custodian" or an "interested 
third party."   The following definitions from Minn. Stat. § 257C.01, subd. 2 and 3, should help 
you determine if you are a “de facto custodian” or an “interested third party.” 

EFINITION OF “DE FACTO CUSTODIAN” 

A.  If the child is under three years old, you may qualify as a “de facto custodian” if all 

of the following statements are true: 

•  You have been the  primary caretaker to the child while the child was living in 

your home; and 

•  The child lived with you for at least six (6) out of the last twenty-four (24) 

months.  The months do not have to be consecutive (in a row).  (For example, 
the time can be one month with you, two weeks not with you, two weeks with 
you—just so the total amount of time is six (6) out of the last twenty-four (24) 
months); and  

•  During this time, neither parent was residing in your home, and the parents have 

not consistently participated in the child’s life. 
 

B.  If the child is more than three years old, you may qualify as a “de facto custodian” 

if all of the following statements are true:

•  You have been the primary caretaker to the child while the child was living in 

your home; and 

•  The child lived with you for at least twelve (12) out of the last twenty-four (24) 
months.  The months do not have to be consecutive (in a row).  The time can be, 
for example, one month with you, two weeks not with you, two weeks with 
you—just so the total amount of time is twelve (12) out of the last twenty-four 
(24) months; and  

•  During this time, neither parent was residing in your home, and the parents have 

not consistently participated in the child’s life. 

DEFINITION OF “INTERESTED THIRD PARTY” 
You may qualify as an “interested third party” if you are not a de facto custodian and one or 
more of the following statements is true: 

•  The parents have abandoned, neglected, or otherwise show a disregard for the 
child’s well-being and the child would be harmed by living with either parent; 
or 

•  The child is in physical or emotional danger if the child lives with either parent; 

or 

•  Other grave and weighty reasons make it necessary for the child to live with 

you and for you to have legal custody. 

MPORTANT - If you do not qualify as a “de facto custodian” or an “interested third party” and 
you wish to bring a custody action, you should contact an attorney.  DO NOT use these forms if 
you do not qualify in one of the two ways listed above (“de facto custodian” or “interested third 
party”). 

hat if the child is in danger? 

n Order for Protection (OFP) or a Child Protection (CHIPS) order may be options in extreme 
situations as a way to get temporary custody. An OFP will not permanently change custody and 
you still need to go to court to ask for permanent custody.   For information about Orders for 
Protection, contact your local courthouse (or County Domestic Abuse Service Center if your 
county has one).  For information about Child Protection orders, contact your local County Child 
Protection office. 

n extremely rare cases, a judge will make a temporary decision about custody before a full 
hearing with sworn testimony has been held.  Those rare cases may be:  

•  where the child is in immediate, significant danger if the existing custody arrangement 

• 

continues; or  
if you have the child and you have strong reason to believe that if you serve the Summons 
and Petition, the parent(s) will take the child from you, and that the child will be harmed or 
be in immediate danger.   

he Minnesota Judicial Branch does not publish any forms to ask for third party custody on 

an emergency basis.  You might find sample forms at a law library or from a legal publisher. If

you want to ask for an emergency ex parte order giving you temporary custody until a hearing or 
an accelerated hearing date, your Summons and Petition for Third Party Custody must be 
completely filled out first.   

n what county should you file the third party case? 

ccording to Minn. Stat. § 257C.03, subd. 1, you must file your third party custody case in the 
county where the child permanently lives, or where the child is found, or where there is an earlier 
court order for custody of the child.

ill out the Petition for Third Party Custody form.  This form tells the court the facts of your case: 

information about the children and the parents, and the type of custody and parenting time that you are 
asking for.  

he Petition is a long form, and it is very important that you provide details for the court.  If you do not 

provide enough information, the court cannot make a decision about custody.  When answering the 
questions, please do not write in the margins or on the back of the pages.  Instead, if you need more room, 
use a new sheet of paper to finish writing your answer. 

ou are creating a formal legal document, so please use proper capitalization.  Instead of “john smith” or 
“JOHN SMITH,” only the first letters of names should be capitalized: “John Smith.”  How the completed 
form looks may create an impression, and you want that impression to be positive. 

Fill out the caption like you did on the Summons.  See 
Step 1, above.

Check this box if the parents have abandoned, neglected, or shown a disregard for the 
children’s wellbeing, and if the children would be harmed by living with either Parent A or 
Parent B.  If you check this box, you must also explain why you have checked it.  Use 
another sheet of paper to continue writing your answer if you run out of room. 

Check this box if the children would be in physical or emotional danger if they lived with 
either parent, and explain why. 

Check this box if there are other “grave and weighty reasons” (very important reasons) that 
make it necessary for the children to live with you.  The laws about third party custody do 
not define “grave and weighty reasons.”  If you are not sure whether you should check this 
box, then please talk to an attorney.   

arents’ Involvement with the Children 

n this section, you will be giving the court details about how Parent A and Parent B have been involved in the 
children’s lives.

ustody – What Is Best for the Children 

13.  Best Interests of the Children 

he court has to consider every single “best interest factor” when deciding whether to grant you custody of 
someone else’s children, so it is very important that you answer every question and give specific details. 

o not just restate the question in your answer.  For example, 
when asked how close you are to the children, do not just write 
“I am very close to the children.”  Instead, give details that show 
how close you are.  For example, “I listen to the children when 
they are sad or upset; we go to the park together every weekend; 
we read together before bed every night.” 

Answer all the questions.  You 
may need to continue your 
answers on other sheets of paper 
(do not write in the margins or on 
the back of the pages). 

  T

  D

The best interest factors are found in Minn. Stat. § 518.17, subd. 1 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/518.17#stat.518.17.1).  

a.  One of the best interest factors in Minn. Stat. § 518.17, subd. 1(a) is the reasonable preference of the 

child, if the court believes the child is of “sufficient ability, age, and maturity to express an 
independent, reliable preference.”   

If you believe one of the children meets these requirements, then list that child, his or her preference, 
and age.

b.  Write the name of the children’s primary caretaker.  A primary care taker provides most of the day-
to-day care and decision-making for each child.  Examples of caregiving include preparing meals, 
attending medical appointments, disciplining, helping the child get dressed, reading to the child, 
providing transportation to activities, and looking over homework.  If at different times in each child’s 
life, different people have been the primary caretaker, name all adults who have provided this care and 
when that care took place.  If this person is not you or one of the parents, this person should also be 
listed in the chart at paragraph 8(b) on CHC603.  

c.  Tell about the closeness of the relationship between each child and each party, and with anyone else 

who is significant in each child’s life (for example, a grandparent or cousin). 

d.  Tell about how each child plays, talks, opens up to or interacts with the all of the parties, with brothers 
and sisters, and with anyone else who is significant in each child’s life (for example, a grandparent or 
cousin).  

e.  Tell about how each child has adjusted (or not) to life at home, in school, and in the community.

f.  Do the children currently live in a safe, stable place?  Check YES or NO.  If YES, then answer the 

follow-up questions.  If NO, explain your answer. 

g.  List all of the people who live with you in your home (except for the Co-Petitioner and the children 

who are a part of this third party custody request).  

Then describe how permanent your family is or how permanent the people are in your home.  For 
example: Have the people living in the home been there for a while?  Have you lived in one house or 
apartment for a period of time, or are there frequent moves?

h.  Describe the mental and physical health of everyone involved in this case.  If there is not enough 
space on the lines for your full answers, continue writing your answers on another piece of paper. 

i.  This question has two parts: 

•  Explain whether you are able to give each child love, affection, and guidance; and 
•  Explain how you will do this. 

j.  Describe the children’s cultural background.  Then answer the questions about membership in an 

Indian tribe. 

j

 

Indian tribe.  If any of the children are either members of, or eligible for enrollment in, an Indian tribe, 
then check YES, and list the names of the children.  You will also need to list the name of the tribe, if 
you know it. 

Check NO if the children are not members of, or eligible for enrollment in, an Indian tribe.  If you do 
not know, then check UNKNOWN. 

Is either parent a member of, or eligible for enrollment in, an Indian tribe?  If so, which tribe? 

If the answer to either of these questions is YES, then the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), the 
Minnesota Indian Family Preservation Act, and other laws give rights to the Indian child’s family and 
tribe.  The tribe has the right to receive notice of any family law proceeding where someone other than 
the child’s parent is seeking custody of the child.  It is a good idea to get legal advice if you think this 
applies to your case.  

•  Explain whether you are likely to continue educating and raising the children in their culture, 

k.  This question has two parts: 

religion and creed; and 
•  Explain how you will do this. 

l.  There are three parts to this question: 

•  Whether there has been any domestic abuse between any of the parties in this case; 
• 
• 

If YES, who has been involved in the domestic abuse; and 
If YES, how the domestic abuse has affected the children.

Your Requests (Custody, Parenting Time, Child Support) 

 In the first two parts, you gave the court information.  In Part 3, 
you are telling the court and the other parties what you are 
asking the court to order. 
In the first two parts of the Petition (CHC603), you have stated 
facts about the children, the parents, and the situation in general.  

In Part 3, you will state what you want the court to order.  This will repeat some information from the first part 
of the Petition.  Both parts must match.  For example, if you said earlier that you want to share joint legal custody 
with a Co-Petitioner, then your request in the last part of the Petition should match.

1.  Legal and Physical Custody. 

 

Legal custody refers to the right to make decisions about how to raise the child, including decisions about 
education, health care, and religious training.  

Physical custody refers to the right to make decisions about the routine day-to-day activities of the child 
and where the child lives. 

Joint custody means sharing the rights and responsibility with someone else.  Sole custody means only one 
person may make the important decisions about the child. 

See Minn. Stat. § 518.003, subd. 3 (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/518.003). 

a.  What are you asking for regarding legal custody?  

b.  What are you asking for regarding physical custody? NOTE: If you are asking the court to share 
joint physical custody with someone else, you will need to describe the schedule – when will each 
of you have the children?

c.  If you asked for joint legal custody in “a,” or for joint physical custody in “b,” then answer the 

questions in this section (i-iv). 

 

arenting Time 

  

In paragraphs 2 and 3, you are telling the court what you want each parent’s “parenting time” to be.  Minn. Stat.  
§ 518.003, subd 5 (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/518.003), defines parenting time as the time a parent 
has with the child regardless of who has custody. 

his next section explains your options: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

If it is best that the children spend time with the parents, you can check the box for “unsupervised 
parenting time.”  Then you will be asked to give a parenting time schedule for each parent. 
If it is best for the children that a parent be supervised while with the children, you can check “supervised 
parenting time.”  Be prepared to explain the following:  
o  Why the parenting time should be supervised; 
o  Who will supervise the parenting time; and 
o  Who will pay the cost for supervising, if there is any? 

If it is best for the children that they not be around a parent, you can ask that the parenting time be 
“reserved.”  Reserved parenting time means that the court would not order any parenting time right now.  
You will have to explain why a parent should not have any parenting time. 

If things change, a parent can go back to court and ask for parenting time later, once it is safe for the 
children to be around the parent.

Step 3 

 

OTE! 

Most documents filed with the court are considered public documents and are available 
to the public.  Certain information that is filed with the court may be considered 
confidential based on court rule and not available to the public.  To keep this 
information confidential and not available to the public, you must take certain steps 
that are described below.   

The steps listed below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  Filers who are 
using eFS to submit their court documents must identify and designate their filings as 
required in Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 11.03 and 14.06.   

onfidential Information Form 11.1 

All social security numbers, employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers (also called 
“restricted identifiers”) must not be listed on papers you file with the court. This is to protect your 
privacy, the other parties and your children.   Only provide social security numbers, employer

identification numbers, and financial account numbers when the court requires this information to be 
provided to the court.  For example, if you must provide the court with bank account numbers, or medical 
account numbers, do not include any account number in your document (your motion, supporting 
affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you must use Form 11.1 to list these confidential numbers.  

f account numbers are not required to be provided to the court, and the numbers appear on documents 
that are considered available to the public, (such as medical invoices or credit account numbers on 
statements) you must remove the number on the document before filing the document with the court. 

over Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-public 
documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the time you file the 
documents with the court.  You must complete and file the “Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 
11.2 (also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public documents.  The most common non-
public documents are called “financial source documents.”  Examples of financial source documents 
include: 

•  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and business expenses 
•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers   

ou may also need to submit other documents that court rules identify as non-public documents, such as a 

medical record.  For example, a report from a doctor that provides a medical diagnosis or treatment plan 
for you or your child would qualify as a medical record.   

ou must use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing other non-public documents, such as medical 

records, with the court.  One Form 11.2 cover sheet can be used for submitting all non-public documents.   
  

The failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being rejected by 
court administration, being available to the public, stricken from the court record, and 
sanctions from the court.

answer (for example, you can write “See Attachment 1” if that attachment supports your answer). 

here is a packet of forms online that includes Instructions (FAM901) and a blank List of Supporting Documents 

(FAM903).  See http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=18&p=127. 

opies for Each Party 

Make copies of the completed Summons (CHC602), Petition (CHC603), and any supporting documents.  You need 
to make a copy for the following people: 

•  Yourself (bring your copy with you to any court hearing); 
•  Co-Petitioner (if any); 
•  Parent A; 
•  Parent B; and 
•  Legal Guardian or Custodian. 

ou may need more copies: 

• 

• 

If there is any public assistance, you will need an extra copy for the county support agency.  See Step 7 
below. 
If the children are members of an Indian tribe, you will need a copy for the tribe. 

ervice 

You have to arrange for the other parties to get copies of all of your forms.  One party is not allowed to serve the 
other party, so you have to arrange for someone else (someone who is at least 18 years old and who is not a party 
in this case) to hand-deliver the papers to the other parties (this is called “personal service”). 

•  You can ask a friend or family member to serve for you. 
•  You can hire the sheriff’s office in the county where the party lives. 
•  You can hire a professional process server. 
•  An exception to personal service is when a party says they will accept the papers from you and that they 

will sign a form called Waiver of Service (CHC604).  Then you can be the one to hand-deliver or mail the 
papers to that party.   

f you do not know where a party lives, you might try asking friends or relatives who might know where the person 
is.  You could also look online. 

Step 5 

Completing the Affidavits of Service (SOP102) 

fter the Summons, Petition and supporting documents are served, then the person who served them (the “server”) 

must fill out the Affidavit of Personal Service (SOP102).  You will need a separate Affidavit of Service for each 
party that was served.

These affidavits of service tell the court when and where a copy of the Summons and Petition (and any supporting 
documents) were served in each party. 

Step 6

Representation and Parties (CIV102) 

he two forms in this section do not have to be served on the Co-Petitioner or Respondents.

IV102 

Fill out the Confidential Information Form (CON111).  You will need to add extra lines in the caption for all of the 
parties (the top of the form) because the form has only one blank for petitioner and one blank for respondent. 

hen list the names of each party and each child in the middle section, and list the person’s social security number.  

If you do not know a person’s social security number, it is okay to write “unknown.” 

Fill out the Certificate of Representation and Parties (CIV102) form.  Again, you will have to add extra lines to fit 
all of the parties in the caption. 

On the second page is where you start to list the names and contact information for all parties that are not 
represented by an attorney.  Since there are not enough blocks for each party, you will need to add another sheet of 
paper if there is a Co-Petitioner, or if there is more than one Respondent. 

Step 7 

Giving Notice to the Public Authority 

f you, either of the parents, or any of the children receive public assistance from the State of Minnesota, or receive 
child support services from a county, then you must mail or hand-deliver a Notice to the Public Authority (DIV813) 
and a copy of the Summons and Petition to the  Public Authority (usually the county support agency) in the county 
where you are filing your third party custody case. 

ou have to do each of the following steps: 

•  Fill out the Notice to the Public Authority (DIV813) form, and make a copy.   
•  Make one copy of Confidential Information Form 11.1 (CON111) (see Steps 3 and 6 above). 
•  Mail or hand-deliver a copy of DIV813 and CON111 to the county support agency (this time, it is okay for 

you to do the service). 

•  Fill out the Affidavit of Mailing or Delivery of Notice to the Public Authority (DIV816).  You will file a 

copy of DIV813 and the original DIV816 with Court Administration (see Step 8).

Filing the Forms with the Court, Filing Fee 

ile the following with the court: 

•  The Summons (CHC602) and Petition (CHC603) for Third Party Custody, and all attachments; 
•  All Affidavits of Personal Service or Admissions of Service proving that all of the parties have been served; 
•  Confidential Information Form 11.1 (CON111); 
•  Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 (CON112), if needed;  
•  Certificate of Representation and Parties (CIV102); and 
• 

If it applies, the following two forms: 

o  Copy of the Notice to the Public Authority (DIV813); and 
o  Affidavit of Mailing or Delivery… (DIV816). 

There is a filing fee due when you file.  You can make checks payable to “District Court.” 

If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can ask for a fee waiver by completing the forms in the In Forma 
Pauperis/IFP packet of forms.   If a judge does not sign the fee waiver order, then you must pay the filing fee 
before Court Administration can process your forms.  

Step 9 

Getting a Court Date 

hat happens next depends on what the Respondents do and the facts of your case.  After you file your forms (see 

Step 8 above), you will receive a notice in the mail from Court Administration that gives you more information 
(like the name of the judge or referee assigned to the case).

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
