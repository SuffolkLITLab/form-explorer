      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS 
Petition for Postconviction Relief 

f you have been convicted of a crime and cannot file an appeal (because you have already appealed 
your case, or the time to appeal has run out), you may still be able to challenge your conviction and 
sentence by filing a Petition for Postconviction Relief in district court.   

If you cannot afford an attorney to represent you in a postconviction proceeding (a court action after 
you have been convicted and sentenced), you can contact the Appellate Public Defender’s office to 
see if you qualify to be represented by a public defender. 

Office of the Minnesota Appellate Public Defender 
540 Fairview Ave N, Suite 300 
St. Paul, MN 55104 
(651) 201-6700 

You can find the statutes regarding “Postconviction Relief” in Minn. Stat. ch. 590 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/590).  There may be other rules, statutes, and case law that 
you should know about, so getting legal advice is very important.  

Helpful materials may be found at your public county law library. For a directory, see 
http://mn.gov/law-library/research-links/county-law-libraries.jsp. For more information, contact 
your court administrator or call the Minnesota State Law Library at 651-297-7651.  

If you decide to represent yourself, these instructions describe the steps you need to take.

5.  Hearing 

 

Are you asking the court for a hearing on your Petition for Postconviction Relief?  The court may 
not schedule a hearing even though you have asked for one. If the court schedules a hearing, the 
hearing may not be in person. The judge may order that the hearing will be held by video or 
telephone. 

SECTION C: THE SIGNATURE BLOCK 

 

1.  Date the Petition.  

2.   Sign your name.   

3.   If you do not have an attorney representing you, check the “Self-Represented” box.   

4.   Print your name and contact information.   

5.  If you are an attorney representing the petitioner, include your attorney license number and 

the name of your law firm. 

 

Step 3 

Prepare the Memorandum of Law (CRM1204) - Optional 

The “postconviction statutes” (Minn. Stat. ch. 590, 
https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/590) do not require petitioners to file a 
Memorandum of Law.   

However, many petitioners choose to file a Memorandum of Law, which allows you to give the 
district court the specific legal arguments that you believe entitle you to relief.   

If your arguments to the district court are based only on facts that are already part of the record 
in your case, you might choose to file a Memorandum of Law instead of asking for a hearing.  
This helps provide the district court with the facts and authority the district court needs to decide 
your case.  Even if you are requesting a hearing in your Petition, a Memorandum of Law may 
still be useful to help the court better understand the issues your case presents, the law that 
applies, and how the facts that you intend to establish at the hearing will entitle you to relief.

Page 4 of 8 

If you decide to file a Memorandum of Law, use CRM1204.  You may need to do some legal 
research to decide what arguments to make, what facts to include, and what legal authorities to 
cite in your Memorandum of Law. 

Step 4 

Make Copies and 
Arrange for Service on the MN Attorney General,  
County Attorney, and if applicable, the City Attorney 

COPIES 

Make copies of all of the forms you have prepared for the court (including the Petition for 
Postconviction Relief and the Memorandum of Law, if any) for: 

  The Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, 
  The County Attorney’s Office in the county where the conviction happened,  
  The City Attorney if the case was prosecuted by a city attorney, and 
  Your records. 

ERVICE OF PROCESS 

You have to arrange for the Minnesota Attorney General, County Attorney, and if applicable, the 
City Attorney to receive complete copies of all documents you have prepared for the court.  This 
is called “service of process.”  Papers cannot be served on a legal holiday.  

For more information, see the “Service of Process” Help Topic on the court’s website at 
http://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Service-of-Process.aspx.  

Service by Mail:  You or another adult (for example, a friend or family member, sheriff’s 
deputy, or process server) will need to mail copies of your forms to the Minnesota Attorney 
General, County Attorney, and if applicable, the City Attorney.   Regular first class mail is all 
that is required. 

Minnesota Attorney General’s Office - http://www.ag.state.mn.us/ 
445 Minnesota St., Suite 1400 
St. Paul, MN 55101 

To find the address for the county attorney’s office, visit 
the MN County Attorneys Association’s website at 
https://mcaa-mn.org/page/links.  On the “Resource

Step 5 

 Proof of Service (Postconviction Relief) (CRM1203) 

After the papers are served on the Attorney General,  County 
Attorney, and if applicable, the City Attorney, the person who served 
the papers (the server) must fill out the  Proof of Service 
(Postconviction Relief) form (CRM1203).  This completed form will 
be your proof that the papers were served. 

1.  Fill out the top part of the form (the caption) the same way you did on the Petition. 

2.  The server’s name goes on this line.  

3.  The date the papers were mailed goes on this line.  

4.  This line is for the city and state the papers were mailed from. 

  

5.  Identify which papers were mailed.  If you check “Other,” write in the names of the other 

documents. 

6.  Identify which entity was served by checking the boxes.   

a.  For the county attorney: 

  Write the name of the county next to the words “County Attorney’s Office,” and  
  Write the address where the papers were mailed on the lines underneath. 

b. If the city attorney was served: 

  Write the name of the city next to the words “City Attorney’s Office,” and

Page 6 of 8 

  Write the address where the papers were mailed on the lines underneath. 

7.  Next, the server should complete the bottom of the form.  When the server signs the  Proof of 
Service, they are signing under penalty of perjury.  Perjury is the crime of intentionally lying 
or misrepresenting the truth. 

  

Step 6 

File Documents with Court Administration 

 File the following forms with court administration in the county where the conviction happened: 

  Petition for Postconviction Relief, 
  Memorandum of Law (if you have one), 
  Proof of Service (showing that the Attorney General, County Attorney, and if applicable, 

the City Attorney were served), 

  Any other document you prepared for the court in this postconviction proceeding. 

There is no filing fee to file these forms. 

If you need to find the address of a courthouse, look online starting at http://mncourts.gov/Find-
Courts.aspx (choose the county from the drop-down menu and click “Go”). 
 

What Happens Next? 

After you file your Petition for Postconviction Relief, the prosecuting authorities (Attorney 
General, County Attorney, or City Attorney) will have 20 days to file a response unless the 
district court gives a different time period.  See Minn. Stat. § 590.03 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/590.03). After the 20 days have passed, the district 
court will begin considering your Petition.   

The Court may not schedule a hearing even though you have asked for one in your petition.  A 
district court may deny a petition for postconviction relief without a hearing if the petition and 
the record “conclusively show that the petitioner is entitled to no relief.”  Minn. Stat. § 590.04, 

Instructions – Petition for Postconviction Relief 
CRM1201      State       ENG     11/19                   www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 7 of 8 

subd. 1 (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/590.04). If the court denies your Petition 
without a hearing, it will issue a written order that explains its reasons. 

If the district court decides to have a hearing on your Petition, you will be notified by mail of the 
date and time of the hearing.  The hearing may not be an in-person hearing; the judge may order 
that the hearing will be held by video or telephone. At this hearing, you will typically be allowed 
to present any evidence and testimony that you believe is necessary to show that you are entitled 
to the relief requested in your Petition.  The State will also have an opportunity to present its 
own evidence and testimony, and will be allowed to cross-examine any witness who testifies on 
your behalf, including yourself.  You also may be given the opportunity to argue your Petition 
orally to the district court. 

After the hearing, the court will usually take the matter under advisement and will issue a written 
decision regarding your Petition for Postconviction Relief.  The court’s order usually has a 
memorandum that sets out the facts of the case, summarizes the arguments of the parties, and 
explains its reasons for the decision reached.  Although the postconviction statute does not 
provide a specific deadline by which the district court must decide your postconviction Petition, 
the statute says that a court should do so “promptly” and you are generally likely to hear 
something from the court within 30 or 60 days.  See Minn. Stat. § 590.04, subd. 1. 

If the district court denies your Petition for Postconviction Relief, or grants you less relief than 
you asked for in your Petition, you may appeal the district court’s decision to the Minnesota 
Court of Appeals within 60 days of the entry of the postconviction order.  See Minn. Stat.  
§ 590.06 (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/590.06) and Minn. R. Crim. P. 28.02, subd. 4 
(3)(c) (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/court_rules/cr/id/28/#28.02).
