General Information About Starting a Civil Lawsuit 

he information contained in this document is not intended as legal advice but as a general guide 

to you to explain the legal process. If you do not understand any of these procedures, talk to an 
attorney. Court staff cannot give legal advice.  

  T

Important! This packet covers only the very beginning of a civil lawsuit. 

If you are thinking about starting a civil lawsuit, you are strongly encouraged to get legal 
advice about your situation to see if you have a valid legal claim. It is especially important 

to get legal advice if your claim involves real estate. 

If you decide to represent yourself, you will be expected to know and understand the court rules 
and procedure, and everything else that is involved in representing yourself.  

Representing Yourself 

Helpful resources include: 

•  “What to Expect as a Self-Represented Petitioner or Defendant in a Civil Trial” a booklet 

on the MN Judicial Branch website at http://www.mncourts.gov/Help-
Topics/Representing-Yourself-in-Court.aspx   

•  General information about civil lawsuits (civil cases) is found online at 

http://www.mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Civil-Actions.aspx.   

•  There are very specific rules about civil lawsuits. The rules are located in the Minnesota 
Rules of Civil Procedure and the Minnesota Rules of Practice. These rules can be found 
online at http://www.mncourts.gov/SupremeCourt/Court-Rules.aspx.  

•  Unless the court issues an order saying something different, what you file will become a 
public record and can be viewed by the public.  You can find the Rules of Public Access 
to the Records of the Minnesota Judicial Branch online at 
https://www.mncourts.gov/SupremeCourt/Court-Rules.aspx . 

Forms for Starting a Civil Lawsuit 

A civil lawsuit begins by preparing documents (Summons and Complaint) and having them 
personally served on the other party(ies) or the other party(ies) waiving service. These forms and 
the process are explained in more detail below.

Make Copies of the Summons and Complaint 

After the Summons and Complaint are completed and signed, you need to make copies.  Make 
one copy for each Defendant and one copy for you (the originals will be filed with the court 
later).   

Step 3 

Step 4 

Serve the Summons and Complaint on the Defendant(s) 

•  You must have the other party(ies) served with copies of the signed Summons and 

Complaint and any attachments.  This is called "service of process."  There are three 
different ways the Defendant(s) can be served:  

o  Personal service,  
o  Service on someone who lives with the Defendant and is of suitable age, and  
o  Waiver of service (if the Defendant waives service).

www.mncourts.gov/forms                  Page 7 of 18 

Each type of service is explained below.  For more general information about service of 
process, go to the “Service of Process” Help Topic at http://www.mncourts.gov/Help-
Topics/Service-of-Process.aspx. 

•  Personal Service: Someone who is over the age of 18 and not a party to the case must 
serve the other party(ies); you cannot serve the papers yourself. The paperwork must 
be served personally (handed to the other party). Papers cannot be served on a legal 
holiday as defined in Minn. Stat. § 645.44, subd. 5 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44#stat.645.44.5). If you do not have 
someone that can serve the papers for you, you can contact the Sheriff’s Office in the 
county where the Defendant lives, or hire a private process server. There is a fee for the 
Sheriff’s Office to serve the papers.  If you cannot afford to pay the service fees, you can 
ask the court for a fee waiver.  See Step 8 below for more information.   

OTE: If the other party is represented by an attorney, serve the other party’s attorney 

instead of the party directly.  

•  Service to Someone Who Lives with the Defendant: The Defendant can be handed a 

copy of the Summons and Complaint personally or a copy of the Summons and 
Complaint can be handed to a person “of suitable age and discretion” at Defendant’s 
home if that person lives with Defendant. Mailing the Summons and Complaint by 
regular mail or certified mail is not personal service. 

•  Waiver of Service - Generally, the Defendant has a duty to avoid causing you to pay 

unnecessary costs of serving the Summons and Petition on them.  Rule 4.05  of the Rules 
of Civil Procedure says that you may ask that the Defendant waive service of the 
Summons and Petition.  To ask the other party to waive personal service of a summons, 
you must send the other party the following items by first-class mail:  

o  A copy of the Summons and Complaint  
o  CIV022A (Notice of Lawsuit and Request for Waiver of Service of Summons)  
o  Two copies CIV022B  (Waiver of Service of Summons); and 
o  A prepaid way (such as a self-addressed, stamped envelope) for the other party to 
return a signed copy of the Waiver of Service of Summons (CIV022B) to you. 
 

Once the Defendant receives these forms, the Defendant may mail the Waiver of Service 
of Summons back to you in the prepaid envelope that you provided. 

  N

  W

arning:  If the Defendant does not sign and return the Waiver of Service to you, the 

papers are not considered served.  If that happens, you must serve the Defendant by 
Personal Service.  If the Defendant is in the United States, and does not return the Waiver 
of Service of Summons to you within 30 days, then the court can order the Defendant to 
pay the costs of serving the forms.

Step 5 

Proof of Service  

After service is complete, you must have proof that service was correctly done. The forms 
that you will need depend upon how you served the Defendant. 

•  Personal Service:  If you had the Defendant served personally, the server (the person 
who personally served the Defendant will then fill out an Affidavit of Personal Service 
(SOP102) form. This form serves as your proof for the Court that papers were served on 
the other party.  If there is more than one Defendant, you will need a separate Affidavit of 
Service for each Defendant.  
 

1.  Fill in the caption the same as you did for the Summons and Complaint 

YOU: 

(see Steps 1 and 2, above).   

1.  Fill in the server’s name and date of birth. 

2.  Fill in the date the server handed the papers to the other party. 

3.  List all of the papers the servers handed to the other party (Summons and 

Complaint and any other paperwork). 

THE 
SERVER: 

4.  Fill in the other party’s name. 

5.  Fill in the location (where) the server handed the papers to the other party. 

6.  Fill in the server’s name, address, and telephone number.  Server should 
sign and date the form, and list what county and state they are in when 
they sign the Affidavit of Personal Service. 

fter the server signs the Affidavit of Personal Service (SOP102), make one copy for your records. 

The original is filed with the Court as part of Step 8 below. 

•  Waiver of Service: If you had the Defendant waive service, the Defendant will then fill 
out the Waiver of Service of Summons. This form serves as your proof for the court that 
papers were served on the other party.  If there is more than one Defendant, you will need 
a separate Waiver of Service of Summons for each Defendant.

Step 6 

Wait to see if the Defendant serves an Answer 

If you served the Defendant personally, the Defendant has 21 days to respond in writing.  If you 
served the Defendant by Waiver of Service, the Defendant has 60 days to respond in writing.  
The Defendant must respond through an Answer to the Summons and Complaint.  The days to 
respond start the day after the Summons and Complaint are served or mailed to the Defendant. 
You and the Defendant have the opportunity to work out a solution to your lawsuit.  If you are 
unable to come to an agreement, you must file your documents with the court.

H.  Fill in what issues you and the Defendant do not agree on. 

I.  Look at Form 23 (http://www.mncourts.gov/Documents/0/Public/Rules/RCPform23_-
_revised_01-01-09.pdf ) in order to fill in the correct case type.  Form 23 lists the 
different names of case types.  For example, if your case is an employment case, you 
would write “Employment” or if your case is a personal injury case, you would write 
“Personal Injury.” 

J.  Fill in the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) that you would like to use, the provider 
you are intending to use, and the proposed dates.  If you do not think ADR will work for 
the case, explain why.  You can find information about ADR under the Alternative 
Dispute Resolution (ADR)/Mediation Help Topic at http://www.mncourts.gov/Help-
Topics/AlternativeDisputeResolution.aspx .  If you have questions about what type of 
ADR is best for your case, you should talk to an attorney.

Step 9 

Prepare for court. 

 

K.  If you do not have an attorney, sign the form and fill in your contact information.  You 
can leave the Attorney License and Firm lines blank.  If you have an attorney, your 
attorney should  complete this section. 

You will need to file the following original forms with Court Administration: 

•  Summons (CIV802); 
•  Complaint (CIV803); 
•  Affidavit of Personal Service (SOP102) or Waiver of Service of Summons (CIV022B); 

and 

•  Civil Cover Sheet (CIV117).  

here will be a filing fee due when you file your paperwork. You can find the fees online at 

www.mncourts.gov/fees and select your county on the drop-down menu.  You can make checks 
payable to “District Court Administrator.”  You can also pay by cash and credit card.  

ou are required to file the case with the court no later than one year after personal 

service on the Defendant.   

  Y

If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, or the cost of service, you can ask for a fee waiver by 
completing the forms in the In Forma Pauperis/IFP (fee waiver) packet of forms (found online 
at http://www.mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=19&p=69).   If a judge does not sign the fee 
waiver order, then you will need to pay the filing fee before Court Administration will process 
your forms.   

Step 8 

File the originals with the court.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
