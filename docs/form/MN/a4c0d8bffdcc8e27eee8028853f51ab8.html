From the Judges of Family Court 
 
What to Expect… 
 
DIVORCE 
 
in Minnesota 

opyright permission  granted by  Manifesto Continere  (Gerald  B.  Keane,  esq.)  with  credit to  the  Sarasota  County  Bar  Association and the  Florida 

Twelfth Circuit Family Division Judges. 

ntroduction      
  A  divorce  can  be  a  painful  and  difficult  experience,  but  if  you  understand  the  functions  and  limitations  of  the  legal  system,  the 
process becomes less frustrating. It is our hope, as Judges of Family Court, that this pamphlet will give you a better understanding of 
the process, and help you get through your divorce with realistic ideas and goals.  A divorce action is called “marriage dissolution” or 
“dissolution.” 

Minnesota’s divorce system is based on the principle of “no-fault,” meaning that a dissolution will be granted if either party believes 
that the marriage is over.  Generally the causes of the failure of the marriage are not an issue in court.  All that matters is that the 
marriage needs to be ended. 
   It is impossible for us to heal the emotional wounds created by your divorce.  You must understand that the legal system is not a 
tool for punishment of your spouse.  The courtroom isn't the place for revenge.  We must decide your case on the basis of unique 
facts.  In most cases, the law does not permit us to compensate either of you for the other’s misconduct.  

  The best way to conclude your case is to settle it.  Through compromise and cooperation, a settlement can lead to greater mutual 
satisfaction  and  lessened  animosity  between  you  and  your  spouse.    In  most  cases,  negotiations  toward  settlement  can  be  more 
productive  and  far  less  expensive  than  trial.  If  negotiations  fail  and  you  must  try  your  case,  we  will  make  rulings  that  will 
permanently affect you and your children.  Our rulings must be made exclusively upon the limited evidence that is presented in court, 
and nothing else.  Because we are restricted in what we can and cannot do, a settlement can offer a wider range of options.  Ask the 
court administrator for information about mediation programs.  A mediator is a neutral person trained to help you and your spouse 
reach a settlement. 

   Every dissolution is different.  Your results may be very different from your neighbor’s, friend’s, or relative’s.  You cannot rely 
upon  what  happened  in  their  cases  and  assume  that  your  results  will  be  the  same.    Cases  that  seem  similar  may,  in  fact,  be  very 
different and  will be treated differently under the law.  For this reason, you should look to  your lawyer  for  your legal advice and 
information.  Your friends and relatives usually do not have a grasp of the law and your case, and accepting their advice may hinder 
you in the long run.

   In the marriage dissolution, the income, assets and debts accumulated during the marriage must be allocated between you and your 
spouse.  The law is that you and your spouse are financial partners during the marriage and are presumed entitled to share in both the 
assets and income the partnership made.  You must make a full disclosure of your finances.  For most people, life-styles change after 
a divorce.  Since divorces do not create property or income, we must divide the marital resources between two separate households.  
It  costs  more  to  run  two  households  than  one.    If  you  or  your  spouse  have  not  been  employed  during  the  marriage,  it  may  be

necessary to seek employment.  In considering a settlement, you should consider whether you can afford the attorney’s fees to fully 
litigate  your  case.    Fees  and  costs  in  contested  cases  can  be  quite  high.    Usually,  a  settlement  prior  to  trial  reduces  the  expenses 
considerably, an important consideration if you come to the divorce with limited resources. 

ssues 
   Dissolutions  generally  involve  four  major  issues:  child  custody  and  parenting  time,  child  support,  spousal  maintenance  and  a 
division of property and debts.  After the case is concluded, we may later be asked to modify custody, parenting time or support.  You 
need to understand each of these aspects of your case. 

hild Custody 

   Both parents and their children may be required to attend an education program before the dissolution is granted.  The program will 
help you understand what affect divorce has on children, and how you can make the transition less traumatic for them.  Remember, 
your marriage may be ending, but you will always be  parents to your children.  Most parents will share parental responsibility for 
their  children  after  the  dissolution.    In  doing  so,  you  must  communicate  and  confer  with  each  other  in  making  decisions  that  will 
affect your children. 
    Usually, we will give one parent primary residential care (custody) of the children.  Unless there is a good reason to limit parenting 
time, we will grant the other parent frequent parenting time.  We decide custody solely on what is best for the children.  Often, one of 
the parties is hurt by our decision, especially if that party sees the decision in a "win/lose" light.  In truth, there can be no loser if the 
children’s welfare is protected. 
    In  virtually  all  custody  contests  we  will  direct  both  parties  to  participate  in  mediation  to  resolve  that  issue.    A  mediator  is  an 
unbiased  third  party  who  can  often  assist  the  parties  in  reaching  agreement  upon  what  is  best  for  the  children.  An  agreement  on 
custody will certainly make your case easier and help your children immeasurably in dealing with your divorce.  If domestic violence 
has occurred, the Court cannot require you to participate in mediation. 
     If an agreement regarding parenting time is not reached, a custody study may be ordered, with costs assessed to the parties. 
     In cases where child abuse or neglect is alleged by a parent during a dissolution, we must appoint a guardian ad litem (GAL) to 
represent the best interests of the child with respect to custody, support and parenting time.  A  GAL  may also be appointed if the 
court believes the conflict in the case presents a potential hazard to the child’s welfare or the child’s interests are not being adequately 
served.  The GAL is to conduct an independent investigation into what would be best for the child and to advocate for the child’s best 
interests.    GAL’s  must  maintain  confidentiality  of  information,  monitor  the  child’s  best  interest  throughout  the  proceedings,  and 
present written reports to the court on the child’s best interests.  If a GAL is appointed, you are likely to be assessed a fee for their 
services. 

    Aside from continuing to love  your children and seeing them  often,  you have no higher obligation as a parent than to continue 
supporting your children after the divorce.  Child support is more important than any other debt or financial obligation.  Both parents 
are required to support the children but the non-residential parent will be directed to pay his/her portion of the support to the other.  
This does not mean that the residential parent is not contributing to the support. 
    Minnesota  has  adopted  guidelines  for  child  support  that  we  are  required  to  follow.    Your  friends  and  relatives  may  have  been 
involved in divorces years ago or in other states and receive or pay higher or lower support than our guidelines provide.  The child 
support in your case will be based upon the incomes of both parents and the needs of your children under the guidelines established 
by the State.  It is possible to deviate from the guideline amount but you must prove that the deviation is legally justifiable. 

pousal Maintenance 

   We find it necessary to award spousal support  in some cases.  As with child support, we will consider two factors: one party’s need 
and  the  other’s  ability  to  pay.    Both  of  these  factors  must  be  proven  in  court  by  the  requesting  spouse.    Spousal  support  may  be 
awarded to either spouse and, depending on the length of the marriage and other factors, the spousal support may be permanent or for 
only a short duration. 

hild Support 

  C

  Under Minnesota law, we must try to make a “fair and equitable distribution” of marital property and debts.  “Equitable” does not 
always mean “equal.”   Many factors, including child support, custody and spousal support awards, can cause us to make an unequal 
(but still equitable) division of property.  We will not generally divide the property and debts that arise outside the marriage. 

roperty Division 

ttorney’s Fees 

  We can order one party to pay some or all of the other’s attorney’s fees.  We do this to assure that both parties have equal access to 
competent counsel.  We do not award fees in every case, we must first find that one party has a greater ability to pay than the other 
does. 
    You cannot ever be certain that we  will award fees.  For this reason, and because of the great drain that fees can be on marital 
assets, everyone (parties and attorneys alike) should make every effort to resolve a dissolution case as economically as possible. 

o Not Write Letters To Your Judge 

We  are  not  permitted  to  read  letters  containing  facts  or  allegations  about  your  case,  nor  can  we  speak  with  you  or  your 
friends/relatives  on  the  telephone.    If  there  is  something  we  need  to  know,  inform  us  by  scheduling  a  hearing  and  filing  motion 
papers. 

ave Reasonable Expectations 

    You will certainly be disappointed if you expect to “win” on every issue.  Rarely is either party happy about every ruling in a case.  
Even  the  best  rulings  leave  both  parties  somewhat  dissatisfied.    Encourage  your  attorney  to  give  you  a  realistic  projection  of  the 
outcome of your case.

eep Communication Open With Your Spouse/ Former Spouse 

  As long as children are involved, you and your former spouse will have to work together.  Your children will suffer to the degree 
that you and your former spouse cannot communicate or cooperate. 

et Professional Help To Deal With Your Emotions 

Please do your best to keep emotions out of the case.  Your feelings of anger, pain, and betrayal are understandable, but expressing 
them inappropriately in court may interfere with your ability to provide us with the information we need.  If you have trouble with the 
hostility,  anger,  or  depression  that  often  occurs  in  divorces,  don’t  hesitate  to  get  counseling  to  help  you  through  it.        A  good 
counselor can help you, and your children, get through this difficult time and avoid having the anger become counterproductive. 

ncourage and Support Parenting Time (Visitation) 

  If you are the custodial parent and the court has ordered parenting time between your children and your ex-spouse, you have a duty 
to encourage parenting time.  You must do more than just stay out of the way or leave the choice to the children.  Encourage your 
children to see your former spouse frequently and to enjoy the contact.  Never use support or parenting time as a lever or bargaining 
chip in dealing with the other parent.  However, if mental health, chemical dependency, abuse or other issues arise and you think your 
children are not safe with your ex-spouse, seek professional advice on what to do. 

ive Your Children a Chance 

   The way you and your spouse handle your divorce will have an enormous impact upon your children.  If you argue and fight, their 
problems and pain will be magnified.  By acting reasonably, you can help your children through one of the most difficult events of 
their lives.
