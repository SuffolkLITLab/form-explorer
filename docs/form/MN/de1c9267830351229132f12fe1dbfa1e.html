Resources and General Information about Forfeiture 

orfeiture is the process that a state agency uses to seize (take) property from an owner after someone is 
arrested, charged, or convicted of a specific crime. Forfeiture of property is a civil issue that is separate from 
any criminal charges that may have been filed against someone. You can read more about forfeitures in the 
“Forfeiture and Impoundment” Help Topic online at http://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Forfeiture-and-
Impoundment.aspx.  

ou will find information about asking the court to return a vehicle that was taken after an alcohol-related 
offense in Minn. Stat. § 169A.63, subd. 8(e) (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/169A.63).  If the 
value of the vehicle is $15,000 or less, you may file an action in conciliation court for recovery of the 
seized vehicle.   

•  Form FOR102 is the form used when filing a forfeiture action in conciliation court for alcohol-

related offenses. 

•  Form FOR302 is used for controlled substances cases. 

The Court has forms and instructions, for some types of cases, as a general guide to the court process. 
These instructions explain the steps in more detail and answer common questions but are not a full 
guide to the law. Court employees may be able to give general information on court rules and 
procedures, but they cannot give legal advice. For a list of legal resources visit www.MNCourts.gov/Find-
a-Lawyer.aspx.

Innocent Owner 

If you are the owner of a motor vehicle that was seized while someone else was driving, you may be able 
to ask the prosecuting authority to return the vehicle to you without having to file paperwork with the 
court.   

Any person (other than the defendant driver alleged to have committed the offense) may bring an 
innocent owner claim by notifying the prosecuting authority in writing no later than 60 days after being 
served with the Notice of Seizure and Intent to Forfeit.  See Minn. Stat. § 169A.63, subd. 7a(a) 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/169A.63).   

You can use the Innocent Owner Notice to Prosecuting Authority form (FOR701) to notify the prosecuting 
authority of an innocent owner claim. FOR701 is available online at 
https://www.mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=20&f=894. Your written notice to the prosecuting authority 
does not get filed with the court.   

If you do not know whether you are an innocent owner or if you have questions about bringing an 
innocent owner claim, you may want to get legal advice. 

Do you have all the information you need to fill out the forms? 

The Demand for Judicial Determination of Forfeiture form (FOR102) asks for the following information: 

•  The name of the county in which the vehicle was seized.

o  Model 
o  Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) 
o  License plate number 
o  State where the vehicle is registered 
o  Value of the vehicle. 
•  Date or approximate date of seizure. 
•  Your interest in the vehicle (for example: owner).

Serve the Prosecuting Authority  

The prosecuting authority must receive a complete copy of the Demand you filled out in Step 1.  This is 
called “service of process.” Service may be done in one of three ways:  

•  Service by Certified Mail;  
•  Third Party Personal Service; or  
•  Service by Regular First-Class Mail with 
Waiver/Acknowledgment of Service. 

Deadline for Service – You must 
serve the prosecuting authority 
within 60 days of the date you 
received the Notice of Seizure 
and Intent to Forfeit form. 

You or someone else who is at least 18 years old must mail a copy of the paperwork to the prosecuting 
authority by certified mail.  

ervice by Certified Mail 

ersonal Service 

Service must be hand-delivered (personal service) and you cannot be the one to serve.  You have to 
arrange for someone who is at least 18 years old and who has no interest in the case to hand-deliver the 
forms for you.  You can also hire a professional process server. 

ervice by Regular First-Class Mail with Waiver/Acknowledgment of Service 

The Rules of Civil Procedure also allow for service by regular first-class mail.  If you decide to serve by first-
class mail, you must include the following additional forms: 

•  Notice of Lawsuit and Request for Waiver of Service of Summons (CIV022A) form; 
•  Two (2) copies of the Waiver of Service of Summons (CIV022B) form; and 
•  A prepaid way (such as a self-addressed, stamped envelope) for the other party to return a signed 

copy of the Waiver of Service of Summons (CIV022B) to you. 

The deadline for service applies even if you choose to serve by regular-first class mail.  If the other 
party does not sign and return the Waiver of Service to you, the papers may not be considered 
served.  If that happens, you must serve them by certified mail or personal service within 60 days of the 
date of when you received the Notice of Seizure and Intent to Forfeit form.  If you have any questions, 
please talk to a lawyer.

ourt administration will prepare a Summons that contains information about the hearing date, time, and 

location. Once you receive the Summons from court administration, you must complete service of the 
Summons on the prosecuting authority and file proof of service with the court. Follow the same steps 
about Service in Step 2 above.  Contact court administration for more information.  

If you miss the court date, the judicial officer could order the forfeiture of your vehicle.  For more 
information about going to court, visit the “Going to Court” Help Topic at https://mncourts.gov/Help-
Topics/Going-to-Court.aspx.  

If you are not sure what to say in court, it is a good idea to talk to an attorney before the hearing.
