2.  List the date and time when the hearing is scheduled (don’t forget to say whether it is a.m. 

1.  Fill  in your full legal name. 

or p.m.). 

3.  Check the box showing what you are asking for. 

4.  Check the box stating whether your request is for just the hearing listed at #2, or for all 

future court appearances in the case. 

5.  When deciding whether to allow a person to appear remotely for an in-person hearing or 

appear in person for a remote hearing, a judicial officer considers many factors to decide if 
there are exceptional circumstances.  

Explain, in detail, why you are asking to change your hearing. Be as specific as possible and 
include any of the factors below that you think may apply to your situation. If you need more 
space, add more paper.   

Asking to Appear Remotely  for an In-Person Hearing 

Factors may include, but are not limited to, the following: 

•  All parties, and the court, agree that the hearing should be held remotely (this factor, 

by itself, is not an exceptional circumstance); 

•  Holding the hearing in person would cause a hearing participant  to reasonably fear 

for their safety; 

•  The cost and time savings to any party; 

•  A hearing participant  would need to travel unreasonably far to the hearing location, 

or it would be unduly burdensome for a hearing participant to arrange transportation 
to the hearing; 

•  A hearing participant  is in custody or in residential treatment and cannot physically 

travel to the hearing but can participate  remotely; 

• 

Inclement weather conditions make travel to an in-person hearing a risk to the 
personal safety of any hearing participants; 

•  Unavoidable scheduling conflicts of the parties preventing the matter from moving 

forward in a more timely way; 

•  The importance and complexity of the proceedings; 

•  For an evidentiary proceeding or trial,  whether appearing remotely would allow for 

effective examination of the witness and maintain  the importance of the proceedings 
for the witness to testify truthfully;  

•  Any surprise or prejudice (harm) that would result if a party appears as instructed; and

Page 3 of 5 

•  Such other factors, based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case, as the 

court determines to be relevant. 

Asking to Appear In Person at a Remote  Hearing 

Factors may include, but are not limited to the following: 

•  All parties, and the court, agree that the hearing should be held in person (this factor, 

by itself, is not an exceptional circumstance); 

•  A party does not have access to technology to participate remotely, and the party 

cannot reasonably be expected to gain access to such technology before the hearing; 

•  The importance and complexity of the proceeding; 

•  There are too many participants in the hearing to easily keep track of them all on a 

computer screen; 

•  For an evidentiary proceeding, whether appearing remotely would allow for effective 
examination of the witness and maintain the importance of the proceedings for the 
witness to testify truthfully;  

•  Any surprise or prejudice (harm) that would result if a party appears as instructed; and 

•  Such other factors, based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case, as the 

court determines to be relevant. 

6.  This question is about whether the other party knows about your request.  Check the first 

box if you have discussed your request with the other party.  Then check one of the next set 
of boxes to describe the other party’s response. 

Check the second box if you have not discussed (or tried to discuss) your request with the 
other party.  Then explain why you have not discussed it.

whether to grant your request.  If your hearing date is coming up, and you have not heard from the 
court, call Court Administration for instructions on appearing for the hearing.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
