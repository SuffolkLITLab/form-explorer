and procedures, but they cannot give legal advice.

General Information About the Generic Civil Motion Packet 

he information contained in this document is not intended as legal advice but as a general guide to 
you to explain the legal process.  If you do not understand any of these procedures, talk to an attorney.  
Court staff cannot give legal advice. 

 generic motion is a way to ask the court to do something within a civil case that is already open.  In very 
simple terms, the motion is where you state what you want the court to order.  Along with every motion, you 
need an affidavit.  The affidavit is where you state why the court should give you what you have asked for. 

ou may be able to use this packet IF: 

•  A civil case has already started and you have a case number; 
•  You want to ask the court to do something within the case; 
•  The court does not publish a specific form for the request you want to make; and 
•  You want to have a hearing on your request.   

MPORTANT: It is strongly recommended that you get legal advice. If you do not know what you should 
write in your motion, want the motion reviewed by an attorney, or do not already have a civil case open, you 
should get legal advice.  

Fill Out Notice of Motion and Motion (CIV602)

• 

I you cannot view your case online, you may need to go to the courthouse in the county where 
your case is located to view your court file. 

. At the top of the page, write in the following information: 

•  The county where the case is located; 
•  The judicial district number (each county is located in one of ten judicial districts);

numbers.  For example, 15-CV-19-0001); and 

•  The case type.

penalty of perjury.  This is like being under oath.  It means you should not write anything that you know

. Write down the information you want the court to know.  This section is your “statement of facts.”  If 
you run out of room, then please add more paper.  Do not write on the back of the page or in the margins. 

f you want to include an attachment that supports a statement you make, then it is good practice to label 
your attachment something like “Attachment A” or “Exhibit 1.”  Then, next to the statement in your 
Affidavit that talks about the attachment, you can write something like “See Attachment A” or “See 
Exhibit 1.”  For example: “It cost $800 to fix my car.  See Exhibit 1.”  And Exhibit 1 would be the bill 
from the car repair shop.

and print your personal contact information below your signature.  

Step 3 

Contact Court Administration About a Hearing Date 

n some districts, you need to schedule the hearing before you serve and file your motion.  In other 
districts, you get a hearing date after you have filed.  It is important that you check with your local Court 
Administration to see how to schedule a hearing for your motion. If you do not schedule a hearing, the 
court will not do anything with your motion.

Motion and Motion (CIV602).  Fill in the information in the boxes (hearing date, time, location, 
and name of judicial officer).

Motion (CIV602).  Note: it is okay to fill in the name and address of the courthouse. 

•  Later on, once you do have a hearing date, you will need to fill out the Notice of Hearing form

Step 4 

Make Copies 

  
You will need to make one copy of the Notice of Motion and the Affidavit in Support of Motion (plus any 
attachments) for each party, including yourself.  Be sure to bring your copy with you to court when you 
go to the hearing. 
 

Step 5 

Serve Notice on the Other Party 

Overview 
The other party must receive notice of the hearing and complete copies of all documents 
you have prepared for the hearing. This is called "service of process." The papers can be 
served personally (handed to the other party), or by mail. The other party must receive 
the papers at least 21 days before the hearing. If papers are served by mail, Court Rules 
require adding three days, so that papers must be postmarked at least 24 days before the 
hearing.   

If the other party is 
represented by an 
attorney, serve the other 
party’s attorney instead 
of the party directly. 

apers CANNOT be served on legal holidays as defined in Minn. Stat. 645.44 

(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44#stat.645.44.5).  

Who Can Serve  
The forms you have prepared can be served by any of the following: 

•  The sheriff; 
•  Another adult; or 
•  You.

Personal Service 
At least 21 days before the hearing date, the server hands to the other party one copy of the completed 
Notice of Motion and Motion, and one copy of your Affidavit in Support of Motion, including one copy of 
any and all attachments. Example: If the hearing date is January 30, the papers must be served on or 
before January 9. If January 9 is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, keep counting backwards to the 
next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday to determine the service deadline.  

Service by Mail 
The server places one copy of the completed Notice of Motion and Motion form, one copy of your 
Affidavit in Support of Motion, and one copy of any and all attachments in an envelope.  

The server must mail the envelope containing the forms to the other party by first class U.S. mail at least 
24 days before the hearing date.  Example: If the hearing is January 30, the papers must be postmarked 
no later than January 6. If January 6 is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, keep counting backwards to 
the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday to determine the service deadline. 

Warning: If your forms are not personally served on the other party at least 21 days before the 
hearing OR mailed to the other party at least 24 days before the hearing date, your Motion may 
NOT be heard by the court. 

If there is more than one plaintiff or more than one defendant, please note that ALL of the other 
parties must be served.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
