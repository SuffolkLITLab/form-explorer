What Is an Order for Protection? 

An Order for Protection (OFP) is an order signed by a judicial officer (judicial officer or referee) 
that may help protect you from domestic abuse.  An OFP orders the abuser not to contact, harm, 
or threaten to harm you, your children, or other people the judicial officer agrees to list on the 
OFP.  You can also ask the judicial officer to order the abuser to do certain things, or stop doing 
certain things, to help keep you safe. 

Who May Apply for an OFP? 

The person applying for the OFP is called the petitioner.  The person you are seeking protection 
from is called the respondent. 

The petitioner may apply for an OFP if: 

•  Domestic abuse has occurred; AND 
•  The petitioner and respondent are family or household 

Please see the legal definitions below 
to see if domestic abuse has 
happened in your situation, and to see 
if the petitioner and respondent are 
family or household members. 

members. 

On Behalf Of 

In certain situations, a petitioner may apply on behalf of another person.  For example, a petitioner 
may apply on behalf of a minor child if there has been domestic abuse of the child by the 
respondent, and the petitioner is: 

•  A family or household member of the child; or 
•  The child’s parent or guardian; or 
•  A reputable adult age 25 or older, if the judicial officer finds that it is in the best interest of 

the minor.

             Page 2 of 18 

Additionally, a legal guardian of an adult may apply on behalf of the adult ward. A guardianship 
order from a court must be in place. 

A person aged 16 or 17 may apply for an OFP on their own if there has been domestic abuse, and 
the respondent is someone the petitioner: 

• 
Is married to; 
•  Was married to; or 
•  Has a child with, if the judicial officer finds that the petitioner has sufficient maturity 

and judgment, and that it is in the best interest of the minor. 

here May the Petitioner Apply for an OFP? 

A petitioner may apply for an OFP: 

• 
• 
• 
• 

• 

In the county where the petitioner lives; 
In the county where the respondent lives;  
In the county where the domestic abuse happened; 
In any county where there is a pending or completed family court 
case involving the petitioner and the respondent, or their minor 
children, such as a divorce or child custody case; or 
In the court with jurisdiction over divorce actions. 

ow Much Does it Cost to Apply for or to Serve the OFP? 

There is no cost to apply for an OFP.  If the judicial officer grants the OFP, then the OFP must be 
personally delivered to (served on) the respondent.  There is no cost to the petitioner for serving 
the respondent and no cost for the respondent to request a hearing.

between family or household members, regardless of whether the conduct has ever been reported 
to the police: 

a.  Actual physical harm, bodily injury, assault (such as hitting, kicking, slapping, 

pushing, stabbing), or infliction of fear of imminent physical harm, bodily injury, 
or assault (such as verbal threats, threatening gestures); or

b.  Terroristic threats (such as a threat to kill, break bones, or threatening someone 

with a knife or a gun); or 

c.  Criminal sexual conduct with an adult (such as forced sex or forced contact with 

intimate body parts, even if the parties are married), or any form of sexual contact 
with a child; or

together; 

g.  Persons who have an unborn child together; or 

h.  Persons involved in or who were involved in a significant romantic or sexual 

relationship (regardless of sexual orientation). 

ccording to Minnesota law, to qualify for an OFP, the situation must include “domestic abuse” 
AND “family or household members” as defined above.  If your application DOES NOT involve 
"domestic abuse" AND "family or household members" you may still be able to apply for a 
Harassment Restraining Order (HRO).  Please ask at the court administrator's office, or look online 
at http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=22&p=77, for HRO information, forms, and instructions. 

If your situation DOES involve "domestic abuse" AND "family or household members," you 
may complete the Petition for Order for Protection (OFP102) according to the following 
instructions. 
 

Step 1

Fill Out Petition for Order for Protection (OFP102) 

Every question on the Petition (OFP102) and in the Guide & File “Protective Orders” interview 
is important.  The judicial officer uses your information to decide whether to issue an OFP. If 
you choose not to provide all of the information, the judicial officer may not be able to grant 
your request and issue an OFP. 

Whatever information you give to the court will become public information as soon as the court 
receives notice that the Respondent has been served with the OFP or Order for Hearing.  You 
may, however, file a Confidential Address/Phone Request form (OFP107) to ask the court to 
keep your address and/or telephone number confidential in this case.

birth.  

 

A Note about Gender: 

The court recognizes that binary gender options of male and female do not fully represent the 
gender identities of all individuals. 

The court has to pass information electronically to the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) in 
order for law enforcement to be able to see the OFPs in a statewide system.  The court is limited to 
the gender options allowed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) – male and female. 

If you do not choose male or female, OFP data cannot be passed to the BCA.  That means law 
enforcement will not have access to the electronic version of any OFP.

RESPONDENT 

6.  This is the section where you give the court information about the RESPONDENT (the 

person you want protection from). 

Note: If the respondent is a minor (under the age of 18), then 
you should also list: 

•  The name of respondent’s parent or guardian; and 
•  The parent or guardian’s address.  

If the respondent is a minor, the 
respondent and the 
respondent’s parent or guardian 
must be served with the OFP. 

7

7.  In #7, you are telling the court how each person who needs protection (look at the boxes you 
checked at #3) knows the respondent.  Check all of the boxes that apply to your situation. 

 

Questions #8 through #10 are about OTHER COURT CASES. 

8.  If there is a current OFP (one that is in effect right now), between anyone listed at #3 and 
the respondent, check Yes, and answer the questions about the OFP.  If there is more than 
one current OFP, add another sheet of paper. 

9.  If there have ever been any OFPs between respondent and anyone listed at #3, check Yes, 
and answer the questions about the past OFPs.  There is room for you to list three past 
OFPs; if there were more than three, add another sheet of paper. 

10. This section is asking whether there are or have been any other cases that involved 

respondent and anyone listed at #3.  Examples of other court cases are: 

•  Family court cases (like divorce/dissolution or custody); 

•  Domestic abuse criminal cases; and 

•  Harassment restraining order (HRO) cases. 

There is room to describe five cases.  If you need more space, add another sheet of paper. If 
you are not sure of the details, contact court administration for help.

Question #11 is about the DOMESTIC ABUSE.  It has many sections to help you describe what 
happened: 

•  Date; 
•  Who was present; 
•  Respondent’s conduct (threatening or harmful conduct that caused you, and anyone else 

listed at #3, to be afraid); 

•  Weapons (if any); 
• 
Injuries (if any); 
•  911 or emergency call (if one was made); and 
•  Law enforcement involvement. 

11

 

11. In this long section, describe the domestic abuse.  If there are several incidents, start with 
the most recent incident.  Then describe the other incidents on the Description of Abuse 
Attachment. 

12. In addition to what you listed at #11, if respondent has a history of abuse, you may explain 

that history at #12. 

13. Check the box to let the court know whether you believe the domestic abuse will continue 

and whether you (or others named at #3) are in immediate danger; then explain your answer. 

14. Check the box to let the court know whether the respondent works or goes to school at the 

same place as you (or others named at #3).  If the answer is Yes, explain. 

The next section of the form is where you let the court know what kind of “relief” you want.  You 
may ask the court to order the respondent to do certain things, or to stop doing certain things, to help 
keep you safe.  This is called “requesting relief.” 

The court can order the things listed in #15 without a hearing through an Ex Parte order. 

   

 

However, there must be a hearing if you ask for anything listed in #16 through #22.

Read this section carefully to see what may happen when the judicial officer looks at your 
Petition for OFP. 

It is possible that the judicial officer will not grant the OFP.  If this happens, you have the right 
to ask for a hearing so that you can explain to the judicial officer why the OFP should be granted.  
The respondent has the right to be present at the hearing.  Some petitioners do not want to do this 
because they do not want the respondent to find out they applied for an OFP.  If you do not 
want a hearing at all, let the court know by checking the box in this section.  

IMPORTANT NOTE: 

The judicial officer may decide that a hearing is required even though you may not want a hearing.  
The respondent also has the right to ask for a hearing, so it is possible there will be a hearing 
scheduled within the next few weeks, even if you do not ask for a hearing, and even if you 
check the box saying you do not want a hearing. 

If the respondent asks for a hearing, the court will mail a notice of the hearing date to you at 
least 5 days before the hearing.  The court must have your current address at all times so that 
you will get all required notices. 

15

 

15. There are eleven (11) things you can ask for in #15, each marked with a letter (a through k).   

a.  Check this box if you want an Ex Parte Order for Protection, which means you 

want the judicial officer to grant an OFP right away, without a hearing.

OFP101   State   ENG    

Rev 1/21                    www.mncourts.gov/forms

b.  Check here if you want the judicial officer to order the respondent not to cause 
anyone listed at #3 above any physical harm, or any fear of physical harm. 

c.  Check “c” if you want the 

court to order the respondent 
not to have contact with 
anyone listed at #3. 

• 

If you need to have some limited contact with the respondent, describe what 
kind of contact is okay.  For example, some petitioners may feel it is okay 
for the respondent to contact them by email, but only to arrange parenting 
time exchanges. 

• 

If you need more space for your answer, add paper. 

d.  This section asks whether or not the respondent 

may come to your home or other places where you 
or anyone listed at #3 live or spend time.  If there 
are exceptions, please describe.  For example, if it 
is okay for the respondent to park at the curb in 
front of your home to exchange the children for 
parenting time, you can write that in the “except as follows” section. 

For “d” - you can also ask the court 
to order the respondent to stay away 
from a reasonable area surrounding 
the home (you should describe what 
you mean). 

If you do not want the respondent to know your address, or if you do not 
want your address to be part of the public file, DO NOT WRITE YOUR 
ADDRESS HERE.  Instead, check the box showing you want your address 
kept confidential, and use Confidential Address/Phone Request (OFP107) to 
give your address to the court. 

e.  Check this box if there is a work address that you want the respondent to stay 
away from, and list the employer’s name and address, and any exceptions. 

f.  Check this box if there is an additional address that you want the respondent to 

stay away from, such as a school or daycare.  List the address and any exceptions. 

g.  Check “g” if you want the court to order the respondent to keep the insurance in 

place, without any making any changes in coverage or beneficiaries. 

h.  Check this box if you have a specific request about who should keep and take care 
of any pets or companion animals.  Give the animal’s name, type, and location. 

i. 

If either party, or a minor child who lives in or is a household member of either 
party, has a pet or companion animal, then check “i” to ask the court to order the 
respondent not to abuse or injure the animal as a way of threatening the safety of 
the other party or minor child. 

j.  Check this box if you need law enforcement to help you in some way, and 

describe what you want the court to order law enforcement to do (for example,

OFP101   State   ENG

provide protection as you collect your belongings from a home you share with the 
respondent). 

k.  If there is something else you want the court to order, and it is not covered already 
in #15 through #23, you can list it here.  The judicial officer will decide whether 
anything you ask for in “k” will require a hearing. 

 

If you do not want a hearing, you should not check Yes to anything in #16 through #22. 

16. Temporary custody and parenting time.  You may be able to ask the court to make 

temporary orders about custody, parenting time, or support for a minor child that you and 
respondent have together.  However, paternity must be established by marriage, 
Recognition of Parentage, or a court order regarding paternity.  There may also be an order 
regarding third party custody involving the children and an adult other than the parents. 

17. Financial Support.  Answer these questions if you want the respondent to provide 

 

uestions #16 through #22 deal with the following types of requests: 

  Q

temporary support for: 

•  Your minor joint child; 

•  Your own living expenses (but only if the respondent is your spouse); and/or 

•  Medical support or health insurance. 

In order to help the judicial officer decide how much financial support you need, 
please: 

o  Answer the questions about your income and expenses; 
o  Answer the questions about the respondent (if you know the answers); 
o  Answer the questions about health insurance and child care; and 
o  Include any other information about why you need the respondent to provide 

you with temporary financial support. 

18. Property.  Use this section to ask the court to give you the temporary use and possession 

of personal property, or to ask the court to order the respondent not to get rid of or 
destroy property.  Please list what the property is and where it is located. 

19. Restitution. If you want the court to order the respondent to pay you for expenses 

resulting from the domestic abuse, answer the questions in this section.  If you ask for

restitution, be prepared to bring receipts or other proof of the expenses to the court 
hearing. 

20. Counseling, treatment, or services. Use this section if you want the court to order the 
respondent to go to counseling or treatment, or to get a mental health evaluation. 

21. Firearms and Ammunition.  Check this box if you want the judge to order the respondent 
not to possess firearms or ammunition. Under federal law, it is a crime for the respondent to 
possess or transport firearms or ammunition while there is a “qualifying protective order” in 
place. In order for an OFP to be a “qualifying protective order,” a hearing must be held and 
other requirements must also be met. If you have concerns about this question, or how your 
safety may be affected by the respondent’s access to firearms or ammunition, please speak 
with an advocate or an attorney. To be connected with an advocate, you may call the Day 
One MN Domestic Violence Crisis Line at 1.866.223.1111. 

22. Extended time frame for OFP.  If the respondent has violated an OFP two or more times, 
or if anyone listed at #3 has had two or more OFPs against the respondent, you can ask that 
this OFP be in effect for up to 50 years. 

23. You do not have to check anything for #23.

Step 6 

After You File… 

Once all of your forms are filed, a judicial officer will make a decision about your requests 
and issue an order. When the order is ready, you will get a copy of the order.  

Read your order carefully. Did the judicial officer:  

•  Grant your request for the temporary Order for Protection (Ex Parte Order)?  
•  Deny your request for an Ex Parte Order?  
•  Dismiss the case (not grant your request)?  
•  Schedule a hearing (with or without an Ex Parte Order)?  

If the judicial officer GRANTS the Ex Parte Order, it will be effective immediately. The judicial 
officer may have also ordered a hearing. If the judicial officer did not order a hearing, the 
Respondent has the right to request a hearing within 5 days of service of the petition and Ex 
Parte Order.  

If a hearing is ordered, the Order for Protection (OFP) will be in effect until the date of the 
hearing. Depending on what happens at the hearing, the OFP may or may not continue.  

If the judicial officer DENIES the request for the Ex Parte Order and you have asked for a 
hearing, then court administration will schedule a hearing. The court will send a notice of the 
date and time of the hearing to you and to Respondent. There will be no OFP in effect before the 
hearing. You must attend the hearing. If you do not attend the hearing, the OFP may be 
dismissed.  

If the judicial officer DISMISSES the case, this means that the judicial officer does not believe 
that what you described in your petition fits the definition of domestic abuse, or may not have 
enough information to make a decision. You can talk to a domestic abuse advocate or get legal 
advice to see what your options might be.  

A copy of any order (except dismissed OFPs) must be served on the Respondent. If your 
petition gave an address in Minnesota where the Respondent can be served, court administration 
will send the documents to the Sheriff who will try to personally serve the Respondent. There is 
no fee for this service.  

If Respondent is under 18 years old and you gave the court the name and address of the parent or 
legal guardian, the court will mail a copy of the order to Respondent’s parent or legal guardian.

Service is complete when law enforcement personally delivers a copy of the papers to 
Respondent. It may take them several tries to serve the Respondent, which could take a week or 
more.  

If law enforcement is not able to serve Respondent within 14 days, the Ex Parte Order 
will expire UNLESS, before the end of the 14 days, you file the Affidavit in Support of 
Request for Alternative Service or Publication form (OFP501).  This form is available on 

the Minnesota Judicial Branch website at 
http://www.mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=17&f=324. 

NOTE: An OFP issued after a hearing will not expire if the Respondent cannot be served. 

If a hearing is scheduled, you must attend the hearing. If you do not attend the hearing, the OFP 
may be dismissed.  

If you are granted an Ex Parte Order and Respondent asks for a hearing, the Ex Parte Order 
could be dismissed if you do not attend the hearing and offer evidence about the domestic 
abuse. 

New address?  If an address changes, you must immediately notify: 

•  Court administration; and 

•  Local law enforcement agency where you now live. 

You can use the Notice of Change of Address form (OFP801), 
which is available online at http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=17&f=329.  

If the new address is confidential, use the Confidential Address/Phone Request form (OFP107) 
instead (http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=17&f=318). NOTE: The Cover Sheet for Non-
Public Documents Form 11.2 (CON112) must be used when filing this document in paper form.
