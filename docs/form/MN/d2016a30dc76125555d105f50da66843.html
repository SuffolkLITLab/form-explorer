GENERAL INFORMATION 

he Response to Motion for Review / Counter Motion form (CSX902) is used by individuals who 

are objecting to another party’s request to make changes to a recently decided child support 
order.  The purpose of filing a response to a Motion for Review is to explain your objections to 
the court.  You are not required to file a response if you agree with the motion.  If you wish to 
raise other issues that were not addressed in the Motion for Review, use the Response to Motion 
for Review / Counter Motion form (CSX902) and mark the box “Counter Motion.”  The same 
responsive motion form is used if you are responding to a Counter Motion.   You may not use 
the responsive forms to bring other requests or questions before the court. 

ourt forms are used by individuals representing themselves or for attorneys.  They are not a 
substitute for use of an attorney.  Using these forms will not guarantee that the court will grant 
your request.  When filling out the forms, be as accurate and as detailed as possible.  The court 
needs to clearly understand what you believe to be mistakes or errors before the court can make 
any corrections or changes to the order.  
 

Helpful materials may be found at your public county law library.  For a directory, see   
http://mn.gov/law-library/research-links/county-law-libraries.jsp .  For more information, contact 
your court administrator or call the Minnesota State Law Library at 651-297-7651.

The information to fill in the boxes and blanks at the top of the form can be found at the top of 
your current child support order, including: 
•  The county where your case is located and where the current order was issued (which may be 

 

  F

•  The number of the judicial district. 
•  The court file number. 
•  The name of the Petitioner. 
•

responding to a Counter Motion.  Check either the “Response to Motion for Review” box, the 
“Counter Motion” box, or the “Response to Counter Motion” box.  A response to a Motion for 
Review should include your objections to the Motion for Review or Counter Motion.  A Counter

your case is located.

issued the order or a district court judge.  Check off the appropriate box. 

Request 2:    List all the parts of the order you want reviewed, the reasons why the review is 

requested, and describe the specific changes requested.  You may request as many 
changes as you wish, but it will be up to the court to decide what changes (if any) 
will actually be ordered. 

Request 3:   

Include any other changes you would like the court to make. 

Request 4:   

If you would like to submit new or additional evidence that supports the changes,

did not submit it earlier.   Do Not Submit the Additional Evidence at this Time.

documents must be served on the attorney instead of the party.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
