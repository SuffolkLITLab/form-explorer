Guide & File 

The court offers an online interview-based tool called Guide & File that can help you fill out the

Topics/Guide-and-File.aspx.  

General Information about Conciliation Court 

What is Conciliation Court? 

Minn. Stat. § 491A.01  (revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/491A.01) created Conciliation  Court – also 
called Small Claims  Court.  This court allows people to bring their legal claims  to court without 
expensive costs or complicated legal procedures.  

Do you have a claim to file in Conciliation Court? 

You can file a claim  in Conciliation  Court for an amount up to $15,000,  or $4,000  if the claim  involves 
a consumer credit transaction.  This is the limit  set by law.  You cannot file a claim involving title to 
real estate, libel, slander, class actions, or medical malpractice  in Conciliation  Court. 

Conciliation  Court will not accept a claim that goes over the dollar  limits.  If you reduce your claim  to 
the limit of Conciliation  Court, you cannot claim  more later.  Getting a judgment in Conciliation 
Court may prevent you from bringing any other claims  based on the same event. 

Getting a judgment in Conciliation  Court does not guarantee payment.  As you try to collect the 
judgment, you will have out-of-pocket expenses for filing fees, transcription  costs, and other costs 
of collecting  a judgment. 

NOTE:  Only a business or government entity may  be represented in Conciliation Court by a 

nonlawyer.  A power of attorney  does not authorize a nonlawyer to file a claim, appear, or 
in any other way “represent” a natural person in Conciliation Court. 

Do you have all the information you need to fill out the forms? 

The Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim form (CCT102)  asks for the following information: 

•  For each plaintiff: name, address, date of birth, phone number, email address (if a plaintiff is 

a business, then you will  need the business name, address, phone number and e-mail 
address); 

•  For each defendant: name, address, phone number, e-mail address, date of birth if known, 
and military  status if known (if a defendant is a business, then you will need the business 
name, address, phone number and e-mail address);  

•  Details about your claim (including amount and approximate date); 
•  The county and judicial district  number where case will be filed.

Step 1 

Fill Out Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim (CCT102) 

The Caption 

A.  List the county where you will  be filing  your Conciliation  Court case.  If you are not sure 

where you should file, please talk to an attorney.  Court staff cannot tell you where to file 
your case.   

The general rule is that you must file your Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim in the county where 
the defendant lives.  There are exceptions, though: 

•  You may sue for a bounced check in the county where the check was issued. 
•  You may make a claim  for unpaid rent of return of a security deposit in the county 

where the rental property is located. 

•  You may sue corporations  in the county where their business office or branch office is 

located. 

B.  List the Judicial  District.  Each county belongs in one of ten judicial  districts.  If you need help, 

see http://www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx.   

C.  Leave the “Court File Number” line blank.  Court Administration  will give you the court file 

number after you file your case. 

D.  The Case Type (Conciliation) is already filled in for you. 

E.  As the person or business suing (bringing the claim),  you are the Plaintiff.  List your full 

name.  If there is more than one plaintiff, then you will  be Plaintiff #1.  The next plaintiff will 
be Plaintiff #2. 

This form has room for only two plaintiffs.  If there are more than two, you will have to use 
the Additional Litigants Form (CCT702).   The Additional Litigants Form will allow you to 
include up to four plaintiffs.  If you have more than four plaintiffs, please check with Court 
Administration in the county where you will  be filing your claim. 

F.  The person or business being sued is the Defendant.  If there is more than one defendant, 
then the first one will be Defendant #1.  The second person or business being sued will  be 
Defendant #2. 

NOTE:  If you are suing a business, it is important that you have the name of the business 

correct.  On the Minnesota Secretary of State’s website 
(mblsportal.sos.state.mn.us/Business/Search), you can look up a business to see if it 
is registered with the state.  You might find the name of the person or company listed 
as the business’ “registered agent” who can receive “service of process” (that person 
or company should be served with legal papers), and the official business address.  
The address of the “registered agent” can be different from the official business 
address.

The Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim form has room for only two defendants.  If there are more 
than two, you will  have to use the Additional Litigants Form (CCT702).  The Additional 
Litigants Form will allow you to include up to four defendants total.  If you have more than 
four defendants, please check with Court Administration in the county where you will  be 
filing your claim. 

Information about the Plaintiff 
1.  List the number of plaintiffs. 

a.  List Plaintiff #1’s name and address.

second plaintiff, you can write “N/A” (not applicable). 

Information about the Defendant 

2.  List the total number of defendants you are suing. 

a.  For Defendant #1, include the following information: 

•  Defendant #1’s name; 
•  Whether this defendant is an individual  (person) or business; 
•  Defendant #1’s address; and 
• 

If this defendant is an individual: 

o  This defendant’s date of birth (if you know it); and 
o  Whether this defendant is in the military  service (if you know). 

b.  Give the same information for Defendant #2.  If there is only one defendant, you can 

write “N/A” (not applicable) in the section for Defendant #2.  

Information about the Claim 

3.  In Conciliation  Court, you can sue another person or business because they owe you money 

or because they have property that belongs to you.  Paragraph #3 is divided into two 
sections: Money and Property. 

Money 

any). 

•  Check the box under “Money” if the Defendant owes you money. 
•  Next, list the amount of money Defendant owes you.  Please see the section above 
titled “Do you have a claim  to file in Conciliation  Court” to read about Conciliation 
Court dollar  limits. 

•  On the next line, you will need to figure out the filing  fees (and allowable costs, if 

Conciliation Court filing fee: You will  need the Conciliation  Court filing  fee for the 
county you listed in the caption.  You can look online for the Minnesota Judicial 
Branch - Court Fees (mncourts.gov) (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Court-Fees.aspx), or 
you can ask Court Administration. 

Costs: Sometimes there are additional  costs.  For example, if you file electronically, 
there is a cost of $5.00  to do so, if fees are not waived.  If you are not sure if you have

costs that are allowed to be included, please talk to an attorney for legal advice 
(mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx). 

•  Add the amount Defendant owes you to the filing fee and costs to get the total 

amount of your claim. 

•  For the next two items, think about why Defendant owes you money.  What 

happened?  When did it happen? 

o  List the month and year (for example, October 2022)  that something 

happened that made Defendant owe you money. 

o  Describe what happened.  Why does Defendant owe you money?  Be brief 
and include important details (but do not list sensitive personal information 
like full bank account numbers). 

Property 

•  Check the box under “Property” if Defendant has property that belongs to you, and 

you want to ask the Court to order Defendant to return the property. 

•  List your property that Defendant has. Be as specific as possible. 
•  Next, list the value of your property.  Please see the section above titled “Do you 
have a claim  to file in Conciliation  Court” to read about Conciliation  Court dollar 
limits. 

•  On the next line, you will need to figure out the filing  fees (and allowable costs, if 

any). 

Conciliation Court filing fee: You will  need the Conciliation  Court filing  fee for the 
county you listed in the caption.  You can look online for the Minnesota Judicial 
Branch - Court Fees (mncourts.gov) (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Court-Fees.aspx), or 
you can ask Court Administration. 

Costs: Sometimes there are additional  costs.  For example, if you file electronically, 
there is a cost of $5.00  to do so, if fees are not waived.  If you are not sure if you have 
costs that are allowed to be included, please talk to an attorney for legal advice 
(mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx). 

•  Add the value of your property to the filing fee and costs.  This is the total amount of 
your claim  (the amount you are asking Defendant to pay you if Defendant does not 
return your property). 

Statement about Appearing at the Hearing 

4.  This is your statement to the Court and to the other party about appearing at the 

Conciliation  Court hearing.  If you do not attend the hearing, your case can be dismissed, and 
you may have to pay money to Defendant if a counterclaim  has been filed.

Page 5 of 8 

Step 2 
Sign the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim (CCT102) 

Signature Block 

Sign the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim form (CCT102).   Then fill in your name, address, date of birth, 
email address, and phone number under the signature line.  You will  also need to include the county 
and state you were in when you signed the form.  

When you sign the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim, you are signing under penalty of perjury.  This 
means you are saying that everything in the form is true and correct; if you know something in the 
form is not true when you sign it, you could be found guilty of the crime of perjury (see Minn. Stat.  
§ 609.48,  https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.48).  

Are you representing a business? 

If yes, then be sure to include the Power of Attorney for Conciliation Court (CCT701) to your 
Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim (CCT102). 

The Power of Attorney for Conciliation Court is a form that an officer of the business entity 
(corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, association) signs to give you authority to act on 
behalf of the business in Conciliation  Court. 

Is there more than one plaintiff? 

If yes, then you are Plaintiff #1.  The next plaintiff is Plaintiff #2, and so on.  If you have more than 
two plaintiffs (or more than two defendants), you will need to fill out CCT702,  the Additional 
Litigants Form.  If you have more than four plaintiffs or more than four defendants, please check 
with Court Administration.   

IMPORTANT!  Each plaintiff must sign the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim. 

Step 3 
File Original Forms with Court Administration and Pay Filing Fee 

You will  need to file the original  Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim (CCT102)  with Court Administration.  
You may also need to file the Additional Litigants Form (CCT702) and the Power of Attorney for 
Conciliation Court (CCT701), depending on your situation. 

When you file the original  forms with Court Administration, there will  be a filing fee of at least $65 
(in some counties, there is an additional  amount for the law library  fee).  You can find the filing  fees 
for your county online starting at  

If you are a person (not a business), and you cannot afford to pay the filing  fee, please fill out the 
Affidavit of Inability to Pay Conciliation Court Fee (CCT104),  and file it when you file the other 
Conciliation  Court papers.  CCT104  is available online at 
https://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=10&f=173.

Page 6 of 8 

How to File 

You can file the forms with the court in the following ways: 
In person at the courthouse; 

• 
•  By mail;  or 
•  Electronically  through the eFS System (NOTE: once a party files electronically,  they 
are required to use the eFS System throughout the entire case; this means they 
cannot go back to paper filing in that case). For more information about electronic 
filing and the eFS System, see https://minnesota.tylerhost.net/ . 

Step 4 
Serve Each Defendant (if required) 

Court Administration  will create a Summons with a court date for the hearing.  Depending on the 
amount of your claim,  and where Defendant is located, Court Administration may serve the 
Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim and Summons OR send you instructions for service. 

Rule 508(d)  of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice 

Rule 508(d) (revisor.mn.gov/court_rules/rule/gp-508) describes how each defendant should be 
served. 

If Defendant’s address is within the county you’re filing in, and if your claim is less than 
$2,500: 

Court Administration  will try to serve Defendant. 

If your claim is for more than $2,500: 

You must serve Defendant by certified mail, and you must file proof of service with Court 
Administration within 60  days of when the Summons was issued. 

•  Fill  out the Conciliation Court Affidavit of Service (CCT103)  after serving Defendant to 

prove service.  CCT103  is available online at 
https://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=10&f=172. 

If Defendant does not live in Minnesota: 

You will  be required to serve that defendant.   

Please check with Court Administration if you have any questions about serving a defendant in 
Conciliation  Court. 

Step 5 
Prepare for your Hearing, then Appear at the Hearing 

Conciliation  Court hearings are informal, but you must be prepared to present your case.   

If a witness does not want to appear, you can ask Court Administration for a subpoena to order 
them to appear.  There is a fee for each subpoena. 

Instructions – Conciliation Court – Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim 
CCT100      State       ENG 

Rev 5/22                 www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 7 of 8 

Written statements and affidavits of people who do not appear in court have very little  value, and 
the judicial officer may not accept them as evidence. 

You should also bring all other relevant evidence to court such as receipts, repair bills, estimates, 
and other items to help prove your claim.  If a defendant or some other person has documents 
relating to your claim that they will  not give to you, you can get a subpoena from Court 
Administration to require the person to give you the documents. 

Before your hearing, prepare a list of facts you want to present.  Organize your presentation as 
clearly and completely as possible so that you will not forget important facts and details. 

“How to Handle a Conciliation Court Hearing” 

There is a 10-minute video on the Minnesota Judicial Branch website called “How to Handle a 
Conciliation  Court Hearing.”  You can watch that video to get tips on how to prepare for your 
Conciliation  Court hearing.  See 
https://www.mncourts.gov/documents/50/Public/videos/Conciliation%20Court%20Hearing/concilia
tionvideo.htm. 

What happens if you do not appear for the hearing? 

All parties must appear at the hearing.  If you do not appear at the hearing, the judicial officer may 
dismiss your claim  or award a “default” judgment against you on any counterclaims.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
