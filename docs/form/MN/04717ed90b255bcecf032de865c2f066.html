The instructions that follow are numbered the same as the questions on the Responsive 
Notice of Motion and Motion form. 

Mediation - A mediator is a person outside the court system who helps the parties to reach 
an agreement to settle their differences, instead of having someone else (the judge) decide 
for  the  parties.    NOTE:  The  court  cannot  order  you  and  your  spouse  to  attend 
mediation if you or the other party allege domestic violence.  Check off whether you 
want the court to order you and the other party to use a mediator to attempt to reach an 
agreement regarding one or more of the issues listed.  If YES, then check off which issue(s) 
you would like a mediator to help you with. 
 
Legal  Custody  -  Identifies  which  parent(s)  will  have  a  right  to  make  decisions  about 
important  issues  in  the  lives  of  the  children,  including  the  educational,  religious  and 
medical upbringing of the children.  Check off the type of temporary legal custody  you 
would like the court to order. 

Joint legal custody  
Both you and the other parent will have an equal right to make decisions regarding 
the educational, religious and medical upbringing of the children. 

Sole legal custody  
Only one parent will have the right to make decisions regarding the educational, 
religious and medical upbringing of the children.  

 
Physical Custody - Identifies which parent(s) the children will live with.  A parent who 
DOES NOT have physical custody usually has a right to parenting time with the children.  
Parenting  time  was  formerly  called  “visitation.”    Check  off  which  type  of  temporary 
physical custody you would like the court to order:

Parenting Time - Check off whether temporary parenting time with the children should 
be  supervised  or  unsupervised.    Fill  in  the  temporary  parenting  time  schedule  that  you

Child support is money parents pay for the care, support and education of the children.  It 
may  include  a  monthly  court  ordered  amount  for  basic  support,  child  care  support  and 
medical support.  The Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS) has created a child 
support calculator to estimate the amount of child support that the court may order on a 
case.  The calculator is on the DHS website at: 
 http://childsupportcalculator.dhs.state.mn.us/ . 

To answer this question, check off how you would like the Court to decide the issue of 
temporary child support. 

Check box (a) if the children will live with you and you want the other party to pay 
you a monthly child support amount, and then fill in the amount that should be paid. 

Check box (b) if you will be paying temporary child support to the other parent,

you want to ask for an amount other than the guideline amount, read Minn. Stat. § 518A.43 
and explain why you want to deviate from the guideline amount, and how much you want 
child  support  to  be.    You  can  get  a  copy  of  the  statute  at  the  law  library  or  online  at 
http://www.leg.state.mn.us/leg/statutes.asp . 
 
Maintenance - Formerly called “alimony,” maintenance is an amount paid by one spouse 
to the other to help cover living costs and personal expenses.  Check off how you would 
like the court to decide the issue of temporary maintenance.  Check box (a) if neither you 
nor the other party should receive temporary maintenance.  Check box (b) if you do not 
want the court to decide the issue of maintenance at this time.  Check box (c) if you want 
the other party to pay you a specific amount for temporary maintenance, and then fill in 
that amount. 
 
Attorney’s Fees - Check off how you would like the court to decide the issue of attorney’s 
fees.  Check box (a) if you want the court to order you and the other party to each pay your 
own attorney’s fees.  Check box (b) if you want the other party to pay some or all of your

final decree is issued.  Check off who will pay the mortgage and other expenses for 
the home.

If you and your spouse own any vehicles, check box (a) and for each vehicle list the year,

Explain why you want the parenting time schedule that you asked for in your Responsive

Step 3 
Fill Out the Parenting / Financial Disclosure Statement Form  

ill  out  the  Parenting  /  Financial  Disclosure  Statement  form.    This  form  gives  the  court 
background information regarding you and the other party.  This form and its Instructions can be 
found under the Court Forms Category of “Family” (court forms FAM107 and FAM108). 

Step 4 
Confidential Information Form 11.1 (CON111) and  
Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 (CON112), when necessary 

Most documents filed with the court are considered public documents and 
are available to the public.  Certain information that is filed with the court 
may be considered confidential based on court rule and not available to the 
public.  To keep this information confidential and not available to the public, 
you must take certain steps that are described below.   

The steps listed below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  Filers 
who are using eFS to submit their court documents must identify and 
designate their filings as required in Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 11.03 and 14.06.   

Confidential Information Form 11.1 

All social security numbers, employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers (also 
called “restricted identifiers”) must not be listed on papers you file with the court. This is to protect

your privacy, the other parties and your children.   Only provide social security numbers, employer 
identification numbers, and financial account numbers when the court requires this information to 
be provided to the court.  For example, if you must provide the court with bank account numbers, 
or medical account numbers, do not include any account number in your document (your motion, 
supporting affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you must use Form 11.1 to list these confidential numbers.  

If  account  numbers  are  not  required  to  be  provided  to  the  court,  and  the  numbers  appear  on 
documents that are considered available to the public, (such as medical invoices or credit account 
numbers on statements) you must remove the number on the document before filing the document 
with the court. 

Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-
public documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the 
time you file the documents with the court.  You must complete and file the “Cover Sheet for 
Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 (also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public 
documents.  The most common non-public documents are called “financial source documents.”  
Examples of financial source documents include: 

•  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and business 

ou may also need to submit other documents that court rules identify as non-public documents, 
such as a medical record.  For example, a report from a doctor that provides a medical diagnosis 
or treatment plan for you or your child would qualify as a medical record.   

You must use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing other non-public documents, such as medical 
records,  with  the  court.    One  Form  11.2  cover  sheet  can  be  used  for  submitting  all  non-public 
documents.   

The failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being rejected 
by  court  administration,  being  available  to  the  public,  stricken  from  the  court 
record, and sanctions from the court. 

See Rule 11 of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice for more information about how to file 
documents containing social security numbers, financial account numbers, “financial source 
documents” and other non-public documents.   

Form  11.1  and  Form  11.2  can  be  found  at  www.mncourts.gov/forms  under  the  court  forms 
category of “Confidential Information” and is court form number CON111 and CON112.

process." The papers can be served personally (handed to the 
other party), or by mail. If papers are served by mail, Court Rules 
require adding three days. Papers cannot be served on a legal 
holiday.

copy of any and all attachments.  
 

•  The server must give the papers to the other party (or their attorney, if they have one) at 
least 7 days before the hearing date.  For example, if the hearing date is January 30, the 
server must give the papers to the other party on or before January 23.   If January 23 is a 
Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the papers must be served on or before the next day
