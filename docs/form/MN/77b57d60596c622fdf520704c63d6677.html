General Information 

 

Definitions 

Instructions – Conciliation Court Affidavit of Noncompliance 
CCT106      State       ENG 

Rev 10/22                 www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 1 of 5 

“Conciliation Court” is also known as "small claims"  court.  General civil  claims  of $15,000  or 
less can be filed in conciliation  court.  This court allows people to bring their legal claims without the 
expensive costs or complicated legal procedures of district court.  

“Settlement agreement” is when the parties agree to resolve the dispute without having the judicial 
officer decide their dispute. 

“Judgment” is a word that means “the judicial  officer’s decision” or “the judicial  officer’s order.” 

“Entry” or “Entered” is the word used when a judgment is filed in the case by the Court 
Administrator.  This usually starts the timeframe when a judgment can be appealed. 

When can you use the Affidavit of Noncompliance in Conciliation Court? 

The Affidavit of Noncompliance may be used ONLY IF all  of the below are true for your case:   

•  Your case was in conciliation  court (you cannot use these forms if your case was in district 

court);  

•  The parties signed a settlement agreement;  
•  The settlement agreement is part of the court record;  
•  The settlement agreement and/or court order says the Court may enter a judgment without 
a hearing if the agreement is violated and one of the parties files an affidavit explaining how 
the agreement was violated; AND 

•  One of the parties violated the terms of the settlement agreement. 

If you are not sure if all  of the above are true for your case, you should talk to an attorney 
(mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx).  
 

Step 1 
Fill Out the Affidavit of Noncompliance (CCT107) 

The Caption 

The caption is at the top of the form.  It looks like this: 

Instructions – Conciliation Court Affidavit of Noncompliance 
CCT106      State       ENG 

Rev 10/22                 www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 2 of 5 

 

A.  Fill in the county where the Conciliation  Court was filed.  If you are unsure of any information 
needed for the caption, you can find this information on any official court document from 
your case.  You may be able to look at case documents on the Judicial  Branch website 
(mncourts.gov/Access-Case-Records.aspx). 

B.  Fill  in the Judicial  District  for the county where the Conciliation  Court case was filed.  If you 
do not know the judicial district,  you can find a map with all  of the judicial  districts at 
https://mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx.  

C.  Fill  in the Court File Number from the Conciliation  Court case. 

D.  On the line marked “Plaintiff,” fill in the name of the Plaintiff as listed on the Conciliation 

Court settlement agreement and/or court order. 

E.  On the line marked “Defendant,” fill in the name of the Defendant as listed on the 

Conciliation  Court settlement agreement and/or court order. 

The Affidavit 

are true. 

5.  In paragraph #6: 

1.  Check the box next to “Plaintiff” if you were the Plaintiff, or next to “Defendant” if you were 

the Defendant in the Conciliation  Court case. 

2.  Fill  in the date you signed the settlement agreement with the other party. 

3.  In paragraphs #3 and #4, you do not need to fill in anything, but make sure the statements 

4.  In paragraph #5, describe how the other party did not follow the settlement agreement. 

•  List the amount the other party has paid under the terms of the settlement 

agreement.  If the party has not paid you anything, fill in $0.00. 

•  List the amount the other party still  owes you. 

6.  You do not need to fill  in anything in paragraph #7. 

The Signature Block 

Date and sign the Affidavit of Noncompliance, and print contact information in the blanks under the 
signature line.  When you sign the Affidavit of Noncompliance, you are signing under penalty of 
perjury.  This means you are saying that everything in the form is true and correct; if you know 
something in the form is not true when you sign it, you could be found guilty of the crime of perjury 
(see Minn. Stat. § 609.48,  revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.48).

Page 3 of 5 

Step 2 
Make Copies of the Affidavit of Noncompliance (CCT107) 

1.  Make one copy of the signed Affidavit of Noncompliance form for each party in your case, 

including  one copy for yourself.   

2.  The original  will be filed with court administration (later in step 4).   

 

Step 3 
Serve the Affidavit of Noncompliance (CCT107) on the other parties. 
Complete the Affidavit of Service – Combined (SOP105). 

The other parties must receive a copy of the Affidavit of Noncompliance that you plan to file with 
the court.  This is called “service of process.”  The Affidavit of Noncompliance form can be served 
personally (hand delivered to the other party) or served by mail.   

Papers CANNOT be served on legal holidays as defined in Minn. Stat. § 645.44,  subd. 5 
(revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44). 

The Affidavit of Noncompliance can be served by any of the following: 

Who Can Serve 

•  The sheriff; 
•  Another adult; or 
•  You. 

To serve the papers personally: 

The server hands the Affidavit of Noncompliance to the other party or a person “of suitable age and 
discretion” at the other party’s home if that person lives with the other party. 

To serve the papers by mail: 

The server places one copy of the Affidavit of Noncompliance in an envelope. The server writes your 
return address and the last known address of the other party on the front of the envelope. The 
server places the correct amount of postage on the envelope. The server may want to take the 
envelope to the post office to be weighed to make sure they have the right amount of postage.  The 
envelope should be mailed using first class mail.   

After the paperwork is served on the other party (not before), the person who served the Affidavit 
of Noncompliance must fill out the Affidavit of Service - Combined (SOP105).

Step 4 
File the Affidavit of Noncompliance (CCT107) & Affidavit of Service – Combined 
(SOP105) with Court Administration 

File the original Affidavit of Noncompliance (CCT107) and Affidavit of Service - Combined (SOP105) 
forms with court administration  in the county where your conciliation  court case was filed.   

 

 

Ways to File 

How to File 

At the Courthouse 

•  You will  need to file the original  forms with Court 

Electronic  filing through 
the eFS System 

• 

Administration. 

•  This can be done either in person at the courthouse or by mail.  

Addresses for courthouses are online at 
https://www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx.  

If you have an account, or want to create one, with the eFS 
System, you can file electronically  (eFile).  See 
https://www.mncourts.gov/eFile.  NOTE: Once you decide to 
eFile, you must continue to eFile for the entire case. 

What to Expect Next… 

The judicial  officer will review the Affidavit of Noncompliance and may sign an Order for Judgment if 
the judicial officer decides the requirements to enter judgment have been met. If the judicial officer 
signs an Order for Judgment, Court Administration  will provide a copy of the Notice and the Order 
for Judgment and Judgment to all parties of the case.   

Sometimes the judicial  officer may schedule a hearing before signing an Order for Judgment. If this 
happens, you will  get a Notice of Hearing from Court Administration instructing when to appear in 
court.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
