      <pre>Dissolution of Marriage 
Instructions for Serving a Summons and Petition by Alternate Means 
Minn. Stat. § 518.11(c) 

When  to  Use  the  Application  for  an  Order  for  Service  by  Alternate 
Means:  
• 

In  a  Dissolution  of  Marriage  case,  the  Petitioner  arranges  to  have  someone 
else hand-deliver the Summons and Petition to the petitioner's spouse. This is 
called "personal service."  
In some cases, it is not possible to find the spouse, and the Petitioner must ask 
the judge to order the Summons and Petition delivered some other (alternate) 
way.  

• 

•  The judge's order can say that the papers must be mailed to the spouse's last 
known address and/or mailed to another address (like a relative's home) where 
it is likely the papers will be given to the spouse. 

•  The judge can also order the Summons to be published in a legal newspaper. 
The  cost  of  publishing  the  summons  must  be  paid  by  Petitioner,  unless 
Petitioner  gets  a  fee  waiver  (In  Forma  Pauperis  or  "IFP")  signed  by  a  judge 
that specifically waives the service of process and publication costs.  

teps to Request an Order to Serve by Alternate Means: 

.  Complete these papers: 

- Summons and Petition 
- Application for Service by Alternate Means 
- Order for Service by Alternate Means.  Fill out only the top portion with the 
County  name,  Judicial  District,  Court  File  Number,  and  names  of  Petitioner 
and  Respondent.    Do  NOT  mark  the  boxes  or  lines  below  “Name  of 
Respondent.” 
- Affidavit for Proceeding In Forma Pauperis if you need a fee waiver (only if 
you have a very low income and cannot pay the court filing fee and service of 
process costs). 

2.  File your Summons and Petition with the court.  You must pay a filing fee, unless a 

judge signed a fee waiver.   

3.   At  the  same  time  you  file  your  Summons  and  Petition,  give  your  completed 
Application for Service by Alternate Means and Order for Service by Alternate Means 
to  court  staff.    Court  staff  will  forward  your  completed  Application  for  Service  by 
Alternate Means and Order to a judge for review, or tell you to go see the judge.  If 
the judge finds that personal service cannot be made, the judge will sign an Order for 
Service by Alternate Means and file it with the court administrator’s office.  You will 
receive a copy of that Order. 

4.  Read the Order for Service by Alternate Means carefully. 

• 

 If the Order requires mailing the Summons and Petition, get someone else, who 
is  at  least  18  years  old,  to  mail  the  papers  for  you.    The  envelope  must  be 
addressed to your spouse, at the address or addresses listed in the Order. On the

envelope write "Forwarding address requested". The person who mails the papers 
for you must fill out the Affidavit of Service by Mail and sign it under penalty of 
perjury.  By signing the Affidavit of Service by Mail under penalty of perjury, the 
server is stating that the information in the Affidavit is true to the best of his / her 
knowledge.    Perjury  is  the  crime  of  intentionally  lying  or  misrepresenting  the 
truth,  punishable  by  jail  or  other  sanctions.  The  Affidavit  of  Service  by  Mail  is 
your proof the papers were served on your spouse.  
If  the  Order  requires  publication,  read  carefully  to  see  what  county  you  must 
publish  in.  Take  a  copy  of  your  Summons  to  a  legal  newspaper  in  that  county.  
Ask  court  administration  for  the  names  of  the  local  legal  newspapers  or  contact 
the  court  in  the  county  where  publication  is  ordered.    Your  Summons  must  be 
published for three consecutive weeks in the legal newspaper.  When it has been 
published  three  consecutive  weeks,  the  newspaper  will  send  you  an  Affidavit 
along  with  a  clipping  of  the  publication.    The  Affidavit  indicates  the  three  dates 
that your Summons was published. This Affidavit is your proof the Summons was 
published.  

• 

 

File  all  Affidavits  with  court  administration  (Affidavit  of  Publication  and  Affidavit  of 
Mailing, if applicable).  Keep a copy of each Affidavit for your records.  

ther Important Information You Need to Know 

our spouse has 30 days after being served with your Summons and Petition to object by 
serving you with an Answer. If your spouse does not respond in 30 days, you can ask the 
judge to give you everything you asked for in your Petition, because your spouse would 
be in "default".   If  you have an Order for Service by Alternate Means, your spouse has 
defaulted when: 
 

• 
• 

It has been 51 days since someone mailed the papers to your spouse, and/or 
It has been 51 days since the Summons was first published in the newspaper. 

f  your  spouse  does  not  respond  by  serving  you  with  an  Answer,  there  are  other  forms 
you  need  to  fill  out  and  file  to  get  your  divorce.  See  the  instructions  that  go  with  the 
divorce forms for more information about completing a "default" divorce.   

f your spouse does not respond, and you served your spouse by publication or mail, the 
court must "reserve" spousal maintenance. You must check "the issue of maintenance is 
reserved"  in  the  Findings  of  Fact,  Conclusions  of  Law,  Order  for  Judgment,  Judgment 
and Decree you file with the court in the “default” process.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
