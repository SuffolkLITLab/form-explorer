• 
•  be at least 18 years of age (a parent, legal guardian or next of kin may file on behalf of a minor); and

mislead anyone by the change of name.   
Indicate the name and date of birth of your spouse, (if there is a spouse), even if your spouse is not 
having his/her name changed. 
Indicate any minor children and their dates of birth, (if there are any children), even if the children 
are not having their names changed.   
List all legal descriptions of property if you, your spouse, or minor children have a claim, interest or 
lien on any property.  You must show who has interest and the nature of the interest in the property.  
You  may  need  to  attach  a  separate  piece  of  paper  to  the  application  with  this  information  on  it.  
Example of Legal Description: Lot 1, Block 4, Hamden Edition, Hennepin County, Minnesota. You 
can get a copy of the legal description from the Deed, Contract for Deed or Certificate of Title at the 
office of the County Recorder or Registrar of Titles in the county where the property is located.  Do 
not use property descriptions found on tax statements. 
The application must be signed under penalty of perjury.  By signing the application under penalty 
of perjury, you are stating that the information in the document is true to the best of your knowledge.  
Perjury is the crime of intentionally lying or misrepresenting the truth, punishable by jail or other 
sanctions.

application.  Minors under 14 years of age do not need to sign the application. 

8.  After you have completed the forms, bring or mail the completed application to the district court in 
your county, along with the applicable filing fee.  Contact information and filing fee information can

http://mn.gov/law-library/research-links/county-law-libraries.jsp .  For more information, 
contact your court administrator or call the Minnesota State Law Library at 651-297-7651. 

If you have any difficulty filling out the forms, you should consult an attorney. 

1. 
The Court Administrator’s office will provide you with a hearing date and time. 
2.  All minors seeking to have their name changed must be present at the court hearing. 
3. 
4. 

Two witnesses that know you must appear with you in court and testify as to your identity. 
If your application is approved at the time of the hearing, the judge will sign the Order Granting 
Name Change. 

5.  After the Order is signed, you can obtain certified copies of the Order from the Court Administrator’s 
office for a fee of $14 each.  Certified copies of this order will be needed to change your personal 
records (see the document entitled Notice to Persons Who Have Had Their Name Changed for 
more information).   

 
BPARENTAL NOTICE OF NAME CHANGE OF A MINOR: Minnesota Statute § 259.10 states that 
no  minor  child's  name  may  be  changed  without  both  parents  having  notice  of  the  pending 
application of change of name.  The applicant must show proof that the non-applicant parent(s) has 
received notification of the Application for Name Change of a Minor. 
 

If  the  non-applicant  parent  is  not  listed  on  the  birth  certificate  and  there  is  no  order  assigning 
parenthood, bring a certified copy of the birth certificate to the court hearing to show the judge 
that the non-applicant parent’s name does not appear on the birth certificate. 

earing: 

  H

If the address of the non-applicant parent is known,  you  will have to  show proof  that the non-
applicant  parent  has  received  notification  of  the  Application  for  Name  Change  of  a  Minor.  
Counties differ on the type of proof required.  Contact your county court administration office and 
ask if they require certified mail or personal service for minor name change cases. 
 
If your county court staff informs you certified mail is required, once you have a hearing date, then 
send a certified letter (return receipt requested) to the parent indicating the date, time, place, and 
purpose of the hearing.  You should bring the return receipt card to the court hearing with a copy 
of the letter as proof to the judge that the non-applicant parent received notice of the name change 
proceedings. 
 
If  your  county  court  staff  tells  you  personal  service  is  required,  then  read  the  Instructions  for 
Personal Service – Minor Name Change and complete the Affidavit of Personal Service.  Both of 
these documents are available at www.mncourts.gov/forms.  You should bring the Affidavit of 
Personal Service with you to the court hearing as proof to the judge that the non-applicant parent 
was personally serviced with notice of the name change proceedings. 

 

If you do not know the address of the non-applicant parent(s), you should bring to court a signed 
Affidavit in Support of Order for Publication (this affidavit and instructions are available with the 
Minor Name Change forms at www.mncourts.gov/forms.  If so ordered by a judge, you may be 
required to  give service  by  alternative means or  to publish a Notice of Hearing  by Publication 
(Minor  Name  Change)  in  a  designated  newspaper  at  your  own  expense.    It  is  the  applicant’s 
responsibility  to  arrange  publication  and  file  the  Affidavit  of  Publication  with  the  Court 
Administrator’s office prior to the scheduled hearing date.  See Instructions for Publishing Notice 
for Name Change of a Minor for more detailed information on this process.

If  the  information  on  a  birth  record  is  wrong  because  a  mistake  was  made  when  the  birth  record  was 
created, mistakes may be corrected  through  your local County  Vital Statistics office or  the Minnesota 
Department of Health.  Procedures to amend the birth record can be found on the Minnesota Department 
of Health web site at https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/vitalrecords/amend.html or by calling the 
Minnesota  Department  of  Health  at  651-201-5000.    Please  refer  to  Minnesota  State  Agency  Rules 
4601.1000 and 4601.1100 for further information.  
  
You should consult an attorney for further information on when changing a birth record is appropriate and 
what information you should include in your Application for Name Change and Other Relief. You may 
specifically ask the judge on your Application for Name Change and Other Relief to order the birth record 
changed.  You must check the appropriate boxes on the Application for Name Change and Other Relief 
to request any other changes to your birth record and to explain why changing your birth record to reflect 
the legal name change or other information is appropriate.  If a judge determines a change on your birth 
record is warranted the judge will include that provision in the final name change order that will direct the 
Department of Health to amend and/or replace a birth record.  If the request to amend a birth record is for 
a minor child, the Court must find that a change of a minor child’s name is in the best interests of the 
child. 

f you previously were granted a name change in Minnesota and you only want to request replacement 
of your birth record, and you still live in the county where your name change matter was heard, you may 
use your existing name change court file.  You will need to complete the Motion to Replace Birth 
Record (court form NAM113) and Order Granting Replacement Birth Record (court form NAM114).  
Use the same court file number that appears on your Order Granting Name Change.  You must pay the 
motion fee.  However, if you no longer live in the same county where the name change matter was 
heard, or this is your initial request to change your name, you must use the Application for Name 
Change and Other Relief (court form NAM102) and Order Granting Name Change and Other Relief 
(court form NAM107) and must pay the initial filing fee. 

riminal History Check: 

Minn.  Stat.  §  259.11  requires  the  Court  to  determine  whether  any  person  seeking  to  have  their  name 
changed has a criminal history in Minnesota or any other state.  The court may conduct a search of national 
records through the Federal Bureau of Investigation by submitting a set of fingerprints and the required 
fee to the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.  To comply, you must complete a Criminal History Check 
Release form for each party age 10 and over covered by the application.  A criminal history check will be 
made on all persons age 10 and over listed on the application.   If any applicant has a criminal history, 
both the person whose name is changed and the Court shall report the change within 10 days of 
receiving a copy of the order by mailing a copy of the order granting the name change to:

MN  55101.    Proof  of  service  shall  be  filed  with  the  court  as  part  of  the  name  change  request.    The 
prosecuting authority has 30 days to object to the name change application.   

hat happens if the prosecutor or attorney general objects? The person asking for the name change can 
contest the objection by filing a motion with the court. The law requires the Judge to deny the name change 
request, unless the person asking for the name change can prove by clear and convincing evidence that 
the request is not based upon an intent to defraud or mislead, is made in good faith, will not cause injury 
to a person, and will not compromise public safety; or, that failure to allow the name change would infringe 
on  a  constitutional  right  of  the  person  asking  for  the  name  change.  Read  Minnesota  Statutes  Section 
259.13, Subds.1-6 to see all the requirements in the law. The court does not have forms or instructions for 
a motion to contest the objection. You should seek help from a lawyer if you want to contest the objection 
of the prosecutor or attorney general. 

equest for Name Change by an Inmate: 

An inmate confined in a correctional facility may request a name change only once, unless the failure to 
allow the name change  would infringe on a constitutional right of an inmate.   Inmates  must fill out an 
additional affidavit entitled Inmate Affidavit for Name Change (NAM105).

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
