Step 6 
Background Study 

Read the Notice to Proposed Guardians/Conservators Regarding Background Check Requirements 
(GAC104) to see if a background study needs to be completed. 

If a background study is required, and the proposed Guardian/Conservator has completed a 
background study within the last 5 years, fill out the Affidavit Regarding Background Study 
(GAC102), include a copy of the most recent DHS background study, and file them with Court 
Administration. 

NOTE: If filing  paper documents, you must use the Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents 
Form 11.2  when filing a background study.  Filers who are using eFS to submit their court 
documents must identify and designate their filings as required in Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 11.02 
and 14.06.   

The failure to use Form 11.2  may result in your document being rejected by court 
administration, being available to the public, stricken from the court record, and sanctions 
from the court.  

See Rule 11 of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice for more information about how to 
file documents containing social  security numbers, financial account numbers, “financial 
source documents” and other non-public documents.  

Form 11.2  can be found at www.mncourts.gov/forms under the court forms category of 
“Confidential Information” and is court form number CON111  and CON112.

Page 8 of 14 

If a background study is required, fill out the DHS Background Check Form (GAC103).  Be sure to 
read the instructions with GAC103. 

Step 7 
File with Court Administration 

You will  need to file the following forms with Court Administration in the county where the 
Respondent lives: 

•  Petition for Appointment of Guardian and/or Conservator (GAC 5-U); 
•  Acceptance of Appointment (GAC 1-U); 
•  Proposed Order Appointing Guardian and/or Conservator (GAC 8-U); 
•  Proposed Notice of Hearing and Notice of Rights (GAC 6-U); 
•  Proposed Letters of Guardianship/Conservatorship (GAC 4-U); 
•  After service is completed: Affidavits of Service (GAC 2-U). 

Note: a “proposed” form (Order, Notice, or Letter, for example), for purposes of eFiling, means a 
form not signed by a judicial  officer. 

If a background study is required, you may also need to file: 

•  Affidavit Regarding Background Study (GAC102). 

Filing Fee 

There will be a fee when filing these documents.  If the Respondent cannot afford the filing  fee, you 
can apply for a fee waiver based on the Respondent’s financial situation.  The fee waiver forms are 
online at www.mncourts.gov/forms (choose the “Fee Waiver / In Forma Pauperis” category and look 
for IFP401 and IFP402). 

Step 8 
Make Copies, Serve Copies, and File Affidavits of Service 

NOTE: Originals  must be filed with Court Administration.   Make a copy of everything you file for 
your records. 

Make enough copies for yourself, the Respondent, and any interested persons that need to be 
served. 

Serving Interested Persons 

You must serve the Notice of Hearing and Notice of Rights and the Petition for Appointment of 
Guardian and/or Conservator on all  interested persons, including  the head of the facility  if the 
Respondent is a patient of a state hospital, regional center, or any state operated service. 

These documents must be personally served on each interested person at least 14 days before the 
hearing, or mailed by first class mail  at least 17 days before the hearing.  NOTE: papers cannot be

(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44#stat.645.44.5).   

After you served all  of the interested persons, fill out the Affidavit of Service form (GAC 2-U). 

Serving the Respondent 

Ask Court Administration if a “Court Visitor” will  be appointed to meet with the Respondent.  

• 

• 

If a Court Visitor is appointed, then the Court Visitor will  serve the Respondent with the 
papers. 
If no Court Visitor is appointed, then you are responsible for arranging  personal service of the 
Notice of Hearing and Notice of Rights and the Petition for Appointment of Guardian and/or 
Conservator on the Respondent at least 14 days before the hearing.  NOTE: papers cannot be 
served on a legal holiday as defined in Minn. Stat. § 645.44,  subd. 5 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44#stat.645.44.5).  You cannot be the one to 
personally serve the Respondent.  The person who hand-delivers the papers will need to fill 
out the Affidavit of Service (GAC 2-U). 

What to Expect Next… 

There will be a hearing.  To prepare for the hearing, it is a good idea to look at the court rules.  You 
can visit a law library  (https://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Law-Libraries.aspx) to read the court rules.  
It is important to be on time and be prepared for the hearing.

Glossary 

Affidavit: A statement made under penalty of perjury (Minn. Stat. § 358.116). 

Anniversary Date: The date (month-day-year) that the Letters of Guardianship and/or 
Conservatorship were issued (signed by the judicial  officer) is the anniversary date.  This date 
remains fixed from year to year and is the date that is used to determine the period-ending date for 
filing annual reports and other required documents.   

Bond: A promise by a bonding company that protects the person subject to conservatorship from 
mismanagement by the conservator.  In the event of mismanagement, the court may decide that 
the bond will reimburse the estate for the missing money, and the company that issued the bond 
can recover the money from the conservator. 

Burden of Proof:  Responsibility of a party to prove a fact.  The amount of proof required varies with 
the type of case.  In guardianship and conservatorship cases, the burden of proof is clear and 
convincing evidence.

CAAP: The Conservator Account Auditing Program (CAAP) provides centralized oversight of 
conservator accounts. 

CARP: The Conservator Account Review Program (CARP) reviews inventories and accounts of 
conservators not subject to audit. 

Contested: When any party objects to the petition or to the hearing. 

Continuance: When the court has agreed to postpone the hearing date. 

Co-Conservator (also, Co-Guardian): When more than one person is appointed to serve as a 
decision-maker. 

Conservator:  A person appointed by the court to make financial  decisions for the protected person.  
A conservator typically  has the power to enter into contracts, pay bills,  invest assets, and perform 
other financial  functions for the person subject to conservatorship. 

Conservatorship: A conservatorship exists when the court appoints a conservator  to handle 
financial  matters for another person.  The person for whom a conservator handles financial  affairs is 
called a person subject to conservatorship.  Conservatorships are appointed to protect the finances 
of the person subject to conservatorship. 

Emergency Conservatorship (Guardianship): In emergency situations where the process of 
petitioning for a general conservatorship (or guardianship) is reasonably expected to cause danger 
to the respondent’s personal safety or financial security, an emergency conservatorship (or 
guardianship) may be requested.  In this instance, the requirement of providing a minimum of two 
weeks’ notice to the respondent and interested persons is waived.  An emergency conservatorship 
(or guardianship) is granted for a specific, usually short, duration. 

Estate: A person’s income, assets, real estate, or any other financial  holdings. 

Guardian: The person appointed by the court to make personal decisions for the person subject to 
guardianship, such as where to live, medical  decisions, training and education, etc. 

Guardianship: A guardianship exists when a guardian  is appointed by the court to handle personal 
decisions for another person.  The person for whom a guardian handles personal affairs is called a 
person subject to guardianship.  Guardianships are only appointed to protect the personal well-
being of the person subject to guardianship. 

Hearing: A court proceeding that is conducted before a judge or referee which allows a person or 
persons to present their case. 

Incapacitated  person: An individual  who, for reasons other than being a minor, is impaired to the 
extent of lacking sufficient understanding or capacity to make personal decisions and who is unable 
to meet personal needs for medical care, nutrition, clothing, shelter, or safety, even with 
appropriate technological and supported decision making assistance. 

In Forma  Pauperis (IFP) (Fee Waiver): Minnesota law states that the court may authorize a case to 
proceed in formal pauperis, without payment of court costs for those who qualify based on current

Less Restrictive Alternative: If there are other ways to assist an individual with their care and 
management of their finances, such as a family member providing the individual with assistance in 
making personal or financial decisions or appointing a Power of Attorney, these methods are 
considered “less restrictive alternatives” or “less restrictive means.”  Before the court appoints a 
guardian or conservator, less restrictive alternatives must be explored and ruled out before 
petitioning for the appointment of a guardianship or conservatorship. 

Oath: A sworn promise to perform and act faithfully and truthfully.

guardian, lacks sufficient understanding or capacity  to make or communicate responsible personal 
decisions, and who has an inability  to meet personal needs for medical care, nutrition, clothing,

Person Subject to Conservatorship:  A person who has a court appointed conservator because they 
lack the capacity  or ability  to make decisions regarding their financial affairs or estate. Before the

Petition: A legal document requesting action or relief from the court. 

Petitioner: The person who brings a petition before the court. 

Respondent: The person for whom appointment of a guardian  or conservator is sought. 

Successor Conservator:  Appointed by the court when the person subject to conservatorship is still 
in need of a conservator, but the current conservator dies, resigns, or is removed.

still  in need of a guardian, but the limited duration of the current guardianship is set to expire or the 
current guardian  dies, resigns, or is removed. 

Supported Decision Making: A person acting, either informally as a family member or friend, or 
formally, as a proxy, agent, guardian or conservator, on behalf of an incapacitated  person in making 
relevant decisions regarding personal and medical issues and/or financial  issues.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
