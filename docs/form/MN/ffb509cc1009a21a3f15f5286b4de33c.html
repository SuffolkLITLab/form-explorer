INTRODUCTION 
 

This introduction summarizes the process of asking the court to change custody. Steps 1-9 of these 
Instructions explain the process in detail.  

 judge can only change or modify custody if the standards for changing custody are met.  The Legislature has 

spelled out those standards in Minn. Stat. § 518.18 (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/518.18).  It is 
your responsibility to give the judge the information s/he needs to decide if your request meets the legal 
standards.  The forms listed on the cover page of these Instructions are designed to prompt you to provide the 
necessary information.  

irst you fill out two forms called Notice of Motion and Motion and Affidavit in Support of Motion to Change 
Custody.  The information in the Affidavit must be very detailed.  It will probably take you 2 or more hours to 
fill in the paperwork. The Affidavit in Support of Motion is your written testimony explaining why you think 
there should be a change in custody.  You can also get Affidavits from other people to support what you say, 
and attach them to your Affidavit.  

hen your paperwork is complete, you must serve copies of the papers on the other party. You will file the 

originals with the court, and you may have to pay a court filing fee.  After receiving your papers, the other 
party might serve you with responsive papers, explaining his or her opposition to your Motion.  Then you go 
to your court hearing. 

hat Happens at the Court Hearing? 

f the other party disagrees with your request to change custody, there will usually be two court hearings.  At 
the first hearing, the judge will only consider the written Affidavits you and the other party filed. The first 
hearing is short – up to 30 minutes.  At this hearing, the judge will decide if you have presented a “prima facie 
case.”  

or purposes of deciding if you have presented a “prima facie case”, the judge will assume that all facts stated 

in your Affidavit are true.  If the facts described in your written Affidavit support a change in custody, the 
judge may schedule a second, longer hearing. At the second hearing you and the other party will testify under 
oath and bring witnesses.  The judge will then decide what the facts really are, and will decide if those facts 
support a change of custody.  However, if the judge decides at the first hearing that s/he will not change 
custody even if you prove that everything in your Affidavit is true, then you do not have a “prima facie case” 
and your case will be dismissed after the first hearing (that will be the end of your case).  The judge will 
evaluate your Affidavit by considering the facts you include, not your conclusions.  You must give the judge 
sufficient information so the judge can draw his/her own conclusions.  It is very important to do a good job 
writing your Affidavit.  

void this Mistake:  Often people think they can briefly write what they want in the Motion and Affidavit 

forms, and supply the details to the judge at the hearing.  If you do this, the judge may limit what you can 
present or say at the hearing to what was stated in your Motion and Affidavit, and that may not be enough to 
convince the judge to grant your request to change custody.  If your case is dismissed, you may be prohibited 
from filing another motion to change custody until 2 years later.  (See Minn. Stat. § 518.18 for restrictions on 
asking for a modification of custody.)

If you choose to represent yourself, the court rules say that you are responsible for knowing the law and rules, 
just like an attorney.  The judge cannot give you special consideration or help because you are not a lawyer.  
Your written Affidavits, filed at least 21 days before the first hearing, must present a “prima facie case” or 
your case will be dismissed. Include facts in your Affidavit, not just your conclusions.  For example, stating, 
“the other parent abuses the child” is a conclusion.  State the facts so the judge can decide if the actions taken 
by the other parent constitute abuse.  

ustody Evaluations 

On many occasions at the end of the first hearing the judge will ask for a custody evaluation in order to have 
someone gather facts to help the judge make a decision.  A custody evaluation from Family Court Services 
takes at least 120 days, and there is a cost involved.  (If a party has an “IFP” the fee may be waived. “IFP” is 
explained at Step 8.)  If a custody evaluation is ordered, the gap between the first, short hearing and the second 
evidentiary hearing often will be at least several months. The judge may also appoint a guardian ad litem to do 
a custody evaluation.  This person may or may not be a lawyer. 

f the Child is in Danger 
In extremely rare cases, a judge may change custody on a temporary basis before a full hearing with live 
testimony has been heard by the court.  Those rare cases involve situations in which the child is in immediate, 
significant danger if the existing custody arrangement continues.  If your child is in immediate danger, you 
may seek legal advice from a private attorney or other legal services provider; contact social services; seek an 
Order for Protection; or request an emergency expedited hearing.   

 

Please Note:  An Order for Protection (OFP) might be available in extreme situations, but an OFP will not 
permanently change custody.  You need to use the motion papers listed on the cover page of these Instructions 
to request a permanently change custody.  You can get help with Orders for Protection from the court 
administrator’s office or local domestic abuse advocacy programs.   

f you choose to request an emergency expedited hearing, you will need to draft your own court forms or seek 
help from a private attorney or other legal service provider, as there are no court forms available from court 
administration or on the public website.   

f your child is the subject of a child in need of protection or services (CHIPS) proceeding or certain 
delinquency proceedings, the Court may not be able to immediately decide your request to establish 
custody.

8.  You do not have to write anything for this question, but you should read and understand it. 

ead the Verification and Acknowledgement carefully.  By signing your name, you are telling the 
Court that you are telling the truth and that you have a good faith reason for your requests.  If you 
are not telling the truth, or if you are misleading the Court or if you are serving or filing this 
document for an improper purpose, the Court can order you to pay money to the other party. 
 

Step 2 
Fill Out the Affidavit in Support of Motion Form 

ill out the Affidavit in Support of Motion form, which tells the Court and the other party what you are 

asking for from the Court and why you are asking for it. 

ILL IN THE TOP PART OF THE FORM (KNOWN AS THE “CAPTION”) 

Fill in the top part of the form (caption) the same way you did on the Notice of Motion and Motion 
form. 
Print your name on the blank above Paragraph/Question #1. 

Fill in Paragraphs/ Questions 1-37** 

*Note:  If you are asking to change legal custody only, answer only paragraphs/questions 1 through 11, 36 
and 37 on the Affidavit. The other questions are only necessary for a change in physical custody. 

ead the questions on the Affidavit carefully and answer each question with detailed, specific information. 
Attach all copies of day care, school, medical or other documents that help support the statements in 
your Affidavit. These copies should be in Affidavit form, if possible.  The Affidavit is a statement that 
must be signed under penalty of perjury.  The Affidavit should start with this sentence:  “ 
 
for example, the name of the doctor or daycare provider.  Signing an Affidavit under penalty of perjury 
means the person is stating that the information in the Affidavit is true to the best of his/her knowledge.  
Perjury is the crime of intentionally lying or misrepresenting the truth, punishable by jail or other sanctions. 

, state the following:…”  The name of the person giving the information goes into the blank space; 

 

he Introduction section on page 3 explains that the judge will read your Affidavit in Support of Motion to 

Change Custody and determine if you have presented a prima facie case.  Questions/paragraphs 1-37 
prompt you to give information that the judge must have in order to decide if you have presented a prima 
facie case. Question/paragraph 37 is a place to write anything else you think is important in your case.  
Generally, you will not be allowed to tell the judge additional information other than what is listed in your 
affidavit at the first hearing.  If you want the judge to know something, put it in writing in your 
Affidavit.  

uestions 15-35 will help the court determine the appropriate amount of child support.  If you want an 
estimate of how much child support may be ordered by the court if a change in physical custody is granted, 
you can use a calculator created by the Department of Human Services, which is available on line at: 

http://childsupportcalculator.dhs.state.mn.us/

Step 3 
Complete Confidential Information Forms 

OTE!   

Certain information is considered confidential and not available to the public.  
To keep this information private and not available to the public, you must 
attach  Form11.1 or Form 11.2 to certain documents that contain confidential 
information.   

ee Rule 11 of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice for more information.  One form can be 

used for all documents containing confidential information.  Examples of documents that have 
confidential information include: 

  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and business expenses 
•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers   
 
To protect your privacy, the other party, and your children, all social security numbers, employer 
identification numbers, and financial account numbers must not be listed on papers you file with the 
court.  You must use Form 11.1 when providing these confidential numbers to the court.  Form 11.1 
can be found at www.mncourts.gov/forms under the court forms category of “Confidential Information” 
and is court form number CON111.  Failure to do this means these numbers could be available to the 
general public and you could be charged court costs and the court may order other sanctions against you for 
the failure to keep your and the other party’s social security number, employer identification number, 
and/or financial account numbers private.  If these numbers are already on file with the court, you do 
not need to submit another Form 11.1.

***Call the Court if you have questions. Usually the judge may not listen to live testimony at the first 
hearing.  If  you  have  requested  an  emergency  hearing  and  claim  the  child  is  in  immediate danger, you 
may have to testify at the first hearing.   

o not bring children to the first hearing, unless the judge requests that you to bring them.  

he hearing is very formal. You are expected to know and follow the court rules of procedure.  You 
should dress appropriately and be respectful to the other party and to everyone in the courtroom.  Do not 
interrupt the judge or other party.  Try to stay calm, and avoid unnecessarily criticizing the other party.  
Answer  any  questions  from  the  judge  honestly.  Direct  all  your  comments  to  the  judge,  not  the  other 
party.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
