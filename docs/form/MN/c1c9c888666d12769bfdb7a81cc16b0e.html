General Information about  
Docketing a Foreign Judgment  

docketing a judgment from a different state or a federal court. A judgment from a different state 
or from a federal court is called a “foreign judgment.” If you do not understand any of the 
following steps or do not know if these forms are right for your situation, you should speak with 
an attorney for legal advice. Court staff cannot give legal advice. 

Definitions: 

•  Docketing:  a  formal  process  to  record  a  money  judgment  with  the  court,  and  make  the 
amount of the judgment a “lien” against certain real estate the debtor owns in that county. 
The judgment creditor must first have a court order that awards the money judgment in 
their favor and the foreign court must direct entry of the judgment. The judgment creditor 
may file a certified copy of that court order, an Affidavit of Identification of Judgment Debtor, 
and an Affidavit of Identification of Judgment Creditor with a Minnesota court. This will direct 
the Minnesota  court to enter  the foreign judgment,  and then  “docket” it if there are no 
objections. 

•  Foreign Judgment: a judgment from a different state, the United States Federal Court, and 

possibly other countries. 

• 

• 

Judgment Creditor: the party who is owed money or other property. 

Judgment Debtor: the party who owes money or other property. 

What is the reason for docketing a foreign judgment? 

The judgment creditor may docket a foreign judgment in Minnesota for many reasons, including: 

1.  To get a lien (a legal claim in property) against the judgment debtor’s real estate located in 

Minnesota;  

OR 

2.  To levy (seize) the judgment debtor’s wages because the employer is located in Minnesota; 

3.  To levy (seize) the judgment debtor’s bank account which is located in Minnesota. 

Once docketed, foreign judgments are treated the same as judgments issued by a Minnesota state 
court. Foreign judgments will last for 10 years from the date of entry in the original court, and the 
judgment  creditor  can  ask  for  Writs  of  Execution  or  Financial  Disclosures  (JGM301)  from  a 
Minnesota court.

How do I get a certified copy of my judgment? 

You will need to contact the court that issued your original judgment and ask how to get a 
certified copy of your judgment. You may need to pay a fee. 

Do you have all the information you need to fill out the forms? 

The Affidavit of Identification of Judgment Creditor (JGM103) and Affidavit of Identification of 
Judgment Debtor (JGM104) asks for the following information: 

•  For each judgment creditor: name and mailing address. 

•  For each judgment debtor: name, home address, mailing address, type of employment, 

and business address (if applicable). 

•  The county and judicial district number where you are filing the foreign judgment. 

 

Step 1 
Fill Out Affidavit of Identification of Judgment Creditor (JGM103) 

If there are multiple judgment creditors, you will need to repeat this step for each one. You 
should have one Affidavit of Identification of Judgment Creditor (JGM103) for each judgment 
creditor. The judgment will only be entered and docketed in favor of the judgment creditor you 
include on each form. 

The “Caption”  

A. 

List the county you will file your case in. A foreign judgment is usually filed in the county 
where the judgment debtor’s:  
• 
Real estate is located;  
• 
Employer is located; OR 
• 
Bank is located. 

B. 

List the Judicial District. Each county belongs in 1 of 10 judicial districts. If you need help, 
see http://www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx.

iii.  This question asks about the person’s occupation. Fill in what the person 

primarily does for a living. Examples include “student, IT, consultant.” If the 
person has multiple occupations, you can choose to list all of the 
occupations, or the one the person does most. 

ote: if this business is also a judgment debtor, writing the name and 
location of the business here does not count as identifying the business 
and will not docket the judgment against the business. You must fill out 
another Affidavit of Identification of Judgment Debtor (JGM104) to identify 
and docket the judgment against the business. 

  N

iv.  Check whether the person owns a business. If yes, fill in the name and 
address where the business is located. Give as much information as 
possible. 

Skip #4b and go to the Signature Block.  

b. 

Check this box if the judgment debtor is a business. 

 

i.  Fill in the full address of the business; give as much information as possible. 

ii.  Check whether the business has a different mailing address. If yes, fill it in 

here. This address can be a post office box.

Identification of Judgment Creditor (JGM103). You are also signing this form under penalty 
of perjury.

Step 3 
File Your Paperwork with Court Administration 

File your paperwork with court administration. You should have: 

•  Affidavit of Identification of Judgment Creditor (JGM103) for each judgment creditor; 

•  Affidavit of Identification of Judgment Debtor (JGM104) for each judgment debtor; and

Page 7 of 8 

•  Certified copy of the foreign judgment. 

You will also need to pay a filing fee, which depends on the county you are filing in and the 
amount of the judgment. The fee is for a “Foreign Judgment Filing,” and is listed online at 
https://www.mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Court-Fees.aspx. Search under “District Court” then 
choose the county where you are filing with the Fee Category as “Judgments” to find the  
filing fee. 

If you are unable to pay the filing fee, you can fill out and file a Fee Waiver (IFP) with your 
paperwork. You can find the Fee Waiver forms online at 
http://www.mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=19&p=69. 

When you file your paperwork, court administration will 
enter your judgment. Court administration will then mail a 
Notice of Filing and Entry of Foreign Judgment to you, any 
other judgment creditors, and the judgment debtors. 

OPTIONAL: Once you receive 
your Notice, you may make a copy 
and send it to the judgment debtor. 
If you do, fill out an Affidavit of 
Service (SOP103) and file it with 
court administration. 

Step 4 
Next Steps: Collecting the Judgment 

The judgment debtors will have 20 days from the date of the notice to file any objections. If no 
objections are filed, court administration will docket the foreign judgment, and you will receive 
a Notice of Docketing of Judgment. Once you receive the Notice of Docketing of Judgment, you 
can start the collection process. 

The steps you take to collect a judgment depends on what information you have. 

Do you know what or where the judgment debtor’s assets, bank, or employer are? 

Yes: you can request a Writ of Execution to collect your judgment. 

No: you can file a Request for Order for Disclosure (JGM302) so that you can find 
out this information. 

Wages: you must give the judgment debtor notice before the sheriff’s office can 
serve the Writ of Execution. 

Bank account: you must give the sheriff’s office additional paperwork with the 
Writ of Execution. 

For more information, see the Judgments Help Topic at http://www.mncourts.gov/Help-
Topics/Judgments.aspx.
