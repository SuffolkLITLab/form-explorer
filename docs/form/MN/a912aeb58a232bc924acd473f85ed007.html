A.  List the county where you will be filing your determination of descent case. Probate cases are 
typically filed in the county where the Decedent was living when they died, or if they were 
not a MN resident, in the MN county where they owned property. If you are not sure where 
you should file, please talk to an attorney. Court staff cannot tell you where to file your case. 

B.  List the Judicial District. Each county belongs in one of ten judicial districts. If you do not 

know the Judicial District, you can find a map with all of the Judicial Districts at 
http://www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx.   

C.  Write in the full legal name of the person who died (first, middle, and last). Include all names 
the person may have been known by, especially if those names are listed on the Will, death 
certificate, or assets.

that apply to describe your relationship to the person who died.

2.  Fill in the date and location of the birth of the person who died.  

3.  Fill in the date and location of the death of the person who died.  

4.  Fill in the street address, city, state, zip code, and county of the legal residence of the 

person who died at the time of their death. If you are not sure what would be considered 
the legal residence, you should speak with an attorney.  

5.  Check either “yes” or “no” to answer whether the person lived in MN when they died. If 

they did not live in MN, you should also check “yes” or “no” to answer whether the person 
owned property in MN when they died. If they did, list the county where the property was 
located.  

Information about the Will and the Personal Representative

6.  First, check a box to say whether the person who died did or did not have a Will.  

 

.  If there was a Will, fill in the dates for any documents the person who died had and 
 

check all of the boxes that may apply.  
o  A Will is a document describing what a person wants to happen to their property after 

they have died.  

o  A codicil is a document that is used to make changes to an existing Will. Rather than 
replacing a Will with a whole new document, a codicil is an additional document 
used to explain or change an existing Will.  

o  A separate writing gifting personal property is a document that lists what the 

testator wants to have happen to specific items of tangible personal property (other 
than cash, coin collections, or property used in a trade/business) that are not 
specifically addressed in the Will. 

Submit any and all of the originals of these documents that you may have. If you only have 
copies and not the original documents, you can submit these instead along with a Statement of 
Contents of Lost, Destroyed, or Otherwise Unavailable Will (PRO1206).  

b.  Next, check the boxes that describe where the Will, codicil (if any), and separate writing 

(if any) can be found, checking all that may apply.

8.  Check a box to say whether you have received any demands for notice, and if you have, 
whether you have given proper notice to anyone who has filed a demand for notice.  
o  A demand for notice is a document typically filed by a creditor (any person or 
business that is owed money or property by the estate) asking that they be given 
notice when a probate case is opened, when documents are filed into the case, and 
when orders are issued.  

o  Check with the court to see whether any demands for notice have been filed.  If any 

demands for notice have been filed, you must serve a Notice of Intent to File 
Document After Demand for Notice (PRO907) at least 14 days before filing the 
Petition with the court, and the demandants who submitted the forms must be 
listed as interested parties later in the Petition.

9.  Check all of the boxes that apply to describe the family situation of the person who died.  

 

 

o  Decedent left no surviving spouse: Check this box if the person who died was never 
married, was married but their spouse died first, or was divorced and was not 
remarried at the time they died.  

o  Decedent left no surviving issue: Check this box if the person who died did not have 
any living issue at the time they died. “Issue” means direct lineal descendants, such 
as children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc., whether by blood or by 
adoption.

Page 7 of 21 

o  All issue of Decedent are issue of Decedent’s surviving spouse: Check this box if the 
person who died never had children (by blood or adoption) with someone other 
than the spouse they were married to at the time they died, so that all children, 
grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc. of the person who died are also related to 
the surviving spouse.  

o  There are issue of Decedent that are not issue of the surviving spouse: Check this 

box if the person who died had children (by blood or adoption) with someone other 
than the spouse they were married to at the time they died, so that some of the 
children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc. of the person who died are not 
related to the surviving spouse.  

o  There are issue of the surviving spouse who are not issue of the Decedent: Check 
this box if the surviving spouse of the person who died ever had children (by blood 
or adoption) with someone other than the person who died, so that some of the 
children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc. of the surviving spouse are not 
related to the person who died.

10. For this question, you will need to gather information about all of the interested parties for 

the probate case. For each interested party, you will need the party’s: 

o  Full name 
o  Mailing address 
o  Relationship to the person who died 
o  Legal interest in the probate case 
o  Birth date (if the party is a minor) or date of death (if the party is deceased)  

Instructions – Petition for Determination of Descent 
PRO1401      State       ENG 

6/21                 www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 8 of 21 

List the spouse of the decedent first, if there is one. Repeat this for each interested party 
until all are listed.  

For the familial relationship and legal interest section, see pages 2 and 3 of these 
Instructions for definitions of devisee, heir, personal representative, and creditor. The 
“Other” section can be used to add relationships and interests that do not fit in the other 
boxes, including (but not limited to): 

o  Attorney General – If the person who died included any charities as devisees, the 

attorney general is considered an interested person that must be listed. 

o  Demandant – If any creditors have submitted a Demand for Notice, they are 

considered interested persons that must be listed.   

o  Fiduciary – If a person is a guardian, conservator, attorney-in-fact, trustee, or 

personal representative for one of the other interested persons, that fiduciary must 
be listed.   

o  Foreign Consulate – If the person who died or any of the heirs or devisees was born 
in a foreign country, the Consulate of that country is considered an interested 
person that must be listed.  

o  Parent of a minor interested person – If one of the interested persons is a minor, 

the parent of that person must be listed.  

If you are not sure whether to list a person or entity as an interested person, or you are not 
sure whether you have included all of the interested persons, it is a good idea to get some 
legal advice.

11. Check a box to say whether all of the people you listed as heirs in Question #10 lived at 

least 120 hours longer than the date the Decedent died. If any of the heirs died during that 
time, list that person’s name.

12. The answers you give to this question will create what is called a “negative allegation 

statement,” which specifically tells the court that there are no other heirs or devisees other 
than the ones listed in your Petition. Only check the boxes that apply to your situation.

(4) Check this box to say that if the person who died had any children that died 
before them, you have listed all of that deceased child’s children (grandchildren of 
the person who died that had the deceased child as a parent).

you did not check either of those boxes, continue to box (5).

siblings of the person who died because they had no living parents, but one 
or more of these siblings has died. Check this box to say that you have listed 
all of the descendants of any deceased siblings (these would be nieces, 
nephews, grandnieces, grandnephews, etc. of the Decedent).  

If you checked box (5), you do not need to continue with the rest of this question. If you did not 
check box (5), continue to box (6).  

 

 

o 

o 

(6) – Check this box to say that you have listed the grandparents (on both their 
mother’s side (maternal) and their father’s side (paternal)) of the person who died,

ecedent’s Property 

 

15. Before you can fill in the information on the chart on question #15, you need to fill out 

Attachments A and B. For now, skip to Attachment A: Real Estate.  

 

he Decedent’s property that is on hand for distribution will be described and valued in detail in 
Attachments A and B. When completing these attachments, all values should be reported as of the 
date of death.  

Do not list any non-probate property.  Non-probate property is any assets of the Decedent that can 
be transferred to a new owner without going through the probate process. For example:

•  Real property held as joint tenants with right of survivorship; 

•  Bank or brokerage accounts that are held jointly or with a payable-on-death beneficiary 

designation to a surviving person; 

• 

Investment or retirement accounts or insurance policies that have a designated beneficiary 
other than the person who died, provided that beneficiary survived the person who died; 

•  Property held in a trust.  

If you are not sure whether an asset would be considered a probate or non-probate asset, it is a 
good idea to talk to an attorney.  

 

Attachment A: Real Estate 

You must fill out “Attachment A” even if the Decedent did not own any real estate in Minnesota.  
Do not list real estate that is located outside Minnesota in Attachment A.

a.  In the Description of Property column, include the county, formal legal description, AND 

the street address of the homestead property.  If the property is 
rural, include the acreage as well. 

b.  List the County Assessor’s market value for the homestead 

property. You can get this information from the County Assessor’s 
Office in the county where the property is located. 

c.  List the fair market value for the homestead property. Fair market 
value is the amount that the property would sell for on the open 
market, and it may or may not be the same as the County 
Assessor’s market value. Another method for trying to figure out 
the fair market value would be to get an appraisal done for the 
property. If you are not sure how to calculate the fair market value, it is a good idea to 
talk to an attorney.  

Be sure to copy the full 
formal legal description 
exactly as it appears on 
the Deed, Contract for 
Deed, or Certificate of 
Title on file with the office 
of the County Recorder or 
Registrar of Titles in the 
county where the property 
is located. An online 
description or a tax 
statement may not contain 
the full legal description.

administration in the county where you are filing to see how they would like you to do this.

Step 2 

Sign the Petition for Determination of Descent (PRO1402) 

         

 

A.  Sign the Petition for Determination of Descent form. State your address, phone number, 

and e-mail address in the blanks under the signature line. When you sign the Petition, you 
are signing under penalty of perjury. This means you are saying that everything in the form 
is true and correct; if you know something in the form is not true when you sign it, you 
could be found guilty of the crime of perjury (see Minn. Stat. § 609.48, 
https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.48). 

B.  If you are an attorney representing the petitioner, check the attorney box and include your 

attorney license number, firm name and address, etc. 

Step 3 (Optional) 

Fill out the Statement of Contents of Lost, Destroyed, or Otherwise 
Unavailable Will (PRO1206) 

This form is only needed if the original, signed Will of the person who passed away is not available.  

Fill out the caption the same way you did for the Petition. 

The Statement

A.  Fill in your name as the Petitioner.   

 

1.  Fill in the date the original Will was signed, and check one of the boxes describing why the 
original Will is not available. If the original Will is not available for a reason other than 
being lost or destroyed, check the “other” box and explain what happened to the Will.  

2.  Check the first box if you are able to attach a copy of the Will to the Statement. Check the 
second box if you do not have a copy of the Will, but are able to describe what the Will 
said instead.  

Sign the form under penalty of perjury and fill in the blanks.   

The Signature Block 

 

Step 4 

Make a Copy of Completed Forms 

Make a copy of the Petition for Determination of Descent (PRO1402) and Statement of Contents of 
Lost, Destroyed, or Otherwise Unavailable Will (PRO1206) (if you completed this form) for your 
own records.  

Step 5 

File the Completed Forms with the Court 

File the following with the court: 

•  Petition for Determination of Descent (PRO1402);

•  The original Will, if available—if not, then the Statement of Contents of Lost, Destroyed, or 

Otherwise Unavailable Will (PRO1206); and 

•  The death certificate of the decedent and of any heirs or devisees that died before the 

decedent.  

There is a filing fee due when you file. You can make checks payable to “District Court 
Administrator.” See https://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Court-Fees.aspx.  

Step 6 

Mail and Publish Notice of the Hearing for Interested Parties  

If court administration finds that all of your documents are in order, they will schedule a hearing 
and issue you a copy of a Notice and Order for Hearing on Petition for Descent of Property.   

Make copies of the Notice form and mail one to each of the heirs, devisees, and all other 
interested parties you listed in the Petition. The Notice must be mailed no later than 14 days 
before the scheduled court hearing. Complete a separate Affidavit of Mailing (Petition for 
Determination of Descent) (PRO1402) for each party you mailed the Notice to and file the 
affidavits with the court.  

Publish the Notice and Order for Hearing on Petition for Determination of Descent once a week for 
two consecutive weeks in a legal newspaper in the county where the case was filed. The second 
publication must be at least ten days prior to the hearing. You will be responsible for paying the 
costs of publication. File the Affidavit of Publication given to you by the newspaper with the court. 

 

Step 7 

Fill out the Notice to Commissioner of Human Services Regarding 
Possible Claims (PRO905) and Mail a Copy to the Commissioner 

Complete the Notice to Commissioner of Human Services Regarding Possible Claims and make a copy 
of the document to keep for your own records. Send the following documents to the Commissioner: 

•  Notice to Commissioner of Human Services Regarding Possible Claims; and 

•  Copy of the Notice and Order for Hearing on Petition for Determination of Descent

6/21                 www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 19 of 21 

The address for mailing this notice is: Commissioner of Human Services, Attn: Special Recovery 
Unit/Estate Notice, P.O. Box 64995, St. Paul, MN 55164-0095.  

ou do not need to have someone else mail this notice to the 
Commissioner—you can be the one to mail it. After you have mailed the 
notice:  

You need to file the Affidavit 
of Service with the court, but 
NOT the Notice form. 

1.  Complete an Affidavit of Service of Notice to the Commissioner of 

Human Services Regarding Possible Claims (PRO903), and 

2.  File the Affidavit of Service with the court.   

o not file the Notice with the court (it is for the Commissioner of Human Services only). 

OTE: If real estate is involved, for certain real estate transactions, you may have to take 

additional steps with the county recorder’s office in the county where the real estate is located.  
Court staff cannot answer questions about real estate transactions.  If you have any questions, talk 
to an attorney.  

ALSO NOTE: You will need to get a signed Clearance Certificate for Medical Assistance Claims from 
your county agency and file this clearance with the court. For a list of county agency contacts, see 
the MN Department of Human Services website at 
https://edocs.dhs.state.mn.us/lfserver/Public/DHS-7842-ENG. You can find the application form 
for a clearance certificate (DHS6165A) at https://edocs.dhs.state.mn.us/lfserver/Public/DHS-
6165A-ENG.

Step 8 

Attend the Court Hearing 

It is generally the best practice to file your Affidavits of Mailing, the Affidavit of Publication, and 
the Clearance Certificate for Medical Assistance Claims before the scheduled hearing. 

You must appear at the scheduled hearing and: 

•  be ready to talk about the information included in your petition, including whether there is 

a Medical Assistance claim; and 

•  bring a copy of each of the forms you filed as part of Step 7 (above). 

Instructions – Petition for Determination of Descent

Page 20 of 21 

       

       

You will receive a Decree of Descent after you have filed documents discussed at the hearing, 
including a Clearance Certificate for Medical Assistance Claims.   

Step 10 

Get Certified Copies of the Decree of Descent 

After the Decree of Descent has been issued by the judge, you can get certified copies from court 
administration. There will be a charge for each certified copy (see http://mncourts.gov/Help-
Topics/Court-Fees/District-Court-Fees.aspx?cat=probate&cookieCheck=true).   

Certified copies of the Decree of Descent may be needed for certain tasks, including but not limited 
to: 

•  presentation to banks and other financial institutions to close the accounts of the person 

who died; 

• 

transferring title to estate real estate; 

•  presentation to the Department of Motor Vehicles to transfer title to a vehicle.
