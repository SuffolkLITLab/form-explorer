General Information  

he information contained in this document is not intended as legal advice but as a general guide to you 
to explain the legal process.  If you do not understand these procedures, talk to an attorney.  Court staff 
cannot give legal advice. 

A generic motion is a way to ask the court to do something within a family  case that is already open.  In very 
simple terms, the motion is where you state what you want the court to order.  Along with every motion, you 
need an affidavit.  The affidavit is where you state why the court should give you what you have asked for. 

You may be able to use this packet IF: 

•  A family case has already started and you have a Court File Number; 
•  You want to ask the court to do something within the case; 
•  The court does not publish a specific form for the request you want to make; and 
•  You want to have a hearing on your request.   

IMPORTANT:  It  is  strongly  recommended  that  you  get  legal  advice.  The  court  publishes  forms  for  most 
common requests that are made in Family Court, such as change of custody, parenting time assistance, and 
modification of child support.  This form should not be used if a more specific form fits your situation.  If you 
do not know whether to use this form, you should get legal advice.  If you use this form and do not know what 
you should write in your motion, want the motion reviewed by an attorney, or do not already have a family 
case open, you should get legal advice.  

Step 1 

Fill Out Notice of Motion and Motion (FAM602) 

he Caption 

ill out the top part of the Notice of Motion and Motion (this is called “the case caption”):

You will find the information you need to fill out the caption on a court document from your existing 
family case.  If you do not have any documents from your court file, and if you do not know the 
information, you will need to look in your court file. 

•  Some limited case records can be viewed online at www.mncourts.gov/publicaccess. 
• 

If you cannot view your case online, you may need to contact the court to request a copy or 
go to a courthouse to view your court file. 

A.  Write the name of the county where the case is located. 

B.  Write the Judicial District.  Fill in your court file number (for example, 27-FA-20-0001). 

C.  Write the petitioner’s full name on the petitioner line just as it appears on your court 

documents.  The person who was the petitioner when the case started will always be the 
petitioner. 

D.  Write the respondent’s full name on the respondent line just as it appears on your court 

documents.  The person who was the respondent when the case started will always be the 
respondent. 

NOTE: If a party’s name has changed since the case first started, you can write the name as it 
appears in the court record, then write “NKA,” which stands for “now known as,” and then write the 
party’s current name.  For example: Jane Reneé Doe, NKA Jane Reneé Smith.

E.  After the word “TO:” write the full name and address of each party (do not include yourself 

here).   

F.  Leave this section blank for now.  You will fill in this section when you get to Step 3 (below).

information below your signature. 
 

Step 2 

Fill out the Affidavit in Support of Motion (FAM603) 

he Caption 

Fill out the caption the same way you did for the Motion. 

he Statement of Facts 

In the Affidavit in Support of Motion, you are supposed to write down facts that support the requests 
you made in your motion.  This is where you explain why you are asking the court to do the things you 
asked for in the Notice of Motion and Motion.

1.  Write your full name. 
2.  Write down the information you want the court to know.  This section is your “statement of 

facts.”  If you run out of room, add more paper.  Do not write on the back of the page or in the 
margins. 

If you want to include an attachment that supports a statement you make, it is good practice to label 
your attachment something like “Attachment A.” or “Attachment 1.”  Then, next to the statement in 
your Affidavit that talks about the attachment, you can write something like “See Attachment A” or “See 
Attachment 1.”  For example: “I pay $600 per month in child care costs.”  See Attachment 1.”  And 
Attachment 1 would be the child care bill.  If you have many attachments, you may want to include the 
form called List of Supporting Documents (FAM903) 
(https://www.mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=18&p=127).

If you add attachments to support a statement you make, be sure to add page numbers to the 
attachments so that they are easy to refer to. 

NOTE! Most documents filed with the court are considered public documents and are available to the 
public.  Certain information that is filed with the court may be considered confidential based on court 
rule and not available to the public.  To keep this information confidential and not available to the 
public, you must take certain steps that are described below. 

The steps listed below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  Filers who are using eFS to submit 
their court documents must identify and designate their filings as required in Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 11.02 
and 14.06. 

Confidential Information Form 11.1 

All social security numbers, employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers (also called 
“restricted identifiers”) must not be listed on papers you file with the court. This is to protect your 
privacy, the other parties and your children.   Only provide social security numbers, employer 
identification numbers, and financial account numbers when the court requires this information to be 
provided to the court.  For example, if you must provide the court with bank account numbers, or 
medical account numbers, do not include any account number in your document (your motion, 
supporting affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you must use Form 11.1 to list these confidential numbers.  

If account numbers are not required to be provided to the court, and the numbers appear on 
documents that are considered available to the public, (such as medical invoices or credit account 
numbers on statements) you must remove the number on the document before filing the document 
with the court. 

Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-public 
documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the time you file the 
documents with the court.  You must complete and file the “Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 
11.2 (also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public documents.  The most common non-
public documents are called “financial source documents.”  Examples of financial source documents 
include: 

•  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and business expenses 
•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers   

You may also need to submit other documents that court rules identify as non-public documents, such 
as a medical record.  For example, a report from a doctor that provides a medical diagnosis or treatment 
plan for you or your child would qualify as a medical record.   

You must use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing other non-public documents, such as medical 
records, with the court.  One Form 11.2 cover sheet can be used for submitting all non-public 
documents.

The failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being rejected by court 
administration, being available to the public, stricken from the court record, and sanctions 
from the court. 

See Rule 11 of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice for more information about how to file documents 
containing social security numbers, financial account numbers, “financial source documents” and other 
non-public documents.   

Form 11.1 and Form 11.2 can be found at www.mncourts.gov/forms under the court forms category of 
“Confidential Information” and is court form number CON111 and CON112. 

he Signature Block  

When you sign your Affidavit in Support of Motion, you are signing under penalty of perjury.  Perjury is 
the crime of intentionally lying or misrepresenting the truth.  By signing under penalty of perjury, you 
are stating that the information in your Affidavit is true to the best of your knowledge.   

Date and sign the Affidavit.  Write the names of the county and state you are in when you signed it, and 
write your personal contact information below your signature.  
 

Step 3 

Contact Court Administration About a Hearing Date 

n some districts, you need to schedule the hearing before you serve and file your motion.  In other 
districts, you get a hearing date after you have filed.  It is important that you check with your local court 
administration to see how to schedule a hearing for your motion.  You can find court contact 
information at https://www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx .  If you do not schedule a hearing, the 
court will not do anything with your motion. 

f you are able to schedule a hearing date right away: 

•  Go back to the “Notice” section (The Notice) on the first page of your Notice of Motion and 

Motion.  Write the hearing information in the boxes (hearing date, time, location, and name of 
judicial officer). 

f your district schedules the hearing after you file:  

•  Write “To Be Determined” on the date line of the “Notice” section of your Notice of Motion and 
Motion.  Note: be sure to fill in the name, address, and telephone number of the courthouse. 

f you filed your Notice of Motion and Motion and Affidavit in Support of Motion without a hearing date, 
then you need to use the Notice of Hearing form (CIV604) 
(https://www.mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=7&f=515) to let the other party know when the hearing 
date is scheduled.

1.  Fill out the caption like you did for the Notice of Motion and Motion. 

2.  After the word “TO,” write the name and address of each party except yourself. 

3.  Fill in the details of the hearing (date, time, location, name of judicial officer). 

4.  Fill in the date that you filed the original Notice of Motion and Motion.  If you do not remember

6.  Make one copy of this Notice of Hearing form for each party (including for yourself).

Notice of Motion and Motion.  See Steps 5 and 6 below. 

8.  File the original Notice of Hearing form and one Affidavit of Service form (for each party other 

than yourself) with court administration. 

Step 4 

Make Copies 

  
You will need to make one copy of the Notice of Motion and the Affidavit in Support of Motion (plus the 
Notice of Hearing form (CIV604) if you used it, and any attachments) for each party, including yourself.  
Be sure to bring your copy with you to court when you go to the hearing. 
 

Step 5 

Serve Notice on the Other Party 

verview 

he other party must receive notice of the hearing and copies of all documents you have 
prepared for the hearing.  This is called "service of process."  The papers can be served 
personally (handed to the other party), or by mail.  The other party must receive the 
papers at least 21 days before the hearing.  If the papers are served by mail, court rules 
require adding three days, so the papers must be postmarked at least 24 days before 
the hearing.   

If the other party is 
represented by an 
attorney, serve the other 
party’s attorney instead of 
the party directly. 

apers CANNOT be served on legal holidays as defined in Minn. Stat. § 645.44 

(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44#stat.645.44.5).

Who Can Serve  
If your hearing is in front of a judge or referee, the forms you have prepared can be served by any of the 
following: 

•  The sheriff; 
•  Another adult; or 
•  You. 
 
Except: 

If your hearing is in front of a child support magistrate, you cannot serve the forms yourself.  
You must have another adult who is not involved in the case, or a sheriff or professional process 
server, serve the forms on the other party or parties. 

Personal Service 
At least 21 days before the hearing date, the server hands to the other party one copy of the 
completed Notice of Motion and Motion, one copy of the Affidavit in Support of Motion, and one copy 
of all attachments (example: if the hearing date is January 30, the papers must be served on or before 
January 9.  If January 9 is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, keep counting backwards to the next day 
that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday to determine the service deadline). 

Service by Mail 
The server places one copy of the completed Notice of Motion and Motion form, one copy of the 
Affidavit in Support of Motion, and one copy of all attachments in an envelope.  

The server must mail the envelope containing the forms to the other party by first class U.S. mail at least 
24 days before the hearing date (example: if the hearing is January 30, the papers must be postmarked 
no later than January 6.  If January 6 is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, keep counting backwards to 
the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday to determine the service deadline). 

Warning: If your forms are not personally served on the other party at least 21 days before the 
hearing OR mailed to the other party at least 24 days before the hearing date, your Motion may NOT 
be heard by the court.  If there is more than one Petitioner or more than one Respondent, please note 
that ALL of the other parties must be served.

You will need to file the following forms with Court Administration at least 21 days before the hearing: 

•  Original Notice of Motion and Motion; 
•  Original Affidavit in Support of Motion (including any attachments); and 
•  Original Affidavit of Personal Service or Affidavit of Service by Mail (one Affidavit of Service for 

each party other than yourself). 

here will be a motion fee due when you file your paperwork.  You can find court filing fee information 
at https://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Court-Fees/District-Court-Fees.aspx.  You can make checks payable 
to “District Court Administrator.” 

If you cannot afford to pay the motion fee, you can ask for a fee waiver by completing the forms in the 
In Forma Pauperis/IFP packet (http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=19&p=69).   If a judge does not 
sign the fee waiver order, then you must pay the motion fee before court administration can process 
your forms.

Step 8 

Certificate of Settlement Efforts 

See “Family Court Motions – Settlement Rule & Form” Help Topic online at https://mncourts.gov/Help-
Topics/Family-Court-Motions.aspx.  

hen filing this type of motion in District Court, you must contact the other party or their attorney to 

initiate a settlement conference, complete a Certificate of Settlement Efforts form 
(https://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=18&f=286) and file it with the Court.  

ithin 7 days of filing your motion, contact the other party in person, by telephone, or in writing to 
attempt to resolve the issues raised in your motion. If you do not reach an agreement, the Certificate of 
Settlement Efforts shows the Court that you tried to solve the issue outside of court and lets you explain 
why your attempts to come to a settlement agreement were unsuccessful.  The Certificate of Settlement 
Efforts can be e-filed or mailed to the address below at least 24 hours before your hearing. 
 

Step 9 

Attend Your Hearing 

o prepare for your hearing, it is a good idea to look at the court rules that apply to family and civil 
cases.  You can find links to these rules online at https://mncourts.gov/SupremeCourt/Court-Rules.aspx. 
You could also visit a law library to read the court rules (https://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Law-
Libraries.aspx). 

ou must go to court (or appear online, if the hearing is held remotely) on the date set for the hearing.  
It is important to be on time.  If you are even a few minutes late, the judicial officer may dismiss your 
motion. 

ring your copies of the paperwork with you to the hearing.  If the other party has served you with a 
responsive motion, be prepared to talk about your response to their responsive motion at the hearing.  
If you are unsure how to prepare for the hearing, or what evidence you should bring, you should get 
legal advice before your court date (https://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx).

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
