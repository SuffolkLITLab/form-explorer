Sign and date the Affidavit form, and print your contact information in the blanks under the 
signature line.  When you sign the Affidavit, you are signing under penalty of perjury.  This means 
you are saying that everything in the form is true and correct; if you know something in the form is 
not true when you sign it, you could be found guilty of the crime of perjury (see Minn. Stat.  
§ 609.48,  https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.48).  

f you are not using the eFS System to serve and file papers in your case, then you will  need to make 
one copy of the Motion and Affidavit for each party (including yourself). 

Step 3 
Make Copies 

Step 4 
Serve the Other Parties 

he other party (parties) must receive complete copies of all documents you have prepared. This is 
called "service of process." The papers can be served personally (handed to the other party), or by 
mail. Papers cannot be served on a legal holiday (as defined in Minn. Stat. § 645.44,  subd. 5, 
https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44#stat.645.44.5).   

The method of service depends on whether you are filing these papers in the expedited child 
support process or in district  court. 

You will use one of the methods of service for the Expedited Child Support Process if: 

   

•  The action is for child support only, AND 
•  A case participant is receiving IV-D services from the county. 

You will use one of the methods of service for District Court if: 

If the action involves child custody and/or parenting time, AND 

• 
•  A case participant is receiving IV-D services from the county. 

 

Expedited Child Support Process Methods of Service

the truth, punishable by jail or other sanctions.

and 

Will there be a filing fee? 

A party will need to pay a motion fee.  If this is the first document the party is filing in the case, then 
a party will  have to pay a filing  fee as well.  You can contact court administration  to find out how 
much the filing and motion fees are, or you can look online.  No fees are collected from the public 
authority or a federally recognized Indian Tribe or its representative. 

•  Find court administration  contact information online at https://mncourts.gov/Find-

Courts.aspx. 

•  Look online for filing fee information at https://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Court-Fees.aspx.  

What if I can’t afford the filing fee? 

If you cannot afford to pay the fee, you may qualify to have the fee waived by the court. You need 
to fill  out an In Forma Pauperis (IFP), or fee waiver, application  and file it with court administration. 
Your application  will be reviewed by a judge who will decide whether you must pay the fee. If the 
judge does not sign an order that waives the fee, you must be prepared to pay the fee.  For more 
information and links to the fee waiver forms, see https://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Fee-Waiver-
IFP.aspx.
