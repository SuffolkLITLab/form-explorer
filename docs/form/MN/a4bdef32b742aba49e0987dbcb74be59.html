General Information About Formal Probate 

isit the Probate, Wills, and Estates Help Topic (http://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Probate-Wills-
and-Estates.aspx) for more detailed information about probate, the difference between informal 
and formal probate, and read some Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about the process. 

If you are not sure what type of probate you need to file, or if you need to file at all, you should 
talk with an attorney. The information in these Instructions is not meant to be legal advice, but is 
a general guide to explain the legal process and steps for filing a Petition for Formal Probate.  

f you do not understand any of these procedures, talk to an attorney. Court staff cannot give 
legal advice.   

Do I need to go through probate? 

Generally, filing a probate case with the court is not necessary if the person who died:  

•  Did not own any real estate in their name alone, and 

•  Owned personal property in their name alone with a total value less than $75,000. 

If you do not need to go through probate, you may be able to collect personal property (such as 
money in a bank account) or transfer title to motor vehicles owned by the person who died using 
an Affidavit for Collection of Personal Property. Visit 
http://www.mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=31&p=88 for more information about this process.  

efinitions you may find helpful as you complete the forms: 

•  Codicil – A legal document that is used to make changes to an existing Will. Generally, 

codicils add to or supplement a Will rather than replace a Will. 

•  Creditor – Any person or business that has a financial claim against (is owed money by) the 

estate. 

•  Decedent – The person who has died.  

•  Demandant – A person who demands that they receive notice in a probate proceeding by 

filing a document called a "Demand for Notice" with the court.  

•  Descendant or Issue – A blood or legally adopted relative directly descended from a 

person, including children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc.

to the Will.  

3. Other people who are entitled to receive property under the Will.

according to the Will or there is not a Will.

passed since the time of death and no probate case has already been

someone else to serve in their place or may waive their right to nominate 
someone to serve in their place. To do this, use the Renunciation of Priority for

appointment or joined in nominating someone else. If someone else has been nominated, 
write in that person’s name. Be sure to include the nomination or renunciation form 
(PRO901) with your paperwork.

grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc. of the surviving spouse are not related to the 
person who died.

  F

or the familial relationship and legal interest section, see the first few pages of these 
Instructions for definitions of heir, personal representative, and creditor. The “Other” 
section can be used to add relationships and interests that do not fit in the other boxes, 
including (but not limited to): 

o  Attorney General – If the person who died left no spouse and no heirs, the 
attorney general is considered an interested person that must be listed. 
o  Demandant – If any creditors have submitted a Demand for Notice, they are 

considered interested persons that must be listed.   

o  Fiduciary – If a person is a guardian, conservator, attorney-in-fact, trustee, or 
personal representative for one of the other interested persons, that fiduciary 
must be listed.

7. Check a box to say whether all of the people you listed as heirs in Question #18 lived at least 
120 hours longer than the date the Decedent died. If any of the heirs died during that time, 
list that person’s name.  

18. The answers you give to this question will create what is called a “negative allegation 

statement,” which specifically tells the court that there are no heirs other than the ones

question. If you did not check either of those boxes, continue to box (4).  

 
(4) – Check this box to say that you have listed the parents of the person who 
died if the person who died had no descendants (blood relatives directly 
descended from them, including children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, 
etc.)

that you have listed all of the siblings of the person who died instead. 
(4)(b) – This box is used if you checked (5)(a) to say that you listed all of 
the siblings of the person who died because they had no living parents, 
but one or more of these siblings has died. Check this box to say that you 
have listed all of the descendants of any deceased siblings (these would 
be nieces, nephews, grandnieces, grandnephews, etc. of the Decedent).

representative, along with the bond amount (if any). Check a box to say whether you would 
like a judge to supervise the administration of the estate or not.  

 

o  Unsupervised administration does not require court approval of every action 

taken by the personal representative, who has the authority to distribute estate 
assets without a court order.  

o 

In a supervised administration, the court directly supervises the personal 
representative’s actions and a court order is needed to distribute probate assets.  

o  You can request a certain amount of bond or to have either a supervised or 

unsupervised administration, but ultimately this decision will be up to the judge.  

f you are not sure whether to request a bond or how to choose between supervised and 
unsupervised administration of the estate, you should talk with an attorney.

Heirs, and Appointment of Personal Representative (PRO1102)

of Personal Representative form. State your address, phone number, and e-mail address in the 
blanks under the signature line. When you sign the Petition, you are signing under penalty of 
perjury. This means you are saying that everything in the form is true and correct; if you know 
something in the form is not true when you sign it, you could be found guilty of the crime of 
perjury (see Minn. Stat. § 609.48, https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.48).

t is generally the best practice to file your Affidavits of Mailing and the Affidavit of Publication 
before the scheduled hearing. 

ou must appear at the scheduled hearing and: 

•  be ready to talk about the information included in your petition; and 
•  bring a copy of each of the forms you filed as part of Step 6 (above). 

Step 10 

Attend the Court Hearing 

Step 11  

After the Hearing 

f the judge ordered a bond, the Letters will not be issued until the required bond is filed. If a 
bond is required, you will need to contact a bond company to have one issued. The court 
cannot recommend a specific bond company.  

ou will receive an Order for Formal Adjudication of Intestacy, Determination of Heirs, and 
Appointment of Personal Representative and Letters of General Administration after you have 
filed documents discussed at the hearing, if any.   
 

Step 12 

Get Certified Copies of the Letters of General Administration 

fter the Letters of General Administration (the document that gives the personal 

representative the authority to handle the administration of the estate) have been issued by 
the judge, you can get certified copies from court administration. There will be a charge for 
each certified copy (see http://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Court-Fees/District-Court-
Fees.aspx?cat=probate&cookieCheck=true).   

ertified copies of the Letters of General Administration may be needed for certain tasks, 

including but not limited to:

Step 13 

Administer and Close the Estate 

•  presentation to banks and other financial institutions to close the accounts of the 

person who died or to open an estate bank account, if necessary; 
transferring title to estate real estate; 

• 
•  presentation to the Department of Motor Vehicles to transfer title to a vehicle. 

fter you have been appointed as the personal representative by the Letters of General 

Administration, you will need to administer the estate of the person who died. Administering 
the estate includes, but is not limited to: 

•  Collection, inventory, and appraisal of assets.  
•  Paying the taxes and debts of the person who died.  
•  Distributing remaining assets to the proper parties as specified by law.  
•  Preparing an Inventory (PRO912) and Final Account (PRO913) and closing the estate.  
 

The estate cannot be closed until it has been at least four months from the date the Notice to 
Creditors was published. If you have questions about how to administer and close the estate, it is 
a good idea to talk to an attorney.
