agreement on services to be provided by the tenant.  

Is your situation different? The Eviction Action Complaint form was created for use in the 
typical situation where a tenant agrees to pay rent each month to landlord.  An eviction can 
also be filed if there is an agreement for an exchange of services instead of rent, or if unlawful 
activities are occurring at the property that are covered in Minn. Stat. § 504B.171 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/504B.171). If this is not your situation, talk with an 
attorney for advice on what steps you may take to evict someone.

his section only applies to residential property only (not commercial leases) where there is an 

agreement to pay rent. You cannot file an eviction unless A and B are true, or C is true.   
See Minn. Stat. § 504B.181, subd. 4 (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/504B.181).  If 
you have not given the tenant the required information at this point, speak with an attorney for 
legal advice.  

11.   Before the tenant moves in and pays rent, the landlord must give the tenant certain 

information in writing AND must post the information on the property. Read Paragraphs 
3 (a) and (b). If both are true, check both boxes and fill in the line at (b) explaining where 
the information was posted.

•  State which months are unpaid (such as Jan, Feb). 
•  State the amount of rent that is unpaid per month (such as $500 for Jan, and $900 for Feb).   
•  Fill in the day of the month when rental payments are due. 
•  Fill in the total rent owed at the time the Complaint is signed. 

NOTE: Tenant may be able to redeem or “pay and stay” if the only reason for filing the eviction 
action is nonpayment of rent, and they bring to the court hearing the amount of rent that is past 
due (plus interest), the costs of the court action, and an attorney’s fee (not greater than $5), and 
performs any other agreements of the lease.  

f the rent is paid by the day of court, the Judge can give the tenant up to 7 more days to pay the 
other costs. See Minn. Stat. § 504B.291, subd. 1 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/504B.291).  For purposes of “pay and stay” court costs 
include only the court filing fee and reasonable service of process fees. Court costs do not include 
management fees, or fees paid to an agent.  If the total amount due on the Complaint includes 
utilities or late fees, the Judge will decide if these amounts must be paid by the tenant to “pay and 
stay.”  

4. Check box B if tenant failed to move out (vacate) after notice was given. 

•  Landlord gave notice to Tenant - Check the first box if the landlord asked the tenant to 
move out. First write in the date you gave the notice to the tenant and then write in the 
date they were to move out of the property.   

•  Tenant gave notice to Landlord – Check the second box if the tenant gave notice that they 
would be moving out. First write in the date notice was given and then write in the date 
they were to move out of the property.   

NOTE:  If landlord asked tenant to move, a copy of the letter telling tenant to move out should 
be attached to the Complaint.   

Common Problems with evictions for failure to move out : 
 
Improper Notice to Vacate: In general, a full rental period’s notice must be given.  

If you have a written lease, read the lease to see if some other notice period is required.  
If the property was foreclosed, other notice periods may apply. An eviction case may be 
dismissed for improper service. Speak with an attorney for legal advice if this was not 
done.  
Example 1: If rent is due on the 1st of the month and you want the tenant to move out by 
March 1, you must deliver the notice to vacate on or before January 31. 

xample 2:  If you give the tenant a notice to vacate letter on April 10, the earliest date 
the notice can tell the tenant to leave is May 31, so you have given notice of a full rental 
period (the month of May) 

iling the Eviction Action Complaint before the vacate date: If tenant was asked to 
move out by January 1, do not file the Complaint until after January 1, even if the court

date will be after January 1.  The tenant must be in violation of the request to move out 
at the time you file the Complaint. If the tenant tells the landlord they do not plan to 
move out by January 1, landlord still must wait until after January 1 to file the 
Complaint. 

aiting to File if tenant fails to pay rent: Generally, if the tenant gives or is given a 

notice to move out, the tenant must still pay rent through the move-out date. An 
exception to this rule is if the lease allows tenant to apply a damage deposit as the last 
month’s rent, or a specific law allows it, such as with mortgage foreclosures. If the 
tenant must pay the last month’s rent and does not pay by the due date, landlord can file 
an eviction case for non-payment of rent. Landlord does not have to wait until tenant 
fails to move out per the Notice to Vacate. Failure to pay rent creates a separate reason 
to file for eviction. 

15.  Check box C if tenant violated the rental agreement (for something other than not 
paying rent.) 

•  Describe the dates and specific details of how the tenant broke the terms of the rental 

agreement.  The breach of lease should be material, meaning something that is 
significant.  

• 

If the agreement was for an exchange of services and tenant did not perform those 
services as part of the agreement, explain in detail what was not done.  

 NOTE:  A copy of the lease should be attached to the Complaint. Be sure to read Minn. 
Stat. § 504B.115 (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/504B.115) to see if you are 
required to give the tenant a copy of the written lease before filing an eviction action.  

  W

 

16.  Check box D if the tenant has violated Minn. Stat. § 504B.171 (drugs, prostitution, 
guns, stolen property at the rental property)  
•  Be sure to read Minn. Stat. § 504B.171 

(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/504B.171) before deciding if this ground for 
eviction applies to your situation. You must be detailed about the alleged unlawful 
activities. Attach a copy of any police report(s) to the Complaint. 
 

17. Check box E if the tenant defaulted on the mortgage and the property has been sold at a 
Sheriff’s sale.  

•  This should only be done if the redemption period has expired and Plaintiff has right to 

possession. Read Minn. Stat. § 504B.285, subd. 1(a) 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/504B.285) for more information and 
requirements. If you are not sure if this applies to your situation, talk with an attorney for 
legal advice.  
 

18 . Check Box F if Contract for Deed was cancelled and the tenant is still living in property.  

•  Please read Minn. Stat. § 504B.285, subd. 1(b) 

(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/504B.285) to be sure you have followed all of

do not know whether they are in the military service, check “unknown.” If a tenant is in 
the military, special laws may apply. Talk with an attorney for legal advice before signing 
the Complaint.  If a tenant is a business, leave this section blank for that tenant. 

  

Step 2  
Sign the Eviction Action Complaint 
 

1.  Sign the Complaint under penalty of perjury.  By signing the Complaint under penalty of 
perjury, you are stating that the information in the document is true to the best of your

zip, daytime phone number, and e-mail address.  E-mail addresses are required if 
documents are served or filed using electronic means.

appear in court with the owner or owner’s agent.  There is an exception in filing in Hennepin 
County Housing Court. You can read the Housing Court Rules online

you can use Form IFP102 and IFP104 to ask that a judge waive the fee.  

Court administration cannot accept your Complaint for filing without the fee or a request to 
waive the fee. If the filling fee is not waived you are then required to pay the fee before the 
Court can take any action.  

Interpreter Needed? If you need an interpreter at the hearing, tell court administration when 
you file. If you think your tenant needs an interpreter, consider asking the tenant to call court 
administration. Generally, 48 hours (2 full days) notice is needed, not including weekends and 
holidays, to schedule an interpreter. Less notice may cause a delay or a rescheduling of the 
hearing. 

The Court will create a Summons.  A Summons is a written notice telling the tenant that a legal 
action has been filed and will be heard in court on a certain day.  It also states that if the tenant 
disagrees with the action or wants to tell a different side of the story, they must appear in court at 
the time of the hearing. 

You will need a copy of the Summons for each tenant.

•  You (the plaintiff) cannot be the person who serves the Summons and Complaint. If you 

gave Power of Authority to an agent, do not ask the agent to serve the papers. It is best not to 
ask the building manager to serve papers. Use a neutral person who is over the age of 18, or 
pay a service of process agency or the Sheriff to serve the papers.  

•  Service of the Summons and Complaint must be completed at least 7 days before the 
hearing date. Example: If court is on Friday, the last day to serve is Friday of the week 
before. 

•  A Summons and Complaint cannot be served on a legal holiday. 

•  Each named tenant must be served.   Example: if there are 3 tenants, each tenant must be 

served with a separate copy of the Summons and Complaint.  If there is a husband and wife 
and 2 children, the husband and wife must each be served with a separate copy of the 
Summons and Complaint.  Minor children should not be named as defendants or served. 

•  A separate Affidavit of Service for each tenant must be filed with the Court at least 3 days 

before the court hearing (when counting the 3 days, don’t count Saturdays, Sundays, or legal 
holidays). There is more information about the Affidavit of Service below. 

• 

If Section 8 is involved, the contract between the landlord and the Housing Authority may 
require the landlord to serve a copy of the Summons and Complaint on the Housing Authority 
at the same time the papers are served on each tenant. 

Personal 
Service: 

 

An adult who is not involved with the case may act 
as  the  server  and  may  hand  the  Summons  and 
Complaint directly to the tenant at least seven days 
before the court date.  

PERSONAL 
SERVICE OF 
THE SUMMONS 
& COMPLAINT 

Substitute 
Service: 

 

An  adult  who  is  not  involved  with  the  case  may 
“serve” the Summons and Complaint by leaving a 
copy  of  the  documents  with  a  responsible  person 
who  lives  with  the  tenant.    This  person  is  then 
responsible  for  delivering 
the  Summons  and 
Complaint  to  the  tenant.  Example:  Joe  and  John 
are adult roommates. If only Joe is home, the server 
can leave 2 copies of the Summons and Complaint 
with Joe, one for Joe and one for John.  

he server fills out one Affidavit of Service for each tenant. The server must sign the Affidavit of 

Service under penalty of perjury.  Perjury is the crime of intentionally lying or misrepresenting 
the truth.  The Affidavits of Service are your proof that you had the tenant served.  File the

completed Affidavits with the court at least 3 days before the hearing (not counting 
Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays). 

It is always best if the tenant is personally served with the Summons and Complaint.  
However, if you cannot find the tenant, you may be able to have the tenant served in another way 
called mailing and posting. 

MAILING AND 
POSTING of the 
SUMMONS & 
COMPLAINT 

Use this 
method of 
service 
when:  

1.  Tenants cannot be found in the county AND 

2.  Personal or substitute service has been tried at 
least twice on different days with at least one of the 
attempts at service made between 6 and 10 p.m. 

 

If the property is commercial instead of residential, 
the attempts to serve are not required. Instead, there 
must be proof that the commercial property is not 
occupied. 

See the form Instructions – Service by Mail and Post (HOU107) for instructions on using this form 
of service. 

Step 6 
Go to the Hearing 

he plaintiff, the plaintiff’s attorney, or the plaintiff’s agent with power of authority (in 

Hennepin County only), must attend the hearing.  

If the plaintiff is a business, the plaintiff must have an attorney in court. There is one exception 
to this rule.  In Hennepin County, an officer or agent with power of authority may appear and 
represent the corporation without a lawyer in Housing Court. If a decision is appealed to a judge 
or appellate court, however, then an attorney will be required.  

Many eviction cases settle at court. The landlord and tenant should try to work out an 
agreement. In some counties, if a trial with witnesses and evidence is needed, the trial will be 
scheduled for a separate date. In other counties, you may be expected to have your witnesses 
ready at the first hearing date.  For more information about what to expect at an eviction 
hearing, contact court administration for the county where you are filing, and/or look at the 
court’s website at http://www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx  and then pick your 
district/county.

Other Information 

Requesting an 
Interpreter 

If you need interpreter services for the hearing, call court 
administration right away.  The court generally needs 48 hours 
notice (2 full days), excluding weekends and holidays, to provide an 
interpreter. 

Expedited Hearing 

Collecting the Rent 

Eviction Notice (Writ 
of Recovery of 
Premises and Order 
to Vacate) 

If tenant’s behavior is seriously endangering the property or safety 
of other residents or the owner, landlord can request that the 
eviction court date be scheduled within 5 to 7 days, rather than 7 to 
14 days. An additional affidavit is required, and a judicial officer 
must pre-approve the request before court administration sets the 
date. A landlord can be fined up to $500 for abuse of the expedited 
hearing process.  See Minn. Stat. § 504B.321, subd. 2 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/504B.321).  

An eviction action decides if the tenant must move. It does not 
include a judgment for rent or other money owed. 

Claims for rent and other money issues cannot be brought in 
housing court with the eviction complaint and must be brought 
separately in either conciliation court or district court.  Claims that 
are less than $15,000 can be brought in Conciliation Court.  

Claims over $15,000 must be filed in District Court. 

A “Writ of Recovery of Premises and Order to Vacate” is a legal 
notice ordering the tenant to move and authorizing the sheriff to 
take certain actions if the tenant does not move voluntarily. It is 
issued by the court if the landlord wins an eviction action in court, 
the landlord asks for the Writ, and pays a Writ fee.  

Landlord takes the Writ to the sheriff.  If the sheriff cannot find the 
tenants to serve the Writ, the sheriff may post it in a noticeable place 
at the property.  

The Tenant has 24 hours to remove all property and turn in keys. If 
the Tenant ignores the notice, Landlord may contact the sheriff to 
schedule a “move out” time.  

For more information, read Minn. Stat. § 504B.365 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/504B.365), Unlawful 
exclusion or removal; action for recovery of possession.
