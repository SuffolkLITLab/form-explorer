Resources and General Information about Forfeiture 

Forfeiture is the process that a state agency uses to seize (take) property from an owner after someone is 
arrested, charged, or convicted of a specific crime. Forfeiture of property is a civil issue that is separate from 
any criminal charges that may have been filed against someone. You can read more about forfeitures in the 
“Forfeiture and Impoundment” Help Topic online at http://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Forfeiture-and-
Impoundment.aspx.  

You will find information about asking the court to return the vehicle that was taken after an alcohol-
related offense in Minn. Stat. § 169A.63, subd. 8(e) (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/169A.63).  
You may file an action in district court for recovery of the seized vehicle.  

•  Form FOR202 is the form used when filing an action in district court to recover a vehicle forfeited 

for alcohol-related offenses. 

•  Form FOR402 is used for controlled substances cases. 

If the value of your vehicle is $15,000 or less, you may choose to file your action in Conciliation Court. The 
forms and instructions to bring a forfeiture action in Conciliation Court are available online at 
https://www.mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=20&p=72.  

The Court has forms and instructions, for some types of cases, as a general guide to the court process. 
These instructions explain the steps in more detail and answer common questions, but are not a full 
guide to the law. Court employees may be able to give general information on court rules and 
procedures, but they cannot give legal advice. For a list of legal resources visit www.MNCourts.gov/Find-
a-Lawyer.aspx.  

Innocent Owner 

If you are the owner of a motor vehicle that was seized while someone else was driving, you may be able 
to ask the prosecuting authority to return the vehicle to you without having to file paperwork with the 
court.   

Any person (other than the defendant driver alleged to have committed the offense) may bring an 
innocent owner claim by notifying the prosecuting authority in writing no later than 60 days after being 
served with the Notice of Seizure and Intent to Forfeit.  See Minn. Stat. § 169A.63, subd. 7a(a) 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/169A.63).   

You can use the Innocent Owner Notice to Prosecuting Authority form (FOR701) to notify the prosecuting 
authority of an innocent owner claim.  FOR701 is available online at 
https://www.mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=20&f=894.  Your written notice to the prosecuting authority 
does not get filed with the court.   

If you do not know whether you are an innocent owner or if you have questions about bringing an 
innocent owner claim, you may want to get legal advice. 

Do you have all the information you need to fill out the forms?

https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.48).   

A.  Date and sign the form. 
B.  Fill in the county and state you were in when you signed the form. 
C.  Fill in your full name and contact information in the blanks under the signature line.   

Step 2 

Make Copies 
Serve the Prosecuting Authority  

Make at least 2 copies of the Demand for Judicial Determination of Forfeiture you filled out in Step 1. The 
copies are for: 

•  The prosecuting authority; and  
•  Your records (bring your copies with you to court on the day of the hearing). 

The prosecuting authority must be served a complete copy of the Demand you filled out in Step 1.  This is 
called “service of process.” Service may be done in one of three ways:  

1.  Service by Certified Mail;  
2.  Personal Service by someone other than 
yourself; or  
3.  Service by Regular First-Class Mail with 
Waiver/Acknowledgment of Service. 
 

1.  Serve/Service by Certified Mail 

Deadline for Service – You must 
serve the prosecuting authority 
within 60 days of the date you 
received the Notice of Seizure 
and Intent to Forfeit form. 

You or someone else who is at least 18 years old must mail a copy of the paperwork to the 
prosecuting authority by certified mail.  
 

2.  Personal Service 

Service must be hand-delivered (personal service) and you cannot be the one to hand-deliver.  
You have to arrange for someone who is at least 18 years old and who has no interest in the case 
to hand-deliver the forms for you.  You can also hire a professional process server. 
 

3.  Service by Regular First-Class Mail with Waiver/Acknowledgment of Service 

The Rules of Civil Procedure also allow for service by regular first-class mail.  If you decide to serve 
by first-class mail, you must include the following additional forms: 

•  Notice of Lawsuit and Request for Waiver of Service of Summons (CIV022A) form;

FOR201  State

Rev 2/22 

ENG 

Page 6 of 9 

 

•  Two (2) copies of the Waiver of Service of Summons (CIV022B) form; and 
•  A prepaid way (such as a self-addressed, stamped envelope) for the other party to return a 

signed copy of the Waiver of Service of Summons (CIV022B) to you. 

The deadline for service applies even if you choose to serve by regular-first class 
mail.  If the other party does not sign and return the Waiver of Service to you, the 

papers may not be considered served.  If that happens, you must serve them by certified 
mail or personal service within 60 days of the date of when you received the Notice of 
Seizure and Intent to Forfeit form.  If you have any questions, please talk to a lawyer.
