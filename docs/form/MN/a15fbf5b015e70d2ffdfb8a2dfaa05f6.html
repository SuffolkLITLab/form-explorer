levy,  will  you or may  you owe money  to the judgment  debtor for earnings? 

Yes ______ 

No ______ 

 

2.  Does the judgment  debtor earn more than the greater  of $9.50 per hour  or the current 

federal  minimum  wage per week? 

Yes ______

INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE EARNINGS DISCLOSURE 

. If your  answer to either  question  1 or question  2 is "No,"  then  you must  sign  the 

affirmation  below and return  this  disclosure  to the sheriff  within  20 days after  it was served 
on you, and you  do not need to answer  the remaining  questions. 

. If  your answers to both questions  1 and question  2 are "Yes,"  you must  complete  this  form 

and the Earnings  Disclosure  Worksheet as follows: 

For each payday that falls  within  90 days from  the date the execution  levy  was served 
on you, YOU MUST calculate  the amount  of earnings  to be withheld  by completing 
steps 3 through  11 on page 2, and enter the amounts  on the Earnings  Disclosure 
Worksheet. UPON REQUEST, THE EMPLOYER MUST PROVIDE THE  DEBTOR 
WITH INFORMATION AS TO HOW THE CALCULATIONS REQUIRED  BY THIS 
DISCLOSURE WERE MADE. 

Each payday, you must  withhold  the amount  of earnings  listed  in  column  I on the 
Earnings  Disclosure  Worksheet. 

You must  pay the withheld  earnings  and return  this  earnings  disclosure  form  and the 
Earnings  Disclosure  Worksheet to the sheriff.  You must  also deliver  a copy of the 
disclosure  and worksheet to the judgment  debtor within  ten days after  the last payday 
that falls  within  the 90-day period. If the judgment  is  completely  satisfied  or if  the 
judgment  debtor's employment  ends before the 90-day period is over, your  disclosure 
and the withholdings  should  be made within  ten days after  the last payday for  which 
earnings  were withheld. 

For steps 3 through  11, "columns"  refers  to columns  on the Earnings  Disclosure 
Worksheet.

the judgment  debtor. (Note: Any  indebtedness  to you incurred  within 
ten days prior to your receipt  of the first  execution  levy  on a debt may 
not be set off  against  the earnings  otherwise  subject to this  levy.  Any 
wage assignment  made by the judgment  debtor within  ten days prior  to 
your  receipt of the first  execution  levy  on a debt is void.)
