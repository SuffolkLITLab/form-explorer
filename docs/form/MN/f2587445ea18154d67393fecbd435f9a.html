General Information about Informal Probate 

isit the Probate, Wills, and Estates Help Topic for more detailed information about probate, the difference 
between  informal  and  formal  probate,  and  read  some  Frequently  Asked  Questions  (FAQs)  about  the 
process. 

As you are administering the estate, make sure you are keeping track of all of the assets and expenses of 
the estate and categorize them to put into the Final Account. Look ahead to the Final Account forms to 
see what categories to keep track of.  

 If you are not sure how to administer the estate or whether the estate is ready to be closed, you should talk 
with an attorney. The information in these Instructions is not meant to be legal advice, but is a general 
guide to explain the legal process and steps for filing an Application for Informal Probate.  

If you do not understand any of these procedures, talk to an attorney. Court staff cannot give legal advice.   

You can use these forms to close the estate if: 

•  You are the personal representative.  

•  The estate is either going through informal probate or through formal unsupervised probate.  

•  You have finished administering the estate. 

•  More  than  four  months  have  passed  since  the  Notice  to  Creditors  was  published.  For  informal 
probate  cases  with  a  Will,  this  notice  is  called  the  Notice  of  Informal  Probate  of  Will  and 
Appointment  of  Personal  Representative  and  Notice  to  Creditors.  For  informal  probate  cases 
without  a  Will,  this  notice  is  called  the  Notice  of  Appointment  of  Personal  Representative  and 
Notice to Creditors.  

Step 1 

Fill Out the Inventory (PRO912) 

Inventory (PRO912) 

What is the 
Name of the 
Form? 

According to Minn. Stat. § 524.3-706 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/524.3-706), an inventory is a 
detailed list of property the decedent owned at the time of death.  It 
includes what each item is worth and any debt against each item (such as a 
mortgage or other loan against property). 

Who Fills It 
Out? 

You (the Personal Representative)*

*Unless you are a Special Administrator or are a Successor Personal 
Representative (after someone before you has been discharged as a 
personal representative) 

When?  Within 6 months of being appointed as the Personal Representative 

Within 9 months of the death of the decedent 

OR 

(whichever is later) 

Inventory: 

Then What?  You (the Personal Representative) must mail or deliver a copy of the 

•  To the surviving spouse (if there is one); 
•  To all residuary distributees; and 
•  To interested persons or creditors who ask for the Inventory. 

Does It Go to 
the Court? 

Filing the Inventory with the Court is not required, but it is good practice. 

The rest of Step 1 describes how to fill out the Inventory. 

The Caption 

 

 

The caption is at the top of page 1.  Print or type the following information: 

A.  The county where the Informal Probate case was filed. 

B.  The judicial district number (each county is located in one of ten judicial districts: 

http://www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx), and the court file number (this usually starts 
with a two-digit number, followed by letters and numbers. For example, 15-PR -17-0001). 

C.  The full name of the decedent (person who died). 

D.  After the caption, write your print or type your name as the Personal Representative.

Before you can fill in the information on page 1 (the “Summary” section), you need to fill out 
all of the Attachments (A through E).  For now, skip to Attachment A: Real Estate (on 
approximately page 3 of the Inventory).   

hen completing Attachments A-E below, all values should be reported as of the date of Decedent’s 

Do not list any non-probate property.  Non-probate property is any assets of the Decedent that can be 
transferred to a new owner without going through the probate process. For example: 

•  Real property held as joint tenants with right of survivorship; 

•  Bank or brokerage accounts that are held jointly or with a payable-on-death beneficiary 

designation to a surviving person; 

• 

Investment or retirement accounts or insurance policies that have a designated beneficiary other 
than the person who died, provided that beneficiary survived the person who died; 

•  Property held in a trust.  

If you are not sure whether an asset would be considered a probate or non-probate asset, it is a good idea 
to talk to an attorney.

Attachment A: Real Estate 

You must fill out “Attachment A” even if the Decedent did not own any real estate in Minnesota.  
Do not list real estate that is located outside Minnesota in Attachment A. 

At the top of Attachment A, print or type the name of the 
Decedent.

rest of Attachment A.

If Decedent did own land in Minnesota when they died, then fill out the rest of Attachment A: Real 
Estate. 

B.  List how many pieces of property (real estate) that are part of Decedent’s Estate.  

Then: 

1.  Start by listing information about the homestead property (if there is one) of the person who died.   

Instructions – Closing an Informal Probate 
1/21

ENG

Page 5 of 18 

a.  In the Description of Property column, include the county, formal legal description, 

AND the street address of the homestead property.  If the property 
is rural, include the acreage as well. 

b.  List the County Assessor’s market value for the homestead 

property. You can get this information from the County Assessor’s 
Office in the county where the property is located. 

c.  List the fair market value for the homestead property. Fair market 
value is the amount that the property would sell for on the open 
market, and it may or may not be the same as the County 
Assessor’s market value. Another method for trying to figure out 
the fair market value would be to get an appraisal done for the 
property. If you are not sure how to calculate the fair market value, 
it is a good idea to talk to an attorney.  

Be sure to copy the full 
formal legal description 
exactly as it appears on 
the Deed, Contract for 
Deed, or Certificate of 
Title on file with the office 
of the County Recorder or 
Registrar of Titles in the 
county where the 
property is located. An 
online description or a tax 
statement may not 
contain the full legal 
description. 

 

2.  Repeat for all other real estate in Minnesota.  If the person who died owned more than three pieces of 

Minnesota real estate when they died, you can attach extra sheets of paper.  

Contracts for Deed: If the person who died owned a Vendor/Seller’s interest, describe the property 
on Attachment A, value it at zero, and show the remaining contract balance on Attachment C. If the 
person who died owned a Vendee/Buyer’s interest, describe the property on Attachment A valuing it 
at its fair market value.  

Add up the fair market value for all of the real estate listed (including those listed on extra sheets of 
paper if there are more than 3 properties) and write in the total value.

Print or type the name of the Decedent at the top of the page, like you did in Attachment A.   If 
Decedent DID NOT own stocks, bonds, or other securities, you can check the box, and then skip the rest 
of Attachment B. 

If the Decedent did own this type of property, fill in Attachment B: 

1.  Description of Property.  Separately list and number any bonds, stocks, or other securities owned by 
the person who died. Describe each item, including the face value of bonds, the number of shares of 
stock, stock certificate numbers, and CUSIP numbers (a unique nine-character identification number 
assigned to all stocks and registered bonds in the U.S. and Canada), if they are available.  

a.  Number of Units.  Include the number of units (shares of stock). 

b.  Fair Market Value of Each Unit.  Include the value of each unit (for example, how 

much an individual stock is worth) as of the date of death. 

c.  Total Fair Market Value. Calculate the total fair market value for each (number of units 

owned X the value of each unit). 

 

 

 

Add up the fair market value for all of the stock, bonds, and securities you listed and write in the total 
value.

Print or type the Decedent’s name at the top of the page.  If Decedent DID NOT have any bank accounts 
or cash, and if no money was owed to the Estate, you can check the box, and then skip the rest of 
Attachment C.  

If the Decedent did have bank accounts and/or cash, or if money is owed to the Estate, fill in Attachment 
C: 

1.  Separately list and number all of the bank accounts, mortgages owed to the person who died, 

Contracts for Deed that the person who died had a Vendor/Seller’s interest in, notes (money owed to 
the person who died in writing), and cash held by the person who died. Describe each item, including 
the name of the bank. Do not include account numbers—use Confidential Information Form 
11.1 (CON111) to list the bank name, account holder name, and account number.  CON111 is 
available online at http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=11&f=30.  

The failure to use Form 11.1 may result in your document being rejected by court 
administration, being available to the public, stricken from the court record, and 
sanctions from the court. 

Mortgages: Only list mortgages that were owned as assets (mortgages that were owed to the person 
who died). Do not list mortgages that the person who died owed to someone else or mortgages 
secured by property in the estate (these are debts that will instead be listed on Attachment E). 

Contracts for Deed: List any Vendor/Seller’s interest that the person who died had in a Contract for 
Deed. Also include the date of the contract, the name of the Vendee/Buyer, the interest rate and 
unpaid balance at the time of death), and the accrued interest, if there was any. Do not list any 
Contracts for Deed where the person who died was the Vendee/Buyer.  

a.  Write in the total fair market value for each piece of property listed.  

Add up the fair market value for all bank accounts, mortgages, Contracts for Deed, notes, and cash 
you listed and write in the total value.

If the Decedent did have other personal property, fill in Attachment D: 

1.  Separately list and number any other personal property owned by the person who died that was not 

reported on Attachments A-C. Examples of personal property include, but are not limited to: refunds, 
clothing, household goods, automobiles, furniture, business interests, and insurance payable to the 
estate. Where appropriate, include the location of the property. Write the value of each unit in the 
description section. 

a.  Include the total fair market value for each (the unit value X how many units were 

owned). If the asset has no monetary value, write that instead.

Print or type the Decedent’s name at the top of the page.  If Decedent DID NOT owe money, mortgages, 
or liens to others, you can check the box, and then skip the rest of Attachment E.  

If the Decedent did owe others, fill in Attachment E: 

1.  Separately list any mortgages and/or liens secured by property in the Estate (debts that were owed by 

the person who died to someone else). Include details such:

b.  The payment terms; and  

c.  Any other relevant information. 

Secured Property Listed In Other Attachments.  Include the Attachment and Item Number of 
the secured property from the other attachment where you listed it earlier. For example, if the 
Decedent owed a mortgage on their homestead property, the homestead should have been listed 
on Attachment A, Item Number 1. 

d.  For each item listed in the first column, include the amount owed in the second column. 

Mortgages.  Include the remaining balance of any mortgages where the Decedent was the 
mortgage debtor.

Date and sign the Inventory form. When you sign the Inventory, you are signing under penalty of 
perjury. This means you are saying that everything in the form is true and correct; if you know 
something in the form is not true when you sign it, you could be found guilty of the crime of perjury 
(see Minn. Stat. § 609.48, https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.48). 

 

f you are not represented by an attorney, check the box for “Self-
Represented.”  Print your name, address, email, and phone number. 

Step 2 

Make Copies of the Inventory (PRO912) 

Mail Copies to Interested Persons 

Make enough copies of the completed Inventory and all attachments for your records and for each of 
the following: 

•  Surviving spouse (if any) of the Decedent; 
•  All residuary distributees; and 
• 

Interested persons and creditors that have asked for a copy of the Inventory. 

You do not need to have someone else mail these forms—you can be the one to mail them. After they 
have been mailed, fill out an Affidavit of Service (PRO915), available at www.mncourts.gov/forms 
(choose the “Probate” category).  

While you are not required to file the Affidavit of Service (your proof of service) with the court, you 
may need to prove later that the interested parties each got copies if it becomes an issue. Because of 
this, it is good to have a completed Affidavit of Service. 

Step 3 

Administer the Estate 

Administering the Estate includes, but is not limited to:  

• 

Identifying the Estate’s assets, which includes the following: 

o  Collecting amounts owed to the Estate, 

Instructions – Closing an Informal Probate 
1/21 
State 
PRO911 

ENG 

www.mncourts.gov/forms 

Page 12 of 18 

  I

   

 

 

o  Making an inventory of all of the assets, 
o  Getting an appraisal of assets if you do not know the value. 

•  Paying the taxes and debts of the Decedent. 
•  Preparing a Final Account. 
•  Distributing remaining assets to the proper parties as specified by law with Receipt of 

Distribution.  
•  Closing the Estate.  

 

For more information about these duties, see Responsibilities of Personal Representative (PRO908), 
available online at www.mncourts.gov/forms (choose the “Probate” category). If you have questions 
about how to administer the estate, it is a good idea to talk to an attorney. 

Step 4 

Fill Out the Final Account Form (PRO913) 

The Final Account must be completed and mailed within one year after the appointment of the personal 
representative (unless there are extraordinary circumstances). Filing the completed Final Account with 
the court is not required, but is a good practice.  

If an expense has been paid for using non-probate assets and no one is asking for reimbursement, do not 
include specific numbers for this expense. Instead, note that it was paid out of non-probate assets. 

 

 

Fill out the top of the form the same way as you did in the Inventory.  

A.  Check a box to say whether the Final Account you are completing is the original (the first Final 

Account), an Amended Final Account, or a Supplemental Final Account.  

B.  Write in your name as the personal representative.  

1.  Assets at Date of Death.  Fill in the total amounts you calculated from Attachments A-E in the 

Inventory. Attachments A-D should be listed in the Incoming column, and Attachment E should be 
listed in the Outgoing column. Add up the values of Attachments A-D (assets), subtract Attachment 
E (debts) from that amount, and write in the total.

2.  Summary of Increases to the Estate. To fill out the information in this section, you need to fill out 

Attachment A: Increases (which starts on approximately page 5) first. The numbers from the 
attachment are what are used to fill in the boxes in this section. This can include: 

•  any assets that were not entered on the Inventory; 
•  advances to the estate; 
• 
interest; 
•  dividends; 
•  dividend reinvestment; 
• 
•  any gain on the sale of property; and  
•  any change in value since the Inventory.  

refunds; 

On Attachment A: Increases, list an item number, description, and value for each type of 
increase. Add the values for each type of increase and write the totals in the separate boxes.  

3.  Your totals from Attachment A: Increases need to be included in the Summary of Increases to the

write in the new total. 

5.  Decreases. Skip down to Attachment B and write in a description and the value of any decreases that 

family maintenance and statutory selections made under Minn. Stat. § 524.2-403 and Minn. 
Stat. § 524.2-404; 

may apply. This can include:  

loss on the sale of property; 

• 
•  closing costs from the sale of property; 
• 

•  attorney’s fees and expenses; 
•  personal representative’s fees and expenses; 
• 
funeral expenses; 
•  expenses of last illness; 
• 

taxes (for example, real estate taxes, federal and state income taxes of the person who died, 
fiduciary income taxes, and estate taxes);

•  any other miscellaneous decreases.  

Add the values for each type of decrease and write the totals in the separate boxes.  

6.  Write the totals for each individual type of decrease from Attachment B into the box, then add them 

up and write in the total amount of all the decreases to the estate. 

7.  Assets on Hand for Distribution. Skip down to Attachment C and write in a description and the 

value of any assets on hand for distribution that may apply. This can include:  
•  personal property such as stocks, bonds, mortgages or Contracts for Deed owed to the person 

who died, notes, or cash on hand; and 
real estate, including any homestead and other real estate.  

• 

Write the totals for each individual type of decrease from Attachment C into the box, then add 
them up and write in the total amount of all the assets on hand for distribution.  

8.  Add the total decreases to the estate to the total assets on hand for distribution and write in the new 

total. 

9.  Final Summary. Add the totals for each category from the previous section into the summary box. 
The totals from each column must match (balance). If it does not balance, review the earlier sections 
of the form and attachments for errors.  

10. Skip down to Attachment D and write in a description and the amount of any claims made by 

creditors that were allowed by the personal representative but were not paid out of the estate. Add 
these values and write in the total.  

11. Sign the Final Account form, and print your phone number, date of birth, and e-mail address in the 
blanks next to the signature line. When you sign the Final Account, you are signing under penalty 
of perjury. 
 

Step 5 

Make Copies of the Final Account Form (PRO913) 

Mail or Deliver to Interested Persons 

Make enough copies of the completed Final Account and all attachments for your records and for each 
of the following: 

•  Surviving spouse (if any) of the Decedent; 
•  All residuary distributees; and 
• 

Interested persons and creditors that have asked for a copy of the Inventory. 

You do not need to have someone else mail or deliver these forms—you can be the one to serve them. 
After they have been served, fill out an Affidavit of Service (PRO915).

Page 15 of 18 

While you are not required to file the Affidavit of Service (your proof of service) with the court, you 
may need to prove later that the interested parties each got copies if it becomes an issue. Because of 
this, it is good to have a completed Affidavit of Service and to file it with the court. 

Step 6 

Distribute Assets and fill out Receipt for Assets by Distributee (PRO916) 

Once the Final Account is complete and you have identified the amount each distributee should get, you 
must distribute assets.   

A Receipt for Assets by Distributee (PRO916) should be filled out for each distributee.  The form is 
available online at www.mncourts.gov/forms (choose the “Probate” category). 

1.  Fill out caption of PRO916.  
2.  Fill out description of distributed assets in 1.  
3.  Mail or hand-deliver PRO916 to each distributee with instructions to return after signing and 

dating the form.  

4.  Keep for your records, or if you wish, you may file with the court.  

Step 7 

OPTIONAL 

Fill Out Unsupervised Personal Representative’s Statement to Close the Estate 
(PRO914) 

t is not a requirement to fill out the Unsupervised Personal Representative’s Statement to Close the Estate 
(PRO914).  You may want to get legal advice to see if it is a good idea to use this form in your case.  Minn. Stat. 
§ 524.3-1002 tells what information is needed.  See https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/524.3-1003.  

The Caption 

The top part of the first page is where you will find the case caption. Fill it in like you have for the other probate 
forms.

Write in your name as the personal representative.  

 

 

1.  You do not have to do anything for #1.  This is a statement about the things you, or an earlier Personal 

Representative, should have done to administer the Estate.

2.  List out any claims made by creditors, other expenses, or taxes owed by the estate that were not paid and 

have not been discharged (for example, forgiven by or settled with the creditor). If nothing is currently still 
owed by the estate, you must check the box for no outstanding debts. If there are debts, list them and 
describe any arrangements that have been made to pay or otherwise take care of them.  

3.  If you choose to use this form, you must send a copy to all distributees of the Estate, and to all creditors or 

others with claims against the Estate (whose allowable claims have not been paid). 

The Signature 

Sign the Unsupervised Personal Representative’s Statement to Close Estate form, and print your phone number, 
date of birth, and e-mail address in the blanks next to the signature line. When you sign the Statement to Close 
Estate, you are signing under penalty of perjury.

Step 8 

OPTIONAL 

Make Copies of Unsupervised Personal Representative’s Statement to Close 
the Estate (PRO914) 

Mail to Interested Persons 

If you chose to fill out Unsupervised Personal Representative’s Statement to Close the Estate (PRO914): 

Make copies of the completed Unsupervised Personal Representative’s Statement to Close Estate and mail one 
to all distributees of the estate and to all creditors whose claims were allowed but not paid. Keep a copy of each 
of these forms for your records.  

You do not need to have someone else mail these forms—you can be the one to mail them. After they have 
been mailed, complete an Affidavit of Service (PRO915). While you are not required to file your proof of 
service with the court, you may need to prove that the interested parties each got copies at a later time if it 
becomes an issue. Because of this, it is good to have a completed Affidavit of Service and to file it with the 
court.  

Step 9 (Optional) 

File Forms with the Court 

While it is not required, you are encouraged to file the Unsupervised Personal Representative’s Statement to 
Close Estate, Inventory, and Final Account forms into the case. The document(s) can be filed in person, by mail, 
or electronically. There is no filing fee for filing these forms.  

Your appointment as personal representative will automatically terminate one year after the Unsupervised 
Personal Representative’s Statement to Close Estate is filed with the court, as long as no issues have arisen with 
the court at that time.  

If you find additional assets after your appointment has been terminated, you will need to petition to be 
appointed as a successor personal representative.
