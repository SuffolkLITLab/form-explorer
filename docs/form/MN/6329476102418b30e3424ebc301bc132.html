Resources and General Information about Forfeiture 

orfeiture is the process that a state agency uses to seize (take) property from an owner after someone is 
arrested, charged, or convicted of a specific crime. Forfeiture of property is a civil issue that is separate from 
any criminal charges that may have been filed against someone. You can read more about forfeitures in the 
“Forfeiture and Impoundment” Help Topic online at http://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Forfeiture-and-
Impoundment.aspx.  

You will find information about asking the court to return a vehicle or property that was taken after a 
controlled substances offense in Minn. Stat. § 609.5314,  subd. 3 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.5314). If the value of the vehicle or property is $15,000  or 
less, you may file an action in conciliation  court for recovery of the seized vehicle or property.  

•  Form FOR102  is the form used when filing a forfeiture action in conciliation  court for alcohol-

related offenses. 

•  Form FOR302  is used for controlled substances cases. 

The Court has forms and instructions, for some types of cases, as a general guide to the court process. 
These instructions  explain the steps in more detail and answer common questions, but are not a full 
guide to the law. Court employees may be able to give general information on court rules and 
procedures, but they cannot give legal advice. For a list of legal resources visit www.MNCourts.gov/Find-
a-Lawyer.aspx.

Innocent Owner 

Any person (other than the defendant driver alleged to have committed the offense) may bring an 
innocent owner claim by notifying the prosecuting authority in writing no later than 60 days after being 
served with the Notice of Seizure and Intent to Forfeit.  Your written notice to the prosecuting authority 
does not get filed with the court.  See Minn. Stat. § 609.5314,  subd. 1a(a) 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.5314).  The court does not publish a form for this purpose.  
You may need to get legal advice. 

Do you have all the information you need to fill out the forms? 

The Demand for Judicial Determination of Forfeiture – Controlled Substances form (FOR302) asks for the 
following information: 

•  The name of the county in which the property was seized. 
•  The name and address of the prosecuting authority for the county where the seizure took place. 
The prosecuting authority is the attorney responsible for prosecuting the offense that resulted in 
the forfeiture (for example: Rice County Attorney’s Office).  

•  Details about the property.  For example: 

o  Amount of cash 
o  Motor vehicle: 

  Year 
  Make 
  Model

  Value of the vehicle.

get legal advice. 

Step 1

Substances (FOR302) 

 

 

The Caption 

 

A.  At the very top of the page, you will fill in 2 lines: 

 

•  The county where the vehicle and/or property was seized; and 
•  The judicial district number (each county is located in 1 of 10  judicial districts: 

http://www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx).   

•  Leave the court file number line blank. The court will assign a number after the paperwork is 

filed.  

B.  You will be the plaintiff in this case.  List your full name and address. 

C.  The defendant is a description of the vehicle or property.  For example: 2015 Jeep Cherokee (if a 

vehicle was seized), or $1,000 in U.S. Currency (if cash was seized).

Rev 1/22                   www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 3 of 8 

D.  List the name and address of the prosecuting authority for the county where the seizure took 
place. The prosecuting authority is the attorney responsible for prosecuting the offense that 
resulted in the forfeiture (for example: Rice County Attorney’s Office).  Note: it is important to list 
the correct prosecuting authority. If you are not sure which agency you should list here, get legal 
advice. 

 

Next, you will fill out the rest of the form. 

1.  Paragraph 1 asks you to give details about the vehicle and/or property. 

First, check the box showing what was seized (vehicle, or other property, or both). 

If a vehicle was seized, list following information: 

•  Date of seizure; 
•  Year of vehicle; 
•  Make (for example: Jeep, Ford, or Honda); 
•  Model (for example: Cherokee, Explorer, or Civic); 
•  The VIN (you will find this number on the vehicle’s title); 
•  License plate number; 
•  State where the vehicle is registered; and 
•  Value of the vehicle. 

If property was seized, list the date of seizure and description of the property, including the value.  
For example: “An Apple laptop computer worth $1,500” or “$1,000  in US Currency,” if cash was 
seized. 

 

 

2.  Explain your interest in the property that was seized.  For example, are you the registered owner of 

the vehicle?  If you are not sure how to describe your interest, you should get legal advice.

correct; if you know something in the form is not true when you sign it, you could be found guilty of the

Personal Service 

The prosecuting authority must receive a complete copy of the Demand you filled out in Step 1.  This is 
called “service of process.” 

Service must be hand-delivered (personal service) and you cannot 
be the one to serve.  You have to arrange for someone who is at 
least 18 years old and who has no interest in the case to hand-
deliver the forms for you.  You can also hire a professional process 
server. 

Deadline for Service – You must 
serve the prosecuting authority 
within 60 days of the date you 
received the Notice of Seizure 
and Intent to Forfeit form. 

Alternative) Service by Mail with Waiver/Acknowledgment of Service 

The Rules of Civil Procedure also allow for service by first-class mail.  If you decide to serve by mail, you 
must include the following additional forms: 

•  Notice of Lawsuit and Request for Waiver of Service of Summons (CIV022A) form; 
•  Two (2) copies of the Waiver of Service of Summons (CIV022B) form; and 
•  A prepaid way (such as a self-addressed, stamped envelope) for the other party to return a signed 

copy of the Waiver of Service of Summons (CIV022B) to you. 

The deadline for service applies even if you choose to serve by mail.  If the other party does not 
sign and return the Waiver of Service to you, the papers may not be considered served.  If that 
happens, you must serve them by personal service within 60  days of the date of when you received the 
Notice of Seizure and Intent to Forfeit form.  If you have any questions, please talk to a lawyer. 

Step 3 
Fill Out the Affidavit of Service – Forfeiture – Controlled Substances 
Offense Form (FOR303) 
*Server Must Sign* 

ou can fill the caption of the Affidavit of Service – 
Forfeiture – Controlled Substances Offense ahead of 
time.

(FOR302).

Summons on the prosecuting authority and file proof of service with the court. Follow the same steps 
about Service in Step 2 above.  Contact court administration for more information.

more information about going to court, visit the “Going to Court” Help Topic at 
https://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Going-to-Court.aspx.
