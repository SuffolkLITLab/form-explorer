General Information About Formal Probate 

isit the Probate, Wills, and Estates Help Topic for more detailed information about probate, the 
difference between informal and formal probate, and read some Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 
about the process. 

As you are administering the estate, make sure you are keeping track of all of the assets and 
expenses of the estate and categorize them to put into the Final Account. Look ahead to the Final 
Account forms to see what categories to keep track of.  

 If you are not sure how to administer the estate or whether the estate is ready to be closed, you 
should talk with an attorney. The information in these Instructions is not meant to be legal advice, 
but is a general guide to explain the legal process and steps for filing a Petition to Allow Final 
Account, Settle and Distribute Estate.  

If you do not understand any of these procedures, talk to an attorney. Court staff cannot give legal 
advice.   

You can use these forms to close the estate if: 

•  You are the personal representative.  

•  The estate is going through formal probate.  

•  You have finished administering the estate. 

•  More than four months have passed since the Notice to Creditors was published. For formal 
probate cases with a Will, this notice is called the Notice and Order for Hearing on Petition 
for Formal Probate of Will  and Appointment of Personal Representative and Notice to 
Creditors. For formal probate cases without a Will, this notice is called the Notice and Order 
for Hearing on Petition for Formal Adjudication of Intestacy, Determination of Heirs, and 
Appointment of Personal Representative and Notice to Creditors.  
 

Step 1 

Fill Out the Inventory (PRO912)

According to Minn. Stat. § 524.3-706 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/524.3-706), an inventory is a 
detailed list of property the decedent owned at the time of death.  It 
includes what each item is worth and any debt against each item (such as a 
mortgage or other loan against property). 

Who Fills It 
Out? 

You (the Personal Representative)* 

*Unless you are a Special Administrator or are a Successor Personal 
Representative (after someone before you has been discharged as a 
personal representative) 

When?  Within 6 months of being appointed as the Personal Representative 

Within 9 months of the death of the decedent 

OR 

(whichever is later) 

Inventory: 

Then What?  You (the Personal Representative) must mail or deliver a copy of the 

•  To the surviving spouse (if there is one); 
•  To all residuary distributees; and 
•  To interested persons or creditors who ask for the Inventory. 

Does It Go to 
the Court? 

Yes, for supervised administrations.  For unsupervised administrations, 
filing the Inventory with the Court is not required, but it is good practice. 

The rest of Step 1 describes how to fill out the Inventory. 

The Caption 

 

The caption is at the top of page 1.  Print or type the following information: 

A.  The county where the Probate case was filed.  

B.  The judicial district number (each county is located in one of ten judicial districts: 

http://www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx), and the court file number (this usually

starts with a two-digit number, followed by letters and numbers. For example, 15-PR -17-
0001). 

C.  The full name of the decedent (person who died). 

After the caption, write your print or type your name as the Personal Representative. 

Before you can fill in the information on page 1 (the “Summary” section), you need to 
fill out all of the Attachments (A through E).  For now, skip to Attachment A: Real 
Estate (on approximately page 3 of the Inventory).   

When completing Attachments A-E below, all values should be reported as of the date of 
Decedent’s death.   

Do not list any non-probate property.  Non-probate property is any assets of the Decedent that can 
be transferred to a new owner without going through the probate process. For example: 

•  Real property held as joint tenants with right of survivorship; 

•  Bank or brokerage accounts that are held jointly or with a payable-on-death beneficiary 

designation to a surviving person; 

• 

Investment or retirement accounts or insurance policies that have a designated beneficiary 
other than the person who died, provided that beneficiary survived the person who died; 

•  Property held in a trust.  

If you are not sure whether an asset would be considered a probate or non-probate asset, it is a 
good idea to talk to an attorney.  

Attachment A: Real Estate 

You must fill out “Attachment A” even if the Decedent did not own any real estate in 
Minnesota.  Do not list real estate that is located outside Minnesota in Attachment A. 

At the top of Attachment A, print or type the name of the 
Decedent.

a.  In the Description of Property column, include the county, 
formal legal description, AND the street address of the 
homestead property.  If the property is rural, include the 
acreage as well.

property. You can get this information from the County 
Assessor’s Office in the county where the property is located. 

c.  List the fair market value for the homestead property. Fair

is located. An online 
description or a tax 
statement may not contain 
the full legal description. 

market value is the amount that the property would sell for on 
the open market, and it may or may not be the same as the 
County Assessor’s market value. Another method for trying to 
figure out the fair market value would be to get an appraisal done for the property. 
If you are not sure how to calculate the fair market value, it is a good idea to talk to 
an attorney.

21. Step 2 of these instructions describe mailing in more detail. 

22. Date and sign the Inventory form. When you sign the Inventory, you are signing under 

penalty of perjury. This means you are saying that everything in the form is true and correct; 
if you know something in the form is not true when you sign it, you could be found guilty of 
the crime of perjury (see Minn. Stat. § 609.48, 
https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.48). 

23

23. If you are not represented by an attorney, check the box for “Self-

Represented.”  Print your name, address, email, and phone number. 

Step 2 

Make Copies of the Inventory (PRO912) 

 

   

Instructions – Closing  a Formal Probate  Case

Rev 2/23                 www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 10 of 16 

Deliver Copies to Interested Persons 

Make enough copies of the completed Inventory and all attachments for your records and for 
each of the following: 

•  Surviving spouse (if any) of the Decendent; 
•  All residuary distributees; and 
• 
Interested persons and creditors that have asked for a copy of the Inventory; 
•  The court (mandatory for supervised administrations, optional for unsupervised 

administrations). 

You do not need to have someone else deliver these forms—you can be the one to deliver them. 
After they have been delivered, fill out an Affidavit of Service (PRO1303).  

While you are not required to file the Affidavit of Service (your proof of service) with the court, 
you may need to prove later that the interested parties each got copies if it becomes an issue. 
Because of this, it is good to have a completed Affidavit of Service. 

Step 3 

Administer the Estate 

omplete the steps to administer the estate of the Decedent. 
For more information about these duties, see Responsibilities 
of Personal Representative (PRO908). If you have questions 
about how to administer the estate, it is a good idea to talk to 
an attorney. 

If there is not enough money 
to pay all of the creditors in 
full, do not pay anything until 
you receive court approval of 
the payment plan.  
 

Step 4 

Fill Out the Final Account and Proposal for Distribution Form (PRO913) 

The Final Account must be completed and mailed within one year after the appointment of the 
personal representative (unless there are extraordinary circumstances). Filing the completed Final 
Account with the court is not required, but is a good practice.  

If an expense has been paid for using non-probate assets and no one is asking for reimbursement, 
do not include specific numbers for this expense. Instead, note that it was paid out of non-probate 
assets.

C.  Write in your name as the personal representative.  

Complete the rest of the Final Account form: 

1.  Fill in the total amounts you calculated from Attachments A-E in the Inventory. Attachments 
A-D should be listed in the Incoming column, and Attachment E should be listed in the 
Outgoing column. Add up the values of Attachments A-D (assets), subtract Attachment E 
(debts) from that amount, and write in the total.  

2.  To fill out the information in this section, Attachment A: Increases needs to be completed first. 
The numbers from the attachment are what are used to fill in the boxes in this section. This can 
include: 

•  any assets that were not entered on the Inventory; 
•  advances to the estate; 
• 
interest; 
•  dividends; 
•  dividend reinvestment; 
• 
•  any gain on the sale of property; and  
•  any change in value since the Inventory.  

refunds; 

On Attachment A: Increases, list an item number, description, and value for each type of 
increase. Add the values for each type of increase and write the totals in the separate boxes.  

3.  Your totals from Attachment A: Increases need to be included in the Summary of Increases to 

the Estate box.

4.  Add the total net assets at the date of death from the Inventory to the total increases to the 

estate and write in the new total.  

5.  Skip down to Attachment B and write in a description and the value of any decreases that may 

apply. This can include:  

loss on the sale of property; 

• 
•  closing costs from the sale of property; 
• 

family maintenance and statutory selections made under Minn. Stat. § 524.2-403 and 
Minn. Stat. § 524.2-404; 
•  attorney’s fees and expenses; 
•  personal representative’s fees and expenses; 
• 
funeral expenses; 
•  expenses of last illness; 
• 

taxes (for example, real estate taxes, federal and state income taxes of the person who 
died, fiduciary income taxes, and estate taxes); 

•  payments made on mortgages, contracts for deed, or other liens; 
•  other claims allowed and paid; 
• 

interim distributions to devisees (people named in a Will to receive property) and heirs 
(people who are entitled under MN law to a share of the property of someone who died 
without a Will);  
repayment of advances (for example, estate expenses that were personally paid by an 
individual);  

• 

•  expenses of maintaining real estate; 
•  expenses of administration of the estate (for example, filing fees for opening the 

probate case, fees for publishing the notice to creditors, bond premiums, or appraisal 
fees); and 

•  any other miscellaneous decreases.  

Add the values for each type of decrease and write the totals in the separate boxes.  

6.  Write the totals for each individual type of decrease from Attachment B into the box, then add 

them up and write in the total amount of all the decreases to the estate.  

7.  Skip down to Attachment C and write in a description and the value of any assets on hand for 

distribution that may apply. This can include:  
•  personal property such as stocks, bonds, mortgages or Contracts for Deed owed to the 

person who died, notes, or cash on hand; and 
real estate, including any homestead and other real estate.  

• 

Write the totals for each individual type of decrease from Attachment C into the box, then 
add them up and write in the total amount of all the assets on hand for distribution.  

8.  Add the total decreases to the estate to the total assets on hand for distribution and write in the

9.  Add the totals for each category from the previous section into the summary box. The totals 
from each column must match (balance). If it does not balance, review the earlier sections of 
the form and attachments for errors.  

10. Skip down to Attachment D and write in a description and the amount of any claims made by 
creditors that were allowed by the personal representative but were not paid out of the estate. 
Add these values and write in the total.  

11. Sign the Final Account form, and print your phone number, date of birth, and e-mail address 
in the blanks next to the signature line. When you sign the Final Account, you are signing 
under penalty of perjury. 
 

Step 5 

Make Copies of the Final Account Form (PRO913) 

Deliver to Interested Persons 

Make enough copies of the completed Final Account and all attachments for your records and for 
each of the following: 

•  Surviving spouse (if any) of the Decedent; 
•  All residuary distributees; and 
• 
Interested persons and creditors that have asked for a copy of the Inventory; 
•  The court (mandatory for supervised administrations, optional for unsupervised 

administrations).  

You do not need to have someone else deliver these forms—you can be the one to deliver them. 
After they have been delivered, fill out an Affidavit of Service (PRO1303).  

While you are not required to file the Affidavit of Service (your proof of service) with the court, 
you may need to prove later that the interested parties each got copies if it becomes an issue. 
Because of this, it is good to have a completed Affidavit of Service and to file it with the court. 

Step 6 (If required) 

Fill Out Petition to Allow Final Account, Settle and Distribute Estate 
(PRO1302) 

he Petition to Allow Final Account, Settle, and Distribute Estate is required for supervised 

and/or insolvent estates (not enough money in the estate to pay all of the creditors in full). While 
it is not required for unsupervised administrations, you may choose to file the petition if you

want an order or decree from the court. If you are not sure whether to file this petition, it is a 
good idea to speak with an attorney. If you choose not to file this petition, skip to Step 7.  

Fill out the caption like you have done in other probate forms. 

The Caption 

he Statement 

1.  Write in your name as the personal representative.  
2.  List out any claims made by creditors, other expenses, or taxes owed by the estate that 

were not paid and have not been discharged (for example, forgiven by or settled with the 
creditor). If nothing is currently still owed by the estate, you must check the box for no 
outstanding debts. If there are debts, list them and describe any arrangements that have 
been made to pay or otherwise take care of them.  

ection 4C: The Signature 

Sign the Petition to Allow Final Account, Settle, and Distribute Estate form, and print your 
phone number, date of birth, and e-mail address in the blanks next to the signature line. When 
you sign the Petition, you are signing under penalty of perjury. 

Make copies of the completed Petition to Allow Final Account, Settle, and Distribute Estate and 
mail one to all of the demandants, unpaid creditors, and distributees in the case. Keep a copy of 
each of these forms for your records.  

You do not need to have someone else mail these forms—you can be the one to mail them. After 
they have been mailed, complete an Affidavit of Service (PRO1303). While you are not required 
to file your proof of service with the court, you may need to prove that the interested parties each 
got copies at a later time if it becomes an issue. Because of this, it is good to have a completed 
Affidavit of Service and to file it with the court.

Distribute Assets and fill out Receipt for Assets by Distributee (PRO916) 

Step 7 

Instructions – Closing  a Formal Probate  Case 
PRO1301      State       ENG  

Rev 2/23                 www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 15 of 16 

Once the Final Account is complete and you have identified 
the amount each distributee should get, you must distribute 
assets.   

A Receipt for Assets by Distributee (PRO916) should be 
filled out for each distributee.  

1.  Fill out caption of PRO916.  
2.  Fill out description of distributed assets in 1.  
3.  Mail or hand-deliver PRO916 to each distributee 

with instructions to return after signing and dating the form.  
4.  Keep for your records, or if you wish, you may file with the court.  

For supervised 
administrations, do not 
distribute any of the assets of 
the estate until you have a 
court order allowing the 
distribution.  
 

Step 8: Closing the Estate 

f you received an order allowing the Final Account and all Receipt for Assets by Distributee forms, you 
may be required to file a Petition for Discharge of Personal Representative. If the petition is approved, 
the judge will issue an order discharging the Personal Representative and their bond, if any.  

 While it is not required, if you did not already receive an order or decree allowing the final account, you 
are encouraged to file the Unsupervised Personal Representative’s Statement to Close Estate, Inventory, 
and Final Account forms into the case. The document(s) can be filed in person, by mail, or electronically. 
A motion fee is required when filing these forms.  

Your appointment as personal representative will automatically terminate one year after the Unsupervised 
Personal Representative’s Statement to Close Estate is filed with the court, as long as no issues have 
arisen with the court at that time.  

If you find additional assets after your appointment has been terminated, you will need to petition to be 
appointed as a successor personal representative.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
