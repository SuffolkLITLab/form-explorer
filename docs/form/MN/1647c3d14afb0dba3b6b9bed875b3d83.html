This  booklet  is  about  one  way  to  end  a  marriage  through  a  kind  of  divorce  called  Summary 
Dissolution. 

he legal word for divorce in Minnesota is dissolution.  There are two ways of getting a divorce, or 
dissolution, in Minnesota.  The most common way is a regular dissolution.  A shorter and easier way is 
the Summary Dissolution. 

ut not everyone can, or should, use it.  To see if you qualify to use the Summary Dissolution, answer 
the questions below.  To decide if it is a good idea for you to use the Summary Dissolution, read this 
booklet, especially the section “Is the Summary Dissolution Procedure Right for You” starting on page 
1.  

hecklist for who can use the Summary Dissolution 

A couple may use the streamlined procedures for Summary Dissolution if: 
 

1.  there are no living minor children who have been born to or adopted by the parties before or 
during  the  marriage,  unless  someone  other  than  the  husband  has  been  adjudicated  the 
father; 

2.  no spouse is pregnant; 
3.  parties have been married for less than eight years as of the date the Joint Petition was filed; 
4.  neither party owns any real estate; 
5.  there  are  no  unpaid  debts  in  excess  of  $8,000.00  incurred  by  either  or  both  of  the  parties 

during the marriage, excluding debt on automobiles; 

6.  the total fair market value of the marital assets does not exceed $25,000.00, including net 

equity on automobiles; 

7.  neither party has nonmarital assets in excess of $25,000.00; and 
8.  neither party has been a victim of domestic abuse by the other. 
Definitions:  “Fair market value” is the amount of money you could get if you sold the asset to 
a  stranger.    “Net  equity”  is  the  fair  market  value  minus  any  debt  on  the  automobile.  “Non-
marital  property”  is  things  owned  from  before  the  marriage,  things  inherited  during  the 
marriage, and gifts to an individual spouse alone which was received during the marriage, from 
someone other than the  spouse.   Domestic abuse means that there has been physical  harm or 
assault  by  one  spouse  against  the  other  spouse,  or  threats  that  cause  fear  of  being  physically 
harmed or assaulted.  
 

IS THE SUMMARY DISSOLUTION PROCEDURE RIGHT FOR YOU? 

he Summary Dissolution Procedure can save you time, money, and effort.  Court hearings, a common 
part of a regular dissolution, may require you to take time off from work.  Attorney fees can become 
expensive.  If you and your spouse can agree on how to fairly divide the property you have and who 
will  pay  the  debts  you  owe,  and  if  you  qualify  for  a  Summary  Dissolution,  then  the  Summary 
Dissolution  Procedure  may  be  right  for  you.    However,  you  should  know  that  there  are  some  things

DIV201        State      ENG       Rev 7/15                    www.mncourts.gov/forms                                             Page 1 of 32                                                                  
 

you can ask for in a regular marriage dissolution, that you cannot get in a Summary Dissolution.  For 
example: 
 

(1)  Do you or your spouse have a pension or retirement benefits?  Do you wish to receive part 
of your spouse's retirement benefits, or do you wish to give part of your retirement benefits 
to  your  spouse?    You  cannot  divide  pension  or  retirement  benefits  in  a  Summary 
Dissolution. Each spouse must keep their own pension or retirement benefits.  

(2)  Did you or your spouse operate a business during your marriage?  Do you wish to divide 

the business?  You cannot divide a business in a Summary Dissolution. 

(3)  Do  you  want  to  receive  or  pay  “spousal  maintenance?”    If  you  or  your  spouse  need 
spousal  maintenance  at  this  time  you  should  not  use  Summary  Dissolution.  The  Court 
cannot order payment of spousal maintenance in a Summary Dissolution Decree.   Do you 
want to make sure that your spouse cannot ask for spousal maintenance in the future? If so, 
do  not  use  Summary  Dissolution.  The  court  cannot  deny  spousal  maintenance  now  and 
forever in a Summary Dissolution.  The Decree in a Summary Dissolution will “reserve” 
spousal maintenance. This means that at any time in the future, you or your spouse could 
file  formal  motion  papers,  appear  at  a  hearing,  and  ask  the  court  to  order  spousal 
maintenance.  Definition:  Spousal maintenance is money paid by one spouse to another 
after the divorce is final to help with monthly living expenses.  Spousal maintenance used 
to be called alimony. 

hese are only some examples of what you cannot do in a Summary Dissolution.   

ou  should  also  know  that  there  is  no  trial  or  hearing  in  the  Summary  Dissolution  Procedure.    No 
judge  or  other  court  officer  will  review  your  property  agreement  and  division  of  debts  to  make  sure 
that  it  is  fair.    Each  of  you  will  be  relying  upon  the  honesty  of  the  other  in  completing  the  petition.  
Frequently, the anger, fear, frustration, and guilt that come along with a divorce can affect the ability 
of  people  to  agree  upon  things.    Many  times  a  spouse  may  give  up  an  important  right  or  interest  in 
order to get the divorce over.  This is an unfortunate consequence of the breakdown of a marriage.  If 
you find yourself in such a position you should consider using some other procedure to get a divorce.  
Not all divorces have to involve frequent court hearings.  Attorneys can help each of you negotiate a 
fair  settlement  when  you  have  difficulty  talking  to  each  other  about  property  or  debts.    In  addition, 
many  counties  offer  mediation  services  in  which  a  trained  person  is  present  to  help  you  talk  about 
matters that may lead to arguments when just the two of you are alone.  

ith  the  Summary  Dissolution  Procedure,  once  the  decree  is  filed,  it  is  extremely  difficult  to  get  it 
changed.    There  is  no  right  to  a  new  trial  or  to  an  appeal.    There  are  some  cases  where  agreements 
under a Joint Petition for Summary Dissolution of a Marriage can be challenged.  These include where 
(1)  you  were  treated  unfairly  in  the  property  agreement  because  your  spouse  hid  information  or 
property from you; (2) you were forced to go through the Summary Dissolution against your will by 
your spouse; and (3) there are serious mistakes in the agreement.  You will have to see an attorney if 
you wish to challenge the agreement you made in the Summary Dissolution Procedure. 

orrecting  mistakes  and  unfairness  can  be  expensive,  time-consuming,  and  difficult.    It  is  very 
important for both of you to be honest, cooperative, and careful when completing the Joint Petition if 
you choose to use the Summary Dissolution Procedure. 

If  you  are  not  sure  if  you  qualify  for  a  Summary  Dissolution  or  if  you  should  use  a  Summary 
Dissolution, ask an attorney.  If you do not qualify or if you decide a Summary Dissolution is not right 
for  you, there  are other  forms  you may use for a marriage  dissolution.   These forms  are available at 
www.mncourts.gov/forms or at the courthouse.

here is no court hearing with a Summary Dissolution.  You may not need an attorney, although you 
might wish to discuss  your rights with one before  you get  your marriage dissolved.  (See page 4 for 
details on how an attorney can help you.) 

o get a summary dissolution, you will need to prepare the Joint Petition for Summary Dissolution 
of a Marriage.  Both spouses must sign the Joint Petition under penalty of perjury.  By signing under 
penalty of perjury, you and your spouse are stating that the information in the document is true to the 
best of your knowledge.  Perjury is the crime of intentionally lying or misrepresenting the truth. Next 
you file the Joint Petition with the Court Administrator in your county.  If your petition is approved, 
you should receive a Notice of Entry of a Decree of Dissolution from the court 30 days after you file it, 
which means your marriage is ended.  The dissolution is not final until the decree is entered. 

f  you  wish  to  use  the  Summary  Dissolution  Procedure,  you  must,  at  the  time  you  file  the  Joint 
Petition, sign a statement which says that you have read and understood this booklet and have seen any 
educational videos that may be available at the time.  It is important that you read the whole booklet 
carefully. 

ou  should  think  carefully  about  what  you  are  doing  before  you  file  the  Joint  Petition.    Once  the 
Decree  of  Dissolution  is  entered,  it  is  very  difficult  to  get  it  changed.    You  will  need  to  talk  to  an 
attorney to see if you can get the judgment changed. 
 

SPECIAL IMMIGRATION WARNING  
If  you are  an alien who  became  a lawful permanent  resident on the basis of  your marriage to  a  U.S. 
citizen  or  a  lawful  permanent  resident,  obtaining  a  divorce  within  two  years  might  lead  to  your 
deportation.  You should consult an attorney before obtaining a divorce. 

RE YOU SURE YOUR MARRIAGE CAN'T BE SAVED? 

efore you take any legal steps to end your marriage, consider possible ways of saving it.  Check the 
Yellow Pages under Marriage Counseling or Counseling Services or obtain a referral from an agency 
or friend if you wish to contact a Marriage Counselor. 

n  addition  to  private  counselors,  many  communities  and  religious  organizations  offer  marriage 
counseling services.  Some larger businesses also offer counseling to their employees.  Your medical 
insurance may make counseling services available if the problems in your marriage started because of 
alcohol or drug abuse.   

n most cases, these services are available for free or for a small cost based upon your ability to pay.   

O YOU NEED AN ATTORNEY? 

ust you have an attorney to get a divorce with the Summary Dissolution Procedure? 

ou  are  not  required  to  have  an  attorney.    But  you  may  want  to  talk  to  an  attorney  to  decide  if  a 
Summary Dissolution is the right way for you to get a divorce or whether a regular dissolution might 
be better.  You should also know that court personnel cannot advise you in this process and if you do 
not complete the form properly or follow the instructions, you may lose your filing fee and not get the 
divorce.

f you want legal advice, does that mean you have to hire an attorney? 

o.    You  may  hire  an  attorney,  of  course,  but  you  can  also  talk  to  an  attorney  just  once  or  twice 
(generally at a reasonable cost) for advice on how to carry out the Summary Dissolution.  Before you 
talk to the attorney, ask what the fee will be. 

f you are concerned about whether you can pay an attorney, read the information below about finding 
an attorney. 

o you have to accept your attorney's advice? 

o, you don't.  And if you are not pleased with what one attorney advises, you can feel free to go to 

another one.  You and your spouse may desire to seek advice from different attorneys. 

ow can an attorney help you with the Summary Dissolution? 

The  most  important  thing  an  attorney  can  do  for  you  is  to  help  you  decide,  based  upon  your 
personal situation, whether you should get a regular divorce or a Summary Dissolution.  

An  attorney  can  check  through  the  Property  Settlement  Agreement  to  help  you  figure  out 
whether you have thought of everything you should have.  (It's easy to forget things you don't 
see or deal with very often--savings bonds, retirement funds, safe deposit boxes, and so on.) 

There may be situations where it is difficult to figure out what should count as marital property 
and  what  should  count  as  non-marital  property.    (See  pages  13-14  of  the  booklet  to  find  out 
what these words mean.)  Suppose that you had money before you got married, and after you 
were married you put that money into a savings account in both your names, then both of you 
put some of your earnings into that account and also used some of the money in the account to 
buy things.  It may not be easy for you to decide how the money that is in the account should be 
divided.  An attorney can help you to make these decisions. 

There may be some other special situations in your property settlement that are not covered by 
the examples in this booklet. 

here can you find an attorney? 

f you have friends who have gone through a divorce you can ask them who they had for an attorney 
and what they thought of the attorney.  You can also check the Yellow Pages of the phone book under 
"Attorneys" or check the Internet. 

he Minnesota State Bar Association has an online referral system at http://www.mnfindalawyer.com/.   

f you feel you cannot pay for an attorney, you may contact the legal aid office in your area.  You must 
meet  certain  low-income  and  other  guidelines  to  get  these  legal  services.    The  legal  aid  office  may 
refer you to a volunteer attorney program which can help you.

s you read this booklet you will find some words and phrases that you do not know or which may not 
mean what you think they do.  It is very important that you understand the meaning of these words as 

DIV201        State      ENG       Rev 7/15                    www.mncourts.gov/forms                                             Page 4 of 32                                                                  
 

you will be making some important decisions using them.  These words include:  marital property, 
non-marital  property,  fair  market  value,  irretrievable  breakdown  of  the  marriage,  ownership 
interest in land  and spousal  maintenance.    Marital  and non-marital  property  and  fair market  value 
are defined in the section of this booklet titled "Completing the Summary Dissolution Form." 

rretrievable breakdown of the marriage 

n Minnesota, it is not necessary to show that anyone is at fault for the breakdown of a marriage.  All 
that is necessary is that you are sure that you and your spouse have serious permanent differences that 
make it impossible for you to go on being married.  The results of divorce can be very serious and you 
should be careful that you have tried everything you can before seeking a dissolution of your marriage. 

wnership interest in real estate 

n order to use the Summary Dissolution process, you and your spouse must not own or be buying any 
land. 

n general this means: 

(1) 
(2) 

You are not buying and do not own any land. 
You  are  not  buying  and  do  not  own  a  farm,  a  house,  a  townhouse,  timeshare, 
condominium, or any part of any building. 

SPECIAL WARNING FOR NATIVE AMERICANS 
If  you are a Native American,  you may have an  ownership interest  in  tribal lands that will prevent 
you from using the Summary Dissolution Procedure.  You may want to check with your tribal council 
to see if this is true. 

pousal maintenance (Alimony) 

pousal  maintenance (alimony) is  money paid  by  one spouse to  the other after the marriage is  over.  
Under certain special situations, either of you may seek to have the other pay some money to help you.  
In regular dissolution proceedings spousal maintenance may be waived and forever denied.  However, 
you cannot give up that right in this Summary Dissolution proceeding.  Minnesota law now requires 
each of  you save (reserve) the right  to  get  spousal  maintenance if  you use the Summary Dissolution 
process.    If  you  later  want  spousal  maintenance,  you  may  need  to  talk  to  an  attorney  to  see  if  you 
qualify and to help you get it. 

OMPLETING THE SUMMARY DISSOLUTION FORM 

n  order  to  get  a  Summary  Dissolution,  you  must  complete  and  file  the  Joint  Petition  for  Summary 
Dissolution of a Marriage.  The form is available online at www.mncourts.gov/forms or at any county  
Court  Administrator's  Office.    Although  the  form  looks  complicated,  it  can  be  easily  completed  by 
following the instructions given for each line below.  If you have questions, you may want to look at 
the example given after this section.  Remember, you must answer the questions listed in the form.  If 
you do not, your divorce will not be granted and you may lose the filing fee you have paid. 

ou begin the form by filling in the information  required at the top.  You must type or print clearly 
using  black  or  dark  blue  ink.    Because  both  parties  are  in  agreement  to  dissolve  the  marriage,  both 
parties  are  called  “Co-Petitioner”  and  it  makes  no  difference  which  party  is  listed  first.    Whoever  is

Line 5 asks a group of questions about where you live at the time you file the Joint Petition.  You must 
answer  all  the  questions  listed  in  Line  5.    For  each  question,  you  should  answer  “yes”  or  “no”  by 
putting your initials in the appropriate column and the spouse should answer “yes” or “no” by putting 
her / his initials in the appropriate column. 
 

Lines 5a and 5b ask if either you or your spouse have been living in Minnesota for at least six 
(6)  months  at  the  time  you  file  the  Joint  Petition.    One  of  you  must  have  been  living  in 
Minnesota for at least six months, unless you qualify under Lines 5c and 5d, Line 5e and 5f, or 
Line 5g.  

Lines 5c and 5d ask if either you or  your spouse are a member of the armed forces and have 
been stationed in Minnesota for at least six (6) months.   

Lines  5e  and  5f  ask  if  you  remained  a  resident  of  Minnesota,  even  though  you  have  lived 
outside  the  state.    If  you  have  lived  outside  the  state  for  some  reason--for  example,  for 
temporary  employment  or  to  attend  school--but  have  never  intended  to  move  permanently  to 
another state, you have remained a resident of Minnesota. 

ine 5g asks if you and the spouse were civilly married in Minnesota, and you and your spouse 
no longer live in Minnesota, and there is no other state that will allow an action for dissolution 
because of the sex or sexual orientation of you and the spouse.   Based on a new law effective 
August 1, 2013, Minnesota retains jurisdiction to dissolve a same sex marriage if these specific 
conditions apply.      

n Line 6 are questions concerning minor children and other dependents you or the spouse may have. 
A “minor child” is a child under age 18, or age 18 but still in high school.  If you and the spouse have 
living minor children together you may not use the Summary Dissolution Procedure.  6b asks if there 
are children born to Petitioner A since the marriage date, who are not biological or adopted children of 
Petitioner B, and 6c asks if there are children born to Petitioner B since the marriage date, who are not 
biological or adopted children of Petitioner A.  If there are, you cannot use the Summary Dissolution 
Procedure unless someone other than the Husband has been adjudicated the father. Being named on the 
birth certificate is not the same as being adjudicated.  

ine  7  asks  whether  a  spouse  of  the  marriage  is  pregnant.    If  so,  you  may  not  use  the  Summary 
Dissolution  Procedure.    A  Husband  and  Wife  are  legally  required  to  provide  support  for  an  unborn 
child.  A court must decide how much support the Husband and Wife are required to furnish and where 
the child will live.  Those decisions cannot be made by the Husband and Wife as part of the Summary 
Dissolution  Procedure.    If  you  and  your  spouse  are  a  same  sex  couple  and  meet  the  statutory 
requirements  set  forth  in  Minn.  Stat.  §  518.07,  subd.  2,  you  may  be  able  to  use  the  Summary 
Dissolution Procedure if a spouse of the marriage is pregnant.

ine 8 asks whether you have ever been the victim of domestic abuse.  You have been the victim of 
domestic  abuse  if  your  spouse  has  physically  harmed  or  assaulted  you,  or  your  spouse's  actions  or 
threats have caused you to fear that you may be physically harmed or assaulted.  If this is so, you may 
be  afraid  to  ask  for  a  fair  division  of  property.    For  this  reason  if  you  have  ever  been  the  victim  of

domestic abuse or if an order for protection has ever been issued, the Summary Dissolution Procedure 
is  not  available  to  you.    You  should  immediately  seek  the  advice  of  an  attorney  and  should  not 
complete the Summary Dissolution Procedure. 

n  Line  9  you  or  your  spouse  must  state  whether  either  of  you  have  filed  for  a  divorce  somewhere 
else, either in this state or in another state.  If you have and you both now want to file a Joint Petition 
for Summary Dissolution, you must have the other action dismissed.   

n Line 10 you and your spouse must agree to check "yes" to show that there has been an irretrievable 
breakdown in your marriage.  This means that you and your spouse do not have any hope to save your 
marriage.   It does not matter why or whose fault it was that the marriage failed, but simply that  you 
both agree that you no longer wish to remain married to each other.  If you cannot agree that there has 
been  an  irretrievable  breakdown  in  your  marriage  you  may  not  use  the  Summary  Dissolution 
Procedure. 

ine 11 asks whether you and your spouse own or have an interest in real estate, such as a lot, a farm, a 
house, a townhouse, a timeshare, a condominium, or any other type of building.  If, for example, you 
and your sister have received a farm as part of an inheritance, you have an interest in real estate, even 
though you may not live on the farm or receive any of the income from it.  If you and your spouse have 
any  interest  in  real  estate,  whether  together,  separately,  or  with  someone  else,  you  may  not  use  the 
Summary Dissolution Procedure. 

ine 12, 13, and 14 

ines 12, 13, and 14 of the Joint Petition are questions relating to the amount of property you and your 
spouse own.  Several worksheets are included in this booklet to help you to answer the questions that 
are asked.  As you complete the worksheets that are included in this section, transfer the amounts to the 
proper  lines  of  the  Joint  Petition  for  Summary  Dissolution.    The  Minnesota  summary  process  for 
dissolution of marriage requires  each spouse to determine the fair market value of (1) non-marital 
property  and  of  (2)  marital  property  and  then  subtract  any  amounts  still  owing  on  the  property  to 
determine its present value. (The terms are defined below.) 

Fair  market  value"  is  an  estimate  of  the  amount  of  money  you  could  get  if  you  sold  items  to  a 
stranger, as, for example, through an advertisement in the newspaper.  It does not mean what you paid 
for it originally, and it does not mean what it would cost you to replace it if you lost it.  When you list 
your  property,  you  must  list  items  although  you  are  still  paying  for  them.    The  present  value  of 
property you are still paying for is the fair market value minus the amount you still owe.  If you do not 
owe anything for the property, then the fair market value is the same as the present value. 

ne way of estimating the "fair market value" of your property is to use prices for equivalent items 
in  newspaper  advertisements  for  second-hand  goods.    Other  ways  include  having  items  appraised, 
calling  dealers,  and,  for  vehicles,  asking  for  the  "blue  book"  value  from  your  dealer  or  lending 
institution.

n this section of the booklet you must determine the present value of your "Non-marital Property."  
"Non-marital Property" is property that each spouse owns separately from the other spouse.  In most 
cases that includes: 

    1. 
     2.  
     3.  
     4.  

anything each of you owned before you got married; 
anything you inherited even after you were married; 
anything that was given to you as a gift, even after you were married; and 
if you have had a legal separation, anything you received or earned after the date of the 
Court Order granting the legal separation. 

emember, if you are still paying for an item that you bought before the marriage you must subtract 

the amount you still owe from the fair market value to get the present value. 

orksheets A and B are provided on the next two pages for your use in determining the total value of 
your  non-marital  property.    Petitioner  A  will  enter  the  TOTAL  from  Worksheet  A—Petitioner  A’s  
Non-Marital Property on Line 12, page 4 of the Joint Petition.  Petitioner B will enter the TOTAL from 
Worksheet B—Petitioner B’s Non-Marital Property on line 13, page 4 of the Joint Petition. 

ou should know that some property may be part marital and part non-marital.  You should review 
the comments on page 13 of this booklet to understand this.  In this section you must list the value of 
the non-marital part, figure out the total value of your non-marital property and fill in the amount in the 
correct box on the Summary Dissolution Petition.

Line 14  Marital Property 

 

n  order  to  complete  Line  14,  you  must  determine  the  present  value  of  your  "Marital  Property."  
"Marital  Property"  is  everything  that  you  and  your  spouse  have  together  that  does  not  fit  the 
definition of non-marital property.  It does not matter who paid for the item.  For example, if only one 
person worked outside the home earning an income and the other spouse worked as a homemaker, the 
property is  still considered marital  property.   It  also  does  not  matter that the property is  in  only one 
person's name or that only one person uses the property. 

ou should carefully  complete Worksheet  C on  pages 14  and 15.  The  Worksheet  includes types of 
property to  help  you  remember the property  you own.  Certain  types of property, such as retirement 
benefits, profit sharing, IRA's, and Deferred Income are generally held only in the name of the person 
who is receiving those benefits, although they are marital property.  For those items, you must each fill 
in the proper space (Petitioner A or Petitioner B) in the Present Value column of the Worksheet.  If you 
do not have that type of property write -0- in the Present Value column. 

ome property you must actually list.  First, you must write the make, model and year for each vehicle 
that  is  marital  property.    Remember  to  subtract  the  amount  you  still  owe  on  an  automobile  when 
figuring its present value.  Second, you must list under "13. Miscellaneous" on page 16, every item or 
type of property with a fair market value of $100 or more that is not included in categories 1-12.  (For 
example, clothing, household goods, etc.)   Listed below you will find information that may be helpful 
in valuing certain types of property.  
 

To  determine  the  value  of  a  pension  or  profit  sharing  account,  you  should  call  the 
employer and ask for the most recent statement for the account.   

IRA's are Individual Retirement Accounts 

Keogh Plans are retirement plans for self-employed people. You should consult with an 
expert to determine the value of a Keogh Plan. 

You  can  call  the  insurance  company  to  find  out  the  value  of  whole  or  universal  life 
insurance policies. 

Valuing business interests is a complex undertaking.  You should consult with an expert 
to determine the value of any business.   

In addition to checking advertisements for the selling price of vehicles like yours, you 
may wish to use the "blue book" value.  Remember,  you must subtract the balance of 
the loan from the fair market value. 
 

ote:  Pensions and retirement benefits that accumulated during the marriage are marital property regardless of whether the 
benefits were acquired through your employment or through your spouse's employment.  If you wish to receive part of your 
spouse's retirement benefits, you cannot use this summary proceeding for dissolution of marriage and you should consult 
with an attorney.

If a spouse operated a business during the marriage that business may be marital property regardless of 
the  fact  that  only  one  spouse  conducted  the  business.    If  you  wish  to  receive  part  of  your  spouse's 
business, you cannot use this summary proceeding for dissolution of marriage, and you should consult 
with an attorney.    

nce  you  have  determined  and  entered  the  total  present  value  of  the  various  types  of  your  marital 
property on Worksheet C, you can then transfer this information to line 14, page 4 of the Joint Petition 
for Summary Dissolution of Marriage. 

ou  should  also  use  Worksheet  C  to  indicate  how  your  marital  property  will  be  divided  after  the 
dissolution  of  your marriage.  For each type of  property listed on Worksheet  C, enter the amount of 
that  property  that  you  and  your  spouse  have  agreed  will  be  awarded  to  Petitioner  A  or  Petitioner  B.  
This information will be entered on line 16, page 4 of the Joint Petition.  See page 12 of this booklet 
for further information about the division of marital property. 

Note:  Combined Marital and Non-Marital Property 
 
Sometimes property can be  marital  and  non-marital.   For example, a spouse may have earned some 
pension  benefits  before  the  marriage  and  also  earned  additional  benefits  during  the  marriage.    As 
another  example,  one  spouse  may  have  purchased  an  item  that  was  partially  paid  for  before  marriage 
and partially paid for after marriage.  In these examples, the property is  marital and non-marital, and 
you must list the property in both the marital and non-marital worksheets.  Sometimes determining the 
value  of  the  marital  and  non-marital  portions  is  very  complicated  especially  when  the  property  is 
something that is already difficult to value such as a pension or an interest in a business.  If you have 
property that you believe is marital and non-marital, you may wish to consult with an attorney for help 
in dividing the property.

(individually  or  jointly)  incurred  during  the  marriage  and  still  owe,  except  for  money  you  owe  for 
buying automobiles.  Worksheet E  -- Division of Debts (see page 17) will help you to figure out the 
total debt you still owe and help you to divide the debts between you and your spouse.  To complete 
the worksheet,  you must do three things: (1) you must identify all debts that you incurred during the 
marriage that you still owe, regardless of whether the debts are in both names or in one spouse's name, 
and fill that amount in on Line 15, page 4 of the Joint Petition for Summary Dissolution of a Marriage; 
(2) you must list the creditor (the person or company to whom the money is owed) and the amount that 
still remains to be paid; and (3) you must determine who will pay each debt.  Worksheet E will help 
you to complete later parts of the Joint Petition.  You can agree to divide the amount owed to a creditor 
between the two of you if it will help to make a fair division of the debts. 

emember  that  while  you  do  not  include  the  amounts  you  owe  for  automobiles  when  you  figure 
Worksheet E,  you must still decide who will pay any debt owed for an automobile and list it on the 
division of debts on lines 17 and 18 on pages 7 and 8 of the Joint Petition.  Use Worksheet D below to 
enter those amounts.

Line 16  The Division of Property Agreement 

his is one of the most important parts of the Summary Dissolution Procedure.  When you completed 
the Marital Property Worksheet C on pages 14 and 15 of this booklet, you were asked to decide who 
should be awarded the items of property you listed.  You were also asked to total the amounts that each 
person received.  You should now review that worksheet.  Each of you should be receiving about the 
same amount of property and be required to pay the same amount of debts as the other.  If one of you 
is taking more property but paying off a larger amount of debts, then the agreement may still be fair.  If 
one  of  you  is  receiving  much  more  property  than  the  other,  the  agreement  may  not  be  fair  and  you 
should review your worksheets to see what can be changed to make it fairer.  If you cannot agree on a 
fair division of  your marital property,  you may wish to consult an attorney for help in making a fair 
division.    If  you  still  cannot  agree,  you  should  not  use  the  Summary  Dissolution  Procedure.    You 
should know that you can transfer your non-marital property to your spouse if it will help both of you 
to reach a fair division of property.  

ou  should  now  transfer  the  information  on  the  division  of  property  from  the  Marital  Property 
Worksheet  C  on  pages  14  and  15  and  fill  in  the  Division  of  Property  Agreement  found  on  Line  16, 
page 4, of the Joint Petition.  If you have questions, you may wish to review the example in this next 
section of this booklet. 

ines 17 and 18 The Division of Debts Agreement 

n  these  two  charts,  list  the  names  of  the  creditors  that  each  of  you  will  individually  pay  and  the 
amount you will pay them, using the information you filled in on Worksheet E--Division of Debts on 
page 17 of this booklet.  You can agree to divide the amount owed to a creditor between the two of you 
if  it  will  help  to  make  a  fair  division  of  the  debts.    It  is  important  to  make  sure  that  the  division  of 
property and debts is fair.  If you cannot agree on a fair division of your debts, you may wish to consult 
an attorney for help.  If you still cannot agree, you should not use the Summary Dissolution Procedure. 

ote:  You should know that if your spouse does not pay a debt he or she agreed to pay as part of the 
Summary Dissolution Procedure, the person to  whom  the money is  owed may  attempt to  collect  the 
debt  from  you  even  if  you  list  your  spouse  as  responsible  for  the  debt  in  the  Joint  Petition.    If  the 
creditor makes you pay the debt,  you might later seek a court order to get your spouse to pay you back 
the money you were forced to pay because your spouse did not live up to the agreement.  If you have 
reason to worry about this, you should see an attorney to discuss your rights and obligations. 

f you have credit card accounts that you both have been using, you should consider closing them and 
opening separate accounts.  If  you don't,  you may be required to pay debts on your spouse's charges 
after your marriage is dissolved.

ach  of  you  must  list  your  current  gross  monthly  income  on  Line  19.    That  is  the  amount  you  earn 
before any deductions are made.  Each of you must then complete Worksheet F on page 20 to help you 
figure  your  total  current  necessary  monthly  expenses  and  fill  in  that  amount  in  the  proper  places  on 
Line 19.  These figures are necessary if either of you would later decide to seek spousal maintenance.  
Maintenance  will  not  be  ordered  as  part  of  the  Summary  Dissolution  Procedure,  but  the  Decree 
“reserves”  spousal  maintenance,  which  means  that  either  person  can  seek  a  court  order  for  spousal 
maintenance  in  the  future.    If  you  want  a  court  order  that  prevents  both  you  and  your  spouse  from 
asking for spousal maintenance in the future, you should not use Summary Dissolution.  

Each  of  you  should  make  and  keep  a  copy  of  Worksheet  F.    If  you  do  not,  the  court  may  have 
difficulty  in  setting  the  proper  amount  of  spousal  maintenance  if  it  is  requested  in  the  future.

n Line 20 you are asked to indicate what  you will do about health insurance.   You should answer 
only  one  of  the  questions  on  Line  20.  If  you  are  both  employed  and  get  health  insurance  through 
work,  then  you  may  each  agree  to  be  responsible  only  for  yourself.    If  one  of  you  is  not  currently 
employed or does not have health coverage through work,  your spouse may continue to carry health 
insurance provided that any costs for the insurance are paid by you.  Health insurance coverage can be 
a significant issue and should be carefully considered by both of you before completing this section.  If 
you  are  unable  to  obtain  health  insurance  and  your  spouse  refuses  to  carry  you,  you  may  want  to 
consult with an attorney and not complete the Summary Dissolution Procedure. 

f you wish to change your name after your divorce is granted, you may do so on Line 21.  You are not 
required to do so.  Petitioner A may use any of the names listed on Line 1a of the Joint Petition and 
Petitioner B may use any of the names listed on Line 2a of the Joint Petition.  You may want to look at 
the instructions for Lines 1a and 2a again for further information.  If either Petitioner A or Petitioner B  
wishes  to  change  their  name,  they  must  indicate  whether  or  not  they  have  ever  been  convicted  of  a 
felony  in  this  or  any  other  state.    If  Petitioner  A  or  Petitioner  B  has  been  convicted  of  a  felony  and 
wishes to change their name as part of this dissolution, they must follow special procedures.  

elon Name Change Procedures: 

An  applicant  with  a  felony  conviction  under  Minnesota  law  or  the  law  of  another  state  or  federal 
jurisdiction shall serve notice regarding their application for name change on the prosecuting authority 
that obtained the conviction.  If the conviction is from another state or federal jurisdiction, notice must 
also be served on the Minnesota Attorney General at 102 State Capitol Building, St. Paul, MN 55155.  
A  form  for  giving  Notice  to  the  prosecuting  authority  is  available  at  the  courthouse  or  at 
www.mncourts.gov/forms.    The  form  is  called  “Felon  Name  Change  Notice  to  Prosecutors.”    The 
method of serving the Notice on the Prosecuting authority is complicated and to determine the proper 
method of service, consult an attorney.  Requirements for service may differ from  county to  county.  
Proof  of  service  shall  be  filed  with  the  court  as  part  of  the  name  change  request.    The  prosecuting 
authority has 30 days to object to the name change application.  The dissolution cannot be granted until 
thirty  days  has  elapsed  from  the  date  the  prosecutor  was  served  with  Notice  about  the  name  change 
request.

EXAMPLE 

pouses have been married for two years.  They have no interest in land or buildings and they have no 
children.    They  both  live  in  Ramsey  County.    Spouse  One  has  a  car  that  he/she  paid  for  before  the 
marriage.  It is now worth $2,000.  Spouse One also has a color television set worth $300 that he /she 
owned before the marriage.  Spouse Two owned living room furniture before the marriage.  It is now 
worth about $1,000.  Spouse Two also bought a stereo system for $800 and has been paying for it in 
installments.    Spouse Two had paid  $500 before the marriage and $200 since the marriage, and  still 
owes $100 on the system. 

ince they have been married they have bought another car for $10,000.  They still owe $5,000 for the 
car and it is now worth $8,000.  When they got married, they opened a joint savings account.  Spouse 
Two put in $600 and Spouse One put in $400.  They have used the account for various purchases and 
the balance is now $500.  During the years they have been married, Spouse One has contributed $1,500 
to his/her retirement account and Spouse Two has contributed $1,200.  They owe $500 on a VISA card 
that they had used largely for entertainment purposes.  However, six months ago Spouse One charged a 
set of golf clubs for $300 on the card.  Both spouses estimate that about $50 has been paid off on the 
clubs.  They each own about $1,000 worth of clothes.

alue and Division of Marital Property 

he spouses now complete Worksheet C on pages 14 and 15 of the booklet.  As shown on page 25, 
they  enter  the  fair  market  value  of  their  marital  property  and  subtract  any  amount  they  still  owe  to 
reach  the  "present  value."    The  spouses  then  add  the  amounts  in  the  "present  value"  columns  from 
Worksheet C and enter that amount on line 14, page 4, of the Joint Petition.  

14. 

Enter  total  present  value  of  all  marital  property  of  Petitioner  A  and  Petitioner  B, 
. 
including automobiles and pensions:  $ 8,450 
(Include  the  TOTAL  figure  from  the  bottom  of  Worksheet  C  on  page  15  of  the 
Booklet.) 

hey now divide their marital property using the information from the Worksheets.  They have decided 
that each of them will keep their retirement accounts, since the amounts are close.  If they had decided 
otherwise,  they  could  not  use  the  Summary  Dissolution  Procedure.    The  "fair-market  value"  and  the 
"present value" of a pension are the same. 

t would be difficult to determine what amounts in the savings account might belong to each of them.  
Rather than argue, they  have agreed that they will share the amount in the same proportion as when 
they opened it.  Spouse Two receives 60% ($600/$1,000 of the original account) or $300 and Spouse 
One receives 40% ($400/$1,000) or $200.

They have also included the automobile they bought during the marriage. 

he stereo that Spouse Two started to purchase before the marriage has a fair market value as marital 
property of $300 (fair market value of $800 minus the non-marital value of $500) so it must be listed 
on Worksheet C under "Miscellaneous."  The amount still owing is subtracted giving a present value of 
$200 (fair market value of the marital property of $300 minus the amount still owing of $100). 

he  golf  clubs  that  Spouse  One  purchased  also  have  a  fair  market  value  of  more  than  $100.    The 

present value is $50 (fair market value of $300 minus the amount still owing of $250. 

eciding what to do about the automobile is more difficult for the spouses.  They discuss selling it and 
splitting the profit from the sale.  Spouse One would like to keep the car and is willing to continue the 
payments,  but  cannot  give  Spouse  Two  his/her  interest  (one-half  of  its  present  value,  or  $1500).  
Spouse Two needs to have an automobile, but does not feel  he/she can afford the payments they are 
currently making along with all the other expenses he/she will soon have.  After further discussion, the 
spouses  agree  that  Spouse  One  can  give  Spouse  Two  his/her  old  automobile,  which  is  non-marital 
property  with  a  value  of  $2,000.    Since  it  is  Spouse  One’s  non-marital  property,  he/she  is  free  to 
dispose of it as he/she wants and this seems a better solution for both of them.  Spouse Two  gets an 
automobile  and  Spouse  One  gets  to  keep  the  newer  car.    Spouse  One  also  agrees  to  continue  the 
payments on the new car.

he  spouses  must  now  complete  Worksheet  E  to  figure  out  how  much  they  owe  and  who  will  pay.  
The amount that is still owing for their automobile, $5,000, is not included in figuring the amount of 
debts that must be listed on line 15, page 4, of the Joint Petition.  However, when it is time to divide 
the debts, it will be necessary to include the debt and who will pay it in the division of debts on the 
charts for questions 17 and 18, pages 7 and 8, of the Joint Petition.  They have entered the amount on 
the reminder sheet found on Worksheet D, page 16, of this booklet.

credit card charge for the golf clubs and will keep the clubs.  Since the remaining $250 ($500 owing 
minus the $250 for the clubs) was spent jointly, the spouses divide the amount between them at $125 
each.  Spouse One agrees to pay $375 of the VISA card ($250 for the clubs plus $125 share of the joint 
debt) and Spouse Two pays $125 (his/her share of the joint debt).  Spouse Two will also finish paying 
for the stereo ($100 still owing) and will keep it.  Spouse One will be keeping the new car and will 
continue the payments  as they agreed.  They use the information  from  Worksheet  E to  complete the

WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET A SUMMARY DISSOLUTION? 

.    Complete  a  “Confidential  Information  Form”  by  printing  your  name,  your  spouse’s  name,  your 
social  security  number,  and  your  spouse’s  social  security  number,  and  complete  a  “Confidential 
Financial Source Documents” form for any other identifying financial information that should be kept 
confidential.    Print  your  name  after  the  line  “information  supplied  by.”  Sign  your  name  on  the  line 
immediately below.   

.  When the Joint Petition is complete, you and your spouse must sign the verifications.   

.  Make copies for both you and the spouse of all the completed worksheets in this booklet and make 
copies of the completed Joint Petition for Summary Dissolution of a Marriage.  Keep these copies in a 
safe place as you may need them later.  You do not file the worksheets with the court. 

.  File the Joint Petition for Summary Dissolution of a Marriage, Confidential Information Form, and 
Confidential Financial Source Documents form with the Court Administrator.  You will be required to 
pay a filing fee and any other court fees.  You may call the Court Administrator to find out what the 
filing  fee  and  court  fees  are  in  the  county  where  you  are  filing  the  Joint  Petition  for  Summary 
Dissolution of a Marriage. 

.  Once the Petition has been filed, there is a waiting period of 30 days before the court administrator 
can  “enter”  your  Decree  of  Dissolution.    You  are  not  divorced  (and  cannot  remarry)  until  the  court 
administrator “enters”  your Decree of Dissolution.  You will receive a written “Notice of Entry of a 
Decree of Dissolution” by mail, and then you will know you are divorced. If your address changes in 
that 30 day waiting period, you should inform the court administrator in writing of your new mailing 
address.  If more than 30 days have passed and you have not received the “Notice of Entry of a Decree 
of Dissolution” you may wish to contact the Court Administrator to see if a Decree of Dissolution has 
been entered. 

enial of Divorce 

If you have not completed the Joint Petition for Summary Dissolution of a Marriage correctly, or if for 
some other reason you do not qualify for the Summary Dissolution procedure, the Court Administrator 
cannot give you your divorce.  You will receive written Notice of Denial of the Petition.  Your filing 
fee and law library fee will not  be returned to  you.   If this happens,  you will want  to  take copies of 
your  Joint  Petition  to  an  attorney  who  will  be  able  to  advise  you  on  how  you  may  complete  your 
divorce.   

ou may later be required to prove to someone, for example, a bank, that you are divorced.  In order to 
do this, you will have to get a certified copy of the Decree of Dissolution.  This is not the same as the 
Notice of Entry of a Decree of Dissolution that you receive in the mail.  The Court Administrator will 
issue a certified copy of your Decree of Dissolution for a small fee.

OME GENERAL ADVICE 

hat about income taxes? 

If  you  have  filed  a  joint  tax  return,  you  will  still  both  be  responsible  for  paying  any  unpaid 
taxes even after your divorce. 

If you are receiving a refund, you should agree in the property settlement on how it should be 
divided. 

Once you are single, your income tax withholding may be higher.  Be prepared to pay more in 
taxes. 

hat about titles to cars and other vehicles? 

If you own cars or other vehicles in both your names and you agree that one of you is going to 
own the vehicle after the divorce, you will have to transfer the title to that person.  You should 
go together to the Department of Public Safety representative in your county to do this. 

hat if your spouse doesn't pay his or her debts? 

As discussed in the booklet, you may be required to pay off a creditor even though your spouse 
agreed  in  the  Division  of  Debts  to  be  responsible  for  the  debt.    You  may  wish  to  talk  to  an 
attorney  if  this  happens  or  you  may  sue  to  recover  any  amount  less  than  $10,000  in 
Conciliation Court.  The Court Administrator can inform you about costs and procedures to use 
in  Conciliation  Court.  Forms  and  information  are  also  available  on  the  Internet  at 
www.mncourts.gov.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
