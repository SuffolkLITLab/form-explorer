The Court has forms and instructions, for some types of cases, as a general guide to the court 
process. These instructions explain the steps in more detail and answer common questions, but are 
not a full guide to the law. Court employees may be able to give general information on court rules 
and procedures, but they cannot give legal advice.

General Information About Certificates of Dissolution 

he information contained in this document is not intended as legal advice but as a general 
guide to you to explain the legal process.  If you do not understand any of these procedures, 
talk to an attorney.  Court staff cannot give legal advice. 

One  resource  for  this  general  information  is  the  “Help  Topics”  on  the  MJB  website: 
http://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics.aspx.  

What is the Certificate of Dissolution used for? 

Like  your  divorce  decree  (Findings  of  Fact,  Conclusions  of  Law,  Judgment  and  Decree),  the 
Certificate of Dissolution signed by a judge can be used to prove that you are divorced.  They can 
also be used to prove that a person’s name was  changed in the divorce  case.  The Certificate of 
Dissolution contains far less personal information, and is much shorter, than the divorce decree.  See 
Minn. Stat. § 518.148. 

Can the Certificate of Dissolution be used to transfer title to real estate? 

No.  The Certificate of Dissolution does not show proof that title of real estate is transferred from 
one party to another.  A different form called a Summary Real Estate Disposition Decree may be 
used to show an award of real estate between the parties.  See Minn. Stat. § 518.191 (NOTE: The 
Minnesota Judicial Branch does not publish a Summary Real Estate Disposition Decree.  You may 
be able to find a sample form at a law library, a legal publisher, and the Minnesota Department of 
Commerce website.).   

Do you have all the information you need to fill out the forms? 

The Certificate of Dissolution form (DIV103) asks for the following information (see Minn. Stat. § 
518.148): 

•  The county, judicial district, and court file number of your case; 
•  Current name and former name(s) of each party;  
•  Date the judge or referee signed the Judgment and Decree; and 
•  Details about name changes, if any, in the divorce case.

Getting the Certificate of Dissolution (DIV103) Signed by a Judge 

Step 2 

f you are not already divorced, the court will either prepare the Certificate of Dissolution to be attached 
to the judgment and decree at the time of granting the dissolution of marriage or direct an attorney, or one 
of the parties if both parties are self-represented, to prepare and submit the Certificate of Dissolution to 
the court.   

If you are already divorced (the Judge has already signed your Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, 
Judgment and Decree, and the court administrator has entered the judgment) and a Certificate of 
Dissolution has not been prepared or previously filed with the court, you may make a written request and 
the court shall approve the request.  The court may require you or your attorney to prepare the Certificate 
of Dissolution and submit the Certificate to the court. 

After the judge has signed the Certificate of Dissolution, court administration will fill in the bottom 
of page 2: 

  I

Once the completed Certificate of Dissolution has been filed in your case, you may purchase a certified 
copy or a plain copy from court administration.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
