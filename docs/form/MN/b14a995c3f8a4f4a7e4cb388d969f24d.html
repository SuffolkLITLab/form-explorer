FAMILY COURT  
MATTER 

Instructions for: 
DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE 
WITHOUT CHILDREN 

 

 

 

You may file your divorce in the County where you live 

or the county where your spouse lives. These instructions 

contain general information. Filing fees, policies and 

procedures may vary by county.  

If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee or other costs, 

ask the Court Administrator/Deputy for an “IFP” 

application to waive fees. A judge will decide if you have 

to pay, based on your application.

The  court does not require you  to have a lawyer.  You may represent yourself, and you 
will be referred to as a “self-represented litigant.”  Court forms are available from the court but 
court  personnel  cannot  assist  you  in  filling  out  the  forms.  The Court expects every  person who 
appears in court without an attorney to know and to follow the law.  If you act as your own attorney, 
you must do what an attorney would do. 

 

 
The  danger  in  representing  yourself  is  that  you  may  not  recognize  legal  issues  or 
problems in your case, or you may delay your divorce by failing to follow required procedures.  
You  may  get  a  divorce  and  learn  later  that  you  made  serious  mistakes  that  cost  you  money  or 
create other problems. Changing a divorce order is difficult, and for some issues, like division of 
property, it is nearly impossible to change a divorce order.  

  You may wish to consider talking to a lawyer even if you plan to represent yourself.  A 
 
lawyer can help you with all or just part of the process.  For example, you may decide to ask a 
lawyer to help you decide if you should ask for spousal maintenance. 

 
  Here are some areas where people run into problems and need legal advice. If you answer 
YES to any of the questions below, you are strongly advised to talk to an attorney before signing 
any divorce forms. 

1.  Does your spouse have an attorney? 
2.  Do you or your spouse have pension, retirement or profit sharing plans? 
3.  Do you or your spouse own a home or other real estate together or separately? 
4.  Do you or your spouse own a business? 
5.  Do you or your spouse have a large amount of assets (money, property)? 
6.  Did you sign an antenuptial contract? 
7.  Do you and your spouse have children together or is a spouse pregnant? 
8.  Since your marriage, has a spouse given birth to a child fathered by someone other than the 

other spouse? 

9.  Have you or your spouse filed for bankruptcy or plan to in the near future? 
10. Are you or your spouse involved in a personal injury lawsuit? 
11. Are you worried about paying debts? 
12. Are you claiming you have non-marital property? 
13. Do you want spousal maintenance (formerly called “alimony”) or is your spouse asking for 

spousal maintenance? 

14. Do you have questions about how to continue medical insurance? 
15. Are you or your spouse a member of the armed services?

Can I file for divorce in Minnesota?  

1.  The law states that before you can begin a divorce in Minnesota, you or your spouse must 
have lived in Minnesota for the last six months, OR you or your spouse must be a member 
of the armed forces stationed in Minnesota for the last six months.  If neither you nor your 
spouse have lived in Minnesota for the last six months, STOP – you cannot get a divorce in 
Minnesota  yet.    You  must  wait  until  one  of  you  has  lived  in  Minnesota  for  at  least  six 
months.  File in the county where either you or your spouse live now. 

2.  If you and your spouse are a same sex couple who were civilly married in Minnesota, but no 
longer live in Minnesota, based on a new law effective August 1, 2013, you and your spouse 
may file an action for dissolution in Minnesota if there is no other state that will allow an 
action for dissolution because of the sex or sexual orientation of you and your spouse. 

3.  If you or your spouse has already started a divorce, legal separation or annulment action in       
Minnesota or in any other state, you cannot start this divorce.  You may either complete the 
other action, or you may have the other action dismissed and then start this divorce action. 

What Forms Do I Need?  

 
  You should use the Petition for Dissolution Without Children forms ONLY if there are no 
children who were born of, or adopted into this marriage.  You may be able to use these forms if a 
child was born to a spouse during a marriage between a same sex couple.  You may want to talk to 
an attorney if this situation applies to you.   A “child” is someone 17 years old or younger.  “Child” 
also means someone 18 or 19 years old, if the child is still in high school. If the wife gave birth to a 
child  during  the  marriage  and  the  husband  or  wife  is  claiming  husband  is  not  the  father  of  that 
child,  you  must  use  the  forms  associated  with  the  Petition  for  Dissolution  of  Marriage  With 
Children, unless you have a court order stating that the spouse is not the father of that child, or you 
attach  certified  copies  of  Recognition  of  Parentage  AND  Husband’s  Non-Paternity  Statement 
(signed by mother, father, and husband). 

Do You Need a Temporary Order? 

 
If you need an order for spousal maintenance, possession of the homestead, or any other matter 
in the divorce before the final divorce decree is issued, ask court administration for the Temporary 
forms  at 
Relief  Pending  Final  Hearing  Without  Children 
www.mncourts.gov/forms (select the Divorce/Dissolution category).   

forms  or  download 

the 

Do the Forms Have to be Typed? 

 
Typed forms are preferred because they are easier to read. You may print your answers if your 
writing is clear and neat. Use dark ink. If you need more space to answer a question, write “See 
Exhibit A” and attach an additional full sheet of paper labeled “Exhibit A.”  If a second attachment 
is needed, label it “Exhibit B.”

As you fill out the forms, you MUST follow all of the attached instructions. 

Helpful materials may be found at your public county law library.  For a directory, see

INSTRUCTIONS 

Step 1            

Fill Out the Summons Form 

  Summons  tells  your  spouse  that  you  have  filed  a  lawsuit  against  him  or  her  asking  for  a 
divorce, and also tells your spouse that if he or she does not file a written Answer to your lawsuit, 
the Court may give you everything you ask for in your lawsuit. 

HOW TO FILL IN THE SUMMONS: 

•  On the line marked “Name of Petitioner," write your full name.  From now on, you will 

be called Petitioner. 

•  On the line marked “Name of Respondent,” write your spouse’s full name.  From now on, 

your spouse will be called Respondent. 

•  Check  the  appropriate  box  “without  real  estate”  or  “with  real  estate”  at  the  top  right 
section  of  the  Summons.    Check  “with  real  estate”  if  you  or  your  spouse  together  or 
separately own real estate, land, or buildings in Minnesota or elsewhere. 

•  Check  the  appropriate  box  at  question  #3.  If  there  is  no  real  estate,  check  the  box  that 
says,  “This  proceeding  does  not  involve  real  property.”  If  you  and/or  your  spouse  own 
real  estate, select the first box and fill in the street address, county, and state of all real 
property (such as a house or cabin) owned either by you or your spouse. You must also 
give  the  legal  description  of  the  property  (the  legal  description  is  not  the  same  as  the 
street address). Example of Legal Description: Lot 1, Block 4, Hamden Edition, Hennepin 
County, Minnesota. You can get a copy of the legal description from the Deed, Contract 
for Deed, or Certificate of Title at the office of the County Recorder or Registrar of Titles 
in the county where the property is located.  

WARNING:  Be sure to copy the legal description exactly as it is on the Deed, 
Contract for Deed, or Certificate of Title.  If there is more than one parcel of real 
estate,  you  must  provide  the  address  and  legal  description  for  each  parcel.    The 
form provides space for two parcels. If you have more than that, you may add the

language “See attached Exhibit A” following the legal description for the second 
parcel  of  land.    On  a  separate  full  sheet  of  paper,  write  the  information  for  the 
other parcels of land.  Label the separate sheet of paper “Exhibit A” and staple it 
to the completed Summons. 

•  Fill in your address and phone number at the bottom of the Summons.   

•  Caution: Make sure you list all real estate. To avoid title problems in the future, list all 
real estate owned by the parties together or separately in the Summons and Petition and 
the divorce Decree. You and your spouse both have an interest in all real estate owned by 
either you or your spouse until the divorce is finalized and the Decree awards the property 
to just one party. For example, a deed given by one spouse to the other spouse before the 
divorce is finalized does not transfer all interest to the grantee spouse. 
 

Fill Out the Petition for Dissolution of Marriage Form 

Step 2            

YOU MUST ANSWER EVERY QUESTION  
Write "NA" on the blanks that do not apply or  
write “Unknown” if you are unable to obtain the information. 

he Petition is divided into two parts. The first part gives the court information about you, your 
spouse, your children, your finances, and your property. The second part tells the court and your 
spouse what you are asking for from the court. 

HOW TO FILL OUT THE PETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE 

•  Fill in the name of Petitioner (you) and Respondent (your spouse) 
•  Answer questions 1-29 completely.   
•  The following instructions are numbered the same as on the Petition form.   

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS 1-29   

NOTE: The instructions are numbered the same as in the Petition.  For example, for help in 
answering Question #3 on the Petition, read instruction #3.     

Throughout  this  case,  you  will always be  known as  the Petitioner.  Provide  the  address 
where you live. If there is no mail service to your residence, list an address where you can 
receive mail, in the lines provided for mailing address. Give your birth date, and list all 
former or other name(s), such as a maiden name, or former married name.  

Throughout this case, your spouse will always be known as the Respondent.  Provide the 
address where the Respondent lives.  If you do not have a current address, check the box 
next  to “Respondent’s  address is  unknown  to  Petitioner.”   If there is no mail  service at

your  spouse’s  residence,  list  an  address  where  you  spouse  receives  mail,  in  the  lines 
provided for mailing address. Enter the Respondent’s date of birth and all former or other 
name(s), such as a maiden name, or other married name.  

Provide information about the date and location of your marriage.   

Check YES if you have lived in Minnesota for the last six months. Otherwise, check NO. 
Check  YES  if  your  spouse  has  lived  in  Minnesota  for  the  last  six  months.  Otherwise, 
check NO. 

STOP:  The law states that before you can begin a divorce in Minnesota, either: (1) you 
or  your  spouse  must  have  lived  in  Minnesota  for  the  last  six  months;  or  (2)  you  or  your 
spouse  must  be  a  member  of  the  armed  forces  stationed  in  Minnesota  for  the  last  six 
months. If neither you nor your spouse have lived in Minnesota for the last six months, you 
cannot file for a divorce yet. You must wait until one of you has lived in Minnesota for at 
least six months. If one of you has lived in Minnesota for the last six months, then go on to 
answer the rest of the questions.  

Note:  A law that became effective August 1, 2013, will allow a same sex couple who were 
civilly  married  in  Minnesota  to  dissolve  their  marriage  in  Minnesota  if  neither  spouse 
resides  in  Minnesota  nor  resides  in  a  state  that  will  recognize  an  action  for  dissolution 
because of the sex or sexual orientation of the Petitioner and Respondent. 

Answer the questions about the military status of both you and your spouse.  If either you 
or  your  spouse  is  a  member  of  the  armed  forces  there  are  special  procedures  under  the 
Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. Contact an attorney. 

In Minnesota, a marriage can be dissolved even if only one of the parties states that the 
marriage  relationship  is  over.  By  filling  out  this  Petition  you  are  stating  that  your 
marriage is over and cannot be saved.  

Check YES if you are still living together; check NO if you are not.  If NO, print the date 
you physically separated.  If YES, describe why you are living together at this time. 

Check YES if you or your spouse has already started another dissolution, legal separation 
or annulment proceeding in Minnesota or any other state.   

WARNING:  If  you  or  your  spouse  have  already  started  a  divorce  or  legal  separation  or 
annulment  case  in  Minnesota  or  in  any  other  state  and  it  has  not  been  dismissed,  you 
CANNOT start this divorce. You could either complete the other action, or you could have 
the other action dismissed and then start this divorce.  

Check NO if there is no other action.   

Check  YES  if  there  is  an  existing  Order  for  Protection  or  an  existing  Harassment 
Restraining Order against the Petitioner or Respondent; complete this question and file a 
copy of the order when you file the completed Petition.  Check NO if there is no Order.

10. 

This section is to make sure you are using the right forms.  If you and your spouse have 
minor  children  together,  you  need  to  use  a  different  court  form  called  Marriage 
Dissolution  WITH  Children.  Also,  if  you  and  your  spouse  have  an  adult  disabled  child 
and you want the  court to  order support payments for the  adult  child,  you must  use the 
Marriage Dissolution WITH Children forms.   

Subparagraph (c) of Question 10 asks if there were any children born to wife during the 
marriage  from  another  relationship.  This  is  important  because  Minnesota  law  presumes 
that  any  child  born  after  the  marriage  date  is  the  husband’s  biological  child.  The 
presumption that husband is the father generally means that husband is legally the father, 
with  all  rights  and  responsibilities  of  fatherhood,  unless  there  is  an  adjudication  that 
someone  else  is  the  biological  father.      If  someone  else  is  the  father,  you  can  use  the 
Marriage  Dissolution  without  Children  forms  only  if  there  is  a  court  order adjudicating 
someone  else  to  be  the  father,  OR  the  wife,  husband  and  biological  father  have  signed 
forms  called  “Recognition  of  Parentage”  and  “Spouse’s  Non-Parentage  Statement”  and 
these two forms have been filed with the State Office of Vital Statistics.  If paternity has 
not  been  adjudicated  already,  use  the  Marriage  Dissolution  WITH  Children  forms,  and 
raise the paternity issue through those forms. 

If either party has given birth to a child born during the marriage from another 
relationship and a Recognition of Parentage and Spouse’s Non-Parentage Statement have 
been signed, you must be sure to attach a certified copy of both forms.  Certified Copies 
of the Minnesota Recognition of Parentage and Non-Parentage Statement can be obtained 
by completing and notarizing the required form provided by the Minnesota Department of 
Health.   

ou can get the form from the Minnesota Department of Health website at: 

http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/chs/osr/cerropsnpsiao.pdf or you can call 651-201-
5970 to request a copy of the form.  The fee for a certified copy is $9.00 per copy.  The 
completed form and fee should be mailed to:

ubparagraph d of Question 10 asks if either spouse is pregnant. If the answer is Yes, you 
need to use different forms - the Marriage Dissolution With Children forms.  This is true 
even if a spouse is pregnant by someone other than the husband. In those forms, you can 
state that you believe the spouse is not the father of the unborn child. 

11. 

“Public assistance” means MFIP,  Tribal TANF, General Assistance, medical assistance, 
MinnesotaCare, or child care assistance.  Check YES or NO.  If YES, write in the name 
of  the  county  paying  the  assistance.    Minnesota  law  requires  you,  as  the  Petitioner,  to

notify  the  county  paying  assistance  that  you  are  filing  a  divorce  action.    Use  the  form 
called  “Notice  to  Public  Authority”  (court  form  DIV813)  to  notify  the  county  of  your 
divorce action. See Step 6 for further information. 

Answer  whether  the  Petitioner  or  Respondent  receives  Supplemental  Security  Income 
(SSI).  SSI is based on need (low-income).  SSI is not the same as Social Security (SSDI 
or RSDI) due to disability, retirement, or death of a parent or spouse.  

This question is about your employment status.  Provide the requested information about 
your employer.  If you are self-employed, list the business name and address. 

This question asks for your gross monthly income.  If you are paid weekly, multiply your 
weekly income by 4.33 to get monthly income.  If you are paid every two weeks, multiply 
by 2.17 to get monthly income.  If you are paid twice per month, multiply by 2.   

This  question  is  about  your  spouse’s  employment  status.    Provide  the  requested 
information about your spouse’s employer.   

This  question  asks  about  your  spouse’s  gross  monthly  income.    You  are  given  three 
choices. If you have no information about your spouse’s income, check the first box.  If 
you have some information, check the second box and answer the questions.  If you have 
detailed  information about  your  spouse’s  income,  check the third  box  and complete the 
questions.   

17. 

Complete the questions about medical and dental insurance. 

NOTE:  If you or your spouse are covered by medical or dental insurance through your job 
or your spouse’s job, that coverage can be continued even after the divorce. If you want the 
insurance  coverage  to  continue  after  the  divorce,  call  the  Employment  Benefits  Office  of 
you or your spouse’s employer and ask for “COBRA” coverage. 

This question is about spousal maintenance.  Spousal maintenance is money paid by one 
spouse to help support the other spouse. Spousal maintenance used to be called alimony. 
You  have  four  choices  on  the  form.  You  can  ask  a  lawyer  for  help  if  you  want  to  do 
something that does not fit the form, or if you do not understand the choices or the law 
regarding  spousal  maintenance.  If  one  spouse  makes  more  money  than  the  other  or has 
more  property  or  savings,  talking  to  a  lawyer  is  strongly  recommended.  The  law  for 
spousal maintenance is complicated and the financial impact can be great.  If you are sure 
that you do not want to receive or pay spousal maintenance now or in the future, check 
the first box. 

19. 

List all the vehicles owned by you and your spouse together or separately. 

WARNING:    Questions  20-27  ask  about  marital  and  non-marital  property,  assets,  and 
debts. Dividing property and debts can be complicated. You should talk to an attorney if 
you  have  assets  or  debts.   An  attorney  can review your  situation and tell you  what claim

Marital Property means almost  anything that you  or  your spouse  own  that you or 
your spouse received during the marriage, even during the times that you and your 
spouse  were  separated.  This  includes  real  estate,  boats,  cabins,  household  goods, 
furniture, jewelry, and other things. 

Non-marital Property means: (1) anything that you or your spouse owned before the 
marriage; (2) anything that you or your spouse received as a gift, bequest, devise, or 
inheritance;  (3)  anything  that  you  or  your  spouse  got  in  trade  or  in  exchange  for 
your  non-marital  property;  (4)  anything  that  is  an  increase  in  the  value  of  non-
marital property; (5) anything you or your spouse received after the valuation date 
set by the Court; or (6) anything included by a valid antenuptial contract (STOP: If 
you have an antenuptial contract, you should stop here and talk to an attorney.)  

Check  YES or NO whether you and your spouse have divided the marital property to 
your  mutual  satisfaction,  including  household  goods,  furniture,  furnishings,  and  other 
belongings. If you have NOT divided the marital property, list the items that you want. 

(a) Check YES or NO whether you claim non-marital property.  Non-marital property is 
property  you  owned  before  you  got  married  or  acquired  during  the  marriage  by 
inheritance or gift.  List all non-marital property you own.  

(b) Check YES or NO whether your spouse claims non-marital property.  Non-marital 
property  is  property  your  spouse  owned  before  the  marriage  or  acquired  during  the 
marriage by inheritance or gift.  List all non-marital property your spouse owns.  

Check  YES  or  NO  whether  you  or  your  spouse  has  money  in  banks,  savings,  cash  or 
investments.  If YES, fill in all columns in the box.  Use Confidential Information Form 
11.1 (CON111) to list the name of the financial institution, account holder name(s), and 
account  numbers.    Using  Form  11.1  keeps  your  account  numbers  confidential  from  the 
public.  Do not list account numbers on the Petition. 

Check YES or NO whether you and/or your spouse own part or all of a business.  If YES, 
fill in the name, address and value of the business. 

Check  YES  or  NO  if  either  you  or  your  spouse  own  a  manufactured  home.    If  YES, 
complete the detail questions. 

WARNING: Question 25 asks you to list all real property. Real property is land and the 
buildings on the land. You must list all real property owned by you and your spouse together, 
separately, or with others. Failure to list all property will create serious problems and expense in 
the future. Dividing real property is complicated. You should talk to an attorney if you 
and/or your spouse own any real property. You and your spouse both have an interest in all 
real estate owned by either you or your spouse until the divorce is finalized and the Decree

awards the property to just one party.  For example, a deed given by one spouse to the other 
spouse before the divorce is finalized does not transfer all interest to the grantee spouse. 
  
25. 

 (a) Check YES or NO if you and your spouse own any real property together.  

(b)  Check  YES  or  NO  if  you  own  real  property  solely  in  your  name  or  with  someone 
other than your spouse. 

(c)  Check  YES  or NO if Respondent owns real property solely  in his/her name or with    
someone other than you. 

(d) Answer how many properties are owned by you and your spouse in total. 

If YES to (a), (b) or (c), complete the Real Property Information questions for each piece 
of  property.    (1)  List  the  full  names  of  all  owners  of  the  property.    (2)  Fill  in  the  legal 
description  of  the  property  (the  legal  description  is  not  the  same  as  the  street  address). 
Example  of  Legal  Description:  Lot  1,  Block  4,  Hamden  Edition,  Hennepin  County, 
Minnesota.  You  can  get  a  copy  of  the  legal  description  from  the  Deed  or  Contract  for 
Deed at the office of the County Recorder or Registrar of Titles in the county where the 
real property is located. WARNING: Be sure to copy the legal description exactly as is 
on  the  Deed  or  Contract  for  Deed.  (3)  Fill  in  the  street  address,  city,  county,  and  state 
where  your  property  is  located.    (4)  State  the  date  the  property  was  purchased  and  its 
purchase  price.  (5)  State  the  amount  of  any  existing  loans  or  mortgages.  (6)  State  the 
current market value of the property and describe how you came up with that value.  (7) 
Check YES if this property is the homestead.   

WARNING:  Question  26  asks  about  pension,  profit  sharing,  and  retirement  plans. 
Dividing pension, profit sharing, and retirement plans is complicated. You or your spouse 
could face large losses if the divorce decree does not divide the pension or retirement plan 
according to the laws that apply. You should talk to an attorney if you or your spouse have 
any of these types of plan. 

26. 

(a)  Check  YES  or  NO  if  you  have  an  IRA,  401(k),  403(b),  or  other  retirement  plan.  If 
YES,  list  the  current  account  balance.  Use  Confidential  Information  Form  11.1 
(CON111)  to  list  the  name  of  the  financial  institution,  account  holder  name(s)  and 
account numbers. 

(b) Check YES or NO if your past or present employer, union, or other group, paid money 
into a pension, profit-sharing, or other retirement plan for you.  If YES, list the name of 
the  plan,  the  name  of  the  group  employer,  union,  or  group  providing  the  plan,  the  date 
you began working at the job or joined the plan, the type of plan, and the present value of 
the plan.  

(c) Check YES or NO if your spouse has an IRA, 401(k), 403(b), or other retirement plan.

paid money into a pension, profit-sharing, or other retirement plan.  If YES, list the name 
of the plan, the name of the group employer, union, or group providing the plan, the date 
your spouse began working at the job or joined the plan, the type of plan, and the present 
value of the plan.  

Check YES or NO if you and/or your spouse have outstanding debts (owe money) either 
together or separately. If YES, list all of the debts you and your spouse now have, even if 
only one of you created the debt and even if only one of your names is on the credit card, 
loan  or  note.  List  all  debts  still  owed  from  before  you  were  married,  from  during  the 
marriage but before separation, and after separation.  The Judgment and Decree (divorce 
Decree) will state who is responsible for paying each debt. Include credit card bills, gas 
bills, water bills, telephone bills, school loans, car loans, home loans and mortgages, and 
other bills and loans. List to whom the debt is owed (such as Sears); how the money was 
used (such as “clothing  for the children”); whose name is on the account and when the 
debt was created (if you cannot get the exact date the debt was created, at least state if the 
debt  is  from  before  the  marriage,  or  during the marriage and before separation,  or after 
separation);  the  current  balance  due;  and  the  monthly  payment.  Attach  another  sheet  of 
paper if you need more space. You must disclose all debts.  

28. 

You may change your name as part of the divorce, but you do not have to do so. You can 
change your name to a maiden name, or some other name.  You cannot make your spouse 
change  his  or  her  name,  and  your  spouse  cannot  make  you  change  your  name.    If  you 
want to change your name, check YES and answer (a) – (c).  If you do not want to change 
your name, check NO.   

(a)  Print  your  new  name  (first,  middle,  and  last).    Do  not  use  initials  unless  you 
want only an initial instead of a full name.  Check whether this is a former legal 
name or maiden name.  If not, explain why you want to change to this name. 

(b) You cannot change your name if your reason for changing your name is to defraud 
or mislead anyone.  Mark True or False to the statement “Petitioner has no intent 
to defraud or mislead anyone by changing his/her name.” 

(c)  If you have a felony conviction, you cannot change your name unless you notify 
the prosecuting authority that you intend to change your name.  The prosecuting 
authority  has  30  days  after  being  served  with  your  notice  to  object  to  the  name 
change.    If  you  have  been  convicted  of  a  felony  anywhere  in  the  United  States, 
answer  (c)  YES.    Ask  court administration to give  you the Felon Name Change

how to get COBRA coverage.  If you have other questions, or if the boxes provided do 
not explain what you want the court to order, ask an attorney for help. 

If you want spousal maintenance to be denied now and forever, check box 3(a).  If you 
want to be able to ask for maintenance at a later date after the divorce is completed, then 
check box 3(b).(Your spouse can also ask for maintenance at a later date if maintenance 
is reserved.)  If spousal maintenance should be ordered to help either you or your spouse 
pay for necessities, check the appropriate boxes in 3(c). 

In question 19 above you listed all of the vehicles owned by you and your spouse. Write 
down which vehicles you want the court to give to you and which vehicles you want your 
spouse to have.  

WARNING:    Dividing  marital  property  and  non-marital  property  is  complicated.  You 
should talk to an attorney. 

Check  YES  or  NO  whether  you  and  your  spouse  have  already  divided  your  marital 
property to your mutual satisfaction. If NO, list the marital property you want to receive 
and the marital property you want your spouse to receive.  

Check YES or NO whether you and your spouse have already divided your non-marital 
property  to  your  mutual  satisfaction.  If  NO,  list  the  non-marital  property  you  want  to 
receive and the non-marital property you want your spouse to receive.

If you or your spouse own real property either separately or together, check off whether 
you  (Petitioner)  or  your  spouse (Respondent)  should be  awarded that real property, and 
then  list  the  street  address,  city,  county,  and  state  where  the  homestead  is  located,  and 
then  write the exact legal description.  You can get a copy of the legal description from 
the Deed or Contract for Deed at the office of the County Recorder or Registrar of Titles 
in the county where the property is located.  Write in the name of the mortgage company 
and the amount of the current mortgage balance. If there is additional real property, list it 
in paragraph 11.   

If there is additional real property, provide the address and legal description and state how 
that property should be awarded. 

Describe  how  your  pension,  profit  sharing,  retirement,  IRA  or  401  plan  should  be 
divided, then do the same with any plan in your spouse’s name. Get competent legal and 
tax advice before making any decisions. 

In  question  27  above  you  listed  all  of  the  debts  you  and  your  spouse  have.  Include  all 
debts listed from question 27 and state who should be ordered to pay the debt.  Check box 
(b) also. This box covers any individual debt that is not specifically listed, and orders the 
person who took on the debt to pay it. For example, if your spouse has debt you do not 
know about, in his/her name alone, checking box b. will require your spouse to pay that 
debt.  Warning:  If debt is in both your names, the court can order one of you to pay the 
debt,  but  the  creditor  can  still  seek  payment  from  both  of  you.  For  help  with  how  to 
minimize your risk of having creditors go after you for joint debt your spouse was ordered 
to pay, talk with a lawyer before you serve your spouse with the divorce papers. 

If  you  want  to  change  your  name,  print  exactly  how  your  new  name  should  be  listed 
(first, middle, and last). Do not use initials unless you want only an initial instead of a 
full name.

Step 5 
Serve the Other Party 

our  spouse  must  receive  a  copy  of  your  Summons  and  Petition  for  Dissolution  of  Marriage. 
Delivering  the  copy  to  your  spouse  is  called  “service  of  process.”  Your  marriage  dissolution 
action  is  started  the  moment  your  spouse  is  served  with  the  Summons  and  Petition  for 
Dissolution of Marriage.  

 These  instructions  describe  three  ways  to  do  “service  of  process”:      (1)  Personal  Service,  (2) 
Waiver of Service, and (3) Alternate Service. Read about each of the three ways to decide which 
way is appropriate in your case.   

  Y

Service of Process Method #1: Personal Service 

This  is  the  most  common  method  for  serving  divorce  papers.  With  Personal  Service,  a  third 
person  (the  “server”)  who  is  at  least  18  years  old  hands  a  copy  of  the  Summons  and  Petition 
directly to your spouse.  Papers cannot be served on legal holidays (as defined in Minn. Stat. § 
645.44,  subd.  5,  https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44#stat.645.44.5).    After  serving 
the papers, the server must fill out the Affidavit of Personal Service, and sign it under penalty of 
perjury. The Affidavit of Personal Service is your proof that the papers were delivered, and tells 
what date they were delivered. See the following instructions on how to fill out the Affidavit of 
Personal Service. 

•  A copy of the Summons and Petition is handed directly to your spouse (not mailed, not

left with a roommate.) 

•  You cannot hand the papers to your spouse. 

•  Papers can be handed to your spouse at home, at work, or any place else. 

•  The server must be at least 18 years old.  

•  You can ask the sheriff or a private process server to serve the papers, or ask a friend to 
serve the papers.  Private servers and the sheriff charge a fee to serve papers. If you have 
an In Forma Pauperis (IFP) order that covers service of process fees, the sheriff will serve

the  papers  within  the  county  at  no  cost  to  you.    You  must  deliver  to  the  sheriff  the 
Summons  and  Petition  and  the  IFP  order.  No  matter  who  serves  the  papers,  it  is  your 
responsibility to get the completed Affidavit of Personal Service from the server to file in 
your court file. If your spouse lives outside of your County, you must contact the sheriff 
in that county and ask if they will honor the IFP order from another county. 

•  Papers cannot be served on legal holidays.  Papers delivered on a legal holiday have not 

been legally served, and the case will be dismissed. 

•  Personal Service in another state or country: 

 

  Your spouse can be served by Personal Service anywhere in the United States, as 
long  as  the  papers  are  handed  directly  to  your  spouse.    If  your  spouse  lives  in 
another  country,  you  must  consult  a  lawyer  about  how  to  properly  serve  your 
spouse. Service in a foreign country must be done according to Minnesota Rules of 
Civil  Procedure  Rule  4.04  (c),  and  Minnesota  Statutes.    The  rules  for  serving 
someone in a foreign country can be very complex and court  employees 
cannot 
tell you how to serve your spouse in another country. 

How to Fill out the Affidavit of Personal Service: 

a.  Fill out the top part of the form the same way you did on your Summons.   

b.  On the blank line after “I,” fill in the name of the person who hand-delivered the forms to 

your spouse. 

c.  Fill in the date of birth of the person who hand-delivered the forms to your spouse. 

d.  Fill in the date that the documents were hand-delivered to your spouse. 

e.  Write  in  the  title  of  each  document  handed  to  your  spouse.  (Summons  and  Petition  for 

Dissolution of Marriage). 

f.  Fill in the name of your spouse.   

g.  The person who hand-delivered the forms to your spouse should date and sign the form, 
and then print the county and state where they were when they signed it, as well as their 
name, address, telephone number and email address. 

h.  After it  has been signed, make one copy of the completed Affidavit of Personal Service 

for your records. 

Service of Process Method #2:  Waiver of Service 

Rule 4.05 of the Rules of Civil Procedure says that a petitioner may ask that the respondent 
waive service of the Summons and Petition.  Generally, the respondent has a duty to avoid

causing the petitioner to have to pay unnecessary costs of serving the Summons and Petition on 
the respondent.   

o make this request, you will need to send or deliver to the other party the following forms: 

•  Summons; 

•  Petition; 

  T

•  Notice of Lawsuit and Request for Waiver of Service of Summons (CIV022A); 

•  Two copies of Waiver of Service of Summons (CIV022B); and 

•  A prepaid way (like a self-addressed, stamped envelope) for the respondent to return a 

signed copy of the Waiver (CIV022B) to you. 

These can be sent by first-class mail or other reliable means, such as email or social media.   

Warning:  If your spouse does not sign and return the Waiver of Service of Summons (CIV022B) 
to you, the papers are not served, and you must then use Personal Service or Alternate Service.   

If your spouse is in the United States, and does not return the Waiver of Service of Summons to 
you within 30 days, then the court will order the respondent to pay the costs of serving the 
divorce forms; there could be other costs as well.  For more details, see Rule 4.05 
(http://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/Appellate/Supreme%20Court/Court%20Rules/MN-
Rules-of-Civil-Procedure.pdf). 

Service of Process Method #3:  Alternate Service 

 

Use this method of service only if Personal Service and Waiver of Service have not or will not work 
because you cannot find your spouse.  If you have tried to serve your spouse by Personal Service but 
you cannot find your spouse, or your spouse is hiding to avoid service, you can ask the Court to allow 
you to serve the papers some other way.   Before you can use another method of service, you must 
prepare an Application for Service by Alternate Means and get an order signed by a judge.  The judge’s 
order will tell you what you have to do to serve the papers.  Frequently the order will include 
publishing in a newspaper, and you must pay the costs unless you have a fee waiver that covers 
publication costs.  

The Application for Service by Alternate Means must contain the following information: 

•  The last known address of the Respondent; 

•  The Petitioner’s most recent contacts with the Respondent; 

•  The last known location of the Respondent’s employment;

Fill Out the “Confidential Information” Form 11.1 
Fill Out the “Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents” Form 11.2 when 
necessary 

OTE! 

Most documents filed with the court are considered public documents and 
are available to the public.  Certain information that is filed with the court 
may be considered confidential based on court rule and not available to the 
public.  To keep this information confidential and not available to the public, 
you must take certain steps that are described below.   

The steps listed below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  Filers 
who are using eFS to submit their court documents must identify and 
designate their filings as required in Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 11.03 and 14.06.   

onfidential Information Form 11.1 

All social security numbers, employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers (also 
called “restricted identifiers”) must not be listed on papers you file with the court. This is to protect 
your privacy, the other parties and your children.   Only provide social security numbers, employer 
identification numbers, and financial account numbers when the court requires this information to 
be provided to the court.  For example, if you must provide the court with bank account numbers, 
or medical account numbers, do not include any account number in your document (your motion, 
supporting affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you must use Form 11.1 to list these confidential numbers.  

f account numbers are not required to be provided to the court, and the numbers appear on 
documents that are considered available to the public, (such as medical invoices or credit account 
numbers on statements) you must remove the number on the document before filing the document 
with the court. 

over Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-
public documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the 
time you file the documents with the court.  You must complete and file the “Cover Sheet for 
Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 (also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public

documents.  The most common non-public documents are called “financial source documents.”  
Examples of financial source documents include: 

•  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and business 

expenses 

•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers   

ou may also need to submit other documents that court rules identify as non-public documents, 
such as a medical record.  For example, a report from a doctor that provides a medical diagnosis or 
treatment plan for you or your child would qualify as a medical record.   

ou must use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing other non-public documents, such as medical 

records, with the court.  One Form 11.2 cover sheet can be used for submitting all non-public 
documents.   
  

The failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being rejected 
by court administration, being available to the public, stricken from the court record, 
and sanctions from the court.

Fill out the Certificate of Representation and Parties form (court form CIV102).  The purpose of 
this form is to tell the court where to send notices.  If either party has an attorney, the notices will 
be sent to the attorney.  If a party has no attorney, notices are sent directly to the party. 

This form is written for parties without attorneys.  The form informs the court that the parties are 
both  self-represented  and  gives  the  court  the  parties’  addresses  and  phone  numbers.    If  you  or 
your  spouse  has  an  attorney,  cross  out  “self-represented”  on  the  form  and  write  in  the  name, 
address, phone number and attorney I.D number INSTEAD of the address of the party whom the 
attorney represents. 

In filling out the form, DO NOT fill in the case number or date that the case was filed.  The Court 
Administrator will fill in that information after you file the form with the court. 

WARNING:  At this time you may not know if an attorney represents your spouse, or you may 
not know all the information requested about your spouse.  If you do not know all or some of the 
information  about  your  spouse,  write  “unknown.”    However,  the  law  requires  you,  as  the 
Petitioner,  to  provide  to  the  court  all  new  information  about  you  and  your  spouse  (addresses, 
phone numbers and whether an attorney represents you or your spouse) within seven (7) days of 
learning  this  new  information.  You  must  write  to  the  Court  Administrator  and  provide  this 
information.    All  letters  you  write  to  the  Court  Administrator  must  include  your  name,  your 
spouse’s name, and the case number.

Temporary Relief 

f  you  and  your  spouse  need  a  temporary  order  to  address  spousal  maintenance  or  any  other 
matter  in  the  divorce,  go  to  court  administrator’s  office  in  the  courthouse  and  ask  for  the  
“Temporary  Relief  Pending  Final  Hearing  without  Children”  forms  or  download  the  forms  at

for Temporary Relief: 
•  Summons 
•  Petition for Dissolution of Marriage 
•  Affidavit of Personal Service OR Waiver of Service of Summons 

he temporary order would be effective until the judge signs the final divorce order. 

Step 10 
Scheduling Statement 
The Scheduling Statement is only needed if your case is contested. Your case is contested if your 
spouse serves you with an Answer in response to your Petition.  If you receive a letter from the 
court telling you to file a Scheduling Statement follow the instructions in the letter and call the 
court  if  you  have  questions.  If  you  have  settled  the  case  with  your  spouse,  or  you  have  not 
received  an  Answer  from  your  spouse,  call  the  court  and  ask  if  you  still  need  to  file  the 
Scheduling Statement.  

Step 11 
The Next Step Is Determined by Your Spouse’s Response to

You and your spouse agree on all issues.  If you and your spouse agree on everything, 
go to Step 12 now for instructions on filling out the Stipulated Judgment and Decree. 

You receive an Answer from your spouse within 30 days of service of the Summons 
and Petition on your spouse.  

If your spouse served you with an Answer and Counterpetition, it means that your spouse 
does not agree with everything you have asked for in your Petition and that your spouse is 
asking for something different.  The first part of your spouse’s Answer will tell you the 
parts  of  your  Petition  with  which  your  spouse  partly  agrees,  totally  agrees,  or  totally 
disagrees. Once you know the issues about which you and you spouse disagree, you and 
your spouse should attempt to reach an agreement regarding those issues.  If you work out 
an agreement, go to Step 12 and fill out the Stipulated Judgment and Decree form. 

If you and your spouse DO NOT reach an agreement on all issues, your case is contested 
and  you  should  talk  to  a  lawyer.    Representing  yourself  in  a  contested  case  is  difficult.

Your spouse sends you a letter or files a letter (other than an Answer) with the court 
stating that he or she disagrees with your Petition.  

If your spouse disagrees with your Petition your spouse is supposed to serve you with a 
written  Answer  within  thirty  (30)  days  of  the  date  your  spouse  was  served  with  the 
Summons and Petition.  If your spouse does not serve you with an Answer within 30 days 
but  your  spouse  sends  you  a  written  response  such  as  a  letter  or  memo,  or  files  an 
informal  response  with  the  court,  then  you  need  to  give  your  spouse  one  more  notice* 
before the Court will grant the divorce.    

*  The  notice  is  called  Notice  of  Intent  to  Proceed  to  Judgment.    The  notice  can  be 
obtained from court administration.   

Your spouse does not respond with an Answer or any other writing. Your spouse has 
30  days  to  serve  you  with  a  formal  Answer  and  Counter  Petition,  stating  that  he/she 
disagrees with your Petition.  If your spouse does not serve you with an Answer and at 
least 50 days have passed since your spouse was served with the Summons and Petition, 
you  can  ask  the  court  for  a  “Default  Judgment.”    You  need  to  fill  out  the  Findings  of 
Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order for Judgment and Judgment and Decree (see Step 13), 
and Affidavit of Default, Affidavit of Non-Military Status, and Default Scheduling Request 
(see  Step  14).   50 days after your spouse was  served,  you  can  file  these  forms with the

You and Your Spouse Agree on All Issues  

f you and your spouse agree on all issues, fill out the Stipulated Findings of Fact, Conclusions of 
Law, Order for Judgment and Judgment and Decree form.  

Important Note:  The Stipulated Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order for Judgment and 
Judgment and Decree must be  signed and dated after the Petition is served on your spouse, or 
after your spouse signs a Waiver of Service of Summons.  Service of the Summons and Petition 
on your spouse starts the divorce action.  You and your spouse cannot settle the action until it has 
been  started  by  service  of  the  Summons  and  Petition.    If  the  Stipulated  Findings  of  Fact, 
Conclusions  of  Law,  Order  for  Judgment  and  Judgment  and  Decree  is  signed  before  the 
Summons and Petition are served, the judge will not sign the divorce Decree. 

The  Stipulated  Findings  of  Fact,  Conclusions  of  Law,  Order  for  Judgment  and  Judgment  and 
Decree form tells the court that you and your spouse have reached an agreement settling all of the 
issues involved in your divorce case.  It also tells the court the exact terms of the agreement.   

FILL IN THE ‘HEADING’ OF THE FORM WITH YOUR NAME, YOUR SPOUSE’S NAME 
AND THE CASE NUMBER. 

FILL IN THE INFORMATION ON PAGE 1 of the Stipulated Findings of Fact, Conclusions of 
Law, Order for Judgment and Judgment and Decree: 

At Paragraph B., check off whether you have or have not been represented by an attorney 
during your divorce  proceeding  and,  if you  have an attorney,  fill  in that person’s name.  
At Paragraph C., check off whether your spouse has or has not been represented by an 
attorney  during  this  divorce  proceeding  and,  if  your  spouse  has  an  attorney,  fill  in  the 
attorney’s name. 

At Paragraph D., write the date that your spouse was handed the Summons and Petition 
for  Dissolution  of  Marriage,  OR  the  date  your  spouse  signed  a  Waiver  of  Service  of 
Summons.  You  can  find  this  date  on  your  copy  of  the  Affidavit  of  Personal  Service  or 
Waiver  of  Service  of  Summons,  OR  the  dates  your  spouse  was  served  by  mail  or 
publication. 

At  Paragraph  E.,  check  the  YES  box  ONLY  if  your  spouse  served  you  with  a  written 
Answer and Counterpetition.  If you received a written Answer from your spouse, then fill 
in the date that you received the Answer and Counterpetition.

Judgment and Decree, and you and/or your spouse should know all the answers.

This means you and your spouse agree that your marriage should be dissolved.  You do 
not need to write anything here. 

You must check a box to state who will pay for health and dental insurance for you and 
your spouse, after the divorce is finalized.  If you want you and your spouse to each pay 
your  own  health  and  dental  insurance  costs,  check  box  (a).    Box  (c)  is  for  COBRA 
coverage.  Check with the employer of the person who has coverage for information on 
how to get COBRA coverage. Box (d) is to “reserve” a decision on who would pay for 
the  medical  and  dental  insurance.  If  you  check  (d),  then  after  the  divorce  is  complete, 
either  you  or  your  spouse  could  file  a  motion  with  the  court  asking  for  an  order  to  be 
made about the insurance.  If you have other questions, or if the boxes provided do not 
explain what you want the court to order, ask an attorney for help. 

Check box (a) if there will not be any spousal maintenance paid to either party. Carefully 
read the language about waiver. If you check (a), you are saying that neither you nor your 
spouse  can  ever  get  spousal  maintenance,  regardless  what  happens  in  the  future.    You 
also must check one or more boxes under the statement “Consideration for this agreement 
is:”. Here, you are being asked to say how it is a fair agreement between you, for both of 
you  to  waive  maintenance  payments.  Is  it  fair  because  you  are  both  able  to  support 
yourselves? You need to provide the reasons.  Also, to give up all claims to maintenance, 
there  must  be  complete  openness  by  both  spouses  about  their  financial  situation.  You 
must be able to tell the Judge that you fully disclosed to each other everything about your 
finances  and  property  before  deciding  to  waive  spousal  maintenance.    Check  (b)  if  you 
want  to  reserve  maintenance.  With  this  option,  no  payments  would  be  ordered  at  this 
time. But either of you could ask the court to order maintenance in the future, by filing a 
motion.   Check (c)  and provide the requested information if you have an agreement for

be paid temporarily, until a certain date or event. 

List all of the vehicles and who will receive each vehicle.  Attach another sheet of paper if 
you need more space than provided. 

If  you  and  your  spouse  have  already  divided  the  marital  property  to  your  mutual 
satisfaction, then check “As currently divided” and do not list any property.  If there are 
specific  items  to  be  divided,  check  “as  follows,”  and  list  the  marital  property  you  will 
receive and the marital property your spouse will receive. 

If  you  and  your  spouse  have  already  divided  the  non-marital  property  to  your  mutual 
satisfaction, then check “as currently divided” and do not list any property.  If there are 
specific  items  to  be  divided,  check  “As  follows,”  and  list  the  non-marital  property  you 
will receive and the non-marital property your spouse will receive. 

List which assets at  #22 above  (cash and investments)  you  will receive and which your 
spouse will receive. 

State how any business will be divided. 

If you have a manufactured home, answer the questions about how it will be awarded. 

Check  off  whether  you  (Petitioner)  or  your  spouse  (Respondent)  will  be  awarded  the 
homestead (if you and your spouse own one), and then list the street address, city, county, 
and state where the homestead is located, and then write the exact legal description. 

If  you  and  your  spouse  own  other  real  property  either  separately  or  together,  check  off 
whether you (Petitioner) or your spouse (Respondent) will be awarded that real property, 
and then list the street address, city, county, and state where the homestead is located, and 
then write the exact legal description. Attach another sheet of paper if there is more than 
one additional parcel of real estate. 

Describe exactly how  your pension, profit sharing, retirement, IRA, or 401 plan will be 
divided. It can be awarded 100% to one person, or divided. If you are dividing a qualified 
benefit retirement plan, you will need another document called a QDRO. The QDRO is 
not available from the court.  Contact the employer benefits unit or an attorney for more 
information about QDROs. 

Describe exactly how your spouse’s pension, profit sharing, retirement, IRA, or 401 plans 
will be divided.  

In question 27 you listed all of the debts you and your spouse have.  Check box (a) and 
list all of these debts again, and write the name of the person who will be responsible for 
paying  the debt. Also  check box (b). This covers  any  debts that  were  not disclosed and 
that in one person’s name alone, and says the person who took on the debt must pay it.

If  your  name  will  be  changed,  print  exactly  how  your  new  name  will  be  listed  (first, 
middle,  and  last).  Do  not  use  initials  unless  you  want  only  an  initial  instead  of  a  full 
name.  If your spouse’s name will be changed, print exactly how your spouse’s new name 
will be listed (first, middle, and last). Do not use initials unless your spouse wants only an 
initial instead of a full name.

If there is anything else you and your spouse want the court to order, state it here. 

16.  You do not need to write anything for paragraphs 16 and 17, but they contain important 
information and you should read them. After the divorce is final, the Petitioner must serve 
a copy of the signed and entered Judgment and Decree on the Respondent. Paragraph 17 
tells how to do this.  

Signing the Stipulated Judgment and Decree 

•  Do  not sign the Stipulated Judgment  and Decree unless the  Summons and Petition 
have been served on your spouse.  Check off whether you are or are not represented 
by an attorney. If you are represented by an attorney, the attorney signs the agreement 
and  fills  in  his  or  her  name,  address,  phone  number  and  attorney  identification 
number.  If  you  are  not  represented  by  an  attorney,  sign  the  Petitioner’s  Waiver  of 
Counsel.   

•  Once you have signed the Stipulated Judgment and Decree, mail or hand-deliver it to 
your  spouse  for  your  spouse  to  sign.  Make  sure  a  document  called  Respondent’s 
Waiver of Counsel is attached to the Stipulated Judgment and Decree. Your spouse 
must sign both the Stipulated Judgment and Decree and the Respondent’s Waiver of 
Counsel.  Your  spouse  should  make  a  copy  of  the  signed  Stipulated  Judgment  and 
Decree  and  attached  Waiver  for  his/her  records,  and  then  return  the  signed 
documents to you.  

•  Make  a  copy  of  the  Stipulated  Judgment  and  Decree  for  your  records.  Then  go  to

File the Remaining Papers 

When to File 

If you have a Stipulated Judgment and Decree:       
You can file as soon as you have all the papers completed.

your spouse did not respond: 
You can file 71 days after the first date the Summons was published and/or 71 days after 
the Summons and Petition were mailed to your spouse.

disagreeing with your Petition or filed such a letter with the court. 

 You can file at the time indicated in # 1-3 above, if it has also been at least thirteen (13) days 
since you mailed to your spouse the Notice of Intent to Proceed to Judgment.  

See Step 15 for information on what documents must be filed to complete the divorce. 

What to File 

Where to File 

File  the  papers  with  court  administration.  Going  to  the  Courthouse  to  file  your  papers  is

explained and possibly corrected immediately. Papers may be filed by mailing them to the Court 
Administrator. 

Step 15 
Filing Your Documents 
If  your  spouse  served  you  with  an  Answer,  your  case  is  contested  and  Step  15  does  not 
apply to you.

9.  Notice  of  Intent  to  Proceed  to  Judgment,  with  attached  Affidavit  of  Service  of  the  

Notice of Intent 

See Step 14 for information on where to file the above papers. 

Step 16 
After You Receive the Decree from the Court Administrator’s Office 

s Petitioner, it is your responsibility to serve Respondent with a copy of the Divorce Decree 

after it is signed by the judge and entered by the court administrator.  

If  you  and  Respondent  signed  a  Stipulated  Judgment  and  Decree  it  states  that  service  of  the 
Judgment and Decree can be  made by mail. Have someone, other than you,  who  is at least 18 
years of age, mail to your spouse a copy of the Decree you obtained from the court.  The Decree 
must  be  sent  by  first  class  U.S.  mail  with  sufficient  postage,  addressed  to  your  spouse’s  home 
address.  If you do not have an address for your spouse, address the envelope to your spouse’s 
last known address. The person who mails the Decree to your spouse must fill out the Affidavit of 
Service by Mail, and return it to you. You then file the Affidavit of Service by Mail with the court. 

If you and your spouse did not sign a Stipulated Judgment and Decree, someone else, at least 18 
years of age, must serve the Judgment and Decree on your spouse by handing it to your spouse. 

The  server  must  fill  out  the  Affidavit  of  Personal  Service  form  and  return  it  to  you.    File  the 
Affidavit  with  the  court  to  prove  that  you  served  your  spouse  with  the  Decree.    Serving  your 
spouse with the Decree helps prove your spouse knew what was ordered, in case you need to ask 
the court to enforce the order through a contempt motion. 

You can file the Affidavit of Service in person or by mail with the Court Administrator. 

OTHER STEPS AFTER ENTRY OF THE DECREE   
It is the responsibility of the parties to take all necessary steps to put into effect the orders of the 
court. For example, if you changed your name you will need to get your driver’s license and 
social security card changed to reflect your new legal name. If you or Respondent were awarded 
pension or medical benefits, the company or provider will need to see the Decree and may have 
other requirements before making the changes ordered by the court. If you and/or Respondent 
own real estate, there are additional steps you must take to transfer the title to the real estate to 
the party who was granted the real estate in the Decree.

Under Minnesota law, both spouses have an interest in real estate, even if only one spouse’s 
name is on the deed or title of the property.  

roof of divorce and proof of who was awarded interests in the real estate is usually recorded 

in the real estate records before selling or mortgaging the property after the divorce. 

o give that proof, the complete divorce decree can be filed in the real estate records. Or, a short 

version of the divorce decree can be filed, called Summary Real Estate Disposition Judgment 
Form (SREDJ). The SREDJ only includes information needed for real estate title purposes. If 
you file the SREDJ, information about your children, work, and other personal matters is not 
available in the county real estate records.  The Minnesota Judicial Branch publishes a set of 
instructions to help you with the SREDJ process. Those instructions can be found on the court’s 
website at http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=15&f=572.
