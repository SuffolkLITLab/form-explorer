General Information about Requesting an Order to Show Cause 

he information in these instructions is a general guide to explain the legal process for 

requesting an Order to Show Cause in a judgment debtor disclosure matter. You can use this 
process if it has been 10 days (or 13 days if served by mail) since the Order for Disclosure and 
blank Financial Disclosure Form was served on the judgment debtor and the judgment debtor 
has failed to return the completed Financial Disclosure Form to you. You can also use this 
process if the judgment debtor returned the Financial Disclosure Form on time but it was 
incomplete. If you have not gone through the process of requesting an Order for Financial 
Disclosure, please visit www.mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Judgments.aspx to learn how.  

You can find more information about orders to show cause in judgment debtor disclosure matters 
in Minn. Stat. § 588.04 (www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/588.04).  

You can find more information about judgment debtor disclosure requirements in Minn. Stat. § 
491A.02, subd. 9 (www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/491A.02) and in Minn. Stat. § 550.011 
(www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/550.011).  

When you file an Affidavit in Support of Order to Show Cause: 

•  There may or may not be a hearing about your Affidavit (whether the judgment debtor 

returned the Financial Disclosure Form to you). 

If the court grants your requests: 

•  The court will issue an Order to Show Cause requiring the judgment debtor to go to a 
hearing and explain why they did not return the Financial Disclosure Form to you.   

•  You will receive: 

o  The Order to Show Cause to serve on the judgment debtor and  
o  An Order to Show Cause Instructions for you. 

At the Order to Show Cause Hearing: 

•  The judgment debtor may be able to fill out a Financial Disclosure Form at the hearing. 
•  You must attend the hearing.  Check with Court Administration to see if you are 
allowed to participate remotely, either by telephone or some other technology.  
If the judgment debtor does not go to the hearing, the court may issue a bench warrant for 
the judgment debtor’s arrest. 

• 

Definitions 

•  “Judgment” is a word that means “the judge’s decision” or “the judge’s order.” 
•  “Judgment creditor” is the party who won the case and is owed money (because a 

judgment was awarded by the court).

•  “Judgment debtor” is the party who lost the case and owes money to the judgment 

creditor. 

•  “Entry” or “Entered” is the word used when a judgment is filed in the case by the 

Court Administrator. This usually starts the timeframe during which a judgment can be 
appealed. 

•  “Docketed” or “Docketing” is the word used when the judgment creditor files an 

Affidavit of Identification form with the court. Docketing the judgment is the first step a 
judgment creditor takes when he or she wants to try to collect payment of the judgment. 

f you do not understand any of the following steps or do not know if these forms are right 
for your situation, you should speak with an attorney for legal advice. Court staff cannot 
give legal advice.

You can find the information needed for the caption on any official court document from your 
case. 

A.  Fill in the county where the judgment was docketed.  

B.  Fill in the Judicial District for the county where the judgment was docketed. If you do 
not know the Judicial District, you can find a map with all of the Judicial Districts at 
http://www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx.  

 

Fill in the Court File Number from the case where the judgment was docketed. 
Sometimes the court assigns a new Court File Number when a judgment is docketed (for 
example, the Court File Number will be different for a Conciliation Court case where a 
judgment was entered than for the District Court case opened to docket the judgment). Be 
sure to enter the Court File Number for the case where the judgment was docketed. 

Fill in the case type. This will generally be “Civil,” but in some cases it could also be 
something like “Restitution Judgment,” “Dissolution,” or “Support.” If you don’t know 
the case type, look at your court documents to find the information. 

C.  Fill in the full name of the Plaintiff. 

D.  Fill in the full name of the Defendant.

4.  Fill in the name of the judgment debtor. 

5.  Sign and date the Affidavit in Support of Order to Show Cause with your name, address, 
telephone number, and email address. Write in the county and state where the form was 
signed. As a reminder, if you are a business or an organization, you must be represented 
by a lawyer. 

When you sign the Affidavit, you are signing under penalty of perjury.  This means you 
are saying that everything in the form is true and correct; if you know something in the 
form is not true when you sign it, you could be found guilty of the crime of perjury (see 
Minn. Stat. § 609.48, https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.48).  

Step 2 

File the Affidavit in Support of Order to Show Cause (JGM303) 
where the Judgment was docketed. 

ile the completed and signed Affidavit in Support of Order to Show Cause where the Judgment 
was docketed. Court Administration will give the affidavit to a judge for review. If approved, a 
hearing will be scheduled and a signed Order to Show Cause will be given to you. The judge 
may not always be immediately available to review requests, so you may receive the order in the 
mail. The judgment debtor must be served with the order (see Step 3 below).

Service of Process Fee  

If you cannot afford the cost of having a sheriff serve the Order to Show Cause on the judgment 
debtor (see Step 3 below), you can ask the court to waive the fee. The application for a fee waiver 
is available online at https://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=19&p=69. File your fee waiver 
application with the court at the same time you file your Affidavit in Support of Order to Show 
Cause, or shortly after.   
 

Serve the Order to Show Cause on the Judgment Debtor at least 7 
days before the hearing.  

Step 3 

 

Once you receive the Order to Show Cause, you have to arrange for the judgment debtor to be 
personally served with a copy of the order. You cannot do this yourself. The order must be 
served by a sheriff’s office or other law enforcement agency. See Step 2 above for information 
about requesting a fee waiver if you cannot afford the sheriff’s service of process fee. 

Service and Filing Deadline: At least 7 days before the hearing. 

Remember, you must serve the judgment debtor and file the completed Affidavit of Personal 
Service at least 7 days before the hearing date. (NOTE: the sheriff’s office or law enforcement 
agency may file the Affidavit of Personal Service for you). To figure out the service and filing 
deadline: the day before the hearing is Day 1.  Counting backwards.  For example, if the hearing 
date is January 30, the Order to Show Cause must be served on or before January 23.  If January 
23 is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday (as defined in Minn. Stat. § 645.44, subd. 5), then keep 
counting backwards to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. 

Step 4 

Order to Show Cause Hearing.  

f the judgment debtor responds and gives you the required information before the hearing, you 
must call Court Administration to cancel the hearing. If the judgment debtor fails to respond or 
provide you with the required information, or if you think the information provided is wrong, 
you must attend the hearing.   

You can ask Court Administration if you are allowed to participate remotely, either by telephone 
or some other technology. If you fail to appear at the hearing, the Order to Show Cause may be 
vacated and you will have to start the process over by filing a new Request for Order for 
Disclosure Form with the court.  

On the day of the hearing, the judgment debtor will be expected to fill out the Financial 
Disclosure Form.  If that happens, you will get the completed form and then you can decide how

you can/will proceed with collecting the debt. If you need help with options for trying to collect 
the debt, you can visit a Self-Help Center walk-in location or call the Statewide Self-Help Center 
at (651) 435-6535 for additional information. 

If the judgment debtor fails to appear at the Order to Show Cause hearing, you may request the 
judge issue a bench warrant for the judgment debtor’s arrest.
