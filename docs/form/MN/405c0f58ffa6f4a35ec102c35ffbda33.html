ho May Intervene as a Matter of Right (Automatically) 

Certain  people  have  an  automatic  right  to  intervene  as  a  party  in  a  child  protection  case.    Unless  an 
existing party objects, the people listed below will be granted party status simply by providing notice of 
intervention to the court and other parties:

and that you need a date, time, room number, and address for a hearing.  The hearing date must

2.  Also ask court administration for a list of the names and addresses of all parties and attorneys 
involved in the case so that you can notify them of the date, time, and location of the hearing.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
