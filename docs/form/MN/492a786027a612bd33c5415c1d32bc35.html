urpose of the Financial Affidavit 

In all cases where the court will decide or modify child support, the parents must serve and file a 
Financial Affidavit to disclose all sources of income for determining child support for the joint child or 
children of the parents.   

 joint child means the dependent child of both parents in the child support proceeding.  Information 

listed in the Financial Affidavit will provide the court with information needed to calculate child 
support.  

erving and Filing the Financial Affidavit 

The Financial Affidavit must be served on the other party, and the public authority if the public 
authority is providing child support enforcement services, and filed with the court when initial 
pleadings or motions are submitted by a party.  You must include proof of your income, such as pay 
stubs and income tax returns. 

eeping your financial information confidential 

NOTE! 

Most documents filed with the court are considered public documents and are available to 
the public.  Certain information that is filed with the court may be considered confidential 
based on court rule and not available to the public.  To keep this information confidential 
and not available to the public, you must take certain steps that are described below.   

The steps listed below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  Filers who are using 
eFS to submit their court documents must identify and designate their filings as required 
in Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 11.03 and 14.06. 

onfidential Information Form 11.1 

All social security numbers, employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers (also 
called “restricted identifiers”) must not be listed on papers you file with the court. This is to protect 
your privacy, the other parties and your children.   Only provide social security numbers, employer 
identification numbers, and financial account numbers when the court requires this information to be 
provided to the court.  For example, if you must provide the court with bank account numbers, or 
medical account numbers, do not include any account number in your document (your motion, 
supporting affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you must use Form 11.1 to list these confidential numbers.  

If account numbers are not required to be provided to the court, and the numbers appear on documents 
that are considered available to the public, (such as medical invoices or credit account numbers on 
statements) you must remove the number on the document before filing the document with the court.

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-public 
documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the time you file the 
documents with the court.  You must complete and file the “Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2” 
(also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public documents.  The most common non-public 
documents are called “financial source documents.”  Examples of financial source documents include: 

•  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and business expenses 
•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers   

You may also need to submit other documents that court rules identify as non-public documents, such 
as a medical record.  For example, a report from a doctor that provides a medical diagnosis or 
treatment plan for you or your child would qualify as a medical record.   

You must use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing other non-public documents, such as medical 
records, with the court.  One Form 11.2 cover sheet can be used for submitting all non-public 
documents.   

The failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being rejected by 
court administration, being available to the public, stricken from the court record, and 
sanctions from the court. 

See Rule 11 of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice for more information about how to file documents 
containing social security numbers, financial account numbers, “financial source documents” and other non-
public documents.   

Form 11.1 and Form 11.2 can be found at www.mncourts.gov/forms under the court forms category of 
“Confidential Information” and is court form number CON111 and CON112.

•  The court will determine a parent’s income based on credible evidence, which may include 
documentation of current or recent income, testimony of the other parent concerning recent 
earnings and income levels, or wage reports filed with the Department of Employment and 
Economic Development. The court may determine potential income for a parent if a parent is 
voluntarily unemployed or underemployed, employed less than a full-time, or when there is no 
evidence of any income. 
If the court decides that a parent did not have access to documents to complete the financial 
affidavit, the court may consider testimony by that parent as credible evidence of income.
