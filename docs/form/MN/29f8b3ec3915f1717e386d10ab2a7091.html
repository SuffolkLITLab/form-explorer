IMPORTANT NOTICES 

 

 

THE COURT EXPECTS EVERY PERSON WHO APPEARS IN COURT WITHOUT A 
LAWYER TO KNOW AND FOLLOW THE LAW.  IF YOU ACT AS YOUR OWN 
LAWYER, YOU MUST DO WHAT A LAWYER WOULD DO. 

COURT PERSONNEL AND THE  COUNTY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE CANNOT HELP YOU 
FILL OUT THE FORM(S) IN THIS PACKET. 

YOU  SHOULD  SEE  A  LAWYER  IF  YOU  DON'T  KNOW  HOW  TO  ANSWER  THE 
QUESTIONS ON THESE FORMS OR IF YOU THINK THE OTHER PARTY WILL HIRE A 
LAWYER. 

AS  YOU  FILL  OUT  THE  FORM(S)  IN  THIS  PACKET  YOU  MUST  FOLLOW  THE 
INSTRUCTIONS. 

TYPE YOUR ANSWERS OR PRINT NEATLY USING DARK INK. 

he other party has filed Contempt of Court papers with the Court alleging that you have failed to obey 

the Court’s order and further alleging that you are in Contempt of Court. 

You have the right to be represented by an attorney if you are being accused of Contempt of Court.  You 
may have an attorney appointed by the court to represent you at no cost to you if you are financially 
eligible.  To find out if you qualify for a court-appointed attorney, ask the Court Administrator for an 
application for a court-appointed attorney. 
 

What “Contempt of Court” Means 

 

nly a judge can determine whether someone is in "Contempt of Court."  "Contempt of Court" is a 

decision by a judge that someone who has been ordered to do something knew about the Order, and has 
knowingly and without good reason disobeyed the Order.  Because a judge can order the contemnor (the 
person who disobeyed) to be put in jail until he or she obeys the Order, extra safeguards are built into 
the procedures to ensure that the person who might be put in jail is treated fairly.

Two-Part Hearing Process Required 

he court cannot put you in jail simply because the other party says that you disobeyed a court order.  In 

most cases, there will be several hearings. 
 

I.  FIRST-STAGE HEARING  

t the first hearing the court will decide if: 

1.  You knew the contents of the prior Order: 
2.   You disobeyed the prior Order, but had a good reason for disobeying it; OR 
3.  You disobeyed the prior Order and did not have a good reason for disobeying. 

If the court decides that you obeyed the Order or that you disobeyed the order but had a good reason for 
disobeying it, then the motion for contempt will be denied.  Even if a request for contempt of court is 
denied, the court may still grant other relief that is appropriate to the case, such as requiring the person to 
pay money, cooperate in visitation, follow future court orders, etc. 

If the court decides that you disobeyed the prior Order and did not have a good reason for disobeying it, 
and if the court also decides that putting you in jail will make you obey the Order, the court must tell 
you that incarceration is a possibility, advise you to obtain an attorney, and explain that if you cannot 
afford an attorney, one will be appointed. 

If you tell the judge that you want to speak with an attorney, a second hearing will be scheduled.  If you 
waive your right to an attorney, the court may conduct the hearing at that time.  The court may not 
punish you and put you in jail for not following the Order because that would be a criminal matter.  The 
court may only put you in jail if the court believes that you have the ability to do what is ordered and that 
you have willfully refused to do it, and that putting you in jail will cause you to obey the prior Order. 

If the court finds that you knew the contents of the prior Order, willfully failed to follow it, and that jail 
or the threat of jail may reasonably cause compliance with the court Order, the court may immediately 
sentence you to jail, or may “stay” (not immediately enforce) the jail sentence to give you time to 
“purge” (correct) the prior behavior by doing what the prior court Order required.  The court may also 
require you to do other things, such as pay money, cooperate in visitation, follow future court Orders, 
etc. 

II.  REVOCATION HEARING  

If the court sentences you to jail, but gives you a chance to purge (cure) the contempt, and you do not do 
what you were supposed to do cure the problem, the other party may wish to have you jailed.  In order to 
do that, certain forms asking for a hearing for revocation of the stay must be served upon (given to you) 
and filed with the court. 

t the revocation hearing, the court will decide one of the following: 

  T

Page 3 of 8 

1.  You have purged (cured) the contempt; OR 
2.  You have not purged (cured) the contempt, but jailing you is not necessary to  cause obedience 

and, therefore, you will not be jailed; OR 

3.  You have not purged (cured) the contempt, and jailing you is likely to make you obey the Order 

and, therefore, you should be immediately jailed. 

f the court decides to order you to jail, you must stay in jail until you purge the contempt by obeying the 
court Order (for example, by paying overdue support, or allowing visitation, or agreeing to follow all 
future court orders).  It is often said that the person in jail "holds the keys to the jail" because that person 
controls when he or she is released. 
                                

INSTRUCTIONS 

 

Step 1

court and the other party that you do not believe you are in contempt of court. 

FILL IN THE TOP PART OF THE FORM (this is known as "the caption"): 

NOTE:  The information to fill in the top part of the form can be found at the top of your Divorce 
or Paternity Decree or other existing Order.  Be sure to copy the information EXACTLY as it is on 
your current Order. 

Write the name of the county where your case is located, the number of the judicial district for 
that county, and the case number that is also called the "court file number."  This information is

current Order or Divorce or Paternity Decree. 

On the line marked "Name of Respondent," write the name of the Respondent as listed on the 
current Order or Divorce or Paternity Decree.

NOTE:  The following instructions are numbered the same as the questions on the Notice of 
Motion and Responsive Motion form. 

1.  On the first line of paragraph/question 1, write the name of the other party.  On the second line, write 

the date of the Order that the other party claims you have disobeyed. 

2.  You do not need to answer this question. 

3.  Read the Verification and Acknowledgement carefully. 

By signing your name you are telling the court that you are telling the truth and that you have a 
good faith reason for your requests.  If you are not telling the truth or if you are misleading the 
court or if you are serving or filing this document for an improper purpose, the court can order 
you to pay money to the other party or impose other sanctions. 

DATE AND SIGN THE NOTICE OF MOTION AND RESPONSIVE MOTION FORM. 
 

Step 2 
Fill Out the Affidavit in Support of Responsive Motion Form 

ill out the Affidavit in Support of Responsive Motion form that tells the court and the other party what 

you are asking for from the court and WHY you are asking for it. 

Fill in the top part of the form (caption) the same way you did on the Notice of Motion and Responsive 
Motion form. 

NOTE:  The following instructions are numbered the same as the questions on the Affidavit in 
Support of Responsive Motion form. 

Write in your name on the blank line above paragraph/question 1. 

Check off whether you are the Petitioner or Respondent in this case as listed on your Divorce 
Decree or other existing Order.   

The other party is telling the court that you have violated a court Order.  Check off whether you 
did or did not receive a copy of that court Order prior to receiving the other person's court papers 
to find you in contempt.  Write in the date of the specific court Order.  This is in 
paragraph/question 1 of the other party’s Motion.  If the other party is claiming you violated more 
than one order, add additional lines to answer question 3 regarding each separate Order or 
Decree. 

  F

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

Check either (a) or (b): 

a. 

Check (a) if you believe you obeyed the Order and then on lines tell the court exactly 
what you did to obey the order (include dates, check numbers, or other information that 
may prove to the court that you obeyed the Order).  If the other party is claiming you 
disobeyed more than one Order, add additional lines or pages to answer 4(a) and 4(b) 
with regard to each Order or Decree. 

DIV1501  State 

ENG 

Rev 1/20 

 

www.mncourts.gov/forms 

Page 5 of 8 

b. 

Check (b) if you did not obey the Order but had a good reason for not obeying the Order 
and then on lines tell the Court your reason for not obeying the Order. 

If the other party is claiming you have violated a court Order that involves your ability to pay an 
obligation, such as child support or spousal maintenance, you may wish to consider using the 
Parenting / Financial Disclosure Statement form (form number FAM108).  If you do use the 
Parenting / Financial Disclosure Statement form, you should serve and file the form with the 
court at or before the contempt hearing.  The form can be found at the Court Administrator’s 
Office or at www.mncourts.gov/forms.   

Sign the Affidavit in Support of Responsive Motion under penalty of perjury.  By signing your name 
under penalty of perjury, you are telling the court that you are telling the truth and that you have a good 
faith reason for your requests. If you are filing these documents just to harass the other party or without 
good legal reason, or if you mislead the court, the court can make you pay money to the other party.  
Perjury is the crime of intentionally lying or misrepresenting the truth, punishable by jail or other 
sanctions. 
 

Step 3 
Make Copies of Forms 

Make two copies of the Notice of Motion and Responsive Motion form and all attachments, and 
two copies of your Affidavit in Support of Responsive Motion form and all attachments. 

Keep one copy of each form for yourself (make sure to bring your copies with you to Court on 
the day of your hearing). 

Step 4 tells you how to give the second copy of each form to the other party.  Step 6 tells you 
how to file the forms with the court. 

If the other party is represented 
by an attorney, serve the other 
party’s attorney, instead of the 
party directly. 

Step 4 
Serve Notice on the Other Party 

The other party must receive complete copies of all documents 
you have prepared for the hearing. This is called "service of 
process." The papers can be served personally (handed to the 
other party), or by mail. If papers are served by mail, Court Rules 
require adding three days. Papers cannot be served on a legal 
holiday as defined in Minn. Stat. § 645.44, subd. 5 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44#stat.645.44.5).

Affidavit in Response to Motion, Parenting/Financial Disclosure Statement (if applicable), and one copy 
of any and all attachments.  

•  The server must give the papers to the other party (or their attorney, if they have one) at least 7 

days before the hearing date.  For example, if the hearing date is January 30, the server must give 
the papers to the other party on or before January 23.   If January 23 is a legal holiday, the papers 
must be served on the next day that is not a legal holiday.  

•  Note:  If your responsive Motion raises new issues not addressed by the other party’s Notice of 
Motion and Motion, your responsive papers must be served at least 14 days before the hearing.

•  Note:  If your Responsive Motion raises new issues not addressed in the other party’s Notice of 
Motion and Motion, the Responsive papers must be mailed at least 17 days before the hearing. 

WARNING:  IF YOUR FORMS ARE NOT HAND-DELIVERED OR MAILED TO THE OTHER 
PARTY (OR HIS/HER ATTORNEY) ON TIME, THE COURT MAY DISREGARD YOUR

Step 6 
File the Forms with the Court 

t least 7 days before the hearing date, file the following documents with the Court Administrator.  If 
your papers raise new issues not included in the other party’s Notice of Motion and Motion, you must 
file the papers with the court at least 14 days before the hearing date.  You can mail them to the court, 
but you must allow 3 extra days for mailing.  Put them in the mail at least 10 days before the hearing (or 
17 days before the hearing if the papers raise new issues).   

•  The Notice of Motion and Responsive Motion and all attachments; 
•  The Affidavit in Support of Responsive Motion and all attachments; 
•  The Parenting/Financial Disclosure Statement and all attachments (if applicable); and 
•  The Affidavit of Service. 

There may be a filing fee due when you file your paperwork. Contact court administration to find out the 
amount of the filing fee.  You can make checks payable to “District Court.”  

If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can ask for a fee waiver by completing the forms in the In 
Forma Pauperis/IFP packet of forms (found online at 
http://www.mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=19&p=69). If a judge does not sign the fee waiver order, 
then you must pay the motion fee before Court Administration can process your forms. 
 

 

Step 7 
Appear in Court 

ou must go to court on the date set for the hearing.  Be sure to be on time.  Bring with you to the 
hearing your copies of the papers and any witnesses you want to talk to the judge.  The hearing is very 
formal.  You should be polite to everyone in the courtroom, and address the judge “your honor”.  
Remember to talk to the judge, not the other party.  Do not argue with the other party or be unnecessarily 
critical of the other party.  After the hearing, the judge will issue an order.  The judge may issue the order 
at the end of the hearing or may send a copy of the order to you in the mail.
