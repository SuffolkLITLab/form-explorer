General Information 

What is the purpose of a Guardianship for At-Risk Juvenile? 

A federal immigration  law allows juveniles to seek Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS) if they are 
in the United States without status and are considered at-risk (abused, neglected, or abandoned).  
In order to seek SIJS, the juvenile needs a Court to determine that they are an at-risk juvenile and 
establish a guardianship for them.  The at-risk juvenile must be between the ages of 18  and 21 and 
must not be married. 

According to Minn. Stat. § 257D.02,  the purpose of the guardianship is to provide an at-risk juvenile 
with guidance, assistance, financial  and emotional support, and referrals to resources necessary to: 

1.  Meet the at-risk juvenile’s needs, which include but are not limited to: 

•  Shelter; 
•  Nutrition; 
•  Access to and receipt of psychiatric, psychological, medical, dental, educational, 

occupational, or other services; 

AND/OR 

2.  Protect the at-risk juvenile from sex or labor trafficking or domestic or sexual violence. 

Do you have all the information you need to fill out the forms? 

The Petition for Guardianship of At-Risk Juvenile (GAC902) asks for the following information: 

• 

Information about you, including your name, date of birth, current address, marital status, and 
country of nationality or last habitual residence. 
Information about the Proposed Guardian. 
Information about other cases (guardianships, juvenile court cases, family court cases). 

• 
• 
•  Your parents’ names, addresses, and country of nationality or last habitual residence.

Step 1 
Fill Out Petition for Guardianship of At-Risk Juvenile (GAC902) 

The Caption 

The caption is found at the top of the form.   

 

A.  List the county where you will  be filing  your Guardianship for At-Risk Juvenile case.   

NOTE: You must file in the county where you or the Proposed Guardian lives.  If you are not 
sure where you should file, please talk to an attorney (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Find-a-
Lawyer.aspx).  Court staff cannot tell you where to file your case. 

B.  List the Judicial District.  Each county belongs in one of ten judicial  districts.  If you need help, 

see http://www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx.   

C.  Leave the line for Court File Number blank.  Court Administration will  assign a Court File 

Number later. 

The Case Type (Guardianship – At-Risk Juvenile) has been filled in for you. 
Fill  in your full name (first, middle, and last) on the line for Petitioner.  As the at-risk juvenile 
asking the Court to appoint a guardian, you are the Petitioner. 

D.  Fill  in the full name of the Proposed Guardian. 

The Petition 

In Section 1, you will  give information about yourself. 

In Section 2, you will  give information about the Proposed Guardian. 

Section 3 asks you to explain why you would like the Proposed Guardian to be your guardian. 

Section 4 is about “best interests.”  The form asks you to explain why it is in your best interests that 
the Proposed Guardian be your guardian. 

Section 5 asks for information about other court cases (guardianship cases, family court cases, and 
juvenile court cases) you are involved in, if any.

GAC901      State       ENG 

8/22-D               www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 3 of 8 

In Section 6, you will  give information about your parents.  In the petition, your parents are referred 
to as “Parent 1” and “Parent 2.” 

• 

In #16, if it is not appropriate for you to reunify with Parent 1, check the box at “a” and 
explain why you should not reunify with that parent. 

•  Check the box at “b” if it is not appropriate for you to reunify with Parent 2, and explain why. 

Section 7 is where you can give the court other information you think would be helpful for the court 
to know (and that is not already asked about). 

Requests for Relief 

1.  Fill  in the name of the Proposed Guardian. 

2.  According to Minnesota law (Minn. Stat. § 257D.06,  revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/257D.06), you 
are supposed to make sure your parents have a copy of your Petition for Guardianship of At-Risk 
Juvenile at least 14  days before the hearing that Court Administration  will schedule in this case.   

The law says you can do this “in any manner and format reasonably calculated to give the 
parent adequate notice.”  Examples of ways to get a copy of the petition to your parents include 
(but are not limited to) mailing  it to them, handing it to them, faxing it to them, or emailing it to 
them. 

However, the judicial officer may waive this notice requirement in certain situations.  For 
example, when you do not know who one of your parents is, or you do not know where a 
parent lives. 

If you want to ask the Court to waive the parental notice requirement, check the first box in #2, 
and then check which parent this applies to (Parent 1, Parent 2, or both).  Then explain why you 
think the Court should waive the parental notice requirement. 

3.  If there is something else you want to ask the judicial  officer to order, check the box in #3 on 

the petition, and fill  in what you are asking for. 

4.  You do not have to fill in anything in #4. 

Signature Block 

Sign and date the Petition for Guardianship of At-Risk Juvenile, and print your contact information in 
the blanks under the signature line.  You will  also need to fill in the county and state you are in when 
you sign the form.   

When you sign petition, you are signing under penalty of perjury.  This means you are saying that 
everything in the form is true and correct; if you know something in the form is not true when you 
sign it, you could be found guilty of the crime of perjury (see Minn. Stat. § 609.48, 
revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.48).

Step 2 
Make Copies of the Completed Petition for Guardianship of At-Risk Juvenile 

You need to make a copy of your petition for each of the following people: 

•  The Proposed Guardian; 
•  The Current Guardian (if any); 
•  Parent 1; and 
•  Parent 2. 

It is also a good idea to make a copy for yourself. 

Step 3 
Serve the Petition for Guardianship of At-Risk Juvenile on the Proposed Guardian 
(and Current Guardian, if there is one) 

You must have the Proposed Guardian (and the Current Guardian, if there is one) served with a copy 
of the Petition for Guardianship of At-Risk Juvenile.  This is called “service of process.”  There are 3 
ways the Proposed Guardian can be served: 

•  Waiver of Service;  
•  Personal service; or 
•  Service by mail. 

Waiver of Service 

Each type of service is explained below.  For more general information about service of process, go 
to the “Service of Process” Help Topic (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Service-of-Process.aspx). 

If the Proposed Guardian is willing  to sign a form called  a Waiver of Service (GAC904), you can give 
the copy of the Petition for Guardianship of At-Risk Juvenile to the Proposed Guardian directly.   

Personal Service or Service by Mail 

With personal service, someone who is over the age of 18  (not the Petitioner) hand-delivers a copy 
of the Petition for Guardianship of At-Risk Juvenile to the Proposed Guardian.     

With service by mail, someone who is over the age of 18 mails a copy of the Petition for 
Guardianship of At-Risk Juvenile to the Proposed Guardian by regular U.S. mail. 

Papers cannot be served on a legal holiday as defined in Minn. Stat. § 645.44,  subd. 5 
(revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44).

Step 4 
Proof that the Proposed Guardian Was Served: 
Waiver of Service (GAC904), OR 
Affidavit of Service to Proposed Guardian (GAC905) 

Waiver of Service 

If the Proposed Guardian was willing  to accept the Petition for Guardianship of At-Risk Juvenile 
directly from you, the Proposed Guardian can sign the Waiver of Service form (GAC904). 

 

 

The Proposed Guardian will fill  in their name, and then sign and date the form, include their 
personal contact information, and fill  in the county and state they were in when they signed the 
form. 

You will  need to get the Waiver of Service back from the Proposed Guardian so you can file it with 
Court Administration  (See Step # below). 

Personal Service or Service by Mail 

If someone else served the Petition for Guardianship of At-Risk Juvenile on the Proposed Guardian 
(and Current Guardian, if there is one), then that person has to fill out the Affidavit of Service to 
Proposed Guardian (Petition for Guardianship of At-Risk Juvenile) (GAC905). 

You can fill  in the caption at the top of the form like you did for the petition. 

To fill out the rest of the form, the person who served the papers (the “server”) fills in their full 
name. 

Next, they fill  in the name of the Proposed Guardian and the address where they served the 
Proposed Guardian.  They list the date they served the papers, and they check the box stating how 
they served (by mail  or by personal service). 

If there is a Current Guardian in the case, they will  fill out the same information for the Current 
Guardian.

8/22-D               www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 6 of 8 

Finally, the server will  sign and date the form, include their personal contact information, and fill in 
the county and state they were in when they signed the form. 

You will  need to get the Affidavit of Service to Proposed Guardian or the Waiver of Service form back 
from the server so you can file it with Court Administration  (see Step 6 below). 

Step 5 
Notice to Parents 
and Affidavit of Service to Parents (GAC906) 

Notice to Parents 

You must provide a copy of the petition to your parents “in any manner and format reasonably 
calculated  to give the parent adequate notice at least 14 days before the hearing.” 

Examples of ways you can give your parents a copy of the petition include: 

•  Mail; 
•  Fax; 
•  Hand-delivery; and 
•  Email. 

There could be other ways, too.   

Affidavit of Service to Parents 

After you have given a copy of your Petition to your parents, fill out the Affidavit of Service to 
Parents form (GAC906).  Fill  in Parent 1 and Parent 2’s name and address.  Then explain when and 
how you provided a copy of your Petition to each parent. 

IMPORTANT! 

• 

If you asked the Court in the Petition to waive the parental notice requirement, then 
you do not have to give a copy to that parent at this time.   

•  The Court will  let you know whether you have to give your parents any kind of notice. 

•  Check the box on the Affidavit of Service to Parents form that says you asked the 

Court to waive the parental notice requirement.  Then explain why you asked for that 
waiver.

Step 6 
File Forms with Court Administration 

You will  need to file the following forms with Court Administration: 
•  Petition for Guardianship of At-Risk Juvenile (GAC902);  
•  Waiver of Service (GAC904) signed by the Proposed Guardian (or Affidavit of Service to 

Proposed Guardian, GAC905); 

•  Affidavit of Service to Parents (GAC906). 

There will be a filing  fee (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Court-Fees/District-Court-Fees.aspx) due when 
you file your forms.   

If you cannot afford the filing fee, you can ask the court to waive the fee.  The forms and 
instructions for asking for a fee waiver are available on the Minnesota Judicial  Branch website at 
https://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=19&p=69.
