General Information  

he information contained in this  document is not intended  as legal advice but as  a general guide  to 
explain the legal process.  If you do not understand these procedures, talk to an attorney.  Court staff 
cannot give legal advice. 

 generic responsive motion is a way to respond to the other party’s motion filed in a family case that is 
already open.  In very simple terms, the responsive motion is where you state what you want the court to 
order.  Along with every motion, you must file an affidavit.  The affidavit is where you state why the court 
should give you what you have asked for in your responsive motion.  

ou may be able to use this packet IF: 

•  A family case has already started; 
•  The other party has served you with a motion; 
•  You want to ask the court to deny the other party’s motion, and/or do something within the 

case; and 

•  The court does not publish a specific form for the request you want to make.   

MPORTANT: It is strongly recommended that you get legal advice if you do not know what you should write 
in your responsive motion or you want the responsive motion reviewed by an attorney.  

Fill Out Responsive Notice of Motion and Motion (FAM702) 

Step 1

1.  Write your full name. 
2. 

In the Affidavit in Support of Responsive Motion, you are supposed to write down facts that 
support the requests you made in your responsive motion.  This is where you explain why you 
are asking the court to do the things you asked for in the Responsive Notice of Motion and 
Motion.  

rite down the information you want the court to know.  This section is your “statement of 
facts.”  If you run out of room, add more paper.  Do not write on the back of the page or in the 
margins. 

f you want to include an attachment that supports a statement you make, it is good practice to 
label your attachment something like “Attachment A.” or “Attachment 1.”  Then, next to the 
statement in your Affidavit that talks about the attachment, you can write something like “See 
Attachment A” or “See Attachment 1.”  For example: “I pay $600 per month in child care costs.”  
See Attachment 1.”  And Attachment 1 would be the child care bill.  If you have many 
attachments, you may want to include the form called List of Supporting Documents (FAM903) 
(https://www.mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=18&p=127).

f you add attachments to support a statement you make, be sure to add page numbers to the 
attachments so that they are easy to refer to. 
 

NOTE! Most documents filed with the court are considered public documents and are available to the 
public.  Certain information that is filed with the court may be considered confidential based on court 
rule and not available to the public.  To keep this information confidential and not available to the 
public, you must take certain steps that are described below. 

The steps listed below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  Filers who are using eFS to submit 
their court documents must identify and designate their filings as required in Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 11.02 
and 14.06.

All social security numbers, employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers (also called 
“restricted identifiers”) must not be listed on papers you file with the court. This is to protect your 
privacy, the other parties and your children.   Only provide social security numbers, employer 
identification numbers, and financial account numbers when the court requires this information to be 
provided to the court.  For example, if you must provide the court with bank account numbers, or 
medical account numbers, do not include any account number in your document (your motion, 
supporting affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you must use Form 11.1 to list these confidential numbers.  

If account numbers are not required to be provided to the court, and the numbers appear on 
documents that are considered available to the public, (such as medical invoices or credit account 
numbers on statements) you must remove the number on the document before filing the document 
with the court. 

Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-public 
documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the time you file the 
documents with the court.  You must complete and file the “Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 
11.2 (also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public documents.  The most common non-
public documents are called “financial source documents.”  Examples of financial source documents 
include: 

•  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and business expenses 
•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers   

You may also need to submit other documents that court rules identify as non-public documents, such 
as a medical record.  For example, a report from a doctor that provides a medical diagnosis or treatment 
plan for you or your child would qualify as a medical record.   

You must use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing other non-public documents, such as medical 
records, with the court.  One Form 11.2 cover sheet can be used for submitting all non-public 
documents.   

The failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being rejected by court 
administration, being available to the public, stricken from the court record, and sanctions 
from the court. 

See Rule 11 of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice for more information about how to file documents 
containing social security numbers, financial account numbers, “financial source documents” and other 
non-public documents.   

Form 11.1 and Form 11.2 can be found at www.mncourts.gov/forms under the court forms category of 
“Confidential Information” and is court form number CON111 and CON112.

3.  When you sign your Affidavit in Support of Responsive Motion, you are signing under penalty of 
perjury.  Perjury is the crime of intentionally lying or misrepresenting the truth.  By signing

of your knowledge.   

4.  Date and sign the Affidavit.  Write the the county and state you are in when you signed it, and

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
