Read These Important Notices 

  Can I handle my divorce myself?       
      The court does not require you to have a lawyer.  You may represent yourself, and you will 
be  referred  to  as  a  “self-represented  litigant.”    Court  forms  are  available  from  the  court  but 
court personnel cannot assist you in filling out the forms. The Court expects every person who 
appears  in  court  without  an  attorney  to  know  and  to  follow  the  law.    If  you  act  as  your  own 
attorney, you must do what an attorney would do. 

     The danger in representing yourself is that you will not recognize legal issues or problems 
in your case, or you may delay your divorce by failing to follow required procedures.  You may 
get a divorce and learn later that you made serious mistakes that cost you money or create other 
problems. Changing a divorce order is difficult, and for some issues, like division of property, 
it is nearly impossible to change a divorce order.  

  You may wish to consider talking to a lawyer even if you plan to represent yourself.  A 
lawyer  can  help  you  with  all  or  just  part  of  the  process.    For  example,  you  may  decide  to       
ask  a  lawyer  to  help  you  decide  if  you  should  ask  for  spousal  maintenance,  or  to  help  with       
understanding and calculating child support. 

Here are some areas where people run into problems and need legal advice. If you answer 
 
YES to any of the questions below, you are strongly advised to talk to an attorney before signing 
any divorce forms. 

.  Does your spouse have an attorney? 
2.  Are you unsure of your spouse's income, or do you think your spouse is working less than 

he/she could be? 

3.  Do you or your spouse have pension, retirement or profit sharing plans? 
4.  Do you or your spouse own a home or other real estate together or separately? 
5.  Do you or your spouse own a business? 
6.  Do you or your spouse have a large amount of assets (money, property) or is your spouse 

hiding assets? 

husband? 

7.  Did you sign an antenuptual contract? 
8.  Do you and your spouse have children together or is a spouse pregnant? 
9.  Since your marriage, has a spouse given birth to a child fathered by someone other than the 

10. Have you or your spouse filed for bankruptcy or plan to in the near future? 
11. Are you or your spouse involved in a personal injury lawsuit? 
12. Are you worried about paying debts? 
13. Are you claiming you have non-marital property? 
14. Do you want spousal maintenance (formerly called “alimony”) or is your spouse asking for 

spousal maintenance? 

15. Do you have questions about how to continue medical insurance? 
16. Are you or your spouse a member of the armed services?

Can I file for divorce in Minnesota?  

1.    The law states that before you can begin a divorce in Minnesota, you or your spouse must 
have lived in Minnesota for the last six months, OR you or your spouse must be a member 
of the armed forces stationed in Minnesota for the last six months.  If neither you nor your 
spouse have lived in Minnesota for the last six months, STOP – you cannot get a divorce 
in Minnesota yet.  You must wait until one of you has lived in Minnesota for at least six 
months.  File in the county where either you or your spouse live now. 

2.  If you and your spouse are a same sex couple who were civilly married in Minnesota, but 
no longer live in Minnesota, based on a new law effective August 1, 2013, you and your 
spouse may file an action for dissolution in Minnesota if there is no other state that will 
allow an action for dissolution because of the sex or sexual orientation of you and your 
spouse. 

If you or your spouse has already started a divorce, legal separation or annulment action in 
3. 
        Minnesota or in any other state, you cannot start this divorce.  You may either complete 
the other action,  or you  may  have the other action dismissed and then start this divorce 
action. 

 

 

What Forms Do I Need?  
             You  should  use  the  forms  located  under  the  category  of  Petition  for  Divorce  with 
Children if you and the other party have at least one child together, if a spouse is pregnant, and 
if a spouse has a child who was born during the marriage and husband or wife is claiming that 
husband is not the father of that child.  A “child” means someone 17 years old or younger.   For 
purposes of child support, “child” also means someone 18 or 19 years old, if the child is still in 
high school.  If no children were born of, or adopted into this marriage, or if your children are 
now adults you should use the forms under the category of Petition for Dissolution of Marriage 
without Children. 

Do You Need a Temporary Order? 
  IMPORTANT:    Your  divorce  will  not  be  final  for  several  weeks  or months.   Between 
 
now and when your divorce is final, you may need to ask the court to order your spouse to pay you 
child support or spousal maintenance, or you may need an order regarding custody, parenting time, 
possession of the homestead, or other matters.  If you need help from the court at any time before 
the divorce is final, you must file a Motion for Temporary Relief.  Ask Court Administration for the 
Temporary  Relief  Pending  Final  Hearing  With  Children  forms  or  download  the  forms  at 
http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=15&p=57.  

o the Forms Have to be Typewritten? 

             Typewritten  forms  are  preferred  because  they  are  easier  to  read.  You  may  print  your 
answers if your writing is clear and neat. Use dark ink. If you need more space to answer a question, 
write “See Exhibit A” and attach an additional full sheet of paper labeled “Exhibit A.”  If a second 
attachment is needed, label it “Exhibit B”.

the court may give you everything you ask for in your lawsuit.

On the line marked “Name of Petitioner", write your full name.  From now on you will be

Check  the  appropriate  box  “without  real  estate”  or  “with  real  estate”  at  the  top  right 
section  of  the  Summons.    Check  “with  real  estate”  if  you  or  your  spouse  together  or 
separately own real estate, land or buildings in Minnesota or elsewhere. 

Check  the  appropriate  box  at  question  #3.  If  there  is  no  real  estate,  check  the  box  that

real  estate  select  the  first  box  and  fill  in  the  street  address,  county,  and  state of  all real 
property (such as a house or cabin) owned either by you or your spouse. You must also

“See attached Exhibit A” following the legal description for the first parcel of land.  On a 
separate full sheet of paper, write the information for the other parcels of land.  Label the 
separate sheet of paper “Exhibit A” and file it with the completed Summons. 

Fill in your address and phone number at the bottom of the Summons.   

aution: Make sure you list all real estate. To avoid title problems in the future, list all real 
estate owned by the parties together or separately in the Summons and Petition and the divorce 
Decree. You and your spouse both have an interest in all real estate owned by either you or your 
spouse until the divorce is finalized and the Decree awards the property to just one party. For

Legal Custody identifies which parent(s) has / have the right to make decisions regarding 
the  upbringing  of  the  children,  including  education,  health  care,  and  religious  training. 
Legal Custody can either be sole or joint. Sole Legal Custody means that only one parent 
has a right to make major decisions regarding the upbringing of the children.  Joint Legal 
Custody means both parents share in the decision-making.  

hysical Custody identifies which parent will handle the routine daily care and control of 
the  children.  Generally,  the  child  lives  with  the  parent  who  has  physical  custody.  
Physical  custody  can  either  be  sole  or  joint.  If  Sole  Physical  Custody  is  awarded,  the 
parent  with  whom  the  child  does  not  live  with  will  have  scheduled  parenting  time 
(visitation)  rights  unless  the  court  "reserves"  parenting  time.  If  parenting  time  is 
"reserved"  there  is  no  order  made  for  parenting time.   You must give  the court reasons 
why parenting time should be reserved.  Joint Physical Custody means that the children 
lives with both parents based  upon a schedule that best meets the needs of the children 
and parents, and that the parents have joint responsibility and control in the daily care of 
the children. If you request joint physical custody, you must be able to show that you and 
the other parent can cooperate and work together to resolve problems that arise in raising 
your  children.    The  court may require you  and the  other  parent  to agree to mediate any 
disputes regarding joint physical custody before bringing a custody dispute back to court. 
 
Parenting Time is the time a parent spends with a joint child, regardless who has custody 
of the child. You must say if you want parenting time to be unsupervised, supervised or 
reserved.  If you think  your  children would not be safe  alone with your spouse,  you can 
ask  the  Court  to  make  parenting  time  “supervised.”    You  must  explain  at  16  a)  and  b) 
why supervision is needed, and who will do the supervising and pay any costs.  The court 
may  order  parenting  time  to  take  place  at  a  visitation  center,  or  the  court  may  order  a

family  member  or  someone  from  social  services  to supervise the parenting  time.  If you 
check “unsupervised” the parent can visit the children without anyone else watching.  If 
you check “reserved”, you are asking that the court give that parent NO parenting time. If 
you check "reserved" answer part (c) describing why "reserved" parenting time is best for 
the children. If parenting time is "reserved" either parent can ask the court to make a new 
order about parenting time in the future, by filing a motion with the court.    

This  question  asks  about  “public  assistance”  paid  by  the  State  of  Minnesota.  Public 
Assistance  means  MFIP,  Tribal  TANF,  General  Assistance,  MinnesotaCare,  Medical 
Assistance, or Child Care Assistance.  Check YES or NO.  If YES, write in the name of 
the county paying the assistance.  Minnesota law requires you, as the petitioner, to notify 
the  public  authority  that  you  are  filing  a  divorce  action  when  the  public  authority  is 
paying  assistance  or  is  processing  your  application  for  assistance.    Use  the  form  called 
Notice  to  Public  Authority  (court  form  DIV813)  to  notify  the  county  of  your  divorce 
action.  

Answer  whether you,  your spouse,  or your joint children receive Supplemental Security 
Income (SSI) from the federal government. This is an income supplement program based 
on  need.  To  get  it,  you  must  be  low  income  and  over  65,  blind  or  disabled.    SSI  is 
different  from  Social  Security  retirement  or  other  benefits  based  on  qualifying  years  of 
work.

“School” includes high school, college, vo-tech, and night classes.  Check YES or NO.  If 
YES, write in the name of the school. 

1.     This question is about your employment status.  Provide the requested information about 
your  employer.    If  you  are  self-employed,  list  the  business  name  and  address.    For 
purposes of setting child support, there is a presumption that both parents can work full-
time. If you are unemployed or work less than 40 hours/week, answer subparagraphs b)i. 
and  ii.  to  explain  why  you  are  not  employed  full-time  and  describe  your  past  work 
experience. 

2.       This  question asks  for your  monthly income. Minnesota law defines "income" a certain 

way for purposes of setting child support.  
•  When you enter your income amounts, enter the "gross" amount, not the "net". Gross 
income is the amount you receive before taxes or other deductions are taken out.  
If you have a job, the most accurate way to calculate your gross monthly income is to 
multiply your hourly wage by the number of hours you work per week by 4.33. 4.33 is 
the average number of weeks in a month. 

• 

•  Overtime pay is generally excluded from income, but may be included depending on 
the  circumstances.  Look  at  the  Minnesota  laws  or  consult  a  lawyer  if  you  have 
questions about overtime pay or other categories of income. 

•  Public  assistance  benefits  available  to  low-income  people  are  not  included  in 
"income". Do not include MFIP, General Assistance, SSI or other public benefits as 
income.

•  Look at each category of income and enter the amount you receive per month (before 

taxes or deductions). Enter "zero" if you do not have income of that type. 
If you have a type of income not listed at #21, enter that income under "Other".  When 
you have entered all your monthly income amounts, total the numbers and enter that 
on the line "Total monthly income".  

he three final questions at #22 are important for calculating child support.  

1.  "Enter  the  amount  of  child  support  you  are  court-ordered  to  pay  for  a  nonjoint 
children."    Do  you  pay  child  support  for  a  child  that  is  your  legal  child,  but  not  your 
spouse's  legal  child?  If  you  do,  write  in  the  amount  your  court  order  says  you  are 
supposed to pay each month. 

. "Enter the amount of spousal maintenance you are court-ordered to pay to your current 
or former spouse."  If a court order requires you to pay spousal maintenance (alimony) to 
a former spouse or to your current spouse, enter the amount you are ordered to pay each 
month. 

.  "Enter  the  amount  of  Social  Security  of  Veteran's  Benefits  provided  to  a  joint  child 
because of your retirement, disability, or other eligibility."  If a joint child of you and your 
spouse receive SS or VA benefits due to YOUR eligibility, enter the monthly amount of 
the child's benefit here.   Which parent receives the check on the child's behalf? Check the 
box for Petitioner if you receive the check, and check the box for Respondent if the check 
goes to your spouse on your child's behalf.

extraordinary  medical  expenses.    If  YES,  provide  the  name  of  the  child,  describe  the 
needs, and answer (b) and (c).  

This  question  is  about  your  spouse’s  employment  status.    Provide  the  requested 
information about your spouse’s employer and jobs. If your spouse works less than full-
time,  explain  why  your  spouse  is  not  working  full-time  and  what  his/her  past  work 
experience is at paragraph c) i. and ii.  If you do not know the answer to questions about 
your spouse's jobs, check the "unknown" box.  

This  question  asks  about  your  spouse’s  monthly  income.    Check  “Petitioner  has  no 
information  about  Respondent’s  income”  if  you  do  not  know  how  much  money  your 
spouse makes and you are not able to get that information  If you have some or detailed 
information about your spouse’s income, complete the questions.

28.   Complete  the  questions  about  medical  and  dental  insurance.  The  court  needs  to  know 
what coverage you, your spouse and your joint children have now and what it costs. If the 
children do not have health coverage, the court needs to know if you or your spouse could 
purchase health coverage through your work (question 28f.) 

OTE:  If you, your spouse, or your children are covered by medical or dental insurance 
through  your  job  or  your  spouse’s  job,  that  coverage  can  be  continued  even  after  the 
divorce.  If  you  want  the  insurance  coverage  to  continue  after  the  divorce,  call  the 
Employment  Benefits  Office  of  you  or  your  spouse’s  employer  and  ask  for  “COBRA” 
coverage. 

This question is about spousal maintenance.  Spousal maintenance is money paid by one 
spouse to help support the other spouse (formerly called alimony).  If you check YES for 
either (a) or (b), you need to provide details about the length of marriage, education of the 
spouse  who  would  receive  maintenance,  gross  monthly  income,  and  reasons  why  the 
spouse  would  not  be  able  to  maintain  the  standard  of  living  established  during  the 
marriage.

List all the vehicles owned by Petitioner and Respondent together or separately. 

ARNING:    Questions  31-32  ask  about  marital  and  non-marital  property.  Dividing 
marital  property  and  non-marital  property  can  be  complicated.  You  should  talk  to  an 
attorney. For example, a house purchased by one spouse before the marriage, then lived in 
by both spouses will generally be part marital and part non-marital property. An attorney 
can advise you on the law and how to divide the value of the house between you. 

Marital Property means almost  anything that you  or  your spouse  own  that you or 
your spouse received during the marriage, even during the times that you and your 
spouse  were  separated.  This  includes  real  estate,  boats,  cabins,  household  goods, 
furniture, jewelry, and other things. 

Non-marital Property means: (1) anything that you or your spouse owned before the 
marriage; (2) anything that you or your spouse received as a gift, bequest, devise, or 
inheritance;  (3)  anything  that  you  or  your  spouse  got  in  trade  or  in  exchange  for 
your  non-marital  property;  (4)  anything  that  is  an  increase  in  the  value  of  non-
marital property; (5) anything you or your spouse received after the valuation date 
set by the Court; or (6) anything included by a valid antenuptial contract (STOP: If 
you have an antenuptial contract, you should stop here and talk to an attorney.)  

1.   Check  YES or NO whether you and your spouse have divided the marital property to 
your  mutual  satisfaction,  including  household  goods,  furniture,  furnishings,  and  other 
belongings. If you have NOT divided the marital property, list the items that you want.

(a) Check YES or NO whether you claim non-marital property.  Non-marital property is 
property  you  owned  before  you  got  married  or  acquired  during  the  marriage  by 
inheritance or gift.  List all non-marital property you own.  

(b) Check YES or NO whether your spouse claims non-marital property.  Non-marital 
property is property you owned before you got married or acquired during the marriage by 
inheritance or gift.  List all non-marital property your spouse owns.  
 

33.   Check  YES  or  NO  whether  you  or  your  spouse  has  money  in  banks,  savings,  cash  or 
investments.  If YES, fill in all columns in the box.  Use Confidential Information Form 
11.1 (CON111) to list the name of the financial institution, account holder name(s) and 
account  numbers.    Using  Form  11.1  keeps  your  account  numbers  confidential  from  the 
public.  Do not list account numbers on the Petition. 

4.   Check YES or NO whether you and/or your spouse own part or all of a business.  If YES, 

fill in the name, address and value of the business. 

5.   Check YES or NO if either you or the Respondent own a manufactured (mobile) home.  

If YES, complete the detail questions. 

ARNING: Question 36 asks you to list all real property. Real property is land and the 
buildings on the land. You must list all real property owned by you and your spouse together, 
separately, or with others. Failure to list all property will create serious problems and expense in 
the future. Dividing real property is complicated. You should talk to an attorney if you 
and/or your spouse own any real property. You and your spouse both have an interest in all 
real estate owned by either you or your spouse until the divorce is finalized and the Decree 
awards the property to just one party.  For example, a deed given by one spouse to the other 
spouse before the divorce is finalized does not transfer all interest to the grantee spouse.

(c)  Check YES or NO if Respondent owns real property solely in his/her name or with 
someone other than you. 
(d)  Answer how many properties are owned by you and your spouse in total. 
If YES to (a), (b) or (c), complete the Real Property Information questions for each piece 
of  property.    (1)  List  the  full  names  of  all  owners  of  the  property.    (2)  Fill  in  the  legal 
description  of  the  property  (the  legal  description  is  not  the  same  as  the  street  address). 
Example  of  Legal  Description:  Lot  1,  Block  4,  Hamden  Edition,  Hennepin  County, 
Minnesota.  You  can  get  a  copy  of  the  legal  description  from  the  Deed  or  Contract  for 
Deed at the office of the County Recorder or Registrar of Titles in the County where the 
real property is located. WARNING: Be sure to copy the legal description exactly as is

current market value of the property and describe how you came up with that value.  (7) 
Check YES if this property is the homestead.   

ARNING:  Question  37  asks  about  pension,  profit  sharing,  and  retirement  plans. 
Dividing pension, profit sharing, and retirement plans is complicated. You or your spouse 
could face large losses if the divorce decree does not divide the pension or retirement plan 
according to the laws that apply. You should talk to an attorney if you or your spouse have 
any of these types of plan. 

(a)  Check  YES  or  NO  if  you  have  an  IRA,  401(k),  403(b)  or  other  retirement  plan.  If 
YES,  list  the  current  account  balance.    Use  Confidential  Information  Form  11.1 
(CON111)  to  list  the  name  of  the  financial  institution,  account  holder  name(s)  and 
account numbers. 
(b) Check  YES  or  NO  if  your  past  or  present  employer,  union,  or  other  group,  paid 
money  into  a  pension,  profit-sharing,  or  other  retirement  plan  for  you.    If  YES,  list  the 
name of the plan, the name of the group employer, union, or group providing the plan, the 
date  you  began  working  at  the  job  or  joined  the  plan,  the  type  of  plan,  and  the  present 
value of the plan.  
(c)  Check YES or NO if your spouse has an IRA, 401(k), 403(b) or other retirement plan. 
If YES, list the list the current account balance.  Use Confidential Information Form 11.1 
(CON111)  to  list  the  name  of  the  financial  institution,  account  holder  name(s)  and 
account numbers. 
(d) Check YES or NO if your spouse’s past or present employer, union, or other group, 
paid money into a pension, profit-sharing, or other retirement plan.  If YES, list the name 
of the plan, the name of the group employer, union, or group providing the plan, the date 
your spouse began working at the job or joined the plan, the type of plan, and the present 
value of the plan.  
 

38.   Check YES or NO if you and/or your spouse have outstanding debts (owe money) either 
together or separately. If YES, list all of the debts you and your spouse now have, even if 
 
only one of you created the debt and even if only one of your names is on the credit card, 
 
loan  or  note.  List  all  debts  still  owed  from  before  you  were  married,  from  during  the 
 
marriage but before separation, and after separation.  The Judgment and Decree (divorce 
 
decree) will state who is  responsible for  paying each  debt. Include credit card bills, gas 
 
bills, water bills, telephone bills, school loans, car loans, home loans and mortgages, and 
 
other bills and loans. List to whom the debt is owed (such as Sears); how the money was 
 
used (such  as “clothing for the children”); whose name is on the account and when the 
 
debt was created (if you cannot get the exact date the debt was created, at least state if the 
 
debt  is  from  before  the  marriage,  or  during  the  marriage  and before  separation, or after 
 
separation);  the  current  balance  due;  and  the  monthly  payment.  Attach  another  sheet  of 
 
paper if you need more space. You must disclose all debts.  
 

9.   You may change your name as part of the divorce, but you do not have to do so. You can 
change your name to a maiden name, or some other name.  You cannot make your spouse 
change  his  or  her  name,  and  your  spouse  cannot  make  you  change  your  name.    If  you

your name, check NO.   
(a) Print the new name you want (first, middle, and last).  Do not use initials unless you 
want only an initial instead of a full name 
(b) You cannot change your name if your reason for changing your name is to defraud or 
mislead anyone.  Mark True or False to the statement “Petitioner has no intent to defraud 
or mislead anyone by changing his/her name”. 
(c) If you have a felony conviction, you cannot change your name unless you notify the 
prosecuting authority that you intend to change your name.  The prosecuting authority has 
30  days  after  being  served  with  your  notice  to  object  to  the  name  change.    If  you  have 
been  convicted  of  a  felony  anywhere in the United  States,  answer (c) YES.   Ask Court 
Administration to give you the Felon Name Change Instructions.

change and you use your new name, you may be guilty of a gross misdemeanor.

schedule which parent is taking care of each child at all times (24 hours a day/7 days a 
week).  Include the time of day that the child will be exchanged. For example, a weekday 
schedule  might  be  "the  children  are  with  Mother  every  Monday  through  Friday,  except 
that  Father  has  parenting  time  every  Wednesday  from  4pm  to  8am  Thursday."  What  is 
appropriate for parenting time can depend on the age of the child.

After  you  have  set  out  the  weekday  and  weekend  schedule,  you  can  request  a  different 
schedule for summer, holidays, birthdays, or school release days.   Holidays may include, 
but  are  not  limited  to,  the  following:  New  Years  Day,  Easter,  Memorial  Day  weekend, 
Fourth  of  July,  Labor  Day  weekend,  Thanksgiving  Day,  and  Christmas.  Some  parents 
alternate  holidays  each  year  so  that,  for  example,  on  Memorial  Day  weekend  the 
children  would  be  with  the  mother  in  odd-numbered  years  and  with  the  father  in  even-
numbered  years.  The  next  holiday  would  be  Fourth  of  July  and  the  children  would  be 
with  the  father  in  odd-numbered  years  and  with  the  mother  in  even-numbered  years. 
Other parents keep the same holidays each year so that, for example, the children spends 
every  Christmas  Eve  with  the  mother  and  every  Christmas  Day  with  the  father.  Under 
“Other” you may want to include how you would like to handle Mother’s Day, Father’s 
Day, and any days or events that are special to you.   
 
Some parents include transportation details in the parenting time schedule. If you want to 
say  who  is  responsible  for  transporting  the  child  for  parenting  time,  enter  that  under 
"Other." Some parents make very detailed parenting plans that address many more issues 
that come up in raising the children. If you would like a more detailed parenting plan, you 
can create one and attach it to your Petition. The court does not have a form for a more 
detailed plan. It is also possible to request "reasonable parenting time." With reasonable 
parenting  time,  there  is  no  schedule  in  the  divorce  order.  Instead,  the  parents  work  out 
parenting time themselves, on an on-going basis. If you want "reasonable parenting time," 
write that phrase under "Other" and leave the rest of the schedule blank.  

Section (d) asks for the annual (yearly) number of overnights each parent has with the 
children (based on a two-year average) because parenting time is based on the number of 
overnights that each parent has with the children. It is important for each parent to know 
how many overnights each parent has in a court order (by using a Summons and Petition 
for Dissolution of Marriage, you are asking for a court order). If a parent has significant 
time with a child that isn’t overnight, the court may count that time as an “overnight 
equivalent,” but it must be called that to count as equal to an overnight.  

f the parenting time is equal, then each parent will have 182.5 overnights. 

f parenting  time is not equal, then you will need to figure out each parent’s number of 
overnights (and, if applicable, number of “overnight equivalents”). One way to do this is 
to follow these steps: 

•  Print 24 months of calendar pages.  
•  Based  on  the  schedule  you  are  asking  for,  mark  on  the  calendar  each  parent’s 

overnight for two full years. 

•  Count Petitioner’s number of overnights for the two-year period, then divide by 
2.    That  will  give  you  the  number  of  Petitioner’s  annual  overnights  with  the 
children. 

•  Count Respondent’s number of overnights for the two-year period, then divide by 
2.    That  will  give  you  the  number  of  Respondent’s  annual  overnights  with  the 
children.

You  need  income  information  for  yourself  and  your  spouse,  and  the  number  of  annual 
overnights  each  parent  has  with  the  children,  to  use  the  calculator.  This  calculator  is 
intended for use by the public, and after you enter the required information, the calculator 
produces  dollar  amounts  for  support  based  on  Minnesota  law.  If  you  think  that  support 
should  be  higher  or  lower  in  your  case,  you  need  to  add  a  statement  to  your  Petition, 
requesting a "deviation" in child support and stating facts that support your request. You 
should research the law or get help from an attorney if you wish to request a deviation.

Minnesota  Care,  check  box  (b)  instead.    If  you  think  the  judge  should  make  no  orders 
about health coverage for the children at this time, check box (c) to "reserve" the issue. 
Reserving the issue means that in the future either parent can file a motion in court asking 
for an order deciding who must provide health coverage for the joint children.  

5.      The court will make an order regarding child support. Child support includes costs for the 
children for basic support for daily living expenses, health care coverage, uninsured and 
unreimbursed health care expenses, and child care expenses if child care is needed so the 
parent can work or attend school.  You do not need to fill in anything at #5.  However, at 
some  point  in  the  proceedings,  you  will  need  to  be  specific  about  the  amount  of  child 
support  that  is  needed.    The  Minnesota  Department  of  Human  Services  has  created  an 
online calculator for child support at: 

.      Usually medical and dental insurance does not pay every bill. For example, co-payments 
and medicine might not be covered. These costs are called unreimbursed costs. Uninsured 
costs are expenses for treatment not covered by the health plan.   These costs are part of 
the child support obligation. The child support calculator provides a percentage allocation 
of  these  costs,  based  on  the  relative  incomes  of  the  parents.  Check  box  (a)  to  ask  that 
these expenses be shared. Or check box (b) if you want the court to reserve this issue and 
not make an order about these expenses at this time. 

.       This paragraph states how you want to handle the health insurance coverage costs for you 
and your spouse (not your children.) Check box (a) if you want you and your spouse to be 
responsible for  your own  insurance  after  the divorce. Check box (b) if you want one of 
you  to  pay  the  insurance  costs  for  the  other  after  the  divorce.    Box  (c)  is  for  COBRA 
coverage.  COBRA coverage exists under federal law and it allows a spouse to continue

to be  covered under the  other spouse's  work insurance even after the divorce. For more 
information on costs, whether this coverage is available, and how to get it, check with the 
employer of  the person  who has health coverage.  If you have other questions, or if the 
boxes provided do not explain what you want the court to order, ask an attorney for help. 

.    Minnesota  law  requires  the  parents  to  share  work-related  and  school-related  childcare 
costs.  This  is  part  of  the  child  support  obligation.    You  can  check  the  box  to  have  the 
judge determine the share of monthly child care expenses according to Minnesota law or 
you can check the box to reserve the issue. The child support calculator will calculate the 
share each parent should pay, based on their relative incomes. 

Spousal maintenance is money paid by one spouse to the other to help with the spouse's 
necessary  monthly  living  expenses.  This  is  separate  from  child  support.  If  you  want 
spousal  maintenance  to  be  denied,  check  box  10(a).    If  spousal  maintenance  is  denied, 
you and your spouse can not ask for it to be ordered later (after the divorce) even if your 
circumstances  change.  If  you  want  to  retain  the  ability  to  ask  for  spousal  maintenance 
after the divorce is final, check "reserved." If you check reserved and the court agrees to 
reserve maintenance, your spouse can also request maintenance from you at a later date. If 
you  want  an  order  for  spousal  maintenance  now,  check  box  10(c)  and  indicate  who 
should pay.      

 

In question 30 above you listed all of the vehicles owned by you and your spouse.  Write 
down which vehicles you want the Court to give to you and which vehicles you want your 
spouse to have.  

ARNING:    Dividing  marital  property  and  non-marital  property  is  complicated.  You

2.   Check  YES  or  NO  whether  you  and  your  spouse  have  already  divided  your  marital 
property to your mutual satisfaction. If NO, list the marital property you want to receive 
and the marital property you want your spouse to receive.  

3.   Check YES or NO whether you and your spouse have already divided your non-marital 
property  to  your  mutual  satisfaction.  If  NO,  list  the  non-marital  property  you  want  to 
receive and the non-marital property you want your spouse to receive.

If  you  and/or  your  spouse  own  a  business,  state  how  you  want  the  court  to  divide  the 
business.  Be very specific. 

If  you  and/or  your  spouse  own  a  manufactured  home,  provide  the  address  of  the 
manufactured home and check off who should get it.

If  you  or  your  spouse  own  other  real  property  either  separately  or  together,  check  off 
whether  you  (Petitioner)  or  your  spouse  (Respondent)  should  be  awarded  that  real 
property,  and  then  list  the  street  address,  city,  county  and  state  where  the  homestead  is 
located,  and  then  write  the  exact  legal  description.  You  can  get  a  copy  of  the  legal 
description from the Deed or Contract for Deed at the office of the County Recorder or 
Registrar of Titles in the county where the property is located.  Write in the name of the 
mortgage company and the amount of the current mortgage balance. If there is additional 
real property, list it in paragraph 18. 

If there is additional real property, provide the address and legal description and state how 
that property should be awarded. 

9.   Describe  how  your  pension,  profit  sharing,  retirement,  IRA  or  401  plan  should  be 
divided, then do the same with any plan in your spouse’s name. Get competent legal and 
tax advice before making any decisions. 

If you listed any debts at #38 in your Petition, list those debts again here. State who the 
debt is owed to, and then state who should pay this debt - you or your spouse. The court 
can order one of you to pay a debt, but if both your names are on the debt, the creditor can 
still  go  after  either  of  you  for  payment.  Your  divorce  doesn't  eliminate  your  legal 
obligation to pay a debt you promised to pay when the money was borrowed. If you are 
worried about the debt being paid, ask a lawyer for advice about how to handle the debt in 
the divorce.  Whether or not you have debt, you can check box 20 (b) asking that you and 
your spouse both be responsible for non-joint debts you each incurred on your own.   

1.  

If  you  want  to  change  your  name,  print  exactly  how  your  new  name  should  be  listed 
(first, middle, and last). Do not use initials unless you want only an initial instead of a 
full name.

ill out the form called "Financial Affidavit.” This form asks for your income information. Look at 
paragraph 22 on  your  Petition.  The  information you put  on the Financial Affidavit should be the 
same as #22 on the Petition. The Financial Affidavit is required to be served on your spouse and 
filed with the court at the same time you serve and file your Petition and Summons. The Financial 
Affidavit has separate instructions  which you  should read. It is very important to submit with the 
Financial Affidavit any proof you have regarding your income. This proof may include the last 3

Affidavit you provide to your spouse also has copies of your proof of income.  

 

Step 4 
Sign the Summons and Petition and Financial Affidavit  

  Sign  the  Petition  and  Financial Affidavit  under penalty of perjury.  By  signing the Petition 
under penalty of perjury, you are stating that the information in the document is true to the 
best  of  your  knowledge.    Perjury  is  the  crime  of  intentionally  lying  or  misrepresenting  the 
truth, punishable by jail or other sanctions. 

  Sign the Summons.   

ake two copies of the Summons, two copies of the Petition, and two copies of the Financial 
Affidavit and attachments (pay stubs, tax return, etc.) You will arrange to have one set of copies 
served on your spouse (Step 6) and you will keep one set of copies for your records. 
Later, you will file the Summons and Petition and Financial Affidavit with the Court (Step 9.)   

Step 5 
Make Copies of Forms 

Step 6 
Serve the Other Party 

our spouse must receive a copy of your Summons and Petition for Dissolution of Marriage and 
Financial  Affidavit.  Delivering  the  copy  to  your  spouse  is  called  “service  of  process.”  Your 
marriage dissolution action is started the moment your spouse is served with the Summons and 
Petition for Dissolution of Marriage.  

These  instructions  describe  three  ways  to  do  “service  of  process:”      (1)  Personal  Service,  (2) 
Waiver of Service, and (3) Alternate Service. Read about each of the three ways to decide which 
way is appropriate in your case.   

 

Service of Process Method #1: Personal Service 
This  is  the  most  common  method  for  serving  divorce  papers.  With  Personal  Service,  a  third 
person  (the  “server”)  who  is  at  least  18  years  old  hands  a  copy  of  the  Summons  and  Petition 
directly to your spouse.  Papers cannot be served on a legal holiday.  After serving the papers, the 
server  must fill  out  the Affidavit  of  Personal Service, and sign  it under penalty of perjury. The 
Affidavit  of  Service  is  your  proof  that  the papers were delivered, and tells  what date  they were 
delivered. See the following “Instructions on how to fill out the Affidavit of Service”.

mportant Points for Personal Service  

•  A  copy  of  the  Summons  and Petition and  Financial Affidavit  is handed directly to your 

spouse (not mailed, not left with a roommate.) 

•  You cannot hand the papers to your spouse. 
•  Papers can be handed to your spouse at home, at work, or anyplace else. 
•  The server must be at least 18 years old.  
• 

 You can ask the sheriff or a private process server to serve the papers, or ask a friend to 
serve the papers.  Private servers and the sheriff charge a fee to serve papers. If you have 
an  In  Forma  Pauperis  (IFP)  order  that  covers  service  of  process  fees,  the  sheriff  will 
serve the papers within the county at no cost to you.  You must deliver to the sheriff the 
Summons and Petition and Financial Affidavit and the IFP order. No matter who serves 
the  papers,  it  is  your  responsibility  to  get  the  completed  Affidavit  of  Personal  Service 
from the server to file in your court file. If your spouse lives outside of your county, you 
must  contact  the  sheriff  in  that  county  and  ask  if  they  will  honor  the  IFP  order  from 
another county. 

•  Papers cannot be served on a legal holiday.  Papers delivered on a legal holiday have not 

been legally served, and the case will be dismissed. 

•  Personal  Service  in  another  state  or  country.    Your  spouse  can  be  served  by 
Personal  Service  anywhere  in  the  United  States,  as  long  as  the  papers  are  handed 
directly to your spouse.  If your spouse lives in another country, you must consult a 
lawyer about how to properly serve your spouse.  Service in a foreign country must 
be  done  according  to  Minnesota  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  Rule  4.04(c)  and 
Minnesota Statutes.  The rules for serving someone in a foreign country can be very 
complex  and  court  employees cannot  tell  you how to serve your  spouse  in another 
country. 

 

 
  How to Fill out the Affidavit of Personal Service: 

.  Fill out the top part of the form the same way you did on your Summons 

.  On the blank line after “I,” fill in the name of the person who hand-delivered the forms to 

your spouse. 

.  Fill in the date that the documents were hand-delivered to your spouse. 

.  Write  in  the  title  of  each  document  handed  to  your  spouse.  (Summons  and  Petition  for 

Dissolution of Marriage and Financial Affidavit). 

.  Fill in the name of your spouse and the location (address) where your spouse was given 

the Summons and Petition and Financial Affidavit. 

f.  After  it has  been signed, make one copy of the completed Affidavit of Personal Service 

for your records.

Service of Process Method #2:  Waiver of Service 
Rule 4.05 of the Rules of Civil Procedure says that a petitioner may ask that the respondent 
waive service of the Summons and Petition.  Generally, the respondent has a duty to avoid 
causing the petitioner to have to pay unnecessary costs of serving the Summons and Petition 
on the respondent.   

 

To make this request, you will need to send or deliver to the other party the following forms: 

•  Summons; 

•  Petition; 

•  Notice of Lawsuit and Request for Waiver of Service of Summons (CIV022A); 

•  Two copies of Waiver of Service of Summons (CIV022B); and 

•  A prepaid way (like a self-addressed, stamped envelope) for the respondent to return a 

signed copy of the Waiver (CIV022B) to you. 

Warning:  If your spouse does not sign and return the Waiver of Service of Summons 
(CIV022B) to you, the papers are not served, and you must then use Personal Service or 
Alternate Service.   

If your spouse is in the United States, and does not return the Waiver of Service of Summons 
to you within 30 days, then the court will order the respondent to pay the costs of serving the 
divorce  forms;  there  could  be  other  costs  as  well.    For  more  details,  see  Rule  4.05 
(http://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/Appellate/Supreme%20Court/Court%20Rules/MN-
Rules-of-Civil-Procedure.pdf). 
 

Service of Process Method #3:  Alternate Service 
Use this method of service only if Personal Service and Waiver of Service have not or will 
not work because you cannot find your spouse, or your spouse is uncooperative.  If you have 
tried  to  serve  your  spouse  by  Personal  Service  but  you  cannot  find  your  spouse,  or  your 
spouse is hiding to avoid service, you can ask the court to allow you to serve the papers some 
other way.   Before you can use another method of service, you must prepare an Application 
for Service by Alternate Means (DIV1302) and get an order signed by a judge.  The judge’s 
order will tell you what you have to do to serve the papers.  Frequently the order will include 
publishing  in  a  newspaper,  and  you  must  pay  the  costs  unless  you  have  a  fee  waiver  that 
covers publication costs.  

he Application for Service by Alternate Means must contain the following information: 

  T

•  The last known address of the Respondent; 
•  The Petitioner’s most recent contacts with the Respondent; 
•  The last known location of the Respondent’s employment; 

 

 

 

These can be sent by first-class mail or other reliable means, such as email or social media.

OTE! 

Most documents filed with the court are considered public documents and 
are available to the public.  Certain information that is filed with the court 
may be considered confidential based on court rule and not available to the 
public.  To keep this information confidential and not available to the public, 
you must take certain steps that are described below.   

The steps listed below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  Filers 
who are using eFS to submit their court documents must identify and 
designate their filings as required in Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 11.03 and 14.06.   

onfidential Information Form 11.1 

All social security numbers, employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers (also 
called “restricted identifiers”) must not be listed on papers you file with the court. This is to protect 
your privacy, the other parties and your children.   Only provide social security numbers, employer 
identification numbers, and financial account numbers when the court requires this information to 
be provided to the court.  For example, if you must provide the court with bank account numbers, 
or medical account numbers, do not include any account number in your document (your motion, 
supporting affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you must use Form 11.1 to list these confidential numbers.  

f account numbers are not required to be provided to the court, and the numbers appear on 
documents that are considered available to the public, (such as medical invoices or credit account 
numbers on statements) you must remove the number on the document before filing the document 
with the court. 

over Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-
public documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the 
time you file the documents with the court.  You must complete and file the “Cover Sheet for 
Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 (also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public 
documents.  The most common non-public documents are called “financial source documents.”  
Examples of financial source documents include:

treatment plan for you or your child would qualify as a medical record.   

ou must use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing other non-public documents, such as medical 

records, with the court.  One Form 11.2 cover sheet can be used for submitting all non-public 
documents.   
  

The failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being rejected 
by court administration, being available to the public, stricken from the court record, 
and sanctions from the court.

spouse have children between the ages of 6 and 17, the children may be required to attend classes 
before you can get divorced.  As the Petitioner, you must notify your spouse and/or your spouse’s 
attorney  about  the  obligation  to  attend  the  parent  programs  and/or  children’s  program.    Check 
with court administration for specific information about education requirements.

house, parenting time, child support, spousal maintenance or any other matter in the divorce, go 
to  Court  Administration  and  ask  for  the  court  form  called  “Temporary  Relief  Pending  Final 
Hearing with Children.”  If a judge signs a temporary order, that order is in effect until the judge 
signs the final order divorcing you and your spouse.

Step 12 
Scheduling Statement 

he Scheduling Statement is only needed if your case is contested. Your case is contested if your 
spouse serves you with an Answer in response to your Petition.  If you receive a letter from the 
court telling you to file a Scheduling Statement, follow the instructions in the letter and call the 
court  if  you  have  questions.  If  you  have  settled  the  case  with  your  spouse,  or  you  have  not 
received  an  Answer  from  your  spouse,  call  the  court  and  ask  if  you  still  need  to  file  the 
Scheduling Statement.  
 

Step 13 
The Next Step Is Determined by Your Spouse’s Response to  
Your Petition for Dissolution of Marriage 

nce you have filed the Summons, Petition, and Affidavit of Service with the court, your divorce 

case will proceed in one of the following ways:  

You and your spouse agree on all issues.  If you and your spouse agree on everything, 
go to Step 14 now for instructions on filling out the Stipulated Judgment and Decree. 

You receive an Answer from your spouse within 30 days of service of the Summons 
and Petition on your spouse.  
If your spouse served you with an Answer and Counterpetition, it means that your spouse 
does not agree with everything you have asked for in your Petition and that your spouse is 
asking for something different.  The first part of your spouse’s Answer will tell you the 
parts  of  your  Petition  with  which  your  spouse  partly  agrees,  totally  agrees,  or  totally 
disagrees. Once you know the issues about which you and you spouse disagree, you and 
your spouse should attempt to reach an agreement regarding those issues.  If you work out 
an agreement, go to Step 14 and fill out the Stipulated Judgment and Decree form. 

If you and your spouse DO NOT reach an agreement on all issues, your case is contested 
and  you  should  talk  to  a  lawyer.    Representing  yourself  in  a  contested  case  is  difficult.  
The  court  may  require  additional  forms,  such  as  the  Parenting/Financial  Disclosure 
Statement (FAM108). This form, and instructions, are available from court administration 
or downloaded from www.mncourts.gov/forms in the Family category. 

Your spouse sends you a letter or files a letter (other than an Answer) with the court 
stating that he or she disagrees with your Petition.  

If your spouse disagrees with your Petition your spouse is supposed to serve you with a 
written  Answer  within  thirty  (30)  days  of  the  date  your  spouse  was  served  with  the 
Summons and Petition.  If your spouse does not serve you with an Answer within 30 days 
but  your  spouse  sends  you  a  written  response  such  as  a  letter  or  memo,  or  files  an

informal response with the court or makes an appearance in court then you need to give 
your spouse one more notice* before the court will grant the divorce.    

* The notice is called Notice of Intent to Proceed to Judgment.  The notice can be 
obtained from court administration or downloaded from 
http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=15&f=248.   

Your spouse does not respond with an Answer or any other writing. Your spouse has 
30  days  to  serve  you  with  a  formal  Answer  and  Counterpetition,  stating  that  he/she 
disagrees with your Petition.  If your spouse does not serve you with an Answer and at 
least 50 days have passed since your spouse was served with the Summons and Petition, 
you  can  ask  the  court  for  a  “Default  Judgment.”    You  need  to  fill  out  the  Findings  of 
Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order for Judgment and Judgment and Decree (see Step 15), 
and Affidavit of Default, Affidavit of Non-Military Status, and Default Scheduling Request 
(see  Step  16).   50  days after your spouse was served, you  can  file these  forms with the 
court  (see  Step  17.)      Read  and  follow  the  instructions  at  Steps  16  and  17.  The 
information in this paragraph is an overview. 

Step 14 
You and Your Spouse Agree on All Issues  

f you and your spouse agree on all issues, fill out the Stipulated Findings of Fact, Conclusions of 
Law, Order for Judgment and Judgment and Decree form.  

our spouse must also fill out a Financial Affidavit disclosing his/her income and attach proof of 
income  (pay  stubs,  income  tax  returns,  etc.)    Your  spouse  must  give  you  a  copy  and  file  the 
document with the court. Your spouse should also file Form 11.2 "Cover Sheet for Non-Public 
Documents"  to  keep  the  pay  stubs  and  other  proof  of  income  documents  confidential  from the 
public. 

mportant Note:  The Stipulated Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order for Judgment and 
Judgment and Decree must be  signed and dated after the Petition is served on your spouse, or 
after your spouse signs a Waiver of Service of Summons.  Service of the Summons and Petition 
on your spouse starts the divorce action.  You and your spouse cannot settle the action until it has 
been  started  by  service  of  the  Summons  and  Petition.    If  the  Stipulated  Findings  of  Fact, 
Conclusions  of  Law,  Order  for  Judgment  and  Judgment  and  Decree  is  signed  before  the 
Summons and Petition are served, the judge will not sign the divorce decree. 

he  Stipulated  Findings  of  Fact,  Conclusions  of  Law,  Order  for  Judgment  and  Judgment  and 
Decree form tells the court that you and your spouse have reached an agreement settling all of the 
issues involved in your divorce case.  It also tells the court the exact terms of the agreement.

FILL IN THE INFORMATION ON PAGE 1 of the Stipulated Findings of Fact, Conclusions of 
Law, Order for Judgment and Judgment and Decree: 

At Paragraph B, check off whether you have or have not been represented by an attorney 
during your divorce  proceeding  and,  if you  have an attorney, fill  in that person’s name. 
 
At  Paragraph  C,  check  off  whether  your  spouse  has  or  has  not  been  represented  by an 
attorney  during  this  divorce  proceeding  and,  if  your  spouse  has  an  attorney,  fill  in  the 
attorney’s name. 

At Paragraph  D, write the date that your spouse  was handed the Summons  and Petition 
for  Dissolution  of  Marriage,  OR  the  date  your  spouse  signed  a  Waiver  of  Service  of 
Summons.  You  can  find  this  date  on  your  copy  of  the  Affidavit  of  Personal  Service  or 
Waiver of Service of Summons. 

At  Paragraph  E.,  check  the  YES  box  ONLY  if  your  spouse  served  you  with  a  written 
Answer and Counterpetition.  If you received a written Answer from your spouse, then fill 
in the date that you received the Answer and Counterpetition. 

tarting on p.2, fill in all the remaining questions. If a question does not apply, write NA or 
not  applicable.  The  Stipulated  Findings  of  Fact,  Conclusions  of  Law,  Order  for  Judgment 
and Judgment and Decree (Stipulated Judgment and Decree) is very similar to the Petition. 
There are some important differences: 
•  You  and  your  spouse  will  sign  the  Stipulated  Judgment  and  Decree  and  verify  that  all  the 
information is correct and fully  states your  agreement on  how  to end your marriage, divide 
your  property,  and  care  for  your  children.    Unlike  the  Petition,  you  cannot  claim  that 
information is "unknown." Either you or spouse should have the information. 

• 

•  The requests in the Stipulated Judgment and Decree must reflect what you both agree to. You 
may have asked for sole legal custody in the Petition, but now agree on joint legal custody. 
Complete the Stipulated Judgment and Decree based on your agreement.  
In the Petition you were not asked to say how much child support should be paid, and how 
much spousal maintenance should be paid (if you asked for maintenance.) In the Stipulated 
Judgment and Decree, you are required to fill in those amounts. You and your spouse can use 
the child support calculator to figure out the child support amounts. If you are unsure about 
how  to  use  the  calculator  or  what  the  results  mean,  talk  to  a  lawyer  or  the  child  support 
office. The calculator is available on-line at: http://childsupportcalculator.dhs.state.mn.us  
There are also written instructions available from the court for how to calculate child support.  

oth parents must help support their joint children unless they are financially unable to do 
so.  If the joint children live with your spouse, you must pay child support to your spouse. 
If the joint children live with you, your spouse must pay child support to you. If you share 
physical custody, support will be calculated based on the time the children spend with each 
of you and your incomes. Minnesota law requires an employer or other source of funds to 
withhold child support from the employee’s paycheck and send it to the county where you

are  getting  the  divorce.  The  county  will  then  send  the  child  support  to  the parent  who is 
supposed to receive it.  

 
Signing the Stipulated Judgment and Decree 

• 

If  you  have  any  questions  about  your  legal  rights,  about  financial  or  tax 
consequences, about child support or any other issue get advice from a lawyer before 
you sign the Stipulated Judgment and Decree. 

•  Do  not  sign  the Stipulated Judgment and  Decree unless the Summons  and Petition 
have been served on your spouse.  Under the signature lines, check off whether you 
are or are not represented by an attorney. If you are represented by an attorney, the 
attorney also signs the agreement and fills in his or her name, address, phone number 
and  attorney identification number.   If you  are not represented by an attorney, sign 
the Petitioner’s Waiver of Counsel.  If you spouse is not represented by an attorney, 
your spouse must sign the Respondent's Waiver of Counsel.  
If you or your spouse receives public assistance, take the signed Stipulated Judgment 
and  Decree  to  the  office  of  the  County  Attorney.    The  County Attorney  represents 
the  child support office. The county must approve the child support provisions and 
sign in the designated blank on the form. 

• 

•  Make copies of the signed Stipulated Judgment and Decree for you and your spouse.  

Then go to Step 16.  

Step 15 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Judgment and Decree 

he Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order for Judgment and Judgment and Decree is the 

form that the Judge signs.   It is your “Divorce Decree.” 

  If you do not have an agreement with your spouse and your spouse did not serve you 
with an Answer, copy the information from your Petition into the Findings form.  The 
Petition  and  Findings  must  be  consistent.  If  information  in  the  Petition  is  no  longer 
accurate, such as a debt has been paid off, or you have a new address, put the new and 
correct  information  in  the  Findings,  with  a  note  explaining  the  difference.    In  the 
Petition you were not asked to say how much child support should be paid, and how much 
spousal maintenance should be paid (if you asked for maintenance.) In the Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law, Order for Judgment and Judgment and Decree you are asked to fill in 
those amounts to inform the judge how much support you think should be paid. You can use 
the  child  support  calculator  to  figure  out  the  child  support  amounts.  If  you  do  not  have 
information about your spouse's income, you can ask the court to order child support based 
on other credible evidence you have about your spouse's potential income. This might include 
evidence of past earnings, education and other factors. The court can also order support based 
on evidence of what the parent is able to earn, or based on 150% of the minimum wage. If 
you are unsure about how to use the calculator or what the results mean, talk to a lawyer or

Judgment, Judgment and Decree) You may make the copy yourself. 
a. 

If  you  and  Respondent  signed  a  Stipulated  Judgment  and  Decree  and  it 
states in the Stipulated Judgment and Decree that service of the Judgment 
and Decree can be made by mail, do the following: Have someone other 
than you, who is at least 18 years of age, mail to the Respondent a copy of 
the final Decree you obtained from the court.  The Decree must be sent by 
first  class  U.S.  mail  with  sufficient  postage,  addressed  to  Respondent’s 
home  address.    If  you  do  not  have  a  current  address  for  Respondent, 
address the envelope to Respondent’s last known address.  
If  you  and  Respondent  did  not  sign  a  Stipulated  Judgment  and  Decree, 
someone  else,  at  least  18  years  of  age,  must  serve  the  Decree  on 
Respondent by handing it to Respondent. 

b. 

The  server  must  fill  out  the  Affidavit  of  Service  by  Mail  form  if  service  was  by 
mail.  The server should fill out the Affidavit of Personal Service if the Judgment 
and Decree was handed to Respondent.  File the Affidavit with the court to prove 
that  you  served  the  Respondent  with  the  final  Decree.    Serving  the  Respondent 
with the Decree helps prove the Respondent knew what was ordered, in case you 
need to ask the court to enforce the order through a contempt motion. 

ou can then file the Affidavit of Service in person or by mail with the Court Administrator. 

OTHER STEPS AFTER ENTRY OF THE DECREE   

t is the responsibility of the parties to take all necessary steps to put into effect the orders of the 
court. For example, if you changed your name you will need to get your driver’s license and 
social security card changed to reflect your new legal name. If you or Respondent were awarded 
pension or medical benefits, the company or provider will need to see the Decree and may have 
other requirements before making the changes ordered by the court. If you and/or Respondent 
own real estate, there are additional steps you must take to transfer the title to the real estate to 
the party who was granted the real estate in the Decree.

Under Minnesota law, both spouses have an interest in real estate, even if only one spouse’s 
name is on the deed or title of the property.  

roof of divorce and proof of who was awarded interests in the real estate is usually recorded 

in the real estate records before selling or mortgaging the property after the divorce. 

o give that proof, the complete divorce decree can be filed in the real estate records. Or, a short 

version of the divorce decree can be filed, called Summary Real Estate Disposition Judgment 
Form (SREDJ). The SREDJ only includes information needed for real estate title purposes. If 
you file the SREDJ, information about your children, work, and other personal matters is not 
available in the county real estate records.  The Minnesota Judicial Branch publishes a set of 
instructions to help you with the SREDJ process. Those instructions can be found on the court’s 
website at http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=15&f=572.  

Get legal advice from an attorney if you are not sure what actions to take with your real 
estate.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
