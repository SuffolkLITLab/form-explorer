Important Notices and Resources 

The Court has forms and instructions, for some types of cases, as a general guide to the court 
process. These instructions explain the steps in more detail and answer common questions, but are 
not a full guide to the law. Court employees may be able to give general information on court rules 
and procedures, but they cannot give legal advice.  

Have a question about court forms or instructions? 

•  Visit www.MNCourts.gov/SelfHelp 
•  Call the MN Courts Self Help Center at (651) 435-6535 

ot sure what to do about a legal issue or need advice? 

•  Talk with a lawyer 
•  Visit www.MNCourts.gov/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx 

 

Helpful materials may be found at your public county law library. For a directory, see http://mn.gov/law-
library/research-links/county-law-libraries.jsp . For more information, contact your court administrator or call 
the Minnesota State Law Library at 651-297-7651.

Instructions – Objection (Probate) 
PRO1001      State       ENG     11/19                   www.mncourts.gov/forms

General Information about Probate 

isit the Probate, Wills, and Estates Help Topic for more detailed information about probate, the 

difference between informal and formal probate, and read some Frequently Asked Questions 
(FAQs) about the process. 

f you are not sure whether to object to something in a probate case, you should talk with an 
attorney. The information in these Instructions is not meant to be legal advice, but is a general 
guide to explain the legal process and steps for objecting in a probate case. 

f you do not understand any of these procedures, talk to an attorney. Court staff cannot give 
legal advice.   

ou can use these forms object to something in a probate case if: 

  You are an interested person as defined by Minnesota law [Minn. Stat. § 524.1-201(33)].  
  The estate is going through an informal probate or formal probate court case.   

If you are objecting to something in a probate case, a judge or referee will hold a hearing.  

Filing the Objection only tells the judge that you are objecting to something.  The way to let 
the judge know what you want to happen instead is to file a petition.  For example, if you 
are objecting to the INFORMAL appointment of a personal representative or to the 
INFORMAL probate of a Will, a petition for formal appointment of a personal representative (and 
if there is a Will, formal probate of the WILL) must be filed to keep the case moving forward.   

You can find the definition of “formal probate” online at http://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Probate-
Wills-and-Estates.aspx.  
 

 

Step 1

https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/524.1-201.  Explain why you are an interested 
person.   

6.  How did this probate case start?

b.  If it is a FORMAL probate case, check “b” and list the date of the petition.

Personal Representative.

If you are represented by an attorney, then the attorney will fill out the rest of the form.  If you are 
representing yourself, then you will need to finalize the form. 

10. Date the form and sign your name.  When you sign the Objection, you are signing under 
penalty of perjury. This means you are saying that everything in the form is true and 
correct; if you know something in the form is not true when you sign it, you could be 
found guilty of the crime of perjury (see Minn. Stat. § 609.48, 
https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.48). 

11. Fill out the box: check “Self-Represented,” and then print your name, address, email, and 

telephone number (leave “firm” and “attorney license number” blank).

Step 2 

Make Copies 

ake a copy of all the forms you have filled out for each of the following: 

  Your records, 
  The person appointed or nominated as Personal Representative, and  
  Each interested person, including those listed in the Application or Petition.  

Step 3 

File the Objection (Probate) 

Get the Notice of Hearing from the Court 

File the original Objection (and any other papers you have completed). There will be a filing fee 
due when you file. You can make checks payable to “District Court.”  

If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can ask for a fee waiver by completing the forms in 
the In Forma Pauperis/IFP packet of forms. If a judge does not sign the fee waiver order, then 
you must pay the filing fee before Court Administration can process your forms. 

The Court will give you a Notice of Hearing form that includes the hearing date.

Step 4 

Serve the Personal Representative and all Interested Persons  

File the Affidavit of Mailing (PRO1003) 

You need to arrange to have the Notice of Hearing and a copy of your Objection served on the 
following individuals (or their attorneys, if they are represented): 

  The person appointed or nominated as the Personal Representative, and 
  All interested persons, including all those listed in the Application or Petition. 

Service can be done by regular first class U.S. Mail; you can mail the papers yourself, or you can 
have another adult mail for you.  The person who mails copies of your papers to the individuals 
listed above should fill out an Affidavit of Mailing (PRO1003), and sign it under penalty of perjury. 

IMPORTANT! The completed Affidavit of Mailing (PRO1003) needs to be filed with court 
administration before the hearing date.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
