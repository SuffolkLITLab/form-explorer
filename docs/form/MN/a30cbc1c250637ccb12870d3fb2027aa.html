   Subd.  6(1),  because  the  child(ren)  is/are  abandoned  or  without  parent,  guardian,  or 

custodian. 

  1

 

   Subd. 6(2), because the child(ren) (a) has/have been a victim(s) of physical or sexual 
abuse as defined in Minn. Stat. §  626.556, subd.  2;  or (b) reside(s)  with or  has/have 
resided with a victim of domestic  child abuse  as  defined  in  Minn. Stat.  § 260C.007, 
subd. 13; (c) reside(s) with or would reside with a perpetrator of domestic child abuse 
or child abuse as defined in Minn. Stat. § 260C.007, subd. 13; or (d) is/are a victim(s) 
of emotional maltreatment as defined in Minn. Stat. § 260C.007, subd. 15. 

   Subd.  6(3),  because  the  child(ren)  is/are  without  necessary  food,  clothing,  shelter, 
education,  or  other  required  care  for  the  child(ren)'s  physical  or  mental  health  or 
morals because the child(ren)'s parent, guardian, or custodian is unable or unwilling to 
provide that care. 

   Subd. 6(4), because the child(ren) is/are without the special care made necessary by a 
physical, mental, or emotional condition because the child(ren)'s parent, guardian, or 
custodian is unable or unwilling to provide that care. 

   Subd.  6(5),  because  the  child(ren)  is/are  medically  neglected,  which  includes,  but  is 
not limited to, the withholding of medically indicated treatment from a disabled infant 
with  a  life-threatening  condition.    The  term  "withholding  of  medically  indicated 
treatment"  means  the  failure  to  respond  to  the  infant's  life-threatening  conditions  by 
providing treatment, including appropriate nutrition, hydration, and medication which, 
in  the  treating  physician's  or  physicians'  reasonable  medical  judgment,  will  be  most 
likely to be effective in ameliorating or correcting all conditions, except that the term 
does  not  include  the  failure  to  provide  treatment  other  than  appropriate  nutrition, 
hydration,  or  medication  to  an  infant  when,  in  the  treating  physician's  or  physicians' 
reasonable medical  judgment:  (i)  the infant is chronically  and irreversibly  comatose; 
(ii)  the  provision  of  the  treatment  would  merely  prolong  dying,  not  be  effective  in 
ameliorating  or  correcting  all  of  the  infant's  life-threatening  conditions,  or  otherwise 
be futile in terms of  the  survival of  the infant; or (iii) the provision  of the treatment 
would be virtually futile in terms of the survival of the infant and the treatment itself 
under the circumstances would be inhumane.

between  the  parent  and  the  responsible  social  services  agency  under  Minn.  Stat.  § 
260C.227. 

  Subd.  6(7),  because  the  child(ren)  has/have  been  placed  for  adoption  or  care  in 

violation of law. 

  Subd.  6(8),  because  the  child(ren)  is/are  without  proper  parental  care  because  of  the 
emotional,  mental,  or  physical  disability,  or  state  of  immaturity  of  the  child(ren)'s 
parent, guardian, or other custodian. 

  Subd.  6(9),  because  the  child(ren)  is/are  one(s)  whose  behavior,  condition,  or 
environment  is  such  as  to  be  injurious  or  dangerous  to  the  child(ren)  or  others.    An 
injurious or dangerous environment may include, but is not limited to, the exposure of 
a child to criminal activity in the child's home. 

  Subd. 6(10), because the child(ren) is/are experiencing  growth delays, which may be 
referred to as failure to thrive, that have been diagnosed by a physician and are due to 
parental neglect. 

  Subd. 6(11), because the child(ren) is a sexually exploited youth. 

   Subd. 6(12), because the child(ren) has/have committed a delinquent act or a juvenile 

petty offense before becoming ten (10) years old. 

   Subd. 6(13), because the child is a runaway. 

   Subd. 6(14), because the child is a habitual truant. 

   Subd.  6(15),  because  the  child  has  been  found  incompetent  to  proceed  or  has  been 
found not guilty by reason of mental illness or mental deficiency in connection with a 
delinquency  proceeding,  a  certification  under  Minn.  Stat.  §  260B.125,  an  extended 
jurisdiction juvenile prosecution, or a proceeding involving a juvenile petty offense. 

   Subd.  6(16),  because  the  child  has  a  parent  whose  parental  rights  to  one  or  more 
children were involuntarily terminated or whose custodial rights to another child have 
been  involuntarily  transferred  to  a  relative  and  there  is  a  case  plan  prepared  by  the 
responsible  social  services  agency  documenting  a  compelling  reason  why  filing  the 
termination of parental rights petition under Minn. Stat. § 260C.301, subd. 3, is not in 
the best interests of the child.

box has been checked.  If the person indicates that the social services agency has not been contacted, the 
court administrator must reject the petition as incomplete and must not file the petition.   If the person 
has contacted the social services agency, the court administrator may file the petition and must submit 
the petition to a judge for further review.

petition,  a  judge  shall  review  the  petition.    If  the  judge  determines  that  the  petition  and  attachments 
establish a prima facie case that a CHIPS matter exists and that the child is the subject of that matter, the 
court  shall  set  the  matter  for  an  Admit/Deny  Hearing  pursuant  to  Rule  46  and  shall  direct  the  court 
administrator to serve a summons and notice pursuant to Rule 44.  The judge shall not allow a petition to 
proceed if it appears, after reviewing the answer to Question 5, that the sole purpose of the petition is to 
modify  custody  between  the  parents  or  if  it  fails  to  set  forth  the  information  required  in  Rules  45.02, 
subd. 1, and 45.03.

Pursuant  to  review  required  under  Minnesota  Statutes  §  260C.141,  subdivision  1(b),  the 
undersigned Judge of District Court has reviewed the foregoing Child in Need of Protection or 
Services Petition and has determined that the petition establishes a prima facie case that a child 
in need of protection or  services  matter  exists  and the child is  the  subject of  that matter.   The

upon the parties and participants.  Notice to the services agency shall be accomplished by

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
