General Information About Formal Probate 

isit the Probate, Wills, and Estates Help Topic (http://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Probate-Wills-and-
Estates.aspx) for more detailed information about probate, the difference between informal and formal 
probate, and read some Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about the process. 

If you are not sure what type of probate you need to file, or if you need to file at all, you should talk 
with an attorney. The information in these Instructions is not meant to be legal advice, but is a general 
guide to explain the legal process and steps for filing a Petition for Formal Probate.  

f you do not understand any of these procedures, talk to an attorney. Court staff cannot give legal 
advice. 

Do I need to go through probate? 

Generally, filing a probate case with the court is not necessary if the person who died:  

•  Did not own any real estate in their name alone, and 

•  Owned personal property in their name alone with a total value less than $75,000. 

If you do not need to go through probate, you may be able to collect personal property (such as money 
in a bank account) or transfer title to motor vehicles owned by the person who died using an Affidavit for 
Collection of Personal Property. Visit http://www.mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=31&p=88 for more 
information about this process.  

efinitions you may find helpful as you complete the forms: 

•  Beneficiary – A person or organization named in a legal document to receive money or other 

property when someone dies.  Examples of legal documents include Will, trust, insurance policy, 
payable-on-death account, annuity, and retirement/pension account. 

•  Codicil – A legal document that is used to make changes to an existing Will. Generally, codicils 

add to or supplement a Will rather than replace a Will. 

•  Creditor – Any person or business that has a financial claim against (is owed money by) the 

estate. 

•  Decedent – The person who has died.  

•  Demandant – A person who demands that they receive notice in a probate proceeding by filing a

5.  Fill in the street address, city, state, zip code, and county of the legal residence at the time of the 
person’s death. If you are not sure what would be considered the legal residence, you should 
speak with an attorney.  

6.  The first question in #6 is whether the person who died lived in Minnesota at the time of death.  If 

the answer is Yes, then you can skip to #7. 

If the answer is No (the Decedent did not live in Minnesota when they died), then you need to 
give the court more information about why you are filing for probate in this state.  The next 
question is whether they owned property in Minnesota when they died.  If Yes, list what county 
the property is in.   

If your answer to the first two questions in #6 is No, then you should talk to an attorney to see if 
Minnesota is the right state to file in.  

Amount of 
assets 

Amount 
of debt 

 

7.  Estimate the value of any assets the person who died had at the time of their death and write the 

amounts next to each type.  

Then, estimate the total amount of debt the person who died had at the time of their death.  

If you do not know the answers to these questions because you do not have access to the records 
of the person who died yet, list the assets and debts to the best of your knowledge.   

If there is no real property, then the value of the personal property in the estate should be over 
$75,000 for Formal Probate. If the value of these assets is less than $75,000 and there is no real 
property, you will not need to go through probate. Visit the Probate, Wills & Estates Help Topic 
for more information (http://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Probate-Wills-and-Estates.aspx).

o  A Will is a document describing what a person wants to happen to their property after 

they have died.  

o  A codicil is a document that is used to make changes to an existing Will. Rather than 
replacing a Will with a whole new document, a codicil is an additional document used 
to explain or change an existing Will.  

o  A separate writing gifting personal property is a document that lists what the testator 
wants to have happen to specific items of tangible personal property (other than cash, 
coin collections, or property used in a trade/business) that are not specifically 
addressed in the Will. 

Submit any and all of the originals of these documents that you may have. If you only have copies 
and not the original documents, you can submit the copies along with a Statement of Contents of 
Lost, Destroyed, or Otherwise Unavailable Will (PRO1206).  

9.  Check the boxes that describe where the Will, codicil (if any), and separate writing (if any) can be 

found, checking all that may apply.

12. Fill in the name of the person who was nominated by the Will to serve as personal representative 

 

hen, check one of the boxes describing whether the nominated personal representative is willing 
and able to serve in this role.  

OTE: There is a lot of important information you should know about personal representatives.  

Before you fill out #11, please read the rest of this section. 

If the person who was nominated is not willing or can’t serve, fill in the name of a person who 
has priority, is willing to serve as the personal representative, and is not disqualified. 

o  Minnesota law contains a list stating who can serve as the personal representative of 

an estate, in order of priority (see Minn. Stat. § 524.3-203, 
https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/524.3-203). Persons who are not 
disqualified to serve as a personal representative have priority in the following order: 

1. The person named in a Will as the one that should serve as the personal 
representative. 

2. The surviving spouse, if they are entitled to receive property according to the 
Will.  

3. Other people who are entitled to receive property under the Will.  

4. The surviving spouse, if they are not entitled to receive property according to 
the Will or there is not a Will.  

5. Other heirs, if there is not a Will.  

6. Any creditor, as long as 45 days has passed since the time of death.  

7. A conservator that has not been discharged, as long as 90 days have passed 
since the time of death and no probate case has already been opened with the 
court.  

If you are not sure who should be listed as a personal representative or whether they 
are disqualified, you should talk with an attorney.

someone else to serve in their place, or they may waive their right to nominate 
someone to serve in their place. To waive this right, use the Renunciation of Priority for

13. Check a box to say whether the Will states that there should be no bond, the minimum bond, or a 
specific amount of bond (if this is the case, write in the amount). If the Will did not say anything 
about a bond, check “unspecified.”   

14. Check a box to say whether the Will states that the estate should go through unsupervised 

administration, supervised administration, or administration was not specified (the Will did not 
specifically say what kind of probate process should be used).

15. Check a box to say whether you have received any demands for notice, and if you have, whether 

you have given proper notice to anyone who has filed a demand for notice.

that is owed money or property by the estate) asking that they be given notice when a 
probate case is opened, when documents are filed into the case, and when orders are 
issued.  

o  Check with the court to see whether any demands for notice have been filed.  If any 

demands for notice have been filed, you must serve a Notice of Intent to File Document 
After Demand for Notice (PRO907) at least 14 days before filing the Petition with the

16. Check all of the boxes that apply to describe the family situation of the person who died.  There 

may be unfamiliar words or phrases (like “surviving issue”).  Be sure to read the definitions below 
so that you can answer #16 accurately.

married, was married but their spouse died first, or was divorced and was not 
remarried at the time they died.  

o  Decedent left no surviving issue: Check this box if the person who died did not have 

any living issue at the time they died. “Issue” means direct lineal descendants, such as 
children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc., whether by blood or by adoption.  

o  All issue of Decedent are issue of Decedent’s surviving spouse: Check this box if the 

person who died never had children (by blood or adoption) with someone other than 
the spouse they were married to at the time they died, so that all children, 
grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc. of the person who died are also related to the 
surviving spouse.

grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc. of the surviving spouse are not related to the 
person who died.  

 

17

 

17. For this question, you will need to gather information about all of the interested parties for the 

probate case. For each interested party, you will need the party’s: 

o  Full name 
o  Mailing address 
o  Relationship to the person who died 
o  Legal interest in the probate case 
o  Birth date (if the party is a minor) or date of death (if the party is deceased) 

ist the spouse of the decedent first, if there is one. Repeat this for each interested party until 
all are listed.  

For the familial relationship and legal interest section, see pages 2 and 3 of these Instructions 
for definitions of devisee, heir, personal representative, and creditor. The “Other” section can 
be used to add relationships and interests that do not fit in the other boxes, including (but not 
limited to): 

o  Attorney General – If the person who died included any charities as devisees, the 

attorney general is considered an interested person that must be listed.

o  Demandant – If any creditors have submitted a Demand for Notice, they are 

considered interested persons that must be listed.   

o  Fiduciary – If a person is a guardian, conservator, attorney-in-fact, trustee, or personal 
representative for one of the other interested persons, that fiduciary must be listed.   

o  Foreign Consulate – If the person who died or any of the heirs or devisees was born in 
a foreign country, the Consulate of that country is considered an interested person 
that must be listed.  

o  Parent of a minor interested person – If one of the interested persons is a minor, the 

parent of that person must be listed.  

If you are not sure whether to list a person or entity as an interested person, or you are not 
sure whether you have included all of the interested persons, it is a good idea to get some 
legal advice.  

18

 

18. Check a box to say whether all of the people you listed as heirs in Question #17 lived at least 120 
hours longer than the date the Decedent died. If any of the heirs died within the 120 hours after 
Decedent’s death, list that person’s name and their date of death.

19. The answers you give to this question will create what is called a “negative allegation 

statement,” which specifically tells the court that there are no other heirs or devisees other than 
the ones listed in your Petition. Only check the boxes that apply to your situation.  

o

who died that had the deceased child as a parent).  

If you checked boxes (2), (3), and/or (4), you do not need to continue with the rest of this question. If 
you did not check either of those boxes, continue to box (5).

 

 

 Unsupervised administration does not require court approval of every action 
taken by the personal representative, who has the authority to distribute 
estate assets without a court order.  

In a supervised administration, the court directly supervises the personal 
representative’s actions and a court order is needed to distribute probate 
assets.  

  You can request a certain amount of bond or to have either a supervised or 
unsupervised administration, but ultimately this decision will be up to the 
judge.  

If you are not sure whether to request a bond or how to choose between supervised and 
unsupervised administration of the estate, you should talk with an attorney.

sent the notice to, and then 

2.  File each Affidavit of Service by Mail with the court.

You will receive an Order for Formal Probate of Will and Appointment of Personal Representative and 
Letters Testamentary after you have filed documents discussed at the hearing, if any. 

Step 12 

Get Certified Copies of the Letters Testamentary 

fter the Letters Testamentary (the document that gives the personal representative the authority to 

handle the administration of the estate) have been issued by the judge, you can get certified copies 
from court administration. There will be a charge for each certified copy (see 
http://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Court-Fees/District-Court-
Fees.aspx?cat=probate&cookieCheck=true).   

Certified copies of the Letters Testamentary may be needed for certain tasks, including but not 
limited to: 

•  presentation to banks and other financial institutions to close the accounts of the person who 

died or to open an estate bank account, if necessary; 
transferring title to estate real estate; 

• 
•  presentation to the Department of Motor Vehicles to transfer title to a vehicle. 

Step 13 

Administer and Close the Estate 

fter you have been appointed as the personal representative by the Letters Testamentary, you will 
need to administer the estate of the person who died. Administering the estate includes, but is not 
limited to: 

•  Collection, inventory, and appraisal of assets.  
•  Paying the taxes and debts of the person who died.  
•  Distributing remaining assets to the proper parties as specified by law.  
•  Preparing an Inventory (PRO912) and Final Account (PRO913) and closing the estate.  

The estate cannot be closed until it has been at least 4 months from the date the Notice to Creditors was 
published. If you have questions about how to administer and close the estate, it is a good idea to talk 
to an attorney.
