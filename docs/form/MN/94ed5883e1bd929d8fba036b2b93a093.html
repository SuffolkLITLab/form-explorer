      <pre>FILING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION WITH THE COURT 

Instructions for Restricted Identifiers and  
Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents 

 

Most documents filed with the court are considered public documents and are available for 
viewing by the public.  Certain information that is filed with the court may be considered 
confidential based on court rule, statute, or order of the court and not available to the public.  To 
keep this information confidential and not available to the public, you must take certain steps that 
are described below. 

WHEN TO USE FORM CON111 – CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION FORM 11.1  
All social security numbers, employer identification numbers, or other taxpayer identification 
numbers, and financial account numbers (also called “restricted identifiers”) must not be listed 
on papers you file with the court. This is to protect your privacy, the other parties, and your 
children.   Only provide restricted identifiers when the court requires this information to be 
provided.  For example, if you must provide the court with bank account numbers, do not include 
the full account number in your document (your petition, supporting affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you 
must use Form 11.1 to list these confidential numbers.  

orm 11.1 (CON111) can be found at www.mncourts.gov/forms (choose “Confidential 

Information” court form category). 

edacting Confidential Information 

If restricted identifiers are not required to be provided to the court, but the account number, 
social security number, or other restricted identifier appears on documents that are considered 
available to the public, (such as an insurance policy number) you must remove the number on the 
document before filing the document with the court.  This is called “redacting” the information.  
You can use a black marker or white correction fluid to cover up the restricted identifiers, but 
you must make sure the restricted identifiers are completely covered up.  As an alternative, if you 
are filing electronically, you may use software designed specifically to redact documents. 

OW TO USE FORM CON111: 

1.  Fill in the top part of this form.  If you already have a court case, the information will be the same 

as it appears in other court documents in your case. 

a.  County – the name of the county where you are filing your case 

b.  Judicial District – the number of the judicial district the county is in (there are ten 

judicial districts in Minnesota; for help in finding your judicial district number, look at 
the map on the court’s website at https://mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx)   

c.  Court File Number – if this form is one of the first forms you are filing in this case, you 
may not have a court file number yet, and you can leave this part blank; if you will be 
filing this form in an existing court case, then you can find the court file number at the 
top of the first page of other court documents

FILING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION WITH THE COURT 

 

d.  Plaintiff/Petitioner – this is the party who is starting the case, or who started the case 

originally (the roles never change; if you were the plaintiff or petitioner when a case first 
started, then you are still the plaintiff or petitioner) 

e.  Defendant/Respondent – the name of the other party 

2.  There are three sections on this form: Social Security Numbers, Account Numbers, and 

Employer / Other Tax Payer Identification Numbers.  Put the necessary confidential numbers 
in the correct section. 

a.  Social Security Numbers 

i.  Name – in this column, you will print your name, the other party’s names, and 
any other names (such as children involved in the case) on the lines provided 

ii.  Party or Role – in this column, you will list what role each person has in the 

case (for example, “Petitioner” or “Child”)  

iii.  Social Security Number – list each person’s Social Security Number (or if a 

person does not have a Social Security Number, you can list something like 
“none”) 

b.  Account Numbers – this is where you will list bank or credit union account numbers, 

retirement account numbers, etc.; list the name of the financial institution and the account 
number 

c.  Employer / Other Taxpayer Identification Numbers – use this section for listing 

employers and employer identification numbers 

3.  At the bottom of the form, you will see “Information supplied by:” – print your name here 

(because you are the person giving the information to the court). 

4.  Next, sign the form, print your street address and email address, and date the form. NOTE:  If 

you are representing yourself in court, do not fill in the blanks for “Attorney Reg. #” and “Firm.” 

WHEN TO USE CON112 - COVER SHEET FOR NON-PUBLIC DOCUMENTS FORM 
11.2:  

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-
public documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the 
time you file the documents with the court.  When filing documents in paper form (not using the 
e-Filing System) you must complete and file the “Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 
11.2 (also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public documents.  The most 
common non-public documents are called “financial source documents.”  Examples of financial 
source documents include: 

•  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and business 

expenses 

•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers

FILING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION WITH THE COURT 

You may also need to submit other documents that court rules identify as non-public such as 
court services records.  Court services records are records that are required to be filed with the 
court to assist the court with resolution of the matter before the court.  Some examples of court 
services records include: 

•  custody evaluations 
•  court visitor reports 
•  guardian ad litem reports (family case types) 
•  psychological examiner reports 
•  probation violation reports 
•  alternative dispute resolution reports 
•  commitment reports   

There are other non-public documents identified in court rules that you may file with the court as 
supporting documents, such as medical records and death certificates.  For example, a report 
from a doctor that provides a medical diagnosis or treatment plan for you would qualify as a 
medical record.  See Rules of Public Access to Records of the Judicial Branch and the Case 
Records Table (https://www.mncourts.gov/SupremeCourt/Court-Rules.aspx) for more 
information on what court records are deemed non-public and not accessible to the public.  It is 
the filer’s responsibility to identify all non-public documents at the time of filing with the court.   

NOTE:  Form 11.2 cover sheet is only required when filing non-public documents in paper form 
and when filing in public case types.  Form 11.2 cover sheet is optional when using the e-Filing 
System.   

NOTE:  Do not use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing public documents that contain 
information you think “should” be treated as confidential.  You must seek approval from the 
court and the court must grant your request before you file a public document that you want 
treated as confidential. 

he failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being rejected by 
court  administration,  being  available  to  the  public,  stricken  from  the  court  record,  and 
may include sanctions from the court. 

OW TO USE COURT FORM CON112:  

1.   Fill in the top part of this form with the same information as it appears in other court documents in 

your case.  

2.  Check the boxes or choose from the drop-down menu that best describes the non-public document you 
are filing. If you are filing more than one of the types of non-public documents listed on Form 11.2 
cover sheet, only one Form 11.2 cover sheet is required and you should check all appropriate boxes. 
NOTE: You may not need to file every type of non-public document listed on this form. 

3.  Print your name and address on the form, sign and date it. NOTE: If you are representing yourself in 

court, do not fill in the blanks for Attorney Reg. # and Law Firm.

4.  In order to submit financial source documents or other non-public documents to the court in paper form, 

first you must complete the Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2.  Second, you must file 
the actual financial source documents or other non-public documents apart from Form 11.2 cover sheet 
(CON112).  You do NOT have to serve a copy of CON112 on the other parties; it only gets filed with 
the court. However, in most cases, you must serve copies of the financial documents (paystubs, etc.) or 
non-public documents (court services records, medical records, etc.) on the other parties.   

Helpful materials may be found at your public county law library.  For a directory, see

your court administrator or call the Minnesota State Law Library at 651-297-7651.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
