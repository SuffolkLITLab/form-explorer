Children to allow you to sell or otherwise dispose of specific property or items.  List the 
specific  property  or  items  here  and  then  explain  why  the  court  should  grant  you 
permission to sell or otherwise dispose of this property or these items. 

If  you  asked  the  court  for  additional  relief,  explain  why  the  court  should  grant  this 
request. 

Sign your Affidavit under penalty of perjury.  This means you are stating that the 
information in the Affidavit is true to the best of your knowledge.  Perjury is the crime of 
intentionally lying or misrepresenting the truth, punishable by jail or other sanctions. 

Step 3 
Fill Out the Parenting / Financial Disclosure Statement Form  

ill  out  the  Parenting  /  Financial  Disclosure  Statement  form  (FAM108).    This  form  gives  the 
Court  background  information  regarding  you  and  the  other  party.    Both  the  Instructions 
(FAM107) and the Parenting / Financial Disclosure Statement form (FAM108) can be found at 
www.mncourts.gov/forms under the court form category of Family, or can be obtained from the 
court administrator.  

Step 4 
Fill Out the Confidential Information Form 11.1 and Cover Sheet for Non-
Public Documents Form 11.2 when needed  

Most documents filed with the court are considered public documents and 
are available to the public.  Certain information that is filed with the court 
may be considered confidential based on court rule and not available to the 
public.  To keep this information confidential and not available to the public, 
you must take certain steps that are described below.   

The steps listed below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  Filers 
who are using eFS to submit their court documents must identify and 
designate their filings as required in Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 11.03 and 14.06.   

Confidential Information Form 11.1 

All social security numbers, employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers 
(also called “restricted identifiers”) must not be listed on papers you file with the court. This is to 
protect your privacy, the other parties and your children.   Only provide social security numbers, 
employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers when the court requires this 
information to be provided to the court.  For example, if you must provide the court with bank 
account numbers, or medical account numbers, do not include any account number in your

document (your motion, supporting affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you must use Form 11.1 to list these 
confidential numbers.  

If account numbers are not required to be provided to the court, and the numbers appear on 
documents that are considered available to the public, (such as medical invoices or credit account 
numbers on statements) you must remove the number on the document before filing the 
document with the court. 

over Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-
public documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the 
time you file the documents with the court.  You must complete and file the “Cover Sheet for 
Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 (also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public 
documents.  The most common non-public documents are called “financial source documents.”  
Examples of financial source documents include: 

•  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and business 

expenses 

•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers   

ou may also need to submit other documents that court rules identify as non-public documents, 
such as a medical record.  For example, a report from a doctor that provides a medical diagnosis 
or treatment plan for you or your child would qualify as a medical record.   

You must use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing other non-public documents, such as 
medical records, with the court.  One Form 11.2 cover sheet can be used for submitting all non-
public documents.   
  

The failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being 

rejected by court administration, being available to the public, stricken from the 
court record, and sanctions from the court. 

ee Rule 11 of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice for more information about how to file 

documents containing social security numbers, financial account numbers, “financial source

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
