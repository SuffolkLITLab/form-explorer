11.   I  understand  that  if  the  Court  grants  my  petition  to  represent  myself,  I  will  be 
responsible for preparing my case for trial and trying my case.  I understand that I will be 
bound by the same rules as an attorney.  I understand that if I fail to do something in a 
timely  manner,  or  make  a  mistake  because  of  my  unfamiliarity  with  the  law,  I  will  be 
bound by those decisions and must deal with them myself.    

12.   I  understand  the  Court  will  schedule  a  probable  cause  hearing,  if  one  has  not 
already been held.  At the probable cause hearing, I can make a motion that the complaint 
or  indictment  filed  against  me  be  dismissed  for  lack  of  probable  cause.    That  the 
preparation for, conduct of, and decisions made relating to that hearing will be  my sole 
responsibility.

police or others regarding the charges;  

iii. evidence discovered as a result of my statements or as a result of the 
evidence seized in a search.  

 

iv. identification evidence from a line-up or photographic identification. 

  v. evidence the prosecution believes indicates that I committed one or more 

other crimes.  

 

 
or not the evidence the prosecution has could be used against me at trial in this case.  

b. That I have the right to a pretrial hearing before a judge to determine whether

c.  That I can testify at the hearing if I want to, but my testimony could not be 
 
used as substantive evidence against me if I went to trial and could only be used against 
me if I was charged with the crime of perjury.  (Perjury means testifying falsely.)  

 

d.  That  the  preparation  for,  conduct  of,  and  decisions  made  relating  to  that 

hearing will be my sole responsibility.  

14.   I understand that I am entitled to a trial by jury of 12 persons in a felony case and 
a jury of 6 persons in other cases and all jurors must agree before they can find me guilty. 
Also,  all  jurors  must  agree  before  they  can  find  me  not  guilty.    I  also  understand  that  I 
may ask for a trial to the judge and not a jury.  I further understand that I will conduct all 
phases  of  the  trial  including,  but  not  limited  to:    writing  and  filing  motions,  making 
arguments to the Court, selection of the jury, cross-examination of the witnesses for the 
prosecution,  direct  examination  of  my  witnesses,  making  all  objections,  opening 
statement and closing argument.  

15.   I understand that I am entitled to require any witnesses that I think are favorable 

to me to appear and testify at my trial by use of a subpoena as approved by the judge.  

16.  I understand:  

longer prison term.  

 

a.  That a person who has prior convictions or a prior conviction can be given a 

 

 
b.  That  the  maximum  statutory  penalty  that  the  Court  could  impose  for  this 
crime (taking into consideration any prior conviction or convictions) is imprisonment for 
_______ years, and/or a fine of $__________.  That if a minimum sentence is required by 
statute the Court may impose a sentence of imprisonment of not less than ______ months 
for this crime.  

17.   I  understand  that  if  the  Court  grants  my  petition  to  represent  myself,  the  Court 
may appoint advisory counsel.  I understand that if the Court appoints advisory counsel I 
have  the  right  to  consult  with  advisory  counsel  in  making  any  decisions  regarding  the 
conduct  of  this  case.    However,  I  am  under  no  obligation  to  seek  advice  from  advisory 
counsel.  I understand that the role of advisory counsel is limited.  I understand that:  
 
 
proceedings in my case.  

a.  Advisory counsel will be physically present in the courtroom during all 

 

b.  Advisory counsel will respond to request for advice from me.  Advisory 

 

 
counsel will not initiate such discussions.

clerks, and legal service advisors will not be available to me.  

c.  The support staff of the advisory counsel - investigators, secretaries, law 

 

d. 

If  need  investigative  services,  expert  services,  waivers  of  fees,  research, 
 
secretarial services, or any other assistance, I must petition the Court for whatever relief 
or assistance I deem appropriate.  Such request is pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 
611.21.

e. 

 

 

 

f.  Advisory counsel will not be prepared to try my case on the trial date unless 

 
ordered to be prepared to do so by the Court.  
 
 
g.  Advisory counsel will be present for all Court appearances to consult with 
me if I request.  Advisory counsel will be seated either at the back of the courtroom or at 
counsel table, based on my wishes and the Court’s wishes.  In an effort to vindicate my 
constitutional  right  to  self-representation,  advisory  counsel  will  not  initiate  motions, 
objections,  arguments  to  the  Court,  or  any  other  aspect  of  representation  unless  I  have 
given prior approval to the specific aspect of representation.  
 
 
If I wish to give up my right to represent myself, I know that the Court will 
not  automatically  grant  my  request.    The  Court  will  consider  the  following  in  either 
granting or denying that request:  the stage of the proceedings, whether advisory counsel 
is prepared to take over, the length of the continuance necessary for the advisory counsel 
to assume representation, the prejudice to either party, whether the jury has been sworn, 
and any other relevant considerations.  

h. 

 

 

i.  

 
If the Court grants my request to give up the right to represent myself and 
substitute advisory counsel, the trial date may be continued if requested by the advisory 
counsel.   The trial date will then be reset at  a date  mutually agreeable between counsel 
for the prosecution and counsel for the defendant.  
 
In the unlikely event that the Court orders advisory counsel to represent me 
 
after  the  trial  has  started  and  jeopardy  has  attached,  the  Court  may  grant  a  mistrial  if 
requested  by  my  new  attorney  and  reset  the  trial  date  at  a  date  mutually  agreeable 
between counsel.  

j.  

 

k.  

I understand that if I am not a citizen of the United States, a plea of guilty 
or a finding of guilty for this crime may result in deportation, exclusion from admission 
to the United States or denial of naturalization as a United States citizen.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
