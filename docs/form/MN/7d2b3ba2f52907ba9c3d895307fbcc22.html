ccording to Minn. Stat. § 514.977 (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/514.977), if the 
occupant of a storage space does not pay rent, or otherwise breaches the rental agreement, the 
owner of the storage space may sue the occupant for the following: 

•  To terminate the rental agreement; 
•  To recover possession of the storage space; 
•  To remove the occupant; and 
•  To dispose of the stored personal property. 

This action is limited to only requesting the relief set forth above.  This is a separate action from an 
eviction action.

•  Doing something illegal; or  
•  Behaving in such a way that seriously endangers the safety of others, others’ property, or the 

storage facility’s property. 

The owner has to follow the procedure described above, but also has to fill out and file a Motion for 
Expedited Hearing (CIV1004) and an Affidavit in Support of Motion for Expedited Hearing (CIV1005).

occupant within 24 hours of court administration issuing the Summons.

behavior that seriously endangers the safety of others, others’ property, or the storage 
facility’s property.

what the statute includes.  Do not write in the margins or on the back of the page. 

 

 

In this section, you are telling the Defendant and the court what you are asking for.  Check the boxes 
that apply to your situation. 

 

Signature Block 

Sign and date the Complaint form, and print your contact information in the blanks under the 
signature line.  When you sign the Complaint, you are signing under penalty of perjury.  This means 
you are saying that everything in the form is true and correct; if you know something in the form is 
not true when you sign it, you could be found guilty of the crime of perjury (see Minn. Stat.  
§ 609.48, https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.48.

There are 2 reasons why a judicial officer will have an expedited hearing in your case.  In the first 
part of the Affidavit, you are checking the box(es) stating your reason(s) for asking for an expedited 
hearing. 

1.  Check the first box if the occupant is causing a nuisance. 
2.  Check the second box if the occupant is doing something illegal, or is behaving in a way that 
seriously endangers the safety of others, others’ property, or the storage facility’s property. 

NOTE: If you cannot check at least 1 of the 2 boxes, you may want to get legal advice to see if you 
have adequate reasons for asking for an expedited hearing.

3.  Next, give the details that support your request for an expedited hearing.  For example, if 
you checked the first box above, then at #3, you will describe the occupant’s behavior and 
how the occupant is causing a nuisance. 

 

Signature Block 

Sign and date the Affidavit form, and print your contact information in the blanks under the 
signature line.  When you sign the Affidavit, you are signing under penalty of perjury.  This means 
you are saying that everything in the form is true and correct; if you know something in the form is 
not true when you sign it, you could be found guilty of the crime of perjury (see Minn. Stat.  
§ 609.48, https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.48.  

Copies of the Motion and Affidavit 

Make one copy of the Motion and one copy of the Affidavit for each party, including yourself. 

 

 

Step 3 
File the Forms with Court Administration 
Get the Summons from Court Administration 

n this step, you will be filing the forms (the Complaint, and possibly the Motion and Affidavit) you 
have created with Court Administration.  There will be a filing fee due when you file.  You can 
contact Court Administration (https://mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx) to ask what the filing fee is, 
or you can look online at https://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Court-Fees/District-Court-Fees.aspx.  

Fee Waiver / In Forma Pauperis (IFP) 

If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can ask the court to waive it.  For more information 
about this process, including links to the forms you need, see https://mncourts.gov/Help-
Topics/Fee-Waiver-IFP.aspx.

Ways to File 

How to File 

At the Courthouse 

•  You will need to file the original forms, listed above, with 

Electronic filing through 
the eFS System 

• 

Court Administration in the county where you are filing your 
case. 

•  This can be done either in person at the courthouse or by 

mail.  Addresses for courthouses are online at 
https://mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx.  

If you have an account, or want to create one, with the eFS 
System, you can file electronically (eFile).  See 
https://www.mncourts.gov/eFile.  NOTE: Once you decide to 
eFile, you must continue to eFile for the entire case. 

•  Along with the civil filing fee and costs, there is also a fee of 
$5 for using the eFS System everytime you file.  If a judicial 
officer has granted you a fee waiver (IFP), the $5 fee can be 
waived. 

After you file your forms, Court Administration will issue a Summons that will include the hearing date.  
Both the hearing date, and the date the Summons is issued are important dates you will need to know 
so that you can figure out service deadlines.  See Step 4. 

 

Step 4 
Serve the Other Party 
Get the Affidavit of Service (SOP102) from the Server 

 

 

Service 

Since the Complaint starts a new case, you cannot be the one to serve the other party.  You will 
need to arrange for the other party to receive the Summons, Complaint (and, if applicable, the 
Motion and Affidavit).  This is called “service of process.”   

There are three different ways the other party can be served: 

•  Personal service; 
•  Service on someone who lives with the other party and is of suitable age; and 
•  Waiver of service (if the other party waives service). 

Each type of service is explained below.  For more general information about service of process, go 
to the “Service of Process” Help Topic at https://www.mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Service-of-
Process.aspx.

12/21                   www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 7 of 9 

Personal Service: Someone who is over the age of 18 and not a party to the case must serve the 
other party; you cannot serve the papers yourself.  The papers must be served personally (handed 
to the other party).  Service cannot be made on a legal holiday as defined by Minn. Stat. § 645.44, 
subd. 5 (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44#stat.645.44.5).  If you do not have 
someone that can serve the papers for you, you can contact the Sheriff’s Office in the county where 
the Defendant lives, or hire a private process server.  There is a fee for the Sheriff’s Office to serve 
the papers.  If you cannot afford to pay the service fees from the Sheriff’s Office, you can ask the 
court for a fee waiver. 

Service to Someone Who Lives with the Defendant: The Defendant can be handed a copy of the 
papers personally or a copy of the papers can be handed to a person “of suitable age and 
discretion” at Defendant’s home if that person lives with the Defendant.  Mailing the Summons and 
Complaint (and, if applicable, the Motion and Supporting Affidavit) is not personal service. 

Waiver of Service:  

Generally, the Defendant has a duty to avoid causing you to pay unnecessary costs of serving the 
Summons and Petition on them. Rule 4.05 of the Rules of Civil Procedure says that you may ask that 
the Defendant waive service of the Summons and Petition. To ask the other party to waive personal 
service of a summons, you must send the other party the following items by first-class mail:  

•  A copy of the Summons and Complaint (and, if applicable, the Motion and Affidavit); 
•  CIV022A (Notice of Lawsuit and Request for Waiver of Service of Summons);  
•  Two copies CIV022B (Waiver of Service of Summons); and  
•  A prepaid way (such as a self-addressed, stamped envelope) for the other party to return a 

signed copy of the Waiver of Service of Summons (CIV022B) to you.  

Once the Defendant receives these forms, the Defendant may mail the Waiver of Service of 
Summons back to you in the prepaid envelope that you provided.  

Warning: If the Defendant does not sign and return the Waiver of Service to you, the papers are not 
considered served. If that happens, you must serve the Defendant by Personal Service. 

Pay close attention to the service deadlines listed below. 

Service Deadlines 

If you are only serving the Summons and Complaint – Breach of Rental Agreement for Storage Space, 
then service must be made at least 7 days before the date of the hearing. 

If you are also serving the Motion for Expedited Hearing and Affidavit in Support of Motion for 
Expedited Hearing, then the occupant (Defendant) must be served within 24 hours from when the 
court issues the Summons (unless the court orders a different deadline for service).

Page 8 of 9 

You can fill out the caption like you did in the other forms.  You can also fill out the forms you are 
having served on the other party (at a minimum, you will list the Summons and Complaint – Breach 
of Rental Agreement for Storage Space; if you are requesting an expedited hearing, then you will 
also list Motion for Expedited Hearing, and Affidavit in Support of Motion for Expedited Hearing). 

The server will often fill out the rest of the form, which includes the following information: 

•  Server’s name; 
•  Server’s date of birth; 
•  Date of service on the other party; 
•  Name of the other party; 
•  Location (street address, city, state) where the service happened. 

The server must sign the Affidavit of Service under penalty of perjury. 

Step 5 
File the Proof of Service (Affidavit of Service, SOP102) with Court 
Administration 

You will need to file the completed Affidavit of Service with court administration.  See the “Ways to 
Serve” section in Step 3 above.  Remember, if you filed the forms in Step 3 using eFS, then you must 
use eFS to file the Affidavit of Service.
