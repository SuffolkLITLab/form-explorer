      <pre>Instructions for Requesting Search of Minnesota Fathers’ Adoption Registry  
and Sending Notice and Forms to Putative Father if Match Identified 

egistering on Minnesota Fathers’ Adoption Registry  

ursuant to Minn. Stat. § 259.52, a man who believes he is the father of a child (born or unborn) 
may  register  with  the  Minnesota  Fathers’  Adoption  Registry  (MFAR)  maintained  by  the 
Minnesota Department of Health.  A putative father may register any time after the conception of 
a child he believes he has fathered.  Once registered, a putative father’s information is placed in 
the MFAR data base.  The woman named by the putative father in his MFAR registration will be 
notified by mail within two weeks of his registering.  The notification to the mother will consist 
of a letter explaining the MFAR and a copy of the putative father's completed registration form. 

here  are  two  time  sensitive  requirements  the  putative  father  must  meet  to  ensure  he  receives 

notice of any pending adoption of the subject child:   

1.  The putative father must file a registration form with the MFAR within 30 days after the 

birth of the child; and 

2.  After  an  adoption  petition  is  filed,  the  registered  putative  father  must  receive  an 
additional 30 days during which he must file his intention to either relinquish his parental 
rights or claim his parental rights and take affirmative steps toward establishing paternity. 

earching Fathers’ Adoption Registry 

efore the adoption of any U.S. born child is finalized in the State of Minnesota, a search of the 
MFAR is required.  The only exceptions to the requirement to search the MFAR are foreign born 
children and “safe place” babies. 

  search  of  the  MFAR  must  be  conducted  no  sooner  than  31  days  following  the  birth  of  the 
child.  Upon request of the birth mother, prospective adoptive parents, or agency supervising the 
adoption,  staff in  the Office of the State Registrar at  the Minnesota Department  of Health  will 
search the MFAR and provide to the requester certified proof of the search along with the results 
of  the  search.    Licensed  child  placing  agencies,  agencies  supervising  an  adoption  placement, 
birth  mothers,  prospective  adoptive  parents,  and  social  services  agencies  responsible  for  the 
report related to stepparent adoptions under Minn. Stat. § 259.53, subd. 1 may request a search of 
the  MFAR  at  any  time.    The  responsible  social  services  agency  as  a  petitioner  in  a  juvenile 
protection matter under Minn. Stat. § 260C.150 may request a search of the MFAR at any time. 

FAR  staff  will  send  certified  proof  of  the  search  and  the  results  of  the  search  to  the  birth 
mother  or  agent/agency  requesting  the  search.    If  a  match  is  found,  the  person  requesting  the 
search must file the results with the court and must send additional forms to the putative father.  
The court cannot  finalize the adoption or issue  an adoption decree unless the results have first 
been filed and reviewed.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
