the APPLICANT must be at least 18 years of age (a legal parent, legal guardian, or next of kin 
files on behalf of a minor); and

or IFP). 

A legal parent, for the purposes of applying for a minor name change, is one who is named on the 
child’s birth certificate or is adjudicated as a parent by court order. 

Who is a legal parent?

3.  Complete the application and criminal history release.  The forms should be typed or legibly written 
using black ink.  Be sure the “changed to” name(s) appear exactly the way you want them changed.  
For the proposed order, complete the case caption and all other information up to the “IT IS 
ORDERED” section.  Do not fill in anything below “IT IS ORDERED.” 

4.  Do not proceed if the application is not made in good faith or there is any intent to defraud or 

mislead anyone by the change of name.   

5.  Indicate the names of each minor child and their dates of birth.   

6.  List all legal descriptions of property in which each minor child has a claim, interest or lien on any 
property.  You must show who has interest and the nature of the interest in the property.  You may 
need to attach a separate piece of paper to the application with this information on it.  Example of 
Legal Description: Lot 1, Block 4, Hamden Edition, Hennepin County, Minnesota. You can get a 
copy of the legal description from the Deed, Contract for Deed or Certificate of Title at the office of 
the County Recorder or Registrar of Titles in the county where the property is located.  Do not use 
property descriptions found on tax statements. 

7.  The application must be signed under penalty of perjury.  By signing the application under penalty 

of perjury, you are stating that the information in the document is true to the best of your knowledge.  
Perjury is the crime of lying or misrepresenting the truth.  You must sign in two places on the 
application form.   Any minor who is 14 years or older needs to sign the application.  Minors under 
14 years of age do not need to sign the application.  If your spouse is a co-applicant, the application 
should be signed by both you and your spouse. 

8.  After you have completed the forms, bring or mail the completed application to the district court in 

your county, along with the applicable filing fee.   

  Contact information is available starting at http://mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx. 

  Filing fee information is available starting at (search by your county and “Civil Action or 

Proceeding,” then look for “Name Change” in the results).   

If you have any difficulty filling out the forms, you should consult an attorney. 

Hearing:  

1.  The Court Administrator’s office will provide you with a hearing date and time. 

2.  All minor(s) seeking to have their name changed must be present at the court hearing.  

3.  At the hearing you must bring two adult witnesses (other than the applicant) who have known the 

minor for one year or longer.  If both parents come to the hearing, you only need to bring one other 
witness.  Your witnesses may be relatives.  The same witnesses may testify for more than one child 
if there are multiple children on the application. 

4.  At the hearing, the judge may ask you to prove that you have the legal right to request a name 

change.  If you are the legal parent, you should bring a copy of the birth certificate.  If you are the 
guardian, you should bring a copy of the court order appointing you guardian. 

5.  If your application is approved at the time of the hearing, the judge will sign the Order Granting

6.  After the Order is signed, you can obtain certified copies of the Order from the Court 

Administrator’s office for a fee of $14 each.  Certified copies of this order will be needed to 
change your personal records.   (See “Notice to Persons Who Have Had Their Name 
Changed.”)   

PARENTAL NOTICE OF NAME CHANGE OF A MINOR: Minnesota Statute §259.10 states 
that no minor child's name may be changed without both legal parents having notice of the 
pending application of change of name.  The applicant must show proof that the non-applicant 
parent(s) has received notification of the Application for Name Change of a Minor. 

Note: If a biological parent is not listed on the birth certificate and there is no order the biological 
parent, no notice of the pending name change application is required to be given to the biological parent. 
You must bring a certified copy of the birth certificate to the court hearing to show the judge that the 
biological parent’s name does not appear on the birth certificate. 

 

 

 

If your county court staff informs you certified mail is required, once you have a hearing date, 
then send a certified letter (return receipt requested) to the non-applicant parent indicating the 
date, time, place, and purpose of the hearing.  You should bring the return receipt card to the 
court hearing with a copy of the letter as proof to the judge that the non-applicant parent received 
notice of the name change proceedings. 

If your county court staff informs you personal service is required, then read the Instructions for 
Personal Service – Minor Name Change and complete the Affidavit of Personal Service.  Both of 
these documents are available at www.mncourts.gov/forms.  You should bring the Affidavit of 
Personal Service with you to the court hearing as proof to the judge that the non-applicant parent 
was personally serviced with notice of the name change proceedings. 

If you do not know the address of the non-applicant parent(s), you should bring to court a signed 
Affidavit in Support of Order for Publication (this affidavit and instructions are available with 
the Minor Name Change forms at www.mncourts.gov/forms.  If so ordered by a judge, you may 
be required to give service by alternative means or to publish a Notice of Hearing by Publication 
(Minor Name Change) in a designated newspaper at your own expense.  It is the applicant’s 
responsibility to arrange publication and file the Affidavit of Publication with the Court 
Administrator’s office prior to the scheduled hearing date.  See Instructions for Publishing 
Notice for Name Change of a Minor for more detailed information on this process. 

RIMINAL RECORD CHECK: 

Minn. Stat. § 259.11 requires the Court to determine whether any person seeking to have their name 
changed has a criminal history in Minnesota or any other state.  The court may conduct a search of 
national records through the Federal Bureau of Investigation by submitting a set of fingerprints and the 
required fee to the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.  To comply, you must complete a Criminal 
History Check Release form for each minor covered by the application who is age 10 or older.  A 
criminal history check will be made on all persons listed on the application age 10 or older.   If the 
minor has a criminal history, both the person whose name is changed and the Court shall report 
the change within 10 days of receiving a copy of the order by mailing a copy of the order granting 
the name change to:

ote:  Any information placed in name change file will be accessible to the public, unless the court 

determines that the name change is made in connection with participation in a victim or witness 
protection program. 

You will need to prove to the Court by clear and convincing evidence that your application for name 
change is not based on the intent to defraud, is made in good faith, will not cause injury to a person and 
will not compromise public safety.  Without this evidence, your name change will not be granted. 

BIRTH CERTIFICATES: 

If the information on a birth certificate is wrong because a mistake was made when the birth certificate 
was created, DO NOT file an Application for Name Change to have the birth record changed.  Mistakes 
can be corrected through your local County Vital Statistics office or the Minnesota Department of 
Health.  Procedures to amend the birth record can be found on the Minnesota Department of Health web 
site at www.health.state.mn.us/divs/chs/osr/amend.html or by calling the Minnesota Department of 
Health at 651-201-5000.  Please refer to Minnesota State Agency Rules 4601.1000 and 4601.1100 for 
further information.  

You should consult an attorney for further information on when changing a birth certificate is 
appropriate and what information you should include in your Application for Name Change.  You may 
specifically ask the judge on your Application for Minor Name Change to order the birth certificate 
changed.  You may use the “Other” category on the Application for Minor Name Change to request any 
other changes to the birth certificate and to explain why amending the birth certificate to reflect the legal 
name change or other information is appropriate.  If a judge determines a change on the birth certificate 
is warranted the judge will include that provision in the final name change order that would direct the 
Department of Health to amend a birth certificate.  The Court must find that a change of a minor child’s 
name is in the best interests of the child before granting a request to amend a birth certificate for a minor 
child. 

NAME CHANGE APPLICATION FOR A PERSON CONVICTED OF A FELONY CHARGE: 

If the minor has a felony conviction under Minnesota law or the law of another state or federal 
jurisdiction, the applicant shall serve notice regarding the name change application on the prosecuting 
authority that obtained the conviction.  If the conviction is from another state or federal jurisdiction, 
notice must also be served on the Minnesota Attorney General at 1400 Bremer Tower, 445 Minnesota 
Street, St. Paul, MN 55101.  Proof of service shall be filed with the court as part of the name change 
request.  The prosecuting authority has 30 days to object to the name change application.  NOTE: If the 
prosecuting authority objects, the court must deny your application.  You would then have the right to 
file a motion contesting the prosecuting authority’s objection under Minn. Stat. § 259.13, subd. 3.  To 
determine how to file such a motion, contact an attorney.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
