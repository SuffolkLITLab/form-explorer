Minn. R. Gen. Prac. 520(b) 

Important Notices and Resources 

The Court has forms and instructions, for some types of cases, as a general guide to the court process. 
These instructions  explain the steps in more detail and answer common questions but are not a full 
guide to the law. Court employees may be able to give general information on court rules and 
procedures, but they cannot give legal advice.  

Have questions about court forms or instructions? 

• Visit www.MNCourts.gov/SelfHelp 
• Call the Statewide Self-Help Center at 651-435-6535 

Not sure what to do about a legal issue or need advice? 

• Talk with a lawyer 
• Visit www.MNCourts.gov/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx  

Helpful materials may be found at your public county law library. For a directory, see  
http://mn.gov/law-library/research-links/county-law-libraries.jsp . For more information, contact court 
administration or call the Minnesota State Law Library at 651-297-7651. 

Forms You May Need 

•  Notice and Motion to Vacate Conciliation Court Judgment after Deadline (CCT506) 
•  Affidavit in Support of Motion to Vacate Conciliation Court Judgment after Deadline (CCT507) 
•  Additional Litigants Form (CCT702) – if appropriate 
•  Affidavit of Personal Service (SOP102) 
•  Affidavit of Service by Mail (SOP104) 
•  Affidavit of Inability to Pay Conciliation Court Fees (CCT104)  – if appropriate (not for 

businesses) 

Forms are available on the court’s website (mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=10).    

What You Need to Do 

1.  Complete the court forms, following all steps in these instructions. 

Instructions – Motion to Vacate Conciliation Court Judgment after Deadline 
CCT505      State       ENG 

5/22                www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 1 of 8 

2.  File your forms (electronically or at the courthouse) and pay the Conciliation  Court filing  fee 

(or fill out the form to waive the fee if you cannot afford to pay it). 

3.  A Judicial  Officer will review your forms and decide whether to grant your motion. If your 
motion is granted, a hearing will  be scheduled, and Court Administration  will contact you 
with the hearing information.   

4.  If a hearing is scheduled, appear at the hearing.  Each “step” here is described in more detail 

below. 

General Information 

These forms are meant to be used when a default Conciliation Court judgment has been ordered 
against you, and over 21 days have passed since Court Administration sent notice of the judgment.  It 
may be too late to vacate the conciliation court judgment; it will be up to the judicial officer to decide 
whether to vacate the judgment and grant you a new trial. 

You may be able to use this packet IF: 

1.  A conciliation case is already started, and you have a case number; and 
2.  You did not attend the conciliation court hearing; and 
3.  A default judgment was ordered against you in conciliation court; and 
4.  21 days (24 days if mailed) passed since Court Administration sent the Notice of Conciliation 

Court Order, and you did not file a timely notice to vacate; and 

5.  You want to ask the court to vacate (cancel) the conciliation court judgment and grant you a 

new trial. 

DO NOT use these forms if it is within 21  days (24 days if mailed) of Court Administration sending the 
Notice of Conciliation Court Order.  In that case, you must fill out and file the Request to Vacate Order 
for Judgment and Grant New Trial (CCT504).  CCT504 is available online at 
https://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=10&f=182. 

Step 1 

Fill Out the Notice and Motion to Vacate Conciliation Court Judgment after Deadline 
(CCT506) 

The Caption 

The top part of the first page is where you will find the case caption.  It looks like this: 

Instructions – Motion to Vacate Conciliation Court Judgment after Deadline 
CCT505      State       ENG 

5/22                www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 2 of 8 

You will find the information you need to fill out the caption on a court document from your existing 
conciliation  court case.  If you do not have any documents from your court file, and if you do not 
know the information, you will need to look up the court file information. 

 

•  You can review some case records online at www.mncourts.gov/publicaccess. 

• 

If you cannot view your case online, you may visit your local  courthouse and use a public 
records computer to view your court file. 

1.  At the top of the page, include the following information: 

•  The county where the case is located; 
•  The Judicial District number (each county is located in 1 of 10  judicial districts, 

mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx); 

•  Your court file number (this usually starts with a 2-digit  number followed by letters 

and numbers; for example, 89-CO-22-123); 

•  The case type (Conciliation) is already filled out for you. 

2.  Include the name of the plaintiff and the name of the defendant as it is found on the court 
document mentioned earlier.  If your name is incorrect in any way, you can add “aka” (also 
known as”, and then correct your name.  Check the box below the case caption if there is 
more than 1 plaintiff or more than 1 defendant.  List the other parties on the Additional 
Litigants Form (CCT702). 

The Notice 
You do not need to fill  out anything in this section. 

The Motion 

3.  Fill  in your name on the first line. 

4.  Fill  in the name of the other party on the second line. 

The Signature Block 

On page 2 of the Notice and Motion, please read the Acknowledgement carefully.  There can be 
serious consequences if you do not have a good reason for using the form.

5.  After you have filled out the Notice and Motion, you can date and sign the form.  Then print 

your personal contact  information below your signature. 

Fill Out the Affidavit in Support of Motion to Vacate Conciliation Court Judgment 
after Deadline (CCT507) 

Step 2 

The Caption 
Fill  out the caption just as you did on the Motion. 

The Affidavit 

1.  Fill  in your name. 

2.  Fill  in the date the judgment was entered against you. 

3.  Read the statement to see if it is true: “I did not receive the Summons before the trial within 
enough time to allow a defense and did not receive notice of the order for default judgment 
within enough time to ask for a new hearing within 21 days (24 days if mailed) after Court 
Administration sent the Notice of Conciliation Court Order.”  If this statement is not true, you 
should get legal advice before using these forms. 

a.  Check the box and fill in the date (or approximate date) you received the Summons.  
The Summons is the document that notified you of the conciliation  court hearing 
date.  OR check the second box if you did not receive the Summons. 

b.  Fill  in the date you found out about the order for default judgment.  You must file this 

paperwork within a reasonable time after learning of the judgment. 

4.  Explain in detail why the court should vacate (cancel) the order for default judgment.  If the 

judicial  officer does not have enough details, they cannot grant your request. 

5.  You do not need to fill  out anything in #5 as it has been filled out for you.  If the court grants 
your Motion, you may be required to pay additional  costs of up to $50  before a court date 
will be scheduled (this is explained in more detail in Step 7). 

The Signature Block and Penalty of Perjury 
When you sign the Affidavit, you are signing under penalty of perjury.  Perjury is the crime of 
intentionally lying or misrepresenting the truth.  By signing under penalty of perjury, you are stating 
that the information in your Affidavit is true to the best of your knowledge. 

6.  Date and sign the Affidavit.  Then include the names of the county and state you’re in when 

you signed it.  Print your personal contact information below your signature.

Step 3 
Make Copies of Forms 

You will  need to make one copy of the Notice and Motion to Vacate Conciliation Court Judgment 
After Deadline (CCT506)  and the Affidavit in Support of Motion to Vacate Conciliation Court 
Judgment After Deadline (CCT507)  for each party, including  yourself.  You will  need to arrange for 
the other party to be served with a copy of your Notice and Motion to Vacate Conciliation Court 
Judgment After Deadline (CCT506)  and the Affidavit in Support of Motion to Vacate Conciliation 
Court Judgment After Deadline (CCT507). See Step 4.  Be sure to bring your copy with you to the 
court hearing (See Step 8). 

Step 4 
Serve the Other Party 

Overview 

The other party must receive a copy of your Notice and Motion to Vacate Conciliation Court 
Judgment after Deadline (CCT506)  and the Affidavit in Support of Motion to Vacate Conciliation 
Court Judgment after Deadline (CCT507), and one copy of any and all attachments.  This is called 
“service of process.”  The papers can be served personally (handed to the other party) or by mail. 

NOTE: If there is more than 1 plaintiff and/or more than 1 defendant, each of the other parties need 
to be served. 

Papers CANNOT be served on legal holidays as defined in Minn. Stat. § 645.44 
(revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44.5). 

If the other party is represented by an attorney, serve the other party’s attorney instead of the 
other party directly. 

The forms you have prepared can be served by any of the following: 

Who Can Serve 

•  You; 
•  Another adult; or 
•  The sheriff. 

Service by Mail 
The server places 1 copy of the completed Notice and Motion to Vacate Conciliation Court Judgment 
after Deadline, and 1 copy of the Affidavit in Support of Motion to Vacate Conciliation Court 
Judgment after Deadline, and 1 copy of any and all attachments into an envelope.  The server must 

mail the envelope containing the forms to the other party by first class U.S. mail.

Step 5 
Affidavit of Service (Proving Other Party Was Served) 

After the paperwork is served on the other party (not before) either personally or by mail, the 
server must fill out the Affidavit of Service form for each party who is served.  This Affidavit of 
Service form serves as your proof for the court that the papers were served on the other party. 

IF THE PAPERS WERE SERVED BY MAIL, follow these instructions: 

Use the Affidavit of Service by Mail (SOP104) (mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=33&f=28)).

5.  Fill  in the other party’s name. 
6.  Fill  in the other party’s address.  NOTE: the address is broken up.  The first line is for the

8.  Fill  in the server’s name, address, and telephone number.  The server should sign and date 

the form, and list what county and state they are in when they sign the Affidavit of Service by 
Mail. 

After the server signs the Affidavit of Service by Mail, make 1 copy for your records.  File the original 
Affidavit of Service  by Mail with Court Administration. 

IF PAPERS WERE PERSONALLY SERVED, follow these instructions: 

Use the Affidavit of Personal Service (SOP102) (mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=33&f=27)

After the server signs the Affidavit of Personal Service, make 1 copy for your records.  File the 
original with Court Administration. 

Step 6 
File with Court Administration and Pay Filing Fee 

You will  need to file the following forms with Court Administration: 

•  Notice and Motion to Vacate Conciliation Court Judgment After Deadline (CCT506); 
•  Affidavit in Support of Motion to Vacate Conciliation Court Judgment After Deadline 

(CCT507), including  any attachments;  

•  Affidavit of Service by Mail (SOP104) or Affidavit of Personal Service (SOP102); 
•  Additional Litigants Form (CCT702) – if appropriate 
•  Affidavit of Inability to Pay Conciliation Court Fees (CCT104)  – if appropriate (not for 

businesses). 

You can file the papers by mail,  electronically, or in person at the courthouse where the Conciliation 
Court case was filed. 

When you file the papers with court administration,  there will  be a filing fee (in some counties, 
there is an additional amount for the law library  fee).  You can find the filing fees for your county 
online starting  at https://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Court-Fees.aspx. 

If you are a person (not a business) and cannot afford to pay the filing fee, then you can fill out the 
Affidavit of Inability to Pay Conciliation Court Filing Fee (CCT104)  and file it along with the forms 
mentioned above.  CCT104  is available  online at https://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=10&f=173.

Page 7 of 8 

Step 7 
Judicial Officer Review & Hearing Date 

After you file the forms with Court Administration, the judicial  officer will review them and decide if 
your Motion should be granted.   

If the judicial officer denies your Motion, then you will not get a hearing date and the Conciliation 
Court default judgment will  stand.  If you would like to appeal the judicial  officer’s decision, you can 
complete the Appeals – Limited Removal form packet (mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=10&p=40). 

If the judicial officer grants  your Motion, you may be required to pay additional costs of no more 
than $50  before a hearing is scheduled.  Court Administration  will notify you if your Motion is 
granted and if payment is required.  Once you have paid any required costs, a hearing will be 
scheduled, and Court Administration will  notify the parties of the hearing date. 

Step 7 
Appear at Your Hearing 

You must appear in court on the date set for the hearing.  It is important to be on time. 

Have copies of all  the papers you filed with you. 

Conciliation  Court hearings are informal, but you must be prepared to present your case.  If you are 
not sure how to prepare for the hearing, you should get legal advice (mncourts.gov/Help-
Topics/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx) before your court date.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
