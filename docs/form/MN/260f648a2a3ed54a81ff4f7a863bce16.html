Instructions for Filling Out the Parenting / Financial 
Disclosure Statement 

 

OTE:    Fill  in  the  Parenting  /  Financial  Disclosure  Statement  form  ONLY  if  you 
and the other party do not reach an agreement on ALL of the issues and you must 
go to trial so the Judge can make a decision on how to settle the issues. 

he  Parenting  /  Financial  Disclosure  Statement  gives  the  court  updated  information 
regarding income, employment, property, children and other issues since you filed  your 
court  documents.    The  other  party  will  also  submit  a  Parenting  /  Financial  Disclosure 
Statement.    The  court  will  schedule  a  hearing  called  a  “Pretrial  Conference.”    Unless 
excused by the court, you must attend the hearing prepared to negotiate a final settlement 
on all issues.  If you do not go to the Pretrial Conference, the court can issue a final order 
or decree without considering anything that you have asked for, and can order you to pay 
the  other  party’s  attorney’s  fees,  if  any.    If  you  and  the  other  party  cannot  reach  an 
agreement at the Pretrial Conference, the court will issue an order identifying the issues 
about which you disagree, scheduling the trial date, and setting the date by which you and 
the other party must exchange your list of exhibits and witnesses to be offered at trial. 

he questions asked in the Parenting / Financial Disclosure Statement form are similar 
to questions asked on other forms you have already filled out.  The purpose of this form, 
however, is to give the court updated information in preparation for trial. To answer the 
questions  asked  about  you,  you  should  look  at  your  court  documents.  To  answer  the 
questions  asked  about  the  other  party,  you  should  look  at  the  other  party’s  court 
documents that may have been filled out.  
 

Filing Non-Public Documents with the Court 

NOTE! 

Most documents filed with the court are considered public documents 
and are available to the public.  Certain information that is filed with 
the court may be considered confidential based on court rule and not 
available to the public.  To keep this information confidential and not 
available to the public, you must take certain steps that are described 
below.   

  N

  T

  T

 

The steps listed below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  
Filers who are using eFS to submit their court documents must 
identify and designate their filings as required in Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 
11.03 and 14.06.   

Confidential Information Form 11.1 

Instructions – Parenting/Financial Disclosure Statement 
ENG 
FAM107  State 

 Rev 1/21         www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 1 of 7 

All  social  security  numbers,  employer  identification  numbers,  and  financial  account 
numbers  (also  called  “restricted  identifiers”)  must  not  be  listed  on  papers  you  file  with 
the  court.  This  is  to  protect  your  privacy,  the  other  parties  and  your  children.      Only 
provide social security numbers, employer identification numbers, and financial account 
numbers  when  the  court  requires  this  information  to  be  provided  to  the  court.    For 
example, if you must provide the court with bank account numbers, or medical account 
numbers, do not include any account number in your document (your motion, supporting 
affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you must use Form 11.1 to list these confidential numbers.  

If account numbers are not required to be provided to the court, and the numbers appear 
on  documents  that  are  considered  available  to  the  public,  (such  as  medical  invoices  or 
credit  account  numbers  on  statements)  you  must  remove  the  number  on  the  document 
before filing the document with the court. 

Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are 
considered non-public documents based on court rules.  You must identify these 
documents as non-public at the time you file the documents with the court.  You must 
complete and file the “Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2” (also called 
Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public documents.  The most common non-
public documents are called “financial source documents.”  Examples of financial source 
documents include: 

•  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and 

business expenses 

•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers   

You  may  also  need  to  submit  other  documents  that  court  rules  identify  as  non-public 
documents, such as a medical record.  For example, a report from a doctor that provides a 
medical  diagnosis  or  treatment  plan  for  you  or  your  child  would  qualify  as  a  medical 
record.   

You must use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing other non-public documents, such as 
medical records, with the court.  One Form 11.2 cover sheet can be used for submitting 
all non-public documents.   

The failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being 
rejected  by  court  administration,  being  available  to  the  public,  stricken 
from the court record, and sanctions from the court.
