STEP 2 
FILL OUT THE “AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO MODIFY  
MEDICAL SUPPORT ONLY” FORMS 

ill in the top of the form the same way you did on your “Notice of Motion and Motion” form.  

ill in the information on the “Affidavit in Support of Motion.”   

igning the Affidavit under penalty of perjury means you are stating that the information in the 
Affidavit  is  true  to  the  best  of  your  knowledge.    Perjury  is  the  crime  of  intentionally  lying  or 
misrepresenting the truth, punishable by jail or other sanctions. 

 

Gather documents that support your reasons why the medical support order should be changed.  
Examples of these documents include the following: 
•  Proof of the end of your insurance (if you were providing insurance before) ;  
•  Proof of the insurance you are currently carrying (if any) that covers the joint children; . 
•  Proof of the cost of the coverage you are providing for the joint children; 
•  Proof of a substantial change in the cost of the coverage ; OR  
•  Proof of change in eligibility for medical assistance.  
 

STEP 3 
FILL OUT THE “COVER SHEET FOR NON-PUBLIC DOCUMENTS” FORM 11.2.  
FILL OUT “CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION ” FORM 11.1 WHEN NECESSARY 

OTE! 

Most  documents  filed  with  the  court  are  considered  public  documents  and 
available to the public.  Certain information that is filed with the court may 
be  considered  confidential  based  on  court  rule  and  not  available  to  the 
public.  To keep this information confidential and not available to the public, 
you must take certain steps described below. 

The steps listed below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  Filers 
who  are  using  eFS  to  submit  their  court  documents  must  identify  and 
designate their filings as required in Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 11.03 and 14.06.   

onfidential Information Form 11.1 

All social security numbers, employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers 
(also called “restricted identifiers”) must not be listed on papers you file with the court. This is to 
protect your privacy, the other parties and your children.   Only provide social security numbers, 
employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers when the court requires this 
information to be provided to the court.  For example, if you must provide the court with bank 
account numbers, or medical account numbers, do not include any account number in your 
document (your motion, supporting affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you must use Form 11.1 to list these

confidential numbers.  

If account numbers are not required to be provided to the court, and the numbers appear on 
documents that are considered available to the public, (such as medical invoices or credit account 
numbers on statements) you must remove the number on the document before filing the 
document with the court. 

Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-
public documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the 
time  you file the documents with the court.   You  must complete and  file  the  “Cover  Sheet for 
Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 (also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public 
documents.  The most common non-public documents are called “financial source documents.”  
Examples of financial source documents include: 
•  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and business expenses 
•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers   

ou may also need to submit other documents that court rules identify as non-public documents, 
such as a medical record.  For example, a report from a doctor that provides a medical diagnosis 
or treatment plan for you or your child would qualify as a medical record.   

You must use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing other non-public documents, such as 
medical records, with the court.  One Form 11.2 cover sheet can be used for submitting all non-
public documents.    

The failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being 

rejected by court administration, being available to the public, stricken from the 
court record, and sanctions from the court. 

See Rule 11 of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice for more information about how to file 
documents containing social security numbers, financial account numbers, “financial source 
documents” and other non-public documents.   

Form 11.1 and Form 11.2 can be found at www.mncourts.gov/forms under the court forms 
category of “Confidential Information” and is court form number CON111 and CON112. 

STEP 4 
ASK FOR A HEARING DATE, TIME, AND LOCATION 
FROM COURT ADMINISTRATION  

  Call the court administrator's office in the county where your case is located.

the matter.  The hearing date must be at least 24 days away from the date the motion papers 
are mailed to the other party office or at least 21 days away from the date the motion papers 
are  personally  served  (hand-delivered  to  the  other  party  and  the  county  attorney’s  office).  
Count the day before the hearing as Day 1, then continue counting backwards. 

  Fill in the date, time, and location of the hearing on the “Notice of Motion and Motion” form. 

STEP 5 
MAKE COPIES OF FORMS 

  Make two copies of the completed “Notice of Motion and Motion” form, two copies of your 
“Affidavit in Support of Motion” form, and two copies of all other documents that support 
your  motion  (for  example,    paycheck  stubs,  tax  returns,  proof  of  expenses).    Do  not  make 
copies of Forms 11.2 or 11.1, unless you want copies for your own records. 

 

•  Keep  one  copy  of  each  form  and  one  copy  of  all  supporting  documents  for  yourself 

(remember to bring your copies with you to court on the day of your hearing). 

STEP 6 
HAVE COPIES OF THE FORMS AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS 
SERVED ON THE OTHER PARTY  

verview 

The other party must receive complete copies of all documents you 
have prepared for the hearing. This is called "service of process." The 
papers can be served personally (handed to the other party), or by mail. 
If papers are served by mail, Court Rules require adding three days. 
Papers cannot be served on a legal holiday as defined in Minn. Stat. 
§ 645.44, subd. 5 (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44#stat.645.44.5).  

If the other party is represented 
by an attorney, serve the other 
party’s attorney, instead of the 
party directly. 

The forms you have prepared can be served by any of the following: 

ho Can Serve 

•  The sheriff; 
•  Another adult; or 
•  You. 

ersonal Service 

At least 21 days before the hearing date, one copy of your forms and supporting documents 
are hand-delivered to the other party personally, or are left at that party’s place of residence with 
some person who is of suitable age or discretion who also lives at the same residence.

“Affidavit of Service” form for each party served.

true  to  the  best  of  his  /  her  knowledge.    Perjury  is  the  crime  of  intentionally  lying  or

Court Fees 
Pay the motion filing fee at the time you file this motion.  If you did not pay an initial filing fee 
when this case first began, you will be asked by court administration to pay the initial filing fee 
and library fees as well as the motion fee before your motion can be heard by the court.  Court 
administration will be able to tell you if you have paid the initial filing fee. 

f you cannot afford to pay the fee, you may qualify to have the filing fee and motion fee waived 
by the court.  You need to fill out Fee Waiver (In Forma Pauperis) application (available from 
court  administration  or  online  at  http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=19&p=69)  and  file  it 
with  court  administration.    Your  application  will  be  reviewed  by  a  judge  who  will  decide 
whether you must pay the fee.  If the judge does not sign an order that waives the fee, you must 
be prepared to pay the fee. 
 

STEP 9 
APPEAR AT THE HEARING 

o to court on the date and time scheduled for the hearing.  Be sure to bring with you your copy 
of the “Motion to Modify Medical Support ONLY Support,” “Affidavit in Support of Motion to

parties so that copies can be given to all parties and the court.
