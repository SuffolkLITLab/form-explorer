process. These instructions explain the steps in more detail and answer common questions, but are 
not a full guide to the law. Court employees may be able to give general information on court rules 
and procedures, but they cannot give legal advice.

ho Should Use This Form? 

This Answer form is used to respond to the initial papers (Summons and Complaint) that started a 
civil lawsuit.  In a civil lawsuit, the party suing is called the Plaintiff and the party being sued is 
called the Defendant. 

Do not use this Answer form to respond to a lawsuit in Conciliation Court, or for family, 
juvenile, criminal, probate, or guardianship cases. The court has specific answer forms for some 
cases, and you should use a specific form if one is available. Forms are available at 
www.mncourts.gov/forms.  

ome of the specific answer forms are:  
• Answer to Eviction Complaint 
• Response to a Conciliation Court Claim  
• Answer to Divorce Petition  

he most common use for this Answer is to respond to a lawsuit in District Court  that says you 

owe money for services or purchases, or have breached a contract or done something else to 
injure the party suing you. The suit may ask for a money judgment or an order requiring some 
action (called “specific performance”).  All civil cases are complicated, and you are strongly 
encouraged to get help from an attorney.  This Answer form is provided with the idea that you 
will first get legal advice on what to say in the Answer.  It is not a “do-it-yourself” form.   

ote:  Corporations and LLCs must be represented by an attorney in District Court. An officer 

or shareholder cannot sign the Answer or appear in Court. 

If you have questions about whether a specific Answer form is available, call the Statewide Self-
Help Center at 651-435-6535. For more information about what to expect in a civil case, you are 
strongly encouraged to read the “Civil Actions” Help Topic at http://mncourts.gov/Help-
Topics/Civil-Actions.aspx, and a booklet available there entitled “What to Expect as a Self-
Represented Plaintiff or Defendant…Civil Trial (without a jury).” 

 
             
What Should I Do When I Receive a Summons and Complaint? 

hen you are served with a Summons and Complaint, a lawsuit against you has started even if 

nothing has been filed with the Court.  A Summons and Complaint may be served upon you 
personally, left at your residence with someone who resides with you who is of “suitable age and 
discretion,” or served by mail if you sign and return a document called Waiver of Service of 
Summons.   

If you want to challenge the lawsuit, you must prepare a written Answer and serve it on the party 
suing you. If an attorney signed the Complaint on behalf of the party suing you, your Answer 
should be served on the attorney.

Instructions – Answer / Answer and Counterclaim

Page 2 of 7 

The Summons you received states your deadline for responding.  In most civil cases you have 21 
days from the date you were served with the Summons and Complaint. If you do not serve an 
Answer on the Plaintiff within this time period, the Plaintiff can ask the court for a default 
judgment against you without further notice to you. 

orm CIV302 may be used to answer a Complaint. The information which follows is not legal 

advice.  Each case is unique and you are strongly advised to contact an attorney for legal 
advice as soon as possible.  Court employees are neutral and are not allowed to give legal 
advice to either party. The Answer form includes legal terms that are not explained or defined in 
detail in these instructions. If you need help understanding the terms, deciding what to include on 
the form, or deciding if you should challenge the lawsuit, please talk with an attorney or do your 
own research at a law library. (See page 1 for links to lawyer referral and libraries.) 

 

 

   

 

Step 1  
Fill out the Answer or Answer and Counterclaim form (CIV302)  
 

Read each paragraph of the Complaint.  For each paragraph of the Complaint, you must admit, 
deny, or state that you do not have enough information to answer the statements.  You will make 
these admissions and denials on the Answer.  
 

If all statements in a paragraph of the Complaint are false, you will “deny” that paragraph 
by writing the number of the paragraph in your Answer at #1. 

If all the statements in a paragraph are true, you will “admit” that paragraph by writing 
the paragraph number in your Answer at #2. 

If the paragraph is partly true and partly untrue, list the paragraph number in your Answer 
at #3. Then write down at #3 the statements in the Complaint paragraph that you agree 
are true.   

There may be statements you cannot admit or deny, because you do not have enough 
information to know if the statement is true or false.  List these statements or paragraph 
numbers in your Answer at #4. 

Remember: you must admit, deny, or address each paragraph in the Complaint. 

5. 

Affirmative Defenses    
 

Court Rules direct the Defendant (you) to raise all Affirmative Defenses in the Answer. You may 
have a defense, but not an Affirmative Defense. Your defense may simply be that the statements 
in the Complaint are false, and you deny them. An Affirmative Defense is a new set of facts that 
would defeat the other party’s claims even if the facts in the Complaint are true.

Example: The Complaint says you owe Computer House $4,000.  You went through 
bankruptcy and the $4,000 debt was discharged in the bankruptcy. Although you admit 
that you bought a computer and did not pay the $4,000, you can check   
bankruptcy” and explain that you are no longer responsible for the debt because it was 
discharged in Bankruptcy Case No. 12311 in March 2018. 

 “Discharge in 

n this example, you admit that the facts in the Complaint are true, but you have an Affirmative 
Defense (Discharge in Bankruptcy). 

ome Affirmative Defenses can be raised later in an Amended Answer, but you should plan to 
raise all defenses now. Read through the Affirmative Defenses listed in the Answer at #5. If any 
apply to your case, check the box and then provide the facts to support the defense in the space 
provided. If you need more space, attach a separate sheet of paper.  

f you think you have any sort of defense to the Complaint, you should get advice from a lawyer 
to determine whether it is an Affirmative Defense. 
  
6.      Counterclaims   
          
Paragraph 6 of the Answer asks about counterclaims. If you do not have a Counterclaim, check 
the box  

 Defendant has no Counterclaims.  

The Plaintiff is suing you based on a set of facts included in the Complaint. If you think that the 
Plaintiff should be paying you instead of suing you, you may have a Counterclaim.  In the 
Counterclaim, you must state facts that, if proven to be true, will support your request for a 
judgment against the Plaintiff. You must also state what “relief” or outcome you want the judge 
to order.  

  If you include a Counterclaim and the court determines that your claim was frivolous or 

not supported by law, you could be ordered to pay fines, costs or attorney fees for the other 
party. On the other hand, failing to include a Counterclaim could prevent you from suing later. If 
you have a counterclaim arising out of the same facts that are in the Complaint, you generally 
must state your Counterclaim in your Answer. You should talk to a lawyer for help deciding if 
you have a counterclaim.  

7.     Adding Parties to the Lawsuit 

ule 14 of the Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure addresses when it is proper to add new parties 

to the lawsuit and how to do it. New parties are called “Third Party Defendant” or “Third Party 
Plaintiff”.  Adding parties is complicated. Court staff cannot answer questions on this topic. Ask 
a lawyer for help if you think another person or entity should be a party to the lawsuit. As the

Plaintiff.) 
         
8.   

Relief  

he paragraph that starts with “WHEREFORE” is called the “prayer for relief.”  This is where 
you write what you want the judge to order.  Standard relief language is included on the form. 
Select the relief you are requesting by checking the box.  

Step 2  
Sign the Answer or Answer and Counterclaim form  
 

fter you complete the Answer form, you must read the acknowledgment and then sign and date 

it. If an attorney is representing you, the attorney will sign instead.  

ake one copy of the dated and signed Answer for yourself and one copy for each Plaintiff and 

any Defendant other than you.   
 

Step 3  
Make Copies of the Form   
 

Step 4  
Serve the Other Party   
 

 copy of your Answer must be served on each Plaintiff’s attorney. The attorney signed the 

Complaint served on you, and included his/her address.  If the Plaintiff does not have an 
attorney, the plaintiff will have signed the Complaint and your Answer must be served on the 
Plaintiff.  Do not serve the Original Answer (the paper you actually signed) because the original 
must be filed with the court.  

ervice of your forms must be completed in the time stated in the Summons and Complaint. The 

time period starts the day after you were served. For example, if you were served with a 
Summons on Monday that says you have 21 days to respond, start counting your 21 days on 
Tuesday (Day 1).  The 21st day is the last day your Answer can be served on time. Service is 
complete upon hand-delivering or mailing a copy of your Answer to the Plaintiff’s attorney (or 
the Plaintiff, if there is no attorney).  If the 21st day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, 
then the deadline becomes the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.

•  If an attorney signed the Complaint, the papers can be hand-delivered to the attorney or 
given to an employee of the attorney who is authorized to accept service of process for 
the attorney. 

•  If the Plaintiff (other party) is representing him or herself, the Answer can be hand-

delivered to the Plaintiff at any location, or left at the Plaintiff’s home with an adult or 
other person of “suitable age and discretion” who lives there with the Plaintiff. For 
additional information about serving papers, see Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure, 
Rule 4 Service (https://www.revisor.mn.gov/court_rules/cp/id/4/). 
 
Service by Mail  

•  A copy of your Answer is placed in an envelope addressed to the Plaintiff’s attorney (or 
the Plaintiff, if there is no attorney) with your return address on the envelope and is then 
sent by first class U.S. mail. The server must drop the letter in the mailbox or give it to 
the postal worker.  The address for the Plaintiff’s attorney or Plaintiff is on the 
Complaint, as part of Plaintiff’s signature block. 

After the Answer is hand-delivered or mailed, the person who did the service must fill out an 
Affidavit of Service form and sign it under penalty of perjury. Perjury is the crime of intentionally 
lying or misrepresenting the truth.

Keep the original Answer and the Affidavit of Service with your important documents.  If you 
receive a “Notice of Judicial Assignment” or other letter from the court, it means that the 
Plaintiff has filed the Summons and Complaint, and that you must file your original Answer and 
Affidavit of Service with the court.   

t the time you file your Answer and Affidavit of Service, you are required to pay a filing fee. 

This fee varies by county. If you cannot afford the filing fee, you may request a fee waiver. 
Forms and instructions for the Fee Waiver are available at 
http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=19&p=69, and from Court Administration. Court 
Administration cannot process your Answer unless you pay the fee or get a fee waiver order 
signed by a judge. 

Step 7 
Settlement or Trial  
 

fter you serve your Answer, the Plaintiff may contact you to discuss settling the case without a 
trial. Most cases settle. If you do not hear from the Plaintiff, you can call the Plaintiff’s attorney 
or the Plaintiff and suggest settling the case. If Plaintiff has an attorney, the attorney signed the 
Complaint and you will find contact information below the signature, usually on the last page.   

If you are representing yourself, keep in mind that you can get help from an attorney at any 
stage. You can hire an attorney to help with some or all parts of your case. For example, if you 
get a settlement offer, you may want to consult with an attorney on whether to accept the offer, 
or make a counteroffer.  

At each court hearing, the Judge will ask if you have tried to settle and will likely require 
mediation or arbitration. See the “Settle Out of Court” Help Topic at http://mncourts.gov/Help-
Topics/Settle-Out-of-Court.aspx.  

o not ignore anything you receive from the Plaintiff or the court.  You may need to respond in 

writing to additional documents. You may need to attend several court hearings before a trial.

Topic at http://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Civil-Actions.aspx.
