Confidential Information and Documents 

 

NOTE! 

Most documents filed with the court are considered public documents and are 
available to the public.  Certain information that is filed with the court may be 
considered confidential based on court rule and not available to the public.  To keep 
this information confidential and not available to the public, you must take certain 
steps that are described below.   

The steps listed below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  Filers who are 
using eFS to submit their court documents must identify and designate their filings 
as required in Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 11.03 and 14.06.   

onfidential Information Form 11.1

IMPORTANT NOTICES 

identification numbers, and financial account numbers when the court requires this information to be 
provided to the court.  For example, if you must provide the court with bank account numbers, or 
medical account numbers, do not include any account number in your document (your motion, 
supporting affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you must use Form 11.1 to list these confidential numbers.  

If account numbers are not required to be provided to the court, and the numbers appear on documents 
that are considered available to the public, (such as medical invoices or credit account numbers on 
statements) you must remove the number on the document before filing the document with the court. 

over Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-public 
documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the time you file 
the documents with the court.  You must complete and file the “Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents 
Form 11.2 (also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public documents.  The most common 
non-public documents are called “financial source documents.”  Examples of financial source 
documents include: 

•  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and business expenses 
•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers   

ou may also need to submit other documents that court rules identify as non-public documents, such as 

a medical record.  For example, a report from a doctor that provides a medical diagnosis or treatment 
plan for you or your child would qualify as a medical record.   

You must use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing other non-public documents, such as medical 
records, with the court.  One Form 11.2 cover sheet can be used for submitting all non-public 
documents.   

The failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being rejected by 
court administration, being available to the public, stricken from the court record, and 
sanctions from the court. 

ee Rule 11 of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice for more information about how to file 

documents containing social security numbers, financial account numbers, “financial source documents” 
and other non-public documents.   

Form 11.1 and Form 11.2 can be found at www.mncourts.gov/forms under the court forms category of 
“Confidential Information” and is court form number CON111 and CON112.

This question asks about  your monthly income.  If  you are paid weekly,  multiply  your weekly 
income by 4.33 to get monthly income.  If you are paid every two weeks, multiply by 2.17 to get

Complete the questions about medical and dental insurance. 

OTE:  If you, your spouse, or your children are covered by medical or dental insurance through 
your job or your spouse’s job, that coverage can be continued even after the divorce. If you want 
the insurance coverage to continue after the divorce, call the Employment Benefits Office of you 
or your spouse’s employer and ask for “COBRA” coverage. 

This question is about spousal maintenance.  Spousal maintenance is money paid by one spouse 
to help support the other spouse. Spousal maintenance used to be called alimony.  If you check 
YES for either (a) or (b), you need to provide details about the length of marriage, education of 
the spouse who would receive maintenance, gross monthly income, and reasons why the spouse 
would not be able to maintain the standard of living established during the marriage. 

List all the vehicles owned by you and Petitioner together or separately. 

ARNING:    Questions  23-24  ask  about  marital  and  non-marital  property.  Dividing  marital 

property and non-marital property is complicated. You should talk to an attorney. 

Marital  Property  means  almost  anything  that  you  or  your  spouse  own  that  you  or  your 
spouse received during the marriage, even during the times that you and your spouse were 
separated. This includes real estate, boats, cabins, household goods, furniture, jewelry, and 
other things. 

Non-marital  Property  means:  (1)  anything  that  you  or  your  spouse  owned  before  the 
marriage;  (2)  anything  that  you  or  your  spouse  received  as  a  gift,  bequest,  devise,  or 
inheritance; (3) anything that you or your spouse got in trade or in exchange for your non-
marital property; (4) anything that is an increase in the value of non-marital property; (5) 
anything  you  or  your  spouse  received  after  the  valuation  date  set  by  the  court;  or  (6) 
anything  included  by  a  valid  antenuptial  contract  (STOP:  If  you  have  an  antenuptial 
contract, you should stop here and talk to an attorney.)  

Check  YES  or  NO  whether  you  and  your  spouse  have  divided  the  marital  property  to  your 
mutual  satisfaction,  including  household  goods,  furniture,  furnishings,  and  other  belongings.  If 
you have NOT divided the marital property, list the items that you want. 

(a) Check YES or NO whether your spouse claims non-marital property.  Non-marital property 
is  property  owned  before  the  marriage  or  acquired  during  the  marriage  by  inheritance  or  gift.  
List all non-marital property your spouse owns.  

(a)  Check  YES  or  NO  whether  you  claim  non-marital  property.    Non-marital  property  is 
property you owned before you were married or acquired during the marriage by inheritance or 
gift.  List all non-marital property you own.  

Check  YES  or  NO  whether  you  or  your  spouse  has  money  in  banks,  savings,  cash  or 
investments.    If  YES,  fill  in  all  columns  in  the  box.    Use  Confidential  Information  Form  11.1

(CON111)  to  list  the  name  of  the  financial  institution,  account  holder  name(s),  and  account 
numbers.  Using  Form 11.1 keeps  your account numbers confidential from the public.  Do not 
list account numbers on the Answer and Counterpetition. 

Failure to use Form 11.1 means these numbers could be available to the general

Check YES or NO whether you and/or your spouse own part or all of a business.  If YES, fill in 
the name, address and value of the business. 

Check YES or NO if either you or your spouse own a manufactured home.  If YES, complete the 
detail questions. 

ARNING: Question 28 asks you to list all real property. Real property is land and the buildings on 

the land. You must list all real property owned by you and your spouse together, separately, or with 
others. Failure to list all property will create serious problems and expense in the future. Dividing real 
property is complicated. You should talk to an attorney if you and/or your spouse own any real 
property. You and your spouse both have an interest in all real estate owned by either you or your 
spouse until the divorce is finalized and the Decree awards the property to just one party.  For example, 
a deed given by one spouse to the other spouse before the divorce is finalized does not transfer all 
interest to the grantee spouse.  

(a) Check YES or NO if you and your spouse own any real property together.  

(b) Check YES or NO if your spouse owns real property solely in his/her name or with someone  

(c)  Check YES or NO if you own real property solely in your name or with someone other than

or separately. If YES, list all of the debts you and your spouse now have, even if only one of you 
created the debt and even if only one of your names is on the credit card, loan or note. List all 
debts still owed from before you were married, from during the marriage but before separation, 
and after separation.  The Judgment and Decree (divorce decree) will state who is responsible for 
paying each debt. Include credit card bills, gas bills, water bills, telephone bills, school loans, car 
loans, home loans and mortgages, and other bills and loans. List to whom the debt is owed (such 
as Sears); how the money was used (such as “clothing for the children”); whose name is on the 
account and when the debt was created (if you cannot get the exact date the debt was created, at 
least state if the debt is from before the marriage, or during the marriage and before separation, 
or after separation); the current balance due; and the monthly payment. Attach another sheet of 
paper if you need more space. You must disclose all debts.  

You may change your name as part of the divorce, but you do not have to do so. You can change 
your name to a maiden name, or some other name.  You cannot make your spouse change his or 
her  name,  and  your  spouse  cannot  make  you  change  your  name.    If  you  want  to  change  your 
name, check YES and answer (a) – (c).  If you do not want to change your name, check NO.   

(a)  Print your new name (first, middle, and last).  Do not use initials unless you want only 
an initial instead of a full name.  Check whether this is a former legal name or maiden 
name.  If not, explain why you want to change to this name.   

(b) You  cannot  change  your  name  if  your  reason  for  changing  your  name  is  to  defraud  or 
mislead  anyone.    Mark  True  or  False  to  the  statement  “Respondent  has  no  intent  to 
defraud or mislead anyone by changing his/her name.” 

(c)  If  you  have  a  felony  conviction,  you  cannot  change  your  name  unless  you  notify  the 
prosecuting  authority  that  you  intend  to  change  your  name.    The  prosecuting  authority 
has 30 days after being served with your notice to object to the name change.  If you have 
been convicted  of  a felony anywhere in the United States, answer (c) YES.  Ask Court 
Administration to give you the Felon Name Change Instructions or you can download the 
forms at www.mncourts.gov/forms.   
Warning:  If you do not notify the prosecuting authority of the request for name change 
and you use your new name, you may be guilty of a gross misdemeanor.

The server should hand-deliver a copy of your forms to your spouse.  However, if there is an attorney’s 
name and address on the Summons you received, the server must hand-deliver the forms to your 
spouse’s attorney.  

ote: The papers cannot be given to anyone other than your spouse or your spouse’s attorney, if any.  

ervice by Mail  

A copy of your Answer and Counterpetition is placed in an envelope addressed to your spouse’s 
attorney (or your spouse, if there is no attorney) with your return address on the envelope and is then 
sent by first class U.S. mail. The server must drop the letter in the mailbox or give it to the postal 
worker.  The address for your spouse’s attorney or your spouse is on the Summons you received, as part 
of the signature block. 
 

Step 4 
The Person Who Serves Your Spouse Must Fill Out the Affidavit of Service 

After the Answer is hand-delivered or mailed, the person who did the service must fill out an Affidavit of 
Service form and sign it under penalty of perjury. Perjury is the crime of intentionally lying or 
misrepresenting the truth.

Step 5 
File the Forms with the Court 

mmediately file the following documents with the Court Administrator.   
•  Answer and Counterpetition 
•  Confidential  Information  Form  11.1  (Include  names,  social  security  numbers  for  you  and  your 
spouse, and financial institution names with associated account numbers).  This information will be 
kept confidential.  You should also know that if at a later point in the divorce proceeding you need to 
file financial records such as bank statements, credit card statements, or income tax returns then you 
should fill out Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 for any financial records.  Using 
these  forms  ensures  that  your  social  security  number  and  other  financial  records  will  be  kept  in  a 
confidential part of the court file.) 

•  Affidavit of Personal Service      OR     Affidavit of Service by Mail 

t the time you file your forms, you will be required to pay a filing fee.  

f you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, the Judge may waive it under certain circumstances.  Ask the 
Court  Administrator/Deputy  for  an  In  Forma  Pauperis  application  or  download  the  forms  at 
www.mncourts.gov.forms.  Fill out this application and file it with the court.  Court administration staff

will  explain  local  practice  as  to  presenting  the  In  Forma  Pauper  application  to  a  judge  for  review.    A 
judge will review your application and decide if you must pay the filing fee.  The Court Administrator 
cannot process your legal papers without either the required filing free or an order from a judge waiving 
the fee.   
 

Step 6 
Temporary Relief 

f you and your spouse need a temporary order to address temporary spousal maintenance or any other 
matter  in  the  divorce,  go  to  the  Court  Administrator’s  office  and  ask  for  “Temporary  Relief  Pending 
Final  Hearing  Without  Children”  forms  or  download  the  forms  at  www.mncourts.gov/forms.      If  the 
judge signs the temporary order, that order is in effect until the judge signs the final order divorcing you 
and your spouse.   
 

Step 7 
Try to Settle All of the Issues with Your Spouse 

If  you  do  not  respond  to  the  Petition  for  Dissolution  of  Marriage  within  thirty  (30)  days,  your 
spouse will  notify the  court and  ask the  court  to grant  everything  asked for  in  the Petition.  The 
court will do so by issuing a final divorce decree called the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, 
Order for Judgment and Judgment and Decree.   

If  you  AGREE  with  everything  your  spouse  is  asking  for  in  the  Petition  for  Dissolution  of 
Marriage,  tell  your  spouse  in  writing.    Your  spouse  will  then  complete  a  document  called  a 
Stipulated Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order for Judgment and Judgment and Decree 
that you will be asked to review and sign to make sure it says what you agreed to for your divorce.   

If you do NOT AGREE with everything your spouse is asking for in the Petition for Dissolution of 
Marriage, you and your spouse should attempt to reach an agreement regarding as many issues as 
possible. 

If  you  and  your  spouse  reach  an  agreement  regarding  all  issues,  your  spouse  will  fill  out  a 
Stipulated Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order for Judgment and Judgment and Decree 
that you will be asked to review and sign to make sure it says what you agreed to for your divorce.   

f  you  and  your  spouse  DO  NOT  reach  an  agreement  regarding  all  of  the  issues,  you  and  your 
spouse  will  have  to  go  to  court  and  a  judge  will  decide  the  issues  for  you  after  a  trial.    If 
disagreements still exist, go to Step 8 and fill out the Parenting Financial Disclosure Statement.  
The Parenting / Financial Disclosure Statement form and instructions can be found on the court’s 
website at www.mncourts.gov/forms under the court forms category of “Family” or from the court 
administrator.

Step 8 
Wait For Your Final Divorce Decree 

If you and your spouse reached an agreement settling all of the issues in your marriage by signing 
a Stipulated Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order for Judgment and Judgment and Decree, 
your  spouse  will  file  the  document  with  the  court.    The  Court  Administrator  will  send  you  and 
your  spouse  a  notice  telling  you  when  the  Judge  has  signed  the  Stipulated  Findings  of  Fact, 
Conclusions of Law, Order for Judgment and Judgment and Decree. 

If you and your spouse were unable to settle all of the issues and you had to go to trial, the court 
will issue the final divorce decree within 90 days after the trial.  This will be called the Findings of 
Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order for Judgment and Judgment and Decree.   

ARNING:    YOU  ARE  NOT  DIVORCED  UNTIL  THE  JUDGE  AND  THE  COURT 
ADMINISTRATOR/DEPUTY  SIGNS  THE  FINDINGS  OF  FACT,  CONCLUSIONS  OF  LAW, 
ORDER FOR JUDGMENT AND JUDGMENT AND DECREE.  You will be notified by mail when 
this  happens.    You  may  obtain  a  plain  copy  or  certified  copy  of  your  Divorce  Decree  from  the  Court 
Administrator.  There is a cost for a certified copy and a cost for a plain copy.  Make checks payable to 
“Court  Administrator.”    Include  your  name  and  the  case  number  in  your  request.    NOTE:    You  may 
make additional copies of your Decree.  However, a copy is “certified” only if it has the original seal of 
the District Court.  You cannot make a certified copy yourself. 
 
OTHER STEPS AFTER ENTRY OF THE DECREE   
It is the responsibility of the parties to take all necessary steps to put into effect the orders of the court. 
For example, if you changed your name you will need to get your driver’s license and social security 
card changed to reflect your new legal name. If you or Respondent were awarded pension or medical 
benefits, the company or provider will need to see the Decree and may have other requirements before 
making the changes ordered by the court. If you and/or Respondent own real estate, there are additional 
steps you must take to transfer the title to the real estate to the party who was granted the real estate in 
the Decree.  

 

nder Minnesota law, both spouses have an interest in real estate, even if only one spouse’s name is 

on the deed or title of the property.  

roof of divorce and proof of who was awarded interests in the real estate is usually recorded in the 

real estate records before selling or mortgaging the property after the divorce. 

o give that proof, the complete divorce decree can be filed in the real estate records. Or, a short version 

of the divorce decree can be filed, called Summary Real Estate Disposition Judgment Form (SREDJ). 
The SREDJ only includes information needed for real estate title purposes. If you file the SREDJ, 
information about your children, work, and other personal matters is not available in the county real 
estate records.  The Minnesota Judicial Branch publishes a set of instructions to help you with the 
SREDJ process. Those instructions can be found on the court’s website at 
http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=15&f=572.  

Get legal advice from an attorney if you are not sure what actions to take with your real estate.
