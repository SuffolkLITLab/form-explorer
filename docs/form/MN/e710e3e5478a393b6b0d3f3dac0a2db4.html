      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS 
Limited Removal of a Conciliation Court Case to 
District Court 

Important Notices and Resources 

The Court has forms and instructions, for some types of cases, as a general guide to the court process. 
These instructions  explain the steps in more detail and answer common questions but are not a full 
guide to the law. Court employees may be able to give general information on court rules and 
procedures, but they cannot give legal advice.  

Have questions about court forms or instructions? 

• Visit www.MNCourts.gov/SelfHelp 
• Call the Statewide Self-Help Center at 651-435-6535 

Not sure what to do about a legal issue or need advice? 

• Talk with a lawyer 
• Visit www.MNCourts.gov/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx  

Helpful materials may be found at your public county law library. For a directory, see  
http://mn.gov/law-library/research-links/county-law-libraries.jsp . For more information, contact court 
administration or call the Minnesota State Law Library at 651-297-7651. 

Forms You May Need 

•  Demand for Limited Removal to District  Court, Affidavit of Good Faith, and Notice of Hearing 

De Novo (New Hearing)(CCT502);  and 

•  Affidavit of Service for Limited Removal (CCT503)  OR Conciliation Court Affidavit of Service 

(CCT103). 

Forms are available online at https://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=10.  

General Information 

You can find more information about Conciliation  Court online at https://mncourts.gov/Help-
Topics/Conciliation-Court.aspx.  

If your request to vacate a default judgment is denied, you may demand "limited" removal of this 
the motion to vacate the default judgment to the district court for re-hearing.  

Instructions – Limited Removal of a Conciliation Court Case to District Court 
CCT501      State       ENG 

Rev 2/22             www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 1 of 4 

You must comply with the Conciliation  Court Rules 520  and 521  of the Minnesota General Rules of 
Practice which govern limited removals to district  court (revisor.mn.gov/court_rules/rule/gp-toh/. If 
you do not understand what is required, it is suggested that you may wish to consult with an 
attorney (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx). 

Keep in mind that this is a limited removal, and the judicial  officer will  decide only the issue of 
whether or not the default judgment should be vacated and a new trial  granted. If the district  court 
judicial  officer grants your motion to vacate the default judgment, the case will  be returned to 
conciliation  court for a new trial of your case. If the judicial officer denies your motion, the judgment 
stands. However, you may appeal the judicial  officer's decision to the Minnesota Court of Appeals 
within the required time. See the Rules of Civil Appellate Procedure 
(revisor.mn.gov/court_rules/ap/). 
 

Step 1 
Fill Out the Demand for Limited Removal to District Court, Affidavit of Good Faith, 
and Notice of Hearing De Novo (New Hearing) (CCT5002) 

The Caption 

The caption is at the top of the form.  Fill  in all of the information exactly the same as on the Notice 
of Conciliation Court Order/Entry of Judgment. 

 

The Form 

Instructions – Limited Removal of a Conciliation Court Case to District Court 
CCT501      State       ENG 

Rev 2/22             www.mncourts.gov/forms  

 

Page 2 of 4 

1.  Fill  in the name of the person who filed the motion asking the court to vacate the order for 

judgment. 

2.  Fill  in the court file number of the Conciliation Court case. 

3.  Check the box showing whether the person appealing the denial of their motion is the 

Plaintiff or the Defendant. 

Signature Block 

Sign and date the Demand form under penalty of perjury. Perjury is the crime of intentionally lying 
or misrepresenting the truth, punishable by jail or other sanctions.   

Include the county and state you are in when you sign the form, and your personal contact 
information under the signature. 

Step 2 
Make Copies 

Make one copy of the form for each party in the case, including yourself. 

The next 3 steps (3-5) are about serving and filing. 

Serving is the making sure all  other parties in your case receive a copy of your Demand. 

Filing means giving your Demand (and Affidavit of Service, explained below) to court administration 
and pay the filing  fee. 

If you cannot afford the filing fee, you may apply for a fee waiver pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 563.01 
(revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/563.01). See the Fee Waiver Help Topic (mncourts.gov/Help-
Topics/Fee-Waiver-IFP.aspx). 

Your deadline for serving and filing the completed forms depends on how you received the Notice 
of Denial of Motion to Vacate: 

If the court gave you the Notice of the Denial electronically or in person, serve and file the 
completed forms with the District Court within 21  days of the date the Notice of Denial of 
Motion to Vacate was sent electronically  or given to you in person.  The date is specified on 
the Notice. 

If the court sent the Notice of the Denial to you through the mail, then you add an extra 3 
days, so you would have to serve and file the completed forms within 24  days of the date the 
Notice was sent to you. 

 

 

 

Instructions – Limited Removal of a Conciliation Court Case to District Court 
CCT501      State       ENG 

Rev 2/22             www.mncourts.gov/forms  

Page 3 of 4 

Step 3 
Serve a Copy of the Completed Demand Form 

A copy of your Demand for Limited Removal to District Court must be served on each opposing party 
or their attorney by first class  mail, by electronic means, or by personal service.   See Minnesota 
Rules of General Practice 14 and 521(b)(1) (revisor.mn.gov/court_rules/rule/gp-toh).   

Personal service must be done by someone at least 18  years old and not a party to the case.  See 
Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure 4.03  (revisor.mn.gov/court_rules/rule/cp-toh/).   

Papers cannot be served on legal holidays as defined in Minn. Stat. § 645.44,  subd. 5 
(revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44).  

 

 

Step 4 
Fill Out the Affidavit of Service for Limited Removal (CCT503) – OR – Conciliation 
Court Affidavit of Service (CCT103) 

The Affidavit of Service tells the court who served the papers on the other parties and how and 
when the papers were served.  

The person who served the papers (by mail or by personal service) should complete the Affidavit of 
Service form (CCT103  or CCT503)  and sign it under penalty of perjury.  Perjury is the crime of 
intentionally lying or misrepresenting the truth, punishable by jail  or other sanctions. 

Step 5 
File the Forms with the District Court 

File the forms (Demand and Affidavit of Service) with Court Administration.  You will  need to pay the 
district  court filing  fee or ask for a fee waiver (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Fee-Waiver-IFP.aspx). 

This is a new court action  to be heard in District  Court.  

Do not file the Demand in the Conciliation Court case.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
