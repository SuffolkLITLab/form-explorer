GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CHANGE OF VENUE PACKET  

The information contained in this document is not intended as legal advice but as a general guide 
to you to explain the legal process.  If you do not understand any of these procedures, talk to an 
attorney.  Court staff cannot give legal advice. 

A motion to change venue is a way to ask the court to move your case from the county your case 
is in now to a different county within Minnesota.   

NOTE: If you are not sure if these forms should be used in your situation, you should get legal 
advice.  

 

Step 1 

Fill Out the Notice of Motion and Motion for Change of Venue 
(FAM802) 

Section 1: The Caption  

The top part of the form helps identify the case.  Generally, the caption in your case will be the 
same for everything that is filed in the case. Follow the steps below to fill in the caption section.  

 You will find the information you need to fill out the caption on a court document from your 
existing civil case.  If you do not have any documents from your court file, and if you do not 
know the information, you will need to look in your court file. 

•  Some limited case records can be viewed online at www.mncourts.gov/publicaccess. 
• 

If you cannot view your case online, you may need to go to the courthouse in the county 
where your case is located to view your court file.

www.mncourts.gov/forms                  Page 2 of 12 

A.  At the top of the page, write in the following information: 

•  The county where the case is located; 
•  The judicial district number (each county is located in 1 of 10 judicial districts: 

http://www.mncourts.gov/Find-Courts.aspx);  

•  Your court file number (this usually starts with a 2-digit number, followed by letters 

and numbers.  For example, 15-CV-19-0001); and 

•  The case type.  
 

B.  Fill in the blank to tell the court what kind of family case you have (for example, In Re the 

Marriage of, or In Re the Custody of the Children of).  
 

C.  Write the full name of the Petitioner and the Respondent as they are found on the court 

document mentioned earlier.  If your name is incorrect in any way, you can add “aka” (Also 
Known As) and then your correct name. 

The party labels (petitioner and respondent) do not change during the case. For example, 
the party who is labeled as the petitioner in the case will always be the petitioner on all of 
the forms in the case.  

D.  If your case has an intervenor, write their name here.  

An intervenor is a person or agency who has been added as a party to a case. A common 
example of an intervenor is the county in some child support cases or child protection 
cases, however there are other types of cases that may have an intervenor. To find out if 
there is an intervenor in your case, look at a recent court order or document which will 
show all parties involved. You could also check your court record online or at your local 
courthouse.

ection 2: The Statement of Facts

are supposed to write down facts that support the request to move your case to another county. 
Later on, you will sign the Affidavit in Support of Motion under penalty of perjury.  This is like

ection 3: The Signature Block / Penalty of Perjury 

Date and sign the form. Then fill out your personal contact information below your signature. 

When you sign your Affidavit in Support of Motion, you are signing under penalty of 
perjury.  Perjury is the crime of intentionally lying or misrepresenting the truth.  By 
signing under penalty of perjury, you are stating that the information in your Affidavit is 
true to the best of your knowledge.   

 

Step 3 

Contact Court Administration About a Hearing Date 

n some districts, you need to schedule the hearing before you serve and file your motion. In 
other districts, you get a hearing date after you file. It is important that you check with your local 
Court Administration to see how to schedule a hearing for your motion. If you do not schedule a 
hearing, the court will not do anything with your motion. To look up courthouse locations and 
contact information you can visit the court’s website at http://www.mncourts.gov/Find-
Courts.aspx 

If you are able to schedule a hearing date right away:  

•  Then go back to the “Notice” section (Section 2F: The Notice) on the first page of your 
Notice of Motion and Motion (FAM802). Fill in the information in the boxes (hearing 
date, time, location, and name of judicial officer).

If your district schedules the hearing after you file:  

•  Then you can write in “To Be Determined” in the “Notice” section of your Notice of 
Motion and Motion (FAM801). Note: it is okay to fill in the name and address of the 
courthouse.  

•  Later on, once you do have a hearing date, you will need to fill out the Notice of Hearing 

form (CIV604) and serve that form on the other parties (See Step 7 below).  
Note: CIV604 is available online at http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=7&f=515.  
 

Step 4

(plus any attachments) for each party, including yourself. Be sure to bring your copy with you to 
court when you go to the hearing.  

Step 5

        O

verview of Service 

The other party must receive notice of the hearing and complete copies of all documents you 
plan on filing with the court. This is called "service of process." The papers can be served 
personally (handed to the other party), or by mail. There is a deadline that you need to complete 
service by depending on which way you serve the papers. The ways to serve, and their deadlines 
are explained below.  

Papers CANNOT be served on legal holidays as defined in Minn. Stat. 645.44 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/645.44#stat.645.44.5).

At least 21 days before the hearing date, the server hands to the other party one copy of the 
completed Notice of Motion and Motion, and one copy of your Affidavit in Support of Motion, 
including one copy of any and all attachments. Example: If the hearing date is January 30, the 
papers must be served on or before January 9. If January 9 is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal 
holiday, keep counting backwards to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday 
to determine the service deadline.  

Personal Service 

Service by Mail 

The server places one copy of the completed Notice of Motion and Motion form, one copy of 
your Affidavit in Support of Motion, and one copy of any and all attachments in an envelope.  

The server must mail the envelope containing the forms to the other party by first class U.S. mail 
at least 24 days before the hearing date.  Example: If the hearing is January 30, the papers 
must be postmarked no later than January 6. If January 6 is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, 
keep counting backwards to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday to 
determine the service deadline. 

Warning: If your forms are not personally served on the other party at least 21 days before 
the hearing OR mailed to the other party at least 24 days before the hearing date, your 
Motion may NOT be heard by the court. 

If there is more than one petitioner or more than one respondent, please note that ALL of 
the other parties must be served.

•  Original Notice of Motion and Motion for Change of Venue;  
•  Original Notice of Hearing (if needed from step 3 above);  
•  Original Affidavit in Support of Motion (including any attachments); and  
•  Original Affidavit of Personal Service or Affidavit of Service by Mail (one 

Affidavit of Service for each party other than yourself).  

There will be a motion fee due when you file your paperwork. You can make checks payable to 
“District Court.”  To find out what your motion fee may be you can contact court administration 
or look the fee up on the court’s website at http://www.mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Court-
Fees/District-Court-Fees.aspx 

If you cannot afford to pay the motion fee, you can ask for a fee waiver by completing the forms 
in the In Forma Pauperis/IFP packet of forms (found online at 
http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=19&p=69). If a judge does not sign the fee waiver order, 
then you must pay the motion fee before Court Administration can process your forms. 

Step 8 

Notice of Hearing Form (CIV604) 

f you filed your Notice of Motion and Motion and Affidavit in Support of Motion without a 
hearing date, then you need to use the Notice of Hearing form (CIV604) to let the other party 
know when the hearing date is scheduled. 

CIV604 is available online at http://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=7&f=515.  

If you use the Notice of Hearing form, follow these instructions to fill it out: 

1.  Fill out the caption like you did for the Notice of Motion and Motion. 

2.  After the word “TO,” write the name and address of each party except yourself. 

3.  Fill in the details of the hearing (date, time, location, name of judicial officer).

4.  Fill in the date that you filed the original Notice of Motion and Motion.  If you do not 

remember the date, you may be able to look it up online at 
www.mncourts.gov/publicaccess.  

5.  Date and sign the form, then print the requested information. 

6.  Make one copy of this Notice of Hearing form for each party (including for yourself). 

7.  Serve a copy of the Notice of Hearing form on each of the other parties, like you did with 

the Notice of Motion and Motion.  See Steps 5 and 6 above. 

8.  File the original Notice of Hearing form and one Affidavit of Service form (for each party 
other than yourself) with Court Administration.  There is no additional filing fee for the 
Notice of Hearing and Affidavit of Service forms. 

Step 9 

Go to Your Hearing 

o prepare for your hearing, it is a good idea to look at the court rules that apply to family and 
civil cases.  You can find links to these rules online.   You could also visit a law library to read 
the court rules. 

You must go to court on the date set for the hearing.  It is important to be on time.  If you are 
even a few minutes late, the judicial officer may dismiss your motion. 

Bring your copies of the paperwork with you to the hearing.  If the other party has served you 
with a responsive motion, be prepared to talk about your response to their responsive motion at 
the hearing.  If you are unsure how to prepare for the hearing, or what evidence you should 
bring, you should get legal advice before your court date.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
