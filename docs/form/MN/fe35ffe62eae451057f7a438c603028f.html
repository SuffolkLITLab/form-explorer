      <pre>Petitioner’s Instructions for Expungement  
(Sealing) of Criminal Records  
(Minn. Stat. §§ 609A.01  - .03)  

  
Please read all instructions before filling out paperwork.  You will need to make additional 
copies if you are seeking to expunge more than  one file.  
  

•  A Motion to Expunge is a complicated procedure.  
• 

If you have any questions or are in need of more assistance, you should contact  an 
attorney (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx).    
•  The court  administrator’s  office cannot give you legal advice.  

  
You may also want to view the “What is Criminal Expungement” video, as well as the tutorial 
on how to complete the expungement forms.  These materials are available on the 
Minnesota Judicial Branch  website at www.mncourts.gov  under Help Topics / Criminal 
Expungement. Contact  a Self-Help Center (www.mncourts.gov/selfhelp) if you have questions 
about these instructions or the criminal expungement process. 
  
EXPUNGEMENT OR SEALING OF A RECORD  – WHAT IT MEANS  
Minn. Stat. ch. 609A  (revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609A) states that the expungement of 
criminal  records is limited to a court order sealing records and prohibiting disclosure of their 
existence or their opening except under court order or statutory authority.  Nothing in the law 
authorizes destruction of records or their return to you. A judicial  officer must decide this 
petition.  
  
Once sealed/expunged, a record will  not be available to the general public.  However, for orders 
issued before January 1, 2015,  Minn. Stat. § 609A.03,  subd. 7 
(revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609A.03), states that law enforcement agencies, prosecution or 
correctional  authorities, may seek an order signed by a judicial officer to re-open a sealed case 
for the purpose of a criminal  investigation, prosecution or sentencing. The records may be 
opened for the purposes of evaluating a prospective employee of a criminal  justice agency, 
without a court order, pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 609A.03,  subd. 7, or for certain social  services 
licensing purposes.  For orders issued on or after January 1, 2015,  Minn. Stat. § 609A.03,  subd. 
7a, states the limitations  of an expungement order and provides authority for certain agencies 
to access and share expunged records under certain circumstances.   
  
YOU MAY QUALIFY FOR AN EXPUNGEMENT  UNDER MINNESOTA STATUTE  ch. 609A  IF:  
•  The charges were dismissed, you were found not guilty, or the case did not otherwise result 

in a guilty plea or finding, or a conviction.    

•  You successfully completed the terms of a diversion or stay of adjudication, or were 

convicted of a crime that qualifies for expungement under Minn. Stat. § 609A.02,  subd. 3 
(revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609A.02), and the required amount of time has passed.

•  You were charged with a controlled substance offense - the proceedings have been 

dismissed and discharged.  

•  You were a juvenile prosecuted as an adult.  
•  The Board of Pardons has granted you a pardon extraordinary.    
  
In the situations listed above, the court can order all records of that criminal  case kept in 
Minnesota to be sealed.  If there is no court file (the prosecutor did not file formal charges or 
the grand jury did not file an indictment) and you have not been convicted of any felony or 
gross misdemeanor in any state for the preceding 10 years, a petition to the court is not 
necessary to expunge your arrest record.  You should contact the arresting agency and/or the 
BCA [Minn. Stat. § 299C.11,  subd. 1(b), revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/299C.11].  

If you were convicted in any other situation, your case does not meet the criteria  under Minn. 
Stat. ch.  609A  (revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609A).  Expungement of a conviction  not meeting 
the 609A  criteria is possible, but rare and can only be granted for the court’s records.  Records 
of your arrest and prosecution held by the police, sheriff’s office, prosecutors and the BCA 
would not be affected by such an expungement order.  Certain crimes can be expunged only if 
you can convince the court that you have made changes in your life that demonstrate you are 
very unlikely to commit another crime, and that the benefit to you from an expungement 
outweighs the burden of sealing the records.   

To request expungement of a conviction not meeting the 609A  criteria,  check the last box of 
item #9 of the Petition which states “I was convicted of an offense that does not qualify for 
expungement under Minn. Stat. § 609A.02,  subd. 3, but I have rehabilitated myself.  The benefit 
to me outweighs the disadvantage to the public and the burden on the court.”  An order 
expunging a conviction under these circumstances may provide only for expungement of the 
record held by state courts and may not expunge records held by state or local  law 
enforcement and prosecution agencies.  

Helpful materials  may be found at your public county law library.   For a directory, see   
http://mn.gov/law-library/research-links/county-law-libraries.jsp  .  For more information,  
contact your court administrator  or call  the Minnesota State Law Library  at 651-297-7651.   

ROCEDURES  FOR EXPUNGEMENTS   

  P

A. COMPLETELY  FILL OUT A SEPARATE  PETITION  AND ORDER  FOR EACH CASE YOU WANT 

EXPUNGED:  

1.  NOTICE OF HEARING AND PETITION FOR EXPUNGEMENT  

You must fill out this document completely and sign your name.  IT IS 
MANDATORY that you list all prior and pending criminal  charges in this or any 
other state on this petition as well as any stays of adjudication, continuances for

dismissal, or pretrial diversions in any jurisdiction.  If you are unsure about your 
court records, all Minnesota counties have public access terminals where you 
may look up your case information.  The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal 
Apprehension (BCA) will  provide a printed record for a fee.  You may contact  the 
BCA at 651-793-2400  for more information.  

Obtain a hearing date from Court Administration  to be inserted in the notice.  
This date must be more than 60  days from the date notice is mailed plus 3 days 
for mailing.   

2.  PROPOSED ORDER  TO EXPUNGE CRIMINAL RECORDS     

You must complete a separate order for each case that you want expunged.  
There are three types of orders (court form EXP105,  court form EXP106,  or court 
form EXP107).  Use the one appropriate to your situation, as indicated on the 
petition (court form EXP102).  

3. REQUEST FOR WAIVER OF FILING FEE—IN FORMA PAUPERIS (IFP) If you are not 
requesting expungement of an action or proceeding that was resolved in your 
favor, and you will  be seeking waiver of the filing fee, additional papers need to 
be completed.  See section D to see if you qualify for fee waiver.  You will  need to 
ask for a waiver form (IFP) specifically.   Fee waiver forms are available at 
https://mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=19&p=69.  You will have to provide 
financial  information to have the court determine whether you qualify to have 
the fee waived.  The fee or the order waiving the fee must be submitted when 
the petition is filed.    

B.  MAKE COPIES OF THE COMPLETED  FORMS YOU WILL NEED  FOR SERVICE ON EACH 

AGENCY AND THEIR ATTORNEYS.     

Minn. Stat. § 609A.03,  subd. 3 (revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609A.03), requires that a 
Notice of Hearing and Petition and unsigned proposed expungement order on ALL state 
and local  agencies and their attorneys that might have a record of the offense you want 
to expunge.  Most people need to serve at least 6 agencies; for example, the Minnesota 
Bureau of Criminal  Apprehension, the Attorney General’s Office, the local  police 
department, the prosecuting attorney, the sheriff’s department, county attorney, and 
county department of corrections (probation).  

Items to copy and serve:  

1.  Notice of Hearing and Petition( with the scheduled hearing date completed)  
2.  The unsigned proposed Order you are seeking to have the judicial officer issue.

IMPORTANT!  Get legal advice about serving OTHER agencies such as the MN Dept. of 
Human Services (regulates employment in health care, education, day care, foster care, etc.) 
or licensing agencies (for teaching, nursing, real estate, etc.) Depending on your situation, 
serving those agencies may or may not be in your best interest.  

  

C.  PROCESS FOR SERVICE   

You are responsible to see that service is done properly.  Court staff cannot serve the 
documents for you.  Service can be done by another adult, or by you. The server must 
mail a copy of all  required documents and fill  out the Proof of Service.  Service must be 
complete at least 63 days before the scheduled hearing date.   

1.  Fill  out these parts of the Proof of Service form:  

Get a separate Proof of Service form for each court case you want to expunge. Example: 
If you want to expunge 3 different court cases, you must prepare a separate Proof of 
Service form for each case, for a total of 3 service forms.  

YOU must fill  in the blanks for the government agency addresses on the Proof of Service 
form. Write the County name and the City name where the offense happened (or where 
you were arrested), and write the address for each local government agency related to 
that case. If you decide to serve the MN Dept. of Human Services and/or Dept. of 
Health, check the box next to their address listed on the form. If you are serving other 
agencies, write their names and addresses in the extra spaces on the form and check 
those boxes.  

Using the same court information from your criminal  case, you must fill  in the blanks at 
the top of the Proof of Service form with the County, Judicial  District  and Court File 
Number. STOP! The server must fill out the other blanks on the form. See #3 below 
called “How the server must complete the Proof of Service  form.”  

2.  Get copies of your expungement papers ready to be served.  

Your expungement papers can be served by first class U.S. mail. Copies of the Proof of 
Service do not have to be mailed to the government agencies.  

STEP 1:  Make copies of your completed Petition and proposed Order.    

Make one copy of your completed Petition (and any attachments) and proposed Order 
for each government agency, and make one copy for yourself. Copies can be double-
sided to save on cost.   Example:  If you are serving 8 agencies checked in your Proof of 
Service, you need to make 9 copies of your papers (1 for each agency + 1 for you).   

Do not count your ORIGINALS as a “copy” in the total. Keep the ORIGINAL Petition 
and proposed Order  to file with the court as soon as possible after service of your 
papers is complete.

STEP 2:  Address an envelope for each government agency checked on your Proof of 
Service form.  

If you want to expunge only one case, a set of copies should fit into a regular business-
size envelope. You need larger envelopes to hold expungement papers for two or more 
cases. Most people need at least 6 envelopes, or more if they serve a City Attorney and 
regulatory/licensing agencies. You should write your return address on the envelopes.   

  
 NOTE: If you want to expunge more than one case in the same County, you can put copies for 
each case into the same envelope addressed to a government office.  Example: If you are asking      

to expunge 5 cases, you can put a set of copies for each case into one large envelope addressed 

to the BCA; then do the same for the other government agencies.   STOP!  If any of the 5 

offenses happened in different cities within the County, be sure to serve the correct copy of 

expungement papers on the correct local government agencies (police & prosecutor) where each 

offense happened.  

  
STEP 3:  Add enough postage to each envelope to send by 1st class U.S. Mail.  
The amount of postage you need depends on the number of pages in each envelope. It’s 
a good idea to weigh your envelopes at a Post Office, and buy the correct postage. You 
do not need to use “certified” or “return receipt” mail.   STOP! Do not let a Post Office 
employee put the envelopes in the mailbox!    
  
STEP 4:  The server mails the envelopes.  
The server puts your envelopes in a U.S. mailbox and follows the instructions below to 
complete the Proof of Service form.  
  
STEP 5:  After mailing, the server must complete the Proof of Service form.  
When the form is completed, you will file it with the court.  

3.  How the server must complete the Proof of Service form.  
AFTER  the server places your envelopes in a U.S. mailbox, the server must fill out the 
blanks on the Proof of Service form as follows:   

•  write in the name of the County where the Proof of Service form is signed (can 

be different from where case is filed);  

•  write the server’s name in the blank for the person who mailed the envelopes;  

•  write the date they mailed the envelopes. This date must be at least 63  days 

BEFORE  the hearing date;

•  write in the name of the City where they mailed the envelopes; and  

• 

sign the Proof of Service.  

  
If another adult served for you, then after completing these steps, they should give the 
signed Proof of Service form back to YOU.  
 

D.  FILING THE PAPERWORK WITH DISTRICT  COURT  

After copies of the documents have been served on all required agencies and their 
attorneys, the  Notice of Hearing and Petition for Expungement, the proposed order 
along with written proof (Proof of Service) that all agencies have been served must be 
filed with the court administrator’s office.  File your documents as soon as you have 
completed the service process.    

  

•  A filing fee is not required for cases that were “resolved in your favor.”  This means 

no filing fee is required if you were not convicted, were not found guilty, and did not 
plead guilty in the case, or you were exonerated under Minn. Stat. § 590.11.   If the 
case was “resolved in your favor,” inform court personnel that the filing fee is 
waived by statute.  

•  A filing fee is required for cases in which you were convicted or where you were 

found guilty by the court or entered a guilty plea, even if you were not convicted or 
the conviction was later vacated.  
 

Check with the court administrator  in the county where you are filing for the correct 
filing fee amount.  If you do not qualify for fee waiver under statute, you may ask the 
court to waive the filing fee by completing a form called “Affidavit for Proceeding In 
Forma Pauperis” and following the instructions given to you by court personnel.  

Write the court date and time on your calendar! The court may not send you a 
reminder. If you don’t go to your hearing, you might have to start over from the 
beginning.  

E.  AGENCY OPPORTUNITY TO OBJECT   

Each agency that you serve with the petition and proposed order has an opportunity to 
provide information to the court for its consideration of your request.  If an agency 
chooses to provide information to the court, it must send you a copy of what it submits 
and will  use the address you list in the petition.

F.  THE COURT HEARING   

You must appear at the hearing.  Bring your copies of the documents along with you to 
court for your own reference.  The original  documents should already be in the court 
file.  

At the hearing, the judicial officer will  review your petition and any attachments you 
have submitted. The judicial  officer will also consider any information presented by the 
prosecutor, any of the various government agencies and any victim.  A victim has the 
right to submit an oral or written statement to the court.  You may be required to testify 
and be cross examined by attorneys for any agency or office that opposes your request.  

The judicial  officer may not make a decision at the time of the hearing and may or may 
not grant the expungement. The judicial officer may sign the proposed order that you 
have provided (granting or denying your request) or may prepare his or her own order.  
The judicial  officer may deny expungement if your request does not meet the necessary 
qualifications  even if no one objects.  

When the order is signed, the court administrator's  office will  send a copy of the order 
to all  the agencies named in the order to receive notice. If your request was granted, 
these agencies have 60 days to appeal the order. Your record remains public during this 
period, while any appeal is pending, and while any financial  obligation  owed on the case 
remains unpaid.  Any party whose records will be affected by the order may file an 
appeal to the Minnesota Court of Appeals.  If an appeal is filed, you will be responsible 
for representing yourself or retaining an attorney to represent you.  If no appeal is filed, 
and you do not owe any financial  obligation,  the record will be sealed 60 days after the 
filing of the order. It is a good idea to obtain a certified copy of this order for your own 
records.  A certified copy fee will be charged unless you have an in forma pauperis (IFP) 
order.
