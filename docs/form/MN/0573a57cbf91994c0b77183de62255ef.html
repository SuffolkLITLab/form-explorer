IMPORTANT NOTICES 

  You cannot use these forms unless there is already a court order awarding custody. 

  Use these forms to respond to a request to change physical or legal custody, or to change the 

primary residence of the children as specified in the parenting plan. 

  You  cannot  ask  the  court  to  change  the  child's  custody  or  to  change  the  child’s  primary 
residence as specified in the parenting plan if (1) it has been less than one year since the last 
custody  order  or  (2)  if  it  has  been  less  than  2  years  since  the  last  request  to change custody, 
unless the children is/are currently in danger or unless there is a persistent and willful denial of 
or  interference  with  parenting  time  or  unless  the  other  party  agrees  in  writing  to  change 
custody. 

  If your child is the subject of a child in need of protection or services (CHIPS) proceeding or 
certain delinquency proceedings, the court may be not able to immediately decide a request to 
modify custody. 

  Court personnel and the County Attorney's office CANNOT help you fill out these forms. 

  You should see a lawyer if you don't know how to answer the questions on these forms or if 

you think the other party will hire a lawyer. 

  You  MUST  fill  out  both  the  Responsive  Notice  of  Motion  and  Motion  and  the  Affidavit  in 

Support of Responsive Motion and you MUST follow the instructions set forth below. 

  Type your answers or print neatly using dark ink. 

  If you need more space to answer a question, use an additional full sheet of paper. 

  The court expects every person who appears in court without a lawyer to know the law.  If you 

act as your own lawyer, you must do what a lawyer would do.

INTRODUCTION 
 
You have been served with a motion in which the other party is asking the court to change something about 
the existing custody order.  These instructions, starting at Step 1, tell you how to respond to that motion.  Read 
the instructions carefully, paying particular attention to the time deadlines. 

he Notice of Motion and Motion you received tell you the date and time of the hearing at which the judge 

will consider the motion.  This introduction summarizes what happens at the hearings. 

hat Happens at the Court Hearing? 

There will probably be two court appearances if you are opposing the other party’s request for modification.  
The first court appearance usually involves a short hearing of up to 30 minutes.  At the first hearing, the judge 
will only consider the written Affidavits you and the other party filed.  

he judge will use the first hearing to decide if the other party presented a “prima facie case.”   For purposes 
of deciding if the other party presented a prima facie case, the judge will assume that all facts stated in the 
other person’s Affidavit are true.  If the facts in the Affidavit legally support a change of custody, the judge 
may  schedule  a  second,  longer  hearing.      At  the  first  hearing  the  judge  does  NOT  decide  whether  the 
Affidavits presented by the person seeking to change custody are in fact true.  The judge will decide which 
fact allegations are true and which fact allegations are not true only after the second hearing.  At the second 
hearing, you and the other party will testify under oath and bring witnesses.   

f the other party’s Affidavit in Support of Motion to Change Custody does not state a “prima facie case,” the 
judge  may  dismiss  the  case  without  taking  any sworn testimony. The judge will dismiss the case because, 
even if the party asking for a change in custody and his or her witnesses testify and prove that everything in 
the Affidavit is the truth, the standards under Minnesota law for making a change or modification to custody 
would not be met.  If the case is dismissed, the existing order will remain in effect. 

ustody Evaluations  

On many occasions the judge will ask for a custody evaluation in order to have someone gather facts to help 
the judge make  a  decision.  A custody evaluation from Family Court Services takes at least 120 days, and 
there is a cost.  (If a party has an “IFP” the fee is waived. “IFP” is explained at Step 9.)  If a custody evaluation 
is ordered, the gap between the first, short hearing and the second evidentiary hearing often will be at least five 
months.  The judge may also appoint a guardian ad litem to do a custody evaluation.  This person may or may 
not be a lawyer. 

void This Mistake:  Often people think they can briefly write what they want in the Motion and Affidavit 
forms, and supply the details to the judge at the hearing.  This is a big mistake.  Do not assume you can talk 
about something that is not in your papers.  You should write everything you want the judge to know in your 
Affidavit in Response to Motion to Change Custody.  Another common mistake is to state conclusions, not 
facts, in the Affidavit filed with the Responsive Motion.  An example of a conclusion is:  the other parent 
abuses my child.  Do not state conclusions without supporting facts. Give the judge detailed information so 
that the judge can draw his own conclusions.  Write down the actions the other party has taken, or evidence of 
actions that you believe supports the conclusion.  Remember, courts operate by rules and laws, not by what 
makes  sense  to  you.    If  you  choose  to  represent  yourself,  the  court  rules  say  that  you  are  responsible  for 
knowing the law and  rules,  just  like an attorney.   The  judge  cannot give  you special consideration or help 
because you are not a lawyer.

If the Child is in Danger 
In  extremely  rare cases,  a  judge  may  change  custody  on  a  temporary  basis  before  a  full  hearing  with  live 
testimony has been heard by the court.  Those rare cases involve situations in which the child is in immediate, 
significant danger if the existing custody arrangement continues.  If your child is in immediate danger, you 
may seek legal advice from a private attorney or other legal services provider; contact social services; seek an 
Order for Protection; or request an emergency expedited hearing.   

lease Note:  An Order for Protection (OFP) might be available in extreme situations, but an OFP will not 
permanently  change  custody.    You  need  to  use  the  motion  papers  for  requesting  a  permanent  change  of 
custody.  You can get help with Orders for Protection from the Court Administrator’s office or local domestic 
abuse advocacy programs. 

f you choose to request an emergency expedited hearing, you will need to draft your own court forms or seek 
help from a private attorney or other legal service provider, as there are no court forms available from court 
administration or on the public website. 

f  your  child  is  the  subject  of  a  child  in  need  of  protection  or  services  (CHIPS)  proceeding  or  certain 
delinquency proceedings, the Court may not be able to immediately decide your request to establish custody.

OTE:  The instructions which  follow  are  numbered  the same as the questions on the Responsive 

Notice of Motion and Motion form. 

.  Print  the  full  name  and  date  of  birth  of  each  child  for  whom  the  other  party  has  asked  to  change 

custody.  Print the date of the existing custody Order or Decree. 

.  Legal custody means which parent or parents have a say in the major decisions regarding the children’s 

life, including education, religious upbringing and medical treatment. 

Check box (a) if the other party wants to change legal custody and you want the court to deny the other 
party’s  request  to  change  legal  custody.    Check  box  (b)  if  you  want  legal  custody  of  your  children 
changed and check the box for joint legal custody or the box for sole legal custody.  If you checked the 
box for sole legal custody write in who should have sole legal custody. 
 

3.  Physical custody means who will be responsible for the routine daily care and control of the children. 
Check  box  (a)  if  the  other  party  wants  to  change  physical  custody  and  you  do  not  want  to  change 
physical custody.  Check box (b) if you want to change physical custody and then check the box for 
joint physical custody or sole physical custody.  If you checked the box for sole physical custody write 
in who should have sole physical custody.  

.  You do not need to write anything for this question.

physical custody. 

.  Check  box  6  only  if  you  have  been  ordered  to  pay  child  support,  you  stopped  paying  child  support 
because the children were living with you, and you want the court to forgive your child support for the 
time you were not paying it when the children were with you. 

.  You do not have to write anything for this question, but you should read and understand it. 

 

Read the Verification and Acknowledgements carefully.  By signing your name, you are telling the 
court that you are telling the truth and that you have a good faith reason for your requests.  If you 
are  not  telling  the  truth  or  if  you  are  misleading  the  court  or  if  you  are  serving  or  filing  this 
document for an improper purpose, the court can order you to pay money to the other party or 
impose other sanctions.

Print your name on the blank above Paragraph/Question #1. 

f  the  only  issue  in  this  case  is  legal  custody  (neither  you  nor  the  other  party  are  requesting  any 
changes to physical custody), then you only need to answer Questions 1-12 and 38-40.  If either party 
is requesting a change to physical custody, then answer all of the questions. 

ead  the  questions  on  the  Affidavit  carefully  and  answer  each  question  with  detailed,  specific 
information.  Attach all copies of day care, school, medical and other records and documents that help 
support the statements in your Affidavit.    In your  Affidavit  in Response to Motion to Change Custody, 
you will: 
a)  Write your response to the changes the other party is requesting and why you think the changes are 

not in the best interests of the children; 

b)  Explain to the court why you are asking for changes in custody, if any. 

 

Generally, you will not be allowed to expand upon your Affidavit at the first hearing.  If there is something 
that you want the judge to know, put it in writing in your Affidavit. 

uestions 17-37 will help the court determine the appropriate amount of child support, if applicable in your 
case.    If  you  want  an  estimate  of  how  much  child  support  may  be  ordered  by  the  court  if  a  change  in 
physical custody is granted, you can use a calculator created by the Department of Human Services, which 
is available on-line at: http://childsupportcalculator.dhs.state.mn.us/  
 

Step 3 
Complete Financial Affidavit for Child Support  
(If Either Party is Requesting Change to Physical Custody) 

f  you  or  the  other  party  are  asking  for  a  change  in  physical  custody,  you  must  fill  out  the  form  called 
"Financial Affidavit for Child Support." This form asks for your income information. The information you 
put  on  the  Financial  Affidavit  should  be  the  same  in  the  Affidavit  in  Response  to  Motion  to  Change 
Custody. The Financial Affidavit is required to be served on the other party and filed with the court at the 
same time you serve and file your motion papers. The Financial Affidavit has separate instructions that you 
should  read.  It  is  very  important  to  attach  to  the  Financial  Affidavit  any  proof  you  have  regarding  your 
income.  This  proof  may  include  the  last  3  months  of  pay  stubs,  income  tax  return,  or  other  documents. 
Make sure the copy of the Financial Affidavit you provide to the other party also has copies of your proof 
of income. 
 

Step 4 
Complete Confidential Information Forms 

Most documents filed with the court are considered public documents and are 
available to the public.  Certain information that is filed with the court may be 
considered confidential based on court rule and not available to the public.  To keep 
this information confidential and not available to the public, you must take certain 
steps that are described below.

The steps listed below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  Filers who are 
using eFS to submit their court documents must identify and designate their filings 
as required in Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 11.03 and 14.06.   

onfidential Information Form 11.1 

All social security numbers, employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers (also called 
“restricted identifiers”) must not be listed on papers you file with the court. This is to protect your privacy, 
the other parties and your children.   Only provide social security numbers, employer identification 
numbers, and financial account numbers when the court requires this information to be provided to the 
court.  For example, if you must provide the court with bank account numbers, or medical account 
numbers, do not include any account number in your document (your motion, supporting affidavit, etc.).  
Instead, you must use Form 11.1 to list these confidential numbers.  

f account numbers are not required to be provided to the court, and the numbers appear on documents that 
are considered available to the public, (such as medical invoices or credit account numbers on statements) 
you must remove the number on the document before filing the document with the court. 

over Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-public 
documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the time you file 
the documents with the court.  You must complete and file the “Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents 
Form 11.2 (also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public documents.  The most common 
non-public documents are called “financial source documents.”  Examples of financial source documents 
include: 

•  Paycheck stubs, employer statements, W-2 forms, or business income and business expenses 
•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers   

ou may also need to submit other documents that court rules identify as non-public documents, such as a 
medical record.  For example, a report from a doctor that provides a medical diagnosis or treatment plan for 
you or your child would qualify as a medical record.   

ou must use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing other non-public documents, such as medical records, 

with the court.  One Form 11.2 cover sheet can be used for submitting all non-public documents.   
  

The failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being rejected by 
court administration, being available to the public, stricken from the court record, and 
sanctions from the court. 

ee Rule 11 of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice for more information about how to file 

documents containing social security numbers, financial account numbers, “financial source documents” 
and other non-public documents.

If you cannot afford to pay the motion fee, you can ask for a fee waiver by completing the forms in the In 
Forma  Pauperis/IFP  packet  of  forms  (found  online  at  www.mncourts.gov/forms).  If  a  judge  does  not 
sign  the  fee  waiver  order,  then  you  must  pay  the  motion  fee  before  Court  Administration  can  process 
your forms.  
 

Step 10 
Appear in Court 

ou must go to  court on the date  set for  the hearing.  Plan to arrive 15 minutes before your court time.  
Bring your copies of all the papers you filed with the court.   Call the Court Administrator’s office before 
the hearing and ask if you should bring your witnesses and all of your evidence to the first hearing. Usually 
the  judge  will  not  listen  to  live  testimony  at  the  first  hearing.    If  either  party  requested  an  emergency 
hearing and claims that the child is in immediate danger, you may have to testify at the first hearing. The 
judge may set a second hearing for listening to testimony and reviewing your evidence.  

o  not  bring  children  to  the  first  hearing,  unless  the  judge’s  clerk  tells  you  to.  The  hearing  is  very 
formal.  You are expected to know and follow the court rules of procedure.  You should be respectful to the 
other party and to everyone in the courtroom.  Do not interrupt the judge or other party.  Try to stay calm, 
and avoid unnecessarily criticizing the other party.  Answer any questions from the judge honestly.  Direct 
all your comments to the judge, not the other party. 

fter the final hearing the judge will issue an order.  The judge may issue the order at the end of the hearing 

or may send a copy of the order to you in the mail.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
