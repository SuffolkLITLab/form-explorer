 General Information About Filing a  
Petition for Restoration of Firearm and Ammunition Rights (FIR202) 

he information contained in this document is not intended as legal advice but as a general 
guide to you to explain the legal process.  If you do not understand any of these procedures, 
talk to an attorney.  Court staff cannot give legal advice.    

inn. Stat. § 624.713, subd. 4 allows individuals to ask the court to restore the right to possess 

firearms and ammunition after commitment resulting from a judicial determination that the 
person is mentally ill, developmentally disabled, mentally ill and dangerous, or chemically 
dependent. 

What information do I need to complete the Petition?  

he judge will need information about any civil commitment cases that resulted in the loss of 

firearm and ammunition rights to determine to grant your petition. 

he judge may want details from the relevant civil commitment case(s). You may want to bring 
the following to the hearing: a copy of any adjudication/commitment order; a copy of any petition 
that  sought  to  have  you  so  adjudicated  or  committed;  and  a  copy  of  any  order  showing  your 
discharge from commitment or restoration of mental competency. 

f you are not sure if this applies to you, talk with an attorney.  

t is recommended that you get the following:  

1.  Register of Action: Request a copy of the Register of Action (ROA) for the case that 

resulted in the loss of the right to possess a firearm. If you were civilly commited under 
different cases, each of these commitments could have caused you to lose your right to 
possess a firearm.  Make sure to request and attach to your Petition a ROA for each Civil 
Commitment cases that caused you to lose your right to possess a firearm. 

f you have more than one Civil Commitment case in multiple counties and/or judicial 
districts and are unsure which case caused you to lose this right, you should talk to an 
attorney for legal advice.  

he ROA can be printed at a MN county courthouse through the Records Center or the 

Minnesota Public Access terminals. There is a court copy fee for the ROA.

2.  Background Check: Criminal background checks are available through the Minnesota 

Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

The BCA offers a Minnesota-only background check, but may not offer a national check.  
The FBI offers a national background check.   

ifferent judges may have different preferences regarding nationwide and Minnesota-
only background checks.  The more information you provide, the better informed the 
judge is to decide your Petiton.  

osts and Process:  It costs money to request a background check and takes time to 

complete.   

ou can get full details about the costs and process from the BCA and FBI websites.

OTICE: Even if the judge grants your Petition, you may still be prohibited from possessing 
firearms and ammunition under other applicable state or federal laws. We strongly encourage 
you to get legal advice and not assume you may lawfully possess a firearm even if your Petition 
is granted.  

Where should I file the Petition?  

here are a few issues to keep in mind when deciding where (County) to file your case and 

whether to file within your existing case or to start a new Civil case.  There may be a filing fee to 
file this Petition. Please consider the following issues to help decide where to file and in which 
case.  

ne Case with Civil Commitment: If you were civilly commited in only one case, you may 
choose to file this Petition in that case. Filing within that specific case will make sure that any 
order restoring your rights is available in that case and is communicated to state and federal 
justice partners who are responsible for determining your eligibility to possess firearms. There is 
no filing fee when you file into your Civil Commitment case. If you choose to open a new Civil 
case then you will pay the filing fee in that county.  

ultiple Cases: If you have civil commitments in different cases, each of these Civil 

Commitments could have caused you to lose your right to possess a firearm.  Make sure to list in 
your Petition all of the Civil Commitment cases that caused you to lose your right to possess a 
firearm.   
 

•  Cases in the same Judicial District – If all of your cases are in the same Judicial 

District, even if in different counties (for example, all the cases are in the 10th Judicial 
District but are in Anoka County and Washington County) then you may:

o  File one Petition into one of your cases in the county where that case is located.

Civil Commitment case numbers in the body of the Petition. There is no filing fee 
when filing into your existing Civil Commitment case. OR

live, as a new Civil case. Each Civil Commitment case number will need to be 
included in the body of the Petition. There is a filing fee to open a new Civil case.  
 

•  Cases in different Judicial Districts – If you have multiple cases in different judicial 

districts then you may:  
 

o  File a Petition within each judicial district in a Civil Commitment case that 

resulted in the loss of your firearm rights. There is no filing fee when filing into 
your existing Civil Commitment case. OR 
 

o  File one Petition in the county where one of the cases is located, or where you 

live, as a new Civil case. Each Civil Commitment case will need to be included in 
the body of the Petition. There is a filing fee to open a new Civil case.
