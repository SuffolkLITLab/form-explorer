APPENDIX A  

  

 
NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN TO THE PARTIES:   
 
I.    PAYMENTS  TO  PUBLIC  AGENCY.    According  to  Minnesota  Statutes,  section 
518A.50,  payments  ordered  for  maintenance  and  support  must  be  paid  to  the  Minnesota  child 
support payment center as long as the person entitled to receive the payments is receiving or has 
applied  for  public  assistance  or  has  applied  for  support  and  maintenance  collection  services. 
Parents  mail  payments  to:  P.O.  Box  64326,  St.  Paul,  MN  55164-0326.    Employers  mail 
payments to: P.O. Box 64306, St. Paul, MN 55164.  
  
II.    DEPRIVING  ANOTHER  OF  CUSTODIAL  OR  PARENTAL  RIGHTS  --  A 
 
FELONY.  A person may be charged with a felony who conceals a minor child or takes, obtains, 
retains, or fails to return a minor child from or to the child's parent (or person with custodial or 
parenting time rights), according to Minnesota Statutes, section 609.26.  A copy of that section is 
available from any court administrator.  
  
 
III.    NONSUPPORT  OF  A  SPOUSE  OR  CHILD  –  CRIMINAL  PENALTIES.    A 
person who fails to pay court ordered child support or maintenance may be charged with a crime, 
which may include misdemeanor, gross misdemeanor, or felony charges, according to Minnesota 
Statutes, section 609.375.  A copy of that section is available from any district court clerk.  
  
 
A. 

IV.  RULES OF SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, PARENTING TIME.  
Payment of support or spousal maintenance is to be as ordered, and the giving of gifts or 
making purchases of food, clothing, and the like will not fulfill the obligation.    
Payment of support must be made as it becomes due, and failure to secure or denial of 
parenting  time  is  NOT  an  excuse  for  nonpayment,  but  the  aggrieved  party  must  seek 
relief through a proper motion filed with the court.  
Nonpayment  of  support  is  not  grounds  to  deny  parenting  time.    The  party  entitled  to 
receive support may apply for support and collection services, file a contempt motion, or 
obtain a judgment as provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 548.091.  
The payment of support or spousal maintenance takes priority over payment of debts and 
other obligations.  
A party who accepts additional obligations of support does so with the full knowledge of 
the party's prior obligation under this proceeding.    
Child support or maintenance is based on annual income, and it is the responsibility of a 
person  with  seasonal  employment  to  budget  income  so  that  payments  are  made 
throughout the year as ordered.   
A Parental Guide to Marking Child-Focused Parenting Time Decisions is available from 
any court administrator.

F. 

H.        The  nonpayment  of  support  may  be  enforced  through  the  denial  of  student  grants; 
interception  of  state  and  federal  tax  refunds;  suspension  of  driver’s,  recreational,  and 
occupational  licenses;  referral  to  the  department  of  revenue  or  private  collection 
agencies;  seizure  of  assets,  including  bank  accounts  and  other  assets  held  by  financial 
institutions; reporting to credit bureaus; income withholding, and contempt proceedings; 
and other enforcement methods allowed by law.

J.  

The public authority may suspend or resume collection of the amount allocated for child 
care expenses if the conditions of Minnesota Statutes, section 518A.40, subdivision 4, are 
met.  
The public authority may remove or resume a medical support offset if the conditions of 
section 518A.41, subdivision 16, are met.  

   
 
V.  MODIFYING CHILD SUPPORT.  If either the obligor or obligee is laid off from 
employment or receives a pay reduction, child support may be modified, increased, or decreased. 
Any modification will only take effect when it is ordered by the court, and will only relate back 
to the time that a motion is filed.  Either the obligor or obligee may file a motion to modify child 
support,  and  may  request  the  public  agency  for  help.  UNTIL  A  MOTION  IS  FILED,  THE 
CHILD  SUPPORT  OBLIGATION  WILL  CONTINUE  AT  THE  CURRENT  LEVEL.    THE 
COURT IS NOT PERMITTED TO REDUCE SUPPORT RETROACTIVELY.

VI.    PARENTAL  RIGHTS  FROM  MINNESOTA  STATUTES,  SECTION  518.17,

religious training, police reports, and other important records and information about the 
minor  children.    Each  party  has  the  right  of  access  to  information  regarding  health  or 
dental insurance available to the minor children.  Presentation of a copy of this order to 
the  custodian  of  a  record  or  other  information  about  the  minor  children  constitutes 
sufficient  authorization  for  the  release  of  the  record  or  information  to  the  requesting 
party.  
Each party has the right to be informed by the other party as to the name and address of 
the school of attendance of the minor children. Each party has the right to be informed by 
school  officials  about  the  children's  welfare,  educational  progress  and  status,  and  to 
attend  school  and  parent  teacher  conferences.    The  school  is  not  required  to  hold  a 
separate conference for each party.  
Each party has the right to be notified by the other party of an accident or serious illness 
of  a  minor  child,  including  the  name  of  the  health  care  provider  and  the  place  of 
treatment.  
Each party has the right to be notified by the other party if the minor child is the victim of 
an  alleged  crime,  including  the  name  of  the  investigating  law  enforcement  officer  or 
agency.  There is no duty to notify if the party to be notified is the alleged perpetrator.  
Each  party  has  the  right  of  reasonable  access  and  telephone  contact  with  the  minor 
children.

address, telephone number, driver's license number, social security number, and name, address, 
and telephone number of the employer.  
  
 
IX.  COST OF LIVING INCREASE OF SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE.  Basic 
support and / or spousal maintenance may be adjusted every two years based upon a change in 
the  cost  of  living  (using  the  U.S.  Department  of  Labor,  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics,  consumer 
price index Mpls. St. Paul, for all urban consumers (CPI-U), unless otherwise specified in this 
order)  when  the  conditions  of  Minnesota  Statutes,  section  518A.75,  are  met.    Cost  of  living 
increases are compounded.  A copy of Minnesota Statutes, section 518A.75, and forms necessary 
to request or contest a cost of living increase are available from any court administrator.  
  
 
A. 

X.  JUDGMENTS FOR UNPAID SUPPORT.  
If a person fails to make a child support payment, the payment owed becomes a judgment 
against the person responsible to make the payment by operation of law on or after the 
date  the  payment  is  due,  and  the  person  entitled  to  receive  the  payment  or  the  public 
agency  may  obtain  entry  and  docketing  of  the  judgment  without  notice  to  the  person 
responsible to make the payment.   

  
B. 

The public authority is not responsible for calculating interest in any judgment for unpaid 
spousal  maintenance.  When  providing  services  in  IV-D  cases,  as  defined  by  Minnesota 
Statutes,  section  518A.26,  subdivision  10,  the  public  authority  will  only  collect  interest 
on spousal maintenance if spousal maintenance is reduced to a sum certain judgment.   

  
 
XI.  JUDGMENTS FOR UNPAID MAINTENANCE.  A judgment for unpaid spousal 
maintenance  may  be  entered  and  docketed  when  the  conditions  of  Minnesota  Statutes,  section 
548.091, are met.  A copy of that section is available from any court administrator.  
  
 
XII.    ATTORNEY  FEES  AND  COLLECTION  COSTS  FOR  ENFORCEMENT  OF 
CHILD  SUPPORT.    A  judgment  for  attorney  fees  and  other  collection  costs  incurred  in 
enforcing  a  child  support  order  will  be  entered  against  the  person  responsible  to  pay  support 
when the conditions of Minnesota Statutes, section 518A.735, are met.  A copy of that section 
and forms necessary to request or contest these attorney fees and collection costs are available 
from any court administrator.  
  
 
XIII.  PARENTING TIME EXPEDITOR PROCESS.  On request of either party or on 
its  own  motion,  the  court  may  appoint  a  parenting  time  expeditor  to  resolve  parenting  time 
disputes under Minnesota Statutes, section 518.1751.  A copy of that section and a description of 
the expeditor process is available from any court administrator.  
  
 
XIV.  PARENTING TIME REMEDIES AND PENALTIES.  Remedies and penalties 
for  wrongful  denial  of  parenting  time  are  available  under  Minnesota  Statutes,  section  518.175, 
subdivision 6.  These include compensatory parenting time; civil penalties; bond requirements; 
contempt; and reversal of custody.  A copy of that subdivision and forms for requesting relief are 
available from any court administrator.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
