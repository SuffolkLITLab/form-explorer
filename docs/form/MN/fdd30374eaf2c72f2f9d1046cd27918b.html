General Information About the Generic Civil Responsive Motion 
Packet 

he information contained in this document is not intended as legal advice but as a general guide to 
you to explain the legal process.  If you do not understand any of these procedures, talk to an attorney.  
Court staff cannot give legal advice. 

 generic responsive motion is a way to respond to the other party’s motion filed in a civil case that is already 
open.  In very simple terms, the responsive motion is where you state what you want the court to order.  Along 
with every motion, you need an affidavit.  The affidavit is where you state why the court should give you what 
you have asked for. 

ou may be able to use this packet IF: 

•  A civil case has already started and you have a case number; 
•  The other party has served you with a motion; 
•  You want to ask the court to deny the other party’s motion, and/or do something within the case; 

and 

•  The court does not publish a specific form for the request you want to make.   

MPORTANT: It is strongly recommended that you get legal advice. If you do not know what you should 
write in your responsive motion, or want the responsive motion reviewed by an attorney.  

Step 1 

Fill Out Responsive Notice of Motion and Motion (CIV702) 

ection A – The Caption 

he top part of the first page is where you will find the case caption.  It looks like this:

You should be able to find the information you need to fill out the caption on the other party’s motion that 
you received.  If the information is not found on the document, then you will need to look in your court 
file. 

•  Some limited case records can be viewed online at www.mncourts.gov/publicaccess. 
• 

If you cannot view your case online, you may need to go to the courthouse in the county where 
your case is located to view your court file. 

. At the top of the page, write in the following information: 

•  The county where the case is located; 
•  The judicial district number (each county is located in one of ten judicial districts); 
•  Your court file number (this usually starts with a two-digit number, followed by letters and 

numbers.  For example, 15-CV-17-0001); and 

•  The case type.  Look on other documents in your court file if you are not sure what the case type 

is. 

.  Write in the name of each plaintiff and the name of each defendant as it is found on the court 
document mentioned earlier.  If your name is incorrect in any way, you can add “aka” (Also Known As) 
and then your correct name.

3. After the word “TO,” print the name and address of each party except yourself.  If any of the other 
parties is represented by an attorney, then you should include that party’s attorney’s name and address.  
For example: “Jane Doe, attorney for Jay Vang, 111 Main St., St. Paul, MN 55102.” 

. Fill in this section (look on the other party’s motion to find the information).  The hearing for this 
responsive motion should be on the same day and at the same time as the other party’s motion, unless the 
court grants permission to use another date.

motion. 

.  Next, if you checked the box, then briefly summarize what the other party has asked for in their 

motion.  If you run out of room, you can continue your answer on another piece of paper (please do not 
write on the back or in the margins of your responsive motion).

Section E: The Caption 

Fill out the caption just like you did in Section 
A above. 

ection F: The Statement of Facts 

n the Affidavit in Support of Responsive Motion, you are supposed to write down facts that support the 
requests you made in your responsive motion.  It is where you explain why you are asking the court to do 
the things you asked for in the Responsive Notice of Motion and Motion. Later on, you will sign the 
Affidavit in Support of Responsive Motion under penalty of perjury.  This is like being under oath.  It 
means you should not write anything that you know is not true. 
 

. Write your name. 

0. Write down the information you want the court to know.  This section is your “statement of facts.”  If 

you run out of room, then add more paper.  Do not write on the back of the page or in the margins. 

f you want to include an attachment that supports a statement you make, then it is good practice to label 
your attachment something like “Attachment A” or “Exhibit 1.”  Then, next to the statement in your 
Affidavit that talks about the attachment, you can write something like “See Attachment A” or “See 
Exhibit 1.”  For example: “It cost $800 to fix my car.  See Exhibit 1.”  And Exhibit 1 would be the bill 
from the car repair shop.
