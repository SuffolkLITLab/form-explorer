General Information about Adult Adoption 

he information contained in this document is not intended as legal advice but as a general 
guide to explain the legal process.  If you do not understand any of these procedures, talk to 
an attorney.  Court staff cannot give legal advice. 

hat is Adult Adoption? 

An Adult Adoption is the adoption of a person who is 18 years old or older.  Minn. Stat. § 259.241 
(https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=259.241)  states  that  any  adult  person  may  be  adopted 
regardless of where they live.  A person who has been a Minnesota resident for one year or more 
may ask the court to adopt an adult by following the steps in these Instructions.  An adoption petition 
should be filed in the county where the petitioner (the person asking to adopt the adult) lives.     

o you have all the information you need to fill out the forms? 

The Petition for Adult Adoption form (ADO702) asks for the following information: 

•  For each petitioner: full name, address, age, and if married, the date and place of marriage; 
and for each adult adoptee: full name, address, date of birth, and state and county where 
born. 

•  The description and value of any real or personal property owned by each adult adoptee.  
•  You may use one petition for multiple adoptees, if the adoptees have the same biological 
parents.  If the adoptees do not have the same biological parent(s), you may need to file 
separate petitions.  

•  The county where the case will be filed.

14.  If the adult adoptee is not asking the court to change their name, check the first box that says 
“Adult adoptee is not asking to change their name.”   If the adult adoptee is asking the court to 
change their name as a part of the adoption, check the second box and fill in the adult adoptee’s

MPORTANT: Criminal History Check 

inn. Stat. § 259.11 requires the Court to determine whether any person asking to have their 
name changed has a criminal history in Minnesota or any other state. The court may conduct a 
search of national records through the Federal Bureau of Investigation by submitting a set of 
fingerprints and the required fee to the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.   

n order to do this, each adult adoptee included in the petition must complete a Criminal History 
Check Release form (ADO707).  A criminal history check will then be made on the adult 
adoptee.  If the adult adoptee has a criminal history, both the adult adoptee whose name is 
changed and the Court shall report the change within 10 days of receiving a copy of the 
order by mailing a copy of the order granting the adult adoption to:

federal jurisdiction, the adult adoptee shall serve the Felon Name Change Notice (ADO706) 
form regarding the Petition for Adult Adoption on the prosecuting authority that obtained the 
conviction.  If the conviction is from another state or federal jurisdiction, notice must also be 
served on the Minnesota Attorney General at:

roof of service must be filed with the court as part of the name change request 

(https://www.mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/CourtForms/SOP104_Current.pdf?ext=.pdf). 
The prosecuting authority has 30 days to object to the name change request.  

hat happens if the prosecutor or attorney general objects?  

The person asking for the name change can contest the objection by filing a motion with the 
court. The law requires the judicial officer to deny the name change request, unless the person 
asking for the name change can prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the request is: 

•  not based upon an intent to defraud or mislead;  
• 
•  will not cause injury to a person; and  

is made in good faith;

person asking for the name change.  

Read Minn. Stat. § 259.13, Subds.1-6 to see all the requirements in the law. The court does not 
have forms or instructions for a motion to contest the objection. You should get help from an 
attorney if you want to contest the objection of the prosecutor or attorney general.

Step 4 

Gather the Documents that Must Be Submitted with Your Petition 
for Adult Adoption 

 

 

You must give the following documents to the court when you file your Petition for Adult 
Adoption:  

 Original signed Petition for Adult Adoption; 
 A certified copy of the birth certificate of the adult to be adopted, which you can get 

from the Minnesota Department of Health 
(https://www.health.state.mn.us/people/vitalrecords/birth.html); 

 The original signed Consent of Adult to Adult Adoption for each adult being adopted; 

 The Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order for Judgment, and Judgment and 

and 

Decree of Adoption form. 

Depending on your situation, you may also need these additional documents: 

 Adoptee’s List of Assets; 
 Felon Name Change Notice; and 
 Criminal History Check Release. 

Step 5 

Make Copies of Documents and Forms 

ake copies of each of the documents and forms listed under Step 4. Each party to the case 

(yourself and the adult adoptee) will need a copy of the completed forms. Provide a copy to each 
party for their records (make sure to bring your copies with you to court on the day of your 
adoption hearing). You will file the originals of each document with Court Administrator as 
explained in Step 6.  
 

Step 6

•  The original signed Petition for Adult Adoption;  
•  The original signed Adult Adoption Consent;  
•  The Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order for Judgment, and Judgment and 

Decree of Adoption;  

If applicable, the Adoptee List of Assets; 

•  A certified copy of the birth certificate of the adult to be adopted; and 
• 
•  The Felon Name Change Notice; and 
•  The Criminal History Check Release.  

 

There is a filing fee due when you file.  You can find county court filing fee information at 
https://mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Court-Fees/District-Court-
Fees.aspx?cat=dissolution/custody&cookieCheck=true .  You can make checks payable to 
“District Court Administrator.”  

f you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, you can ask for a fee waiver by completing the forms in 
the In Forma Pauperis (“IFP”) packet of forms.  You can find the forms packet at 
https://www.mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=19&p=69 .  If a judge does not fully grant the fee 
waiver, then you must pay the filing fee before Court Administration can process your forms. 

nce the petition has been filed, you will get a Notice of Case Filing. Once you file all of the 
required documents, the court will send you a Notice of Hearing telling you about your hearing 
date and how the hearing will be conducted (remotely or in person).  
 

Step 7 

Appear in Court 

lan to arrive at least 15 minutes before your scheduled court hearing. All parties on the petition 

(Petitioner and adult adoptee) should attend the hearing.  If your hearing is going to be held 
remotely, see the “Remote Hearings” Help Topic online at https://mncourts.gov/Remote-
Hearings.aspx .   

he hearing is very formal. You are expected to know and follow the court rules of procedure. 
You should be respectful to the other party and to everyone in the courtroom. Do not interrupt 
the judge or other party. Answer any questions from the judge honestly. Direct all your 
comments to the judge, not the other parties who may be present.  

ourts operate by rules and laws that may not necessarily make sense to you. If you choose to 
represent yourself, the court rules say that you are responsible for knowing the law and rules, 
just like an attorney. The judge cannot give you special consideration or help because you are 
not a lawyer.

At the hearing, the judicial officer (Judge or Referee) will review your Petition for Adult 
Adoption and ask you many of the same questions that are in the Petition to be certain that your 
answers have not changed. At the end of the hearing the judge will either issue a decision or will 
take the matter under advisement and issue a decision at a later time.  

           

Step 8 

After the Hearing 

Following the hearing, the judge will issue a written order granting or denying the adoption 
petition.  If the petition is granted, the judge will also issue an adoption decree.  

ou will need to get a certified copy of the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Adoption 

Decree from Court Administration so the adult adoptee can obtain a new birth certificate, if 
desired. Instructions for getting a new birth certificate are located on the website for the 
Department of Health at http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/chs/osr/birth.html .

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
