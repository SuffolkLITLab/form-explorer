Introduction 

This booklet is for self-represented parties preparing for a hearing in Conciliation  Court,  

which is also sometimes called Small Claims Court. It will explain: 

•  How to prepare for and participate in the hearing; 

•  Options for settlement; and 

• 

Information about appeals.  

For information on how to file a Conciliation  Court claim,  visit the Conciliation  Court 

Help Topic (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Conciliation-Court.aspx). For information on how to 

enforce a judgment from Conciliation  Court, visit the Judgments Help Topic 

(mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Judgments.aspx). 

Conciliation  Court is a specialty court where people can have their cases heard without 

complicated legal procedures. Generally, claims  of $15,000  or less can be filed in Conciliation 

Court. If you want to file a claim  that is for more than $15,000,  you must start a civil  case in 

District  Court. You cannot split your claim into multiple smaller claims  to get around the limit 

and file in Conciliation  Court. Review the Civil  Actions Help Topic (mncourts.gov/Help-

Topics/Civil-Actions.aspx) for more information on civil  cases in District  Court. 

Conciliation  Court hearings do not involve a jury. Instead, a Judicial Officer (Judge or  

Referee) decides  the outcome of the case. In Conciliation  Court, witnesses and evidence are 

presented at the hearing. Bringing  a case in Conciliation  Court can be less expensive and 

simpler than filing in District  Court. 

In addition to reading this booklet, we encourage you to: 

•  Review the Conciliation Court Help Topic (mncourts.gov/Help-

Topics/Conciliation-Court.aspx). 

•  Review the Conciliation Court Rules (revisor.mn.gov/index/GP/).   

•  Watch a video of a Conciliation Court trial (mncourts.gov/Help-

Topics/Conciliation-Court.aspx;  on the Tools & Resources tab).  

•  Contact a Self-Help Center (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Self-Help-Centers.aspx). 

•  Get advice from a lawyer (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx) about 

your case.

Communicating with Court Staff and Judicial Officers 

It is important that you communicate with court staff and judicial officers appropriately.   

Court staff are ready to help you in whatever way they can.  Their role is to provide you with 

information, not legal advice.  For specific information about what court staff can and cannot 

do, visit the What Court Staff Can and Cannot Do for You Help Topic  (mncourts.gov/Help-

Topics/What-Staff-Can-Do.aspx). 

“Ex parte” is a Latin phrase meaning “on one side only; by or for one party.” An ex  

parte communication  is when a party to a case, or someone involved with a party, talks or 

writes to or otherwise communicates directly with the judicial  officer about the issues in the 

case without the other parties’ knowledge.  Judicial officers cannot consider ex parte 

communications in deciding a case unless expressly allowed by law. This helps judicial  officers 

decide cases fairly since their decisions are based only on the evidence and arguments 

presented to the court and the applicable law. The rule ensures that the court process is fair 

and that all parties have the same information as the judicial  officer who will be deciding the 

Please be respectful when communicating  with court staff and judicial  officers. 

case.  

Settlement 

Many cases settle before the hearing.  “Settle” means that the parties involved reach an 

agreement. You may be able to settle by communicating  directly with the other party or 

through a process called “mediation.” Mediation is where a neutral person, called a mediator, 

helps you and the other side try to settle your dispute. The mediator does not decide the case, 

but helps you talk with the other side and try to come to a mutual agreement. Review the 

Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)/Mediation Help Topic  (mncourts.gov/Help-

Topics/AlternativeDisputeResolution.aspx) for more information. 

A settlement allows the parties to find creative solutions that fit their needs and allows  

them to have a “known” result. Going to trial  means the Judicial  Officer decides the outcome 

instead of the parties.  

If you and the other party reach an agreement before the day of the hearing, call  court 

administration  in the county where your case is filed right away to ask about next steps.  You

Page 3 of 9 

will likely need to confirm in writing that you and the other party have agreed to settle.  

Settlement forms can be found on the Conciliation/Small  Claims Court Forms page 

(mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=10).  

If you and the other party need more time to work out the details of your agreement, 

you can call  court administration  to see if the case can be postponed. The court may reschedule 

your hearing to a later date, or they may require you and the other party to appear for your 

original  hearing date and explain the agreement.  

Review the Settle Out of Court Help Topic (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Settle-Out-of- 

Court.aspx) for more information. 

Arranging for Witnesses 

You can have witnesses at your Conciliation  Court hearing.  If you want to have  

witnesses, you are responsible for making sure they appear for the hearing.  Plan ahead. The 

Judicial  Officer will not reschedule the hearing to let you arrange for witnesses you could have 

contacted earlier. You should contact your witnesses as soon as the court schedules the hearing 

A witness can be you, someone else who has first-hand knowledge about your claim,  or  

an “expert witness.” An expert witness is someone with scientific, technical, or other special 

knowledge about a certain topic (for example, a roofing contractor, medical doctor, engineer, 

date.    

chemist, etc.). 

If your witness agrees to appear for your hearing, you do not need a subpoena. If a 

witness will not agree to appear for your hearing, you may need to use a subpoena.  A 

subpoena is a court order telling someone to appear in court and/or provide documents.  If you 

need to subpoena a witness, do so as soon as possible.   

You can request a subpoena from court administration  in the county where your case is 

filed. To make the request, you can visit the courthouse in person or make the request in 

writing.  There will  be a small fee for each subpoena. Court administration  will prepare the 

subpoena.   Next, you will need to arrange for someone else (not you) who is 18 years or older to 

serve the subpoena on the witness, along with the witness fee. A subpoena must be served 

before the trial date. You should give the witness a “reasonable” amount of time to prepare for

the hearing and/or to produce the documents listed on the subpoena.   

As explained on the subpoena form, if you subpoena a witness, you will  need to pay that 

witness $20  per day, plus mileage, if applicable. The fee for mileage is set by law and is stated in 

Minn. Stat. § 357.22  (revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/357.22).   

Witness fees and mileage apply only to witnesses who are subpoenaed. To put it simply: 

•  SUBPOENA: You DO have to pay witness fees and mileage. 

•  NO SUBPOENA: You DO NOT have to pay witness fees and mileage. 

If you cannot afford to pay the subpoena fees, including the witness fees, you can ask  

the court for a fee waiver (also called “In Forma Pauperis”).  You can find more information 

about fee waivers, including  the forms to complete and file, on the Fee Waiver Help Topic 

(mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Fee-Waiver-IFP.aspx). 

For more information about subpoenas and witness fees, review the Subpoenas Help 

Topic (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Subpoenas.aspx) and Rule 45  of the Minnesota Rules of Civil 

Before your hearing, organize the evidence that supports your claim or your side of the  

Procedure (revisor.mn.gov/court_rules/cp/id/45/). 

Preparing Evidence 

story.  Your evidence may include: 

•  Your testimony; 

•  Witness testimony; 

•  Communication between you and the other party such as emails, letters, etc.; 

•  Photos, written agreements, contracts, or other documents (for example, a 

lease if the case involves a landlord/tenant issue); 

•  Itemized bills, canceled checks, receipts or invoices, proof of payment, 

•  Printed or electronic evidence from your computer or cell phone; and 

•  Audio/visual evidence (be sure to ask the court what format is  required for 

damaged items, etc.; 

this type of evidence). 

   Evidence must be presented during the hearing.  If your hearing is in-person, you 

should have the original  document or object and at least 3 copies of any documents. One copy

is for the Judicial Officer, one copy is for you, and one copy is for the other party (more copies 

will be needed if there are more parties).  If you have a remote hearing and have an order or 

other instructions from the court about how to handle exhibits, follow those instructions.  You 

can find other helpful information on remote hearings on the Remote Hearings Help Topic 

(mncourts.gov/Remote-Hearings.aspx).   

Rescheduling the Hearing, if needed 

If you will not be able to appear for your scheduled hearing, you can ask the court to  

postpone or reschedule your hearing.  You must have  a good reason or the court may not agree 

to change your date.  If you need to reschedule your hearing, you must contact court 

administration  in writing  at least 5 business days before your hearing date.  If your hearing is 

rescheduled, court administration will  send you and the other party a notice with the new 

hearing date.   

Courtroom Behavior, including Remote Hearings 

You do not have to buy new clothing  for court, but remember it is a formal place and  

You want to be conservative and respectful in dress and behavior. Do not bring children to 

court.  If your hearing is remote, make sure there are no distractions during your hearing. You 

can find more tips for remote hearings on the Remote Hearings Help Topic 

(mncourts.gov/Remote-Hearings.aspx). 

Certain behaviors are not allowed in a courtroom, including  a virtual  courtroom,  

because they are noisy, distracting, or disrespectful. You should not chew gum, eat, sleep, listen 

to earphones, use a cell  phone, carry a weapon, or a use a camera, including  cell phone 

cameras (unless otherwise allowed). Some courts do not allow cell phones in the courtroom, 

even if they are turned off. 

Day of the Hearing 

    Be on time for your hearing and make sure you know in advance if it is in-person or 

remote.  If in-person, allow yourself extra time in case you run into bad traffic or weather, and 

to allow time to find parking and go through security when you enter the courthouse. If your 

hearing is virtual, make sure you test your technology ahead of time and allow plenty of time to 

log in.

If you are not in the courtroom (in-person or virtual courtroom) when the court clerk 

calls  your case, you may lose the case by “default” (by not appearing).  If you have an 

emergency or are delayed, call  court administration  and let them know.  Even if you call,  the 

court may hold the hearing without you, and you could lose by default.   

   If your hearing is in-person, find your courtroom, then look for the daily court calendar 

which is usually posted outside the courtroom.  Look for your name or case on the calendar. If 

your case is not listed or if there is no calendar posted, ask the court clerk in the courtroom for 

help.  You may need to check in with the court clerk in the courtroom even if your case or name 

is listed on a calendar. 

The Hearing 

The plaintiff, defendant, and any other witnesses who will  testify will  take an  oath to tell 

the truth. The plaintiff (the person who filed the claim) will go first at the hearing. After the 

plaintiff’s testimony, where they tell their side of the story, the Judicial  Officer and the 

defendant may ask  them questions about the case.  If the plaintiff has witnesses, they will 

testify next. The  Judicial Officer and defendant may ask them questions, too.  After the plaintiff 

has presented their evidence, it will be the defendant’s turn to explain their side of the story. 

The defendant can show their evidence, and witnesses can testify on their behalf.  The plaintiff 

and the  Judicial  Officer can ask the defendant and the defendant’s witnesses questions. It is up 

to the plaintiff to prove their claim,  and the defendant must prove their counterclaim, if any.  

This is called having the burden of proof.   

During the hearing, you should listen carefully to the Judicial  Officer and the other party.  

Ask the Judicial Officer for permission to speak. You should talk directly to the Judicial  Officer, 

not to the other party. When you talk to the Judicial  Officer, start by saying, “Your Honor.” 

Speak loudly and clearly.  Avoid arguing with or interrupting another person and try to control 

your emotions.  Try to tell your side of the story calmly, clearly,  and concisely.  If you disagree 

with something said by the other party, ask the Judicial  Officer if you may respond.  

If the plaintiff, the person who filed the claim,  does not appear when the hearing starts,

the Judicial Officer will  likely dismiss the case.  But if the defendant, the person against whom 

the claim  is filed, has filed a counterclaim  and they appear for the hearing, the court may enter 

a default judgment against the plaintiff. 

If the defendant does not appear for the hearing, but the plaintiff does appear, the  

Judicial  Officer may enter a default judgment against the defendant.  

   If neither the plaintiff nor the defendant appears for the hearing, the case will  be 

dismissed.  A case can be dismissed with or without prejudice.  If a case is dismissed without 

prejudice, it means that the claim  can be re-filed.  If a case is dismissed with prejudice, it means 

that the case cannot be re-filed. 

Decision 

If all parties appear for the hearing, the Judicial  Officer will listen to  the testimony and  

evidence presented. They will  decide the outcome of the case.  In a Conciliation  Court case, the 

Judicial  Officer may “rule from the bench,” which means they decide the case at the end of the 

hearing.  If they do not rule from the bench, they will issue a written decision, called an order, 

after the hearing.   

If you win the case and are awarded a money judgment against the other party, the  

judgment will  not be effective until 20  days after the order is mailed to the parties.  This is 

called a “stay” of the judgment and allows the parties time to appeal.

jury).   

   If you had a hearing but are not satisfied with the Judicial  Officer’s decision, you may 

be able to appeal to the District  Court.  This means that you are moving the case to a higher 

court and starting over from the beginning.  In District  Court, you can ask for the case to be 

decided by either a judge or a jury (there are more fees if you would like your case decided by a 

Appeals are more complicated. You are encouraged to get legal advice about an appeal 

or consider hiring a lawyer.  You can find information about free legal advice as well resources 

for finding a lawyer on the Find a Lawyer Help Topic on the MN Judicial  Branch website 

(mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx).

Page 8 of 9 

against you and in favor of the other party, you may be able to open the case again and have 

another hearing if you have a good reason for not being at the hearing. To request that the 

case be reopened and have another hearing, you need to complete and file a Request to Vacate 

(Cancel) Order for Judgment and Grant a New Trial.  This must be filed within the 20-day stay 

period, and you must show that:  

•  You were not given proper notice of the hearing;  

•  You were mistaken about the time of the hearing; or  

•  You missed the hearing for some other valid reason.  

The court may grant your request to have another hearing, or they may deny your 

request.  If the court grants your request, they will schedule another hearing. You will need to 

appear for the hearing (trial).   

   If the court denies your request, you may file a Demand for Limited Removal to District 

Court.  This is a limited removal, which means that the District  Court Judicial  Officer will only 

decide if  the default judgment should be vacated and a new hearing scheduled.  If your limited 

removal is granted, you will go back to Conciliation  Court for your hearing.

Court (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Conciliation-Court.aspx) and Appeals Help Topics

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
