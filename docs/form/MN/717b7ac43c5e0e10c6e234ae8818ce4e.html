STEP 4 
FILL OUT THE “COVER SHEET FOR NON-PUBLIC DOCUMENTS” FORM 11.2.  
FILL OUT “CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION” FORM 11.1 WHEN NECESSARY. 

Most documents filed with the court are considered public documents and 
available to the public. Certain information that is filed with the court may 
be considered confidential based on court rule and not available to the 
public.  To keep this information confidential and not available to the public, 
you must take certain steps described below. 

The steps listed below are for filers who are filing paper documents.  Filers 
who are using eFS to submit their court documents must identify and 
designate their filings as required in Minn. Gen. R. Prac. 11.03 and 14.06.   

onfidential Information Form 11.1 

All social security numbers, employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers 
(also called “restricted identifiers”) must not be listed on papers you file with the court. This is to 
protect your privacy, the other parties and your children.   Only provide social security numbers, 
employer identification numbers, and financial account numbers when the court requires this 
information to be provided to the court.  For example, if you must provide the court with bank 
account numbers, or medical account numbers, do not include any account number in your 
document (your motion, supporting affidavit, etc.).  Instead, you must use Form 11.1 to list these 
confidential numbers.  

If account numbers are not required to be provided to the court, and the numbers appear on 
documents that are considered available to the public, (such as medical invoices or credit account 
numbers on statements) you must remove the number on the document before filing the 
document with the court. 

Cover Sheet for Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 

Most documents filed with the court are public.  However, some documents are considered non-
public documents based on court rules.  You must identify these documents as non-public at the 
time  you file the documents with the court.   You  must complete and  file  the  “Cover  Sheet for 
Non-Public Documents Form 11.2 (also called Form 11.2 cover sheet) when you file non-public 
documents.  The most common non-public documents are called “financial source documents.”  
Examples of financial source documents include: 

•  Paycheck  stubs,  employer  statements,  W-2  forms,  or  business  income  and  business

expenses 

•  Copies of your tax returns and schedules 
•  Bank statements 
•  Credit card statements 
•  Check registers

ou may also need to submit other documents that court rules identify as non-public documents, 
such as a medical record.  For example, a report from a doctor that provides a medical diagnosis 
or treatment plan for you or your child would qualify as a medical record.   

You must use the Form 11.2 cover sheet when filing other non-public documents, such as 
medical records, with the court.  One Form 11.2 cover sheet can be used for submitting all non-
public documents.    

 The failure to use Form 11.2 or Form 11.1 may result in your document being 

rejected by court administration, being available to the public, stricken from the 
court record, and sanctions from the court. 

See Rule 11 of the Minnesota General Rules of Practice for more information about how to file 
documents containing social security numbers, financial account numbers, “financial source 
documents” and other non-public documents.   

Form 11.1 and Form 11.2 can be found at www.mncourts.gov/forms under the court forms 
category of “Confidential Information” and is court form number CON111 and CON112. 

STEP 5 
MAKE COPIES OF THE FORMS 

fter  the forms are  completely filled  out, make  three copies of the motion and three  copies of 
your “Affidavit in Support of Responsive Motion to Stop Cost-of-Living Adjustment,” and three 
copies of any attachments.  Keep one copy of each form and all attachments for yourself (be sure 
to bring your copies with you to court on the day of your hearing). 
 

STEP 6 
HAVE COPIES OF THE DOCUMENTS SERVED  
ON THE OTHER PARTY AND COUNTY ATTORNEY’S OFFICE 

ou must arrange for the other party and the county attorney’s office to receive complete copies 
of all documents you have prepared for the hearing.  This is called “service of process.”  A copy 
of the motion, affidavit, and any attachments must be served upon all parties, either personally or 
by mail.  If the other party is represented by an attorney, the documents must be served on the 
attorney instead of the party. 

ersonal service:  documents are hand-delivered to the other party personally or by leaving the 
documents  at  the  other  party’s  place  of  residence  with  some  person  who  is  of  suitable  age  or 
discretion  who  also  lives  at  the  same  residence.    Documents  must  be  hand-delivered  upon  the 
other party (or his/her attorney if  there  is  one) and the  county  attorney’s  office  at least  7 days 
before the hearing date.

Mail service:  documents are mailed by first class U.S. mail to the other party at least 10 days 
before the hearing date.   

f you are raising new issues in your response, the timing deadlines are different: 

•  For personal service, 14 days before the hearing date; and 
•  For service by mail, 17 days before the hearing date. 

If your documents are not timely served upon the other party (or his/her attorney) or the 
county attorney’s office, your motion may not be heard by the court. 

YOU  CANNOT  HAND  DELIVER  OR  MAIL  THE  DOCUMENTS 
YOURSELF.  YOU MUST HAVE SOMEONE ELSE OVER THE AGE OF 
18 WHO IS NOT A PARTY  TO THE CASE HAND  DELIVER OR MAIL 
THE DOCUMENTS FOR YOU. 

OTE! 

  N

STEP 7 
COMPLETE THE "AFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE” FORM 

he  person  who  hand  delivers  or  mails  the  documents  must  fill  out  an  “Affidavit  of  Service” 

form for each party served.   

he server must sign the “Affidavit of Service” under penalty of perjury.  Perjury is the crime of 

intentionally lying or misrepresenting the truth. 
 

STEP 8 
FILE THE FORMS WITH COURT ADMINISTRATION 
AND PAY ANY REQUIRED COURT FEE 

ile the documents with court administration in the county where your case is located as soon as 
practical but no later than 7 days before the scheduled hearing (or, if raising new issues, 14 days 
before the hearing).  
•  The “Response to Notice of Motion and Motion to Stop Cost-of-Living Adjustment” 
•  The “Affidavit in Support of Responsive Motion to Stop Cost-of-Living Adjustment” 
•  The “Affidavit of Service.” 

onfidential Form 11.2 

You must file  copies  of  all supporting documents (such  as pay stubs, tax  returns,  or  any other 
document  that  contains  confidential  information)  and  attach  one  Form  11.2  to  supporting 
documents.  Be certain to remove confidential numbers that appear on any other document not 
under cover of Form 11.2.   

OTE:  If you fail to use the Form 11.2 cover sheet to protect confidential information in your 
supporting documents, the court may order you to pay additional court costs and other charges as 
a penalty for failing to follow the court rules.

ou must be prepared to pay any court fee, if applicable, at the time of filing.  If you did not pay 
an initial filing fee when this case  first began,  you will now need to pay the filing fee.   If  you 
cannot  afford  to  pay  the  fee,  you  may  ask  a  child  support  magistrate  or  judge  for  an  order 
waiving the fee.  You will need to fill out an In Forma Pauperis application (available from court 
administration  or  the  court  website  at  http://www.mncourts.gov/GetForms.aspx?c=19&p=69)  
and  file  it  with  court  administration.    Your  application  will  be  reviewed  by  a  child  support 
magistrate or judge  who  will  decide  whether  you must pay the fee.   If  the magistrate or judge 
does not sign an order that waives the fee, you must be prepared to pay the fee. 

STEP 9

Cost-of-Living Adjustment, your responsive motion, and all of your supporting papers.
