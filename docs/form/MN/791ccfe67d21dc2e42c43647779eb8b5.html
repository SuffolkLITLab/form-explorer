costs.

APPENDIX A

II.  DEPRIVING ANOTHER OF CUSTODIAL OR PARENTAL RIGHTS -- A 

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN TO THE PARTIES:   
  
 
I.  PAYMENTS TO PUBLIC AGENCY. According to Minnesota Statutes, section 
518A.50, payments ordered for maintenance and support must be paid to the Minnesota child 
support payment center as long as the person entitled to receive the payments is receiving or 
has applied for public assistance or has applied for support and maintenance collection services. 
Parents mail payments to: P.O. Box 64326, St. Paul, MN 55164-0326.  Employers mail 
payments to: P.O. Box 64306, St. Paul, MN 55164.  
  
 
FELONY. A person may be charged with a felony who conceals a minor child or takes, 
obtains, retains, or fails to return a minor child from or to the child's parent (or person with 
custodial or parenting time rights), according to Minnesota Statutes, section 609.26. A copy of 
that section is available from any court administrator.  
  
 
person who fails to pay court-ordered child support or maintenance may be charged with a 
crime, which may include misdemeanor, gross misdemeanor, or felony charges, according to 
Minnesota Statutes, section 609.375. A copy of that section is available from any district court 
clerk.  
  
 
A.  

III.  NONSUPPORT OF A SPOUSE OR CHILD – CRIMINAL PENALTIES. A 

IV.  RULES OF SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, PARENTING TIME.  
Payment of support or spousal maintenance is to be as ordered, and the giving of gifts or 
making purchases of food, clothing, and the like will not fulfill the obligation. 
Payment of support must be made as it becomes due, and failure to secure or denial of 
parenting time is NOT an excuse for nonpayment, but the aggrieved party must seek 
relief through a proper motion filed with the court.  
Nonpayment of support is not grounds to deny parenting time. The party entitled to 
receive support may apply for support and collection services, file a contempt motion, 
or obtain a judgment as provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 548.091.  
The payment of support or spousal maintenance takes priority over payment of debts 
and other obligations.  
A party who accepts additional obligations of support does so with the full knowledge 
of the party's prior obligation under this proceeding.    
Child support or maintenance is based on annual income, and it is the responsibility of a 
person with seasonal employment to budget income so that payments are made 
throughout the year as ordered.  
A Parental Guide to Making Child-Focused Parenting Time Decisions is available from 
any court administrator.

B.  

E.  

F.  

H.        The nonpayment of support may be enforced through the denial of student grants; 

interception of state and federal tax refunds; suspension of driver’s, recreational, and 
occupational licenses; referral to the department of revenue or private collection

agencies; seizure of assets, including bank accounts and other assets held by financial 
institutions; reporting to credit bureaus; income withholding, and contempt proceedings; 
and other enforcement methods allowed by law.   
The public authority may suspend or resume collection of the amount allocated for child 
care expenses if the conditions of Minnesota Statutes, section 518A.40, subdivision 4, 
are met.  
The public authority may remove or resume a medical support offset if the conditions of 
section 518A.41, subdivision 16, are met.  

I.  

J.  

V.  MODIFYING CHILD SUPPORT. If either the obligor or obligee is laid off from 

  
 
employment or receives a pay reduction, child support may be modified, increased, or 
decreased. Any modification will only take effect when it is ordered by the court, and will only 
relate back to the time that a motion is filed. Either the obligor or obligee may file a motion to 
modify child support, and may request the public agency for help. UNTIL A MOTION IS 
FILED, THE CHILD SUPPORT OBLIGATION WILL CONTINUE AT THE CURRENT 
LEVEL. THE COURT IS NOT PERMITTED TO REDUCE SUPPORT RETROACTIVELY.  
  
 
SUBDIVISION 3. UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BY THE COURT:  
A.     Each party has the right of access to, and to receive copies of, school, medical, dental, 

VI.  PARENTAL RIGHTS FROM MINNESOTA STATUTES, SECTION 518.17, 

religious training, police reports, and other important records and information about the 
minor children. Each party has the right of access to information regarding health or 
dental insurance available to the minor children. Presentation of a copy of this order to 
the custodian of a record or other information about the minor children constitutes 
sufficient authorization for the release of the record or information to the requesting 
party.  
Each party has the right to be informed by the other party as to the name and address of 
the school of attendance of the minor children. Each party has the right to be informed 
by school officials about the children's welfare, educational progress and status, and to 
attend school and parent teacher conferences. The school is not required to hold a 
separate conference for each party.  
Each party has the right to be notified by the other party of an accident or serious illness 
of a minor child, including the name of the health care provider and the place of 
treatment.  
Each party has the right to be notified by the other party if the minor child is the victim 
of an alleged crime, including the name of the investigating law enforcement officer or 
agency. There is no duty to notify if the party to be notified is the alleged perpetrator.  

B.  

C.  

D.  

E.        Each party has the right of reasonable access and telephone contact with the minor 

children.  
  
VII.  WAGE AND INCOME DEDUCTION OF SUPPORT AND 

 
MAINTENANCE. Child support and / or spousal maintenance may be withheld from income,

if applicable, of the following information within ten days of any change: residential and 
mailing address, telephone number, driver's license number, social security number, and name, 
address, and telephone number of the employer.  
  
 
support and / or spousal maintenance may be adjusted every two years based upon a change in 
the cost of living (using the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, consumer 
price index Mpls. St. Paul, for all urban consumers (CPI-U), unless otherwise specified in this 
order) when the conditions of Minnesota Statutes, section 518A.75, are met. Cost of living 
increases are compounded. A copy of Minnesota Statutes, section 518A.75, and forms 
necessary to request or contest a cost of living increase are available from any court 
administrator.  
  
 
support payment, the payment owed becomes a judgment against the person responsible to 
make the payment by operation of law on or after the date the payment is due, and the person 
entitled to receive the payment or the public agency may obtain entry and docketing of the 
judgment without notice to the person responsible to make the payment.  
  
 
A. 

XI.  JUDGMENTS FOR UNPAID MAINTENANCE.  
A judgment for unpaid spousal maintenance may be entered and docketed when the 
conditions of Minnesota Statutes, section 548.091, are met. A copy of that section is 
available from any court administrator.

B.  

The public authority is not responsible for calculating interest in any judgment for 
unpaid spousal maintenance. When providing services in IV-D cases, as defined by

collect interest on spousal maintenance if spousal maintenance is reduced to a sum 
certain judgment.   

  
 
XII.  ATTORNEY FEES AND COLLECTION COSTS FOR ENFORCEMENT 
OF CHILD SUPPORT. A judgment for attorney fees and other collection costs incurred in 
enforcing a child support order will be entered against the person responsible to pay support

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
