related to juries. 

This booklet is for parties representing themselves and preparing for trial or an evidentiary 

hearing in Family Court). Trials are complicated, but this booklet is meant to make them more 

Family Court trials and evidentiary hearings generally do not involve a jury. Instead, the 

judicial  officer decides what facts are proven and issues an order. This booklet does not cover issues 

In addition to reading this booklet, you are encouraged to: 

• Watch a trial. Most trials  are open to the public. 

• Get advice from a lawyer. You can find information about free legal advice clinics, 

hiring a lawyer, and other options for legal advice on our Find a Lawyer Help Topic 

(mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Find-a-Lawyer.aspx). 

• Go to a law library (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Law-Libraries). 

• Contact a Self Help Center (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Self-Help-Centers.aspx). 

Communicating with Court Staff and Judicial Officers 

It is important that you communicate with court staff and judicial officers appropriately.  Court 

staff are ready to help you in whatever way they can.  Their role is to provide you with information, 

not legal advice.  For specific information about what court staff can and cannot do, visit the What 

Court Staff Can and Cannot Do for You Help Topic (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/What-Staff-Can-

Do.aspx). 

“Ex parte” is a Latin phrase meaning “on one side only; by or for one party.” An ex 

parte communication  is when a party to a case, or someone involved with a party, talks or writes to 

or otherwise communicates directly with the judicial officer about the issues in the case without the 

other parties’ knowledge.  Judicial  officers cannot consider ex parte communications  in deciding a 

case unless expressly allowed by law. This helps judicial officers decide cases fairly since their 

decisions are based only on the evidence and arguments presented to the court and the applicable 

law. The rule ensures that the court process is fair and that all  parties have the same information as 

the judicial officer who will  be deciding the case.  

Please be respectful when communicating  with court staff and judicial  officers.

Phases of a Family Court Case 

While there is really no such thing as a “typical”  case, many family court cases will include the 

phases listed below. This booklet will  cover only the Pretrial phase and the Trial  phase in detail. 

Many other hearings may happen before the trial  or instead of a trial. A trial  is not the same as a 

motion hearing. This booklet does not explain what happens at motion hearings. Carefully read all 

orders and letters from the court to understand what is expected at each hearing. If you have 

questions, contact a Self-Help Center (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Self-Help-Centers.aspx). 

• 

Initial phase: In this phase, the petitioner serves paperwork (often, a “Summons” and a 

“Petition”) to start the court case, and the other party (called the “respondent”) serves a 

response ("Answer and Counterpetition") on the petitioner. The Petition states what the 

petitioner is asking the court to order. The respondent uses the Answer and 

Counterpetition to respond to the petitioner’s request and state what they are asking the 

court to order. When a family court case is filed, it is generally scheduled for an Initial  Case 

Management Conference (“ICMC”). This is an informal meeting with the judicial  officer 

meant to help the parties set the case on a path toward resolution. In most cases, the 

parties will be offered to participate  in a settlement process called Early  Neutral Evaluation 

(mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/ENE-ECM.aspx). 

•  Discovery/Evaluation  phase: During this phase, the parties exchange information and may 

participate in different types of evaluations. The exchange of information (“discovery”) can 

be done informally  (for example, through email requests) or formally through 

interrogatories, requests for production of documents, depositions, and requests for 

admission. Other processes, such as custody evaluations, financial evaluations, chemical 

dependency evaluations, or psychological  evaluations may be ordered to help gather 

information. 

•  Pretrial phase: In this phase, the parties start getting ready for trial. They get their 

evidence and witnesses in order, and they may file motions with the court to narrow the 

issues for trial. This is also when the parties may try to settle the case. In some cases, the 

court may order that the parties try Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). These 

settlement efforts may take place at any point in the case. Review the Alternative Dispute  

Resolution Help Topic (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/AlternativeDisputeResolution.aspx) for

•  Trial phase: During this phase, the case is heard by the judicial  officer. This could last for a 

couple of hours or many days, depending on the case’s complexity. Parties present their 

evidence, including witnesses and exhibits, and the judicial officer decides the case and 

more information. 

issues an order. 

•  Post-trial phase: During this phase, one or both of the parties might appeal the decision 

from trial.  Other post-decree issues may come up after the trial, including  requests to 

change to child support or parenting time schedules. 

Settlement 

Many cases settle before the trial day or even on the day of trial.  “Settle” means that the 

parties reach an agreement, and the judicial  officer approves the agreement. You may be asked 

many times at different stages of the case to try to settle your dispute. The judicial  officer may 

require both parties to meet or to attend a form of Alternative Dispute Resolution 

(mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/AlternativeDisputeResolution.aspx), such as mediation, to try to reach a 

settlement before the trial starts. 

The judicial  officer may also schedule a “Pretrial  Conference” to talk with the parties 

about the trial issues and evidence and take steps to speed up the actual trial. You should attend the 

Pretrial Conference prepared to offer a solution to settle the case and be ready to consider 

settlement offers from the other side. Each time you have a hearing, including at the trial, you can 

expect the judicial officer to ask you and the other party what you have done to try to settle the case. 

As part of the pre-trial work, you and the other side might create a list  of facts you agree 

on. This is referred to as “Stipulated Facts.” Agreeing that certain things are true will shorten the 

time it takes to try the case and can help limit  the number of witnesses needed. 

A settlement allows the parties to find creative solutions that fit their needs and allows 

parties to have a “known” result in their case. Going to trial means the judicial  officer decides the 

outcome of the case instead of the parties. If you and the other party reach an agreement before 

the trial day, call  your judicial  officer’s clerk right away.

Court.aspx) for more information.

The judicial  officer’s role is to oversee the trial  or evidentiary hearing, and make sure that 

both sides have an opportunity to be heard as the rules of procedure and evidence allow. The 

judicial  officer also decides if the petitioner has proven their case, and what the outcome will be. 

The judicial  officer and their staff can give you general guidance, but if you are representing 

yourself, you need to decide, within the scope of the issues raised in the Petition and Answer and 

Counterpetition, what topics to cover, what evidence is important, and what questions to ask of 

witnesses. 

The judicial  officer must be neutral. In other words, the judicial  officer must be fair to both 

sides. They may ask a question of a witness to clarify  something, but they will not take over and ask 

all questions they think are important. It is your case, and you decide what you want the judicial 

officer to hear and see. 

Rules of Evidence and Rules of Civil Procedure 

The judicial  officer will conduct the trial  using the MN Rules of Civil  Procedure 

(revisor.mn.gov/court_rules/cp/), the MN Rules of Evidence (revisor.mn.gov/court_rules/rule/ev- 

toh/), and the MN General Rules of Practice (revisor.mn.gov/court_rules/gp). Law libraries 

(mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Law-Libraries.aspx) also have books that explain more about the rules 

and include parts of court cases that have interpreted the rules (case law). 

No one can predict exactly which rules will come into play, but some of the rules that most 

frequently apply are discussed below and listed at the end of this booklet. The judicial officer is 

required to follow these rules, and so are you and all other trial  participants. 

The basic idea of the MN Rules of Evidence is to make sure that the evidence is trustworthy. 

It would be unfair to everyone if the judicial officer relied on questionable evidence when deciding 

the case. In most trials, testimony from witnesses is used as evidence. The witness takes an oath 

and promises to tell the truth, and because the witness is present, they can be asked questions 

(“cross-examined”) by the other side. The “hearsay” rule of evidence requires that the person who 

made a statement be present in court to testify. Generally, you can’t testify about what someone 

else told you. There are important exceptions to this rule spelled out in the MN Rules of Evidence 

(see Article 8 – Hearsay). 

Rule 901  of the MN Rules of Evidence addresses what is needed for a document, photograph, 

telephone and computer record, or physical object to be reliable and allowed as evidence. Usually,

for evidence of this type to be admitted (meaning allowed to be considered in court), you need a 

witness to explain how the document or information was created and to testify that the information 

really is what it appears to be (that it is authentic). You must ask the witness questions to “lay a 

foundation.”  That means that your questions should allow the witness to cover what the item is, 

who created it, when, where, and why it was created. Some documents can be admitted into 

evidence without a witness, such as a certified copy of a public record (see Rule 902 of the MN Rules 

of Evidence). If the judicial  officer admits the item into evidence, it becomes part of the trial record. 

Another important concept in the MN Rules of Evidence is relevancy (see Article 4 – 

Relevancy. If evidence is not relevant to the case, the judicial  officer will generally not allow it. 

Relevant evidence helps the judicial officer decide if your story is true. If your witness is testifying 

and you hear something like, “Objection your honor, that testimony is irrelevant,” you need to be 

able to explain why what the witness is saying is important in helping the judicial  officer decide the 

case. If the judicial officer decides that the questions being asked will  help them make a decision, 

they will say something like “Objection overruled. Witness, you may continue answering the 

question.”  If the judicial officer “sustains” the objection, the witness cannot answer the question. 

Even relevant evidence may be kept out in some situations. A judicial officer may not allow 

evidence if it is repetitive and slowing down the trial. For example, a judicial officer may allow 1 or 2 

photos showing the condition of a bedroom, but not allow 20  photos showing basically  the same 

thing. 

Witnesses 

You are responsible for making sure your witnesses appear for the trial.  Plan ahead. The 

judicial  officer will not reschedule the trial  to let you arrange for witnesses you could have 

contacted earlier. You should contact your witnesses as soon as the court schedules your trial date. 

Witnesses must be available  the day of the trial. Some witnesses may not be allowed to 

testify. They must be able to offer admissible evidence, which means that a witness must have first- 

hand knowledge of what they are going to testify about. For example: 

1.  Your witness, Mary, testifies that the other party regularly leaves your joint minor 

child alone. 

2.  An objection is made because of lack of personal knowledge. 

3.  You then ask Mary how she knows that the other party leaves the minor child  alone.

knowledge. 

first-hand knowledge. 

Even if the testimony is admissible, if multiple witnesses are repeating the same information, 

the judicial officer may not allow them all to testify due to time concerns. 

Sometimes a party will  call  an “expert witness” to testify in their case. An expert is someone 

with scientific, technical,  or other special knowledge about a certain topic (for example, an 

accountant, appraiser, psychologist, Guardian ad Litem, etc.). Experts often testify to give their 

professional opinion about a fact of the case, such as the value of property or a certain 

recommendation for custody or parenting time. Rule 702  of the MN Rules of Evidence requires that 

reliability  of the expert’s testimony be established.  To do that, you must “lay the foundation” of the 

expert’s qualifications on the topic by asking questions about their education and professional 

experience. As with all evidence, the expert’s testimony is also subject to the hearsay rule and other 

MN Rules of Evidence. 

Subpoenas and Witness Fees 

The only way to try to guarantee that a witness will  come to court to testify or bring 

documents is to use a subpoena. A subpoena is a court order telling someone to appear in court 

and/or produce documents or records. If you need to subpoena a witness, review Rule 45 of the MN 

Rules of Civil Procedure. If your witness agrees to come to court, you do not need a subpoena. If you 

need to subpoena a witness, do so as soon as possible. 

To get a subpoena, you will  need to request it from court administration  in the county 

where your case is filed and pay a fee. Court administration  will prepare the subpoena. Next, you 

will need to arrange for someone else (not you) who is 18 years or older to serve the subpoena on 

the witness, along with the witness fee (you will  need to pay the witness fee). 

As explained on the subpoena form, if you subpoena a witness, you will need to pay that witness 

$20 per day, plus mileage, if applicable.  The fee for mileage is set by law and is stated in Minn. Stat.   

§ 357.22  (revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/357.22). Some witnesses served with a subpoena may also 

be entitled to reasonable compensation for their time, in addition to mileage and the $20  witness

fee. Review the Subpoenas Help Topic (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Subpoenas.aspx) and Rule 45 of  

the MN Rules of Civil Procedure (revisor.mn.gov/court_rules/cp/id/45/) for more information about 

subpoenas. 

information. 

If you have an order waiving the court filing  fees (called a Fee Waiver or In Forma 

Pauperis), and you cannot afford to pay the witness fees, you can ask the court to pay the witness 

fees for you. To do this, fill out a Supplemental Affidavit for Proceeding In Forma Pauperis and file it 

with court administration.  A judicial  officer will decide who pays the witness fees - you or the 

Court.  Review the Fee Waiver Help Topic (mncourts.gov/Help-Topics/Fee-Waiver-IFP.aspx) for more 

Witness fees and mileage apply only to witnesses who are subpoenaed. To put it simply: 

•  SUBPOENA: You DO have to pay witness fees and mileage. 

•  NO SUBPOENA: You DO NOT have to pay witness fees and mileage. 

Preparing Evidence 

Evidence includes witness testimony, your testimony, documents, pictures, or other 

objects.  Documents, pictures and other objects are called “exhibits.”  Generally, evidence, including 

exhibits, must be presented the day of trial.  Evidence cannot be submitted after the trial (except by 

order of the judicial officer in some unusual situations). Judicial  officers often send the parties a 

“Scheduling Order” requiring them to exchange “Exhibit Lists” and “Witness Lists” by a certain date. 

The judicial  officer may also require the parties to show each other their exhibits before the day of 

trial.  This allows both sides to better prepare for trial. 

The judicial  officer cannot investigate or gather evidence. It is your responsibility to have 

all the evidence available  and present it during trial. 

You will  generally not be allowed to use your phone to present evidence (for example, showing 

the judicial officer text messages or pictures on your phone).  You need to be prepared ahead of time 

to present any evidence in the proper format. 

Before the trial  starts, the judicial officer might ask if you and the other party have 

“stipulated” to the admissibility  of any of the documents or objects. Stipulating  to admissibility 

means that both sides agree that a document or object should be considered as evidence in the 

trial.  It is common to stipulate to the admissibility  of evidence if there is no dispute that the 

document or object is authentic. For example, both sides might stipulate to the admissibility  of

2019 Federal Income Tax Returns.  Even though copies of the returns are admitted into evidence, 

you still  need to explain to the judicial  officer the significance of the information. How does the 

information in the tax returns support your claim? Likewise, the other side can use the tax 

returns to support their version of what happened. 

Review the Exhibits Help Topic  (www.mncourts.gov/MNDES) for more information about how 

to present your evidence, including information about MNDES, the MN Digital  Exhibit System used in 

the MN Judicial Branch.  

Marking Exhibits 

At the trial, each party’s exhibits will need to be “marked.”  Exhibits are marked by 

placing a sticker on the document or object with consecutive numbers (for example, “Exhibit 1,” 

“Exhibit 2,” “Exhibit 3,” etc.). Sometimes, exhibits are marked before the trial day. Some judicial 

officers prefer that the court clerk or court reporter mark the exhibit when it is offered at trial. 

Sometimes the judicial officer or their clerk will assign exhibit numbers for each party to use. Check 

the Scheduling Order or connect with the clerk to see if the judicial officer has a preference. 

Exhibit and Witness Lists 

Even if the judicial  officer does not order them to be exchanged before the trial, it is a good 

idea to create Exhibit and Witness Lists. The Exhibit List  is a listing  of all the documents and objects 

you plan to offer into evidence at the trial.  A Witness List is a listing of all the witnesses you plan to 

have testify at the trial. You can find Exhibit  and Witness List  forms at www.mncourts.gov/forms in 

the Civil category. 

Creating a list will help you organize your case before the trial, and during the trial you can 

check the list to help avoid forgetting anything. As mentioned above, the judicial  officer may also 

require you to give an Exhibit and/or Witness List to the other side before the trial. 

Trials  will generally be held in-person.  Keep in mind that if your trial is held remotely, 

different requirements for exhibits may apply.  On the day of an in-person trial  (or before, if 

ordered to do so earlier), you must have the original document or object, and at least 3 copies of 

any documents. One copy is for the judicial  officer, one copy is for you, and one copy is for the

Trial Notebook 

Attorneys often create what is called a “trial  notebook,” and you can too. This helps you 

organize all  the parts of your case (Opening Statement, Witness List, Exhibit List, copies of 

exhibits, questions you plan to ask each witness, Final Argument, etc.). Before creating your trial 

notebook, think about what you need to prove. A two-column chart can be helpful. On the left, 

list each fact that supports your case. On the right, list the evidence that will prove each fact. Use 

the chart as you decide what evidence you will  need, and as you create a list of questions for 

each witness.  The trial  notebook is only for your use. You do not give a copy to the judicial 

officer or to the other parties. 

Trials  are scheduled for a set period of time.  If the Scheduling Order does not tell you the 

length of the trial, contact court administration  to see how much time is scheduled for the trial. 

Knowing how long you have for the trial will help you prepare. You need to be organized and figure 

out how long you want to spend with each witness and topic. 

The Trial 

At the trial, things will happen in this order: 

•  Opening statements 

•  Petitioner’s case-in-chief (witnesses and exhibits) 

•  Respondent’s case-in-chief (witnesses and exhibits) 

•  Final arguments (also called closing statements) 

Be on time for your trial  and make sure you know if your trial  is in-person or remote. If in- 

person, allow yourself extra time in case you run into traffic or weather issues, and allow time to 

find parking and go through security when you enter the courthouse. If your trial  is virtual, 

make sure you test your technology ahead of time and allow  plenty of time to log  in.  If you 

are not in the courtroom (in-person or virtual courtroom) when the clerk calls  the case, you may 

be considered in “default” and the judicial officer could grant the other party’s requests in full. 

If you have an emergency or are delayed, call  court administration and let them know. Even if 

you call,  the court may hold the hearing without you, and you could lose by default. 

Be prepared that your trial  may take longer than expected. If your trial is in-person, 

consider taking a bus or parking in a ramp instead of at a meter to avoid worrying about an

expired meter. Arrange for childcare and let your employer know that you might be delayed, if 

needed. There is a possibility that unanticipated or emergency situations will come up that your 

judicial  officer will need to handle.  This means your trial may be delayed or interrupted. 

Courtroom Behavior, including Remote Hearings 

You do not have to buy new clothing for court, but remember it is a formal place and you 

want to be conservative and respectful in dress and behavior.  Do not bring children unless the 

judicial  officer has told you to bring your children to the trial. 

Certain behaviors are not allowed in a courtroom (whether it is in-person or virtual) 

because they are noisy, distracting,  or disrespectful. You should not chew gum, eat, sleep, listen 

to earphones, use a cell phone (except in silent mode in some cases), carry a weapon, or use a 

camera, including  cell phone cameras (unless otherwise allowed).  Some courts do not allow cell 

phones in the courtroom, even if they are turned off. 

During the trial, you should listen carefully to the judicial officer and the other party.  Ask 

the Judicial officer for permission to speak. You should talk directly to the judicial officer, not the 

other party. When you talk to the judicial officer, start by saying, “Your Honor.”  Speak loudly and 

clearly and remember that only one person can speak at a time. A court reporter is taking down 

everything said during the trial, and they can only record one speaker at a time. Avoid arguing 

with or interrupting another person and try to control your emotions. 

Opening statements are the first part of a trial.  For your opening statement, briefly summarize  

what the case is about, what outcome you will ask for, and what evidence you will present that 

relates to the case. The evidence consists of witness testimony and exhibits the judicial officer 

Opening Statement 

receives in evidence. 

The opening statement is not your testimony.  Testimony is given later, under oath.  The 

opening statement is not a time for making your arguments. That comes later in the closing 

argument (also called  final argument). In some cases, the judicial  officer may not allow the 

parties to make opening statements, especially if the case is simple and the time available  for the 

trial  is short. 

Petitioner and Respondent’s Case-in-Chief 

After the opening statements, the petitioner presents their evidence. This is called the

petitioner’s case-in-chief. When the petitioner is done with all their witnesses and evidence, it is 

then the respondent’s turn to present their case-in-chief. 

Your case-in-chief may consist only of your testimony under oath, or it may include the 

testimony of other witnesses. If you have other witnesses, tell your judicial  officer who will 

testify first, second, third, and so on. The judicial  officer may also ask you to summarize what 

each witness will say before the witness is called. Be prepared to explain in a few sentences how 

the witness’ testimony is important to your case. 

irect Examination 

  D

When you call  a witness to testify, you must ask them questions. This is called “direct 

examination.” It is helpful to have a list of questions to refer to as you do your direct examination 

of each of your witnesses. You can tell your witnesses before the trial  what you plan to ask so 

your witnesses are prepared. 

During direct examination, you should ask one question at a time. It is difficult for the 

witness to respond to complex or compound questions (multiple questions asked at the same 

time). Also, keep in mind that you cannot testify while asking your witness questions; you can 

only testify if/when you are a witness on the stand and placed under oath. Often, the whole story 

does not come out until several witnesses have testified. The judicial  officer may make notes to 

remember the testimony of each witness, and in your final argument you can explain how all  the 

Sometimes a witness is hostile or not answering as you expected. Do not argue with 

evidence fits together. 

a witness. Just ask questions. 

Cross-Examination 

When you are finished asking questions (direct examination) of your witness, tell the 

judicial  officer. The other party (or their lawyer if they have one) will  then ask questions of the 

witness. This is called “cross- examination.” The questions asked during cross-examination must 

be related to the testimony the witness just gave in direct examination. Cross-examination is 

used to clarify the witness’ testimony and can also be used to undermine or discredit the 

testimony. For example, if a witness, an appraiser, testified about the fair market value of the 

marital  homestead, you might ask questions in cross-examination about properties that the

Page 13 of 16 

appraiser used as comparable to establish the fair market value. 

Cross-examining a witness can be difficult. Non-lawyers often have trouble asking 

questions of the witness instead of making their own statements or arguments. Like in direct 

examination, you cannot testify when you are cross-examining a witness.  You can only ask 

questions of the witness.  The judicial  officer may give you another chance to get it right or may 

say something like “you can testify when you are on the stand as a witness” and end the cross- 

examination. 

Redirect Examination  (also called Rebuttal) 

After the other party cross-examines your witness, you may ask the witness more 

questions in what is called “redirect examination,” or “rebuttal,” but those questions must be 

related to something discussed on cross-examination. Do not feel that you must ask questions 

on redirect examination. It is fine to say that you have no further questions. 

Testifying as a Witness in Your Own Case 

If you testify as a witness in your case, you will take an oath. After you are sworn in, the 

Judicial  officer will let you testify in a narrative fashion (telling the facts of the case as a story). 

When you are finished with your testimony, the other party (or their lawyer if they have one) will 

be able to ask you questions on cross-examination.  The judicial officer may also ask you 

questions. 

Introducing Evidence 

In addition to witness testimony, you may have documents or objects you want to use 

as evidence. Paperwork you may have filed with the court before the trial is not evidence. If 

you want the court to use something as evidence, list it as an exhibit in your Exhibit List and 

offer it as evidence at the trial. 

To offer an exhibit as evidence, you usually need a witness who can tell the court what 

the exhibit is. For example, if you have photos, the person who took the photos should testify 

about them, if possible, to explain when and where the photos were taken. You can be the 

witness if you have sufficient knowledge about the exhibit. 

Objections 

Objections are challenges.  Usually, objections are made because a party believes the 

evidence is not admissible according  to the MN Rules of Evidence. You (and the other party) can

object to questions, witness testimony, or exhibits that you believe do not comply with the rules 

of evidence and procedure. If you want to object, you should say, “Objection,” very clearly to the 

judicial  officer. The judicial  officer will ask you to explain why you object, and then the other 

party will get to respond. If either side objects to something, all questioning should stop 

immediately (if a witness is testifying, the witness should stop talking immediately). You must 

have a valid reason to object, according  to the MN Rules of Evidence.  “The person is lying” is not 

a valid objection.

If the judicial  officer sustains the objection, the witness cannot talk about whatever 

If the judicial officer overrules the objection, the witness can go ahead and talk about 

If you don’t understand the judicial  officer’s ruling on an objection, ask them to 

If you have a key piece of evidence and the other side objects to it, the judicial officer will 

decide if that evidence is admissible and should become part of the trial  record. If the judicial 

officer rules against you, you might be able to correct the problem. For example, if the objection 

was based on “lack of foundation” for a document, you might be able to ask the witness questions 

to explain what the document is and show that it is authentic so that you can get the document 

admitted into evidence. Do not expect the judicial  officer to tell you what to do or say to correct 

the problem. It is your job to make the legal arguments, and the judicial  officer’s job to make a 

ruling (decision). You should study the MN Rules of Evidence before the trial and get advice from a 

lawyer if you are not sure how to get key evidence into the record. 

Final Argument (also called Closing Statement or Closing Argument) 

After all  the evidence is given, you and the other party will be allowed to make final 

arguments.  During your final argument, explain what you are asking the court to do, and how the 

evidence presented supports your requests. If you want a certain property division, for example, tell 

the judicial officer what property division you want, and summarize the evidence to show why you 

are entitled to it. 

You may comment on any evidence that was presented at the trial  (your evidence and the 

other party’s evidence) and tell the judicial  officer what you think that evidence means. You are not

Page 15 of 16 

allowed to tell the Judicial  officer any new facts about the case during final argument, as the 

opportunity to present evidence is over by this point. 

The party who started the case or brought the motion has the burden of convincing the 

court (called the “burden of proof”) that their requests should be granted.  The party who 

started the case or brought the motion also has the right to speak first during final arguments. 

The judicial  officer may put a time limit  on the final arguments. 

Burden of Proof 

As mentioned above, the party who started the case or brought the motion has the burden 

of proof.  If the other party counter-petitioned or counter-motioned, they have the burden of 

proof for their requests. If you have the burden of proof, it is your responsibility to provide 

evidence that shows the court  that your requests should be granted.  If the evidence weighs in 

favor of the other party, or if the balance is equal, you have not met your burden of proof, and 

the court will not give you what you asked for. 

Decision 

The judicial  officer decides the outcome of family court cases. They will  listen to all  the 

testimony presented in the trial and review all the exhibits. The judicial officer will decide what 

facts were proven, and whether you are entitled to the relief you seek. 

It is important that you understand what happens when the trial is done and if there are 

more steps you must complete. For example, sometimes parties ask permission to file a 

“proposed order” before or after the trial  is over, or a judicial  officer may ask for one.  A 

proposed order is a document in which a party (or their lawyer) lays out the facts of the case and 

the desired outcome and attempts to persuade the judicial officer that the law supports the 

outcome the party requested. The judicial  officer will decide if they want proposed orders to be 

submitted and if so, when they are due. A proposed order cannot include any evidence that was 

not admitted at the trial. 

After the trial is over, and after other documents (if the judicial officer has asked for 

any) are submitted, the judicial  officer has 90  days to make a written decision (order or 

judgment and decree). When you receive the written decision, it is very important that you 

read it thoroughly.  There could be time-sensitive information, and it is important to 

understand what your obligations are, if any, in the written decision.
