  AND you can prove that the benefit to you in sealing the records of the civil commitment 
case is greater than the need for the public to know about the civil commitment case. 
 

UNDUE HARDSHIP 
 
Under  the  Minn.  Stat.  §  253B.23,  subd.  9,  a  court  can  seal  the  judicial  records  of  a  civil 
commitment if a person can show that the public being able to see the records creates an undue 
hardship for the person. 

NOTE:    It  is  strongly  recommended  that  you  talk  to  an  attorney  to  see  if  you  have  a  good 
argument for  asking the court to seal the civil commitment records before spending  your time 
and money preparing papers and going to a hearing.   

he attorney who represented you in the civil commitment case may be able to help you ask the 

court to seal the civil commitment records. 

he law does not say what would be an “undue hardship” for a person; this is one of the reasons 

why it is a good idea to talk to an attorney about your situation.  
 

BALANCING TEST 

hen you ask the court to seal your civil commitment records, you have to show that the benefit 
to you in sealing the civil commitment records outweighs the need for the public to know about 
the civil commitment. 

ome factors the court might consider include: 

  The nature of the symptoms of the mental illness (for example, did the behavior that led 
to  the  civil  commitment  involve  aggressive  or  dangerous  behavior?    Was  anyone 
injured?); 

  The length of time since the civil commitment proceeding;

Step 1 
Fill Out the Notice of Motion and Motion to Seal Civil Commitment Records

gives notice to the county attorney that you are asking the court to seal the records of your civil 
commitment case. 

OTE: The information you need to fill in the top part of the form is at the top of the “Register 
of Actions” or one of the court documents from your civil commitment case.  If you do not have 
these documents, you will need to go to the courthouse in the county where your case is located. 

ILL IN THE TOP PART OF THE FORM (this is known as “the caption”): 

  Write the case number (also known as the court file number) of the case you want to seal.   

  On  the  line  marked  “Respondent,”  write  your  name  as  it  is  listed  on  the  title  of  the  court 
documents in the case you want to seal.  If the “Respondent” name is not your current legal 
name, add “aka” and then write your current name. 

n the “TO” line, fill in the county where your case was held.  Then write the address of the 
County Attorney’s Office.  The address of the County Attorney’s Office can be found on the 
County’s website.

Step 2 
Fill Out the Affidavit in Support of Motion Form

commitment records.   

ILL IN THE TOP PART OF THE FORM (this is known as “the caption”): 

Fill out this caption the same way you filled out the one on the Motion. (See Step 1, above) 

ILL IN THE REST OF THE FORM: 

1.  Explain the undue hardship that you experience by the public having access to your civil 

commitment records.  

2.  Explain why you believe that the benefit to you in sealing the civil commitment records 

is greater than the need for the public to know about this case. 

3.  Sign and date the Affidavit under penalty of perjury.  Signing the Affidavit under penalty 
of perjury means you are stating that the information in the Affidavit is true to the best of 
your knowledge.  Perjury is the crime of intentionally lying or misrepresenting the truth, 
punishable by jail or other sanctions.   

Step 3 
Schedule Hearing Date, Time and Location

completed, contact court administration in your county and let them know you would like to file 
a Notice of Motion and Motion to Seal Civil Commitment Records and a Supporting Affidavit, 
and that you need a hearing date.  Court staff will tell you what you need to do in order to get a 
hearing date, time, and location. 

n some counties, you might have to serve and file your motion papers without a hearing date, 
and a Notice of Hearing is sent out separately.  This is why it is very important to contact court 
administration to find out that county’s procedure for scheduling a hearing date for your motion 
to seal civil commitment records.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
