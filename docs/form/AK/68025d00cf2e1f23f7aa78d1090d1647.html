      <pre>power  to  discipline  judges  for  misconduct. 
The Commission can informally and privately 
address  minor  ethical  issues,  and  can  also 
recommend  that  the  Alaska  Supreme  Court 
remove the judge from office.

While only a higher court can address a judge’s 
court decisions, judges must comply with the 
Code  of  Judicial  Conduct.    This  is  an  ethics 
code that governs a judge’s conduct on and off 
the bench.  This could include a judge’s need to 
maintain  proper  court  decorum  and  courtesy 
to those in the court.  Judges also cannot have 
a financial interest in a case in front of them or 
a close family relationship to people appearing 
before the judge.  In their personal life, Alaska 
judges  are  not  permitted  to  engage  in  any 
political activity or do any direct fundraising.  
And judges, like other top public officials, must 
file financial disclosure forms with the Alaska 
Public  Offices  Commission  so  the  public  can 
judge  for  themselves  whether  the  judge  or 
other official has a conflict of interest.

are 

sometimes 

criticized 
Judges 
for  unpopular  decisions.    Why  is  it 
important  that  public  pressure  not 
influence a judge’s duty to apply the law 
fairly?

People  get  into  arguments.    Some  of  these 
disputes we cannot resolve, and they will affect 
very important areas of our lives: our property, 
our family, and even our liberty.  When these 
disputes arise it is very easy for emotions to get 
out of control and very difficult to find common 
ground.    Because  our  society  recognizes  this, 
we  have  developed  laws  that  address  these 
arguments  in  a  civil  manner  free  from  the 
potential for violence that can result given the 
passion that we feel for these critical matters.  
And we look to judges to apply that law fairly 

to  everyone.    But  when  a  judge  is  addressing 
a case in a courtroom he or she is still trying 
to  resolve  a  dispute.    And  as  it  is  with  every 
dispute  brought  before  a  judge,  there  will  be 
one side that wins and another that does not.  
Every time a judge makes a decision there will 
be someone who is unhappy.

A  judge’s  decision  will  always  be  unpopular 
to  some  degree.    In  the  end,  we  need  judges 
to make unpopular decisions because fairness 
is  not  determined  by  popularity.    Fairness  is 
determined  by  applying  the  law  in  a  neutral 
manner.

Fair and 
Impartial 
Courts:

 Why You 
Should Care

PUB-31 (3/17)

Fair and impartial courts protect the rights of 
everyone  to  the  fundamental  promise  of  our 
justice  system:  equal  justice  under  the  law. 
Unlike  the  executive  and  legislative  branches 
of government, which are necessarily political 
in  nature,  the  judicial  branch  was  designed 
to  be  as  insulated  as  possible  from  politics 
and  public  pressure.  When  people  come  to 
court  to  resolve  their  disputes,  they  should 
have confidence that the judges deciding their 
cases will act in a neutral manner. They should 
not  have  to  worry  about  whether  judges  are 
being  guided  by  influences  from  outside  the 
courtroom, regardless of how loud or powerful 
these influences might be. They should be able 
to trust that justice will be determined by the 
law and the facts of their case, after everyone 
involved  –  regardless  of  their  social  status, 
income, race, beliefs or other factors – has had 
a fair and equal opportunity to be heard.

What is the main duty of a judge?

The  main  duty  of  every  judge  is  to  know  the 
law  and  to  apply  the  law  correctly  to  ensure 
that the case or controversy is decided in a fair 
and  impartial  manner.  Judges  also  consider 
the evidence and determine the key facts in a 
case or controversy involving no jury. 

Why  must  judges  follow  the  law,  not 
their own personal, political or religious 
views?

Whenever a case or controversy comes before 
a  court,  all  persons  who  are  parties  have  a 
basic constitutional right to what is called “due 
process.”  The concept of due process of law is, 
at its core, a concept of fundamental fairness.
Basic  to  fundamental  fairness  is  the  right  to 
be  given  fair  notice  of  the  specific  claims  or 
allegations  being  made;  the  right  to  be  given 

a  meaningful  opportunity  to  present  all  the 
evidence  and  arguments  in  support  of  one’s 
case;  and  the  right  to  have  the  factual  issues 
decided by a judge or a jury who will decide the 
case fairly, impartially and in accordance with 
the rule of law.

If a judge does not follow the law and makes 
rulings  and  decides  cases  according  to  that 
judge’s  own  personal,  political  or  religious 
views, then that judge is not fair and impartial.  
If  a  judge  is  not  fair  and  impartial,  then  one 
or  both  parties  are  denied  their  fundamental 
constitutional  right  to  due  process  of  law.  
Judges who are not fair and impartial, not only 
violate their oath of office but also undermine 
the careful balance of power among the three 
branches of government as established by the 
Alaska  Constitution.    They  would  also  erode 
the confidence that the people of Alaska have 
the right to expect of the Alaska Court System 
as a place where their cases and controversies 
will be fairly and impartially decided.

Judges, like most of us, have opinions and may 
lean  toward  one  political  party  or  another. 
Judges may or may not be religious, and there 
are  certainly  a  lot  of  different  faiths  a  judge 
might  adhere  to.  Judges  have  hobbies,  like 
and dislikes, philosophies of life and, thus are 
individuals and citizens like the rest of us. But 
a judge must uphold the law fairly and without 
bias  or  prejudice.  When  a  judge  enters  the 
courtroom,  his  or  her  personal,  political  and 
religious beliefs  must give way to the Rule of 
Law.

What qualities are important for a judge 
to possess? 

Alaskans should be most concerned that a judge 
will be capable and fair-minded.   If you were 

involved in a court case, ask yourself: What is 
the one thing you would want most? Fairness 
is  probably  at  the  top  of  anyone’s  list.  And  if 
you’re not involved in a court case? Fairness is 
still likely to be the No. 1 concern. When you 
think  of  main  qualities  a  judge  should  have, 
good judgment seems obvious. Fair, impartial 
and competent – no matter what the issue is. 

Although judges do hear cases concerning hot-
button issues such as abortion or euthanasia, 
those  kinds  of  issues  comprise  a  very  small 
portion of courts’ work.  Much of courts’ work 
is instead in the areas of family law, including 
divorce  and  child  custody,  and  criminal  law.  
Indeed,  many  judges  are  never  called  on  to 
address any hot-button issues.

constitutionally-established 

The 
Alaska 
Judicial Council evaluation process focuses not 
on  politics,  but  on  traits  such  as  professional 
competence, integrity, fairness, temperament, 
and experience.  These traits are most relevant 
to  the  quality  of  the  judiciary  and,  thus,  the 
quality  of  justice  in  Alaska.    While  Alaskans 
are  certainly  entitled  to  care  about  judges’ 
decisions  on  hot-button  issues,  they  should 
understand  the  tremendous  value  of  non-
judicial 
partisan,  merit-based  criteria 
selection and retention.

If  a  judge  acts  unethically,  breaks  the 
law,  or  acts  improperly,  is  there  any 
way that judge can be disciplined and, if 
justified, removed from office?
