INFORMATION ABOUT CSSD 
December 6, 2002 
 
The  Child  Support  Services  Division  (CSSD)  is  the  state  agency  responsible  for  enforcing  child 
support  orders.    In  order  for  CSSD  to  enforce  a  support  order,  a  parent  must  apply  for  CSSD 
services.  Or, if the custodial parent is receiving public assistance, or the child is in state custody, 
CSSD will open a case automatically.  

SSD  can  establish  administrative  support  orders,  and  modify  existing  orders  when  there  is  a 

change in the income of the paying parent. 

hild  support  is  usually  paid  through  wage  withholding.    CSSD  will  notify  the  paying  parent's 
employer  of  the  amount  of  the  child  support  order,  and  the  employer  will  send  the  money  each 
month to CSSD.  CSSD will in turn forward the money to the custodial parent.   

hild support payments will not be collected through wage withholding if the paying parent is self-

employed, or if the court finds that there is good cause not to require it.   

ow does a parent apply for CSSD services? 

You must complete an application, which you can obtain from any CSSD office, at the court, or at  
www.childsupport.alaska.gov  CSSD addresses and contact information can be found on page 2 of 
this form. Your application should provide as much information as possible about the other parent, 
and  must  include  an  affidavit  of  payments  already  made  or  received.    Be  sure  to  attach  your 
current custody order or support order, and any previous orders you may have in the case.   

ow does CSSD enforce child support orders? 

To  collect  support  payments,  CSSD  will  notify  the  paying  parent’s  employer  to  withhold  child 
support  from  the  parent’s  wages  and  to  send  the  money  to  the  Child  Support  Division  for 
distribution to the custodial parent or to repay the state for public assistance benefits paid on behalf 
of  the  child.    CSSD  can  also  issue  orders  to  'withhold  and  deliver'  other  assets,  including 
commissions,  retirement  checks,  bank  accounts,  Alaska  Permanent  Fund  Dividends,  Native 
Corporation Dividends, IRS tax refunds, stock dividends, and income-producing property.    

SSD  can  file  liens  against  the  paying  parent's  property,  and  revoke  state  occupational  and 
driver's  licenses if  child support  payments  are not  made.    CSSD  can  take the  parent to court for 
failure to pay child support.  CSSD charges interest on late payments. 

ow long does it take for the custodial parent to receive support payments made to CSSD? 

CSSD  will  mail  the  payment  to  the  custodial  parent,  or  deposit  it  directly  to  the  parent's  bank 
account, within two business days. 

ow does a parent sign up for direct deposit?

How can I find out about the payment status of my case? 

You  can  check  on  the  status  of  your  child  support  payments  by  calling  the  KIDSLINE  phone 
number, 269-6900 in Anchorage, or 1-800-478-3300 outside of Anchorage.  Or, you can click on 
KIDS  Online  at  www.childsupport.alaska.gov    You  will  need  to  have  your  member  ID  number, 
which  CSSD  sends  in  the  introductory  letter  to  custodial  parents,  and  on  the  monthly  statement 
sent to non-custodial parents.   

an CSSD also collect spousal support? 

Yes, in cases where both child support and spousal support have been ordered, CSSD will collect 
and  enforce  both  types  of  support  obligations.    But  CSSD  cannot  collect  and  enforce  spousal 
support alone.  CSSD cannot establish orders for spousal support; this must be done through the 
courts. 

hat if either parent moves out of state? 

CSSD can continue to collect payments and can coordinate enforcement of the support order with 
the child support agency in the other state. 

hat other services does CSSD provide? 

If there is no court order, CSSD will administratively establish a support order. 

  CSSD will do genetic testing where paternity is at issue. 

  CSSD will locate absent parents. 

  CSSD will enforce health care coverage for children if it's available to the paying parent through 

employment or union membership. 

  CSSD  will  review  the  amount  of the  support  order,  at the request  of  either  parent,  to  see  if  it 
needs to be increased or decreased.  If the order is an administrative order (CSSD established 
it),  CSSD  will  make  the  necessary  changes.    If  the  order  is  a  court  order,  CSSD  will 
recommend the changes to the court.
