General Information 

he information in this handbook is current as of September 2019.  Laws and procedures that came 
into existence after that date are not reflected here.  Check with an attorney or other knowledgeable 
person about whether any such changes affect your case.  How the information in this handbook 
applies to your case depends on the specific facts of your situation. 

hat is the purpose of this handbook? 

This handbook is designed to make the domestic violence laws easier to understand and use, so that 
victims can effectively represent themselves throughout the domestic violence protective order 
process and get the protection and help available to them under the domestic violence laws. 

ow does domestic violence impact the custody decision in divorce or custody 

A history of domestic violence between you and the other parent can affect the custody or visitation 
arrangement for your children. The law presumes that the parent who committed the domestic 
violence will likely not get custody and visitation unless he or she meets certain requirements. These 
may include completing a batterer’s intervention or substance abuse treatment program. If there is 
any history of domestic violence in your relationship, talk with an attorney about how this law will 
impact your custody or divorce case. 
 

Domestic Violence Protective Order Process 

hat is a domestic violence protective order? 

Domestic violence protective orders, sometimes called restraining orders, are court orders that 
prohibit someone from threatening to commit or committing domestic violence against another 
person.  Protective orders may  

limit communication and contact,  

• 
•  grant temporary custody of children and child support,  
•  grant temporary possession of a residence and vehicle, and  
• 

require payment for expenses associated with domestic violence. 

hat are some important terms to understand? 

Petitioner is the person who is asking the court for a protective order.  Usually the victim of 
domestic violence is the petitioner if he or she asks for the protective order. 

ho is this handbook designed to help? 

This handbook is intended to help people who are: 

•  considering whether to get a protective order; 
•  preparing for protective order hearings; 
•  modifying their current protective orders; 
• 

reporting violations of their protective orders.

espondent is the person whom the protective order is against.  Usually the person who commits 

the domestic violence is the respondent. 

udges and Magistrate Judges work for the court system and preside over domestic violence 
court proceedings. 

x parte is a legal term which in this context means that only the petitioner needs to be present to 

obtain a 20-day protective order.  There is no requirement that the respondent be notified in 
advance of the 20-day hearing or that the respondent be present. 

ervice is a legal term that means that you have delivered a copy of a legal document to the person 

on the other side of your case. 

he Certificate of Service is the name of the document that is a written, dated and signed 

statement telling the judge that you gave or sent a copy to the other side.  A copy of every document 
filed in court must be given to every person involved in the case, including the other side’s attorney 
if they are represented. 

n general there are strict rules about how to serve different kinds of documents to make sure that 
the other party gets a copy of all documents involved in a case. In domestic violence protective 
order cases, usually the police will serve the ex parte and long-term protective orders on the 
respondent.  For requests to modify or other motions filed in protective order cases, usually the 
court will serve the other party by mail after the request is filed with the court. 

re there different types of protective orders? 

Yes.  There are three types of protective orders that last for different lengths of time and provide 
different forms of relief.  They are: 

emergency protective orders which last for 72 hours;  
ex parte protective orders which last for 20 days;  
long term protective orders which last for one year.

3. 
 

What is an emergency protective order? 

An emergency protective order is requested by a police officer on behalf of a victim with the 
victim’s consent and lasts for 72 hours.  The police officer may call the judge from the victim’s 
location and describe the domestic violence incident that occurred.  Neither the victim nor the 
police officer is required to notify the respondent that the victim is seeking an emergency protective 
order.  If the judge finds probable cause that a crime of domestic violence has occurred, an 
emergency protective order can be issued.  This order gives the victim 72 hours of protection which 
provides enough time to request a more comprehensive and longer-lasting order. 

t is important to point out that the police rarely request emergency protective orders for victims.  If 
the police come to assist you after a domestic violence incident and you think that this type of order 
would be helpful, you may ask the officer to request an emergency protective order on your behalf.

What is an ex-parte protective order? 

You will most likely begin the protective order process by requesting an ex parte protective order.  
An ex parte protective order prohibits the respondent from threatening to commit or committing 
domestic violence against the petitioner and lasts for approximately 20 days.  This order may: 

•  prohibit or limit the respondent from contacting the petitioner, 
•  give the petitioner temporary custody of children, and  
•  give the petitioner possession of the residence and vehicle. 
 

You do not have to notify the respondent that you are seeking an ex parte protective order.  In fact, 
you may be at an increased risk of danger if you do. 

o get an ex parte order, you must fill out a petition form which is available at the court, on the 
internet , at most shelters and possibly through the local police or VPSO.  If you are filing on your 
behalf, you will file the DV-100 which is for just the petitioner.  If you are filing on behalf of 
multiple people (you and your child(ren)), fill out the DV-100-M.  You can download the petition at 
http://www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#dv.  If you download the petition, make two 
copies and file the original and copies with the court. 

n the petition, you may also request a long term protective order.  If you request a long term order, 
the judge will set a date approximately twenty days later for a hearing.  The ex parte order will contain 
information about the date, time, and location of the long term order hearing. 

he ex parte order is valid at the time the judge signs it.  However, the respondent must be served 
with, or receive a copy of the order from the police to know it is in effect.  See MacDonald v. State, 
997 P. 2d 1187 (Alaska 2000). 

hat does “being served” with an order mean? 

This means the respondent has received a copy of the order, usually from the police, and is notified 
of all its provisions.  Once the respondent has been served, if he or she does not follow its 
provisions, he or she is violating the order and may be subject to arrest or have to return to court. 

o I have to serve the respondent myself? 

No, the police will serve the respondent.  When requesting your protective order, you will also fill 
out a form for the police to serve the order on the respondent.  On this form, you need to provide 
an address where the police can serve the respondent a copy of the order.  Give as much 
information as you can on how the police can find the respondent at a home or work address.  If the 
respondent is homeless or moves around frequently, provide a description of where the police might 
find him or her.  You will fill out either: 

•  a Law Enforcement Information Sheet (DV-127), or   
•  a Request for Service of Domestic Violence Documents (DV-125 for 1 petitioner, or DV-

125-M for multiple petitioners (parent with child(ren))   

All forms are available at the court or at http://www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#dv.

What is a long term protective order? 

A long-term protective order prohibits the respondent from threatening to commit or committing 
domestic violence, stalking, or harassing you.  An order may contain the following provisions: 

➢ prohibit the respondent from contacting or communicating directly or indirectly with 

 

➢ remove and exclude the respondent from the residence of the petitioner, regardless of 

you; 

ownership of the residence; 

➢ direct the respondent to stay away from the petitioner’s residence, school, or work place, 
or any specified place frequented by the petitioner or designated household member; 
➢ prohibit the respondent from entering or following a vehicle that the petitioner occupies 

or possesses; 

➢ prohibit the respondent from using or possessing a deadly weapon if the court finds the 
respondent actually possessed or used a weapon during the commission of domestic 
violence; 

➢ direct the respondent to surrender any firearm that he or she owns or possesses if the 

court finds that he or she actually possessed or used a firearm during the commission of 
domestic violence; 

➢ request a peace officer to accompany the petitioner to the petitioner’s residence to 

ensure that the petitioner safely gets possession of the residence, vehicle, or personal 
items and is able to safely remove a vehicle or personal items from the residence; 
➢ award temporary custody of children to the petitioner and may arrange for visitation; 
➢ give the petitioner possession and use of a vehicle and other essential items, including a 

pet, regardless of ownership of the items; 

➢ prohibit the respondent from consuming controlled substances; 
➢ require the respondent to pay support for the petitioner, minor child in the petitioner’s 

care, or a pet in the petitioner’s care; 

➢ require the respondent to reimburse the petitioner for expenses associated with the 
domestic violence, including medical expenses, counseling, shelter, and repair or 
replacement of damages property; 

➢ require the respondent to pay costs and fees incurred by the petitioner in bringing the 

protective order action; 

➢ order the respondent, at the respondent’s expense, to participate in a program for the 
rehabilitation of perpetrators of domestic violence, or treatment for the abuse of drugs 
or alcohol; 

➢ order other relief that the judge determines necessary to protect the petitioner or any 

household member. 

 

All provisions in a long-term protective order will be in effect for one year, except for the 
prohibition against committing or threatening to commit domestic violence which remains in effect 
indefinitely until dissolved by a judge. 

he most typical way to receive a long-term protective order is to petition the court for both an ex 

parte protective order and a long-term protective order.  If you request both types of orders, the 
judge will schedule a hearing for approximately 20 days later on the long-term order request when he

or she decides the ex parte order.  The respondent will be notified of the hearing for the long term 
protective order when served with the ex parte order or the notice of hearing form.  The petitioner 
must appear at the hearing for the long-term order or else the petition is dismissed.  If the 
respondent does not show up for the hearing, the judge will still consider the petition as long as the 
petitioner is present. 

ou may also request a long-term protective order without requesting an ex parte order, indicating on 

the petition form that you are only asking for a long term protective order.  After receiving the 
petition, the domestic violence office will schedule a hearing date.  It is important to note that 
without an ex parte order, you have no order in place until the court grants a long term protective 
order. 

hy get a domestic violence protective order? 

The purpose of a protective order is to give you and your children immediate, temporary legal 
protection from domestic violence.  If the respondent violates a protective order, the respondent 
may be arrested and charged with a crime or have to return to court. 

hat is the difference between civil and criminal law? 

One of the most confusing things about the legal system is the difference between civil cases and 
criminal cases.  In domestic violence situations there may be both civil and criminal cases occurring 
at the same time as a result of the same violent act.  The major differences have to do with who is 
the party initiating the case and the reason for the case. 

hat is a criminal case? 

A criminal case is when the government is represented by a prosecutor known as the District 
Attorney for the State of Alaska, although in some cities there are municipal prosecutors.  The 
“defendant” is the person whom the case is against because it is believed that he or she committed a 
crime.  In a criminal case, the victim is not a party and does not need to have an attorney.  The 
prosecutor may require the victim to testify as a witness to help prove the case against the 
defendant, by serving the victim with a subpoena. 

f the police become involved because someone violates a criminal law, the police may arrest the 
offender if they find probable cause.  The offender who is called the “defendant” must then appear 
before a judge who will decide whether to put the defendant in jail and set a bail amount, release the 
defendant to a third party custodian, or release the defendant on his or her own recognizance (O.R.).  
The judge will require the defendant to comply with certain conditions if the defendant is released, 
one of which might be to prohibit contact with the victim. 

 prosecutor initiates a criminal case because he or she thinks there is enough evidence to prove the 

defendant has committed a crime. 

f the defendant pleads “guilty,” he or she will be sentenced without trial.  If the defendant pleads 
“not guilty,” the case will go to trial, usually with a jury.  Throughout the case, the prosecutor may 
ask the victim to appear in court. The prosecutor must notify the victim of all hearings and the 
victim can choose whether to attend.  At the end of a trial, the jury will decide whether the 
defendant is guilty or not guilty.  If the jury decides the defendant is guilty, the judge may order him

or her to go to jail, to do community service, to pay restitution to the victim, and/or to commit no 
jailable offenses for a period of time.  If the jury finds the offender is not guilty, the defendant is free 
and the case is over. 

requently, the defendant will plead “no contest,” which means that he or she is not technically 
admitting guilt, but is accepting the same consequences of a guilty plea.  If the defendant pleads no 
contest, he or she will be sentenced without a trial. 

hat is a civil case? 

In a civil domestic violence case, like when requesting a protective order, both parties are private 
individuals.  The government is not involved.  In a domestic violence protective order case, the 
person who begins the case is called the “petitioner” and the person whom the case is against is the 
“respondent.”  The case only moves ahead if the petitioner participates.  In other civil cases, the 
person who begins the case is called the “plaintiff” and the person whom the case is against is the 
“defendant.” 

n a civil domestic violence protective order case, the court may enter an order prohibiting specific 
actions such as committing domestic violence, and may order the respondent to reimburse the 
petitioner for expenses from the domestic violence, or may prohibit the respondent from contacting 
the petitioner. 
 

Requesting A Protective Order 

ho can ask the court for a protective order? 

You are eligible to get a protective order if you  

1.  are the victim of a crime involving domestic violence, which is described below, 

2.  have a “household relationship” with the person who committed domestic 

violence against you.  “Household relationship” has a specific legal meaning that 
is described below. 

and  

 

Can children get protective orders? 

Parents or guardians can request protective orders on behalf of their child who is under age 18.  The 
respondent must have committed a crime of domestic violence against the child and the child must 
have a household relationship with the respondent. 

hat are crimes of domestic violence? 

The most common domestic violence crimes that are the basis for getting a protective order are 
assault, stalking, and harassment.  However, you may get an order as long as the respondent 
commits or attempts to commit a domestic violence crime.  To receive an order, you do not have to 
state specifically the legal name of the crime the person has committed.  You only need to describe 
in detail what the person did to you and the judge will figure out which, if any, crime was 
committed.

You may be able to get a protective order even if the respondent has not physically hit you, because 
not all of these crimes involve actual physical injury.  Following is a list of the domestic violence 
crimes. 

➢  Homicide is when someone causes the death of another. 
➢  Assault is any kind of physical harm, like hitting.  It also includes threats to do physical 

injury if the threats are capable of being carried out right then. 

➢  Reckless endangerment occurs when someone acts to create the danger of another 
being injured.  An example is when the abuser punches the wall next to the victim’s 
head, creating the danger that abuser might punch the victim in the face. 

➢  Stalking occurs when someone engages in repeated acts of non-consensual contact with 
the victim or a family member that places that person in fear of physical injury or death. 
➢  Kidnapping occurs when someone restrains the victim with the intent to inflict physical 
injury upon or sexually assault the victim, or places the victim in apprehension that he or 
she will be injured.  It also occurs when someone moves the victim against the victim’s 
will to a place where he or she is unlikely to be found.  It also occurs when an adult who 
is not a relative of a child takes that child and keeps him or her away from his or her 
normal guardians. 

➢  Custodial interference occurs when a parent or relative of the child takes the child 

knowing he/she has no legal rights, or in violation of a court order and keeps that child 
for an extended period of time.  Returning a child an hour or two late from visitation is 
not considered custodial interference. 

➢  Sexual offenses include all forms of sexual assault, incest, unwanted sexual contact, and 

rape.  Sexual offenses can occur even if the parties are married. 

➢  Robbery occurs if someone holding a weapon takes an item of property from the 

victim’s presence. 

➢  Extortion and coercion are crimes that we commonly consider blackmail.  This is when 
someone threatens a victim with physical harm or threatens someone known to the 
victim with physical harm, forcing the victim to do something the victim does not want 
to do.  An example is if an abuser calls a victim and threatens to beat him or her unless 
he or she agrees to have sexual relations. 

➢ Burglary occurs when someone enters or remains unlawfully in a building intending to 

➢ Criminal trespass occurs when someone enters or remains unlawfully on land, in a 

commit a crime in the building. 

dwelling, or a vehicle.  

➢  Arson occurs when someone intentionally damages any property by starting a fire or 

explosion that places another in danger of serious physical injury. 

➢ Criminal mischief occurs when someone recklessly or intentionally damages the 

property of another. 

➢ Terroristic threatening occurs when someone knowingly makes a false report that a 

circumstance dangerous to human life exists and places another in fear of physical injury. 

➢ Harassment occurs when someone 

•  calls on the phone and will not hang up so that the other person cannot make or 

receive phone calls;  

•  makes repeated telephone calls at extremely inconvenient hours; 

7 

 

 

•  makes an anonymous or obscene phone call; or  
•  makes a call that threatens physical injury. 

➢  Cruelty to animals if the animal is a pet. 

ay I get a protective order if the respondent was not arrested? 

Yes.  To get a protective order, it is not necessary that the police have arrested or charged the 
respondent with a crime.  You can get a protective order even if the police were never called.  In 
your petition for a protective order, and when you speak to the judge, describe the act that caused 
you to seek the court’s protection.  You are not responsible for knowing exactly what criminal law 
the respondent violated. 

ho are “household members”? 

To get a protective order, you must have a specific relationship with the respondent.  The law states 
that the violence must have been committed by a “household member.”  This does not mean that 
you have to live in a house together.  A “household member” includes: 

➢ adults or minors (children under the age of 18) who are current or former spouses; 
➢ adults or minors who live together currently or lived together in the past (covers 

roommates, whether or not they are in an intimate relationship); 

➢ adults or minors who are dating or who have dated; 
➢ adults or minors who have or had a sexual relationship; 
➢ adults or minors who are related to each other up to being first cousins; adults or minors 

who are related or formally related by marriage; and,  

➢ people who have a child together. 
 

Do I have to pay to file for a protective order? 

No.  It is free to file for a protective order. 

ow do I begin the protective order process? 

Fill out a petition for a protective order (DV-100 for 1 petitioner or DV-100-M for multiple 
petitioners), which is available at the local court or shelter or at 
http://www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#dv.  If you download the form from the Internet, 
make 2 copies of your filled-out petition and file the original and copies with the court.  When you 
fill out the petition, you may request both an ex parte protective order that lasts for 20 days and a 
hearing for a long term protective order that lasts for one year.  Also, fill out the confidential Law 
Enforcement Information Sheet (DV-127) which describes information about the respondent so the 
officer knows how to find and identify the respondent.  The DV-127 form is included in the petition 
packet.   

ow do I fill out the petition form? 

You need to fill out the petition, which is a fill-in-the-blank form. You may request both an ex parte 
protective order that lasts for 20 days and a long term protective order that lasts for one year.  The 
most important part of the petition is where you will describe the incident that caused you to feel 
like you need a protective order.  The form may not have enough space to state everything you want

to tell the judge so you may use additional paper.  You also may need to use additional paper when 
describing any safety concerns you have about the respondent having visitation with the children.  In 
some communities advocates are available to assist you.  (See the list of advocate services at the back 
of this handbook or at www.andvsa.org) 

fter you complete the petition, you will give it to the clerk at the front counter who will give it to 
the judge to review.  You will then wait until the judge is ready to consider your request.  The judge 
will only consider the request for an ex parte protective order at the time you file the petition but will 
set a hearing date for a long term protective order approximately 20 days later. 

ou do not need to notify the respondent that you are seeking an ex parte protective order.  In fact, 

you may be at an increased risk of danger if you notify him or her. 

Ex Parte Hearing 

hen will my hearing for an ex parte protective order happen? 

In Anchorage, hearings happen every day.  Monday through Friday, hearings are in the afternoon 
between 2:30 and 4:30 pm.   On weekends, hearings will be between noon and 8 pm when a 
magistrate judge is available. 

n other courts, ex parte protective order hearings usually occur during court hours between 8:00 a.m. 
and 4:30 p.m.  Check with your local court for the hours when the hearings happen.  Some courts 
don’t hold ex parte hearings and decide whether to grant an order based on the petition. 

ow do I present my case for an ex parte protective order? 

To get an ex parte protective order, you must explain to the judge why you need protection from the 
respondent.  It is important to describe the most recent incidents and provide as much detail as 
possible.  Answer the questions: 

•  what happened? 
•  where? 

•  when? 
•  who, if anyone, was present? 

or example, instead of stating that the respondent  hit you, state: 

On Tuesday at approximately 10 p.m., we were in the living room arguing.  He raised 
his right arm, made a fist, struck me on the left cheek which threw me back into the 
recliner, causing me to fall to the floor. 
 

Details are important because the judge was not present when the incident occurred so you must re-
create the scene.  The judge may ask you questions.  You can bring a friend or advocate as support. 

hat type of provisions will the ex parte order contain? 

If the judge grants the ex parte order, he or she will give you the order which states the things that 
the respondent is prohibited from doing.  The order will state that the respondent is prohibited from

committing or threatening to commit domestic violence against you.  For the 20 days the order is in 
effect, it may also: 

• 

list the places where the respondent is prohibited from going such as your home, job, or 
school; 

•  prohibit or limit the type of contact and communication the respondent may have with 

you;  

•  determine temporary custody, visitation and child support;  
•  determine spousal support; 
•  give you possession of the joint residence or a vehicle, regardless of ownership, and  
• 

require the respondent to turn over weapons to the police. 
 

The ex parte order is valid when the judge signs it.  However, the respondent must be served with a 
copy of the order to be notified of its provisions.  The judge will give you a form to fill out with 
information about where the respondent might be located so that the police can serve him or her.  
You will fill out a Law Enforcement Information Sheet (DV-127) or a Request for Service of 
Domestic Violence Documents (DV-125 for 1 petitioner, or DV-125-M for multiple petitioners 
(parent with child(ren)).  These forms are available at the court or at 
http://www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#dv. 

ou need to provide an address where the police can serve the respondent a copy of the order.  
Provide as much information as you can on how the police can find the respondent at a home or 
work address.  If the respondent is homeless or moves around frequently, provide a description of 
where the police might find him or her. 

ou may also request police assistance to take possession of your children, the house, the vehicle, or 

necessary personal items, if the judge ordered those things to you.  If the order provides police 
assistance, be aware that the police will only stay for at most 15 minutes to help you get the ordered 
items. 

ake copies of your ex parte order and have a copy with you at all times. 

ou may want to give a copy to your employer, school, children’s school, or day care if those are 

places the order prohibits the respondent from going. 

ill the judge set a date for a hearing on the long term protective order? 

If you also requested a long term protective order which lasts for one year, the judge will set a 
hearing date for approximately 20 days after the day you receive the ex parte order.  Unlike the 
hearing for an ex parte order, the respondent will be notified of the long term order hearing, where 
he or she will be given the opportunity to present his or her side. 

f the judge denies the ex parte order, may I still get a long term protective 
order? 

If the judge denies your request for an ex parte order, you may still request a long-term protective 
order.  A hearing will be scheduled for approximately 20 days from the time you make the request.

The respondent will be notified of the hearing, where the respondent will be given the opportunity 
to present his or her side. 

hat can I do if the abuser gets an ex parte protective order against me? 

Unfortunately some abusers attempt to turn the system around and petition the court for a 
protective order against the real victim by providing the judge with misleading or incomplete 
information.  Since the judge issues ex parte orders based on the petitioner’s version of events, 
without notice to the respondent, it is possible that an abuser can petition the court before you do 
and get an ex parte order against you.  If this happens, and you believe that you are the real victim of 
domestic violence, you can petition the court as soon as possible for your own ex parte order. 

n your petition, describe the facts that make you the victim of domestic violence and notify the 
judge that you believe the abuser erroneously received an ex parte order against you and of the 
hearing date for the long-term protective order.  Even if the abuser erroneously received an order 
against you, generally the judge will not dissolve that order until the long-term hearing, when he or 
she will hear from both sides.  If you find yourself in this situation, it is important that you request 
your own ex parte order so that you are eligible to receive the legal protections available only to the 
person filing a petition for a protective order.  Examples of these legal protections are temporary 
custody of the children, and that the respondent be excluded from the residence or vehicle. 

Long-Term Protective Order Hearing 

hat should I expect at the long term protective order hearing? 

The judge holds the long-term protective order hearing to determine whether to grant you an order 
that lasts for one year.  The respondent is given notice of the hearing.  You can watch one of the 
hearings before your own to familiarize yourself with the court process.  The hearings are open to 
the public. 

here may be other domestic violence cases scheduled at the same time as your hearing so be 

prepared that many other people may be present.  You will wait until the judge calls your case.  The 
petitioner, must show up or the case will be dismissed.  If the respondent does not show up, the 
case proceeds and only the petitioner’s side of the case is heard.  While the hearing may not take 
very long, be prepared to be at the court for several hours in the event that your case does not 
happen until the end of that day’s court schedule.  Make child care arrangements for this time. 
At the beginning of the hearing, all persons who testify will be sworn in which means that they 
swear or affirm that they will tell the truth.  The judge will also ask each person who will testify to 
state their name, address, and occupation.  If you do not want the respondent to know your address, 
you can tell the court to keep your address confidential and give it to the judge on a piece of paper 
instead of stating it out loud. 

ho presents their case first? 

Usually the judge asks the petitioner to present the petitioner’s case first, explaining why a long term 
protective order is needed.  The judge will then hear from the respondent.  This is discussed further 
below.

What types of evidence should I use? 

You may use many types of evidence, depending on the specifics of your situation.  Evidence may 
include your testimony, witness testimony, photographs, medical records, damaged items, police 
reports, bills or estimates. 

ow should I testify? 

Tell the judge what happened to cause you to seek a protective order.  When you are representing 
yourself, tell your story simply and directly.  If you have an attorney, your attorney will conduct what 
is called a “direct examination” by asking you a series of questions to help you tell your story. 

rganize your testimony before the hearing because the judge will often give each hearing only a 
short amount of time, from 15 - 30 minutes in total.  You can have a written outline of the points 
you want to make which you can glance at when testifying.  However, you should not write out your 
testimony word for word in advance and read it at the hearing. 

fter being sworn in by the judge, the petitioner will usually speak first.  Be specific and tell what 

happened by answering these questions: 

•  what happened? 
•  where? 

•  when? 
•  who was present? 

he more details you provide, the more helpful it is to the judge to understand exactly what 

happened.   Describe what caused you to seek a protective order, beginning with the most recent 
incident.  For example, describing an assault may sound like the following: 
 

On Saturday night at 11:30 p.m., Marion came home and started a fight by yelling at 
me and calling me names like #$@%^&*.  I was in the kitchen and Marion pushed 
me up against the wall near the refrigerator.  Marion then choked me by putting both 
hands around my neck and shook me for about two minutes.  I could barely breathe 
and was so scared.  Marion finally stopped and I was shaking.  Our two year old child, 
who was sleeping in the adjacent room, woke up and was crying hysterically. 

f  there  has  been  a  long  history  of  abuse  in  the  relationship,  describe  some  of  the  most  serious 
incidents that have occurred in the past.  If the respondent has not recently been physically violent, 
but is currently behaving in a threatening way which puts you in fear because of the past violence, tell 
this to the judge. 

f all the types of evidence, your testimony is the most important.  As the person who actually 

experienced the abuse, you are in the best position to describe what happened.  If your only form of 
evidence is your testimony, do not be concerned that it may not be enough.  Your testimony can be 
the strongest type of evidence if you are well prepared and appear credible. 

f the respondent has an attorney, will that attorney question me? 

If the respondent has an attorney, the attorney may question you after you testify, which is called a 
“cross examination.”  Answer only the question asked, keeping your answer as short as possible 
while being honest and complete.  You may answer “yes,” “no,” or “I don’t know,” if appropriate, 

 

  H

  O

  A

  T

  I

  I

or ask that the question be repeated or clarified if necessary.  Even if you do not like the way the 
attorney is characterizing the events that occurred or if you feel like he or she is trying to make you 
look bad, do not argue with the attorney, the respondent, or the judge. 

fter the respondent’s attorney has finished questioning you, you may ask the judge if you can 
further explain your answers to the attorney’s questions if necessary.  The court is often willing to 
allow additional testimony, especially if you ask respectfully. 

hat other evidence may I use in presenting my case? 

In addition to your testimony, you may present other witnesses, photographs, damaged items, 
medical records, and police reports, depending on the specifics of your situation. 

itnesses 

Other people may testify as witnesses, but only if they have personal knowledge of the abuse that 
you suffered.  For example, they saw the respondent strike you or saw bruises on your arms.  If 
there is a witness, tell the judge at the beginning of the hearing that you have a witness who will 
testify that he or she saw what happened.  If the judge wants to hear from the witness, he or she will 
be sworn in and then will describe what occurred. 

he judge may choose not to hear from a witness because of the short amount of time given to each 

hearing.  However, even if the judge does not hear your witness’s testimony, you may feel more 
confident bringing witnesses with you because they can provide moral support. 

f your children witnessed the abuse, tell the judge that they were present.  However, you should 
seriously consider not having the children testify in court to avoid putting them in the 
uncomfortable position of possibly testifying against their other parent, especially if the children are 
young. 

hotographs 

You may present the judge with photographs of injuries you received from the domestic violence 
incident.  By the time of the hearing, there is a good chance that your injuries may be healed so 
photographs may help to show the injuries at the time of the incident.  If the police got involved and 
you sustained injuries, they likely will have taken photographs.  If bruises appear after the police 
leave, you can call them and request a follow up report and an officer will likely come back to take 
more photographs.  You can request copies of the photographs from the police photo lab for which 
you will have to pay.  You can also take your own photographs or have a friend do so.  Some 
bruising does not appear immediately or gets darker after a few days so you can take a series of 
photos as time passes. 

hotos may also help to show property damage that resulted from the domestic violence.  For 

example, you may present pictures of holes punched in the walls, broken down doors, or shattered 
car windshields. 
Damaged Items 
If items were damaged from the domestic violence and they are small enough to bring to court, you 
may present them as evidence.  For example, if the respondent ripped your shirt, you may present 
the shirt as evidence in court.

edical Records

If you got medical treatment as a result of the domestic violence, you can get copies of your medical 
records from the treatment provider and present them to the judge. 

olice Reports and Criminal Complaints 

If the police got involved, you can try to get a copy of the police report.  Usually you will need a 
subpoena to get copies of police records or tapes.  A subpoena is a legal request signed by a court 
clerk for the production of some document or witness. You can pick up a subpoena form in the 
court clerk’s office. To get a police report, you will usually need to subpoena the officer who wrote 
the report to appear in court with the report.  This may involve you paying a witness fee to the 
officer so check in advance so you are prepared. 

f the prosecutors have a criminal case going on against the person that was violent to you, you can 
ask them for a copy of the criminal complaint. 

hen should I begin collecting the evidence? 

Start gathering your evidence as soon as possible.  Getting medical records, police reports and 
photos will take some time.  Outline your testimony well in advance of the hearing so you are 
comfortable with what you will say and will be organized. 

hat should I expect when the respondent presents his or her case? 

After you present your testimony and any witnesses or evidence you may have, the respondent will 
present his or her side.  If the respondent is not represented by an attorney, the respondent will 
speak in a narrative.  If the respondent has an attorney, the attorney will ask the respondent 
questions which are called a “direct examination.” 

here is a good chance that the respondent will say things in court that you may find very upsetting, 

lies, or exaggerations.  For example, the respondent may try to put the focus on you, claiming that 
you are violent, a liar, mentally ill, an unfit parent, or a drug or alcohol abuser. 

f this happens, remember to be respectful while in court.   If you would like to explain something 
to the judge, or clear up something that the respondent stated, you must wait until the respondent is 
entirely done speaking and then respectfully ask the judge if you may add something.  The judge is 
often willing to allow additional testimony, especially if you ask respectfully. 

ow should I behave in court? 

Always remember the importance of being respectful in court, even if the respondent states 
something that is upsetting or false.  Always speak to the judge and never respond directly to the 
respondent.  The judge will let you know when it is your time to speak.  Do not speak when it is not 
your turn.  Look at the judge and not the other party throughout the hearing. 

t is acceptable for you to cry if you are upset or frightened.  However, do not yell out in despair, 
throw your hands up in the air, roll your eyes, or interrupt anyone speaking.  Never argue with the 
respondent, attorney or the judge.  If the judge sees that you are calm, he or she may be less likely to 
believe the respondent’s statements that you are the abuser or the one with the problem.

What happens after both parties present their sides? 

After both parties present their cases, the judge will determine whether a “preponderance of the 
evidence” shows that the respondent committed a crime of domestic violence against you.  This 
means that the judge will weigh out both parties’ evidence and determine which side weighs heavier.  
If the judge finds that a crime of domestic violence occurred, he or she will enter the long-term 
protective order for one year and address additional relevant issues such as child custody and 
visitation, spousal and child support, possession of the home and vehicle and the other provisions of 
the order.  If the judge does not find that domestic violence occurred, the case ends and there will 
be no order in effect. 

f you fear for your safety, make sure you have a safety plan ready.  An advocate at your local shelter 
can help you with safety planning. You can find information on safety plans at 
http://www.andvsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Personalized-Safety-Plan.pdf.  

hat happens if I have a divorce or custody case going on at the same time as 

a domestic violence protective order case? 

If you also have a divorce or custody case, the domestic violence case file may be reassigned to the 
judge in your other case.  This makes two cases into one case.  This is to have the benefit of one 
judge hearing all the relevant issues, and avoid having two different judges dealing with issues that 
are related or presenting evidence more than once.  This practice may differ depending on which 
location in Alaska your divorce or custody case is filed.  This may not automatically happen and you 
will need to alert the judge in the domestic violence case hearing that the other divorce or custody 
case exists and provide the case number.  Also, give the judge in the divorce or custody case a copy 
of the order you receive in the domestic violence case. 

Children In The Protective Order Process 

ill the judge determine temporary custody of our children? 

The judge may determine temporary custody of the children if he or she enters the protective order 
and there is not already an existing custody order from a previous case.  It is very important to alert 
the judge about a previous custody order.  The judge can decide a custody and visitation 
arrangement, entering an order that should keep everyone safe.  The custody provision of the 
protective order will be in effect for only one year.  The judge does not do a comprehensive analysis 
of what custody arrangement is in the best interests of the children which is required when someone 
files a custody or divorce case that deals with custody and visitation issues until the child is age 18. 

ill the court allow the respondent visitation with the children? 

Every case is different, but generally the judge will allow the respondent visitation with the children 
if both your safety and the children’s safety can be protected.  The judge may allow visitation with 
appropriate safeguards in place.

How can the visitation be structured to keep you safe? 

To limit safety concerns for you, all visitation transfers should occur away from your residence or 
the place where you will be present.  Before going to the hearing, be prepared with a suggested place 
for the transfer of the children so that the judge will write it into the protective order.  You can be 
creative and suggest what will work best for you and the children for the one year duration of the 
order.  Visitation transfers can occur at the residence of willing family members or friends, 
supermarkets, fast food restaurants, day care facilities, schools, and at the most extreme, police 
stations.  If it will make you feel safer, you can bring a third party with you during the transfer or 
have a willing third party do the transfer for you. 

ow can the visitation be structured to keep the children safe? 

Be prepared for the possibility that the judge is likely to allow some form of visitation unless he or 
she considers the respondent’s problems with the children to be very severe.  You can request that 
the visitation be structured to minimize the risks to the children. 

ou need to alert the judge about any concerns you have regarding visitation so that if the judge 

allows visitation, he or she will put appropriate safeguards in the order.  For example, if the 
respondent has a drug or alcohol problem, you need to describe how it has affected the children.  
Tell the court if the respondent has previously passed out when the children were in his or her care 
or has driven drunk with them in the car.  You can request that the respondent be prohibited from 
consuming any alcohol or drugs prior to or during the visits.  If you are concerned about drug and 
alcohol use at night or inappropriate exposure of the children to adult activities, you may also ask 
that there be no overnight visitation. 

f the respondent has physically or sexually abused the children, you must describe the incidents to 
the judge.  Tell the judge if the respondent has inappropriately or excessively disciplined or spanked 
the children or if the respondent has been emotionally abusive to the children, providing specific 
examples.  Tell the judge if witnessing the abuse against you has caused the children to act out in the 
form of violence against other siblings or children, themselves, you, or pets.  Tell the judge if the 
respondent or the respondent’s family members are talking badly about you to the children.  You 
can ask the judge to prohibit the respondent from inappropriately disciplining the children or saying 
anything bad about you to them.  You can also request that the visitation only occur in a public or 
specified place if you are concerned about physical abuse to the children occurring in private. 

ay I request that the respondent have only supervised visitation? 

Yes.  If you believe that the respondent is a danger to the children and cannot be trusted to follow 
the order’s provisions during visitation, you may request that the court order the respondent to have 
only supervised visitation.  This means that the respondent can only visit with the children with a 
third party present during the entire visit.  Supervised visitation may be appropriate when the 
respondent has a history of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse of the children.  Describe to the 
judge specifically why supervised visitation is necessary for the children’s safety.  Come to court with 
the name of a willing family member or friend whom you trust to be the supervisor.  You should 
never be the supervisor for the visitation if you have a protective order.  If you cannot find anyone 
to supervise the visitation, you can ask the judge to allow visitation with a professional supervisor at 
the respondent’s expense.  Professional supervisors can be quite expensive or unavailable so the 
judge may be reluctant to order this type of supervision, finding it a barrier for visitation between 

 

  H

  Y

  I

  M

the respondent and the children.  Some locations offer supervised visitation programs at reduced 
rates so check with your local court to see if this is an option. 

hould I come to court with a specific visitation schedule? 

Yes.  It is a good idea to come to court with a specific visitation schedule that will work for you and 
the children for the one year duration of the order and which will allow the respondent reasonable 
visitation.  Offer specific days and times for the visitation.  Anticipate any holidays or special 
occasions which will arise during the order and you can specifically request that you have the 
children on some of those days in the event that they fall on the respondent’s regularly scheduled 
visitation days.  Remember that it is easier to increase visitation by modifying the protective order if 
the situation is working well than to decrease visitation without good documentation of problems.  
Additionally, if you plan to file for divorce or custody, the judge may look to the visitation 
arrangement in the protective order as guidance in deciding what is reasonable visitation in the more 
permanent divorce or custody case. 

ow can we communicate about the children while there is a no contact 

order? 

  H

It may be helpful to ask the judge to include in the protective order the name of a third party as a 
contact through whom you and the respondent can communicate regarding the children.  Make sure 
before the hearing that the third party is willing to assume this role before you suggest this to the 
judge.  This third party is useful if visitation must be cancelled or rescheduled because of unforeseen 
situations.  If you feel comfortable talking with the respondent about the children, you can request 
that the order limit communication to discussing only the children and even specify which issues are 
appropriate to discuss like just schooling or illness.  You should specify how you want to 
communicate:  by telephone, text or e-mail. 

f the respondent is not supposed to contact me, how can the respondent 
communicate with the children while they are in my care? 

Most protective orders contain provisions that prohibit the respondent from contacting the victim.  
However, you may tell the judge that the respondent can contact the children by phone, text, email, 
Skype, Facetime or letters if you are comfortable with that.  You can request that this contact be 
limited though.  For example, you can ask that the order state that the respondent can call the 
children on specified days of the week at specified times and speak for a specified amount of time.  
That way you are not surprised by answering the phone and finding the respondent on the other end 
of the line. 

ho has custody after the protective order expires? 

After the protective order expires, there will be no custody order in effect unless there is a custody 
order from a divorce or custody case.  Without a custody order, both parents have legal rights to the 
children.  Without a custody order, one parent can refuse to return a child and the police will not 
assist the other parent in having the child returned.  To avoid a time period when there is no custody 
order in effect, consider filing a separate permanent custody action in superior court well in advance 
of the date your protective order will expire.  If you are not married, you would file a custody case; if 
you are married, you would file for divorce and deal with the custody issues through that case.

ow does domestic violence impact the custody decision in divorce or custody 

cases? 

On July 1, 2004, the custody and visitation law has changed in custody and divorce cases when one 
or both parents has a “history of domestic violence”.  Under the law, the parent with a history of 
domestic violence may not get custody or visitation.  However, the parent may get supervised 
visitation and some custody or unsupervised visitation if he or she meets specific legal requirements. 

f there is any history of domestic violence in your relationship, talk with a lawyer about how this 
law will impact your custody or divorce case.   

Financial Issues 

ay I request that the respondent pay child support? 

Yes.  If the judge gives you temporary custody of the children, you are entitled to child support 
from the non-custodial parent which is based on a formula set by law.  You must ask the judge for 
child support in the petition and again when you appear at the hearings.  Some judges award child 
support when you get the ex parte order, although some prefer to wait until the other party has the 
opportunity to be heard at the long term protective order hearing. 

rior to your long-term protective order hearing, fill out the DR-305 form, for temporary child 

support.  It is available from the court or at 
http://www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#support.  You need to fill out all of the 
information for yourself, as the petitioner, and you can also provide the respondent’s information if 
you know it. 

ou must sign the DR-305 form in the presence of a notary public which is available at the court for 

free, and present picture ID.  Present the form to the judge at the hearing, along with three recent 
pay stubs, if you are employed, and your most recent tax return if you have it.  Ask the judge to 
order the respondent to provide income information to the court.  After receiving both parties’ 
forms, the judge should enter a child support amount that the non-custodial parent must pay and 
notify the parties by mail.  If the respondent has not provided income information, you can notify 
the judge by filling out a request to modify form, DV-131 (one petitioner), DV-131 (multiple 
petitioners).  This form is available at the court or at: 
http://www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#dv. 

ou also need to fill out a DR-315 form if you want the Child Support Services Division (CSSD) to 

process the child support.  This form is available at the court or at 
https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-315.pdf.  CSSD is a free accounting agency 
which keeps track of payments made and has the power to garnish the respondent’s wages and 
Permanent Fund Dividend checks. 
May I request that the respondent pay spousal support? 

Yes.  The judge may grant you spousal support if you are married to the respondent or in a 
marriage-type relationship and the respondent has been financially supporting you.  It is helpful if 
you provide proof of your expenses and bring copies of bills such as your mortgage or rent 

18

payment, utility bills, car payments, insurance premium, etc.  If a divorce case has been filed or will 
be filed shortly, the judge may not want to spend much time on financial issues, preferring that they 
be dealt with in the divorce case. 

ay I request that the respondent pay for my medical bills and items he 

damaged? 

Yes.  You can request that the judge order the respondent to reimburse you for medical expenses 
associated with the domestic violence.  Provide the judge with copies of the bills and the total 
amount due.  You can also request the judge to order the respondent to reimburse you for items 
damaged during the domestic violence.  Provide the judge with repair bills or estimates and the total 
cost of the damaged items. 

Contact/Communication Restrictions 

ill the respondent be allowed to contact me? 

Generally, the judge will prohibit the respondent from contacting the petitioner, but may allow some 
contact if the petitioner states it is acceptable.  Often, victims want no communication with the 
respondent.  Some victims agree to limited communication if they feel it is necessary to deal with 
specific issues such as a divorce or custody case.  If you agree to any communication, specify exactly 
what type of communication and how much you feel is acceptable so that it will be written in the 
protective order.  For example, you can specify 

• 

• 

• 

• 

the method of communication such as only by phone, text,   e-mail or through a 
specified third party; 

the exact times and duration when communication is permitted such as “Tuesday nights 
at 8 p.m. for one half hour”; 

the specific subjects that are permitted to be discussed such as “only the children” or 
“only issues in the divorce case”; 

the location where the communication can occur such as “only in a public place” or a 
specifically stated location. 

f you choose to allow some communication, think about how to construct appropriate limits so 
that you feel safe and free of intimidation.  Remember that it is perfectly appropriate to ask the 
judge to order no communication if that is what you want. 

ay I get possession of the residence? 

The law provides that the petitioner may get possession of a joint residence and that the respondent 
be excluded from the residence, regardless of which party owns or rents it.  You must request to stay 
in the home if that is what you want.  You may want to request that the respondent continue to pay 
all or some part of the house mortgage or rent and utilities if the respondent has provided the 
financial support for the residence prior to the protective order.  Give the judge recent copies of the 
house bills and a total dollar amount necessary to keep all the bills current.

ay I get possession of a vehicle? 

You may request and get possession of a vehicle, regardless of who owns it.  However, you must 
have a current driver’s license and the court may question whether you have car insurance.  The 
court will usually give you only one vehicle if there are two vehicles.  If the respondent has been 
responsible for the insurance and payments prior to the protective order, you can ask the judge to 
order the respondent to continue making all or part of these payments, supplying the judge with 
documentation of the amounts requested. 

Counseling And Treatment 

ill the court order the respondent to go to counseling? 

If you request that the judge order the respondent to go to a batterer’s intervention program, the 
judge may order that if a program is available.  These are programs where the abuser learns about 
the dynamics of domestic violence, accepts responsibility for his or her actions, and learns skills in 
anger management.  It is a good idea to ask the judge to order the respondent to check in with the 
program within five days so that you have a certain date after which you can check to see if the 
respondent is in compliance with the protective order.  The program will disclose the status of the 
respondent’s compliance only to the petitioner.  If the respondent has not checked in by the time 
stated in the protective order, you can ask the program to alert the judge of the respondent’s 
noncompliance. 

ill the court order the respondent to go to alcohol or drug treatment? 

If you request alcohol or drug treatment for the respondent, the judge may order the respondent to 
be assessed for alcohol or drug problem and go to treatment if necessary.  If you believe the 
respondent has a drug or alcohol problem, you must specifically describe why you think he or she 
has a problem and whether you have concerns about visitation with the children.  For example, tell 
the judge things such as if the respondent drinks daily, passes out when caring for the children, 
drives drunk, or has a criminal record for drugs and/or alcohol. 

What To Expect After Receiving A Long Term Protective Order 

rotective orders may be very effective in stopping domestic violence.  They can contain a wide 
range of legal protections for you and your children.  There may be serious consequences to the 
respondent if he or she does not follow the order’s provision. 

t is important, however, to recognize the limitations of a protective order.  It is most effective when 
both parties follow its provisions.  You must be vigilant in enforcing the order’s provisions by 
reporting every violation to the police department or the court.  You must continue to use safety 
planning and good sense after receiving the order.  Consider getting counseling for yourself and the 
children to understand the impact of being in an abusive relationship.  Advocates can assist in 
designing a safety plan and provide counseling services.  A list of shelters, victims’ services and 
resource programs is found at the end of this booklet and at http://www.andvsa.org/communities-

Special Issues For Immigrant Victims Of Domestic Violence 

ill I be deported if I report domestic violence to the police, a medical worker, 

or file for a protective order? 

No.  You will not be deported if you contact the police or you go to the hospital to seek medical 
care for your injuries.  You will also not be deported if you go to the courthouse and seek a 
protective order.  You can ask for a protective order or help from the police no matter what your 
immigration status is.  If a police officer or a judge asks you your immigration status, you are not 
required to give them this information. 

an I receive a green card if I am a married victim of domestic violence but my 

spouse has not filed the immigration paperwork for me? 

Yes.  If you are married to a person who has a green card or is a citizen of the United States and you 
are a victim of domestic violence, you can apply for a green card without the assistance of your 
spouse.  If you do not know if your spouse has a green card or is a United States citizen, you still 
may be able to apply for a green card.  It is very important that you get legal advice from an 
immigration attorney as soon as possible.  Talk to an immigration attorney or call the Alaska 
Immigration Justice Project at 279-2457. 

f I am an immigrant, should I ask the court for special orders in the protective 
order? 
You can ask the court to order the respondent to: 

 

  W

  C

  I

•  not contact the Department of Homeland Security 
•  not withdraw any immigration documents submitted on the petitioner’s behalf 
•  give the petitioner copies of all immigration documents submitted on the petitioner’s 

behalf 

•  not take the children out of Alaska 
•  give the petitioner or the court passports for petitioner and the children 
•  give the petitioner copies of the following documents which may be needed for a future 

immigration proceeding 
○  marriage certificate 
○  spouse’s birth certificate 
○  spouse’s green card if spouse is a lawful permanent resident 
○  any rent receipts or utility bills that are addressed to you and your spouse 
○  any divorce decrees if your spouse was previously married 
 

21 

 

 

Also, you can ask for spousal support if you can’t work or receive public assistance benefits because 
of your immigration status. Contact an immigration attorney or the Alaska Immigration Justice 
Project at 279-2457. 

ill the court system provide an interpreter if I need one? 

Yes. The court system will provide you with an interpreter in court if you have difficulty speaking 
and understanding English.  If you ask the judge for an interpreter, and the judge finds that you 
need an interpreter, the judge will place a phone call to an interpreter who will interpret over the 
phone for you. 

he court system will also provide interpreters if you are disabled and need an interpreter to 
communicate.  For example, the court system will provide you with an American Sign Language 
interpreter if you are deaf or hard of hearing and know sign language. 

ell the clerk at the court when you file for the protective order and they will note that you need an 

interpreter so the court can arrange for the interpreter in advance. 

Modifications 

hat is a modification? 

After the court has granted either the ex parte protective order or long-term protective order, the 
petitioner or the respondent may need to request that the order be changed.  Only the judge has the 
power to modify the order.  The parties cannot change the order simply by agreeing outside of the 
legal process.  Even if both parties agree to change part of the order, they must still go through the 
legal system.  The change is not enforceable unless it is reflected in an order modified by the court.  
This means that the police and court will not help you to enforce a change unless you modified 
through the court.  Allowing the respondent to ignore one part of the order could encourage 
violations of other parts. 

ow do I modify my protective order? 

To modify a protective order, file a Request to Modify a Protective Order, DV-131 (one petitioner) 
or DV-131-M (multiple petitioner). This form is available at the court and at 
http://www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#dv.  Fill in the caption with the names of the 
parties and case number exactly as they are written on the original order.  Explain how you want the 
order changed. 

or example, you could write that you want to change the current order that allows “reasonable 

visitation” with the children to “visitation with specified hours from Saturday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and 
Wednesday, 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.”  You will also need to state why you want the order changed.  For 
example, in a request to have specific visitation times, the reason might be that “without a specific 
time schedule, I am unable to predict when the respondent will show up because the respondent 
comes at different times without warning.  Specified times will be emotionally easier on the children 
and safer for all family members.”  You must sign and date the request, and give a current mailing 
address and phone number.  Tell the judge if you want your address and phone number to be kept 
confidential.

ow do I respond to the other side’s request to modify my protective order? 

You can file a Response to Request to Modify or Dissolve Protective Order, DV-140 (one 
petitioner) or DV-140-M (multiple petitioners).  Fill in the caption with the names of the parties and 
case number exactly as they are written on the original order and state whether you agree or disagree 
with the request and explain why. 

ill there be a hearing on a request to modify? 

If the request is made to modify an ex parte protective order, the court may schedule a hearing on 3 
days’ notice.  If the request is made to modify a long term protective order, the judge may schedule a 
hearing within 20 days of the request.  The judge may allow the respondent the chance to respond to 
the request in writing by filling out: Response to Request to Modify or Dissolve Protective Order, 
DV-140 (one petitioner) or DV-140-M (multiple petitioners).   

he judge may deny the request without a hearing by finding it has no merit.  If the judge does not 

hold a hearing, you will receive an order in the mail telling you the judge’s decision.  If the judge 
holds a hearing, he or she may decide the request in court and give you a written order granting or 
denying your request.  Sometimes the judge issues a decision after the hearing, notifying the parties 
by mail.  If there is a hearing and you live far from the courthouse, you can ask the court to 
participate by phone.  To request to appear by phone, fill out: Request to Appear by Telephone, TF-
710. 

n order to be notified of all hearings scheduled in the case, it is very important to inform the clerk 
at the court if you change your address. 

Violations And Enforcement 

hat is a violation? 

The respondent violates the protective order if the respondent has been served with it (or has 
knowledge of it) and purposefully violates the order’s provisions.  For example, if the order 
prohibits the respondent from contacting you and the respondent comes to your home or work 
place, that is a violation. 

hat do I do if the respondent violates my protective order? 

If the respondent violates the provisions of your protective order, report the violations to the 
appropriate authority.  Alert the police if criminal parts of the order are violated and alert the judge 
if civil parts of the order are violated. 

hich parts of the order are criminal violations? 

It is a misdemeanor crime to violate certain parts of the protective order.  Since each order is 
different, here are some examples of criminal violations: 

•  committing or threatening to commit domestic violence; 
•  violating provisions that prohibit contact; refusing to leave the home; 

23

  W

  T

  I

   

  W

  W

•  entering or following the victim's vehicle; and 
•  not returning children after visitation. 

f the respondent is arrested for violating an order, the State District Attorney’s Office will 
prosecute the respondent if there is enough evidence.  The respondent may be sent to jail for up to 
one year and ordered to pay a fine if convicted. 

hich parts of the order are civil violations? 

If the respondent does not follow certain provisions of the order, the respondent may be 
committing civil violations.  This means that the judge may hold the respondent in “contempt of 
court” for such violations.  Examples of civil violations are the respondent: 

refuses to attend counseling, 

refuses to pay child support, 

refuses to reimburse medical bills, or 

refuses to deliver certain personal property to you. 

ou must report such violations to the judge to get further relief in a Motion to Modify.  

Modifications are discussed in the previous section of this booklet. 

ho should I contact when the respondent violates my protective order? 

If the violation is a crime, call the local police, the Alaska State Troopers, or the VPSO, depending 
where you live.  When you make the call, state that there is a protective order in effect, give the 
court case number, and describe the violation.  Ask for the police officer’s name and a report 
number and write this information down because you may need it later.  If there is also a criminal 
case going on against the respondent from the original incident of domestic violence, call the 
prosecutor involved in that case. 

If the violation is not a crime, but affects you and the usefulness of the protective order, such as the 
respondent’s failure to pay child support or attend counseling, tell the court.  There are two ways to 
do this: 

1.  File a Motion to Modify and ask the judge to change the order in a way that you want 

because the respondent is not following the original order, or 

2.  Ask the court to hold the respondent in contempt for failing to follow the court 

order.

If the judge finds the respondent willfully disobeyed the civil parts of the protective order, the 
respondent may be found “in contempt of court” and ordered to pay a fine or to go to jail.  This

may happen if the respondent has not paid medical bills, spousal support, child support, complied 
with drug and/or alcohol treatment, or attended an anger management program. 

o alert the judge of the civil violations, you need to file a “Motion for Order to Show Cause.”  

Contact a private attorney or Alaska Legal Services if there is an office near you who may be able to 
assist you with this matter.  If you want to file the motion yourself, you can get more information 
about motions at http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/motions.htm or call the Family Law Self-
Help Center help line at (907) 264-0851 or toll free at (866) 279-0851 using an Alaska-based phone 
from outside of Anchorage. 

f the judge finds that your motion has merit, he or she will send the respondent an “Order to Show 
Cause,” ordering the respondent to appear at a hearing to explain any violations of the protective 
order.  You will also need to appear to tell the judge what provision of the order the respondent 
violated and what remedy you want.  As a remedy, the judge may order the respondent to do what 
he or she was originally ordered or may restrict the respondent more than in the original order.  If 
the respondent fails to show up, the judge may issue a bench warrant for the respondent’s arrest. 

Extensions And Denials 

f I get a protective order, can I extend it after one year? 

Most provisions in long term protective orders expire after one year.  The provision that prohibits 
the respondent from threatening to commit or committing domestic violence is in effect indefinitely, 
until a judge rules otherwise. 

he petitioner can ask the court to extend a long term protective order for one year if it is necessary 
for his or her protection.  The petitioner can make the request within 30 days of when the order will 
expire or within 60 days after it expires by filing a Request to Extend Protective Order, DV-132 (one 
petitioner) or DV-132 (multiple petitioners).  This form is available at the court and at 
http://www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#dv.  Fill in the caption with the names of the 
parties and case number exactly as they are written on the original order.  Explain in writing why you 
want the order extended.   

he court will schedule a hearing in at least 10 days from when you file the request to extend and 
notify both the petitioner and the respondent of when the hearing will be held.  At the hearing, the 
petitioner will provide information about why an extension is necessary for his or her protection and 
the judge will also hear from the respondent.  If the judge grants the extension, it will be for one 
year and include either the same provisions as the previous long term protective order, or changes 
based on the petitioner’s request.  You can request another extension is you feel you still need 
protection after the new order expires. 

f the initial long term protective order expires before the judge grants an extension, there will be no 
protective order in effect during that time in between.  The petitioner should plan how to keep safe.  
Contact an advocate to help with safety planning.  Find information on safety plans at 
http://www.andvsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Personalized-Safety-Plan.pdf.  Please see 
the list of shelters, victims’ services and resource programs at the end of this booklet.

What happens if the judge denies the protective order? 

If the judge does not find enough evidence to grant a long-term protective order, the case will be 
dismissed and there will be no order in place.  You need to prepare for this situation before you go 
to the hearing.  For example, if the respondent has been excluded from the family residence during 
the ex parte order and your request for a long term protective order was denied, you must be 
prepared for the respondent to move back in and should arrange for alternative housing for yourself 
and children or go to a shelter.  If you feel you are unable to return home, you may want to have a 
suitcase packed prior to the hearing, including things for you and the children such as clothing and 
toiletries, important documents, prescription medication, eyeglasses, check books, credit cards, and 
some money if possible.  Contact an advocate to help you with safety planning.  Find information 
on safety plans at http://www.andvsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Personalized-Safety-
Plan.pdf.  Please see the list of shelters, victims’ services and resource programs at the end of this 
booklet. 

Protective Orders Issued In Another State 

ill the police and court in Alaska enforce my protective order if the order is 

from another state? 

The police and court system in Alaska will enforce an unexpired protective order that was issued by 
a court in another state if you file it with the Alaska court.  You may need a certified copy of your 
unexpired protective order from the other state. 

he police, the local court, an advocate, a private attorney, or Alaska Legal Services may also be able 

to assist you with this matter.  You can also contact the Family Law Self-Help Center help line to 
understand how to register your out-of-state order in Alaska.  Call (907) 264-0851 or toll free in 
Alaska but outside Anchorage at (866) 279-0851. 

Dissolving A Protective Order 

ow do I dissolve a protective order? 

If the petitioner wants to end a protective order, file a Request Dissolve a Protective Order, DV-133 
(one petitioner) or DV-133 (multiple petitioners).  This form is available at the court and at 
http://www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#dv.  Fill in the caption with the names of the 
parties and case number exactly as they are written on the original order.  Explain why you want to 
end the order.   

f the petitioner asks the court to dissolve the order, the court will dissolve the order and its 
provisions will no longer be in effect.  Sometimes courts have a hearing to determine whether the 
petitioner really filed the request, or the court wants to determine if there is any undue influence, 
coercion etc. 

f the respondent wants to dissolve a protective order and files a Request to Dissolve a Protective 
Order before the long term hearing has been held, the court will usually deny the request and tell the

respondent to wait until the hearing to present the respondent’s side of the story.  If the Request to 
Dissolve is filed after the long term hearing, the judge will decide whether a hearing is necessary to 
hear from both parties regarding the issues raised by the respondent. The judge may decide the 
Request to Dissolve has no merit and the order will remain in effect. 

ow do I respond to the other side’s request to dissolve my protective order? 

You can file a Response to Request to Modify or Dissolve Protective Order, DV-140 (one 
petitioner) or DV-140-M (multiple petitioners).  Fill in the caption with the names of the parties and 
case number exactly as they are written on the original order and state whether you agree or disagree 
with the request and explain why.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
