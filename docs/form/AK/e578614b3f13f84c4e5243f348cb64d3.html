FOR SPOUSES FILING TOGETHER 
WHEN THERE ARE MINOR CHILDREN OF THE MARRIAGE 

NOTICE 

Parents with children may not be granted a hearing on a petition for dissolution 
until  both  parents  have  completed  their  parent  education  requirement.    See 
page 3 for further instructions. 

Court  staff  generally  can  inform  you  about  court  procedures,  court  rules, 
court  records,  and forms.    Court  staff  must  remain neutral  and  impartial.  
They are not allowed to give legal advice. Court staff cannot: 

  advise you how statutes and rules apply to your case, 
•  tell you whether the documents you prepare properly present your case, 
•  tell you what the best procedures are to accomplish a particular objective, 

or  

•  interpret laws for you. 

 

If you need help with your case, you should talk to a lawyer. 

any of the agreements you will make in your petition for dissolution 
will  have  tax  consequences  (including  agreements  about  property 
division,  spousal  maintenance,  child  custody  and  child  support).    It  is 
very important that you get an accountant's or attorney's advice about 
these tax consequences before making your agreement.

Dissolution of Marriage 

 decree of dissolution of marriage has the same force and effect as a decree of divorce.  
However, the procedures for getting a dissolution are somewhat different than those for 
a divorce.  Dissolution procedures are described in Alaska Statutes 25.24.200 - .260 and 
Civil Rule 90.1.  Divorce procedures are described in Alaska Statutes 25.24.010 -.180 and 
Civil Rule 90.1.

DR-10 (3/23) 
INSTRUCTIONS – DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE FOR SPOUSES (WITH CHILDREN) 

Either  spouse (Party A or Party B)  or both  spouses  must be  domiciled in Alaska.  That 
means the person claims residency in Alaska.  The person must be physically present in 
Alaska and intend to remain indefinitely.   No  minimum number of days of residency  is 
required.  In addition, military personnel who do not claim to be Alaska residents may file 
for dissolution if they have been continuously stationed at a military base or installation 
in Alaska for at least 30 days.  AS 25.24.900. 

The court must have jurisdiction over the minor children of the marriage (children under 
age 18) in one of the ways described in AS 25.30.300.  This generally means the children 
(a) must have lived in Alaska at least six consecutive months and (b) must currently live 
in Alaska or must have lived in Alaska within six months before the case is filed. 

Both  spouses  must  agree  that  "incompatibility  of  temperament  has  caused  the 
irremediable breakdown of the marriage."  This means there is no chance of saving the 
marriage because the spouses cannot get along.  The marriage has broken down and the 
spouses no longer want to be married. 

The spouses must both agree on all of the following: 

a. 
b. 
c. 

d. 

e. 
f. 

g. 

custody of each minor child of the marriage, 
visitation (including visitation by grandparents and other persons), 
child support (including whether or not the services of the Child Support Services 
Division will be requested), 
distribution of all real property and personal marital property (both jointly owned 
and  separately  owned,  and  community  property  under  AS  34.77),  including 
retirement benefits, 
payment of spousal maintenance (alimony), if any, 
payment of all existing debts owed by either or both spouses, and payment of any 
debts that may be incurred jointly in the future, and 
the tax consequences of all the above agreements. 

The property and spousal maintenance agreements must be fair and just and must take 
into consideration the factors listed in AS 25.24.160(a)(2) and (4) so that the economic 
effect of the dissolution is fairly allocated. 

f you cannot meet one or more of these requirements, contact a lawyer to find out what your 
options are.

REQUIREMENTS 

  

The requirements for using dissolution procedure are: 

Page 2 of 19 
DR-10 (3/23) 
INSTRUCTIONS – DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE FOR SPOUSES (WITH CHILDREN) 

The Alaska Court System requires parents to complete a parent education requirement. 
Most courts require viewing an approved video or completing an online internet class. 

The parent education requirement for you will depend on your court location. The 
requirements for each location are listed here: 
https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/shcparent-ed.htm 
 
Fill out the following three forms attached to these instructions (and available online): 

Form  DR-105,  Petition  for  Dissolution  of  Marriage  (with  Children).    See  the 
instructions beginning on page 6.  If you want “shared” custody, you will also have 
to fill out form DR-306 (included in this packet and available online) and attach it 
to  the petition.    For  “divided”  custody,  attach  DR-307  instead;  and  for  “hybrid” 
custody, attach DR-308.  Neither DR-307 nor DR-308 are included in this packet.  
You  can  get 
the  court  website  at 
the  court  or  on 
http://courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#dr.  See  the  discussion  of  physical 
custody on page 11 for definitions of these terms. 

them  at 

Form DR-314, Information Sheet. 

Form  VS-401,  Certificate  of  Divorce,  Dissolution  of  Marriage  or  Annulment.  
Complete the “Parties’ Information” block, lines 11-30.  If you make a mistake, get 
a new form from the court.  This form will be sent to the Health Analytics and Vital 
Records office after the dissolution is granted, and they will not accept forms with 
cross-outs,  whiteouts,  or  other  corrections  on  them.    Health  Analytics  and  Vital 
Records also will not accept photocopies of the VS-401 form. 

 
File these three forms at the clerk's office and pay the filing fee according to Administrative 
Rule  9(b).    If  you  cannot  afford  this  fee,  ask  the  clerk  for  form  TF-920,  Request  for 
Exemption from Payment of Fees. 

Note:  Once the petition is signed by the first party signing it, you have only 60 days to 
file it with the court.  If you delay filing beyond that date, the court will not accept it.  Civil 
Rule 90.1. 

Ask the clerk's office for instructions on setting a hearing date.  The hearing must be at 
least 30 days after the date the petition is filed.  It will be set for a time acceptable to 
both parties. 

Amendment or Withdrawal of Petition. 

After the petition is filed, any of the terms of the petition may be amended if both parties 
agree and complete form DR-115, Amendment of Agreement, and file it with the court. 

If  either  spouse  wants  to  withdraw  from  the  agreement,  that  spouse  must  file  form  
DR-120,  Withdrawal  of  Agreement,  with  the  court  before  the  decree  is  signed.    If  the 
agreement is withdrawn, the case will be dismissed. 

If you decide to use either of these forms, be sure to fill in the case number which the 
court clerk assigned to your petition.

To get a decree dissolving your marriage, you must do the following: 

PROCEDURE TO FOLLOW 
 

Page 3 of 19 
DR-10 (3/23) 
INSTRUCTIONS – DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE FOR SPOUSES (WITH CHILDREN) 

Both parties must ordinarily attend the hearing.  If it would be a significant hardship for 
a party to attend, that party must fill out and sign form DR-110, Appearance and Waiver 
of Notice of Hearing (included in this packet), acknowledge it before a court clerk or notary 
public  and  file  it  with  the  court.    The  court  will  then  decide  whether  the  hardship  is 
significant enough to allow the party not to appear.  If the court allows the party not to 
appear  in person,  the  court  may  still  require  the  party  to  be  available  by  telephone  to 
answer questions during the hearing.  The absent party may be required to pay the costs 
of the telephone call.  At least one party must always attend the hearing. 

Each party may have a lawyer at the hearing but you are not required to have one. 

At the hearing, the court will ask questions to determine whether you fully understand the 
nature  and  consequences  of  the  proceeding;  whether  the  terms  of  all  your  written 
agreements are fair and just; whether your written agreements concerning the children 
are in the best interests of the children; and whether all the requirements listed on page 
2 have been met. 

The  judge  may  amend  the  agreements  between  the  spouses,  but  only  if  both  parties 
agree in writing (or in person at the hearing) with the amendment. 

At some court locations, hearings are held before a Superior Court Master instead of a 
judge.  A master cannot grant a decree.  A master can only recommend to a judge whether 
or not a decree should be granted. 

The Decree. 

Although in some cases the decree may be granted at the hearing (if the hearing is before 
a judge rather than a master), usually the decree is not entered until a few days later.  
Do not assume a decree has been granted until you receive your copy. 

You must carry out any agreements made in your petition or otherwise required by the 
decree.    This  might  include,  for  example,  transferring  title  to  property or  notifying  the 
administrator of a retirement plan about the effect of the decree on a spouse's retirement 
benefits.  You will probably need to contact a lawyer to prepare the necessary deeds and 
other legal documents to make these transfers.  The court does not do this for you. 

Changes in Child Support. 

If  your  circumstances  change  in  the  future,  you  may  file  a  motion  asking  the  court  to 
change the child support order.  The court may order an increase or a decrease in the 
amount  of  support  based  on  these  changed  circumstances.    The  court  may  order  this 
change even if one of the parties does not agree.  See Civil Rule 90.3(h) about modification 
of child support orders.  A packet of forms for this is available at the court (DR-700 Motion 
Packet). 

Also, you may at any time ask that child support be continued for an 18 year old who is 
(1) unmarried, (2) actively pursuing a high school diploma or equivalent level of technical 
or  vocational  training,  and  (3)  living  as  a  dependent  with  a  parent  or  guardian  or  a 
designee of the parent or guardian.  You may also ask that support for an 18 year old be 
paid directly to the 18 year old; or, if the 18 year old no longer meets the conditions listed 
above, you may ask that the support be stopped.  Forms and instructions are available at 
the court (DR-320 to DR-323).

You  must  agree  to  a  division  of  the  property  that  is  fair  and  just  to  both  spouses.  
Ordinarily, the fairest division of the property is an equal division.  However, there may 
be some circumstances, such as a marriage of very short duration, which would justify 
something other than an equal division of all items acquired during the marriage. 

Assets include all kinds of property and rights in property. "Real property" means buildings   
and    land.   "Personal    property"   includes things such as   pets,   jewelry, automobiles, 
boats, airplanes, snow machines, furniture, household goods, bank accounts, etc.  Other 
examples  of  assets  are  businesses,  contract  rights,  stocks,  bonds,  and  employment 
benefits  such  as  the  value  of  retirement  plans,  deferred  compensation,  accumulated 
employee leave time, 401(k) plans, and (for Alaska State employees) the Supplemental 
Benefits System annuity. 

Assets must be clearly identified.  Motor vehicles and other property requiring a certificate 
of  title  or  registration  must  be  identified  by  make,  model  and  license  or  registration 
number,  and/or  by  identification  number  (VIN,  HIN,  SN).    Bank,  credit  union  or  other 
financial institution accounts may be identified by the last 3 digits of the account number 
and the name of the financial institution.  Do not provide the full account number. 

Your  property  division  agreement  must  fairly  allocate  the  economic  effect  of  the 
dissolution.  It must take into consideration the following factors listed in Alaska Statute 
25.24.160(a)(4): 

the length of the marriage and station in life of the parties during the marriage; 

the age and health of the parties; 

the  earning  capacity  of  the  parties,  including  their  educational  backgrounds, 
training,  employment  skills,  work  experiences,  length  of  absence  from  the  job 
market, and custodial responsibilities for children during the marriage; 

the financial condition of the parties, including the availability and cost of health 
insurance; 

the  conduct  of  the  parties,  including  whether  there  has  been  unreasonable 
depletion of marital assets; 

the  desirability  of  awarding  the  family  home,  or  the  right  to  live  in  it  for  a 
reasonable  period  of  time,  to  the  party  who  has  primary  physical  custody  of 
children; 

the circumstances and necessities of each party; 

the time and manner of acquisition of the property in question; and 

the income-producing capacity of the property and the value of the property at 
the time of division. 

Note:  The court may not award to one spouse real or personal property acquired by the 
other  spouse  before  the  date  of  the  marriage,  unless  the  spouses  expressly  agree 
otherwise or the court determines that the property should be made available (by sale or 
other  conveyance)  to  ensure  that  the  best  interests  of  the  children  are  provided  for.

INSTRUCTIONS – DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE FOR SPOUSES (WITH CHILDREN) 

Part A.5.  Retirement Benefits (pages 6-7) 

ne special type of property which you must agree about is retirement benefits.  If, during your 
marriage, either spouse has accrued the right to someday receive retirement benefits as a result 
of employment or military service, you will need to decide how to divide the value of those benefits 
between you.  You ordinarily need to do this even if the employee spouse has not yet "vested" 
in the retirement program. 
 

You will probably need the help of an attorney and/or the administrator 
of  the  retirement  plan.    You  should  obtain  and  review  any  available 
written summary of the retirement plan and a statement of the value of 
the employee's expected benefits. 

enerally, you can divide these benefits in either of two ways: 

You can let the current owner of the benefits (the covered employee) keep the benefits 
and give the other spouse cash or other assets worth half the current value of the part of 
the benefits accrued during the marriage.  This, of course, requires you to figure out what 
the current value of the benefits is.  You may need the help of an actuary to do this. 

Or,  you  can  give  the  non-employee  spouse  the  right  to  receive  part  of  the  retirement 
benefits when those benefits are eventually paid out.  Under this option, it is not necessary 
to figure out the current value of the benefits.  Both spouses will have to wait to receive 
any payments until the employee spouse is eligible to receive the benefits.   

If you choose this option, in most cases your agreement must meet the requirements of 
a "qualified domestic relations order" (QDRO) as that term is defined in the statutes which 
apply to the retirement plan.*  Also, your agreement, along with the dissolution decree, 
must be filed with and accepted by the administrator of the retirement plan before it will 
be effective.  It is important to contact the administrator of the retirement plan before 
filing your written agreement with the court and request copies of the plan, procedures 
for QDRO's, and any forms the plan administrator may have prepared. 

 

 

Note:  The requirements for dividing military retirement pay are different.  A QDRO is not 
required.  The Uniform Services Former Spouses’ Protection Act (10 U.S.C. 1408) describes 
the procedure that must be followed in order for the former spouse to receive payment 
directly from the government.  (For example, the spouse’s agreement must show that the 
spouses were married to each other for 10 or more years during which time the military 
member  performed  at  least  10  years  of  creditable  service.    The  agreement  must 
specifically  provide  for  payment  of  an  amount  from  the  military  member's  "disposable 
retired pay" to the former spouse.  The amount must be stated either in dollars or as a 
percentage of the member's disposable retired pay.)  For more information about what is 
required and about the application form you must fill out and submit after you obtain your 
dissolution  decree  (DD Form  2293),  contact  the Legal  Assistance  Office at  any  military 
installation  in  Alaska.    If  you  do  not  meet  the  “10/10”  requirement,  any  retirement 
payments that you agree should be made to the former spouse would have to be made 
by  the  military  member  instead  of  coming  directly  to  the  former  spouse  from  the 
government.

You will have to write your retirement benefits agreement on a separate piece of paper 
and attach it to your petition.  It will have to include the basic requirements of a QDRO, 
which are: 

It must name the retirement plan or program. 

It must give the right to receive part or all of the benefits payable with respect to 
the employee covered by the plan to an "alternate payee" (meaning, in this case, 
the other spouse). 

It must state the name and last known mailing address of both the employee and 
the "alternate payee." 

It  must  state  the  amount  or  percentage  of  the  employee's  benefit,  or  of  any 
survivor's benefit, to be paid to the "alternate payee"; or it must set out the manner 
in which that amount or percentage is to be determined. 

It  must  set  out  the  number  of  payments  or  period  of  time  to  which  the 
agreement/order applies. 

It must not do any of the following:

require any type or form of benefit or any option not otherwise provided

plan, determined on the basis of actuarial value, or 

require the payment to an alternate payee of benefits that are required to 
be paid to another alternate payee under a previous QDRO. 

Depending on the type of retirement plan, there may be several other requirements or 
items which should be covered by the agreement and order.  Because retirement plans 
vary, contact the administrator of your plan to make sure all the required information is 
included in your agreement. 

In order to write an agreement  which will be enforceable, you will most likely  need to 
consult with an attorney who is familiar with the laws about QDRO's.  You may also be 
able to get assistance from the administrator of the retirement plan.  Remember that your 
agreement is not effective until it and the decree are filed with that administrator and you 
have received notice that it is accepted.  If it is not accepted, you will have to go back to 
court to get an order correcting any defects. 

If  you  are  submitting  a  proposed  QDRO,  or  any  similar  order  requiring  the 
social security numbers of the beneficiary and alternate payee, you must also 
submit a copy of the original proposed order with the social security numbers 
of  the  beneficiary  and  alternate  payee  completely  marked  out.    The  original 
proposed order is confidential and will not be part of the public record.  Only 
the duplicate with the social security numbers blacked out will become part of 
the public case file. 

Some of the statutes about QDRO's are:  AS 25.24.230(h) and 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3).

Part B.  Debts (page 7)  
 

Describe all debts of both parties.  Debts include all kinds of financial obligations, such as 
loans, credit card, bank card, or debit card account balances, the mortgage on your house, 
etc. 

List  to  whom  each  debt  is  owed  and  the  amount  owed.   When  identifying  credit  card, 
bank card or debit card accounts, you may list the last 4 digits of the  account and the 
name of the issuing institution.  Do not provide the full account number.  Check the box 
showing whether the debt was incurred during the marriage and the box showing who 
owes the debt (Party A, Party B, or jointly owed).  Then check the box showing who you 
agree will be responsible for paying the debt. 

ach spouse is responsible for his or her separate debts unless you agree otherwise. 

The two of you may agree which spouse will pay each joint debt (debt in both parties' 
names).  However, although this agreement will be binding against the two of you, it will 
not  be  binding  against  the  people  to  whom  the  debts  are  owed  because  they  are  not 
parties  in  this  case.    For  joint  debts,  both  of  you  will  remain  legally  obligated  to  your 
creditors until the existing debt is paid, regardless of your agreement as to who will pay 
the debt.   

In addition, if both your names are on a mortgage or other debt, you may not be able to 
get new loans or credit.  You may want to consider refinancing these debts to put them 
only in the name of the party responsible for paying them. 

To protect yourselves against future debts the other party may incur on credit cards and 
other  open  accounts,  you  may  want  to  close  your  current  joint  charge  accounts  and 
reopen them in your separate names. 

ection IV.  SPOUSAL MAINTENANCE (ALIMONY) (page 7) 

Petitioners  may  agree  to  the  payment  of  spousal  maintenance  (alimony).    Spousal 
maintenance  payments  must  be  included  as  income  on  the  tax  return  of  the  spouse 
receiving the payments.  Advice from an accountant or attorney may be helpful in regard 
to other tax consequences of spousal maintenance. 

Spousal  maintenance  payments  may be  for  a  limited or  indefinite  period  of  time.  The 
agreement  on  spousal  maintenance  must  fairly  allocate  the  economic  effect  of  the 
dissolution.  It must take into consideration the following factors listed in Alaska Statute 
25.24.160(a)(2): 

the length of the marriage and station in life of the parties during the marriage; 
the age and health of the parties; 
the  earning  capacity  of  the  parties,  including  their  educational  backgrounds, 
training,  employment  skills,  work  experiences,  length  of  absence  from  the  job 
market, and custodial responsibilities for children during the marriage; 
the financial condition of the parties, including the availability and cost of health 
insurance; 
the  conduct  of  the  parties,  including  whether  there  has  been  unreasonable 
depletion of marital assets; 
the division of property; and 
other factors the court determines to be relevant in each individual case.

Section V.  CHILD CUSTODY JURISDICTION INFORMATION (pages 8-9) 
 

ist all children born or adopted during the marriage who are currently under age 19. 

Most  of  the  information  in  this  section  is  required  by  AS  25.24.210(e)(4)  and 
AS 25.30.380.  The purpose of requiring this information is to make sure the children have 
adequate  contacts  with  this  state  to  give  Alaska  courts  the  power  to  order  who  gets 
custody of the children. 

If a party is pregnant, it is assumed that the child is a child of the marriage and must be 
provided for like all other children of the marriage.  If there is an issue of paternity of the 
child, it should be raised and resolved now.  (A husband is considered the legal father of 
a  child  conceived  or  born  during  a  marriage,  unless  the  affidavits  required  by  AS 
18.50.160(d) are executed, or until the husband's paternity is disestablished by a court or 
child support services agency.) 

If paternity is disputed or paternity has been disestablished for any child born during the 
marriage, check the corresponding box on the form.  For more information, contact an 
attorney or call the Family Law Self-Help Center at the Alaska Court System. 

ection VI.  CHILD CUSTODY AGREEMENT (page 10) 

You  must  agree  on  custody  arrangements  for  all  your  children  under  age  18.    In 
developing your agreements concerning child custody, visitation, and support, you must 
consider the best interests  of your children.  See  parenting agreement  forms  (DR-475, 
available online from the court) for examples of the issues you should think about when 
preparing your custody and visitation agreement. 

All other things being equal, parents each have an equal right to custody. 

There are two types of custody:  legal custody and physical custody. 

hared  legal  custody  means  that  both  parents  are  given  the  legal  authority  to 
make  decisions  about the  child.    They  share  responsibility  in  making  the  major 
decisions affecting the child’s welfare. (Bell v. Bell, 794 P.2d 97, 99 (Alaska 1990)) 

Alaska’s  legislature  has  expressed  a  policy  favoring  shared  legal  custody 
regardless of the physical custody arrangement.  The legislature has stated 
that “it is in the public interest to encourage parents to share the rights and 

 S

● 

egal custody means the right and obligation to make decisions about a child’s upbringing, 
including  schooling,  medical  care,  and  financial  matters.    There  are  two  types  of  legal 
custody: 
 

Sole legal custody means that only one parent is given the legal authority to make 
decisions about  the child.   If the parents  do  not  agree on a decision about the 
child, the parent with sole legal custody has the right to make the final decision.

responsibilities of child rearing”  and  that “it is the intent  of the legislature 
that  both parents have the opportunity to guide and nurture their child…”  
(section 1 chapter 88 SLA 1982) 

However,  shared  legal  custody  is  appropriate  only  when  the  parents  can 
cooperate  and  communicate  regarding  the  child.    If  the  parents  cannot 
discuss these matters cooperatively and share decision making, shared legal 
custody will not be awarded. (Farrell v. Farrell, 819 P.2d 896, 899 (Alaska 
1991)) 

Primary  physical  custody  means  that  the  children  reside  with  one  parent 
more than 70% of the year. 

Shared physical custody means that the children reside with each parent for 
a specified period of at least 30% of the year.  If you want shared physical 
custody, you must describe when the children will reside with each parent.  
If either parent is planning a move to another community in the near future, 
you should explain how shared custody will be continued after the move. 

Divided physical custody means that each parent has primary custody of at 
least one child, and the parents do not share custody of any of their children. 

Hybrid physical custody means at least one parent has primary custody of at 
least one of the children, and the parents share custody of at least one of 
their children. 

hysical custody means where a child actually lives.  As a general matter, it is very rare 

for a child to live with one parent 100% of the time. 

or  purposes  of  calculating  the  amount  of  child support,  Civil Rule  90.3 describes  four 

types of physical custody: 
 

Physical Custody 

 P

 F

In section VI of the petition, you must state who should be given physical custody and 
who should be given legal custody of the children.  

Shared  custody  arrangements  may  affect  your  and  your  children's  rights  to  public 
assistance and tax benefits.  You should obtain legal advice or otherwise make yourselves 
aware of these consequences before drafting a shared custody agreement.  You should 
also consider the consequences of shared custody if any of the following should happen:  
(1) one parent moves away, (2) the two of you later agree to change who has primary 
physical  custody  of  a  child,  or  (3)  the  two  of  you  cannot  agree  about  some  matter 
concerning a child.

Section VII.  VISITATION AGREEMENT (page 10)  
 

Visitation is the right of a parent and child to contact and visit one another when the child 
is residing or visiting with the other parent.  It is generally desirable that minor children 
have frequent and continuing contact with both parents so that both parents can maintain 
a  good  relationship  with  the  children  and  share  the  rights  and  responsibilities  of  child 
rearing. 

n order for the agreement to be enforceable in the future, specific visitation rights must 
be set out in the agreement.  

In the following two situations, you must be very specific about the dates of visitation if 
you intend the amount of visitation to change the amount of child support owed: 

Child Support Extended Visitation Credit.  This credit is available if one parent is 
given primary physical custody of the children (that is, the children reside with that 
parent more than 70% of the year), but the other parent has visitation with the 
children  (takes    physical  custody  of  them)  for  more  than  27  consecutive  days.  
Under Civil Rule 90.3(a)(3), the court may allow the parent who owes child support 
to reduce child support payments for any period in which that parent has extended 
visitation of over 27 consecutive days.  However, this reduction may not exceed 
75% of the amount owed for that period. 

Shared Physical Custody for Child Support Purposes.  Civil Rule 90.3(b) provides a 
special  method  of  calculating  child  support  where  both  parents  share  physical 
custody of the children, regardless of who has legal custody.  A parent has "shared 
physical custody" as defined in this rule only if "the children reside with that parent 
for a period specified in writing in the custody order of at least 30 percent of the 
year."  Civil Rule 90.3(f). 

o qualify for either of these two methods of reducing child support, you must specify the 
dates when the children will reside with the parent paying child support.  In addition, this 
parent must take physical custody at the times agreed.

Section VIII.  CHILD SUPPORT (page 11-16) 
 

Definitions: 

Obligor:  the person paying child support. 
Obligee: the person receiving the support on behalf of the children. 

Child support must be paid until the children reach age 18 or are otherwise emancipated, 
even if the parents might agree otherwise.  This includes support for children born after 
the dissolution if a party is pregnant before the dissolution.  Support is paid on behalf of 
the children, not for the benefit of the custodial parent.  Parents may also agree to include 
support for 18 year olds under certain circumstances.  See Part B.

DR-10 (3/23) 
INSTRUCTIONS – DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE FOR SPOUSES (WITH CHILDREN) 

In Civil Rule 90.3,  the Alaska Supreme Court has set  the guidelines which courts must 
follow to determine the amount of child support.  A copy of this rule may be viewed online 
at  https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/rules/docs/civ.pdf.    See  also  the  instruction 
booklet,  DR-310,  How  To  Calculate  Child  Support,  available  online  and  from  the  court 
clerks’ office.  You should read this booklet to help answer any questions you have about 
how to do the child support calculation in Part A of this section of the petition. 

Note that if you elect shared physical custody for child support purposes in paragraph 3.b, 
you must: 

include in your petition a written agreement specifying exactly when each parent 
will have physical custody of the children (and each parent must have custody at 
least 30% of the year); and 

attach  form  DR-306,  Shared  Custody  Child  Support  Calculation,  showing  your 
calculations.  See the DR-310 booklet for help in filling out this form.

Part A, Paragraphs 4 and 5.  Health Insurance  

The court is required by statute and by court rule to include a medical support order in 
the child support order if health care coverage is available at a reasonable cost.  However, 
before ordering that health insurance be purchased, the court must consider whether the 
children  are  eligible  for free  health  care  from  the  Indian  Health  Service or  some  other 
entity  (such  as  the  military).    Although  one  party  may  be  ordered  to  purchase  the 
insurance,  the  cost  of  it  must  be  shared  between  you.    This  is  done  by  adjusting  the 
amount of child support.  AS 47.23.060(c) and Civil Rule 90.3(d)(1).   

If the children are not eligible for services from the Indian Health Service or some similar 
health coverage, and if health insurance for the children is available to either parent at a 
reasonable cost (for example through your employer or union), the parent who has the 
insurance available must purchase it.  If both parents have such insurance available, you 
must agree which one of you will purchase it.  The cost must be divided equally between 
you unless you can show the court good cause why it should be divided differently. 

In paragraph 4.a., you must indicate who has such insurance available, who will purchase 
it, and how the cost will be divided between you.  In paragraph 5, you must either increase 
or  decrease  the  amount  of  child  support  owed,  depending  on  who  is  purchasing  the 
insurance and how the cost will be divided between you.  For example, if the obligor will 
buy insurance for the children costing $100 per month and you have agreed that each 
party  will  pay  half  the  cost,  you  should  write  $50  on  line  5b  and  subtract  it  from  the 
amount  on line 5a in order to get  the net  amount  due on line 5d.   If you had  instead 
agreed that the obligor would pay 70% of the cost, you should cross out 50% and write 
in 30% on the blank line in paragraph b.  The amount to subtract on line 5b would be 
$30.

Page 13 of 19 
DR-10 (3/23) 
INSTRUCTIONS – DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE FOR SPOUSES (WITH CHILDREN) 

Note that the insurance cost referred to here is the actual cost of insuring the children 
who  are  the  subjects  of  this  support  order.   It  does  not  include  the  cost  of  insuring  a 
parent or any other children who may live in the household.  And, it must not include the 
value  of  any  insurance  provided  for  free  by  an  employer  (that  is,  with  no  paycheck 
deduction).    See  the  DR-310  booklet  and  the  diagram,  Calculating  Cost  of  Child(ren)’s 
Health Insurance, for more information. 

ivil  Rule  90.3(d)(1)  requires  that  child  support  be  adjusted  only  for  those  insurance 
payments which are actually made.  Therefore, the child support order will state that if 
these payments are not made, the monthly child support amount due will return to what 
it was before the adjustment. 

 C

Part A, Paragraph 6.  Request for Different Child Support Amount 

See paragraph (c) of Civil  Rule 90.3 for the circumstances when the court  can allow a 
different amount of child support than what is calculated using the formulas set out in the 
rule.  Also see the discussion of this paragraph in the Commentary to the rule and in the 
DR-310 booklet. 

If you request a different amount of child support than what is calculated under the rule 
and  the  court  does  not agree  to  allow  it,  then  you  must  either  agree  in  writing  to the 
amount required by the court or you will not be granted a decree of dissolution. 

Note that if you are receiving assistance from the Alaska Temporary Assistance Program 
(ATAP), you cannot waive or agree to change the amount of child support.  You cannot 
do this because you have assigned (given) your right to receive child support to the Child 
Support Services Division. 

Part A, Paragraph 7.  Seasonal Income 

If the income of the parent who will pay child support is seasonal (such as seasonal income 
from  commercial  fishing),  it  may  be  easier  for  that  parent  to  pay  higher  child  support 
amounts  during  the  high-income  months  and  lower  amounts  during  the  low-income 
months.  Fill out this section of the petition if both parents agree that you want to do this.  
Note  that  this  does  not  change  the  total  annual  amount  due.    It  just  allows  different 
amounts to be paid in different months.  See Civil Rule 90.3(c)(5), Commentary section 
VI.F, and the DR-310 booklet for more information. 

Part A, Paragraph 8.  Travel Expenses 

Civil Rule 90.3(g) states: "After determining an award of child support under this rule, the 
court shall allocate reasonable travel expenses which are necessary to exercise visitation 
between the parties as may be just and proper for them to contribute."  See the discussion 
of this paragraph in Section IX of the Commentary to the rule. 

Part A, Paragraph 9.  Native Corporation Dividends 

If it is possible that Native Corporation dividends may be paid on behalf of the child, fill 
out paragraph 9. 

Part B.  Child Support for 18 Year Olds  

Normally, child support stops when a child reaches age 18 or is otherwise emancipated.  
However, you may agree that support will be provided for each child while the child is 18 
if the child is (1) unmarried, (2) actively pursuing a high school diploma or equivalent level

of technical or vocational training, and (3) living as a dependent with a parent or guardian 
or a designee of the parent or guardian.  You can ask the court to order that the support 
be paid to the parent with whom the child is living or directly to the 18 year old.  You can 
include this in your petition or you can request it  later (for example, when the child is 
about  to  turn  18).    If  you  agree  now  that  support  for  the  18  year  old  should  be  paid 
directly to the 18 year old, include this agreement in Section X, "Other Agreements," on  
16 of the petition. 

art C.  Assistance of Child Support Services Division (CSSD) 

You  may  want  to  request  the  services  of  the  Alaska  Child  Support  Services  Division 
(CSSD).    If  you  do,  CSSD  will  maintain  records  of  support  payments  and  enforce  the 
support order.  For example, CSSD will serve an order enforcing the income withholding 
order described above on the obligor's  employer.  If you get  one of the above income 
withholding orders but do not apply for CSSD's services, the obligee will have to serve the 
appropriate court orders on the employer.  In either case (whether CSSD serves the order 
on the employer or the obligee does it), the withheld money must be paid to CSSD.   

or more information about CSSD, read the attached information sheet (form DR-316).  If 
you want to request CSSD's services, fill out the attached application form (DR-315) and 
file it with your petition.   

If  the  parent  with  custody  of  the  children  is  receiving  assistance  from  the  Alaska 
Temporary Assistance Program (ATAP), child support payments must be made to CSSD. 

Part D. Immediate Income Withholding  

The Alaska Statutes require that support payments be withheld from the obligor's income 
unless one of the following three exceptions applies to your case:   

(1)  Alternative Payment Arrangement.  The parents make a written agreement for an 
alternative arrangement, such as having a military allotment paid to the obligee, 
payment of two months' support to the obligee as security for future payments, or 
an automatic funds transfer from the obligor's bank or employer to the obligee, 
and 
• 

If CSSD is enforcing the support order, CSSD entered this agreement into its 
record; and 
An income withholding order has not been terminated previously and then 
later initiated; and 
The  obligor  agreed  to  keep  the  obligee  (or  CSSD  if  CSSD  is  enforcing  the 
order)  informed  of  the  obligor’s  current  employer  and  the  availability  of 
employment-related  health  insurance  coverage  for  the  children  until  the 
support order is satisfied. 

• 

• 

2)  Not in Best Interests of Child(ren). The  court  finds  good  cause  not  to  require 
immediate income withholding because it would not be in the best interests of the 
child(ren); and 
• 

The obligor made voluntary support payments under a court or agency order 
and has not been in arrears in an amount equal to the support payable for 
one month; and  
The  obligor  agreed  to  keep  the  obligee  (or  CSSD  if  CSSD  is  enforcing  the 
order)  informed  of  the  obligor’s  current  employer  and  the  availability  of 
employment-related  health  insurance  coverage  for  the  children  until  the 
support order is satisfied.

INSTRUCTIONS – DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE FOR SPOUSES (WITH CHILDREN) 

(3)  Obligor Receives Other Compensation. The obligor is receiving Social Security or 
other  disability  compensation  that  includes  regular  payments  to  the  children  at 
least equal to the child support owed each month.  You must state the amount the 
children receive each month and where the money comes from.  If these Social 
Security or other disability payments for the children are less than the amount the 
obligor owes, the court must  order that the remaining amount due be withheld 
from the obligor's income, unless one of the above two exceptions applies. 

n additional requirement for the first two exceptions is that the obligor must agree to 
keep the obligee (or CSSD if CSSD is enforcing the order) informed of his or her current 
employer  and  the  availability of  employment-related  health  insurance  coverage  for  the 
children until the support order is satisfied (that is, for as long as child support is owed). 

f immediate withholding is ordered, the obligee (or CSSD if CSSD is enforcing the order) 
must  serve  a  court  writ  (or  CSSD  order)  on  the  obligor's  employer  explaining  how 
withholding will work.  The employer must send the withheld money to CSSD (whether 
CSSD is enforcing the order or not). 

If  one  of  these  exceptions  is  granted  but  payments  later  become  delinquent,  income 
withholding can be started by filing a motion with the court as provided in AS 25.27.062(c) 
& (d) or by making a written request to CSSD (without requesting CSSD's other services).  
If a party has applied for CSSD services, CSSD can start the procedures for putting income 
withholding into effect.   

Part E.  Federal Taxes  

In 2018, tax benefits for people with dependents changed.  You will not receive an 
exemption for dependents anymore.  Instead, there is a larger child tax credit.  To get 
the child tax credit and other tax benefits, you must meet the requirements described in 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 501.  Check that you are viewing the 
publication for the current tax year because the IRS updates publications annually.     

or more information, IRS Publication 504 explains special rules that may apply.  Note: In 
Part E, if a parent is more than four months behind in child support payments at the end 
of the tax year, then that parent cannot claim certain tax benefits for that tax year. The 
last paragraph in Part E lists other common tax implications of dissolution.  Contact the 
IRS  or  your  tax  advisor  about  the  laws  governing  tax  benefits  for  individuals  with 
dependents because they can help explain the current laws.  

Part F.  Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) Agreement (15) 

You should agree on who will apply for the Alaska PFD on behalf of the children while 
they are minors (under age 18).  If both parents apply for the children, the Department 
of  Revenue  will  not  send  the  dividends  to  either  one.    The  Department  will  hold  the 
dividends until they receive a court order directing who should receive the dividends or 
until one parent withdraws the applications he/she filed on behalf of the children.

Section IX.  CHANGE OR RESTORE NAME (page 16)  

Either spouse may ask to restore (return to) a prior name, that is, a name that you had 
before the marriage.  Either spouse may ask that a new name be authorized, however, 
there may be additional legal requirements and the court will have to approve this request.   

f  you  want  a  prior  name  restored  (to  go  back  to  a  name  you  had  before),  check  the 
appropriate box for yourself (Party A or Party B) and fill in the blanks for your current and 
former names.  You may also want to follow steps #2, #9, #10, #11, and #12 below.   
  
You must also fill out Notice of Request to Restore Name in Dissolution or Divorce Case 
(form DR-957) if you are one or more of the following: 

•  currently charged with a crime,  
•  currently incarcerated (for example, in jail, in prison, or at a halfway house), 
•  on supervised felony probation or on parole for a criminal conviction, or  
• 

required to register as a sex offender or child kidnapper under AS 12.63.010.  

The court may order you to do additional notice of your name restoration if you fall into 
one  of  these  categories.    Read  the  court’s  order  carefully.    You  must  complete  any 
additional  notice  by  the  date  of  your  dissolution  hearing  or  your  dissolution  could  be 
delayed.  You can use Affidavit of Additional Service (form CIV-702) to provide proof to 
the court that you completed this requirement.  You may file this before the hearing or 
bring it to the hearing. 

New Name 

f you are requesting a name that was not a name you had before the marriage, there 
may be additional costs and your dissolution hearing will be delayed.   Additionally, the 
judge may find that a new name change is not authorized in certain situations as part of 
a  dissolution  case.    For  these  reasons,  it  may  be  easier  to  do  the  name  change  in  a 
separate case by filing Petition for Change of Name (form CIV-700).  If you do decide to 
do it as part of your dissolution hearing, take the following steps: 

Check  the  box  on  the  petition  requesting  a  new  name  and  fill  out  Request  to 
Change to New Name in Dissolution Case (form DR-955).   

Ask the court for form VS-405, Application for Legal Name Change.  Fill out the 
form (please type the information if possible) and return it to the court, together 
with form DR-955, when you file your dissolution petition. 

Tell the clerk your petition includes a request for name change and that you need 
an order for posting. 

If the court finds that the name change is legally allowed as part of the dissolution 
case, the court will send you an Order for Hearing, Posting, and Additional Service 
(form CIV-701).  This order will tell you the time and place of the hearing on your 
name change.  It will also tell you whether you must provide additional service.  If 
the order requires additional service, follow the instructions on the order.

DR-10 (3/23) 
INSTRUCTIONS – DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE FOR SPOUSES (WITH CHILDREN) 

Unless waived by written court order, the clerk will automatically post the proposed 
name change and the date of the hearing to the Alaska Court System’s Legal Notice 
Website for four consecutive weeks.  After posting is completed, the clerk will file 
the Clerk’s Certificate of Service of Posting (form TF-815) to the website.  

If you are also required to serve additional notice, you must file proof that you 
did so.  Use Affidavit of Additional Service (form CIV-702).  File it with the court 
before the hearing or bring it to the hearing. 

The hearing is usually short and fairly informal.  It will usually be combined with 
your dissolution hearing.  You must tell the judge why you want to change your 
name and assure the judge that you are not seeking to change your name in order 
to  avoid  debts  or  defraud  anyone.    If  the  judge  finds  there  is  no  reasonable 
objection to the change and that it is consistent with the public interest, the judge 
will sign a judgment allowing you to take the new name.  However, you cannot 
begin using the new name yet, because the judgment will not be effective until 
the following steps are completed. 

The court will automatically post notice on the Alaska Court System’s legal notice 
website for one week unless waived by the court in a written order.  Following the 
posting, the clerk will file the Clerk’s Certificate of Service of Posting (form TF-815) 
to the website. 

If  the  judgment  requires  additional  service,  follow  the  judgment’s  instructions.  
After additional service is complete, fill out an Affidavit of Additional Service (form 
CIV-702) and file it with the court.  The clerk will then issue a Certificate of Name 
Change (form CIV-705).  You can begin using your new name on the date stated 
in  the  certificate.    This  date  will  be  at  least  30  days  after  the  judgment  was 
distributed.  The clerk will give you two copies of the certificate.  One will be a free 
certified copy.  If you need additional certified copies, there will be a charge for 
them.  Current fees are listed in Administrative Rule 9. 

If you have an Alaska driver's license, or you own a vehicle registered in Alaska, 
you  must  send  written  notice  of  your  name  change  to  the  Division  of  Motor 
Vehicles within 30 days.  AS 28.05.071.  To get a new driver's license, you will 
need  to  go  to  a  DMV  office  and  present  a  copy  of  the  Certificate  of  Name 
Change (form CIV-705). 

Notify  the  Social  Security  Administration  of  your  name  change  to  avoid  tax 
problems and help assure proper employment credit.  Toll-free telephone number: 
1-800-772-1213. 

Individuals required to register on the Sex Offender and Child Kidnapper Registry 
per AS 12.63.010 must notify the Department of Public Safety about any name 
change (including restoring a prior name) within one business day after 
receiving the Certificate of Name Change (form CIV-705).  Use Notification of 
Petition/Proof of Legal Name Change (form 12-299-74).  This form is available 
from law enforcement or online at https://sor.dps.alaska.gov/Home/Documents. 

If you want a new birth certificate, contact the Vital Records office of the state in 
which you were born and pay the required fee.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
