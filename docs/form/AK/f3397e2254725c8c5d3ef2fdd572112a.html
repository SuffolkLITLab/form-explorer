      <pre>INFORMATION ABOUT MARRIAGE LICENSE, CEREMONY, AND CERTIFICATE 

You must get a license from the state of Alaska before you can be married.  A marriage is not 
valid unless it is solemnized, which means that a marriage ceremony is performed (see next 
page).  There is no common law marriage in Alaska.   

REQUIREMENTS FOR A MARRIAGE LICENSE 

These instructions describe how to apply for a license at a court.  You can also apply through 
the Health Analytics and Vital Records office (in person or by mail).  The application form is also 
available online here: www.vitalrecords.alaska.gov.

Application Form. 
Before a marriage license can be issued, you must complete an application.  Both parties 
(the future spouses) must fill out part of the application form.  If either party is out of 
town or out of state, contact the court for further instructions. 

Waiting Period. 
The waiting period is three days.  It begins when either party starts the process by 
completing that party’s section of the application form.  The license can be issued on the 
fourth day, however, it will not be issued until both parties complete and sign the 
application form. 

Age Requirement. 
Each party must be one or more of the following: at least 18 years old or legally 
emancipated or a member of the armed forces of the United States on active duty. 
If either party is 16 or 17 years old at the time of marriage, the other party can be no 
more than three years older.  Additionally, the minor party needs BOTH: 

(1) the written consent of the minor's parents, legal guardian, or the parent who 
has actual care, custody and control of the minor.  If only one parent has 
actual custody, proof of custody (divorce decree, custody order, or death 
certificate) may be required.  A certified copy of a birth certificate showing 
parentage may be required.  AND 

(2) a court order granting permission to marry.  Contact your local court for 

questions about how to ask for this order.   

The superior court has the power to grant permission to marry without the written 
consent of the minor’s parents or guardians, however, you may wish to speak with an 
attorney if this situation applies to you. 
A person younger than 16 years old may not marry in Alaska for any reason. 

Identification. 
Before the license is issued, each party may be required to present photo ID showing 
name and birthdate.  A birth certificate is not sufficient. 

Prior Marriages. 
If either party has been married before, the name of the former spouse, the date and 
place of marriage, and the date and place the marriage ended are required.  If the 
marriage ended within the past 60 days, a copy of the divorce decree, signed by the 
judge, or a death certificate may be required before the license will be issued. 

Blood Test. 
No blood test is required. 

Cost. 
The license costs $60.00.  The license must be used within 90 days.  It can be used 
anywhere in Alaska.

MARRIAGE CEREMONY (SOLEMNIZATION) 

8. 

A marriage ceremony may be solemnized (performed) by:  
Religious Leader.  A minister, priest, or rabbi of any church or congregation in the state, 
or by a commissioned officer of the Salvation Army, or by the principal officer or elder of 
recognized churches or congregations that traditionally do not have regular ministers, 
priests, or rabbis.  It may also be performed before or in any religious organization or 
congregation according to an established ritual practiced within that group. 
Elected Official.  Any individual holding an elective public office in the state. 
Judicial Officer.  Any state judge or magistrate.  Ceremonies may be scheduled at the 
courthouse.  The cost is $25.00.  You must bring one witness who is at least 18 years 
old with you to the ceremony.  The witness must be able to certify that both parties 
intend to get married of their own free will.  The witness must also provide the witness’s 
name, address, phone number, and email address on the marriage certificate. 
Marriage Commissioner.  Marriage commissioners are appointed by the presiding judge 
of the judicial district.  Any adult private citizen may get an appointment as a marriage 
commissioner.  The appointment will be limited to performing a ceremony for two 
specific persons on a specific day at a specific place within the judicial district.  The 
appointment order is valid only for these specifications.  If any fact changes, such as the 
date or place of marriage, the commissioner must get a new appointment order.  Every 
ceremony done by a marriage commissioner requires a separate appointment order.   
The cost to appoint a marriage commissioner is $25.00.  The request must be made in 
person at the court, by the person wishing to be appointed.  The commissioner does not 
need to be an Alaska resident.  Photo ID may be required.  The court will provide an 
instruction sheet for completing the marriage certificate after the ceremony.  The court 
also has sample marriage ceremony scripts available upon request. 

Form of Ceremony. 
No particular format, words, or ritual is required.  The only legal requirement is that the 
two parties must agree and declare that they intend to be married, in the presence of 
each other, the person performing the ceremony, and at least one other witness. 

Multiple Ceremonies. 
If the parties are doing both a religious and a civil ceremony, only one license is needed. 

ARRIAGE CERTIFICATE 

Recording the Marriage Certificate. 
After the marriage ceremony, the person who performed the ceremony must return the 
completed marriage certificate to the Health Analytics and Vital Records office at 5441 
Commercial Blvd., PO Box 110675, Juneau, AK 99801.  This must be done within 
seven days after the ceremony. 

Certified Copies of Marriage Certificate. 
After you are married, you may buy certified copies of your marriage certificate from 
Health Analytics and Vital Records at the Juneau or Anchorage office.  Instructions and a 
request form are available at www.vitalrecords.alaska.gov.  Please allow at least one 
week for the person who performed the ceremony to file the certificate.  The fee is 
$30.00 for the first certified copy, and $25 for each additional copy ordered at the same 
time.  The $60.00 fee for the marriage license does not include the cost of a certified 
copy of the marriage certificate. 
You will be provided with a decorative certficate when your license is issued and/or after 
the ceremony.  This decorative certificate cannot be used as proof of marriage.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
