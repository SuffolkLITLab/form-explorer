      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILING A MOTION  
TO CHANGE CUSTODY, SUPPORT OR VISITATION 

se these instructions to ask an Alaska court to change a custody, support, or visitation 
order  that  was  issued in  Alaska.    If  the  order was  a  support  order  issued  in  another 
state and registered in Alaska, use the DR-360 packet of forms to modify the order. 

tep 1.  Fill out the following forms: 

[NOTE:  There may be a fee to file this motion.  The filing fee is specified in 
Administrative Rule 9(b)(1).  If you are unable to pay the filing fee, you can 
file a Request for Exemption from Payment of Fees, and Order (form TF-920) 
to request a waiver.  The motion will not go to the judge until the fee is paid 
or waived.  Do not serve your documents until the filing fee is paid or the 
court approves your request to waive the filing fee.] 

.  Motion (DR-705).   

.  Information Sheet (DR-314).   

.  Notice of Motion (DR-710). 

.  Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit (DR-150).  (Required only if the 

motion is to change custody.) You must list every child covered by your 
most recent court order. 

e.  Child Support Guidelines Affidavit (DR-305).  Fill in the requested 

information about your own finances and as much information about the 
finances of the other parent as possible.  If you do not know specific 
information about the other parent’s finances, write “unknown” in that 
space. You must attach a copy of your most recent federal tax return and 
most recent pay stubs to verify income and deductions. 

.  Shared Custody Child Support Calculation (DR-306).  (Required only if 
shared custody has been ordered or is being requested.)  If you are 
requesting “divided” or “hybrid” custody (as defined in Civil Rule 90.3(f)), 
you must instead attach form DR-307 (divided custody) or DR-308 (hybrid 
custody).  These forms are available at the court or on the court system’s 
website. 

HILD SUPPORT INSTRUCTION BOOKLET:  For more information about how 
to complete the child support calculation forms (DR-305, DR-306, DR-307 & 
DR-308), use the booklet, How to Calculate Child Support (DR-310), on the 
court system’s website.  If you have limited or no online access, the court 
clerk can give you a paper copy.  The booklet includes  a copy of the 
guidelines courts must follow in setting child support, Civil Rule 90.3.

Legal Information 
If you want to read about the laws that govern these cases, following are some Alaska Statutes 
and Alaska Rules of Court to look at.  Also read the “Annotations” that follow these statutes and 
rules. (Annotations are brief paragraphs describing the Alaska Supreme Court decisions 
interpreting the rules and statutes.) 

Child Support 

Civil Rule 90.3 and the “Commentary” that explains this rule. 

 

 

 

Alaska Statutes 25.24.160(a)(1), 25.24.170, 25.24.240, 25.24.910, 
and 25.27.060 to .070 

How to Calculate Child Support Under Civil Rule 90.3 (DR-310)   
This free booklet is available at the court. 

Forms and instructions for requesting that child support continue 
while a child is 18 (DR-320 to DR-323), available at the court. 

Child Custody  
and Visitation 

Alaska Statutes 25.20.060 to 25.20.140, 25.24.150, 25.24.170, 
25.24.240, and 25.30.300 

Custody Decisions:  "Best Interests of the Child" 

he court will not grant a change in custody unless there has been a substantial change in 
circumstances since the last order was entered.  Also, the requested change must be in the 
best interests of the children.  Alaska Statute 25.24.150(c) lists the things the court must 
consider in order to decide what the children's best interests are.  It states: 

 

 
 

(6) 

(4) 
(5) 

(1) 
(2) 
(3) 

In determining the best interests of the child the court shall consider: 
 
 
 

the physical, emotional, mental, religious, and social needs of the child; 
the capability and desire of each parent to meet these needs; 
the child's preference if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to form a 
preference; 
the love and affection existing between the child and each parent; 
the length of time the child has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment and 
the desirability of maintaining continuity;  
the willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and 
continuing relationship between the other parent and the child, except that the 
court may not consider this willingness and ability if one parent shows that the 
other parent has sexually assaulted or engaged in domestic violence against the 
parent or a child, and that a continuing relationship with the other parent will 
endanger the health or safety of either the parent or the child; 
any evidence of domestic violence, child abuse, or child neglect in the proposed 
custodial household or a history of violence between the parents; 
evidence that substance abuse by either parent or other members of the 
household directly affects the emotional or physical well-being of the child; 
other factors that the court considers pertinent. 

(9) 

(8) 

(7) 

 

 

 

his statute also provides that, in awarding custody, "the court may consider only those facts 

that directly affect the well-being of the child" and that the court must comply with the 
provisions of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA).  In 2004, the legislature added new sections 
(g) through (k) to AS 25.24.150.  These sections limit the court’s ability to award custody if 
either parent “has a history of perpetrating domestic violence against the other parent, a child, 
or a domestic living partner.”

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
