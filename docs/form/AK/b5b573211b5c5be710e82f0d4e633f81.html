      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS: HOW TO ASK THE COURT TO APPOINT A GUARDIAN 
FOR A MINOR WHO IS NOT AN INDIAN CHILD1 
 
Introduction 

The court may appoint a guardian for an unmarried minor child if all parental rights of custody 
have been terminated or suspended by circumstances or prior court order.2   

The court may appoint as guardian any adult whose appointment would be in the best interests of 
the minor.  An adult family member has priority.3  If the minor is age 14 or older, the minor may 
nominate who the minor wants as guardian.4  The court must appoint the person nominated by 
the minor unless the court finds it is contrary to the minor’s best interests. 

Note: If the minor will be 18 years old within 180 days (about 6 months), and you believe 
the  minor  will  continue  to  need  a  guardian  as  an  adult,  file  the  petition  for  adult 
guardianship (form PG-100) instead of form PG-610.  Instructions for the adult petition 
are in form PG-505.  An example of this situation is when a parent of a developmentally 
disabled child needs to continue to have guardian authority, because the child will not be 
able to take care of her/his own needs as an adult. 

All of the forms in these instructions may be requested from your local court and are also 
available online: http://www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm.  

Lawyers 

Before  starting  this  process,  it  may  help  to  talk  to  a  lawyer  who  is  familiar  with  guardianship 
procedure.   If  you are unsure about whether  you should hire a lawyer,  many lawyers will do a 
free or low-cost consultation for a short period of time to help you decide if it is a good idea to 
have legal help in your case.  If you do not know a lawyer, you can call or write to:

HOW TO FILE 

tep 1. 

Fill out the Petition form (PG-610).  

If you are asking for guardianship of more than one child, fill out a separate petition 
for each child.  Fill in the top of the form as shown below:

PETITION FOR APPOINTMENT OF A 
GUARDIAN FOR A MINOR 
 

 
 

 

 

 

Type or print clearly, using black ink. 

  S

 

 

  I

a. 

Section 1 is where you explain the legal basis (known as “venue”) for filing in a 
certain court location.  If there is no open Child in Need of Aid (CINA) case 
involving the minor, you must file at a court in the same judicial district where 
the minor lives or is physically located at the time you file. 

If  there  is  an  open  CINA  court  case,  you  must  file  the  petition  in  the  same 
court location where the CINA case was filed, or you can file at any court in 
the  judicial  district  where  you  live,  but  only  if  no  party  in  the  CINA  case 
objects to this. 

A list of superior court filing locations is on page 10.  You can find a list of 
which courts are in which judicial district here: 
http://www.courts.alaska.gov/courtdir/index.htm#trial  

b. 

Parent’s Rights 

In  sections  3  and  4,  explain  how  each  parent’s  rights  of  custody  have  been 
“terminated” or “suspended by court order” or “suspended by circumstances.”  

Terminated  means  a  court  has  entered  a  written  order  ending  the  person’s 
parental rights concerning the child. 

Suspended by court order means the court has suspended the parent’s right 
to have custody.  For example, this often happens in a CINA case, when the 
court gives temporary custody of the child to the state. 

Suspended  by  circumstances  means  that  the  parents  are  unable  to  provide 
care and supervision for the child on a day-to-day basis and perform normal 
parenting duties.   

 

If  “suspended  by  circumstances” is the  reason  a guardian  is  needed,  you  must 
explain  in  sections  3  and  4  what  those  circumstances  are.    You  must  give 
enough details for the judge to understand the situation.

Probate Rules 14 & 15 
AS 13.26.101 - .186 

If you are alleging that parental rights are suspended by circumstances other than 
the  death  of  the  parent(s),  then  the  living  parent(s)  will  need  to  consent  to  the 
guardianship (see Step 4 on page 5 of these instructions).   If either or both of the 
parents do not consent, you may have to file a case in regular domestic relations 
(child custody) court.  This situation can be very complicated, and you may want 
to  talk  to  a  lawyer  about  your  options.    You  can  find  more  information  about 
filing for custody here: http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/selfhelp.htm. 

Indian Child 

In section 6, you must state whether the minor is “an Indian child as defined by 
the  Indian  Child  Welfare  Act.”  The  Indian  Child  Welfare  Act  (ICWA)  is  a 
federal  law  that  requires  special  procedures  whenever  the  court  is  deciding 
guardianship of an Indian child.  ICWA includes the following definitions:7 

 

.  

  c

Indian child means any unmarried person who is under the age 
of 18 and who is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe, or (b) is 
eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological 
child of a member of an Indian tribe. 

Indian  tribe  means  any  Indian  tribe,  band,  nation,  or  other 
organized group or community of Indians recognized as eligible 
for  the  services  provided  to  Indians  by  the  Secretary  [of  the 
Interior] because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska 
Native village as defined in section 1602(c) of Title 43.   

There are over 200 Alaska tribes, mostly Native villages.  If the minor, or any 
one  of  the  minor’s  parents  or  grandparents,  was  born  in  a  village,  the  minor 
might  qualify  for  tribal  membership.    Ask  the  minor,  the  parents,  and  (if 
necessary) other relatives about this.  

f  you  need  help  determining  whether  a  minor  qualifies  as  an  "Indian  child" 
under ICWA,  you may be able to get help from the tribe  you think the  minor 
might belong to.   

he  federal  Bureau  of  Indian  Affairs  (BIA)  publishes  an  updated  list  of  the 
tribes  every  year  in  the  Federal  Register.  The  list  includes  the  name,  address, 
and telephone number of a contact person for each tribe.  You can get the list on 
the BIA website: https://www.bia.gov/bia/ois/dhs/icwa/agents-listing/.  

  I

  T

  Y

ou can also call the Juneau office of the BIA and ask for assistance (1-800-
645-8397, press 2 for "Tribal Enrollment," then press 6 to speak to the ICWA 
child welfare social worker).  You will need to give them the names and dates 
of birth of the minor’s parents and, if possible, the minor’s grandparents. 
 
Check  the  box  at  the  beginning  of  section  8  if  both  parents  are  dead.    Then 
check one of the two boxes below to state whether the last surviving parent left 
a will that appoints a guardian for the child.

If  there  is  a  will  appointing  a  guardian,  check  one  of  the  next  two  boxes 
explaining why the appointed guardian cannot be the guardian: 

 

 

(1) 

The guardian has not accepted the appointment.   

Alaska  statutes  require  a  guardian  appointed  by  will  to  file  a  written 
acceptance of the appointment in the court where the will is probated.8  
 
If  that  person  has  not  accepted  the  appointment,  and  you  want  a 
different  person  appointed  guardian,  you  must  notify  the  person 
appointed in the will that you are filing this petition.9  You can do this 
by sending the person a letter.  Example:

Probate Rules 14 & 15 
AS 13.26.101 - .186 

(2) 

The minor opposed the appointment made in the parent’s will. 

If the minor is age 14 or older, the minor may file a written objection to 
the person named as guardian in the will.  The objection must be filed in 
court either before or within 30 days after the minor receives notice of 
the guardian’s acceptance of the appointment.  The court will then hold 
a  hearing  to  decide  if  that  person  should  be  the  guardian.  Check  the 
second box on your petition if this is what happened in your case. 
 

Sections 9, 10, and 11 ask about other court orders or proceedings concerning 
the  child.    If  there  were  any  court  orders  issued,  or  if  any  court  cases  are 
pending  (still open), provide as much information as  you  know, including the 
status of the case.  Include any type of case that affects who has custody of the 
child (for example, an adoption case) in any court.  

Signature. 

Sign  and  date  the  petition  on  page  3.    You  also  need  to  complete  the 
“Verification” section that follows your signature.  You must do the verification 
in front of a notary public.  A court clerk can provide this notary service for you 
(at no charge) when you bring the petition to court.  Bring a photo ID with you 
for the notarization. 
 

Step 2. 

Fill out the Child Custody Jurisdiction Affidavit (DR-150).   

If you are asking for guardianship of more than one child, fill out a separate affidavit for 
each  child  (even  though  this  form  has  sections  for  multiple  children,  each  child  in  a 
guardianship case has a different case number and case caption at the top of the form). 

Fill in the top of the form the same way you did the petition.  You will have to fill out 
the complete text on the left side of the case caption, like this: 

 

In the Matter of the Protective Proceeding of: 
 
 
 
 
 
[Name of the child] 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
  Minor   
 
  Date of Birth: [Minor’s date of birth] 

 
 
 

 

 

) 
) 
) 
) 
) 

tep 3. 

Fill out the Acceptance of Appointment (form PG-630).  

Fill in the top of the form the same as you did on the petition, and fill in the proposed 
guardian’s  name  in  the  first  paragraph.  Before  signing,  the  proposed  guardian  must 
read the statute that describes the duties of a guardian of a minor, AS 13.26.167 (this 
statute is printed on page 12 of these instructions). 

tep 4. 

Parent’s Consent (form PG-615). 

If  either  or  both  of  the  minor’s  parents  are  alive,  and  there  is  no  court  order 
terminating or suspending the parent’s right to have custody of the minor child, then 
the  court  can  only  appoint  a  guardian  if  that  parent’s  rights  of  custody  have  been 
suspended by circumstances (see definitions on page 2 of these instructions).

If a parent agrees that the parent’s own rights have been suspended by circumstances, 
and agrees that a guardian needs to be appointed, that parent can either come to the 
court  hearing  and  tell  this  to  the  judge,  or  fill  out  and  sign  form  PG-615,  Parent’s 
Consent. 

If  a  parent  agrees  with  the  appointment  of  a  guardian,  but  is  not  able  to  attend  the 
hearing,  you should get  the consent  form  filled out, signed, and filed with the court 
before the hearing (or bring the signed form to the hearing).  You will need a separate 
Consent form from each parent if both are living and their custodial rights have not 
been terminated or suspended by court order. 

Note:  If the parent is under age 18, the parent will need to come to the court hearing 
instead of signing the Parent’s Consent form. 

 

You and the parent must fill out the form in full.  Make sure the parent understands 
the form  and make sure  the form  is  completely filled out  before the parent  signs it.  
The parent will need to sign it in front of a notary public or court clerk. 
 

 
Step 5.  Make  a  copy  of  the  Petition, Child  Custody  Jurisdiction  Affidavit,  Acceptance  of 

Appointment, and Parent’s Consent forms for yourself.   

You will also need one copy of the Petition for each person that must be notified of 
the court case (see Step 8 below). 

tep 6. 

File  the  original  Petition,  Child  Custody  Jurisdiction  Affidavit,  Acceptance  of 
Appointment  and  Parent’s  Consent,  and  pay  the  filing  fee  according  to 
Administrative Rule 9(b)(2)(G).   

You can deliver these documents to the court in person or mail them along with the 
filing fee. If you cannot afford this fee, fill out form TF-920, Request for Exemption 
from  Payment  of  Fees.    If  you  are  petitioning  for  guardianship  of  more  than  one 
minor at the same time, you only have to pay one filing fee, even though you must 
file a separate petition for each minor. 

If  you  change  your  address,  email,  or  phone  number  after  you  file  the  petition  and 
before  the  court  hearing,  you  must  notify  the  court.    You  can  use  form  PG-195, 
Notice of Change of Contact Information, to do this. 

tep 7. 

Scheduling of Court Hearing.   

The  court  clerk  will  give  or  mail  you  a  Notice  of  Hearing  telling  you  the  time  and 
place of your hearing and the name of the judge or master who will hear the case. 
 

 
Step 8.  Notifying Others about the Hearing (form PG-620).  

As  the  petitioner,  it  is  your  responsibility  to  notify  certain  other  people  about  the 
hearing.  When you receive the notice in Step 7, do the following as soon as possible:   

a. 

On page 1 of the Notice of Guardianship Hearing for Non-Indian Child (form 
PG-620), fill in the top of the form the same as you on the petition, but also 
add the case number.  Fill in all of the information about the hearing (from the 
notice the court gave you in Step 7) and the court telephone number (see list 
of court telephone numbers on page 10).  Sign and date the form.

Check the box in front of each paragraph that applies:  

 

 
 
 
 

 

 
 
 
 

•  Check the first box if the minor is age 14 or older.  If the minor is  

younger, do not check this box.   

•  Check the second and third boxes if the parents are living and have 
not signed a “waiver of notice.”10  The Parent’s Consent (form  
PG-615) includes a place for the parent waive notice of the hearing 
in section 10.  If a parent checks the second box in section 10 of  
that form, you do not have to send that parent notice of the hearing.  

•  Check the fourth box unless this person is you (the petitioner) or a 

parent of the minor. 

• 

If you are proposing (nominating) a guardian other than yourself or 
the person in the fourth box, then check the fifth box. 

(2) 

For all of the boxes you checked in (1), fill out the entire section with 
the person’s full name, and when and how the notice was (or will be) 
delivered  to  that  person.    If  you  are  doing  hand-delivery,  be  sure  to 
include the name of the person who will deliver the notice. 

(4) 

Sign  at  the  bottom  of  the  page  and  fill  in  your  address,  email,  and 
telephone number. 

Make a copy of the PG-620 form  you filled out and the petition you already 
filed  for  each  person  you  are  giving  the  notice  to.    Send  a  copy  of  both  of 
these documents to every person you checked a box for on page 2 of the PG-
620 form.  You must do this at least 14 days before the court hearing.11 

Proof of Notice.  After you send these documents to everyone, file the original 
PG-620  form  (with  your  original  signature  on  page  2)  with  the  court.    You 
must  file  it  before  the  hearing  date  or  bring  the  original  with  you  to  the 
hearing.  Make a copy of form PG-620 to keep for yourself. 

If anyone has signed a written waiver of notice, file the original waiver with 
the court along with your original form PG-620.

The hearing will probably happen between 30 to 90 days after you file your petition. 
The hearing will be before a judge or master.  The minor has the right to be present at 
the hearing.  Usually these hearings are closed to the public.

On page 2 of form PG-620,  

The judge will identify everyone present (for the hearing record). 

The  judge  will  ask  whether  there  are  any  disagreements  about  what  should 
happen in the case. 

The judge may ask you questions about what you wrote in your petition.  The 
judge  may  also  ask  if  anyone  in  the  courtroom  objects  to  the  guardian 
appointment. 

If  there  are  disagreements,  the  judge  may  ask  additional  questions  to  clarify 
what the areas of disagreement are.  If all parties do not agree, the judge may 
have to take evidence. 

 

(1) 

You  may  be  required  to  testify  under  oath  and/or  call  witnesses  to 
testify  in  support  of  your  petition.    You  will  have  the  burden  of 
proving what you have said in your petition. 

The hearing will usually happen as follows: 

 

   

(2) 

(3) 

The  judge  may  have  to  postpone  the  hearing  if  it  is  going  to  take  a 
long time to hear all the necessary testimony. 

The judge may order mediation  under Probate Rule  4.5. (The  court’s 
order will  provide details  about the mediator and how mediation will 
be conducted and paid for.) 

If  the  judge  decides  it  is  necessary  to  appoint  a  guardian,  the  judge  may 
appoint  any  adult  whose  appointment  would  be  in  the  best  interests  of  the 
minor.  Alaska statutes give priority to adult family members.13  "Adult family 
member" means a person who is at least 18 years old and who is the minor's 
grandparent,  aunt,  uncle,  or  sibling;  or  the  legal  guardian  or  parent  of  the 
minor’s  sibling.14    Full-blood,  half-blood,  and  adopted  relatives  are  included 
equally in this definition. 

If the minor is 14 years of age or older, and the minor nominated someone to 
be guardian, the judge must appoint the minor’s nomination, unless the judge 
finds that it would be contrary to the minor’s best interests. 

f  necessary,  the  judge  may  appoint  a  temporary  guardian.    A  temporary 
guardian lasts for no more than six months.15 

  I

At any time during the case, the judge can appoint an attorney for the minor.  
This  may  happen  if  the  judge  believes  that  additional  help  is  needed  to 
represent the minor’s interests.16

After  appointing  the  guardian  and  after  the  guardian  has  filed  a  written 
acceptance  of  the  appointment  (on  form  PG-630),  the  court  will  issue  a 
document  called  Letters  of  Guardianship  of  a  Minor  (form  PG-635).    The 
guardian can get certified copies of this document from the court for proof of the 
guardianship  and  of  the  guardian’s  authority  to  make  legal  decisions  on  the 
minor’s behalf (for example, at schools, hospitals, government agencies, etc.). 

b. 

Annual Reports 

. 

Change of Address 

Every  year,  for  as  long  as  the  guardianship  lasts,  the  guardian  must  file  an 
Annual  Report  on  Guardianship  of  a  Minor  (PG-640)  with  the  court.    The 
court’s appointment order will tell you the date the report is due each year. 

Any time the minor or the guardian changes name or contact information, the 
guardian must immediately send written notice to the court and all parties in 
the  guardianship  case.17    Use  form  PG-195,  Notice  of  Change  of  Contact 
Information, to do this.   

d. 

Requests to Change the Guardianship 

 

At any time, the guardian, the minor, or any other interested person may ask 
the court to remove the current guardian and appoint a new guardian, appoint 
a co-guardian, end the guardianship, or change the terms of the guardianship 
order.    You  may  use  form  PG-190,  Petition  for  Review  of  Guardianship  or 
Conservatorship, to ask the court to do this.   
 
Termination of Guardianship 

The guardianship will end when the minor turns age 18, is adopted, or is married 
(whichever  happens  first).18    A  guardian  cannot  simply  stop  performing  the 
guardian’s duties  before one of  these things happens.   If the guardian believes 
the guardianship should end earlier, the guardian must first file a request with the 
court.    You  can  use  form  PG-190  to  file  the  request  to  end  the  guardianship 
early.  If granted, the court will issue a written order.

Probate Rules 14 & 15 
AS 13.26.101 - .186 

Alaska Statute 13.26.167 
Powers and Duties of Guardian of a Minor 

 guardian of a minor has the powers and responsibilities of a parent who has not 
been  deprived  of  custody  of  a  minor  and  unemancipated  child,  except  that  a 
guardian is not legally obligated to provide from the guardian's own funds for the 
ward and is  not  liable to third persons by  reason of the parental relationship  for 
acts of the ward.  In particular, and without qualifying the foregoing, a guardian 

must  take  reasonable  care  of  the  ward's  personal  effects  and  commence 
protective proceedings if necessary to protect other property of the ward; 

may  receive  money  payable  for  the  support  of  the  ward  to  the  ward's 
parent,  guardian  or  custodian  under  the  terms  of  any  statutory  benefit  or 
insurance system, or any private contract, devise, trust, conservatorship or 
custodianship;  the  guardian  also  may  receive  money  or  property  of  the 
ward paid  or delivered by  virtue of  AS  13.26.031;  any  sums so received 
shall  be  applied  to  the  ward's  current  needs  for  support,  care  and 
education; the guardian must exercise due care to conserve any excess for 
the  ward's  future  needs  unless  a  conservator  has  been  appointed  for  the 
estate of the ward, in which case excess shall be paid over at least annually 
to the conservator; sums so received by the guardian may not be used for 
compensation  for  the  guardian's  services  except  as  approved  by  order  of 
court  or  as  determined  by  a  duly  appointed  conservator  other  than  the 
guardian; a guardian may institute proceedings to compel the performance 
by any person of a duty to support the ward or to pay sums for the welfare 
of the ward; 

may facilitate the ward's education, social, or other activities and authorize 
medical or other professional care, treatment, or advice; a guardian is not 
liable  by  reason  of  this  consent  for  injury  to  the  ward  resulting  from  the 
negligence or acts of third persons unless it would have been illegal for a 
parent  to  have  consented;  a  guardian  may  consent  to  the  marriage  or 
adoption of the ward; 

must report the condition of the ward and of the ward's  estate which has 
been subject to the guardian's possession or control, as ordered by court on 
petition of any person interested in  the minor's welfare or as  required by 
court rule.
