      <pre>Rabinowitz Courthouse Artwork
Alaska Court System

Pub - 32 (White) 1/05

Rabinowitz Courthouse Main Entry

The Rabinowitz Courthouse, designed by local architectural ﬁ rm, Charles Bettisworth and Company in cooperation 
with McCool Carlson Green Architects, is a dynamic assemblage of three interlocking architectural forms located next 
to the Chena River in downtown Fairbanks.

Alaska Art, in a variety of media, is an integral part of the Rabinowitz Courthouse.  Commissioned as part of the Alaska 
Court System’s 1% for Public Art Program, the artwork incorporated several criteria and themes.  Pieces were selected 
to complement the architectural design themes of the building - namely, to blend classical and contemporary forms, to 
reﬂ ect the natural environment of the region, and to express the concept of justice and dignity of the court.

The blending of old and new is a repeated theme, and it is especially evident in Sitka artist, Teri Rofkar’s “Tlingit 
Raven’s Tail Weavings”.  Several traditional and contemporary masks by Alaskan artists continue this theme.

The natural environment of Fairbanks is characterized by the proximity of the Tanana River valley, the Tanana Yukon 
uplands, and views of the Alaska Range.  Situated at the 65th parallel, Fairbanks is marked by extreme contrasts of 
seasons and light.  These factors are reﬂ ected in several artworks.

Todd Sherman’s paintings depict the natural environment in three seasons.  Bill Brody’s “A Wilderness of Mystery” 
depicts the untamed wilderness just beyond Fairbanks.  Kes Woodward’s “Higher Ground I & II” show us a glimpse 
of northern interior winter.  Keith Appel’s “Arctic Sonata” responds to the preponderance of short days and low light 
conditions by the use of ﬁ ber optic illumination.  Ron Senuungetuk’s “Sila” is reminiscent of the aurora borealis.

Expressions of justice and the dignity of the court are found in Evgeny Baranov’s portrait of Justice Jay A. Rabinowitz.  
The movement of Wanda Chin’s hanging sculpture, “Crossing Over” evokes the energy and works of the courts.

Located on the exterior wall of the courthouse to the right of the 
main  entrance,  “Arctic  Sonata”,  a  3-dimensional  sculpture  by 
well-known Alaskan artist Keith Appel, is an integral part of the 
building’s architecture.  The angles of the sculpture complement 
the  strong  angles  and  dynamic  assemblage  of  the  building’s 
architectural  forms.    Like  the  courthouse  itself,  the  sculpture’s 
apprearance  changes  dramatically  from  varying  perspectives.

During the dark winter days and nights, the sculpture’s appearance 
under reﬂ ected lights from ﬁ ber optic sources takes on a warm 
and welcoming glow.  The colors and movement of lights on the 
sculpture’s surface enhance its dynamic nature and strong lines.  The 
overall effect of the piece in low light conditions is reminiscent of the 
aurora borealis, a commom phenomenon at this northern latitude.

The title of the piece, “Arctic Sonata”, is taken from the musical 
composition that can be a movement in four distinct but related 
parts.    Like  a  sonata,  each  distinct  segment  of  the  sculpture 
relates  to  the  whole  just  as  the  distinct  functions  carried  out 
within the building contribute to the ofﬁ cial business of the court.

  First Floor Lobby

The entry lobby with its two-story columns 
and ceiling, formal staircase, and second 
ﬂ
 oor  balcony  reﬂ ects  the  gravity  of  court 
business  while  the  warm  earth  tones 
of  the  ﬁ nishes  and  the  generous  use  of 
glass  enhance  and  provide  a  welcoming 
entrance.    The  large  volume  of  the  entry 
lobby  accommodates  three  substantial 
artworks.    A  portrait  of  Justice  Jay  A. 
Rabinowitz,  for  whom  the  courthouse  is 
named, is a focal point at the head of the 
stairway leading to the second ﬂ oor. “Sila”, 
a  mobile  sculpture  by  Ron  Senungetuk, 
is  suspended  from  three  points.    “A 
Wilderness  of  Mystery”  copper  mural 
hangs  below  the  second  ﬂ oor  balcony.

Former  Chief  Justice  Jay  A.  Rabinowitz  from  Fairbanks  served 
the  people  of  Alaska  as  a  judge  and  then  as  a  supreme  court 
justice for thirty-two years.  This oil portrait, painted while Justice 
Rabinowitz  was  still  alive,  is  devoid  of  auxiliary  elements  to 
depict  him  not  so  much  as  a  symbol  of  judicial  power  but  as 
the  multi-faceted  human  being  he  was.    Evgeny  Baranov,  a 
classically  trained  portrait  artist,  has  painted  royalty  in  Europe.

Ron Senungetuk

The term “Sila” is an Inupiaq term for cosmos.  The 
sculputure is constructed of tapered laminated silver 
maple strips in a variety of lengths and with stainless 
steel components.  The artist, Ron Senungetuk, is 
formerly  of  Fairbanks  and  now  resides  in  Homer.

Fairbanks  artist,  Bill  Brody  created  this  30’  x  4’  mural 
that  shows  a  panoramic  view  looking  up  American 
Creek  to  Mount  Prindle,  the  tallest  mountain  in  the 
White Mountains.  The autumn colors of the dwarf birch, 
berries, and lichen counterpoint the cooler tones of the 
mountains, granite tors, and blowing sky.  The mural is 
intended to foster the connection between the enduring 
beauty of the Alaska wilderness and the peole who live 
and  work  in  Fairbanks,  on  the  verge  of  the  untamed 
outdoors.  The copper panels are carved by techniques 
derived  from  printmaking,  and  the  painting  was  done 
with  small,  soft  brushes  using  transparent  colors.

  Law Library, First Floor

The library space is enlivened with eight vividly colored photographs of Alaska wildﬂ owers, plants, and trees.  
These are a representative sample:

Devil’s Club photographed 
by Rick Urion of Juneau

Wild Iris photographed
by Patrick Endres of Fairbanks

Forget-Me-Not photographed 
by Robert Olson of Anchorage

Rick  Urion  ﬁ nds  photography  a  greatly  rewarding  outlet  and  for  a  number  of  years  has  gained  creative 
satisfaction  from  his  endeavors  to  capture  Alaska  nature.    Lured  to  Alaska  in  the  pursuit  of  adventure  and 
education,  Patrick  Endres  has  spent  20  years  photographing  Alaska’s  interior  and  coastal  areas.    Robert 
Olson enjoys the scenery in the Arctic and Sub-Arctic regions.  He is accomplished in wildlife ecology and is 
dedicated to preserving nature.  He hopes his photographs will inspire us to protect our natural environment.

The smaller pieces are designs from 
the  robe’s  borders;  the  largest,  from 
its  center.    Each  piece  represents 
a  traditional  story.    The  weavings 
are  merino  wool  with  sea  otter  trim.

  Third & Fourth Floor Lobbies

The  third  ﬂ oor  lobby  repeats  some  of  the  architectural 
elements fo the main lobby on a much smaller scale.  Like 
the  main  lobby,  a  two-story  colonnade  deﬁ nes  the  space 
and a balcony overlooks the lobby.  “Crossing Over”, a metal 
sculpture of painted aluminum sheet and mesh by Fairbanks 
artist Wanda Chin and her associates, is suspended from 
the fourth ﬂ oor ceiling.  “Fairway Rock”, a ten-panel mural of 
carved wood by well known Alaskan artist, Ron Senungetuk, 
adds  color  and  interest  to  the  third  ﬂ oor  elevator  wall.

12

The movement of this sculpture evokes 
the energy and work of the court, while the 
light passing through the mesh represents 
illumination brought forth by judicial 
proceedings.

The simple geometric human 
shapes signify the people 
whose lives are deﬁ ned and 
affected by law.

The double scrolled copper 
knives signify the traditional 
people of the area, the 
Athabascans, as well as 
commerce - another aspect of 
life governed by law.

Wanda Chin with associates Wendy Ernst Croskrey and T. Michael Croskrey

  Third Floor Lobby

The ten-unit mural depicts a migration route for animals and birds in the Bering Strait.  Fairway Rock, located 
on the International Date Line, was a place for harvesting sea bird eggs.  During the Cold War, it was used by 
the U.S. Navy.

The artist is most well know for carved wood panels such as these.

  Fourth Floor Lobby

Created by local artist Kathleen Carlo Kendall, these cedar masks are 
designed so that light from the windows is reﬂ ected by the gold leaf of 
the eyes and mouths symbolizing the truth to be seen and spoken.  The 
title and the artist are Koyukon Athabascan.  The two masks - one male 
and one female - combine contemporary and traditional Native Alaskan 
inﬂ uences.    The  handprint  of  a  child  represents  the  loss  of  victims.

“Heneedodeetolggul”
“he shall judge them, decide their fate”

  Fifth Floor Lobby

The ﬁ fth ﬂ oor lobby is populated with two large oil paintings and a collection of impressive native masks.  These 
masks reveal the beliefs and traditions of the Yupik and Inuapiaq inhabitants of the northern regions of Alaska.

This colorful spruce wood “keeper” 
mask was carved by Dan Mayne 
and inspired by a Kotzebue elder.  
The lesson depicts the opposing 
fate of the hunter.  The giant will 
harbor the considerate hunter and 
capture the disrespectful one.

Joshua Mathlaw’s Yupik spirit 
mask is made of wood which is 
painted, fashioning the snowy owl.

16

Crafted by Richard Quidvy of Mountain 
Village, cottonwood, alabaster, and 
soapstone are melded to create this 
exceptional loon mask.

Umara Buchea’s skin mask mirrors the faces 
of the Siberian Yupik people.  Caribou hide 
is molded over carved cedar and trimmed 
with polar bear and beaver fur and adorned 
with hair beads.  The face is decorated with 
intricate Yupik tatoos.

17

  Fifth Floor Lobby (continued)

Mary  Beans  Evans’  spirit  mask  titled  “Making  A  Way  of  Prayer”  represents  asking  for  good  fortune 
for  the  Hunters.    The  inner  ring  symbolized  earth,  land,  and  sea  while  the  outer  ring  symbolizes  the 
universe,  heavens,  and  stars.    The  face  is  split  in  two;  the  cottonwood  bark  being  spirit  and  the  soapstone 
being  man.    The  hunter  encountered  a  bear,  symbolized  by  the  scratch  on  the  bark  side  of  the  face.  
The  teardrop  on  the  soapstone  side  of  the  face  illustrates  the  loss  of  traditional  hunting  practices.

18

Kes Woodward’s dual oil paintings of winter birches portray a window into the northern forest and 
adorn the elevated site of the ﬁ fth ﬂ oor lobby, while exemplifying the lofty ideals that are enshrined in 
our system of justice.

Myron  Wright  came  to  Alaska  in  1971.    As  a  pilot,  he  was  fascinated  with  the  beauty 
and  expansiveness  of  Alaska  as  seen  from  the  air.    Inspired  by  Alaska  he  chose 
photography  as  his  medium  to  express  the  beauty  of  his  surroundings.    His  desire  to 
capture  the  grandeur  of  Alaska  has  led  him  to  specializing  in  panoramic  photography.
