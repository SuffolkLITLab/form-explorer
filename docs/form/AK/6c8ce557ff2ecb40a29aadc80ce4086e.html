      <pre>Legislative 
Branch  

Executive 
Branch 

Judicial 
Branch 

The American Democratic system of 
government is based upon the provisions of 
our federal (United States) and state 
constitutions. They describe a government 
consisting of three co-equal branches. In 
Alaska state government, these branches are: 

• The Legislative Branch, consisting of
members of the Alaska Legislature
(the Senate and the House of
Representatives). The Legislative
Branch is responsible for creating
state laws and appropriating funds.

• The Executive Branch, consisting of

the Governor and the state
departments, which work under the
direction of the Governor. The
Executive Branch administers and
enforces state laws.

• The Judicial Branch, which includes
the Alaska Supreme Court and the
judges, magistrates and court
employees who work under the
direction of the Supreme Court. The
Alaska Court System resolves
disputes brought before it, by applying
state laws, federal laws, and the
provisions of the state and federal
constitutions to the facts of these
disputes.

Our system of government is structured in 

this manner to avoid any one branch from 
becoming too powerful. The powers and 
responsibilities of each branch provide 
checks and balances on the powers and 
responsibilities of the other two branches. 

The Judicial Branch is commonly 

called the court system. In Alaska state 
government, it includes the Alaska Court 
System, the Alaska Judicial Council, and the 
Alaska Commission on Judicial Conduct. 

WHAT DO COURTS DO? 

There are eight accepted purposes of court: 
• To do individual justice in individual

cases

• To resolve cases in a manner that

promotes public trust in our system of
government

• To provide a forum for the peaceful

resolution of legal disputes

• To protect individuals from the arbitrary

use of governmental power

• To provide a formal record of legal

• To deter criminal behavior
• To rehabilitate persons convicted of

status

crimes

• To separate persons convicted of crimes

from society, in appropriate cases

WHAT IS JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE? 

Our system of government evolved from the 
English system. When the judicial system first 
evolved in England, judges served at the 
whim of the king. The kind could, and 
sometimes did, “fire” judges whose decisions 
displeased him. The former British colonists 
who created the United States placed a 
strong emphasis on establishing a judicial 
branch of government, which is co-equal with 
the executive and legislative branches. The 
Declaration of Independence cites the lack of 
independence of the British judiciary as one of 
the justifications for establishing the United 
States, independent of England: 

…He [the king] has obstructed the
Administration of Justice, by refusing his 
Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary 
power. He has made Judges dependent of his 
Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and 
the amount and payment of their salaries. 
The term “judicial independence” reflects 
the principle that judges must be free to 
decide individual cases based upon the 
judge’s considered judgment about the 
law and the facts of the case, rather than 
public opinion about the case. 

WHY IS JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE 
IMPORTANT? 

The citizens of our country and state 
are entitled to have access to a court system 
where their disputes will be decided by a 
judge who considers the facts of each case 
impartially, applying the law to the facts of 
each case to reach a decision. Each person 
who brings a case in Alaska’s courts should 
feel that his or her case will be measured on 
its individual merits, by a judge who is free 
from bias and political obligation. 

Sometimes judges have to make 

unpopular decisions. Sometimes, for 

public opinion about these judicial candidates. 
The judicial Council sends only the most 
qualified candidates to the Governor, who 
must appoint a judge from the pool of 
approved candidates. 

Judges must stand for periodic 

retention elections, at which the voters of 
Alaska decide whether to allow each judge to 
continue to work as a judge in Alaska’s 
courts. Before each retention election, the 
Alaska Judicial Council conducts a 
comprehensive process of collecting 
information about the performance of each 
judge, and makes that information available to 
the public. 

The Commission on Judicial Conduct 

is a watchdog agency, which investigates 
complaints against judges. The commission 
can recommend to the Alaska Supreme Court 
that individual judges be disciplined or 
removed, as appropriate. 

Under Alaska’s Constitution, the state 

legislature can also impeach any judge or 
justice for serious wrongful and illegal actions. 

Judicial accountability and judicial 

independence are elements that work 
together in our system of justice. 

Judicial independence is not for the 
protection of judges, but for the protection 
of the public. It is an essential element of 
out system of democratic government.

example, a judge may conclude that an 
individual citizen has a constitutional right, 
which is in conflict with a law passed by the 
legislature. In such circumstances, a judge 
must exercise independent judgment to 
protect the individual citizen, or a group of 
citizens in the same situation, by declaring the 
law unconstitutional and unenforceable. A 
judge must take this action even if the law is 
generally favored by many of the state’s 
citizens. The separation of the three branches 
of government and principles of judicial 
independence preserve the judge’s ability to 
protect individual constitutional rights in this 
manner. It would be extremely difficult for a 
judge to exercise independent judgment if 
representatives of another branch of 
government could summarily revoke from 
office or the judge, or if our system of 
government allowed the judge’s decision to 
be ignored. 

BUT SHOULDN’T JUDGES BE 
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS? 

Yes, judges should be held 

accountable – and they are. Judges decisions 
may be appealed to higher courts for review. 
The decisions of appellate courts (courts that 
review lower court decisions) are also 
potentially subject to review by higher courts – 
even, in limited circumstances, by the United 
States Supreme Court. 

Judicial independence does not mean 

that a judge who acts in inappropriate ways 
cannot be disciplined or removed from office. 
A citizen in Alaska cannot be made a 
judge of the Alaska Court System unless he 
or she first meets stringent standards relating 
to education, experience and integrity. The 
Alaska Judicial Council conducts an intensive 
screening of all persons who seek to become 
state our judges, to determine their fitness for 
office. This process includes a solicitation of
