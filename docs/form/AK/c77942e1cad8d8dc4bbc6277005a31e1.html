ORDER TO DEBTOR AND NOTICE 
(RE: Section .020 Property) 

AS 09.38.020, .065, 
.075, .085 and .120; 
8 AAC 95.030 

NOTICE  OF  INTENT  TO  LEVY  AND 
NOTICE  OF  RIGHT  TO CLAIM  EXEMPTIONS 

On 
pay to 

, the above  court  entered a judgment  that you must 

the sum of $ 

. 

(judgment creditor) 

Since  you  have  not  paid  this  judgment,  the  creditor  has  asked  the  court  for  an  order 
(called a "Writ of Execution") which will allow the creditor to seize some of your property 
and sell it to pay your debt. 

The  property  the  creditor  wants  to  seize  is  listed  on  the  attached  form  entitled 
"Creditor's  Affidavit  and  Request."    However,  before the  court  will  allow the  creditor  to 
seize these items, the court is giving you a chance to object. 

How to Object 

If you want to object to the creditor taking this property from you, you must: 

1. Fill out the attached "Claim of Exemptions" form.

2. File it with the clerk of court at the following address (either by mail or in person):
Clerk of Court 

3. Complete  steps  1 and 2  within  15 days  from  the  date of  issuance of  the  above
order.  (Note:  If you mail it, it must arrive at the clerk's office within the 15 days.)

In paragraph 4 of the "Claim of Exemptions" form, you must explain why you think your 
property  is  "exempt."    "Exempt"  property  is  property  which  is  protected  by  law  from 
being taken from you to pay your debts. 

Exempt Property 

There is an Alaska Statute (AS 09.38.020) which may protect ("exempt") some of your 
property.    According  to  this  statute  (as  adjusted  by  8  AAC  95.030),  every  Alaska 
resident gets exemptions (protection) for the following amounts of personal property: 

a. Up  to  $4,050  worth  of  household  goods,  clothes,  books,  musical  instruments,

c. Up to $3,780 worth of professional books and tools of your trade

family portraits or heirlooms

b. Up to $1,350 worth of jewelry

d. Up to $1,350 for pets

exceed $27,000.

e. Up to $4,050 for one motor vehicle if the full value of the motor vehicle does not

The exempt amounts shown above are for the fair market value of your interest in the 
property, exclusive of liens of record. 

Note:  These "exemptions" are not automatically given to you.  You must claim them or 
you will lose them.

ORDER TO DEBTOR AND NOTICE 
(RE: Section .020 Property) 

AS 09.38.020, .065, 
.075, .085 and .120; 
8 AAC 95.030 

WARNING:    You  will  not  get  an  exemption  for  any  of  the  items  listed  above  if  the  judgment 
against  you  is  (1)  for  the  purchase  price  of  that  item,  (2)  for  a  loan  made  to  enable  you  to 
purchase the item (and used for that purpose), or (3) for labor or materials furnished to make, 
repair, improve, preserve, store, or transport the item.  For example, if the debt you owe is for 
the purchase price of a car, you cannot claim an exemption for that car, but you may claim any 
other exemption on the list. 

NOTE:  These exemptions are not available if the judgment against you is for child support, the 
payment of an employee's wages (up to one month's earnings) or state or local taxes. 

ALSO NOTE:  Only the exemptions in paragraphs "a" and "c" above will be available to you if 
the  judgment  against  you  is  to  compensate  the  victim  of  a  felony  of  which  you  have  been 
convicted. 

If you have questions about your exemptions, you are urged to seek the advice of a lawyer. 

If you fail to claim your exemptions, your spouse or a dependent, or any other person authorized 
by law (for example, a guardian) may claim your exemptions or assert the rights provided in the 
exemptions law.   Note:  At the hearing on the claim of exemptions, the court may require you 
(judgment  debtor)  to  be  present  because  court  rules  state  that  no  one  except  you  or  your 
attorney can represent you in court. 

After You File Your Claim 
After  you  file  your  "Claim  of  Exemptions"  form  with  the  court,  the  court  will  set  a  date  for  a 
hearing at which the court will decide whether your property is exempt.  The court will tell you 
the hearing date.  You must attend the hearing. 

At the hearing, you must prove your right to an exemption.  You should bring to the hearing any 
documents or other evidence supporting your claim. 

If  the  hearing  is  held  in  a  city  other  than  where  you  live  and  it  will  be  too  inconvenient  and 
expensive for you to attend the hearing, you may ask the court to move the hearing to another 
city more convenient to you. 

Things to Remember 
1. You  must  file  your  "Claim  of  Exemptions"  with  the  court  within  15  days  of  the  "Date  of

Issuance" shown on page 1 at the bottom of the "Order to Debtor."

2.

3.

It  is  not  enough  to  notify  the  creditor  or  the  creditor's  attorney  of  your  claim,  you  must  file
your claim with the court.

If you do not file your claim within 15 days or if you do not attend the hearing on your claim,
the court may decide you have given up your right to the exemptions.

4. The "Order to Debtor" on the first page of this form means you cannot sell or in any other
way  dispose  of  any  of  the  property  listed  on  the  creditor's  affidavit  for  30  days  or  until  the
court orders otherwise.
