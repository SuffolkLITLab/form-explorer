      <pre>MOTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR CIVIL CASES 
(For parties not represented by lawyers) 
 
These instructions are for motions in civil cases.  Do not use them in criminal cases, domestic 
violence cases, cases concerning child custody or support, or small claims.  See page 3 for a list 
of forms that can be used in those types of cases. 
 
A  “motion”  is  a  request  to  a  judge  for  an  order  that  decides  an  issue  that  comes  up  during  a 
lawsuit.  A motion can be made by any party to the lawsuit. 

ome examples of motions are: 

Motion to request a new court date 
Motion to appear by telephone 
Motion to require other party to provide information 
Motion for extension of time 

otion procedure is governed by the Alaska Rules of Court.  The main rule on motions is Civil 
Rule  77.   Other important  rules  are  Civil  Rule  5  (about  serving  copies  on  other  parties),  Civil 
Rule 6 (about how time limits are calculated), and Civil Rule 7(b) (about the form of motions). 

he Alaska Rules of Court are available for review at all state courts, court law libraries, many 
city libraries and on the Alaska Court System’s web site: www.courts.alaska.gov/rules/index.htm  

Civil Rules 5(g), 6, 7(b) and 77 

Fill out and sign the Motion form (CIV-805).   The location of the court, the plaintiff, the 
defendant and the case number will be the same as they are on the complaint and other 
documents in your case. 

In the "Notice to Opposing Party" at the bottom of the form, fill in the mailing address of 
the court where you will file your motion. 

Be sure to fill out the "Certificate of Service" on page 2, describing how you will give a 
copy to the opposing party. 

Prepare a proposed order for the judge’s signature (on form CIV-820).   In the  "Further 
Orders"  section  of  the  order  form,  you  must  state  exactly  what  you  want  the  judge  to 
order.  For example: 

If you are asking the judge to order the defendant to give you a copy of your tax 
return, you could write:  "Defendant Dorothy Jones shall deliver to Plaintiff Peter 
Jones a photocopy of their joint federal tax return for 2001 by August 26, 2002." 

If you are asking for more time to answer a complaint, you could write:  "The due 
date for defendant's answer is extended to September 7, 2002." 

Mail (by first class mail) or hand-deliver to the opposing party: 

a copy of your motion (including the certificate of service on page 2),

a copy of your proposed order, and  

a copy of any documents attached to the motion. 

Note:  If the opposing party is represented in this case by an attorney, or was represented 
by an attorney within the past year, you must send the motion to the attorney rather than 
to the other party.  The court file will contain the attorney's name and address. 

Make a copy of the motion, proposed order and any attachments for yourself. 

Mail  or  hand-deliver  the  original  of  the  motion  and  the  proposed  order  to  the  court  in 
which your case is filed.  There is no fee for filing a motion.

he  opposing  party  has  the  right  to  file  a  response  to  the  motion.    (The  CIV-808  Response 
Packet explains how to do this.)  The time limit for filing a response depends on how the motion 
was delivered to the opposing party. 

If delivered in person:  10 days from the date of delivery 

If delivered by first class mail:  13 days from the date of mailing 

xception:    A  few  motions  have  different  time  limits  for  the  response.    See  Civil  Rule 
77(c)(2)(ii) and (iii).  Example: motions that will end the case (motions to dismiss, motions for 
summary judgment and motions for judgment on the pleadings). 

he opposing party must send you a copy of any response sent to the court. 

Response 

Reply 

f you receive a response to your motion, you can file a "reply."  The time limit for filing a reply 
depends on how the response was delivered to you. 

If  delivered  in  person:    5  days  from  the  date  of  delivery  (not  counting  weekends  or 
holidays) 
If  delivered  by  first  class  mail:    8  days  from  the  date  it  was  postmarked  (not  counting 
weekends or holidays). 

ou can use the reply form (CIV-815) provided in this packet.  File the original of  your reply 
(including the certificate of service on page 2) with the court; send a copy to the opposing party; 
and keep a copy for yourself.  
 

Judge’s Decision 
 
After the time period for response and reply has elapsed, the judge will decide the motion.  If the 
judge believes a hearing is necessary before deciding the motion, a hearing will be scheduled.  
You  will  be  notified  of  the  time,  date  and  location  of  the  hearing  and,  probably,  whether  the 
hearing will be an evidentiary hearing followed by oral argument or just oral argument.  At an 
"evidentiary  hearing,"  the  party  bringing  the  motion  has  the  burden  of  proving  the  reasons  to 
grant the motion.  The party must present evidence, which may include the party's own testimony 
or  other  witnesses'  testimony.    The  party  opposing  the  motion  may  present  similar  evidence 
(testimony)  in  opposition.    At  "oral  argument,"  the  parties  explain  what they  want  and  answer 
any questions the judge might have.  No further testimony or witnesses are presented.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
