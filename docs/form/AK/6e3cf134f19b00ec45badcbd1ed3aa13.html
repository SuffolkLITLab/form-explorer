INTRODUCTION

Bail Amounts

The  "bail"  amounts  on  the  following  lists  are  set  by  the  Alaska  Supreme  Court  under  the 
authority of AS 28.05.151 (for motor vehicle and traffic offenses), AS 45.75.133 (for oversize 
vehicle  offenses)  and  AS  05.25.090(c)  (for  watercraft  offenses).    These  statutes  require  the 
supreme  court  to  determine  the  offenses  that  are  appropriate  for  disposition  without  court 
appearance and to establish a schedule of bail amounts for them.  The bail amounts are listed in 
Administrative Rules 43.1, 43.6, and 43.8.

Any recommendations for changes in the bail amounts should be sent to the following address 
before July 1 each year.  Please include an explanation of the reason for the recommendation.

Optional Appearance Offenses

If a bail amount is set for an offense, it is an “optional appearance” offense. A person charged 
with such an offense must, within 30 days, do one of the following:

1. Pay the total amount due (bail amount plus surcharge) with a credit card online on the Alaska 

Court System website, or

2.  Follow the instructions in the “optional appearance” section of the citation form and mail or 

deliver the citation to the address given. The three options in that section are:
a. check the NO CONTEST box and pay the fine and surcharge amounts written on the 

citation by mail, OR

b. check the NOT GUILTY box, requesting a trial, OR
c. check the box: “I do not wish to enter a plea at this time.  I want to appear in court to 
have a judge explain the charges and my rights to me before I enter a plea." (This 
hearing is an arraignment.)

If the person asks for a trial and is found guilty, the maximum fine which may be imposed is the 
bail amount (plus any surcharge).  AS 12.25.230(c), AS 45.75.133(e), and Administrative Rules 
43.1, 43.6 and 43.8.  Therefore, a person charged with an offense for which a bail amount has 
been set (whether it is an infraction, a violation, or a misdemeanor) does  not have a right to a 
jury or to a court-appointed lawyer.

If no bail amount is set for an offense, the defendant must appear in court for arraignment (unless 
another statute or regulation makes the offense correctable as discussed below).

 1

Maximum Amount for  Per  Mile,  etc.  Offenses.    The  maximum  bail  amount  for  any  offense  in 
which the bail is stated as an amount per mile, per foot, per lamp, per reflector, per tire, or per 
wheel  is  the  maximum  fine  allowed  by  statute  for  the  offense.    For  example,  AS  28.90.010(c) 
sets the maximum penalty for infractions defined in 13 AAC at $300.  Therefore, the maximum 
penalty  for  the  speeding  offenses  defined  in  13  AAC  is  $300.    These  maximum  amounts  are 
doubled  for  violations  of  AS  28  and  regulations  adopted  under  AS  28  committed  within  a 
highway work zone or traffic safety corridor.  Administrative Rule 43.1.

Correctable Offenses

If  the  “Bail”  column  for  an  offense  lists  “Corr”  followed  by  a  number,  the  offense  is  a 
Correctable/Optional Appearance offense.  A defendant charged with one of these offenses has 
several options for responding to the charge.  The defendant can:

1.

2.

Show the police proof of correction (or, for the license and insurance offenses, show the 
police or the court that the defendant had a license or insurance that was valid when the 
citation was issued) and get the citation dismissed, or

Choose one of the “optional appearance” options described above  (pay the total amount 
due  online  or  mail  in  the  citation  after  selecting  one  of  the  pleas  or  requesting  an 
arraignment).

The bail amount for the offense is the amount written after “Corr.”  When an officer charges one 
of these offenses, the officer must check the “Correctable” box on the citation and also write in 
the bail and surcharge amounts and the total due.  If the defendant shows an inspection official 
proof that the defect has been corrected, the citation must be dismissed.   Administrative Rule 
43.1 and Minor Offense Rule 5(a)(4)  

An  offense  is  listed  as  correctable  only  if  there  is  a  statute  or  regulation  authorizing  dismissal 
upon correction.  Examples of correctable vehicle and traffic offense are:  AS 28.15.131 (failure 
to carry license and exhibit it on demand), AS 28.22.019 (proof of insurance to be carried and 
exhibited  on  demand),  and  equipment  violations  on  non-commercial  vehicles  under  13  AAC 
04.008.

Note:  Although  AS  28.05.099(b)  makes  failure  to  provide  a  child  safety  device  [AS 
28.05.095(b)] a dismissible offense the first time it is charged, we have not included it among the 
"Corr" offenses because subsequent charges are not dismissible.

 2

Mandatory Appearance Offenses

If the “Bail” column for an offense lists any of the following abbreviations, a defendant charged 
with the offense must appear in court:

Mand/Inf

Mand/Viol

= a  traffic  infraction  which  requires  a  mandatory  appearance  in  court  for 
arraignment.    A  defendant  charged  with  a  traffic  infraction  does  not  have  a 
right to a jury or to a court-appointed lawyer.  AS 28.90.010(d).

= a violation which requires a mandatory appearance in court for arraignment.  
A defendant charged with an offense classified as a "violation" does not have 
a right to a jury trial or to a court-appointed lawyer.  AS 11.81.900(b)(67).

Mand/A misd = mandatory appearance Class A misdemeanor
Mand/B misd = mandatory appearance Class B misdemeanor
Mand/N misd = mandatory appearance Not Classified misdemeanor
= mandatory appearance Class A felony
Mand/A fel
= mandatory appearance Class B felony
Mand/B fel
Mand/C fel
= mandatory appearance Class C felony
Defendants charged with these misdemeanors and Class C felonies must appear in court for 

arraignment or felony first appearance.  A defendant charged with a 
misdemeanor or felony for which no bail forfeiture amount has been set has a 
right to a jury trial and (if indigent) to a lawyer at government expense.

Points

Points for traffic offenses are not set by the supreme court.  They are set by the Department of 
Administration  in  Alaska  Administrative  Code  regulation  2  AAC  90.310  (printed  at  end  of 
booklet).

The purpose of the point system, according to AS 28.15.221, is to identify "habitually reckless or 
negligent drivers and habitual or frequent violators of traffic laws."  Under this law, a person's 
driver's license can be suspended or revoked by the Department of Administration if the person 
accumulates  "12  or  more  points  as  a  result  of  offenses  committed  during  any  consecutive 
12-month  period  or  18  or  more  points  as  a  result  of  offenses  committed  during  any  24-month 
period."

The  statutes  concerning  the  point  system  are AS  28.15.221  to AS  28.15.261.    The  regulations 
which were written to carry out the legislature's intent are in the Alaska Administrative Code: 2 
AAC 90.310 to 2 ACC 90.380. 

If you believe the points listed in this booklet are incorrect or if you believe the regulation which 
sets them (2 AAC 90.310) should be amended, write to:

When recommending changes in the points, please keep in mind the following limitations on the 
point system:

1. By  statute  [AS  28.15.221(a)],  points  are  to  be  assigned  "for  convic-tions  for  violations  of 
traffic laws that are required to be reported to the [Department of Administration] under AS 
28.15.191 and AS 28.37.130."

a. The  term  "traffic  laws"  is  defined  in AS  28.15.261  to  mean  "statutes,  regulations,  and 

municipal ordinances governing the driving or movement of vehicles."

b. Convictions which are required to be reported under AS 28.15.191 are convictions "of an 
offense  under  [Title  28]  or  a  regulation  adopted  under  [Title  28],  or  another  law  or 
regulation of this state, or a municipal ordinance that regulates the driving of vehicles."  
A conviction of a standing or parking offense need not be reported.

2. Points may not be assigned to laws, regulations or ordinances "regulating standing, parking, 
equipment,  size,  or  weight;  nor  may  points  be  assessed  for  violations  by  pedestrians, 
passengers or bicycle riders, or for violations of provisions relating to the preservation of the 
condition of traffic-control devices on the highways.  Points shall be assessed for violations 
of  oversize  or  overweight  permits  relating  only  to  restrictions  upon  speed  or  hours  of 
operation."  AS 28.15.231(b).

Processing Codes

Most of the processing codes in the fifth column of the numerical list of offenses are selected by 
the  Division  of  Motor  Vehicles  from  a  list  of  codes  and  definitions  required  by  the  federal 
government.  These  codes  designate  the  description  of  the  offense  which  will  appear  on  the 
defendant's driving record.  They also cause the computer to assign the correct number of points 
to the offense.  

Note:    The  ZZZ  code  means  there  is  no  code  for  the  offense  on  the  national  list  of  required 
codes.    Offenses  with  a  ZZZ  code  do  not  have  points  and  do  not  appear  on  people’s  driving 
records.

Also Note:  The processing codes for watercraft offenses are established by the Department of 
Public Safety.

Penalty Section

This  version  of  the  booklet  (Version  B)  does  not  include  references  to  the  statutes  which 
describe the possible penalties the court can impose for each offense. For this information, see 
Version A of the booklet. 

Note: In spite of the penalty section statutes, the maximum penalty for any offense for which a 
bail amount has been set is the bail amount (plus any surcharge). This is true whether the 
defendant pleads no contest or chooses to contest the citation. See AS 12.25.230(c), AS 
45.75.133(e) and Administrative Rules 43.1, 43.6 and 43.8. Also Note: If the bail amount is an 
amount per mile, per foot, etc., see the paragraph about “Maximum Amount” on page 2.

 4

Most  minor  offenses  and  some  misdemeanors  (if  allowed  by  AS  12.25.180)  are  charged  on 
citation forms, but they can also be charged on complaint forms and informations. Minor Offense 
Rules 3 and 4; Criminal Rules 3 and 7.

Charging Document

Municipal Fine Schedules

Cities  that  want  to  use  a  mail-in  system  for  processing  traffic  citations  must  establish,  by  city 
ordinance,  a  “fine  schedule”  listing  those  city  traffic  offenses  which  do  not  require  court 
appearance.  See AS 28.05.151 and the other statutes revised by chapter 76 SLA 1987.  There are 
no supreme court "bail forfeiture" schedules for city offenses.  Many cities have, by ordinance, 
adopted  “by  reference”  (1)  state  traffic  laws  as  their  traffic  codes  and  (2)  the  supreme  court’s 
traffic and oversize vehicle bail forfeiture schedules as their “traffic fine schedules.” Cities can 
get  help  with  these  ordinances  by  contacting  the  administrative  office  of  the  court  system  at 
helpdesk@akcourts.gov

Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (49 CFR)

The “49 CFR” (Code of Federal Regulations) offenses can be found at the following website: 
www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/rules-regulations.htm  or at the U.S.  
Government Publishing Office website:  
www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title49/49tab_02.tpl

Police Training Surcharge

AS 12.55.039 adds a surcharge to the fine or other penalty for most offenses.  The surcharge is 
not part of the fine.  It must be assessed separately, listed separately on the citation and on the 
judgment, and receipted using a separate accounting code.

The surcharge is mandatory.  It may not be waived, deferred or suspended.   However, a judge 
may allow a defendant who is unable to pay the surcharge to perform community work service 
under AS 12.55.055(c) in lieu of the surcharge.  AS 12.55.039(b).

In imposing a fine, the court may not reduce the fine by the amount of the surcharge or otherwise 
consider the applicability of a surcharge to the offense.  AS 12.55.035(f).

AS 18.65.225 provides that the legislature may appropriate money collected under the surcharge 
law to the Alaska police training fund.

AS 29.25.074 requires cities to authorize the imposition of this surcharge for violation of their 
ordinances and to deposit the money collected into the state general fund.

A copy of the surcharge statute and AS 29.25.074 are printed inside the back cover.

The police training surcharge is case-related, not charge-related.  In Miller v State, 382 P.3d 
1192 (Alaska App. September 16, 2016), the Alaska Court of Appeals interpreted the surcharge 
statute to mean that, "only one surcharge should be imposed under AS 12.55.039 in any one 
criminal case."

Doubled Bail Amounts for Offenses in Highway Work Zones and Traffic Safety Corridors

Effective April 30, 1999, the bail amounts are doubled for violations of AS 28 and regulations 
adopted  under AS  28  (i.e.,  the  13  AAC  regulations  and  some  2  AAC  regulations)  committed 
within  a  highway  work  zone.    Administrative  Rule  43.1  and  AS  28.90.030.    A  copy  of  the 
statute and rule are printed at the end of the booklet).

Effective May  27, 2006, the bail amounts are doubled for violations of AS 28  and regulations 
adopted under AS 28 committed within a traffic safety corridor, as that term is defined in AS 
28.90.990.  Administrative Rule 43.1, AS 28.90.030, and AS 19.10.075.  See end of booklet. The 
website discussing the traffic safety corridors is:
http://dot.alaska.gov/stwdplng/hwysafety/safety_corridors.shtml

If an offense occurs in one of these zones or corridors, the officer charging the offense must state 
that on the citation.

In Linden Karl Fyfe v. State, 334 P.3d 183 (Alaska App. 2014), the Alaska Court of Appeals held 
that double fines do not apply to felony DUI committed in a traffic safety corridor. In reaching 
this conclusion, the court rejected the “plain meaning of the statute” approach to statutory 
interpretation and, instead, interpreted the double-fines statute based on its legislative history. 
The court, however, also stated: “at a minimum, the 1998 legislature intended the double-fine 
requirement to apply to offenses listed in the bail and fine schedules established under AS 28. 
05.151 (a) …” 

Default Judgments For Failure To Respond

If a defendant fails to respond to a citation or fails to appear for arraignment or trial in a minor 
offense case, the court may enter a default judgment of conviction against the defendant.  Minor 
Offense Rule 9 .  At least 15 days before the default judgment  is entered, the defendant must be 
sent a notice explaining the consequences of failure to respond.  If a default judgment is entered, 
it will be for the scheduled bail or fine amount or, if there is no scheduled amount, for the 
maximum penalty for the offense.  In addition, the default judgment will require the defendant to 
pay any surcharge established by statute, $25 in court costs and $25 in collection costs if the 
judgment is transferred for collection against the defendant’s Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend.  
Note, however, that the court may waive the collection costs upon a showing of good cause.  
Minor Offense Rule 10(f). 

Courts cannot issue a bench warrant for failure to respond or appear or for failure to satisfy the 
judgment in a minor offense case. Minor Offense Rule 9(d).

 6

 

Fatal Accidents - Court Appearance Required

Effective September 1, 2003, pursuant to AS 28.05.151(e), an offense with a bail amount may 
not be disposed of without court appearance if the offense happens in connection with a motor 
vehicle accident that results in the death of a person.  If this happens, the offender must be 
required to appear in court.  Administrative Rule 43.1. The officer must check the “Fatality” box 
in the “Offense” section of the citation. 

Service of Citations

Citations may not be filed with the court until the defendant has been served. Minor Offense 
Rule 3(a). The officer must certify on the citation that the officer served the citation on the 
defendant as required by AS 12.25.175 - 12.25.190.  Minor Offense Rule 3(f).  The citation must 
also show the method used to serve the citation on the defendant. Minor Offense Rule 3(c)(6). If 
the traffic offense involves a moving motor vehicle or if it is punishable by a fine of more than 
$500, the issuing officer must personally serve the citation on the defendant by handing the 
citation to the defendant.  See Minor Offense Rule 3(g) about this and for other methods of 
service that may be used for other types of offenses.

When Peace Officer Can Represent the Prosecution

Minor Offense Rule 12 allows peace officers to represent the prosecution in limited ways in 
minor offense cases.  Most, but not all, traffic offenses are “minor offenses.” See the definition 
of “minor offense” in Minor Offense Rule 2.  Minor Offense Rule 12(a)(2) describes what peace 
officers can do as representatives of the prosecution.

Rule 12(a)(2) states:

The representative may file a request to reschedule trial or a 
request to participate telephonically, and may give testimony, offer 
exhibits, or call witnesses for examination by the court. The 
representative may also defer prosecution and dismiss charges. The 
representative may not examine witnesses, make opening 
statements and closing arguments, or otherwise act as an attorney.

Uniform Minor Offense Table (UMOT)

End Notes

Maximum bail amount for 13 AAC “per mile” offenses:  $300.  Penalty Statute: AS 
28.90.010(c).  Maximum bail amount in highway work zone or traffic safety corridor:  
$600.

Maximum  bail  amount  for  49  CFR  “per  wheel,  per  tire,  per  lamp,  and  per  reflector” 
offenses:    $500.    Penalty  Statutes  for  these  “violations:” AS  45.75.380(a)(11)  and AS 
12.55.035(b)(7. The penalty and the maximum are not doubled in highway work zones 
or traffic safety corridors because bail amounts are only doubled if the offense is in Title 
28 or in a regulation adopted under Title  28 (i.e., the 13 AAC regulations and some  2 
AAC regulations).  See Administrative Rule 43.1 and AS 28.90.030.

Maximum bail amount for 17 AAC “per mile” offenses:  $500.  Penalty Statute for these 
misdemeanors:  AS  02.15.240.    The  penalty  and  the  maximum  are  not  doubled  in 
highway work zones or traffic safety corridors for the reason explained in note 2 above.

In addition to the offenses for which only a "bail" amount is listed, the other categories of 
offenses are:

=  correctable/dismissible.

The $50 penalty for littering is a fine, not a bail forfeiture amount. See AS 46.06.080 for 
the fine schedule that the legislature created for this offense.

*** Under AS 28.05.099, the court may waive the $15 penalty for violating AS 28.05.095(a) 
or  (d)  [safety  belts]  if  the  defendant  donates  $15  to  the  Emergency  Medical  Services 
entity providing services in the area in which the violation occurred.

Citations and complaints charging AS 28.35.280, .285 or .290 must be assigned underage 
alcohol  case  numbers,  even  though  these  offenses  are  classified  as  infractions  in  the 
statutes,  because  the  mandatory  community  work  service  penalty  triggers  the  rights  to 
court-appointed  counsel  and  a  jury  trial.    See  Administrative  Bulletin  7  on  case 
numbering.

April 30, 1999) and Traffic Safety Corridors (Effective May 27, 2006)

AS 28.90.030.  Fines for offenses committed within highway work zones and traffic safety 
corridors  doubled.    (a)  Whenever  a  person  violates  a  provision  of  this  title  or  a  regulation 
adopted under the authority of this title within a highway work zone or traffic safety corridor, 
notwithstanding  the  amount  of  the  fine  or  the  maximum  fine  set  under  this  title,  the  fine,  or 
maximum fine, is double the amount provided in this title.  (§ 2 ch 64 SLA 1998; am §§4, 5 ch 
45 SLA 2006)

AS 28.90.990.  Definitions. 

(a)(15)  “highway work zone” means an area identified by advance signing where road 
construction,  repair,  or  maintenance  work  is  being  done  on  or  adjacent  to  a  highway, 
whether or not work is actually being done at that time.

(a)(28)  “traffic safety corridor” means a portion of a highway on which signs have been 
erected designating that portion as a traffic safety corridor under AS 19.10.075

Administrative Rule 43.1, Traffic Bail Forfeiture Schedule, states (in its second paragraph):
Effective April 30, 1999, the bail amounts listed below are doubled for violations 
of AS 28 and regulations adopted under AS 28 committed within a highway work 
zone, as that term is defined in AS 28.90.990 and 13 AAC 40.010(b).  Effective 
May 27, 2006, the bail amounts listed below are doubled for violations of AS 28 
and regulations adopted under AS 28 committed with a traffic safety corridor, as 
that term is defined in AS 28.90.990.

AS 19.10.075.  Designation of Traffic Safety Corridors; fines.

(a)  To promote traffic safety, the department may designate a portion of a highway to be 
a traffic safety corridor. The commissioner shall establish criteria for the designation and 
continuation of traffic safety corridors. In establishing the criteria, the commissioner may 
consider accident data and reports, the type and volume of vehicular traffic, engineering 
and traffic studies, and other relevant factors. Before the department designates a traffic 
safety corridor,  the commissioner shall  consult with the commissioner of  public  safety 
and  shall  consult  with  other  local,  state,  and  federal  agencies  with  responsibility  for 
traffic safety. A motor vehicle or traffic offense committed in a traffic safety corridor is 
subject to a double fine as provided in AS 28.90.030.  The department shall erect signs 
designating traffic safety corridors and alerting the public that motor vehicle and traffic 
offenses committed within a corridor  are subject to double fines. A claim for damages 
may  not  be  made  against  the  state  or  its  officers,  employees,  or  agents  for  an  act  or 
omission  relating  to  the  designation  of  and  erection  of  signs  regarding  a  traffic  safety 
corridor.

(b)  The legislature may appropriate 50 percent of the fines for offenses committed in a 
traffic safety corridor imposed under AS 28.90.030 and collected and separately 
accounted for by the state under AS 37.05.142, to the division of the Department of 
Transportation and Public Facilities responsible for highway safety planning, for 
highway safety programs. (§ 1 ch 45 SLA 2006)
