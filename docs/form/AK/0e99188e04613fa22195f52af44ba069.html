Informal Probate With Will | ESIWW 

IN THE SUPERIOR COURT FOR THE STATE OF ALASKA 

AT 

 

)  CASE NO.  

 

REQUEST TO START INFORMAL PROBATE AND 
APPOINT A PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE WHEN THERE IS A WILL 
(Application for Informal Probate and Appointment of Personal Representative) 

Interest.  I,  
 

, have an interest in this estate, because: 
 

Decedent (Person Who Died).  The decedent died on  
[date] at the  
 
age of _______.  At least five full days have passed since the death.  The decedent lived 
in  
death and considered this location to be a permanent home. 

 [city and state] at the time of 

Filing Location.  This is the correct court to file in, because the decedent 

  lived in this judicial district at the time of death.  
  did not live in Alaska at the time of death, but had property located in this judicial 
district at the time of death. 

Time.  I am filing this probate case within the required time period, because   

  three years or less have passed since the person died, OR 
  more than three years have passed.  STOP.  Under Alaska law, you cannot open an 
estate case more than three years after the person died except in very limited 
circumstances.  You should talk to a lawyer about your options and whether you can 
open a probate case.  If you file this form, be aware that the court may dismiss the 
case unless you show a legal basis for filing this action under AS 13.16.040.  A 
waiver of the 3-year time limit under AS 13.16.040 is legally permitted, because: 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 

5.  Will.  The decedent made a valid will on  

 

 

 [date].  To the best of my 

knowledge after a reasonable search, this is the last will, and I do not know of any 
document that cancels or revokes this will.  The original will (or an authenticated copy of 
the will probated somewhere else)    

  is attached. 
  is in the court’s possession.

  No court has appointed a personal representative of the estate. 
  A court appointed a personal representative, but later ended the appointment. 
Attached is an authenticated copy of the will and a statement from the court where 
the will was first probated. 
  There is currently a personal representative of the estate.  A court appointed   

   

 [name] as personal representative who lives 
at  
 [address]. 
 
Attached is an authenticated copy of the will and a statement from the court where 
the will was first probated. 

Right to be Appointed as Personal Representative.  The court should appoint me 
as personal representative.  I am 19 years old or older and have priority to serve, 
because  

  the will named me as the personal representative.  
  I am the surviving spouse, and the will named me to receive property. 
  the will named me to receive property. 
  I am the surviving spouse, but the will did not name me to receive property. 
  I am an heir (someone with the right to inherit property from the decedent if no will 
had been made). 
  I am a creditor, and at least 45 days have passed since the person died. 
  Other:  

 

Persons with a Greater or Equal Right to Appointment.  [Priority is determined in 
the following order: (1) individual nominated in a will, (2) surviving spouse if named in 
w
to receive property, (3) others named in will to receive property, (4) surviving 
 
l
l
i
spouse, (5) someone with the right to inherit property from the decedent if no will was 
made, (6) 45 days after the death of the decedent, any creditor.]   
The following persons have a greater or equal right than I do to be appointed as 
personal representative: 
 
 
[IMPORTANT:  Every person who has a greater or equal priority over you must 
consent by completing the “Nomination for Appointment of Personal Representative with 
Lower Priority” (form P-306).] 
 
Bond.  [A bond is a cash payment or pledge of property that guarantees the personal 
representative will fulfill the person’s duties.  However, the will commonly waives the 
bond requirement.] 

 
 

  No bond is required, because the will waived the bond requirement. 
  No bond is required, because all persons named in the will to receive property 
waived the bond requirement.  [IMPORTANT: Each person named in the will must 
l
i
f
separate “Waiver of Bond Requirement” (form P-334) or must have requested 
 
a
 
e
a
waiver of the bond requirement in the “Nomination for Appointment of 
 
Representative with Lower Priority” (form P-306).] 
  I request the court set a bond amount of $ 
covers the estimated value of the estate’s property and income for the next year. 

_, because this amount

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
