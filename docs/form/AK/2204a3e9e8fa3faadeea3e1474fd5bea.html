need to file any claim of exemptions right away.  You also need to keep this booklet and a 
copy of all the forms you received  for  at least 45 days  in case the creditor seizes  more of 
your  property.    If  additional  property  listed  in  the  enclosed  creditor’s  affidavit  is  seized 
within 45 days, the creditor is not required to send you additional booklets or notices.

judgment.

property from you in order to pay the judgment against you.  The booklet outlines the rights you 
may  have  to  protect  your  property  from  being  taken  away  from  you  permanently.    The  word 
"property" is used in this booklet to mean anything you own.

Chapter 35 and Chapter 38 of Title 9 of the Alaska Statutes (abbreviated as AS 09.35.010 etc. 
and AS 09.38.010 etc.).  Be sure to check the supplement to see if any of the statutes have  been 
amended.    You  can  find  the  statutes  online  at  www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/folio.asp.  You  may 
also want to read Civil Rule 69 in the Alaska Rules of Court.  Civil Rule 69  is  also online at:  
https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/rules/docs/civ.pdf 

ou  may  want  to  contact  a  lawyer  for  assistance.    If  you  do  not  have  a  lawyer,  the  Lawyer

JUDGMENT DEBTOR BOOKLET 

I.   WHAT MAY HAPPEN IF YOU DO NOT PAY  
A COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST YOU 
 

A. 

YOUR PROPERTY CAN BE SEIZED BY COURT ORDER 

 

 

B. 
 

 

If  you  do  not  pay  a  court  judgment,  your  creditor  can  ask  the  court  for  a  court 
order  (called  a  "writ  of  execution")  which  allows  the  creditor  to  seize  some  of 
your property and sell it to pay your debt. 

If the court issues a WRIT OF EXECUTION against you and if your creditor uses 
the  WRIT  to  seize  (levy  upon*)  some  of  your  property,  you  will  need  to  act 
quickly  if  you  want  to  try  to  protect  your  property  from  being  taken  from  you 
permanently. 

Within three days after seizing any of your property, your creditor must send you 
a notice telling you what was seized and your right to claim that your property is 
"exempt."    "Exempt"  means  "protected  by  law  from  being  taken  permanently 
from you to pay the judgment against you."  This is explained more fully in the 
section on Exemptions, beginning on page 4. 

Exception:  The  creditor  is  not  required  to  send  you  additional  notices  or 
documents  for  a  second  or  subsequent  seizure  if  (1)  you  were  already  served 
notice once within the past 45 days, and (2) the creditor’s affidavit described the 
property that was seized by the second or subsequent seizure. 

HOW TO CLAIM AN "EXEMPTION" 

If you want to try to protect some of the property your creditor has seized or plans 
to seize, you must act quickly. 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

 

As soon as you receive the NOTICE OF LEVY* from your creditor, look 
at  the  CREDITOR'S  AFFIDAVIT  attached  to  the  NOTICE  to  see  what 
your creditor has seized or plans to seize. 

Then look at the Exemptions section of this booklet, beginning on page 4, 
to see if you may claim that any of the property is "exempt." 

If  the  property  has  already  been  seized,  fill  out  the  CLAIM  OF 
EXEMPTIONS  form  which  is  attached  to  the  NOTICE.    If  the  property 
has not yet been seized, you may want to wait to fill out the CLAIM OF 
EXEMPTIONS form until you know exactly what has been seized.  If you 
file your claim before anything has been seized, the court may not be able 
to decide your claim. 

File  this  CLAIM  OF  EXEMPTIONS  form  with  the clerk  of  court at  the 
address shown on the NOTICE  within 15 days of the date  your property 
was seized.  (Note:  You may either mail the CLAIM form to the clerk or 
deliver it in person.  However, if you mail it, it must  arrive at the clerk's 
office within 15 days from the date your property was seized.) 

Note:    If  another  seizure  of  property  listed  on  the  CREDITOR’S 
AFFIDAVIT occurs within the next 45 days, you may not receive another 
one of these notices but you will still have the right to claim exemptions.  

                                                 
* "Levy" means to seize property under the authority of a court order for the purpose of collecting 

a debt.

Go 
https://records.courts.alaska.gov/ 
Select “Search Cases” near the bottom of the page.  
If you know your case number, enter it on the Search page.  If you 
do  not  know the case  number,  select  the  “Name” tab and type  in 
your last name and first name in the spaces provided.   
Click on “Search” or hit the enter key. 
Click on the case number you wish to research. 
Click on the “Docket” tab. 
Under the Docket tab, scroll down to view any “Return of Service 
on Execution & Payment.” 

The  “Docket  Date”  to  the  left  of  “Docket  Text”  is  the  date  the  court 
received the money. 

BE  AWARE:    Even  though  the  law  says  you  are  entitled  to  an exemption,  you 
will  not  be  given  the  exemption  unless  you  claim  it.    You  must  claim  your 
exemptions or you will lose them.  YOU MUST FILE YOUR CLAIM  WITHIN 
15 DAYS after your property is seized.  

Additional  copies  of  the  claim  of  exemption  forms  and  other  court  forms  are 
available from the court clerk or online at: 
www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#civ. 
 
AFTER YOU FILE YOUR CLAIM 

C. 

After you file your CLAIM OF EXEMPTIONS with the court, the court will send 
a copy of the claim to the creditor and give the creditor 10 days to respond.  The 
court will decide your claim based on the information submitted, or the court will 
schedule a hearing. 

If a hearing is ordered, you will be notified of the date and time it will be held.  
You  must  attend  the  hearing.    At  the  hearing,  you  must  prove  your  right  to  an 
exemption.    You  should  bring  to  the  hearing  any  documents  or  other  evidence 
supporting your claim. 

If the hearing is scheduled to be held in a city other than where you live and you 
believe  it  will  be  too  inconvenient  and  expensive  for  you  to  attend  the  hearing, 
you  may  ask  the  court  to  move  the  hearing  to  another  city  more  convenient  to 
you.

THINGS TO REMEMBER 

1.  You must file your CLAIM OF EXEMPTIONS with the court within 15 days 

after your property is taken. 

2.  It is not enough to notify the creditor or the creditor's attorney of your claim, 

you must file your claim with the court. 

3.  If you do not file your claim within 15 days or if you do not attend the hearing 
(if there is one) on your claim, the court may decide you have given up your 
right to the exemptions. 

CIV-511 (11/12) 
JUDGMENT DEBTOR BOOKLET

If  you  fail  to  claim  your  exemptions,  your  spouse  or  a  dependent  or  any  other 
person authorized by law (for example, a guardian) may claim your exemptions 
for you or assert the rights provided in the exemptions law.  Note:  At the hearing 
on the claim of exemptions, the court may require that you (judgment debtor) be 
present  since  court  rules  state  that  no  one  except  you  or  your  attorney  can 
represent you in court. 

f neither you, nor your spouse, nor anyone else claims your exemptions for you, 
then the property listed on the CREDITOR'S AFFIDAVIT can be sold to pay the 
judgment against you.  Even exempt property can be sold if you have not claimed 
the exemption. 

 I

DOES IT COST ANYTHING TO DELAY PAYING THE JUDGMENT? 

Yes.  You will be charged interest from the date of the judgment until you pay it.  
(The interest rate is usually stated in the judgment.)  You will also be charged for 
the judgment creditor's costs in trying to  enforce the judgment.  For example, if 
the  creditor  has  to  get  a  WRIT  OF  EXECUTION  from  the  court  to  seize  your 
property because you did not pay the judgment voluntarily, the creditor will have 
to  pay  a  process  server  to  serve  the  WRIT  on  whoever  holds  your  property.    If 
anything is seized, the creditor will also have to have the NOTICE OF LEVY and 
other papers served on you.  These costs of service will be added to the judgment 
against you.  Also, the costs of storing the property until it is sold and the costs of 
conducting the public sale will be added to the judgment. 

You should also be aware that property  sold at this type of  public sale may not 
bring as high a price as it would if you sold it privately.

CAN SOMEONE ELSE CLAIM YOUR EXEMPTIONS FOR YOU? 

G. 

NONRESIDENT EXEMPTIONS. 

If you are not an Alaska resident, you are not entitled to the exemptions provided 
in the Alaska Exemptions Act.  Instead, you are entitled to claim the exemptions 
provided by the laws of your state of residence.  You are also, of course, entitled 
to claim the exemptions provided by federal law.  The term "resident" means an 
individual  who  is  physically  present  in  the  state  and  who  intends  to  maintain 
his/her permanent home in Alaska.  AS 09.38.120.

II. 

EXEMPTIONS 

 

n "exemption" is a right to protect your property from being taken from you to pay your debts.  
State and federal laws define the types of property for which you may claim an exemption.  It is 
very important to remember that these laws require you to ask for the exemptions before you can 
be given them.  If you do not claim the exemptions, you will lose them. 

he following are some of the main exemptions  you should know about.  The exemptions are 
listed in alphabetical order.  Along with an explanation of each exemption, there is a reference to 
the statute which creates the exemption.   

References to Alaska laws begin with the letters "AS" for "Alaska Statutes."   

References to federal laws include the letters "USC" for "United States Code" and “CFR” 
for the “Code of Federal Regulations.”   

There  are  also  some  references  to  Alaska  Administrative  Code  regulations  on 
exemptions.    These  references  include  the  letters  "AAC"  for  "Alaska  Administrative 
Code." 

f you want to read these laws, you can find them in the State Law Library in Anchorage, in the 
court libraries at some court locations, and in many city libraries.  They are also available on the 
Internet.  You can find links to them on the court system’s website:  www.courts.alaska.gov 

he  following  list  may  not  contain  all  the  possible  exemptions  that  exist.    Although  the  list 
includes all the major Alaska and federal exemptions, there may be others.  If you have questions 
about these exemptions or want to know if there are other exemptions which might help you, you 
are urged to seek the advice of a lawyer. 

Adult Public Assistance.  See #55, Welfare Benefits. 
 
Alimony. 

 

oney  or  property  received  for  alimony  or  separate  maintenance  may  be  treated  as

payments to you), see #26, Life Insurance Policies and Annuity Contracts. 

nce  you  begin  receiving  payments  from  an  annuity  contract,  the  payments  may  be

Building Materials. 

If you have furnished the material for the construction, alteration or repair of a building 
or other improvement, these furnished materials are exempt from execution except when 
the debt arises from the purchase price of these materials.  AS 34.35.105. 

Burial Plot. 

Child Support. 

A  burial  plot  for  yourself  and  your  family  is  entirely  exempt.    AS  09.38.015.    See 
definition of "burial plot" in the Glossary.  Land held by a cemetery association for use as 
a  cemetery  is  also  exempt.    AS  10.30.060  and  .120.    Note:    You  may  not  claim  this 
exemption if you are holding your cemetery lot with the intention of selling it for profit. 
AS 10.30.120. 

See  also  #50,  Tracing,  and  section  III  on  page  18  about  Claims  Enforceable  Against 
Exempt Property. 

Child support collections made by the Child Support Services Division are exempt while 
the money is held by CSSD.  AS 09.38.015.  However, when CSSD pays the money to 
the person to whom it is owed, the money is no longer exempt.  It  might, however, be 
partly or wholly protected by the income or liquid asset exemption described in #12c. 

Also, automatic payroll deductions for child support sent by a person's employer to the 
court are exempt.  AS 25.24.160(a)(1).

Clothes.  Partly exempt. See #40. 

Crime Victims Reparations. 

An award under a crime victim's reparations act (for example, a payment from the Alaska 
Violent  Crimes  Compensation  Board)  is entirely  exempt.  AS  09.38.015    See,  however, 
section III on page 18 about Claims Enforceable Against Exempt Property. 

2. 

Earnings, Wages, Salary, Benefit Payments, Other Income, Cash on Hand or in a Bank, 
etc. 

There  are  two  different  exemptions  for  this  money:  (a)  the  regular  earnings  exemption 
and  (b)  the  liquid  assets  exemption.    You  may  be  eligible  for  either  one  of  these  two 
exemptions, but not both. 

Note:  You will not be eligible for either of these exemptions if the judgment against you 
is for child support, the payment of an employee's wages (up to one month's earnings), 
state  or  local  taxes,  or  payment  to  a  victim  of  a  crime  or  delinquent  act  committed  by 
you.    AS  09.38.030(c)  and  AS  09.38.065(a)(1)  and  (a)(3).  See  sub-paragraph  e.  for  an 
explanation of this.  Also see Section III on page  18.  You will also not be eligible for 
these  exemptions  if  the  creditor's  claim  is  enforceable  under  an  order  of  a  federal 
bankruptcy  court  under  11  USC  §§  1301-1330  (Bankruptcy  Reform  Act  of  1978).    AS 
09.38.030(c)(2).

You are eligible for this exemption if you receive "earnings" either weekly, twice 
a  month  or  monthly.    "Earnings"  means  money  received  for  personal  services, 
including wages, salary, commissions, etc. 

If you receive money for personal services on a regular basis as described above, 
the following part of your earnings is exempt (protected from seizure):  $473 per 
week  or  75%  of  your  weekly  disposable  earnings,  whichever  is  more.    AS 
09.38.030(a), 8 AAC 95.030 and 15 USC § 1673.  "Disposable earnings" means 
the money left after subtracting any amounts required by law to be withheld.  15 
USC § 1672. 

Note:  This exemption may be increased to $743 per week if you give the court an 
affidavit  (a  sworn  written  statement)  stating,  under  penalty  of  perjury,  that  your 
earnings alone (and not anyone else's) support your household. AS 09.38.050(b) 
and 8 AAC 95.030.  See form CIV-531. 

Also  Note:    Federal  law  prohibits  employers  from  discharging  any  employee 
because the employee's earnings have been garnished (seized by court order) for 
any one indebtedness.  15 USC § 1674. 

You  are  eligible  for  this  exemption  if  you  do  not  receive  earnings  (money  for 
personal  services)  weekly,  twice  a  month  or  monthly.    That  means  you  are 
eligible for the liquid asset exemption: 

if  you  receive  "earnings"  (money  received  for  personal  services)  on  an 
irregular basis*, or 

if you do not receive "earnings" at all, but do receive other payments (like 
interest or dividends or government benefits).* 

If you do not receive earnings weekly, twice a month, or monthly, you are entitled 
to  an  exemption  of  $1,890  for  the total  value  of  any  cash  or  other  liquid  assets 
available  to  you  in  any  month.    AS  09.38.030(b)  and  8  AAC  95.030.    "Liquid 
assets" includes deposits, securities, notes, drafts, accrued vacation pay, refunds, 
prepayments  and  receivables,  but  does  not  include  Alaska  Permanent  Fund 
dividends. 

Note:    This  exemption  may  be  increased  to  $2,970  if  you  give  the  court  an 
affidavit stating, under penalty of perjury, that your earnings alone support your 
household.  AS 09.38.050(b) and 8 AAC 95.030.

Liquid Assets Exemption. 

a. 

Regular earnings exemption. 

 
 
* Be aware that some types of income that appear to be “earnings” may actually be something 
else.    For  example,  a  crewman  on  a  fishing  boat  may  in  some  cases  be  working  as  an 
independent contractor rather than as an employee.  If so, there would be no employer-employee 
relationship, and the money the crewman receives might not be considered “earnings.”

Items Treated as Earnings, Income or Liquid Assets. 

AS 09.38.030(e) states that the following are other items which will be treated as 
earnings,  income,  cash  or  other  liquid  assets  when  they  are  in  your  possession 
(that is, after you have received them): 

1) 

2) 

3) 

4) 

5) 

Benefits paid by reason of disability, illness or unemployment; 

Money or property received for alimony or separate maintenance; 

Proceeds of insurance, a judgment, or a settlement, or other rights accruing 
as a result of bodily injury to you or the wrongful death or bodily injury of 
another individual of whom you were or are a dependent; 

Proceeds  or  benefits  paid  or  payable  on  the  death  of  an  insured,  if  you 
were the spouse or a dependent of the insured; and 

Amounts  paid  under  a  stock  bonus,  pension,  profit  sharing,  annuity,  or 
similar  plan  or  contract,  providing  benefits  by  reason  of  age,  illness, 
disability, or length of service. 

This means these assets are only partially protected as described in paragraphs a. 
and  b.  above,  unless  they  fit  within  one  of  the  categories  described  in  AS 
09.38.015 (Property Exempt Without Limitation) or AS 09.38.017 (Exemption of 
Retirement Plan Interests and Payments). 

See #44, Retirement Benefits. 

Increased Exemption for Injury or Disability Payments. 

If you have money you obtained as payment for  an injury or disability, you may 
ask the court to increase the exemption amounts described in paragraphs a. and b. 
above.  You will have to  give the court  affidavits (sworn written statements) or 
offer  sworn  testimony  in  support  of  your  request  as  required  by  the  court.    The 
court will determine the exemption amount after considering your responsibilities 
and all your present and anticipated property and income.   AS 09.38.050(a). 

e. 

Earnings Exemption If Debt Is  For Child Support, Employee Wages or State or 
Local Taxes. 

If  the  judgment against  you  is  for  child support,  employee  wages,  state  or  local 
taxes, or payment to a victim of a crime or delinquent act committed by you, there 
is no "liquid asset" exemption.  You may, however, be able to claim an exemption 
for part of your regular earnings as described below. 

If  the  judgment  is  for  child  support,  both  state  and  federal  law  exempt  50%  of 
your "disposable earnings" if you are supporting a spouse or dependent children 
and 40% if you are not. These exemption percentages decrease to 45% and 35% 
respectively if your support payments are 12 weeks or more in arrears.  15 USC § 
1673(b), AS 25.27.062(i) and AS 25.27.250(i).

your wages:  

(1) 

(2) 
(3) 

employee  wages  (up  to  an  amount  equal  to  one  month's  full-time 
earnings),  
local taxes, or 
payment to a victim of a crime or delinquent act committed by you. 

However, federal law would still exempt 75% of your "disposable earnings" each 
week or 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage, whichever is more.  15 USC 
§ 1673. 

If  the  judgment  is  for  state  taxes  or  is  an  order  of  a  federal  bankruptcy  court, 
neither state law nor federal law provides an exemption to protect your wages. AS 
09.38.030(c) and 15 USC § 1673(b). 

For Fishermen's and Seamen's Wages, see #46. 

Earnings of Nonresidents. 

If you are not a resident of Alaska, the above exemptions are not available to you.  
Instead,  the  limitations  on  garnishment  imposed  under  15  USC  §  1673  apply 
(exempting 75% of your "disposable earnings" each week or 30 times the federal 
minimum hourly wage, whichever is more).  AS 09.38.030(d).

Money in Prisoner Accounts. 

If  you are being held in a correctional facility and have money in an account at 
that  facility,  all  the  money  in  the  account  can  be  seized  to  pay  certain  debts 
(support of dependents, child support, restitution, fines, civil judgments resulting 
from  your  criminal  conduct,  reimbursements  to  the  state  for  violent  crimes 
compensation  awards  made  because  of  your  criminal  conduct,  and  other 
judgments against you resulting from litigation against the state).   
AS 09.38.030(f) & (g)

Homestead. 

a. 

State Homestead Exemption 

You are entitled to an exemption of up to $72,900 for your equity in property in 
Alaska    used  as  your  "principal  residence."    AS  09.38.010  and  8  AAC  95.030.  
See  Glossary  for  definition  of  "principal  residence."    Note:    This  definition 
includes  mobile  homes  and  other  similar  dwellings.    If  you  have  more  than 
$72,900 equity in your home, it may be sold as described below. 

If you have an equity in excess of $72,900, your residence may be offered for sale 
by  public  auction  after  advertisement  of the  time and  place  of the  sale.    For  60 
days after such a sale, you can repurchase your home by paying the clerk of court 
the  costs  of  the  levy  and  the  sale  plus  the  lesser  of  either  (1)  the  difference 
between the highest bid and the amount of your exemption in the property, or (2) 
the amount of the creditor's claim.  If the highest bid for  your homestead at the 
execution sale is not enough to pay you the value of your exemption, the sale will 
be cancelled, and you will not be charged for the expenses of the attempted sale.  
AS 09.38.080(d). 

See  also  #50  on  Tracing,  and  section  III  on  page  18  about  Claims  Enforceable 
Against Exempt Property. 

b. 

Federal Homesteads. 

The  federal  homestead  exemption  is  quite  different.    It  applies  to  land  being 
homesteaded  under  the  federal  homestead  laws.    Federal  law  states  that  land 
acquired  under  the  federal  homestead  laws  is  exempt  from  execution  to  satisfy 
any debt which came into existence prior to the issuance of the patent for the land 
("title" to the land from the federal government).  43 USC § 175.  Therefore, if the 
judgment against you is for a debt which was created after you received the patent 
to your federal homestead, this exemption is not available to you. 

Note that although the federal homestead laws were repealed in 1976 (effective in 
1986 in Alaska), the protections for existing homesteads will continue to exist.

As  stated  in  #31,  benefits  paid  or  payable  for  medical,  surgical  or  hospital  care  to  the 
extent they are or will be used to pay for the care are completely exempt.  AS 09.38.015.  
See, however, section III on page 18 about Claims Enforceable Against Exempt Property. 

However, if you receive insurance proceeds as a result of bodily injury to yourself or as a 
result of the wrongful death or bodily injury of someone of whom you are a dependent 
and the proceeds do not fit within the medical benefits exemption, then upon your receipt 
of these proceeds, they become "liquid assets" as described in #12c.  This money will be 
combined with all your other "liquid assets," and $1,890 per month out of that total will 
be exempt (if you are not receiving regular "earnings" and are otherwise eligible for the 
liquid assets exemption). See #12 and AS 09.38.030(e)(3). 

f you receive proceeds from a life insurance policy, the proceeds are also "liquid assets." 
AS 09.38.030(e)(4).  See the description of the liquid assets exemption in #12c. 

e  aware  that  if  you  have  money  which  you  received  as  payment  for  an  injury  or 
disability, you may ask the court to order an increase in the liquid assets exemption.  You 
can do so by explaining this to the court on your CLAIM OF EXEMPTIONS form.  The 
court will require an affidavit (a sworn written statement) from you or will require you to 
appear and testify in court about this.  AS 09.38.050(a).

Life Insurance Policies and Annuity Contracts. 

Unmatured  life  insurance  and  annuity  contracts  (in  other  word,  those  that  have  not  yet 
begun making payments) owned by you are exempt except for any accrued dividends and 
loan values exceeding $500,500.† 

If  the  contracts  have  accrued  dividends  and  loan  values  available  to  you  totaling  more 
than $500,500, a creditor may obtain a court order requiring you to pay the creditor and 
authorizing the creditor on your behalf to obtain payment of either (a) the  amount of the 
accrued  dividends  and  loan  values  in  excess  of  $500,500  or  (b)  the  amount  of  the 
creditor's claim, whichever is less.  AS 09.38.025 and 8 AAC 95.030.

loan values available to the individual.  (This was increased from $10,000 in 2010 in House Bill 101, 
Chapter 97 SLA 10.)  Under AS 09.38.115, the exemption amount increased from $500,000 to $500,500 as 
of October 1, 2012.  The increased exemption amount for life insurance and annuity contracts currently 
listed in 8 AAC 95.030(c) as $13,500 is an error in the regulation which is in the process of being 
corrected.  Refer to the forthcoming revised regulation at 8 AAC 95-030(c) for the corrected increased 
exemption amount.

The  stock  of  Native  Regional  Corporations  and  Native  Village  Corporations  created 
under  the  Alaska  Native  Claims  Settlement  Act  (ANCSA)  is  exempt  from  execution.  
Also,  dividends  and  other  distributions  paid  on  this  stock  are  exempt.    43  USC  § 
1606(h)(1)(B) and 1607(c).  Note, however, that these federal laws limiting the transfer 
of this stock do not apply to transfers of stock pursuant to a court decree of separation, 
divorce or child support.  Also note that a Native Corporation may amend its articles of 
incorporation  to  allow  execution  on  its  stock  (that  is,  to  "terminate  the  alienability 
restrictions" set out in ANCSA) effective after December 18, 1991.  Public Law 100-241, 
section 8. 
 
Partnership Property. 

artnerships are not entitled to exemptions because exemptions belong only to individual 
persons.    However,  if  the  debtor  is  an  individual  person  who  also  happens  to  have  an 
interest in a partnership, the partnership property is exempt from execution to collect the 
debts of that individual debtor (which are not partnership debts). AS 09.38.100(b). 

he income to the individual from the partnership is  not exempt under the "partnership 
property exemption," but it may be exempt under the income or liquid asset exemption.  
See #12c.  For further information about partnerships, see Title 32 of the Alaska Statutes.

Permanent Fund Dividend. 

Twenty  percent  of  the  annual  permanent  fund  dividend  payable  to  an  individual  is

This exemption is not available if the debt is for child support, court ordered restitution, a 
scholarship loan from the state, a court ordered fine, a debt owed to an agency of the state 
or the other types of obligations listed in AS 43.23.065(b).  Also see Section III on page

musical instruments, family portraits and heirlooms. 

Up to $1,350 worth of jewelry. 

Up to $3,780 worth of professional books and tools of your trade. 

Up to $1,350 for pets. 

Up to $4,050 for one motor vehicle if the full value of the motor vehicle does not 
exceed $27,000.

are  served  with  a  notice  of  your  exemption  rights  and  given  a  chance  to  claim  your 
exemptions.  AS 09.38.075. 

WARNING:  You may not claim an exemption for any of the items in this section if the 
judgment against you is 

for the purchase price of that item, or 

for a loan made to enable you to purchase the item (and used for that purpose), or 

for  labor  or  materials  furnished  to  make,  repair,  improve,  preserve,  store,  or 
transport the item.  AS 09.38.065(a)(2). 

For example, if the debt you owe is for the purchase price of a car, you cannot claim an 
exemption for that car. 

NOTE:    These  exemptions  are  not  available  if  the  judgment  against  you  is  for  child 
support,  the  payment  of  an  employee's  wages  (up  to  one  month's  earnings)  or  state  or 
local taxes.  AS 09.38.065(a)(1).  Also, some of the exemptions are not available if the 
judgment is for payment to a victim of a crime or delinquent act which you committed.

in  AS  09.30.040  to  collect  the  amount  due.    A  "public  corporation"  is  a  corporation 
organized for governmental purposes.  See also AS 09.38.015(c). 

Retirement Benefits. 

a. 

State Law. 

Pension  or  retirement  plan  payments  become  part  of  your  income  or  "liquid 
assets" when you receive them.  AS 09.38.030(e)(5).  See #12c.  

However, your interest in a retirement plan and the amounts held on your behalf 
in such a plan are exempt while held in the plan.  AS 09.38.017.  (Also see AS 
09.38.015(b),  AS  39.35.505,  14.25.200,  and  AS  22.25.100  about  the  Alaska 
Public  Employee's  Retirement  System,  Alaska  Teacher's  Retirement  System, 
Judicial Retirement System and Elected Public Officers' Retirement System and 
AS 39.30.162(b) about the State of Alaska Supplemental Annuity Plan.)  Once the 
benefits  are  paid  to  you,  however,  they  become  income  or  "liquid  assets"  as 
described above, and thus may be only partially exempt.

Federal Law. 

There are federal laws protecting many (if not all) retirement, pension and annuity

laws: 

5 USC § 8346.  

Civil Service Retirement money is exempt. 

5 USC § 8470(a) 

Federal Employees’ Retirement System money is exempt. 

45 USC § 231m. 

An annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act is exempt. 

38 USC § 1562(c).  The  special  pensions  given  to  persons  who  have  been 

awarded the Medal of Honor are exempt. 

33 USC § 775. 

Benefit  payments  for  widows  of  Lighthouse  Service 
employees are exempt. 

50 USC § 2094. 

Payments  from  the  Central Intelligence  Agency 
Retirement  and  Disability  Fund  are  exempt  except  when 
there is a legally enforceable spousal agreement or a court 
decree  of  divorce,  annulment,  separation,  etc.  which 
provides otherwise.   

See also: 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

#32, Military Annuity 
#14, Federal Judicial Survivors Annuity 
#53, Veterans' Benefits 

There are also regulations that protect certain federal benefits from garnishment.  
See Section IV on page 19 for more information. 

Note:    These  exemptions  are  probably  not  available  where  the  debt  is  for  child 
support or alimony.  42 USC § 659. 

Also Note:  There are court cases interpreting some of these laws which state that 
money is exempt (that is, protected by the federal exemption) only while it is held 
by the federal government and not after it has been received by the person entitled 
to it.  However, even if the federal exemption is no longer available, the money 
may be eligible for the income or liquid asset exemption.  See #12c.

Seamen's and Fishermen's Wages. 

46. 
 

Wages  "due  or  accruing"  to  any  master  or  seaman  or  to  an  individual  employed  on  a 
fishing  vessel  or  fish  processing  vessel  are  exempt, except  in  the  following  case.   This 
exemption does not protect such a person's wages from a court order requiring payment 
of the wages for  the support and maintenance of the person's spouse or minor  children.  
46 USC § 11109. 

Note:  This exemption apparently protects the wages only while they are in the hands of 
the employer and not after they have been received by the seaman or fisherman.  See also 
#12. 

enefits  paid  or  payable  under  the  Alaska  Senior  Benefits  Payment  Program  (AS 

47.45.301 - .309) are exempt.  AS 09.38.015 

ote:  This program and the exemption are scheduled to be repealed June 30, 2011.  (§ 4 

Senior Benefits.

ch. 1 FSSLA 2007) 

8. 

Social Security. 

Money "paid or payable" under the federal Social Security system (the Federal Old Age, 
Survivors, and Disability Insurance Benefits program) is exempt.  42 USC § 407.  

here  are  regulations  that  protect  these  and  other  federal  benefits  from  garnishment.   

See Section IV on page 19 for more information. 

Exception:  This exemption probably is not available where the debt is for child support 
or alimony.  42 USC § 659.   

Note:    Decisions  from  different courts  in  cases  involving  the  social  security  exemption 
disagree on whether the money is protected only while held by the federal government or 
also after it has been received by the person entitled to it.  However, even if the federal 
exemption  is  no  longer  available,  the  money  may  be  eligible  for  the  income  or  liquid 
asset exemption.  See #12c. 

Tools of Trade.  Partly exempt.  See #40. 

Tracing.  Property  Traceable  to  Other  Exempt  Property.    AS  09.38.060  and  8  AAC 
95.030. 

If any of the following exempt property has been taken or sold by condemnation or has 
been lost or damaged or destroyed and you have been indemnified (paid) for it, you are 
entitled to an exemption for proceeds that are traceable for 12 months after you receive 
the proceeds: 

Up  to  $72,900  for  a  residence  which  could  have  been  claimed  as  an  exempt 
homestead (described in #19 above).

Up to $4,050 for household goods, clothes, books and musical instruments. 

Up to $3,780 for implements, professional books and tools of your trade. 

If  you  voluntarily  sell  your  exempt  homestead  (your  residence),  you  can  claim  an 
exemption for up to $72,900 of the proceeds for six months after you receive them if the 
money can be traced back to the sale. 

AS 09.38.060(b) describes methods you can use to show that money you are seeking to 
protect under this section can be traced back to the proceeds of exempt property. 

1. 

Tuition Credit or Savings Accounts. 

Tuition credit or savings accounts under a higher education savings account established 
under AS 14.40.802 or an advance college tuition savings contract authorized under AS 
14.40.809(a) are exempt.  AS 09.38.015.  Also, see AS 14.40.802(h). 

2. 

Unemployment Benefits. 

3. 

Veterans' Benefits. 

While  these  benefits  are  held  by  the  state,  they  are  exempt.    AS  09.38.015(b). 
However, upon your receipt of these benefits, they become income or "liquid assets" as 
described in #12c.  AS 23.20.405(e) and AS 09.38.030(e)(1). 

Payments  of  benefits  due  under  any  law  administered  by  the  federal  Veterans' 
Administration are exempt. 38 USC § 5301. 

There  are  regulations  that  protect  these  and  other  federal  benefits  from  garnishment.   
See Section IV on page 19 for more information. 

ourt decisions in cases involving this exemption disagree about how long the exemption 
lasts  after  the  money  is  paid  to  the  beneficiary  (for  example,  whether  the  exemption 
continues if the money is deposited in a checking or savings account).  The courts seem 
to agree, however, that the exemption is lost if the money is invested in property or other 
investments. 

Note:    This  exemption  is  probably  not  available  where  the  debt  is  for  child  support  or 
alimony.  42 USC § 659. 

4.  Wages.  See #12. 

5.  Welfare Benefits. 

The following benefits from the State of Alaska may be partly or entirely exempt: 

General Relief Assistance.  AS 47.25.210. 

Alaska Temporary Assistance Program.  AS 47.27.045. 

Adult  Public  Assistance  (assistance  to  aged,  blind  or  disabled  needy  residents).  
AS 47.25.550.

Upon your receipt of these payments, they become income or "liquid assets" as described 
in #12c.  AS 09.38.030(e)(1).   

6.  Workers' Compensation Benefits. 

If  you receive payments under the Alaska Workers' Compensation Act, then upon  your 
receipt  of  these  payments,  they  become  "liquid  assets"  as  described  in  #12c.    AS 
23.30.160 and AS 09.38.030(e)(1) and (3). 

Be  aware  that  if  you  have  money  which  you  received  as  payment  for  an  injury  or 
disability, you may ask the court to order an increase in this exemption.  You can do so 
by explaining this to the court on your CLAIM OF EXEMPTIONS form.  The court will 
require an  affidavit  (a  sworn  written  statement)  from  you  or  require  you  to  appear  and 
testify in court about this.  AS 09.38.050(a).  Also, see #31 about Medical Benefits.

III.    CLAIMS ENFORCEABLE AGAINST EXEMPT PROPERTY 

laska  Statute  09.38.065(a)(1)  states  that,  notwithstanding  other  provisions  of  AS  09.38,  a 

creditor may make a levy against exempt property of any kind to enforce a claim for: 

child support, or 

state or local taxes. 

unpaid earnings of up to one month's compensation or the full-time equivalent of 
one month's compensation for personal services of an employee, or 

n the case of  Anderson  v.  Anderson, 736 P.2d 320 (Alaska 1987), the Alaska Supreme Court 
interpreted this statute to mean that a parent could execute against an otherwise exempt limited 
entry permit to collect past due child support. 

laska Statute 09.38.065(a)(3) states that a creditor may make a levy against exempt property of 
any  kind  to  enforce  the  claim  of  a  victim  (including  a  judgment  of  restitution  on  behalf  of  a 
victim of a crime or a delinquent act) if the claim arises from conduct of the debtor that results in 
a conviction of a crime or an adjudication of delinquency, except that the debtor is entitled to an 
exemption in property 

a) 

not  to  exceed  an  aggregate  value  of  $3,000  chosen  by  the  debtor  from  the  following 
categories of property: 

household goods and wearing apparel reasonably necessary for one household; 

books  and  musical  instruments,  if  reasonably  held  for  the  personal  use  of  the 
debtor or a dependent of the debtor; and 

family portraits and heirlooms of particular sentimental value to the debtor; and 

b) 

not  to  exceed  an  aggregate  value  of  $2,800  of  the  debtor's  implements,  professional 
books, and tools of the trade. 

ote that a victim may enforce such a claim against exempt property only if the victim's claim 
arises  from  a  crime  committed  on  or  after  September  15,  1991.    (sec.  24  ch  57  SLA  1991).  
"Victim"  has  the  meaning  given  in  AS  12.55.185.  “Judgment  of  restitution”  is  defined  in  AS 
09.38.500(8). 

ote  Re  Limited  Entry  Permits.    The  AS  09.38.065  authorization  to  execute  against  “exempt 
property of any kind” does not apply to commercial fishing privileges granted under AS 16.43, 
including limited entry permits.  AS 16.43.945

IV.    FEDERAL REGULATIONS FOR PROTECTING ACCOUNTS  
WITH FEDERAL BENEFIT PAYMENTS
