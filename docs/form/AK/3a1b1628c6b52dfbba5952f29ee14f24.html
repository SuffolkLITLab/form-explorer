VIII. CHILD SUPPORT (Civil Rule 90.3)

[Note: You cannot waive child support or agree to a different amount than what is calculated
under Civil Rule 90.3, unless one of the exceptions in Civil Rule 90.3(c) applies.  For example,
the obligor’s adjusted annual income is more than $126,000; or the obligor’s annual income is
so low that the amount of support would be less than $600; or you can prove to the court that
manifest injustice will result unless the support amount is varied.]

4. Children's Health Care Coverage.

a. Health Insurance. If the children are covered by an insurance company other than
the Indian Health Service or Tricare, you should also fill out court form DR-330,
Notice to Employer Re: Children’s Medical Insurance. 

(1) Does Party A have health insurance available for the child(ren) at reasonable

cost through Party A’s employer, union, or otherwise? 

 Yes 

 No 

(2) Does Party B have health insurance available for the child(ren) at reasonable 

cost through Party B’s employer, union, or otherwise?  

 Yes 

 No 

(3) Are the children eligible for services through the Indian Health Service? 

  Yes 

 No 

Describe: 

(4) Do the children have other health insurance or care available? 

 Yes   

 No 

If the answer to (3) and (4) is no, one of the parents must agree to provide 
insurance for the child(ren) if such insurance is available at a reasonable cost.  
The cost of the children’s insurance must be divided equally by the parents unless 
the court orders a different division for good cause. 

AGREEMENT: Health insurance for the child(ren) will be purchased by: 

  Party A at a monthly cost to Party A of $ 
  Party B at a monthly cost to Party B of $ 
through the above person’s 
whose name and address are 

  employer 

* 
* 

  union 

The cost of health insurance for the child(ren) will be divided between the parties 

 equally 

  

  Explain reason for unequal division: 

[*List only the cost to insure the children involved in this case.  If there is no extra 
cost to the parent to include the children in the parent’s insurance coverage, you 
cannot deduct any cost for the children’s health insurance.  The parent must submit 
documentation from the health insurance provider (employer, union, etc.) showing 
separately the cost of health insurance for the parent and the parent’s dependents. 
See Civil Rule 90.3(d) for further explanation.  For more information, see Calculating 
Cost of Child(ren)’s Health Insurance chart on the court’s website.] 

b. Children's Health Care Expenses Not Covered by Insurance (including medical,

dental, vision and mental health counseling expenses).

We agree that the children’s reasonable health care expenses not covered by
insurance will be paid as follows (unless they are over $5,000 in a calendar year):

  Party A will pay half and Party B will pay half. 
  Party A will pay 
Explain reason for not sharing these uncovered expenses equally: 

 and Party B will pay 

. 

If the uncovered expenses are over $5,000 in a calendar year, the parties will pay 
based on their relative financial circumstances when the expense occurs.

AS 25.24.200-.260 
Civil Rule 90.1(a), f(2)(A)-(B), (i)(1)

We agree that each of us will reimburse the other for our share of uncovered health 
care expenses within 30 days after we are given the bill, proof of payment and, if 
applicable, a health insurance statement (EOB) showing what part of the cost is 
uncovered. We understand that the bills and other materials must be sent to the 
other parent for reimbursement within a reasonable time. 

5. Monthly Child Support Payment (including adjustment for children's health insurance).

a. Monthly Child Support Payment from paragraph 3 above

(on page 11)

If obligor is buying health insurance for the child(ren), subtract
50% (or  
(The “obligor” is the parent paying child support.)

%) of the monthly insurance payment.

If obligee is buying health insurance for the child(ren), add
50% (or  
(The “obligee” is the parent receiving child support.)

%) of the monthly insurance payment.

d. Net Monthly Child Support Payment

$ 

– $

+ $ 

$ 

6. We calculated the Net Monthly Child Support Payment in paragraph 5.d. according to:

The formula in Civil Rule 90.3(a) or (b).
Civil Rule 90.3(c)(2). Obligor’s adjusted annual income is more than $126,000.
Civil  Rule  90.3(c)(3).  Obligor’s  amount  of  support  is  less  than  $600  per  year.
Obligor’s income is low because obligor is:

  incarcerated 
  unable to work because

7. Seasonal Income.

  Obligor’s income is seasonal and obligee agrees that, as long as 

the total annual amount remains the same, obligor can make higher payments during
high income months and lower payments during low income months as follows:
Higher Monthly Amount $

 should be paid in (list months) 

Lower Monthly Amount $ 

 should be paid in (list months) 

8. Travel Expenses. Travel expenses necessary for visitation will be paid as follows:

a. The custodian of any Native Corporation dividends paid on behalf of the child(ren)

b. Except as provided below, the funds will be saved in an account for the child(ren).

Both parents will have access to all statements from the account annually.

c. Any taxes owing on any Native Corporation dividends paid on behalf of the child(ren)

will be timely paid by (name)

d. Any Native Corporation dividends paid on behalf of the children:

  May be spent for the child(ren)’s health, education, and welfare. 
  May be spent only if both parents provide prior written approval. 
  Other:  

10. Extended Visitation Credit.

  This credit does not apply to us. 
  This credit applies to us because one of us will have primary physical custody and 
the other (the obligor parent) will have extended visits with the children for periods 
longer than 27 consecutive days.  If and when the obligor parent actually exercises 
the extended visitation, child support will be reduced for these periods as follows: 

[Note:  This credit may not be more than 75% of the amount owed for the period.] 

B. 

 We agree that child support will continue while each child is 18 years old as long as the 
child is (1) unmarried, (2) actively pursuing a high school diploma or equivalent level of 
technical or vocational training, and (3) living as a dependent with the obligee parent or 
guardian or a designee of the parent or guardian.

 We object to continuing child 

C.  Do you want the assistance of the Child Support Services Division (CSSD) to 

enforce the support order and keep records of the payments?    
  No 
If yes, fill out the attached application for CSSD services. [Note: If the parent with custody 
of the children is receiving assistance from the Alaska Temporary Assistance Program 
(ATAP), child support payments must be made to CSSD.] 

  Yes    

D.  Immediate Income Withholding 

Child support will be withheld from the income of the person paying support and paid 
through the Child Support Services Division (CSSD) unless one of the following exceptions is 
approved by the court: 

  We made the following alternative arrangement [Note that if you receive ATAP, CSSD 
must agree to the arrangement]: 

Also, the person paying support agrees to keep the other party (or CSSD if CSSD is 
enforcing the order) informed of his/her current employer and the availability of 
employment-related health insurance coverage for the child(ren) until the support order 
is satisfied.

PETITION  FOR  DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE  (WITH CHILDREN)

AS 25.24.200-.260 
Civil Rule 90.1(a), f(2)(A)-(B), (i)(1)

  We believe there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding because it 
is not in the best interests of the child(ren) for the following reason: 

 
Also,  the  person  paying  support  agrees  to  keep  the  other  party  (or  CSSD  if  CSSD  is 
enforcing  the  order)  informed  of  his/her  current  employer  and  the  availability  of 
employment-related health insurance coverage for the child(ren) until the support order 
is satisfied. 

  The  person  paying  support  currently  receives  social  security  or  other  disability 
compensation that includes regular payments to the child(ren) at least equal to the child 
support owed each month. Monthly payment to child(ren): $ 
. Source of the 
payment:  
.  [Note:  To  the  extent  that  these 
payments to the children do not satisfy the monthly amount owed, the court will order 
that the remaining amount due be withheld from income.] 

E.  Federal Taxes

1. Federal Tax Credit.  We agree as follows:

 will claim the child(ren) every year. 

Every year, Party A will claim the following child(ren) 
and Party B will claim the following child(ren) 
The parents will claim the child(ren) in alternating years with      Party A       Party B 
claiming the child(ren) for odd-numbered tax years such as 2019 and 2021, and the 
other parent claiming them for even-numbered tax years such as 2020 and 2022. 

  Other: 

The parties also agree to provide each other with a signed IRS Form 8332, if needed, by 
February 1 so that it may be timely filed with the IRS. 

This  agreement  regarding  tax  benefits  may  be  modified  without  a  court  order  if  both 
parties  agree  in  writing.    As  required  by  AS  25.24.232,  we  also  agree  that  the  parent 
who has physical custody of the child(ren) for a period less than the other parent may 
not claim the tax benefits in any tax year if on December 31 of that year the parent was 
behind in child support payments in an amount more than four times the monthly child 
support obligation. 

2. Federal Tax Considerations. We understand that physical custody of a child may impact
whether we can claim tax benefits such as the Earned Income Credit, Head of Household
filing status, and Credit for Dependent (Child) Care Expenses.

F.  Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) 

1. We agree that

behalf of the child(ren) while they are minors.
for tax purposes also agrees to timely pay the taxes on the children’s PFD.

 will timely apply for the Alaska PFD on 
 The parent who claims the child(ren) 

2. Except as provided below, the child(ren)’s PFD funds will be saved in an account for the
child(ren).  Both parents will have access to all statements from the account annually.
