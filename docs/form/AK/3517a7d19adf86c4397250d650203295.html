INTRODUCTION 

xecution procedures are complicated.  This booklet is a basic explanation of the 
steps  generally  involved.    It  is  not,  however,  a  complete  statement  of  everything 
there  is  to  know  about  how  to  collect  the  amount  you  are  owed  after  you  win  a 
judgment in a court case. 

or  more  information,  you  may  want  to  read  the  Alaska  Statutes  on  execution 
procedure:    Chapter  35  and  Chapter  38  of  Title  9  of  the  Alaska  Statutes 
(abbreviated  as  AS  09.35.010 etc.  and  AS  09.38.010  etc.).   Be  sure  to  check  the 
supplement to see if any of the statutes have been amended.  You may also want to 
read Civil Rule 69 in the Alaska Rules of Court. 

ou  can  find  the  statutes  and  court  rules  in  the  State  Law  Library  at  the 
Anchorage  court,  in  the  court  libraries  at  several  other  court  locations,  and  in 
many city libraries.  They are also available on the Internet.  You can find links to 
them on the court system’s website at  www.courts.alaska.gov   

or  more  information  about  the  debtor's  rights,  you  should  read  the  JUDGMENT 
DEBTOR  BOOKLET  (CIV-511),  available  at  all  state  courthouses  and  on  the  court 
system’s website. 

ou may want to contact a lawyer for assistance.  If you do not have a lawyer, the 
Lawyer  Referral  Service  of  the  Alaska  Bar  Association  may  be  able  to  help  you 
find  a  lawyer.    Call  272-0352  in  Anchorage  or  800-770-9999  if  you  are  outside 
Anchorage (toll free within Alaska). 

here  may  be  some  words  used  in  this  booklet  which  are  unfamiliar  to  you  or 
which  have  special  meanings  when  used  in  this  type  of  legal  procedure.    The 
Glossary, which begins on page 41, may be helpful to you. 

ote:  This booklet describes the procedures to be used by general creditors (that 
is,  creditors  who  do  not  have  security  interests  in  their  debtors'  property).  
Creditors who have a security interest in particular property owned by the debtor 
may have to follow special procedures in executing upon that property if they wish 
to  assert  their  rights  under  the  security  interest.    See  AS  09.38.070.    Also  see 
footnote 31.

 BRIEF OUTLINE OF EXECUTION PROCEDURE 

 

f  you  won  a  judgment  and  the  debtor  failed  to  pay  what  the  debtor  owes  you 
under  that  judgment,  you  may  use  execution  procedures  to  try  to  collect  your 
judgment. 

riefly, the most common type of execution procedure works like this: 

You (the judgment creditor) ask the court for a Writ of Execution. 

The  court  issues  the  Writ  of  Execution  and  gives  it  to  a  process  server 
picked by  you from an approved list.  You will have to pay the court to 
issue the writ and the process server to serve the writ. 

The process server takes the Writ of Execution and uses it to seize some of 
the  debtor's  property  (for  example, money  in  the  debtor's  bank  account).  
Note:    You  have  to  tell  the  process  server  where  to  find  the  debtor's 
property. 

The property is placed in storage at your expense by the process server, or 
if it is money, it is delivered to the court for safekeeping. 

Various papers must be served on the debtor to notify the debtor that the 
property has been seized and that the debtor may have rights which will 
allow  the  debtor  to  get  the  property  back.    These  rights  are  called  the 
debtor's  "exemptions."    These  papers  can  be  served  on  the  debtor  by  a 
process server or sent to the debtor by certified mail. 

The debtor has a certain amount of time within which to contact the court 
to claim exemptions.  If the debtor does so,  you will have an opportunity 
to oppose it.  Then, the court will decide whether to grant the exemptions.  
If the debtor does not claim any exemptions, the property may be sold at 
public auction in order to pay you. 

s you will see in the following pages, execution procedures are frequently more 
complicated  than  this.    Also,  depending  on  the  property  you  want  to  seize,  the 
steps may be somewhat different.  The above outline should, however, give you a 
general idea of the steps involved.

II. EXECUTION  PROCEDURE 

Preliminary Matters 

  court  case  ends  with  the  judge's  decision  as  to  who  won.    The  judge's  decision  will 

always be in writing.  It is called the "judgment." 

f  you  win  a  judgment  which  says  someone  owes  you  money,  you  are  called  the 
"judgment  creditor."    The  person  who  owes  the  money  to  you  is  called  the  "judgment 
debtor."    These  terms  will  be  used  throughout  this  booklet,  so  you  should  get  used  to 
them. 

hen  you  win  your  judgment,  you  should  ask  the  judgment  debtor  to  pay  you.    The 
debtor may be willing to pay you but may need some time.  If you want to, you can ask 
the  debtor  if  he  or  she  would  be  willing  to  sign  an  agreement  to  make  installment 
payments to pay off the judgment.  The Court System provides a form for this in small 
claims cases called the Stipulation For Installment Payments (form  SC-18).1   Both you 
and the debtor must sign it and then it must be approved by the judge.   As long as the 
debtor  makes  the  payments,  you  will  not  be  allowed  to  use  execution  procedures  to 
collect the money owed to you.  If the debtor fails to make the payments, you can begin 
execution procedures.2 

ometimes  you  cannot  begin  execution  procedures  after  winning  your  judgment.    For 
example, the debtor may get a "stay of execution" from the court by filing an appeal of 
the judgment and posting a supersedeas bond.  Note that the debtor's filing of an appeal 
will  not  by  itself  prevent  you  from  starting  execution  procedures.    In  order  to  stop 
execution procedures, the debtor must not only file the appeal, the debtor must also ask 
the court for a "stay of execution" of the judgment.  Before ordering this "stay," the court 
will require the debtor to give the court a bond (called a "supersedeas bond") or make a 
cash deposit to assure that the judgment and all costs will be paid if the debtor loses the 
appeal.    If  no  bond  or  cash  is  posted  and  no  "stay"  is  ordered,  you  can  proceed  with 
execution procedures. 

nother  event  which  may  prevent  you  from  beginning  execution  procedures  is  the 
debtor's filing of bankruptcy in federal court.  Note that there may be other circumstances 
which might prevent or delay you from beginning execution procedures in your particular 
case. 

f it looks like the debtor is not going to pay you voluntarily and no "stay of execution" 
has occurred, you can begin execution procedures.

statement) that the debtor has not complied with your installment payments agreement.

To Begin Execution Procedures 

.  Go  to  the  clerk's  office.    Tell  the  clerk  you  have  a  judgment  and  want  a  WRIT  OF 

EXECUTION.  A writ fee will be charged for each writ issued.3 

There  is  usually  a  brief  waiting  period  after  the  judgment  is  distributed  before  a 
WRIT OF EXECUTION can be issued.  You will need to tell the clerk your case number 
so the clerk can check the file to see when  your judgment was  distributed.  (This 
date is shown at the bottom of the judgment in the clerk's certificate of distribution.)  
The clerk can tell you if the required time period has passed. 

If  the  required  time  period  has  passed,  the  clerk  will  then  ask  you  which  of  the 
following four categories of property you are going to attempt to execute on: 

debtor's earnings 

debtor's property (money, some personal property, and real estate) 

the type of debtor's personal property which is called by the statutes "personal 
property  subject  to  value  limitations"  (household  goods,  clothes,  books, 
family  portraits  and  heirlooms  of  particular  sentimental  value  to  the  debtor, 
jewelry, professional books, tools of trade, pets, and one motor vehicle) 

debtor's Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend.  [Reminder: See booklet CIV-503 
for instructions about how to execute on the PFD.  There are no instructions in 
this booklet about PFD executions.] 

The  clerk  needs  to  know  this  in  order  to  know  which  set  of  forms  to  give  you.  
There are different procedures for seizing each of these categories of property. 

hile  deciding  what  property  to  seize,  you  should  keep  in  mind  that  the  process 
servers in your area may not be willing to seize some types of property because they 
do not have safe storage areas available where the property can be protected until it 
is sold at public auction.  You may want to inquire about this before deciding what 
property you want to try to execute upon.  You should also ask the process server 
about  the  fees  for  storing  and  selling  the  property  if  anything  other  than  cash  is 
seized.  Also, check the JUDGMENT DEBTOR BOOKLET to see if the debtor may claim 
an exemption for the property you are thinking of seizing.

he first three sections which follow, Sections A, B and C, describe the procedures for 
executing  upon  the  first  three  categories  of  property  listed  above.    These  are  the 
procedures you must follow if your judgment is for an amount of money.  Section D on 
page 23 explains a fourth kind of procedure, the procedure to follow if your judgment is 
for a specific item of personal property rather than for an amount of money.

A.  

EXECUTING ON DEBTOR'S EARNINGS 

f  you want to seize the debtor's earnings4 while they are still in the possession of the debtor's 
employer,  use  the  procedure  described  in  this  section.    If,  however,  the  debtor  has  already 
received the earnings and you want to seize the cash in the debtor's possession or in the debtor's 
bank account, use the procedure described in Section B, beginning on page 10. 

ote:  Some  types  of  income  that  appear  to  be  earnings  may  actually  be  something  else.    For 
example,  a  crewman  on a  fishing  boat  may  in  some  cases  be an  independent  contractor  rather 
than an employee.  If so, there would be no employer-employee relationship, and the money the 
crewman  receives  might  not  be  considered  "earnings."4    If  the  money  is  not  "earnings,"  the 
procedure described in Section B should be used. 

ote About Federal Employees.   There are special procedures for  seizing the wages of federal 
government employees.5  The execution paperwork must be served on the “garnishment agent” 
for the federal agency and additional identifying information about the debtor must be provided.6

employer,  you  should  give  the  Debtor's  Packet  to  the  process  server  (with  that 
instruction) before you file the Writ Request Packet with the court.

ask  the  employer  to  call  the  clerk  of  court.    If  the  employer  simply  refuses  to  fill  out  the 
RESPONSE  or  return  it  to  the  court,  you  can  ask  the  court  for  an  ORDER  TO  SHOW  CAUSE 
requiring  the  employer  to  come  to  court  and  explain  the  refusal  to  a  judge.    The  Court 
System  provides  a  form  for  making  this  request  in  small  claims  cases  called  the  REQUEST 
AND ORDER form (SC-26).10 

tep 8: Prepare and Serve Debtor's Packet 

You must serve the Debtor’s Packet on the debtor either before or within three days after the 
debtor's wages are seized.11  You may want to serve the Debtor’s Packet on the debtor at the 
same time the WRIT is being served on the employer, or you may want to wait until after the 
employer responds.   

Fill out the following forms: 

a.  CIV-530, NOTICE OF GARNISHMENT AND NOTICE OF RIGHT TO EXEMPTIONS 

Fill out the entire form (including the court's mailing address on page 2).   

b.  CIV-531, CLAIM OF EXEMPTION FROM GARNISHMENT 

You must use the multi-part form available at the court.  Fill out only the top of 
the form (including the case number). 

Serve the Debtor's Packet on the Debtor. 

The Debtor's Packet may be  served either by a process  server or by certified mail.  
The two types of service are explained on pages  24-28.  Select one and follow the 
instructions.   The  packet must  be  served  on  the  debtor  before  or  within  three  days 
after the debtor’s wages are seized. 
 

Step 9  Proof of Service of the Debtor's Packet 

roof that the Debtor's Packet was served on the debtor must be filed with the court before 
the court will release to you any money collected under the  WRIT.  The proof must be filed 
within 30 days after the court receives money from the employer for the first time.  If proof 
is not filed within 30 days, the court may return the money to the debtor and terminate the 
WRIT.12    If  you  cannot  file  proof  of  service  within  30  days,  you  can  ask  the  court  for 
additional time to file the proof.13

If the Debtor's Packet is served by a process server, the process server will file proof of 
service  with  the  court.    If  you  have  any  questions,  you  should  contact  the  process 
server.   

If the Debtor's Packet is served by certified mail, the green postal receipt card will be 
returned to you.  You must file it with the court along with an affidavit of service (see 
form CIV-620). 

f the envelope sent to the debtor is returned to you, see paragraph "e" (Debtor's Packet 
Not Served) on page 26 for what to do. 
 

Step 10:    Claim of Exemption 

 I

he  NOTICE  form  (CIV-530)  tells  the  debtor  about  the  debtor's  right  to  claim  exemptions.  
The  debtor  has  15  days  from  the  date  the  notice  is  received  to  claim  exemptions.    If  the 
debtor wants to claim an exemption, the debtor must fill out the  CLAIM OF EXEMPTION form 
(CIV-531) and file it with the court.  If the debtor files a claim form, the court will send you 
a copy of the claim and a form you can use to respond to the  CLAIM (CIV-516).  You must 
file your response with the court within 10 days.  The court will decide the claim based on 
the information submitted, or the court will schedule a hearing.  If a hearing is ordered, the 
court will notify both you and the debtor of the date and time it will be held.  At the hearing, 
the debtor has the responsibility of convincing the court that the debtor should be given the 
exemption.14  You will have an opportunity to question the debtor and present any evidence 
you wish. 

If the debtor does not file a CLAIM within 15 days after receiving the NOTICE form, the court 
will ordinarily conclude that the debtor has given up any possible claims, and the court will 
send  the  money  to  you  as  soon  as  it  is  sure  the  employer's  check  has  cleared  the  bank.  
However, the court will not send the money to you until the court has received proof that the 
CIV-530 NOTICE has been served on the debtor. 

nly  part  of  the  debtor's  wages  can  be  seized.    The  WRIT  (form  CIV-525)  and  the  NOTICE 

(form CIV-530) both explain the automatic exemption the debtor gets. 

tep 11:    Collection of Money 

nce the  WRIT is served on the employer, the employer should begin sending payments to 
the court.  The court will hold the money in its trust account for about 30 days.  This 30-day 
waiting period allows the court to be sure the check has cleared the bank and also allows the 
debtor time to object to the seizure of the wages.

Unless ordered to do otherwise by the court, the employer should keep sending payments to 
the court on each of the debtor's paydays until the amount stated in the WRIT has been paid in 
full. 

tep 12:    Supplemental Notice to Writ of Execution 

fter the amount stated in the WRIT is paid in full, you may want to try to collect interest on 
the debt from the date of the WRIT to the date the debt was paid.  The interest rate is usually 
stated in the judgment.15   You also may want to collect for the costs of having the WRIT and 
other  papers  served  on  the  employer  and  the  debtor.    You  may  ask  the  court  for  a 
SUPPLEMENTAL  NOTICE  TO  WRIT  OF  EXECUTION  FOR  GARNISHMENT  (CIV-533)  to  collect  the 
interest and costs.  The court will send this NOTICE to the employer by first class mail. 

tep 13:    Terminating Writ 

f for some reason the employer keeps sending payments to the court after your judgment is 
satisfied,  you  should  tell  the  court  this  so  the  court  can  send  the  employer  a  NOTICE  OF 
TERMINATION  OF  WRIT  OF  EXECUTION  (CIV-542).    This  might  happen,  for  example,  if  you 
receive  partial  payment  of  the  judgment  from  another  source  (e.g.,  a  voluntary  payment 
from the debtor or another levy) while the wage garnishment is still continuing.

EXECUTING ON DEBTOR'S PROPERTY 

 
The procedure described in this section can be used to execute on many kinds of property.  
There  are,  however,  some  kinds  of  personal  property  for  which  this  procedure  cannot  be 
used  (for  example:    household  goods).    See  Section  C  beginning  on  page  17  for  the 
procedure to use to execute on these special kinds of personal property.16  Also, see Section 
D,  page  23,  if  you  have  a  judgment  for  specific  personal  property  rather  than  a  money 
judgment.  See booklet CIV-503 for the procedures for executing on the Alaska Permanent 
Fund Dividend. 

he following are a few examples of the types of property which can be executed upon by 

using the procedure described in this section: 
 

cash 
bank accounts 
stocks and bonds 
coin collections 
land 
houses 
business inventory and equipment 
guns 

S  09.35.030(1)  requires  you  to  execute  on  personal  property  before  executing  on  real 
property.   If sufficient personal property to satisfy the debt cannot be  found, you  can then 
execute on real property.  "Real property" includes land, houses, and generally whatever is 
erected on, growing upon, or affixed to land.  All other property is personal property. 

efore  you  decide  which  property  of  the  debtor's  to  try  to  seize,  you  should  read  the 
JUDGMENT DEBTOR  BOOKLET to see if there is an exemption which will protect the property 
from seizure. 

ote  About Filling  Out Forms:   When  filling out forms, please type or print clearly and 
use black ink. Press hard so your printing will show through on all copies of each form. See 
the illustration on page 4 for how to fill out the tops of the forms. 
 

 
16  Note about Motor Vehicles:  The procedure for executing upon motor vehicles is not entirely clear in the 
statutes.    Some  judges  allow  the  procedures  in  this  section  (Section  B)  to  be  used  if  the  vehicle  to  be 
seized  is  worth  more  than  $27,000  or  if  the  debtor  has  more  than  one  motor  vehicle.    They  require  the 
procedures in Section C (page 17) to be used if the debtor's only vehicle is worth less than $27,000.  Other 
judges,  however,  require  the  procedures  in  Section  C  to  be  followed  no  matter  how  many  vehicles  the 
debtor owns and no matter what their value.  If you are not sure which procedure the judge in your case 
will require, it is probably safest to follow Section C procedure to seize a motor vehicle.  Otherwise, if you 
use Section B procedure and the judge decides that it is not the correct procedure, you may have to return 
the  vehicle  to  the  debtor  and  not  be  able  to  recover  your  costs  of  seizure.    See  AS  09.38.075,    AS 
09.38.020, and 8 AAC 95.030.

1.  Debtor Files CLAIM  OF  EXEMPTIONS 

Executing on Debtor’s Property 

If the debtor files a CLAIM OF EXEMPTIONS, the court will send you a copy of the claim 
and  a  form  you  can  use  to  respond  to  the  claim  (CIV-516).    You  must  file  your 
response  with  the  court  within  10  days.    When  you  receive  the  debtor’s  claim,  you 
must be sure to tell your process server not to sell any property the process server has 
seized until the court decides whether to grant the debtor's claim of exemptions. 

The court will decide the claim based on the information submitted, or the court will 
schedule  a  hearing.    If  a  hearing  is  ordered,  the  court  will  notify  both  you  and  the 
debtor  of  the  date  and  time  it  will  be  held.    At  the  hearing,  the  debtor  has  the 
responsibility of convincing the court that the debtor qualifies for one or more of the 
exemptions  given  by  the  statutes.24    You  will  have  an  opportunity  to  question  the 
debtor and present any evidence you wish. 

The court will enter an order granting or denying the debtor's claimed exemptions and 
awarding any money seized either to you or to the debtor.  If the property seized was 
not  cash,  the  process  server,  pursuant  to  the  court's  order,  will  either  release  the 
property to the debtor or sell it at a public sale [after complying with the notice and 
other requirements of AS 09.35.140-.330 and AS 09.38.080(d)]. 

The money from the sale will be sent to the court.  Note:  You will either have to pay 
the costs of the sale in advance or the costs will be deducted from the proceeds of the 
sale.    Be  aware  that  you  may  not  be  able  to  recover  some  of  these  costs  from  the 
debtor.  You should ask your process server what these costs will be before you decide 
to have property seized. 

You should also be aware that if the bids at the sale are too low, the property cannot be 
sold.    A  bid  for  property  that  is  less  than  the  exempt  value  is  not acceptable.25    If a 
high  enough  bid  is  not  received,  the  process  server  must  by  statute26  return  the 
property to the debtor.  If this happens, the costs of seizing the property, offering it for 
sale  and  returning  it  will  all  be  charged  to  you,  and  you  cannot  recover  these  costs 
from the debtor. 

When the court receives the money, it will deposit the money in its trust account.  If 
the court was given cash, the court can release the money (by a trust account check) 
right away.  If the court was given a check, the court will have to wait until the check 
clears the bank (possibly 30 days in some courts) before releasing the money. 

 
24  AS 09.38.080(f) 
25  Note: Be aware that AS 09.38.080(d) also requires: "If indebtedness secured by a valid lien is  chargeable 
against  the  proceeds  of  the  sale,  the  bid  must  exceed  the  amount  of  the  indebtedness  secured  plus  the 
amount of the exempt value."

If the debtor does not file a  CLAIM OF EXEMPTIONS with the court within 15 days from 
the date the notice is received, the process server can sell the property at a public sale 
as described above and forward the proceeds to the court for distribution. 

tep 10:    Collection of Money 

he  court  will  hold  the  money  in  its  trust  account  for  about  30  days  before  releasing  the 
money to you.  This 30-day waiting period allows the court to be sure the check has cleared 
the bank and also allows the judgment debtor time to object to the seizure of the property. 

tep 11:    Terminating Writ 

s soon as the judgment and all post-judgment costs and interest have been paid, you must 

instruct your process server to immediately return the WRIT to the court.27

  EXECUTING ON CERTAIN KINDS OF DEBTOR'S PERSONAL 

PROPERTY 
 
(Section .020 Property28) 
 
State law gives special protection to certain kinds of personal property.  The law does this by 
allowing the debtor to claim exemptions up to a certain amount for each kind of protected 
property.    The  following  are  the  types  of  protected  property  and  the  amount  of  the 
exemption for each type: 

.  Up to  $4,050  worth of household  goods, clothes, books, musical instruments, family 

.  Up to $3,780  worth of professional books and tools of trade 

portraits and heirlooms 

.  Up to $1,350  worth of jewelry 

.  Up to $1,350  for pets 

exceed $27,000 

.  Up  to  $4,050  in  one  motor  vehicle  if  the  full  value  of  the  motor  vehicle  does  not 

ote that the exempt amounts are for the debtor's equity in the property, not for the actual 
value of the property.  Thus, for example, if the only jewelry the debtor owns is a diamond 
ring worth $1,500 and the debtor still owes the jewelry store $500 for it, the debtor's equity 
in the ring would only be $1,000 and the ring would be protected from seizure because of 
the $1,350 exemption for jewelry. 

ou  can  still  try  to  execute  upon  these  types  of  property  (if  there  is  equity  which  is  not 
exempt), but the procedure is different from the procedure used to execute upon other types 
of personal property or real property belonging to the debtor.  The debtor must be given an 
opportunity to claim exemptions in the property you wish to seize before the court will issue 
a writ allowing the property to be seized. 

 

 
28  The Alaska Statutes call this category of property "Personal Property Subject to Value Limitations."  AS 
09.38.020.  Note that the current exemption amounts are in the Administrative Code in 8 AAC 95.030(b) 
rather than in the statute, AS 09.38.020.

and Sony video tape recorder.  I believe this property is not exempt because the 
total  value  of  the  debtor's  equity  in  this  property  is  approximately  $7,000  and 
debtor's exemption for this type of property is only $4,050." 

"I wish to seize debtor's 2009 Volvo sedan.  I believe this property is not exempt 
because the total value of the debtor's equity in this car is about $10,000, and the 
debtor is only entitled to an exemption of $4,050 in one motor vehicle."

notified; and you will either have to revise your  AFFIDAVIT or try some other way to collect 
your debt. 

f the judge approves your AFFIDAVIT AND REQUEST, the judge will sign the ORDER TO DEBTOR 
and the court will mail the “Order to Debtor Packet” to you for service on the debtor.  The 
ORDER  informs  the  debtor  of  your  intent  to  seize  the  property  listed  in  your  AFFIDAVIT, 
explains  the  debtor's  right  to  object,  and  orders  the  debtor  not  to  dispose  of  any  of  the 
property for 30 days. 

tep 4:    Serve “Order to Debtor Packet” on Debtor 

he three forms in the "Order To Debtor Packet" must be served on the debtor either by a 
process server or by certified mail.  The two types of service are explained on pages  24-28.  
Select one and follow the instructions. 

f you are going to have the packet served by a process server, you must use form CIV-615, 
SERVICE INSTRUCTIONS (or your process server's version of it) to tell the process server how to 
serve  the  packet.  List  the  three  forms  in  the  packet  and  describe  where  the  debtor  can  be 
found.   

tep 5:    Proof of Service of the “Order to Debtor Packet” 

roof  that  the  "Order  to  Debtor  Packet"  was  served  on  the  debtor  must  be  filed  with  the 

court before the court will issue a writ of execution. 

If the packet is served by a process server, the process server will file proof of service 
with the court.  If you have any questions, you should contact the process server.   

If the packet is served by certified mail, the green postal receipt card will be returned 
to  you.    You  must  file  it  with  the  court along  with  an  affidavit  of  service  (see  form 
CIV-620). 

f the envelope sent to the debtor is returned to you, see paragraph "e" (Debtor's Packet 
Not Served) on page 26 for what to do. 
 

Step 6:    Claim of Exemptions 

 I

he debtor has 15 days from the date of issuance of the ORDER TO DEBTOR to file a CLAIM OF 

EXEMPTIONS with the court. 

.  Debtor Files CLAIM OF EXEMPTIONS 

If the debtor files a CLAIM OF EXEMPTIONS, the court will schedule a hearing.  Both you 
and the debtor will be notified of the hearing date.  The hearing should, if possible, be 
held before the 30-day order preventing disposal of the property expires.  If it cannot 
be held before then, you must ask the court to extend the order for a longer period of 
time.

Executing on Section .020 Property 

At the hearing, the judge will decide whether to grant the debtor's claim of exemptions.  
The judge's order will say whether or not a  WRIT OF EXECUTION may be issued to seize 
any of the property you listed in your AFFIDAVIT. 

.  Debtor Fails to File CLAIM OF EXEMPTIONS 

If the debtor does not respond within the 15 days, you may do one of the following two 
things: 

If you know the location and description of the property listed in your AFFIDAVIT, 
you may ask the clerk of court to issue a WRIT OF EXECUTION. 

If  you do not know the location of the items listed in your  AFFIDAVIT or if  you 
want  more  information  about  the  description  or  value  of  the  property,  you  can 
ask the court to order the debtor to appear in court so that you can ask the debtor 
questions under oath to obtain this information.  To do this, do the following: 

(1)  Ask the clerk for form CIV-540, MOTION AND ORDER FOR JUDGMENT DEBTOR 

TO APPEAR. 

a. 

. 

 b

 

2)  Fill out the top of the form and the "Motion" section.   If you want the court 
to  order  the  debtor  not  to  dispose  of  the  property  listed  in  your  affidavit, 
you must ask for that in your motion. 

3)  File the CIV-540 MOTION with the court.   

f the judge grants your motion, the judge will sign the Order section of the form 
setting the date for the hearing.  The clerk will send you and the debtor a copy of 
the  order  by  first  class  mail.    If  you  want  to  be  able  to  prove  that  the  debtor 
received this order, you can have a process server serve the order on the debtor or 
mail or mail a copy of the order by certified mail as described on page  25.  You 
might want to do this if the restraining order box is checked and you want to later 
be able to prove that the debtor received notice of that order.

ISSUANCE OF WRIT OF EXECUTION 
 
If the judge orders that a WRIT OF EXECUTION may be issued (after the hearing on the debtor's 
claim  of  exemptions)  or  if  the  debtor  does  not  claim  exemptions  within  15  days  of  being 
notified of the debtor's rights, you may ask the clerk to issue a  GENERAL WRIT OF EXECUTION 
(CIV-500). 

tep 7:    Choose Process Server 

he  WRIT  must  be  served  on  (delivered  to)  the  person  in  possession  of  the  property  by  a 
process  server  or  peace  officer.    To  pick  a  process  server,  follow  the  instructions  for 
"Personal Service by Process Server" on  page  24. You will need to know the name of the 
process server in order to fill out the service instructions in Step 8 below.

Step 8:    Fill Out Forms in "Writ Request Packet" 

ou must complete the following forms: 

.  CIV-501, INFORMATION  FOR  ISSUANCE OF WRIT OF EXECUTION 

Fill out the entire form.  In the “Type of Writ” section, check the box for form  CIV-
500, GENERAL WRIT OF EXECUTION. 

.  CIV-615, SERVICE  INSTRUCTIONS 

Fill out the entire form (or your process server's version of this form).  On this form, 
you  must  tell  the  process  server  what  property  to  seize  and  where  that  property  is 
located.  The property will be the property you listed in your AFFIDAVIT except for any 
listed property which the court has declared exempt and totally protected from seizure.  
You  will  probably  want  to  discuss  the  procedures  with  your  process  server  before 
filling out the form. 

tep 9:    File Forms with Court 

fter filling out the forms, file them with the court. 

tep 10:    Clerk Prepares the Writ and Delivers it to Process Server 

he  clerk  will  prepare  a  GENERAL  WRIT  OF  EXECUTION  (CIV-500)  and  deliver  it  and  the 
process server instructions to the process server you named in your CIV-615 process server 
instructions.   

tep 11:  Process Server Takes Possession  of the Property, Sells It  and  Deposits  the 

Money with the Court 

he process server will take possession29 of the property and sell it at a public auction after 
complying  with  the  requirements  of  Alaska  Statutes  09.35.140-.170  and  Alaska  Statute 
09.38.080(d).  Notice of the sale must be posted for at least 10 days prior to the sale, so it 
will probably be a minimum of two weeks after the property is seized before the proceeds of 
the sale will be deposited with the court by the process server. 

ote  that  you  will  either  have  to  pay  the  costs  of  the  sale  in advance  or  the  costs  will  be 
deducted from the proceeds of the sale.  Be aware that you may not be able to recover some 
of these costs from the debtor.  You should ask your process server what these costs will be 
before you decide to have property seized. 

 
29  To make the levy, your process server must give the person holding the debtor's property both a certified 
copy of the WRIT and a notice  specifying what property  is  being  levied upon. AS 09.35.110, Civil Rule 
89(f)(3)  and  Beery  v.  Browning,  717  P.2d  365  (Alaska  1986).  (Usually  process  servers  have  their  own 
NOTICE OF LEVY forms.)

You should be aware that if the bids at the sale are too low, the property cannot be sold.  A 
bid for property that is less than the exempt value is not acceptable.30  If a high enough bid is 
not received, the process server must by  statute31 return the property  to the debtor.  If this 
happens,  the  costs  of  seizing  the  property,  offering  it  for  sale  and  returning  it  will  all  be 
charged to you, and you cannot recover these costs from the debtor. 

tep 12:    Release of Money 

hen  the  court  receives  the  money,  it  will  deposit  the  money  in  its  trust  account.    If  the 
money is in cash, the court can release the money (by a trust account check) right away.  If 
the court is  given  a  check, the  court  will  hold the money  in  its trust  account  for about  30 
days.  This 30-day waiting period allows the court to be sure the check has cleared the bank. 

tep 13:    Terminating Writ 

f the judgment and post-judgment costs and interest are paid to you before the writ is served 
or  before  the  property  is  sold  at  auction,  you  must  instruct  your  process  server  to  either 
immediately return the writ to the court or to return the seized property to the debtor.

  JUDGMENTS TO COLLECT SPECIFIC PERSONAL PROPERTY 

 
Most of this booklet describes what to do if you win a judgment stating that the debtor owes 
you money.  The procedures are quite different if you win a judgment stating that you are 
entitled to take possession of a specific item of personal property.  Except as described in the 
footnote below,32 if you win a judgment for specific personal property, you do not need to 
file a creditor's affidavit with the court or serve a notice of levy on the debtor because there 
are no exemptions which the debtor can claim.  Instead, you must ask the court for the CIV-
580    WRIT    OF    EXECUTION    FOR    DELIVERY    OF    SPECIFIC    PERSONAL    PROPERTY    LISTED    IN  
JUDGMENT (REPLEVIN). 

ill  out  the  entire  CIV-580  form  except  the  clerk's  signature  and  date  and  the  other 
information at the bottom of the form.  You must specifically describe the personal property 
which you plan to seize.  Your description must be identical to the description stated in your 
judgment.  Please type or print clearly when filling out this form.  Also, please use black ink.  
Press hard so your printing will show through all copies of the form. 

ou  must  then  arrange  for  the  WRIT  to  be  served  on  the  debtor  or  the  person  holding  the 
debtor's property.  Follow the instructions on page 24 about choosing and paying a process 
server.    Use  either  the  court's  CIV-615  SERVICE  INSTRUCTIONS  form  or  the  process  server's 
version of it.  On it you must describe the property you want your process server to seize, 
tell where it is located and name the person in possession of it. 

eturn  the  WRIT  and  SERVICE    INSTRUCTIONS  to  the  clerk.    The  clerk  will  compare  the 
information on your WRIT to your judgment and, if it is correct, sign the WRIT.  The clerk will 
issue the WRIT to the process server you selected. 

The process server will serve the WRIT upon the person in possession of the property.33  That 
person must then turn the property over to the process server.  When the process server takes 
possession of the property, the process server must turn the property over to you as ordered 
in the judgment.34 

 

 
32  You will not be able to use the procedure described in this section if AS 09.38.070 applies to you.  This 
statute may apply to you if you loaned the debtor money which has not been repaid and the property you 
wish to seize was security for that loan, but the loan was not made for the purpose of buying that property.  
If this describes your situation, see AS 09.38.070 for the procedure to follow. 

33  To make the levy, your process server must give the person holding the debtor's property both a certified 
copy  of  the  WRIT  and  a  notice  specifying  what  property  is  being  levied  upon.    Usually  process  servers 
have their own NOTICE OF LEVY forms.  The Alaska State Troopers use Trooper form 12-305-1, Notice 
of Levy of Specific Personal Property Listed in Judgment.  AS 09.35.110, Civil Rule 89(f)(3) and Beery v. 
Browning, 717 P.2d 365 (Alaska 1986). 

34  Ordinarily,  the  property  is  then  yours  to  do  with  as  you  wish.    However,  in  some  cases,  your  judgment 

may require you to sell the property and apply the proceeds to the debt which the debtor owes you.

a.  Choose  a  process  server.    The  court  clerk  will  have  a list  of  process  servers  in 
your area.  You can also find a list of licensed process servers on the Department 
of  Public  Safety  website:  http://dps.alaska.gov/statewide/PermitsLicensing.  
Click “Process Server List.”  Many parts of the state do not have process servers.  
In  those  areas,  "process"35  is  served  by  peace  officers  (usually  by  State 
Troopers). 

If  the  process  server  is  not  in  your  community,  you  must  give  the  court  an 
envelope addressed to the process server with sufficient postage so the clerk can 
mail the documents to the process server. 

.  Contact the process server to determine the service fee.  Pay the fee directly to 
the  process  server  unless  the  process  server  is  not  in  your  community.    In  that 
case,  make  your  check  payable  to  the  process  server  but  give  it  to  the  clerk  to 
mail with the documents to be served. 

Fees  are  set  by  the  individual  process  server.    However,  the  maximum  amount 
you may recover as costs from the debtor is governed by Administrative Rule 11. 

Fill out SERVICE INSTRUCTIONS.  Use either the process server's form or one of the 
following court forms: 

CIV-561 
CIV-560

 HOW  TO  LOCATE  DEBTOR'S  ASSETS 

 
As  stated  earlier  in  this  booklet,  it  is  your  responsibility  to  find  the  debtor's  money  or 
property which can be seized. 
 

A.  

PLACES  TO  LOOK 

f  you  are  having  trouble  finding  this  information, the  following  are  some  places you  can 
check: 

.  Municipal (City) Tax Department.  At this office, you can ask if the debtor is paying 
taxes on any property.  Depending on the city, you may be able to find out a variety of 
information about the debtor's assets.  In Anchorage, for example, you could learn the 
following: 

CHRIS CREDITOR 
CHRIS CREDITOR 
626 CIRCLE AVENUE 
626 CIRCLE AVENUE 
ANCHORAGE AK 99508 - 1234 
ANCHORAGE AK 99508 - 1234 

3A - 08 - 333  CI 
3A - 08 - 333  CI 

Personal  Property.    You  could  find  out whether  the  debtor  has  filed  a  personal 
property return, his address, and the total value of the items listed.  You cannot, 
however,  find  out  which  particular  items  of  personal  property  (recreational 
vehicles, mobile homes, boats, etc.) are listed on the return. 

)  Business Property.  Same as personal property.  You can find out if a return has

Polk's  Directory.  R.L.  Polk &  Co. publishes a directory for most major cities in the 
United States.  In Alaska there are ones for Anchorage; Fairbanks/Northstar Borough; 
Mat-Su Valley; and Southeast Alaska.  Some public libraries have the directories.  One 
section of each directory is an alphabetical list of the names of all adult residents of the 
city.    In  this  section  the  directory  lists  as  much  of  the  following  information  as  the 
company  has  been  able  to  obtain:    name,  address,  marital  status,  occupation  and 
X 
employer.    The  company  gets  its  information  for  the  directory  from  door  to  door 
canvassing;  so,  even  though  the  directory  is  revised  annually,  it  is  not  necessarily 
complete  or  up-to-date.    Note:    The  directory  also  has  information  about  businesses, 
such as names of officers, owners and managers.  Other sections of the directory  list 
addresses by street number or name and telephone numbers in numerical order.

HOW TO LOCATE DEBTOR'S ASSETS 

 
As  stated  earlier  in  this  booklet,  it  is  your  responsibility  to  find  the  debtor's  money  or 
property which can be seized. 
 

A. 

PLACES TO LOOK 

f you are having trouble finding this information, following are some places you can check: 

.  Municipal (City) Tax Department.  At this office, you can ask if the debtor is paying 
taxes on any property.  Depending on the city, you may be able to find out a variety of 
information about the debtor's assets.  In Anchorage, for example, you could learn the 
following: 

a)  Real  Estate.    You  can  find  out  whether  the  debtor  owns  land  within  the 
municipality, the debtor's mailing address, the location of the land, and the value 
of the land and any buildings on it.  For Anchorage, this information is available 
online at http://www.muni.org/pw/public.html. 

b) 

Personal  Property.  You  can  find  out  if the  debtor  has  filed  a  personal  property 
return, the debtor’s address, and the total value of the items listed.  You cannot, 
however,  find  out  which  particular  items  of  personal  property  (recreational 
vehicles, mobile homes, boats, etc.) are listed on the return. 

c)  Business Property.  Same as personal property.  You can find out if a return has 
been filed and the total value of the items listed, but you cannot find out which 
items are listed. 

State  Land  Recorder's  Office.    You  can  examine  land  records  at  the  state  recorder’s 
office  to  see  if  the  debtor  owns  any  real  estate  in  Alaska  or  another  state.    For  real 
estate in Alaska you can conduct your research online at the Recorders Office of the 
Alaska 
at 
http://dnr.alaska.gov/ssd/recoff/searchRO.cfm.    For  real  estate  outside  of  Alaska, 
contact the recorder’s office in the area where you believe the property is located.

.  Banks.  Banks will not tell you if a person has an account with them unless they are 
served with a WRIT OF EXECUTION.  If you think it is worth the service fee to find this 
out,  you  can  have  a  process  server  serve  a  WRIT  on  any  bank  where  you  think  the 
debtor might have an account. 

Employers.  If you think you know where the debtor works, you can call the employer 
and ask if the debtor works there.  You can also contact past employers for information 
about 
debtor.   
Note:  Employers are not legally required to answer your questions. 

locating 

the 

.  Business  License  Information.    If  you  think  the  debtor  may  have  a  business  or 
professional license in Alaska, you can search for information about the debtor and the 
debtor’s  business  at  https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/.    Other  state  or  local 
agencies outside of Alaska may have similar online search capabilities.

State Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV).  At DMV, you can find out if the debtor has 
any vehicles registered in the debtor’s name.37   For records from Alaska DMV, there 
will  be  a  $10  charge  for  each  record  found.    You  can  request  records  online  at 
doa.alaska.gov/dmv/forms/pdfs/851.pdf. 

 

In  Alaska 

there  are  Polk  Directories 

Polk's  Directory.  R.L.  Polk & Co. publishes a directory for most major cities in the 
United  States. 
for  Anchorage; 
Fairbanks/Northstar  Borough;  Mat-Su  Valley;  and  Southeast  Alaska.    Some  public 
libraries have the directories.  One section of each directory is an alphabetical list of 
the names of all adult residents of the city.  In this section the directory lists as much of 
the  following  information  as  the  company  has  been  able  to  obtain:    name,  address, 
marital  status,  occupation  and  employer.    The  company  gets  its  information  for  the 
directory from door to door canvassing; so, even though the directory is revised every 
year,  it  is  not  necessarily  complete  or  up-to-date.    Note:  The  directory  also  has 
information about businesses, such as names of officers, owners and managers.  Other 
sections  of  the  directory  list  addresses  by  street  number  or  name  and  telephone 
numbers in numerical order. 

Telephone Directory.  Most communities have at least one telephone directory where 
you can search for the debtor’s telephone number and address at no charge. Many local 
telephone companies also offer directory assistance for a fee.   

People-Finder Research on the Internet.  There are many internet search engines and 
web-based businesses that may help you locate a debtor and the debtor’s assets at no 
charge.    For  a  comprehensive  list  of  people-finder  websites  and  other  search 
techniques,

0.  Locate-and-Research Company.  There are several private information companies that 
offer online research support to help you locate a debtor and the debtor’s assets for a 
fee.    Examples  of  locate-and-research  companies  include,  but  are  not  limited  to, 
Accurint, Ingens, and Motznik.   

1.  Trial Court Records.   You may search the Alaska Court System’s trial court records 
online  (https://records.courts.alaska.gov/)  to  find  any  cases  involving  the  debtor.    If 
you  find  cases  online,  you  will  need  to go  to  the  courthouse  to  check the  files  for  a 
current address or information about any assets (such as a list of property in a divorce 
case).    You  may  search  court  records  outside  of  Alaska  by  contacting  those  courts 
directly. 

2.  Military.  If you believe that the debtor is in the military, you may contact one of the 

following military locator services:   

 
 

Air Force: (210) 565-2660 
Army: (888) 276-9472

Investigative Services.  Some process servers and private investigators will, for a fee, 
search for the debtor's assets for you.  Since they are experienced at this, they may be 
able to do it more efficiently than you.  You will have to judge, however, whether the 
possibility of finding assets is worth the cost.  The court may or may not allow you to 
recover these investigative costs from the debtor. 

4.  Personal  Demand  by  Process  Server.    Once  you  get  a  WRIT  OF  EXECUTION,  you  can 
instruct your process server to make a personal demand upon the debtor.  This means 
the process server would contact the debtor and ask the debtor to turn over all money 
or  other  property  of  value  currently  in  the  debtor's  possession  up  to  the  amount 
necessary to pay the judgment.  The process server, of course, charges a fee for doing 
this. 

B. 

JUDGMENT DEBTOR HEARING 

here  is  also  a  court  proceeding  which  may  help  you  locate  the  debtor's  assets:    the 

judgment debtor hearing.38 

t a judgment debtor hearing, you (the judgment creditor) will be given a chance to ask the 

debtor (who will be under oath) what property he has and where it is located. 

f you want a judgment debtor hearing, ask the clerk for form CIV-540, MOTION  AND  ORDER  
FOR  JUDGMENT    DEBTOR    TO    APPEAR.   Fill out the top of the form (see illustration no. 1 on 
page  4)  and  the  Motion  section  of the  form.    If  you  want  the  court to  order  the  debtor  to 
bring certain documents to the hearing, you must list the documents in the second paragraph 
of the Motion. 

f you want the court to order the debtor not to dispose of property  before the hearing, you 
must ask for that in your motion.

Some courts may also ask you to go to the Calendaring Department and schedule a hearing 
time that is convenient for you before the ORDER will be signed. The hearing date should be 
far enough away so there is time for the debtor to receive the court’s notice of the hearing.   

he court will send notice of the hearing by first class mail.  If you want to be able to prove 
that  the  debtor  received  notice  of  the  hearing  and  the  court’s  order  not  to  dispose  of 
property, you may want to also send the notice by certified mail as described on page 25 or 
have it served by a process server. 
 

What Happens at the Hearing 
 

If you have difficulty hearing, tell the clerk and ask to use the assisted 
listening equipment available in the courtrooms. 

You may bring your lawyer with you to the hearing.  The debtor may also bring a lawyer. 

 

t the hearing, the judge or clerk will ask the debtor to take the witness stand.  The debtor 

will have to swear (or affirm) that he or she will truthfully answer any questions asked.  

he judge will then tell you (or your lawyer) that you may begin asking your questions. 

enerally, you can ask any question you can think of about the debtor's assets and his or her 
current and possible future financial situation.  The following are a few things you could ask 
about: 

place of employment and amount of earnings 

any income from sources other than debtor's job 

location  and  value  of  any  houses,  land,  etc.  which  debtor  owns  or  has  an 
interest in 

location,  description  and  value  of  any  motor  vehicles,  airplanes,  boats,  etc. 
which debtor owns or has an interest in 

any businesses debtor owns 

bank accounts (location and amount) 

stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit, savings bonds, time certificates, money 
market funds, etc. 

safety deposit box 

interest or dividend payments from any source (including Alaska Permanent 
Fund dividends) 

whether anyone owes any money to debtor 

whether debtor has an income tax refund coming 

cash currently in debtor's possession 

other valuables (jewelry, paintings, stereo equipment, etc.)

The  debtor  can  object  to  your  questions.    If  an  objection  is  made,  the  judge  will  have  to 
decide if your question is relevant; that is, if it has some logical relationship to the debtor's 
current or future financial situation.  If the judge decides the question is relevant and orders 
the  debtor  to  answer  it,  the  debtor  must answer  it.    If  the  debtor  refuses  to  answer  it,  the 
judge can hold the debtor in contempt of court. 

f  the  examination  shows  that  the  debtor  has  property  which  could  be  executed  upon,  the 
judge can order the debtor to use the property to satisfy the judgment.39 

lternatively,  you  can  use  the  information  gained  at  the  hearing  to  locate  the  debtor's 
property and have it seized under a WRIT  OF  EXECUTION.  You may want to ask the judge at 
the hearing to order the debtor not to dispose of the property for a certain period of time so 
that you can have it picked up under a writ. 
 

C.   

FORMAL DISCOVERY PROCEDURES 

 
You may also use the formal discovery procedures set forth in Civil Rules 26 through 37 to 
find the debtor's assets.40  You will probably need the assistance of a lawyer to do this.

OTHER REMEDIES 

 
Two  other  things  you  can  do  if  you  are  having  difficulty  getting  the  debtor  to  pay  the 
judgment are: record the judgment at the land recorder's office and (in certain cases) file a 
copy of the judgment with the Department of Public Safety. 

.  Land Recorder's Office. 

You  can  record  a  certified  copy  of  the  judgment  with  the  District  Recorder  at  any 
location  where  the  debtor  may  have  real  property  or  do  business.    Recording  a 
judgment creates a lien upon all the debtor's real property in the recording district.41 It 
creates a lien both upon real estate the debtor currently owns and  any he or she may 
purchase in the future.  The lien continues in effect for 10 years from the date of entry 
of the judgment.  In addition, a recorded judgment may affect the debtor's credit rating. 

ou can purchase a certified copy of the judgment from the court which entered the 
judgment.42  You will also have to pay a fee for recording the document at the District 
Recorder's office.43 

he court clerk can tell you where the nearest recording office is.  You will need to 
know  the  name  of  the  recording  district  in  which  the  debtor's  property  is  located, 
because  you  must  record  your  judgment  in  that  district.    There  are  34  recording 
districts in Alaska.  If you know where the property is located, but you do not know 
the name of the correct recording district, you can call or write to any of the District 
Recorder's offices and get this information.  You can also get this information on the 
website  for  the  Recorder’s  Office  (in  the  Department  of  Natural  Resources)  at 
dnr.alaska.gov/ssd/recoff/default.cfm. 

f you do not live in the place where you want the judgment recorded, you can record 
the judgment by mail.  Write to the correct District Recorder and give the name of the 
recording  district  in  which  your  judgment  should  be  recorded.44    Enclose  a  certified 
copy of the judgment and a check for the correct amount of fees made payable to the 
"Department of Natural Resources."  Also, write on the judgment: “Return To: your 
name and address.”  The recording office needs this so the judgment can be returned to 
you  after  recording.    This  information  must  be  on  the  judgment,  not  just  in  a  cover 
letter.

Note:    When  the  debtor  pays  the  judgment,  you  must  give  the  debtor  an 
"acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment."  See Section VI of this booklet, page 
36.    In  addition,  if  you  previously  recorded  the  judgment,  you  must  include  the 
following in your acknowledgment:45 

the  book  and  page  of  the  official  record  in  which  the  judgment  has  been 
recorded, or the serial number assigned to the judgment by the recorder, and 

the full name of the judgment debtor as it appears upon the judgment recorded.  

B.  Department of Public Safety 
 

Under certain circumstances, if your judgment arose from a motor vehicle accident and 
the debtor fails to pay it within 30 days after the judgment is final, the Department of 
Administration  will  suspend  the  debtor's  driver's  license  until  the  judgment  is  paid.  
For this purpose, a judgment is final when the time for appeal has passed without the 
debtor having filed an appeal or, if the debtor did file an appeal, the debtor has lost the 
appeal.46 

f  the  debtor  fails to  satisfy  the  judgment  within  30  days  after  the  judgment  is  final, 
you may ask the clerk of court to send a certified copy of the judgment along with a 
certificate  of  facts  (form  CIV-405)  about  the  judgment  to  the  Department  of 
Administration.47  The court will not charge you a fee for this, but you will have to fill 
in all the information in the CIV-405 form and sign it.  You will also need to provide a 
certified copy of the judgment and envelopes addressed to the plaintiff and defendant 
in the case. 

hen  the  Department  receives  these  documents,  it  will  suspend  the  debtor's  driver's 
license.48  The suspension will remain in effect (and no license or registration will be 
issued  to  the  debtor)  until  the  judgment  is  satisfied  (or  stayed)  and  until  the  debtor 
gives  proof  of  financial  responsibility  for  the  future.49    See  AS  28.20.360  for  the 
definition  of  when  a  judgment  is  considered  satisfied  for  purposes  of  this  license 
suspension procedure.  Also  see  AS 28.20.300-.325 for  some situations in which the 
debtor's driver's license will not be suspended.

VI. 

  CREDITOR'S DUTY TO ACKNOWLEDGE SATISFACTION OF 

JUDGMENT 
 
When the debtor pays the judgment (including costs and interest), it is your duty to give the 
debtor a document acknowledging that the judgment has been satisfied.50 

he  Alaska  Statutes51  require  that  if  your  judgment  is  satisfied  otherwise  than  upon  an 
execution,  you  or  your  lawyer  must  "deliver  a  written  acknowledgment  of  satisfaction  of 
judgment suitable for recordation immediately upon payment in cash or within 10 days after 
payment if payment is made in any other manner, and, upon motion, the court may compel 
an acknowledgment of satisfaction or may order the entry of satisfaction to be made without 
it." 

lso, after the judgment is paid in full, if the debtor makes a written demand upon you to do 
so, you must execute and file an acknowledgment of satisfaction with the court.  If you fail 
to do so within 30 days without just cause, the Alaska Statutes state that you will be liable to 
the debtor for all damages which the debtor may sustain because of that failure and that you 
will have to pay the debtor $100.52 

lso, court rules require that in all small claims cases you must file an acknowledgment of 

satisfaction with the court.53  (Form SC-17, SATISFACTION OF JUDGMENT may be used.)

The Alaska Court System provides a helpful online tool called Tips for Locating 
People at http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/shctips.htm.  You could search for 
the  debtor  using  that  tool  and  you  could  use  the  other  techniques  described  in 
Section IV of this booklet.   

.  You could refer the case to a collection agency which might be able to find the 

debtor. 

.  You also could check with your accountant or the IRS to find out whether you 

can deduct the loss when you file your income tax return. 

.  Note:   Even though  you cannot find the debtor, if you can find property of the 
debtor,  you  may  be  able  to  proceed  with  execution  against  the  property.    You 
will  have  to  get the  court's  permission  to  make  special  provisions  for  notifying 
the absent debtor. 

2.  What if the debtor does not live in Alaska? 
 

If you can find property of the debtor in Alaska, you can proceed with execution 
against the property.  You will still have to serve the debtor with the notices and 
other documents required by the law.  Note:  If the debtor is not a "resident" of 
Alaska as defined in AS 09.38.120(b) (see Glossary), the debtor is not entitled to 
the  exemptions  provided  by  Alaska  law.    Instead,  the  debtor  is  entitled  to  the 
exemptions provided by the laws of the debtor's state.  AS 09.38.120. 

If the debtor has no property in Alaska but has property in another state, you may 
be  able  to  execute  on  that  property  by  following  the  execution  procedure 
prescribed by the laws of that state. 

3.  What if the debtor is a corporation? 

Corporations  are  not  entitled  to  exemptions  because  exemptions  belong  only  to 
individual persons.  Therefore, there is no need to serve a creditor's affidavit or notice 
of exemptions on the corporation.  Note, however, that the judgment must be against 
the corporation in its corporate name, and the property to be seized must be corporate 
property.   The court may require  you to  file an affidavit stating this before releasing 
any funds to you. 

.  What if the debtor is a borough, city or other public corporation? 

If  you  get a judgment against a borough,  city or other public corporation, no writ of 
execution  may  be  issued  on  the  judgment.    Instead,  you  must  follow  the  procedure 
described  in  AS  09.30.040  to  collect  the  amount  due.    A  "public  corporation"  is  a 
corporation organized for governmental purposes.

5.  What if the debtor is a partnership? 

Partnerships  are  not  entitled  to  exemptions  because  exemptions  belong  only  to 
individual persons. Therefore, there is no need to serve a creditor's affidavit or notice 
of exemptions on the partnership.  Note, however, that the judgment must be against 
the  partnership  (and  not  just against  the individual  members  of  the  partnership),  and 
the property to be seized must be partnership property.  The court may require you to 
file an affidavit stating this before releasing any funds to you. 

NOTE,  HOWEVER:    If  the  debtor  is an  individual  person  who  also  happens to  have an 
interest in a partnership, the specific partnership property is exempt from execution to 
collect  the  debts  of  that  individual  debtor  (which  are  not  partnership  debts).    AS 
09.38.100(b).  The income to the individual from the partnership could, of course, be 
executed  on.    For  further  information  about  partnerships,  see  Title  32  of  the  Alaska 
Statutes. 

.  What if the debtor's property is owned with another and they are not a partnership? 

For example:  What if the debtor is a husband and the title to the debtor's property is in 
the name of both husband and wife, can the property still be executed upon to pay the 
husband's debts? 

Answer:  Yes.  AS 09.38.100(a).  However, it is important to remember that only the 
debtor's interest in the property can be levied upon.  Therefore, even after the sale of 
the debtor's interest in the property, the original co-owner (in this case, the wife) would 
still  have  an  ownership  interest  in  the  property.    This  might  not  be  a  workable 
situation.    To  separate  these  interests  might  involve  a  court  partition  action.    As  a 
practical  matter,  this  procedure    is  complicated  and  you  should  contact  a  lawyer  for 
assistance. 

.  How  long  can  you  wait  after  your  judgment  is  entered  before  getting  a  writ  of 

execution?54 

No more than 5 years, unless you get an order from the court allowing you to get one 
later.  See AS 09.35.020 and Civil Rule 69(d). 

 
54  AS  09.10.040  states  that  a  “person  may  not  bring  an  action  upon  a  judgment  …  unless  the  action  is 
commenced within 10 years.”  However, this statute does not apply to writs of execution because writs of 
execution  are  enforcement  procedures  for  existing  judgments,  not  “actions”  seeking  to  obtain  new 
judgments.  State ex rel. Inman v. Dean, 902 P.2d 1321, 1322 (Alaska 1995).

VIII.   CLAIMS ENFORCEABLE AGAINST EXEMPT PROPERTY 
 
AS 09.38.065 lists some types of claims which are enforceable against exempt property.  If 
you have a judgment based on one of these types of claims, you should read this statute.  It 
states: 
 

(a)  Subject to AS 06.60.360(e), and notwithstanding other provisions of this 

(1)  a creditor may make a levy against exempt property of any kind to 

chapter, 
 

 

enforce a claim for 

(A)  child support; 

B)  unpaid earnings of up to one month's compensation or the full-
time  equivalent  of  one  month's  compensation  for  personal 
services of an employee; or 

C)  state or local taxes; 

(2)  a  creditor  may  make  a  levy  against  exempt  property  to  enforce  a 

claim for: 

(A) 

the  purchase  price  of  the  property  or  a  loan  made  for  the 
express  purpose  of  enabling  an  individual  to  purchase  the 
property and used for that purpose; 

B) 

labor  or  materials  furnished  to  make,  repair,  improve, 
preserve, store, or transport the property ; and 

C)  a  special  assessment  imposed  to  defray  costs  of  a  public 

improvement benefiting the property; and 

*(3)  a creditor may make a levy against exempt property of any kind to 
enforce the claim of a victim, including a judgment of restitution on 
behalf of a victim of a crime or a delinquent act, if the claim arises 
from conduct of the debtor that results in a conviction of a crime or 
an adjudication of delinquency, except that the debtor is entitled to 
an exemption in property 

(A)  not  to  exceed  an  aggregate  value  of  $3,000  chosen  by  the 

debtor from the following categories of property: 

 (

 (

 

 (

 (

 

 

 

 

(i) 

household  goods  and  wearing  apparel  reasonably 
necessary for one household; 

ii)  books and musical instruments, if reasonably held for the 
personal use of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor; 
and 

 (

 

CIV-550 (11/18) 
JUDGMENT CREDITOR BOOKLET 

39 

(iii)  family  portraits  and  heirlooms  of  particular  sentimental 

value to the debtor; and 

 

(B)  not  to  exceed  an  aggregate  value  of  $2,800  of  the  debtor's 

implements, professional books, and tools of the trade. 
 

(b)  Except as provided in  AS 09.38.070 limiting the enforcement of certain 
security  interests,  this  chapter  does  not  affect  any  statutory  lien  or 
security interest in exempt property. 
 

(c)  A  creditor  having  a  claim  enforceable  under  (a)  of  this  section  against 
exempt property, before, at the time of, or a reasonable time after making 
a levy on property of an individual, shall serve on the individual a notice 
of  the  levy  and  of  the  basis  for  the  creditor's  right  to  make  a  levy  on 
exempt property.   

 

 

 

 

 

*Note  that  a  victim  may  use  the  procedure  described  in  subparagraph  (a)(3) 
above  only  if  the  victim's  claim  arises  from  a  crime  committed  on  or  after 
September 15, 1991.  (sec 24 ch 57 SLA 1991) 

  

  

You  should  be  aware,  however,  that  even  though  this  statute  says  these  claims  are 
enforceable  against  exempt  property,  there  are  other  statutes  which  continue  to  provide 
exemptions for certain types of the debtor's property. 

he court system does not at this time provide special forms or instructions for this type of 

execution procedure.
