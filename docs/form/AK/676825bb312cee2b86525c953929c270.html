Introduction 
This pamphlet summarizes the penalties for violating several Alaska statutes relating to the operation 
of motor vehicles and commercial  motor vehicles while under the influence of  an alcoholic 
beverage,  inhalant, or controlled substance.  It is not a complete statement of  the  law and is not 
binding legal authority.  An attorney should be consulted  for comprehensive legal advice.  The 
following Alaska statutes are  discussed: 

DUI 
 

Operating a vehicle, aircraft, or watercraft while under the 
influence  of  an alcoholic beverage, inhalant, or  controlled substance.   

AS 28.35.030 

UI-CMV  Operating a commercial motor vehicle while under the 

AS 28.33.030 

influence of an alcoholic beverage, inhalant, or controlled substance.   

efusal 

Refusal to submit to a chemical test. 

AS 28.35.032 

efusal-CMV  Implied consent for operators of commercial motor vehicles. 

AS 28.33.031 

WLR 

Driving while license cancelled, suspended, revoked, or in 
violation of  a limitation.  

AS 28.15.291 
 

WLR - 
Commercial 

Driving a commercial motor vehicle without being lawfully licensed.  AS 28.33.150 

DUI and Refusal charges may be either misdemeanors or felonies, depending on the defendant's 
prior record.  For a defendant with no prior convictions, first and second offenses are 
misdemeanors, charged by complaint and tried before a six-person jury in district court.  For a 
defendant with two or more prior convictions for DUI, Refusal, or DUI-CMV (in any combination, 
within ten years and since January 1, 1996) a third DUI or Refusal is a felony, charged by grand jury 
indictment and tried in superior court by a jury of twelve. 

UI, Refusal, and DUI-CMV have mandatory minimum penalties that  increase according to the 
number of times the defendant has been convicted of  DUI, Refusal, or DUI-CMV.  Convictions 
from other jurisdictions may be counted as prior convictions for sentencing under Alaska state law. 

Convictions for DUI, Refusal, and DUI-CMV that arise out of  one  incident are counted as one 
prior conviction when determining the  number of prior convictions.)

Penalties for Misdemeanor Offenses 
For every DUI, DUI-CMV, or Refusal conviction, the court will impose a combination of  mandatory 
and discretionary penalties.  The jail sentence,  the fine, the period of  license revocation, and the cost 
of  imprisonment  all increase according to the number of  prior convictions. 

 MISDEMEANOR  SENTENCE MUST  INCLUDE: 

•  A jail or monitoring sentence ranging from a mandatory minimum of  72 hours (first  offense) to a 

mandatory minimum of  360 days (sixth or subsequent non-felony offense).   

o  For first DUI or first Refusal, depending on when your offense occurred, you may 
either be required to serve by electronic monitoring or the DOC probation office 
staff will decide how you serve your time (e.g., at a community residential center or 
other appropriate place).  Your judgment will tell you how to report after sentencing.    

o  For DWLR, the minimum is 10 days with 10 days suspended if the revocation was 

for a DUI or Refusal.  If you have a prior DWLR where the revocation was for DUI 
or Refusal, the minimum is 10 days with none suspended.  DWLR is an infraction if 
the revocation was for anything other than a DUI or Refusal. 

•  A fine ranging from a mandatory minimum of  $1,500 (first offense) to a mandatory minimum of 

$7,000 (sixth or subsequent offense); 

•  Revocation of  the driver’s license or privilege to obtain a license for 90 days or more unless the 

offense occurred in a watercraft (for some offenses, a limited license may be available during part 
of  the  revocation if  certain criteria are met); 

•  For violations involving alcohol or intoxicating liquor, an order requiring use of  an ignition 

interlock device after the privilege to  drive is regained (except in certain communities not on the 
state road  system); 

•  Disqualification (prohibition from operating a commercial vehicle, no  limited license allowed) if 

the offense was committed in a commercial  vehicle; 

•  An order to submit to drug and alcohol evaluation and complete any  treatment program required 

by the evaluating agency; 

•  An order to pay certain surcharges, and the cost of  emergency  response services if any were 

required following a motor vehicle accident related to the offense; and 

•  An order to pay the cost of  imprisonment.  For first DUI or first Refusal when the offense 
occurred before 7/9/2019, the cost is $66 for the first three days plus $14 per day for any 
additional days ordered.  If the offense occurred on or after 7/9/2019, then the cost is $330.  
 

A MISDEMEANOR SENTENCE MAY ALSO INCLUDE: 
•  An order to pay for damage caused as a result of  the offense; 
•  An order to complete an approved driver improvement course; 
•  An order to perform community work service; 
•  A term of probation and requirement to comply with probation  conditions; 
•  An order to forfeit the vehicle, aircraft, or watercraft; and 
•  An order to take a prescription medication that discourages the  consumption of alcohol.

Penalties for Felony Offenses 
Depending on when the prior offenses occurred, a third or subsequent  DUI or Refusal may be a 
felony, and result in a higher mandatory  minimum jail sentence, fine, and other penalties. 

 FELONY SENTENCE MUST INCLUDE: 

•  A jail sentence ranging from a mandatory minimum of  120 days (third offense) to a mandatory 

minimum of  360 days (fifth or  subsequent offense); 

•  A mandatory minimum fine of  $10,000; 
•  Permanent revocation of  the driver’s license, and permanent loss  of  the privilege to drive or 

privilege to get a license (subject to restoration of  license after a minimum of  10 years and only if 
certain  other conditions are met); 

•  Forfeiture of  the vehicle, watercraft, or aircraft used in the incident; 
•  Revocation of  registrations of  all vehicles in your name; 
•  For violations involving alcohol or intoxicating liquor, an order  requiring use of  an ignition 
interlock device for a mandatory  minimum of  60 months if the privilege to drive is regained 
(except in  certain communities not on the state road system); 

•  Disqualification for life from operating commercial vehicles if  the  incident was committed in a 

•  An order to submit to drug and alcohol evaluation, and complete any  treatment program(s) 

•  An order to pay certain surcharges, and the cost of  emergency  response services if any were 

commercial vehicle;  

required by the evaluating agency; and 

required after the incident. 

 FELONY SENTENCE MAY ALSO INCLUDE: 
•  An order to pay for damage caused as a result of  the offense; 
•  An order to perform community work service; 
•  An order to take prescription medications that discourage the  consumption of  alcohol; and 
•  A term of probation and a requirement to comply with probation conditions. 

 

Administrative License Revocation 
The statutes require that defendants whose licenses are revoked by the court face additional 
administrative license revocation by the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV).  The court revocation 
may be concurrent with (at the same time as) or consecutive to (in addition to) the DMV revocation. 

f a driver fails a chemical test (has a test result of 0.08% or greater, or 0.04% or greater while 
operating a commercial vehicle) or  refuses to take a chemical test, the law enforcement officer will 
seize the  driver’s license and give the driver a “Notice and Order of Revocation.” That notice 
informs the driver that the driver’s license or privilege to drive will be revoked by DMV on the 
eighth day following the  arrest.  The notice serves as a temporary license for seven days and 
describes how to request an administrative review of the revocation. (If the person was operating a 
commercial motor vehicle, they will be ordered out of  service  for  24  hours.) 

 request for an administrative review must be made in writing within  seven days after the driver 

receives the notice.  The driver may write a  letter or use a form obtainable from DMV at 
http://doa.alaska.gov/dmv/forms/pdfs/447.pdf.  The request for a hearing should be mailed or 
delivered to DMV at Division of Motor Vehicles, ATTN: Anchorage Driver Services, 3901 Old 
Seward Hwy., Suite 101, Anchorage, AK  99503.  When a request is received, DMV will issue a

temporary license, which is valid until the date of  the administrative hearing.  If the driver is 
dissatisfied with the result of the DMV hearing, the driver may file an appeal in superior court. A 
booklet entitled Appellant Instructions-Appeal to Superior Court from Administrative 
Revocation of Driver’s License under Alaska Statute 28.15.165 (AP-220) is available from the 
court.

Limited License Privileges 
The court may grant limited license privileges to enable a misdemeanor DUI defendant  to drive in 
order to earn a livelihood if  the court determines that the  defendant may drive without excessive risk 
or danger to the public.  The  availability and terms of  a limited license will vary depending on the 
defendant’s criminal record, driving record, and treatment history. 

he court may also grant limited license privileges to a felony DUI defendant if the court determines 

that the defendant successfully completed Wellness or Therapeutic Court (or the equivalent in an 
area where those programs are not available).  Wellness or Therapeutic Court is available in 
Anchorage, Bethel, Fairbanks, Juneau, Kenai, and Palmer.  Use court form CR-742 for a verification 
of eligibility.  In order to use this form, you must have successfully completed Wellness or 
Therapeutic Court with the Alaska Court System.  If you are in an area where Wellness or 
Therapeutic Court is not available, use court form CR-741 instead. 

f the defendant’s license was also suspended by DMV, the defendant must also obtain a limited 
license from DMV.  Requests for limited licenses from DMV are made by paying a non-refundable 
$100 fee, and completing an application form available at DMV offices and online at 
http://doa.alaska.gov/dmv/akol/limited_license.htm.  The DMV requires Financial Responsibility 
Filing (SR-22 insurance filing form); installation of  an approved ignition interlock device; and 
verification that the defendant met the alcohol education and  rehabilitation treatment program 
requirements.  If  DMV grants a limited license, the defendant may submit the same limited license 
application  form to the court. 

einstatement of  Driver’s License 

At the end of  any period of  revocation,  a  driver  must  apply  for  a  new  license at  DMV.  The 
original license that was surrendered will not be returned.  Before a new license will be issued, the 
driver must meet DMV requirements.  See http://doa.alaska.gov/dmv/akol/reinstate.htm.  A  driver 
who  was  granted  a  limited  license  must  also apply for a new license. 

ommercial DUI (DUI-CMV) 

The crime of  operating a commercial motor vehicle under the influence  (DUI-CMV) is committed 
when a defendant who is under the influence  of alcohol, inhalant, or any controlled substance 
operates a commercial  motor vehicle, or when a defendant who has a blood alcohol level of 0.04% 
or greater operates a commercial motor vehicle.  “Commercial  motor vehicle” is defined in 
AS 28.90.990.  A defendant who operates a commercial motor vehicle under the influence of  alcohol, 
inhalants,  or drugs may also be charged with non-commercial DUI and Refusal in  connection with 
the same incident. 

 DUI-CMV conviction will result in penalties identical to DUI plus  disqualification from driving 

a commercial motor vehicle for at least one  year (first offense) or for life (subsequent offenses). 

isqualification is required when non-commercial DUI and Refusal offenses are committed in 
commercial vehicles, and for other offenses (such as leaving the scene, failing to file an accident 
report, felonies facilitated by the use of a commercial vehicle, driving in violation of service orders, 
and serious traffic violations - see AS 28.33.140.)

Penalties for driving while license revoked, cancelled, 
suspended, or in violation of  a limited license 
Driving while a license is revoked, cancelled, or suspended for a DUI or Refusal is a Class A 
misdemeanor, with a minimum of 10 days with 10 days suspended if the revocation was for the first 
DWLR, or 10 days with none suspended if it is the second or subsequent DWLR.  The maximum 
fine is $25,000.  

n addition, if a defendant is convicted of driving during a period of license revocation, DMV will 
suspend the registration of every vehicle registered in that defendant's name until the defendant 
provides proof of financial responsibility for each vehicle. 

enalties for driving a commercial motor vehicle without 

being lawfully licensed 
Driving a commercial motor vehicle during a period of  license  revocation, driving in violation of  a 
limited license, and driving during a  period of disqualification (see AS 28.33.150) are Class A 
misdemeanors  with a maximum penalty of  up to one year in jail and a $25,000 fine.  The court must 
impose the following minimum penalties upon conviction:  
 

If the defendant has not been previously convicted of 
(a) driving a commercial vehicle without be lawfully 
licensed, (b) driving while license revoked/suspended, 
or (c) driving in violation of a limited license: 

  20 days in jail (10 suspended) 

  80 hours of community work service  

  Additional 90 day license revocation 

If defendant has been convicted during the preceding 
10 years of (a) driving a commercial motor vehicle 
without being lawfully licensed, (b) driving while 
license revoked/suspended, or (c) driving in violation 
of a limited license: 

 

  60 days in jail  

  $1000 fine 

  Additional 90 day license revocation

  P

It is not possible for the court to advise defendants about all the  consequences that a conviction for 
DUI, Refusal, or DUI-CMV may have in addition to the sentence imposed by the court.  Common 
consequences include: 
•  Federal Aviation Administration regulations require all FAA licensed pilots to report “motor 

vehicle actions” to the FAA within 60 days.  Motor vehicle actions such as DUI convictions and 
license  revocations may be the basis for suspension or revocation of  a pilot’s  license. 

•  DMV may classify a driver as a “habitual user of  alcohol” and refuse  to license the driver even 
after the revocation period has ended, until  the driver provides proof  that the substance abuse 
problem has been  under control for one year. 

•  Motor vehicle insurance rates may increase. 
• 
Information about convictions may be requested by employers or on  job applications. 
•  Convictions may affect a defendant’s ability to obtain or renew a  pilot’s license, or another 

occupational license. 

•  Convictions may affect eligibility for military service or U.S.  citizenship. 
•  Convictions may prevent entry into Canada or other foreign  countries.
