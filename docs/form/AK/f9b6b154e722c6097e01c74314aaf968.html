The Landlord and Tenant Act: what it means to you 
When a landlord and tenant get along well, things are better all around. Dealing with unhappy tenants is a 
lot of trouble for a landlord, and few tenants want the inconvenience and expense of moving simply 
because they cannot get along with their landlords. 

et, landlords and tenants frequently have problems. Sometimes, landlords do not make repairs or 
unfairly keep back security deposits. Sometimes, tenants damage property or refuse to pay the rent. 

his booklet briefly explains your responsibilities as a landlord or a tenant under the Uniform Residential 
Landlord and Tenant Act (AS 34.03.010 et seq., the “Landlord and Tenant Act”). It explains what a tenant 
needs to know when the tenant is: 

  Moving in: ........................... pages 4 - 11 
  Living there: ........................ pages 11 - 19 
  Moving out: ......................... pages 20 - 31 

Sample forms, such as notices to quit, etc., begin on page 32. 

he Landlord and Tenant Act covers rental of a residence, such as an apartment, a mobile home, or a 

house. It does not apply to rooming houses, hotels or motels, temporary housing at a shelter or 
supportive housing program, or any type of commercial property.1  

enants who receive a government housing subsidy or live in a government housing project may have 

rights in addition to those provided by state law. This pamphlet does not cover those issues.  

uch tenants should check their lease agreements and may also wish to consult with the Alaska Housing 

Finance Corporation or an attorney for specific advice. 

efinitions 

Several important terms are used in this booklet. This is what some of them mean: 
  Dwelling unit, property or premises: the place that is rented, which could be a house, apartment, 

condo, mobile home, or mobile home park space.  

  Landlord: the property owner or the owner’s agent, which could include either a licensed property 

manager or a resident manager. 

  Property manager: an individual licensed to practice real estate in Alaska who works on behalf of 

the property owner to rent, manage and safeguard a property. 

  Resident manager: an individual who resides on the property and manages it on behalf of the 

property owner or the licensed property manager. 
  Tenant: any of the people who rent the dwelling. 
  Damages: money claimed by, or ordered to be paid to, a person as compensation for loss or injury. It 

may mean the amount claimed by the landlord from the tenant’s security deposit based on the 
damages the landlord has incurred by reason of the tenant’s failure to comply with the obligations 
imposed under the Landlord and Tenant Act. Or it may mean the monetary compensation that a 
person wins in a lawsuit, such as the value of lost rent or the cost of repairing property damage (to a 
landlord), or the value of housing or utility services not provided (to a tenant). 

  Security deposit: payment to a landlord or property manager by a tenant to ensure that the tenant 
will pay the rent due and will maintain the property and will not damage it. Security deposits are held 
in trust by the owner or manager until the tenant moves out, and are then returned or applied to pay 
for damages and/or delinquent rent with an accounting to the tenant. 

  Rental agreement: means all agreements, written or oral, and valid rules and regulations adopted by 

the landlord, making up the terms and conditions for the use of the dwelling unit. 

  Lease: a contract which conveys the right to use and occupy property for a certain specified period of 
time in exchange for consideration, usually rent. Precise legal definition of many of the terms used in 
the Landlord and Tenant Act may be found at AS 34.03.360.

MOVING IN 

et a written agreement: 

Before a tenant moves in, the landlord and tenant must come to an agreement. It may be verbal or 
written, but written is best. Without written proof, even two honest people can later disagree on what was 
actually said. The written agreement may be called a “Rental Agreement,” a “Tenant Agreement,” or a 
“Lease.” 

he agreement should include: 

the name and address of the person authorized to manage the premises; 

the name and address of an owner of the premises, or a person authorized to act as an agent of the 
owner, for the purpose of service of process and receiving notices and demands from the tenant or 
the owner’s agent; 

 

the name and address of the tenant(s);2  

  how many tenants and pets are to occupy the unit; 

  who holds the deposit; 

reasons the deposit or a portion of it may be retained by the landlord; 

the amount to be paid for rent and deposits; 

  when, where, and how the rent is to be paid; 

  when the rent is considered delinquent, and what the penalty will be for late payment; 

  whether this is a month-to-month tenancy or a lease with a definite contract period; 

  who pays for utilities and what services are provided; 

list of prohibited equipment (snowmobiles, musical equipment, motorcycles, etc.); 

list of landlord and tenant repair and maintenance duties and who pays for them; 

rules on subleasing or assignment of the property; 

  a premises condition statement and contents inventory; 

  disclosure of lead-based paint as applicable for units built prior to 1978 (as required by the federal 

Environmental Protection Act); and 

  any additional rules, covenants and regulations in place.

Late charges 
The Landlord and Tenant Act does not state whether landlords may assess late charges when the rent is 
late, or NSF fees when a check is returned for insufficient funds. It may be all right for the rental 
agreement to specify a small flat-rate late charge or NSF fee that reasonably approximates the landlord’s 
actual costs caused by the tenant’s failure to pay rent on time or writing a bad check. It may also be all 
right for the rental agreement to specify a reasonable percentage-per-day late charge. Such a charge is 
limited by the state usury law to an annual interest rate of a maximum of five percentage points above the 
Federal Reserve discount rate, or if no precise rate is specified, 10.5%.3 Remember, no automatic late 
charge or NSF fee is legally enforceable, unless it has been agreed upon beforehand. 

esolving disputes 

A landlord and tenant can agree to mediation or binding arbitration to resolve disputes between them. If 
both parties want to mediate or arbitrate disputes, they should include in the rental agreement (or in an 
addendum to it) specific details of the types of disputes to be resolved in this way and the procedures to 
be followed.4 

nderstanding the agreement 

Rental agreements are normally prepared by the landlord or the landlord’s agent. It is very important that 
tenants make sure they understand all the terms of the agreement. Tenants should ask for an explanation 
of any section they do not understand, before signing the agreement. 

hat to watch out for: 

Rental agreements cannot: 

require the tenant or the landlord to waive any legal rights under the Act,5 

  permit the landlord to get an “automatic” court judgment against the tenant (called a “confession of 

judgment”),6  

require the tenant to agree to pay the landlord’s attorney fees,7 

limit the liability of landlords or tenants when either has failed to meet their responsibilities,8 

  make the tenant liable for rent even if the landlord fails to maintain the premises as required by law, 9 or 

  allow the landlord to take the tenant’s personal belongings.10

Standard form agreements 
Some standard form rental agreements have been written to conform to the laws of other states, or are 
based on older versions of Alaska law. These forms may need to be changed before signing them. In 
addition to the legal provisions already listed, any of the following statements should be removed from the 
agreement before signing it: 

  agreement to let the landlord come into the dwelling whenever the landlord wants, 

  agreement to immediate eviction for nonpayment of rent, 

  agreement that the tenant will make all repairs, 

 

release of the landlord from liability for accidents due to the landlord’s neglect, 

  giving up of the tenant’s right to the return of the deposit, or 

  grant of a power of attorney to the landlord by the tenant, or to the tenant by the landlord. 

llegal provisions in the contract 
To remove illegal wording, draw a line in ink through any provision that is not legally binding. Both the 
landlord and tenant should initial the agreement next to each item that has been removed.  

llegal provisions in an agreement are not enforceable against the tenant, even if both parties sign. 

pecial rules for mobile home rentals 

Absent very specific exceptions, agreements between mobile home park operators and mobile home park 
tenants may not: 

  prohibit the tenant from selling the tenant’s mobile home, 

require the mobile home tenant to provide permanent improvements to park property, 

require a fee to let the tenant sell or transfer the mobile home, or 

require a fee to let the tenant set up or move a mobile home into or out of the park.11 

obile home park operators must give tenants a list of all capital improvements that will be required (such 

as skirting, utility hook-ups, and tie downs) before the tenant moves into the park.12 Park operators may 
specify the type of equipment required, but cannot require that it be purchased from a particular supplier 
or company.13 

nsigned or undelivered agreements 

Once the agreement has been carefully reviewed, both parties should sign it. The landlord must give the 
tenant a copy.  

f the landlord and the tenant agree to a rental agreement, and the landlord signs and delivers the 
agreement to the tenant but the tenant doesn’t sign it, the legal provisions of the agreement are 
nonetheless binding if the tenant moves in and begins paying rent. Likewise, if the tenant signs and 
delivers the agreement to the landlord but the landlord doesn’t sign it, the rental agreement is binding if 
the landlord accepts payment of rent without reservation from the tenant.14

What is a lease? 
A lease is a rental agreement that specifies how long the tenant will stay in the property. If there is a 
lease, the landlord cannot raise the rent or evict the tenant during the period of the lease, unless the 
tenant breaks the terms of the lease or the lease agreement provides for the increases.  

f the tenant decides to move during the term of the lease, the tenant is usually still responsible for the 
rent for the rest of the lease period, unless the dwelling can be subleased or re-rented earlier. See 
sections on Moving Prior to End of a Lease and Subleasing, pgs. 18-19.  

here may be times, however, when the tenant may quit the lease and not be responsible for the rent for 

the remainder of the lease. See section on Tenant Remedies, pgs. 13-14. 

hat is a security deposit? 

Many landlords demand a security deposit before a tenant moves in. This deposit protects the landlord 
from financial loss if the tenant fails to pay the rent, causes damage to the property, or does not clean up 
properly when the tenant leaves.  

Except for units renting for more than $2,000 per month, security deposits and prepaid rents may not total 
more than two months’ rent.15 A landlord may require an additional deposit, of up to one month’s rent, 
from a tenant who will be keeping a pet that is not a service animal.16   

ometimes a landlord asks for a nonrefundable application fee to place a prospective tenant on a waiting 

list for an apartment. If an application fee covers the landlord’s actual, reasonable costs for services 
performed (such as checking the applicant’s credit history), it is probably lawful.  

owever, it is NOT lawful to charge a fee that becomes the security deposit if the tenant moves in, but is 

forfeited if the tenant decides not to take the unit. At most, such a tenant would be responsible for rent 
during the time it takes the landlord to find a replacement tenant, and for the actual costs (such as 
newspaper ads) of finding one. 

here are deposits kept? 

Deposits and prepaid rent must be deposited by the landlord or the property manager in a trust account in 
a bank or savings and loan association, or with a licensed escrow agent.17 (Exceptions could be made in 
rural Alaska, if there is no bank in town and it would be impractical to bank the money). A trust account 
can be any separate savings or checking account labeled “trust account” and used only for deposits and 
prepaid rents. A receipt should be written whenever the tenant pays a deposit or prepays rent. The 
landlord cannot mix prepaid rent and security deposit funds with other money. Although a landlord can 
keep the security deposits and prepaid rents from several tenants in a single account, each tenant’s funds 
are to be accounted for separately, and may not be refunded to another tenant, or applied to another 
tenant’s rent or damage obligations.18 

andlords are required to provide tenants with the terms and conditions under which prepaid rents or 
deposits (or any portion of those monies) might be withheld by the landlord. The additional “pet deposit” 
noted above is to be accounted for separately from the regular security deposit or prepaid rent, and can 
be applied only to the amount of damage directly related to the pet.19

Can deposits earn interest? 
The landlord/tenant law does not require that the trust account earn interest, but if the tenant’s deposit 
does earn interest, the tenant is entitled to the interest under general trust law principles, unless both 
parties have agreed otherwise. It is a good idea to specify in the rental agreement whether the deposit will 
earn interest, and if so, who gets the interest.  

f the property is managed by a licensed property manager, the interest on the tenant’s money in the trust 
account must go to the tenant, under the terms of the real estate license law, unless the tenant agrees in 
writing that the interest may go to the property owner. The property manager may not keep the interest.20 

hen there’s a new owner. . . 

When rental housing is sold, a new owner is responsible for refunding any security deposits and prepaid 
rents that may be owed to the tenants who move out after the ownership is transferred.21 Therefore, a 
buyer of rental property should make sure that the previous owner transfers all deposits and prepaid rents 
along with the property. If the previous owner makes a proper transfer of these funds and notifies the 
tenants of the sale of the dwelling unit, the previous owner is relieved of further responsibility. If not, the 
previous owner will still be responsible to the tenants for deposits and prepaid rents, even though the new 
owner is also responsible.22  

hen the property is sold at a foreclosure sale because the landlord has defaulted on the landlord’s 
mortgage payments, the buyer (usually the lender) often treats the tenancy as terminated, and tries to 
disclaim responsibility for the tenant’s security deposit. Unless the landlord/seller has given the security 
deposits to the new owner, the landlord/seller remains liable for the security deposits.23 The issue of 
whether the buyer in a foreclosure sale is responsible for the tenants’ security deposits has not yet been 
decided by the courts. 

et a written inspection report 

An inspection report describes the condition of the property when the tenant moves in. It generally has 
two parts: 

  a “premises condition statement” describing the condition of the unit, and 
  a “contents inventory” itemizing any furnishings and describing their condition. 

rdinarily, the landlord prepares the draft premises condition statement, then the landlord and tenant go 
through the premises together, writing down any additional damaged areas (such as scratches or burns), 
and then both landlord and tenant sign and date the revised version and keep a copy. But if the landlord 
does not prepare it, the tenant should do so, sign it, keep a copy, and give the original to the landlord for 
signature. 

n accurate and thorough inspection report helps protect the interests of both landlords and tenants. 

Tenants, for example, can use it to prove that they were not responsible for damages that existed before 
they moved in. Landlords can also use it to establish when damage occurred. 

f the landlord is agreeing to make repairs or changes, the landlord and tenant should make another list 
showing which damages the landlord has agreed to repair or change, and the date the work should be 
done (a common limit is ten days). This list should be signed and dated by the landlord before move-in, 
and signed and dated by the tenant when the work has been completed. Again, everyone should keep a 
copy. 
  
If either landlord or tenant refuses to cooperate in completing the inspection report, that is not a good 
sign. Finding another place to live, or another tenant, before a conflict arises is much easier than trying to 
settle disagreements when the tenancy ends.

Living by the landlord’s rules 
Nearly every landlord has rules that tenants must live by.  

he law requires that the landlord show the tenant the rules and regulations before the tenant enters into 
the rental agreement, and that a copy of the rules be prominently posted on the premises where it can be 
seen by everyone living there.24 These rules should include homeowner association or community 
association rules or covenants.  

enants should read the rules carefully, and if they believe that they cannot live by the landlord’s rules, 

they should not rent the unit.  

he rules must be reasonable, must apply to all tenants equally, and must be clearly defined. 

nforcing the rules 

The landlord’s rules may be enforced only if their purpose is to: 

  promote the convenience, safety, health or welfare of the tenants, 

  preserve the landlord’s property from abuse, or  

  make a fair distribution of services and facilities. 

he landlord cannot make rules that allow the landlord to avoid the landlord’s obligations. Once the tenant 

has seen the rules and moved in, the tenant has agreed to abide by those rules. Failure to do so could 
mean an eviction. (See section on Moving out.) 

hanging the rules 

If the tenant has a lease, the rules may not be changed during the term of the lease, if the changes would 
substantially modify the lease agreement. For example, the landlord cannot decide during the term of a 
lease that the landlord will no longer allow pets on the premises.  

f the tenancy is month-to-month, the landlord may make such changes, but only after giving the tenant 
written notice at least 30 days before the rental due date when the rule changes will take effect. Tenants 
who do not wish to accept the rule changes may give a 30-day written notice before the rental due date 
and move out. 

f circumstances change 
Once the tenant and the landlord make a rental agreement, the tenant may NOT have the right to get 
back full deposits or prepaid rent if the tenant decides not to move in.  

n a month-to-month tenancy, the tenant is responsible for as much as one month’s rent, or prorated rent 
on a day-to-day basis until someone else rents the unit, whichever is less. The landlord must make a 
reasonable effort to re-rent the unit as soon as possible, at a fair rental price.25  

f the tenant refuses to move in because the landlord misrepresented the condition of the unit, the tenant 
may owe nothing, and may be entitled to a full refund of the deposit and prepaid rent.  

f the premises are not ready on the first day of the rental term per the rental agreement or the landlord 
refuses to allow the tenants to move in, the tenants may cancel the agreement, or they may ask a court to 
order the landlord to live up to the agreement.26

Tenants may also sue the landlord and any person wrongfully living there for damages. If the landlord’s 
refusal to allow the tenants to move in is willful and in bad faith, the tenants may sue for 1-1/2 times the 
actual damages.27

 

hen is discrimination illegal? 

  W

It is illegal under both state and federal law for landlords to refuse to rent to someone because of sex, 
race, religion, national origin, color, physical or mental disability, or pregnancy. Under state law it is also 
illegal to refuse to rent to someone because of marital status or change in marital status.28 A landlord may 
not even make an inquiry regarding the tenant’s status in any of these areas.29  

t is a violation of federal law to refuse to rent on the basis of a disabling disease which is not readily 
communicable, such as cancer or AIDS, or because a tenant has children. Federal fair housing laws may 
not apply to single family homes or two-, three- or four-family structures where the owner occupies one 
unit. State laws, however, apply to all residential rental units.  

n the Municipality of Anchorage, it is illegal to refuse to rent to someone because of age.30 Other 
communities may have similar specific ordinances. Check with your local Equal Rights Commission 
regarding local requirements.  

ach landlord may choose whether the landlord wishes to rent to smokers. Neither state nor federal law 

makes smokers a protected class.  

t is unlikely that a landlord will openly refuse to rent to someone for an illegal reason. Frequently, a 
tenant may suspect there is an illegal reason behind some seemingly legal landlord practices.  

hese are some indications that a landlord may be practicing discrimination: 

the apartment the tenant called about is suddenly “already taken” when the landlord sees the tenant, 

  a unit the landlord said was rented remains vacant, 

the rent or deposit quoted is much higher than the advertised or charged for similar units, 

rules are different for one tenant than for others in the same apartment building, 

  a real estate broker or agent does not refer a tenant to a rental listing that fits the tenant’s needs, or 

  an advertisement indicates a preference for a certain race, color, religion, sex, age, marital status or 

national origin.

LIVING IN A RENTAL PROPERTY 

he landlord’s responsibilities 

The law requires that the landlord or the landlord’s agent must: 

  give the tenant a copy of any written rental agreement; 

  abide by the lawful terms of the agreement; 

 

keep the tenant informed of any change in the landlord’s or the landlord’s agent’s address; 

  make sure the premises are ready for the tenant when the rental agreement takes effect; 

  ensure that the tenant’s enjoyment of the premises is not disturbed; 

  maintain a fit premises (see next section titled “Property Maintenance”); 

  give adequate notice of a rent increase;  

  give the required notice before demanding that a tenant move out; and 

return the tenant’s security deposit and/or prepaid rent when the tenant moves out and/or give a 
complete written accounting of money held for accrued rent, damages and the cost of repair within 
the time limit required by law. 

roperty Maintenance 

he Landlord and Tenant Act provides that the landlord must:31

 

make all repairs and do whatever is necessary to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable 
condition; 

keep all common areas of the premises in a clean and safe condition;32

 

maintain in good and safe working order and condition all electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, 
ventilating, air-conditioning, kitchen, and other facilities and appliances, including elevators, 
supplied or required to be supplied by the landlord;

provide and maintain appropriate receptacles and conveniences for the removal of ashes,

their removal; 

supply running water and reasonable amounts of hot water and heat at all times, insofar as 
energy conditions permit, with exceptions as noted in the “Varying landlord duties” below. 

if requested by the tenant, provide and maintain locks and furnish keys reasonably adequate to 
ensure safety to the tenant’s person and property; and 

7) 

provide smoke and carbon monoxide detection devices as required under AS 18.70.095. 

xamples of typical property maintenance duties which may fall under these statutory provisions include 

the landlord’s duty to maintain: 

  doors, windows, roof, floors, walls and ceilings, ensuring that they do not leak or have holes; 

  plumbing that works, does not leak, and provides hot and cold water at reasonable water pressure; 

  a working, safe stove and oven; 

  a reliable heating system which provides adequate heat to all rooms; 

  a safe electrical wiring system (with no loose or exposed wires, sockets that do not spark and 

adequate circuit breakers); 

  windows or fans that provide fresh air; 

  enough garbage cans or dumpsters to provide an adequate and safe trash removal service; 

  extermination service if roaches, rats, mice or other pests infest the building, apartment or property; 

  proper maintenance of any vacuum cleaners, washing machines, dishwashers, etc., supplied by the 

landlord (when not abused or broken by the tenant); and 

  properly working smoke and carbon monoxide detection devices.33 

arying Landlord duties 

The landlord’s duty to supply running water, hot water and heat can be changed if: 

)  heat and hot water are supplied by a direct public utility connection through an installation that, due to 

the building’s construction, is under the exclusive control of the tenant; or  

2)  there is no well or water provided by a direct public utility connection and the rental agreement 
specifically states that the tenant is waiving the landlord’s duty to supply running water or hot water.34 

f the rental is a single family residence located in an undeveloped rural area, or where public sewer or 
water service has never been connected, and where no private system for running water, hot water, 
sewage, or sanitary facilities was in place at the start of the tenancy, the landlord is not liable for failing to 
provide those services.35

13 

If the rental is a one- or two-family residence, wherever located, the landlord and tenant can agree in 
writing that the tenant perform the landlord’s duties for waste removal, running water, hot water, heat, 
locks and keys, and provision of fire and carbon monoxide detection devices. The agreement can also 
provide that the tenant perform specified repairs, maintenance tasks, alterations, and remodeling (except 
for elevators). In rentals where the rent exceeds $2000 per month, the duty-shifting agreement can also 
cover electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, air-conditioning kitchen, and other facilities and 
appliances. All such agreements have to be entered into in good faith, and not for the purpose of evading 
the obligations of the landlord.36 

f the rental is a two-family residence, the above agreements are permissible, but must be in a writing 
separate from the lease, must be supported by adequate consideration, and cannot diminish or affect the 
obligation of the landlord to any other tenant. Also, the landlord may not treat performance of the tenant’s 
duties under that separate agreement as a condition of the rental agreement itself.37 

f the rental is larger than a two-family unit, duty-shifting agreements are more limited. The landlord and 
tenant can agree that the tenant is to perform specified repairs, maintenance tasks, alterations, or 
remodeling. Like the agreements for two-family residences, the agreement must be in good faith, must 
not be for the purpose of evading the duties of the landlord, must be in a separate writing, must be 
supported by adequate consideration, and the tenant’s duties cannot be treated as a condition of the 
rental agreement itself.38 

enant remedies 

If the landlord does not meet the landlord’s responsibilities, the law provides remedies for the tenant. The 
type of remedies available depends on the type of noncompliance by the landlord. 

Remedies for Landlord’s noncompliance in general 
1)  The tenant may move.39 If there is material noncompliance by the landlord with the rental agreement 
or a noncompliance with the Landlord and Tenant Act which materially affect health and safety the tenant 
may move. The tenant must first give the landlord written notice describing the problem and stating that 
if the problem is not fixed in 10 days from receipt of the notice, the tenant will move in 20 days. If the 
problem is fixed within 10 days the tenancy does not terminate. If the tenant still wants to move, a regular 
30-day notice is required (in a month-to-month tenancy). 

f the tenant notified the landlord in writing of a problem and the landlord fixed it within the time allowed, 
but the landlord allows substantially the same problem to occur again within six months, the tenant may 
terminate the agreement with a ten-day written notice without allowing the landlord an opportunity to fix 
the problem. The notice must specify the problem and the date of termination of the tenancy.  

f the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord must return all prepaid rent or security deposits 
recoverable by the tenant. Tenants may not terminate a rental agreement for problems they themselves 
have caused. 

)  The tenant may obtain damages or injunctive relief.40 A tenant may sue in court for damages or obtain 
injunctive relief for any noncompliance by the landlord with the rental agreement or for certain violations 
of the Landlord and Tenant Act. If the total amount at issue is less than $10,000 the tenant may sue for 
damages in small claims court. For larger claims, or requests for injunctive relief, the tenant should see an 
attorney.

Remedies for Landlord’s failure to supply essential services 
If the landlord deliberately or negligently fails to supply an essential service (such as heat, water, sewer, 
electricity or plumbing), the tenant has several other alternative remedies. Prior to taking one of the 
remedies a tenant must give the landlord a written notice stating the problem and the remedy the tenant 
plans to take.  

)  The tenant may make repairs and deduct the cost from rent. Once written notice is given to the 

landlord stating that the tenant plans to do so the tenant may get the problem fixed and deduct the actual 
and reasonable expenses from the next month’s rent.41 (If the repair is very expensive, it is a good idea to 
consult with an attorney before taking this step.) The  tenant should retain receipts for all costs, and 
submit them to the landlord for rent credit. 

)  The tenant may procure reasonable substitute housing. The tenant can give the landlord written 
notice that the tenant is moving into reasonable substitute housing. The tenant is then excused from 
paying rent until the problem is cured.  

f the tenant has to pay more than the tenant’s regular rent to secure housing during this time, the tenant 
can charge the landlord for the difference.42 

)  The tenant may obtain damages. In some cases, when the problem is really serious, it may reduce the 
value of the dwelling. If this happens, the tenant may sue, or in an action by the landlord for possession or 
rent, the tenant may counterclaim, to recover damages against the landlord based on the diminution in 
the fair rental value of the dwelling.43 

ousing codes 

The primary purpose of housing codes is to protect the health and safety of the people who live in houses 
and apartments.  

 minimum standard of maintenance is set, making the landlord (not the tenant) responsible for keeping 

rental property in decent shape. (See: “The landlord’s responsibilities”, pg. 11.)  

he law protects tenants who exercise their rights to report code violations. If they call to complain and 
ask for an inspection, the landlord cannot take revenge by harassing them (i.e. threatening eviction).44  

laska has a statewide fire code, but does not have a statewide housing code. Many communities do 

have local codes. To learn more about housing codes in your community, or to report housing code 
violations or substandard living conditions, contact your local city, municipal, or borough government. 

enant responsibilities 

he Landlord and Tenant Act provides that the tenant:45 

shall keep that part of the premises occupied and used by the tenant as clean and safe as the 
condition of the premises permit; 
shall dispose of all ashes, rubbish, garbage, and other waste from the dwelling unit in a clean and 
safe manner; 
shall keep all plumbing fixtures in the dwelling unit or used by the tenant as clean as their 
condition permits; 
shall use in a reasonable manner all electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, air 
conditioning, kitchen, and other facilities and appliances including elevators in the premises; 
may not deliberately or negligently destroy, deface, damage, impair, or remove a part of the 
premises or knowingly permit any person to do so;

shall maintain smoke and carbon monoxide detection devices as required under AS 18.70.095; 
may not, except in an emergency when the landlord cannot be contacted after reasonable effort 
to do so, change the locks on doors of the premises without first securing the written agreement 
of the landlord and, immediately after changing the locks, providing the landlord a set of keys to 
all doors for which locks have been changed; in an emergency, the tenant may change the locks 
and shall, within five days, provide the landlord a set of keys to all doors for which locks have 
been changed and written notice of the change; and 
may not unreasonably engage in conduct, or permit others on the premises to engage in conduct, 
that results in the imposition of a fee under a municipal ordinance adopted under AS 29.35.125  
(fees for police protective services). 

(10)  may not allow the number of individuals occupying the premises to exceed the number allowed 

by the rental agreement, by applicable law, or by a covenant limiting the landlord’s use of the 
premises.

  abide by the lawful terms of the rental agreement and the reasonable rules established by the landlord; 

  pay the rent on time;46  

  be considerate of other tenants; 

keep the premises clean and safe; 

remove snow and ice from leased premises (this does not include the common areas);47  

  dispose of garbage and other waste in a clean and safe manner; 

  prevent damage to the premises; 

replace or repair anything destroyed or damaged by accident or carelessness on the part of the 
tenant or the tenant’s guests; 

  make sure the unit’s smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are working by testing them periodically 

and changing the batteries as needed;48 

  give adequate notice before moving; 

  move out when the rental agreement ends; 

 

clear the premises of possessions when moving out; and 

 

leave the premises in substantially the same condition, except for normal wear and tear, as the 
condition of the premises when the tenant moved in.49 

he tenant must pay the rent each month as it becomes due. The landlord is not required to ask the 

tenant each month for the rent.50

will be collected at the dwelling unit.51

f the tenant rents monthly, the rent is due every month on the day of the month that the tenancy began, 
unless otherwise agreed.52 Thus, if the tenant moves in on the 8th, the rent is due on or before the 8th of 
every month, unless both parties agree to another rental due date, which is typically the 1st of the month. 

andlord remedies 

If tenants do not meet their responsibilities, the landlord can terminate the rental agreement by written 
notice and require that the tenants move. The written notice must be specific about the problem in 
question. (See: “Termination of tenancy,” pg. 23.)  

f the tenants are notified of a problem and remedy the problem within the time allowed, but the problem 
occurs again within six months, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement using a three- or five-
day written notice, depending on the type of problem. If this occurs the landlord does not need to give the 
tenant an opportunity to fix the problem. The notice must specify the problem and the date of termination 
(see page 27 for specific notice requirements).53

 

 lawsuit to evict a tenant is called a “Forcible Entry and Detainer Action”, or “FED”. A landlord who evicts 

a tenant may contact an attorney for representation, or landlords who are owners may elect to represent 
themselves. 

f the landlord who is an owner chooses to be self-represented, it is a good idea to contact the Alaska 
Court System for its booklet called “Eviction” (https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/civ-720.pdf; 
form number CIV-720).  This booklet describes in detail the procedure for evictions from residential 
property for failure to pay rent, but will also help landlords with evictions for other reasons, since the 
process is quite similar. 

f the landlord needs to get in . . . 
A landlord may enter the premises only to:54 

  make repairs or perform maintenance; 

supply necessary or agreed services; 

inspect for damages; 

show the premises to prospective buyers, renters, or contractors; or 

remove personal property belonging to the landlord that is not covered under the rental agreement. 

n these situations, the landlord MUST give the tenant 24 hours notice. The landlord must say what time 
the landlord is coming, and try to pick a time that is mutually convenient. The landlord may enter for these 
reasons only with the tenant’s consent and only at reasonable times. 

he only time a landlord may enter the premises without written permission is when: 

it is not possible to contact the tenant by ordinary means; 

the tenant has been gone from the property more than seven days without notice; or 

there is an emergency (such as smoke, water, or explosion).

Tenants CANNOT unreasonably refuse to allow the landlord to enter. If the tenant does so, the landlord 
can get a court order, or injunction, requiring that the tenant let the landlord in. The landlord may also sue 
for actual damages or one month’s rent, whichever is greater, or terminate the tenancy with a ten-day 
notice.55

 

he landlord CANNOT abuse the right to request entry, or use it to harass tenants.56 

hen a landlord abuses the landlord’s right to enter by coming in without the tenant’s permission or 
repeatedly without need, the tenant can ask a court for an injunction ordering the landlord to stop. The 
tenant may also sue for actual damages or one month’s rent, whichever is greater, plus court costs and 
attorney fees. If the tenant wishes to move because the landlord has abused the access privilege, a ten-
day written notice from tenant to landlord is required.57

 

he lowdown on locks 

Tenants can insist that the landlord maintain or replace the locks if the residence is not secure.58

 

enants may want to add an extra lock on their own to increase security. With the landlord’s permission, 
a tenant may add locks that can be used from the inside, such as chain bolts. If the tenant makes holes in 
the door or frame, the tenant must leave the lock in place when moving out. 

either a landlord nor a tenant may be locked out. If a landlord adds or changes locks, new keys must be 

given to the tenant right away.  

efore changing locks, the tenant must generally get the landlord’s written permission. However, in an 
emergency, when the landlord can’t be contacted first, the tenant can change locks, provided the tenant 
gives a new set of keys to the landlord within five days.59

 

an the landlord raise the rent? 

Unless there is a lease, the landlord is legally entitled to raise the rent by any amount. But the landlord 
must give the tenant at least 30 days notice before the increase takes effect on a month-to-month 
tenancy. 

enants then have two choices: 

they can agree to pay the rent, or 

they can move out. 

egally, a notice of rent increase is probably equivalent to a termination of the rental agreement at the old 

rate and an offer to rent the same unit at a higher rate.  

 landlord should, therefore, notify tenants of any rate increase at least 30 days before the increase goes 

into effect, and tenants who wish to leave rather than accept the increase should give the landlord a 
written 30-day notice of intent to terminate tenancy. 

enants who receive a housing subsidy or live in a federal or state housing project may have rights in 

addition to those provided by state law. For example, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD) or the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (AHFC) may control rent increases in 
housing where HUD has provided loan or rent guarantees to the owner. Contact the HUD office, your 
AHFC Public Housing case worker, an attorney, or if low income, Alaska Legal Services, if you have 
questions about HUD or AHFC rent controls.

Fire or casualty damage 
If the dwelling is substantially damaged by fire or other casualty (such as an earthquake or a flood), there 
are a couple of things the tenant can do, depending on the amount of damage to the dwelling. 

hen only a part of the unit is damaged and it is lawful for the tenant to continue to live there, the tenant 
should move out of the damaged part. The rent can be reduced to an amount that reflects the fair rental 
value of the undamaged part of the dwelling.60

 

f the tenant can no longer live in the place, the tenant can move out, notify the landlord, and stop paying 
rent. The rental agreement and responsibility to pay rent ends when the tenant moves.61

 

fter the tenant moves, the landlord must return any recoverable deposit and prepaid rent to the tenant. 

Rent paid for time the tenant did not live in the dwelling (counted from the day of the casualty and 
including the day of the casualty) must be returned to the tenant.62

 

ondemned dwellings 

Buildings inspected and found to be very unsafe may be condemned. The city or borough housing 
inspector will tell the landlord that the landlord must repair the problem or be taken to court. 

hen the problems are so serious that the inspector feels that the building is beyond repair, the inspector 

will order that it be torn down. 

f the building is condemned, tenants may come home one day and find a sign posted on the building 
stating that it is unsafe for anyone to live there. 

enants should immediately find out when the inspector and landlord expect them to move. They should 

also see an attorney before paying any more rent. 

oving prior to the end of a lease 

When a lease is signed, the tenant is promising to stay for a certain length of time. The tenant commits to 
paying the rent each month, whether or not the tenant is in the property. Unless the landlord signs a 
statement permitting it, the tenant CANNOT simply have someone else “take over” the rental unit. 

enerally, there are only two ways a tenant can get out of a lease without breaking the lease: 

if there is a material noncompliance by the landlord with the rental agreement or a noncompliance 
with AS 34.03.100 materially affecting health and safety, the tenant can move (after giving 20 days 
written notice), unless the landlord corrects the problem in ten days,63 or 

if the landlord agrees to allow the tenant to sublease the property (see next section). 

f the tenant decides to move during the term of the lease, the tenant is usually still responsible for the 
rent for the rest of the lease period, unless the dwelling can be rerented earlier. The landlord is 
responsible to make a good faith effort to re-rent the property, and may not charge the original tenant rent 
after the property is re-rented, or for any time during which the landlord does not make a reasonable, 
good faith effort to rent the property. 

f the landlord attempts to re-rent the property, the tenant may be responsible for rent while the property 
is vacant during the term of the lease.

Subleasing 
If a rental agreement requires the landlord’s consent to sublease, the tenant may obtain one or more 
persons who are willing to take over the lease. Each prospective occupant must make a signed written 
offer to the landlord containing the following information about the person: 

  name, age,64

 and present address 

  occupation, present employment, and name and address of employer 

  how many people will live in the apartment,  

 

two credit references, and 

  names and addresses of all landlords of the applicant for the past three years. 

nce given this information, the landlord has 14 days to answer the request.65

 No answer within 14 days 
is the same as consent, and the tenant can go ahead and sublease.66 The new tenants may be rejected 
only for certain specific reasons, and the landlord cannot unreasonably prevent subleasing.67

 

awful reasons for denial 

If the landlord decides not to allow the sublease, a written basis for the decision must be provided. The 
only legal reasons are:68

 

insufficient credit standing or financial responsibility, 

too many people for the residence, 

  unwillingness of the new tenant to accept the terms of the rental agreement, 

the tenant’s pets are not acceptable, 

the tenant’s proposed commercial activity , or 

  a bad report from a former landlord of the prospective tenant. 

 

If the landlord refuses the new tenant-applicant, but does not give one of these reasons, the tenant can 
either go ahead with the sublease or move out.69

 

f the choice is to move, the tenant must give a written notice to the landlord 30 days in advance of the 
rental due date by which the tenant plans to move.

MOVING OUT 

ive plenty of notice! 

Sooner or later, most tenants decide to move on, or the landlord, for some reason, decides that the 
landlord no longer wants to rent the unit. Whether you are the landlord or the tenant, be sure that when 
this happens, your notice to terminate the tenancy is in writing. 

he notice from the tenant to the landlord must include: 

the address of the premises, 

the date the tenancy is to end, and 

the signature of the person giving the notice. 

he notice from the landlord to the tenant must include the above, plus, the notice must contain: 70

 

  an explanation of why the tenancy is being terminated, 

if applicable, an explanation of any remedial action which the tenant must take in order to avoid 
termination of the tenancy and the date and time when the corrective action must be completed, 

  a date and time when the tenancy will end and the tenant must be gone, and 

  notice that if the tenant continues to occupy the dwelling after the termination date the landlord may 

sue to remove the tenant. 

ow much notice is enough? 

The amount of notice needed to end a rental agreement varies, depending upon whether the rental 
agreement is week-to-week, month-to-month, or year-to-year. 

hen a tenant with a month-to-month tenancy wants to move, the law requires that the tenant give the 
landlord written notice at least 30 days before the rental due date specified as the termination date in the 
notice. If the tenant wants to move between rental due dates, the notice must be delivered on or before 
the rental due date which falls at least 30 days before the move-out date.71

 

or example, if rent is due the 8th of each month and the tenant wants to move on April 8, written notice 
must be delivered to the landlord by March 8. If the same tenant wishes to move on April 21, notice would 
still have to be delivered by March 8, or there would not be a full tenancy month’s notice. The tenant 
could then end up paying an extra month’s rent. 

f the same landlord wants the same tenant to move out by April 30, notice would have to be delivered to 
the tenant before March 8. If the landlord does not deliver notice until March 9, the tenant will not have to 
move until May 8, when the tenant has had a full tenancy month’s notice. 

enants in a month-to-month tenancy who do not give proper notice are responsible for rent for one rental 
  

period or until the unit is re-rented, whichever is less.72

This does not include tenants who are moving because of serious problems which the landlord has not fixed.) 

enants who do not give proper notice may also experience a delay in getting back their deposit. (See:

Tenants who wish to terminate a week-to-week tenancy must give the landlord written notice at least 14 
days before the termination date specified in the notice.73 For example, a week-to-week tenant wishing to 
move on July 26 must give notice by July 12. 

otice is notice 

When a landlord accepts a moving notice, but a tenant fails to move out by the date specified in the 
notice, the landlord may sue for eviction. If the tenant stays beyond the specified move-out date willfully 
and not in good faith, the landlord may also sue for 1-1/2 times actual damages.74

 

f a landlord sells the property while tenants are residing there, the new owner must also give proper 
notice if they want to terminate tenancy. 

ow to deliver notice 

The way notice is delivered is very important. A landlord’s notice to quit to a tenant must either be 
delivered personally, or by registered or certified mail. If notice is mailed, a landlord should send the 
notice to the address of the premises rented by the tenants. 

f the landlord is not able to serve notice by one of these two methods, listed above, the landlord then has 
two options. The notice may be given to any adult who appears to live with the tenants, or the notice may 
be posted in plain sight on the premises.75

 

 tenant may hand deliver or mail a notice to the landlord to the address where rent is paid. 

owever notice is delivered, it is important that the landlord or tenant complete and retain the Record of 
Service at the bottom of the Notice. If the tenant does not move and must be evicted, it is important in the 
F.E.D. action to show that notice was delivered according to law.  (See “Serving Notices to Quit,” pg. 27, 
for more information on notices to quit.) 

leaning up and clearing out 

A wise tenant will start to clean up well before moving day. Tenants are expected to clean the dwelling 
unit completely, including the bathtubs, toilets, and all appliances. Other cleaning responsibilities should 
be listed in the rental agreement or lease, or in the landlord’s posted rules. In general, tenants are 
expected to keep and leave the place as clean as the condition of the premises permit.76 In particular, if 
the carpets were professionally cleaned immediately before the tenancy began, the landlord can insist 
that the tenant have the carpets professionally cleaned at move-out.77 

amages 

Once the cleaning is complete, the tenant should inspect the premises with the landlord, noting any 
damages that were not there when the tenant moved in. Both should sign the inspection report and keep 
a copy. (See: “Returning the Deposit,” pg. 22)  

enants cannot be charged for damages caused by “normal wear and tear.”78 “Normal wear and tear” 

means deterioration that occurs from the intended use of the rental unit and without negligence, 
carelessness, accident, misuse or abuse of the premises or contents by the tenant, members of the 
tenant’s household, or the tenant’s guests and invitees. Landlords and tenants frequently disagree about 
what constitutes normal wear and tear, so here are a few guidelines: 

  A family with children or pets will normally wear things out faster than an adult living alone. This type 
of wear is the landlord’s responsibility, and is expected when renting to a family with children or pets.

 

If something cannot be cleaned because of the landlord’s acts or negligence, it is the landlord’s 
responsibility. This includes things like walls left dirty because of non-washable paint and stains on 
the walls resulting from faulty plumbing. 
 

  Dry cleaning draperies and washing walls are major cleaning tasks that cannot be charged against a 
tenant’s security deposit if the tenant fails to perform these tasks at the termination of the tenancy. A 
landlord must expect that any property in which people live will need walls, carpets and drapes 
cleaned before another tenant rents the property. Withholding a tenant’s security deposit for such 
tasks would be holding a tenant responsible for normal wear and tear, in violation of the Landlord and 
Tenant Act.79 

  Painting the walls, repairing holes in the carpet, and replacing draperies are tenant responsibilities 

only if such repair or replacement is needed due to tenant negligence. 

amage caused by the tenant is the tenant’s responsibility, even if it was caused by accident or by the 

actions of a tenant’s guest. The landlord may keep enough of the deposit to repair such damage. 

f the tenant has purposely destroyed the landlord’s property (by throwing a rock through the window, 
writing on the walls, or smashing the furniture, for example), the tenant may be guilty of criminal mischief 
and could face up to five years in prison and a $50,000 fine, and still have to pay for the damage. 

eturning the deposit 

Once the tenancy ends and possession of the property has been returned to the landlord, the landlord  
will assess whether there are damages or accrued rent caused by the tenant’s noncompliance with  
AS 34.03.120. 

 
If there are no damages or accrued rent, the landlord must mail the full security deposit to the tenant 
within 14 days after the tenancy ends and possession of the property is delivered by the tenant.80 
 
If there are damages or accrued rent, the landlord must mail an itemized list and any security deposit 
refund to the tenant within 30 days after the tenancy ends and possession of the property is delivered 
by the tenant.81 

 

If the landlord willfully fails to comply with this requirement, the tenant may recover up to twice the amount 
withheld by the landlord.82  

he itemized list may be hand-delivered or mailed to the tenant’s last known address. Tenants can help 
ensure receipt of the itemized list and refund by providing the landlord with a current mailing address. If 
the landlord does not know the tenant’s current mailing address, but knows or has reason to know how to 
contact the tenant, the landlord must make a reasonable effort to deliver the notice and refund to the 
tenant. 

f the tenant does not give proper notice or abandons the dwelling, the landlord may take up to 30 days 
after the tenancy is terminated (or after the landlord becomes aware of the abandonment) to return the 
deposit or provide a written notice of accrued rent and damages.83

hen the landlord keeps the deposit 

When a tenant moves out, the tenant has a right to get back the full security deposit if: 

  no damage has been done beyond that caused by normal wear and tear; and 

 

the rent is paid.

23 

Otherwise, the landlord has the right to keep all or part of the security deposit to cover these costs.84 

Some landlords try to get around the law by specifying that unless the tenant stays for a certain time 
period (six months, for example), the tenant automatically forfeits a portion of the security deposit. This is 
unlawful, since the law requires that to hold the tenant responsible for rent the landlord must try to re-rent 
the unit as soon as possible, and may only hold the tenant liable for rent during the time the unit is 
actually empty. 

Another unlawful practice is charging a “nonrefundable cleaning fee.” A “cleaning fee” is simply another 
name for a security deposit. If the tenant keeps the unit as clean and safe as the condition of the 
premises permit,85 the tenant has fulfilled the tenant’s legal obligation, and the landlord has no cleaning 
expenses that can properly be charged against the deposit. 

Under no circumstances may the landlord seize property belonging to the tenant to satisfy rent or to cover 
damages.86 

ermination of tenancy 

You may have heard that tenants cannot be evicted in the winter in Alaska or that tenants with small 
children cannot be evicted. Unless you are a mobile home park tenant, neither is true. (See Termination 
of mobile home tenancies, pg. 25.) 

he term “eviction” is often used to refer to the landlord’s action in ending a tenancy and requiring that the 
tenant move. But only a court can order the eviction of a tenant if the tenant refuses to move. (See: How 
F.E.D. Cases Work,” pg. 29.) When the Landlord and Tenant Act speaks of the landlord’s action as 
“terminating the tenancy,” it is important to remember that either the landlord or the tenant can terminate 
the tenancy by giving the proper notice; and that terminating the tenancy does not give the landlord the 
right to forcibly remove a tenant who has not moved out, as this can only be done by a court. 

here are several different sets of circumstances under which a landlord may terminate a tenancy. Some 
problems can be cured by the tenant, stopping the eviction. Others cannot. In each case, a written notice 
is required. 

ermination for late rent 

A seven-day written notice is required to terminate a tenancy when a tenant is behind in rent. The notice 
must state the correct amount of rent to be paid by the tenant. If the rent is paid before the seven 
complete days are up, then the tenant may stay. 

If the tenant tries to pay after the seven days are up, the landlord may refuse to accept the rent and 
continue with the eviction.)87

 The notice must tell tenants that they have the choice of paying or moving.88

 

f a landlord accepts a partial rent payment after giving a seven-day notice for nonpayment, the landlord 
must either make a new written agreement with the tenant to extend the eviction for a specific period of 
time or begin the eviction process all over again.89

 

ermination for deliberate infliction of substantial damage to the 

premises 
Written notice must be given to terminate a tenancy when the tenant or the tenant’s guests have 
intentionally caused more than $400 damage to the landlord’s property. This notice must be given at least 
24 hours and no more than five days before termination.90

PUB-30 (10/18) 
 

Even if the tenant agrees to repair the damage (and the tenant will be liable for the damage in any event), 
the landlord may still go through with the eviction. 

ermination for illegal activity on the premises 

If the tenant or a guest of the tenant is engaged in an illegal activity on the premises (such as prostitution, 
gambling, or illegal drug or alcohol production or sale), the tenant may be evicted upon service of a five-
day notice.91

 The law refers to these types of illegal activities as “nuisances.” 

n addition, if a court ever finds in another legal proceeding (in a criminal case, for example) that a 
nuisance is being conducted on particular leased premises (and provided that the tenant received proper 
notice of the court proceedings), the court will issue an order of abatement that will terminate the tenancy 
immediately.92

 

ermination for failure to pay utility bills 

If a utility company discontinues service to the premises due to the tenant’s failure to pay the utility bill, 
the landlord may issue a five-day notice to terminate the tenancy. If the tenant reinstates the service 
within three days after service of the notice and repays the landlord for any payments made to the utility 
company, and provided the premises were not somehow damaged due to the lapse in service, the 
eviction process ends and the tenant can stay. However, in the absence of due care by the tenant, if the 
same utility service is disconnected again within six months, the landlord can terminate the tenancy with a 
three-day notice, and the tenant has no right to fix to problem.93

 

ermination for breach of duties 

A ten-day written notice is required when the landlord wishes to terminate a tenancy because the tenant 
has breached an important part of the rental agreement or the tenants responsibilities under the Landlord 
and Tenant Act (such as disturbing other tenants with too much noise or failing to maintain the rental unit, 
so that the health and safety of others are endangered).  

f the problem is corrected before expiration of the notice period, the tenant may stay.94 However, if the 
tenant violates the rental agreement in substantially the same way more than once in a six-month period, 
the landlord can evict the tenant with a five-day notice, and the tenant has no right to fix the problem. 

ome types of problems may not be remediable, such as a pattern of behavior by the tenant that has a 

significant impact or left the other tenants frightened for their safety. In such situations, the tenant is 
obligated to leave by the end of the ten-day period.95

 

en days notice is also required when the landlord is terminating a tenancy because the tenant has 

refused the landlord’s reasonable requests to enter the dwelling.96 

andlord’s termination of rental agreement by choice 

A 30-day written notice is required when the landlord wishes to terminate a month-to-month tenancy for 
general reasons.97 This notice must be delivered 30 days before the rental due date specified in the 
notice as the termination date. 

or example, if a tenant’s rent is due on the 15th of the month and the landlord wishes that the tenant 

move by October 15, the tenant must be given the notice on or before September 15.

To terminate a week-to-week tenancy, the landlord must give written notice at least 14 days before the 
termination date given in the notice.98

 

 termination notice may not be used to end a lease prior to the end of the lease term without cause. 

ermination of mobile home tenancies 

While most renters can have their tenancies terminated for a variety of reasons, the law says that mobile 
home park tenants can be evicted from the park only for these reasons:99

 

the tenants are behind in space rent and don’t pay even after receiving a 7 day written notice from the 
landlord; 

the tenants have been convicted of violating a law or ordinance, the violation is continuing, and the 
violation endangers the health, safety or welfare of others in the park; 

the tenant has violated a reasonable provision of the rental agreement or lease and doesn’t stop the 
violation even after receiving a written notice from the landlord; or100 

there is to be a change in the use of the land on which the park is located. (This last reason is subject 
to several limitations. The notice has to be at least 270 days, or longer if a local municipal ordinance 
sets a longer period, and has to be at least a year if the change of land use is a conversion to a 
“common-interest community” (condominiums, for example). The termination date cannot be earlier in 
the year than May 1, nor later than October 15.)101 

xcept for termination of tenancy due to change in the use of the land on which the park is located, the 

same notice periods are required for mobile home park tenants as for other types of tenants.102

 

ermination for absence or abandonment 

According to the law, rental agreements must require that tenants notify their landlord every time they 
plan to be gone for more than seven days. If the tenant plans to be gone only two or three days, then 
finds the tenant will actually be gone for more than a week, the tenant must notify the landlord as soon as 
possible.103 This is to help protect the property from damage such as that caused by freezing pipes. 

enants who willfully fail to give notice of being gone can be sued by their landlord for 1-1/2 times the 

actual damages caused by any calamity occurring during their absence.104 

hen tenants are gone, the landlord may enter the dwelling only if there is an emergency or with the 
tenants consent and proper notice. However, if tenants are gone more than a week without notifying the 
landlord, the landlord may, at times reasonably necessary, go into the unit for reasonable repairs, 
inspections, or to show the dwelling.105

 

hen is it abandonment? 

A landlord may assume the dwelling has been abandoned when the following three elements are met:

99 AS 34.03.225(a); see, Osness v. Dimond Estates, Inc., 615 P.2d 605, 607-08 (Alaska 1980). 
100 This can include a termination if the mobile home is not in a fit and habitable condition. However, the 
termination cannot be based solely on the age of the mobile home, unless (1) the age limit was already in 
effect when the mobile home was moved into the park, (2) the mobile home has been sold after the age 
limitation is exceeded, and (3) the owner or tenant of the mobile home has not brought the mobile home 
into compliance with certain life safety requirements specified in part 3280 of Title 24 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations. AS 34.03.220(b).

the tenant is behind in rent; and 

the tenant has left behind the tenant’s personal belongings in the dwelling, but has been gone for 
more than seven consecutive days; and 

the tenant did not notify the landlord that the tenant would be gone for more than seven days.106 

hen a dwelling has been abandoned, the landlord may enter, clean up, and re-rent it. If the landlord 
makes a good faith effort to re-rent the unit at fair rental value, the former tenant is obligated for rental 
payment until the end of the following rental period, the end of the lease period (if the agreement is a 
lease), or until a new tenant moves in, whichever is sooner.107 

If a tenant abandons a dwelling leaving personal belongings behind, the landlord must notify the tenant: 

bandoned belongings 

  where the property is being held; 

that the tenant has a minimum of 15 days to remove the property. (The time period may be 
lengthened at the discretion of the landlord or agreement of the parties or may be made shorter if the 
parties agree to a shorter time period); and 

  what the landlord intends to do with the property if it is not removed. 

elongings not removed within that time may be: 

 

sold at public sale (property not sold may be disposed of); 

  disposed of as the landlord sees fit (if it is food or something perishable); or 

  destroyed or otherwise disposed of (such as by charitable donation) when the cost of having a public 

sale would exceed the value of the items. 

he landlord must exercise reasonable care over the tenant’s belongings and keep them in a safe place, 
but is not responsible for damage or loss not caused by the landlord’s neglect or deliberate action. If the 
tenant’s property is stored in the dwelling, storage charges may not exceed the rent. If the property is held 
at a commercial storage company, the landlord may pass the moving and storage costs on to the 
tenant.108

 

olding a public sale 

To hold a public sale, the landlord should post a written or printed public sale notice in three specific 
places within five miles of the location of the sale, not less than ten days prior to the sale. One of the 
notices must be posted at the post office nearest the place of the sale.109

 

he law does not specify what should be done with the sale proceeds, but presumably the landlord may 
apply them to storage costs, the costs of holding the sale, and to any damages (such as unpaid rent) not 
satisfied by the security deposit. The excess, if any, should be paid to the tenant. (If the tenant cannot be 
located, the landlord may be required to pay the excess to the Department of Revenue under the 
unclaimed property law.110

  Landlords in this situation may wish to consult an attorney.)

abandonment. However, when a landlord deliberately or negligently violates the law governing 
abandonments, the tenant may sue for up to twice the tenant’s actual damages.111

 

erving a Notice to Quit 

Notices of Termination of Tenancy (also called “Notices to Quit”) from the landlord must be served on the 
tenant by: 

  delivering the notice in person to the tenant or occupant; 

leaving the notice at the dwelling when the tenant is absent from the premises; or 

sending the notice by registered or certified mail.112 

 Notice to Quit must:113

 

  be in writing, 

 

say why the tenancy is being terminated, 

  give the date and time when the tenancy will end and the tenant must be gone, 

  give the tenant the required number of days allowed by law to move out, 

if the termination is based on a tenant’s breach or violation of the rental agreement and the breach 
may be corrected by the tenant, the notice must specify what corrective actions the tenant must take 
to remedy the violation and the date and time when the corrective action must be completed to avoid 
termination of the tenancy, and 

  give notice that if the tenant continues to occupy the dwelling after the termination date the landlord 

may sue to remove the tenant.  

nce the tenant receives a Notice to Quit from the landlord, the tenant may move at any time during the 

notice period. The tenant owes rent until the end of the notice period. 

f a tenant who is served with a Notice to Quit does not wish to move, the tenant should not simply refuse 
to see or speak to the landlord. It is important to take immediate action. 

o challenge a termination of tenancy, a tenant may want to: 

  give the landlord a letter explaining why the tenant disagrees with the landlord’s reasons for eviction, 

  give the letter to the landlord before the notice expires; and 

consult an attorney, or if low income, contact Alaska Legal Services. 

hen the landlord receives this letter, the landlord may choose whether to go to court to enforce eviction 
or just drop the matter. If the landlord goes to court, a judge will give both the landlord and the tenant an 
opportunity to present their case before making a decision. 

oreclosure problems 

When a landlord misses mortgage payments on the rental property, tenants may receive demands from 
the lender that they pay rent to the lender rather than to the landlord. This is because mortgages or deeds 
of trust often give the lender the right to collect rents if the borrower defaults. But if the landlord continues 
to demand that the tenant pay the landlord, the tenant is placed in a very difficult position. A tenant who 
pays rent to the party who is not legally entitled to it could end up paying twice.

Tenants experiencing conflicting demands should get written proof from the lender that the lender is 
entitled to collect the rent. They might also try to get an assurance that the lender will defend them 
against eviction attempts by the landlord. 

enants who find themselves in this situation may wish to consult an attorney. It may be possible to set 

up an arrangement in which the rent is paid into court or into a special account. The landlord and the 
lender can then fight it out to determine who is entitled to the rent. 

ockouts, utility shut-offs and threats 

A landlord may not coerce a tenant to move by: 

shutting off utilities, 

changing the locks, 

taking the tenant’s belongings, or 

taking possession of the dwelling by force without a court hearing. 

hese actions are unlawful even if the rental agreement says that the tenant waives notice and eviction 

procedures, since the Landlord and Tenant Act prohibits waivers of a tenant’s rights.114

 

f the landlord unlawfully removes or excludes the tenant from the premises or willfully diminishes 
services, the tenant may sue the landlord to regain possession of the premises or terminate the rental 
agreement. In either case, the tenant may recover up to 1-1/2 times actual damages.115 

sing a charge or threat of criminal trespass against tenants in order to evict them without the benefit of a 

court hearing is an abuse of the law. Police who participate in such an action may be guilty of official 
misconduct.116 In such cases, tenants may sue both the landlord and the police for abusing the law. 
Tenants subjected to this treatment should see an attorney. 

ubsidized housing 

If you receive a housing subsidy or live in a federal or state housing project, you may have rights in 
addition to those provided by state law. For example, if AHFC, Division of Public Housing pays part of 
your rent under the Section 8 program, your tenancy may be terminated only in accordance with your 
lease. Contact your local AHFC, Division of Public Housing office for more information about special 
requirements. 

etaliation by the landlord 

The landlord may not retaliate (in the manner described here) against a tenant because: 

the tenant complains to the landlord about the landlord’s failure to perform the landlord’s 
responsibilities; 

the tenant exercises the tenant’s legal rights under the Alaska Landlord and Tenant Act;117 

the tenant organizes or joins a tenant union or similar organizations; or 
the tenant complains to a government agency responsible for enforcement of governmental housing, 
wage, price or rent controls. 

he law prohibits retaliation by the landlord. This means the landlord cannot:

raise the rent; 

  decrease services (such as shutting off utilities); or 

 

start or threaten to start an eviction proceeding against the tenant.118 

f a tenant feels that illegal retaliation has occurred, the tenant can move out or stay, and in either case, 
sue for as much as 1-1/2 times the actual damages.119

 

An eviction proceeding is not considered illegal retaliation if the landlord (in good faith) acts because: 

hen it’s NOT retaliation 

the tenant is behind in rent; 

the landlord needs the dwelling vacant to make repairs needed to meet code requirements; 
 
the tenant is using the place for illegal purposes; 

 

the landlord wants to use the place for something other than a residential dwelling for at least six 
months or for personal purposes; 

the landlord wishes to substantially remodel or demolish the unit; or 

the property is being sold and the new owner intends it for personal use, or intends to substantially 
remodel or demolish, or change it from rental use for at least six months. 120 

 rent increase is not considered illegal retaliation if the landlord can show, in good faith: 

  a recent sizable increase in taxes or cost of maintaining the property (not including the cost of 

repairing something because of the tenant’s complaint);121 

that similar dwellings are being rented for a higher rate or, if there are no similar dwelling units, the 
proposed rent does not exceed the fair rental value of the dwelling;122

 or 

that the true costs of major improvements made to the property are being passed on to all tenants 
fairly and equally.123 

f the tenant won’t move 
If the tenant refuses to move at the end of the period specified in the Notice to Quit, the landlord must go 
to court to evict. The landlord may NOT take over the rental dwelling by force or by locking out the tenant. 
The court refers to most eviction suits by landlords as “Forcible Entry and Detainer” (F.E.D.) cases. 

ow F.E.D. cases work 

The landlord files the landlord’s claim with the court. The tenant receives a complaint and summons to 
appear in court. The tenant has twenty days to file an answer to the complaint. 

here will be two hearings. The first hearing, which will usually be held before the tenant’s written answer 

is due, is to address who gets possession of the dwelling unit. The second hearing, which will be 
scheduled by the court for a date after the first hearing, is to determine whether the landlord or the tenant 
owes the other any money (and this may not be necessary if neither party is claiming to be owed money). 
At the second hearing both the landlord and tenant have a right to present evidence of damages and the 
parties have a right to a jury trial.

he first hearing (possession hearing) will be scheduled not more than 15 days after the case has been 

filed in court. The summons should be served on the tenant no less than 2 days before the day of the 
hearing.124 

t the hearing, both the landlord and the tenant will have an opportunity to tell their side of the story to the 
judge. The landlord and tenant can raise defenses and counterclaims to the complaint at that time. There 
is no right to a jury trial at the possession hearing.125
 

f the judge finds in favor of the tenant, the tenant will be allowed to stay and the landlord may be 
required to pay the tenant’s attorney fees.  

f the judge finds in favor of the landlord, the judge will decide how long the tenant has before the tenant 
must be out of the rental unit. If the tenant still does not move, the landlord can get a writ of assistance 
from the court that will permit the police to assist in the eviction. In addition, the tenant may have to pay 
the landlord’s attorney fees. 

.E.D. cases are usually handled by district court. For more information on eviction procedures, see AS 

09.45.060-AS 09.45.160, Forcible Entry and Detainer, and Civil Rule 85 of the Alaska Rules of Court. 
More specific answers to questions on F.E.D.s may be found in a booklet prepared by the Administrative 
Office of the Alaska Court System. Inquire at your local court or magistrate’s office or at  
https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/civ-720.pdf. 

enants may have a legal defense or claim against the property owner which could prevent an eviction. If 

they do not want to be evicted, tenants must act quickly and should see an attorney. 

When landlords and tenants disagree, sometimes tempers flare and things are said or done which are 
totally outside the law. Sometimes the disagreement can be easily resolved if the parties just talk and 
listen to one another. But if you cannot resolve your disagreement, remember that each party has a legal 
obligation to act in good faith,126
 which means that all actions must be taken in an honest, reasonable and 
forthright manner. 

ollow these suggestions: 

  Try to remain calm. Do everything possible to prevent the situation from getting worse. 

  Gather your facts and put them in writing. 

  Pay careful attention to the sections of the law requiring written notices and specifying the number of 

days allowed for landlords and tenants to remedy problem situations. 

  Present your position to the other party in writing, clearly stating what you want to change and what 

you will do if the situation does not change.  

he rental of dwelling is a business, and as in any business, both parties should conduct themselves in a 

fair, honest manner.  

here are not many agencies that will mediate landlord/tenant disputes, and the amounts at stake are 

usually not high enough to justify hiring a lawyer or going to court.  

ost landlord and tenant problems can be satisfactorily settled if both parties simply act “in good faith.”  

f serious problems arise, it is always advisable to see a lawyer. But first, give the other person a chance 
to try to work it out with you.

You  are  notified  that  you  have  again  violated  your  rental  agreement  by  failing  to  pay  utility  bills.    This  delinquency  has  caused  the  utility
company  to  shut  off  the  service  to  the  rental  property.

I  have  already  notified  you  of  another  occurrence  of  this  violation  on  the                day  of                                  20              ,  which  is  within  the  past  six
months.    Therefore,  per AS 34.03.220(e),  you  are  notified  that  your  tenancy  is  terminated  THREE  DAYS  from  the  date  you  receive  this
notice, which means that you must move out by the         day of                            , 20         , at                 o’clock a.m./p.m.

If  you  have  not  moved  out  by  that  time,  a  lawsuit  may  be  filed  to  evict  you.

Chapter 34.03. 
UNIFORM RESIDENTIAL LANDLORD AND TENANT ACT 
 
Article 01. PURPOSES AND RULES OF CONSTRUCTION 

ec. 34.03.010. Purpose and construction. 

 (a) This chapter shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policies. 
 (b) The underlying purposes and policies of this chapter are to 
 (1) simplify, clarify, modernize, and revise the law governing the rental of dwelling units and the rights and 
obligations of landlord and tenant; 
 (2) encourage landlord and tenant to maintain and improve the quality of housing; and 
 (3) make uniform the law among those states that enact it. 
 

Sec. 34.03.020. Terms and conditions of rental agreement. 

Article 02. RENTAL AGREEMENTS 

(a) The landlord and tenant may include in a rental agreement clauses and conditions not prohibited 

by this chapter or by law, including rent, terms of agreement, and other provisions governing the rights and 
obligations of the parties. 

(b) In the absence of agreement, the tenant shall pay as rent the fair rental value for the use and 

occupancy of the dwelling unit. 

(c) Rent shall be payable without demand or notice at the time and place agreed upon by the parties. 

Unless otherwise agreed, rent is payable at the dwelling unit. Unless otherwise agreed, rent is payable at the 
beginning of any term of one month or less and otherwise in equal monthly installments. Unless otherwise 
agreed, rent shall be uniformly apportionable from day to day and shall be paid on the date the periodic tenancy 
begins and payable on or before the same date of each and every month thereafter until the tenancy 
terminates. 

(d) Unless the rental agreement fixes a definite term, the tenancy shall be week to week in the case of 

a tenant who pays weekly rent, and in all other cases month to month. 

(e) If required by the landlord, the landlord and the tenant shall include within the rental agreement, 
incorporate by reference in the rental agreement, or add as a separate attachment to the rental agreement a 
premises condition statement, setting out the condition of the premises, including fixtures but excluding 
reference to any of the other contents of the premises, and, if applicable, a contents inventory itemizing or 
describing all of the furnishings and other contents of the premises and specifying the condition of each of them. 
In the premises condition statement and contents inventory, the landlord and tenant shall describe the premises 
and its contents at the commencement of the term of the period of the occupancy covered by the rental 
agreement. When signed by the landlord and tenant, the premises condition statement and contents inventory 
completed under this subsection become part of the rental agreement. 

ec. 34.03.030. Effect of unsigned or undelivered rental agreement. 

(a) If the landlord does not sign and deliver a written rental agreement signed and delivered to the 

landlord by the tenant, acceptance of rent without reservation by the landlord gives the rental agreement the 
same effect as if it had been signed and delivered by the landlord. 

(b) If the tenant does not sign and deliver a written rental agreement signed and delivered to the tenant 

by the landlord, acceptance of possession and payment of rent without reservation gives the rental agreement 
the same effect as if it had been signed and delivered by the tenant. 

(c) If a rental agreement given effect by the operation of this section provides for a term longer than 

one year, it is effective only for one year. 

ec. 34.03.040. Prohibited provisions in rental agreements. 

(a) A rental agreement may not provide that the tenant or landlord 
(1) agrees to waive or to forego rights or remedies under this chapter; 
(2) authorizes a person to confess judgment on a claim arising out of the rental agreement; 
(3) agrees to the exculpation or limitation of any liability of the landlord or tenant arising under the law 

or to indemnify the landlord or tenant for that liability or the costs connected with it; 

(4) agrees to pay the landlord's attorney fees. 
(b) A provision prohibited by (a) or (c) of this section included in a rental agreement is unenforceable. If 

a landlord or tenant willfully uses a rental agreement containing provisions known by the person to be 
prohibited, the other party may recover the amount of actual damages.

(c) A rental agreement between a mobile home park operator and a mobile home park tenant may not 
(1) deny a tenant of a mobile home park the right to sell the tenant's mobile home within the park or 
require the resident or tenant to remove the mobile home from the park solely on the basis of the sale of the 
mobile home, nor may the mobile home park operator make a rule or regulation to the same effect, except that, 
within 30 days of written notice by the tenant of intent to sell the mobile home to a specified buyer, the operator 
or owner of the mobile home park may refuse to allow a sale for the following reasons: 

(A) the mobile home is in violation of laws or ordinances relating to health, safety or welfare; 
(B) the proposed buyer refuses to assume the same terms as are in the existing rental agreement; or 
(C) the proposed buyer does not have sufficient financial responsibility; 
(2) require a tenant to provide permanent improvements that become a part of the real property of the 

mobile home park owner or operator as a condition of tenancy in the mobile home park; however, the rental 
agreement may require the tenant to maintain existing conditions in the park; 

(3) require payment of any type of vendor or transfer fee either by a tenant in the mobile home park 
desiring to sell the tenant's mobile home to another party or by any party desiring to purchase a mobile home 
from a tenant in the park as a condition of tenancy; however, this paragraph does not prevent the owner or 
operator from applying normal park standards to prospective tenants before granting or denying tenancy or from 
charging a reasonable vendor or transfer fee for services actually performed if the tenant is notified in writing of 
the amount of those charges before agreeing to move into the park; or 

(4) require the prospective tenant to pay a fee to enter the mobile home park or a tenant to pay a fee 

to transfer the tenant's mobile home to another location outside the park; however, this paragraph does not 
prevent the owner or operator from charging a reasonable fee for services actually performed and if the tenant 
is notified in writing of the amount of those charges before agreeing to move into the park. 

ec. 34.03.050. Separation of rents and obligations to maintain property forbidden. 

A rental agreement, assignment, conveyance, trust deed, or security instrument may not permit the receipt 

of rent free of the obligation to comply with AS 34.03.100 (a). 

ec. 34.03.060. Sublease and assignment. 

(a) Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the tenant may not sublet the premises or assign the rental 

agreement to another without the landlord's consent. 

(b) The tenant's right to sublease the premises or assign the rental agreement to another shall be 

conditioned on obtaining the landlord's consent, which may be withheld only upon the grounds specified in (d) 
of this section; no further restrictions on sublease or assignment are enforceable. 

(c) When the rental agreement requires the landlord's consent for sublease or assignment, the tenant 

may secure one or more persons who are willing to occupy the premises. Each prospective occupant shall 
make a written offer signed and delivered by the prospective occupant to the landlord, containing the following 
information on the prospective occupant: 

(1) name, age, and present address; 
(2) marital status; 
(3) occupation, place of employment, and name and address of employer; 
(4) number of all other persons who would normally reside with the prospective occupant; 
(5) two credit references, or responsible persons who will confirm the financial responsibility of the 

prospective occupant; and 

(6) names and addresses of all landlords of the prospective occupant during the prior three years. 
(d) Within 14 days after the written offer has been delivered to the landlord, the landlord may refuse 
consent to a sublease or assignment by a written rejection signed and delivered by the landlord to the tenant, 
containing one or more of the following reasonable grounds for rejecting the prospective occupant: 

(1) insufficient credit standing or financial responsibility; 
(2) number of persons in the household; 
(3) number of persons under 18 years of age in the household; 
(4) unwillingness of the prospective occupant to assume the same terms as are included in the 

existing rental agreement; 

(5) proposed maintenance of pets; 
(6) proposed commercial activity; or 
(7) written information signed by a previous landlord, which shall accompany the rejection, setting out 

abuses of other premises occupied by the prospective occupant. 

(e) In the event the written rejection fails to contain one or more grounds permitted by (d) of this 

section for rejecting the prospective occupant, the tenant may consider the landlord's consent given, or at the

tenant's option may terminate the rental agreement by a written notice given without unnecessary delay to the

Sec. 34.03.070. Security deposits and prepaid rent. 

Article 03. LANDLORD OBLIGATIONS 

(a) Except as provided in (h) of this section, a landlord may not demand or receive prepaid rent or a 

security deposit, however denominated, in an amount or value in excess of two months' periodic rent. This 
section does not apply to rental units where the rent exceeds $2,000 a month. 

(b) Upon termination of the tenancy, property or money held by the landlord as prepaid rent or as a 
security deposit may be applied to the payment of accrued rent and the amount of damages that the landlord 
has suffered by reason of the tenant's noncompliance with AS 34.03.120 . The accrued rent and damages must 
be itemized by the landlord in a written notice mailed to the tenant's last known address within the time limit 
prescribed by (g) of this section, together with the amount due the tenant. In this subsection, "damages" 

(1) means deterioration of the premises and, if applicable, of the contents of the premises; 
(2) does not include deterioration 
(A) that is the result of normal wear and tear; 
(B) caused by the landlord's failure to prepare for expected conditions or by the landlord's failure to 

comply with an obligation of the landlord imposed by this chapter. 

(c) All money paid to the landlord by the tenant as prepaid rent or as a security deposit in a lease or 

rental agreement shall be promptly deposited by the landlord, wherever practicable, in a trust account in a bank, 
savings and loan association, or licensed escrow agent, and the landlord shall provide to the tenant the terms 
and conditions under which the prepaid rent or security deposit or portions of them may be withheld by the 
landlord. Nothing in this chapter prohibits the landlord from commingling prepaid rents and security deposits in a 
single financial account; however, the landlord shall separately account for prepaid rent and security deposits 
received from each tenant. The landlord may not commingle prepaid rent and security deposits with other 
funds. The landlord may not use money held for one tenant in a trust account to  

(1)  refund the security deposit of another tenant; 
(2)  apply to the payment of another tenant’s accrued rent; 
(3) apply to damages suffered by the landlord because of another tenant’s noncompliance with AS

written notice and refund required by (b) of this section within 14 days after the tenancy is terminated and 
possession is delivered by the tenant, except the landlord shall have 30 days after the tenancy is terminated to 
mail the refund if costs are deducted for damages that the landlord has suffered because of the tenant’s 
noncompliance with AS 34.03.120. If the tenant does not give notice that complies with AS 34.03.290 , the 
landlord shall mail the written notice and refund required by (b) of this section within 30 days after the tenancy is 
terminated, possession is delivered by the tenant, or the landlord becomes aware that the dwelling unit is 
abandoned. If the landlord does not know the mailing address of the tenant, but knows or has reason to know 
how to contact the tenant to give the notice required by (b) of this section, the landlord shall make a reasonable 
effort to deliver the notice and refund to the tenant. 

        (h) Notwithstanding the limitation on the amount of prepaid rent or security deposit in (a) of this 
section, a landlord may demand or receive an additional security deposit from a tenant who has a pet on the 
premises that is not a service animal. The additional security deposit 
        (1) may not exceed the periodic rent for one month; and 
        (2) shall be accounted for separately from prepaid rent or a security deposit received under (a) of this 

section and may be applied only to the amount of damages that are directly related to the pet of the tenant.

(A) to determine whether prepaid rent or a security deposit shall be applied to the payment of 

damages to the premises when authorized by AS 34.03.070(b); and 

(B) to compute the recovery of other damages to which the parties may be entitled under this chapter;

dwelling unit at the beginning of the rental agreement did not have running water, hot water, sewage, or sanitary 
facilities from a private system. 

(c) The landlord and tenant of a one- or two-family residence may agree in writing that the tenant 

perform the landlord's duties specified in (a)(4), (5), (6), and (7) of this section. A tenant may agree to perform

tenant is to perform specified repairs, maintenance tasks, alterations, or remodeling only if 

(1) the agreement of the parties is entered into in good faith and not for the purpose of evading the 

obligations of the landlord and is set out in a separate writing signed by the parties and supported by adequate 
consideration; and 

(2) the agreement does not diminish or affect the obligation of the landlord to other tenants in the

rental agreement in a good faith sale to a bona fide purchaser is relieved of liability under the rental agreement

(1) the landlord remains liable to the tenant for the property and money to which the tenant is entitled 

under AS 34.03.070 , unless the property and money are specifically assigned to and accepted by the 
purchaser; and 

(2) the provisions of 
(A) a premises condition statement prepared under AS 34.03.020 (e) between the landlord and the 

tenant remains valid as between the purchaser and the tenant until a new premises condition statement is 
entered into between the purchaser and the tenant; and 

(B) a contents inventory prepared under AS 34.03.020 (e) between the landlord and the tenant 

remains valid as between the purchaser and the tenant for the contents remaining on the premises after the

tenant. 

(b) Unless otherwise agreed, a manager of premises that include a dwelling unit is relieved of liability 

under the rental agreement and this chapter as to events occurring after written notice to the tenant of the 
termination of the person's management.

(c) A mobile home park operator may determine by rule or regulation the style or quality of the 

equipment, including but not limited to underskirting and tie-downs, to be purchased by the tenant from the 
vendor of the tenant's choice; however, the operator may not require that the equipment be purchased from the

Sec. 34.03.160. Noncompliance by the landlord: General. 

Article 05. TENANT REMEDIES 

(a) Except as provided in this chapter, if there is a material noncompliance by the landlord with the 

rental agreement or a noncompliance with AS 34.03.100 materially affecting health and safety, the tenant may 
deliver a written notice to the landlord specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and specifying 
that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than 20 days after receipt of the notice if the 
breach is not remedied in 10 days, and the rental agreement shall terminate as provided in the notice subject to 
the provisions of this section. If the breach is remediable by repairs or the payment of damages or otherwise, 
and the landlord remedies the breach before the date specified in the notice, the rental agreement will not 
terminate. In the absence of due care by the landlord, if substantially the same act or omission that constituted 
a prior noncompliance of which notice was given recurs within six months, the tenant may terminate the rental 
agreement upon at least 10 days written notice specifying the breach and the date of termination of the rental 
agreement. The tenant may not terminate for a condition caused by the deliberate or negligent act or omission 
of the tenant, a member of the tenant's family, or other person on the premises with the tenant's consent. 

(b) Except as provided in this chapter, the tenant may recover damages and obtain injunctive relief for 

any noncompliance by the landlord with the rental agreement or AS 34.03.100 , 34.03.210, or 34.03.280.

34.03.090 , rent abates until possession is delivered and the tenant may 

(1) upon at least 10 days written notice to the landlord terminate the rental agreement and upon 

termination the landlord shall return all prepaid rent and security deposits; or 

(2) demand performance of the rental agreement by the landlord and if the tenant elects, maintain an 

action for possession of the dwelling unit against the landlord and any person wrongfully in possession and 
recover the damages sustained. 

(b) If a person's failure to deliver possession is willful and not in good faith, an aggrieved tenant may 

recover from that person an amount not to exceed one and one-half times the actual damages. 

ec. 34.03.180. Wrongful failure to supply heat, water, hot water or essential services. 

(a) If, contrary to the rental agreement or AS 34.03.100 , the landlord deliberately or negligently fails to

notice to the landlord specifying the breach and may immediately 

(1) procure reasonable amounts of hot water, running water, heat, sanitary facilities, and essential 

services during the period of the landlord's noncompliance and deduct their actual and reasonable cost from the 
rent; 

(2) recover damages based on the diminution in the fair rental value of the dwelling unit; or

case the tenant is excused from paying rent for the period of the landlord's noncompliance and, in addition, may 
recover the amount by which the actual and reasonable cost exceeds rent. 

(b) A tenant who proceeds under this section may not proceed under AS 34.03.160 as to that breach. 
(c) Rights do not arise under this section until the tenant has given written notice to the landlord. 

Rights do not arise under this section if the condition was caused by the deliberate or negligent act or omission 
of the tenant, a member of the tenant's family, or other person on the premises with the tenant's consent. 

ec. 34.03.190. Landlord's noncompliance as defense to action for possession or rent. 

(a) In an action for possession based upon nonpayment of the rent or in an action for rent when the 

tenant is in possession, the tenant may counterclaim for any amount recoverable under the rental agreement or 
this chapter. If a counterclaim is made, the court shall determine whether the defense is supported by the 
evidence and, if so, may order that 

(1) the periodic rent is to be reduced to reflect the diminution in value of the dwelling unit during the 

period of noncompliance; 

(2) the action be continued for a reasonable time to enable the landlord to cure the violation; 
(3) the tenant pay into court all or part of the rent accrued and thereafter accruing; if the violations 

have not been cured within six months, the court shall enter judgment for the defendant and either refund to the 
defendant all money deposited or use the money for the purpose of making the dwelling fit for human 
habitation; if the violations have been cured, the court shall determine the amount due to each party; the party 
to whom a net amount is owed shall be paid first from the money paid into the court, and the balance by the 
other party; if no rent remains due after application of this section, judgment shall be entered for the tenant in 
the action for possession; 

(4) the tenant vacate the dwelling during the making of necessary repairs, when the repairs cannot be 

made without vacation of the premises, the tenant to be reinstated upon completion of the repairs.

(a) If the dwelling unit or premises are damaged or destroyed by fire or casualty to the extent that 

enjoyment of the dwelling unit is substantially impaired, the tenant shall 

(1) immediately vacate the premises and notify the landlord of the intention to terminate the rental 

agreement, in which case the rental agreement terminates as of the date of vacating; or 

(2) if continued occupancy is lawful, vacate the part of the dwelling unit rendered unusable by the fire 
or casualty, in which case the tenant's liability for rent is reduced in proportion to the diminution in the fair rental 
value of the dwelling unit. 

(b) If the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord shall return all prepaid rent and security deposits 
recoverable under AS 34.03.070. Accounting for rent in the event of termination or apportionment shall occur as 
of the date of the casualty. 

ec. 34.03.210. Tenant's remedies for landlord's unlawful ouster, exclusion, or diminution of service. 

If the landlord unlawfully removes or excludes the tenant from the premises or willfully diminishes services 
to the tenant by interrupting or causing the interruption of electric, gas, water, sanitary, or other essential service 
to the tenant, the tenant may recover possession or terminate the rental agreement and, in either case, recover 
an amount not to exceed one and one-half times the actual damages. If the rental agreement is terminated, the 
landlord shall return all prepaid rent and security deposits recoverable by the tenant under AS 34.03.070 . 

Sec. 34.03.220. Noncompliance with rental agreement; failure to pay rent. 

Article 06. LANDLORD REMEDIES 

(a) Except as provided in this chapter, 
(1) if the tenant or someone in the tenant's control deliberately inflicts substantial damage to the 

premises in breach of AS 34.03.120(a)(5) or the tenant engages in or permits another to engage in prostitution 
or another illegal activity at the premises in breach of AS 34.03.120(b), the landlord may deliver a written notice 
to quit to the tenant under AS 09.45.100 - 09.45.105 specifying the act or activity constituting the breach and 
specifying that the rental agreement will terminate on a date that is not less than 24 hours or more than five 
days after service of the notice; for purposes of this paragraph, damage to premises is "substantial" if the loss, 
destruction, or defacement of property attributable to the deliberate infliction of damage to the premises 
exceeds $400;

(2) if there is a material noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement, or if there is 

noncompliance with AS 34.03.120 , other than deliberate infliction of substantial damage to the premises or 
other than noncompliance as to a utility service for which the provisions of (e) of this section apply, materially 
affecting health and safety, the landlord may deliver a written notice to quit to the tenant under AS 09.45.100 - 
09.45.110 specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and specifying that the rental agreement 
will terminate on a date not less than 10 days after service of the notice; if the breach is not remedied, the rental 
agreement terminates as provided in the notice subject to the provisions of this section; if the breach is 
remediable by repairs or the payment of damages or otherwise and the tenant adequately remedies the breach 
before the date specified in the notice, the rental agreement will not terminate; in the absence of due care by 
the tenant, if substantially the same act or omission that constituted a prior noncompliance of which notice was 
given recurs within six months, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement upon at least five days’ written 
notice to quit specifying the breach and the date of termination of the rental agreement. 

(b) If rent is unpaid when due and the tenant fails to pay rent in full within seven days after written 

notice by the landlord of nonpayment and the intention to terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid 
within that period of time, the tenancy terminates unless the landlord agrees to allow the tenant to remain in 
occupancy, and the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and immediately recover possession of the 
rental unit. Only one written notice of default need be given the tenant by the landlord as to any one default. A 
landlord who has given written notice to the tenant under this subsection may accept a partial payment of the 
rent due under the rental agreement and extend the date for the eviction accordingly. 

(c) Except as provided in this chapter, the landlord may recover actual damages and obtain injunctive 

relief for any noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement or AS 34.03.120 . 

(d) An order of abatement entered by a court under AS 09.50.170 terminates a rental agreement on 

the premises subject to the order of abatement. 

(e) If a public utility providing electricity, natural gas, or water to the premises occupied by the tenant 

discontinues the service to the premises due to the failure of the tenant to pay for the utility service, the landlord 
may deliver a written notice to quit to the tenant advising that, notwithstanding (a) of this section, the tenancy 
will terminate five days after the landlord's service of the notice. If, within three days from the service of the 
notice, the tenant reinstates the discontinued service and repays the landlord for any amounts paid by the 
landlord to reinstate service, and if damage did not occur to the rental unit as a result of the discontinuance of 
service, the rental agreement will not terminate. However, in the absence of due care by the tenant, if 
substantially the same act or omission that constituted a prior noncompliance under this subsection for which 
notice was given recurs within six months, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement upon at least three 
days' written notice specifying the breach and the date of termination of the rental agreement. 

(f) A person whose use of premises is based solely on rights acquired by a tenant, and who has not 
individually acquired the rights of a tenant under this chapter, does not acquire rights under this chapter as a 
result of being present on the premises. 

ec. 34.03.225. Limitations on mobile home park operator's right to terminate. 

(a) A mobile home park operator may evict a mobile home or a mobile home park dweller or tenant 

only for one of the following reasons: 

(1) the mobile home dweller or tenant has defaulted in the payment of rent owed; 
(2) the mobile home dweller or tenant has been convicted of violating a federal or state law or local 

ordinance, and that violation is continuing and is detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of other dwellers or 
tenants in the mobile home park; 

(3) the mobile home dweller or tenant has violated a provision, enforceable under AS 34.03.130 , of 
the rental agreement or lease signed by both parties and not prohibited by law including rent and the terms of 
agreement; and 

(4) a change in the use of the land comprising the mobile home park, or the portion of it on which the 

mobile home to be evicted is located; however, all dwellers or tenants so affected by a change in land use shall 
be given at least 270 days' notice, or longer if a longer notice period is provided in a valid lease or required by a 
municipality; a dweller or tenant so affected by a change in land use shall be given a quit date not earlier than 
May 1 and not later than October 15; a municipality may establish a mobile home relocation fund and require 
that a dweller or tenant so affected by a change in land use be given a longer notice period or compensated 
from the fund for the cost of disconnecting, relocating, and reestablishing the dweller's or tenant's mobile home. 
(b) A mobile home park operator may not evict a mobile home or a mobile home park dweller or tenant 

because of the age of the mobile home, except that a mobile home or a mobile home park dweller or tenant 
may be evicted if, when the mobile home was admitted to the mobile home park, a regulation of the mobile 
home park limiting the age of a mobile home in the mobile home park was in effect, the mobile home is sold 

2016 Alaska Statutes 

55 

 

  S

after the age limitation has been exceeded, and the owner or tenant of the mobile home has failed to bring the 
unit into compliance with the life safety requirements of 24 CFR Part 3280. This does not prohibit eviction for 
violation of a provision enforceable under AS 34.03.130 that requires that a mobile home be in a fit and 
habitable condition. 

(c) When, under (a) of this section, a mobile home park owner is required to give notice to evict a 

mobile home owner or a mobile home park dweller or tenant, provision of notice to quit under AS 09.45.100 - 
09.45.105 satisfies the requirement of notice. 

ec. 34.03.230. Remedies for absence, nonuse and abandonment. 

(a) When the rental agreement requires the tenant to give notice to the landlord of an anticipated 

extended absence in excess of seven days as required in AS 34.03.150 and the tenant willfully fails to do so, 
the landlord may recover an amount not to exceed one and one-half times the actual damages. 

(b) During an absence of the tenant in excess of seven days, the landlord may enter the dwelling unit 
at times reasonably necessary as provided in AS 34.03.140 . The landlord may reenter the dwelling unit and, if 
there is evidence that the tenant has abandoned the dwelling unit, unless the landlord and tenant have made a 
specific agreement to the contrary, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement. 

(c) If the tenant abandons the dwelling unit, the landlord shall make reasonable efforts to rent it at a 
fair rental value. If the landlord rents the dwelling unit for a term beginning before the expiration of the rental 
agreement, the agreement is considered terminated on the date the new tenancy begins. The rental agreement 
is considered terminated by the landlord on the date the landlord has notice of the abandonment if the landlord 
fails to use reasonable efforts to rent the dwelling unit at a fair rental value or if the landlord accepts the 
abandonment as a surrender. If the tenancy is from month to month, or week to week, the term of the rental 
agreement for purposes of this section shall be considered a month or a week, as the case may be. 

ec. 34.03.240. Waiver of landlord's right to terminate. 

Acceptance of rent with knowledge of a default by the tenant or acceptance of performance by the tenant 

that varies from the terms of the rental agreement or rules or regulations subsequently adopted by the landlord 
constitutes a waiver of the right of the landlord to terminate the rental agreement for that breach, unless 
otherwise agreed after the breach has occurred. 

ec. 34.03.250. Landlord liens; distraint for rent abolished. 

(a) A lien or security interest on behalf of the landlord in the tenant's household goods is not 

enforceable unless perfected before March 19, 1974. 
(b) Distraint for rent is abolished. 

ec. 34.03.260. Disposition of abandoned property. 

(a) Except as otherwise agreed, if, upon termination of a tenancy including but not limited to a 
termination after expiration of a lease or by surrender or abandonment of the premises, a tenant has left 
personal property upon the premises, and the landlord reasonably believes that the tenant has abandoned this 
personal property, the landlord may 

(1) give notice to the tenant demanding that the property be removed within the dates set out in the 
notice but not less than 15 days after delivery or mailing of the notice, and that if the property is not removed 
within the time specified, the property may be sold; if the property is not removed within the time specified in the 
notice, the landlord may sell the property at a public sale; the landlord may dispose of perishable commodities 
in any manner the landlord considers fit; 

(2) if the tenant has left personal property that is reasonably determined by the landlord to be 
valueless or of such little value that the cost of storing and conducting a public sale would probably exceed the 
amount that would be realized from the sale, the landlord may notify the tenant that the property be removed 
within the date specified in the notice but not less than 15 days after delivery or mailing of the notice, and that if 
the property is not removed within the time specified, the landlord intends to destroy or otherwise dispose of the 
property; if the property is not removed within the time specified in the notice, the landlord may destroy or 
otherwise dispose of the property; in the notice, the landlord shall indicate an election to sell certain items of the 
tenant's personal property at public sale and to destroy or otherwise dispose of the remainder. 

(b) After notice as provided in (a) of this section, the landlord shall store all personal property of the 

tenant in a place of safekeeping and shall exercise reasonable care of the property, but is not responsible to the 
tenant for loss not caused by the landlord's deliberate or negligent act. The landlord may elect to store the 
property on the premises previously demised, in which event the storage cost may not exceed the fair rental

value of the premises. If the tenant's property is removed to a commercial storage company, the storage cost 
shall include the actual charge for the storage and removal from the premises to the place of storage. 

(c) After landlord's notice under (a) of this section, or otherwise, if the tenant makes timely response in 

writing of an intention to remove the personal property from the premises and does not do so within the time 
specified in the landlord's notice or within 15 days of the delivery or mailing of the tenant's written response 
whichever is later, it shall be conclusively presumed that the tenant has abandoned the property. If the tenant 
removes the property after notice, the landlord is entitled to the cost of storage for the period the property has 
remained in the landlord's safekeeping. 

(d) The landlord is not liable in damages in an action by a tenant claiming loss by reason of the 

landlord's storage, destruction, or disposition of property under this section. A landlord who deliberately or 
negligently violates the provisions of this section is liable for actual damages and penal damages of an amount 
not to exceed actual damages. 

(e) A public sale authorized under this section shall be conducted under AS 09.35.140 . The landlord 

may dispose of any property upon which no bid is made at the public sale. 

ec. 34.03.270. Remedy after termination. 

If the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord may have a claim for possession and for rent and a 

separate claim for actual damages for breach of the rental agreement. 

ec. 34.03.280. Recovery of possession limited. 

A landlord may not recover or take possession of the dwelling unit by action or otherwise, including willful 

diminution of services to the tenant by interrupting or causing the interruption of electricity, gas, water, sanitary, 
or other essential services to the tenant, except in case of abandonment, surrender, circumstances beyond the 
control of the landlord due to energy conditions, or as permitted in this chapter. 

ec. 34.03.285. Service of process upon tenant. 

In an action for possession under this chapter, the summons and complaint shall be served under the 

provisions of Rule No. 85 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. A continuance may not be granted plaintiff or 
defendant except for good cause shown. 

Article 07. PERIODIC TENANCY, HOLDOVER, AND ABUSE OF ACCESS 

Sec. 34.03.290. Periodic tenancy and holdover. 

(a) While rent is current, the landlord or the tenant may terminate a week to week tenancy by a written 

notice given to the other at least 14 days before the termination date specified in the notice. 

(b) The landlord or the tenant may terminate a month to month tenancy by a written notice given to the 

other at least 30 days before the rental due date specified in the notice. 

(c) If the tenant remains in possession without the landlord's consent after expiration of the term of the 
rental agreement or after its termination under (a) or (b) of this section, the landlord may, after serving a notice 
to quit to the tenant under AS 09.45.100 - 09.45.105, bring an action for possession and if the tenant's holdover 
is willful and not in good faith the landlord, in addition, may recover an amount not to exceed one and one-half 
times the actual damages. If the landlord consents to the tenant's continued occupancy, AS 34.03.020 applies. 

ec. 34.03.300. Landlord and tenant remedies for abuse of access. 

(a) If the tenant refuses to allow lawful access, the landlord may obtain injunctive relief to compel 

access or terminate the rental agreement. In either case, the landlord may recover an amount not to exceed the 
actual damages or one month's periodic rent, whichever is greater. If the landlord terminates the rental 
agreement, the landlord shall give written notice to the tenant at least 10 days before the date specified in the 
notice. 

(b) If the landlord makes an unlawful entry or a lawful entry in an unreasonable manner or makes 

repeated demands for entry otherwise lawful but which have the effect of unreasonably harassing the tenant, 
the tenant may obtain injunctive relief to prevent the recurrence of the conduct or terminate the rental 
agreement. In either case, the tenant may recover an amount not to exceed the actual damages or one month's 
periodic rent, whichever is greater, court costs and reasonable attorney fees. If the tenant terminates the rental 
agreement, the tenant shall give written notice to the landlord at least 10 days before the date specified in the 
notice.

Article 08. RETALIATORY ACTION 

(a) Except as provided in (c) and (d) of this section, a landlord may not retaliate by increasing rent or 

decreasing services or by bringing or threatening to bring an action for possession after the tenant has 

(1) complained to the landlord of a violation of AS 34.03.100 ; 
(2) sought to enforce rights and remedies granted the tenant under this chapter; 
(3) organized or become a member of a tenant's union or similar organization; or 
(4) complained to a governmental agency responsible for enforcement of governmental housing,

(b) If the landlord acts in violation of (a) of this section, the tenant is entitled to the remedies provided 

in AS 34.03.210 and has a defense in an action against the tenant for possession. 

(c) Notwithstanding (a) and (b) of this section, after serving a notice to quit to the tenant under AS 

09.45.100 - 09.45.105, a landlord may bring an action for possession if 

(1) the tenant is in default in rent; 
(2) compliance with the applicable building or housing code requires alteration, remodeling, or

substantially altering, remodeling, or demolishing the premises; 

(6) the landlord seeks in good faith to recover possession of the dwelling unit for the purpose of 

immediately terminating for at least six months use of the dwelling unit as a dwelling unit; or 

(7) the landlord has in good faith contracted to sell the property, and the contract of sale contains a 

representation by the purchaser corresponding to (4), (5) or (6) of this subsection. 

(d) Notwithstanding (a) of this section, the landlord may increase the rent if the landlord 
(1) has become liable for a substantial increase in property taxes, or a substantial increase in other 

maintenance or operating costs not associated with compliance with the complaint or request, not less than four 
months before the demand for an increase in rent; and the increase in rent bears a reasonable relationship to 
the net increase in taxes or costs; 

(2) has completed a capital improvement of the dwelling unit or the property of which it is a part and

straight-line depreciation of the improvement, prorated among the dwelling units benefited by the improvement; 

(3) can establish by competent evidence that the rent now demanded of the tenant does not exceed

In an action initiated by a party to recover damages or to obtain other relief to which a party may be entitled 

under this chapter, a premises condition statement and contents inventory prepared under AS 34.03.020(e) is 
presumptive evidence of the condition of the premises and its contents at the commencement of the term of the 
period of occupancy covered by the rental agreement between the parties. Unless its authenticity is rebutted by 
clear and convincing evidence by the party against whom the statement and contents inventory is offered, the 
statement and contents inventory may be offered by a party, without additional supporting evidence, as the 
basis on which to compute the recovery of damages to which the party may be entitled under this chapter.

process cannot be served in this state upon the designated agent, process may be served upon the 
commissioner of commerce, community, and economic development, but the service upon the commissioner is 
not effective unless the plaintiff or petitioner immediately mails a copy of the process and pleadings by certified 
or registered mail to the defendant or respondent at the last ascertainable address of the defendant or 
respondent. An affidavit of compliance with this section shall be filed with the clerk of the court having 
jurisdiction on or before the return day for the process, if any, or within any further time allowed by the court. 

ec. 34.03.345. Mediation and binding arbitration.

(E) a tenancy based upon an estate at will terminates, and the tenant or person in possession 

continues in possession of the premises; or 

(F) a person in possession continues in possession of the premises 
(i) at the expiration of the time limited in the lease or agreement under which that person holds; or 
(ii) without a written lease or agreement and without the consent of the landlord; or 
(3) when, without a notice to quit, a tenant or person in possession continues in the possession of 

the premises after the tenancy has been terminated by issuance of an order of abatement under AS 
09.50.210 (a). 

(c) When a landlord who is required to provide written notice to a tenant or person in possession 

under (a) or (b) of this section, provides notice by mail, notwithstanding any other provision of law, three 
days must be added to the period set out in (a) or (b) of this section to determine the date on and after 
which the tenant or person in possession unlawfully holds by force. 

ec. 09.45.100. Notice to quit. 

(a) Except where service of written notice is made under AS 09.45.090(a)(1) or (b)(1), or except 
when notice to quit is not required by AS 09.45.090 (a)(3) or (b)(3), a person entitled to the premises who 
seeks to recover possession of the premises may not commence and maintain an action to recover 
possession of premises under AS 09.45.060 - 09.45.160 unless the person first gives a notice to quit to 
the person in possession. 

(b) To recover possession of premises after a tenant or person in possession has failed or refused to 

pay rent due, service of the written notice required by AS 34.03.220 (b) or of a demand in writing for 
possession of the premises 

(1) constitutes notice to quit, and service of a separate notice to quit is not required; and 
(2) satisfies the requirements of (c) of this section and AS 34.03.310(c). 
(c) A notice to quit shall be in writing and shall be served upon the tenant or person in possession by 

being 

(1) delivered to the tenant or person; 
(2) left at the premises in case of absence from the premises; or 
(3) sent by registered or certified mail. 

ec. 09.45.105. Content of notice to quit. 

Notice to quit served upon the tenant or person in possession must 

(1) state 
(A) the nature of the breach or violation of the lease or rental agreement or other reason for 

termination of the tenancy of the tenant or person in possession; 

(B) in circumstances in which the breach or violation described in (A) of this paragraph may be 
corrected by the tenant or person in possession to avoid the termination of the tenancy, the nature of the 
remedial action to be taken, and the date and time by which the corrective actions must be completed in 
order to avoid termination of the tenancy; 

(C) the date and time when the tenancy of the tenant or person in possession under the lease or 

(2) direct the tenant or person in possession to quit the premises not later than the date and time of 

rental agreement will terminate; 

the termination of the tenancy; and

(3) give notice to the tenant or person in possession that, if the tenancy terminates and the tenant or 

person in possession continues to occupy the premises, the landlord may commence a civil action to 
remove the tenant or person and recover possession. 

ec. 09.45.110. Time when action to recover possession may be brought. 

An action for the recovery of the possession of the premises may be commenced on or after the date the 
tenant or person in possession unlawfully holds possession of the dwelling unit or rental premises by 
force, as determined under AS 09.45.090 . 

ec. 09.45.120. Summons and continuance. 

Summons in actions for forcible entry and detainer shall be served not less than two days before the date 
of trial. A continuance may not be granted for a longer period than two days unless the defendant 
applying for the continuance gives an undertaking to the adverse party, with sureties approved by the 
court conditioned to the payment of the rent that may accrue if judgment is rendered against the 
defendant. 

ec. 09.45.130. Action against persons paying rent in advance. 

The service of a notice to quit upon a tenant or person in possession does not authorize an action to be 
maintained against the tenant or person for the possession of the premises until the expiration of the 
period for which that tenant or person may have paid rent for the premises in advance. To authorize an 
action against a tenant or person in possession who has paid rent in advance, a notice must be given at 
least 10 days before the date the rent is due again in case of a month-to-month tenancy or at least three 
days before in the case of a week-to-week tenancy. 

ec. 09.45.135. Action against tenant occupying premises abated as nuisance. 

In an action under AS 09.45.060 - 09.45.160 against a tenant or person in possession of premises for 
which an order of abatement has been entered under AS 09.50.210 (a), a certified copy of the order of 
abatement is prima facie evidence of unlawful holding of the premises by force by a person who remains 
on the premises. 

ec. 09.45.140. Agricultural tenant. 

When the leasing or occupation is for the purpose of farming or agriculture, the tenant or person in 
possession shall, after the termination of the lease or occupancy, have free access to the premises to 
cultivate and harvest or gather any crop or produce of the soil planted or sown by the tenant or person 
before the service of the notice to quit.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
