      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHILD'S CHANGE OF NAME 

ntroduction 

 child1 cannot file a petition to change the child’s own name.  The petition must be filed by an 
adult (usually a parent) on the child’s behalf, however, the judge must also consider the desires 
of a child old enough to express an opinion about the proposed new name.   

s with an adult name change, the judge must find that the child’s name change is not contrary 

to the public interest.  With a child, there is an extra requirement that both parents consent to 
the name change.  The judge can waive (not require) this with good cause (for example, if the 
non-petitioning parent is deceased, had parental rights terminated, or is absent and cannot be 
located after a diligent search).  The court can also waive this requirement if the petitioner 
shows proof that the non-consenting parent had notice of (knew about) the name change 
petition, but chose not to participate in the case.  If either parent objects to the name change 
(either in writing or at the hearing), the court must also find that the name change would be in 
the best interests of the child before granting the petition. 

efore beginning this process, you should consider the following: 

•  Why do you want to change your child’s name?  A name change is not an adoption.  It 

does not change any of the legal rights or responsibilities between a parent and a child.  
It will not give any new rights to a stepparent or deny any rights to an existing parent.  
The name change cannot be used to avoid debts or disrupt the bond between one 
parent and the child.   

• 

Is it worth the expense and time involved?  A person can use any name for most 
purposes, although the person’s legal name will need to be used for official business.  
Once turning 18, the child can decide to file on the child’s own behalf, if desired. 

•  Do you have legal authority to ask for the name change?  It is rare for the court to allow 
someone other than a parent (or in some cases, a legal guardian) to ask for a name 
change on behalf of a child.  The court may also deny the name change if one parent 
objects, regardless of which parent has legal custody. 

• 

If all you want to do is correct a minor error on the child’s birth certificate (such as a 
misspelling of the child’s first name), you can file an Affidavit for Correction of a Record 
(form VS-608) with Health Analytics & Vital Records instead of using the court change of 
name procedure.2  The VS-608 form can also be used to add a first name if none was 
given at birth.  The VS-608 correction procedure can be used only to make a record 
more accurate and complete.3  It cannot be used to make discretionary changes in first 
or middle names, or any changes in the last name. 

• 

If you do not have the consent of both parents to this change, it may be helpful to talk 
with an attorney.

2 This if only for birth certificates issued in Alaska.  Other states may have similar procedures, but you 
must contact them directly for more information.

How to File 

 
Safety Note: 
The court will normally post a public notice about a change of name request on the Alaska 
Court System’s legal notice website.  However, if you have personal safety concerns about this 
public posting, you can ask the judge to waive (not have to do) this legal requirement.  In 
addition, you can ask that your case be kept confidential or that your name and the child’s 
name not be published in the case listed on the court’s public index (CourtView) on the internet.  
For more information, see Step 2 of these instructions or contact your local court clerk. 

Fill out the petition form, the consent form, and the vital records report form. 

Petition to Change Child's Name (CIV-694). 

On the "AT" line at the top of the form, write the city where the court you will be 
filing at is located. 

Leave the "CASE NO." line blank.  The court clerk will assign the number and fill 
this in once you file with the court. 

On the "A Minor Child" line and in section 1, write the current legal name of the 
child.  Look at the child’s original birth certificate to make sure that you are 
spelling the child’s current legal name exactly as it appears on the certificate.  
Check that any punctuation marks such as dashes and periods are exactly the 
same also.  You may not be able to get a birth certificate with the child’s new 
name from Health Analytics and Vital Records if the current name submitted to 
the court does not exactly match existing records.  If the child does not have a 
middle name, leave the line blank (do not write “N/A” or “none”). 

On the "Petitioner" line, write your current legal name.   

Fill out the rest of the form.  Wait to sign the form until you are in front of a 
notary.  A court clerk can provide this notary service for you (at no charge) when 
you bring the petition to court.  You must bring a photo ID with you for the 
notarization. 
 
Parental Consent from Non-Petitioning Parent (CIV-695). 

Fill out the form and have the other parent sign it in front of a notary public or 
court clerk.  The other parent will need to bring a photo ID for the notarization. 

If the other parent refuses to sign the consent or cannot be located, see Step 8 
below. 
 
Application for Legal Name Change (VS-405). 

Fill  in  items  1  through  7.    Sign  and  date  the  form  where  it  asks  for  applicant’s 
signature and date.  The court clerk will fill in items 8 through 11, and also sign 
and date the bottom of the form. 

b. 

c. 

If you have concerns about the personal safety of the child if the proposed name 
change is posted publicly, you can ask the court to waive posting (that is, not require 
that it be posted).  Fill out Request to Waive Posting in Child’s Change of Name Case 
(form CIV-709) and attach it to your petition when you file the case.  This form also 
asks whether you want your case to be confidential or sealed, and whether you want 
the court to use “Not Published” for your name and/or the child’s name on public

CourtView.  The form explains in more detail what each of these requests means.  Only 
fill out page 1; page 2 is for the judge.  You can get this form notarized at the same 
time as your petition.   

The court may decide the request based only on what you wrote on the form, or the 
court may schedule a hearing to decide your request(s).  At this hearing, the court will 
only decide whether or not to grant a waiver of public posting and/or grant any requests 
for confidentiality.  This hearing will not approve the name change itself. 

If you file form CIV-709 at the same time as you open your case, then your case will not 
be public when it is opened, and the clerk will not post the proposed name change on 
the court’s website, until after the judge makes a decision on your request.  If the judge 
grants your request, the case will stay unavailable to the public and the proposed name 
change will not be posted.  If the judge denies your request, the clerk will wait at least 
ten days before making your case public.  This is to give you time to decide whether you 
want to withdraw (cancel) your petition for the name change.  If you withdraw, the case 
will be closed and will not be public.  If you decide not to withdraw, then after the 
waiting period, the court clerk will schedule a hearing on the name change, and a notice 
will be posted on the website. 

If you file form CIV-709 after your case is already open, then the case will remain public 
until the judge makes a decision on your request(s).  If the judge grants the request(s), 
the court clerk will immediately remove it from public view.  If the judge denies the 
request, your case will proceed as usual.

Copies.  

tep 4.  

File in Court. 

Make a copy of the petition, the consent form, the vital records form, and any other 
attachments (such as form CIV-709) for yourself. 

File the originals of all forms in Step 3 at the nearest superior court filing location (see 
list on page 8).  Pay the filing fee.  Fee amounts are listed in Administrative Rule 9.  If 
you cannot afford the fee, ask the clerk for form TF-920, Request for Exemption from 
Payment of Fees. 

tep 5.  

Order for Hearing.   

The court clerk will give or mail to you an Order for Hearing, Posting, and Additional 
Service (form CIV-701).  This order will tell you (1) the date of your court hearing, (2) 
whether the court system will post notice,* and (3) whether or not you must make 
additional public posting or notify anyone else of your petition.  The hearing date must 
take place at least 40 days after the date of the order. 

If you did not file a consent form from the other parent (or a copy of that parent's 
death certificate), you will also need to get a summons from the clerk.  See Step 8 
below for what to do with the summons. 

tep 6.  

Posting Notice on Court’s Website.  [Unless waived for safety concerns.] 

The court will automatically post notice on the Alaska Court System’s legal notice 
website for four consecutive weeks, unless the court waived this requirement in a 
written order.*  After the posting, the clerk will file Clerk’s Certificate of Service of 
Posting (form TF-815) to the website.

The court may order you to do additional posting or notice.  Read your order (form CIV-
701) carefully to understand what the court is requiring you to do, including what proof 
you must provide that you completed it.  If you do not follow the court’s instructions, 
the child’s name change may be delayed or denied.  The following paragraphs describe 
in detail some common orders you may see, but you should follow the instructions on 
your order if they are different than the instructions below. 

a. 

Notice to a Person, Agency, or Other Entity. 

The order may tell you to give a copy of the notice to a specific person, agency, 
or entity (such as a corporation).  Unless the court gives you a specific method 
to do this, choose whichever method is likely to give the person actual notice.  
This could be mailing or emailing it to the person’s known work or home address, 
handing the person a physical copy, posting to a social networking account, or 
using a process server.  If the court orders you to use a specific method, then 
you must use that method.  Whichever method you use, once you have 
completed it, fill out Affidavit of Additional Service (form CIV-702).  The court 
may require you to provide a specific kind of proof of service, which you should 
attach to the affidavit.  File the original affidavit (and all attachments) with the 
court before the court hearing, or bring it with you to the hearing. 

b. 

Publication in a Print Newspaper.   

Take the order to the listed newspaper and tell the newspaper staff that you 
need to publish the "Notice of Petition to Change Name" (on page 2 of the order) 
in the legal notices section of their newspaper, once each week for four 
consecutive weeks before the date of the court hearing.  You will have to pay the 
newspaper for this service.  Do not wait to do this.  All four publications of the 
notice must happen before the court hearing.  After the notice has been 
published all four times, the newspaper will give you an "Affidavit of Publication" 
that will contain a copy of the published notice and the dates when it was 
published.  File this affidavit with the court before the court hearing, or bring it 
with you to the hearing. 

c. 

Posting to an Online Newspaper.   

Make copies of the notice and post it in the places listed in the order for the 
number of days stated in the order.  After posting is complete, get an affidavit of 
publication from the online publication’s publisher, manager, foreman, or 
principal clerk, or by the certificate of the attorney for the party at whose 
instance the service was made.  You must also get a printed copy of the posted 
notice with the name of the online publication and dates of posting.  Attach 
these documents to Affidavit of Additional Service (form CIV-702).  File the 
original affidavit with the court before the court hearing, or bring it with you to 
the hearing. 

d. 

Posting in Public Places.   

Make copies of the notice and post it in the places listed in the order for the 
number of days stated in the order.  After posting is completed, fill out Affidavit 
o
Additional Service (form CIV-702).  File the original affidavit with the court 
 
f
before the court hearing, or bring it with you to the hearing.

tep 8.  

Serve a Summons.  [Only if the other parent did not consent.] 

If you are the child’s parent, then you must serve (give or send) a summons to the 
other parent, unless at least one of the following is true: 

•  The other parent signed a consent (form CIV-695) that you filed with the court. 
•  The other parent is deceased, and you filed the death certificate with the court. 
•  The other parent’s parental rights have been terminated, and you filed a copy of 

the termination order with the court. 

If you are a legal guardian or other non-parent, then you must serve the summons on 
any parent who is not covered by at least one of the bullet points above. 

You should have already received the filled-out summons when you filed your petition, 
but if not, you can ask for one from the court clerk.  Serve all of the following 
documents together: 

•  Summons - Child's Change of Name (form CIV-697) 
•  a copy of your completed Petition to Change Child's Name (form CIV-694) 
•  a blank Parental Consent from Non-Petitioning Parent (form CIV-695), and 
•  a blank Objection to Change of Name (form CIV-696). 

You must serve all of these documents on the other parent at least 30 days before 
the hearing date.  You can do this either (1) by a process server, or (2) by certified mail 
with restricted delivery.  See How to Serve a Summons in a Civil Lawsuit (form CIV-106) 
for instructions on both these methods.  

If you cannot locate the other parent, see section 3 of How to Serve a Summons in a 
Lawsuit (form CIV-106) (pages 6-7) titled "Service by Posting or Other Alternative 
 
l
i
v
i
C
Service." 

After the documents have been served, you must file proof with the court that you did 
this.   

●  If you used a process server, the process server will give you a "Return of 

Service" that lists the documents served, who they were served on, and when 
they were served.  File this original "Return of Service" with the court.  Make a 
copy for yourself.   

●  If you used certified mail, give the court the original green card that you got 
back from the Post Office, showing that the certified mail was delivered to the 
other parent.  You can attach this green card to Affidavit of Additional Service 
(form CIV-702).  Make a copy of it for yourself. 

tep 9.  

Court Hearing.   

The hearing is usually short and fairly informal.  The judge will usually first make sure 
that any required notices and consents were done.  Then, tell the judge why you want 
to change the child's name.  If the child is old enough, the judge will ask the child about 
the name change.  There is not a specific age at which this is required under the law, 
therefore, it is a good idea to bring even very young children to the hearing, in case the 
judge wants to hear from them.  The judge will make sure that both parents agree to 
the change, and that everyone understands that the name change will not change any 
of the legal rights or responsibilities of the parents. 

If anyone objects to the change, the judge will let you respond to it.  If the objection is 
from a parent, the judge will then decide whether it is in the best interests of the child 
to allow the name change in spite of the objection.

Judgment for Change of Name.   

If the judge finds that the name change is not contrary to the public interest and that, if 
an objection was made, it is in the child’s best interest, the judge will sign a judgment 
allowing the child to take the new name.  However, you cannot begin using the new 
name yet, because the judgment will not be effective until the rest of these steps are 
completed. 

tep 11. 

Posting Notice of Judgment.  [Unless waived for safety concerns.]  

The court will automatically post notice on the legal notice website for one week, unless 
the court waived this requirement in a written order.  After the posting, the clerk will file 
erk’s Certificate of Service of Posting (TF-815) to the website. 
l
C

tep 12. 

Additional Service of Judgment.  [Only if ordered by the court.] 

The judge may order you to do additional posting or notice.  See Step 7 of these 
instructions for more information on this.  After you complete what the judge ordered 
you to do, fill out Affidavit of Additional Service (form CIV-702) and file the original with 
the court.  You must do this within 20 days of the date of the clerk’s distribution of 
the judgment. 

tep 13. 

Certificate of Name Change.  

Once any requirements in Steps 11 and 12 are complete, the clerk will send you 
Certificate of Name Change (form CIV-705).  If the judgment does not require additional 
service, then the clerk will issue this certificate automatically after the one-week posting 
on the court’s website, without waiting for any proof of posting from you. 

You can begin using the child's new name on the date stated in the Certificate of Name 
Change.  This date will be at least 30 days after the judgment was distributed.  The 
clerk will give you two copies of the certificate.  One will be a free certified copy.  If you 
need additional certified copies, there will be a charge for them.  See Administrative 
Rule 9 for current fees.

After changing the child's name, there are several records you will need to change: 

Records to Change 
 

Social Security.  To avoid tax problems and help assure proper employment credit, you 
should notify the Social Security Administration of the name change.  Toll free telephone 
number: 1-800-772-1213. 

Division of Motor Vehicles.  If the child has an Alaska driver's license or owns a vehicle 
registered in Alaska, you must send written notice of the name change to the Division of 
Motor Vehicles within 30 days.4  It is very important that you do this; the child could 
receive a citation and have to pay a fine, or even be charged with a crime under certain 
circumstances, if you fail to do this.  Contact a DMV office to find out how the division 
wants to receive written notice.  To get a new driver's license or Alaska ID Card, the 
child will need to go with you to a DMV office and present a certified copy of the 
Certificate of Name Change (form CIV-705). 

Vital Records.  If you want a new birth certificate for the child, contact the Vital Records 
office of the state in which the child was born and pay the required fee. 

Other  Records.    You  may  also  need  to  change  records  at  schools,  banks,  insurance 
companies, the Alaska PFD Division, etc. 

Statutes and Rules 

he Alaska Statutes and Alaska Court Rules about name changes for children are: 

•  Civil Rule 84, which establishes the procedure for changing names. 

•  Alaska Statute 09.55.010, which gives the superior court the power to hear these cases 
and sets the standard the court must use in deciding whether to grant a name change. 

You can find the rules and statutes at all state courts, court law libraries, and many city 
libraries.  

The court rules are online here: www.courts.alaska.gov/rules/index.htm

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
