ALASKA COURT’S AUTHORITY TO CHANGE CHILD SUPPORT 

This Alaska court has the authority to modify the other state’s child support order.   
The court’s authority comes from the Alaska Statute(s) below.  (Check all that apply.)   
 

 

a. 

AS 25.25.613 because:  

 

c. 

AS 25.25.611(a)(2) because:  

 

Both the obligor and obligee filed consents in the issuing tribunal 
providing that an Alaska tribunal may modify the support order and 
assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction  (See definitions of “obligor” and 
“obligee” in 4.b above.); and 

 

 

 

 

the children live in Alaska, or  

the court has personal jurisdiction over the obligor or obligee. 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                 
1   AS 09.05.015 defines “personal jurisdiction.”  In general, a state court has “personal jurisdiction” over 
a person if the person is (a) present in the state when served notice of the case, (b) domiciled in the 
state, or (c) engaged in substantial and not isolated activities in the state.   

2   Generally, “domicile” means a person’s primary residence to which the person intends to return 
whenever the person is away.  See, for example, AS 16.05.940 and AS 28.33.190.  The Alaska 
Supreme Court has held that, in divorce cases, domicile “is established by an actual physical presence 
in the state coupled with a coincident intent to make the state one's permanent place of abode.”   
See State v. Adams, 522 P.2d 1125 (Alaska 1974).

CHANGE IN CHILD SUPPORT 

NOTE: In order to get an increase or decrease in support payments because the income of the 
person making payments changes, that change in income must be long term and significant.  
The court will not modify a support order because of a small or temporary change in income.  
Generally, a change in income is significant if the change would raise or lower the support 
payments by 15% or more. You must attach documentation that supports your request.  
Examples include pay stubs, tax returns, and proof of Social Security or disability benefits. 

I  request  that  the  child  support  order  be  modified  to 
support amount because (check all boxes that apply): 

  increase   

  decrease  the 

The income of the person making the child support payments increased or 
decreased. (If you check this box, attach documentation of the increase or 
decrease and explain why it has occurred.) 
 

Support payments should be changed because there has been a change in the 
availability or cost of medical insurance for the children, or because medical 
expenses for the children have increased or decreased. (If you check this box, 
describe what the change should be and attach all available documents that 
support the requested change.) 
 

 

Other (Be specific and attach any supporting documents.) 

he court must use Alaska Civil Rule 90.3 to calculate the support amount.3  Therefore, you must 
also attach a completed Child Support Guidelines Affidavit (DR-305) to provide information the 
court needs.  Note:  An Alaska court cannot change the duration of another state’s child support 
order (the age of the child at which the duty of support ends) unless the laws of the state that 
issued the original order allows such a change.  AS 25.25.604(a)(1) and AS 25.25.611(c) and (d). 

MPORTANT NOTE:  If you think the amount of support should change because you 
are no longer following the current custody order, you may need to ask a court to 
modify your custody order.  Figuring out which state (court) has authority to modify 
your order can be complicated.  You may want to contact an attorney for help.  
Generally, Alaska courts will only issue a child support order that is based on a 
court-ordered custody arrangement.

Income Withholding. I understand that the court’s modification order must require 
that the support amount be immediately withheld from the obligor’s income unless one 
of the three exceptions4 below applies.   

 request that the court not order immediate income withholding because: 

  Alternative Payment Arrangement.   

The other parent and I agreed on the alternative payment arrangement5 
described in the attached document signed by both of us (and by CSSD if 
support has been assigned to the state); and 

 

if CSSD is enforcing the support order, CSSD entered this agreement into its 
record; and 

  an income withholding order has not been terminated previously and 

subsequently initiated; and 

the obligor agreed to keep the obligee (or CSSD if CSSD is enforcing the 
order) informed of the obligor’s current employer and the availability of 
employment-related health insurance coverage for the children until the 
support order is satisfied.  
 

  Not in Best Interests of Child(ren).   

Immediate income withholding is not in the child(ren)’s best interests because: 
 
 

 
; and 

the obligor made voluntary support payments under a court or agency order 
and has not been in arrears in an amount equal to the support payable for 
one month6; and 
the obligor agreed to keep the obligee (or CSSD if CSSD is enforcing the 
order) informed of the obligor’s current employer and the availability of 
employment-related health insurance coverage for the children until the 
support order is satisfied. 

  Obligor Receives other Compensation. 

The obligor is receiving Social Security or other disability compensation that 
includes regular payments to the child(ren) at least equal to the support owed 
each month.  To the extent these payments to the child(ren) do not satisfy the 
monthly amount owed, I request that the remaining amount due be immediately 
withheld from the obligor's income pursuant to AS 25.27.062.

obligee; advance payment of two months' support to the obligee as security for future payments; or 
an automatic funds transfer from the obligor's bank or employer to the obligee. 
“In arrears” means failing to make a support payment within 30 days of the monthly due date 
specified in the order.  AS 25.27.062(m)(2)(B).

1.  NOTICE OF MOTION (DR-710).  Fill out this form.  In the Certificate of Service at the 
bottom of the DR-710, you will fill in the date that you mail or deliver it and the other 
listed documents to the opposing parent. You must put this document on top of all the 
other documents when you mail or deliver them to the opposing parent.   

2.  SERVE COPY ON OTHER PARENT.  Complete the Certificate of Service on the next page, 

explaining how you delivered copies of everything you are filing to the other parent.  

3.  Copies.  Keep a copy of all documents and attachments for yourself. 

4.  Filing Location.  Mail or hand-deliver the original motion, the required attachments 

and the DR-710 Notice to the Alaska court where the out-of-state order was registered.   
There is no fee for filing these documents with the court.11  For a list of court mailing 
addresses, go to www.courts.alaska.gov/courtdir/index.htm.  
 

RESPONSE.  The other parent has 13 days to respond to your Motion to Modify.  The 
response must be filed with the court and a copy sent to you.  If 13 days pass and no 
response is filed, your motion will be sent to a judge for decision unless you filed your 
motion at the same time you registered the order in Alaska.  If the 20 days for opposing 
registration has not passed, the motion will probably not be sent to a judge for decision 
until the 20 days has passed.  

EPLY. If you receive a response, you have 8 days from the date it was postmarked to file 
your Reply with the court.  You may use the Reply form (DR-730) provided in this packet.  
Your Reply must be signed in front of a notary (available at the court at no charge).  You 
must serve your Reply on the same people as you did your motion. 

EARING.  The judge may order a hearing if one is needed to decide any disputes about the 
evidence in your case.  You will be notified if a hearing is scheduled.  If it will be difficult for 
you to attend the hearing in person, you may file a Request to Appear by Telephone (form 
TF-710). 

nforcement of Alaska Child Support Order.   If the court agrees to modify the other 

state’s child support order, the court will issue a new Alaska Child Support Order.  If the 
obligor does not comply with the court’s order, you may ask the Alaska Child Support 
Services Division (CSSD) to enforce the order for you.  See Application for Services of Child 
Support Services Division.  If you do not live in Alaska, you can ask your state’s child 
support agency to enforce the Alaska order.
