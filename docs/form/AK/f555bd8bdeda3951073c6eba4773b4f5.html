his packet 
is for step 2. 

tep 1 is a LEVEL 1 APPEAL to Aetna for health services or OptumRx for 

pharmacy services.  For level 1 appeals, use form HCA-100, Health Appeal Packet 
.  If your level 1 appeal is granted, then you won, and the process is finished.   
1
If your level 1 appeal is denied, then go to step 2.   

tep 2 will be either a LEVEL 2 APPEAL to Aetna or OptumRx, or a REQUEST 
FOR EXTERNAL REVIEW to Aetna, depending on the reason why your level 1 
appeal was denied.   

IMPORTANT!  Step 2 is a REQUEST FOR EXTERNAL REVIEW to Aetna if Aetna 
denied your level 1 appeal because Aetna thinks your provider ordered 
services that are not medically necessary, as defined in Section 3.5.1 of the 
PLAN.  Sometimes Aetna denies claims as not medically necessary because 
you or your provider did not request pre-certification.  

-OR- 

  Step 2 is a LEVEL 2 APPEAL to Aetna for health services or OptumRx for 

pharmacy services if your level 1 appeal was denied for a reason different 
than medical necessity.  Here are some examples: 

  Aetna thinks your doctor charged too much (“recognized charge”);  
  You used an out-of-network hospital in Anchorage; or 
  The PLAN does not cover the medical procedure or drug.

FIND THE LEVEL 1 DENIAL LETTER 

Find your 
Level 1 
denial letter 
from Aetna 
or Optum 
Rx. 

Aetna or OptumRx mailed you a letter explaining that your level 1 appeal was 
denied.  In that denial letter, Aetna or OptumRx should explain the reason why 
and what you can do next.   

IMPORTANT!!! 
  Was your level 1 appeal denied because the services or medications your 
provider ordered are not medically necessary?  (Look specifically in the 
denial letter for the words “medical necessity” or “medically necessary.”)  
If so, your next step is to file a REQUEST FOR EXTERNAL REVIEW 
which is basically an appeal of a medical necessity denial.  Aetna’s level 1 
denial letter will tell you this and give you a non-fillable form to use. You 
may instead use the court’s fillable version if you wish. If OptumRx’s 
denial letter says your next step is to request an external review, 
then email the healthcareadvocates@akcourts.us for more 
information.  

 

--or-- 
If Aetna or OptumRx denied your level 1 appeal for any reason different 
than medical necessity, your next step is to file a LEVEL 2 APPEAL. 

DEADLINE FOR SUBMITTING THE LEVEL 2 APPEAL 

When is my 
level 2 
appeal due? 

You have a limited amount of time to submit your level 2 appeal.  VERY 
IMPORTANT!!!  The deadline depends on the reason why your level 1 appeal was 
denied:   

 

 

If your level 1 appeal was denied because the services or medications are 
not medically necessary, then you have 4 months from the date of the 
level 1 denial letter to send your request for external review.   

If your level 1 appeal was denied for any reason different than medical 
necessity, then you have 180 days after the date you received Aetna’s or 
OptumRx’s level 1 denial letter to send in your level 2 appeal. 

Calculate your deadline using the date of the level 1 appeal denial letter. For a  
medical necessity denial, count ahead 4 months from the date of the denial letter.  
For a health claim denial, you may use the online date calculator available at: 
http://cgi.cs.duke.edu/~des/datecalc/datecalc.cgi. Type the date of the health 
claim denial letter as your start date, and then type 180 days as the number of 
days.  Then click “submit” to learn your deadline. There is an example at the top 
of the next page.

LEVEL 2 APPEAL OF MEDICAL NECESSITY DENIAL 
(Request for External Review) 

Prepare the 
request for 
external 
review. 

If your level 1 appeal was denied because the procedure or medication 
your provider recommended is not “medically necessary,” then request 
external review by following these 5 steps: 

1.  FOR LEVEL 1 DENIAL BY AETNA, USE FORM HCA-205.   
FOR LEVEL 1 DENIAL BY OPTUMRx, USE THE HCA-105 
Fill out all relevant sections.  Then sign and date it.  If you need more space to 
describe your request, use more pages and attach them.  If you do this, be 
sure you say “More Pages Attached.”  For examples of language you might use 
for a request for external review, email the healthcare advocates at 
HealthcareAdvocates@akcourts.us.  

IMPORTANT!!!  If you have more than one plan (such as both active and 
retiree plans), write all your member ID numbers on the form. 

2.  GATHER MEDICAL RECORDS FROM YOUR PROVIDER.  Decide what 

documents to include with your request for external review.  Sometimes you 
only need to re-send the same records you sent with your level 1 appeal.  
Other times, depending on what it says in the level 1 denial letter, you might 
want to add something else.   

Just because you already sent Aetna or OptumRx your medical records with 
your level 1 appeal, DO NOT ASSUME that they will include those records 
when they assign your case to an external review company.  Always make 
sure that you provide copies of your records and tell Aetna or OptumRx to give 
them to the external review company.  Check with the healthcare advocates if 
you need more information about this step: HealthcareAdvocates@akcourts.us.   

3.  MAKE A COPY FOR YOUR RECORDS OF ALL LEVEL 2 DOCUMENTS YOU WILL 
SUBMIT IN CASE YOU DECIDE TO APPEAL TO SUPERIOR COURT LATER. 

4.  SUBMIT YOUR REQUEST FOR EXTERNAL REVIEW.  Make sure to send it by fax 
with a confirmation sheet, or by U.S. mail with delivery confirmation to the 
number or address on the form.  You need to be able to prove that your 
request was received within the appeal deadline. 

5.  CONTACT FROM THE EXTERNAL REVIEW COMPANY.  Sometimes external 

review companies are also called “independent review organizations.”  Usually 
the external review company will mail you a letter telling you that it was

review. 

assigned to your appeal and invite you to submit any more information you 
think will be helpful.  Just in case Aetna (or OptumRx) fails to send your 
records, you may send the external review company every medical record or 
statement from your provider that you think will help them do their review.   

Aetna or OptumRx will mail you a letter with the results of any external review.    
The external review company will also mail you a copy of the letter.  The letter will 
either overturn or uphold the Level 1 denial.   

If the external review company overturns the level 1 denial, it means that you won 
your appeal.  If the external review company upholds Aetna’s denial, it means you 
did not win the appeal.  Also, your next step depends on when the services or 
supplies were received (remember, the Plan changed in 2018):  

 

 

If your appeal is about services or supplies received on or after January 
1, 2018, then your next step is to file a Level 3 appeal to DRB.  Use form 
HCA-300, Health Appeal Packet 3, or email the healthcare advocates at 
HealthcareAdvocates@akcourts.us. 

--or-- 

If your appeal is about services or supplies received before 2018, then 
your next step is to appeal directly to Superior Court.  Use form HCA-400, 
Health Appeal Packet 4, or email the healthcare advocates at 
healthcareadvocates@akcourts.us.  

LEVEL 2 APPEAL OF HEALTH CLAIM DENIAL 

Prepare the 
level 2 
appeal. 

If Aetna or OptumRx denied your level 1 appeal, and the reason for 
denial was not about “medical necessity,” you can file a level 2 appeal 
by following these 5 steps:  

1.  FILL OUT FORM HCA-105 to prepare your level 2 appeal.  (This is the same 
form you used for your level 1 appeal.)  Fill out each section that applies.  
Then sign and date the last page, and fill in your contact information. 

For examples of language you might use for an appeal of a denied health 
claim, email the healthcare advocates: HealthcareAdvocates@akcourts.us.  

2.  GATHER MEDICAL RECORDS FROM YOUR PROVIDER.  Decide what 

documents to include with your level 2 appeal.  Sometimes you only need to 
re-send the same records you sent with your level 1 appeal.  Other times, 
depending on what Aetna said in its level 1 denial letter, you might want to 
add something else.  Check with your provider or the healthcare advocates if 
you need more information about this step. 

3.  MAKE A COPY FOR YOUR RECORDS OF ALL LEVEL 2 DOCUMENTS THAT YOU 
SUBMIT IN CASE YOU DECIDE TO APPEAL TO SUPERIOR COURT LATER.  

4.  SUBMIT YOUR LEVEL 2 APPEAL TO AETNA OR OPTUMRx.  Make sure to send 
your level 2 appeal by fax with a confirmation sheet, or by U.S. mail with 
delivery confirmation.  You need to be able to prove that Aetna or OptumRx 
received it within the appeal deadline. 

5.  KEEP TRACK OF YOUR LEVEL 2 APPEAL. Contact Aetna after about a month if 

you have not yet received a decision letter.

Learning the 
result of 
your level 2 
appeal. 

Aetna or OptumRx will mail you a letter with the results of your level 2 appeal.  If 
your level 2 appeal is denied, the letter will explain why and what to do next.   

 

 

If your appeal is about services or supplies received on or after January 1, 
2018, your next step is to file a Level 3 appeal to DRB.  Use form HCA-300, 
Health Appeal Packet 3, or email the healthcare advocates at: 
HealthcareAdvocates@akcourts.us.  

If your appeal is about services or supplies received before 2018, then your 
next step is to skip to Level 4.  Use form HCA-400, Health Appeal Packet 4 for 
appeals to superior court.

APPEAL OF HEALTH CLAIM OR PRECERTIFICATION DENIAL 
This form is for active employees (not retirees) of the Alaska Court System and their dependents who 
wish to appeal health claim or precertification denials by Aetna or OptumRx. 

WHAT LEVEL APPEAL IS THIS? 

For more information about appealing your claims, call DRB at 1-800-821-2251; or review the health plan at 
http://doa.alaska.gov/drb/alaskacare/employee/publications/booklet.html; or email the Healthcare Advocates at 
healthcareadvocates@akcourts.us. If you are not satisfied with the administrative appeal decisions, you may 
appeal to Superior Court.  See appeal form packets HCA-100, HCA-200, HCA-300, and HCA-400.] 
 

  Level 1 Appeal to 

 Aetna  

 OptumRx 

 Check this box if this is an urgent appeal

Check this box if this is your Level 1 (first) appeal of a claim denied in full or in part by Aetna for health 
services or OptumRx for drugs.  Level 1 appeals must be received by Aetna or OptumRx within 180 calendar 
days of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) “statement date” or denial letter.  You may use this online 
calculator to calculate the due date. 

  Level 2 Appeal to 

 Aetna  

 OptumRx 

 Check this box if this is an urgent appeal

Check this Level 2 box if all of these statements are true: 
a.  You are not satisfied with the level 1 appeal decision by Aetna or OptumRx; and 
b.  For Aetna claims only, Aetna’s level 1 decision was based on something other than Aetna’s “medical 

opinion” (for example, Aetna says your doctor’s charges are more than the “recognized charge,” or the 
service you received is not covered by the plan, or that they need more records from your doctor); and 

c.  You want to appeal to level 2. 
Level 2 appeals go to Aetna for denied health services or OptumRx for denied drugs, and must be received by 
Aetna or OptumRx within 180 calendar days of the date of the Level 1 decision.  You may use this online 
calculator to calculate the due date. 

  Level 2 Request for External Review to Aetna 

 Check this box if this is an urgent appeal

* 

Check this box if all of these statements are true: 
a.  You are not satisfied with the level 1 appeal decision by Aetna; and 
b.  Aetna’s level 1 decision was based on Aetna’s “medical opinion” or Aetna’s level 1 denial letter talks 

about “medical necessity” (for example, they say your procedure was not medically necessary, or it was 
experimental or investigational, or something else involving Aetna’s medical or clinical opinion); and 

c.  You want to request review by an independent external review company. 
Requests for external review must be submitted to Aetna no later than 4 months after you receive the level 1 
denial letter.  Aetna is supposed to send a copy of their form for requesting these but they don’t always do 
that.  If you do not receive a form from Aetna, use this form or form HCA-205 instead, or email the 
Healthcare Advocates. 

  Level 3 Appeal to DRB (new for 2018) 

 Check this box if this is an urgent appeal

* 

Check this box if all of these statements are true: 
a.  You are appealing denial of services or pre-service request provided on or after January 1, 2018; and 
b.  You are not satisfied with the level 2 appeal denied by Aetna or OptumRx, or you are not satisfied with 

the external review by Aetna; and 

c.  You want to appeal to level 3. 
Level 3 only applies to services received after 2017.  For services received before 2018, skip level 3 and go 
directly to level 4 (appeal to superior court).  Level 3 appeals go to the Division of Retirement & Benefits

WHAT CLAIMS ARE BEING APPEALED?
AETNA APPEALS: When a doctor sends  a bill to Aetna for payment, Aetna creates an “explanation of benefits” 
(EOB) statement. Find EOBs at https://www.Aetna.com/ after logging in.  Every EOB has a statement date in the 
top right corner of the 1st page; and every claim on the EOB has a claim ID number.  Every letter from Aetna 
denying precertification has a case number.   OPTUMRx APPEALS: You will learn of an OptumRx denial because 
your pharmacist tells you or you receive a denial letter from OptumRx.  There may or may not be a case number, 
but try and fill out the information below.  For more information, email HealthcareAdvocates@akcourts.us.

DATA AND DOCUMENTS REQUESTED AS PART OF THIS APPEAL 

Recognized charge.  This paragraph applies if my claim(s) were denied in whole or part as above the 
“recognized charge.”  The database used for setting the recognized charge is inconsistent with any usual, 
customary, reasonable, or prevailing rate in the geographic area where the services were performed.  The 
plan relies on data from a database known to be incomplete, inaccurate, and indefensible.  I request the 
following as part of my appeal:  (1) For each of the past 36 months, how many actual claims were submitted 
by Alaska providers on behalf of active and retired AlaskaCare plan members for each of the same CPTs or 
medications denied in whole or part as above the recognized charge in my claim?  And of these actual 
claims submitted, how many were denied in whole or part as above the recognized charge?  (2) Which 
FairHealth update (May or November, and of what year) was used to process the claims I am appealing?  (3) 
Was “derived data” used to determine the recognized charge for my claims?  If so, for each CPT or 
medication, how many frequencies were in the database on the date my claims were processed and what 
were the actual provider charge amounts and dates of each of those frequencies?  (4) Provide me with a 
copy of all correspondence between any employee of the Alaska Dept. of Administration and any employee 
of Aetna or OptumRx about any of the following: FairHealth, any rate-setting database other than 
FairHealth, and Aetna’s or OptumRx’s reimbursement policies and practices regarding the recognized charge 
or similar rate-setting tool or process.  (5)  Provide a copy of the contract or letter of agreement between 
Alaska and Aetna, or for pharmacy claims between Alaska and OptumRx in effect on the dates of service 
associated with my claims.  (6) Identify the Medicare reimbursement rate in effect on the dates of service 
for the CPTs or medications at issue in my claim.  (7) Identify and provide a copy of every other document or 
source of information other than the FairHealth database that was used to process my claims.  

Proprietary guidelines or clinical policy bulletins.  This paragraph applies if my claim or claims were denied 
because of information in proprietary documents or guidelines (for example, the MCG Guidelines or the 
Milliman Medicare Repricer) or a clinical policy bulletin.  Please follow all necessary protocols and promptly 
release the documents and guidelines to me because they are being used to my detriment.   

.  Medical records.  This paragraph applies if my medical records were overlooked or ignored by Aetna or 

OptumRx or its external review organization in making the adverse benefit determination referenced in this 
appeal.  Provide a copy of my medical records (1) in Aetna’s  or OptumRx’s possession or control whether or 
not used to process my claim, and (2) actually reviewed or used by Aetna’s or OptumRx’s system, external 
review organization, or employee to process my claim.  In addition, if Aetna’s or OptumRx’s system 
processed my claim, I ask that this appeal and my future claims be processed by a human instead.   

Network steerage.  This paragraph applies if my claim(s) were denied in whole or part as out of network.  
Provide all information used in determining that my provider was out of network.  If non-network facility 
penalties were applied to my claim(s), confirm that the penalties were applied pursuant to my plan(s) and 
the law, and for facilities in Anchorage or the other 49 states. 

Other information requested:

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
