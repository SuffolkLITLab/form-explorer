“Consider Truth” (3rd Floor) “Consider Freedom” (4th Floor)
“Consider  Justice”  (5th  Floor)  “Consider  Truth”  (6th  Floor)

“Consider Justice”

These  stained  glass  windows  located  in  lobbies  of  ﬂ oors 
three  through  six,  were  created  by  Vivienne  McConnell  of 
Chugiak,  Alaska,  in  collaboration  with  Valerie  Collins  of 
Schuylerville, New York.  Upper “transom like” windows were 
selected for artwork to create an ornamental band in lobby  
areas that create patterns of light and color on the ﬂ oor and 
walls  of  the  space 
remaining 
while 
the 
safely  out  of 
public’s  reach.    The 
designs  capture  the 
architectural  themes 
of the building and echo the ribbon shapes in the sidewalk 
to create movement through the spaces.  Each ﬂ oor has its 
own color palette and the colors used from ﬂ oor to ﬂ oor share 
hues that are used throughout the building.  The intensity of 
the bold, deep and vibrant colors is offset by the architectural 
clear glass in each of the designs.

Most artworks in the Nesbett Courthouse were funded through 
the Anchorage 1% for Public Art program.

CERAMIC TILES
“Treaty of Cession” (1867)

Courthouse Exterior Clock
“On and On”

Prior  to  demolishing  the  original  courthouse  located  at 
845  W.  Fourth  Avenue,  the  three  ceramic  mosaics  were 
removed and restored by Dave and Rich Welsh of W & W 
Company of Alaska.  The restoration project took 250 man 
hours  to  complete.   The  original  design  was  conceived  by 
Buell Nesbett, the court’s ﬁ rst Chief Justice.  The triptych is 
located in the basement of the Nesbett Courthouse.

The  exterior  clock  was  designed  and  constructed  by  local 
artist  D.  Lowell  Zercher.    The  artist  states  “the  design 
was  achieved  by  playing  with  a  traditional  clock  face  and 
developing an interesting geometric interplay to denote the 
hours.  The ring is the unifying feature of the clock and alludes 
to the continuity of time.  The color scheme complements the 
building with the granite face used to unite the clock to the 
facade  and  the  color  black  chosen  to  mimic  the  ﬂ ecks  in 
the surrounding granite.  Bronze used for the triangles and 
hands give the verdigris color.  The point colors for the ring tie 
the other colors together and give the clock a contemporary 
feel.”

Scenes  of  native  whale  hunting,  the  purchase  of  Alaska 
from Russia in 1867, and statehood commemorate Alaska’s 
past.    The  Venetian  glass  tiles  were  designed  by Armond 
Kirschbaum and produced by Alaska Art Tile in 1963.

“Tied to Time”

D. Lowell Zercher created this  clock to 
personify  the  “Alaskan  Sourdough”  in 
the big city.  The log cabin symbolized 
the origin of the person and the “zippy” 
tie  depicts  the  sourdough’s  personal 
sense of style.

Eskimo.    The  theme

are  suspended from the ceiling using high strength aircraft 
cable.

Bill  Brody’s  1992  painting  “Rain  Coming”  depicts  the 
landscape  of  the Arctic  National  Wildlife  Refuge.    Desiring 
to  share  the  beauty  of  this  vibrant  painting  with  the  public, 
Justice Dana Fabe graciously donated it to the Alaska Court 
System while serving as Chief Justice.

Lobby Clocks

Main Lobby

D.  Lowell  Zercher  has  created  an  assortment  of  clocks 
located  near  the  elevators  on  all  but  the  ﬁ rst  ﬂ oor.    Using 
combinations  of  mixed  media  (i.e.,  woods,  metals,  plastics 
and  paints)  the  artist  has  produced  both  whimsical  and 
stately pieces.  Using interesting shapes, texture, and color 
the artist engages the viewer with these beautifully crafted, 
“friendly” clocks that puzzle and amuse.

Basement
“Tay Unit”

This  clock  is  designed  to  depict  a 
child  holding  up  his  or  her  arms  in  an 
expression  of  happiness  or  searching.  
The  child  is  stylized  with  primary  and 
secondary  colors  to  make  it  lively  and 
remind  the  viewer  of  those  early  years 
of childhood innocence.

Second Floor
“Does Anybody Really Care”

This is a traditional clock face in a very 
untraditional design.  By shifting the split 
face it forces you to look at the clock in 
a different way, if for nothing else than 
to  tell  time.    The  artwork  explores  the 
interplay between hard crisp lines with 
smooth wavy lines and uses contrasting 
woods to create rhythm.

Five  bronze  plaques  with  the  U.S.  Consititution  and  the  Bill 
of Rights inscribed on them enhance the stately space below 
the  ascending  staircase  in  the  lobby.    The  plaques  were 
created  by  the  American  Spirit  Foundation  and  generously 
donated by Jon C. Conner in honor of Superior Court Judge 
Karl Johnstone.

his contributions and service 
to the Alaska Court System.

Jury Assembly Room

Display Cases

Three cherry wood display cabinets adorn the jury assembly 
space enhancing the public’s knowledge of the history of the 
justice system in Alaska.  One exhibit 
is dedicated to the pioneering women 
lawyers of our state and introduces 
several of the ﬁ rst women to be sworn 
into  the  Alaska  Bar  Association.  
Another  display  honors  40  years 
of  service  by  Honorable  James  M. 
Fitzgerald  and  Honorable  James 
A.  Von  Der  Heydt,  two  of  Alaska’s 
 rst judges.  The remaining cabinet 
ﬁ
the 
contains  artifacts  portraying 
development of the courts, judicial districts, and organization 
of the courts.  Photos of all judges and magistrates currently 
serving  from  all  districts  are  showcased.    Recognition  of 
programs such as the wellness court and mental health court, 
implemented by our justice system, are commended for being 
creative solutions toward reducing recidivism.

Display Boards

The Alaska Bar Association’s 100th anniversary, 1896 - 1996, 
is celebrated in 3 display boards which cover the early days 
of justice in Alaska.  Settlement of the state, creation of the 
Alaska Bar Association, and the growth of the Alaska Court 
System are historically illustrated by this project produced by 
the Bar’s Historians’ Committee.

Third Floor
“Mover/Shaker”

The  personas  behind  this  clock 
are those people who do business 
in  the  city  in  areas  that  are  often 
nicely  furnished,  traditional  and 
“uptown”.    This  “uptown”  part  is 
shown  by  the  curly  walnut  and 
brass.  These movers and shakers 
make  things  happen.    This  is

Description of Artworks

Fifth Floor
“Pacesetter”

This  is  a  contemporary  remake  of  a 
traditional  style  clock  that  would  have 
been  found  historically  in  courthouses.  
The  contemporary  inﬂ uence  gives  it  a 
stronger  presence  by  incorporating  the 
rich  Sopele  Pomele  wood  of  the  body 
with accents of brass and ebony.  It still 
has the comforting feeling of the swinging 
pendulum  although  in  this  case  it  does 
not actually regulate the time.

Sixth Floor
“About Time”

This  clock  is  a  display  of  luxurious 
materials:  Australian lace-wood and 
gold in a pleasing arrangement with 
the bisecting V-shaped design layout 
to  denote  the  hours  on  the  clock 
face.  It is an original shape clearly 
indicating that it is “About Time”. 

The Nesbett Courthouse, designed by local architectural firm 
McCool  Carlson  Green,  reflects  the  dynamic  relationship 
between the formal structure of the law and the humanity 
with  which  it  is  administered.   According  to  the  architect, 
“The  architectural  expression  of  the  courthouse  reflects 
and illuminates this complex interaction through contrasting 
formal  architectural  patterns,  natural 
and 
flowing  textures,  and  indigenous  cultural  expressions.  
Echoes  of  classical  form  and  organization  in  the  facade 
and interiors, in concern with traditional materials, creates 
an  appropriate  sense  of  dignity  and  fairness  linking  this 
facility with the grand traditions of courthouse design in the 
United States”.

Front Entry Totem Poles
“Attaining Balance Within”

These  twelve  and  one-half  foot,  red  cedar  totems  were 
created  by  Lee  Wallace,  a  Haida  Alaskan  Native  from 
Ketchikan, and his Tlingit apprentice carver, Edwin De Witt.  
The  totems  are  classic  Haida  style 
carvings of an Eagle and a Raven in full 
circular 360 degrees.  The artist states 
these  carvings  “...are  a  resplendent 
reminder of the convictions and power 
of  the  people  responsible  for  their 
own  destinies  and  compliment  the 
architect’s  vision  of  dignity,  authority 
and  permanence.    In  Haida  tradition, 
from  childhood  to  adulthood,  heirs 
understand  related  consequences  for 
actions and behaviors.  If an individual 
tilts the equilibrium, the offset affects society.  The judicial 
system  helps  individuals  and  determines  arrangements 
closely  resembling  a  satisfying  or  harmonious  position 
between extremes.”

The Eagle and Raven represent the reﬁ ned sense of balance 
which governs the clans, denotes integrity and adheres to 
the  laws  of  reciprocity.    In  Haida  tradition,  ancient  stories  
have echoed through generations to the most present times.  
These stories are retold to heirs needing understanding of 
natural and societal rules.  The Eagle and Raven carvings  
offer a sense of balance because they are equally powerful 
clan  emblems  of  greatness,  perpetuation,  ediﬁ cation,  and 
cultural signiﬁ cance.
