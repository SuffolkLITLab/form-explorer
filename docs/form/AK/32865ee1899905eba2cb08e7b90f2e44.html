This Alaska court has the authority to modify the other . . . . . authority comes from the Alaska Statute (s) below. . (Check all that apply. ) . a. AS 25. 25. 613 because: . . (1) . The person ordered to pay support (obligor. ) and the person who . should receive support (obligee) reside in Alaska; . and . (2) The children do . not. reside in the state that issued the order. . . b. AS 25. 25. 611 (a) (1) because: .

(check all that apply) : . The respondent is domiciled in Alaska; . 2 or The respondent got notice of registration of the support order . while present in Alaska and this motion will be served on the . respondent in Alaska; or . The respondent. is engaged in the substantial activities in . Alaska described below: . c.

CHANGE IN CHILD SUPPORT. NOTE: . In order to get an increase or decrease in support payments because the income of the . person making payments changes, that change in income must be long term and significant. . The court will not modify a support order because of a small or temporary change in income. . Generally, a change in income is significant if the change would raise or lower the support . payments by 15% or more. You must attach documentation that supports your request. . Examples include pay stubs, tax returns, and proof of Social Security or disability benefits. . I request that the child support order be modified to . increase . decrease the . support amount because (check all boxes that apply) : . The income of the person making the child support payments . increased or . decreased. . (If you check this box, attach documentation of the increase or . decrease and explain why it has occurred. . ) . Support payments should be changed because there has been a change in the . availability or cost of medical insurance for the children, or because medical . expenses for the children have increased or decreased. (. If you check this box, . describe what the change should be and attach all available documents that . support the requested change. . ) . Other (. Be specific and attach any supporting documents. . ) The court must use . Alaska Civil Rule 90. 3. to calculate the support amount. . 3 Therefore, you must . also attach a completed . Child Support Guidelines Affidavit. (DR 305) to provide information the . court needs. . Note: . An Alaska. . order (the age of the child at which the duty of support ends) unless the laws of the state that . issued the original order allows such a change. . AS 25. 25. 604 (a) (1) and AS 25. 25. 611 (c) and . (d) . . IMPORTANT NOTE: . If you think the amount of support should change because you . are no longer following the current custody order, . you may need to ask a court to . modify your custody order. . Figuring out which state (court) has authority to modify . your order can be complicated. You may want to contact an attorney for help. . Generally, Alaska courts will only issue a child support order that is based on a . court ordered custody arrangement. . 3 State v. Bromley. , 987 P. 2 d 183 (Alaska 1999) . . Page 5 of 9.

Income Withholding. . . . unless one . of the three exceptions. 4 below applies. . I request that the court . not. order immediate income withholding because: . Alternative Payment Arrangement. . The other parent and I agreed on the alternative payment arrangement. 5 described in the attached document signed by both of us (and by CSSD if . support has been assigned to the state) ; . and if CSSD is enforcing the support order, CSSD entered this agreement into its . . record; . and an income withholding order has not been terminated previously and . subsequently initiated; . and the obligor agreed to keep the obligee (or CSSD if CSSD is enforcing the . . employment related health insurance coverage for the children until the . support order is satisfied. . Not in Best Interest. s of Child (ren) . . . Immediate income withholding is not in the child (ren) . . best interests because: . ; . and the obligor made voluntary support payments under a court or agency order . and has not been in arrears in an amount equal to the support payable for . one month. 6; and the obligor agreed to keep the obligee (or CSSD if CSSD is enforcing the . . employment related health insurance coverage for the children until the . support order is satisfied. . Obligor Receives other Compensation. . The obligor is receiving Social Security or other disability compensation that . includes regular payments to the child (ren) at least equal to the support owed . each month. To the extent these payments to the child (ren) do not satisfy the . monthly amount owed, I request that the remaining amount due be immediately . withheld from the obligor's income pursuant to AS 25. 27. 062. . . . 4 AS 25. 27. 062 (m) . . 5 F. . obligee; advance payment of two months' support to the obligee as security for future payments; or . an automatic funds transfer from the obligor's bank or employer to the obligee. . 6 . . specified in the order. .
