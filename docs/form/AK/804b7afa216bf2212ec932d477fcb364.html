APPEAL.    In  general,  an  appeal  is  when  a  higher  court  reviews  a  lower  court's 
final decision or judgment.  These instructions are specific to when the superior 
court reviews the decision or judgment of the district court.  An appeal is not 
a  new  trial.    You  cannot  present  any  new  evidence  to  the  superior  court.   The 
only information that the superior court will consider on appeal is: 

1. 

2. 

3. 
4. 

the electronic recording of the district court trial or hearing, including 
witness testimony; 
any exhibits (documents, photographs, videos, or physical items) offered 
as evidence in the district court; 
the documents in the court file; and  
legal briefs and memoranda filed in the appeal.2 

APPELLANT.  The appellant is the party who files the appeal. 

APPELLEE.  The appellee is the party who defends against the appeal. 

I. 

COPIES TO OTHER PARTIES 

The court rules require each party to  give a copy  of any document that the party  files 
with the court to all other parties.3  You can give the documents to the other party by 
hand-delivering or mailing the documents.  You can also email or fax a copy if the other 
party agreed to this type of service.  For every document that you file, you must include 
a signed statement that  you gave a copy  to the other parties.  This  is called  “proof of 
service.”    The  court  forms  include  a  certificate of  service  section.   Make  sure  that  you 
always complete this section before you file the form with the court.  If another party is 
represented by an attorney, you must serve the attorney instead of the party. 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILING AN APPEAL 
FROM THE DISTRICT COURT  
TO THE SUPERIOR COURT1 

Appellate Rules 601-612 govern appeals to the superior 
court.  Appeals are complicated, and you may want to 
talk to a lawyer before you start this process.

1  District  court  cases  that  may  be  appealed  to  the  superior  court  include  formal  civil  cases,  small 
claims, traffic and other minor offenses, criminal cases on the “merits” (that is, issues other than just 
the sentence the defendant received), and certain types of sentences in criminal cases.  In a criminal 
or minor offense case, you can appeal the district court’s decision to either the superior court or the 
court of appeals.  These instructions discuss only the procedures for an appeal to the superior court.  
The  procedures  for  appealing  to  the  court  of  appeals  are  different.    You  may  want  to  contact  an 
attorney if you wish to appeal to the court of appeals.  Also see footnote  4 on the next page about 
petitions to the Supreme Court for review of sentences in criminal cases.

III.  HOW TO FILE AN APPEAL 

A. 
 

Who May File. 
1. 

Criminal Sentence Appeal from the District Court 
If  a  defendant  is  convicted  of  a  misdemeanor  in  district  court  and  is 
sentenced to serve more than 120 days in jail, the defendant may file a 
sentence  appeal  arguing  that  the  sentence  is  excessive.4    Note  that  the 
superior court is allowed to increase the sentence in this type of appeal, 
so defendants should think very carefully about their chances of winning 
the appeal before filing. 

All Other Appeals from the District Court 
Any party may file an appeal when that party believes that (a) the district 
court applied the law incorrectly, and/or (b) the judge’s or jury’s decision 
was not supported by the evidence presented. 

 

2. 

B. 

When to File.   

 

You  must  file  a  notice  of  appeal  within  30  days  from  the  date  shown  in  the 
clerk's certificate of distribution at the bottom of the judgment or final order.5  If 
you want to file a notice of appeal after the 30 days, you must ask the court for 
permission to accept it.  You can use Request and Order (form AP-135) for this.  
Your request  must  explain  why  your appeal  notice  is late.  File your request  to 
accept the late notice at the same time you file your notice of appeal. 

C. 
 

How to File.   
1. 

Notice.   
File  Notice of Appeal  (form  AP-100)  with  the  superior  court.    Attach  a 
copy of the district court judgment or order that you are appealing.6  You 
must file the appeal in the same judicial district as the district court that 
heard your case and in a location that would “best serve the convenience 
of the parties.”7   
Filing Fee.   
a. 

When you file, you will be required to pay a $250 filing fee ($100 
if the appeal is from small claims court).  Make your check or 
money order payable to "Clerk of Court." 
 
If  you  cannot  afford  to  pay  the  filing  fee,  file  Request for 
Exemption from Payment of Fees (form TF-920) asking the court 
to waive it.   

 
b. 

-OR- 

 

 

2. 

 

 

 
 
4   A misdemeanor defendant sentenced to serve 120 days or less in jail may ask for review of the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sentence by filing a petition for review in the supreme court.  The supreme court may or may not 
agree to review the sentence.  The procedures for filing this petition are described in Appellate Rules 
403(h) and 215.  A notice of intent to file this petition must be filed with the clerk of the appellate 
courts within 10 days after the date shown in the clerk's certificate of distribution at the bottom of 
the judgment.  If the judgment was mailed to you, you have an additional three days to file your 
notice.  You may want to contact an attorney for help if you wish to do this.

The  purpose  of  this  bond  is  to  make  sure  the  appellee’s  appeal 
costs will be reimbursed by you if you lose your appeal or if your 
appeal is dismissed.  

IMPORTANT  NOTICE:  Filing  a  cost  bond  will  not  stop  the 
creditor  from  seizing  your  property  or  money  to  collect  the 
judgment.    To  stop  execution  of  the  judgment,  you  must  file  a 
supersedeas bond as described in paragraph c on the next page. 

To  meet  the  cost  bond  requirement,  you  can  either  file  a  surety 
bond or make a cash deposit: 

Surety Bond.  This is a document that guarantees payment 
of money if certain things occur.  The person or company 
that  writes  the  bond  is  called  the  surety.    The  surety 
guarantees  the  payment  by  becoming  responsible  for  it.  
Such  bonds  are  generally  available 
insurance 
companies or third parties qualified to write surety bonds.  
There  will  be  a  fee.    The  court  system  does  not  provide 
forms for surety bonds.  

from 

Cash  Deposit.    If  you  want  to  make  a  cash  deposit  with 
the  court  instead  of  filing  a  surety  bond,  complete  Cash 
Deposit on Appeal  (form AP-110).  Check the first box on 
the  form,  fill  out  the  rest  of  it,  acknowledge  it  before  a 
court  clerk or notary public,  and give it to the clerk along 
with your money. 

b. 

Motion to Waive or Reduce Cost Bond. 

The  cost  bond  is  $750  unless  the  superior  court  fixes  a  lesser 
amount.8    If  you  think  this  amount  is  too  high  because  the 
expected  appeal  costs  (including  attorney  fees)  for  the  appellee 
will be a lot less than $750, you may file: 

(1) Motion to Waive or Reduce Cost Bond (form AP-120). 
(2) Order Re Cost Bond (form AP-130).  Only fill out the top part of 
the AP-130 (the case caption).  The judge will fill out the rest.

3. 

Bond.   

You do not need to file a bond for criminal or minor offense appeals.  In 
appeals  from  civil  and  small  claims  cases,  you  must  file  one  of  the 
following at the time you file your notice of appeal: 

•  a $750 cost bond 
•  a motion to waive or reduce cost bond 
•  a supersedeas bond

If  you  believe  you  cannot  afford  to  post  a  $750  cost  bond,  you 
may file:  

(1) Motion to Waive or Reduce Cost Bond (form AP-120). 
(2) Order Re Cost Bond (form AP-130).  Only fill out the top part of 
the AP-130 (the case caption).  The judge will fill out the rest. 

 

(3) Financial Statement (form CR-206).  

The court will notify you of its decision.  If the court orders you to 
post a cost  bond, you must  file a surety bond or cash deposit in 
the amount set by the court or your appeal will be dismissed.   

c. 

Supersedeas Bond.   

 

 

 

 

If you want the court to  “stay”  (stop)  execution of the judgment 
against  you  while  your  appeal  is  pending,  you  must  file  a 
supersedeas  bond  in  the  district  court  (the  same  court  that 
issued  the  judgment  or order  you  are  appealing).   A  stay  means 
that  the  court  will  not  issue  any  court  orders  (called  "writs  of 
execution") allowing your money  or property  to be seized to pay 
the judgment. 

The  purpose  of  this  bond  is  to  make  sure  that  the  appellee's 
appeal costs will be reimbursed by you and that the judgment will 
be  paid  by  you  if  you  lose  your  appeal  or  if  your  appeal  is 
dismissed. 

The supersedeas bond is 125% of the monetary amount of the 
district court judgment.9  File Request for Approval of 
Supersedeas Bond in District Court Case (form AP-116) in the 
same district court that entered the judgment or order you are 
appealing.  You must serve on the appellee a copy of both the 
request for approval and proof that you deposited the bond.  The 
district court will notify you of its decision.  Note: give a copy of 
this paperwork to the superior court at the same time you file 
your notice of appeal. 

The stay becomes effective the day the bond is approved.  Before 
the bond is approved, or if the bond is not approved, there is no 
stay  and  the  creditor  may  request  an  execution  against  your 
money or property.  

To meet the supersedeas bond requirement, you may either file a 
surety bond or make a cash deposit: 

(1) 

 

Surety Bond.  This is a document that guarantees payment 
of money if certain things occur.  The person or company 
that  writes  the  bond  is  called  the  surety.    The  surety 
guarantees  the  payment  by  becoming  responsible  for  it.  
Such  bonds  are  generally  available 
insurance 
companies or third parties qualified to write surety bonds.  
There  will  be  a  fee.    The  court  system  does  not  provide 
forms for surety bonds.

(2) 

Cash Deposit.  If you want to make a cash deposit with the 
court  instead  of  filing  a  surety  bond,  complete  Cash 
Deposit on Appeal  (form  AP-110).    Check  the  second  box 
on the form, fill out the rest of it, acknowledge it before a 
court clerk or notary public, and give it to the district court 
clerk along with your money.  

If  you  think  the  expected  appeal  costs  (including  attorney  fees) 
for  the  appellee  will  be  a  lot  less  than  25%  of  the  judgment 
amount,10 you may ask the court to reduce this percentage.  You 
can use Request and Order (form AP-135) for this. 

If  you  believe  you  cannot  afford  to  post  125%  of  the  judgment 
amount,  you  may  ask  the  court  to  reduce  or  waive  the  entire 
amount  of  the  supersedeas  bond.    You  can  use  Request and 
Order  (form  AP-135)  for  this.    You  must  also  include  Financial 
Statement (form CR-206) if your request is based on your inability 
to pay. 

The  court  will  notify  you  of  its  decision.    If  the  court  orders  a 
supersedeas  bond  to  be  posted,  you  must  file  a  surety  bond  or 
cash  deposit  in  the  amount  set  before  the  judgment  will  be 
stayed. 

d. 

Return of Bond. 

After the appeal is decided, the court will send all parties a notice 
that the bond will be released unless there is an objection.  If you 
lose  your  appeal, the  appellee  may  file  an  objection  and  request 
that  the  bond  be  applied  to  the  appellee's  costs  and  to  pay  the 
judgment.  If the appellee doesn’t file an objection, the court will 
return your cash deposit to you. 

V.  WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOUR APPELLATE CASE IS OPENED 

A. 

Assignment of Judge. 

After you have opened your appellate case, the court will notify you of the name 
of the judge assigned to hear it.  You have the right to a “peremptory challenge” 
(to ask for a different judge) one time only, without giving a reason.  If you do 
this, you will be randomly assigned a different superior court judge to hear the 
appeal.  Use Notice of Change of Judge (form TF-935).  You must file this notice 
within five days of being notified of the assigned judge.   

B. 

Briefing Schedule.   

A  “legal brief”  is a document  that  you write to explain  your side of the case to 
the judge.  In an appeal to the superior court from the district court, you may file 
a “legal memorandum” instead, which is less formal than a brief.  When the case 
is  ready  for  briefing,  the  court  will  send  you  and  the  appellee  Notice Setting 
Appeal Procedure (form AP-305).  This notice will tell you the time schedule for 
filing legal memoranda and requesting oral argument.   
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10   The first 100% of the supersedeas bond amount is to cover the amount of the judgment itself.  The 

extra 25% is to cover the potential costs of an appeal. 

AP-200 (4/22)

  I

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 

 

 

 
 
 
 

 

You  must  file  a  memorandum  or  brief  within  the  time  limit  set  by  the  court’s 
notice.  If you do not, your appeal may be dismissed.  If you can’t file within the 
time limit, file Request and Order (form AP-135) asking the court for more time.   

If you want to file a formal brief, see Appellate Rules 212(c) and 513.5 for details 
about  format  and  content.    The  rules  for  briefs  are  complicated  and  are  not 
explained in detail in these instructions. 

a. 
b. 
c. 
d. 

a statement of the issues you want the court to review  
a summary of the facts of the case  
a discussion of the law and its application to the facts  
a short conclusion explaining what you want the court to order  

If you choose to file the less formal memorandum, it must include:11 
 
 
 
 
Your memorandum must be typed or written (using black ink), double-spaced on 
8.5" x 11" white paper.  Number all of the pages except for the cover.  Only type 
or write on one side of each page.  Your initial memorandum must be no longer 
than  20  pages.    If  the  appellee  files  a  brief  or  memorandum  in  response,  you 
have the option (but are not required)  to  file a reply  memorandum, addressing 
any  new points brought up  in the appellee’s  memorandum or brief.   Your  reply 
memorandum must be no longer than 10 pages.  Appellant Memorandum Cover 
Sheet  (form  AP-160)  may  be  used  as  the  cover  of  your  memorandum.    It  is 
available  as  a  fillable  form  online.   It  is  also  included  as the  last  page  of  these 
instructions, which you may detach and fill out by hand. 

For a complete description of the requirements for your memorandum, including 
rules about fonts and margins, see Appellate Rules 513.5 and 605(b). 

To help you prepare your memorandum, you may want to listen to an electronic 
recording of the district court proceedings.  You can get a copy of the electronic 
recording  by  filing  a  records  request  with  the  appropriate  court  (see 
http://courts.alaska.gov/trialcourts/index.htm#recs  for  more  information).    You 
must pay $20 per electronic recording.12  You should make this request as soon 
as possible, because it may take several days to prepare your recording. 

Send  a  copy  of  your  memorandum  (or  brief)  to  the  appellee.    You  must  show 
proof  that  you  did  this  by  filling  out  and  filing  a  certificate  of  service.    This 
certificate is already included on the sample memorandum cover (form AP-160).  

C. 

Oral Argument.   

“Oral argument” is when you explain your side of the case to the appellate judge 
and try to persuade the judge why you should get what you are asking for.  Oral 
argument is not a new trial or a chance to present more evidence.  You cannot 
call  witnesses  to  testify.    You  are  limited  to  explaining  in  more  detail  the 
arguments  you  made  in  your  legal  memorandum  (or  brief).    Sometimes,  the 
judge will ask you questions about what you say during oral argument or what 
you  wrote  in  your  memorandum.    Each  side  gets  15  minutes  to  speak,  unless 
otherwise ordered.13

expired.14   

In the following cases, oral argument is only allowed if the superior court judge 
decides there is a good reason to have it: 

appeals from a civil or small claims matter where the controversy 
on appeal concerns less than $300. 
appeals from a minor offense as defined by Minor Offense Rule 2 
(examples  include  most  traffic  offenses  and  many  fish  &  game 
violations).  

In  these  cases,  you  may  file Request and Order  (form  AP-135)  to  ask  for  oral 
argument.  You must include an explanation of why oral argument is necessary.  
The court will notify you whether your request is granted or denied. 

In  all  other  types  of  appeals,  as  long  as  at  least  one  party  makes  a  timely 
request, the court will automatically schedule oral argument.  The request must 
be in writing, but does not need to explain why oral argument is necessary.  You 
may  use  Request and Order  (form  AP-135)  to  ask  for  oral  argument.    If  the 
appellee timely requests oral argument, you may not object to the request.15   

If  your  request  for  oral  argument  is  filed  after  the  deadline,  you  must  also 
include a request for the court to accept your late filing.  You may use Request 
and Order (form AP-135) to both ask for the oral argument to be scheduled, and 
to explain why the court should accept your late request. 

If you file a request for oral argument, you must serve a copy of your request on 
the appellee.  Make sure to fill out the certificate of service showing that you did 
this. 

The superior court will decide the appeal based on the record, the briefs or memoranda 
submitted, and oral arguments (if held).  The court will send you a copy of the decision.  
The decision may: 

•  affirm (agree with) the district court,  
• 
• 
•  dismiss your appeal. 

remand (send the case back for additional action by the district court), 
reverse the decision made by the district court, or 

There may also be a combination of these results if there are multiple issues on appeal.

In a criminal sentence appeal, the deadline for requesting oral argument is within 10 days after the 
appellee’s sentence memorandum is due, regardless of whether the appellee actually files one.  This 
is because you are not allowed to file a reply memorandum in these kinds of appeals, unless the 
court specifically orders otherwise.

VI. 

ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS 

In  civil  appeals,  Appellate  Rule  508  determines  who  may  apply  for  costs  and  attorney 
fees at  the  end of the appeal.  Generally, you  (the appellant)  may  apply for costs and 
attorney fees if the district court’s decision or judgment is reversed.16   

Costs.    The  clerk  will  send  the  parties  Notice Re Costs and Attorney Fees on Appeal 
(form AP-333) along with a copy of the appeal decision.  If you won the appeal, and you 
want  to  recover  your  costs,  file  a verified17  and  itemized  bill of  costs  within 10  days 
after the date shown in the clerk's certificate of distribution on the appeal decision.  If 
the decision was mailed to you, you have an additional three calendar days to file your 
bill of costs.   
The only costs you may ask for are: 

1. 
2. 
 
3. 
4. 

the filing fee 
the cost of  preparing  the  transcripts  or  electronic recordings  and  paying 
the transcriber 
the cost of copying and mailing memoranda or briefs 
extra costs related to bonds, such as surety fees or bank fees 

You must serve a copy of your bill of costs on the appellee, who has seven days to file 
objections.  The clerk will then decide what costs to award and send both parties a copy 
of the decision. 

Attorney Fees.  File a request for attorney fees within 10 days after the date shown in 
the clerk’s certificate of distribution on the appeal decision.  You may use Request and 
Order (form AP-135) to do this.  Be sure to attach a detailed invoice showing your actual 
attorney fees.  Non-attorneys cannot request attorney fees for representing themselves.  
Include an explanation of why you are allowed to recover attorney fees under Appellate 
Rule  508(e).    Send  a  copy  of  the  request  to  the  appellee,  who  has  seven  days  to  file 
objections.    The  court  will  send  you  a  copy  of  the  judge's  written  decision  on  the 
request.   

Collecting Costs and Attorney Fees.  If you win an award of costs or attorney fees, and 
the appellee does not pay voluntarily, you may ask the clerk for a writ of execution to 
collect from the appellee the amount owed to you. 

 

 
 
16   If the judgment is affirmed or if the appeal is dismissed, then the appellee may ask the court to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

award costs and attorney fees against you.  If the judgment is remanded, or if only some parts were 
reversed or affirmed, then the superior court will have to decide which side, if any, is awarded costs 
and fees. 

17   “Verified” means your cost bill must include a statement signed by a court clerk or notary public that 
you have sworn or affirmed that the information in the cost bill is true.  See Alaska Statute 09.63.030 
for the wording of a verification.
