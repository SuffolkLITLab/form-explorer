How To Find A Private Attorney 

he  Alaska  Bar  Association  provides  a  free  service  called  the  Lawyer 

Referral Service.  You can talk to the Lawyer Referral Service by calling: 

272-0352 in Anchorage or 
800-770-9999 outside Anchorage (toll free within Alaska) 

ell  the  Lawyer  Referral  Service  you  want  to  hire  a  lawyer  to  handle  your 
criminal case.  The service will give you the names and telephone numbers of 
three  attorneys  who  handle  criminal  cases.    Each  attorney  has  agreed  to 
charge no more than $50 for the first half-hour consultation.  Thereafter, the 
fee will have to be agreed upon by both you and the attorney you select.  

he following is a statement from the Lawyer Referral Service: 

Because  we  are  simply  a  referral  service,  we  cannot 
know what your total fee might be, nor how long it will 
take  to  resolve  your  problem.    Likewise,  we  cannot 
represent  the  quality  of  service  that  you  will  receive.  
We can advise you, however, that each attorney listed 
by the Referral Service is a member in good standing 
of the Alaska Bar Association. 

lease  be  sure  to  advise  the  attorney  that  you  were 
referred  by  the  Service  so  that  you  get  the  reduced 
charge.    We  will  ask  for  your  name  so  that  we  can 
verify to the attorney that you were in fact referred by 
us.    If,  for  some  reason,  none  of  the  attorneys  can 
help you, please contact us again and we will give you 
additional names.

What  Is  An  Attorney  and  What  Will  An  Attorney  Do  For 
Me? 

n  attorney  is  a  person  who  has  studied  the  laws  of  Alaska  and  has  passed  a 

test to show that he or she understands these laws.   

our attorney will: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

come  to  court  with  you  each  time  you  come  to  court  and  speak  for 
you in court, 

talk to the prosecutor for you, 

examine the charges which have been brought against you to see if 
they are in proper form, 

prepare and file legal papers for you, 

make  sure  that  no  improper  evidence  is  brought  against  you  in 
court, 

make sure all your rights are protected in court, 

advise you about whether or not you should have a trial, and 

show your case to the court in the way most favorable to you. 

n  attorney  will  talk  with  you  about  the  facts  of  your  case  in  private.    An 
attorney  is  not  allowed  to  tell  anyone  else  what  you  tell  him  or  her  about  your 
case  unless  you  want  your  attorney  to  do  so.    Exception:    If  your  attorney  is 
court-appointed, your attorney will be required to tell the court if he/she learns 
of  any  change  in  your  financial  status  that  would  affect  your  eligibility  for 
appointed counsel. 

ven  if  you  think  you  want  to  admit  that  the  charges  against  you  are  true,  an 
attorney can help you at sentencing by giving favorable information to the court 
and by making an argument for you. 

ecause  your  right  to  an  attorney  is  so  important,  if  you  want  an  attorney  but 
cannot  afford  to  hire  your  own,  the  court  will  appoint  an  attorney  to  represent 
you. 

OTE:  The words "attorney," "lawyer," and "counsel" all mean the 

same thing.

Will  I  Have  To  Pay  Anything  For  A  Court-Appointed 
Attorney? 

f  you  are  convicted,  the  court  will  enter  a  judgment  against  you  which  will 
require you to pay for part of the cost of your appointed attorney.  The amount 
you must pay will be based on the offense you are convicted of (which may not be 
the same as the offense originally charged). 

n most cases, the court will use a schedule to determine the amount you will be 
required to pay.  The schedule is printed below.  In unusual circumstances, you 
could be required to pay more or less than the scheduled amount.  

f  you  are  not  convicted,  you  usually  will  not  have  to  pay  for  court-appointed 
counsel. 

emember:  The amount you will be required to pay under the schedule is much 

less than you would have to pay for a private attorney.

What Must I Do To Get A Court-Appointed Attorney? 

 
When you appear in court, the judge will ask you if you want an attorney to help 
you.    If  you  say  yes,  the  judge  will  ask  if  you  want  to  hire  your  own  or  if  you 
want the court to appoint one for you at public expense.  If you say you want the 
court to appoint one, the judge will either ask you questions about your financial 
situation  or  ask  you  to  fill  out  a  financial  statement.    In  either  case,  you  will 
have to give this financial information under oath. 

ou  may  be  required  to  attempt  to  hire  a  private  attorney  before  the  court 
makes a final decision about whether you qualify for a court-appointed attorney. 
 

WARNING:    Any  financial  information  given  to  the  court  can  be 
reviewed  by  the  Attorney  General's  Office  after  your  case  is 
concluded.  If you give false information, the false information may 
be used to charge you with the crime of perjury.  Also, if the court 
later  determines  that  you  were  not  really  qualified  for  a  court-
appointed attorney, the court will order you to pay for all of the cost 
of  the  court-appointed  attorney  whether  or  not  you  are 
convicted.  Finally, your attorney must ask to withdraw from the 
case  if  he  or  she  reasonably  believes  you  made  a  "material 
misrepresentation"  (a  significant  false  statement)  of  your  financial 
status to the court. 

hat  If  The  Judge  Denies  My  Request  For  A  Court-

Appointed Attorney? 

ou  may  ask  the  presiding  judge  to  review the trial judge's decision by filing a 
request with the trial court within 3 days after the order denying counsel is sent 
to you.  You can use form CR-212 to make your request.  You can get this form at 
the clerk's office. 

fter An Attorney Is Appointed, Will I Be Required To Do 

Anything? 

es. 

You  will  be  required  to  contact  your  attorney  by  the  date  ordered  by  the 
judge. 

Also,  you  will  be  required  to  report  to  the  court  any  change  in  your 
employment and any improvement in your financial status.

What Happens If My Financial Situation Improves? 

ou must report any improvement in your financial situation to the court.  The 
court will then either continue or terminate (end) the appointment of counsel.  If 
the court continues the appointment, you may be required to pay for the actual 
cost of your appointed counsel from the time your financial status changed to the 
end of your case, whether or not you are convicted.  If the court terminates the 
appointment, you will be required to hire your own attorney.  

hat Happens If I Am Not Convicted? 

f  you  are  not  convicted,  you  will  not  be  required  to  pay  for  any  of  the  costs  of 
your  court-appointed  attorney  unless  the  court  determines  that  one  of  the 
following is true: 

At  the  time  counsel  was  appointed,  you  were  really  not  qualified  for  a 
court-appointed attorney; or

During the course of your case, your financial status improved and you no 
longer qualified for an attorney at public expense but the court continued 
the appointment of your attorney. 

hat Happens If I Am Convicted? 

he  judge  will  enter  a  criminal  judgment  against  you  stating  the  sentence  for 

your offense. 

he  judge  will  also  enter  a  separate  judgment  ordering  you  to  pay  the  costs  of 
your appointed counsel. That amount can be higher or lower than the amount on 
the schedule on page 2 of this booklet. Before entering this judgment, the judge 
will give you a chance to object and explain why you think the amount should be 
lower than the proposed judgment amount. The judge will not order you to pay 
an amount greater than the actual cost of counsel.   

he  judgment  against  you  for  the  cost  of  appointed  counsel  will  require  you  to 
apply  for  your  PFD  every  year  that  you  are  eligible  to  receive  a  dividend  until 
the judgment is paid in full. 
 

WARNING:    You  may  be  held  in  contempt  of  court  if  you  are  eligible  to 
receive a PFD but fail to apply for it.   

f  you  do  not  pay  the  judgment,  the  court  can  issue  an  order  taking  your  PFD, 
salary,  bank  accounts,  or  other  property  to  pay  the  judgment.        The  costs  for 
taking the property may be added to the amount of the judgment.

hat If I Cannot Afford To Pay The Judgment For 

The Costs Of Appointed Counsel? 

f you cannot pay the judgment all at once, contact the collections unit named on 
the judgment and ask if you can arrange a payment schedule. 

f the collections unit does not agree to let you make installment payments, you 
can ask the court to authorize such payments.  Form CR-545 is available at the 
clerk's office for you to use to make such a request.   

ou can also ask the judge to postpone the due date for payment or change the 

amount of the judgment.  You can use form CR-545 to make either request.   

f you ask the judge to reduce the amount of the judgment, you must explain in 
detail  in  the  first  paragraph  of  the  form  why  paying  the  original  judgment 
amount  will  impose  "manifest  hardship"  on  you  or  your  family.    Examples  of 
situations  that  the  court  may  consider  "manifest  hardship"  include  loss  of  your 
job, extraordinary expenses, or serious illness or injury.  You should also attach: 
 

a Financial Statement (form CR-206); and

proof of the "manifest hardship."  Examples of such proof include a 
letter  from  your  doctor  or  statements  from  the  IRS  or  your  bank 
showing your debts.

dditional Costs For Proceedings After Conviction 

f you are convicted, there may be additional proceedings in your case.  You will 
be required to pay part of the costs of the attorney if a court-appointed attorney 
represents you in any of the following proceedings. 

Appeal.  If you are convicted of a crime, you can appeal the decision to a 
higher  court.    Unless  your  conviction  is  reversed  on  appeal,  a  judgment 
will be entered against you for part of the cost of appointed counsel.  For 
example, the cost of counsel if you appeal only your sentence will be $250 
in a misdemeanor case and $500 in a felony.  If you appeal other issues in 
addition to your sentence ( a combined "merit" and "sentence" appeal), the 
cost  of  counsel  will  be  $1,000  for  a  misdemeanor  appeal  and  $2000  for  a 
felony  appeal.    See  Appellate  Rule  209(b)(8)  for  the  entire  schedule  of 
costs of appointed counsel in appeals. 

Probation Revocation.  If you are put on probation as part of your sentence 
and  you  violate  any  of  the  conditions  of  your  probation,  a  petition  to

revoke your probation, a judgment will be entered against you for part of 
the cost of your appointed counsel.  See the last line in the chart on page 2 
for the amount of this judgment.  

Post-Conviction Relief Action.  If you file an application for post-conviction 
relief under Criminal Rule 35.1 and the court denies your application, an 
additional judgment will be entered against you for part of the cost of your 
appointed counsel.  See the last line in the chart on page 2 for the amount
