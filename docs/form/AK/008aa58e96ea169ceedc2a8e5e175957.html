      <pre>Alaska’s 
Constitution:

Selecting 
Judges Based 
On Merit
and Judicial 
Retention
Elections 

council members vote for the applicants they 
believe  are  most  qualified  and  should  be 
nominated to the governor.

Once  the  Council  nominates  the  most 
highly  qualified  applicants,  who  makes 
the ultimate appointments? 

Under  Alaska’s  Constitution,  the  governor 
makes  the  ultimate  appointments  to  fill 
judicial vacancies.

Once  appointed,  how  long  do  judges 
remain in office?

All judges must go through a retention election 
within 2-3 years of appointment.  During this 
election  the  public  votes  either  “yes”  or  “no” 
on whether the judge should remain in office.  
As long as a judge continues to be retained by 
the voters, they may remain on the bench until 
they  reach  the  age  of  70  at  which  time  they 
have  mandatory  retirement  under  the  Alaska 
Constitution.  

How often do judges stand for retention?

Judges  serve  an  initial  term  of  2-3  years, 
depending on the court, before they stand for 
retention.  After the initial retention election, 
the terms of office are:

• District Court - 4 years
•
Superior Court - 6 years
• Court of Appeals - 8 years
Supreme Court - 10 years
•

How  do  I  get  information  regarding 
judges who are standing for retention?

The Alaska Judicial Council conducts surveys 
of different groups of court users, reviews court 
records, solicits public input, and holds public 
hearings to evaluate each judge who is standing 
for retention and issues a recommendation.  

The Alaska Judicial Council makes the results 
of its investigations and its recommendations 
available  on  its  website:  www.ajc.state.ak.us.  
In addition, the Alaska Court System provides 
information  on  its  website  about  each  of  the 
judges who serve in the Alaska courts: http://
courts.alaska.gov/ak-judges.htm. 
  Finally, 
information  about  each  judge  standing  for 
retention  is  included  in  the  State  of  Alaska’s 
is  mailed  to  each 
Voter  Pamphlet  that 
registered  voter  in  Alaska.    As  a  result  of  all 
these  efforts  and  the  constitutional  structure 
of  Alaska’s  judicial  selection  and  retention 
process,  Alaskans  have  the  opportunity  and 
ability to know more 

 

How  is  a  judicial  retention  election 
different  from  a  traditional  popular 
election?

Unlike most political candidates, judges do not 
run  against  anyone  and  are  prohibited  from 
campaigning  by  the  Alaska  Code  of  Judicial 
Conduct  unless  and  until  some  person  or 
organization does something to try to convince 
the voters to vote for the removal of the judge 
from office.

Unlike in a political race, there is no deadline 
for  declaring  an  intent  to  oppose  a  judge’s 
retention. 
the  ethical 
restrictions  on 
judicial  campaigning,  this 
make judges vulnerable to last-minute, unfair 
opposition campaigns.

  Combined  with 

Judges  don’t  take  political  positions  in  the 
retention process or campaign on issues other 
than their fitness as a judge.

Frequently Asked Questions

What  process  for  selecting  judges  did 
the authors of Alaska’s Constitution put 
in place?

Alaska’s  judges  are  selected  by  what  is  called 
the  Judicial  Merit  Selection  System.    The 
authors of Alaska’s Constitution believed that 
it  was  important  to  have  judges  who  were 
honest, fair, impartial, intelligent, experienced 
in  applying  the  law,  committed  to  following 
the  rule  of  law  and  serving  the  interests  of 
justice.    Likewise,  the  authors  believed  that 
traditional partisan politics, with its influence 
of  money,  political  patronage,  deal-making 
and  favoritism,  posed  too  great  a  threat  and 
impediment  to  achieving  the  desired  goal  of 
having  a  judiciary  composed  of  such  fair  and 
impartial  judges.    That’s  why  the  authors 
of  the  constitution  decided  that  Alaska’s 
judges should be chosen by the Judicial Merit 
Selection System.  The people of Alaska agreed 
with their proposal and, as a result, the Judicial 
Merit  Selection  System  for  selecting  Alaska 
state  court  judges  was  approved  by  Alaska’s 
voters  when  they  voted  to  adopt  the  Alaska 
Constitution.

the  Merit  Selection  System,  a 
Under 
constitutionally  authorized  and 
required 
committee  called  the  Alaska  Judicial  Council 
carefully  reviews  the  qualifications  of  every 
applicant  who  applies  to  serve  as  a  judge  in 
a  state  court  of  Alaska.    The  Alaska  Judicial 
Council  is  composed  of  an  equal  number  of 
lawyers  and  non-lawyers  and  chaired  by  the 
Chief  Justice  of  the  Alaska  Supreme  Court.  
In  addition  to  reviewing  the  applications 
submitted  by  each  applicant  for  a  judicial 
position, the Alaska Judicial Council conducts 
a thorough  background  investigation  of each 

applicant; reviews references and letters from 
the  public  concerning  each  applicant;  holds 
public  hearings  where  members  the  public 
have the opportunity to express their views on 
suitability of each applicant for judicial office; 
and  personally  interviews  each  applicant.  
Then,  after  that  thorough  review  and  careful 
deliberations,  the  Alaska  Judicial  Council 
selects  two  or  more  applicants  from  among 
the  most  qualified  applicants  for  the  position 
and  submits  their  names  and  applications 
to  the  Governor.    The  Governor  then  has  45 
days  to  appoint  one  of  the  recommended 
applicants.    After  each  judge  is  appointed,  at 
regular intervals, the voters of Alaska have the 
opportunity to vote whether that judge should 
be  allowed  to  remain  in  office  or  should  be 
replaced.

How  does  the  judicial  merit  selection 
system operate? 

Judicial  merit  selection 
involves  a  very 
in-depth  evaluation  of  judicial  applicants 
conducted  by  the  Alaska  Judicial  Council.  
When  a  judicial  vacancy  occurs,  a  notice  of 
vacancy is distributed to all Alaskan attorneys.  
Interested  persons  must  then  file  a  detailed 
application with the council that lists all past 
educational and work experience, community 
activities, and other background information.  
Each  applicant 
investigated  by 
the  council  through  a  variety  of  methods 
(described below), after which each applicant 
is  interviewed  by  the  council  and  asked  to 
address  any  concerns  the  investigation  may 
have raised.  After all applicants for a vacancy 
are 
interviewed  and  evaluated,  council 
members  vote  to  select  which  applicants  will 
be  nominated  to  the  governor.    The  council 
must  nominate  at  least  two  applicants  for 
each vacancy  to  be  filled, and the governor 

then 

is 

has 45 days after receiving the nominations to 
fill the vacancy.  The judicial selection process 
typically  takes  6-8  months  to  complete, 
between the time a vacancy arises and the time 
a new judge is appointed. 

How  are  candidates  for  judgeships 
investigated by the Council?

There  are  many  steps  to  the  council’s 
investigation process, which include: 

•

Soliciting  comments 
from  the  public
through  the  council’s  website  (http://
www.ajc.state.ak.us/selection/selcmnts.
html) and at public hearings (for schedule,
see  http://www.ajc.state.ak.us/pubhrng.
html);

• Reviewing  ratings  and  comments  from
surveys  of 
thousands  of  Alaskans,
including  peace  and  probation  officers,
court  employees,  attorneys,  jurors,  social
workers and child advocates;

•

Soliciting feedback from the attorneys and
judges  involved  in  an  applicant’s  most
recent cases;

• Reviewing  any  civil  or  criminal  litigation

involving an applicant;

• Reviewing  any  disciplinary  files  or
proceedings concerning an applicant with
the Alaska Bar Association or Commission
on Judicial Conduct; and;

• Reviewing  ratings  and  observations  of
independent,  community-based  volunteer
court observers.

How  does  the  Council  decide  who  to 
nominate for judgeships?

After  investigations  are  completed,  public 
hearings  held,  and  interviews  conducted,
