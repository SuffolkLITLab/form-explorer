LEVEL 1 APPEAL OF PRE-CERTIFICATION DENIAL 

What is pre-
certification? 

Pre-certification (also called “pre-authorization”) is when Aetna or OptumRx 
approves your procedure or medication beforehand because you or your 
provider requested it.  The active employee health PLAN requires pre-certification 
for some procedures and medications before they will cover the claim.  If pre-
certification is not requested and received beforehand, the plan will cover less of 
the cost or nothing at all.   

y appeal is 

about pre-
certification. 

If you are appealing Aetna’s or OptumRx’s denial of pre-certification, you first 
need to review a copy of the pre-certification or pre-authorization denial letter: 
 

 

 

If your provider requested pre-certification, Aetna or OptumRx will send 
the provider a letter explaining the pre-certification denial decision, and 
Aetna or OptumRx will send you a copy of the letter.   
 
If you requested pre-certification, Aetna or OptumRx will send the denial 
letter directly to you.  Make sure you keep your address current with the 
State of Alaska or else letters will be sent to your old address.   

hat 
services 
require pre-
certification? 

ou will find a list of services requiring pre-certification in the PLAN.  Aetna has 

the same list on its website plus OptumRx added several medications.   
You can use the “Links” tool or the Precertification flowchart for more 
information. 

LEVEL 1 APPEAL OF HEALTH OR PHARMACY CLAIM DENIAL 

For health claims processed by Aetna, you can find out by reviewing the 
EOB.  See the discussion below for instructions about that. 

For pharmacy claims processed by OptumRx, you will find out there’s a 
problem when either (a) you receive a letter from OptumRx telling you about the 
problem or (b) your pharmacist tries to fill your prescription and receives a 
rejection from OptumRx. 

or health claims processed by Aetna, first find the EOB.  If your appeal is 
about Aetna denying a health claim for a service you already had, and not about 
pre-certification or a pharmacy claim, you need to first find the Explanation of 
Benefits (EOB) from Aetna.  Note: you cannot easily print an EOB even if it’s open 
on your computer screen.  Some of the key pieces of information will not be 
included on a print out.  So we recommend that you follow all 5 steps below. 

 

To find the EOB, follow these 5 steps: 

1.  Go to: http://doa.alaska.gov/drb/alaskacare/ 

2.  Select the button called “View medical claim status” shown below:

4.  Under manage claims, select “Explanation of Benefits:”  

(Note: Do not try to find your EOBs using the “Claims” button because 
that will not give you a clear route to the EOB you need.) 

 

fter you find the claim you want to look at, select the link under “date 

prepared” to open the EOB.  See the example below.  IMPORTANT!!!  
Sometimes there is more than one health claim on an EOB.  Scroll 
through the EOB to find the particular claim you want. (You may need to 
scroll using a “next page” button.)

.  After the “Explanation of Benefits” list is open, find the claim you want 
to review.  Look under the columns called “date of service” and “health 
care professional” to find it.

 most 
important 
parts of the 
EOB. 

Next, find the 3 most important pieces of information on the EOB: 

1.  STATEMENT DATE. This is the date in the upper right corner of every EOB. 
You must know this date because it determines the deadline to file a level 1 
appeal.  You have 180 days to file after the EOB statement date.  The 
statement date is found in the upper right corner of every EOB.  
Here is a sample of what the STATEMENT DATE looks like:    

                            
2.  CLAIM ID.  The claim ID is the EOB ID number.  You can usually find it on 
page 2 of the EOB.  But first, if all of the pages don’t show up when you 
open the claim, use the “next page” button.  The “next page” button looks 
like this:

Find the CLAIM ID for the claim you want to appeal. It will be a series of 
letters and numbers. Here is a sample of what one looks like: 

                               
   

 

3.  REMARKS. SUPER IMPORTANT!!! There will be a tiny number in parentheses 
next to the particular procedure you are appealing. Here is an example:  

             

 

This tiny number is the key to the reason why Aetna denied your claim. 
Now scroll through the EOB until you find: “Your Claim Remarks.”  

                 

  

 

Remark (3) in this example says the amount charged by the doctor is “over 
the recognized charge for this service.”  That means your claim was denied 
because Aetna thinks the doctor charged too much for the service.   

DEADLINE FOR SUBMITTING THE LEVEL 1 APPEAL 

When is my 
Level 1 
appeal due? 

You have 180 days to file your level 1 appeal from the date you received notice 
that Aetna or OptumRx denied your claim.  Calculate 180 days from the 
statement date on the EOB and use that as your deadline.  You can use this 
online date calculator: http://cgi.cs.duke.edu/~des/datecalc/datecalc.cgi. Type 
the EOB statement date as your start date, and then 180 days as the number of 
days.  Then click “submit.”  Here is an example:

PREPARE THE LEVEL 1 APPEAL 

Prepare  
the Level 1 
appeal and 
send it to 
OptumRx for 
pharmacy 
claims, or 
Aetna for 
other claims. 

 

Prepare and submit your level 1 appeal: 

1.  FILL OUT FORM HCA-105 TO PREPARE YOUR LEVEL 1 APPEAL. You are not 
required to use this form, but the court system created it to make it easier for 
you.  Fill out each section that applies to your situation. Then sign and date 
the last page and fill in your contact information.  
IMPORTANT!!! If you have more than one health plan (such as both active and 
retiree plans), write all of your member ID numbers on the form.   
For examples of language you might use for an appeal of a denied health 
claim, or language you might use for an appeal of a denied pre-certification 
request, email the healthcare advocates: HealthcareAdvocates@akcourts.us.  

2.  GATHER YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS OR LETTERS FROM YOUR PROVIDER.  
Contact your provider’s office and ask for a copy of your medical records or 
other records that are important to your appeal.  If Aetna says the services 
you had were not “medically necessary,” then ask your doctor to write a 
“medical necessity letter” explaining that the services you had were medically 
necessary. For more information, email the healthcare advocates. 

3.  MAKE A COPY FOR YOUR RECORDS OF ALL LEVEL 1 DOCUMENTS YOU WILL 
SUBMIT TO AETNA OR OPTUMRx.  You may need to use the documents again 
for a level 2 appeal or an appeal to superior court. 

4.  SUBMIT YOUR LEVEL 1 APPEAL TO AETNA OR OPTUMRx.  Make sure to send 
it by fax with a confirmation sheet, or by mail with delivery confirmation.  You 
need to be able to prove it was received within the appeal deadline. 

5.  KEEP TRACK OF YOUR LEVEL 1 APPEAL.  Contact Aetna or OptumRx after a 

month if you have not received a decision letter from them.  See the links tool 
for contact info: https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/hcatoolkit-
links.pdf 

LEARNING THE RESULT OF THE LEVEL 1 APPEAL 

What is the 
result of my 
Level 1 
appeal? 

Aetna or OptumRx will mail you a letter explaining what it decided about your 
level 1 appeal.  The letter should explain the reason for the denial and what you 
can do next.   

Your next step will be either a level 2 appeal or a request for external review, 
depending on the reason why your level 1 appeal was denied. For tools and 
instructions about the next level of appeal, see HCA-200, Health Appeal Packet 2, 
or email the healthcare advocates:  HealthcareAdvocates@akcourts.us. 

When in doubt, email the healthcare advocates at 
HealthcareAdvocates@akcourts.us

APPEAL OF HEALTH CLAIM OR PRECERTIFICATION DENIAL 
This form is for active employees (not retirees) of the Alaska Court System and their dependents who 
wish to appeal health claim or precertification denials by Aetna or OptumRx. 

WHAT LEVEL APPEAL IS THIS? 

For more information about appealing your claims, call DRB at 1-800-821-2251; or review the health plan at 
http://doa.alaska.gov/drb/alaskacare/employee/publications/booklet.html; or email the Healthcare Advocates at 
healthcareadvocates@akcourts.us. If you are not satisfied with the administrative appeal decisions, you may 
appeal to Superior Court.  See appeal form packets HCA-100, HCA-200, HCA-300, and HCA-400.] 
 

  Level 1 Appeal to 

 Aetna  

 OptumRx 

 Check this box if this is an urgent appeal

Check this box if this is your Level 1 (first) appeal of a claim denied in full or in part by Aetna for health 
services or OptumRx for drugs.  Level 1 appeals must be received by Aetna or OptumRx within 180 calendar 
days of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) “statement date” or denial letter.  You may use this online 
calculator to calculate the due date. 

  Level 2 Appeal to 

 Aetna  

 OptumRx 

 Check this box if this is an urgent appeal

Check this Level 2 box if all of these statements are true: 
a.  You are not satisfied with the level 1 appeal decision by Aetna or OptumRx; and 
b.  For Aetna claims only, Aetna’s level 1 decision was based on something other than Aetna’s “medical 

opinion” (for example, Aetna says your doctor’s charges are more than the “recognized charge,” or the 
service you received is not covered by the plan, or that they need more records from your doctor); and 

c.  You want to appeal to level 2. 
Level 2 appeals go to Aetna for denied health services or OptumRx for denied drugs, and must be received by 
Aetna or OptumRx within 180 calendar days of the date of the Level 1 decision.  You may use this online 
calculator to calculate the due date. 

  Level 2 Request for External Review to Aetna 

 Check this box if this is an urgent appeal

* 

Check this box if all of these statements are true: 
a.  You are not satisfied with the level 1 appeal decision by Aetna; and 
b.  Aetna’s level 1 decision was based on Aetna’s “medical opinion” or Aetna’s level 1 denial letter talks 

about “medical necessity” (for example, they say your procedure was not medically necessary, or it was 
experimental or investigational, or something else involving Aetna’s medical or clinical opinion); and 

c.  You want to request review by an independent external review company. 
Requests for external review must be submitted to Aetna no later than 4 months after you receive the level 1 
denial letter.  Aetna is supposed to send a copy of their form for requesting these but they don’t always do 
that.  If you do not receive a form from Aetna, use this form or form HCA-205 instead, or email the 
Healthcare Advocates. 

  Level 3 Appeal to DRB (new for 2018) 

 Check this box if this is an urgent appeal

* 

Check this box if all of these statements are true: 
a.  You are appealing denial of services or pre-service request provided on or after January 1, 2018; and 
b.  You are not satisfied with the level 2 appeal denied by Aetna or OptumRx, or you are not satisfied with 

the external review by Aetna; and 

c.  You want to appeal to level 3. 
Level 3 only applies to services received after 2017.  For services received before 2018, skip level 3 and go 
directly to level 4 (appeal to superior court).  Level 3 appeals go to the Division of Retirement & Benefits 
(DRB) and must be received by the DRB within 60 calendar days of the date of the external review or level 2 
decision.  You may use this online calculator to calculate the due date.

DATA AND DOCUMENTS REQUESTED AS PART OF THIS APPEAL 

Recognized charge.  This paragraph applies if my claim(s) were denied in whole or part as above the 
“recognized charge.”  The database used for setting the recognized charge is inconsistent with any usual, 
customary, reasonable, or prevailing rate in the geographic area where the services were performed.  The 
plan relies on data from a database known to be incomplete, inaccurate, and indefensible.  I request the 
following as part of my appeal:  (1) For each of the past 36 months, how many actual claims were submitted 
by Alaska providers on behalf of active and retired AlaskaCare plan members for each of the same CPTs or 
medications denied in whole or part as above the recognized charge in my claim?  And of these actual 
claims submitted, how many were denied in whole or part as above the recognized charge?  (2) Which 
FairHealth update (May or November, and of what year) was used to process the claims I am appealing?  (3) 
Was “derived data” used to determine the recognized charge for my claims?  If so, for each CPT or 
medication, how many frequencies were in the database on the date my claims were processed and what 
were the actual provider charge amounts and dates of each of those frequencies?  (4) Provide me with a 
copy of all correspondence between any employee of the Alaska Dept. of Administration and any employee 
of Aetna or OptumRx about any of the following: FairHealth, any rate-setting database other than 
FairHealth, and Aetna’s or OptumRx’s reimbursement policies and practices regarding the recognized charge 
or similar rate-setting tool or process.  (5)  Provide a copy of the contract or letter of agreement between 
Alaska and Aetna, or for pharmacy claims between Alaska and OptumRx in effect on the dates of service 
associated with my claims.  (6) Identify the Medicare reimbursement rate in effect on the dates of service 
for the CPTs or medications at issue in my claim.  (7) Identify and provide a copy of every other document or 
source of information other than the FairHealth database that was used to process my claims.  

Proprietary guidelines or clinical policy bulletins.  This paragraph applies if my claim or claims were denied 
because of information in proprietary documents or guidelines (for example, the MCG Guidelines or the 
Milliman Medicare Repricer) or a clinical policy bulletin.  Please follow all necessary protocols and promptly 
release the documents and guidelines to me because they are being used to my detriment.   

.  Medical records.  This paragraph applies if my medical records were overlooked or ignored by Aetna or 

OptumRx or its external review organization in making the adverse benefit determination referenced in this 
appeal.  Provide a copy of my medical records (1) in Aetna’s  or OptumRx’s possession or control whether or 
not used to process my claim, and (2) actually reviewed or used by Aetna’s or OptumRx’s system, external 
review organization, or employee to process my claim.  In addition, if Aetna’s or OptumRx’s system 
processed my claim, I ask that this appeal and my future claims be processed by a human instead.   

Network steerage.  This paragraph applies if my claim(s) were denied in whole or part as out of network.  
Provide all information used in determining that my provider was out of network.  If non-network facility 
penalties were applied to my claim(s), confirm that the penalties were applied pursuant to my plan(s) and 
the law, and for facilities in Anchorage or the other 49 states.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
