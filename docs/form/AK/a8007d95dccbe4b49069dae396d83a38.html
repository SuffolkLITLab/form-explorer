General Information 

he information in this handbook is current as of September 2019.  Laws and procedures that came 
into existence after that date are not reflected here.  Check with an attorney or other knowledgeable 
person about whether any such changes affect your case.  How the information in this handbook 
applies to your case depends on the specific facts of your situation. 

hat is the purpose of this handbook? 

This handbook is designed to make the domestic violence laws easier to understand and use, so that 
people can effectively represent themselves throughout the domestic violence protective order 
process.  This handbook focuses on how to respond if someone asks the court for a protective 
order against you.   If someone has committed domestic violence against you and you want to 
understand what protection is available, see How to Represent Yourself in Alaska's Domestic 
Violence Protective Order Process, PUB-22.

for a protective order against you.

ow does domestic violence impact the custody decision in divorce or custody 

cases? 

  H

A history of domestic violence between you and the other parent can affect the custody or visitation 
arrangement for your children. The law presumes that the parent who committed the domestic 
violence will likely not get custody and visitation unless he or she meets certain requirements. These 
may include completing a batterer’s intervention or substance abuse treatment program. If there is 
any history of domestic violence in your relationship, talk with an attorney about how this law will 
impact your custody or divorce case. 
 

Domestic Violence Protective Order Process 

hat is a domestic violence protective order?

What are some important words to understand? 

Petitioner is the person who files in the court for a protective order.   

espondent is the person whom the petitioner claims committed the domestic violence.  The 

petitioner files a petition for a protective order against the respondent.   

udges and Magistrate Judges work for the court system and preside over domestic violence 
court proceedings. 

x parte means that only the petitioner needs to be present to obtain a 20-day protective order.  

There is no requirement that the respondent be notified about or present at the 20-day hearing. 

ervice is a legal term that means that you have delivered a copy of a legal document to the person 

on the other side of your case. 

he Certificate of Service is the name of the document that is a written, dated and signed 

statement telling the judge that you gave or sent a copy to the other side.  A copy of every document 
filed in court must be given to every person involved in the case, including the other side’s attorney 
if he or she has one. 

here are strict rules about how to serve different kinds of documents to make sure that the other 
party gets a copy of all documents involved in a case. In domestic violence protective order cases, 
usually the police will serve the ex parte and long-term protective orders on the respondent.  For 
motions to modify or other motions filed in protective order cases, usually the court will serve the 
other party by mail after the request is filed with the court. 

re there different types of protective orders? 

Yes.  There are three types of protective orders that last for different lengths of time and provide 
different forms of relief.  They are: 

emergency protective orders which last for 72 hours;  
ex parte protective orders which last for 20 days;  
long term protective orders which last for one year.

What is an emergency protective order? 

An emergency protective order is obtained by a police officer on behalf of a victim with the victim’s 
consent and lasts for 72 hours.  The police officer may call the judge from the victim’s location and 
describe the domestic violence incident that occurred.  Neither the victim nor the police officer is 
required to notify the respondent that the victim is seeking an emergency protective order.  If the 
judge finds probable cause that a crime of domestic violence has occurred, an emergency protective 
order can be issued.  This order gives the victim 72 hours of protection that provides enough time 
to request a longer-lasting order.

What is an ex-parte protective order? 

Most people begin the protective order process by requesting an ex parte protective order.  An ex 
parte protective order prohibits the respondent from threatening to commit or committing domestic 
violence against the petitioner and lasts for approximately 20 days.  This order may: 

•  prohibit or limit the respondent from contacting the petitioner, 
•  give the petitioner temporary custody of children, and  
•  give the petitioner possession of the residence and vehicle. 
 

The petitioner does not have to notify the respondent that he/she is seeking an ex parte protective 
order.   

o get an ex parte order, the petitioner must fill out a petition form that is available at the court, on 
the internet, at most shelters and possibly through the local police or VPSO.  There are two versions 
of the petition:  the DV-100 which is for just the petitioner and the DV-100-M  which is used when 
the petitioner is filing on behalf of multiple people (the petitioner and his/her child(ren)).  The 
petition is on the internet at http://courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#dv.   
In the petition, the petitioner can also request a long term protective order and the judge may set a 
date approximately twenty days later for a hearing.  The ex parte order will contain information about 
the date, time, and location of the long term order hearing. 

he ex parte order is valid at the time the judge signs it.    

he petitioner may request police assistance to pick up the children, take possession of the house, 

the vehicle, or necessary personal items, if the judge ordered those things to the petitioner.   

hat does “being served” with an order mean? 

This means the respondent has received a copy of the order, usually from the police, and is notified 
of all its provisions.  Once the respondent has been served, if he or she does not follow the court 
order, he or she is violating the order and may be subject to arrest or have to return to court. 

oes the petitioner have to serve the respondent? 

No, the police will serve the respondent.  When requesting a protective order, the petitioner will 
also fill out a form for the police to serve the order on the respondent: 

•  a Law Enforcement Information Sheet (DV-127), or   
•  a Request for Service of Domestic Violence Documents (DV-125 for one petitioner, or 

DV-125-M for multiple petitioners (parent with child(ren))   

All forms are available at the court or on the Internet at 
http://courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#dv.  

hat is a long term protective order? 

A long-term protective order prohibits the respondent from threatening to commit or committing 
domestic violence, stalking, or harassing the petitioner.  An order may: 

➢ prohibit the respondent from contacting or communicating directly or indirectly with the 

petitioner;

➢ remove and exclude the respondent from the petitioner’s residence, regardless of 

ownership of the residence; 

➢ direct the respondent to stay away from the petitioner’s residence, school, or work place, 
or any specified place frequented by the petitioner or designated household member; 
➢ prohibit the respondent from entering or following a vehicle that the petitioner occupies 

or possesses; 

➢ prohibit the respondent from using or possessing a deadly weapon if the court finds the 
respondent actually possessed or used a weapon during the commission of domestic 
violence; 

➢ direct the respondent to surrender any firearm that he or she owns or possesses if the 

court finds that he or she actually possessed or used a firearm during the commission of 
domestic violence; 

➢ request a peace officer to accompany the petitioner to the petitioner’s residence to 

ensure that the petitioner safely gets possession of the residence, vehicle, or personal 
items and is able to safely remove a vehicle or personal items from the residence; 
➢ award temporary custody of children to the petitioner and may arrange for visitation; 
➢ give the petitioner possession and use of a vehicle and other essential items, regardless of 

ownership of the items; 

➢  give the petitioner possession of a pet, possibly including requiring the respondent to pay 

➢ prohibit the respondent from consuming controlled substances including alcohol; 
➢ require the respondent to pay support for the petitioner or child in the care of the 

for its care; 

petitioner; 

➢ require the respondent to reimburse the petitioner for expenses associated with the 
domestic violence, including medical expenses, counseling, shelter, and repair or 
replacement of damages property; 

➢ require the respondent to pay costs and fees incurred by the petitioner in bringing the 

protective order action; 

➢ order the respondent, at the respondent’s expense, to participate in a program for the 
rehabilitation of perpetrators of domestic violence, or treatment for the abuse of drugs 
or alcohol; 

➢ order other relief that the judge determines necessary to protect the petitioner or any 

household member; 

➢  order law enforcement to assist in retrieving the children if awarded to the petitioner. 
 

All provisions in a long-term protective order will be in effect for one year, except for the 
prohibition against committing or threatening to commit domestic violence that remains in effect 
indefinitely until dissolved by a judge. 

he most typical way to receive a long-term protective order is to petition the court for both an ex 
parte protective order and a long-term protective order.  If the judge grants the ex parte order, he or 
she will schedule a hearing for approximately 20 days later to decide the long-term order request.   
The respondent will be notified of the hearing date for the long term protective order.  The 
petitioner must appear at the hearing for the long-term order or else the judge will dismiss the

petition.  If the respondent does not show up for the hearing, the judge will still consider the 
petition as long as the petitioner is present. 

 petitioner may request a long-term protective order without requesting an ex parte order.  After 
receiving the petition, the court will schedule a hearing date.  Without an ex parte order, there is no 
order in place until the court grants a long term protective order. 

hy would someone get a domestic violence protective order? 

The purpose of a protective order is to give the petitioner and his or her children immediate, 
temporary legal protection from domestic violence.  If the respondent violates a protective order, 
the respondent may be arrested and charged with a crime or have to return to court. 

hat is the difference between civil and criminal law? 

One of the most confusing things about the legal system is the difference between civil cases and 
criminal cases.  In domestic violence situations, there may be both civil and criminal cases occurring 
at the same time as a result of the act of domestic violence.    

hat is a criminal case? 

A criminal case is filed by the prosecutor who represents the government on behalf of society.  In 
some locations, the prosecutor is known as the District Attorney for the State of Alaska and in other 
places he or she is a municipal or city prosecutor.  The “defendant” is the person whom the case is 
against because it is believed that he or she committed a crime.  In a criminal case, the victim is not a 
party and does not need to have an attorney.  The prosecutor may choose to have the victim testify 
as a witness to help prove the case against the defendant, by serving the victim with a subpoena. 

f the police become involved because someone violates a criminal law, the police may arrest the 
defendant if they find probable cause.  The defendant must then appear before a judge who will 
decide whether to put the defendant in jail and set a bail amount, release the defendant to a third 
party custodian, or release the defendant on his or her own recognizance (O.R.).  The judge will 
require the defendant to comply with certain conditions if the defendant is released, one of which 
might be to prohibit contact with the victim. 

 prosecutor files a criminal case when he or she thinks there is enough evidence to prove the 

defendant has committed a crime. 

f the defendant pleads “guilty,” he or she will be sentenced without trial.  If the defendant pleads 
“not guilty,” the case will go to trial, usually with a jury.  Throughout the case, the prosecutor may 
ask the victim to appear in court. The prosecutor must notify the victim of all hearings and the 
victim can choose whether to attend.  At the end of a trial, the jury will decide whether the 
defendant is guilty or not guilty.  If the jury decides the defendant is guilty, the judge may order him 
or her to go to jail, to do community service, to pay restitution to the victim, and/or to commit no 
jailable offenses for a period of time.  If the jury finds the offender is not guilty, the defendant is free 
and the case is over. 

requently, the defendant will plead “no contest,” which means that he or she is not technically 
admitting guilt, but is accepting the same consequences of a guilty plea.  If the defendant pleads no 
contest, he or she will be sentenced without a trial.

hat is a civil case? 

In a civil domestic violence case, like when requesting a protective order, both parties are private 
individuals.  The government is not involved.  The person who begins the case is called the 
“petitioner” and the person whom the case is against is the “respondent.”  The case only moves 
ahead if the petitioner participates. 

n a civil case, the court may enter an order prohibiting specific actions such as committing domestic 
violence, and may order the respondent to reimburse the petitioner for expenses from the domestic 
violence, or may prohibit the respondent from contacting the petitioner. 
 

Requesting A Protective Order 

ho can ask the court for a protective order? 

A person is eligible to get a protective order if he/she   

1.  i s  the victim of a crime involving domestic violence, which is described below, 

2.  has a “household relationship” with the person who committed domestic 

violence against him/her.  “Household relationship” has a specific legal meaning 
that is described below. 

and  

 

Can children get protective orders? 

Parents or guardians can request protective orders on behalf of their child who is under age 18.  The 
respondent must have committed a crime of domestic violence against the child and the child must 
have a household relationship with the respondent. 

hat are crimes of domestic violence? 

The most common domestic violence crimes that are the basis for getting a protective order are 
assault, stalking, and harassment.  However, a petitioner may get an order as long as the respondent 
commits or attempts to commit a domestic violence crime.  To receive an order, the petitioner does 
not have to state specifically the legal name of the crime the person has committed.  The petitioner 
only needs to describe in detail what the person did and the judge will figure out which, if any, crime 
was committed. 

 petitioner may be able to get a protective order even if the respondent has not physically hit 
him/her, because not all of these crimes involve actual physical injury.  Following is a list of the 
domestic violence crimes with summary descriptions:    

➢  Assault is any kind of physical harm, like hitting.  It also includes threats to do physical 

injury if the threats are capable of being carried out right then.  It is important to 
understand that assault can be committed without actual physical contact, but instead 
with words that place the other person in fear of imminent physical injury. 

➢  Arson occurs when someone intentionally damages any property by starting a fire or 

explosion that places another in danger of serious physical injury.   

➢  Burglary occurs when someone enters or remains unlawfully in a building intending to 

commit a crime in the building.

with someone’s property.

➢  Coercion is when someone compels another person to engage in conduct that he or she 

➢  Criminal mischief occurs when someone recklessly or intentionally damages or tampers 

➢  Criminal trespass occurs when someone enters or remains unlawfully on land, in a 

➢  Cruelty to animals occurs when someone knowingly kills or injures a pet with the 

intent to intimidate, threaten or terrorize another person;  

➢  Custodial interference occurs when a parent or relative of the child takes the child 

knowing he/she has no legal rights from the lawful custodian and keeps that child for an 
extended period of time.  Returning a child an hour or two late from visitation is not 
considered custodial interference. 

➢  Extortion occurs when someone obtains another person’s property by threatening that 

person.   

➢  Harassment occurs when someone 

•  calls on the phone and will not hang up so that the other person cannot make or 
receive phone calls;  
•  makes repeated telephone calls at extremely inconvenient hours; 
•  makes an anonymous or obscene phone call; or  
•  makes a call that threatens physical injury. 

➢  Human trafficking is when someone compels another person to come to Alaska to 
engage in sexual conduct, adult entertainment or labor by force or threat of force. 

➢  Homicide is when someone causes the death of another. 
➢  Kidnapping occurs when someone restrains the victim with the intent to inflict physical 
injury upon or sexually assault the victim, or places the victim in fear that he or she will 
be injured.  It also occurs when someone moves the victim against their  will to a place 
where he or she is unlikely to be found.  It also occurs when an adult who is not a 
relative of a child takes that child and keeps him or her away from his or her normal 
guardians. 

➢  Reckless endangerment occurs when someone acts to create a substantial risk of 

serious physical injury to another.    

➢  Robbery occurs if someone uses or threatens the immediate use of force upon a person 
when taking or attempting to take an item of property from the victim’s presence and 
control. 

➢  Sexual offenses include all forms of sexual assault, incest, unwanted sexual contact, and 

rape.  Sexual offenses can occur even if the parties are married. 

➢  Stalking occurs when someone engages in repeated acts of non-consensual contact with 
the victim or a family member that places that person in fear of physical injury or death. 

➢  Terroristic threatening occurs when someone knowingly makes a false report that a 

circumstance dangerous to human life exists and places another in fear of physical injury.  
It also happens when someone sends or delivers a harmful substance that causes fear of 
injury.

For complete descriptions of the domestic violence crimes, read the Alaska Statutes: 

•  crimes against the person under AS 11.41; 
•  burglary under AS 11.46.300 - 11.46.310; 
•  criminal trespass under AS 11.46.320 - 11.46.330; 
•  arson or criminally negligent burning under AS 11.46.400 - 11.46.430; 
•  criminal mischief under AS 11.46.475 - 11.46.486; 
• 
terrorist threatening under AS 11.56.807 or 11.56.810; 
•  violating a protective order under AS 11.56.740(a)(1); or 
•  harassment under AS 11.61.120(a)(2) - (4); and 
•  cruelty to animals under AS 11.61.140(a)(5) if the animal is a pet. 

an someone get a protective order if the respondent was not arrested? 

Yes.  To get a protective order, it is not necessary that the police have arrested or charged the 
respondent with a crime.  A petitioner can get a protective order even if nobody called the police.   
Who are “household members”? 

To get a protective order, a petitioner must have a specific relationship with the respondent.  The 
law states that the violence must have been committed by a “household member.”  This does not 
mean that they have to live in a house together.  A “household member” includes: 

➢ adults or minors (children under the age of 18) who are current or former spouses; 
➢ adults or minors who live together currently or lived together in the past (covers 

roommates, whether or not they are in an intimate relationship); 

➢ adults or minors who are dating or who have dated; 
➢ adults or minors who have or had a sexual relationship; 
➢ adults or minors who are related to each other up to being first cousins; adults or minors 

who are related or formally related by marriage;  

➢ people who have a child together; and 
➢  minor children of a person in a relationship described above. 
 

Does the petitioner have to pay to file for a protective order? 

No.  It is free to file for a protective order. 

ow does a petitioner begin the protective order process? 

The petitioner fills out a petition for a protective order (DV-100 for one petitioner or DV-100-M 
for multiple petitioners), which is available at the local court or shelter or on the Internet at 
http://courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#dv.  The petitioner may request both an ex parte 
protective order that lasts for 20 days and a hearing for a long term protective order that lasts for 
one year.  The petition includes a section where the petitioner describes the domestic violence. 

he petitioner also fills out the confidential Law Enforcement Information Sheet (DV-127) which 

describes information about the respondent so the officer knows how to find and identify the 
respondent.   

The petitioner does not need to notify the respondent that he/she is seeking an ex parte protective 
order.

Ex Parte Hearing 

hen will the hearing for an ex parte protective order happen? 

In Anchorage, hearings happen every day.  Monday through Friday, hearings are in the afternoon 
between 2:30 and 4:30 pm.   On weekends, hearings will be between noon and 8 pm when a 
magistrate judge is available. 

n other courts, ex parte protective order hearings usually occur during court hours between 8:00 a.m. 
and 4:30 p.m.  Check with your local court for the hours when the hearings happen.  Some courts 
don’t hold ex parte hearings and decide whether to grant an order based on the petition. 

oes the court notify the respondent of the ex parte hearing?  

No.  The law does not provide notification to the respondent if there will be an ex parte hearing.  If there 
will be a hearing on a request for a long term protective order, the court will notify the respondent of the 
hearing date, time and location.  

What does a petitioner need to show to get an ex parte protective order? 

To get an ex parte protective order, the petitioner has to show: 

that there is a household relationship between the petitioner and respondent,   
there is probable cause that the respondent committed a crime of domestic violence, and 
it is necessary to protect the petitioner from domestic violence.   
 

What type of provisions will the ex parte order contain? 

If the judge grants the ex parte order, the order will state: 

the respondent is prohibited from committing or threatening to commit domestic violence 
against the petitioner; 
the specific things that the respondent is prohibited from doing for the 20 days that the 
order is in effect, which may include:    
o  prohibiting the respondent from going to specific places such as the petitioner’s home, 

o  prohibiting or limiting the type of contact and communication the respondent may have 

job, or school; 

with the petitioner;  

o  determining temporary custody, visitation and child support;  
o  determining spousal support; 
o  giving the petitioner possession of the joint residence or a vehicle, regardless of 

o  giving the petitioner possession of a pet and possibly requiring the respondent to pay for 

ownership, 

its care;   

 

o  requiring the respondent to turn over weapons to the police. 

The ex parte order is valid when the judge signs it.  The judge will give the petitioner a form to fill 
out with information about where the respondent might be located so that the police can serve him 
or her:  Law Enforcement Information Sheet (DV-127) or a Request for Service of Domestic 
Violence Documents (DV-125 for one petitioner, or DV-125-M for multiple petitioners (parent 
with child(ren)).  These forms are available at the court or on the internet

he petitioner may also request police assistance to pick up the children, take possession of the 
house, the vehicle, or necessary personal items, if the judge ordered those things to the petitioner.   

ill the judge set a date for a hearing on the long term protective order? 

If the petitioner also requested a long term protective order which lasts for one year, the judge will 
set a hearing date for the long term hearing in approximately 20 days.  Unlike the hearing for an ex 
parte order, the respondent has the right to be present at the long term hearing and will be notified 
of its date and at the hearing will be given the opportunity to present his or her side.  

f the judge denies the ex parte order, may a petitioner still get a long term 
protective order? 

If the judge denies the petitioner’s request for an ex parte order, the petitioner may still request a 
long-term protective order.  However, the court may decide not to schedule the long term hearing if 
there is not a household relationship between the petitioner and respondent, or that the respondent 
did not commit a crime of domestic violence.  Sometimes, however, the court may schedule the long 
term hearing even after denying the ex parte order if it determines the ex parte order was not 
necessary to protect the petitioner at that time. 

hat can you do if you think you really are the victim and the petitioner gets 

an ex parte protective order against you?  

Unfortunately, some people attempt to turn the system around and petition the court for a 
protective order against the real victim by providing the judge with misleading or incomplete 
information.  Since the judge issues ex parte orders based on the petitioner’s version of events, 
without notice to the respondent, it is possible that a petitioner can go to court before the real 
victim and get an ex parte order.  If this happens, and you believe that you are the real victim of 
domestic violence, you can petition the court for your own ex parte order. 

n your petition, describe the facts that show you to be the victim of domestic violence and notify 
the judge that you believe the other side deceptively received an ex parte order against you and of the 
hearing date for the long-term protective order.  Generally, the judge will not dissolve that order 
until the long-term hearing, when he or she will hear from both sides.  If you find yourself in this 
situation, it is important that you request your own ex parte order so that you are eligible to receive 
the legal protections available only to the person filing a petition for a protective order.  Examples of 
these legal protections are temporary custody of the children, and that the respondent be excluded 
from the residence or vehicle.   
 

Long-Term Protective Order Hearing 

hat should I expect at the long term protective order hearing? 

The judge holds the long-term protective order hearing to determine whether to grant the petitioner 
an order that lasts for one year.  The court notifies the respondent in advance about the hearing 
date, time and location.  The respondent has the right to participate in the hearing.

The hearings are open to the public.  In busy courts, other domestic violence cases may be 
scheduled at the same time as your hearing so be prepared that many other people may be present.  
You will wait until the judge calls your case.  The petitioner must show up or the case will be 
dismissed.  If the respondent does not show up, only the petitioner’s side of the case is heard.  While 
the hearing may not take very long at busier courts, be prepared to be at the court for several hours 
in the event that your case does not happen until the end of that day’s court schedule.  Make child 
care arrangements for this time. 

ll persons who testify will be sworn to tell the truth.  The judge will also ask each person to state 
their name, address, and occupation.  If you or a witness does not want the petitioner to know your 
address, you can ask the court to keep your address confidential. 

ho presents their case first? 

The petitioner presents their case first.  The judge will then hear from the respondent.  

hat information does the court consider?  

The court considers testimony from the petitioner, the respondent, any witnesses, as well as other 
information such as photographs, medical records, damaged items, bills or estimates. 

oes the respondent get to ask the petitioner questions? 

The petitioner will usually speak first.  After the petitioner testifies, the judge will usually ask whether 
the respondent has any questions for the petitioner.  Those questions are called “cross-
examination.”  You are supposed to ask leading questions.  These often take the form of: “Isn’t it 
true that . . .”  These questions are designed to get a “yes” or “no” answer and not to have the 
petitioner respond with a long story.  Sometimes the judge may ask the respondent to provide the 
questions to the judge to ask and the judge will decide whether the question is relevant.  After the 
respondent has finished questioning the petitioner, if requested the judge may allow the petitioner to 
further explain his or her answers.    

Does the respondent get a chance to testify? 

es.  After the petitioner has testified and presented their case, the respondent will present their 

case.  Witnesses may also testify.  If you disagree with what the Petitioner said during his/her 
testimony, explain what happened simply and directly.  Organize your testimony before the hearing 
because the judge will often give each hearing only a short amount of time, from 15 - 30 minutes in 
total.  You can have a written outline of the points you want to make which you can glance at when 
testifying.  However, you should not write out your testimony word for word in advance and read it 
at the hearing.  You do not have to testify and have the right to remain silent.   

ill the petitioner ask the respondent questions? 

fter you are done testifying, the judge will allow the petitioner (or attorney if represented) to ask 

you questions.  Answer only the question asked, keeping your answer as short as possible while 
being honest and complete.  You may answer “yes,” “no,” or “I don’t know,” if appropriate, or ask 
that the question be repeated or clarified if necessary.  Even if you do not like the way the petitioner 
or attorney is characterizing the events that occurred or if you feel like he or she is trying to make 
you look bad, do not argue with the attorney, the petitioner, or the judge.  If you want a chance to 
explain your answers or add more information, ask the judge to allow this.

hat other information can the respondent give the judge?  

In addition to your testimony, you may present other witnesses, documents or items, depending on 
the specifics of your situation. 

itnesses 

Other people may testify as witnesses, but only if they have personal knowledge of the situation 
being addressed in the petition.  For example, if someone was present during the event described in 
the petition and that person can show the petitioner is not telling the truth or mischaracterized what 
happened, you may call that person as a witness.  If there is are witnesses, tell the judge at the 
beginning of the hearing that you have witnesses who will testify that they saw or heard what 
happened.  If the judge wants to hear from the any witness, he or she will be sworn in and then will 
describe what occurred.  

he judge may choose not to hear from a witness because of the short amount of time given to each 

hearing.  However, even if the judge does not hear your witness’s testimony, you may feel more 
confident bringing witnesses with you because they can provide moral support. 

f your children witnessed the incident at issue, tell the judge that they were present.  However, you 
should seriously consider not having the children testify in court to avoid putting them in the 
uncomfortable position of possibly testifying against their other parent, especially if the children are 
young. 

f you need to subpoena a witness because he or she does not want to testify in court or their job 
requires a subpoena to be absent from work, you can get a signed subpoena at the court clerk’s 
office.  Learn more about how to subpoena a witness at: 
https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/civ-109.pdf.  

hotographs 

amaged Items 

edical Records 

Sometimes petitioners bring photos as evidence in domestic violence cases.  Photos may show 
injuries or property damage that resulted from the domestic violence.   

Petitioners may bring items that were damaged from the domestic violence if they are small enough 
to bring to court to present as evidence.   

A petitioner may bring medical records as evidence if he or she received medical treatment as a 
result of the domestic violence. 

olice Reports and Criminal Complaints 

If the police got involved, you can try to get a copy of the police report.  Usually you will need a 
subpoena to get copies of police records or recordings.  A subpoena is a legal request signed by a 
court clerk for the production of some document or witness.  You can pick up a subpoena form in 
the court clerk’s office.  To get a police report, you will usually need to subpoena the officer who 
wrote the report to appear in court with the report.  This may involve you paying a witness fee to 
the officer so check in advance with the police department so you are prepared.  Be aware that many 
judges will not consider police reports and instead find it more helpful to have the officer testify.

lso, if the prosecutor has charged the petitioner or the respondent in a criminal case because of a 

domestic violence incident, the petitioner or the respondent may bring a copy of the criminal 
complaint to the protective order hearing.  If possible, get a certified copy or ask the judge to take 
judicial notice of the charges. 

hen should I begin collecting the evidence? 

Start gathering your evidence as soon as possible.  If there were witnesses, talk to them to see if they 
have reliable information that will be helpful to your case.  Organize and outline your testimony well 
in advance of the hearing so you are comfortable with what you will say.  

hat should I expect when the petitioner presents his or her case? 

If the petitioner is not represented by an attorney, the petitioner will tell his or her side of the story.  
If the petitioner has an attorney, the attorney will ask the petitioner questions that are called “direct 
examination.” 

f the petitioner says things in court that you find very upsetting, lies, or exaggerations, you can 
respond when it is your turn to present testimony.  If you would like to explain something to the 
judge, or clear up something that the petitioner stated, you must wait until the petitioner is done 
speaking entirely and then respectfully ask the judge if you may respond.  Remember to be 
respectful and don’t interrupt when someone else is speaking.  You may find it helpful to take notes 
about what is said during the testimony from the petitioner and any witnesses so you can remember 
how to address when you testify. 

ow should I behave in court? 

Always remember the importance of being respectful in court, even if the petitioner states 
something that is upsetting or false.  Always speak to the judge and never respond directly to the 
petitioner.  The judge will let you know when it is your time to speak.  Do not speak when it is not 
your turn.  Look at the judge and not the petitioner throughout the hearing. 

o not yell out, throw your hands up in the air, roll your eyes, or interrupt anyone speaking.  Never 
argue with the petitioner, attorney, judge, or witness.  If the judge sees that you are calm, he or she 
may find you more believable. 

hat happens after both parties present their sides? 

After both parties present their information, the judge will determine whether a “preponderance of 
the evidence” shows that the respondent committed a crime of domestic violence against the 
petitioner and there is a household relationship between the parties.  The judge will weigh both 
parties’ evidence and determine which side weighs heavier.  If the judge finds that a crime of 
domestic violence occurred, he or she will enter the long-term protective order for one year and 
address additional relevant issues such as child custody and visitation, spousal and child support, 
possession of the home and vehicle and the other provisions of the order.  If the judge does not find 
that domestic violence occurred, the case ends.  Sometimes the judge may keep the ex parte order in 
effect until it expires which is usually in a few days.  Sometimes the ex parte order is expired and 
there will be no order in effect.

hat happens if the parties have a divorce or custody case going on at the 

same time as a domestic violence protective order case?  

If you also have a divorce or custody case with the other side, the domestic violence case file may be 
reassigned to the judge in your other case.  This avoids having two different judges dealing with 
issues that are related or having to present evidence more than once.  You will need to alert the 
judge in the domestic violence case hearing that the other divorce or custody case exists and provide 
the case number.  Also, give the judge in the divorce or custody case a copy of the order you receive 
in the domestic violence case. 

 
Children In The Protective Order Process 

ill the judge determine temporary custody of our children? 

The judge may determine temporary custody of the children.  It is very important to alert the judge 
about a previous custody order.  The judge can decide a custody and visitation arrangement.  The 
custody provision in the long term protective order will be in effect for one year.   

ill the court allow the respondent visitation with the children? 

Generally, the judge will allow the respondent visitation with the children if both the petitioner’s 
safety and the children’s safety can be protected.  The judge may allow visitation with appropriate 
safeguards in place.  Depending on the situation, the judge may require that the respondent’s time 
with the children be supervised.  
   
How can the visitation be structured to avoid problems between the petitioner 
and respondent?  

To limit safety concerns for the petitioner and to avoid the respondent violating the order and being 
subject to arrest, it is a good idea that all visitation transfers should occur away from the petitioner’s 
residence or the place where the petitioner will be present.  Before going to the hearing, be prepared 
with a suggested place for the transfer of the children so that the judge will write it into the 
protective order.  You can suggest what will work best for the petitioner, the respondent and the 
children for the one year duration of the order.  Visitation transfers commonly occur at the 
residence of willing family members or friends, supermarkets, fast food restaurants, day care 
facilities, schools, and at the most extreme, police stations.   

ow can the visitation be structured to keep the children safe? 

Understand that the petitioner may have safety concerns about the children being with you.  The 
petitioner may request that the visitation be structured to minimize the risks to the children. 

or example, if the respondent has a drug or alcohol problem, the petitioner may request that the 
respondent be prohibited from consuming any alcohol or drugs prior to or during the visits.  If the 
petitioner is concerned about drug and alcohol use at night or inappropriate exposure of the 
children to adult activities, the petitioner may also ask that there be no overnight visitation.

If the respondent has physically, emotionally or sexually abused the children, the petitioner may 
describe the incidents to the judge.  The petitioner may ask the judge to prohibit the respondent 
from inappropriately disciplining the children or saying anything bad about the petitioner to them.  
The petitioner may request that the visitation only occur in a public or specified place if he/she is 
concerned about abuse to the children occurring in private. 

ometimes supervised visitation is ordered so come prepared with the names of people willing to 
supervise the visitation.   

ay the petitioner request that the respondent have only supervised visitation? 

Yes.  If the petitioner believes that the respondent is a danger to the children and cannot be trusted 
to follow the order’s provisions during visitation, the petitioner may request that the court order the 
respondent to have only supervised visitation.  This means that the respondent can only visit with 
the children with a third party present during the entire visit.  Supervised visitation may be 
appropriate when the respondent has a history of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse of the 
children.  If there will be supervised visitation, it is helpful if you come to court prepared with the 
name of a willing family member or friend whom can be trusted to be the supervisor.  If there is 
nobody to supervise the visitation, the petitioner can ask the judge to allow visitation with a 
professional supervisor at the respondent’s expense.  Professional supervisors can be quite 
expensive and difficult to find.  Some courts offer supervised visitation programs at reduced rates so 
check with your local court to see if this is an option. 

hould I come to court with a specific visitation schedule? 

Yes.  If the court issues the protective order, it is a good idea to come to court with a specific 
visitation schedule that will work for you and the children for the one year duration of the order and 
which will allow you reasonable visitation.  Offer specific days and times for the visitation.  
Anticipate any holidays or special occasions which will arise during the order and you can specifically 
request that you have the children on some of those days in the event that they do not fall on your 
regularly scheduled visitation days.  If you plan to file for divorce or custody, the judge may look to 
the visitation arrangement in the protective order as guidance in deciding what is reasonable 
visitation in the more permanent divorce or custody case. 

ow can we communicate about the children while there is a no contact 

order? 

  H

It may be helpful to ask the judge to list the name of a relative or friend through whom you and the 
petitioner can communicate regarding the children.  Make sure before the hearing that the individual 
is willing to assume this role before you suggest this to the judge.  This third party is useful if 
visitation must be cancelled or rescheduled because of unforeseen situations.  Sometimes a 
petitioner may be comfortable talking with the respondent about the children, and may request that 
the order limit communication to discussing only the children and even specify which issues are 
appropriate to discuss like just schooling or illness.  If any communication with the petitioner is 
permitted, the order may specify how you are allowed to communicate:  by telephone, text or e-mail.  
If this is the situation, the respondent must follow the order and communicate only with the 
petitioner about children.  Otherwise, the respondent may be violating the protective order and 
subject to further restrictions.

If the respondent is not supposed to contact the petitioner, how can the 
respondent communicate with the children while they are in the petitioner’s 
care? 

Most protective orders contain provisions that prohibit the respondent from contacting the 
petitioner.  However, the petitioner may tell the judge that the respondent can contact the children 
by phone, text, email, Skype, Facetime or letters if the petitioner is comfortable with that.  The 
petitioner can request that this contact be limited though.  For example, the petitioner can ask that 
the order state that the respondent can call the children on specified days of the week at specified 
times and speak for a specified amount of time.  If this is the situation, the respondent must follow 
the order and communicate only with the children.  Otherwise, the respondent may be violating the 
protective order and subject to arrest or further restrictions.   

ho has custody after the protective order expires? 

After the protective order expires, there will be no custody order in effect unless there is a custody 
order from a divorce, dissolution or custody case.  Without a custody order, both parents have legal 
rights to the children.  Without a custody order, one parent can refuse to return a child and the 
police may not assist the other parent in having the child returned.  To avoid a time period when 
there is no order in effect that deals with issues about the children, consider filing a separate custody 
case that would deal with the parenting issues longer term.  If you plan to file a divorce, dissolution  
or custody case, consider filing it a couple of months before the protective order will expire.  If you 
are not married, you would file a custody case; if you are married, you would file a divorce or 
dissolution case. 

ow does domestic violence impact the custody decision in divorce or custody 

cases? 

  H

Under the law, a parent with a history of domestic violence may not get custody or visitation unless 
the visitation is supervised.  However, this parent may get some custody or visitation if he or she 
meets specific legal requirements.  In some relationships, both parents have domestic violence 
histories. 

f there is any history of domestic violence in your relationship, talk with a lawyer about how this 
law will impact your custody or divorce case.   
 

Financial Issues 

ill the respondent have to pay child support? 

Yes.  If the judge gives the petitioner temporary custody of the children, the petitioner is entitled to 
child support from the respondent.  Some judges award child support in the ex parte order, although 
some prefer to wait until the respondent has the opportunity to be heard at the long term protective 
order hearing. 

he judge may require you to fill out the DR-305 form, for temporary child support.  It is available 

from the court or on the internet at http://www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#support.   
 

 

  W

  I

  T

16 

 

 

After receiving both parties’ income information, the judge should enter a child support amount that 
the respondent must pay.   

ither parent can request that the Child Support Services Division (CSSD) process the child support 

payments by filling out a DR-315 form. .  This form is available at the court or on the Internet at 
http://courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#dv.  CSSD is a free accounting agency which keeps 
track of payments made and can deduct the payments directly from the respondent’s wages and 
Permanent Fund Dividend checks. 

ay the petitioner request spousal support from the respondent? 

Yes.  The judge may grant the petitioner spousal support if he/she is married to the respondent or 
in a marriage-type relationship and the respondent has been financially supporting the petitioner.  If 
a divorce case has been filed or will be filed shortly, the judge may not want to rule on spousal 
support issues in the domestic violence case, preferring that they be dealt with in the divorce case. 

ay the petitioner  request that the respondent pay medical bills and for items 

damaged during the domestic violence? 

Yes.  The petitioner can request that the judge order the respondent to reimburse for medical 
expenses or damaged items associated with the domestic violence.  If the respondent does not pay 
as ordered, the petitioner can ask the court to reduce the debt amount plus interest to a judgment.  
This will allow the petitioner to try and collect the money by executing on the respondent’s PFD, 
sweeping his or her bank account or garnishing wages.  Learn more if you owe a debt and there is a 
judgment against you from the Judgment Debtor Booklet, CIV-511. 
 

Contact/Communication Restrictions 

ill the respondent be allowed to contact the petitioner? 

Generally, the judge will prohibit the respondent from contacting the petitioner, but may allow some 
contact if the petitioner states it is acceptable.  Often, a petitioner wants no communication with the 
respondent.  Some petitioners agree to limited communication if they feel it is necessary to deal with 
specific issues such as a divorce or custody case.  If this is the situation, the respondent must follow 
the order and communicate with the petitioner according to any restrictions specified in the order 
such as during specified dates, times, methods and subject matter.  Otherwise, the respondent may 
be violating the protective order and subject to arrest or further restrictions.   

ay the petitioner get possession of the residence? 

The law provides that the petitioner may get possession of a joint residence and that the respondent 
be excluded from the residence, regardless of which party owns or rents it.  If the order grants the 
petitioner the residence shared with the respondent, the respondent must move out of the home.  If 
that is the situation, make arrangements during the hearing to get your personal property or have 
access to the home at a time that the petitioner will not be there to avoid having any prohibited 
contact.  Either you or the petitioner can ask for a police escort to retrieve your uncontested 
personal items.  Be aware that the police usually will be there for a short time so you may not be able 
to get all of your property.  If that will be a problem, ask the judge for arrangements in the order 
that will allow you to get your personal property.

he petitioner may also request that the respondent continue to pay all or some part of the house 
mortgage or rent and utilities if the respondent has provided the financial support for the residence 
prior to the protective order.  If this is ordered, you can ask the court to address how the payments 
are to be made to avoid violating the no contact provisions of the order. 

ay the petitioner get possession of a vehicle? 

The court may grant the petitioner get possession of a vehicle, regardless of who owns it.  The court 
will usually give the petitioner only one vehicle if there are two vehicles.  If the respondent has been 
responsible for the insurance and payments prior to the protective order, the judge may order the 
respondent to continue making all or part of these payments. 
 

Counseling And Treatment 

ill the court order the respondent to go to counseling? 

The judge may order the respondent go to a batterer’s intervention program if a program is 
available.  These are programs where the respondent learns about the dynamics of domestic 
violence, accepts responsibility for his or her actions, and learns how to change his or her behavior.  
The program will disclose the status of the respondent’s compliance only to the petitioner.  If the 
respondent has not checked in by the time stated in the protective order, the petitioner can ask the 
program to alert the judge of the respondent’s noncompliance.  You can learn about the 
Department of Corrections approved programs: https://dps.alaska.gov/cdvsa/services/
formenwhocommitdv.  

ill the court order the respondent to go to alcohol or drug treatment? 

The petitioner can request alcohol or drug treatment for the respondent, and the judge may order 
the respondent to be assessed for alcohol or drug problem and go to treatment if necessary.   
 

What To Expect After Receiving A Long Term Protective Order 

ead through the order so you know what actions are prohibited.  There may be serious 

consequences to the respondent if he or she does not follow the order’s provision.   

f you have been ordered to stay away from the petitioner’s home, job, school or other location, 
make sure to avoid these places.  If you were living together and the judge awarded the petitioner 
possession of the shared home, you will have to move out.  You can ask for a police escort to 
retrieve limited uncontested personal items.   

f no contact is allowed, make sure to avoid contacting the petitioner directly or indirectly by any 
methods, including in-person, phone, text, Facebook or other social media, email, letters, etc.  This 
means you cannot have friends of relatives contact the petitioner for you by any method.  

f you have been ordered to do a Batterer’s Intervention Class, treatment or counseling, it is 
important to participate and complete the full program.

Remember, the Long Term Order lasts for one year unless the court dissolves it earlier.  This means 
you must follow the Order for the entire time.  Also, be aware that the prohibition against 
committing domestic violence remains in effect even after the order expires, unless the judge 
specifically removes that provision.  

f there is a no contact order and you are married and want to divorce or are not married but have a 
child together and want to file a custody case against the petitioner, you cannot send a copy of the 
complaint and other required documents to the petitioner.  Instead, you need to hire a process 
server who will give the petitioner the copies of the documents.  If you cannot afford a process 
server or there are no process servers in the area, you may ask the court to modify the Domestic 
Violence Protective Order to permit service of legal papers using a different method.by filing: 

•  DV-135, Request to Modify or Dissolve Protective Order One Petitioner | Multiple 

Petitioners 

Wait until you get an order from the court stating how you may serve the opposing party before you 
serve the papers.  Otherwise, you may be arrested for violating the Protective Order. 
 

Special Issues For Immigrants Involved in Domestic Violence 
Protective Order Cases 

ill the respondent be deported if someone gets a protective order against him 

or her?  

  W

No.  Having a protective order against you is not a ground for deportation.  However, a non-citizen 
must be sure to strictly follow all requirements and limitations contained in the protective order.  A 
non-citizen respondent is subject to deportation if a court determines, in either civil or criminal 
proceedings, that he or she has violated a protective order.  In addition, certain immigration 
applications may be affected negatively if there is a protective order against you.   

ill a petitioner be deported if he or she gets a protective order? 

No.  A petitioner will not be deported if he/she contacts the police or goes to the hospital to seek 
medical care for injuries.  The petitioner will also not be deported for going to the courthouse to 
seek a protective order.  Someone can ask for a protective order or help from the police no matter 
what their immigration status is.

not filed the immigration paperwork for her or him? 

Yes. If a domestic violence victim is married to a person who has a green card or is a US citizen, the 
victim non-citizen spouse can apply for a green card without the other spouse’s assistance.   It is 
very important that you get legal advice from an immigration attorney as soon as possible. Talk to an 
immigration attorney or call the Alaska Immigration Justice Project at (907) 279-2457.

ill the court system provide an interpreter if I need one? 

Yes. The court system will provide you with an interpreter in court if you have difficulty speaking 
and understanding English.  If you ask for an interpreter, and the judge finds that you need an 
interpreter, the court will place a phone call to an interpreter who will interpret over the phone for 
you. 

he court system will also provide an interpreter if you have a disability and need an interpreter to 

communicate.  For example, the court system will provide you with an American Sign Language 
interpreter if you are deaf or hard of hearing and know sign language. 

ell the clerk at the court when you are notified about the protective order hearing that you need an 

interpreter.  It is helpful to arrange for the interpreter in advance to be sure you get one and the 
hearing occurs as scheduled. 

 
Modifications – Asking to change the protective order 

hat is a modification? 

After the court has granted either the ex parte protective order or long-term protective order, either 
the petitioner or the respondent may request that the order be changed by filing a Request to Modify 
a Protective Order, DV-131 One Petitioner | Multiple Petitioners.  This form is available at the 
court and at http://courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#dv.  Only the judge can modify the order.  
The parties cannot change the order simply by agreeing outside of the legal process.  Even if both 
parties agree to change part of the order, they must still go through the court and file a document 
stating they agree to the change.   

ow can a respondent modify a protective order? 

To modify a protective order, file a Request to Modify a Protective Order, DV-131 One Petitioner | 
Multiple Petitioners.  This form is available at the court and at 
http://courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#dv.  Fill in the caption with the names of the parties and 
case number exactly as they are written on the original order.  Explain how you want the order 
changed. 

or example, you could write that you want to change the current order that allows “reasonable 

visitation” with the children to “visitation with specified hours from Saturday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and 
Wednesday, 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.”  You will also need to state why you want the order changed.  For 
example, in a request to have specific visitation times, the reason might be that “without a specific 
time schedule, it hasn’t been working to regularly see my children.    Specified times will allow me to 
see my children on a regular basis.”  You must sign and date the request, and give the court a current 
mailing address and phone number.   

ow do I respond to the other side’s request to modify a protective order? 

You can file a Response to Request to Modify or Dissolve Protective Order, DV-140 (one 
petitioner) or DV-140-M (multiple petitioners).  Fill in the caption with the names of the parties and

case number exactly as they are written on the original order and state whether you agree or disagree 
with the request and explain why. 

ill there be a hearing on a request to modify? 

If the request is made to modify an ex parte protective order, the court may schedule a hearing on 3 
days’ notice.  If the request is made to modify a long term protective order, the judge may schedule a 
hearing within 20 days of the request.  The judge may allow the respondent the chance to respond to 
the request in writing by filling out: Response to Request to Modify or Dissolve Protective Order, 
DV-140 (one petitioner) or DV-140-M (multiple petitioners).   

he judge may deny the request without a hearing by finding it has no merit.  If the judge does not 

hold a hearing, you will receive an order in the mail telling you the judge’s decision.  If the judge 
holds a hearing, he or she may decide the request in court and give you a written order granting or 
denying your request.  Sometimes the judge issues a decision after the hearing, notifying the parties 
by mail.  If there is a hearing and you live far from the courthouse, you can ask the court to 
participate by phone.  To request to appear by phone, fill out: Request to Appear by Telephone, 
TF-710. 

n order to be notified of all hearings scheduled in the case, it is very important to inform the clerk 
at the court if you change your address.   

Violations And Enforcement 

hat is a violation? 

The respondent violates the protective order if the respondent has been served with it (or has 
knowledge of it) and purposefully violates the order’s provisions.  For example, if the order 
prohibits the respondent from contacting the petitioner and the respondent comes to the 
petitioner’s home or work place, that is a violation. 

hat happens if the respondent violates a protective order? 

If the respondent violates the provisions of a protective order, the petitioner can report the 
violations to the appropriate authority.  The petitioner alerts the police if criminal parts of the order 
are violated and alerts the judge if civil parts of the order are violated.  The different violations are 
discussed below.   

hich parts of the order are criminal violations? 

It is a misdemeanor crime to violate certain parts of the protective order.  Since each order is 
different, here are some examples of criminal violations: 

 

  W

  T

  I

   

  W

  W

•  committing or threatening to commit domestic violence; 
•  violating provisions that prohibit contact;  
• 
•  entering or following the victim's vehicle. 

refusing to leave the home; 

21 

 

 

If the respondent is arrested for violating an order, the State District Attorney’s Office may 
prosecute the respondent if there is enough evidence.  The respondent may be sent to jail. 

hich parts of the order are civil violations? 

If the respondent does not follow certain provisions of the order, the respondent may be 
committing civil violations.  This means that the judge may hold the respondent in “contempt of 
court” for such violations.  Examples of civil violations are the respondent: 

• 
• 
• 
• 

refuses to attend counseling, 
refuses to pay child support, 
refuses to reimburse medical bills, or 
refuses to deliver certain personal property to you. 

he petitioner must report such violations to the judge to get further help from the court in a 

Motion to Modify.  Modifications are discussed in the previous section. 
 

Contempt Of Court 

hat is “contempt of court”? 

If the judge finds the respondent willfully disobeyed the civil parts of the protective order, the 
respondent may be found “in contempt of court” and ordered to pay a fine or to go to jail.  This 
may happen if the respondent has not paid medical bills, spousal support, child support, complied 
with drug and/or alcohol treatment, or attended an anger management program. 

o alert the judge of the civil violations, the petitioner needs to file a “Motion for Order to Show 

Cause.”  
If the judge finds that the petitioner’s motion has merit, he or she will send the respondent an 
“Order to Show Cause,” ordering the respondent to appear at a hearing to explain any violations of 
the protective order.  The petitioner will also need to appear to tell the judge what provision of the 
order the respondent violated and what remedy the petitioner wants from the judge.  As a remedy, 
the judge may order the respondent to do what he or she was originally ordered or may restrict the 
respondent more than in the original order.  If the respondent fails to show up, the judge may issue 
a bench warrant for the respondent’s arrest. 
 

Extensions And Denials 

f the petitioner gets a protective order, can the petitioner extend it after one 
year? 

Most provisions in long term protective orders expire after one year.  The provision that prohibits 
the respondent from threatening to commit or committing domestic violence is in effect indefinitely, 
until a judge rules otherwise. 

he petitioner can ask the court to extend a long term protective order for one year if it is necessary 
for his or her protection.  The petitioner can make the request within 30 days of when the order will 
expire or within 60 days after it expires by filing a Request to Extend Protective Order, DV-132 (one

petitioner) or DV-132-M (multiple petitioners).  This form is available at the court and at 
http://www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#dv.  Fill in the caption with the names of the 
parties and case number exactly as they are written on the original order.  Explain in writing why you 
want the order extended.   

he court will schedule a hearing in at least 10 days from when you file the request to extend and 
notify both the petitioner and the respondent of when the hearing will be held.  At the hearing, the 
petitioner will provide information about why an extension is necessary for his or her protection and 
the judge will also hear from the respondent.  If the judge grants the extension, it will be for one 
year and include either the same provisions as the previous long term protective order, or changes 
based on the petitioner’s request.  You can request another extension is you feel you still need 
protection after the new order expires. 

f the initial long term protective order expires before the judge grants an extension, there will be no 
protective order in effect during that time in between.  The petitioner should plan how to keep safe.  
Contact an advocate to help with safety planning.  Find information on safety plans at 
http://www.andvsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Personalized-Safety-Plan.pdf.  Please see 
the list of shelters, victims’ services and resource programs at the end of this booklet. 

hat happens if the judge denies the protective order? 

If the judge does not find enough evidence to grant a long-term protective order, the case will be 
dismissed and there will be no order in place.  For example, if the respondent has been excluded 
from the family residence during the ex parte order and the petitioner’s requests for a long term 
protective order was denied, the respondent will not be excluded from the residence any more.   
 

Protective Orders Issued In Another State 

ill the police and court in Alaska enforce a protective order if the order is 

from another state? 
Law enforcement and the court system in Alaska will enforce an unexpired protective order that was 
issued by a tribal court or another state court if you file it with the Alaska court.  Either the 
petitioner or respondent needs to provide a certified copy of your unexpired protective order. 

ou can also contact the Family Law Self-Help Center help line to understand how to register your 

tribal or out-of-state order in Alaska.  Call (907) 264-0851 or toll free in Alaska but outside 
Anchorage at (866) 279-0851. 
 

Dissolving A Protective Order 

ow do I dissolve a protective order? 

If the petitioner wants to end a protective order, file a Request Dissolve a Protective Order, DV-133 
(one petitioner) or DV-133-M (multiple petitioners).  This form is available at the court and at 
http://www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#dv.  Fill in the caption with the names of the 
parties and case number exactly as they are written on the original order.  Explain why you want to 
end the order.

If the petitioner asks the court to dissolve the order, the court will dissolve the order and its 
provisions will no longer be in effect.  Sometimes courts have a hearing to determine whether the 
petitioner really filed the request, or the court wants to determine if there is any undue influence, 
coercion etc. 

f the respondent wants to dissolve a protective order and files a Request to Dissolve a Protective 
Order before the long term hearing has been held, the court will usually deny the request and tell the 
respondent to wait until the hearing to present the respondent’s side of the story.  If the Request to 
Dissolve is filed after the long term hearing, the judge will decide whether a hearing is necessary to 
hear from both parties regarding the issues raised by the respondent. The judge may decide the 
Request to Dissolve has no merit and the order will remain in effect. 

ow do I respond to the other side’s request to dissolve my protective order? 

You can file a Response to Request to Modify or Dissolve Protective Order, DV-140 (one 
petitioner) or DV-140-M (multiple petitioners).  Fill in the caption with the names of the parties and 
case number exactly as they are written on the original order and state whether you agree or disagree 
with the request and explain why.

Batterer’s Intervention Programs 

atterer Intervention Programs (BIPs) deliver education intended to promote behavioral changes in 

people who commit domestic violence to increase victim safety and offender well-being. The 
programs provide opportunities to understand the abusive nature of their behavior and the effects 
of their violence on their families. For those who choose to be accountable for their actions and 
want to change, this education helps them make progress in every aspect of their lives. BIPs increase 
opportunities for victims and their children to access services and support and to plan for their 
safety. BIPs engage system partners and local community members to establish coordinated 
community responses to this violence in order to decrease tolerance for domestic violence.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
