How F.E.D. Cases Work 
(Sequence of Events) 
 
1.  Notice To Quit given to tenant.  Before a lawsuit to evict a tenant may be 

filed, the landlord must give the tenant written notice of the reason the 
landlord intends to evict the tenant ("terminate the tenancy"). The notice 
must give the tenant time to correct the problem (or move out) in order to 
avoid eviction. 

F.E.D. lawsuit is filed.  The landlord files a complaint with the court if the 
tenant does not fix the problem by the deadline set in the Notice To Quit. 

Tenant is given notice of the lawsuit.  The tenant is served with a copy of 
the complaint and a court summons.  The summons orders the tenant to:  
a. 
b. 

appear at an eviction hearing, and  
file  a  written  answer  to  any  claim  of  damages  made  in  the 
complaint. 

Eviction Hearing.  The court holds an eviction hearing within 15 days 
after the case is filed in court and at least 2 days after the summons is 
served on the tenant. At this hearing, the judge decides who gets 
possession of the property. 

Judgment on Damages.  If the complaint asks for damages, one of the 
following two things  happens after the eviction hearing: 

Damages Trial.  This trial will only be held if, within 20 

a. 
days after the complaint is served on the tenant, the tenant files an 
answer disagreeing with the claims for money damages made in 
the complaint. 

Default Judgment. This will happen if the tenant fails to 

b. 
file an answer and the landlord requests a default judgment against 
the tenant for money.

"Forcible entry and detainer" (F.E.D.) is a type of court case in which a property 
owner seeks possession of the owner's real property (like land, a house or an 
apartment) currently being occupied by another person or persons.  Sometimes 
this type of case is referred to as an "eviction" or "possession" action.   

here are two parts to an F.E.D. court case: the eviction phase and the damages 

phase. The eviction phase (hearing) happens soon after the case is filed. The 
damages phase is handled at a later date.   

The Eviction Phase.  During this phase, the court will decide whether to 
grant the landlord's request to regain possession of the premises.  Other 
issues, such as how much money the tenant owes to the landlord will not 
be decided at this stage. 

The Damages Phase. During this phase, the court will decide whether the 
landlord will get a judgment against the tenant for money.  This phase will 
only be necessary if the landlord's complaint asks the court for money 
damages (unpaid rent, damages to the premises, etc.)  If the tenant files a 
counterclaim, it will be decided at this hearing. 

f possible, it is usually a good idea to consult with a lawyer in these matters.  For 
help in finding a lawyer who handles F.E.D. cases, you can call:

II.  INFORMATION FOR LANDLORDS:  PROCEDURE 
FOR EVICTING TENANTS 

A. 

Termination of Tenancy 

 

Before filing a court action to evict a tenant, the landlord must give notice to the 
tenant.  This notice is usually called a "Notice of Termination of Tenancy" or 
"Notice to Quit."  The notice must explain what, if anything, the tenant can do to 
correct the problem and remain as a tenant.  It must also include the deadline 
(both date and time) for correcting the problem.  See AS 09.45.100 -.105. 

hen the eviction is for failure to pay rent, the landlord may use the court form 
CIV-725 Notice to Quit.  Sample notice forms for eviction for other reasons (for 
example, intentional damage to the dwelling, illegal use of the premises, violation 
of the lease agreement, or non-payment of utilities) can be found in the Landlord 
Tenant Booklet described on page 4.  (See AS 09.45.090(a)(2), AS 09.45.105 and 
AS 34.03.220 for information about the different deadlines and the required 
contents of these notices.) 

  W

Service of the “Notice to Quit” 

AS 09.45.100(c) explains how the Notice to Quit must be given to the tenant: 

 notice to quit shall be in writing and shall be served 

upon the tenant or person in possession by being 
Delivered to the tenant or person; 
(1) 
Left at the premises in case of absence from 
(2) 
the premises; or 
Sent by registered or certified mail. 

  A

(3) 
 

The notice is typically delivered in person to the tenant by the landlord or 
property manager.  If the landlord or property manager attempts to make personal 
service and the tenant is absent, the notice may be left on the premises.  This is 
commonly done by taping the notice to the tenant's front door.  Whoever delivers 
or posts the notice should be available to testify at the eviction hearing.  Service 
by mail is seldom used because the tenant may not pick up the mail or the 
landlord may not receive the return receipt prior to the hearing. 

Proof of Service of “Notice to Quit” 

The landlord must prove to the court that the Notice to Quit was delivered as the 
statute requires.  It is recommended that a record be made at the time of service 
describing how, when, and by whom the tenant was served.  The court form 
Notice to Quit (CIV-725) provides space at the bottom for this record of service.

If the problem can be corrected, the tenant must be given time to correct it or 
move out before the landlord may file the court case.  If the eviction is for 
nonpayment of rent, the tenant must be given seven days to pay the rent after 
receiving the Notice to Quit.  If the eviction is for another reason, the amount of 
time will be different.  See AS 09.45.090. 
Note:  If the notice is sent to the tenant by registered or certified mail, the tenant 
has three additional days to correct the problem.  AS 09.45.090(c).  Therefore, if 
the eviction is for failure to pay rent and the notice is mailed, the notice must give 
the tenant ten days instead of seven to pay the rent.  

.  When Can a Lawsuit Be Filed 

If the tenant does not correct the problem or move out within the statutory time 
period stated in the Notice to Quit, a lawsuit can be filed.  AS 09.45.110.  For 
example, if the Notice to Quit is for failure to pay rent and the tenant does not 
move out or pay the rent within seven days, the lawsuit can be filed on the eighth 
day.  (Note:  The first day is the day after you hand the notice to the tenant, and 
you should include Saturdays, Sundays and holidays when you count the seven 
days.  Civil Rule 6). 

.  Who Can Be Named Plaintiff and Who Can Sign the Complaint 

1. 

Who Can Be Named as Plaintiff. 

The plaintiff in an F.E.D. action is the party seeking to evict the tenant.   
The plaintiff can be the owner of the property or a person authorized by the 
owner to file an F.E.D. action (for example, a property manager or a person 
acting under a “power of attorney”).1 

 
Who Can Sign the Complaint. 

2. 
 

If the plaintiff is the person who owns the property, then he or she can sign 
the complaint and appear in court on his or her own behalf at any hearings.  
If the plaintiff is a corporation, a property manager, or a person acting on 
behalf of the owner under a “power of attorney,” then an attorney must sign 
the complaint, because these persons or entities must always be represented 
in court by an attorney.2  The only exception is a non-profit public housing

Providing Tenant with Time to Correct the Problem or Move 

                                                 
1 Civil Rule 17(a) requires actions to be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.    
This rule also allows, however, that “a party with whom or in whose name a contract has been 
made for the benefit of another . . . may sue in that person’s own name without joining the party 
for whose benefit the action is brought.”  Also see the statutes concerning Alaska’s statutory form 
power of attorney, AS 13.26.332 and AS 13.26.344(i). 

2 AS 22.20.040(a) states that “an action or proceeding may be prosecuted or defended by a party 
in person or by attorney.”   

AS 22.20.040(a)(2) requires that corporations be represented in court by attorneys, unless there is 
an explicit exception in the law.

corporation proceeding under AS 09.45.158, which may appear without an 
attorney. 

.  Where to File 

The lawsuit to get possession of the property must be filed in the judicial district 
in which the property is located.  Civil Rule 3.  Information on how to determine 
where to file your lawsuit is available in Appendix 2 on page 30.  If the value of 
the past due rent and damage to the property is $100,000 or less, you must file 
your case in the district court.  AS 22.15.030(a)(6) and (b).  If it is greater than 
$100,000, you must file your case in superior court.3

Fill out the forms as follows: 

See Appendix 3 on page 31 for a sample of how to fill out the top of the 
forms (called the “case caption”). Type or print neatly using black ink. 

Note:  From this point on, the tenant will be referred to as "defendant" and 
the landlord will be referred to as "plaintiff." 

a. 

Complaint (CIV-730).  Be sure to name as defendants everyone 
listed on the lease and all other adults living in the dwelling.  Fill 
in all the blanks on both pages except for the case number. Attach 
the Notice to Quit to the complaint. 
 

 

                                                                                                                                                 
In Christensen v. Melinda, 857 P.2d 345 (Alaska 1993), the Alaska Supreme Court determined that a 
person with a power of attorney is not entitled to represent the principal (the person who granted the 
power) in court.  If the person who holds the power of attorney files a suit on behalf of the principal, 
the person holding the power (if he/she is not an attorney) must hire an attorney to prosecute the case. 

Representing another person or entity in court is practicing law.  It can only be done by licensed 
attorneys.  AS 08.08.210(a) states:  “A person may not engage in the practice of law in the state 
unless the person is licensed to practice law in Alaska and is an active member of the Alaska Bar.

Filing the forms and scheduling the eviction hearing. 

File the completed forms at your local court and pay the court filing fee.  
The filing fee is $150 if the amount of money claimed in the complaint is

time.  See Section I below on serving the defendant. 

he court clerk will schedule a hearing on the eviction phase of the case 

when the complaint is filed with the court.  Civil Rule 85 requires the 
hearing to be held at least two days after the summons and complaint are 
served on the defendant and not more than 15 days after the case is filed in 
court.  The clerk will ask you how soon you think the summons and 
complaint will be served on the tenant because the hearing cannot be held 
until two days after the tenant is served.

Choose a process server.  The clerk's office has a list of process servers in 
your area.  You can also find a list of licensed process servers on the Alaska 
State Trooper website:  www.dps.state.ak.us/Statewide/PermitsLicensing. 
Click on “Civilian Process Server List.”  Many parts of the state do not 
have process servers.  In those areas, the summons and complaint must be 
served by a peace officer (usually by a State Trooper).  Check with the 
clerk's office about local practices. 

Contact the process server to make arrangements for service of the 
summons and complaint.  Service fees are set by the individual process 
server and must be paid directly to the process server.  Note:  
Administrative Rule 11 governs the maximum amount you may recover as 
“costs” for this service from the tenant.  The current amount recoverable is 
$45.00 for each person on whom service is made plus a minimum of 
$20.00 for the first 25 miles or portion thereof traveled by the process 
server.  Additional amounts may be recovered for extra mileage or extra 
time spent serving the documents. 

Fill out service instructions.  You can use either the court's form (CIV-
615) or the form provided by the process server you select.  Fill out the 
service instructions as completely as possible.  In the section in which you 
must list the documents to be served, write "F.E.D. summons and 
complaint."  Provide as much information as possible about how to locate 
each defendant. 

Deliver completed documents to process server and pay the service fee.  
The procedures for getting the service instructions and other documents to 
the process server vary from court to court.  Please check with the local 
clerk's office or your process server for additional information. 

Proof of service.  After the process server gives the documents to the 
defendant(s), the process server must prepare a notarized document called 
a "Return of Service."  A separate Return of Service must be prepared for 
each named defendant served with a summons and complaint.  The Return 
of Service will prove to the court that the defendant knows about the 
eviction hearing and lawsuit.  The process server must file all Returns of 
Service with the court and give copies to you before the eviction hearing.  
You should bring your copies of the Returns of Service to the eviction 
hearing.

Note:  If the summons and complaint are not served at least two days 
before the hearing, the judge will probably postpone the hearing. Please

process server or peace officer.  (See Civil Rule 4.)

Defendant Files Answer.  If the defendant files an answer, there will need 
to be a trial to resolve the damages claims.  For information about how to 
request a trial, see Chapter V on page 20.  If no trial is set, the court will 
dismiss your case after 180 days for lack of prosecution.  Civil Rule 
85(a)(6). 

Defendant’s Answer Includes a Counterclaim.  If the defendant’s answer 
includes a counterclaim, you must respond to the counterclaim within 20 
days after the answer is served on you.  See Civil Rule 12(a).  The 
defendant’s counterclaim will be decided at the same trial as your claim 
for damages.  If you do not answer the counterclaim, the defendant can get 
a default judgment against you. 

Defendant Does Not File an Answer.  If the defendant does not file a 
written answer within the 20-day time limit, you can ask the court for a 
default judgment against the defendant.  You must serve your application 
on the defendant.  See Chapter VI on page 23.   

NOTE:  If (i) you do not file an application for default judgment, and      
(ii) the case has been pending for more than 180 days from the date the 
complaint was filed, and (iii) no further trial or hearing is scheduled to 
take place in the case, then the court may dismiss the case for want of 
prosecution without further notice or order.  If this happens, a party has 
the right to reopen this case no later than one year after dismissal by 
making a request to the court clerk in writing. 

 

 

Failure to serve documents.  If the process server does not serve the 
summons and complaint at least two days before the eviction hearing, the 
hearing will probably be postponed.  Civil Rule 85(a)(2) and AS 
09.45.120.  If this happens, you will need to contact the clerk's office for a 
new hearing date and a new summons. 

The defendant must file an answer within 20 days after being served with the 
complaint.

In order to evict you, the landlord must first give you a written notice that he/she 
intends to end your tenancy.  The notice, which is often called a “Notice to Quit,” 
must tell you what you can do, if anything, to remain as a tenant.  See page 5 for 
more information about this notice. 

f you do not cure the problem or move out by the time stated in the notice, the 
landlord can file a complaint against you in court asking for (1) your eviction and 
(2) a judgment against you for money (for such things as back rent, damages to 
the premises, and the costs of bringing the court action) or for other remedies 
(such as return of personal property). 

hen the landlord files the complaint, the court will give the landlord a summons 

For  additional  information  about  the  eviction  process, 
refer  to  Chapter  I  (pages  2-4)  and  the  Landlord  Tenant 
Booklet (described on page 4) or talk to an attorney about 
your rights as a tenant.

answer to the damages claim than you will have to prepare for your eviction 
hearing. See Section D on page 15 about filing your answer. 
 
Preparing for the Eviction Hearing 

At the eviction hearing, the judge will decide whether you have to move out.  If 
you want to oppose the eviction, you must attend the hearing and present your 
defense.  You must bring with you any documents, photographs or other evidence 
you want the court to see and any witnesses that will testify for you.  If you do not 
attend the hearing, the hearing will proceed without you and the judge will 
probably order that you be evicted. The eviction hearing is described in more 
detail in chapter IV on page 18.

Since this hearing is usually scheduled to happen just 2 to 4 days after you receive 
the summons, you will have to determine very quickly whether you have any 
defenses that would prevent your eviction.  Some possible defenses are listed 
below. 
 
1. 
 
 

Defenses to Eviction for Failure to Pay Rent 
 
The following are some of the main defenses a tenant can raise if the 
reason for eviction is failure to pay rent.  You can find out more about 
these defenses and others in the Landlord Tenant Booklet (PUB-30) 
described on page 4 or in Alaska Statutes 34.03.  The statutes listed below 
can be found in the back of PUB-30.   

Defense:  Rent is not owed in the amount claimed because: 

   

 

 

The landlord has failed to maintain fit premises in violation of AS 
34.03.100.  The landlord’s failure to maintain the premises has 
diminished the fair rental value of the premises, which offsets the 
amount of rent claimed. 

The landlord has wrongfully failed to supply heat, water, hot 
water, or other essential services (as required by AS 34.03.100).  
The tenant gave written notice to the landlord as required by AS 
34.03.180(c).  The tenant is entitled to a reduction in the amount of 
rent owed as described in AS 34.03.180.   

The landlord has unlawfully removed or excluded the tenant from 
the premises, or willfully diminished essential services. The 
statutory damages offset the amount of rent claimed.  (AS 
34.03.210 & AS 34.03.170) 

The landlord accepted the tenant’s partial payment of rent after the 
tenant was given the Notice to Quit. Therefore, the landlord has 
waived the right to terminate the rental agreement for that breach.  
AS 34.03.240. 

The landlord increased the tenant’s rent (or decreased the services 
provided to the tenant) in retaliation because the tenant complained 
to the landlord about the condition of the premises or tried to 
enforce the tenant’s rights under the Alaska Landlord and Tenant 
Act.  The tenant paid the amount of rent that the tenant believes 
he/she owes. AS 34.03.310.

If you want to contest the eviction, it is a good idea to hire an attorney to 
help you or at least try to talk to an attorney to find out about your rights 
as a tenant and any possible defenses you can raise.  See page 3 for 
information that may help you find an attorney.

If you believe you have a good defense to the eviction, but need a few 
more days to gather your evidence or get an attorney, you must ask for a 
“continuance” (a postponement of the hearing).  You can use form CIV-
733 to do this.  Your request must show the judge that you have a good 
reason for delaying the hearing (for example, you need time to speak to 
your attorney, get receipts or locate a witness) and that you have made 
diligent efforts to prepare your defense.6  The judge will not grant a 
continuance if it appears that the need for one arises from your own delay 
or lack of diligence. Depending on the length of the delay you request, you 
may need to deposit cash or a surety bond7 with the court equal to the 
amount of rent due during the period of delay.8 

To ask for a continuance, you must file a request (called a “motion”) with 
the court and mail or deliver a copy of it to the plaintiff (landlord).  If 
possible, you should do this before the hearing.  If you cannot, you must 
bring it to the hearing along with copies for yourself and the landlord.  
Remember: Continuances are not automatic.  You must show why a 
continuance is necessary.  The judge will decide whether to grant the 
continuance. 

he following instructions are for form CIV-733, Expedited Motion for 

Continuance and Affidavit. 

Fill out the top of the form (the location of the court, the names of 
the parties and the case number) the same way the complaint is 
filled out. 

Fill in the date of the eviction hearing. 

Length of Delay Requested.  Indicate how many days you want to 
postpone the hearing. If you request more than two days, you must 
be prepared to deposit cash or a surety bond with the court to cover 
rent that may accrue during the period of the continuance.  For 
example, if you ask for a two-week continuance, you should be 
prepared to post an amount equal to two weeks’ rent; if you ask for 
a 30-day continuance, you should be prepared to post an amount 
equal to one month’s rent.

How to Request Postponement of the Eviction Hearing. 

 

                                                 
6 Vinson v. Hamilton, 854 P.2d 733 (Alaska 1993). 
7 A “surety bond” is a document that guarantees payment of money if certain things occur.  The 
person or company that writes the bond is called the surety.  The surety guarantees the payment 
by becoming liable (responsible) for it.  Such bonds are generally available from insurance 
companies or third parties qualified to write surety bonds.  There will be a fee.  The court system 
does not provide forms for surety bonds in civil cases. 
8 AS 09.45.120 and Civil Rule 85(a)(3). 

CIV-720 EVICTION BOOKLET (5/18) 

13 

Reasons for Postponement.  Describe why a continuance is 
necessary. There are two possible reasons: 

(1) 

 

You need more time to consult an attorney.  If you want to 
talk with or hire an attorney to represent you, and the 
attorney is unable to meet with you prior to the eviction 
hearing, the judge may allow a continuance.  You must 
describe the efforts you have made to contact an attorney. 
Example: 

I need more time to talk to an attorney.  I have made 
the following efforts to contact an attorney:  I 
called the Lawyer Referral Service and got the 
names of three lawyers:  Scott Turow, John 
Grisham, and Susan Miller.  Mr. Grisham said he 
would be willing to help me but not on such short 
notice.  He needs at least a week to fit me in. 

 

(2) 

You need more time to prepare to present your defense.  If 
this is your reason for asking for a continuance, you must 
state what your defense is and why you need more time to 
prepare it.  Some possible defenses are described in section 
1 above.  The following is an example of how to write this 
in your motion: 

. 

  d

 

 

 

I need more time to prepare to present the following 
defenses: The landlord has failed to maintain fit 
premises as required by AS 34.03.100.  On 
March 5, a pipe broke in the unit above mine, and 
water came through the ceiling of my living room 
and ruined my couch and all the books in my 
bookcase.  I notified the landlord immediately, 
and the landlord had a plumber stop the leak.  I 
was unable to use the room for the rest of the 
month while the ceiling was being repaired and 
the carpet replaced.  The landlord said he would 
not charge me rent for that month, and now he’s 
trying to evict me for not paying that rent.   

The reasons I need more time to present these 
defenses are (describe why you need more time to 
gather evidence and/or witnesses):  My neighbor, 
Adam Fleischman, was there when the landlord 
said I didn’t have to pay the rent, but now Adam 
is away on a job in North Dakota.  Adam will be 
back in two weeks and can testify for me.  
 

 

 

 

 

CIV-720 EVICTION BOOKLET (5/18)

n addition to asking for your eviction, the complaint will usually ask for a judgment 
against you for such things as past due rent, other damages “in an amount to be 
proved in court” and costs and attorney fees.   

 

  I

You must file a written answer if you 
a. 
b. 
c. 

Disagree with the amount of rent claimed in the complaint, or 
Disagree with the plaintiff’s claim that you caused additional damages, or 
Have a counterclaim you want to bring against the plaintiff. 
 

Note:  The complaint does not have to specify what the additional damages are 
because the plaintiff may not be able to determine what the damages are until the 
plaintiff regains possession of the premises.  In order to find out exactly what 
damages the plaintiff is going to claim, you must file an answer opposing the 
complaint.  When you find out what the plaintiff is claiming as damages, you may 
be able to defend against the claim by arguing that the “damage” was simply 
ordinary wear and tear (and not the result of abusive living) or that the damage 
occurred before you moved in.  (See page 21 of the Landlord Tenant Booklet for 
more information about damages.) 

Also note that it is not enough to object at the eviction hearing to the amount of rent 
claimed.  You must file a written answer if you want to avoid a default judgment 
against you. 

our answer must be filed within 20 days after you are served with the summons. 

You may use court form CIV-735, Answer To F.E.D. Complaint. 

 

 

Fill out the form as follows (please type or print neatly using black ink):

If you agree that you owe the plaintiff money for damage to the property, 
check the “I ADMIT” box and fill in the amount of money you believe you 
owe.  If you disagree with the claim, check the “I DENY” box.  Note:  the 
plaintiff’s complaint may not state the amount of additional damages the

IV.  THE EVICTION HEARING 
 

 

If you have difficulty hearing, tell the clerk and ask to use the 
assisted listening equipment available in the courtrooms. 

n the date set for the eviction hearing, the judge will ONLY consider the issue of who is 

entitled to possession of the property.  The judge will NOT decide the plaintiff’s claims 
for unpaid rent or other damages at this hearing.  However, the defendant may present 
defenses to eviction that contest the amount of rent owed.   

he plaintiff must be present in court and must be prepared to prove he/she is entitled to 
possession of the property.  The defendant must also be present if the defendant wishes to 
offer defenses to eviction.  The plaintiff and the defendant can each be represented by an 
attorney, but it is not required (unless the plaintiff is not the owner of the property as 
explained on page 6, Section F.2). 

oth plaintiff and defendant must have all documents and other evidence relating to the 
eviction portion of the case with them in court.  For the plaintiff, this may include the rental 
agreement, notice to quit, return of service, and other evidence relating to the reasons for 
eviction.  For the defendant, this may include receipts or canceled checks showing the 
rent was paid or repairs were made, photographs or other evidence that support the 
defendant’s claim for rent offsets or reductions. 

f either the plaintiff or the defendant wishes to have witnesses testify at the eviction 
hearing, that party must arrange to have the witnesses present at the time of the hearing.  
Permission for a witness to appear telephonically must be obtained from the court prior to 
the hearing.  Both parties can ask the court to issue subpoenas ordering witnesses to 
appear in court.  A booklet about how to do this (CIV-109) is available at the court. 

.  Hearing Procedure  

The eviction hearing usually proceeds as follows:

On the day of your court hearing, check the court calendar for courtroom 
assignment. All parties should be inside the courtroom at the time 
scheduled for the hearing. 

The court may have scheduled more than one case at the same time. The 
judge or the clerk will ask you to come forward when it is your turn. 

The judge will expect the plaintiff to present testimony and documentation 
to prove that the requirements for an eviction have been satisfied. This 
may include a copy of the rental agreement or lease, proof that the 
summons and complaint were properly served, that the notice to quit met 
statutory requirements, and that the problems described in the notice, such 
as failure to pay rent, were not corrected.

The judge will ask the defendant to present testimony and documentation 
about any defenses to eviction.  This may include receipts or canceled 
checks showing that the rent was paid or repairs were made, photographs, 
witness testimony, or other evidence that supports any claim the defendant 
may have for rent offsets or reductions. 

The judge will make a decision either granting or denying the plaintiff's 
request for possession of the property. 

If the judge grants possession to the plaintiff, the judge will order the 
defendant to leave the property by a specific date and time. If the plaintiff 
believes the defendant will not move out as ordered, the plaintiff may ask 
for a Writ of Assistance at this time. (See page 8, paragraph H. 2. f.) 

If the judge denies possession to the plaintiff, the defendant may stay in 
the property.

.  Hearing Procedure if Defendant Does Not Appear 

If the defendant does not appear at the eviction hearing, the judge may rule that 
the defendant loses the eviction portion of the case by default and order the 
defendant to vacate the premises.  The judge will require testimony to establish 
proof that the defendant was served with the summons and complaint, that the 
notice to quit met statutory requirements and the defendant did not correct the 
problems described.  If satisfactory proof is provided, the judge will order the 
eviction.

V.  TRIAL TO DECIDE CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES 

f the plaintiff's complaint asks for money damages (such as for unpaid rent, damages to 
the premises, etc.) and the defendant files a written answer within 20 days after being 
served with the complaint, there will need to be a trial to decide the amount of damages 
owed.  If the defendant does not file a written answer, see Chapter VI on Default 
Judgment (page 23). 

he “damages” portion of the F.E.D. action is a formal civil action and is governed by 
the Civil Rules.  Contested civil actions can be very complicated, so it might be helpful to 
consult an attorney, particularly if an attorney represents the other side. 

Scheduling the Damages Trial 

 

Ask the clerk which of the following procedures applies to your case:   

In some courts, the court will automatically schedule either a pretrial 
conference or a trial date after the defendant files an Answer. 

In other courts, one of the parties must request that a trial be set.  See Civil 
Rule 40(b).  The form for requesting this trial is called a Memorandum to Set 
Civil Case for Trial (CIV-200).  The form can be obtained from the clerk's

10 The  Alaska Constitution (Art.  I Sec.16) provides the right to a jury trial on claims exceeding 
$250.  See Civil Rule 38 about how to “demand” a jury trial.  Also, note that in Chilton-Wren v. 
Olds, 1 P.3d 693 (Alaska 2000), the Alaska Supreme Court held that the defendant (who properly 
filed her demand for a jury) did not waive her right to a jury in the damages trial by asserting her 
counterclaims to abate the amount of rent due in the eviction hearing.

Both parties must have all written documents relating to the case with them in 
court. This may include receipts for rent, invoices for repairs, photographs, etc.   

If either party wishes to have witnesses testify at the damages trial, that party 
must arrange to have the witnesses present at the time of the trial.  If a party wants 
to appear telephonically or have a witness appear telephonically, permission must 
be obtained from the court prior to the trial.   

The parties can request that the court issue subpoenas ordering witnesses to 
appear in court.  The booklet “How to Subpoena a Witness” (CIV-109) is 
available at the court. 

he damages trial will generally proceed as follows: 

On the day of your trial, check the court calendar for your courtroom 
assignment.  All parties should be inside the courtroom at the time 
scheduled for the trial. 

The judge or the clerk will ask you to come forward when the judge is

VI.  DEFAULT JUDGMENT 
 
If the defendant does not file an answer, the plaintiff can ask the court for a judgment by 
default against the defendant.  (Civil Rule 55)  The procedure for getting a default 
judgment depends on whether or not the defendant appeared at the eviction hearing.  

 NOTE * If you seek entry of a default, and the amount of damages you seek is greater 
than what was in the original complaint, a default cannot be entered until you serve the 
defendant(s) with either a copy of the Default Application (with attachments) or an 
amended complaint specifying the new amount of damages you are requesting.  Service 
must be by process server, certified mail restricted delivery, or other acceptable Civil 
Rule 4 service. 

f the defendant does not file a written answer to the complaint, whether or not they 
appeared in court for the eviction hearing or filed any other written response with the court, 
the procedure for obtaining a default judgment is explained below. 
 

Prepare Application 

First, prepare an application for entry of default.  You can use court form CIV-740 
Default Application, Affidavit and Entry.  Type or print neatly using black ink. 

ase Caption.  Fill out the top of the form (the court location, the names of the 

parties and the case number) the same way the complaint is filled out. 

Affidavit Section.  The numbered instructions below correspond to the numbered 
paragraphs in the affidavit section. 

 
Fill in the name and date served for each defendant who was served with 
the summons and complaint.  Attach the original Return of Service for 
each defendant if it has not already been filed with the court.   
 
Check the court file to make sure that no answer has been filed.  

  C

1. 

2. 

 
3-4. 

If the defendant is a person under age 18, a person in the active military 
service or a mentally incompetent person, the CIV-740 Default 
Application form cannot be used to obtain a default judgment because 
there are special laws protecting these people. These laws may require the 
appointment of a lawyer or guardian for the defendant at your expense or 
may prevent you from getting a default judgment.  You will probably want 
to consult a lawyer.

Unpaid Rent.  List the amount owed for each month. 
Example: 
Unpaid Rent - $400 a month for June and July = $800 

Calculation of the amount owed.  You must attach documentation to 
support all claims  

payments. 
 
Damages to premises  (Itemize).   

Example: 
Replace window screens

Total Damages 

$100

$190 

For the above example, attach an invoice from the hardware store 
and/or window repair person, and the invoice from the cleaning 
service.  If you are charging for time you spent cleaning or making 
repairs, you should itemize your hourly rate and the hours you 
worked. 

 

Late fee.  Late fees will only be allowed if the rental agreement or 
lease has a provision for late fees.  Additionally, late fees are 
usually not allowed after the tenant has left the premises.  Instead, 
the plaintiff is generally entitled to recover prejudgment interest 
after the date of service of the summons and complaint.  See AS 
09.30.070 and AS 45.45.010(b). 
 
Subtract Amounts Defendant Paid to Plaintiff 

Security Deposit.  If you received a security deposit from 
the defendant, check the “Yes” box and fill in the amount 
received.  Check the “No” box if you did not receive a 
security deposit. 

Other Payments.  If you have received any money from the 
defendant since filing the complaint, check the “Yes” box 
and fill in the amount received.  If no payments have been 
received, check the “No” box.

Actual Attorney Fees. 

Skip this section unless an attorney represented you in this case.  Do not 
include any attorney fees previously awarded to you in the Judgment for 
Possession. 

AS 34.03.350 clarifies that attorney fees shall be allowed to the prevailing 
party.  
 
Prejudgment Interest. 

8. 

Prejudgment interest is interest on the principal amount due from the date 
it became due until the date the judgment is entered.  Usually, the court 
will calculate prejudgment interest from the date the summons and 
complaint were served on the defendant unless the judge orders otherwise. 

f you want interest to begin on a date other than the date the summons 
was served, you must attach a separate computation sheet showing the 
amounts due, the dates they became due, the interest rates and interest 
calculations, any payments, and how such payments were applied to 
interest and principal.  (Civil Rule 58.2(b)). 

enerally, prejudgment interest will not be awarded on unpaid rent if late 

fees have been assessed.

9. 

Prepare a proposed Default Judgment form.  You can get  this form (CIV-
745) from the clerk’s office. Complete the case caption and the case 
number as you did on your Default Application.  The court will complete 
the rest of the judgment.  File the proposed judgment with your Default 
Application, Affidavit and Entry. 

Signature Section.  Your signature on this form must be notarized. Sign and date the 
form in front of a notary public, court clerk, or other person authorized to administer 
oaths.  Print your name and mailing address and have the notary sign and seal the 
notary section. 

Certificate of Service Box.  Before you file the Default Application with the court 
clerk, you must complete the Certificate of Service box on page 3 of the application 
form and send a copy of the application (and all its attachments) by first-class mail 
to each defendant named on the application.  (Civil Rule 55(a)(2)) 

Note:  You cannot serve the defendant at the address from which the defendant was 
evicted unless the defendant’s current address and whereabouts are not readily 
ascertainable.  (Civil Rule 85(a)(5)) 

Suggestions for ways to readily ascertain the defendant’s current address: 
 
 
 

Check the court file. 
Call the defendant and request a current address. 
If you do not have a telephone number for the defendant, call directory 
assistance in all cities where you think the defendant may live for a current 
address or telephone number. 
Contact any references that were listed on the rental agreement or lease.

File the Default Application (and attachments) with the court.  There is no 
additional fee for this. You can file the documents in person in the clerk’s office 
or mail them to the court using first-class mail. 
 
Court Review 

The court clerk will review your documents and determine whether default can be 
entered. 

If there are any deficiencies in your documents, the court will notify you. You 
must correct the problem or the court will not process your application for entry 
of default and your case will be dismissed for lack of prosecution.  (Civil Rule 
85(a)(6)). 

Occasionally, the court will have questions or need additional information 
regarding the damages you are claiming.  The court may schedule a damages 
hearing to address these questions.  If a hearing is scheduled, you will be notified 
of the hearing date by mail.  At this hearing, you will be asked to provide 
additional documentation or testimony under oath about the damages.

CIV-720 EVICTION BOOKLET (5/18)

If you think a default judgment was improperly entered against you, you 
can ask the court to set aside the judgment.  To do this, you must file with 
the court a request to set aside default judgment.  Your request must be 
filed within a reasonable time after the default judgment was entered 
against you. Civil Rules 55(e) and 60(b).  You must also serve a copy of 
your request on the opposing party in the case and show proof to the court 
that you did this.  There is currently no court form for this request, 
however, you can review Small Claims form SC-24 for an example of 
what a request should look like. 

n your request to set aside default judgment, you must usually show two 
things: 

there are facts which show you could win the case if a trial were 
held; and 
there was a good reason why you failed to appear at trial or answer 
the complaint. 

The court will allow the other party an opportunity to respond in writing to 
your request.  The court will review both statements and notify you in 
writing of its decision.  The court will not set aside a default judgment 
unless you give a good reason. 

Filing a request to set aside a default judgment does not automatically stop 
the judgment creditor from having a Writ of Execution issued to collect 
the judgment.  If you wish to keep the creditor from having a Writ of 
Execution issued against you, you must (1) file a motion requesting a stay 
of execution, and (2) file a bond or make a cash deposit with the court in 
the amount of the judgment, plus interest.  You should contact the court 
for further information if you wish to post a bond. 

  I

a. 

b. 

If either party believes the court applied the law incorrectly or reached a 
decision which is not supported by the evidence presented, that party may 
appeal the judgment.  Appeals are complicated, and you should consider 
talking to a lawyer if you want to appeal. 

An appeal does not automatically give you a new trial.  The court that 
hears your appeal will not accept any new evidence.  The only information 
the court will consider on appeal is (1) the tape recording of the trial, (2) 
any items presented as evidence at the trial, (3) the documents in the court 
file, and (4) legal memoranda.

If your case was heard in the district court, your case will be appealed to 
the superior court.  If your case was heard in the superior court, your case 
will be appealed to the supreme court. 

Your appeal to either court must be filed within 30 days from the date the 
judgment is distributed. 

For information about how to appeal your case to the superior court, ask 
the court clerk for the booklet Instructions For Filing An Appeal From 
The District Court To The Superior Court (AP-200). 

There are currently no court forms or instructions regarding how to file an 
appeal to the supreme court.  For information about this type of appeal, 
see the Rules of Appellate Procedure in the Alaska Rules of Court. 

OTE: Filing an appeal does not automatically prevent the plaintiff from 

evicting the tenant or from enforcing (collecting) a money judgment.  A 
tenant who appeals the court's eviction judgment can ask the court to 
allow him/her to stay on the premises until the appeal is heard.  (The court 
may require that the tenant post a bond with the court pending a decision 
on the appeal.)  For information about how to postpone enforcement of the 
judgment during an appeal, see the AP-200 booklet mentioned above. 

  N

The  court  does  NOT  collect  the  judgment  for  the  prevailing  party.    If  the 
judgment debtor (the losing party) will not pay voluntarily, the judgment creditor 
(the  party  who  wins  the  money  judgment)  may  ask  the  court  to  issue  a  Writ  of 
Execution.  

 Writ of Execution is a court order directing a peace officer or process server to 
take  property  of  the  debtor  to  pay  the  judgment.    Property  can  include  money, 
bank accounts, wages, personal and real property or any other asset belonging to 
the debtor which has value. 

or information about this, ask the court clerk for a copy of Execution Procedure:  

Judgment Creditor Booklet (CIV-550). 

or  information  about  the  rights  of  the  debtor,  ask  the  clerk  for  a  copy  of  the
