INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILING 
CHILD CUSTODY CASE 

  You and the defendant are the biological parents of the children.  (Both parents must be 
listed on the children's birth certificates.  If not, see page 10 of these instructions.) 

  You are not married to the other parent of the children. 
  The children are living with one or both parents. 

 

  There is no custody order currently in effect (other than in a Domestic Violence case). 

  The courts of Alaska have the authority (jurisdiction) to decide custody of the 

children.  For Alaska courts to have jurisdiction, the children usually must have lived 
in Alaska for the last six months.  (Other ways for the courts to get jurisdiction are 
described in Alaska Statute 25.30.300.) 
 

If any of the above are not true, you should talk with a lawyer for advice. 

OTE:  If you are a person under the age of 18 and you are not legally emancipated, you 
may use these forms to petition for custody, but you must notify the court clerk of your age 
when you file your petition.

SECTION 2 
 
STEPS FOR FILING CASE 
 

NOTE:  These forms and instructions are for parties who are not represented by attorneys. 

tep 1.  

Fill out the following forms (which are attached to these instructions): 

Page 4 of 24 
DR-415 (10/18)(cs)(duplex) 
Instructions For Custody Complaint 

After completing and signing the forms, make two copies of every form.  One 
copy is for you.   The other copy will be served on the defendant as explained in 
Step 5. 

File the original forms at the nearest court and pay the filing fee in the amount 
specified in Administrative Rule 9(b).  If you cannot afford this fee, ask the clerk 
for form TF-920, Request for Exemption from Payment of Fees. 

Summons.  When you file the Complaint, the clerk will issue a “Summons” that 
directs the defendant to answer your Complaint.  The clerk also may give you two 
copies of a Pretrial Order.  One copy is for you, and one is for you to serve on the 
defendant.  Be sure to read your copy.  This order has important instructions about 
how your case will proceed. 

Serving the Defendant.  You must arrange to have the documents listed below 
“served” on the defendant.  “Served” means to have these documents given to the 
defendant by a process server, certified mail (restricted delivery), or in another 
way allowed by court rule.  See the booklet How to Serve A Summons (CIV-106). 

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

The following documents must be served on the defendant: 

A copy of the Summons 

A copy of each document you filed with the court (all the documents listed 
in Step 1) 

A blank Answer Packet (DR-440) 

A copy of any Pretrial Order issued by the court in your case. 

REMEMBER:  If the documents are served on the defendant by certified mail, it 
is very important that you keep the green postal card returned to you by the Post 
Office.  This card is proof that the defendant was served by certified mail with 
restricted delivery, and you will be required to submit the card to the court if the 
defendant does not file an Answer to your Complaint.

greement.  If the defendant's Answer agrees with everything you requested 
in your Complaint or if you and the defendant can reach a written agreement 
resolving all issues concerning the children, you do not need to ask for a trial.  
Instead, you should ask the court to set a hearing to review your agreement

n some courts, mediation at a reduced cost is available to help you resolve 
any differences and reach a mutually acceptable agreement without a trial.  If 
you are interested, ask the court clerk if mediation is available in your 
community. 

rial Setting. When the defendant sends you the Answer, ask the clerk how to 

get your case set for trial.   

●  In some courts, your case will be set automatically for trial after the 

defendant’s Answer is filed.  The court will send you an Order which will 
set the trial date and establish deadlines for other things you must do 
before the trial. 

●  In other courts, you will need to file a Memorandum to Set Civil Case for 
Trial (form CIV-200).  See Section 5 (page 13 of these instructions) on 
how to complete the CIV-200 form.  After the Memorandum to Set is 
filed, the court will send you an Order which will set the trial date and 
establish deadlines for other things you must do before the trial.

and enter a custody judgment.  You can use parenting plan form DR-475, 
(available online and at the court), to document your agreement. 

If the defendant does not file an Answer, you can ask the court for a default 
judgment against the defendant.    A “default judgment” is a judgment issued 
in your favor because the defendant failed to answer your complaint.  See 
Section 4 (page 11 of these instructions) on how to obtain a default judgment.

SECTION 3 

 
INFORMATION ABOUT 
LEGAL CUSTODY, PHYSICAL CUSTODY, 
VISITATION, CHILD SUPPORT, AND THE PFD 

n determining custody and visitation, the judge must decide what is in the best interests of the 
child. See page 22 for a list of factors the judge must consider in making this determination.  You 
must be prepared to explain to the judge how your proposal for custody and visitation is in the 
best interests of the child.  See the parenting agreement form (DR-475, available online and at 
the court) for examples of the issues you should think about when preparing your custody and 
visitation proposal. 

ote:  If either party has a history of perpetrating domestic violence, it will affect the court’s 

Legal custody means the right and obligation to make decisions about a child’s upbringing, 
including schooling, medical care, and financial matters.  There are two types of legal custody. 

ole legal custody means that only one parent is given the legal authority to make 

decisions about the child.  If the parents do not agree on a decision about the child, the 
parent with sole legal custody has the right to make the final decision. 

Shared legal custody means that both parents are given the legal authority to make 
decisions about the child.  The parents share responsibility in making the major decisions 
affecting the child’s welfare.1 

  Alaska’s legislature has expressed a policy favoring shared legal custody regardless 
of the physical custody arrangement.  The legislature has stated that “it is in the 
public interest to encourage parents to share the rights and responsibilities of child 
rearing” and that “it is the intent of the legislature that both parents have the 
opportunity to guide and nurture their child . . .”2 

  However, shared legal custody is appropriate only when the parents can cooperate 
and communicate regarding the child.3  If the parents cannot discuss these matters 
cooperatively and share decision making, shared legal custody will not be awarded.

Physical Custody. 

hysical custody means where a child actually lives.  As a general matter, it is very rare for a 
child to live with one parent 100% of the time.  For purposes of calculating the amount of child 
support, Civil Rule 90.3(f) describes four types of physical custody: 

  Primary physical custody means that the children reside with one parent more than 

70% of the year. 

  Shared physical custody means that the children reside with each parent for a 

specified period of at least 30% of the year.  If you want shared physical custody, you 
must describe when the children will reside with each parent.  If either parent is 
planning a move to another community in the near future, you should explain how 
shared custody will be continued.  See AS 25.20.090 on page 24 for factors the court 
must consider in determining whether to award shared custody. 

  Divided physical custody means that each parent has primary custody of at least one 

child and the parents do not share custody of any of their children. 

  Hybrid physical custody means at least one parent has primary custody of at least one 

of the children, and the parents share custody of at least one of their children. 

isitation. 

isitation is the right of a parent and child to contact and visit one another when the child is 

residing or visiting with the other parent.  It is generally desirable that minor children have 
frequent and continuing contact with both parents so that both parents can maintain a good 
relationship with the children and share the rights and responsibilities of child rearing. 

n the Visitation section on page 3 of your complaint, describe what you think is a reasonable 
visitation schedule.  Be prepared to explain to the judge why your proposal is in the best interests 
of the child.  The following are some things to consider in your visitation proposal: 

 

  The importance to the child of having an opportunity to build and 

maintain a relationship with the other parent 

  Whether there should be overnight visits during the week 
  Weekends 
  Holidays and birthdays 
  Summer vacations 
  Special family functions 
  Where the parents live 
  Costs of travel (who will pay for the children’s trips) 
  What if one of the parents moves 
  Age of the children 
  School attendance and school activities during visitation

Instructions For Custody Complaint 

Be sure to check the second box in the Visitation section of the complaint if you are concerned 
about your safety or your children’s safety when with the other parent (for example, if there is a 
history of domestic violence, child abuse, sexual abuse, alcohol or drug abuse, etc.).  Then 
explain what restrictions you want placed on the other parent’s visitation.4 

  Support is paid on behalf of the children, not for the benefit of the custodial parent. 

  The Alaska Supreme Court has established guidelines in Civil Rule 90.3 which judges must 

follow to determine the amount of child support. 

  Normally, child support stops when a child reaches age 18.6  However, you can ask that 
support continue to be provided for each child while the child is 18 if the child is (1) 
unmarried, (2) actively pursuing a high school diploma or equivalent level of training, and 
(3) living as a dependent with a parent.  You can ask the court to order that the support be 
paid to the parent with whom the child is living or directly to the 18 year old.  Check the box 
in Section 9(a) of the complaint if you want support continued while the children are 18. 

Income Withholding.  The court will be required to order immediate income withholding 
from the person ordered to pay child support and order the support paid through the Child 
Support Services Division (CSSD) unless one of the three exceptions authorized by statute7 
applies.  For an explanation of those exceptions, see form DR-10 (available at the court).  If 
there is a reason why the court should not order immediate income withholding, be sure to 
write that in Section 9(c) of the complaint. 

  You may want to request the services of the Alaska Child Support Services Division (CSSD).  
If you do, CSSD will maintain records of support payments and enforce the support order.  
For example, CSSD will serve an order enforcing the income withholding order described 
above on the employer of the parent ordered to pay support.  If income withholding is 
ordered but you do not apply for CSSD's services, you will have to serve the appropriate 
court orders on the employer. Once the employer has been served (by CSSD or by you), the 
withheld money must be paid to CSSD. 

f you want to request CSSD's services, fill out the attached application form (DR-315) and 
file it with your complaint. 
If the parent with custody of the children is receiving assistance from the Alaska Temporary  
Assistance Program (ATAP), child support payments must be made to CSSD. 
 

  I

For more information about CSSD, read the attached information sheet (DR-316). 

 

                                                         
4 See AS 25.20.061 about the types of restrictions the court can impose in proceedings involving 
domestic violence. 
5 AS 25.20.030. 
6 Child support also stops if a child is emancipated (for example, if the child marries or obtains a 
court order of emancipation under AS 09.55.590).

Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD). 

ou should ask the court to designate which parent will apply for the Alaska PFD on behalf of 

the children while they are minors (under age 18).  If both parents apply for the children, the 
Department of Revenue will not send the dividends to either one.  The Department will hold the 
dividends until they receive a court order directing who should receive the dividends or until one 
parent withdraws the applications he/she filed on behalf of the children.  15 AAC 23.223(h). 

arent Information in Section 1 of Complaint. 

f there is a question or disagreement about who is the father of the children, that question will 
need to be resolved before the court decides the custody case. 

or example, if the person listed as the father on page 1 of the Complaint is not listed as the 
father on the birth certificate of each child, but both parents agree that he is the father, you can 
do either of the following: 

File an Affidavit of Paternity with the Health Analytics and Vital Records office.  This 
affidavit form (VS-16) is available at courthouses and at Vital Records offices.  Both 
parents must sign the affidavit. 

State in both the Complaint and the Answer in your custody case that he is the father.  If 
both the plaintiff and the defendant agree in their pleadings (the Complaint and the 
Answer) that he is the father, there will not be a paternity issue in the case. 

 
If the defendant’s Answer denies or questions paternity, the court probably will require that this 
issue be resolved before the custody case can proceed.  The following are two ways to get 
paternity established: 

Apply to the Child Support Services Division (CSSD) for a determination of paternity.  
The forms for this are available at CSSD offices and on the CSSD website:  
www.childsupport.alaska.gov  See 15 AAC 125.212 – .259 in the Alaska Administrative 
Code for a description of this procedure. 

Ask the court for an order establishing paternity.  You can find forms to establish 
paternity and learn more here: http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/shcpaternity.htm.  

he court also may allow the paternity question to be contested as part of the custody case. 

f the defendant is named as the father in the Complaint but not on the birth certificate, and the 
defendant does not file an Answer, the court may or may not be willing to enter a default custody 
judgment and child support order in the case.

SECTION 4 

 
HOW TO OBTAIN A DEFAULT JUDGMENT 
(If Defendant Fails to Respond to the Complaint) 

f the defendant does not file an Answer, you may obtain a default judgment8 by doing the 
following: 

Prepare an application for entry of default. Use form DR-425, Default Application – 
Child Custody, available online or at the clerk’s office.  You must sign the application in 
front of a notary public.  A court clerk can provide this notary service for you (at no 
charge) when you bring the application to court.  You must bring a photo ID with you for 
the notarization. 

Attach proof of service showing that the defendant was served with the summons and 
other documents.  Proof of service will be one of the following:  

 
 
 

an original Return of Service completed by the process server 
the original green postal card returned by the Post Office  
the original Affidavit of Publication 

 

For more information about proof of service, see the booklet CIV-106, How to Serve a 
Summons.  The booklet is available online. 
 
If the defendant filed any written response with the court (for example: a letter), you must 
send a copy of your Default Application and all attachments to the defendant by first 
class mail.  You then must file a certificate of service with the court certifying that you 
did this and when you did it. 

Keep a copy of the Default Application and the proof of service of the summons, etc. for 
yourself. 

File the original Default Application and the proof of service with the court. 

The court then will schedule the case for hearing and send you a notice of the hearing.  At 
the hearing, the court will decide whether it is in the best interests of the child to grant the 
requests you made in your complaint.  See pages 14-17 for some suggestions about how 
to organize the information you will need to present to the judge.

At the hearing, be prepared to tell the court the following: 

Why your custody proposal is in the best interests of the child.  See page 22 for a 
list of the items the court must consider in making this decision. 
Why your proposal concerning visitation for the other parent is fair and in the best 
interests of the child. 

Any information about the defendant's financial ability to pay child support.  For 
example, information about: 

the defendant's current, or most recent, employment 
how much the defendant usually makes or can make 
the type of work the defendant does 
defendant's education and training 

• 
• 
• 
•

so.  Otherwise, you will be asked to testify under oath about the accuracy of the 
information. 

At the end of the default hearing, the judge may require you to prepare proposed findings 
of fact and conclusions of law and a proposed judgment.  There are forms for this

HOW TO GET A TRIAL DATE 

   

Ask the clerk which of the following procedures applies to your case: 

SECTION 5 

Page 13 of 24 
DR-415 (10/18)(cs)(duplex) 
Instructions For Custody Complaint 

The court will send you an Order which will set the trial date and establish deadlines for 
other things you must do before the trial.  Be sure to follow all the deadlines set out in the 
order, including discovery, witness lists and submission of child support financial 
information.  If you do not comply with the Order, your trial will be delayed. 

NOTE:  If you do not understand how to comply with the pretrial order, you may want to 
consult with an attorney. 

Discovery.  Discovery is the exchange of information and all documentary 
evidence between parties before trial.  Civil Rule 26 sets out the rules that the 
parties must follow regarding what information must be given to the other parent 
and when the information must be given. 

Witness List.  The court usually orders each parent to file with the court an 
alphabetical list of all the witnesses that the parent intends to have testify at trial.  
The list must also include each witness' address and telephone number.  There is 
no court form available for this.  You must send a copy of the list to the other 
parent. 

NOTE:  If you plan to testify, you should also list yourself as a witness. 

Submission of Financial Information Necessary to Calculate Child Support.  If 
you have not already filed the DR-305 Child Support Guidelines Affidavit and 
proof of income (tax returns and pay stubs), do so now!  Be sure to send a copy of 
the Affidavit and proof to the other parent.

Why you believe it is in the best interests of the children for you to have custody of 
them.  The following are examples of items you might want to discuss: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

who have the children lived with 
who has been the primary care giver for the children 
how are the children doing 
why you are a responsible parent 
do either of the parents have substance abuse problems and how does that 
affect the children 

See Section 9 for a complete list of the things the court must consider in determining 
the best interests of the children. 

What amount of visitation the other parent should be allowed, and your proposed 
visitation schedule.  You must be able to explain to the judge why your visitation 
schedule is reasonable and in the children’s best interests.  If you propose that the 
other parent get no visitation, you must be prepared to explain to the judge why that 
would be in the children’s best interests. 

Why your proposed child support amount is correct, whether or not the amount is 
disputed. 

If the other parent disputes the court’s authority to decide custody of the children, 
bring witnesses and/or documents to show that the children have lived in Alaska for 
the last six months. 

For each issue in your outline, list the witnesses and documents you will submit to 
support your claims.

Things to include in this outline: 

A witness should be someone who has information about why it would be in the best 
interests of the children to be placed in your custody. For example, you might want to ask 
family members, social services representatives or baby sitters to testify as witnesses for 
you. 
 
If you want to have witnesses testify, it is your responsibility to arrange to have the 
witnesses present at the time of the trial.  If a witness cannot appear in person, you can 
ask the court for permission to have the witness testify by telephone.  You must get this 
permission before the hearing.  Ask the court clerk how to get the court’s permission and 
how the call will be set up.  Note: You will have to pay for the call. You must make these 
arrangements as far in advance of the trial as possible.

When you ask people to testify for you, some may tell you that they are unable or 
unwilling to testify without a court order.  If that happens, you may ask the court to issue a 
subpoena (a court order that requires the person to appear and testify).  See CIV-109, How 
to Subpoena a Witness, available online and at the clerk’s office.  Note:  You must pay a 
witness fee to each witness you subpoena. 
 
Collect Supporting Documents. 

You must also bring to the trial any documents you want the court to consider.  Examples of 
documents you might want to bring with you: 

financial records to help decide the amount of child support (information about your 
income or the other parent’s income such as tax returns and pay stubs) 

the children’s birth certificates (for example, if there is a dispute about who is the 
father of the children) 

Note:  You may not be able to use some kinds of documents at the trial.  For example: letters 
or affidavits from people who are not present to testify.  The court probably will not let you 
present such letters and affidavits as evidence because the other party would not have a 
chance to ask the writer questions about the document. 

Prepare an Opening Statement. 

he judge may ask you to make an opening statement, so you should be prepared to give a 

brief summary (2-3 minutes) of the testimony you and your witnesses will give.

Day of Trial. 

Be sure to get to court a little early on the day of your trial.  This will give you time to 
become familiar with the courtroom.  Also be sure all your witnesses are there. 

n small towns and villages the court may be only a single room and yours may be the 
only case scheduled.  In cities there will be a courthouse with several courtrooms. If you 
cannot tell from your notice of trial or from the posted court calendar which courtroom 
your trial will be in, ask the court clerk or receptionist for directions. 

ou may have to wait before your case is called because there may be other cases 

scheduled before yours. 
 
During Trial. 

Each party will have the opportunity to present evidence. You must present your own case 
at the trial.  Court rules state that no one except you (or your attorney if you have one) can 
represent you in court. 

Your case must be presented first, followed by the defendant’s case.  After each of your 
witnesses have testified, the defendant will have a chance to cross-examine (question) the 
witness about the testimony. 

hen all of your witnesses have finished testifying, the defendant will have a chance to 
present the defendant’s case and witnesses.  You then will have a chance to cross-examine 
each of the defendant’s witnesses. 

efore beginning to testify, each party and each witness will be placed under oath and will 

have a continuing obligation to speak only the truth.

Some suggestions for presenting your case: 

If the judge asks for an opening statement, it should be brief (2 to 3 minutes) 
and to the point, a summary of what you want and why the judge should 
order it. 

Make sure you have talked with your witnesses about why you want them to 
testify.  Remind them that they need to talk about things they have 
personally seen, not things you or someone else told them.  For example, 
they could testify about how long you have been the primary caregiver or 
about facts that show how well you have provided for the children. 

Some judges will allow your witnesses to present a statement of what they 
want the court to know, other judges will require that you ask questions of 
your witness to present their testimony.  Try to ask open ended questions 
rather than ones which call for a yes or no answer. 

Make sure you have your documents in court with you to support the points 
you want to make. 

Refer to your outline so you don’t forget anything.  If you forget to present 
something at trial, the judge won’t be able to consider that point. 

At a minimum, you will have to show why your custody proposal is in the 
best interests of the children, what your proposed visitation schedule will be 
and why it is in the best interests of the children and why the proposed child 
support calculations are correct if disputed. 

Don’t assume that the court knows all about your case.  You have to present 
facts to support all the points you want to make.  The judge can not fill in the 
blanks for you. 

 
After Trial 

C. 
 

 

After all the testimony has been presented, the judge will make a decision.  The judge may 
make the decision immediately or the judge may take some time to consider the evidence 
and make the decision later. 

The judge may require you to prepare proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law 
and a proposed judgment.  There are forms for this available at the clerk’s office (form 
DR-460 and DR-465).  Civil Rule 78(a). 

ou will get a copy of the written judgment when it is completed.  Make sure the court has 

your current mailing address.

AFTER THE COURT ENTERS A CUSTODY JUDGMENT 

SECTION  8 

 

 

Appeal. 

f you believe the court applied the law incorrectly or reached a decision which is not supported 
by the evidence presented, you may appeal the custody judgment or the child support order to the 
Alaska Supreme Court. 

n appeal does not automatically give you a new trial.  The supreme court will not accept any 
new evidence.  The only information the supreme court will consider on appeal is (1) a transcript 
of the tape recording of the trial (or those parts of it designated by the parties), (2) any items 
presented as evidence at the trial, (3) the documents in the court file, and (4) legal briefs. 

o appeal, you must file a Notice of Appeal with the Clerk of the Appellate Courts within 15 
days after the date the judgment is distributed.9 The Notice of Appeal must be accompanied by 
the items specified in Appellate Rule 204(b), including a filing fee in the amount specified in 
Administrative Rule 9(a) or motion to waive the fee.  The court does not provide forms or 
instructions for appeals to the supreme court.  See Appellate Rule 218 for more information 
about appeal procedure in custody cases.  Appeals are complicated, and you should consider 
seeing a lawyer if you want to appeal. 

odification. 

f circumstances change after the judgment is entered, you can ask the court to change the 
custody judgment and the support order.  The court has jurisdiction to modify these orders while 
the children are under 18. 

Change In Custody or Visitation 

A change in custody will not be granted unless there has been a substantial change in 
circumstances since the last order was entered.  Also, the requested change must be in the 
best interests of the children. 

n order to obtain an increase or decrease in support payments because of a change in 
income of the person making the payments, the change in income must be both long term 
and significant.  The court will not modify a support order because of a minor or 
temporary increase or decrease in income.  The general guideline for determining 
whether a change in income is significant is if the change is enough to raise or lower the 
support payments by 15% or more.

ustody Decisions:  "Best Interests of the Child"10 

o decide who gets custody of a child, the court must determine what is in the best interests of 

the child.  The court must consider the following: 

the physical, emotional, mental, religious, and social needs of the child; 

the capability and desire of each parent to meet these needs: 

the child's preference if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to form a 
preference; 

the love and affection existing between the child and each parent; 

the length of time the child has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment and the 
desirability of maintaining continuity; 

the willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and 
continuing relationship between the other parent and the child, except that the 
court may not consider this willingness and ability if one parent shows that the 
other parent has sexually assaulted or engaged in domestic violence against the 
parent or a child, and that a continuing relationship with the other parent will 
endanger the health or safety of either the parent or the child; 

any evidence of domestic violence, child abuse, or child neglect in the proposed 
custodial household or a history of violence between the parents; 

evidence that substance abuse by either parent or other members of the household 
directly affects the emotional or physical well-being of the child; 
other factors that the court considers pertinent.

DR-415 (10/18)(cs)(duplex) 
Instructions For Custody Complaint 

In awarding custody, the court must only consider facts that directly affect the child’s wellbeing. 

AS 25.24.150 limits the court’s ability to award custody if either parent “has a history of 
perpetrating domestic violence against the other parent, a child, or a domestic living partner:” 

(g)  There is a rebuttable presumption that a parent who has a history of perpetrating 
domestic violence against the other parent, a child, or a domestic living partner 
may not be awarded sole legal custody, sole physical custody, joint legal custody, 
or joint physical custody of a child. 

(h) 

(i) 

 

 

(j) 

(k) 

(l) 

A parent has a history of perpetrating domestic violence under (g) of this section 
if the court finds that, during one incident of domestic violence, the parent caused 
serious physical injury or the court finds that the parent has engaged in more than 
one incident of domestic violence.  The presumption may be overcome by a 
preponderance of the evidence that the perpetrating parent has successfully 
completed an intervention program for batterers, where reasonably available, that 
the parent does not engage in substance abuse, and that the best interests of the 
child require that parent’s participation as a custodial parent because the other 
parent is absent, suffers from a diagnosed mental illness that affects parenting 
abilities, or engages in substance abuse that affects parenting abilities, or because 
of other circumstances that affect the best interests of the child. 

If the court finds that both parents have a history of perpetrating domestic 
violence under (g) of this section, the court shall either 
(1) 

award sole legal and physical custody to the parent who is less likely to 
continue to perpetrate the violence and require that the custodial parent 
complete a treatment program; or 
if necessary to protect the welfare of the child, award sole legal or physical 
custody, or both, to a suitable third person if the person would not allow 
access to a violent parent except as ordered by the court. 

(2) 

If the court finds that a parent has a history of perpetrating domestic violence 
under (g) of this section, the court shall allow only supervised visitation by that 
parent with the child, conditioned on that parent’s participating in and 
successfully completing an intervention program for batterers, and a parenting 
education program, where reasonably available, except that the court may allow 
unsupervised visitation if it is shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the 
violent parent has completed a substance abuse treatment program if the court 
considers it appropriate, is not abusing alcohol or psychoactive drugs, does not 
pose a danger of mental or physical harm to the child, and unsupervised visitation 
is in the child’s best interests. 

The fact that an abused parent suffers from the effects of the abuse does not 
constitute a basis for denying custody to the abused parent unless the court finds 
that the effects of the domestic violence are so severe that they render the parent 
unable to safely parent the child. 

Except as provided in AS 25.20.095 and 25.20.110, a court may not consider a 
parent's activation to military service and deployment in determining the best 
interest of the child under (c) of this section. In this subsection, “deployment” has 
the meaning given in AS 25.20.095.

Access to records of the child.  A parent who is not granted custody under AS

dependents anymore.11   Instead, there is a larger child tax credit.12   To get the child tax credit 
and other tax benefits, you must meet the requirements described in Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) Publication 501.  Check that you are viewing the publication for the current tax year 
because the IRS updates publications annually.     

o get the child tax credit, your child must be a “qualifying child.”   A qualifying child must 
have lived with you for more than half the year.  The “qualifying child” must not have provided 
over half of his or her own support during the calendar year and must also meet a few other age 
and relationship-to-filer requirements.  Depending on your circumstances, your child may be a 
“qualifying child” for more than one person, such as the child’s other parent or even the child’s 
grandparent.  If you think this might apply to you, review the “Qualifying Child of More Than 
One Person” section of IRS Publication 501.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
