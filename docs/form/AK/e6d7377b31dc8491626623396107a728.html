      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADULT CHANGE OF NAME 
 
Safety Note: 
The court will normally post a public notice about a change of name request on the Alaska 
Court System’s legal notice website.  However, if you have personal safety concerns about this 
public posting, you can ask the judge to waive (not have to do) this legal requirement.  In 
addition, you can ask that your case be kept confidential or that your name not be published in 
the case listed on the court’s public index (CourtView) on the internet.  For more information, 
see Step 2 of these instructions or contact your local court clerk. 

tep 1.  

Fill out the petition form and the vital records report form. 

a. 

Petition for Change of Name (form CIV-700). 

On the "AT" line at the top of the form, write the city where the court you will be 
filing at is located. 

Leave the "CASE NO." line blank.  The court clerk will assign the number and fill 
this in once you file with the court. 

On the "Petitioner" line and in section 1, write your current legal name.  Look at 
your original birth certificate (or the most recent legal document that changed 
your name, such as a marriage certificate or divorce decree) to make sure that 
you are spelling your current legal name exactly as it appears on those legal 
documents.  Check that any punctuation marks such as dashes and periods are 
exactly the same also.  You may not be able to get a birth certificate with your 
new name from Health Analytics and Vital Records if the current name submitted 
to the court does not exactly match existing records.  If you do not have a 
middle name, leave the line blank (do not write “N/A” or “none”). 

Section 2 asks whether you have another name that is different from the name 
on your birth certificate.  This section is to make it easier for people to change 
their birth certificate when their current legal name is not the same as their birth 
name, because the court can directly order the change.  If you are not 
interested in changing the name on your birth certificate, you can let the judge 
know this at the hearing 

Fill out the rest of the form.   Wait to sign the form until you are in front of a 
notary.   A court clerk can provide this notary service for you (at no charge) 
when you bring the petition to court.  You must bring a photo ID with you for 
the notarization.   
 
Application for Legal Name Change (form VS-405). 

b. 

Fill in items 1 through 7.  Sign and date the form where it asks for applicant’s 
signature and date.  The court clerk will fill in items 8 through 11, and also sign 
and date the bottom of the form. 

tep 2.  

Safety Concerns (form CIV-708).  [Optional.] 

If you have concerns about your personal safety if your proposed name change is 
posted publicly, you can ask the court to waive posting (that is, not require it to be 
posted).  Fill out Request to Waive Posting in Adult Change of Name Case (form CIV-
708) and attach it to your petition when you file the case.  This form also asks whether 
you want your case to be confidential or sealed, and whether you want the court to use

“Not Published” for your name on public CourtView.  The form explains in more detail 
what each of these requests means.  Only fill out page 1; page 2 is for the judge.  You 
can get this form notarized at the same time as your petition.   

The court may decide the request based only on what you wrote on the form, or the 
court may schedule a hearing to decide your request(s).  At this hearing, the court will 
only decide whether or not to grant a waiver of public posting and/or grant any requests 
for confidentiality.  This hearing will not approve the name change itself. 

If you file form CIV-708 at the same time as you open your case, then your case will not 
be public when it is opened, and the clerk will not post the proposed name change on 
the court’s website, until after the judge makes a decision on your request.  If the judge 
grants your request, the case will stay unavailable to the public and the proposed name 
change will not be posted.  If the judge denies your request, the clerk will wait at least 
ten days before making your case public.  This is to give you time to decide whether you 
want to withdraw (cancel) your petition for the name change.  If you withdraw, the case 
will be closed and will not be public.  If you decide not to withdraw, then after the 
waiting period, the court clerk will schedule a hearing on the name change, and a notice 
will be posted on the website. 

If you file form CIV-708 after your case is already open, then the case will remain public 
until the judge makes a decision on your request(s).  If the judge grants the request(s), 
the court clerk will immediately remove it from public view.  If the judge denies the 
request, your case will proceed as usual. 
  
Step 3.  

Copies. 

Make a copy of the petition, the vital records form, and any other attachments (such as 
form CIV-708) for yourself. 

tep 4.  

File in Court. 

File the originals of all forms in step 3 at the nearest superior court filing location (a list 
of locations is on page 6).  Pay the filing fee.  Fee amounts are listed in Administrative 
Rule 9.  If you cannot afford the fee, file form TF-920, Request for Exemption from 
Payment of Fees. 

tep 5.  

Order for Hearing.   

The court clerk will give or mail to you Order For Hearing, Posting, and Additional 
Service (form CIV-701).  This order will tell you (1) the date of your court hearing, (2) 
whether the court system will post notice,* and (3) whether or not you must do 
additional public posting or notify anyone else of your petition.  The hearing date must 
take place at least 40 days after the date of the order.   

Posting Notice on Court’s Website.  [Unless waived for safety concerns.] 

tep 6.  
 
The court will automatically post notice on the Alaska Court System’s legal notice 
website for four consecutive weeks, unless the court waived this requirement in a 
written order.*  After the posting, the clerk will file Clerk’s Certificate of Service of 
Posting (form TF-815) to the website. 

*  

See Step 2 or the text box at the beginning of these instructions for more information about how 
to request that the court not post notice.

tep 7.  

Additional Service.  [Only if ordered by the court.] 

The court may order you to do additional posting or notice.  Read your order (form CIV-
701) carefully to understand what the court is requiring you to do, including what proof 
you must provide that you completed it.  If you do not follow the court’s instructions, 
your name change may be delayed or denied.  The following paragraphs describe in 
detail some common orders you may see, but you should follow the instructions on your 
order if they are different than the instructions below. 

a. 

Notice to a Person, Agency, or Other Entity.  

  S

   

The order may tell you to give a copy of the notice to a specific person, agency, 
or entity (such as a corporation).  Unless the court gives you a specific method 
to do this, choose whichever method is likely to give the person actual notice.  
This could be mailing or emailing it to the person’s known work or home address, 
handing the person a physical copy, posting to a social networking account, or 
using a process server.  If the court orders you to use a specific method, then 
you must use that method.  Whichever method you use, once you have 
completed it, fill out Affidavit of Additional Service (form CIV-702).  The court 
may require you to provide a specific kind of proof of service, which you should 
attach to the affidavit.  File the original affidavit (and all attachments) with the 
court before the court hearing, or bring it with you to the hearing. 

Note: If you are on parole or supervised felony probation, you must give notice 
to your assigned parole or probation officer.  If you are incarcerated (for 
example, in jail, in prison, or at a halfway house), then you must give notice to 
your institutional probation officer, if you have one.  If you are required to 
register on the Sex Offender and Child Kidnapper Registry under AS 12.63.010, 
then you must notify the Department of Public Safety.  Read your order carefully 
for any other requirements or details. 

b. 

Publication in a Print Newspaper.   

Take the order to the listed newspaper and tell the newspaper staff that you 
need to publish the "Notice of Petition to Change Name" (on page 2 of the order) 
in the legal notices section of their newspaper, once each week for four 
consecutive weeks, before the date of the court hearing.  You will have to pay 
the newspaper for this service.  Do not wait to do this.  All four publications of 
the notice must happen before the court hearing.  After the notice has been 
published all four times, the newspaper will give you an "Affidavit of Publication" 
that will contain a copy of the published notice and the dates when it was 
published.  File this affidavit with the court before the court hearing, or bring it 
with you to the hearing. 

c. 

Posting to an Online Newspaper.   

Make copies of the notice and post it in the places listed in the order for the 
number of days stated in the order.  After posting is complete, get an affidavit of 
publication from the online publication’s publisher, manager, foreman, or 
principal clerk, or by the certificate of the attorney for the party at whose 
instance the service was made.  You must also get a printed copy of the posted 
notice with the name of the online publication and dates of posting.  Attach 
these documents to Affidavit of Additional Service (form CIV-702).  File the 
original affidavit with the court before the court hearing, or bring it with you to 
the hearing.

CIV-699 (2/23) 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADULT CHANGE OF NAME 

Civil Rule 84 
AS 09.55.010 

d. 

Posting in Public Places.   

Make copies of the notice and post it in the places listed in the order for the 
number of days stated in the order.  After posting is completed, fill out Affidavit 
o
Additional Service (form CIV-702).  File the original affidavit with the court 
 
f
before the court hearing, or bring it with you to the hearing. 

tep 8.  

Court Hearing.   

The hearing is usually short and fairly informal.   The judge will often start by making 
sure that any required notices were done.  Then, tell the judge why you want to change 
your name, and testify under oath to the judge that you are not seeking to change your 
name in order to avoid debts, defraud anyone, obstruct law enforcement, or interfere 
with another person’s rights. 

tep 9.  

Judgment for Change of Name.   

If the judge finds that there is no reasonable objection to the name change, and that it 
is not contrary to the public interest, the judge will sign a judgment allowing you to take 
the new name.  However, you cannot begin using the new name yet, because the 
judgment will not be effective until the rest of these steps are completed. 

tep 10. 

Posting Notice of Judgment.  [Unless waived for safety concerns.]  

The court will automatically post notice on the legal notice website for one week, unless 
the court waived this requirement in a written order.  After the posting, the clerk will file 
erk’s Certificate of Service of Posting (form TF-815) to the website. 
l
C

tep 11. 

Additional Service of Judgment.  [Only if ordered by the court.] 

The judge may order you to do additional posting or notice.  See Step 7 of these 
instructions for more information on this.  After you complete what the judge ordered 
you to do, fill out Affidavit of Additional Service (form CIV-702) and file the original with 
the court.  You must do this within 20 days of the date of the clerk’s distribution of 
the judgment.  

tep 12. 

Certificate of Name Change.   

Once any requirements in Steps 10 and 11 are complete, the clerk will send you 
Certificate of Name Change (form CIV-705).  If the judgment does not require additional 
service, then the clerk will issue this certificate automatically after the one-week posting 
on the court’s website, without waiting for any proof of posting from you. 

You can begin using your new name on the date stated in the Certificate of Name 
Change.  This date will be at least 30 days after the judgment was distributed.  The 
clerk will give you two copies of the certificate.  One will be a free certified copy.  If you 
need more certified copies, there will be a charge for them.  See Administrative Rule 9 
for current fees.

Social Security.  To avoid tax problems and help assure proper employment credit, you 
should notify the Social Security Administration of your name change.  Toll free 
telephone number: 1-800-772-1213. 

Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV).  If you have an Alaska driver's license or you own a 
vehicle registered in Alaska, you must send written notice of your name change to the 
Division of Motor Vehicles within 30 days.1  It is very important that you do this; 
you could receive a citation and have to pay a fine, or even be charged with a crime 
under certain circumstances, if you fail to do this.  Contact a DMV office to find out how 
the division wants to receive written notice.  To get a new driver's license or Alaska ID 
card, go to a DMV office and present a certified copy of the Certificate of Name Change 
(form CIV-705). 

Vital Records.  If you want a new birth certificate, contact the Vital Records office of the 
state in which you were born and pay any required fee. 

Sex Offender and Child Kidnapper Registry.  If you are required to register under AS 
12.63.010, then you must notify the nearest Alaska state trooper post or municipal 
police department of your new name by the next working day after receiving the 
Certificate of Name Change (form CIV-705).  Use Notification of Petition/Proof of Legal 
Name Change (form 12-299-74), available in paper copy from local law enforcement or 
online at https://sor.dps.alaska.gov/Home/Documents.  Failure to do this is a crime, 
with a penalty of up to five years in jail, depending on your criminal history.   

Other Records.  You may also need to change your name on such other records as bank 
accounts, insurance policies, the Alaska PFD Division, etc.

  T

he Alaska Statutes and Alaska Court Rules about name changes are: 

•  Civil Rule 84, which establishes the procedure for changing names. 

•  Alaska Statute 09.55.010, which gives the superior court the power to hear these cases 
and sets the standard the court must use in deciding whether to grant a name change.  
It also requires extra notice requirements for individuals that are incarcerated or 
charged with a crime, are on probation or parole, or must register on the sex offender 
or child kidnapper registry. 

•  Alaska Statute 25.24.165, which describes the procedure for changing a person's name 
in a divorce.  Also see AS 25.24.230(c)(2) & (f) concerning dissolutions of marriage. 

You can find the rules and statutes at all state courts, court law libraries, and many city 
libraries.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
