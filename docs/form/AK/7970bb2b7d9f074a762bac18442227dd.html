laska Court System Policies Against Discrimination 

t is the policy of the Alaska Court System that discrimination based upon physical or mental 
disability has no place in the provision of governmental services, funds, goods, facilities, advantages 
or privileges. No qualified individual with a disability will be excluded, by reason of such disability, 
from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of the Alaska 
Court System, or be subjected to discrimination by the Alaska Court System. 

t is the policy of the Alaska Court System that the services, programs, and activities of the court 
system be accessible to individuals with disabilities, as defined in the Americans With Disabilities 
Act of 1990. 

t is the policy of the Alaska Court System that all contractors of the Alaska Court System be 
bound by the provisions of these policies, to the extent that they provide services, programs and 
activities in place of direct provision by the court system. 

t is the policy of the Alaska Court System that the Alaska Court System shall not discriminate 
against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to 
job application procedures, the hiring; advancement; or discharge of employees; employee 
compensation; job training; and any other term, condition, and privilege of employment. 

hese procedures are promulgated pursuant to 28 CFR Part 35 Nondiscrimination On The Basis Of 

Disability In State And Local Government Services. 28 CFR §35.107 provides that a public  entity 
that employs 50 or more persons must adopt and publish grievance procedures providing for 
prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action that would be prohibited by the 
regulations adopted pursuant to Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).

Introduction 
This pamphlet describes the procedure for presenting a complaint to the court system based on Title 
II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. 

Who may file. If you believe that you or a specific class of individuals have been subjected 
to discrimination by the court system on the basis of a disability, you or an authorized 
representative may file a complaint. 

B.  Where to file. You may file a complaint with the area court administrator of the judicial 

district in which the discrimination is alleged to have occurred. If the discrimination is 
alleged to have occurred in more than one judicial district, you may file a complaint in any 
such district. The area court administrator will refer your complaint to the appropriate 
grievance officer. 

Time for filing. You may file your complaint at any time following the date of the alleged 
discrimination. The grievance officer may reject your complaint if he or she determines that 
the passage of time precludes an adequate investigation or remedy. You may appeal a 
rejection to the administrative director within 15 days of mailing of the notice of rejection. 

Contents of Complaint. Your complaint must include everything listed in the definition of 
the term “complete complaint” on page 3. 

cceptance of complaints 

Receipt of complaints. An area court administrator who receives a complaint shall 
promptly review the complaint to determine whether he or she has jurisdiction to serve as 
the grievance officer. If the area court administrator determines that he or she does not have 
jurisdiction, he or she shall promptly refer the complaint to the appropriate grievance officer, 
who may be another area court administrator, the clerk of the court of appeals, or the deputy 
director of the administrative office. Then area court administrator shall notify you of the 
referral. If the complaint alleges discrimination in more than one component of the court 
system, the affected grievance officers shall resolve the complaint jointly. 

Notification of Receipt. A grievance officer shall accept all complete complaints and shall 
promptly notify you of the receipt and acceptance of the complaint. If the grievance officer 
receives a complaint that is not complete, he or she shall notify you and specify the 
additional information that is needed to make the complaint a complete complaint. If you 
fail to complete the complaint, the grievance officer shall close the complaint. 

esolution complaints 

Informal Resolution. The grievance officer shall investigate each complete complaint and 
attempt to resolve the matter informally with you. If you and the grievance officer agree on a 
manner by which your complaint could be resolved, the grievance officer will forward a 
recommendation stating the proposed informal resolution of the complaint to the 
administrative director. The director will adopt or reject the recommendation within five 
days of the director’s receipt of the recommendation. The decision of the administrative 
directors on the recommendation is final. The director will notify you of the decision.

B. 

Formal Resolution. If an informal resolution is not achieved, the grievance officer shall 
issue a Letter of Findings to you and the administrative director. The letter shall include 
findings of fact and a description of a remedy for each violation found. 

If you disagree with the findings of fact or any proposed remedy, you may submit a written 
objection stating the basis for such disagreement to the administrative director within 15 
days of the date of mailing of the Letter of Findings. The administrative director may accept 
or reject the finding or any proposed remedy, and will notify you of the final decision, within 
20 days of the director’s receipt of the Letter of Findings. 

“Complete complaint” means a written statement that contains your name and address 
and describes the court system’s alleged discriminatory action in sufficient detail to inform 
the court system of the nature and date of the alleged violation. It shall be signed by you or 
by someone authorized to do so on your behalf. Complaints filed on behalf of classes or 
third parties shall describe or identify (by name, if possible) the alleged victims of 
discrimination.

substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; a record of 
such an impairment; or being regarded as having such an impairment.

skin, and endocrine; or 

any mental or psychological disorder such as mental retardation, organic brain 
syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities. 

The phrase “physical or mental impairment” includes, but is not limited to,

visual, speech and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, muscular 
dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, mental retardation, 
emotional illness, specific learning disabilities, HIV disease (whether  
symptomatic or asymptomatic), tuberculosis, drug addiction, and alcoholism.

activities provided by the court system.
