At no time have under your control a concealed weapon, a firearm, or a switchblade or gravity

NOTICE TO DEFENDANT

You are advised that according to the law, the court may at any time revoke your probation for cause or 
modify the terms or conditions of your probation.  You are subject to arrest by a probation officer with or 
without a warrant if the officer has cause to believe that you have violated a condition of your probation.
You are further advised that it is your responsibility to make your probation officer aware of your 
adherence to all conditions of probation set forth above.

Sentence Appeal.  If you are ordered to serve more than two years in jail for a felony offense, or more 
than 120 days for a misdemeanor offense, you may appeal the sentence to the court of appeals on the 
ground that it is excessive. 

NOTE: You may not appeal the sentence as excessive if it was imposed in accordance with a plea 
agreement that provided for a specific sentence or a sentence equal to or less than a specified maximum 
sentence.  If the sentence was imposed in accordance with a plea agreement that provided for a minimum 
sentence, you may appeal as excessive only the part of the sentence that is longer than the minimum 
sentence by more than two years for a felony offense, or by more than 120 days for a misdemeanor 
offense.
Your appeal must be filed within 30 days of the date of distribution stated below.  If you are sentenced to 
serve two years or less in jail for a felony offense, or 120 days or less in jail for a misdemeanor offense, 
you may seek review of your sentence by filing a petition for review in the Supreme Court.  To do this, 
you must file a notice of intent to file a petition for sentence review within 10 days of the date of 
distribution stated below.  See Appellate Rules 215 and 403(h) for more information on time limits, 
procedures, and possible consequences of seeking review of your sentence.

 

 

REGISTRATION REQUIREMENT.  Because you have been convicted of one of the offenses
listed in AS 12.63.100, you must register as described in the attached form (CR-471, Sex 
 
Offender and Child Kidnapper Registration Requirements).

, the above-named defendant, am charged with violation of: 

WAIVER OF INDICTMENT 

ACW 

CR 

 

 

. 

 am fully advised of the following: 

Under the Alaska Constitution, I have a right to have the above charge presented to a 
Grand Jury for review. 

A Grand Jury consists of 12 to 18 citizens who hear evidence presented by the District 
Attorney through witnesses. 

During  the  presentation  of  a  case  before  the  Grand  Jury,  only  the  District  Attorney,  a 
clerk, and the witness are present. 

The  Grand  Jury  can  return  an  indictment  against  me  only  upon  the  concurrence  of  a 
majority  of  the  total  number  of  jurors  and  when  all  the  evidence  taken  together,  if 
unexplained or uncontradicted, would warrant a conviction of me at trial. 

If  the  Grand  Jury  declines  to  indict  me  after  reviewing  the  evidence,  the  effect  is  to 
dismiss the charge which was before them; and that charge may not be again submitted 
to the Grand Jury without a court order. 

The  effect  of  an  indictment  being  returned  by  the  Grand  Jury  is  to  place  the  charges 
against me before the Superior Court. 

The effect of a Waiver of Indictment by me will be to allow the charges against me to be 
placed before the Superior Court without the Grand Jury having reviewed the evidence 
in my case.

FINDING 
 
After  having  personally  inquired  of  the  defendant  in  open  court  and  of  defendant’s  attorney, 
and  having  advised  the  defendant  as  to  defendant’s  right  to  indictment  by  Grand  Jury,  I  find 
that the defendant has made a voluntary, intelligent, and knowing waiver of defendant’s right
