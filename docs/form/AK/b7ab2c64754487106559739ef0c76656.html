      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS:  HOW TO ASK THE COURT  
TO APPOINT A TEMPORARY GUARDIAN IN AN EMERGENCY 

Introduction 

You can find more information about guardianship on the court’s self-help website: 
www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/guardian-conservator/index.htm or at the Office of Public Advocacy’s 
website: www.doa.alaska.gov/opa/pg/pub_guard.html.  

You can find all of the court forms referenced in these instructions at: 
www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm.    You  may  also  get  paper  copies  of  court  forms  from 
your local court clerk. 

Step-by-Step Instructions to File for Emergency Guardianship 

Step 1.  Before filing an Emergency Petition, you must first file a regular petition (you may 
use either PG-100 (Petition for Appointment of a Full Guardian for an Adult) or PG-103 
(Petition for Appointment of a Partial Guardian for an Adult) for this).  Instructions to 
fill  out  and  file  these  petitions  are  in  form  PG-505.    You  can  file  both  the  regular 
petition and the emergency petition at the same time. 

Step 2. 

c. 

Fill out Emergency Petition for Appointment of a Temporary Guardian (form PG-101).  
The paragraphs below explain certain sections of this form in more detail. 
Fill in the top of the form the same as you did the regular petition. 
a. 
Case Number.  If you are filing this emergency petition at the same time you 
b. 
file the regular petition, leave the “CASE NO.” line blank.  If you are filing this 
emergency petition later, write the case number that the court assigned to the 
regular petition. 
Section 3.  Explain where the respondent is currently located.  Describe what 
the place is (for example: “at his apartment” or “at her daughter’s house”), 
and then give the address and telephone number of that place. 
Section  4.     Describe  the  emergency  services  the  respondent  needs.    Be  as 
specific and complete as possible. 
To get a temporary (emergency) appointment, you must show that 
the respondent needs immediate services to protect against serious 
injury, illness, or disease.1   
Financial  emergencies  do  not  qualify  (for  example,  problems  paying  for  the 
medical  services  the  respondent  is  already  getting,  or  problems  paying  rent 
that may lead to eviction from a residence).  The emergency must be a need 
for medical services that the respondent is not already getting. 

d. 

 

 

e. 

Section 7.  You can nominate the same person or agency you nominated in 
the  regular  petition,  or  it  can  be  a  different  person  or  agency  just  for  the 
temporary guardianship.   

f. 

Sign and date in the area just before the “Verification.” 

                                                 
1  AS 13.26.301.  Also see AS 13.26.221(c), which says that a person petitioning for a regular guardianship 
may “include a request for temporary guardianship as provided in AS 13.26.301 if the petitioner believes 
there is an imminent danger that the physical health or safety of the respondent will be seriously impaired 
during the pendency of the guardianship proceeding” (emphasis added).

AS 13.26.301, .306, & .221(c) 

g. 

 

 

If you are filing in person, wait to sign the Verification section until you are at 
the court.  Bring a photo ID with you.  The court clerk can notarize your petition 
for free.  If you are mailing the emergency petition to the court, fill out the 
Verification section (in front of a notary public) before you mail it.   

h. 

Certificate of Service on page 3. 

If you are filing this emergency petition at the same time as the regular petition 
to open the case, then check the first box and sign at the bottom. 

If the guardianship case is already open, and before you file the emergency 
petition in court, you must make a reasonable effort to notify the respondent, 
the respondent’s attorney, the court visitor, and any other persons the court 
ordered you to notify, that you are going to file this petition.  Because it is an 
emergency, you may use extraordinary service methods, such as a phone call, 
instead of mail.  Check the second box on this page and explain the efforts you 
made to give notice, then sign at the bottom. 

Step 3.  Make  a  copy  of  the  emergency  petition  for  yourself  to  keep.    File  the  original 
emergency petition (either in person or by mail) at the same court where you filed the 
regular  petition.    There  is  no  separate  filing  fee  for  the  emergency  petition.    It  is 
covered by the filing fee you paid (or will pay) for the regular petition. 

Step 4.  Notice of Hearing.  

 

The court clerk will schedule a hearing on your petition to be held within 72 hours 
after you file it.  The clerk will send or give notice of the hearing to you, the court 
visitor, the respondent (through the court visitor), the respondent’s attorney, the 
proposed guardian, and any other interested persons as ordered by the court.   

Step 5.  Court Hearing.2 

The  respondent  has  the  right  to  be  present  at  the  hearing.  The  respondent  can 
participate in the hearing by telephone if that is more convenient for the respondent. 
Usually these hearings are closed to the public, but the respondent  has the right to 
choose to have the hearing open to the public.  

At the hearing, the respondent has the right to present evidence and to ask questions 
of any witnesses. The respondent can remain silent (and not answer any questions) if 
the respondent wishes to.   

As  the  petitioner,  you  must  present  clear  and  convincing  evidence3  that 
proves BOTH (1) and (2) below:  
(1) 

The  respondent  needs  immediate  services  to  protect  against  serious  injury, 
illness, or disease,  
AND 
The respondent is not able to get these services on the respondent’s own. 

 
(2) 

 

 

The statute that requires this, AS 13.26.301, is printed on the next page.

Step 6.  When the Appointment Ends. 

If the judge signs an emergency appointment order, the order will be temporary.  It 
will expire when the court appoints a regular (full or partial) guardian, or if the court 
dismisses the regular petition for guardian appointment. 

AS 13.26.301 
Temporary guardians; authorization of services. 

(a)  If  during  the  pendency  of  an  initial  petition  for  guardianship  it  appears  that  the 
respondent is in need of immediate services to protect the respondent against serious 
injury, illness, or disease and the respondent is not capable of procuring the necessary 
services,  the  petitioner  may  request  the  appointment  of  a  temporary  guardian  to 
authorize  the  services.  The  request  shall  state  the  reasons  and  factual  basis  for  the 
request. The petitioner shall immediately file the request with the court and serve copies 
on  the  respondent  and  the  respondent's  attorney.  The  court  shall  conduct  a  hearing 
within 72 hours after the filing. 

(b)  At the temporary guardianship hearing, the respondent shall have the rights set 
out in AS 13.26.251(a). 

(c)   The burden of proof at the hearing shall be by clear and convincing evidence and 
shall be upon the petitioner. 

(d)  If  the  court  determines  that  a  temporary  guardian  should  be  appointed,  it  shall 
make  the  appointment  and  grant  to  the  guardian  only  the  authority  that  is  least 
restrictive upon the liberty of the respondent and that enables the temporary guardian 
to  provide  the  emergency  services  necessary  to  protect  the  respondent  from  serious 
injury, illness, or disease. 

(e)  The temporary guardianship shall expire at the time of the appointment of a full or 
partial guardian or upon the dismissal of the petition for guardianship. 

(f)   If no guardianship petition is pending but the court is informed of a person who is 
apparently incapacitated and in need of emergency life-saving services, the court may 
authorize the services upon determining that delay until a guardianship hearing can be 
held would entail a life-threatening risk to the person. 

 
Alternatives to a Temporary Guardianship 

Two alternative procedures that can be used in case of certain medical emergencies are: 

Emergency Life-Saving Medical Authorization.  If no guardianship petition is pending, the 
court may authorize emergency life-saving services over the telephone, as described in 
Probate Rule 18 and AS 13.26.301(f). 

Designation or Assumption of Authority to Make Health Care Decisions by a Surrogate.  If 
no  guardian  and  no  agent  for  making  health  care  decisions  has  been  appointed  (or  is 
available),  and  if  the  primary  physician  of  an  adult  patient  determines  that  adult  lacks 
capacity, a “surrogate” can make health care decisions, as described in AS 13.52.030.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
