REQUEST TO START FORMAL PROBATE 
AND APPOINT A PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE WHEN THERE IS A WILL 
(Petition for Formal Probate of Will and Appointment of Personal Representative) 

Interest.  I,  
 
 
Decedent (Person Who Died).  The decedent died on  
age of  
in  
death and considered this location to be a permanent home. 

[date] at the  
 
.  At least five full days have passed since the death.  The decedent lived 
 [city and state] at the time of 
 

, have an interest in this estate, because: 
 

Need for Formal Probate. This estate needs to be formally probated, because 

  I do not have the original will. 
  there is a dispute about the will. 
  there  is  a  dispute  about  who  should  be  appointed  as  personal  representative,  or  I 
am otherwise unable to get consent from every person with greater or equal priority 
(see section 9 below).  Briefly describe the issue: 
 
 
  I want to change from informal probate to formal probate. 
   

 
 

 

 

Filing Location.  This is the correct court to file in, because the decedent 

  lived in this judicial district at the time of death.  
  did not live in Alaska at the time of death; however, the person had property located 
in this judicial district at the time of death. 

Time.  I am filing this probate case within the required time period, because   

  three years or less have passed since the person died, OR 
  more than three years have passed.  STOP.  Under Alaska law, you cannot open an 
estate case more than three years after the person died except in very limited 
circumstances.  You should talk to a lawyer about your options and whether you can 
open a probate case.  If you file this form, be aware that the court may dismiss the 
case unless you show a basis for filing this action under AS 13.16.040.  A waiver of 
the 3-year time limit under AS 13.16.040 is legally permitted, because:

6.  Will.  The decedent made a valid will on  

 [date].  To the best 

of my knowledge after a reasonable search, this is the last will, and I do not know of 
any document that cancels or revokes this will.  The original will (or an authenticated 
copy of the will probated somewhere else)  

 

  is attached. 
  is in the court’s possession.   
  is not attached, because I could not find it. 

Current Personal Representative.   

  No court has appointed a personal representative of the estate. 
  A court appointed a personal representative, but later ended the appointment. 
Attached is an authenticated copy of the will and a statement from the court where 
the will was first probated. 
  There is currently a personal representative of the estate.  A court appointed  
 
at  
Attached is an authenticated copy of the will and a statement from the court where 
the will was first probated. 

 [name] as personal representative, who lives 
 [address]. 
 

 

Right to be Appointed as Personal Representative.  The court should appoint me 
as personal representative.  I am 19 years or older and have priority to serve, because  

  the will named me as the personal representative.  
  I am the surviving spouse, and the will named me to receive property. 
  the will named me to receive property. 
  I am the surviving spouse, but the will did not name me to receive property. 
  I am an heir (someone with the right to inherit property from the decedent if no will 
had been made). 
  I am a creditor, and at least 45 days have passed since the person died. 
  Other:  

 

 
Persons with a Greater or Equal Right to Appointment.  [Priority is determined in 
the following order: (1) individual nominated in a will, (2) surviving spouse if named in 
w
to receive property, (3) others named in will to receive property, (4) surviving 
 
l
l
i
spouse, (5) someone with the right to inherit property from the decedent if no will was 
made, (6) 45 days after the death of the decedent, any creditor.]   
The following persons have a greater or equal right than I do to be appointed as the 
personal representative: 
 
 
 
 
[IMPORTANT: Every person who has a greater or equal priority over you must consent 
by completing the “Nomination for Appointment of Personal Representative with Lower 
Priority” (form P-306).  If you are using the formal probate process because not all of 
these people consent to your appointment, you should still file all of the completed 
nominations that you have.]

10.  Bond.  [A bond is a cash payment or pledge of property that guarantees the personal 
representative will fulfill the person’s duties.  However, the will commonly waives the 
bond requirement.] 

  No bond is required, because the will waived the bond requirement. 
  No bond is required, because all persons named in the will to receive property  

  waived the bond requirement.  [IMPORTANT: Each person named in the will must 
l
i
f
separate “Waiver of Bond Requirement” (form P-334) or must have requested 
 
a
 
e
a
waiver of the bond requirement in the “Nomination for Appointment of Personal 
 
Representative with Lower Priority” (form P-306).] 
  I request the court set a bond amount of $ 
covers the estimated value of the estate’s property and income for the next year.

12.  Demand for Notice.  [Any interested person may file a document called a “demand for 
notice” that tells the personal representative and the court to send a copy of every 
document filed with the court to the person who filed the notice.] 

  I have not received a demand for notice concerning the decedent and do not know 
of any demand for notice that may have been filed in Alaska or elsewhere. 
  I received or am aware of a demand for notice concerning the decedent from the 
following persons: 
 
 

 
 

 
 

13.  Notice.  I gave notice of this application to  

1)  the surviving spouse, children, and other heirs

3)  any current personal representative whose position has not been ended  
4)  all persons with a greater or equal right to appointment as personal representative 

of the estate

are unknown, by publishing in a newspaper as required by AS 13.06.110(a)(3)  

6)  unknown persons who may have an interest in the estate, by publishing in a 

newspaper as required by AS 13.06.110(a)(3)  
 

7)  all persons who filed a Demand for Notice 

herefore, I request an order admitting the decedent's will to probate; an order appointing me as 

personal representative of the decedent's estate; and that letters testamentary be issued.
