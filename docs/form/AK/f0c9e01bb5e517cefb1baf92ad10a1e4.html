      <pre>DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE INSTRUCTIONS 
FOR ONE SPOUSE FILING ALONE 
WHEN THE OTHER SPOUSE CANNOT BE LOCATED 

Court  staff  generally  can  inform  you  about  court  procedures,  court  rules,  court 
records, and forms.  Court staff must remain neutral and impartial.  They are not 
allowed to give legal advice. Court staff cannot: 

  advise you how statutes and rules apply to your case, 
• 
• 
• 

tell you whether the documents you prepare properly present your case, 
tell you what the best procedures are to accomplish a particular objective, or  
interpret laws for you.   

f you need help with your case, you should talk to a lawyer.

Dissolution of Marriage 
 

  decree  of  dissolution  of  marriage  has  the  same  force  and  effect  as  a  decree  of  divorce.  
However, the procedures for getting a dissolution are somewhat different than those for a divorce.  
Dissolution  procedures  are  described  in  Alaska  Statutes  25.24.200  -  .260  and  Civil  Rule  90.1.  
Divorce procedures are described in Alaska Statutes 25.24.010 - .180 and Civil Rule 90.1. 

f  one  spouse  alone  petitions  for  dissolution  when  the  other  spouse  cannot  be  located,  the 
dissolution decree will dissolve the marriage, but will not grant other relief such as child custody, 
child support and division of property.

DISSOLUTION INSTRUCTIONS – ONE SPOUSE 

Requirements 

he requirements for one spouse alone to use the dissolution procedure are: 

That spouse must be domiciled in Alaska.  That means the person must claim residency 
in  Alaska.    The  person  must  be  physically  present  in  Alaska  and  intend  to  remain 
indefinitely.  No minimum number of days of residency is required.  In addition, military 
personnel who do not claim to be Alaska residents may file for dissolution if they have 
been continuously stationed at a military base or installation in Alaska for at least 30 days.  
AS 25.24.900. 

That spouse must assert that "incompatibility of temperament, as evidenced by extended 
absence  or  otherwise,  has  caused  the  irremediable  breakdown  of  the  marriage."    This 
means there is no chance of saving the marriage because the married persons cannot get 
along. 

The whereabouts of the other spouse must be unknown to the petitioning spouse after 
reasonable efforts have been made to locate the absent spouse. 

The petitioning spouse must have been unable to find out the absent spouse's position on 
the following because the absent spouse cannot be located: 

a. 
b. 
c. 
d. 
e. 

the dissolution of their marriage, 
the fair and just division of their property, including retirement benefits, 
spousal maintenance, 
payment of debts, and 
custody, support and visitation of any minor children of the marriage. 

It must be shown that the absent spouse cannot be personally served with process inside 
or outside the state. 

f you cannot meet one or more of these requirements, contact a lawyer to find out what your 
options are.

DISSOLUTION INSTRUCTIONS – ONE SPOUSE 

Form  DR-200,  Petition  for  Dissolution  of  Marriage:  One  Spouse.    See  the 
instructions beginning on page 5.   

Form DR-210, Affidavit of Diligent Inquiry.  Check all of the boxes that apply, and 
describe  what  you  have  done  to  try  to  find  your  spouse.    You  must  sign  your 
affidavit  under  oath  before  a  notary  public,  a  court  clerk  or  any  other  person 
authorized to administer oaths. 

Form DR-314, Information Sheet. 

Form VS-401, Certificate of Divorce, Dissolution of Marriage or Annulment.   
Complete the “Parties’ Information” block, lines 11-30.  If you make a mistake, get 
a new form from the court.  This form will be sent to the Health Analytics and Vital 
Records office after the dissolution is granted, and they will not accept forms with 
cross-outs,  whiteouts,  or  other  corrections  on  them.  Health  Analytics  and  Vital 
Records also will not accept photocopies of the VS-401 form. 

File these forms at the clerk's office and pay the filing fee according to Administrative Rule 
9(b).  If you cannot afford this fee, ask the clerk for form TF-920, Request for Exemption 
from Payment of Fees. 

The court will review your Affidavit of Diligent Inquiry for sufficiency.  If the court believes 
you have not done enough to attempt to locate your spouse, the court will require further 
inquiries.   

If you believe that 

posting on the Alaska Court System’s legal notice website is not the best way to 
give notice to your spouse, and 

e-mail,  posting  on  social  networking  accounts,  or  some  other  method  of  notice 
would be more likely to give notice to your spouse, 

you  should  note  that  on  the  Affidavit  of  Diligent  Inquiry.  You  may  also  fill  out  form  
DR-215, Motion and Order for Alternative Service, to ask the court for permission to give 
notice by some way other than posting. 

After your affidavit is filed, the clerk will issue a Notice to Absent Spouse (form DR-220) 
and  will  post  the  Notice  on  the  Alaska  Court  System’s  legal  notice  website  for  four 
consecutive weeks.

DR-20 (3/23) 
DISSOLUTION INSTRUCTIONS – ONE SPOUSE 

After posting of the Notice to Absent Spouse, you must complete the Proof of Notice (form 
DR-225), have it notarized and file it with the court.  Be sure to fill in the case number 
which the court clerk assigned to your petition. 

When  you  file  your  Proof  of  Notice,  ask  the  clerk's  office  for  instructions  on  setting  a 
hearing date.  The hearing must be at least 30 days after the last date of notice to the 
absent spouse. 

Hearing. 

You must attend the hearing unless the court, for good cause, provides otherwise.  You 
may have a lawyer at the hearing, but you are not required to have one. 

At the hearing, the court will ask you questions to determine whether you fully understand 
the  nature  and  consequences  of  the  action;  whether  the  location  of  your  spouse  is 
unknown;  whether  an  incompatibility  of  temperament  has  caused  the  irremediable 
breakdown of your marriage and whether the other requirements on page 2 have been 
met. 

At some court locations, hearings are held before a Superior Court Master instead of a 
judge.  A master cannot grant a decree.  A master can only recommend to a judge whether 
or not a decree should be granted.   

The Decree. 

Although in some cases the decree may be granted at the hearing (if the hearing is before 
a judge rather than a master), usually the decree is not entered until a few days later.  
Do not assume a decree has been granted until you receive your copy. 

Once signed by the judge, the decree will dissolve your marriage. It will not, however, 
grant other relief such as child custody, child support, spousal maintenance or property 
division.

How To Fill Out The Petition 

hen you fill out the Petition form and any other forms you file with the court, please type or 
print  neatly  in  black  ink.    Do  not  leave  any  spaces  blank.    If  more  space  is  needed,  attach 
additional pages and sign them. 

t the top of the petition form, fill in the city where the superior court is located.  Then fill in your 

name and your spouse's name on the lines in the box.  Leave the "Case No." line blank.  

ead the first section of the petition and be sure you agree that all statements  in it  are true.  

Then fill in the information requested in paragraphs 1 through 7. 

aragraph 6.  Mailing Address. 

If your mailing address changes after you file the petition but before the decree is entered, 
you must send the court written notice of your new mailing address.  Be sure to include 
your case number in any letters to the court. 

aragraph 9.  Change or Restore Name. 

You may ask to restore (return to) a prior name, that is, a name that you had before the 
marriage.    You  may  alternatively  ask  that  a  new  name  be  authorized,  however,  there 
may be additional legal requirements and the court will have to approve this request.   

f  you  want  a  prior  name  restored  (to  go  back  to  a  name  you  had  before),  check  the 
appropriate box and fill in the blanks for your current and former names.  You may also 
want to follow steps #2, #9, #10, #11, and #12 below.   
  
You must also fill out Notice of Request to Restore Name in Dissolution or Divorce Case 
(form DR-957) if you are one or more of the following: 

•  currently charged with a crime,  
•  currently incarcerated (for example, in jail, in prison, or at a halfway house), 
•  on supervised felony probation or on parole for a criminal conviction, or  
• 

required to register as a sex offender or child kidnapper under AS 12.63.010.  

The court may order you to do additional notice of your name restoration if you fall into 
one  of  these  categories.    Read  the  court’s  order  carefully.    You  must  complete  any 
additional  notice  by  the  date  of  your  dissolution  hearing  or  your  dissolution  could  be 
delayed.  You can use Affidavit of Additional Service (form CIV-702) to provide proof to 
the court that you completed this requirement.  You may file this before the hearing or 
bring it to the hearing. 

f you are requesting a name that was not a name you had before the marriage, there 
may be additional costs and your dissolution hearing will be delayed.  Additionally, the 
judge may find that a new name change is not authorized in certain situations as part of 
a  dissolution  case.    For  these  reasons,  it  may  be  easier  to  do  the  name  change  in  a 
separate case by filing Petition for Change of Name (form CIV-700).  If you do decide to 
do it as part of your dissolution hearing, do the following: 

New Name

DR-20 (3/23) 
DISSOLUTION INSTRUCTIONS – ONE SPOUSE 

Check the box requesting a new name and fill out Request to Change to New Name 
in Dissolution Case (form DR-955).   

Ask the court for form VS-405, Application for Legal Name Change.  Fill out the 
form (please type the information if possible) and return it to the court, together 
with form DR-955, when you file your dissolution petition. 

Tell the clerk your petition includes a request for name change and that you need 
an order for posting. 

If the court finds that the name change is legally allowed as part of the dissolution 
case, the court will send you an Order for Hearing, Posting, and Additional Service 
(form CIV-701).  This order will tell you the time and place of the hearing on your 
name change.  It will also tell you whether you must provide additional service.  If 
the order requires additional service, follow the instructions on the order. 

Unless waived by written court order, the clerk will automatically post the proposed 
name change and the date of the hearing to the Alaska Court System’s Legal Notice 
Website for four consecutive weeks.  After posting is completed, the clerk will file 
the Clerk’s Certificate of Service of Posting (form TF-815) to the website.  

If you are also required to serve additional notice, you must file proof that you 
did so.  Use Affidavit of Additional Service (form CIV-702).  File it with the court 
before the hearing or bring it to the hearing. 

The hearing is usually short and fairly informal.  It will usually be combined with 
your dissolution hearing.  You must tell the judge why you want to change your 
name and assure the judge that you are not seeking to change your name in order 
to  avoid  debts  or  defraud  anyone.    If  the  judge  finds  there  is  no  reasonable 
objection to the change and that it is consistent with the public interest, the judge 
will sign a judgment allowing you to take the new name.  However, you cannot 
begin using the new name yet, because the judgment will not be effective until 
the following steps are completed. 

The court will automatically post notice on the Alaska Court System’s legal notice 
website for one week unless waived by the court in a written order.  Following the 
posting, the clerk will file the Clerk’s Certificate of Service of Posting (form TF-815) 
to the website. 

If  the  judgment  requires  additional  service,  follow  the  judgment’s  instructions.  
After additional service is complete, fill out an Affidavit of Additional Service (form 
CIV-702) and file it with the court.  The clerk will then issue a Certificate of Name 
Change (form CIV-705).  You can begin using your new name on the date stated 
in  the  certificate.    This  date  will  be  at  least  30  days  after  the  judgment  was 
distributed.  The clerk will give you two copies of the certificate.  One will be a free 
certified copy.  If you need additional certified copies, there will be a charge for 
them.  Current fees are listed in Administrative Rule 9. 

If you have an Alaska driver's license, or you own a vehicle registered in Alaska, 
you  must  send  written  notice  of  your  name  change  to  the  Division  of  Motor 
Vehicles within 30 days.  AS 28.05.071.  To get a new driver's license, you will 
need  to  go  to  a  DMV  office  and  present  a  copy  of  the  Certificate  of  Name 
Change (form CIV-705).
