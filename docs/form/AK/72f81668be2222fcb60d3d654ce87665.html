rand juries decide whether there is enough evidence to charge a person with a crime.  If 
the grand jury decides to charge a crime, then a trial jury will decide whether the person 
is guilty of the crime.  

 grand  jury hears evidence only from the prosecutor,  while  trial juries hear from  both 
the  prosecutor  and  the  defense.    Grand  jury  proceedings  are  secret,  while  most  trials  in 
which trial juries serve are public.  Grand juries have more members and typically serve 
longer terms than trial juries.    

erving on a grand jury allows you to take part in providing Alaska’s citizens with one of 
the most fundamental guarantees in the Alaska Constitution: the guarantee that a person 
will have to face serious criminal charges only if a panel of private citizens decides there 
is sufficient evidence to require that person to stand trial.  

ou do not need special experience, training, or education to serve on a grand jury, but 

you do need to be fair, impartial, and willing to keep an open mind. 

hank you for providing this extremely important service to your fellow citizens. 

INTRODUCTION 

   

Grand jury service is quite different from service on a trial jury.  

f  you  cannot  hear  the  proceedings,  raise  your  hand  to  get  the 
prosecutor’s  or  clerk’s  attention  and  explain  the  problem.    It  is  very 
important that you hear everything said in the grand jury room.

Sword and Shield 
 
The grand jury acts as both a “sword” and a “shield” of justice.  It acts as 
a sword when it investigates crimes and charges defendants with crimes.  
It  acts  as  a  shield  by  protecting  accused  persons  from  being  charged 
when there is not enough evidence of a crime. 

 

                                                                       

 

ow was I chosen for jury service? 

otential  jurors  are  selected  randomly  by  a  computer  from  the  list  of  all 
adults  (18  years  of  age  and  older)  who  apply  for  the  Alaska  Permanent 
Fund Dividend.  Ordinarily, prospective grand jurors are selected from the 
population  that  lives  within  50  miles  of  the  place  where  the  grand  jury 
meets. 
 

o I have to respond to the summons? 

es.  The summons to jury service is an official court summons.  If you do 
not  respond,  you  could  be  ordered  to  appear  before  a  judge,  held  in 
contempt  of  court,  ordered  to  pay  a  fine,  and  have  your  jury  service 
rescheduled. 
 

hat is the purpose of the Jury Questionnaire? 

he information you provide on the questionnaire helps the court determine 
whether you qualify to serve as a juror.  The Alaska Statutes require jurors 
to be  
(1) 
(2) 
(3) 
(4) 
(5) 

citizens of the United States; 
residents of Alaska;  
at least 18 years of age; 
of sound mind; 
in  possession  of  their  natural  faculties  (normal  abilities  to  reason); 
and 
able to read or speak the English language.

n addition, a person is disqualified from serving as a juror if the person has 
been convicted of a felony and has not been unconditionally discharged for 
that offense (meaning the person is still in jail, on electronic monitoring, or 
on parole or probation for the offense). 

he  questionnaire  also  gives  you  an  opportunity  to  request  that  your  jury 

duty be postponed as explained later in this booklet. 
 

f  I  have  difficulty  hearing  or  seeing  or  have  another  disability, will  I 
be disqualified from jury service? 

o.  A person is not disqualified from serving as a juror solely because of 
the  loss  of  hearing  or  sight  in  any  degree  or  a  disability  that  substantially 
impairs  or  interferes  with  the  person's  mobility.    The  court  is  required  to 
provide  an  interpreter  or  reader  when  necessary  to  enable  a  person  with 
impaired  hearing  or  sight  to  act  as  a  juror.    The  court  is  also  required  to 
make its facilities accessible  to  persons  with  disabilities.  If you need 
any  assistance  because  of  a  disability,  you  should  immediately  notify  the 
jury clerk. 

f  jury  service  would  be  a  significant  hardship  because  of  your  disability, 
you can ask to be temporarily or permanently  excused as explained in the 
paragraphs below. 
 

an I postpone my jury service? 

f jury service at the time for which you are summoned will cause hardship, 
you  may  request  deferral  of  service  to  another  time  within  the  next  ten 
months.    If  you  need  a  deferral,  ask  for  one  as  soon  as  possible.    Do  not 
wait  until  the  time  you  are  scheduled  to  appear.    To  reschedule  your  jury 
service, select a new term of service when asked if you wish to reschedule 
your  service  on  the  Jury  Questionnaire.    If  you  have  already  sent  in  your 
questionnaire, call the jury clerk as soon as possible for instructions.

an I be temporarily excused from jury service? 

he  Alaska  Statutes  and  court  rules  allow  the  following  persons  to  be 

temporarily excused from jury service: 
(1) 
(2) 

judicial officers; 
persons who can show that their health, the health or proper care of 
their family, a physical or mental disability, or other hardship makes 
it necessary for them to be excused; and 
teachers  in  a  school  that  is  designated  as  a  low  performing  school 
under regulations adopted by the state Board of Education and Early 
Development.    “Teacher”  means  a  person  who  serves  a  school 
district in a teaching capacity in a classroom setting and is required 
to  be  certificated  in  order  to  hold  the  position.    These  teachers  are 
only excused from jury service during the school term. 

o request a temporary excusal, you must write your request and reason on 
the Jury Questionnaire, in the Comments section.  If you have already sent 
in your questionnaire, call the jury clerk as soon as possible. 

f your request is granted, you will be excused from service for the current 
jury  year  (except  the  teachers  described  above,  who  are  only  excused 
during the school term).  However, you may be summoned for another term 
of service in the future.  To be permanently excused, see the next question. 
 

an I be permanently excused from jury service? 

he court rules provide that you may be permanently excused from all jury 

service if you: 

are 70 years of age or older and request in writing to be permanently 
excused; or 

have  a  permanent  medical  reason  you  are  unable  to  serve  and 
provide written verification as described below.

o request a permanent excusal if you are 70 years of age or older, answer 

“yes” to the permanent excuse question on the Jury Questionnaire. 

o request a permanent excusal if you have a permanent physical or mental 

disability, you must:  

answer “yes” to the question “I have a mental or physical reason that 
prevents me from serving”; 
explain  in  the  comments  section  of  the  questionnaire  that  you  are 
requesting a permanent excusal; and 
provide in writing, on business stationary or a prescription pad from 
a  medical  professional  (licensed  physician,  psychologist,  nurse 
practitioner,  physician's  assistant,  or  chiropractor),  that  you  are 
permanently unable to serve as a juror for medical reasons. 

f  you  are  permanently  excused,  you  should  not  receive  any  further  jury 
summonses. 
 

hat about my job? 

our  employer  cannot  fire,  demote,  or  otherwise  penalize  you  for 
missing  work  while  performing  jury  service.    Some  employers  will 
continue to pay your salary while you are in jury service even though they 
are  not  required  to  do  so.    Contact  your  employer  to  find  out  what  the 
policy is at your job. 
 

hat if my employer wants proof of my jury service? 

sk the jury clerk for a Certificate of Jury Attendance either at the end of 
each  day  of  service  or  at  the  completion  of  your  service.    The  certificate 
will indicate the dates and times you served.

in which you served.  If you serve during two pay periods, you will receive 
two checks.  If you have not received  your check within 15 days after the 
end of your pay period, please contact the jury clerk. 
 

f my check is lost, can it be reissued? 

f  the  check  is  less  than  six  months  old,  contact  the  Administrative  Jury 
Office in Anchorage at (907) 264-8268.  The clerk will be able to re-issue 
the check for you.

and if you find it, you will not be able to cash it.  After six months, the funds 
are automatically transferred to the State’s Unclaimed Property Division.  To 
request  payment,  call  (907)  465-3726  or  e-mail  ucproperty@alaska.gov.

oes the court pay for meals for grand jurors? 

xception: Some courts must fly in some of their grand jurors from out of 
town.    Under  some  circumstances,  those  out-of-town  grand  jurors  are 
reimbursed for meals.  You may bring snacks and non-alcoholic drinks. 
 

oes the court provide parking? 

ree parking is available at most courts.  If parking is an issue, there will be 
instructions  about  it  on  your  jury  service  reminder  notice  and  on  the  Jury

ote:  Once  your  term  of  service  ends,  you  cannot  be  required  to  serve 
again for at least one year after your last day of actual court attendance (or 
two years after that date in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Palmer). 
 

hat if an emergency keeps me from coming to court?

hat hours will I serve? 

he  times  of  day  that  the  grand  jury  meets  are  different  at  each  court 
location.    You  can  ask  the  jury  clerk  what  hours  the  grand  jury  at  your 
location typically meets.  

ou  should  report  to  the  court  at  the  date  and  time  shown  on  your  jury 
summons or as instructed when you call in.  At that time, you will be told 
the procedure for reporting to the court for the rest of your term.   
 

an  I  bring things to  do  in case  I  have  to  wait  for  the  proceedings to 

es.  You may have to wait a while before the grand jury selection process 
begins.    Bring  a  book  or  other  quiet  activity,  solve  a  crossword  puzzle, 
write  a  letter,  sketch  a  picture,  or  get  to  know  your  fellow  jurors.    Of 
course, once the proceedings begin,  you should not talk,  read, or do other 
activities.  You need to devote  your full attention to what is happening in 
the grand jury room.   
 

 

 

 

an I bring my cell phone or other electronic device (laptop computer, 

tablet, etc.) to court when I serve on a grand jury? 

Yes.  However, you must turn off all such devices whenever the grand jury 
is  in  session.    You  must  not  send  or  receive  messages  about  the  cases 
 You  must  not  do  any  independent  research.    You  must  not 
before you. 
look up information about the case or the people involved in the case on the 
internet.  You must avoid news reports that might mention criminal activity 
that may be presented to the grand jury. 

Remember, jurors must decide the case before them based solely on the 
evidence presented in the grand jury room. 

At  some  courts,  you  will  not  be  allowed  to  take  these  types  of  electronic 
devices  into  the  grand  jury  room.    Court  personnel  will  collect  them  and 
hold them for you when each grand jury session begins.

or  security  reasons,  weapons  of  any  kind  are  not  permitted  in 
courthouses.   Some  examples  of  things  you  should  not  bring  to  court  are: 
firearms or anything resembling a firearm; knives of any size or other sharp 
objects;  chemical  agents  such  as  mace,  bear  spray,  and  other  forms  of

Grand Jurors play an essential role in the criminal justice process.  Although many 
people do not know what to expect from jury service, most look back upon it as a 
rewarding experience.  Jury service is a tangible, challenging, and indispensable 
contribution to our country.

PART II 
FIRST APPEARANCE: 
SELECTING GRAND 
JURORS & ALTERNATES 

 

hat happens on the first day? 

he first day you appear at the court for grand jury selection, the following 

usually happens: 

The jury clerk takes attendance or asks you to sign in. 
The clerk administers the “qualifying” oath – this is when you swear 
or  affirm  that  you  will  truthfully  answer  questions  about  your 
qualifications to serve as a juror. 
The  judge  or  the  clerk  asks  all  jurors  (as  a  group)  the  qualifying 
questions (whether you are a citizen of the United States, resident of 
Alaska, at least age 18, of sound mind, in possession of your natural 
faculties, able to read or speak English, on parole or probation for a 
felony). 
The  judge  asks  if  anyone  needs  to  be  excused  from  service  on  this 
grand jury (for health reasons, hardship, or other reasons).  Anyone 
who asks for an excusal will need to explain to the judge the reason 
for  the  request.    The  judge  will  decide  whether  to  grant  these 
requests. 
Eighteen (18) or more persons will be randomly picked to serve on 
each  grand  jury  panel.    Some  or  all  of  the  remaining  jurors  in  the 
courtroom will be designated as alternate jurors. 
The  clerk  or  judge  administers  the  grand  juror  oath  to  the  grand 
jurors  and  all  alternates.    In  this  oath,  the  jurors  will  swear  (or 
affirm) that they will  
● 

diligently  inquire  into  the  cases  presented  to  them  and  any 
other matters they choose to investigate;  
keep all grand jury proceedings secret; and

fear, affection, gain, reward or hope thereof.

The judge reads instructions to the grand jurors and alternates. 
The  judge  appoints  one  juror  to  be  the  “foreperson”  and  one  to  be 
the  “deputy  foreperson.”    Depending  on  the  court  location,  there 
may  be  other  roles,  or  more  than  one  person  in  each  role.    Note: 
These appointments may be done later. 
The  District  Attorney  (the  prosecutor  who  represents  the  State  of 
Alaska)  or  an  Assistant  District  Attorney  explains  how  the  grand 
jury  will  work.    Note:  In  some  courts,  the  District  Attorney’s 
explanation will be done later.  

an a grand jury have less than 18 members? 

es.  Alaska’s Constitution requires that there be at least 12 citizens on the 
grand  jury.    The  Alaska  Statutes  and  the  Alaska  Rules  of  Court  state  that 
there must be a minimum of 12 and not more than 18 persons on the grand 
jury. 
 

hat  if  I  need  to  be  excused  for  just  one  or  two  days  of  my  term  of 

service? 

he court will usually allow you to be absent for a few days, but you must 

contact the jury clerk about this as far in advance as possible. 

he court rules allow a juror to be temporarily excused because of illness or 

a personal or business matter that requires the juror's attention. 
 

hy are alternate jurors needed? 

lternate jurors are needed if a regular grand juror has an emergency or is 
excused for a particular day.  An alternate juror may also be needed for just 
one case if a regular juror is disqualified from that case. 

ote:  An  alternate  juror  must  be  present  during  the  presentation  of  all 

evidence related to a particular case in order to vote on that case.

others.    If  you  are  asked  to  discuss  grand  jury  matters  by  persons  outside 
the grand jury room, you may simply say that the law does not allow you to 
do so. 
 

hy must I keep grand jury proceedings secret? 

he following are some reasons for grand jury secrecy:1 

To prevent the escape of a person who might be charged by the 
grand jury. 

To ensure that grand jurors can deliberate without fear that what they 
say will be repeated outside the jury room, and to prevent persons 
who might be charged by the grand jury or their friends from trying 
to influence or harass the grand jurors. 

To prevent people from tampering with witnesses expected to testify 
before the grand jury and who may later testify at trial. 

To encourage persons who have information about crimes to give 
that information to the grand jury. 

To protect a person who is not charged by the grand jury from 
disclosure to the public that the person was investigated for a crime.

hat are the foreperson’s and deputy foreperson’s duties? 

he duties of the grand jury foreperson are to: 

administer  oaths  to  witnesses  before  the  witnesses  testify  (or 
affirmations to witnesses who prefer not to swear an oath); 
decide  when  the  grand  jury  should  take  breaks  during  the 
presentation of evidence and during deliberations; 
preside  over  the  deliberations,  seeing  that  everyone  has  an 
opportunity to participate and that the discussions remain orderly; 
keep  a  record  of  the  number  of  jurors  concurring  in  the  finding  of 
every indictment and the issuance of every report, and file the record 
of the votes with the court clerk; 
sign all indictments and grand jury reports; and 
present the indictments to the presiding judge in open court. 

he deputy foreperson will perform these duties if the foreperson is absent. 

hat is the purpose of the Grand Jury? 

he Alaska Statutes2 describe the grand jury’s two duties: 

1)   The first is to “inquire into all crimes committed or triable within the 

jurisdiction of the court and present them to the court.” 

2) 

Second,  the  grand  jury  has  “the  power  to  investigate  and  make 
recommendations concerning the public welfare or safety.” 

he  first  of  these  duties  is  discussed  in  Section  III,  beginning  on  the  next 

page.  The second is described in Section IV. 
 

 

“Protection of the innocent against oppression and unjust prosecution” ranks 
among the grand jury’s vital functions.

hat is an “indictment”? 

n  indictment  (pronounced  “in-DITE-ment”)  is  the  document  the  grand 
jury uses to charge a defendant with a felony crime.  It is prepared for the 
grand jury by the District Attorney.  It is signed by the foreperson on behalf 
of the grand jury. 
 

hat is a “true bill”? 

f  the  grand  jury  votes  in  favor  of  charging  the  defendant  with  the  crime 
described  in  the  indictment,  “true  bill”  is  written  on  the  first  page  of  the 
proposed indictment. 

f  the  grand  jury  votes  against  charging  the  defendant  with  the  crime 
described in the indictment, “not a true bill” is written on the first page of 
the proposed indictment. 
 

ow many jurors have to vote in favor of the charges in order for the 

grand jury to return a “true bill”? 

 “true bill” can be returned only if a majority of the total number of jurors 
comprising the grand jury when the grand jury was sworn and charged with 
instructions votes in favor.

Usually, the original number of jurors when the grand jury is sworn is 18.  
If that is true, then the number that will need to vote in favor of the charges 
is 10. 

ote: It is not the number of jurors present at the time the case is heard that 
matters.  It is the number that was on the original grand jury when the grand 
jury  was  sworn  and  given  its  instructions  by  the  presiding  judge.    For 
example, if there were 18 jurors when the grand jury was originally sworn, 
but  only  16  members  present  to  hear  the  current  case,  it  is  still  10  jurors 
who must agree in order to return a “true bill” on the indictment. 
 

hat kinds of cases does a grand jury hear? 

here are two basic kinds of criminal offenses: felonies and misdemeanors.  A 
felony is a crime where the defendant has the possibility of getting a sentence 
of more than one year in jail.  A misdemeanor is a crime where the maximum 
sentence is one year or less of jail time. 

he  grand  jury  will  inquire  into  “all  crimes”  committed  within  the  court’s 
jurisdiction.  However, in practice, the only crimes the prosecutor will usually 
bring  to  the  grand  jury  are  felonies.    This  is  because  misdemeanors  do  not 
require a  grand jury  indictment.    The  prosecutor  can  choose  to  charge  these 
lesser  crimes  by  filing  a  document  called  an  “information”  with  the  court.  
Sometimes though, the prosecutor may choose to present misdemeanors along 
with felonies to the grand jury, usually if they are related or involve the same 
defendant. 
 

ow are cases presented to the grand jury? 

he  prosecutor  presents  cases  to  the  grand  jury.    The  prosecutor  will 
identify  who  the  State  wants  to  charge  with  a  crime,  describe  what  the 
person allegedly did that is a crime, and explain the statutes the prosecutor 
believes that the person violated.  The prosecutor will then present evidence 
to  try  to  persuade  the  grand  jurors  that  the  accused  person  has  committed 
the  crime.    The  evidence  can  be  testimony  from  witnesses  under  oath, 
documents  (paper  or  electronic),  audio  or  video  recordings,  photographs, 
the results of scientific tests, etc.

Sometimes, the case will involve only one defendant and one crime.  Other 
times, there may be multiple defendants and/or multiple crimes.  If there are 
multiple  crimes  in  one  case,  each  crime  will  be  referred  to  by  a  different 
number, called a “count.” 

he  prosecutor  will  prepare  a  proposed  indictment  and  act  as  the  grand 
jury's legal advisor, explaining the applicable law and answering the grand 
jurors’ questions about the law and procedure.3 

ll  proceedings  before  the  grand  jury—including  the  testimony  of 
witnesses,  any  statements  made  by  the  prosecuting  attorney,  and  any 
statements by or questions of the jurors—must be electronically recorded. 

t is very important for grand jurors to understand that they are not on the 
side  of  the  prosecution.    Because  the  prosecutor  acts  as  your  advisor,  you 
may  develop a close relationship.  However,  you  must not  merely  rubber-
stamp  the  prosecutor’s  recommendations.  You  must  use  your  own 
independent judgment to decide whether to vote in favor of the indictment. 
 

 

hat does the grand jury decide? 

he grand jurors must decide whether all of the evidence taken together, if 
unexplained or uncontradicted, would justify a conviction of the defendant. 

ince  the  grand  jurors  only  hear  the  prosecutor’s  side  of  the  case  and  not 
the  defendant’s,  the  grand  jury  is  not  making  the  final  decision  about 
whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty.  This question is for the trial 
jury  to  decide.    The  grand  jury  is  just  deciding  whether  the  evidence  the 
prosecutor  has  presented  is  enough  to  support  a  conviction  at  trial  if  the 
defense cannot explain or contradict that evidence. 

he  grand  jury  proceeding  is  not  intended  to  be  a  mini  trial,  so  the 
prosecutor does not need to present all of the evidence necessary to  prove 
guilt  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.    The  prosecutor  merely  has  to  introduce 
enough evidence to show a probability of guilt.4

The grand jury’s power is only to accuse, not to convict.  It will be up to the 
trial jury, who will hear evidence from both sides, to decide whether the 
defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 

ote: Each crime has a number of “elements.”  They are listed in the statute 
that defines the crime.  These elements are like ingredients in a recipe, and 
all must be present for the crime to be charged.  They generally include one 
or more specific acts (or a failure to act) combined with a particular state of 
mind  at  the  time  the  act  or  failure  to  act  occurred.    The  prosecutor  will 
identify and explain each element to the grand jury, and the jury must find 
proof of each element before it can find that a crime was committed. 
 

f  a  grand  juror  knows  some  information  about  the  defendant  or  the 
case, can that juror tell the other jurors about it? 

ot  unless  the  juror  takes  the  witness  stand  and  testifies  about  the 
information.  The court rules state: “An indictment shall not be found nor a 
presentment  made  upon  the  statement  of  a  grand  juror  unless  such  grand 
juror is sworn and examined as a witness.”5 

f  you  know  something  about  a  case,  you  need  to  tell  the  prosecutor  so  it 
can be determined if you should be disqualified (usually only for that case).  
You  must  not  tell  the  other  jurors  about  any  information  you  have  from 
outside the courthouse about the case. 
 

an  a  grand  juror  ask  the  grand  jury  to  investigate  a  crime  that  the 

prosecutor has not presented to them? 

es. The Alaska Statutes state: “If an individual grand juror knows or has 
reason  to  believe  that  a  crime  has  been  committed  that  is  triable  by  the 
court,  the  juror  shall  disclose  it  to  the  other  jurors,  who  shall  investigate 
it.”6

16 

 

After  investigation,  the  grand  jury  may  not  be  sure  whether  the  facts 
constitute a crime or whether the defendant can still be prosecuted for it (for 
example, because so  much time has passed, or because the  defendant was 
previously  on  trial  for  the  offense).    If  at  least  five  members  of  the  grand 
jury agree, the grand jury can ask the court for instructions on the law.  To 
do  this,  the  grand  jury  must  describe  the  facts  in  writing  (without 
mentioning  the  name  of  any  person)  and  give  that  document  to  the  court.  
This document is called a “presentment.”  If the grand jury requests it, the 
prosecuting attorney must assist in the investigation and preparation of the 
presentment.  The court will give whatever instructions on the law the court 
considers necessary.  The court will not keep the presentment.  If the facts 
constitute a crime and the defendant can be prosecuted for it, the grand jury 
can require the prosecutor to prepare an indictment and the grand jury can 
vote on whether it is a “true bill.” 
 

f  a  grand  juror  is  concerned  about  being  fair  and  impartial  in 
deciding a particular case, what should that grand juror do? 

 grand juror who, after hearing about a particular case, is concerned about 
being  fair  or  impartial  should  tell  the  prosecutor.    The  prosecutor  can 
excuse  the  juror  from  that  case  and  ask  the  presiding  judge  to  impanel  an 
alternate juror. 

ote: Grand jurors will be told the name of the accused and the names of 
the witnesses who will testify, as well as the nature of the case, before the 
prosecutor  presents  each  case.    The  prosecutor  may  then  ask  whether  you 
know  or  are  related  to  the  defendant  or  witnesses,  have  any  financial  or 
other  interest  in  the  outcome  of  the  case,  have  formed  or  expressed  a 
previous opinion about the case, or have any personal bias or prejudice that 
might affect how you will decide the case.

an the prosecutor ask the judge to excuse a seated grand juror? 

es.  If the prosecutor becomes aware of a grand juror’s potential prejudice 
or  bias  that  could  affect  the  grand  jury’s  impartial  deliberations,  the 
prosecutor must present that information to the presiding judge.  The judge 
will  then  notify  the  juror  about  this  and  question  the  juror  concerning  the 
potential  bias.    After  hearing  from  the  juror,  the  judge  may  request 
additional  information  from  the  prosecutor,  other  jurors,  or  other  sources.  
If the judge believes there is potential bias, the judge may excuse the juror 
permanently,  or  just  for  a  particular  case.    If  the  judge  does  not  believe 
there is potential bias, the judge will allow the juror to remain. 

he  prosecutor  can  also  challenge  a  seated  grand  juror  “for  cause.”    For 
example,  a  grand  juror  who  personally  knows  the  defendant  or  the 
investigating officer or the victim would most likely be excused “for cause” 
from hearing that case. 
 

an grand jurors take notes? 

es.  However,  you are not allowed to remove  your notes from the grand 
jury room.  Any notes you take will be destroyed when they are no longer 
needed. 
 

hat if I cannot hear the proceedings? 

Raise  your  hand  to  get  the  prosecutor's  attention  and  then  explain  the 
problem.    It  is  very  important  that  you  hear  everything  said  in  the  grand 
jury room.

• 
•  a deputy court clerk to record what is said 

The  following  people  will  not  be  present:  the  judge,  the  defendant,  the

an orderly fashion.  If you have any doubt about whether it is appropriate to 
ask a particular question, ask the prosecutor for advice.

answer would tend to incriminate them.

person to bring documents to court.  The prosecutor can get a subpoena at 
the grand jury’s request.

it may do so if it wants to. 

ote:  When  the  grand  jury  has  reason  to  believe  that  other  available 
evidence  will  explain  away  the  charge,  it  must  order  that  evidence  to  be 
produced.  For that purpose, the grand jury should require the prosecutor to 
subpoena witnesses or bring in other documents or evidence.

Note:  The  defendant  in  a  criminal  case  is  never  required  to  testify.    The 
defendant has a constitutional right not to testify under both the Alaska and

defendant in any way if the grand jury asks the defendant to testify and the 
defendant declines.

defendant's  desire  to  testify—and  reminds  the  grand  jury  of  its  ability  to 
call  the  defendant  as  a  witness—the  grand  jury  decides  whether  or  not  to 
allow this testimony.

oes  the  prosecutor  have  to  present  evidence  favorable  to  the 

defendant? 

he  prosecutor  has  a  duty  to  present  “exculpatory  evidence”  to  the  grand 
jury.  Exculpatory evidence is evidence that shows or tends to show that the 
defendant is not guilty.  It is the opposite of “inculpatory evidence,” which 
tends to prove guilt. 

he  prosecutor  must  present  exculpatory  evidence  so  that  the  grand  jury 
can  properly  perform  its  function  of  protecting  the  innocent  from  unjust 
prosecution.    But  the  prosecutor's  obligation  to  present  exculpatory 
evidence  does  not  turn  the  prosecutor  into  a  defense  attorney.    The 
prosecutor  does  not  have  to  develop  or  argue  evidence  on  behalf  of  the 
defendant or investigate every lead possibly favorable to the defendant.9 

he  prosecutor  only  has  to  present  evidence  known  to  the  prosecutor 

which, in and of itself, tends to show the defendant is not guilty.10 
 

ho can be in the room when the grand jury deliberates? 

Deliberations”  are  when  the  grand  jurors  discuss  the  case  among 
themselves and decide whether to vote in favor of the indictment.  After the 
prosecutor finishes presenting the evidence in the case,  everyone else will 
leave the grand jury room, so that the grand jury can deliberate. 

o  one  except  the  grand  jurors  (and  any  interpreter  necessary  to  assist  a 
juror  who  is  hearing-  or  speech-impaired)  can  be  present  while  the  grand 
jury is deliberating or voting.  Neither the prosecutor nor the court clerk can 
be  present.    The  deliberations  are  not  audio-recorded.    If  you  take  notes 
during  deliberations,  those  notes  may  not  leave  the  grand  jury  room  and 
will be destroyed after deliberations are over.

ow should we conduct our deliberations? 

ach grand juror may have a different opinion at the start of deliberations.  
You should keep an open mind.  Listen carefully to other jurors’ opinions 
and the reasons for their opinions.  You should be prepared to tell the other 
jurors what you think and why you think it.  Be fair and carefully consider 
what your fellow jurors are saying.  Do not let yourself be intimidated into 
changing  your  opinion,  and  do  not  intimidate  anyone  else.    Change  your 
opinion only if you genuinely agree with what another juror is saying. 
 

hat  if  we  decide  we  need  more  evidence  after  we  have  begun 

deliberations? 

f  you  want  to  hear  more  testimony  or  see  more  documents  or  other 
evidence,  ask  your  foreperson  to  direct  the  prosecutor  to  subpoena  the 
additional witnesses or documents. 
 

ow does the grand jury send its decision to the judge? 

f the grand jury votes in favor of the indictment, the foreperson will write 
the words “true bill” on the indictment (if those words are not already pre-
printed  on  the  indictment)  and  sign  it.    At  the  end  of  the  day,  the 
foreperson  and  the  prosecutor  will  present  the  indictments  to  a  judge  in 
open court.  If the indictment needs to be kept secret for any reason, this 
hearing will not be public. 

f  the  grand  jury  votes  against  the  indictment,  the  foreperson  will  write 
the words “not a true bill” on the indictment and sign it.

about  any  case-specific  information  while  any  other  grand  juror  is  still

PART IV 
GRAND JURY 
INVESTIGATIONS 
AND REPORTS 

“The  power  of  grand  juries  to  investigate  and  make  recommendations 
concerning the public welfare or safety shall never be suspended.” 
 

Alaska Constitution, Article 1, Section 8 

hat can the grand jury investigate? 

rand  juries  have  “the  power  to  investigate  and  make  recommendations 
concerning  the  public  welfare  or  safety.”    The  public  welfare  or  safety  is 
quite  a  broad  category  of  topics.    Some  examples  of  matters  grand  juries 
have previously investigated are:11 

At  the  request  of  Alaska's  Attorney  General,  an  Anchorage  grand 
jury  investigated  the  conduct  of  the  Anchorage  School  District,  the 
Anchorage  Police  Department,  and 
the  Anchorage  District 
Attorney's  Office  relating  to  their  investigation  of  a  high  school 
teacher's sexual relationships  with students.   The grand jury’s 1990 
report  identified  deficiencies  in  certain  statutes  and  policies 
regarding the reporting and investigation of sexual misconduct with 
  The  report  contained  recommendations  for 
school  children. 
statutory and policy changes. 

In  1985,  a  Juneau  grand  jury  investigated  the  circumstances 
surrounding the state’s lease of 32,000 square feet of office space in 
Fairbanks.  Its report alleged that the governor had helped steer the 
state’s lease to a political supporter and  questioned the “candor”  of 
his  testimony  before  the  grand  jury.    Instead  of  indicting  the 
governor,  the  grand  jury’s  report  recommended  that  the  Senate  be 
called into special session to consider impeachment proceedings.

11 Alaska Judicial Council Report on The Investigative Grand Jury in Alaska, February 

1986, at pages 33-35. 

 

25 

At  various  times,  grand  juries  have  investigated  patterns  of  crime.  
For  example,  a  Fairbanks  grand  jury  investigated  the  problem  of 
drugs  in  Fairbanks  high  schools  after  several  instances  of  drug-
related juvenile crime.  And in 1973, a grand jury, after recognizing 
the  number  of  crimes  being  committed  on  campus,  investigated 
security at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks.  In 1986, a Bethel 
grand  jury  issued  a  report  following  an  investigation  into  sexual 
abuse  in  that  community,  having  noted  the  large  number  of  sexual 
abuse cases being brought before them. 

Alleged  misconduct  in  state  and  local  government.    In  1953,  a 
Ketchikan  grand  jury  conducted  an  investigation  into  alleged 
corruption in the Ketchikan police department.  A Kenai grand jury 
in  1973-1974  considered  allegations  of  improper  conduct  by 
municipal  officials,  including  allegedly  inappropriate  conduct  of  a 
judge.  A 1974 Fairbanks grand jury investigated alleged conflicts of 
interest  by  public  officials  in  appropriating  funds  for  the  Fairbanks 
flood  control  project.    In  1981  and  1982,  separate  grand  juries  in 
Juneau investigated allegations of misconduct by two state senators.  
In  1984,  an  Anchorage  grand  jury  investigated  potential  criminal 
practices related to property and inventory maintained by the Alaska 
Division of Fish and Wildlife Protection’s Aircraft Section.   

Potential  criminal  activity  affecting  public  welfare  or  safety.  
Anchorage  grand  juries  have  investigated  such  matters  as  waste  of 
game animals (1964), alleged irregularities in a local election (1965), 
the  use  of  listening  devices  (1966),  drug  abuse  by  minors  (1967), 
and public exhibition of adult motion pictures (1969). 

Criminal  justice  system.    Grand  juries  have  investigated  the 
effectiveness  of  police  operations  in  Bethel  in  1977  and  1983;  and 
the  operation  of  the  jail  in  Utqiaġvik  (formerly  Barrow)  in  1983, 
following  an  escape.    In  Fairbanks  and  in  Anchorage,  grand  juries 
routinely  investigated  the  condition  of  the  jails  and  related 
institutions virtually every year until the early 1970s. 

Non-criminal investigations of conditions affecting public welfare or 
safety.    In  1962  and  1964,  Anchorage  grand  juries  investigated 
traffic safety and road signs; in 1964, city zoning; and in 1965, water 
and sewer service.

“The grand jury is entitled to access, at all reasonable times, to the public jails and 
prisons, to offices pertaining to the courts of justice in the state, and to all other 
public offices, and to the examination of all public records in the state.”

ho decides that the grand jury should investigate something? 

enerally,  grand  jury  investigations  are  initiated  by  the  District  Attorney.  
They  can  also  be  initiated  by  the  presiding  judge  or  by  members  of  the 
grand  jury.    Prosecutors  also  sometimes  receive  letters  from  the  public, 
addressed to the grand jury,  requesting investigations.   In these situations, 
the prosecutor will probably conduct a preliminary investigation and make 
a recommendation to the grand jury about whether to take action.  It will be 
up to the grand jury to decide whether to investigate the matter requested in 
the letter. 
 

hat happens at the end of the investigation? 

he grand jury can write a report in which it makes recommendations about 
the  matter  it  investigated.    The  grand  jury  then  submits  the  report  to  the 
presiding judge of the judicial district. 

he  report’s  recommendations  must  be  based  upon  the  results  of  the 

investigation.  They must not be based on speculation.12 
 

ow  many  grand  jurors  must  agree  about  the  contents  of  a  report 

before the grand jury can present the report to the court? 

  report  may  be  made  only  if  there  is  agreement  by  a  majority  of  the 
grand  jurors  who  were  on  the  grand  jury  at  the  beginning  of  the 
proceedings that result in the report. 

The purpose of grand jury reports is to inform the public of situations 
requiring administrative, judicial, or legislative corrective action – not the 
castigation of individuals.

an a grand jury report include allegations of criminal conduct? 

hat happens after the report is presented to the court? 13 

he presiding judge must review the report and the grand jury’s evidence 
before the report can be made public.  The judge must first confirm that 
the  report  concerns  the  public  safety  or  welfare,  that  a  majority  of  the 
grand jurors voted in favor of it, and that it was signed by the foreperson.  

he  judge  must  then  determine  if  publication  of  the  report  would 
“improperly infringe upon a constitutional right of any person,” including 
improperly interfering with the person’s right to privacy or right to a fair 
trial in a pending or planned criminal proceeding. 

ext,  the  judge  must  determine  whether  any  part  of  the  report  “may 
reflect  adversely  on  any  person  who  is  named  or  otherwise  identified  in 
the  report.”    If  it  does,  the  judge  must  give  notice  of  the  report  to  that 
person.  The person can ask the judge for a hearing and submit a written 
response  to  the  grand  jury’s  report  and  ask  the  judge  to  attach  that 
response to  the  report  when  the  report is  published.   At  the  hearing,  the 
judge will decide whether the part of the report that may adversely reflect 
upon  the  named  (or  otherwise  identified)  person  is  supported  by 
“substantial evidence.”  If not, the judge will return the report to the grand 
jury with an explanation of why the report has not been made public.  

he  grand  jury  can  then  decide  whether  to  conduct  further  proceedings, 

revise the report, or appeal the judge’s decision to a higher court. 

f  the  judge  finds  no  problems  with  the  report,  the  judge  will  order  that 
the  report  be  made  public.    The  judge  will  also  direct  that  copies  of  the 
report  be  sent  to  other  persons  “as  reasonably  requested  by  the  grand 
jury.”

PART V 
GLOSSARY 
 

he  list  below  defines  some  terms  used  in  this  booklet,  as  well  as  some 

terms you might hear at the court. 

apital crime — A crime that is punishable by death.  In Alaska, there are 
no state offenses that have a death penalty.   

harge — (1) A formal accusation that someone has committed a crime, or  
(2) the reading of the jury instructions to the jury by the judge. 

vidence — Any form of proof presented to the grand jury.  There are two 
main  types  of  evidence:  exhibits  and  testimony  of  witnesses.    The  grand 
jury decides what the exhibits and testimony prove or don’t prove, and the 
level of importance to attach to a piece of evidence.  

xculpatory — “Exculpatory” evidence is evidence that shows or tends to 
show  that  the  defendant  is  not  guilty.  It  is  the  opposite  of  “inculpatory” 
evidence, which tends to prove guilt.  

xhibit — A paper, document, photograph, video, or other physical object 
presented to the grand jury as evidence. 

elony — A crime where the defendant has the possibility of being sentenced 
to jail for more than one year. 

rand jury — A jury  of 12 to 18 persons selected to inquire into alleged 
crimes in order to decide whether the evidence is sufficient to justify a trial.  
Only the prosecutor presents evidence to the grand jury. 

ndictment — The name of the document the grand jury uses to charge  a 
person  with  a  crime.    It  is  prepared  for  the  grand  jury  by  the  District 
Attorney  (the  prosecutor).    It  is  signed  by  the  foreperson  on  behalf  of  the 
grand jury.

information  —  the  name  of  the  document  prosecutors  use  to  charge  a 
person with a crime.  An information can always be used to charge a person 
with a misdemeanor, but it cannot be used to charge a person with a felony 
unless  the  person  waives  (gives  up)  the  right  to  have  a  grand  jury  decide 
whether the case has merit. 

awyer — A person licensed to practice law.  Other words for  lawyer are 
"attorney"  or  "counsel."    In  criminal  cases,  the  government’s  lawyer  is 
often called the "prosecutor." 

isdemeanor  —  A crime where the  maximum sentence the defendant can 

receive is one year or less in jail. 

rosecutor  —  The  lawyer  who  represents  the  government  (and  the 
interests  of  the  general  public)  in  a  criminal  case.    The  prosecutor  brings 
charges  against  people  accused  of  crimes  and  attempts  to  prove  those 
charges  in  court.    If  the  alleged  crime  is  a  violation  of  state  law,  the 
prosecutor will be the District Attorney or an Assistant District Attorney.  

ubpoena  —  A  court  order  that  requires  a  person  to  appear  and  testify  in 
court.  It can also require the person to bring documents to court.  

estimony — Any statement made by a witness under oath in court. 

rial  jury  —  In  criminal  cases,  the  trial  jury  decides  whether  persons 
charged with crimes are  guilty  or  not guilty.    At  trial,  both  the  prosecutor 
and the defense can present evidence.   A judge presides over the trial and 
gives instructions to jurors about the law.  The judge also determines what 
evidence can be presented to the jury if there are disputes about whether it 
is legal to admit a particular piece of evidence.  

rue bill — The words written on the prosecutor’s proposed indictment if 
the  grand  jury  votes  in  favor  of  charging  the  defendant  with  the  crime 
described  in  the  indictment.    If  the  grand  jury  votes  against  charging  the 
defendant with this crime, the words “not a true bill” must be written on the 
proposed indictment.
