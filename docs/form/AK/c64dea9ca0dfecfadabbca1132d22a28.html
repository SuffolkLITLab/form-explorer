INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILING AN APPEAL 
TO THE SUPERIOR COURT 
FROM AN ADMINISTRATIVE REVOCATION 
OF DRIVER'S LICENSE UNDER AS 28.15.165 

Appellate Rules 601-612 govern appeals to the superior court.  
Appeals are complicated, and you may want to talk to a lawyer 
before you start this process. 

INTRODUCTION  

I. 

 

These instructions describe the procedure only for the following circumstances: 

1.  You allegedly failed a breath test for alcohol or refused to submit to one, and therefore 
your driver’s license was subject to automatically being revoked under AS 28.15.165;  
2.  You had a hearing at the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV)1 where you asked that your 

driver’s license not be revoked;  

3.  The  administrative  hearing  officer  decided 

to  uphold 

the  Department  of 

Administration's revocation of your driver's license; and 

4.  You want to appeal that hearing officer’s decision to the superior court.   

This appeal is called an "administrative appeal" because you are appealing the decision of 
an administrative agency, the  DMV.  These instructions are only applicable to  the special 
type of administrative appeal as described above.   

If you are appealing any other type of agency decision, including another type of decision 
by  the  DMV,  see Appellant Instructions – Appeal from Administrative Agency to Superior 
Court (form AP-210) instead.   

Definitions: 

A. 

ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL.  In an administrative appeal, the superior court reviews 
the final decision of a state or local government agency, board, or commission—in 
this case, the DMV.  An appeal is not a new hearing or a trial.  You cannot present 
any  new  evidence  to  the  superior  court.    The  only  information  that  the  superior 
court will consider on appeal is: 
1. 

an  electronic  recording  of  the  administrative  hearing  (unless  the  court 
requires a typed transcript instead); 
any  exhibits  (documents,  photographs,  videos,  or  physical  items)  offered 
as evidence at the administrative hearing; 
the documents and depositions in the agency file; and  
legal briefs filed in the appeal.2 

2. 
 
3. 
4. 

B. 

C. 

APPELLANT.  The appellant is the party who files the appeal.  In this case, you are 
the appellant. 

APPELLEE.  The appellee is the party who defends against the appeal.  In this case, 
the appellee is DMV. 

                                                                  
1   For purposes of these instructions, the “Department of Administration,” the “Division of Motor 

Vehicles (DMV),” and the “Department” all refer to the same agency. 

2   See section VI(B)(1) of these instructions for more information on legal briefs.

II. 

COPIES TO OTHER PARTIES 

The court rules require each party to give a copy of any document that the party files with 
the court to all other parties.3   You can give the documents to the other party by hand-
delivering or mailing the documents.  You can also email or fax a copy if the other party 
agreed  to  this  type  of  service.    For  every  document  that  you  file,  you  must  include  a 
signed  statement  that  you  gave  a  copy  to  the  other  parties.    This  is  called  “proof  of 
service.”    The  court  forms  include  a  certificate  of  service  section.  Make  sure  that  you 
always complete this section before you file the form with the court.  The DMV is usually 
represented by an attorney, so the documents must be served on the attorney instead of 
the agency.  Contact DMV to find out the name and address of the attorney representing it 
on  appeal,  or  wait  to  see  the  attorney’s  information  when  the  attorney  files  an Entry of 
Appearance.  See section III(C)(4) on page 4 about where you must send copies of your 
notice of appeal. 

II. 

TO FILE AN APPEAL 

Grounds for Appeal.4 

You may only file an appeal if you believe that DMV: 

•  misinterpreted the law, 
•  acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner, or 
•  made a determination unsupported by the evidence in the record. 

B. 

When to File. 

You can only file an appeal to the superior court after the DMV has held the 
administrative review hearing and made  its  final decision.  If DMV did not 
hold a hearing for any reason, you may appeal the denial of a hearing. 

Your must file a notice of appeal within 30 days from the date the hearing 
officer's decision is mailed or otherwise distributed to you.5  If you want to 
file  a  notice  of  appeal  after  the  30  days,  you  must  ask  the  court  for 
permission to accept it.  You can use Request and Order (form AP-135) for 
this.   File  your request to accept the late notice at the same time you file 
your notice of appeal. 

Notice. 
File Notice of Appeal (form AP-102) with the superior court in the location 
that would “best serve the convenience of the parties.”6  Most often this 
means  near  where  you  live  or  where  a  traffic  stop  occurred.    Attach  a 
copy of the DMV decision.7

decision  is  a  final  order  and  that  the  claimant  has  30  days  to  appeal.    Manning v. Alaska Railroad

Filing Fee. 
a. 

b. 

Bond.   

3. 

 

When you file, you will be required to pay a $250 filing fee.  Make 
your check or money order payable to "Clerk of Court." 
 
If you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, file Request for Exemption 
rom Payment of Fees (form TF-920) asking the court to waive it.     
f

-OR- 

You must file one of the following at the time you file your notice of appeal: 

•  a $750 cost bond 
•  a motion to waive or reduce cost bond 

a. 

$750 Cost Bond. 

The purpose of this bond is to make sure DMV's appeal costs will be 
reimbursed  by  you  if  you  lose  your  appeal  or  if  the  appeal  is 
dismissed.  To meet the cost bond requirement, you can either file a 
surety bond or make a cash deposit: 

(1) 

(2) 

Surety Bond.  This is a document that guarantees payment 
of  money  if  certain  things  occur.    The  person  or  company 
that  writes  the  bond  is  called  the  surety.    The  surety 
guarantees  the  payment  by  becoming  responsible  for  it.  
Such  bonds  are  generally  available 
insurance 
companies  or  third  parties  qualified  to  write  surety  bonds.  
There  will  be  a  fee.    The  court  system  does  not  provide 
forms for surety bonds.  

from 

Cash Deposit.  If you want to make a cash deposit with the 
court instead of filing a surety bond, complete Cash Deposit 
on Appeal (form AP-110).  Check the first box on the form, 
fill out the rest of it, acknowledge it before a court clerk or 
notary public, and give it to the clerk along with your money. 

The cost bond is $750 unless the superior court fixes a lesser 
amount.8  If you think this amount is too high because the 
expected appeal costs (including attorney fees) for DMV will be a 
lot less than $750, you may file: 
(1) Motion to Waive or Reduce Cost Bond (form AP-120).  
(2) Order Re Cost Bond (form AP-130).  Only fill out the top part of 
the AP-130 (the case caption).  The judge will fill out the rest. 

If you believe you cannot afford to post a $750 cost bond, you may 
file:  
(1) Motion to Waive or Reduce Cost Bond (form AP-120).  
(2) Order Re Cost Bond (form AP-130).  Only fill out the top part of 
the AP-130 (the case caption).  The judge will fill out the rest.  

b. 

Motion to Waive or Reduce Cost Bond. 

(3) Financial Statement (form CR-206).  
                                                                  
8  Appellate Rule 602(e)(1). 

AP-220 (4/22) 

3 

c. 

The court will notify you of its decision.  If the court orders you to 
post a cost bond, you must file a surety bond or cash deposit in the 
amount set by the court or your appeal will be dismissed. 

Return of Bond. 
After  the  appeal  is  decided,  the  court  will  send  you  and  DMV  a 
notice that the bond will be released unless there is an objection.  If 
you lose  your appeal,  DMV may  file  an objection  and  request that 
the bond be applied to DMV's appeal costs.  If DMV doesn’t file an 
objection, the court will return your cash deposit to you. 

4. 

Copies to DMV and Attorney General.  In this type of appeal, you must send 
a  copy  of  your  notice  of  appeal  and  all  attachments  to  both  of  the 
following: 
a. 

Director of Driver Licensing, DMV 
3901 Old Seward Hwy, Suite 101 
Anchorage, AK 99503 

b. 

Attorney General of Alaska 
P.O. Box 110300 
Juneau, AK  99811-0300 

Once the DMV’s lawyer files an Entry of Appearance, you only need to send 
future documents to the lawyer. 

V. 

PREPARATION OF RECORD 

In addition to the documents you file, the court needs the DMV’s records about the hearing 
and decision in your case.  The record on appeal will include all original papers and exhibits 
filed with DMV, and electronic recordings of all proceedings before the agency. 

The  court  will  notify  DMV  to  prepare  the  agency  file  by  a  certain  deadline.    DMV  must 
number the pages in its file, make a copy of the file, and send it to the court.  DMV must 
also make a copy of the electronic recordings of the hearings to send to the court.  Unless 
you and DMV agree otherwise, or the court orders otherwise, you must pay DMV to do this 
(usually  in advance).9   DMV  will  notify you  when  it  is  ready to  accept payment  and  how 
much it will be.  Within 30 days after this notice, you must pay DMV for preparation of 
the record.  If you do not, your appeal may be dismissed.10  
  
STAY OF ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER 

The  filing  of  your  appeal  does  not  automatically  “stay”  (stop)  the  revocation  of  your 
license.  If you think that your license should not be revoked while the appeal is pending, 
you must ask the court for a stay.  The court may grant the stay only if the court finds that 
there  is  a  reasonable  probability  that  (1)  you  will  win  your  appeal;  (2)  you  will  suffer 
irreparable  harm  if  the  license  revocation  is  not  stayed;  and  (3)  if  you  operate  a 
commercial motor vehicle, the public can be adequately protected by conditions imposed 
by the court.11

AP-220 (4/22)

Use Motion and Affidavit for Stay (form AP-145) to ask for this.  If you file this motion at 
the same time you file your  notice of  appeal, include a copy of the motion in the  packet 
that  you  send  to  DMV  in  Anchorage  and  the  Attorney  General  in  Juneau  (see  section 
III(C)(4) on the previous page).  If you file your motion later, send a copy of it to DMV’s 
attorney.  You can find out who that is by calling DMV.   
 

 
VI.  WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOUR APPELLATE CASE IS OPENED 

A. 

Assignment of Judge.    

After you have opened your appellate case, the court will notify you of the name of 
the judge assigned to hear it.  You have the right to a “peremptory challenge” (to 
ask for a different judge) one time only, without giving a reason.  If you do this, 
you  will  be  randomly  assigned  a  different  superior  court  judge  to  hear  the 
appeal.   Use Notice of Change of Judge (form TF-935).  You must file this notice 
within five days of being notified of the assigned judge. 

B. 

Briefing Schedule.   

A “legal brief” is a document that you write to explain your side of the case to the 
judge.    When  the  case  is  ready  for  briefing,  the  court  will  send  you  and  DMV's 
attorney Notice Setting Appeal Procedure  (form AP-307).  This  notice  will tell you 
the time schedule for filing legal briefs and requesting oral argument.   

You must file a brief within the time limit set by the court’s notice.  If you do not, 
your appeal may be dismissed.  If you cannot file within the time limit, file Request 
and Order (form AP-135) asking the court for more time.  

Along  with  your  brief,  you  must  prepare  an  "excerpt  of  record."    Instructions  for 
preparing an excerpt are in paragraph 2 on the next page. 

1. 

Legal  Brief.    The  full  rules  for  what  your  legal  brief  must  include  and 
what  format  it  must  be  in  are  in  Appellate  Rules  605(a),  212(c),  and 
513.5.  These instructions only provide a summary of these rules.  Read 
the  full  text  of  the  rules  to  make  sure  you  are  complying  with  all 
requirements.   

 

 

 

The  substance  of  your  brief  must  include  the  following  sections,  in  the 
following order: 

a.  a table of contents 
b.  a  table  of  all  legal  authorities  cited  to  in  your  brief  (case  law, 
statutes,  and  regulations)  and  the  text  of  the  primary  laws  you 
are relying on 

c.  a “jurisdictional statement”12 
d.  a statement of the issues you want the court to review 
e.  a summary of the facts of the case and the agency proceedings 
f.  a discussion of the law and its application to the facts (this is where 

you discuss your appeal arguments in detail) 

g.  a short conclusion explaining what you want the court to order   

                                                                  
12   The includes a statement about the date of the final agency decision, whether the decision is final on 
all issues, and the legal authority of the superior court to hear the appeal (this authority can be found 
in the rules and statutes referred to in the beginning of these instructions). 

AP-220 (4/22)

Sections e and f must include citations to the record for each argument or 
statement you make.  See “Citation Guidelines” below for how to do this. 

Your brief must be typed or written (using black ink), double-spaced on 8.5" 
x  11"  white  paper.    Number  all  of  the  pages  except  for  the  cover,  the 
table of contents, and the table of legal authorities.  Only type or write on 
one side of each page.  Your initial brief must be no longer than 50 pages 
(excluding the cover, table of contents, and table of legal authorities).  If 
DMV files a brief in response, you have the option (but are not required) 
to file a reply brief, addressing  any new points brought up in the DMV’s 
brief.  Your reply brief must be no longer than 20 pages. 

Appellant Brief Cover Sheet  (form  AP-162) may be  used  as the cover of 
your brief.  It is available as a fillable form online.  It is also included as 
the second-to-last page of these instructions, which you may detach and 
fill out by hand. 

Citation Guidelines.  In your brief, you must refer to specific pages in the 
excerpt  of  record  or  a  deposition  that  support  your  arguments  or 
statements about the facts.13   After  each  argument  or  statement  of  fact, 
place the referral citation in parenthesis at the end. 

a.  To cite to the excerpt of record, write “(Exc. ___)” -- write the 

appropriate page number of the excerpt on the blank line. 

b.  To  cite  to  a  deposition,  write  “(Dep.  of  ___,  page  __)”  --  write 
the name of the person who gave the deposition on the first blank 
line, and the page of that deposition on the second blank line. 

Documents in an Excerpt of Record: (Exc. 26) 
 
Deposition: (Dep. of Tom Davis, page 20) 

 

 

Excerpt  of  Record.    In  addition  to  your  brief,  you  must  prepare  an 
excerpt  of  record.    You  must  include  copies  of  the  following  in  your 
excerpt: 
• 
• 
•  your request to DMV for review 
• 
•  any other orders or rulings DMV made in your case  that you want 

the notice of license revocation 
the law enforcement officer's sworn report that was filed with DMV 

the decision or order of DMV that you are appealing 

the court to review 

•  any written opinion, findings, or other statements issued by DMV to 

explain the reasons for its decision 

•  any other documents in DMV's file that you cite in your brief, or that 

you think the court must look at to properly review the case 

Do not simply use the entire agency file or include extra documents that 
are  not  listed  above.    The  court  needs  to  be  able  to  easily  locate  the 
relevant parts of the record that support your statements, and not search 
through a large stack of papers.  

Examples:

13   For purely legal arguments, you may cite to a statute, a regulation, a constitutional provision, or case 

law instead.

Do  not  include  anything  in  your  excerpt  that  was  not  presented  in  the 
original DMV proceeding.  You cannot present new evidence in the appeal. 

 

 

 

To prepare your excerpt: 

a.  Look  through  the  agency  file  that  was  prepared  after  you  filed 
your notice of appeal (see section IV of these  instructions).  The 
DMV  gives the  file  to  the  court,  so  if  DMV  did  not provide  you  a 
copy, it is also available at the court where you filed your appeal.  
Make copies of all of the pages that you need need from the file 
(or  pull  them  out  from  your  own  copy).    Consult  the  list  on  the 
previous page to make sure you are including just the documents 
that you need, and are not leaving any required ones out. 

b.  Arrange the documents in chronological order by the date they were 

signed, with the oldest one on top.    

c.  Put  page  numbers  on  the  bottom  of  each  page,  starting  with  "1" 
and numbering each new page until the last page is numbered.  Do 
not start over the numbering for each document.   

d.  Create a table of contents.   List the title of each document, the date 
it  was  signed,  and  the  page  number  (from  c  above)  on  which  it 
begins.  Put the table of contents on top.   

e.  Prepare a cover page.  Excerpt of Record Cover Sheet  (form AP-
165) may  be used.  It  is available as a fillable form online.  It is 
also  included  as  the  last  page  of  these  instructions,  which  you 
may detach and fill out by hand. 

f.  Staple the excerpt separately from your brief.   

3. 

4. 

5. 

Service.  Send or give a copy of both your brief and your excerpt to 
DMV's attorney.  You must show proof that you did this by filling out and 
filing a certificate of service.  These certificates are already included on 
the sample cover sheets (forms AP-162 and AP-165).  You can find the 
name and address of DMV’s attorney by calling DMV. 

File with the Court.  After you have given copies to the DMV’s attorney, 
file  both  your  brief  and  your  excerpt  of  record  with  the  court  by  the 
deadline in the notice that the court clerk previously sent to you. 

Reply Brief.  If you choose to file a reply brief, you may also include an 
additional excerpt of record.  Only do this if there are new excerpts that 
you want to refer to that were not already included in your initial excerpt 
or in the excerpt that the DMV filed with its brief. 

C. 

Oral Argument.   

“Oral argument” is when you explain your side of the case to the appellate judge 
and try to persuade the judge why you should get what you are asking for.  Oral 
argument is not a new trial or a chance to present more evidence.  You cannot call 
witnesses to testify.  You are limited to explaining in more detail the arguments 
you made in your legal brief.  Sometimes, the judge will ask you questions about 
what you say during oral argument or what you wrote in your brief.  Each side 
gets 15 minutes to speak, unless otherwise ordered.14   

                                                                  
14   An exception is if the DMV does not file a legal brief, the DMV waives (gives up) the right to speak at 

oral argument.   

AP-220 (4/22) 

7 

The deadline to request oral argument is: 

(1) 

(2) 

If  the  DMV  files  a  brief,  then  within  10  days  after  the  date  your 
reply brief is due; or 

If the DMV does not file a brief, then within 10 days after the due 
date for the DMV’s brief expired.   

If  DMV  timely  requests  oral  argument,  you  may  not  object  to  the  request.15    As 
long  as  at  least  one  party  makes  a  timely  request,  the  court  will  automatically 
schedule  oral  argument.    The  request  must  be  in  writing,  but  does  not  need  to 
explain  why  oral  argument  is  necessary.   You  may  use Request and Order  (form 
AP-135) to ask for oral argument. 

If  your  request  for  oral  argument  is  filed  after  the  deadline,  you  must  also 
include a request for the court to accept your late filing.  You may use Request 
and Order (form AP-135) to both ask for the oral argument to be scheduled, and 
to explain why the court should accept your late request. 

If you file a request for oral argument, you must serve a copy of your request on 
the DMV’s attorney.  Make sure to fill out the certificate of service showing that 
you did this. 

II.  DECISION 

The  superior  court  will  decide  the  appeal  based  on  the  record,  the  briefs  and  excerpts 
submitted, and oral arguments (if held).  The court will send you a copy of the decision.  
The decision may: 
• 
• 
• 
• 

affirm (agree with) the DMV decision, 
remand (send the case back for additional action by DMV), 
reverse the decision made by DMV, or 
dismiss your appeal. 

VIII.  ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS 

In  administrative  appeals,  Appellate  Rule  508  determines  who  may  apply  for  costs  and 
attorney fees at the end of an appeal.  Generally, you (the appellant) may apply for costs 
and attorney fees if DMV's decision is reversed.16 

Costs.   The clerk will send the parties Notice Re Costs and Attorney Fees on Appeal (form 
AP-333) along with a copy of the appeal decision.  If you won the appeal, and you want to 
recover  costs,  file  a  verified17  and  itemized  bill  of  costs  within  10  days  after  the  date 
shown in the clerk's certificate of distribution on the appeal decision.  If the decision was 
mailed to you, you have an additional three calendar days to file your bill of costs.   

                                                                  
15   Appellate Rule 605.5. 
16   If the decision is affirmed or if the appeal is dismissed, then the DMV may ask the court to award 

costs and attorney fees against you.   

17   “Verified” means your cost bill must include a statement signed by a court clerk or notary public that 
you have sworn or affirmed that the information in the cost bill is true.  See Alaska Statute 09.63.030 
for the wording of a verification.

The only costs you may ask for are: 

 
 

 
 

1. 
2. 

3. 
4. 

the filing fee 
the  fee  DMV  charged  you  for  preparing  the  agency  file  and  copying  the 
electronic recording of the hearing for the court 
the cost of copying and mailing briefs and excerpts of record 
extra costs related to bonds, such as surety fees or bank fees  

You must serve a copy of your bill of costs on DMV's attorney, who has seven days to file 
objections.  The clerk will then decide what costs to award and send both parties a copy of 
the decision. 

Attorney Fees.  File a request for attorney fees within 10 days after the date shown in 
the  clerk’s  certificate  of distribution on  the  appeal  decision.  You may  use Request and 
Order (form AP-135) to do this.  Be sure to attach a detailed invoice showing your actual 
attorney  fees.    Non-attorneys  cannot  request  attorney  fees  for  representing  themselves.  
Include  an  explanation  of  why  you  are  allowed  to  recover  attorney  fees  under  Appellate 
Rule 508(e).  You must send a copy of the request to DMV's attorney, who has seven days 
to file objections.  The court will send you a copy of the judge's decision on the request.
