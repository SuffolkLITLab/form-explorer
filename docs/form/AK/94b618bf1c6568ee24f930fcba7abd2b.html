      <pre>HOW TO SUBPOENA A WITNESS 

  subpoena  (pronounced  "suh  PEEN  uh")  is  a  court  order  that  requires  a  person  to  appear  and 
testify in court (or at a deposition).1  If you believe a witness may not come to court when you ask, 
you should have a subpoena issued by the court. If you do not subpoena a witness and the witness 
does not appear at the hearing, you may be required to present your side of the case without that 
witness.  

ypes of Subpoenas 

here are three types of subpoenas.  The first two can be used to order a witness to appear in court.  

The third is used to order a witness to appear at a deposition.  See pages 4 - 6 for copies of all three.

The Subpoena to Appear (CIV-111) is used to order a witness to appear in court to testify. It 
may not be used to order a witness to bring documents or anything else to court. If you want 
a Subpoena to Appear, do the following: 

Go to the clerk’s office and get the subpoena form.  
Fill in the blanks on the form.  See sample on page 4. 
Make  sure  the  clerk  has  signed  and  sealed  the  subpoena  (which  usually  will  have 
been done before giving the subpoena form to you). 
Have the subpoena served on the witness as explained in the "Service of Subpoenas" 
section on the next page.  

 
The Subpoena to Appear and Produce (CIV-110) orders the witness to bring along certain 
documents or other tangible things when the witness appears in court to testify in a case. If 
you want this type of subpoena, do the following: 

Go to the clerk’s office and get the subpoena form. 
Fill in the blanks on the form.  See sample on page 5. 
Have the clerk sign and seal the subpoena. 
Have the subpoena served on the witness as explained in the "Service of Subpoenas" 
section on the next page. 

 
The  Subpoena  for  Taking  Deposition  (CIV-115)  is  used  to  order  a  person  to  testify  at  a 
deposition.    A  "deposition"  is  a  proceeding  at  which  the  sworn  testimony  of  a  witness  is 
taken outside of court.2  This subpoena may also order the person being deposed (questioned 
at  the  deposition)  to  bring  documents  or  other  evidence  to  the  deposition.    To  get  one  of 
these subpoenas, do the following: 

 

a. 

Serve  a  "notice  of  deposition"  on  every  other  party  in  the  case.    See  Civil  Rules 
30(b) and 31(a) for what the notice must contain.

e. 

Show the court clerk proof that the "notice of deposition" has been given, and ask 
the clerk for a CIV-115 subpoena form.  (Note:  Do not file the proof with the court 
just show it to the clerk.3)   
Fill in the blanks on the form.  See sample on page 6. 
Have the clerk sign and seal the subpoena. 
Have the subpoena served on the witness as explained in the "Service of Subpoenas" 
section below. 

itness Fees 

ou must pay a witness fee to each witness you subpoena.  Witness fees are $12.50 if it will not 
take more than 3 hours of the witness’ time to attend the trial or hearing (including travel time).  
The witness fee is $25.00 if it will take more than 3 hours of a witness’ time to attend the trial or 
hearing (including travel time).  In addition, witnesses who travel more than 30 miles from their 
residence  must  also  be  paid  round  trip  mileage  at  the  rate  allowed  for  state  employees.4  
Witnesses attending from a point so far away that they cannot return to their residence day-to-
day also receive a per diem for meals and lodging.5  However, the per diem fees do not need to 
be paid to the witness when the subpoena is served. 

 check made payable to the witness for the correct fee must be attached to the subpoena when it 

is served on the witness.

office to serve the subpoena (currently $5.00)6 

he clerk will mail a copy of the subpoena to the witness and retain the original for the 
court  file.   After  the  witness  picks  up  the  certified  mail,  the  Post  Office  will  return  the 
green card (return delivery receipt) to you.  You should bring the green card receipt with 
you when you come to court in case you need to prove that the witness was served with 
the subpoena.  If the witness does not pick up the certified mail, you must try personal 
service, described below. 

OTE:  You will need to contact the post office to determine the current postage required 
for  certified  mail.    You  will  also  need  to  contact  the  clerk’s  office  to  determine  the 
current fee charged by the court to serve the subpoena by certified mail. 
 
Personal Service 

2. 

 subpoena can be served on a witness by any person who is at least 18 years old and 
who  is  not  a  party  to  the  action.    This  includes  licensed  process  servers  and  police 
officers. 

f  you  want  to  use  a  process  server,  you  can  get  a  list  of  them  from  the  court  clerk's 
office. Or, contact the Permits and Licensing Unit of the Alaska State Troopers at (907) 
269-0393 for a list of licensed process servers.  Each process server sets his/her own fees 
for this  service.   For more information  about process servers, see the booklet CIV-106, 
How to Serve A Summons.  If you choose to have a police officer serve the subpoena, you 
must contact your local police department for instructions and fee information. 

he person who has served the subpoena on the witness must provide proof of the service 
by  making  a  written  statement  of  the  facts  (such  as  the  date  and  time  of  service,  the 
document handed to the witness, the name of the person serving the subpoena, etc.) and 
signing it.  The signature must be notarized.  This "proof of service" requirement can be 
satisfied by filling out the "RETURN" section in the bottom half of the subpoena form. 

ou should bring this written and notarized proof of service with you when you come to 
your  hearing  or  trial  in  case  you  need  to  prove  that  the  witness  was  served  with  the 
subpoena.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
