FOR SPOUSES FILING TOGETHER 
WHEN THERE ARE NO MINOR CHILDREN OF THE MARRIAGE 

se  Packet  No.  1  instead  of  this  packet  if  a  party  is  pregnant  or  if  there  are  any 
children born or adopted during this marriage who are currently under age 19.  (If a 
child was conceived or born while you were married, the husband is the legal father 
of  the  child  and  owes  a  duty  of  support,  unless  the  affidavits  required  by  AS 
18.50.160(d)  are  executed,  or  until  the  husband's  paternity  is  disestablished  by  a 
court or child support enforcement agency.) 

Court staff generally can inform you about court procedures, court 
rules, court  records,  and forms.   Court  staff must  remain neutral 
and impartial.  They are not allowed to give legal advice. Court staff 
cannot: 

advise you how statutes and rules apply to your case, 
tell  you  whether  the  documents  you  prepare  properly 
present your case, 
tell  you  what  the  best  procedures  are  to  accomplish  a 
particular objective, or  
interpret laws for you. 

f you need help with your case, you should talk to a lawyer. 

any  of  the  agreements  you  will  make  in  your  petition  for 
dissolution will have tax consequences (including agreements about 
property division and spousal maintenance).  It  is very important 
that you get an accountant's or attorney's advice about these tax 
consequences before making your agreement.

Dissolution of Marriage 

  decree  of  dissolution  of  marriage  has  the  same  force  and  effect  as  a  decree  of  divorce.  
However, the procedures for getting a dissolution are somewhat different than those for a divorce.  
Dissolution  procedures  are  described  in  Alaska  Statutes  25.24.200  -  .260  and  Civil  Rule  90.1.  
Divorce procedures are described in Alaska Statutes 25.24.010 - .180 and Civil Rule 90.1.

Requirements 

he requirements for using dissolution procedure (if there are no children born or adopted during 

the marriage who are currently under age 19 and a party is not pregnant) are: 

Either  spouse (Party A or Party B) or both spouses  must be  domiciled in Alaska.  That 
means the person claims residency in Alaska.  The person must be physically present in 
Alaska and intend to remain indefinitely.   No  minimum number of days of residency  is 
required.  In addition, military personnel who do not claim to be Alaska residents may file 
for dissolution if they have been continuously stationed at a military base or installation 
in Alaska for at least 30 days.  AS 25.24.900. 

Both  spouses  must  agree  that  "incompatibility  of  temperament  has  caused  the 
irremediable breakdown of the marriage."  This means there is no chance of saving the 
marriage because the spouses cannot get along.  In other words, the marriage has broken 
down and the spouses no longer want to be married. 

The spouses must both agree on all of the following: 

a. 

b. 
c. 

d. 

distribution of all real property and personal marital property (both jointly owned 
and  separately  owned,  and  community  property  under  AS  34.77),  including 
retirement benefits, 
payment of spousal maintenance (alimony), if any, 
payment of all existing debts owed by either or both spouses, and payment of any 
debts that may be incurred jointly in the future, and 
the tax consequences of all the above agreements. 

The property and spousal maintenance agreements must be fair and just and must take 
into consideration the factors listed in AS 25.24.160(a)(2) and (4) so that the economic 
effect of the dissolution is fairly allocated. 

f you cannot meet one or more of these requirements, contact a lawyer to find out what your 
options are.

DR-15 (3/23) 
INSTRUCTIONS – DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE FOR SPOUSES (NO MINOR CHILDREN) 

o get a decree dissolving your marriage, you must do the following: 

Procedure to Follow 

. 

Fill out the following three forms attached to these instructions (and available online): 

a. 

b. 

c. 

Form  DR-100,  Petition  for  Dissolution  of  Marriage  (No  Children).  See  these 
instructions beginning on page 5. 

Form DR-314, Information Sheet. 

Form VS-401, Certificate of Divorce, Dissolution of Marriage or Annulment.   
Complete the “Parties’ Information” block, lines 11-30.  If you make a mistake, get 
a new form from the court.  This form will be sent to the Health Analytics and Vital 
Records office after the dissolution is granted, and they will not accept forms with 
cross-outs,  whiteouts,  or  other  corrections  on  them.  Health  Analytics  and  Vital 
Records also will not accept photocopies of the VS-401 form. 
 

File these three forms at the clerk's office and pay the filing fee according to Administrative 
Rule  9(b).    If  you  cannot  afford  the  fee,  ask  the  clerk  for  form  TF-920,  Request  for 
Exemption from Payment of Fees. 

Note:  Once the petition is signed by the first party signing it, you have only 60 days to 
file it with the court.  If you delay filing beyond that date, the court will not accept it.  Civil 
Rule 90.1. 

Ask the clerk's office for instructions on setting a hearing date.  The hearing must be at 
least 30 days after the date the petition is filed.  It will be set for a time acceptable to 
both parties. 

Amendment or Withdrawal of Petition. 

After the petition is filed, any of the terms of the petition may be amended if both parties 
agree and complete form DR-115, Amendment of Agreement, and file it with the court. 

If  either  spouse  wants  to  withdraw  from  the  agreement,  that  spouse  must  file  form  
DR-120,  Withdrawal  of  Agreement,  with  the  court  before  the  decree  is  signed.    If  the 
agreement is withdrawn, the case will be dismissed. 

If you decide to use either of these forms, be sure to fill in the case number which the 
court clerk assigned to your petition. 

Hearing. 

At least one party must attend the hearing.  It is preferred that both parties attend.  If a 
party chooses not to attend, that party must fill out and sign form DR-110, Appearance 
and Waiver of Notice of Hearing (included in this packet), acknowledge it before a court 
clerk or notary public and file it with the court. 

If any of the following are true, both parties must attend the hearing unless excused by 
the court: 

a. 
b. 

one party is represented by counsel and the other is not, or 
there  is  evidence  that  a  party  committed  a  crime  involving  domestic  violence 
during the marriage, or

DR-15 (3/23) 
INSTRUCTIONS – DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE FOR SPOUSES (NO MINOR CHILDREN) 

c. 

 
 

if any of the following has been issued or filed during the marriage by or regarding 
either spouse as defendant, participant, or respondent: 
(1) 
(2) 
(3) 

a criminal charge of a crime involving domestic violence, 
a domestic violence protective order under AS 18.66.100 - 18.66.180, 
injunctive relief against  domestic violence under former AS 25.35.010 or 
25.35.020, or 
a domestic violence protective order issued in another jurisdiction and filed 
with the court in this state under AS 18.66.140, or 

(4) 

d. 
e. 

there is a minor child of the marriage, or 
there is a patently inequitable division of the marital estate. 

In order to be excused by the court in one of these situations, the party must show that 
it  would be a  significant hardship  for the party to  attend the hearing.  The party must 
explain the hardship on the form mentioned above, DR-110, Appearance and Waiver of 
Notice of Hearing, and file the form with the court. 

The court will then decide whether the hardship is significant enough to allow the party 
not to appear.  If the court allows the party not to appear in person, the court may still 
require the party to be available by telephone to answer questions during the hearing.  
The absent party may be required to pay the costs of the telephone call. 

Each party may have a lawyer at the hearing but you are not required to have one. 

At the hearing, the court will ask questions to determine whether you fully understand the 
nature  and  consequences  of  the  proceeding;  whether  the  terms  of  all  your  written 
agreements  are  fair  and  just;  and  whether  all the  requirements  listed  on  page  2  have 
been met. 

The  judge  may  amend  the  agreements  between  the  spouses,  but  only  if  both  parties 
agree in writing (or in person at the hearing) with the amendment. 

t some court locations, hearings are held before a Superior Court Master instead of a 
judge.  A master cannot grant a decree.  A master can only recommend to a judge whether 
or not a decree should be granted. 

The Decree. 

 A

Although in some cases the decree may be granted at the hearing (if the hearing is before 
a judge rather than a master), usually the decree is not entered until a few days later.  
Do not assume a decree has been granted until you receive your copy. 

You must carry out any agreements made in your petition or otherwise required by the 
decree.    This  might  include,  for  example,  transferring  title  to  property or  notifying  the 
administrator of a retirement plan about the effect of the decree on a spouse's retirement 
benefits.  You will probably need to contact a lawyer to prepare the necessary deeds and 
other legal documents to make these transfers.  The court does not do this for you.

How To Fill Out The Petition 

hen you fill out the Petition form and any other forms you file with the court, please type or 
print neatly in black ink.  Do not leave any spaces blank. If more space is needed, attach additional 
pages and have each additional page signed by both petitioners. 

t the top of the petition form, fill in the city where the superior court is located.  Then fill in your 

names on the lines in the box.  Leave the "Case No." line blank. 

ection I.  INFORMATION ABOUT PETITIONERS (pages 1-2) 

Fill in all lines.  If your mailing address changes after you file the petition but before the 
decree is entered, you must send the court written notice of your new mailing address.  
Be sure to include your case number in any letters to the court. 

ection II.  FINANCIAL INFORMATION (pages 3-4) 

Parts A. - C.  Gross Income, Deductions and Net Income. 

You must include all sources of income whether they are listed on the form or not.  Each 
party must attach a copy of his or her most recent federal tax return (including 
W2) and at least two of his or her most recent pay stubs to verify income and 
deductions. 

Part D.  Monthly Expenses.  List average expenses per month. 

ection III.  PROPERTY & DEBT INFORMATION, & AGREEMENT OF PETITIONERS (pages 4-7) 

Part A.  Assets. 

Describe  all  assets  of  both  parties  acquired  during  the  marriage  plus  any  premarital 
property which should be divided in order to be fair to both parties.  This includes both 
separately owned and jointly owned property.  It also includes any "community property" 
if the parties have signed a community property agreement under Alaska law.  List the 
value of each asset.  Check the boxes showing whether the asset was acquired during the 
marriage and who presently  possesses  the asset (A  =  Party A,  B  =  Party  B, and JT  = 
jointly owned).  Then check the box showing to whom you want the asset awarded.  If 
the  asset  is  to  be  divided  between  you,  then  show  what  fraction  or  percentage  each 
person is to get instead of checking the boxes. 

You  must  agree  to  a  division  of  the  property  which  is  fair  and  just  to  both  spouses.  
Ordinarily, the fairest division of the property is an equal division.  However, there may 
be some circumstances, such as a marriage of very short duration, which would justify 
something other than an equal division of all items acquired during the marriage. 

Assets include all kinds of property and rights in property. "Real property" means buildings 
and land.  "Personal property" includes such things as pets, jewelry, automobiles, boats, 
airplanes,  snow  machines,  furniture,  household  goods,  bank  accounts,  etc.    Other 
examples  of  assets  are  businesses,  contract  rights,  stocks,  bonds,  and  employment 
benefits  such  as  the  value  of  retirement  plans,  deferred  compensation,  accumulated 
employee leave time, 401(k) plans, and (for Alaska State employees) the Supplemental 
Benefits System annuity.

Assets must be clearly identified.  Motor vehicles and other property requiring a certificate 
of title or registration must be identified by make, model, and license number, and/or by 
identification  number  (VIN,  HIN,  SN).    Bank,  credit  union,  or  other  financial  institution 
accounts may be identified by the last 3 digits of the account number and the name of 
the financial institution.  Do not provide the full account number. 

Your  property  division  agreement  must  fairly  allocate  the  economic  effect  of  the 
dissolution.  It must take into consideration the following factors listed in Alaska Statute 
25.24.160(a)(4): 

the length of the marriage and station in life of the parties during the marriage; 

the age and health of the parties; 

the  earning  capacity  of  the  parties,  including  their  educational  backgrounds, 
training,  employment  skills,  work  experiences,  length  of  absence  from  the  job 
market, and custodial responsibilities for children during the marriage; 

the financial condition of the parties, including the availability and cost of health 
insurance; 

the  conduct  of  the  parties,  including  whether  there  has  been  unreasonable 
depletion of marital assets; 

the  desirability  of  awarding  the  family  home,  or  the  right  to  live  in  it  for  a 
reasonable  period  of  time,  to  the  party  who  has  primary  physical  custody  of 
children; 

the circumstances and necessities of each party; 

the time and manner of acquisition of the property in question; and 

the income-producing capacity of the property and the value of the property at 
the time of division. 

Note:  The court may not award to one spouse real or personal property acquired by the 
other  spouse  before  the  date  of  the  marriage,  unless  the  spouses  expressly  agree 
otherwise or the court determines that the property should be made available (by sale or 
other conveyance) to ensure that the best interests of the children are provided for.  AS 
25.24.230(g).

INSTRUCTIONS – DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE FOR SPOUSES (NO MINOR CHILDREN) 

Part A.5    Retirement Benefits  (page 6) 

One special type of personal property which you must agree about is retirement benefits.  
If,  during  your  marriage,  either  spouse  has  accrued  the  right  to  someday  receive 
retirement benefits as a result of employment or military service, you will need to decide 
how to divide the value of those benefits between you.  You ordinarily need to do this 
even if the employee spouse has not yet "vested" in the retirement program. 

You  will  probably  need  the  help  of  an  attorney  and/or  the 
administrator of the retirement plan.  You should obtain and review 
any  available  written  summary  of  the  retirement  plan  and  a 
statement of the value of the employee's expected benefits. 

Generally, you can divide these benefits in either of two ways: 

1. 

2. 

You can let the current owner of the benefits (the covered employee) keep the 
benefits  and  give  the  other  spouse  cash  or  other  assets  worth  half  the  current 
value of the part of the benefits  accrued  during  the marriage.  This, of course, 
requires you to figure out what the current value of the benefits is.  You may need 
the help of an actuary to do this. 

Or,  you  can  give  the  non-employee  spouse  the  right  to  receive  part  of  the 
retirement benefits when those benefits are eventually paid out.  Under this option, 
it is not necessary to figure out the current value of the benefits.  Both spouses 
will have to wait to receive any payments until the employee spouse is eligible to 
receive the benefits.   

If  you  choose  this  option,  in  most  cases  your  agreement  must  meet  the 
requirements  of  a  "qualified  domestic  relations  order"  (QDRO)  as  that  term  is 
defined in the statutes which apply to the retirement plan.*  Also, your agreement, 
along  with  the  dissolution  decree,  must  be  filed  with  and  accepted  by  the 
administrator of the retirement plan before it will be effective.  It is important to 
contact  the  administrator  of  the  retirement  plan  before  filing  your  written 
agreement with the court and request copies of the plan, procedures for QDRO's, 
and any forms the plan administrator may have prepared. 

____________________________________________________________________________ 
Note:  The requirements for dividing military retirement pay are different.  A QDRO is not 
required.  The Uniform Services Former Spouses’ Protection Act (10 U.S.C. 1408) describes 
the procedure that must be followed in order for the former spouse to receive payment 
directly from the government.  For example, the spouse’s agreement must show that the 
spouses were married to each other for 10 or more years during which time the military 
member  performed  at  least  10  years  of  creditable  service.    The  agreement  must 
specifically  provide  for  payment  of  an  amount  from  the  military  member's  "disposable 
retired pay" to the former spouse.  The amount must be stated either in dollars or as a 
percentage of the member's disposable retired pay.  For more information about what is 
required and about the application form you must fill out and submit after you obtain your 
dissolution  decree  (DD Form  2293),  contact  the Legal  Assistance  Office at  any  military 
installation  in  Alaska.    If  you  do  not  meet  the  “10/10”  requirement,  any  retirement 
payments that you agree should be made to the former spouse would have to be made 
by  the  military  member  instead  of  coming  directly  to  the  former  spouse  from  the 
government.

You will have to write your retirement benefits agreement on a separate piece of 
paper and attach it to your petition.  It will have to include the basic requirements 
of a QDRO, which are: 

 

It must name the retirement plan or program. 

It  must  give the  right  to  receive  part  or  all of  the  benefits  payable  with 
respect  to  the  employee  covered  by  the  plan  to  an  "alternate  payee" 
(meaning, in this case, the other spouse). 

It  must  state  the  name  and  last  known  mailing  address  of  both  the 
employee and the "alternate payee." 

It must state the amount or percentage of the employee's benefit, or of 
any survivor's benefit, to be paid to the "alternate payee"; or it must set 
out the manner in which that amount or percentage is to be determined. 

It  must  set  out  the  number  of  payments  or  period  of  time  to  which the 
agreement/order applies. 

 

f. 

It must not do any of the following: 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

require  any  type  or  form  of  benefit  or  any  option  not  otherwise 
provided by the plan, or 

require an increase of benefits in excess of the amount provided by 
the plan, determined on the basis of actuarial value, or 

require  the  payment  to  an  alternate  payee  of  benefits  that  are 
required  to  be  paid  to  another  alternate  payee  under  a  previous 
QDRO. 

Depending  on  the  type  of  retirement  plan,  there  may  be  several  other 
requirements  or  items  which  should  be  covered  by  the  agreement  and  order.  
Because  retirement  plans  vary,  contact  the  administrator  of  your  plan  to  make 
sure all the required information is included in your agreement. 

In order to write an agreement which will be enforceable, you will most likely need 
to consult with an attorney who is familiar with the laws about QDRO's.  You may 
also  be  able  to  get  assistance  from  the  administrator  of  the  retirement  plan.  
Remember that your agreement is not effective until it and the decree are filed 
with that administrator and you have received notice that it is accepted.  If it is 
not  accepted,  you  will  have  to  go  back  to  court  to  get  an  order  correcting  any 
defects. 

f you are submitting a proposed QDRO, or any similar order requiring 
the social security numbers of the beneficiary and alternate payee, you 
must also submit a copy of the original proposed order with the social

INSTRUCTIONS – DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE FOR SPOUSES (NO MINOR CHILDREN) 

Describe all debts of both parties.  Debts include all kinds of financial obligations, such as 
loans, credit card, bank card, or debit card balances, the mortgage on your house, etc. 

ist  to  whom  each  debt  is  owed  and  the  amount  owed.   When  identifying  credit  card, 
bank card or debit card account balances, you may list the last 4 digits of the account and 
the name of the issuing institution.  Do not provide full account numbers.  Check the box 
showing whether the debt was incurred during the marriage and the box showing who 
owes the debt (Party A, Party B, or jointly owed).  Then check the box showing who you 
agree will be responsible for paying the debt. 
 
Each spouse is responsible for his or her separate debts unless you agree otherwise.   

The two of you may agree which spouse will pay each joint debt (debt in both parties' 
names).  However, although this agreement will be binding against the two of you, it will 
not  be  binding  against  the  people  to  whom  the  debts  are  owed  because  they  are  not 
parties  in  this  case.    For  joint  debts,  both  of  you  will  remain  legally  obligated  to  your 
creditors until the existing debt is paid, regardless of your agreement as to who will pay 
the debt.   

n addition, if both your names are on a mortgage or other debt, you may not be able to 
get new loans or credit.  You may want to consider refinancing these debts to put them 
only in the name of the party responsible for paying them. 

To protect yourselves against future debts the other party may incur on credit cards and 
other  open  accounts,  you  may  want  to  close  your  current  joint  charge  accounts  and 
reopen them in your separate names.

ection IV.  SPOUSAL MAINTENANCE (ALIMONY)  (Page 7) 

Petitioners  may  agree  to  the  payment  of  spousal  maintenance  (alimony).    Spousal 
maintenance  payments  must  be  included  as  income  on  the  tax  return  of  the  spouse 
receiving the payments.  Advice from an accountant or attorney may be helpful in regard 
to other tax consequences of spousal maintenance. 

Spousal  maintenance  payments  may be  for  a  limited or  indefinite  period  of  time.  The 
agreement  on  spousal  maintenance  must  fairly  allocate  the  economic  effect  of  the 
dissolution.  It must take into consideration the following factors listed in Alaska Statute 
25.24.160(a)(2): 

1. 
2.

the length of the marriage and station in life of the parties during the marriage; 
the age and health of the parties; 
the  earning  capacity  of  the  parties,  including  their  educational  backgrounds, 
training,  employment  skills,  work  experiences,  length  of  absence  from  the  job 
market, and custodial responsibilities for children during the marriage; 
the financial condition of the parties, including the availability and cost of health 
insurance; 
the  conduct  of  the  parties,  including  whether  there  has  been  unreasonable 
depletion of marital assets; 
the division of property; and 
other factors the court determines to be relevant in each individual case.

f  you  want  a  prior  name  restored  (to  go  back  to  a  name  you  had  before),  check  the 
appropriate box for yourself (Party A or Party B) and fill in the blanks for your current and 
former names.  You may also want to follow steps #2, #9, #10, #11, and #12 below.   
  
You must also fill out Notice of Request to Restore Name in Dissolution or Divorce Case 
(form DR-957) if you are one or more of the following: 

•  currently charged with a crime,  
•  currently incarcerated (for example, in jail, in prison, or at a halfway house), 
•  on supervised felony probation or on parole for a criminal conviction, or  
• 

required to register as a sex offender or child kidnapper under AS 12.63.010.  

The court may order you to do additional notice of your name restoration if you fall into 
one  of  these  categories.    Read  the  court’s  order  carefully.    You  must  complete  any 
additional  notice  by  the  date  of  your  dissolution  hearing  or  your  dissolution  could  be 
delayed.  You can use Affidavit of Additional Service (form CIV-702) to provide proof to 
the court that you completed this requirement.  You may file this before the hearing or 
bring it to the hearing. 

New Name 

f you are requesting a name that was not a name you had before the marriage, there 
may be additional costs and your dissolution hearing will be delayed.   Additionally, the 
judge may find that a new name change is not authorized in certain situations as part of 
a  dissolution  case.    For  these  reasons,  it  may  be  easier  to  do  the  name  change  in  a 
separate case by filing Petition for Change of Name (form CIV-700).  If you do decide to 
do it as part of your dissolution hearing, take the following steps: 

Check the box requesting a new name and fill out Request to Change to New Name 
in Dissolution Case (form DR-955).   

Ask the court for form VS-405, Application for Legal Name Change.  Fill out the 
form (please type the information if possible) and return it to the court, together 
with form DR-955, when you file your dissolution petition. 

Tell the clerk your petition includes a request for name change and that you need 
an order for posting. 

If the court finds that the name change is legally allowed as part of the dissolution 
case, the court will send you an Order for Hearing, Posting, and Additional Service 
(form CIV-701).  This order will tell you the time and place of the hearing on your 
name change.  It will also tell you whether you must provide additional service.  If 
the order requires additional service, follow the instructions on the order.

Section V.  CHANGE OR RESTORE NAME (Page 7) 
 

Either spouse may ask to restore (return to) a prior name, that is, a name that you had 
before the marriage.  Either spouse may ask that a new name be authorized, however, 
there may be additional legal requirements and the court will have to approve this request.

Unless waived by written court order, the clerk will automatically post the proposed 
name change and the date of the hearing to the Alaska Court System’s Legal Notice 
Website for four consecutive weeks.  After posting is completed, the clerk will file 
the Clerk’s Certificate of Service of Posting (form TF-815) to the website.  

If you are also required to serve additional notice, you must file proof that you 
did so.  Use Affidavit of Additional Service (form CIV-702).  File it with the court 
before the hearing or bring it to the hearing. 

The hearing is usually short and fairly informal.  It will usually be combined with 
your dissolution hearing.  You must tell the judge why you want to change your 
name and assure the judge that you are not seeking to change your name in order 
to  avoid  debts  or  defraud  anyone.    If  the  judge  finds  there  is  no  reasonable 
objection to the change and that it is consistent with the public interest, the judge 
will sign a judgment allowing you to take the new name.  However, you cannot 
begin using the new name yet, because the judgment will not be effective until 
the following steps are completed. 

The court will automatically post notice on the Alaska Court System’s legal notice 
website for one week unless waived by the court in a written order.  Following the 
posting, the clerk will file the Clerk’s Certificate of Service of Posting (form TF-815) 
to the website. 

If  the  judgment  requires  additional  service,  follow  the  judgment’s  instructions.  
After additional service is complete, fill out an Affidavit of Additional Service (form 
CIV-702) and file it with the court.  The clerk will then issue a Certificate of Name 
Change (form CIV-705).  You can begin using your new name on the date stated 
in  the  certificate.    This  date  will  be  at  least  30  days  after  the  judgment  was 
distributed.  The clerk will give you two copies of the certificate.  One will be a free 
certified copy.  If you need additional certified copies, there will be a charge for 
them.  Current fees are listed in Administrative Rule 9. 

If you have an Alaska driver's license, or you own a vehicle registered in Alaska, 
you  must  send  written  notice  of  your  name  change  to  the  Division  of  Motor 
Vehicles within 30 days.  AS 28.05.071.  To get a new driver's license, you will 
need  to  go  to  a  DMV  office  and  present  a  copy  of  the  Certificate  of  Name 
Change (form CIV-705). 

Notify  the  Social  Security  Administration  of  your  name  change  to  avoid  tax 
problems and help assure proper employment credit.  Toll-free telephone number: 
1-800-772-1213. 

Individuals required to register on the Sex Offender and Child Kidnapper Registry 
per AS 12.63.010 must notify  the Department of Public Safety about any  name 
change  (including  restoring  a  prior  name)  within  one  business  day  after 
receiving  the  Certificate  of  Name  Change  (form  CIV-705).    Use  Notification  of 
Petition/Proof  of  Legal  Name  Change  (form  12-299-74).    This  form  is  available 
from law enforcement or online at https://sor.dps.alaska.gov/Home/Documents. 

If you want a new birth certificate, contact the Vital Records office of the state in 
which you were born and pay the required fee.

Use  this  space  to  write  any  other  agreements  between  you.    For  example,  you  might 
agree that one spouse will maintain a life insurance policy which names the other spouse 
as beneficiary. 

All your agreements with each other about the dissolution must be written in the petition.  
When you sign the last page of the petition, you will be stating under oath that the petition 
contains all your agreements. 

AGREEMENTS NOT INCLUDED IN THE PETITION ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE. 

If you agree to something but do not write it down in your petition, it will not be included 
in the court's decree of dissolution; and you will, therefore, not be able to enforce that 
agreement. 

ection VII.  SIGNATURES AND VERIFICATIONS (page 8) 

Both petitioners must  sign each page of the petition.  The signatures on the last  page 
must  be  signed  under  oath  before  a  notary  public,  a  court  clerk  or  any  other  person 
authorized to administer oaths.  Please keep in mind that, in signing the petition under 
oath, you are swearing that every statement you have made in your petition is the truth.
