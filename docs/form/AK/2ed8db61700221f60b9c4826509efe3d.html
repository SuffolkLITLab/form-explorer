HOW TO SERVE A SUMMONS 

WHAT IS A SUMMONS? 
 
A  summons  is  a  court  order  that  notifies  a  defendant  that  a  lawsuit  has  been  filed 
against  him  or  her  and  that  the  defendant  must  file  an  answer  within  a  specified 
number of days.  The procedure for issuing and serving a summons is governed by Civil 
Rule 4. 

hen  a  lawsuit  is  filed,  the  clerk  of  court  must  issue  a  summons  to  each  defendant 
named  in  the  complaint.    You  can  download  and  fill  out  the  CIV-100,  Summons  and 
Notice  to  Both  Parties  of  Judicial  Assignment  here:  http://www.courts.alaska.gov/
forms/index.htm#civ.  You may have to pay the court to make copies of this form after 
the clerk signs it. 

he plaintiff must then have each defendant “served” with the summons and a copy of 
the  complaint.    The  defendants  must  be  served  within  120  days  from  the  date  the 
complaint  is  filed.1    The  plaintiff  is  also  required  to  file  a  Civil  Rule  4(f)  Affidavit 
identifying  the  parties  who  have  been  served  and  any  parties  who  have  not  been 
served.  Both  plaintiffs  and  defendants  must  keep  the  court  and  all  other  parties 
informed of any changes in their mailing addresses and telephone numbers. 

Served” means to have these documents given to the defendant by a process server, 
certified mail or in another way allowed by Civil Rule 4.   

These  methods  of  services  are  explained  below.    See  page  14    for  information  about 
how to serve a defendant who is outside this state. 

PERSONAL SERVICE BY PROCESS SERVER 

A  “process  server”  is  a  person  licensed  by  the  State  of  Alaska  to  serve 
“process”.  “Process”  means  court  orders  such  as  summonses,  writs  of 
execution,  and  other  types  of  documents  required  to  be  served  by  personal 
service.   

f you want to use a process server, you must: 

Choose  a  process  server.    The  court  clerk  will  have  a  list  of  process 
servers in your area.  You can also find a list of licensed process servers 
on  the  following  Department  of  Public  Safety  (Alaska  State  Troopers) 
https://dps.alaska.gov/Statewide/R-I/PermitsLicensing/Home, 
website: 
then click on “Civilian Process Server List.”  Many parts of the state do not 
have  process  servers.    In  those  areas,  "process"  is  served  by  peace 
officers (usually by State Troopers).

CIV-106 (4/21) 
HOW TO SERVE A SUMMONS 

1 

If the process server is not in your community, you must give the court an 
envelope  addressed  to  the  process  server  with  sufficient  postage  so  the 
clerk can mail the documents to the process server. 

Contact  the  process  server  to  determine  the  service  fee.    Pay  the  fee 
directly  to  the  process  server  unless  the  process  server  is  not  in  your 
community.  In that case, make your check payable to the process server 
but give it to the clerk to mail with the summons. 

Fees  are  set  by  the  individual  process  server.    However,  the  maximum 
amount  you  may  recover  as  costs  from  the  defendant  is  governed  by 
Administrative  Rule  11.    The  current  amount  recoverable  is  $45.00  for 
each person on whom service is made plus a minimum of $20.00 for the 
first  25  miles  or  portion  thereof  traveled.    Additional  amounts  may  be 
recovered for extra mileage or extra time spent serving the documents. 

Fill out Service Instructions.  Use either the process server's form or court 
form  CIV-615,  Service Instructions.    Explain  in  the  Service Instructions 
what papers are to be served and where they are to be served. 

Give the process server the following: 
(1)  Service Instructions   
The service fee  
(2) 
The summons  
(3) 
A copy of the complaint 
(4) 

Proof of Service.  When service is completed, the process server must give 
you proof of service.   This proof is called a  “Return of Service.”2  It is  a 
notarized  document  that  states  who  was  served  with  the  summons  and 
complaint and when and how they were served. If you have any questions 
about the service, contact your process server. 

IMPORTANT:  You do not need to file the Return of Service with the court 
at this time.  Be sure to keep this document safe because you will need to 
file it with the court if the defendant does not respond to the summons. 

Once service is completed, read Section  4  on page  12  for instructions 
on how to prepare the required Civil Rule 4(f) Affidavit.

The purpose of my inquiry was to give the defendant notice of the action in order that 
the defendant may appear and defend it. 

I  believe  other  methods  of  service  may  be  more  likely  to  give  the  absent  party  notice 
(publication in a print or online newspaper, e-mail, posting on the absent party’s social 
network  account,  physically  posting  on  the  front  door  of  an  absent  party’s  place  of

Answer:  If you are unable to serve the defendant by process server or by 
certified mail, see Section 3 on page  6  on Service by Posting.  This type 
of service can be used if you are unable to locate the defendant or unable 
to serve the defendant through regular process. 

b. 

What if defendant is out of state? 

Answer:  A defendant may be served outside the state of Alaska by either: 

Certified mail, return receipt requested (see Section 2), or 

Personal service by process server (see Section 1).  However, this 
type  of  service  must  be  made  by  a  peace  officer  or  a  licensed 
process server in that state. 5  To locate a peace officer or process 
server  in  another  state,  contact  your  local  troopers  or  call  the 
troopers’ Judicial Services office in Anchorage at (907) 264-0699. 

In  addition,  if  the  law  suit  involves  title  to  or  a  lien  on  real  or  personal 
property  within  Alaska,  service  must  also  be  made  upon  the  person  or 
persons in possession or in charge of such property.6 

What if defendant is outside the United States? 

Answer:   Serving a person outside the United States can be difficult.  You 
may  wish  to  contact  an  attorney  for  help.    You  may  serve  a  defendant 
outside  the  United  States  by  following  Civil  Rule  4(d)(13).    Information 
about the process is available at:

Owner/Operator of Motor Vehicle Who is Not in Alaska. 

If your lawsuit involves a motor vehicle accident in  Alaska and the defendant is 
the owner or operator of the vehicle and if the defendant is now outside Alaska, 
Alaska Statutes 09.05.020 - .040 describe how to serve the defendant. 

Step 1 - Serve the Commissioner.  The complaint must list the owner/operator’s 
name as defendant, but the summons must be addressed to both the defendant 
and the Commissioner of the Department of Administration. 

Example: 
To Defendant: JACK E. SMITH, operator of motor vehicle and not in 
Alaska, through the Commissioner of Administration. 

 

Step 2 – Mail Notice to Defendant.  Within 10 days after the date of service on 
the  Commissioner,  send  to  the  defendant,  by  certified  mail,  a  copy  of  the 
summons and complaint  and  a notice that explains to defendant that service is 
being made on the Commissioner as authorized by statute.   If the defendant is 
outside the United States, refer to Section 5 c. on page  14   of this booklet for 
more information. 

tep 3 – File Proof with Court. Then file an affidavit with the court describing the 
service and attaching copies of the documents and the post office receipt.  See 
AS 09.05.020(d). 

 S

company) or bank plus the number of the bond or CD (certificate of deposit) or 
savings account.  Also include in the caption (after the bond number) the name 
of  the  contractor  for  whom  the  bond  was  issued  and  the  contractor's  license

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
