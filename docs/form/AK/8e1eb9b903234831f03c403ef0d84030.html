INSTRUCTIONS FOR RESPONDING TO AN APPEAL 
FROM THE DISTRICT COURT TO THE SUPERIOR COURT1 

These instructions explain what to do if someone else files an appeal in a case you are involved 
You may also want to read the “Appellant Instructions” (form AP-200) for more information 
 
 
.
n
i

about what the appellant must do in order to file the appeal. 

Appellate Rules 601-612 govern appeals to the superior 
court.  Appeals are complicated, and you may want to 
talk to a lawyer if someone files an appeal in your case. 

APPEAL.    In  general,  an  appeal  is  when  a  higher  court  reviews  a  lower  court's 
final decision or judgment.  These instructions are specific to when the superior 
court reviews the decision or judgment of the district court.  An appeal is not 
a  new  trial.    You  cannot  present  any  new  evidence  to  the  superior  court.    The 
only information that the superior court will consider on appeal is: 

1. 
 
2. 
 
3. 
4. 

the  electronic  recording  of  the  district  court  trial  or  hearing,  including 
witness testimony; 
any exhibits (documents, photographs, videos, or physical items)  offered 
as evidence in the district court; 
the documents in the court file; and 
legal briefs and memoranda filed in the appeal.2 

B. 

C. 

APPELLANT.  The appellant is the party who files the appeal. 

APPELLEE.  The appellee is the party who defends against the appeal. 

I. 

HOW THE APPEAL BEGINS 

A. 

Notice of Appeal. 

To start the appeal, the  appellant  had  to  file a notice of appeal with the court.  
You do not have to file a response to the notice at this time.  Your opportunity to 
respond  will  occur  later  when  the  appellant  files  a  legal  brief  or  memorandum 
and serves it on you (see section V). 

B. 

Other Requests. 

The  appellant  sometimes  makes  other  requests  that  you  may  want  to  respond 
to.  The appellant must serve you with a copy of any request.3   

DEFINITIONS 

A.

1   District  court  cases  that  may  be  appealed  to  the  superior  court  include  formal  civil  cases,  small 
claims, traffic and other minor offenses, criminal cases on the “merits”, and some criminal sentences. 

2   See section V of these instructions for more information on legal briefs and memoranda. 
3  

“Service” is a legal term that means the other party must give you a copy of everything filed in court 
during the appeal.  Service can be by hand-delivery or mail.  If you agree to it, you can also be 
served by email or fax. 

AP-205 (4/22) 

1 

Some  common  requests  that  the  appellant  may  make  at  the  same  time  the 
appellant files the notice of appeal are: 

Request to Accept Late-Filed Appeal.  The appellant must file a notice of 
appeal  within  30  days  after  the  district  court  judgment  is  distributed.  
After this deadline, the appellant  must file a request  asking the court to 
accept a late-filed notice of appeal. 

Request to Waive Filing Fee.  The appellant may file a request asking the 
court to waive the filing fee for the appeal because the appellant cannot 
afford to pay it. 

Motion  to  Waive  or  Reduce  Cost  Bond.    In  civil  cases  and  small  claims 
cases, before an appeal will be accepted, the appellant must also file one 
of the following: 

•  a $750 cost bond 
•  a motion to waive or reduce cost bond 
•  a supersedeas bond (discussed in paragraph 4 below) 
The  purpose  of  a  cost  bond  is  to  make  sure  your  costs  to  defend  the 
appeal will be reimbursed by the appellant if the appeal is dismissed or if 
the  appellant  loses  the  appeal.    The  appellant  may,  however,  ask  the 
court to waive or reduce the amount of the cost bond.   

Request  for  Approval  of  Supersedeas  Bond.    If  the  appellant  files  a 
supersedeas bond, it will stop any writs of execution from being issued to 
collect  the  district  court  judgment  while  the  appeal  is  pending.    Filing  a 
cost  bond  will  not  stop  execution,  only  an  approved  supersedeas  bond 
will.  A supersedeas bond is 125% of the amount of the judgment, which 
is  designed  to  make  sure  that  not  only  your  appeal  costs,  but  also  the 
amount  of  the  judgment,  will  be  reimbursed  or  paid  by  the  appellant  if 
the appellant loses the appeal (or if the appeal is dismissed).   

If the appellant wants to file a supersedeas bond, the appellant must file 
a request for approval of the bond.  The appellant must serve you with a 
copy  of  the  request  and  proof  that  the  bond  was  deposited.    The  court 
will  not  wait  for  your  response  before  deciding  whether  to  approve  the 
bond.  Even if a bond is approved, you may still file an objection to the 
bond, and the court will reconsider the approval.  You may use Request 
and Order (form AP-135) to file your objection. 

5. 

Motion  to  Waive  or  Reduce  Supersedeas  Bond.    If  the  appellant  thinks 
125%  of  the  judgment  is  too  high,  or  if  the  appellant  cannot  afford  to 
post 125% of the judgment, the appellant may file a request to waive or 
reduce the supersedeas bond. 

See section IX about the return of any bonds after the appeal is over. 

You  are  not  required  to  respond  to  any  requests  or  motions  filed  by  the 
appellant,  especially  if  you  do  not oppose  them.    However,  if  you  do  oppose  a 
request, you must file a written response if you want the court to consider your 
opposition.

If  the  appellant’s  request  (or  motion)  was  mailed  to  you,  you  must  file  a 
response within 10 days after the date it was mailed.  If the appellant’s request 
was hand-delivered, emailed, or faxed to you, you must file a response within 7 
days after you received it.4  You may use Response to Request (form AP-140) to 
file your opposition.  The court will notify you of its decision on any request(s). 

II.  COPIES TO OTHER PARTIES 

The court rules require each party to  give a copy  of any document that the party  files 
with the court to all other parties.5  You can give the copies to the other party by hand-
delivering or mailing the documents.  You can also email or fax a copy if the other party 
agreed  to  this  type  of  service.    For  every  document  that  you  file,  you  must  include  a 
signed  statement  that  you  gave  a  copy  to  the  other  parties.    This  is  called  “proof  of 
service.”    The  court  forms  include  a  certificate of  service  section.   Make  sure  that  you 
always complete this section before you file the form with the court.  If another party is 
represented by an attorney, you must serve the attorney instead of the party. 

V.   ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGE 

The court will notify you of the name of the judge assigned to hear the appeal.  You 
have the right to a “peremptory challenge” (to ask for a different judge) one time only, 
without giving a reason.  If you do this, you will be randomly assigned a different 
superior court judge to hear the appeal.  Use Notice of Change of Judge (form TF-935).  
You must file this notice within five days of being notified of the assigned judge.   

BRIEFING SCHEDULE 

. 

  V

  I

  I

A “legal brief” is a document that you write to explain your side of the case to the judge.  
In  an  appeal  to  the  superior  court  from  the  district  court,  you  may  file  a  “legal 
memorandum”  instead,  which  is  less  formal  than  a  brief.    When  the  case  is  ready  for 
briefing,  the  court  will  send  you  and  the  appellant  Notice Setting Appeal Procedure 
(form  AP-305).    This  notice  will  tell  you  the  time  schedule  for  filing  legal  memoranda 
and requesting oral argument.   

You are not required to file your own (appellee) memorandum or brief.  However, if you 
do  not  file one,  the  judge  will  not  have  the benefit  of  reading  your  explanation  of  the 
case,  and  it  is  possible  that  you  will  not  be  allowed  to  speak  at  oral  argument  (see 
section VI).  This may make it more likely that the appellant will win the appeal.  If you 
can’t  file  your  memorandum  or  brief  within  the  time  limit  set  in  the  notice  from  the 
court, file Request and Order (form AP-135) asking the court for more time.   

If you want to file a formal brief, see Appellate Rules 212(c) and 513.5 for details about 
format and content.  The rules for briefs are complicated and are not explained in detail 
in these instructions.

If you choose to file the less formal memorandum, it must include:6 

a. 
b. 
c. 
d. 

a statement of the issues you want the court to review  
a summary of the facts of the case  
a discussion of the law and its application to the facts 
a short conclusion explaining what you want the court to order 

Your memorandum must be typed or written (using black ink), double-spaced on 8.5’’ x 
11" white paper.  Number all of the pages except for the cover.  Only type or write on 
one side of each page.  Your memorandum must be no longer than 20 pages.  Appellee 
Memorandum  Cover  Sheet  (form  AP-161)  may  be  used  as  the  cover  of  your 
memorandum.    It  is  available  as  a  fillable  form  online.    It  is  also  included  as  the  last 
page of these instructions, which you may detach and fill out by hand.  

For  a  complete  description  of  the  requirements  for  your  memorandum,  including  rules 
about fonts and margins, see Appellate Rules 513.5 and 605(b).  

To  help  you  prepare  your  memorandum,  you  may  want  to  listen  to  an  electronic 
recording  of  the  district  court  proceedings.    You  can  get  a  copy  of  the  electronic 
recording  by 
(see 
http://courts.alaska.gov/trialcourts/index.htm#recs  for  more  information).    You  must 
pay  $20  per  electronic  recording.7    You  should  make  this  request  as soon  as  possible, 
because it may take several days for the court to prepare your recording.

court 

Send a copy of your memorandum (or brief) to the appellant.  You must show proof that 
you  did  this  by  filling  out  and  filing  a  certificate  of  service.    This  certificate  is  already 
included on the sample memorandum cover (form AP-161). 

I.  ORAL ARGUMENT 

“Oral argument” is when you explain your side of the case to the appellate judge and try 
to persuade the judge why  you should get what  you are asking for.   Oral argument  is 
not  a  new  trial  or  a  chance  to  present  more  evidence.    You  cannot  call  witnesses  to 
testify.    You  are  limited  to  explaining  in  more  detail  the  arguments  you  made  in  your 
legal memorandum (or brief).  Sometimes, the judge will ask you questions about what 
you say during oral argument or what you wrote in your memorandum.  Each side gets 
15 minutes to speak, unless otherwise ordered.   

If  you  do  not  file  a  legal  memorandum  or  brief,  you  will  not  be  allowed  to 
present  any  arguments  at  oral  argument,  unless  the  appellant  consents  or  the 
judge asks to hear your argument.8 

The deadline to request oral argument is: 

(1) 

(2) 

If you file a brief or memorandum, then within 10 days after the date the 
appellant’s reply memorandum is due; or 
If you do not file a brief or memorandum, then within 10 days after the 
due date for you to file one expired.

8   Appellate Rule 212(c)(10). 
AP-205 (4/22) 

4 

In  the  following  cases,  oral  argument  is  only  allowed  only  if  the  superior  court  judge 
decides there is a good reason to have it: 

a. 

b. 

appeals  from  a  civil  or  small  claims  matter  where  the  controversy  on 
appeal concerns less than $300. 
appeals from a minor offense as defined by Minor Offense Rule 2.  

In these cases, you may file Request and Order (form AP-135) to ask for oral argument.  
You must include an explanation of why oral argument is necessary. The court will notify 
you whether your request is granted or denied. 

In all other types of appeals, as long as at least one party makes a timely request, the 
court  will  automatically  schedule  oral  argument.    The  request  must  be  in  writing,  but 
does  not  need  to  explain  why  oral  argument  is necessary.    You  may  use Request and 
Order  (form  AP-135)  to  ask  for  oral  argument.    If  the  appellant  timely  requests  oral 
argument, you may not object to the request.9 

If  your  request  for  oral  argument  is  filed  after  the  deadline,  you  must  also  include  a 
request for the court to accept your late filing.  You may use Request and Order (form 
AP-135) to both ask for the oral argument to be scheduled, and to explain why the court 
should accept your late request. 

If you file a request  for  oral argument, you must  serve a copy of your request  on the 
appellant.  Make sure to fill out the certificate of service showing that you did this. 

The superior court will decide the appeal based on the record, the briefs or memoranda 
submitted, and oral arguments (if held).  The court will send you a copy of the decision.  
The decision may: 

•  affirm (agree with) the district court, 
• 
• 
•  dismiss the appeal. 

remand (send the case back for additional action by the district court), 
reverse the decision made by the district court, or 

There may also be a combination of these results if there are multiple issues on appeal.   

 

VIII.  ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS 

In  civil  appeals,  Appellate  Rule  508  determines  who  may  apply  for  costs  and  attorney 
fees  at  the  end  of  the  appeal.    Generally,  you  (the  appellee)  may  apply  for  costs  and 
attorney fees if the district court’s decision or judgment is affirmed.10 

Costs.    The  clerk  will  send  the  parties  Notice Re Costs and Attorney Fees on Appeal 
(form AP-333) along with a copy of the appeal decision.  If you won the appeal, and you 
want  to  recover your  costs,  file  a verified11  and  itemized  bill of  costs  within 10  days 
after the date shown in the clerk's certificate of distribution on the appeal decision.  If 
the decision was mailed to you, you have an additional three calendar days to file your 
bill of costs.   

 
9  Appellate Rule 605.5. 
10   If the judgment is reversed, then the appellant may ask the court to award costs and attorney fees 

 

against you.  If the judgment is remanded, or if only some parts were reversed or affirmed, then the 
superior court will have to decide which side, if any, is awarded costs and fees. 

11   “Verified” means your cost bill must include a statement signed by a court clerk or notary public that 
you have sworn or affirmed that the information in the cost bill is true.  See Alaska Statute 09.63.030 
for the wording of a verification. 

AP-205 (4/22)

II.  DECISION 

 V

The only costs you may ask for are: 

1. 
 
2. 

the cost of preparing  the  transcripts  or electronic recordings  and  paying 
the transcriber 
the cost of copying and mailing memoranda or briefs 

You must serve a copy of your bill of costs on the appellant, who has seven days to file 
objections.  The clerk will then decide what costs to award and send both parties a copy 
of the decision. 

Attorney Fees.  File a request for attorney fees within 10 days after the date shown in 
the clerk’s certificate of distribution on the appeal decision.  You may use Request and 
Order (form AP-135) to do this.  Be sure to attach a detailed invoice showing your actual 
attorney fees.  Non-attorneys cannot request attorney fees for representing themselves.  
Include an explanation of why you are allowed to recover attorney fees under Appellate 
Rule 508(e).    Send a copy of the request  to the appellant, who has  seven  days to file 
objections.    The  court  will  send  you  a  copy  of  the  judge's  written  decision  on  the 
request.   

Collecting Costs and Attorney Fees.  If you win an award of costs or attorney fees and 
the appellant does not pay voluntarily, you may ask the court to apply any cost bond or 
supersedeas  bond  (posted  by  the  appellant  at  the  beginning  of  the  appeal)  to  the 
amount owed you.  See section IX of these instructions.  You may also ask the clerk for 
a writ of execution to collect from the appellant the amount owed to you. 

After the appeal is decided, the court will send you and the appellant a notice that the 
appellant's  bond  will  be  released  unless  there  is  an  objection.    If  you  win  the  appeal, 
you may file an objection and request that the bond be applied to your costs and/or to 
the judgment.  This request must be filed by the date stated in the notice the court will 
send to you.  You may use Request and Order (form AP-135) to do this. 

The appellant may have satisfied the bond requirement by filing either a surety bond or 
a cash deposit.   

•  Cash  was  Deposited.    If  the  court  orders  the  cash  deposit  applied  to  pay  your 

judgment and/or appeal costs, the court will issue you a check. 

•  Surety Bond was Posted.  If the court grants your request to apply the bond to 
your judgment and/or appeal costs, you are responsible for getting the proceeds 
of the surety bond from the surety.  No court forms are available for this action.  
You may need to contact an attorney for further assistance. 

If you do not file an objection (or request to use the bond for costs), then the bond will 
be released and any cash deposit returned to the appellant.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
