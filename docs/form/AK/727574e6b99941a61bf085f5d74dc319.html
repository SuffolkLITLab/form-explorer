Guardianship and Conservatorship 

 guardian is a person appointed by the court to protect  the rights and manage the 
affairs of an incapacitated person or a minor.  The individual being cared for is  legally 
called the ward, however many groups and courts are moving away from this term and 
simply referring to them as the person in the guardianship, or the protected person.  
A conservator is a person appointed by the court to manage the financial affairs of a 
person  who  needs  this  protection  because  the  protected  person  cannot  handle  these 
matters alone.  The procedure for getting a conservator appointed is similar to, but not 
the same as, the procedure for getting a guardian appointed. 

he court order appointing the guardian will specify whether a full or partial guardian, 
or  just  a  conservator,  is  being  appointed  and  describe  the  powers  and  duties.    This 
booklet discusses the duties of a full guardian (which includes conservatorship duties).  
If you are a partial guardian, or a conservator only, you can read over the areas below 
that you have been given authority over. 

a. 

Non-Professional Guardians. 

Required Training 

. 

  1

If the guardian or conservator is not engaged in the business of providing 
guardian  or  conservatorship  services,  the  guardian  or  conservator  must 
complete  one  hour  of  mandatory  education  on  the  basics  of 
guardianship  and  conservatorship  and  file  proof  of  completion  with  the 
court  within  30  days  after  the  appointment  order  is  distributed.1    The 
guardian  should  fill  out  the form  explaining  what  the  guardian  did  to 
satisfy the education requirement and file it with the court.  See page 16. 

Unless  the  court  directs  otherwise,  the  one-hour  education  requirement 
can be satisfied by completing at least one of the following: 

reading  this  booklet  about  the  duties  of  a  guardian  and 
conservator; 

completing the online course “Guardianship and Conservatorship” 
produced by the Alaska Court System, available at most courts and 
online at https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/guardian-
conservator/index.htm (scroll down to Part 3); or 

attending the Zoom class “Fundamentals of Adult Guardianship and 
Conservatorship” by the Alaska Court System.  Register for this

Powers and Duties of Guardians and Conservators 

ersons (including companies and other organizations) who engage in the 
business  of  providing  guardian  services  must  be  licensed  by  the 
Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development.2 

 

b. 

Professional Guardians. 

  P

laska  has  adopted  the  National  Guardianship  Association  Standards  of  Practice  and 
some are referenced in this document.  The standards provide a framework for the best 
practices  when  acting  as  a  guardian  or  conservator.    You  can  find  the  standards  at 
www.guardianship.org or www.asaga.info.   

Required Reports to the Court. (All these forms are available on the court website:  
https://courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm.  Court addresses are available at 
https://courts.alaska.gov/courtdir/index.htm#trial.) 

a. 

b. 

 

 

c. 

Change of Contact Information.  Any time the protected person or the 
guardian/conservator  changes  address,  email,  or  telephone  number,  the 
guardian/conservator  must  immediately  send  written  notice  to  the  court 
and all parties in the case.3  You can use form PG-195, Notice of Change 
Contact Information, on page 17. 
 
f
o

Include your case number whenever you write to the court about 
your case.  

Guardianship  Plan.    Within  30  days  after  the  guardian’s  appointment 
order  is  distributed  by  the  court,  the  guardian  must  give  the  court  a 
Guardianship Plan (use form PG-401).4  If you are a conservator only, you 
do not need to file a conservator plan. 

The Guardianship Plan must describe the guardian’s plans for caring for the 
person in the guardianship.  The Plan must be designed to encourage the 
protected  person  to  participate  in  all  decisions  affecting  the  protected 
person  to  the  maximum  extent  possible.    The  Plan  may  not  restrict  the 
person’s liberty more than is reasonably necessary to protect the person and 
to provide for the person’s needs.5  

An  Implementation  Report  and  Inventory  must  be  filed  with  the 
court  within  90  days  after  distribution  of  the  court’s  appointment  order.6  
Guardians  should  use  form  PG-205.    Conservators  should  use  form  PG-
220.

The  purpose  of  this  report  is  to  give  the  court  as  complete  a  picture  as 
possible of the protected person’s current situation and what the guardian 
or conservator is going to do to implement the plan.  It also includes a full 
inventory of income, expenses, assets, and liabilities. 

Annual  Reports must  be  filed  each  year  until  the  guardianship  or 
conservatorship is terminated (use form PG-210 if you are a guardian, and 
form PG-225 if you are only a conservator).  If you are a partial guardian, 
use form PG-210 and indicate the areas you have authority for.  If you are 
both  guardian  and  conservator,  you  only  need  to  fill  out  form  PG-210.  
The  annual  report  describes  to  the  court  what  has  happened  to  the 
protected  person  and  the  protected  person’s  income  and  assets  in  the 
past 12 months. 

Unless  different  dates  are  set  in  the  appointment  order,  the  report  must 
cover  the  12-month  period  beginning  the  1st  of  the  month  in  which  the 
appointment order is signed and ending 12 months later.  This 12-month 
period is called “the reporting period.”  The report is due 30 days after the 
end of the reporting period.  [For example, if the order is signed anytime 
i
 January, the reporting period will be January 1 to December 31; and a 
n
report will be due each January 31.] 7 

e. 

A  Final  Report  must  be  filed  when  the  guardianship  or  conservatorship 
ends or the guardian or conservator is replaced.8  Use form PG-215 if you 
are  a  full  or  partial  guardian;  use  form  PG-230  if  you  are  a  conservator 
only. 

Duties to the Person in the Guardianship and Conservatorship 

A full guardian has nearly the same powers and duties to the protected person as a 
parent  does  to  a  minor  child.    However,  the  guardian  does  not  have  to  use  the 
guardian’s own funds to pay for the care and maintenance of the protected person, 
and the guardian is not personally liable for harm done by the protected person. 

wo  statutes  that  describe  these  powers  and  duties  (AS  13.26.316  and  AS 

13.26.266(b) and (c)) are printed on pages 12-14 of this booklet. 

lthough you have the authority to make decisions regarding the protected 
person’s  care,  it  is  best  practice  to  discuss  all  such  decisions  with  the 
protected  person  to  determine  the  person’s  wishes.    In  addition,  other 
advocates for the protected person may be helpful when making decisions 
to determine the person’s wishes.9

Powers and Duties of Guardians and Conservators 

 

The  powers  and  duties  of  a  full  guardian  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the 
following:  
 
a. 

Housing.  The guardian must decide where the protected person will live.  
In  doing  this,  the  guardian  must  consider  the  wishes  of  the 
protected  person  and  the  desirability  of  allowing  the  protected 
person to keep ties with the local community.  

n  the  guardian’s  appointment  order,  the  court  may  limit  the  guardian’s 
authority  to  move  the  protected  person  from  the  protected  person’s 
current home without court permission. 

In  order  to  allow  the  protected  person  to  remain  in  the  protected 
person’s  home  as  long  as  possible,  you  may  need  to  investigate 
available  services  to  help  the  protected  person  –  services  such  as 
providing  meals,  housekeeping,  running  errands,  adult  daycare, 
periodic nursing care,  ways the  protected person can contact  help 
in case of a fall or other emergency, etc.  

he guardian must choose the least restrictive setting that can satisfy the 

need to protect the protected person. 

he  guardian  cannot  place  the  protected  person  in  a  facility  or  institution 
for the mentally ill except by filing a formal commitment proceeding under 
AS 47.30. 
 

You must allow the protected person to participate in the decision-
making  process  to  the  fullest  extent  possible.    Read  over  NGA 
Standard  of  Practice  Standard  7  –  Standards  for  Decision  Making.  
#1  is  to  ask  the  person  what  the  person  wants.    In  addition, 
standard #3, Part IV discusses person-centered planning.   
 

 
b. 

 
Care,  Comfort,  and  Maintenance.    The  guardian  must  make  sure  that 
the protected person is cared for and provided with food, clothing, personal 
hygiene assistance, transportation, social and recreational opportunities, etc. 

The  guardian should  visit  the  protected  person  regularly  to  make sure  the 
protected person is being cared for and answer any questions the protected 
person has about the protected person’s care.  NGA Standards recommend 
monthly  visits  if  possible,  but  at  least  monthly  contact  by  other  means  or 
other persons who may see the individual.

Powers and Duties of Guardians and Conservators 

  Make sure that appropriate programs and activities are provided for 
the  protected  person.    Contact  local  agencies  to  find  out  what  is 
available. 

etermine what activities the protected person likes to do, and try to 
make  it  possible  for  the  protected  person  to  participate  in  these 
activities.    If  the  protected  person  needs  assistive  devices  like  a 
hearing aid, glasses, dentures, etc., you should arrange to get them. 

  D

Health and Safety.  The guardian must make sure the  protected person 
receives health care (including mental health care) and protection.   
 
The  guardian  should  arrange  for  any  physical  and  mental  examinations 
necessary to determine the protected person’s medical and mental health 
treatment  needs.    This  includes  examinations  for  hearing,  vision,  and 
dental problems, as well as medical problems.  The guardian may consent 
to  medical  or  other  professional  care,  counseling,  treatment,  or  other 
services for the protected person. 

However, the guardian cannot consent on behalf of the protected person 
to: 

an  abortion,  sterilization,  psychosurgery,  or  removal  of  bodily 
organs  except  when  necessary  to  preserve  the  life  or  prevent 
serious impairment of the physical health of the protected person. 

the  withholding  of  lifesaving  medical  procedures.    However,  a 
guardian  is  not  required  to  oppose  the  removal  or  withholding  of 
lifesaving  medical  procedures  when  those  procedures  will  only 
prolong  the  dying  process  and  offer  no  reasonable  likelihood  of 
temporarily  or  permanently  curing  or  relieving  the  illness  or 
condition  being  treated,  unless  the  protected  person  has  clearly 
stated that lifesaving medical procedures not be withheld.  

the  performance  of  an  experimental  medical  procedure  or 
participation in a medical experiment not intended to preserve the 
life  or  prevent  serious  impairment  of  the  physical  health  of  the 
protected person.

The guardian must also make sure the protected person receives services to 
develop  or  regain  the  ability  to  take  care  of  himself  or  herself,  to  the 
maximum  extent  possible.    This  may  include  educational  and  vocational 
services  necessary  for  the  physical  and  mental  welfare  of  the  protected 
person and to return the protected person to full capacity.  If the protected 
person regains any level of capacity or can be supported with less restrictive 
alternatives  to  guardianship  or  conservatorship,  you  have  a  duty  to  notify 
the Court of this change.

Powers and Duties of Guardians and Conservators 

Before  making  a  decision  about  medical  treatment,  be  sure  to  ask 
about the benefits, risks, and alternatives to the treatment.  Consider 
getting a second opinion. 

earn  as  much  as  you  can  about  the  condition  or  diagnosis  of  the 
person  in  the  guardianship  or  conservatorship.    The  more  you 
understand, the better you will be able to guide them, find resources, 
and support good decision-making. 

ind  out  if  the  protected  person  signed  an  advance  directive  on 
health  care  before  becoming  incapacitated.    This  directive  may  be 
called  a  “Living  Will,”    a  “Durable  Power  of  Attorney,”  an  “Advance 
Health  Care Directive,”  or  something  similar.    These  documents  are 
intended  to  describe  a  person’s  wishes  concerning  the  medical 
treatment  the  person  wants  to  be  given  if  the  person  needs 
treatment, but is unable to make decisions about it or communicate 
those decisions.  The document may appoint a person to make these 
decisions for the  protected person if the protected person is unable 
to make or communicate them.  If such a document exists, be sure 
to notify the court about it so the court can clarify who is responsible 
for  making  medical  decisions.    Also,  give  a  copy  to  the  protected 
person’s doctors, hospitals, assisted living home, etc. 

  L

  F

 

 

Rights.    The  guardian  must  make  sure  that  the  protected  person’s 
personal, civil, and human rights are protected (by filing lawsuits or taking 
whatever other action is necessary). 

A  person  in  a  guardianship  or  conservatorship  is  not  presumed  to  be 
incompetent and retains all legal and civil rights except those that have been 
expressly  limited  by  court  order  or  have  been  specifically  granted  to  the 
guardian by the court.10 

The  protected  person  has  the  right  to  ask  the  court  to  dismiss  the 
guardian/conservator  or  modify  the  guardianship/conservatorship  order.11  
The guardian and other interested parties can also ask the court to review 
and modify the order.  See paragraph 6 on page 9. 

The guardian cannot do any of the following: 
(1) 
(2) 

consent to termination of the protected person's parental rights, 
prohibit  the  protected  person  from  registering  to  vote  or  from 
casting a ballot at public election,

prohibit  the  protected  person  from  applying  for  and  obtaining  a 
driver's license, or 
prohibit the marriage or divorce of the protected person. 

Finances.    A  full  guardian  has  the  powers  and  duties  of  a  conservator 
(unless  a  separate  conservator  has  been  appointed).    That  means  the 
guardian  is  responsible  for  managing  the  protected  person’s  money  and 
property and using those assets to provide the care the protected person 
(and any dependent of the protected person) needs.  This fiduciary duty is 
a  position  of  trust.    As  a  guardian  or  conservator,  you  are  under  the 
jurisdiction of the Court, and the Court can review your records anytime.  
Violation  of  the  trust  through  neglect  or  exploitation  may  result  in  your 
removal  as  guardian  or  conservator,  as  well  as  possible  criminal  charges 
or civil action against you. 
 
The  guardian  or  conservator  must  apply  for  any  benefits  the  protected 
person  is  entitled  to.    This  may  include  health  and  accident  insurance 
benefits  and  other  private  or  governmental  benefits  that  would  help  pay 
any of the costs of medical, mental health,  or other services provided to 
the protected person. 

The guardian or conservator must: 

(1) 

locate  and  list  all  of  the  protected  person’s  property  (including 
cash, uncashed checks, bank  accounts, stocks, bonds, real estate, 
jewelry,  and  other 
vehicles, 
valuables), 

insurance  policies,

keep  the  protected  person’s  property  separate  from  the 
guardian’s or conservator’s property at all times.  The guardian 
or  conservator  must  never  use  the  protected  person’s  income, 
assets, or property for the guardian’s or conservator’s benefit. 

he  guardian  or  conservator  will  file  an  Implementation  Report  and 
Inventory within 90 days of appointment and an Annual Report each year 
with  the  court  during  the  duration  of  the  appointment.    The  Court  will 
review  these  reports  and  provide  a  response  to  the  guardian  or 
conservator if the report is approved or additional information is needed.  
The  Court  may  request  additional  information  from  your  records,  so  be 
sure  to  keep  all  receipts,  bank  records,  and  other  documentation  that 
support your accounting.

  Y

  O

The guardian or conservator can be paid from the protected person’s money for 
the  work  the  guardian  or  conservator  does,  but  only  if  the  Court  gives  written 
permission  first.    Also,  if  the  guardian  or  conservator  (or  the  guardian’s  or 
conservator’s  spouse,  parent,  or  child)  is  going  to  provide  room  and  board  for 
the  protected  person,  the  guardian  or  conservator  must  get  written  permission 
from the Court before using the protected person’s money to pay for this.  Room 
and board is defined as lodging, food, and utilities (not just rent), so remember 
to  include  all  these  costs  when  discussing  this  with  the  court  visitor  or  at  the 
court hearing. 

sually,  the  judge  will  set  the  authorized  amount  of  these  payments  in  the 
guardianship or conservatorship  appointment order.  Before doing so, the court 
must  determine  whether  the  protected  person  is  financially  able  to  pay  and 
whether the charges are reasonable.  If the guardian or conservator later wants 
to  increase  these  fees,  there  must  be  a  request  (in  writing)  for  the  court’s 
permission to do so.  The guardian or conservator must also send notice of any 
such request to at least one relative of the protected person if possible.12

Payment of the Guardian or Conservator

ltimately, payments to the guardian or conservator should be well-documented, 
including  reimbursements.    If  another  person  is  benefitting  from  the  protected 
person’s  income  or  assets,  the  Court  needs  to  know  about  this  to  check  for 
conflicts of interest. 

. 

Three-Year Review 

Every third year after a guardian is appointed, the court is required to appoint a 
visitor to file a report about the guardianship.13  The visitor is paid by the state.  
In order to prepare the report, the visitor will interview the protected person (to 
the  extent  possible),  the  guardian,  and  others  with  relevant  information  about 
the  protected  person.    The  court  visitor  will  also  review  the  last  three  annual 
reports and any other requested documentation. 

Requests to Change the Guardianship/Conservatorship 
 
At  any  time,  the  guardian/conservator,  the  protected  person,  or  another 
interested  party  may  ask  the  court  to  remove  the  guardian/conservator  and 
replace  him/her  with  a  different  person,  appoint  a  co-guardian/co-conservator, 
end the order, or otherwise change the guardianship/conservatorship order.  You 
may  use  form  PG-190, Petition for Review of Guardianship/Conservatorship,  to 
ask the court to do this.  Form PG-190 is available at any state court and on the 
court system’s website: www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm

If  the  guardian  or  conservator  has  the  protected  person’s  will  (or  knows  its 
location),  the  guardian  or  conservator  must  deliver  it  to  the  court  for 
safekeeping,  as  required  by  AS  13.26.545(e),  and  inform  the  executor  of  the 
estate or a beneficiary named in the will that the will has been delivered.  There 
is no charge for depositing the will with the court after the protected person dies. 

The  guardian  or  conservator  must  file  a  Final  Report  (form  PG-215  for  full  or 
partial  guardians;  form  PG-230  for  conservators  only)  with  the  court  within  90 
days after the protected person dies.14  Evidence of the death, such as a copy of 
the death certificate, should be attached to the final report.

Powers and Duties of Guardians and Conservators 

 

Alaska Statute 13.26.316 
General Powers and Duties of Guardian 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

A  guardian  shall  diligently  and  in  good  faith  carry  out  the  specific  duties  and  powers 
assigned by the court.  In carrying out duties and powers, the guardian shall encourage 
the  ward  to  participate  to  the  maximum  extent  of  the  ward's  capacity  in  all  decisions 
that affect the ward, to act on the ward's own behalf in all matters in which the ward is 
able,  and  to  develop  or regain,  to the  maximum  extent  possible,  the  capacity  to  meet 
the essential requirements for physical health or safety, to protect the ward's rights, and 
to manage the ward's financial resources. 

A partial guardian of an incapacitated person has only the powers and duties respecting 
the ward enumerated in the court order. 

A  full  guardian  of  an  incapacitated  person  has the  same  powers  and  duties  respecting 
the  ward  that  a  parent  has  respecting  an  unemancipated  minor  child  except  that  the 
guardian is not liable for the care and maintenance of the ward and is not liable, solely 
by reason of the guardianship, to a person who is harmed by acts of the ward.  Except 
as modified by  order of the court, a full guardian's powers and duties include, but are 
not limited to, the following: 

the  guardian  is  entitled  to  custody  of  the  person  of  the  ward  and  shall  assure 
that the ward has a place of abode in the least restrictive setting consistent with 
the essential requirements for the ward’s physical health and safety; 

the guardian shall assure the care, comfort, and maintenance of the ward; 

the guardian shall assure that the ward receives the services necessary to meet 
the  essential  requirements  for  the  ward's  physical  health  and  safety  and  to 
develop  or  regain,  to  the  maximum  extent  possible,  the  capacity  to  meet  the 
ward's needs for physical health and safety; 

the guardian shall assure through the initiation of court action and other means 
that  the  ward  enjoys  all  personal,  civil,  and  human  rights  to  which  the  ward  is 
entitled; 

the  guardian  may  give  consents  or  approvals  necessary  to  enable  the  ward  to 
receive medical or other professional care, counsel, treatment, or services except 
as otherwise limited by (e) of this section; 

the  guardian  has  the  powers  and  duties  of  a  conservator  under  this  chapter; 
however,  the  guardian  may  not  apply  the  ward's  money  or  property  for  the 
services as guardian or for room and board that the guardian or the guardian's 
spouse,  parent,  or  child  has  furnished  the  ward  unless,  before  payment,  the 
court  finds  that  the  ward  is  financially  able  to  pay  and  that  the  charge  is 
reasonable;  notice  of  a  request  for  payment  approval  shall  be  provided  to  at 
least  one  relative  of  the  ward  if  possible;  the  guardian  shall  exercise  care  to 
conserve any excess money or property for the ward's needs; 

if a conservator of the estate of the ward has also been appointed, the guardian 
shall pay all of the ward's estate received by the guardian to the conservator for 
management as provided in AS 13.26.401 - 13.26.575.

AS13.26.316 - continued 

A guardian of a ward, for whom a conservator has also been appointed, shall have the 
custody and care of the ward and is entitled to receive reasonable sums for services and 
for room and board furnished to the ward as agreed upon between the guardian and the 
conservator.  The guardian may request the conservator to expend the ward's estate for 
the ward's care and maintenance. 

(e) 

A guardian may not 

place the ward in a facility or institution for the mentally ill other than through a 
formal commitment proceeding under AS 47.30 in which the ward has a separate 
guardian ad litem; 

consent  on  behalf  of  the  ward  to  an  abortion,  sterilization,  psychosurgery,  or 
removal of bodily organs except when necessary to preserve the life or prevent 
serious impairment of the physical health of the ward; 

consent  on  behalf  of  the  ward  to  the  withholding  of  lifesaving  medical 
procedures;  however,  a  guardian  is  not  required  to  oppose  the  cessation  or 
withholding  of  lifesaving  medical  procedures  when  those  procedures  will  serve 
only  to  prolong  the  dying  process  and  offer  no  reasonable  expectation  of 
effecting a temporary or permanent cure of or relief from the illness or condition 
being  treated  unless  the  ward  has  clearly  stated  that  lifesaving  medical 
procedures not be withheld; a guardian is not civilly liable for acts or omissions 
under this paragraph unless the act or omission constitutes gross negligence or 
reckless or intentional misconduct; 

consent  on  behalf  of  the  ward  to  the  performance  of  an  experimental  medical 
procedure  or  to  participation  in  a  medical  experiment  not  intended  to  preserve 
the life or prevent serious impairment of the physical health of the ward; 

consent on behalf of the ward to termination of the ward's parental rights; 

prohibit  the  ward  from  registering  to  vote  or  from  casting  a  ballot  at  public 
election; 

prohibit the ward from applying for and obtaining a driver's license; 

prohibit the marriage or divorce of the ward.

Alaska Statute 13.26.266 
Guardianship Order 

 

Sections (b) and (c) of this statute discuss the guardianship plan. 

(b) 

The guardianship plan shall specify the authority that the guardian has with regard to 

(1)  medical care for the ward's physical condition; 

(2)  mental  health  treatment  that  the  guardian  considers  to  be  in  the  ward's  best 

interests; 

(A) 

(B) 

(C) 

(3) 

housing for the ward with consideration of the following: 

the wishes of the ward; 

the preferability of allowing the ward to retain local community ties; and 

the requirement for services to be provided in the least restrictive setting; 

personal care, educational and vocational services necessary for the physical and 
mental welfare of the ward and to return the ward to full capacity; 

application  for  health  and  accident  insurance  and  any  other  private  or 
governmental benefits to which the ward may be entitled to meet any part of the 
costs of medical, mental health, or related services provided to the ward; 

physical  and  mental  examinations  necessary  to  determine  the  ward's  medical 
and mental health treatment needs; and 

control of the estate and income of the ward to pay for the cost of services that 
the guardian is authorized to obtain on behalf of the ward. 

(c) 

The  guardianship  plan  may  not  be  more  restrictive  of  the  liberty  of  the  ward  than  is 
reasonably necessary to protect the ward from serious physical injury, illness or disease 
and to provide the ward with medical care and mental health treatment for physical and 
mental  health.    The  guardianship  plan  shall  be  designed  to  encourage  a  ward  to 
participate in all decisions that affect the ward and to act on the ward's own behalf to 
the maximum extent possible.  The court may not assign a duty or power to a guardian 
unless  the  need  for  it  has  been  proven  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  court  and  no  less 
restrictive alternative or combination of alternatives is sufficient to satisfy the need.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
