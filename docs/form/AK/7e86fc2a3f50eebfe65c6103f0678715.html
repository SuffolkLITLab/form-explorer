      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS TO RECEIVE  
LIFE INSUANCE FUNDS ON BEHALF OF A MINOR 
 
Introduction 
 
If an unmarried minor child is a beneficiary of a life insurance policy and the person whose life 
is insured dies, the insurance company will not pay the insurance proceeds directly to the child.  
Instead, the company will usually try to determine a legally responsible adult to whom it can pay 
the child’s money.  If you are a parent of such a child, the insurance company may write to you 
saying that you need to be named the “legal guardian” of the child before the company  can pay 
the money to you.  The forms and instructions in this packet should help you get the court order 
you need. 

ppointment as the full guardian of the child is not the most efficient remedy for this problem. In 
most cases, it will not even be possible because such an appointment is only allowed if  the child 
has  no  living  parents  or  “all  parental  rights  of  custody  have  been  terminated  or  suspended  by 
circumstances or prior court order.”1   

hese  instructions  instead  describe  a  procedure  for  asking  the  court  for  a  special  “limited 

guardianship.”  The court has the authority to appoint a “limited guardianship” because: 
  Even if the court cannot appoint a full guardianship, the court can make any other disposition 

of the matter that best serves the interest of the minor;2 and 

  The court can issue protective orders when a minor owns money or property that  cannot be 

managed or protected without a protective order.3 

  

Lawyers 

ou  may  want  to  talk  to  a  lawyer  about  the  protective  arrangement  options  described  in  this 
packet  or  whether  another  method  would  be  better.    If  possible, the  lawyer  should  be  familiar 
with guardianship and conservatorship procedure.  If you are unsure about whether you should 
hire a lawyer, it is a good idea to talk to one about your case before you decide whether you can 
handle it alone.  If you do not know a lawyer, you can call or write:

Definitions of Some Terms Used in These Instructions4 

In  the  language  of  life  insurance,  a  beneficiary  is  the  recipient  of  the 
proceeds of the policy when the named insured dies. 

A  “conservator”  is  someone  appointed  by  the  court  to  manage  the 
financial  affairs  of  a  person  who  needs  this  protection  because  the 
“protected person” cannot handle these matters.  The procedure for getting 
a  conservator  appointed  is  similar  to,  but  not  the  same  as, the  procedure 
for  getting a guardian appointed.  A conservator must file a report about 
the  conservatorship  with  the  court  every  year  until  the  conservatorship 
ends. 

A  guardian  is  a  person  appointed  by  the  court  to  manage  the  affairs  of 
another,  called  the  “ward.”    A  guardian  has  authority  to  make  personal 
decisions for the ward, such as where the ward will live and under what 
conditions.    A  guardian  may  also  manage  the  finances  of  the  ward  if  a 
conservator (someone to manage the ward’s money and property) has not 
been  appointed  by  the  court.    A  guardian  must  file  a  report  about  the 
guardianship with the court every year until the guardianship ends. 

A minor is a person who is under 18 years of age.5 

A written request to the court for an order.6 

The  petitioner  is  the  person  who  signs  the  petition  asking  the  court  to 
appoint a guardian or conservator or order another protective arrangement.

PETITION TO RECEIVE FUNDS

(AS 13.26.440)   

 

   

 

 

  I

 

Custodianship  under  the  “Uniform  Transfers  to  Minors  Act” 
(UTMA).7    The  UTMA  is  a  set  of  statutes,  adopted  by  almost  all 
states, that provides a method for transferring property to minors and 
arranging  for  an  adult  to  manage  it  until  the  child  is  old  enough  to 
receive  it.    See  the  description  of  the  powers  and  duties  of  a  UTMA 
custodian on the next page. 

Court-Approved Trust.  If a trust for the benefit of the minor already 
exists or if you intend to create one, you will need to describe it in the 
petition.    A  “trust”  is  a  legal  entity  created  to  hold  money  or  other 
property  for  the  benefit  of  a  particular  person  or  persons.    The  trust 
property is managed by a trustee.  The document that creates the trust 
describes the  rules the trustee  must  follow  in  managing  the  property, 
how the property can be used, and when it must be turned over to the 
beneficiary.      You  will  probably  need  an  attorney’s  help  to  create  a 
trust if a trust does not already exist.

Other  Court-Approved  Disposition  of  the  Funds.    If  you  want  the 
court  to  approve  another  protective  arrangement  for  the  minor’s 
insurance  proceeds,  you  must  check  the  third  box  on  page  1  of  the 
petition and describe that arrangement.

Powers and Duties of a UTMA Custodian 
 

The  custodian  must  keep  these  funds  separate  from  the  custodian’s  funds  and 
anyone else’s funds at all times.8  These funds belong to the minor child, although 
it  is  up  to the custodian  to  decide  where  to  invest  the  funds  and  when  to  spend 
them. 

The  custodian  must  keep  records  of  all  transactions  concerning  these  funds, 
including information necessary for the preparation of the minor’s tax returns, and 
must make the records available for inspection at reasonable intervals by a parent 
or legal representative of the minor or by the minor if the minor has attained the 
age of 14 years.9  

The  custodian  must  manage  and  invest  the  funds  and  the  funds’  earnings  to 
benefit the minor, and in dealing with the funds, must observe the standard of care 
that would be observed by a prudent person dealing with property of another.10 

When the money is deposited in an account at a financial institution, the account 
must  be  named  as  follows:  “          (Custodian’s  Name)            as  custodian  for    
(Minor’s Name)   under the Alaska Uniform Transfers to Minors Act.”11   

Note:  The custodian should also use the minor’s tax identification number (social 
security number) to identify all custodial property accounts. 
 
The custodian may pay to the minor or spend for the minor’s benefit as much of 
these  funds  as  the  custodian  considers  advisable  for  the  use  and  benefit  of  the 
minor.12

The custodian must transfer the funds to the minor when the minor reaches age 
18.13 

 

The provisions of the Alaska Uniform Transfers to Minors Act that describe the powers 
and duties of the custodian are on pages   11 – 14  .  The complete act (Alaska Statutes 
13.46.010  to  .999)  can  be  found  in  the  Alaska  Statutes  on  the  Alaska  Legislature’s 
website: www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/folio.asp

Paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 ask about other court orders or proceedings concerning 
the child.   If there are any court orders or court cases pending, please include 
the type of case, case name, case number and location of the court, if you can.  
Include any type of case that affects who has custody of the child in any court.  

Signature. 

b.

Sign  and  date  the  Petition  on  page  3.    You  will  also  need  to  complete  the 
“Verification” section that follows your signature.  You must do this in front of a 
notary  public.    A  court  clerk  can  provide  this  notary  service  for  you  (at  no 
charge) when you bring the Petition to court.  You must bring a photo ID with 
you for the notarization. 

 

 
Step 2.  Make a copy of the Petition and attachments for yourself.   
 

Be sure to attach a copy of the letter you received from the insurance company.    If 
you do not have a letter, please describe in your petition the form of communication 
you received from the insurance company.  Note: You will also need extra copies of 
the  Petition  and  attachments  to  send  along  with  the  notice  of  hearing  described  in 
Step 5 below. 

File the original Petition at the superior court filing location nearest to where the 
minor  lives  (see  list  of  court  addresses  on  page    9),  and  pay  the  filing  fee 
according to Administrative Rule 9(b)(4).  
You can deliver the Petition to the court in person or mail it along with the filing fee. 
If  you cannot afford this fee, ask the clerk for form TF-920, Request for Exemption 
from Payment of Fees.  If you are petitioning to receive funds belonging to more than 
one minor at the same time, you only have to pay one filing fee even though you must 
file a separate petition for each child. 

If you change your address or phone number after you file the petition and before the 
court hearing, be sure to notify the court. 

Scheduling of Court Hearing.   
The court clerk will mail to you a Notice of Hearing telling you the time and place of 
your hearing and the name of the judge or master who will preside. 
 

 
Step 5.  Notifying Others about the Hearing.  
 

As  petitioner,  it  is  your  responsibility  to  notify  all  the  following  people  about  the 
hearing: 
• 

the  minor  (if  the  minor  is  old  enough  to  understand  the  proceeding).    The 
minor  must  attend  the  hearing  in  person  or,  with  the  court’s  prior 
permission, telephonically.   
both parents of the minor   
the person who has physical custody of the minor if it is someone other than a 
parent

AS 13.26.401-.440; 
AS 13.46.010-.990 

On page 1, fill in the top of the form as you did on the  Petition. Then fill in 
the case number, the time and place of the hearing, the name of the judge or 
master  who  will  preside,  and  the  court  telephone  number.  (See  list  of 
telephone numbers on page   9 .)  Sign and date the form. 

On page 2, check the box in front of each person who will get this notice.  Fill 
in the name of the person, the date of delivery or mailing and the method of 
delivery.  Then  sign  the  bottom  of  the  page  and  fill  in  your  address  and 
telephone number. 

(1)  Minor.    If  the  minor  will  be  attending  the  hearing  in  person  or  by 
telephone, you can deliver the notice and petition to the minor yourself 
(check  the  “hand-delivery”  box  and  fill  in  your  name).    If  the  minor 
will not be attending the hearing, you must either have the documents 
served on the minor by a process server or get the court’s permission 
to use a different method of service or to not serve the minor at all. 

Parents.    If  the  parents  attend  the  hearing,  no  proof  of  notice  will  be 
required.    If  they  do  not  attend,  you  must  be  able  to  prove  that  you 
gave  them  notice  of  the  hearing.  If  the  parents  are  in  Alaska,  their 
copies must either be sent by certified mail with restricted delivery or 
delivered  by  a  process  server.  See  the  booklet  "How  to  Serve  a 
Summons in a Civil Lawsuit" (CIV-106) for instructions on both these 
methods.   If a parent is outside Alaska, the notice can be sent to  that 
parent  by  first  class  mail.14  Another  option,  if  you  want  to  avoid  the 
cost  of  certified  mail  or  a  process  server,  is  to  ask  the  parent  to 
“waive”  (give  up  the  right  to)  notice  of  the  hearing.      If  the  parent 
agrees to this, the parent will need to write a letter to the court telling 
the  court  that  he  or  she  understands  what  is  being  requested  in  your 
petition  and  chooses  not  to  attend  the  hearing.  This  letter  must  be 
notarized (signed in front of a notary public) and filed with the court.   

Person Who Has Physical Custody.  If someone other than a parent has 
physical  custody  of  the  minor,  the  notice  to  that  person  can  be 
delivered by either first class mail or hand delivery by you or anyone 
else.  If you use hand delivery, you must list who did (or will do) the 
delivery.

tep 6.  Court Hearing.16  

The hearing will be before a judge or master. 

The  minor  must  attend  the  hearing  in  person  unless  the  judge  or  master  gives 
permission (in advance) for the minor to participate by telephone (for example, if the 
minor lives out of state) or permission for the minor not to attend because the minor is 
not old enough to understand the proceedings. 

If  you  nominated  someone  other  than  yourself  to  be  the  guardian, that  person  must

If  no  one  has  filed  an  opposition  to  your  petition,  the  judge  may  ask  you 
questions about what you state in your petition.   

If  an  opposition  has  been  filed,  the  judge  will  ask  what  the  dispute  is.    In  a 
contested case,  

You  may  be  required  to  testify  under  oath  and/or  call  witnesses  to 
testify  in  support  of  your  petition.    You  will  have  the  burden  of 
proving what you have said in your petition. 

The  judge  may  have  to  postpone  the  hearing  if  it  is  going  to  take  a 
long time to hear all the necessary testimony. 

The judge may order mediation under Probate Rule 4.5. (The court’s 
order will state who the mediator will be, when mediation must begin 
and how the costs of the mediation will be split between the parties.)

Alaska Statute 13.46 

Chapter 13.46. ALASKA UNIFORM TRANSFERS TO MINORS ACT 

he following sections of the Act concern the custodian’s powers and duties: 

ec. 13.46.090. Single custodianship. 

A  transfer  may  be  made  only  for  one  minor,  and  only  one  person  may  be  the  custodian.  All 
custodial  property  held  under  this  chapter  by  the  same  custodian  for  the  benefit  of  the  same 
minor constitutes a single custodianship. 

ec. 13.46.100. Validity and effect of transfer. 

A  transfer  made  under  AS  13.46.080  is  irrevocable,  and  the  custodial  property  is 
indefeasibly vested in the minor, but the custodian has all the rights, powers, duties, and 
authority  provided  in  this  chapter,  and  neither  the  minor  nor  the  minor's  legal 
representative  has  any  right,  power,  duty,  or  authority  with  respect  to  the  custodial 
property except as provided in this chapter. 

ec. 13.46.110. Care of custodial property. 
(a) 
 
 

take control of custodial property; 
register or record title to custodial property if appropriate; and 
collect, hold, manage, invest, and reinvest custodial property. 

A custodian shall 
(1) 
(2) 
(3) 
In  dealing  with  custodial  property,  a  custodian  shall  observe  the  standard  of  care  that 
would  be  observed  by  a  prudent  person  dealing  with  property  of  another  and  is  not 
limited by any other statute, except AS 13.90.010, restricting investments by fiduciaries. 
If  a  custodian  has  a  special  skill  or  expertise  or  is  named  custodian  on  the  basis  of 
representations  of  a  special  skill  or  expertise,  the  custodian  shall  use  that  skill  or 
expertise. However, a custodian, in the custodian's discretion and without liability to the 
minor or the minor's estate, may retain custodial property received from a transferor. 
A custodian may invest in or pay premiums on life insurance or endowment policies on 
(1) 

the life of the minor only if the minor or the minor's estate is the sole beneficiary; 
or 
the life of another person in whom the minor has an insurable interest only to the 
extent  that  the  minor,  the  minor's  estate,  or  the  custodian  in  the  capacity  of 
custodian, is the irrevocable beneficiary. 

(2) 

A custodian at all times shall keep custodial property separate and distinct from all other 
property in a manner sufficient to identify it clearly as custodial property of the  minor. 
Custodial  property  consisting  of  an  undivided  interest  is  so  identified  if  the  minor's 
interest  is  held  as  a  tenant  in  common  and  is  fixed.  Custodial  property  subject  to 
recordation is so identified if it is recorded, and custodial property subject to registration 
is so identified if it is either registered, or held in an account designated, in the name of 
the custodian, followed in substance by the words:  "as a custodian for (name of minor) 
under the Alaska Uniform Transfers to Minors Act." 
A  custodian  shall  keep  records  of  all  transactions  with  respect  to  custodial  property, 
including information necessary for the preparation of the minor's tax returns, and shall 
make  them  available  for  inspection  at  reasonable  intervals  by  a  parent  or  legal 
representative of the minor or by the minor if the minor has attained the age of 14 years.

ec. 13.46.120. Powers of custodian. 
(a) 

A custodian, acting in a custodial capacity, has all the rights, powers, and authority over 
custodial  property  that  unmarried  adult  owners  have  over  their  own  property,  but  a 
custodian may exercise those rights, powers, and authority in that capacity only. 
This section does not relieve a custodian from liability for breach of AS 13.46.110. 

ec. 13.46.130. Use of custodial property. 
(a) 

A custodian may deliver or pay to the minor or expend for the minor's benefit as much of 
the custodial property as the custodian considers advisable for the use and benefit of the 
minor, without court order and without regard to 
(1) 

the duty or ability of the custodian personally or of another person to support the 
minor; or 
other income or property of the minor that may be applicable or available for that 
purpose. 

(2) 

On petition of an interested person or the minor if  the minor has attained the age of 14 
years, the court may order the custodian to deliver or pay to the minor or expend for the 
minor's benefit as much of the custodial property as the court considers advisable for the 
use and benefit of the minor. 
A  delivery,  payment,  or  expenditure  under  this  section  is  in  addition  to,  not  in 
substitution for, and does not affect an obligation of a person to support the minor. 

ec. 13.46.140. Custodian's expenses, compensation, and bond. 
(a) 

A custodian is entitled to reimbursement from custodial property for reasonable expenses 
incurred in the performance of the custodian's duties. 
Except for one who is a transferor under AS 13.46.030, a custodian has a noncumulative 
election  during  each  calendar  year  to  charge  reasonable  compensation  for  services 
performed during that year. 
Except as provided in AS 13.46.170 (f), a custodian is not required to give a bond. 

ec. 13.46.150. Exemption of third person from liability. 

A third person in good faith and without court order may act on the instructions of or otherwise 
deal  with  a  person  purporting  to  make  a  transfer  or  purporting  to  act  in  the  capacity  of  a 
custodian and, in the absence of knowledge, is not responsible for determining 

(1) 
(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

the validity of the purported custodian's designation; 
the  propriety  of,  or  the  authority  under  this  chapter  for,  an  act  of  the  purported 
custodian; 
the  validity  or  propriety  under  this  chapter  of  an  instrument  or  instructions 
executed  or  given  either  by  the  person  purporting  to  make  a  transfer  or  by  the 
purported custodian; or 
the propriety of the application of property of the minor delivered to the purported 
custodian. 

A claim based on (1) a contract entered into by a custodian acting in a custodial capacity, 
(2) an obligation arising from the ownership or control of custodial property, or (3) a tort 
committed  during  the  custodianship,  may  be  asserted  against  the  custodial  property  by 
proceeding against the custodian in the custodial capacity, whether or not the custodian or 
the minor is personally liable.

(b) 

A custodian is not personally liable 
(1) 

on a contract properly entered into in the custodial capacity unless the custodian 
fails to reveal that capacity and to identify the custodianship in the contract; or 
for an obligation arising from control of custodial property or for a tort committed 
during the custodianship unless the custodian is personally at fault. 

(2) 

A  minor  is  not  personally  liable  for  an  obligation  arising  from  ownership  of  custodial 
property or for a tort committed during the custodianship unless the minor is personally at 
fault. 

ec.  13.46.170.  Renunciation,  resignation,  death,  or  removal  of  custodian;  designation  of 

successor custodian. 
(a) 

A person nominated under AS 13.46.020 or designated under AS 13.46.080 as custodian 
may  decline  to  serve  by  delivering  a  valid  disclaimer  to  the  person  who  made  the 
nomination or to the transferor or the transferor's legal representative. If the event giving 
rise to a transfer has not occurred and a substitute custodian able, willing, and eligible to 
serve was not nominated under AS 13.46.020, the person who made the nomination may 
nominate  a  substitute  custodian  under  AS  13.46.020;  otherwise  the  transferor  or  the 
transferor's  legal  representative  shall  designate  a  substitute  custodian  at  the  time of  the 
transfer, in either case from among the persons eligible to serve as custodian for that kind 
of  property  under  AS  13.46.080(a).  The  custodian  so  designated  has  the  rights  of  a 
successor custodian. 
A custodian at any time may designate a trust company or an adult other than a transferor 
under  AS  13.46.030  as  successor  custodian  by  executing  and  dating  an  instrument  of 
designation  before  a  subscribing  witness  other  than  the  successor.  If  the  instrument  of 
designation does not contain or is not accompanied by the resignation of the custodian, 
the  designation  of  the  successor  does  not  take  effect  until  the  custodian  resigns,  dies, 
becomes incapacitated, or is removed. 
A custodian may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the minor if the minor 
has  attained  the  age  of  14  years  and  to  the  successor  custodian  and  by  delivering  the 
custodial property to the successor custodian. 
If  a  custodian  is  ineligible,  dies,  or  becomes  incapacitated  without  having  effectively 
designated  a  successor  and  the  minor  has  attained  the  age  of  14  years,  the  minor  may 
designate as successor custodian, in the manner prescribed in (b) of this section, an adult 
member  of  the  minor's  family,  a  conservator  of  the  minor,  or  a  trust  company.  If  the 
minor  has  not  attained  the  age  of  14  years  or  fails  to  act  within  60  days  after  the 
ineligibility,  death,  or  incapacity,  the  conservator  of  the  minor  becomes  successor 
custodian.  If  the  minor  has  no  conservator  or  the  conservator  declines  to  act,  the 
transferor, the legal representative of the transferor or of the custodian, an adult member 
of the minor's family, or another interested person may petition the court to designate a 
successor custodian. 
A custodian who declines to serve under (a) of this  section or resigns under (c) of this 
section,  or  the  legal  representative  of  a  deceased  or incapacitated custodian,  as  soon  as 
practicable, shall put the custodial property and records in the possession and control of 
the successor custodian. The successor custodian by action may enforce the obligation to 
deliver custodial property and records and becomes responsible for each item as received. 
A  transferor,  the  legal  representative  of  a  transferor,  an  adult  member  of  the  minor's 
family, a guardian of the person of the minor, the conservator of the minor, or the minor 
if  the  minor  has  attained  the  age  of  14  years  may  petition  the  court  to  remove  the 
custodian for cause and to designate a successor custodian other than a transferor under 
AS 13.46.030 or to require the custodian to give appropriate bond.

ec. 13.46.180. Accounting by and determination of liability of custodian. 
(a) 

A minor who has attained the age of 14 years, the minor's guardian of the person or legal 
representative, an adult member of the minor's family, a transferor, or a transferor's legal 
representative may petition the court for 
(1) 
(2) 

an accounting by the custodian or the custodian's legal representative; or 
a  determination  of  responsibility,  as  between  the  custodial  property  and  the 
custodian  personally,  for  claims  against  the  custodial  property  unless  the 
responsibility has been adjudicated in an action under AS 13.46.160 to which the 
minor or the minor's legal representative was a party. 

A  successor  custodian  may  petition  the  court  for  an  accounting  by  the  predecessor 
custodian. 
The  court,  in  a  proceeding  under  this  chapter  or in  another  proceeding,  may  require  or 
permit the custodian or the custodian's legal representative to account. 
If  a  custodian  is  removed  under  AS  13.46.170(f),  the  court  shall  require an  accounting 
and order delivery of the custodial property and records to the successor custodian and 
the execution of all instruments required for transfer of the custodial property. 

ec. 13.46.190. Termination of custodianship. 

The custodian shall transfer in an appropriate manner the custodial property to the minor or to 
the minor's estate upon the earlier of the 

(1)  minor's attainment of  21  years of age  with respect to property transferred under 
AS 13.46.030 or 13.46.040 unless the time of transfer of the custodial property to 
the minor is changed under AS 13.46.195; 

(2)  minor's  attainment of 18  years of age  with respect to property transferred under 

(3) 

AS 13.46.050 or 13.46.060; 
time  specified  in  the  transfer  under  AS  13.46.080  if  the  time  of  transfer  of  the 
custodial property to the minor is changed under AS 13.46.195; or 

(4)  minor's death. 

ec. 13.46.999. Short title.
