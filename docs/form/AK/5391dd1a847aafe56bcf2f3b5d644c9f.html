Plain Meaning 

You might see it used like this . . . 

Benefit year 

“Jan. 1-Dec. 31” 

Brand name 
prescription drug 

“A prescription drug with a proprietary 
name assigned to it by the manufacturer 
or distributor and so indicated by Medi-
Span or any other similar publication 
designated by Aetna.” 

Claims 
Administrator 

“A person, firm, or company which has 
agreed to provide technical or 
administrative services and advice in 
connection with the operation of all or a 
part of a benefit provided for under the 
plan, and perform such other functions, 
including processing and payment of 
claims, as may be delegated to it under 
such contract. The claims administrator 
may review claims and, if applicable, 
coordinate external reviews, as provided 
by the plan.” 

Coinsurance 

“The percentage of covered expenses 
which the plan pays after application of 
any applicable deductible.” 

Each year, the Department of Retirement and 
Benefits (DRB) issues a new version of the 
health plan booklet. The plan applies from 
Jan.1-Dec. 31, unless DRB issues 
amendments. 

Prescription drugs are patented by the drug 
manufacturers who produce them. After a drug 
has been on the market for a period of time, 
the patent expires and new drug 
manufacturers can make generic versions of 
the drug. The generic versions are often much 
cheaper than the brand name, patented drugs. 

The State of Alaska has its own health plan. 
The plan is a written document that outlines 
health, dental, and vision benefits. DRB 
contracts with private companies to manage 
our plan. The current plan administrator for 
medical and prescription claims is Aetna. Delta 
Dental is the claims administrator for the 
dental plan; Vision Services Plan manages the 
vision plan and Payflex administers the health 
flexible spending accounts and COBRA. 

Open enrollment is held annually and 
elections will apply to the following benefit 
year. 

Your minimum payment for a non-preferred 
brand-name prescription drug is $80. Your 
maximum payment is $150. 

“You may initiate a first level of appeal of 
the denial of a claim by a filing a written 
appeal with the claims administrator within 
180 calendar days of the date the 
Explanation of Benefits or pre-service denial 
letter was issued[.]” 

Employees and dependents are responsible for 
paying a percentage of costs for medical 
services. Depending on the employee’s plan, 
the service, and the provider, employees can 
be responsible for paying anywhere between 
$0 and 50% of covered expenses. 

Employees and dependents covered by the 
Consumer Choice Plan pay 50% of the cost 
of services from an out-of-network free-
standing imaging center.   
OR 
Employees covered by the Economy Plan 
pay no coinsurance for preventative care

with a network provider. The plan pays 
100%. 

Under the vision plan, contact lenses from a 
network provider are covered 100% after 
payment of the $60 copayment.  
OR 
There is a $100 copayment for a non-
preferred brand-name prescription drug for 
a 31-90 day supply from a network 
pharmacy. 

Copayment 

“The specific dollar amount required to 
be paid by you or on your behalf by the 
plan.” 

Some services or prescriptions require you to 
pay a specific dollar amount, rather than a 
percentage of the total cost. 

Deductible 

“The amount of covered expenses for 
which you are responsible each benefit 
year before any benefits are payable 
under the plan.” 

Facility services 

No plan definition. 

The specific dollar amount that you must pay 
before the plan will begin to pay for covered 
expenses. After you satisfy this amount, you 
must still pay coinsurance. Note: The plan will 
pay for preventative services before you 
satisfy your deductible. 

From the 2018 plan, p. 27: “After you 
satisfy any applicable deductible, you will be 
responsible for any applicable coinsurance 
for covered expenses that you incur up to 
the applicable out-of-pocket limit.” 

Any treatment (other than emergency 
services) received at a hospital, rehabilitation 
facility, surgery center, or free-standing 
imaging center. 

If receiving any of these types of services, 
you must use a preferred provider in 
Anchorage or a network provider outside of 
Anchorage, or face steep penalties. 

Formulary 

“A listing of prescription drugs (both 
generic prescription drugs and brand-
name prescription drugs) established by 
the plan administrator. The formulary will 
tell you if a drug is covered and tell you 
what plan payment tier it is in. You can 
also see if there are alternatives that cost 
less. The list is subject to periodic review 
and modification. This list is outlined in 
the Preferred Drug Guide. The Preferred 
Drug Guide also includes an Exclusion 
List of drugs that are identified as 
excluded under the plan, subject to 
periodic review and modification.” 

A list of drugs covered by the plan, classified 
as generic (lowest cost/First Tier), preferred 
brand (a slightly higher cost/Second Tier), 
non-preferred brand (a higher cost/Third Tier), 
preferred specialty (lower cost for specialty 
drugs), and non-preferred specialty (higher 
cost for non-preferred specialty drugs).

/materials/2018_aetnadrugguide.pdf 

When getting a prescription, you might ask 
your doctor whether there are generic 
alternatives. There are some drugs that are 
not covered at all, and Aetna has a separate 
formulary for excluded drugs and 
alternatives that are covered.

Plan Definition 

Plain Meaning 

You might see it used like this . . . 

Generic 
prescription drug 

You will pay the lowest amount for generic 
prescription drugs.  

The plan will pay 80% of the cost of a 30-
day supply of a generic prescription drug at 
a network pharmacy. 

“A prescription drug, whether identified 
by its chemical, proprietary, or 
nonproprietary name, that is accepted by 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as 
therapeutically equivalent and 
interchangeable with drugs having an 
identical amount of the same active 
ingredient and so indicated by Medispan 
or any other publication designated by 
Aetna.” 

Hidden provider 
charges 

No definition in plan. 

Medically 
necessary 

Plan Section 3.5.1. Determined by 
Aetna’s current Medical and Pharmacy 
Clinical Policy Bulletins (CPB): 

http://www.aetna.com/healthcare-
professionals/policies-
guidelines/clinical_policy_bulletins.html. 

When a service or supply is not 
addressed by a CPB, Aetna determines 
whether service “would be given to a 
patient for the purpose of evaluating, 
diagnosing, or treating an illness, an 
injury, a disease, or its symptoms by a 
physician or other health care provider, 
exercising prudent clinical judgment.” 

Hidden provider charges are charges from 
providers that may have been a part of your 
treatment, but that may work for a different 
entity as the main provider and so may be 
billed separately. Although the primary 
provider may be a network provider, the 
hidden provider could be out-of-network. 

When you receive imaging services from a 
network provider, that provider may 
contract with outside, out-of-network 
radiologists to read your images. You will 
pay a higher cost for these providers. 

Some services will not be covered by the 
health plan because they may not be 
determined to be medically necessary. There 
are many factors that go into this 
determination. If you have a question about 
whether a service is medically necessary, 
consider asking a Healthcare Advocate. 

“Not every service, supply or prescription 
drug that fits the definition of medical 
necessity is covered by the medical plan. 
Exclusions and limitations apply to certain 
medical services, supplies and expenses. For 
example, some benefits are limited to a 
certain number of days or visits to a dollar 
maximum.”

Plan Definition 

Plain Meaning 

You might see it used like this . . . 

Negotiated charge 

“The maximum charge that a network 
provider has agreed to make as to any 
service or supply for the purpose of 
benefits under the plan.” 

Aetna and network providers set standard 
rates for specific services. When you use a 
network provider, the amount they bill the 
plan will generally be lower than their standard 
price for the service because they follow the 
negotiated charge. 

On an Explanation of Benefits, the 
negotiated charge will appear as the 
“member rate.” If you are using a network 
provider, the member rate should be less 
than the amount billed. The member rate, or 
negotiated charge, is the amount Aetna will 
use to calculate your coinsurance. 

Network pharmacy 

“A pharmacy that has contracted with 
Aetna to furnish services or supplies for 
the plan.” Can be found at: 

www.aetna.com/docfind 

Network pharmacies will bill your insurance for 
its share of prescription cost sharing. 

When you use an out-of-network pharmacy, 
you are responsible for paying the pharmacy 
directly for prescriptions and submitting a 
claim for reimbursement from the plan. 

Network provider 

“A health care provider or pharmacy that 
has contracted with a claims 
administrator to furnish services or 
supplies for the plan, but only if the 
provider is a network provider for the 
service or supply involved.” 

www.aetna.com/docfind 

You will see your lowest out-of-pocket cost for 
most services when you use a network 
provider. Your coinsurance and out-of-pocket 
maximum with both be lower and you will pay 
nothing for preventative services, which are 
covered at 100% at a network provider. And 
when you use a network provider you are not 
responsible for obtaining precertification. 

Dental network providers are identified in 
Delta Dental’s directory, which can be found 
online at www.deltadentalak.com.

Term 

Plan Definition 

Plain Meaning 

You might see it used like this . . . 

Out-of-pocket limit 

“The maximum amount you are 
responsible to pay for benefits under the 
plan each benefit year, including 
deductible and coinsurance not paid by 
the plan. Premiums, charges over the 
recognized charge, precertification 
benefit reductions, and non-covered 
expenses do not accrue toward the out-
of-pocket limit. A separate out-of-pocket 
limit applies with respect to the medical 
benefit portion and prescription benefit 
portion of the plan.” 

Your out-of-pocket limit is the amount you 
must pay, including your deductible and 
coinsurance, before your benefits will be 
covered at 100% under the plan.  

When receiving services at an out-of-
network facility, such as a hospital or free-
standing imaging center, the out-of-pocket 
limit that otherwise applies under the 
medical plan will be doubled. 

Precertification 

“A process where the claims 
administrator is contacted before certain 
services are provided. It is not a 
guarantee that benefits will be payable.” 

You have to get prior approval to obtain 
certain services, including travel, preventative 
services at an out-of-network provider, and 
any service listed on page 32 of the plan 
(includes many things, but common services 
would include stays in a hospital or facility, 
dialysis visits, MRI of knee or spine, intensive 
outpatient treatment programs). 

“You are responsible for obtaining the 
necessary precertification from Aetna prior 
to receiving services from an out-of-network 
provider. Your provider may pre-certify your 
treatment for you; however, you should 
verify with Aetna prior to the procedure that 
the provider has obtained precertification 
from Aetna.” 

Preferred Provider 

The plan does not define “preferred 
provider,” but does state, “The medical 
plan has a facility-only preferred provider 
agreement for facility services in the 
municipality of Anchorage. The preferred 
facilities in the municipality of Anchorage 
are Alaska Regional Hospital, and their 
affiliated surgery center Surgery Center 
of Anchorage.” 

In Anchorage, a preferred provider facility 
(hospital, surgery center, rehabilitative facility, 
or free-standing imaging center) differs from 
an out of network facility because the penalties 
for using a non-preferred provider facility are 
higher than the typical penalty for using an 
out-of-network provider. AND when selecting 
facility services outside of Anchorage, 
employees who use an out-of-network 
hospital, surgery center, or free-standing 
imaging center will suffer the same penalties 
applied to use of a non-preferred provider 
facility in Anchorage. 

If you use a non-preferred provider, you will 
pay an additional 20% coinsurance, your 
out-of-pocket maximum will double, and the 
recognized charge will be reduced to the 
percentage of Medicare that most closely 
reflects the aggregate contracted rate at the 
preferred hospital or facility in the 
Municipality of Anchorage.

Plan Definition 

Plain Meaning 

You might see it used like this . . . 

Prevailing charge 
rate 

“Rates reported by FAIR Health, a 
nonprofit company, in their database. 
FAIR Health reviews and, if necessary, 
changes these rates periodically. Aetna 
updates its systems with these changes 
within 180 days after receiving them 
from FAIR Health.” 
https://www.fairhealthconsumer.org/ 

The prevailing charge rate is the “going rate” 
for certain services as reported in the FAIR 
Health database. When Aetna does not have a 
set rate for a service because a provider is 
out-of-network, the prevailing charge rate is 
used to determine what Aetna thinks is a 
reasonable rate for the service. Aetna does not 
always update FAIR Health data. 

When determining the recognized charge, 
Aetna will pay the lesser of the provider’s bill 
or the 90th percentile of the prevailing 
charge rate for the geographic area. 

Recognized charge 

The recognized charge, is the amount Aetna 
will use to calculate your coinsurance. 

“The negotiated charge contained in an 
agreement the claims administrator has 
with the provider either directly or 
through a third party. If there is no such 
agreement, the recognized charge is 
determined in accordance with the 
provisions of this section. An out-of-
network provider has the right to bill the 
difference between the recognized 
charge and the actual charge. This 
difference will be the covered person’s 
responsibility.” 

The recognized charge is the contract rate 
Aetna has with a network provider. For an out-
of-network provider, the recognized charge is 
the amount Aetna determines to be a 
reasonable charge based on the following 
formulas: Medical services—lesser of 
provider’s bill or 90th percentile of prevailing 
charge rate for geographic area; 
Facility expenses in Anc and outside of AK-out-
of-network—lesser of provider’s bill or 185% of 
Medicare rate for service; 
Free standing imaging center—50% of amount 
billed.
