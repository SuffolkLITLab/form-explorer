B.  DEFENSES 
[Defenses are reasons you should win the case instead of the Plaintiff.  Mark all defenses that 
you think apply to your case.  If you can prove the defense at trial, you may be able to prove 
you do not owe the Plaintiff anything or that you owe less than asked for in the Complaint.  
Read about defenses at http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/debt/answer.htm#defenses] 

 I have no defenses. [Go to Section C.] 

 

 I have the defense(s) listed below: [Check below all defenses that you believe apply, and 
attach copies of any documents you have that support your defenses.] 
 

1. 

  I did not enter an agreement or contract for the debt described in the Complaint 
because: 

  The Plaintiff made a mistake about the name of the person who made the contract.  
(This might happen if you have a common name and you think the Plaintiff has 
confused you with someone who has the same name.) 
 Someone stole my identification and made this debt.  
  Other:  

 

 

 

2. 

  I disagree with the amount the Plaintiff says that I owe because: 

  I owed the debt, but the creditor (person who is owed money) told me I did not 
owe anything else under our agreement. 
  I owed the debt, but the creditor (person who is owed money) and I worked out a 
new agreement to settle the debt and I followed it. 
  I owed the debt, but paid all of it. 
  I owed the debt, but paid part of it.  I paid $ 
  I have a contract or agreement with the Plaintiff, but the Plaintiff’s math is wrong 
about how much I owe.  I owe $__________________. 
  I have a contract or agreement with the Plaintiff, but someone else made the 
charge/debt without my permission. (This might happen if someone else made 
charges on your credit card.) 
  Other:  

 and owe $ 

. 

 

  I did not enter any agreement or contract with the Plaintiff, and I do not believe the  
Plaintiff can show they own the debt.  (This might happen if you had a contract or 
agreement with someone else, like a credit card company, and the Plaintiff says they 
bought your debt, but you are not sure they have evidence to prove they bought it.) 

 This debt is too old.  More than 3 years have passed since I made a payment or was 
supposed to make the first payment.  This is too long under Alaska’s statute of 
limitations law for contracts. (If you are being sued for a debt that is not based on a 
contract between you and the other person, there may be a different time limit.)  
(Alaska Statute 09.10.053) 

 I or someone else was already sued for this debt.

  I used collateral to get this loan, and the Plaintiff took my collateral but did not follow 
the rules for selling it because:  

 I was not given appropriate notice about the sale of the collateral.  
 The Plaintiff did not sell my collateral in a fair way. 

(Alaska Statute 45.29.601-.628) 

 
  The debt is for a payday loan and the Plaintiff did not: 

8. 

 Offer me a payment plan to repay this debt with only a $30 fee.  
 Send me a certified letter telling me they were going to start this case and  
that I had at least 15 days to respond before they would start the case.  

 

(Alaska Statute 06.50.550) 

 

9. 

  I do not owe the Plaintiff any money because the Plaintiff was supposed to do  
something before I had to pay and it did not happen. (This might happen if Plaintiff 
was supposed to do a service for you before being paid, like fix something in your 
house, but did not do it.) The Plaintiff was supposed to do the following:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 More pages are attached.  

  The Plaintiff says I bounced a check.  The Plaintiff cannot sue me because they did not 
write me at least 15 days before starting this case to tell me I could avoid court by 
paying back what I owed on the check plus $30.  (Alaska Statute 09.68.115)  

  I am a member of the military on active duty or have been released from active duty  
within the last 90 days.  I am requesting a 90 day stop (stay) to the case.  I have 
attached the necessary written information.  
[Attach letters from you and your commanding officer explaining why your service 
makes you unable to go to court and when you will be able to go to court.  You may 
request another stay in 90 days if you are still unavailable.] 

  Other: [State any other reasons the court should not order you to pay the Plaintiff.]

ANSWER & COUNTERCLAIM TO COMPLAINT TO COLLECT A DEBT 

C.  COUNTERCLAIM

court case).  If you have a claim against the Plaintiff from the same facts that the Plaintiff is 
 
a
k
l
a
t
ng about in the Complaint and you do not list it here, you might lose your right to sue the 
i
ntiff for it later.  List any counterclaims you have against the Plaintiff.  Read about

counterclaims at http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/debt/answer.htm#counterclaim] 
 

 I have no counterclaim. [Go to Section D.] 
 I have the counterclaim(s) listed below: 
[Check below all counterclaims that you believe apply, and attach copies of any documents 
you have that support your counterclaims.] 

  Breach of Contract: The Plaintiff and I had an agreement or contract and the Plaintiff 
owes me something under the agreement. [Explain the agreement, how the Plaintiff 
broke it, and what the Plaintiff owes you.]

  Consumer Protection Violation: I request that the court order the Plaintiff to pay me 
because the Plaintiff violated the Alaska Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer 
Protection Act (Alaska Statute 45.50.471-.561) or the Federal Fair Debt Collection 
Practices Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 1692-1692p) and caused me damages. [Check at least one 
box under both “a.” and “b.” below.] 

a. Violation: [Check the box that describes what the Plaintiff did that caused you harm.  
Some claims only apply if the Plaintiff is a debt collector, who regularly collects debts 
for other people or companies.] 

 The Plaintiff is a debt collector who contacted me about a debt and then did not 
send the following information in writing within 5 days: 

 Amount I owed. 
 Who I owed. 
 That I had 30 days to disagree in writing, and if I did not, the Plaintiff would 
believe I owed the debt and proceed with the case against me. 
 That I had 30 days to disagree in writing, and if I did, the Plaintiff would 
send written proof that I owed the money. 
 That I had 30 days to respond in writing and ask for the name and address of 
the person or company that I owed the debt to in the first place.

 The Plaintiff is a debt collector who harassed or threatened me in the following 
way: [Describe what the Plaintiff did.  Read examples at

 The Plaintiff says they bought my debt, but I do not think they have admissible 
evidence to prove they bought it.  Filing a debt collection lawsuit without 
admissible evidence is an unfair or deceptive practice. 

 The Plaintiff says I bounced a check.  The Plaintiff cannot sue me because they 
did not write me at least 15 days before starting this case to tell me I could avoid 
court by paying back what I owed on the check plus $30. 

 The debt is for a payday loan and the Plaintiff did not:   

 Offer me a payment plan to repay this debt with only a $30 fee.  
 Send me a certified letter telling me they were going to start this case and 
that I had at least 15 days to respond before suing.  

 I paid a lawyer for advice. 
 I had costs in this case to prepare, print and mail documents, like this 
Answer.   
 I missed work for court or some other reason related to what the Plaintiff did. 
 I lost property:

Therefore, the Court should:  

 Order the Plaintiff to pay me $500. 
 Order the Plaintiff to pay me 3 times the money the Plaintiff cost me.  It cost 
me: $

D.  OFFER TO PAY 

[If you want to make the plaintiff an offer to settle the case without having a trial, there are 
options below.  The plaintiff does not have to agree to take your offer, and the court CANNOT 
make the plaintiff agree to a payment plan.  If you make an offer that the plaintiff does not 
accept, the plaintiff cannot use that offer against you later in the court case to prove you 
admitted owing the debt.  However, if you admit you owe the debt in any section of this 
Answer, the plaintiff may use it to prove you owe the debt and win the case. You need to fill 
out the other sections of this Answer even if you make an offer to pay. Read about settling 
case at http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/debt/settlement.htm] 
 
a
 

 I do not want to propose a plan to settle this debt at this time. [Go to Section E.]   

 I have attached a draft agreement, which I signed, and agree that the court should close 
the case if the Plaintiff signs it and returns it to me and the court.  Any offer I make to the 
Plaintiff to try to settle the case cannot be admitted in court to prove liability according to 
Evidence Rule 408.  [Draft your own agreement or use Debt Settlement Agreement & Order 
smissing Case, CIV-484 at http://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/civ-485.pdf] 
i
D

 I would like to try to work with the Plaintiff to end this case with the following plan to pay, 
but if we do not reach agreement, I do not give up my right to state defenses and 
counterclaims or have a trial.  Any offer I make to the plaintiff to try to settle the case 
cannot be admitted in court to prove liability according to Evidence Rule 408.   

  [Check all the boxes below that apply to your offer.] 

 I will pay the debt using a payment plan where I will pay $ 
until paid in full.  I will start payments on  
month by the following day of the month:  

.  I will make payments each 
. 

 each month 

 I would like the total debt amount reduced to $  
 
 

 because:  

 I agree to pay any money I receive from my PFD to the Plaintiff until I have paid in full.  

 I agree that the court can make our agreement a formal part of the case, and if I do not 
follow the payment plan, the Plaintiff can return to court to get a judgment to collect the 
money we agree I owe. 

 
 

 
 
 

 Other:  
 
 
 

 I cannot make a payment plan right now because of my limited income, and I want to give 
notice to the Plaintiff that the income and/or assets listed here cannot be collected because 
they are exempt from execution.  [Do not check this box unless you have reviewed the 
Judgment Debtor Booklet at http://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/civ-511.pdf to
