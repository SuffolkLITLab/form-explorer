Incapacity. 

PG400 (CV) 

 

 

It has been shown by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is 
incapacitated as defined in AS 13.26.005(5).  [Someone is incapacitated if the 
person’s ability to receive and evaluate information or to communicate decisions 
so impaired that the person cannot provide for the person’s own physical 
 
s
i
health or safety without court-ordered help (including healthcare, food, shelter, 
othing, personal hygiene, and protection).]  AS 13.26.251(b). 
l
c

The respondent agrees to the finding of incapacity as defined above.  
AS 13.26.251(b). 

Full Guardian. The respondent is totally without the capacity to care for the 
respondent’s self, and a combination of alternatives to guardianship and the 
appointment of a partial guardian is not feasible or adequate to meet the respondent’s 
needs.  Therefore, the court will appoint a full guardian.  AS 13.26.251(f). 

The respondent lacks the ability to provide for the respondent’s self in the following 
areas: 

Medical care. 

Housing. 

Mental health treatment (if any is required). 

Personal care, educational, and vocational services necessary for the 
physical and mental welfare of the respondent, and if possible, to enable 
the respondent to develop or return to full capacity. 

Application for health and accident insurance and any other private or 
governmental benefits to which the respondent may be entitled.  

Physical and mental examinations necessary to determine the 
respondent’s medical and mental health treatment needs. 

Control and management of the respondent’s property and financial 
affairs in order to pay for the cost of services of (1) – (6).  

AS 13.26.266(a)(2) & (b). 

Powers of a Conservator.  The guardian should have the powers of a conservator, 
because it has been established that the respondent: 

is unable to effectively manage the respondent’s property and financial 
affairs, and  

has property that will be wasted or used up unless someone manages it, 
or has funds that are needed for the support, care, and welfare of the 
respondent or those entitled to be supported by the respondent.  
AS 13.26.430(c) and AS 13.26.401(2). 

As required by AS 13.26.430(d), the court investigated the alternatives to appointing a 
conservator, including the services of a special conservator, and concludes that the 
powers of a full conservator should be given to the guardian, because the alternatives 
under AS 13.26.440 are not adequate to protect the respondent’s estate.

Consideration of the Respondent’s Preference. 
a. 

Pursuant to the AS 13.26.251(g) requirement that the court consider the 
respondent’s preference in selecting a guardian, the court 
has considered the respondent’s preference. 
has not considered the respondent’s preference in guardians for the 
reasons stated   

 in the attached findings. 

 on the record.    

 
 

b. 

Pursuant to the AS 13.26.430(d) requirement that the court, to the maximum 
extent possible, consult with the respondent in determining what action should 
be taken with respect to appointment of a conservator, the court 

has consulted with the respondent about whether the guardian should be 
given the powers of a conservator.   
has not consulted with the respondent concerning the conservator issue 
 in the attached findings. 
 on the record.    
for the reasons stated   

7. 

License.  The guardian  

has the required professional license under AS 08.26. 
is the Public Guardian. 
is exempt from the license requirement under AS 08.26.180, because the 
individual is employed by a regulated financial institution and will provide these 
guardian services in the course of this employment. 
is not required to be licensed, because the guardian is not engaged in the 
business of providing guardian or conservator services.  The guardian   

 has  

 has not satisfied the one-hour mandatory education requirement on 

 

 

the basics of guardianship and conservatorship.

Personal Contact.    

 
 

 

 

The respondent appeared for court either in person or by video connection. 
The respondent did not appear in court, but the court visitor had personal or 
video contact with the respondent. 
The court visitor shall have personal or video contact with the respondent

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
