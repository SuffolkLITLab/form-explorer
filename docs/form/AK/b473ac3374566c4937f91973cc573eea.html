INSTRUCTIONS FOR CALCULATING PREJUDGMENT INTEREST 

STEP ONE: Determine Due Date 

irst, determine the due date of the principal amount.  That date will be: 

In Tort Cases  (non-contract cases; examples include damage to property or personal 
injury) [AS 09.30.070(b)] 
1.  The date agreed upon by the parties; or 
2.  If there is no such agreement, the earlier of: 

a.  The date the summons and complaint were served on the defendant; or 
b.  The date the defendant received written notification that an injury or property 
damage occurred and that a claim may be brought against the defendant. 

In All Other Cases  [AS 45.45.010] 
1.  The date stated in a written contract or agreement; or 
2.  The date the contract was breached; or 
3.  If there is no written contract or agreement, the date the principal was due (for 
example, the date an account or debt became payable or the date the parties 
agreed the debt would be paid) or the date the debtor refuses to pay.   
[K & K Recyling, Inc. v. Alaska Gold Co., 80 P.3d. 702, 724 (Alaska 2003), 
Hoffman v. von Wirth, 907 P.2d 454, 455 and footnote 2 (Alaska 1995)] 

EQUIRED DOCUMENTATION.  File written documentation with the court showing the date the 
principal became due.  Some examples are: a written contract, a payment ledger, an invoice, an 
affidavit describing the terms of the parties’ oral agreement, a copy of a letter to the defendant 
giving written notification of the claim. 

STEP TWO: Determine Interest Rate 

 

econd, determine the interest rate.  If you have a contract or promissory note that states what 

the interest rate will be, use that rate (and attach a copy of your contract or the original 
promissory note).  If there is no contract interest rate, the rate is set by a statutory formula.1  
Use form ADM-505 to determine the interest rate in your case using this statutory formula: 
https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/adm-505.pdf. 

TEP THREE: Calculate Interest 

hird, show the court your interest calculations.  See page 3 for the calculations if you have 
received no payments since filing the complaint.  See page 4 for the calculations if you have 
received any payments since filing the complaint. 

                                                           
1 AS 09.30.070(a) sets the rate at “three percentage points above the 12th Federal Reserve District 
discount rate in effect on January 2 of the year in which the judgment or decree is entered.”  Exceptions:  
This rate does not apply if: (1) there is a contract that sets a different rate, (2) there is a statute that sets 
a different rate, or (3) the cause of action accrued before August 7, 1997 (in which case the rate will be 
10.5%.)  In general, a cause of action “accrues” when a suit may be maintained thereon, that is, when 
sufficient events have occurred to support a valid lawsuit (for example, when injury or damage occurs or 
when a contract is breached).

No Payments Received 

f you have received no payments since filing the complaint, attach a separate sheet showing: 

.  The principal amount stated on your complaint (not including interest) and the date it 

became due. 

.  Your calculation of the amount of interest due using the following formula:

Amount of Interest 
Due for that Period 

“No. of Days” means the number of days between the due date of the principal and the 
date you file your Default Affidavit. 
“Annual Interest Rate” means the interest rate you determined in Step 2 on page 2. 

.  Add the interest to the original principal and show the new balance due. 

EXAMPLE 

ample case:  Complaint is filed September 15, 2018 claiming $1,000.  The money has been 
due since March 16, 2018.  Defendant does not answer complaint, so on November 22, 2018, 
Plaintiff files Default Affidavit (page 1 of this form) with the following calculations attached:

Payments Received 

If you have received payments since filing the complaint, attach a separate sheet showing: 
1.  The principal amount due (not including any interest) and the date it became due. 
2.  The date and amount of the defendant’s first payment. 
3.  Your calculation of the amount of interest due between those two dates, using the formula 

shown in the second text box on page 3.  “No. of Days” means the number of days between 
the due date of the principal and the date of the defendant’s first payment.  “Annual 
interest rate” means the rate you determined from Step Two on page 2. 

4.  Subtract the interest amount calculated in step 3 from the defendant’s first payment.  Then 
subtract the remainder of the defendant’s payment from the principal amount owed to you. 
This is the balance still due. 

5.  For each additional payment made by Defendant, repeat steps 1-4, except that: 
“Principal” is now the “balance still due” at the end of step 4. 
“Date principal became due” becomes the date of the defendant’s previous payment 
“No. of Days” is the number of days between the previous payment and the one you 
are currently calculating interest for 

 
 
 

6.  Calculate the interest from the date of the defendant’s last payment to the date you file 

your Default Affidavit.  Add this to the previous balance due and show the final balance due. 

EXAMPLE 

 

1.  Principal amount and date it became due:  $1,000 due March 16, 2018 

2.  Defendant’s first payment (after complaint filed):  $100 on September 22, 2018

     For That Period 

  $26.03    =

5.  Defendant’s second payment:  $200 on October 22, 2018 

  $926.03    x

No. of Days

$200 Payment  –  $3.81 Interest = $196.19 to be applied to balance due 

$926.03 Balance Due  –  $196.19 Payment = $729.84 Balance Due as of October 22 

6.  Interest from second payment to date of Default Affidavit (November 22, 2018):
