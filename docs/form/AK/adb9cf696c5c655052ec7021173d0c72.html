      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS:  HOW TO ASK THE COURT  
TO APPOINT A TEMPORARY CONSERVATOR IN AN EMERGENCY 

Introduction 

You can find more information about conservatorship on the court’s self-help website: 
www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/guardian-conservator/index.htm.    You  can  find  all  of  the  court 
forms  referenced  in  these  instructions  at:  www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm.    You  may 
also get paper copies of court forms from your local court clerk. 

Step-by-Step Instructions to File for Emergency Conservatorship 

Step 1.  Before filing an Emergency Petition, you must first file a regular petition.   
 

For an adult, you may use any one of the following, whichever is most appropriate 
to the respondent’s situation:  
• 
• 
• 
Instructions to fill out and file these petitions are in form PG-505.   

PG-100, Petition for Appointment of a Full Guardian for an Adult 
PG-103, Petition for Appointment of a Partial Guardian for an Adult 
PG-104, Petition for Appointment of a Conservator for an Adult   

 

The court system does not currently have a petition form for requesting appointment 
of a conservator for a minor.  You will have to create your own petition for this. 
You can file both the regular petition and the emergency petition at the same time. 

Step 2. 

Fill  out Emergency Petition for Appointment of a Temporary Conservator  (PG-102).  
The paragraphs below explain certain sections of this form in more detail.  

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

 

e. 

Fill in the top of the form the same as you did on the regular petition.  

Case Number.  If you are filing this emergency petition at the same time you 
file the regular petition, leave the “CASE NO.” line blank.  If you are filing this 
emergency  petition  later,  write  the  case  number  that  the  court  assigned  to 
the regular petition. 

Section 4.  Explain where the respondent is currently located.  Describe what 
the place is (for example: “at his apartment” or “at her daughter’s house”), 
and then give the address and telephone number of that place. 

Section 5.  Check at least one box.  Describe the money or property that is in 
danger of being wasted or dissipated (used up), or the source of the money 
that is needed for support.1  Be as specific and complete as possible.   
To get a temporary (emergency) appointment, you must show that 
the  money  is  needed  immediately  for  support,  care,  or  welfare  of 
the  respondent’s  self  or  other  persons  the  respondent  has  a  legal 
duty  to  support,  or  that  the  respondent’s  money  or  property  is  in 
danger of being lost or used up.   

Section 6.  Explain why the respondent is not able to  manage or obtain the 
money or property on the respondent’s own.2  Be as specific and complete as 
possible. 

                                                 
1  AS 13.26.445.  
2  Reasons include: “mental illness, mental deficiency, physical illness or disability, advanced age, chronic 
use of drugs, chronic intoxication, fraud, confinement, detention by a foreign power, or disappearance.”  
AS 13.26.401(2)(A).  A person may also need a conservator because of the disabilities of minority (being 
under age 18).  AS 13.26.401(1).

Section 8.  You can nominate the same person or agency you nominated in 
the  regular  petition,  or  it  can  be  a  different  person  or  agency  just  for  the 
temporary conservatorship.   

Sign and date in the area just before the “Verification.” 

If you are filing in person, wait to sign the Verification section until you are at 
the  court.    Bring  a  photo  ID  with  you.    The  court  clerk  can  notarize  your 
petition for free.  If you are mailing the emergency petition to the court, fill 
out the Verification section (in front of a notary public) before you mail it.   

i. 

Certificate of Service on page 3.   

If  you  are  filing  this  emergency  petition  at  the  same  time  as  the  regular 
petition to open the case, then check the first box and sign at the bottom. 

If  the  conservatorship  case  is  already  open,  and  before  you  file  the 
emergency petition in court, you must make a reasonable effort to notify the 
respondent, the respondent’s attorney, the court visitor (if one is appointed), 
and any other persons the court ordered you to notify, that you are going to 
file  this  petition.    Because  it  is  an  emergency,  you  may  use  extraordinary 
service  methods,  such  as  a  phone  call,  instead  of  mail.    Check  the  second 
box on this page and explain the efforts you made to give notice, then sign 
at the bottom. 

Step 3.  Make  a  copy  of  the  emergency  petition  for  yourself  to  keep.    File  the  original 
emergency petition (either in person or by mail) at the same court where you filed 
the regular petition.  There is no separate filing fee for the emergency petition.  It is 
covered by the filing fee you paid (or will pay) for the regular petition. 

Step 4.  Notice of Hearing.  

 

The court clerk will schedule a hearing on your petition to be held within 72 hours 
after you file it.  The clerk will send or give notice of the hearing to you, the 
respondent, the respondent’s attorney, the court visitor (if one is appointed), the 
proposed conservator, and any other interested persons as ordered by the court.   

Step 5.  Court Hearing. 

The  respondent  has  the  right  to  be  present  at  the  hearing.  The  respondent  can 
participate in the hearing by telephone if that is more convenient for the respondent. 
Usually these hearings are closed to the public.  At the hearing, the respondent has 
the right to present evidence and to ask questions of any witnesses.  

As the petitioner, you must present evidence that proves BOTH (1) and (2) 
below:  
(1) 

The respondent needs a temporary conservator to either 
(a)  prevent the waste or dissipation (using up) of the respondent’s money 

or property, or 

(b)  obtain  funds  that  are  needed  for  the  immediate  support,  care,  and 
welfare of the respondent (or other persons the respondent is required 
to support),  

AND 
The  respondent  is  not  able  to  protect  the  respondent’s  own  funds  or 
property,  or  is  not  able  to  obtain  the  funds  that  are  needed  to  support  the 
respondent’s self (or other persons the respondent is required to support). 

(2) 

The statute that requires this, AS 13.26.445, is printed on the next page.

AS 13.26.445 & .415(c) 
 
 

Step 6.  When the Appointment Ends. 

If the judge signs an emergency appointment order, the order will be temporary.  It 
will  expire  when  the  court  appoints  a  regular  conservator  (or  a  full  or  partial 
guardian with conservator powers), or if the court dismisses the regular petition for 
conservator or guardian appointment. 

Alaska Statute 13.26.445 
Temporary Conservators 

(a)    If,  during  the  pendency  of  an  initial  petition  for  conservatorship,  it  appears  that  the 
respondent  is  in  need  of  a  protective  order  to  protect  the  respondent  against  waste  or 
dissipation  of  funds  or  property,  or  to  obtain  funds  that  are  needed  for  the  immediate 
support,  care,  and  welfare  of  the  respondent  or  persons  entitled  to  be  supported  by  the 
respondent,  and  the  respondent  is  not  capable  of  protecting  the  respondent's  funds  or 
property  or  obtaining  the  funds  that  are  needed  to  support  the  respondent  or  persons 
whom the respondent is required to support, the petitioner may request the appointment of 
a temporary conservator to authorize the protection or to obtain the necessary funds. The 
request  must  state  the  reasons  and  factual  basis  for  the  request.  The  petitioner  shall 
immediately  file  the  request  with  the  court  and  serve  copies  on  the  respondent  and  the 
respondent's attorney and other persons as ordered by the court. The court shall appoint an 
attorney for a respondent who is unrepresented to be at the hearing and conduct a hearing 
within 72 hours after the filing. 

(b)  If the court determines that a temporary conservator should be appointed, it shall make 
the  appointment  and  grant  to  the  temporary  conservator  only  the  authority  that  is  least 
restrictive upon the liberty of the respondent and that enables the temporary conservator to 
provide  the  protection  or  authority  necessary  to  protect  the  respondent  from  waste  or 
dissipation of funds or property or to obtain the funds necessary for support. 

(c)  The temporary conservatorship expires at the time of the appointment of a full or partial 
conservator or on the dismissal of the petition for conservatorship. 

Two alternative procedures that can be used in case of financial emergencies are: 

Alternatives to Temporary Conservatorship 

1. 

2. 

Ex  Parte  Financial  Protective  Orders.    Under  AS  13.26.450,  you  may  file  a  protective 
order on behalf of the person who needs protection against another person or persons 
(or even a  business or other group).   This procedure can be  used when you  think the 
other  person  (or  business  or  group)  is  committing  fraud  against  the  person  to  be 
protected.    It  can  prohibit  contact  with  the  protected  person  and  overrule  powers  of 
attorney, among other things.  More information and forms for this process are available 
here: http://www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#financial-abuse. 

Protective  Arrangements  and  Single  Transactions.    Under  AS  13.26.440,  the  court  can 
order  a  specific  money  transfer,  loan,  sale,  entry  into  contract,  or  other  financial 
transaction  directly.    This  procedure  may  be  suitable  when  a  limited  solution  will  take 
care of the immediate problem (for example: to complete the sale of a home, to arrange 
and pay for a specific service, or to transfer money from one account into another), and 
a  conservator  is  not  needed  for  ongoing  financial  management.    The  court  does  not 
have specific forms to ask for this type of order, but you can create your own petition 
just  for  this  transaction  (without  filing  for  a  guardian  or  conservator),  or  you  may 
include this request in your regular petition for conservatorship or guardianship.   If the 
transaction  must  occur  quickly,  you  can  file  PG-108, Motion for Hearing on Shortened 
me under Probate Rule 14.1, to ask for a faster hearing.
