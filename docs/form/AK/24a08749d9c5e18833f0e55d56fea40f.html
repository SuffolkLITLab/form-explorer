      <pre>What if  the GAL does not 
do a good job?

If  you think the GAL is not doing a good 
job, you should ﬁ rst try to tell the GAL 
what you think should be done, and ask why 
the GAL is not doing that.

If  this still does not help, you should tell 
either your social worker, if  you have one, 
or the judge.  Parents who are unhappy with 
their child’s GAL should tell their lawyer, 
the social worker, or the judge.

Does the GAL go to court?

Yes.  The GAL goes to court.  In some 
cases the GAL might be a witness who 
answers questions asked by the lawyers for 
the other people in court, or the GAL may 
ask other witnesses questions.

If  the child is not present at court hearings, the 
GAL will tell the child what happened, as soon 
as possible after the court hearing, or arrange for 
someone else to tell the child.

What can I do to help the GAL?

A GAL needs a lot of  help to do a good job of  
representing a child’s best interests.
The child can help the GAL most by trying to trust 
the GAL and by trying to tell the GAL everything 
he or she asks about.  If  the child forgets to tell 
the GAL something important, the child should 
call the GAL, or have someone else make the call.  
If  anything changes, the child should let the GAL 
know about it.
Everyone else who is concerned about the child or 
who knows something important about the child can 
help by staying in touch with the GAL.
If  the GAL has not called you, you should call the 
GAL.

Does the child have to go to 
court too?

How do I ﬁ nd out if  there is a 
GAL?

What is a 
Guardian 
Ad Litem ?

Sometimes the child has to be in the 
courtroom.  Other times the child just 
comes to the court building, in case anyone 
wants to ask him or her any questions.  
Sometimes, the child does not need to be in 
court at all.

The GAL should ﬁ nd out how the child 
feels about being in court, and may tell the 
judge.  If  the child is going to be in court, 
or in the court building, the GAL may take 
the child for a visit ﬁ rst, so it is not so scary.

4

You can ﬁ nd out if  there is a GAL by asking the 
court clerk, the child’s social worker, or the lawyers 
who are already taking part in the court case, if  there 
is one.

What does guardian ad litem 
mean?

Guardian ad litem (GAL) is a legal term 
meaning guardian for the duration of  a court 
case or legal proceeding.

Who can be a GAL?

Anyone who cares about children and who can 
help the court make good decisions can be a 
GAL.  Often lawyers are GALs.  The judge 
chooses the GAL.

What is a GAL supposed to 
do?

A GAL is supposed to represent the best 
interests of  the child in court.  That means 
making sure the judge is told:
•  what has happened to the child,
•  what the child needs to be happy and safe, 

•  what decisions the judge can make to help 

and

the child.

Why does a child need a GAL?

Whenever a judge has to make decisions about 
what will happen to a child, the child may need 
a GAL.
For example, children whose parents are 
getting a divorce often have a GAL if  there are 
questions about the custody arrangements for 
the child.  A GAL is sometimes appointed for 
a child in adoption proceedings (Adoption Rule 
7), delinquency cases (Del. Rule 15), and when 
a child needs to testify in court as a victim or a 
witness (Alaska Statute 12.45.046).

A child might also need a GAL if  someone 
other than the child’s parents wants custody 
of  the child, if  a judge is asked to decide who 
the child’s father is, or if  the child might own 
property. 
The law requires that a GAL be appointed 
whenever a child is admitted to a designated 
mental health treatment facility.  (Alaska 
Statute 47.30.690).  And, in a child in need 
of  aid proceeding, where a child’s parent may 
have abused or neglected him or her, the court 
must appoint a GAL for the child.  CINA Rule 
11.

Does every child have a GAL?

No.  Sometimes the law requires that a GAL 
be appointed.  In other instances, the court 
decides whether a child needs a GAL and 
appoints the GAL.  Anyone can ask the judge 
to appoint a GAL for a child.  The judge can 
be asked in court or by letter.

Who pays for the GAL?

The judge decides who will pay for the 
GAL.  Sometimes the child’s parents pay, and 
sometimes the state pays.

Does a GAL always ask the 
judge to do what the child 
wants done?

No.  The GAL always listens to the child, but 
the GAL must decide whether what the child 
wants is really the best.
Sometimes the GAL and the child do not 
agree.  Then the GAL has to make up his or 
her own mind about what is best for the child.  

The GAL will tell the judge what the GAL 
thinks is really best for the child.

Does the GAL get to make 
the decisions at the court 
hearings?

No.  The judge makes the decisions after 
listening carefully to everyone who took part 
in the court hearing.  Like the other people, the 
GAL is only allowed to make suggestions about 
what should happen.

How does a GAL decide what 
is best for the child?

The GAL talks with everyone who knows a 
lot about the child.  This includes the child, 
the child’s parents, relatives, foster parents, 
teachers, social workers, psychologists, doctors, 
and others.
The GAL reads reports written about the child 
and the child’s family.  The GAL sometimes 
asks other professionals to help the GAL learn 
about the child.
The GAL visits where the child lives, and 
wherever the child might go live, or the GAL 
asks someone else to visit.
The GAL also learns about the services 
available where the child and family live.
