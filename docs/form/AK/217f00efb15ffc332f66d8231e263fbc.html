HOW TO FILE A LEVEL 3 APPEAL  
AFTER AETNA OR OPTUMRx DENIED YOUR LEVEL 2 APPEAL 

INTRODUCTION 

What is this 
packet for? 

Use this packet: 
 

If you want to appeal a health claim that Aetna or OptumRx denied or partially 
denied, or a pre-certification request that Aetna or OptumRx denied; and  
  You already submitted level 1 and 2 appeals that were denied by Aetna or 

OptumRx (and/or their external review company); and 

  You are an active employee of the Alaska Court System or a dependent. 

Do not use this packet: 
  This packet is not for emergency appeals.  For help with emergency appeals, 

refer to the health PLAN or e-mail the Healthcare Advocates.  

  This packet is not for dental or vision appeals.  For help with those, refer to 

the health PLAN or e-mail the Healthcare Advocates.  

  This packet is not for level 1 appeals to Aetna or OptumRx.  Use form HCA-

100, Health Appeal Packet 1 for those. 

  This packet is not for level 2 appeals or requests for external review.  For 

those, use form HCA-200, Health Appeal Packet 2.   

  This packet is also not for appeals to superior court.  Use form HCA-400, 

Health Appeal Packet 4 for those. 

What are 
the basic 
steps for 
appealing?  

The active employee health plan for 2018 includes a new level of appeal.     
For services received on or after January 1, 2018, there are 4 levels of appeal.  
This includes 2 appeals through Aetna or OptumRx, 1 appeal to DRB, and then 
1 appeal to court. (For services received before January 1, 2018, there are 3 
levels of appeal.) You must go through each level of appeal in the correct 
order, and on time. You may withdraw your appeal at any step.  

Step 1 is a LEVEL 1 APPEAL to Aetna for health claims or OptumRx for pharmacy 
claims.  For level 1 appeals, use form HCA-100, Health Appeal Packet 1.  If your 
level 1 appeal is granted, then you won, and the process is finished.  If your level 
1 appeal is denied, then go to step 2.   

Step 2 will be either a LEVEL 2 APPEAL or a REQUEST FOR EXTERNAL REVIEW, 
depending on the reason why your level 1 appeal was denied.  For step 2, use 
HCA-200, Health Appeal Packet 2. 

his packet 
is for step 3. 

Step 3 is only for services received on or after January 1, 2018, and is a LEVEL 3 
APPEAL to DRB.  For step 3, use this packet.  If DRB denies your level 3 review, 
then go to Step 4. 

Step 4 is filing an appeal to SUPERIOR COURT if you do not win at step 3.   
For appeals to superior court, use form HCA-400, Health Appeal Packet 4.

LEVEL 3 PROCESS 

What 
happens at 
level 3? 

Your level 3 paperwork is sent to the Division of Retirement & Benefits (DRB) 
instead of to Aetna or OptumRx.  After DRB receives your paperwork, DRB will 
determine whether your claim should have been covered under the terms of your 
medical plan.  If your claim was denied based on medical judgment, then the DRB 
may require a second external review or review by an internal medical director.   
If your level 3 appeal is denied by DRB, then you can use the level 4 packet to file 
in Superior Court.  

DEADLINE FOR SUBMITTING THE LEVEL 3 APPEAL 

When is my 
level 3 
appeal due? 

You have a limited amount of time to submit your level 3 appeal.  IMPORTANT!!!  
Your level 3 appeal must be received by the DRB within 60 calendar days of the 
date that the level 2 denial letter was issued or the date of the first external 
review.  

alculate your deadline using the date of Aetna’s or OptumRx’s level 1 appeal 

denial letter.  For a medical necessity denial, count ahead 4 months from the date 
of the denial letter.   

LEVEL 3 APPEAL OF HEALTH CLAIM 

Prepare the 
level 3 
appeal. 

If the services or pre-certification denial were received on or after January 1, 
2018, and Aetna or OptumRx, or their external review company denied your level 
2 appeal, you can file a level 3 appeal by following these steps:  

1.  FILL OUT FORM HCA-105  to prepare your level 3 appeal.   

2.  GATHER  ANY SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS  that you want to include in your 

level 3 appeal. 

3.  MAKE A COPY FOR YOUR RECORDS OF ALL LEVEL 3 DOCUMENTS THAT YOU 
SUBMIT IN CASE YOU DECIDE TO APPEAL TO SUPERIOR COURT LATER.  

4.  SUBMIT YOUR LEVEL 3 APPEAL TO DRB.  Make sure to send your level 3 
appeal by fax with a confirmation sheet, or by U.S. mail with delivery 
confirmation.  You need to be able to prove that Aetna or OptumRx received it 
within the appeal deadline. 

5.  KEEP TRACK OF YOUR LEVEL 3 APPEAL. DRB will issue a written decision 

within 60 calendar days after the receipt of your level 3 appeal.  

RB will mail you a letter with the results of your level 3 appeal.  If DRB denies 
your level 3 appeal and if you wish to continue the process to the end, please see 
form HCA-400, Health Appeal Packet 4, or email the healthcare advocates at: 
HealthcareAdvocates@akcourts.us.  

 

 

When in doubt, email the healthcare advocates at

APPEAL OF HEALTH CLAIM OR PRECERTIFICATION DENIAL 
This form is for active employees (not retirees) of the Alaska Court System and their dependents who 
wish to appeal health claim or precertification denials by Aetna or OptumRx. 

WHAT LEVEL APPEAL IS THIS? 

For more information about appealing your claims, call DRB at 1-800-821-2251; or review the health plan at 
http://doa.alaska.gov/drb/alaskacare/employee/publications/booklet.html; or email the Healthcare Advocates at 
healthcareadvocates@akcourts.us. If you are not satisfied with the administrative appeal decisions, you may 
appeal to Superior Court.  See appeal form packets HCA-100, HCA-200, HCA-300, and HCA-400.] 
 

  Level 1 Appeal to 

 Aetna  

 OptumRx 

 Check this box if this is an urgent appeal

Check this box if this is your Level 1 (first) appeal of a claim denied in full or in part by Aetna for health 
services or OptumRx for drugs.  Level 1 appeals must be received by Aetna or OptumRx within 180 calendar 
days of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) “statement date” or denial letter.  You may use this online 
calculator to calculate the due date. 

  Level 2 Appeal to 

 Aetna  

 OptumRx 

 Check this box if this is an urgent appeal

Check this Level 2 box if all of these statements are true: 
a.  You are not satisfied with the level 1 appeal decision by Aetna or OptumRx; and 
b.  For Aetna claims only, Aetna’s level 1 decision was based on something other than Aetna’s “medical 

opinion” (for example, Aetna says your doctor’s charges are more than the “recognized charge,” or the 
service you received is not covered by the plan, or that they need more records from your doctor); and 

c.  You want to appeal to level 2. 
Level 2 appeals go to Aetna for denied health services or OptumRx for denied drugs, and must be received by 
Aetna or OptumRx within 180 calendar days of the date of the Level 1 decision.  You may use this online 
calculator to calculate the due date. 

  Level 2 Request for External Review to Aetna 

 Check this box if this is an urgent appeal

* 

Check this box if all of these statements are true: 
a.  You are not satisfied with the level 1 appeal decision by Aetna; and 
b.  Aetna’s level 1 decision was based on Aetna’s “medical opinion” or Aetna’s level 1 denial letter talks 

about “medical necessity” (for example, they say your procedure was not medically necessary, or it was 
experimental or investigational, or something else involving Aetna’s medical or clinical opinion); and 

c.  You want to request review by an independent external review company. 
Requests for external review must be submitted to Aetna no later than 4 months after you receive the level 1 
denial letter.  Aetna is supposed to send a copy of their form for requesting these but they don’t always do 
that.  If you do not receive a form from Aetna, use this form or form HCA-205 instead, or email the 
Healthcare Advocates. 

  Level 3 Appeal to DRB (new for 2018) 

 Check this box if this is an urgent appeal

* 

Check this box if all of these statements are true: 
a.  You are appealing denial of services or pre-service request provided on or after January 1, 2018; and 
b.  You are not satisfied with the level 2 appeal denied by Aetna or OptumRx, or you are not satisfied with 

the external review by Aetna; and 

c.  You want to appeal to level 3. 
Level 3 only applies to services received after 2017.  For services received before 2018, skip level 3 and go 
directly to level 4 (appeal to superior court).  Level 3 appeals go to the Division of Retirement & Benefits 
(DRB) and must be received by the DRB within 60 calendar days of the date of the external review or level 2 
decision.  You may use this online calculator to calculate the due date.

WHAT CLAIMS ARE BEING APPEALED?
AETNA APPEALS: When a doctor sends  a bill to Aetna for payment, Aetna creates an “explanation of benefits” 
(EOB) statement. Find EOBs at https://www.Aetna.com/ after logging in.  Every EOB has a statement date in the 
top right corner of the 1st page; and every claim on the EOB has a claim ID number.  Every letter from Aetna 
denying precertification has a case number.   OPTUMRx APPEALS: You will learn of an OptumRx denial because 
your pharmacist tells you or you receive a denial letter from OptumRx.  There may or may not be a case number, 
but try and fill out the information below.  For more information, email HealthcareAdvocates@akcourts.us.

DATA AND DOCUMENTS REQUESTED AS PART OF THIS APPEAL 

Recognized charge.  This paragraph applies if my claim(s) were denied in whole or part as above the 
“recognized charge.”  The database used for setting the recognized charge is inconsistent with any usual, 
customary, reasonable, or prevailing rate in the geographic area where the services were performed.  The 
plan relies on data from a database known to be incomplete, inaccurate, and indefensible.  I request the 
following as part of my appeal:  (1) For each of the past 36 months, how many actual claims were submitted 
by Alaska providers on behalf of active and retired AlaskaCare plan members for each of the same CPTs or 
medications denied in whole or part as above the recognized charge in my claim?  And of these actual 
claims submitted, how many were denied in whole or part as above the recognized charge?  (2) Which 
FairHealth update (May or November, and of what year) was used to process the claims I am appealing?  (3) 
Was “derived data” used to determine the recognized charge for my claims?  If so, for each CPT or 
medication, how many frequencies were in the database on the date my claims were processed and what 
were the actual provider charge amounts and dates of each of those frequencies?  (4) Provide me with a 
copy of all correspondence between any employee of the Alaska Dept. of Administration and any employee 
of Aetna or OptumRx about any of the following: FairHealth, any rate-setting database other than 
FairHealth, and Aetna’s or OptumRx’s reimbursement policies and practices regarding the recognized charge 
or similar rate-setting tool or process.  (5)  Provide a copy of the contract or letter of agreement between 
Alaska and Aetna, or for pharmacy claims between Alaska and OptumRx in effect on the dates of service 
associated with my claims.  (6) Identify the Medicare reimbursement rate in effect on the dates of service 
for the CPTs or medications at issue in my claim.  (7) Identify and provide a copy of every other document or 
source of information other than the FairHealth database that was used to process my claims.  

Proprietary guidelines or clinical policy bulletins.  This paragraph applies if my claim or claims were denied 
because of information in proprietary documents or guidelines (for example, the MCG Guidelines or the 
Milliman Medicare Repricer) or a clinical policy bulletin.  Please follow all necessary protocols and promptly 
release the documents and guidelines to me because they are being used to my detriment.   

.  Medical records.  This paragraph applies if my medical records were overlooked or ignored by Aetna or 

OptumRx or its external review organization in making the adverse benefit determination referenced in this 
appeal.  Provide a copy of my medical records (1) in Aetna’s  or OptumRx’s possession or control whether or 
not used to process my claim, and (2) actually reviewed or used by Aetna’s or OptumRx’s system, external 
review organization, or employee to process my claim.  In addition, if Aetna’s or OptumRx’s system 
processed my claim, I ask that this appeal and my future claims be processed by a human instead.   

Network steerage.  This paragraph applies if my claim(s) were denied in whole or part as out of network.  
Provide all information used in determining that my provider was out of network.  If non-network facility 
penalties were applied to my claim(s), confirm that the penalties were applied pursuant to my plan(s) and 
the law, and for facilities in Anchorage or the other 49 states.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
