      <pre>REGISTERING A SUPPORT ORDER IN ALASKA THAT WAS 
ISSUED BY ANOTHER STATE, U.S. TERRITORY, OR TRIBE 

INSTRUCTIONS 

What are these 
instructions for? 

These instructions explain how to register a child support or other support 
order from another state, U.S. territory, or Indian tribe.  These instructions 
do not address registration of support orders from other countries.  For 
information about modifying another state’s child support order after 
registration, see page 6. 

What is the law? 

A support order issued by another state can be registered in Alaska and 
then enforced as if it had been issued by an Alaska court.  The statutes that 
describe the registration procedure are AS 25.25.601 - .614.1 

Where are the 
forms? 

The forms in these instructions are all available on the Alaska Court System 
website at http://courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#dr. 

Alaska Child 
Support Services 
Division (CSSD) 
can help you. 

Hiring a lawyer? 

If you just want to enforce another state’s child support order in Alaska, 
consider contacting your state’s child support services agency or Alaska’s 
CSSD for help. See Application for Services of CSSD. Phone: (907) 269-6900. 
CSSD can also help modify another state’s child support order if it was an 
administrative order issued by another state’s child support services agency 
and, in a few circumstances, if it was issued by a court in another state.2 
However, in most cases, if you want to modify a child support order issued 
by a court in another state, you must register the order first and then file a 
motion to modify the order as explained on page 6. 

If you are unsure whether to hire a lawyer to register or modify your order, 
you may want to talk to one before you decide whether you can handle it 
alone.  If you do not know a lawyer, you can call or write:  

Lawyer Referral Service of the Alaska Bar Association  
P.O. Box 100279, Anchorage, AK 99510-0279  
Phone: 272-0352 or 800-770-9999 outside Anchorage (toll free in Alaska) 

Also, the Alaska Bar Association keeps a list of lawyers who offer “unbundled 
legal services” in the family law area (support, custody, divorce, etc.) at 
www.alaskabar.org under the “For the Public” tab.  Unbundling (sometimes 
called “discrete task representation”) offers clients a middle ground between 
having no lawyer at all and paying a lawyer for the full service package.  A 
lawyer offering unbundled services would only handle part of a case, such as 
drafting a motion, reviewing an agreement, or attending one specific 
hearing, rather than the entire matter. 

1  AS 25.25.601 - .614.  These statutes are part of Alaska's version of the Uniform Interstate Family 

Support Act (UIFSA). The UIFSA has been adopted by all the states in the United States.  It establishes 
which state has the authority to issue a support order in a particular case and the procedure for 
enforcing and modifying orders issued by other states.

REGISTERING SUPPORT ORDER FROM ANOTHER STATE, U.S. TERRITORY, OR TRIBE – INSTRUCTIONS 

Cost of the 
proceedings 

There is no filing fee for petitioning to register a support order from another 
state or filing a motion to modify it.3  However, there may be costs for
notifying the other party about your petition.  The court will serve the notice 
on the other party but if you want the court to use a method other than first 
class mail, you will have to pay for that. (See page 4.) 

Definitions 

Here are definitions of some key words used a lot in this process: 

 Obligee is the person to whom support payments are owed.  This is

the person who is to receive child support.

 Obligor is the person required to pay child support.
 Petitioner is the person asking to register the order.
 Respondent is the person to whom the notice of registration must be

sent, usually the person who owes the support.

 State  means  a  state  of  the  United  States,  the  District  of  Columbia,
Puerto  Rico,  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands,  or  any  territory  or  insular
possession  subject  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  United  States;  the  term
"state" also includes an Indian nation or tribe.4

 Support  order  means  a  judgment,  decree,  order,  decision,  or
directive,  whether  temporary,  final,  or  subject  to  modification,  issued
in  a  state  or  foreign  country  for  the  benefit  of  a  child,  a  current
spouse,  or  an  ex-spouse,  that  provides  for  money  support,  health
care,  arrearages,  retroactive  support,  or  reimbursement  for  financial
assistance  provided  to  an  individual  obligee  in  place  of  child  support.
A "support order" may include related costs and fees, interest, income
withholding,  automatic  adjustment,  reasonable  attorney  fees,  and
other relief.5

REGISTERING SUPPORT ORDER FROM ANOTHER STATE, U.S. TERRITORY, OR TRIBE – INSTRUCTIONS 

Step 2 
Decide how you 
want the court to 
give notice to the 
other party. 

Decide how you want the Notice of Registration given to the other party.  
The court must give the other party notice of your request to register a 
support order from another state.  You can ask the court to give the notice in 
one of the following ways (called “service”): 

First class mail, or


 Certified mail, or


Personal delivery by a process server or peace officer.

If you want proof that the other party received the notice, you must select 
service by either certified mail or process server, and you must pay the cost. 
There is no charge for delivery by first class mail.  

a)  First Class Mail.  If you pick first class mail, you must prepare a 9 x 12 

envelope addressed to the respondent.  Do not put a return address on 
the envelope. 

b)  Certified Mail.  If you pick certified mail, you must go to the Post Office 
and get the forms for certified mail (the certified mail receipt and the 
green card) and enough stamps to pay for: 

 Certified mail, and
 Restricted delivery, and
 Return receipt requested

On the green card, put your return address in the “Sender” box.  Write 
the court case number below the “Sender” box.  Put the stamps on the 
envelope and bring it to court with the completed certified mail forms. 

Important:  If you don't provide the correct stamped envelope or the 
completed certified mail forms, your paperwork will be rejected. 
You must also pay the court a $5.00 certified mail processing fee.7  For 
more instructions about certified mail, see page 3 in the booklet How to 
Serve a Summons in a Civil Lawsuit (CIV-106) on the Alaska Court 
System website. 

c)  Process Server.  If you pick delivery by a process server, read the 

instructions on page 1 of the booklet, How to Serve a Summons in a 
C
Lawsuit (CIV-106), on the Alaska Court System website.  Pick a 
 
i
l
v
i
process server.  Fill out the Service Instructions (CIV-615) form.  Pay 
the process server’s fee directly to the process server. 

Prepare a letter-size envelope with postage affixed, addressed to yourself. 
The court will use this envelope to mail a copy of the notice (but not the 
attachments) to you. 

Make a copy of the Petition and the order for yourself. 

Step 3 
Address an 
envelope to 
yourself. 

Step 4 
Keep a copy.

Page 4 of 7 
DR-341 (2/19)(cs) 
REGISTERING SUPPORT ORDER FROM ANOTHER STATE, U.S. TERRITORY, OR TRIBE – INSTRUCTIONS 

Step 5 
File documents 
with court. 

Step 6 
Wait to see if a 
hearing is 
requested. 

Step 7 
What if a hearing 
is requested? 

File the following at the superior court filing location you wrote on the forms: 

a) original Petition; and
b) copies of the order; and
c) other documents listed in Step 1; and
d) the envelope or service instructions described in Step 2; and
e) the envelope described in Step 3.

You can deliver these documents to the court in person or by mail. There is 
no filing fee.8 

The court will send the Notice of Registration and other documents to the 
other party (the respondent) using the method you chose.  The other party 
has 20 days to request a hearing to contest the registration.  The 20 days 
begin on either the date the court mailed the notice or the date the notice 
was personally served on the other party. 

If the other party asks for a hearing, the court will schedule a hearing and 
notify both of you.9   

At the hearing, the other party must prove at least one of these defenses: 

a) the court or agency that issued the order did not have personal

jurisdiction10 over him or her;
b) the order was obtained by fraud;
the order was vacated, suspended, or modified by a later order;
c)
d) the court or agency that issued the support order stopped (“stayed”)

the order pending appeal;

e) there is a defense under the laws of Alaska to the remedy sought;
f)

the stated arrearage amount is wrong because he or she made full or
partial payment; or

g) a statute of limitation of Alaska or the issuing state precludes

enforcement of some or all of the arrearages;

h) the alleged controlling order is not the controlling order.

You can testify, call witnesses to testify, and give the court documents to 
support your position.   

If the other party cannot prove at least one of the defenses listed above, the 
court will issue an order confirming registration of the support order.11   

8  AS 25.25.301 & .313; Administrative Rule 9(b)(8) 
9  AS 25.25.606(c) 
10 In general, a state court has “personal jurisdiction” over a person if the person is (a) present in the 

state when served notice of the case, (b) domiciled in the state, or (c) engaged in substantial activities 
in the state.  Generally, “domicile” means a person’s primary residence to which the person intends to 
return whenever the person is away.

REGISTERING SUPPORT ORDER FROM ANOTHER STATE, U.S. TERRITORY, OR TRIBE – INSTRUCTIONS 

Do you want to 
attend the 
hearing by 
telephone? 

Step 8 
No hearing 
requested? 

If you do not live near the city where the court is located or circumstances 
make it impossible for you to attend the hearing in person, you may ask to 
participate in the hearing by telephone.  Fill out form TF-710, Request to 
Appear by Telephone, and send it to the court.  Fill out the box to the left of 
the case number with the same information as is in your petition to register. 
Send a copy of your request to the other party and indicate that you have 
done this in the “I certify…” section under your email address. 

If the other party does not request a hearing, the court will issue an order 
confirming registration of the support order. 

ENFORCING A REGISTERED ORDER 
Enforcing an 
order after it is 
registered 

If the obligor (person required to pay support) does not pay the support 
after the order is registered:  

a) With CSSD’s Help.  If the order you registered is for child support, you
can ask the Alaska Child Support Services Division (CSSD) to enforce the
order.  CSSD can also enforce a spousal support order if CSSD is
enforcing a child support order.12  Find an application for CSSD services
online at: www.childsupport.alaska.gov.  Click on “CSSD Forms.”   If you
do not live in Alaska, you can also contact your local child support
agency.

b) Without CSSD’s Help. You can ask the court to issue a judgment for

past-due child support and then request a writ of execution to collect the
judgment.  To get the judgment for past-due support, file a motion in
your registration case, serve a copy on the obligor, and respond to any
opposition the obligor files.  For help with this, you can contact Alaska’s
Family Law Self-Help Center.  For contact information and hours, see
http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/shcabout.htm#1b.

MODIFYING A REGISTERED ORDER 
I want to register 
an order because 
I want to change 
it. 

If you are registering the support order with the court so you can ask the 
court to modify it (or both enforce and modify it), you need to file a motion 
with the court.  You can file this motion when you file your petition to 
register or later.  You can use the DR-361, Motion to Modify Another State’s 
Child Support Order.   Instructions about how to fill out and file the form are 
included in the form. The DR-360, Motion to Modify Packet, is available on 
the court system’s website.
