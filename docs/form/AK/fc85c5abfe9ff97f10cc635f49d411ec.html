      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS:   
HOW TO ASK THE COURT TO APPOINT A GUARDIAN FOR AN ADULT 
 
Introduction 

Appointing a  guardian  for a person is  a serious  matter.   It  takes away the person’s freedom  to 
make many of the important decisions in the person’s life.  Appointing a guardian should not be 
done unless there is no other alternative. 

These  instructions  talk  about  the  petition  for  a  full  guardian  (form  PG-100),  but  most  of  the 
information  applies  to  the  petition  for  a  partial  guardian  (form  PG-103)  and  the  petition  for  a 
conservator (form PG-104) as well.  If these instructions conflict with the particular petition form 
you are filling out, follow the instructions on the petition form. 
 

Lawyers and Representing Yourself 

Before  starting  this  process,  it  may  help  to  talk  to  a  lawyer  who  is  familiar  with  guardianship 
procedure.   If  you are unsure about whether  you should hire a lawyer,  many lawyers will do a 
free or low-cost consultation for a short period of time to help you decide if it is a good idea to 
have legal help in your case.  If you do not know a lawyer, you can call or write: 

Lawyer Referral Service of the Alaska Bar Association 
P.O. Box 100279 
Anchorage, AK  99510-0279 
Anchorage Phone: 272-0352 
Statewide Phone: 800-770-9999 (toll free within Alaska) 

You can also read more about the guardianship process on the court’s self-help website here: 
http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/guardian-conservator/index.htm.  The website contains many links to 
classes and other resources.  All of the forms in these instructions may be requested from your 
local court and are also available online: http://www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm.  The 
court operates a Guardianship Helpline if you need further assistance: (907) 264-0520.  The 
helpline is open Monday to Thursday from 8 AM to 5 PM, and Fridays from 8 AM to 12 Noon. 
 

Petitioner: 

Definitions of Some Terms Used in These Instructions1 
Incapacitated Person  A  person  whose  ability  to  receive  and  evaluate  information  or  to 
communicate decisions is impaired.  This impairment is so extensive that 
the person is not able to provide at a basic level for the person’s physical 
health or safety (healthcare, food, shelter, clothing, personal hygiene, and 
protection) without court-ordered assistance. 
The person  who  starts  the case and  signs the petition asking the court to 
appoint a guardian. 
The person who is alleged to be incapacitated and in need of a guardian. 
A person who has a guardian or conservator appointed by the court.  Thus, 
the “respondent” is called a “protected person” after the judge appoints a 
guardian or conservator for the person. 
Another term (or synonym) for “protected person” that you might see on 
some  forms  or  websites.    “Ward”  is  considered  a  less  modern  term  for 
adults with  guardians, but  is  still  currently used  in  the Alaska statutes to 
describe persons under guardianship.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADULT GUARDIANSHIP PETITION 

Probate Rules 16 and 17 
AS 13.26.201-.595 

To  ask  the  court  to  appoint  a  full  guardian  for  an  adult,  fill  out  the  Petition  for 
Appointment  of  a  Full  Guardian  for  an  Adult  (form  PG-100).    The  instructions  for 
this form begin on page 7. 

To ask the court to appoint a partial guardian for an adult, fill out form PG-103.  A 
partial  guardian makes decisions on limited issues, like housing, medical  care, legal 
issues, finances, or personal services.  This is different from a full guardianship where 
the guardian makes decisions on all of those issues, but  the  court  process  is  largely 
the same.  In a partial guardianship, you only need to show that the respondent needs 
help in the areas where you are asking the partial guardian to have decision authority.   

To  ask  the  court  to  appoint  a  conservator  for  an  adult,  fill  out  form  PG-104.    A 
conservator  makes  decisions  about  the  protected  person’s  financial  affairs  (money 
and  property),  but  not  other  areas  of  the  person’s  life.    A  conservator  could  be 
appointed because a person is incapacitated (as required for a guardian), but there are 
also  other  reasons  that qualify, such  as  when the protected person has  a physical  or 
legal  barrier  preventing  access  to  accounts  or  important  documents  (see  AS 
13.26.401).  The procedure for appointing a conservator is similar, but not identical, 
to appointing a guardian. 

If  this  is  an  emergency,  also  fill  out  the  Emergency  Petition  (form  PG-101)  for 
appointment  of  a  temporary  guardian.    See  form  PG-525  for  more  detailed 
instructions about the emergency petition.   

Note:  A  situation  qualifies  as  an  emergency  only  if  the  respondent  needs 
immediate services to protect the respondent against serious injury, illness, or 
disease, and the respondent is not capable of getting the necessary services on 
the  respondent’s  own.    The  emergency  appointment  is  temporary  and  the 
guardian is only authorized to get those specific emergency services.2  If your 
situation  does  not  qualify  under  this  legal  definition  of  emergency,  you  can 
still  ask  the  court  to  hear  the  petition  more  quickly  by  filing  form  PG-108, 
Motion for Hearing on Shortened Time under Probate Rule 14.1.  You must 
explain  why  the  court  should  expedite  your  case  and  not  follow  the  normal 
timeline. 

 
How to File 

tep 1. 

  S

Step 2.  Make a copy of the petition for yourself. 

Step 3. 

File the original, notarized petition at the superior court location nearest to where the 
respondent  lives  (see  list  of  court  addresses  on  page  9)3  and  pay  the  filing  fee 
according  to  Administrative  Rule  9(b)(2)(G).    You  can  deliver  the  petition  to  the 
court in person, or mail it along with the filing fee.  If you cannot afford this fee, fill 
out  and  file  form  TF-920,  Request  for  Exemption  from  Payment  of  Fees,  with  your 
petition. 

If  you  change  your  address,  email,  or  phone  number  at  any  time  after  you  file  the 
petition, be sure to notify the court in writing.  You can use form PG-195, Notice of 
Change of Contact Information. 

                                                 
2  AS 13.26.301. 
3  If the respondent has been ordered by the court to an institution, you can also file the petition in 

the same court that issued that order.

Appointment of Attorney, Visitor, and Expert.   

 
Step 5. 

 
Notifying Others About the Hearing.  

The court clerk will either give you or mail you an Order for Guardian Appointments, 
Hearing  Notice,  and  Release  of  Records.    In  this  order,  the  court  will  schedule  a 
hearing  on  your  petition  and  appoint  a  specific  person  and/or  the  Office  of  Public 
Advocacy (OPA) to perform the following three duties:4 
a. 

Attorney for Respondent.  The respondent  has a right  to  be represented by 
an  attorney  in  the  guardianship  case.    If  the  respondent  cannot  afford  an 
attorney, the court must appoint OPA to represent the respondent.   
Court Visitor.  The court visitor is a person appointed by the court to arrange 
for  necessary  evaluations  of  the  respondent.    The  visitor  will  also  interview 
the  respondent,  you  (the  petitioner),  anyone  who  asks  to  be  appointed  as 
guardian, and other people who know about the respondent’s abilities.  After 
completing these tasks, the visitor will file a written report for the court. 
Expert.    The  expert  is  a  person  who  has  expertise  in  the  area  of  the 
respondent’s alleged incapacity.  The expert will evaluate the respondent and 
the results will be passed on to the court in the visitor’s report. 

b. 

c. 

b.  

As  the  petitioner,  it  is  your  responsibility  to  notify  several  other  people  about  the 
hearing.  When you receive the order in Step 4, do the following as soon as possible: 
a. 

On page 1 of the Notice of Guardianship Hearing (form PG-115), fill in the 
date, time, and place of the hearing, and the name of the judge or master who 
will be holding the hearing. 
On page 3 of form PG-115, write the names of all the specified relatives of the 
respondent that you can locate.  Also, write the names of these other persons: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

the respondent’s conservator5 (if the respondent has one), 
the person you nominated to be the guardian and/or conservator, 
the person who currently has care and custody of the respondent, 
the respondent’s attorney (ask the court for the name and address), 
the respondent’s guardian ad litem6 (if the court appointed one),  
any other person that the court has ordered you to give notice to, and 
any other “interested person” (for example: anyone the respondent owes 
money to, anyone who has a “power of attorney” for the respondent, the 
“representative payee”  for the respondent’s social security benefits,  the 
trustee of any trust the respondent is associated with, etc.).7 

Check the boxes showing how the notice will be delivered to each person. 

 
                                                 
4  AS 13.26.226. 
5  A “conservator” is someone appointed by the court to manage the financial affairs of a person 

who cannot handle these matters alone. 

6  A  “guardian  ad  litem”  (often  referred  to  as  a  “GAL”)  is  a  person  appointed  by  the  court  to 
protect the rights of the respondent during the guardianship proceedings.  AS 13.26.041.  See 
paragraph “f” on page 2 of form PG-115 for an explanation of when the court will appoint a 
GAL and the role this person plays. 

7  See the definition of “interested person” in AS 13.06.050(26).

Make  copies  of  the  completed  form  PG-115  and  send  the  copies  to  all  the 
people  you  listed  on  page  3.    You  must  do  this  at  least  14  days  before  the 
hearing.8 

(1) 

If the respondent’s spouse and/or parents are in Alaska, you must send 
their  copy  of  form  PG-115  by  either  certified  mail  with  restricted 
delivery  or  by  process  server.  See  the  booklet  How  to  Serve  a 
Summons in a Civil Lawsuit (CIV-106) for instructions on both these 
methods.  For any spouse or parent outside Alaska, you can send them 
form PG-115 by regular first-class mail.9 

(2) 

You  can  send  form  PG-115  to  everyone  else  by  either  regular  first-
class mail or hand-delivery by you or any other adult.  If you use hand-
delivery, you must list who did the delivery. 

d. 

Proof  that  Notice  was  Given.    After  you  send  or  give  form  PG-115  to 
everyone on page 3, you must file proof with the court that you did this:   

1)  Make  a  copy  of  the  completed  and  signed  form  PG-115  for  your 
records  and  file  the  original  with  the  court.    This  is  your  proof  of 
service for all notices you sent by first-class mail or hand-delivered. 

2) 

For copies that you sent through a process server or by certified mail: 

If you used a process server, the process server will give you a 
"Return  of  Service"  which  lists  the  documents  delivered,  to 
whom they were delivered, and when they were delivered.  File 
this original "Return of Service" with the court.   Keep a copy 
for yourself.   

If you used certified mail, fill out form PG-117, Certificate of 
Service by Certified Mail.  Fill out a separate form PG-117 for 
each  person  you  served  by  certified  mail.  Attach  the  original 
green card you got back from the Post Office, showing that the 
certified mail  was  delivered to  the person  you sent  it to.   File 
the  original  form  PG-117  (with  green  card  attached)  at  the 
court.  Keep a copy of each form PG-117 for yourself.

Visitor’s Investigation and Expert’s Report. 

Within 90 days  after the petition  is filed, the visitor must file an evaluation report10 
with  the court and give a copy of it to  the respondent,  to  the respondent’s attorney, 
and to you (the petitioner).  In order to prepare this report, the visitor must investigate 
the respondent’s current situation, including the respondent’s present living situation 
and financial resources. 

The  visitor  must  give  a  copy  of  your  petition  to  the  respondent  and  explain  what  it 
means.    The  visitor  will  tell  the  respondent  about  the  respondent’s  rights,  including 
the  right  to  talk  to  an  attorney  (and/or  an  expert  in  the  field  of  the  respondent’s 
alleged incapacity) before answering any of the visitor’s questions.  The visitor will 
tell  the  respondent  how  to  contact  the  court-appointed  attorney  and  must  help  the 
respondent make contact if the respondent asks for help. 

The  visitor  will  then  ask  the  respondent  questions  to  determine  the  respondent’s 
ability  to  care  for  the  respondent’s  self  and  the  types  of  help  the  respondent  needs.  
The visitor will also interview you (the petitioner) and other people who can provide 
information needed for the visitor’s report. 

 
 
Step 7. 

The visitor will attach any report by the court-appointed expert to the visitor’s report. 
 
Response to the Visitor’s Report. 

When you receive the visitor’s report, you have 10 days to file a written response to it 
if you want to.11  If  you need more time, you can ask the court for it, but you must 
explain why you need the extra time. The respondent can also file a response within 
that 10-day time period.  The court does not currently have forms for filing a response 
to  the  visitor’s  report,  so  if  you  choose  to  file  one,  you  must  create  your  own 
document that includes: 
a. 

 

A “case caption” (top of form) like the one on page 7 (including the name and 
location of the court, the name of the case, and the case number).  Instead of 
“Petition for Appointment,” the title of your document should be “Petitioner’s 
Response to Visitor’s Report.” 
The date of the visitor’s report. 
The paragraph number of each section of the visitor’s report that you want to 
comment on and your comments on that section.  
Your signature, printed name, address, email, and daytime telephone number. 
A  certification  that  you  sent  a  copy  of  your  response  to  the  respondent’s 
attorney, the court visitor, and any other interested parties.  For example:

Court Hearing.12  

The hearing must be held within 120 days after you file your petition unless the court 
postpones the hearing for cause.13  For example, the court might need to postpone the 
hearing if additional medical examinations for the respondent are needed. 

The respondent has the right to be present at the hearing.  Usually these hearings are 
closed to the public, but the respondent has the right to choose to have it open to the 
public.  Usually the hearing is before a judge or master alone, but the respondent has 
the right to choose a jury (instead of a judge) to decide the issue of incapacity . 

At the hearing, the respondent has the right to present evidence and to ask questions 
of any witness.  The respondent can remain silent (and not answer any questions) if 
the respondent wishes to.   

(1) the respondent is an “incapacitated person” (as defined on page 1), AND 
(2) there are no adequate alternatives to a full guardianship.14 

As the petitioner, you must prove by clear and convincing evidence that: 
 
 
This  means  that  if  there  are  any  disputes  about  (1)  or  (2),  it  is  YOUR 
responsibility to bring evidence and convince the judge about your position.   
 
You  can  use  evidence  that  was  submitted  by  others  in  the  case  (for  example,  the 
visitor’s report), but do not assume that other parties will make your case for you. 

The hearing will usually happen as follows: 

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

 

The judge will identify everyone present (for the hearing record). 

The judge will ask everyone the status of the case and whether there are any 
disagreements  about  the  facts  or  what  should  happen  in  the  case  (in  other 
words, whether the case is contested). 

The  judge  will  ask  if  there  are  any  additions  or  corrections  to  the  visitor’s 
report and if there are any objections to it. 

If  there  are  disagreements,  the  judge  will  ask  whether  the  disagreement  is 
about the  capacity of the respondent to take care of  the respondent’s self, or 
about who should be appointed guardian, or both.  In a contested case,  

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

You may have to testify under oath and/or call witnesses to testify in 
support of your petition. 

The  judge  may  have  to  postpone  the  hearing  if  it  is  going  to  take  a 
long time to hear all the necessary testimony. 

The judge may order mediation  under Probate Rule 4.5.   The court’s 
order  will  provide  the  details  about  the  mediator  and  how  mediation 
will be conducted and paid for.

e. 

 

f. 

g. 

If the case is not contested, the judge may ask you questions to help the judge 
decide the following issues: 
(1) 
(2) 

whether the respondent needs a guardian,  
whether  there  are  any  alternative  ways  of  taking  care  of  the 
respondent’s needs without appointing a guardian, and 
who  should  be  appointed  guardian  (considering  the  priorities  for 
appointment in the Alaska statutes). 

(3) 

If  the  judge  decides  it  is  necessary  to  appoint  a  guardian,  the  judge  must 
consider the respondent’s preference on who that should be. 

If the judge appoints a guardian, the judge will explain to the respondent that 
the  respondent  has  the  right  to  request,  at  a  later  time,  that  the  guardian  be 
dismissed or that the guardianship order be changed.15

PETITION FOR APPOINTMENT OF A 
FULL GUARDIAN FOR AN ADULT 

 
 

  

The following is additional information about some sections: 

  F

 

  I

a. 

b. 

Section 5.  Financial Abuse Petition.  Check the box indicating whether a petition to 
protect the respondent from financial abuse has been filed.  Such a petition might be 
filed if, for example, someone is illegally taking the respondent’s money or property 
or  using  the  respondent’s  money  or  property  in  a  way  that  does  not  benefit  the 
respondent.  The forms for asking for protection from this type of abuse are PG-800, 
PG-801, and PG-810.  See form PG-850 for instructions on these types of orders. 

Section 6.  Home State.  The court needs to know the respondent’s “home state” to 
decide whether Alaska courts have the authority to appoint a guardian in this case.  
If  Alaska  is  not  the  respondent’s  “home  state,”  the  court  may  request  more 
information to determine whether it has authority to appoint a guardian or whether 
the case should be filed in the courts of a different state.16 

                                                 
15  The judge is required to do this by AS 13.26.251(h).  Petition for Review of Guardianship 

(form PG-190) can be used to file such a request with the court. 

16  See AS 13.26.010(c), AS 13.27.110, and AS 13.27.180(2).

Section 7.  Venue.  This section helps the court decide if you filed in the correct 
court location within Alaska.17  You can find which courts are in which judicial 
district here: http://www.courts.alaska.gov/courtdir/index.htm#trial. 

Section  13.    Respondent’s  Mental  or  Physical  State.    In  this  paragraph,  you  must 
describe why the respondent is an “incapacitated person” as defined on page 1.  If 
you have a doctor’s diagnosis, you can write that here.  Attach an extra page if you 
need more room.  Write only on one side of the page. 

Section 14.  Respondent’s Limitations.  Describe the things the respondent cannot 
do to take care of the respondent’s self.  Attach an extra page if you need more room 
to describe this.  Write only on one side of the page. 

Section 17.  In this section, you may recommend who should be appointed guardian.  
AS 13.26.311 states that qualified persons have priority for appointment as guardian 
in the following order: 

(1) 

(2) 
(3) 
(4) 

(5) 

(6) 
(7) 

any  person  or  organization  nominated  by  the  respondent,  if  the  court 
believes the respondent is able to make an informed choice 
the respondent’s spouse 
the respondent’s adult child or parent 
a  relative  of  the  respondent  that  the  respondent  has  lived  with  for  more 
than six months during the year before the petition was filed 
a  relative  or  friend  of  the  respondent  who  has  demonstrated  a  sincere, 
longstanding interest in the respondent’s welfare 
a private professional guardian 
the public guardian 

After  filling  in  the  proposed  guardian’s  name  and  contact  information,  write  in 
that  person’s  relationship  to  the  respondent  and  put  a  checkmark  in  the  correct 
corresponding  box.    For  example,  if  the  nominated  guardian  is  the  respondent’s 
parent, then write in “parent” and put a checkmark next to “(3) the respondent’s 
adult  child  or  parent.”    In  the  last  part  of  the  section,  write  in  all  of  the  other 
people that you know of with equal or higher priority to be appointed guardian. 

When  two  or  more  people  have  equal  priority  for  appointment,  the  court  will 
select  the  person  it  considers  to  be  the  best  qualified.    If  a  person  with  higher 
priority exists, but does not want to be the guardian (or is otherwise unable to be 
appointed  as  the  guardian),  then  the  court  may  appoint  someone  with  lower 
priority.   Also, if it is in the respondent’s best  interest,  the court may decline to 
appoint  a  person  who  has  priority  and  instead  appoint  a  person  with  a  lower 
priority or no priority at all. 

Page  7.    Sign  and  date  the  petition.    You  will  also  need  to  complete  the 
“Verification” section that  follows  your  signature.   You  must  do  this in  front of  a 
notary public.  A court clerk can provide this notary service for you (at no charge) 
when you bring the petition to court.  You must bring a photo ID with you for the 
notarization.
