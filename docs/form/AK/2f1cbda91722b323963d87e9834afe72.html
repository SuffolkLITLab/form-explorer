      <pre>Child In Need of  
Aid Proceedings

Note:  This is an informational pamphlet about child in 
need of  aid cases.  It is not meant to advise you about Alaska 
law.  You should talk to a lawyer about your individual 
situation.  The Alaska Lawyer Referral Service, at 272-0352 (in 
Anchorage) or 800-478-9999, will help you ﬁ nd a lawyer.  If  
you are a parent or child involved in this kind of  case and you 
cannot afford to hire a lawyer, you may qualify to have a free 
lawyer appointed to help you.  Ask the judge handling your 
case.

What is a “child in need of  aid?”
A “child in need of  aid” is a person under 18 years of  age 
whom the court ﬁ nds needs the help of  the State of  Alaska 
because the child is not receiving proper care or is in an unsafe 
situation.  The court and the Alaska Department of  Health 
and Social Services try to make a plan to help the child.  A 
child in need of  aid case is not a criminal case.

What kinds of  situations make a child in need 
of  aid?
A child may be a child in need of  aid for many reasons.  For 
example, a child may be in need of  aid if: 

• 
• 

• 

• 
• 

the child has been abandoned
the child refuses to accept the care offered to him or her 
(for example, if  a child won’t stay home)
the child needs medical treatment which isn’t being 
provided
the child has been physically or sexually abused
the child has been neglected.

Answers to some common 
questions

Published by The Alaska Court System
PUB-5
(12/09)(grey)

1

What happens ﬁ rst?

 
When someone (usually a state social worker who works for the 
Department of  Health and Social Services) decides that a child 
needs help from the state, that person ﬁ les a petition with the 
court.  This petition is a paper that names the child, the child’s 
parents, guardians, tribe or Indian custodian and tells about the 
child’s situation.  A copy of  the petition is given to the child 
and the parents or guardian, tribe and Indian custodian, and 
everyone is told when to come to court for a court hearing.

 
If  the child is in an emergency situation which requires that 
some action be taken before a court hearing can be held, a 
social worker may pick up the child and place the child in a 
foster home or other home until the court hearing.  If  the child 
is picked up without a court hearing ﬁ rst being held, the social 
worker must prepare a petition and give everyone a copy of  the 
petition, and a court hearing must be held as soon as possible.

 
Sometimes a social worker or other person will ask a court to 
issue an emergency order requiring that the child be given to the 
custody of  the state until a hearing can be held.  In this case, 
also, a court hearing is scheduled as soon as possible.

What happens at the court hearing?

There is usually more than one court hearing.
 

At the ﬁ rst hearing, the judge will make sure that everyone has 
 
been told about the hearing and about the things said in the 
petition.

 
At the ﬁ rst or second hearing, the judge will decide whether or 
not there is a good reason to believe that the child is in need of  
aid.  If  the judge thinks there is a good reason to believe this, he 
or she will generally schedule a trial in the case, and decide

where the child will stay and what will happen to the family 
until the time for trial.  If  the judge decides that not enough 
information has been presented, the judge will dismiss the case.  
(If  the child is in foster care and the case has been dismissed, 
the child would be returned to the parents, guardian or Indian 
custodian at this point.)

The judge also will explain each person’s rights.  These rights 
include each parent’s right to have a lawyer.  (The court may give 
a parent a free lawyer if  the parent wants a lawyer but cannot 
afford one.)  The child also has the right to have someone to 
help the child in court.  Usually a person called a “guardian 
ad litem” is appointed to help the child.  The guardian ad litem 
investigates the case, talks to everyone involved and then tells 
the court what the guardian ad litem thinks is best for the child.  
For further information refer to PUB-3 entitled “What is 
a guardian ad litem?”  Also, the child’s tribe has a right to 
“intervene” in the case, meaning that the tribe has the right to 
become formally involved.

What happens at the trial?

The trial is called an “adjudication hearing.”  It is not held if  
 
everyone agrees that what was said in the petition is true.  If  
everyone agrees, only a disposition hearing is held (see below).  
If  there is a disagreement, there must be a trial and the trial 
normally should be completed within about four months after 
the court case has been ﬁ led.

 
The Department of  Health and Social Services, usually 
represented by an assistant attorney general, will present 
evidence to try to show that the statements in the petition are 
true.  The child’s parents and the child will also have a chance to 
present evidence (for example, to have people come to talk on 
their behalf) and to ask questions of  any people who 

2

3

testify (make statements) at the trial.  From all the information 
presented, the judge will decide whether or not the child is in 
need of  aid.  If  the judge decides that the child is not a child 
in need of  aid, the case is over.  If  the child is in state custody, 
the child is then returned to his parents, guardian or Indian 
custodian.

If  the judge decides that the child is a child in need of  aid, the 
judge will schedule a disposition hearing, to decide what will 
happen to the child and family.  (Sometimes the judge will make 
a decision about the disposition of  the case at the same time as 
the adjudication hearing, but sometimes the disposition hearing 
is held later.)

What happens at the disposition hearing?

 
Before the disposition hearing, the Department of  Health and 
Social Services must make a written report to the court called 
a predisposition report.  A copy is given to the parents and the 
child.  This report tells what the social worker thinks should 
happen to the child and the family and why.

 
At the disposition hearing, everyone gets to tell the judge what 
he or she thinks should happen.  The judge then decides what 
should happen.

 
If  someone does not like the judge’s decision, he or she can 
appeal.  This means that he or she can ask a higher judge to 
change the decision.

What can happen to the child and the family?

The judge will try to decide how best to help the family and the 
 
child.  For example, the child may be placed in a foster home or 
a group home, if  necessary.  The child may be returned home, 
and a social worker may visit the home to make sure the child is 

receiving proper care.  The child and the parents may have to do 
certain things, like go to counseling or parenting classes.

How long is the judge’s decision for?

The disposition decision can cover any period of  time up to 
two years.  If  the Department of  Health and Social Services 
wants the case to continue for longer, a social worker can ﬁ le a 
petition for an extension and the case then goes back to court to 
see if  the time should be extended.

Does the court look at the case after the 
disposition hearing?

Yes.  Within one year after the child was ﬁ rst taken into state 
custody, the judge will hold a “permanency hearing.”  At this 
hearing, the judge will decide whether the child is still in need 
of  aid.  If  so, the judge will decide on a permanent plan for the 
child.  Possible plans include returning the child home, making 
the child available for adoption, or another permanent living 
arrangement.  Before the permanency hearing, the Department 
of  Health and Social Services must make a written report to 
the court called a permanency report.  A copy is given to the 
parents, and the child.  This report tells what the social worker 
thinks the permanent plan should be, and why.

At the permanency hearing, everyone (including foster parents 
and grandparents) gets to tell the judge what they think the 
permanent solution should be.  The judge then decides what 
should happen, and when.  The court will hold a hearing every 
year until the plan is successful. 

In addition to the permanency hearings, the court reviews court 
papers at least once per year until the case is over, to make sure 
that everything about the case is being handled properly.  If  a 

4

5

parent, child or other involved person has a good reason, he or 
she can ask the court to hold a review hearing about the case.  
For example, a parent may feel that things have changed at 
home and that the child should come home before the judge’s 
order says the child should.  The court would consider this at a 
review hearing.

Can a judge take a child away from a family 
forever?

Yes.  If  efforts have been made to help the child, but the 
family situation has not improved, the department may start 
a “termination of  parental rights” case to make the child 
available for adoption by another family.  The law requires the 
department to consider starting a termination of  parental rights 
case when the child has been living in state foster care for 15 of  
the previous 22 months.
