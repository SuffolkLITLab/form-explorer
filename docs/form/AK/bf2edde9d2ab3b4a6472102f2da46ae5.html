SECTION 3 
 
INFORMATION ABOUT   
LEGAL CUSTODY, PHYSICAL CUSTODY,  
VISITATION, CHILD SUPPORT, AND THE PFD 

n determining custody and visitation, the judge must decide what is in the best interests of the 
child.    See  page  20  for  a  list  of  factors  the  judge  must  consider  in making  this  determination.  
You must be prepared to explain to the judge how your proposal for custody and visitation is in 
the best interests of the child.  See the parenting agreement form (DR-475, available online and 
at the court) for examples of the issues you should think about when preparing your custody and 
visitation proposal. 

ote:  If either party has “a history of perpetrating domestic violence,” it may affect the court’s 

Legal  custody  means  the  right  and  obligation  to  make  decisions  about  a  child’s  upbringing, 
including schooling, medical care, and financial matters.  There are two types of legal custody. 

ole  legal  custody  means  that  only  one  parent  is  given  the  legal  authority  to  make 
decisions about the child.  If the parents do not agree on a decision about the child, the 
parent with sole legal custody has the right to make the final decision.   

Shared  legal  custody  means  that  both  parents  are  given  the  legal  authority  to  make 
decisions about the child.  The parents share responsibility in making the major decisions 
affecting the child’s welfare.2 

  Alaska’s legislature has expressed a policy favoring shared legal custody regardless 
of  the  physical  custody  arrangement.    The  legislature  has  stated  that  “it  is  in  the 
public  interest  to  encourage  parents  to  share  the  rights  and  responsibilities  of  child 
rearing”  and  that  “it  is  the  intent  of  the  legislature  that  both  parents  have  the 
opportunity to guide and nurture their child . . .”3 

  However,  shared  legal  custody  is  appropriate  only  when  the  parents  can  cooperate 
and  communicate  regarding  the  child.4    If  the  parents  cannot  discuss  these  matters 
cooperatively and share decision making, shared legal custody will not be awarded.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANSWERING CUSTODY COMPLAINT 

  Primary  physical  custody  means  that  the  children  reside  with  one  parent  more  than 

70% of the year. 

  Shared  physical  custody  means  that  the  children  reside  with  each  parent  for  a 
specified period of at least 30% of the year.  If you want shared physical custody, you 
must  describe  when  the  children  will  reside  with  each  parent.    If  either  parent  is 
planning  a  move  to  another  community  in  the  near  future,  you  should  explain  how 
shared custody will be continued.  See AS 25.20.090 on page 21 for factors the court 
must consider in  determining whether to award shared custody. 

  Divided physical custody means that each parent has primary custody of at least one 

child and the parents do not share custody of any of their children. 

  Hybrid physical custody means at least one parent has primary custody of at least one 

of the children, and the parents share custody of at least one of their children. 

hysical custody means where a child actually lives.   As a general matter, it is very rare for a 

child to live with one parent 100% of the time. 
For purposes of calculating the amount of child support, Civil Rule 90.3(f) describes four types 
of physical custody: 

Physical Custody.   

  P

isitation  is  the  right  of  a  parent  and  child  to  contact  and  visit  one  another  when  the  child  is 
residing  or  visiting  with  the  other  parent.    It  is  generally  desirable  that  minor  children  have 
frequent  and  continuing  contact  with  both  parents  so  that  both  parents  can  maintain  a  good 
relationship with the children and share the rights and responsibilities of child rearing.   

n  the  Visitation  section  of  your  Answer,  describe  what  you  think  is  a  reasonable  visitation 
schedule.  Be prepared to explain to the judge why your proposal is in the best interests of the 
child.  The following are some things to consider in your visitation proposal: 

  The  importance  to  the  child  of  having  an  opportunity  to  build  and

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANSWERING CUSTODY COMPLAINT 

Be sure to check the last box in the Visitation section of the  Answer if you are concerned about 
your safety or your children’s safety when with the other parent (for example, if there is a history 
of domestic violence, child abuse, sexual abuse, alcohol or drug abuse, etc.).  Then explain what 
restrictions you want placed on the other parent’s visitation.5   

  The law requires that both parents financially support their children.6 

  Support is paid on behalf of the children, not for the benefit of the custodial parent. 

  The Alaska Supreme Court has established guidelines in Civil Rule 90.3 which judges must 

follow to determine the amount of child support. 

  Normally,  child  support  stops  when  a  child  reaches  age  18.7    However,  you  can  ask  that 
support  continue  to  be  provided  for  each  child  while  the  child  is  18  if  the  child  is  (1) 
unmarried, (2)  actively pursuing a high school diploma or equivalent level of training, and 
(3) living as a dependent with a parent.   You can ask the court to order that the support be 
paid to the parent with whom the child is living or directly to the 18 year old.  

Check the box in Section 9(a) of the Answer if you want support continued while the children 
are 18. 

Income  Withholding.    The  court  will  be  required  to  order  immediate  income  withholding 
from the person ordered to pay child support and order the support paid through the Child 
Support Services Division (CSSD) unless one of the three exceptions authorized by statute8 
applies.  For an explanation of those exceptions, see form DR-10, page 13 (available at the 
court).  If there is a reason why the court should not order immediate income withholding, be 
sure to write that in Section 9(c) of your Answer. 

  You may want to request the services of the Alaska Child Support Services Division (CSSD).  
If  you do, CSSD will maintain records of support payments and enforce the support order.  
For  example,  CSSD  will  serve  an  order  enforcing  the  income  withholding  order  described 
above  on  the  employer  of  the  parent  ordered  to  pay  support.    If  income  withholding  is 
ordered  but  you  do  not  apply  for  CSSD's  services,  you  will  have  to  serve  the  appropriate 
court orders on the employer. Once the employer has been served (by CSSD or by you), the 
withheld money must be paid to CSSD. 

For more information about CSSD, read the attached information sheet (DR-316).   

f you want to request CSSD's services, fill out the attached application form (DR-315) and 
file it with your Answer. 

f the parent with custody of the children is receiving assistance from the Alaska Temporary  
Assistance Program (ATAP), child support payments must be made to CSSD. 

                                                         
5 See AS 25.20.061 about the types of restrictions the court can impose in proceedings involving 
domestic violence. 
6 AS 25.20.030. 
7 Child support also stops if a child is emancipated (for example, if the child marries or obtains a 
court order of emancipation under AS 09.55.590).

Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD). 

ou should ask the court to designate which parent will apply for the Alaska PFD on behalf of 
the  children  while they  are  minors  (under  age  18).    If  both  parents  apply  for  the  children, the 
Department of Revenue will not send the dividends to either one.  The Department will hold the 
dividends until they receive a court order directing who should receive the dividends or until one 
parent withdraws the applications he/she filed on behalf of the children.  15 AAC 23.223(h). 

arent Information in Section 1 of Complaint. 

f there is a question or disagreement about who is the father of the children, that question will 
need to be resolved before the court decides the custody case. 

or  example,  if  the  person  listed  as  the  father  on  page  1  of  the  Complaint  is  not  listed  as  the 
father on the birth certificate of each child, but both parents agree that he is the father, you can 
do either of the following: 

File an  Affidavit of Paternity with the  Health Analytics and Vital Records office.  This 
affidavit  form  (VS-16)  is  available  at  courthouses  and  at  Vital  Records  offices.    Both 
parents must sign the affidavit. 

State in both the Complaint and the Answer in your custody case that he is the father.  If 
both  the  plaintiff  and  the  defendant  agree  in  their  pleadings  (the  Complaint  and  the 
Answer) that he is the father, there will not be a paternity issue in the case. 

 
If the defendant’s Answer denies or questions paternity, the court probably will require that this 
issue  be  resolved  before  the  custody  case  can  proceed.    The  following  are  two  ways  to  get 
paternity established: 

Apply  to  the  Child  Support  Services  Division  (CSSD)  for  a  determination  of  paternity.  
The  forms  for  this  are  available  at  CSSD  offices  and  on  the  CSSD  website: 
www.childsupport.alaska.gov .  See 15 AAC 125.212 – .259 in the Alaska Administrative 
Code for a description of this procedure. 

Ask  the  court  for  an  order  establishing  paternity.    You  can  find  forms  to  establish 
paternity and learn more here: http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/shcpaternity.htm.    

he court also may allow the paternity question to be contested as part of the custody case. 

f the defendant is named as the father in the  Complaint but not on the birth certificate, and the 
defendant does not file an Answer, the court may or may not be willing to enter a default custody 
judgment and child support order in the case.

HOW TO GET A TRIAL DATE 

   

Ask the clerk which of the following procedures applies to your case:

SECTION 5 
 
PREPARING FOR THE CUSTODY TRIAL 

   

A. 
 
 

Comply with pretrial order. 
 
The court will send you an Order which will set the trial date and establish deadlines for 
other things you must do before the trial.  Be sure to follow all the deadlines set out in the 
order,  including  discovery,  witness  lists  and  submission  of  child  support  financial 
information.  If you do not comply with the Order, your trial will be delayed. 

NOTE:  If you do not understand how to comply with the pretrial order, you may want to 
consult with an attorney. 

Discovery.    Discovery  is  the  exchange  of  information  and  all  documentary 
evidence  between  parties  before  trial.    Civil  Rule  26  sets  out  the  rules  that  the 
parties must follow regarding what information must be given to the other parent 
and when the information must be given. 

Witness  List.    The  court  usually  orders  each  parent  to  file  with  the  court  an 
alphabetical list of all the witnesses that the parent intends to have testify at trial.  
The list must also include each witness' address and telephone number.  There is 
no  court  form  available  for  this.    You  must  send  a  copy  of  the  list  to  the  other 
parent. 
 
NOTE:  If you plan to testify, you should also list yourself as a witness. 

Submission  of  Financial  Information  Necessary  to  Calculate  Child  Support.    If 
you  have  not  already  filed  the  DR-305  Child  Support  Guidelines  Affidavit  and 
proof of income (tax returns and pay stubs), do so now!  Be sure to send a copy of 
the Affidavit and proof to the other parent. 

The outline is a very important step.  Read the Complaint and Answer.  Then make a list 
of the issues that are in dispute and identify the documents and witnesses that will support 
each of your points.   You can use the Trial Outline on page 15 of these instructions. 

e sure to refer to this outline during your trial to make sure you remember to tell the 

judge the important facts.

Why you believe it is in the best interests of the children for you to have custody of 
them.  The following are examples of items you might want to discuss: 
● 
● 
● 
● 
● 

who have the children lived with 
who has been the primary care giver for the children 
how are the children doing 
why you are a responsible parent 
do either of the  parents have  substance abuse problems and  how does that 
affect the children 

See Section 8 for a complete list of the things the court must consider in determining 
the best interests of the children. 

What  amount  of  visitation  the  other  parent  should  be  allowed,  and  your  proposed 
visitation schedule.  You must be able to explain to the judge why  your  visitation 
schedule is reasonable and in the children’s best interests.  If  you propose that the 
other parent get no visitation, you must be prepared to explain to the judge why that 
would be in the children’s best interests. 

Why  your proposed child support amount is correct, whether or not the amount is 
disputed. 

If the other parent disputes the court’s authority to decide custody  of the children, 
bring witnesses and/or documents to show that the children have lived in Alaska for 
the last six months. 
 
For each issue in your outline, list the witnesses and documents you will submit to 
support your claims. 

 
 
 
 
 

   

 
2. 

3. 

 
4. 

5. 

Things to include in this outline: 
 
1. 

 

A  witness  should  be  someone  who  has  information  about  why  it  would  be  in  the  best 
interests of the children to be placed in your custody. For example, you might want to ask 
family members, social services representatives or baby sitters to testify as witnesses for 
you. 
 
If  you  want  to  have  witnesses  testify,  it  is  your  responsibility  to  arrange  to  have  the 
witnesses present at the time of the trial.  If a witness cannot appear in person, you can 
ask the court for permission to have the witness testify by telephone.  You must get this 
permission before the hearing.  Ask the court clerk how to get the court’s permission and 
how the call will be set up.  Note: You will have to pay for the call. You must make these 
arrangements as far in advance of the trial as possible.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANSWERING CUSTODY COMPLAINT 

Subpoena Witnesses if Necessary. 

When  you  ask  people  to  testify  for  you,  some  may  tell  you  that  they  are  unable  or 
unwilling to testify without a court order.  If that happens, you may ask the court to issue a 
subpoena (a court order that requires the person to appear and testify).  See CIV-109, How 
to Subpoena a Witness, available online and at the clerk’s  office.  Note:  You must pay a 
witness fee to each witness you subpoena. 

You must also bring to the trial any documents you want the court to consider.  Examples of 
documents you might want to bring with you: 

financial records to help decide the amount of child support (information about your 
income or the other parent’s income such as tax returns and pay stubs) 

the children’s birth certificates (for example, if there is a dispute about who is the 
father of the children) 

 

  

 

  

Note:  You may not be able to use some kinds of documents at the trial.  For example: letters 
or affidavits from people who are not present to testify.  The court probably will not let you 
present  such  letters  and  affidavits  as  evidence  because  the  other  party  would  not  have  a 
chance to ask the writer questions about the document. 

Collect Supporting Documents. 

Prepare an Opening Statement. 

The judge may ask you to make an opening statement, so you should be prepared to give a 
brief summary (2-3 minutes) of the testimony you and your witnesses will give.

SECTION 6 
 
CUSTODY TRIAL 

 

  If you have difficulty hearing, tell the clerk and ask to use the 
assisted listening equipment available in the courtrooms. 
 
On  the  date  set  for  the  trial,  both  parents  must  be  present  and  ready  to  give  the  court  their 
evidence  supporting  their  positions  on  custody,  visitation  and  child  support.    All  witnesses 
supporting their requests must also be present. 

Day of Trial. 

e sure to get to court a little early on the day of your trial.  This will give you time to 

become familiar with the courtroom.  Also be sure all your witnesses are there. 

n small towns and villages the court may be only a single room and yours may  be the 
only case scheduled.  In cities there will be a courthouse with several courtrooms. If you 
cannot tell from your notice of trial or from the posted court calendar which courtroom 
your trial will be in, ask the court clerk or receptionist for directions. 

ou  may  have  to  wait  before  your  case  is  called  because  there  may  be  other  cases 

scheduled before yours. 
 
During Trial. 

Each party will have the opportunity to present evidence. You must present your own case 
at the trial.  Court rules state that no one except you (or your attorney if you have one) can 
represent you in court. 

The  plaintiff's  case  must  be  presented  first,  followed  by  your  case.      After  each  of  the 
plaintiff's witnesses have testified, you will have a chance to cross-examine (question) the 
witness about the testimony.  

hen  all  of  the  plaintiff's  witnesses  have  finished  testifying,  you  will  have  a  chance  to 
present  your  case  and  witnesses.    The  plaintiff  then  will  have  a  chance  to  cross-examine 
each of your witnesses.   

efore beginning to testify, each party and each witness will be placed under oath and will 

have a continuing obligation to speak only the truth.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANSWERING CUSTODY COMPLAINT 

Some suggestions for presenting your case: 

If the judge asks for an opening statement, it should be brief (2 to 3 minutes) 
and  to  the  point,  a  summary  of  what  you  want  and  why  the  judge  should 
order it. 
Make sure you have talked with your witnesses about why you want them to 
testify.    Remind  them  that  they  need  to  talk  about  things  they  have 
personally  seen,  not  things  you  or  someone  else  told  them.    For  example, 
they  could  testify  about  how  long  you  have  been  the  primary  caregiver  or 
about facts that show how well you have provided for the children. 

Some judges will allow your witnesses to present a statement of what they 
want the court to know, other judges will require that you ask questions of 
your  witness  to  present  their  testimony.    Try  to  ask  open  ended  questions 
rather than ones which call for a yes or no answer. 

Make sure you have your documents in court with you to support the points 
you want to make.  

Refer to your outline so you don’t forget anything.  If you forget to present 
something at trial, the judge won’t be able to consider that point. 

At a minimum, you will have to show why your custody proposal is in the 
best interests of the children, what your proposed visitation schedule will be 
and why it is in the best interests of the children and why the proposed child 
support calculations are correct if disputed. 

Don’t assume that the court knows all about your case.  You have to present 
facts to support all the points you want to make.  The judge can not fill in the 
blanks for you. 

 
After Trial 

C. 
 

 

 

After all the testimony has been presented, the judge will make a decision.  The judge may 
make the decision immediately or the judge may take some time to consider the evidence 
and make the decision later.   

The judge may require you to prepare proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law 
and a proposed judgment.   There are forms for this available at the clerk’s office (form 
DR-460 and DR-465).  Civil Rule 78(a). 

ou will get a copy of the written judgment when it is completed.  Make sure the court has 

your current mailing address.

f you believe the court applied the law incorrectly or reached a decision which is not supported 
by the evidence presented, you may appeal the custody judgment or the child support order to the 
Alaska Supreme Court.   

n appeal does not automatically give you a new trial.   The supreme court will not accept any 
new evidence.  The only information the supreme court will consider on appeal is (1) a transcript 
of  the  tape  recording  of  the  trial  (or  those  parts  of  it  designated  by  the  parties),  (2)  any  items 
presented as evidence at the trial, (3) the documents in the court file, and (4) legal briefs. 

o  appeal,  you  must  file  a  Notice  of  Appeal  with the  Clerk  of  the  Appellate  Courts  within  15 
days after the date the judgment is distributed.9  The Notice of Appeal must be accompanied by 
the  items  specified  in  Appellate  Rule  204(b),  including  a  filing  fee  in  the  amount  specified  in 
Administrative  Rule  9(a)  or  motion  to  waive  the  fee.    The  court  does  not  provide  forms  or 
instructions  for  appeals  to  the  supreme  court.    See  Appellate  Rule  218  for  more  information 
about  appeal  procedure  in  custody  cases.    Appeals  are  complicated,  and  you  should  consider 
seeing a lawyer if you want to appeal. 

f  circumstances  change  after  the  judgment  is  entered,  you  can  ask  the  court  to  change  the 
custody judgment and the support order.  The court has jurisdiction to modify these orders while 
the children are under 18. 

Change In Custody or Visitation 

A  change  in  custody  will  not  be  granted  unless  there  has  been  a  substantial  change  in 
circumstances since the last order was entered.  Also, the requested change must be in the 
best interests of the children. 

n  order  to  obtain  an  increase  or  decrease  in  support  payments  because  of  a  change  in 
income of the person making the payments, the change in income must be both long term 
and  significant.    The  court  will  not  modify  a  support  order  because  of  a  minor  or 
temporary  increase  or  decrease  in  income.    The  general  guideline  for  determining 
whether a change in income is significant is if the change is enough to raise or lower the 
support payments by 15% or more.

ustody Decisions:  "Best Interests of the Child"10 

o decide who gets custody of a child, the court must determine what is in the best interests of 

the child.   The court must consider the following: 

the physical, emotional, mental, religious, and social needs of the child; 

the capability and desire of each parent to meet these needs: 

the  child's  preference  if  the  child  is  of  sufficient  age  and  capacity  to  form  a 
preference; 

the love and affection existing between the child and each parent; 

the length of time the child has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment and the 
desirability of maintaining continuity; 

the willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and 
continuing  relationship  between  the  other  parent  and  the  child,  except  that  the 
court  may  not  consider  this  willingness  and  ability  if  one  parent  shows  that  the 
other  parent  has  sexually  assaulted  or  engaged  in  domestic  violence  against  the 
parent  or  a  child,  and  that  a  continuing  relationship  with  the  other  parent  will 
endanger the health or safety of either the parent or the child; 

any evidence of domestic violence, child abuse, or child neglect in the proposed 
custodial household or a history of violence between the parents; 

evidence that substance abuse by either parent or other members of the household 
directly affects the emotional or physical well-being of the child; 
other factors that the court considers pertinent.

In awarding custody, the court must only consider facts that directly affect the child’s wellbeing. 

AS 25.24.150 limits the court’s ability to award custody if either parent “has a history of 
perpetrating domestic violence against the other parent, a child, or a domestic living partner:” 

(g)  There is a rebuttable presumption that a parent who has a history of perpetrating 
domestic violence against the other parent, a child, or a domestic living partner 
may not be awarded sole legal custody, sole physical custody, joint legal custody, 
or joint physical custody of a child. 

(h) 

(i) 

 

 

(j) 

(k) 

(l) 

A parent has a history of perpetrating domestic violence under (g) of this section 
if the court finds that, during one incident of domestic violence, the parent caused 
serious physical injury or the court finds that the parent has engaged in more than 
one incident of domestic violence.  The presumption may be overcome by a 
preponderance of the evidence that the perpetrating parent has successfully 
completed an intervention program for batterers, where reasonably available, that 
the parent does not engage in substance abuse, and that the best interests of the 
child require that parent’s participation as a custodial parent because the other 
parent is absent, suffers from a diagnosed mental illness that affects parenting 
abilities, or engages in substance abuse that affects parenting abilities, or because 
of other circumstances that affect the best interests of the child. 

If the court finds that both parents have a history of perpetrating domestic 
violence under (g) of this section, the court shall either 
(1) 

award sole legal and physical custody to the parent who is less likely to 
continue to perpetrate the violence and require that the custodial parent 
complete a treatment program; or 
if necessary to protect the welfare of the child, award sole legal or physical 
custody, or both, to a suitable third person if the person would not allow 
access to a violent parent except as ordered by the court. 

(2) 

If the court finds that a parent has a history of perpetrating domestic violence 
under (g) of this section, the court shall allow only supervised visitation by that 
parent with the child, conditioned on that parent’s participating in and 
successfully completing an intervention program for batterers, and a parenting 
education program, where reasonably available, except that the court may allow 
unsupervised visitation if it is shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the 
violent parent has completed a substance abuse treatment program if the court 
considers it appropriate, is not abusing alcohol or psychoactive drugs, does not 
pose a danger of mental or physical harm to the child, and unsupervised visitation 
is in the child’s best interests. 

The fact that an abused parent suffers from the effects of the abuse does not 
constitute a basis for denying custody to the abused parent unless the court finds 
that the effects of the domestic violence are so severe that they render the parent 
unable to safely parent the child. 

Except as provided in AS 25.20.095 and 25.20.110, a court may not consider a 
parent's activation to military service and deployment in determining the best 
interest of the child under (c) of this section. In this subsection, “deployment” has 
the meaning given in AS 25.20.095.

In determining whether to award shared custody of a child the court shall consider  

the child’s preference if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to form 
a preference; 

the needs of the child;

over half of his or her own support during the calendar year and must also meet a few other age 
and relationship-to-filer requirements.  Depending on your circumstances, your child may be a 
“qualifying child” for more than one person, such as the child’s other parent or even the child’s 
grandparent.  If you think this might apply to you, review the “Qualifying Child of More Than 
One Person” section of IRS Publication 501.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
