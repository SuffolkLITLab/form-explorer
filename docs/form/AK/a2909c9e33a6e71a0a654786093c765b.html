[Note: You cannot waive child support or agree to a different amount than what is calculated 
under Civil Rule 90.3, unless one of the exceptions in Civil Rule 90.3(c) applies. For example, 
the obligor’s adjusted annual income is more than $126,000; or the obligor’s annual income is 
so low that the amount of support would be less than $600; or you can prove to the court that 
manifest injustice will result unless the support amount is varied.]

4.  Children’s Health Care Coverage. 

a.  Health Insurance. If the children are covered by an insurance company other than 
the Indian Health Service or Tricare, you should also fill out court form DR-330, 
Notice to Employer Re: Children’s Medical Insurance. 
(1) Does Party A have health insurance available for the child(ren) at reasonable 

cost through Party A’s employer, union, or otherwise? 

 Yes 

 No 

(2) Does Party B have health insurance available for the child(ren) at reasonable 

cost through Party B’s employer, union, or otherwise?  

 No 
(3) Are the children eligible for services through the Indian Health Service? 

 Yes 

(4) Do the children have other health insurance or care available? 

 Yes   

 No 

  Yes 

 No 

Describe: 

If the answer to (3) and (4) is no, one of the parents must agree to provide 
insurance for the child(ren) if such insurance is available at a reasonable cost.  
The cost of the children’s insurance must be divided equally by the parents unless 
the court orders a different division for good cause. 

AGREEMENT: Health insurance for the child(ren) will be purchased by: 

  Party A at a monthly cost to Party A of $  
  Party B at a monthly cost to Party B of $  
through the above person’s 
whose name and address are  
 

  employer 

* 
* 

  union 

   

The cost of health insurance for the child(ren) will be divided between the parties 

 equally 

  

  Explain reason for unequal division: 

 
 
[*List only the cost to insure the children involved in this case.  If there is no extra 
cost to the parent to include the children in the parent’s insurance coverage, you 
cannot deduct any cost for the children’s health insurance.  The parent must submit 
documentation from the health insurance provider (employer, union, etc.) showing 
separately the cost of health insurance for the parent and the parent’s dependents. 
See Civil Rule 90.3(d) for further explanation.  For more information, see Calculating 
Cost of Child(ren)’s Health Insurance chart on the court’s website.] 

b.  Children’s Health Care Expenses Not Covered by Insurance (including medical, 

dental, vision and mental health counseling expenses).   
We agree that the children’s reasonable health care expenses not covered by 
insurance will be paid as follows (unless they are over $5,000 in a calendar year): 

  Party A will pay half and Party B will pay half. 
  Party A will pay  
Explain reason for not sharing these uncovered expenses equally: 
 

 and Party B will pay  

If the uncovered expenses are over $5,000 in a calendar year, the parties will pay 
based on their relative financial circumstances when the expense occurs.

We agree that each of us will reimburse the other for our share of uncovered health 
care expenses within 30 days after we are given the bill, proof of payment and, if 
applicable, a health insurance statement (EOB) showing what part of the cost is 
uncovered. We understand that the bills and other materials must be sent to the 
other parent for reimbursement within a reasonable time. 

5.  Monthly Child Support Payment (including adjustment for children’s health insurance). 

a.  Monthly Child Support Payment from paragraph 3 above 

(on page 10) 

b.  If obligor is buying health insurance for the child(ren), subtract  

50% (or

%) of the monthly insurance payment. 

c.  If obligee is buying health insurance for the child(ren), add

%) of the monthly insurance payment.

$ 

6.  We calculated the Net Monthly Child Support Payment in paragraph 5.d. according to: 

  The formula in Civil Rule 90.3(a) or (b). 
  Civil Rule 90.3(c)(2). Obligor’s adjusted annual income is more than $126,000. 
  Civil Rule 90.3(c)(3). Obligor’s amount of support is less than $600 per year.  
Obligor’s income is low because obligor is: 

  incarcerated 
  unable to work because  
  other 

 
 
 

 
 
 

  Civil Rule 90.3(c)(1).  Manifest injustice will result if support is not varied 
because:  
 
 
 
7.  Seasonal Income. 

  Obligor’s income is seasonal and obligee agrees that, as long as 
the total annual amount remains the same, obligor can make higher payments during 
high income months and lower payments during low income months as follows: 
Higher Monthly Amount $  
 
Lower Monthly Amount $

Both parents will have access to all statements from the account annually. 

c.  Any taxes owing on any Native Corporation dividends paid on behalf of the child(ren) 
 

will be timely paid by (name) 

d.  Any Native Corporation dividends paid on behalf of the children: 

  May be spent for the child(ren)’s health, education, and welfare. 
  May be spent only if both parents provide prior written approval. 
  Other:  
10. Extended Visitation Credit. 

  This credit does not apply to us. 
  This credit applies to us because one of us will have primary physical custody and 
the other (the obligor parent) will have extended visits with the children for periods 
longer than 27 consecutive days.  If and when the obligor parent actually exercises 
the extended visitation, child support will be reduced for these periods as follows: 
 
[Note:  This credit may not be more than 75% of the amount owed for the period.] 

 We agree that child support will continue while each child is 18 years old as long as the 
child is (1) unmarried, (2) actively pursuing a high school diploma or equivalent level of 
technical or vocational training, and (3) living as a dependent with the obligee parent or 
guardian or a designee of the parent or guardian.

 We object to continuing child 

 

 

 

 

   

B. 

C.  Do you want the assistance of the Child Support Services Division (CSSD) to 

enforce the support order and keep records of the payments?    
  No 
If yes, fill out the attached application for CSSD services. [Note: If the parent with custody 
of the children is receiving assistance from the Alaska Temporary Assistance Program 
(ATAP), child support payments must be made to CSSD.] 

  Yes    

D.  Immediate Income Withholding 

Child support will be withheld from the income of the person paying support and paid 
through the Child Support Services Division (CSSD) unless one of the following exceptions is 
approved by the court: 

  We made the following alternative arrangement [Note that if you receive ATAP, CSSD 
must agree to the arrangement]: 
 
 
Also, the person paying support agrees to keep the other party (or CSSD if CSSD is 
enforcing the order) informed of his/her current employer and the availability of 
employment-related health insurance coverage for the child(ren) until the support order 
is satisfied.

AS 25.24.200-.260 
Civil Rule 90.1(a), f(2)(A)-(B), (i)(1) 

 

 

 
 
 
 

  We believe there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding because it 
is not in the best interests of the child(ren) for the following reason: 
 
 
 
Also,  the  person  paying  support  agrees  to  keep  the  other  party  (or  CSSD  if  CSSD  is 
enforcing  the  order)  informed  of  his/her  current  employer  and  the  availability  of 
employment-related health insurance coverage for the child(ren) until the support order 
is satisfied. 

  The  person  paying  support  currently  receives  social  security  or  other  disability 
compensation that includes regular payments to the child(ren) at least equal to the child 
support owed each month. Monthly payment to child(ren): $ 
. Source of the 
payment:  
.  [Note:  To  the  extent  that  these 
payments to the children do not satisfy the monthly amount owed, the court will order 
that the remaining amount due be withheld from income.] 

E.  Federal Taxes 

1.  Child Tax Credit.  We agree as follows: 

 will claim the child(ren) every year. 

   
 
  Every year, Party A will claim the following child(ren) 
 
and Party B will claim the following child(ren) 
  The parents will claim the child(ren) in alternating years with 
 Party B 
claiming the child(ren) for odd-numbered tax years such as 2019 and 2021, and the 
other parent claiming them for even-numbered tax years such as 2020 and 2022. 
  Other:  

 Party A 

 

The parties also agree to provide each other with a signed IRS Form 8332, if needed, by 
February 1 so that it may be timely filed with the IRS. 
This  agreement  regarding  tax  benefits  may  be  modified  without  a  court  order  if  both 
parties  agree  in  writing.    As  required  by  AS  25.24.232,  we  also  agree  that  the  parent 
who has physical custody of the child(ren) for a period less than the other parent may 
not claim the tax benefits in any tax year if on December 31 of that year the parent was 
behind in child support payments in an amount more than four times the monthly child 
support obligation. 

2.  Federal Tax Considerations. We understand that physical custody of a child may impact 
whether  we  can  claim  tax  benefits  such  as  the  Earned  Income  Credit,  Head  of 
Household filing status, and Credit for Dependent (Child) Care Expenses. 

F.  Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD)

I have read the petition in this case and agree to all its terms relating to custody of the
children,  child  support,  visitation,  spousal  maintenance  and  tax  consequences,  division
of property (including retirement benefits) and allocation of debts.

I believe the property and spousal maintenance agreements are fair and just, and take
into consideration the factors listed in AS 25.24.160(a)(2) and (4) so that the economic
effect of the dissolution is fairly allocated.

I agree that the petition constitutes the entire agreement between the parties.

I agree that an incompatibility of temperament has caused the irremediable breakdown
of the marriage.

I  understand  fully  the  nature  and  consequences  of  this  Petition  for  Dissolution  of
Marriage.

I  understand  that  I  have  a  right  to  be  present  at  the  dissolution  hearing.    I  agree,
however, that the court may proceed without me.

I am not under duress or coercion to sign this Waiver of Appearance at Hearing.

It would be a significant hardship for me to attend the hearing because:

INFORMATION ABOUT CSSD 
September 2022 

▪  Establish and enforce an administrative child support order, if there is not already a court 

order.  CSSD will also automatically open a case (and therefore enforce the order) if the 
children are receiving public assistance or if the children are in state custody. 

▪  Enforce a child support order from the court, if the parent or guardian applies for CSSD 

services.   

▪  Review the amount of the support order at the request of either parent, to see if it needs to 
be increased or decreased.  If the order is an administrative order (CSSD established it), 
CSSD will make the necessary changes.  If the order is a court order, CSSD will advise 
clients to address these changes with the court. 

▪  Arrange for genetic (DNA) testing where paternity is not agreed upon. 
▪  Locate absent parents. 
▪  Enforce health care coverage for children if it's available to the paying parent through 

The Child Support Services Division (CSSD) is the state agency responsible for a number of 
services related to support orders.

employment or union membership. 
 

How does a parent apply for CSSD services? 

You must complete an application either through the court or by submitting an online 
application at www.childsupport.alaska.gov.  Your application should provide as much 
information as possible about the other parent.  It must include an affidavit of payments 
already made or received.  Be sure to attach your current custody and support order, and any 
previous orders you may have in the case.   

ow does CSSD enforce child support orders? 

  H

To collect support payments, CSSD will notify the paying parent’s employer to withhold child 
support from the parent’s wages and to send the money to CSSD.  CSSD will then either give 
that money to the other parent, or repay the state for public assistance benefits paid on behalf 
of the child.  CSSD can also issue orders to 'withhold and deliver' other assets, including 
commissions, retirement checks, bank accounts, Alaska Permanent Fund Dividends, Native 
Corporation Dividends, IRS tax refunds, stock dividends, and income-producing property.    

CSSD can file liens against the paying parent's property, as well as revoke state occupational 
and driver's licenses if that parent does not pay child support.  CSSD can sue the parent in 
court for failure to pay child support.  CSSD charges interest on late payments the last day of 
the month. 

If late or missed payments (called “arrears”) continue to go up, certain enforcement actions will 
automatically start when the amount owed reaches a certain point: 
•  At $50, CSSD will report to the PFD office. 
•  At $150 (for TANF arrears; non-TANF arrears will report at $500), CSSD will report to the 

Federal Offset Program (FOP)  

•  At $1,000, CSSD will report to the Credit Bureau. 
•  At either $2,500 or 12 months unpaid, CSSD will report to the Passport office and start 

property liens. 

•  Native Corporation Dividend funds can only be used to pay debt owed to a parent/guardian. 
Page 1 of 2 
DR-316 (9/22)(cs-bb) 
INFORMATION ABOUT CSSD 
 

It is required by federal law that CSSD use wage withholding for monthly payments.  CSSD will 
tell the paying parent’s employer the amount of the child support order, and the employer will 
send the money each month to CSSD.  The monthly payment will be broken out in partial 
payments corresponding to the pay schedule.  For example, if the parent is paid twice a month, 
CSSD will take out half of the monthly child support payment each pay period. 

Child support payments will not be collected through wage withholding if the paying parent is 
self-employed or if the court orders something different. 

ow long does it take for the non-paying parent to receive support payments made 

to CSSD? 

CSSD will mail the payment to the non-paying parent, or deposit it directly to the parent's bank 
account, within two business days. 

ow does a parent sign up for direct deposit? 

You may enroll or change your direct deposit information online through 
https://my.alaska.gov/.  Select “CSSD Member Services Portal” under the Services tab.  Call 
(907) 268-6900 if you have questions or need assistance. 

ow can I find out about the payment status of my case? 

There are several ways to check on the status of your child support payments: 

•  Call the KIDSLINE at (907) 269-6900 in Anchorage, or (800) 478-3300 outside of 

Anchorage (select option 2) 

•  Click on KIDS Online at www.childsupport.alaska.gov, located under “Online Service” 
•  Log into your CSSD Member Services Portal through https://my.alaska.gov/  

You will need to have your member ID number, which can be found in the introductory letters 
to both parents.  You can also request your member ID number by calling (907) 269-6900 
during business hours.   

an CSSD also collect spousal support? 

Yes, in cases where both child support and spousal support have been ordered, CSSD will 
collect and enforce both types of support obligations.  However, CSSD cannot collect and 
enforce spousal support only, nor can CSSD establish orders for spousal support.  This must be 
done through the courts.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
