INTRODUCTION  

This Manual of Transcript Procedures (TF-410) consists of two parts. Part I applies to all transcripts filed with the 
Alaska Court System.  All transcripts filed with the Alaska Court System must be prepared in the form set out 
in this manual. 

Part II applies to transcripts prepared for the Alaska Court System by transcribers employed by the court system or 
under contract with the court system. 

Transcribers under contract with the Alaska Court System must submit a completed Transcriber Audio Evaluation 
form for each assignment in which there were any issues with the recordings that hindered transcription; 
however, all transcribers are encouraged to submit form AP-810 (Appendix X) that can be found here: 
https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/ap-810.pdf  

The Alaska Court System reserves the right to duplicate any transcript filed with the court without payment of fees to 
the transcriber.

PAGE NUMBERING 

Each page of a transcript shall contain 25 numbered lines. 

Solid left and right marginal lines on all pages are required.  The marginal lines are to be placed on the 
page so that text begins 1.62 inches from the left side of the page and ends .5 inches from the right side of 
the page.  The use of top and bottom marginal lines is optional. 

The pages of a transcript shall be numbered in a single series of consecutive numbers regardless of the 
number of days or number of proceedings involved.  The page number shall be placed at the bottom right 
corner.  The page number does not count as a line.  The transcript, whether consisting of one or more 
volumes, shall be numbered in a single chronological sequence throughout all volumes. 

Volume pages are counted but not physically numbered. 

Table of Contents pages are numbered consecutively to the volume page: 2, 3, 4, etc. 

Day pages are numbered in sequence.  Use the page number on the day page 
(Appendix E) for the table of contents and the volume pages (Appendix B). 

Each page after the day page is numbered with consecutive numbers. 

The certificate is always the last page of every transcript and is numbered.  If there are multiple 
volumes, it would be the last page of the last volume.  The certificate page number is not 
shown on the volume page.  Example of page numbering: 

Single volume  

Multiple volumes 

Volume I is Page 1 
Table of Contents is Page 2 
Day Page is Page 3 
Proceedings Page is Page 4 
Certificate is last numbered page 

Volume II is Page 785 
Day Page is Page 786 
Proceedings Page is Page 787 
Certificate is last numbered page

TYPING 

THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA APPLY TO TRANSCRIPTION PARAMETERS PRIOR TO CONDENSING 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

6. 

7. 

Letter Quality: The type shall be letter quality.  Use of script or dot matrix is not 
acceptable. 

Type Size: The letter character size shall be 10 characters to the inch.  This provides for 
approximately 63 characters to each line. 

Number of Lines Per Page: Each page of transcription shall contain 25 lines of text, except the 
last page, which may contain fewer lines of text but must have 25 numbered lines in any event.  
Page numbers or notations are not to be considered part of the 25 lines of text. 

Margins: Text is to begin on each page at the 1.62-inch left margin and continue to the 
.5-inch right margin.  This provides for 6.38 inches of text per line inside the left and right marginal 
lines. 

Spacing: Lines of transcript text shall be double-spaced. 

Hyphenation/Word Division: Commonly accepted rules for proper hyphenation are to be 
followed.  Hyphens are to be used when words or names are spelled out.  Words are not to be 
hyphenated at the end of a line and hyphens are not to be separated at the end of a line. 

Paragraphing: The purpose of paragraphing is to make reading easier, clearer, and 
smoother.  One-sentence paragraphs are undesirable and shall be avoided when possible, as 
well as paragraphs comprised of one or more pages of transcript. Paragraphing must remain 
consistent throughout the transcript.  There shall be a new paragraph for each new speaker. 

8. 

Indentations: 

a. 

b. 

Q and A.  All Q and A designations shall begin at the left margin.  The statement following 
the Q and A begins on the sixth space from the left margin.  Subsequent lines begin on 
the sixth space from the left margin. 

Colloquy.  Speaker identification begins on the sixth space from the left margin 
followed directly by a colon.  The statement begins on the third space after the colon.  
Subsequent lines begin at the left margin. 

9. 

Legibility: The original transcript and each copy is to be legible without any interlineation 
materially defacing the transcript.

G. 

FORM 

The court system uses a condensed form for transcripts.  A party who is responsible for preparation of a 
transcript is required to use the condensed form described below.  We will not accept a transcript volume 
comprised of more than 240 sheets of paper (960 condensed pages). 

Remember: Do not split a day’s proceedings between two volumes. 

1. 

Condensed Form: The following specifications apply to condensed form transcripts: 

a. 

Condensing software must first be approved by ACS with respect to its legibility and 
must produce a page layout arranged as follows: 

b. 

c. 

The following pages must be full-size: volume title page, table of contents, and 
certificate.  These pages are to be counted in the 240-page total of condensed 
transcripts. 

If an electronic version of the transcript is required, the electronic version must be in the 
original, non-condensed form.  This will allow anyone who has difficulty reading the 
condensed form to print a full-size version of the transcript.

The following section is applicable to transcripts prepared by private transcribers (not on contract with the 
Alaska Court System): 

d. 

e. 

Condensed pages must be duplexed, that is, copied on both sides of the paper.  Non-
condensed pages (the volume title page, table of contents, and certificate) must be 
single-sided and are counted in the total 120 pages of condensed, duplexed transcript. 

Tape binding is preferred for condensed transcripts; however, if the transcript is tape-
bound, the front and back covers must be yellow cover stock (at least 65-lb. weight) and 
each volume must be limited to 120 sheets of paper, including front and back covers.   
Covers may be heavyweight transparent plastic, yellow cover stock (at least 65-lb. weight) 
or another material approved in advance by the Alaska Court System.  Multiple volumes 
should be approximately equal in size. 

Each volume must be separately secured on the left side with a permanent fastener or 
binding, such as an ACCO fastener, staples, a report cover, a spiral binding, a comb 
(GBC) binding, or tape binding.  Other fasteners or bindings must be approved in 
advance by the Alaska Court System. 

It is preferable to have one large volume consisting of several days' proceedings, rather 
than several small volumes each consisting of only one day.  Do not split one day's 
proceedings between two volumes. 

H. 

COPIES 

Pursuant to Appellate Rule 210(b)(5), in cases on appeal to the Alaska Supreme Court or the Court of 
Appeals, a transcriber must file with the court one hard copy of the transcript in condensed format and an 
electronic version. 

1.  HARD COPIES 

2.  ELECTRONIC COPIES 

Condensed transcript copies are to be reproduced by any method of reproduction that produces black text 
on white paper.  There shall be no markings on the original or copies that would hinder clear reproduction 
by mechanical means by any court official or party. 

Electronic copies must be submitted on a CD-R disc.  A transcript shall be formatted in WordPerfect for  
Windows or Microsoft Word.  The electronic version of a transcript may not be in condensed format. 

I. 

MEDIA LABELING 

The CD-R disc must be labeled using a CD labeler or permanent marker and contain the following information: 

•  Appeal Number 
•  Case Caption 
• 
• 

Trial Court Case Number 
Transcriber’s Business Name and Phone Number

CHAPTER II 

FORMAT 

 

A transcript may include more than one proceeding in a case held on separate days.  For example, if instructed to 
transcribe several separate proceedings in one case, such as the arraignment, evidentiary hearing, the trial, and 
sentencing, each held on separate days, the four proceedings would be one transcript volume, provided that the 
combined days do not exceed 240 single sheets of paper.  (Section G) 

A. 

VOLUMES 

More than one day of proceedings may be contained in a volume.  Follow guidelines for number of pages 
in a volume.  Do not split a day’s proceeding between two volumes.  Each volume must contain: 

Volume title page (Appendix B). 

Day page (Appendix E). 

Transcribed proceedings (Appendix G). 

First volume must contain a table of contents (if required) for all volumes (Appendix C and 
D). 

Last volume must contain a certificate (Appendix H). 

B. 

VOLUME TITLE PAGE  

The volume title page (Appendix B) is an introductory page showing the following information: 

1.

each day page number and ending with the last page number of each day.  In some instances, the 
volume title page and the day page may be combined (Section E). 

8. 

Alaska Court System disclaimer 

C. 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

The table of contents is a list of important events in a transcript and lists the page number in the transcript 
on which they appear (Appendix C and D).  If a witness testifies on redirect, recross, and redirect again, 
the first page number is shown, a slash bar, then the second page number (Appendix C).  A transcript 
must include a table of contents whenever a transcript contains any of the following: 

1. 
2. 
3. 

Any witnesses; 
Any exhibits admitted; or 
More than one day of proceedings of a different nature 

Multi-volume transcripts contain only one table of contents for the entire transcript, and it follows the first 
volume page immediately preceding the first day page.  The table of contents must indicate: 

(a) 

Each proceeding in a transcript (for example, arraignment, bail hearing, trial by jury, 
sentencing, etc.).  The title of the proceedings for the table of contents must

read the same as it appears on the day page.  Only the first day of trial should be listed if 
multiple days.  See Appendix C for example.

Examples of important events in each proceeding are:

Jury selection 
Opening statements 
Witnesses 
Exhibits 
Closing arguments 
Verdict 

(c) 

(d) 

(e) 

The names of witnesses, on whose behalf the witnesses were called, the type of 
examination (direct, cross, redirect, recross, rebuttal, surrebuttal), and the page number 
where the witness's name appears.  A witness’s name is to be typed on the table of 
contents exactly as it appears in the transcript; i.e., middle initial/no middle initial, full 
name, Jr., etc.  Rebuttal and surrebuttal witness set-ups are also listed on the table of 
contents (Appendix C). 

Voir dire examination is not shown on the table of contents.  If a witness's testimony is 
interrupted by voir dire and the original examination is continued, there is no need to 
show the interruption on the table of contents.  If a witness is interrupted by another 
witness and the original examination is then resumed, show the first page number, 
followed by a slash bar, then show the second page number on the table of contents 
where the examination is continued (Appendix C). 

A list of exhibits admitted into evidence.  The list is to indicate the exhibit number, a brief 
description of the exhibit, and the page number where the exhibit was admitted.  Exhibits 
identified, but not admitted, are not shown on the table of contents or in the transcript.  If 
exhibits 1 through 10 are all photographs and are admitted on the same page, combine 
the exhibits 1 through 10 on the table of contents and show one brief description and only 
one page number (Appendix C). 

The page number for the table of contents showing the verdict is the page number 
where the court comes back on record after deliberations and receives the verdict from 
the foreperson. 

D. 

DAY PAGE  

Information for the day page (Appendix E) is obtained from the in-court clerk’s log notes or tags (Appendix 
Z and AA).  Each day of proceedings must begin with a day page indicating: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

Nature of proceeding 

Name and title of judge or other official presiding 

Location of proceeding, date, and beginning time 

Appearances for the parties (name and address of each attorney and for whom they appear).  
When typing the day page, do not use abbreviations; for example, West Fourth Avenue, not W. 4th 
Ave. or Anchorage, Alaska, not Anchorage, AK.  A private person who acts as the person’s own 
attorney is designated as In Propria Persona.  This term is listed in place of Attorney at Law or 
Assistant Public Defender, etc. (Appendix A).  If no parties are present, indicate none on the day 
page (Appendix F). 

Also Present.  For example, Department of Corrections, social workers, etc.  Use the in-court 
clerk’s log notes to indicate the names of persons present.  If someone other than a witness or a 
party speaks for the record, they shall be identified on the day page (Appendix P) from information 
contained in the log notes.  If an attorney appears on behalf of a witness testifying in a trial, the

COMBINATION VOLUME TITLE/DAY PAGE  

If a volume consists of a proceeding that is no longer than one day in length, and there are no witnesses or 
exhibits, a combination volume title/day page is used that includes all the information required for a volume 
title page and all the information for a day page.  No separate day page is required and no table of 
contents is required.  If a combination volume title/day page is used, the words TRANSCRIPT OF 
precedes the nature of the proceedings (Appendix A). 

F. 

CONTENT 

1. 

Verbal 

Except as noted below, the transcript shall be verbatim and contain all words and other verbal 
expressions uttered during the proceeding: 

Striking Portions of the Proceeding: No portion of the proceeding is to be omitted from 
the record by an order to strike.  Regardless of the requesting party, material ordered 
stricken and the order to strike must all appear in the transcript. 

Editing of Speech: The transcript shall provide a verbatim record of words spoken in 
the proceedings.  All grammatical errors, changes of thought, contractions, 
misstatements, and poorly constructed sentences shall be transcribed as spoken.  In 
the interest of readability, however, stutters, ums, ahs and uhs, and other verbal tics are 
not normally included in transcripts, but such verbalizations shall be transcribed 
whenever their exclusion could change a statement’s meaning. 

Examples of Exceptions:

Reporting of Audio/Video Recordings: Generally, audio/video recordings played in 
court are entered as an exhibit in a proceeding.  Since such recordings are under the 
direct control of the court, audio/video recordings need not be transcribed unless 
otherwise instructed to do so.  Indicate the beginning log number where the recording 
starts, the summary phrase (Audio played) or (Video played), and the ending log number 
where the playing of the recording stops. 

If a recording is started and one small portion or sentence is played, then stopped, 
questions and answers, then playing of another small section, do not show log 
numbers in that instance, but rather at the beginning and end of the audio playing. 
(Appendix W). 

If a witness narrates a video as it is being played, show log numbers at the beginning 
and conclusion of the video only.

Identification of Speakers 

All speakers are properly identified throughout the transcript by using MR. or MS. and their last 
name.  The judge is identified as THE COURT, the in-court clerk is identified as THE CLERK, the 
bailiff as THE BAILIFF, and the officer responsible for escorting in-custody defendants to the 
courtroom as JUDICIAL SERVICES OFFICER. 

During examination of a juror or a witness under oath, the juror or witness is identified only as A.  
The attorney who is conducting the questioning is identified only as Q.  There is no punctuation 
following Q or A.

Before a jury has been selected, they are identified as THE PANEL.  After a jury has been selected 
and sworn, the jury is identified as THE JURY. 

When a juror speaks whose name is not ever spoken, he should be identified as 
UNIDENTIFIED JUROR. 

All other unidentified persons speaking on the record are identified as UNIDENTIFIED VOICE, 
not UNIDENTIFIED MALE or FEMALE.  If an unidentified voice is later identified for the record, 
once you learn that person’s identification, you should replace the unidentified voice with the 
person’s name throughout the entire transcript. 

Sometimes the defense or prosecution agency attorneys are not identified on the record or in the 
log notes.  You should first contact the Statewide Transcript Office to see if they have or can 
obtain that information for you.  If, however, the name cannot be obtained, the attorney would 
then be identified in the transcript as UNIDENTIFIED DISTRICT ATTORNEY, UNIDENTIFIED 
PUBLIC DEFENDER, or UNIDENTIFIED MUNICIPAL ATTORNEY. 

4. 

Examination of Witnesses 

a. 

Witness Identification 

When a witness testifies, the witness setup is as follows: 

Use the parenthetical (Oath administered) instead of typing out the oath, and 
then identify the witness by name and type the witness’s response as shown 
below.  The witness’s name is then centered and in caps.  Do not bold or 
underline. 

On the next line, starting at the left margin, is a brief statement indicating called 
as a witness on behalf of the plaintiff/defendant, testified as follows on: 

If a party testifies on his/her own behalf, type the phrase called as a 
witness on his/her own behalf, testified as follows on:  For each type of 
examination thereafter, this line is abbreviated to indicate testified as 
follows on: 

On the next line, centered and in caps, is the type of examination such as 
DIRECT, CROSS, REDIRECT, RECROSS, or continued examination. 

On the next line starting at the left margin, identify the person 
questioning.

called as  a  rebuttal  witness  on  behalf  of  the  plaintiff,  testified  as  follows  on:    If  the 
defendant  calls further  witnesses,  this  is  called  surrebuttal  and  would  follow  the  setup  above, 
substituting surrebuttal  in  place  of  rebuttal.

Types of Examination 

(1) 

Direct Examination is questioning by the attorney who has called the witness. 
Usually, a witness is questioned only once on direct examination during 
proceedings of the same nature.  Exceptions are: 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

If there is more than one attorney representing a party, or if two or 
more attorneys are questioning on the same type of examination, in 
this case only the attorney introduction line is shown. 

If a witness is called a second time on behalf of the opposing party. 

During an offer of proof.  However, an offer of proof is only 
identified in a transcript when it is so referenced on record. 

If a witness testifies telephonically, indicate in the initial witness setup called as 
a witness on behalf of the plaintiff, testified telephonically as follows on:  The 
word (telephonically) is also to be noted on the table of contents (Appendix C). 

Cross Examination is questioning by the opposing attorney.  A witness is 
usually questioned only once on cross examination with the same exceptions 
as noted for direct examination. 

Redirect Examination is questioning again by the first attorney, re-
examining the witness on matters raised on cross examination. 

Recross Examination is questioning by the opposing attorney 
re-examining the witness on matters raised on redirect.  Attorneys may question 
in turn several times on redirect and recross.  If this occurs, page numbers on 
the table of contents are indicated using slash bars for each page number 
(Appendix C).  While you may have redirect examination of a witness without 
recross examination, there cannot be recross examination without redirect 
examination.  Example: If a witness testifies on direct examination, cross 
examination, and there is no redirect examination, but the attorney questioning 
on cross has further cross, this is shown in the set-up as cross examination 
continued, and would be listed on the table of contents with a slash. 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

(5) 

Continued Examination is used in the following circumstances.  The word 
CONTINUED is included on the examination line when: 

(a) 

Questioning of a witness has been interrupted by one or more pages 
of argument, voir dire examination, or offers of proof.  The full witness 
setup need not be repeated except after an offer of proof.  The type of 
continued examination and the attorney’s introduction line is included. 

THE COURT:  Do you want to be heard further, 

MR. SMITH:  No, Your Honor. 
THE COURT:  You may continue with cross.

At the beginning of a new day, when questioning under the same type 
of examination as the end of the previous day is resumed, or if a 
witness’s testimony has been interrupted by testimony of another 
witness.  In this instance, the entire witness setup is required with the 
words previously sworn preceding called as a witness.

DIRECT EXAMINATION CONTINUED 

 

(6) 

Offer of Proof is testimony through questions and answers of a witness, or 
through an attorney’s own narrative description.  It usually occurs outside the 
presence of the jury.  An offer of proof differs from voir dire examination only by 
the fact that it is referred to as an offer of proof by the judge or one of the 
attorneys.  If an offer of proof comes in through testimony, the witness is set up 
on direct examination as  follows:

If the same witness testifies for the first time after the offer of proof, the entire 
witness setup is required as shown in the sample on page 10(5). 

If the offer of proof interrupted ongoing examination of the same witness, set 
the witness up as follows: 

Witness Setup Following Offer of Proof 

JOHN DOE 

testified as follows on: 

DIRECT EXAMINATION CONTINUED 

BY MR. SMITH:

The witness’s name is to be shown as direct examination on the table of 
contents with the notation (by offer of proof) on the line below the witness’s 
name (example following).  If the offer of proof has interrupted ongoing 
testimony, the witness’s name would appear twice on the table of contents, 
separated by a slash bar (example following).

(7) 

Voir Dire Examination is used during jury selection when a prospective juror is 
questioned as to the juror’s qualifications.  In this instance, the words VOIR 
DIRE OF MARY JOHNSON is to be centered and in caps.  The next line is the 
attorney/judge identification line as in any examination.  When the second 
attorney or judge questions the juror, only the attorney/court introduction line is 
shown. 

Voir dire examination is used when the court questions a witness for one or 
more pages, or when the testimony of a witness is interrupted by the opposing 
attorney who wishes to question the witness on a particular subject.  It is usually 
referred to as voir dire, but not always.  The jury may or may not be excused, 
however, if the jury is excused and questioning continues out of their presence, 
this is voir dire examination. 

 

DIRECT EXAMINATION 

BY MR. JONES: 
Q  Did you say that you saw the defendant at noon? 
A 

Yes, he was on Hanover Street at noon. 
MR. SMITH: Your Honor, may I voir dire the witness?

As in the above example, at the conclusion of voir dire examination, the original 
examination is set up as continued, along with the attorney identification line. 

Page numbering for the table of contents will show the page number of the 
original examination, a slash bar, and the page number where the original 
examination is resumed after the voir dire examination.  Voir dire is NOT 
shown on the table of contents. 

If the court or counsel conduct voir dire examination of a witness who has not 
been set up as a witness at the beginning of a new day, set the witness up as 
follows:

interrupted by another witness, the entire witness setup is required using the 
phrase previously sworn.

5. 

Breaks in Speech 

Often, a speaker will break speech mid-sentence.  This is indicated in the transcript in one of 
several ways described below. 

a. 

Dashes: A series of two dashes (--) is used to show: 

(1) 

Changes of Thought: When the speaker has a change of thought leaving a 
sentence unfinished to begin a new one: 

Q 

A 

Now, Mr. Smith, what did you -- where were you at the time in 
question? 

(2) 

Repetition: When a speaker repeats a word or phrase: 

When I left the house -- when I left the house that day, I was 
running late for work. 

(3) 

Mid-word: When a speaker leaves a word unfinished or starts another word: 

(4) 

(5) 

(6) 

Q 

Abou -- approximately what time of day do you believe that was? 

Interruptions: Occasionally, a speaker will be interrupted by another speaker 
before completing the sentence.  Should this happen, the interrupted sentence 
would end with two dashes, with one space between the last word and the 
beginning of the dashes. If the speaker resumes the sentence after the 
interruption has ended, two dashes would appear at the beginning of the 
resumed sentence with one space after the dashes and before the next word: 

MR. JOHNSON: Our company’s promise is to produce a high -- MR. 
WILLIAMS: Tell me how -- 
MR. JOHNSON:  -- quality, inexpensive product, finished on time. 

Fade Out: If a speaker fades out before ending a sentence, the two 
dashes are used: 

MR. JOHNSON:  When we concluded yesterday you were explaining -- 

Change of Addressee: When an attorney who is questioning a witness 
interrupts a question mid-sentence to address the court or any courtroom 
participant other than the witness, this is shown by the two dashes. 
When addressing the witness, type Q.  When addressing the court or any other 
courtroom participant, type the introduction line of Mr., Ms., etc.: 

Q 

You were explaining to us yesterday how -- 

MR. JOHNSON: Mr. Williams, may I have that exhibit you were using 

yesterday? 

Q 

Would you explain what's illustrated on this exhibit, Exhibit 2? 

Do not use punctuation before or after the dash: 

Incorrect:  Okay, sir, -- okay.  Then what? 
Okay, sir -- okay.  Then what? 
Correct: 

Do not split the two dashes at the end of a line. 

Manual of Transcript Procedures 
February 2023 

14 

b. 

Editing: With the exception of a judge or an attorney, all other speakers are to be 
transcribed verbatim.  If a judge or an attorney repeats exact words or partial phrases, 
only the first repeated word or partial phrase need be transcribed.  Changes of thought 
containing whole phrases are transcribed in full.  If spoken by a judge or counsel, edit 
as follows: 

“Did -- did you -- did you know” and “Did you -- did you know” are 
transcribed as “Did you know.” 

“Did you go -- well, let me ask you this” involves a whole phrase and is 
transcribed as it is spoken. 

Do not edit stress points or words repeated for emphasis.  For example, “Only 
then, only then did he admit he had a problem.” 

6. 

Indistinct Portions 

Occasionally when transcribing, there may be a word or words that cannot be heard or are 
garbled.  Make every effort to transcribe it, but do not guess.  If the phrase still cannot be 
deciphered, use one of the following summary phrases to clearly show the portion not transcribed. 

a. 

Indiscernible: When a word or phrase is unintelligible and cannot be transcribed, it is 
indicated by the word (indiscernible).  If the indiscernible phrase is the first word in a 
sentence, it should be capitalized.  A description may be used for why the word or 
phrase was indiscernible.  Examples: 

(indiscernible - away from microphone) 

(indiscernible - interrupted) 

(indiscernible - simultaneous speech) 

(indiscernible - cough) 

(indiscernible - voice lowered) 

(indiscernible - recording malfunction) 

(1) 

(2) 

(3)

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

(5) 

(6) 

b. 

Inaudible Reply: Occasionally, a witness may answer by a shake or nod of the head 
that obviously is not recorded.  If a question has clearly been asked and there is no 
audible answer, this is shown as a summary phrase (No audible response). 

If any sound is heard that may be interpreted as the witness’s reply but it is indistinct, 
type the word (Indiscernible). 

7. 

Pauses 

Often, there will be silence during proceedings.  Unless these pauses are at least one 
minute or more in duration, they are not indicated in the transcript.  Pauses are depicted in two 
ways.  If the pause occurs while a person is speaking, type the word (pause) on the same line and 
resume transcribing after the pause.  If the pause occurs between speakers, type the word (Pause) 
on a separate line.  If the pause occurs because a witness is being summoned, type the summary 
phrase (Witness summoned) on a separate line. 

MR. SMITH: I'd ask you to turn to page 10 in particular.  (Pause)  I'm going to continue 

my examination while they review that document. 

MR. SMITH: I'd ask you to turn to page 10 in particular. 
(Pause) 
THE COURT: You may continue your examination while they are reviewing that 

document.

a. 

Whenever an exhibit is ordered admitted by the court, the following phrase, in 
parentheses, is typed on a separate line, flush with the right margin: 

THE COURT: 1 is admitted. 

MR. SMITH:  Thank you, Your Honor. 

(Plaintiff’s exhibit 1 admitted) 

b. 

Occasionally, an exhibit may be admitted with no obvious verbal proof in the oral 
record, but the clerk will indicate admission in the log notes or in the exhibit list.  If the 
admission is only reflected in the exhibit list, note (per exhibit list) in the table of 
contents instead of the page number.  If noted in the log notes, show the admission of 
the exhibit in the transcript at whatever point the log notes indicate: 

Example: 

(Plaintiff's exhibit 2 admitted - see clerk's log notes) 
(Plaintiff's exhibit 2 admitted off record) 

c. 

If other actions are taken after an exhibit is admitted, note them as follows: 

(Plaintiff’s exhibit 2 re-admitted) 
(Plaintiff’s exhibit 2 withdrawn) 
(Plaintiff’s exhibit A re-admitted as plaintiff’s exhibit 2) 

d. 

Any exhibits admitted during a recess are noted in the log notes and must be noted 
in the body of the transcript as shown below.  This is to be located immediately 
following the recess notation. 

(Court recessed) 

THE CLERK:  This court resumes its session.

Word Usage 

a. 

b. 

Phonetic: If the correct spelling of a word or name cannot be ascertained after a diligent 
search using available resources such as Internet search engines, CourtView, or other 
research materials, type the word as it sounds phonetically, followed with (ph).  Use the 
(ph) each time the word or name is transcribed. 

Sic: If a non-existent word is used, type the non-existent word with the word [sic] 
in brackets immediately following the word. 

Example: 

John was told by his doctor that what he was suffering from 
rheumatic [sic] arthritis. 

Witness's name is Christine, but she is constantly referred to as 
Christina [sic]. 

Case number 3AN-12-00011CR; misstated as 3AN-11-00012CR [sic]. 

c. 

Incorrect term: Should a speaker use a term that is known to be incorrect, type the 
term as spoken followed by the word [sic] in brackets. 

Example: 

Harry and Tom is [sic] two of my best friends. 

While explaining to a group of scholars his theory of relativity Einstein 
misinterpret [sic] part of his theory.

Grammar and Punctuation 

a. 

Capitalization: To simplify format uniformity, capitalization is limited as closely as possible 
to proper nouns, such as names, dates, addresses, direct personal titles, company names, 
countries, states, races, nationalities, and acronyms (used instead of organization names, 
for example: FBI, CIA, DA, OPA, and PD). 

Examples: 

When the judge was handing down his sentence, Mr. Smith did not 

seem surprised.

b. 

Numbers: 

(1) 

Numbers written out are the figures one through nine, fractions less than one 
(e.g., two-thirds, three-quarters), and numbers at the beginning of a sentence, 
except those listed below.  All numbers 10 and above are to be written in figures 
(e. g., 10, 11, 12).  If a speaker says the word number preceding one through 
nine, type number 1, number 2.  If a speaker says a hundred, type a hundred; 
but if a speaker says one hundred, type 100. 

(2) 

The following numbers are written in figures even at the beginning of a 
sentence: 

(a) 

Exhibit numbers, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.:

Interpreters 

When a witness speaks limited or no English, an interpreter is used whose sole purpose is to 
literally translate the questions from English to the foreign language and the answers to English. 

a. 

b. 

Literal Translation: A literal translation is when the attorney asks questions and the 
interpreter answers the question for the witness in the first person.  The witness setup is 
as follows in the text box below. 

Non-literal Translation: At times, an attorney will lapse into third person when asking 
questions, or the interpreter will lapse into the third person when translating a witness’s 
answer.  When this occurs, the non-literal translation is transcribed as shown in the sample 
in the following text box: 

called as a witness on behalf of the defendant, testified by and through 
his interpreter, Ralph Smith, as follows on:

GRAND JURY PROCEEDINGS  

A. 

Grand Jury Proceedings 

The format for a grand jury transcript varies slightly.  The only participants in a grand jury proceeding are the 
district attorney, the in-court clerk, and the members of the grand jury.  There is no judge, defense counsel, 
or defendant present.  The district attorney and the grand jurors question the witnesses on direct 
examination.  There is no cross examination. 

Grand jury proceedings are usually short, lasting one day or less.  Though there is a limited table of contents, a 
combination Volume Title/Day Page (Appendix J) is used unless the proceeding is more than one day, in which 
case a Volume Page and a Day Page would be required (Appendix K and L). 

There is a limited table of contents for grand jury proceedings, listing the witness’s name and the page number 
where the name appears in the transcript.  Exhibits are not shown on a grand jury table of contents.

In a grand jury proceeding, the clerk is administered an oath by the foreperson of the jury to keep secret 
the proceeding.  This oath is to be shown in the transcript as a summary phrase (Oath 
administered to clerk) in parentheses.  On the next line, type the words THE CLERK followed by the clerk’s 
response.  The clerk or the foreperson may swear in the witnesses. 

After the clerk is sworn in, the district attorney will introduce the case and read the indictment, the statutes, 
and the definitions contained in the statutes. 

The district attorney is referred to as MR. SMITH or MS. SMITH.  The clerk is referred to as THE CLERK.  
The foreperson is referred to as THE FOREPERSON.  The jurors are referred to as 
UNIDENTIFIED JUROR, unless the name has been previously stated: JUROR SMITH: 

Witnesses  called  to  testify  before  a  grand  jury  are  not  testifying  on  behalf  of  any  party.  The  witness 
shall be  set up  as  follows:

The district attorney questions the witness first.  When questioning has concluded, the district attorney will 
ask the grand jurors if they have any questions (Page 15, Editing).  There is no cross examination.  When 
the grand jurors ask questions, do not set the witness up again.  Simply type BY UNIDENTIFIED 
JURORS and continue with Q and A.

A witness may testify, be excused, another witness may testify, and then the first witness be recalled to testify 
again.  Should this occur, the witness is set up as previously sworn and the witness would be on direct 
examination continued.  List both page numbers on the table of contents separated with a slash bar where 
the witness’s name appears (Appendix C).

If the district attorney states that an exhibit is admitted, transcribe the district attorney stating the exhibit is 
admitted, but do not designate the admission on a separate line as in a trial.  Grand jury exhibits are not 
shown on the table of contents. 

At the conclusion of all testimony before the grand jury, the district attorney will submit the case to the jury 
for deliberations and go off record.  After deliberations, everyone will come back on record.  The district 
attorney will ask if the grand jury has reached a decision.  The foreperson will state whether the grand jury 
has voted a true bill or no true bill on each of the counts in the indictment.  Count numbers in an indictment 
are written in Roman numerals: Count I, Count II, Count III. 

At the conclusion of the grand jury proceedings, type a summary phrase (Off record) in parentheses beginning 
on the sixth space from the left margin.  On the next line, type the ending log number/time at the left margin.  
On the following line, centered, in caps and in bold, type the words END OF REQUESTED PORTION.  

MR. SMITH: That concludes this case.  I’ll withdraw  the exhibits

CHAPTER VI  

CLASSIFICATION OF TRANSCRIPT ERRORS 

Transcripts prepared for the Alaska Court System by transcribers employed by the court system or under contract with 
the court system must comply with Part I and Part II of this manual.  Some deviations from the manual are 
acceptable.  Others are not.  These standards were developed for transcribers under contract with the Alaska Court 
System to explain what the court system regards as minor errors that can be overlooked, and what it regards as major 
errors that compromise the quality of the transcript.  Transcripts prepared for the court system must be at least 99.95 
percent accurate.  To determine the accuracy rate of a transcript, the court system considers the allowable number of 
major errors in a random sample. 

A. 

FORMAT 

The Alaska Court System (ACS) expects contractors to follow the format requirements set out in this manual 
including all amendments thereto.  A transcript that contains any of the following format errors will be returned 
for correction: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

6. 

7. 

Information on volume title page or day page is inaccurate; 

No table of contents; 

Table of contents does not contain all required information or contains inaccurate 
information (e.g., incorrect page numbers, etc.); 

Page numbering does not comply with the manual or with special instructions given by the 
transcript coordinator (or another ACS employee); 

Tape and log numbers in the transcript are omitted or are incorrect; 

Any errors contained in the certificate, or no certificate; 

Any other significant departures from the format required by the manual. 

B. 

VERBATIM ERRORS 

The Manual of Transcript Procedures (form TF-410) requires that a transcript contain all words and other 
verbal expressions uttered during the course of the proceeding.  Limited exceptions to this requirement are 
listed in Part I of this manual: II(F)(1) and II(F)(5)(c). 

The following minor verbatim errors are also acceptable; however, the major verbatim errors listed on pages 
30, 31, and 32 are counted when determining the accuracy rate of a transcript. 

1. 

MINOR verbatim errors are defined as follows: 

a. 

Omission of a spoken word that does not affect the meaning of the sentence: 
Examples: 

Recorded: 
Transcribed:

That's all I have, Your Honor.  Thank you. 
That's all I have, Your Honor. 

b. 

The omission of uh-huh (affirmative) when used by someone who is merely following what 
another person is saying is correct; however, the omission of uh-huh (affirmative) when 
used as an expression of assent is a major verbatim error:

PUNCTUATION  

D. 

SPELLING 

The Alaska Court System expects transcribers to use commonly accepted rules for punctuation.  In 
determining the accuracy rate of a transcript, the court system only counts punctuation errors that alter the 
meaning of the record as a major error. 

A transcript that has an average of more than two spelling errors per page will be returned for 
correction.  A word phonetically spelled will not be classified as a misspelled word.  A typographical error 
will be classified as a misspelled word.  Transcribers are to use the ‘Spell Check’ feature on computer 
software. 

Correct spelling of homonyms is required.  Examples: to, too, and two; there, their, and they’re; principal 
and principle; etc. 

Transcribers are expected to refer to specialty dictionaries (such as medical, legal, etc.) and to use other 
reference material (such as phone directories, CourtView, online maps, etc.) when necessary to achieve 
correct spellings. 

E. 

INDISCERNIBLE 

The Alaska Court System expects transcribers to tune in to individual channels on transcribing equipment to 
assist in clarifying INDISCERNIBLES.  In determining the accuracy rate of a transcript, the court system 
counts as a major error an indiscernible that is discernible to the transcript coordinator (or another ACS 
employee) when listening to the same recordings used by the transcriber, except in the circumstances listed 
below: 

1. 

2. 

Bench Conferences.  Until the recording quality of bench conferences improves, transcribers are 
only required to transcribe what is discernible to them after listening a minimum of one minute.  
Transcripts will not be rejected because of INDISCERNIBLE in a bench conference unless the 
transcriber failed to transcribe speech that was discernible to the transcript coordinator (or another 
ACS employee) after listening to the conference no less than one minute. 

Speech Away from a Microphone and Telephonic Speech.  Transcribers must attempt to 
transcribe what is said by speakers who have stepped away from a microphone and by speakers 
who are participating telephonically.  However, if after a reasonable time (one minute minimum), the 
transcriber cannot discern what was said, the transcriber must type a summary phrase in 
parentheses, such as (Indiscernible - away from microphone) or (Indiscernible - telephonic speech).   
Transcripts will not be rejected because of INDISCERNIBLES that are marked in this manner, unless 
the transcriber failed to transcribe speech that was discernible to the transcript coordinator (or 
another ACS employee) after listening to that portion of the audio no less than one minute. 

F. 

TRANSCRIBER AUDIO EVALUATION 

All transcribers employed by the Alaska Court System or under contract with the court system must submit a 
completed Transcriber Audio Evaluation form (Appendix X).

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
