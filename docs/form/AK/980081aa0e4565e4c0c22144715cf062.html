Child Support.  The court finds that  
has a legal obligation to support the above child(ren). 

 [name  of  obligor] 

It is ordered that the obligor shall pay child support for the child(ren) named above as 
follows: [Put the current number of children on the first line.  Subtract one number on 
each subsequent line and do the calculations for each line.]

Except  as  provided  below,  as  each  child  reaches  the  age  of  18,  is  otherwise  legally 
emancipated or dies, the amount of support will change to the next lower amount.  
Support must continue while each child is 18 years  old if the child is  (1) unmarried, 
(2) actively pursuing a high school diploma or equivalent level of technical or vocational 
training, and (3) living as a dependent with the obligee parent or guardian or a designee 
of the parent or guardian, unless the following box is checked: 
Child support will end when each child reaches age 18.

Extended Visitation Credit [available only in primary custody situations]. 

Primary  physical  custody  of  the  child(ren)  listed  in  paragraph  2(a)  or  2(b)  has  been 
given  to  the  non-obligor  parent.    However,  the  obligor  parent  shall  have  physical 
custody of this/these child(ren) for the following period(s) of over 27 consecutive days: 
 
If this visitation is exercised, child support is reduced for the above period(s) as follows: 
 
[This reduction may not exceed 75% of the amount owed for the period.] 
If this visitation is not exercised, child support is not reduced.  Civil Rule 90.3(a)(3). 

 

 

5. 

Application of Civil Rule 90.3 Formula. 

The amount of child support in paragraph 3 was determined pursuant to:  

  The formula in Civil Rule 90.3(a) or (b). 

  90.3(c)(2).  Obligor’s adjusted annual income is over $126,000. 

  90.3(c)(3).  Obligor’s calculated amount of support is less than $600 per year so 
the $600 minimum was ordered.  Obligor’s income is low because obligor is: 

  incarcerated. 
  unable to work because  
  other  

 
 

  90.3(c)(1).    The  court  finds  good  cause  upon  proof  by  clear  and  convincing 
evidence  that  manifest  injustice  would  result  if  the  support  award  were  not 
varied.  Reason(s) for the variation:

union,  or  otherwise.    Name  and  address  of  employer/union  through  which 
 
insurance will be purchased:   
 
 
The insurance cost (currently $  
 per  month)  will  be  divided 
between the parents equally unless a different division of the cost is ordered.  

he child support calculation in paragraph 3 includes: 

  T

Medical  Support  Order.    AS  25.27.060(c)  and  Civil  Rule  90.3(d)(1).    This  order 
concerns health insurance for the child(ren) covered by this child support order.  It does 
not concern health insurance for any other child(ren) or for the parents. 

a.  Current Coverage. 

  a credit of $ 

 per  month  (50%  of  the  cost  to  the  obligor)  for 
health  insurance  purchased  for  the  child(ren)  by  the  obligor.    If  the 
obligor  fails  to  purchase  the  insurance,  the  monthly  child  support 
obligation will increase by this amount, without further order of the court, 
until  the  obligor  purchases  the  insurance  and  provides  proof  of  the 
purchase  to  the  other  parent  and  to  the  Child  Support  Services  Division 
(CSSD) if CSSD is handling collections. 

  an extra $  

 per  month  (50%  of  the  cost  to  the  obligee)  for 
health  insurance  purchased  for  the  child(ren)  by  the  obligee.    If  the 
obligee  fails  to  purchase  the  insurance,  the  monthly  child  support 
obligation  will  decrease  by  this  amount,  without  further  order  of  the 
court, until the obligee purchases the insurance and provides proof of the 
purchase  to  the  other  parent  and  to  the  Child  Support  Services  Division 
(CSSD) if CSSD is handling collections. 
 

If the cost of the insurance changes, the amount of the child support obligation 
will  be  adjusted  accordingly,  without  further  order  of  the  court.    The  parent 
purchasing  the  insurance  shall  provide  documentation  of  the  change  to  the 
other  parent  and  to  the  Child  Support  Services  Division  (CSSD)  if  CSSD  is 
handling  collections.    If  either  parent  believes  the  cost  of  the  insurance  has 
become  unreasonable,  that  parent  may  file  a  motion  asking  the  court  to 
suspend the requirement that insurance be purchased. 

 

  The child(ren) is/are eligible for services through 

  the Indian Health Service 

  military medical benefits 

but  these  services  are  not  available  in  the  area  where  the  child(ren)  live(s).  
Therefore,  insurance  must  be  purchased  as  stated  above  until  these  services 
become available.

  The child(ren) is/are eligible for services through  

  the Indian Health Service 

  military medical benefits 

and  these  services  are  available  to  the  child(ren).    Therefore,  no  additional 
insurance is required while these services are available. 

  Health insurance for the child(ren) is not now available at reasonable cost or its 

availability is unknown. 

Future  Coverage.    If  there  is  no  health  care  coverage  for  the  child(ren)  and 
insurance becomes available to a parent at a reasonable cost, that parent must 
purchase  the  insurance  after  giving  notice  to  the  other  parent.  The  cost  of  the 
insurance must be divided between the parents equally unless a different division 
of  the  cost  is  ordered.    Without  further  order  of  the  court,  the  monthly  child 
support obligation will increase by 50% of the cost of the insurance if the obligee 
purchases  it  and  decrease  by  50%  of  the  cost  of  the  insurance  if  the  obligor 
purchases  it,  unless  otherwise  ordered.    If  the  parents  disagree  about  whether 
the  cost  of  insurance  is  reasonable  or  about  which  insurance  policy  should  be 
purchased,  either  parent  may  file  a  motion  asking  the  court  to  resolve  the 
dispute. 

Information for Other Parent.  The parent purchasing the insurance must notify 
the insurance company that the other parent can apply for benefits on behalf of 
the  child(ren)  and  should  be  reimbursed  directly.    The  purchaser  must  also 
provide coverage information to the other parent and all forms and instructions 
necessary  to  apply  for  benefits.    The  parent  with  insurance  who  receives 
statements  or  Explanations  of  Benefits  from  the  insurance  company  regarding 
any of the children must send a copy to the other parent upon request. 

Uncovered  Health  Care  Expenses  (including  medical,  dental,  vision,  and  mental 
health counseling expenses).  Civil Rule 90.3(d)(2) and (f)(5). 

The  cost  of  the  child(ren)'s  reasonable health  care  expenses  not  covered  by  insurance 
must be paid as follows, unless the expenses exceed $5,000 in a calendar year: 

 
 

Obligor will pay half and obligee will pay half. 
Obligor will pay  
because  
 

 and obligee will pay  

 
 
 

Parents shall reimburse each other for any share of the uncovered expenses within 30 
days after receiving the health care bill and proof of payment, and if applicable, a health 
insurance  statement  showing  what  part  of  the  cost  is  uncovered.    The  bill  and  other 
materials should be sent within a reasonable time. 

f  the  uncovered  expenses  exceed  $5,000  in  a  calendar  year,  the  expenses  must  be 
allocated  based  on  the  parents'  relative  financial  circumstances  when  the  expenses 
occur.

Travel Expenses.  Civil Rule 90.3(g) 

Travel expenses that are necessary for a parent to spend time with the child(ren) will be 
allocated between the parents as follows:

Income Withholding Order.  Unless one of the following boxes is checked (or CSSD 
later  authorizes  an  exemption  for  one  of  these  reasons),  the  obligor,  any  employer  of 
the  obligor,  and  any  person,  political  subdivision,  department  of  the  State,  or  other 
entity  possessing  property  of  the  obligor  shall  immediately  withhold  from  the  obligor's 
income  and  any  other  money  due  to  the  obligor  the  amount  of  child  support  due 
pursuant  to  AS  25.27.062  and  shall  pay  this  amount  to  the  Child  Support  Services 
Division. 

 

 

 

The  parents  have  agreed  on  the  alternative  arrangement  described  in  the 
attached document signed by both parents.* 

The  court  finds  good  cause  not  to  require  immediate  income  withholding 
because  it  would  not  be in  the  best  interests  of  the  child(ren) for  the  following 
reason(s):* 
 
 

 
 

The  obligor  is  receiving  social  security  or  other  disability  compensation  that 
includes  regular  payments  to  the  child(ren)  at  least  equal  to  the  support  owed 
each month.  To the extent these  payments to the child(ren) do not satisfy the 
monthly  amount  owed,  the  remaining  amount  due  shall  be  withheld  from  the 
obligor's income pursuant to AS 25.27.062. 

Even  if  one  of  the  above  boxes  is  checked,  exempting  the  obligor  from  immediate 
income  withholding,  such  withholding  may  be  initiated  under  AS  25.27.062(c)  through 
the court or through CSSD. 

CSSD  Services.    All  child  support  payments  must  be  made  to  the  Child  Support 
Services  Division  (CSSD)  if  one  of  the  parents  applies  for  the  services  of  CSSD.    In 
addition,  if  the  above  income  withholding  order  is  served  on  the  obligor's  employer  or 
anyone  holding  money  belonging  to  the  obligor,  the  money  withheld  pursuant  to  the 
order must be paid to CSSD. 

When payments are made through CSSD:

d. 

Payments shall include the  case number and names of both parents and shall 
be made payable to the CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES DIVISION, PO Box 100380, 
Anchorage,  Alaska  99510-0380.    CSSD  shall  disburse  the  payments  as  required 
by law after deducting any fee required by law. 

CSSD shall maintain a record of support payments. 

Interest will be imposed in accordance with AS 25.27.020 on payments which are 
10 or more days overdue or if payment is made by a check backed by insufficient 
funds.  No interest will be charged, except on arrearages more than 30 days past 
due, if payments are made under an income withholding order. 

The  parents  shall  notify  CSSD,  in  writing,  of  any  change  in  their  mailing  or 
residence addresses within 5 days after any such change.

In addition, the obligor has agreed to keep the obligee (or  CSSD if CSSD is enforcing the 
order)  informed  of  the  obligor's  current  employer  and  the  availability  of  employment-
related health insurance coverage for the child(ren) until the support order is satisfied.

If a parent applies for CSSD services: 

The  obligor  shall  keep  CSSD  informed  of  the  name  and  address  of  his  or  her 
current employer.  Whenever employment changes, the obligor must notify CSSD 
in  writing  within  20  days.    This  employment  information  must  be  given  to  the 
obligee instead of CSSD if CSSD is not enforcing the order. 

The parent ordered to provide insurance shall provide to CSSD proof of medical 
insurance coverage for the child(ren) within 20 days of this order.  If insurance 
becomes  unavailable,  that  parent  shall  notify  CSSD  within  20  days.    When 
insurance again becomes available, that parent must, within 20 days, give CSSD 
proof that the child(ren) is/are insured.  The above proof and notice of insurance 
must be given to the other parent instead of CSSD if CSSD if not enforcing the 
order.

(3) 

CSSD  shall  take  whatever  Services  action  is  deemed  legally  proper, 
including  recommending  contempt  proceedings  against  the  parent 
ordered  to  pay  support.    Failure  to  pay  support  as  ordered  may 
result  in  execution  against  the  property  of  the  obligor  or  arrest 
of the obligor. 

Either parent may ask CSSD to review the amount of child support.  CSSD 
may  require  that  the  request  be  made  in  writing  on  a  form specified  by 
CSSD.  The parents shall provide income information requested by CSSD 
in connection with a review of the amount of child support within 20 days 
after the date the request is mailed. 

Unless  the  box  below  is  checked,  CSSD  may  issue  a  withholding  order, 
pursuant to AS 25.27.062 or AS 25.27.250, to attach funds owed to the 
obligor  by  any  corporation  created  by  the  Alaska  Native  Claims 
Settlement Act (ANCSA) or any settlement trusts established pursuant to 
section 39 of ANCSA, codified at 43 USC 1629e.  Upon service of such an 
order,  the  obligor's  dividends,  distributions,  and/or  other  periodic 
monetary benefits of ANCSA stock or benefits paid by a settlement trust 
shall be transferred to the child support obligee pursuant to the terms of 
the  withholding  order.    The  ANCSA  corporation  or  settlement  trust  shall 
pay the funds so transferred to CSSD for distribution to the child support 
obligee.  The obligor is prohibited from transferring, selling, or otherwise 
alienating  his/her  ANCSA  stock  or  trust  benefits  after  CSSD  issues  a 
withholding order based on an arrearage. 

  CSSD is not authorized to issue the withholding order described above 
because  
. 
But,  CSSD  may  issue  a  withholding  order  if  obligor  accrues  arrears 
more than two times the monthly support obligation under this order. 

11. 

Effect of Assignment of Right to Child Support to State.  This order does not bind 
the Child Support  Services Division of Alaska or of any other state to the child support 
herein ordered if the person receiving child support is receiving or has currently applied 
for  welfare  benefits  and  assigns  his  or  her  rights  to  child  support  to  the  state.    AS 
25.27.120  -  .130.    If  child  support  rights  are  assigned  to  the  state,  any  alternative 
arrangement for immediate income withholding will not be allowed unless approved by 
CSSD.

Application For Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) Required.  AS 22.10.025(b). 

Unless  the  following  box  is  checked,  the  parent  ordered  to  pay  support  is  ordered  to 
apply for an Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) if (1) an Alaska resident, and (2) at 
any  time  that  parent  is  more  than  two  months  in  arrears  as  of  December  31  of  the 
previous year.  The parent shall submit a complete and accurate PFD application to the 
Permanent  Fund  Dividend  Division  by  January  15  and  shall  timely  submit  any 
supplemental information or documentation requested by the Permanent Fund Dividend 
Division.  If the parent is not eligible for a dividend, the parent must file proof of non-
eligibility with CSSD if CSSD is enforcing this support order. 

 

The  parent  ordered  to  pay  support  is  not  required  to  apply  for  an  Alaska 
 
Permanent Fund Dividend because:

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

You must pay the amount of support stated in this order.  You cannot give gifts, 
clothes, food, or other things instead of paying this money. 

You  must  pay  support  on  time.    You  are  not  excused  from  paying  even  if  the 
other  parent  denies  you  visitation  with  the  child(ren).    If  you  are  denied 
visitation, you can file a motion to enforce visitation with the court, but you must 
still pay the child support. 

You  must  pay  child  support  before  your  other  bills  and  debts.    Child  support 
payments have priority over most other debts. 

If you get married or take on an obligation to support someone else, you will still 
be expected to make all the payments ordered in this order.  If you fail to do so 
and a case is brought against you to enforce payment, your new obligations will 
not excuse your failure to pay. 

14.  Notice to Both Parents: If your situation changes, ask the court to change this 

order right away. 

This child support order is based on: 
 
 

your current income, and  
your current custody and visitation arrangement.  

If  either  changes  significantly  (for  example,  if  a  child  starts  living  with  a  different 
parent), you can ask the court to change the custody order or child support order.  The 
court has forms to help you do this (the DR-700 Packet). 

It  is  very  important  to  ask  the  court  as  soon  as  a  change  occurs  because  child 
support cannot be changed retroactively (that is, a new order cannot cancel the amount 
ordered to be paid in the past). 

Past due amounts continue to remain due even if the person owed support does not ask 
for  payment  (except  in  the  special  situation  described  in  Civil  Rule  90.3(h)(3)).    With 
interest added, these past due amounts can grow into a substantial debt. 

Once a year, either parent can ask the other parent to provide documents such as tax 
returns  and  pay  stubs  showing  the  parent’s  income  for  the  prior  calendar  year.    The 
request must be in writing and the parent making it must attach copies of his or her tax 
return  and  pay  stubs  to  the  request.    The  other  parent  must  respond  with 
documentation of his or her income within 30 days.
