The. . . obligor. . . obligee must purchase health insurance for the child (ren) . because such insurance is available at reasonable . cost through . an. . employer, . union. , . . or otherwise. Name and address of employer/union through which . insurance will be purchased: . . . . . The insurance cost (currently $. . . . per month) will be divided . between the par. ent. s equally unless a different division of the cost is ordered. . . . The child support calculation in paragraph 3 includes: . . . a credit of $. . . per month (50% of the cost to the obligor) f. or . health insurance purchased for the child (ren) by the obligor.

Health insurance for the child (ren) is not now available at reasonable cost or its . availability is unknow. n. . . b. . . Future Coverage. . If there is no health care coverage for the child (ren) and . insurance becomes available to a parent at a reasonable cost, that parent must . purchase the insurance after giving notice to the other parent. The cost of the . insurance must. . be divided between the parents equally unless a different division . of the cost is ordered. Without further order of the court, the monthly child . support obligation will increase by 50% of the cost of the insurance if the obligee . purchases it and decrease. . by 50% of the cost of the insurance if the obligor . purchases it, unless otherwise ordered. If the parents disagree about whether . the cost of insurance is reasonable or about which insurance policy should be . purchased, either parent may file a motion aski. ng the court to resolve the . dispute. . . . c. . . Information for Other Parent. . . The parent purchasing the insurance must notify . the insurance company that the other parent can apply for benefits on behalf of . the child (ren) and should be reimbursed directly. The p. urchaser must also . provide coverage information to the other parent and all forms and instructions . necessary to apply for benefits. . . The parent with insurance who receives . statements or Explanations of Benefits from the insurance company regarding . any of t. he children must send a copy to the other parent upon request. . . 7. . . .

(. ren. ) . 's reasonable health. . care expenses not covered by insurance . must be paid as follows, unless the expenses exceed $5, 000 in a calendar year: . . . Obligor will pay half and obligee will pay half. . . . Obligor will pay . . . and obligee will pay . . . because . . . . . Par. ent. s. . shall reimburse . each . other . for . any. . share of the uncovered expenses within 30 . days after receiving the health care bill. . and. . proof of payment. , . . and. . if applicable, a health . insurance statement showing what part of the cost is uncovered. The bill and other . materials should be sent within a reasonable time. . . . If the uncovered expenses exceed $5, 000 in a calendar year, the expenses must be . allocated base. d on the par. ent. s' relative financial circumstances when the expenses . occur. . . 8. . . .

Services. . Division. . . . The par. ent. s have. . agreed on the alternative arrangement described in the . attached document signed by both par. ent. s. *. . . The court finds good cause not to require immediate income withholding . becaus. e it would not be in the best interests of the child (ren) for the following . reason. (s) . : . *. . . . . . . . The obligor is receiving social security or other disability compensation that . includes regular payments to the child (ren) at least equal to the support owed . each month. To the extent these . payments to the child (ren) do not satisfy the . monthly amount owed, the remaining amount due shall be withheld from the . obligor's income pursuant to AS 25. 27. 062. . . . Even if one of the above boxes is checked, exempting the obligor from immediate . income withho. lding, such withholding may be initiated under AS 25. 27. 062 (c) through . the court or through .

Failure to pay support as ordered may . result in execution against the property of the obligor or arrest . of the obligor. . . (2) . . Either . par. ent. . may ask .

Upon service of such an . order, the obligor's dividends, distributions. , . . and/or other periodic . monetary benefits of ANCSA stock or benefits paid by a settlement trust . shall be transferred to the child support obligee pursuant to the terms of . the withholding order. The ANCSA corporation or settlement trust shall . pay the funds . so transferred to CSSD for distribution to the child support . obligee. The obligor is prohibited from transferring, selling. , . . or otherwise . alienating his/her ANCSA stock or trust benefits after CSSD issues a . withholding order based on an arrearage. . . .

Unless the follow. ing box is checked, the par. ent. . ordered to pay support is ordered to . apply for an Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) . if. . (1) . an Alaska resident. , . . and . (2) at . any time that par. ent. . is . more than two months in arrears as of . December 31 of the . previous year. The par. ent. . shall submit a complete and accurate PFD application to the .

If the par. ent. . is not eligible for a dividend, the par. ent. . must file proof of non. -. eligibility with CSSD if CSSD is enforcing this support order. . . . The par. ent. . ordered to pay support is not required to apply for an Alaska . Permanent Fund Dividend because: . . . 1. 3. . . . Notice to Par. ent. . Ordered to Pay Support (Obligor) . . . a. . . You must pay the amount . of support stated in this order. You cannot give gifts, . clothes, food, or other things instead of paying this money. . . b. . . You must pay support on time. You are not excused from paying even if the . other par. ent. . denies you visitation with the child (ren) . I. f you are denied . visitation, you can file a motion to enforce visitation with the court, but you must . still pay the child support. . . c. . . You must pay child support before your other bills and debts. Child support . payments have priority over most other debts. . . d. . . If you get married or take on an obligation to support someone else, you will still . be expected to make all the payments ordered in this order. If you fail to do so . and a case is brought against you to enforce payment, your new obligations will . not . excuse your failure to pay. . . 1. 4. . . . Notice to Both Par. ent. s: If your situation changes, ask the court t. o change this . order right away. . . This child support order is based on: . . . . your current income, and . . . . your current custody and visitation arrangement. . . If . either changes significantly (for example, if a child starts living with a different . parent) , you can ask the court to change the custody order or child support order. The . court has forms to help you do this (the DR. -. 700 Packet) . . . It is very important to a. sk the court . as soon as a change occurs. . because child . support cannot be changed retroactively (that is, a new order cannot cancel the amount . or. dered to be paid in the past) . . . Past due amounts continue to remain due even if the person owed support does not . ask . for payment (except in the special situation described in Civil Rule 90. 3 (h) (3) ) . With . interest added, these past due amounts can grow into a substantial debt. . . Once a year, either par. ent. . can ask the other par. ent. . to provide documents such as tax . r. eturns and pay stubs showing the par. ent. . request must be in writing and the par. ent. . making it must attach copies of his or her tax . return and pay stubs to the request. The other par. ent. . must respond with . documentation of his or her income within 30 days. . . . Page . 8. . of . 8. . AS 18. 66. 100 (c) (12) . . DV. -. 200 (. 8. /. 21. ) (cs) . .

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. New names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them.
