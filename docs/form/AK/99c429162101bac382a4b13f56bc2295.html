      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR GETTING PAYMENT FROM THE OTHER PARENT 
FOR A CHILD’S HEALTH CARE EXPENSES 
 
If you have paid for a child’s health care expenses and the other parent has not paid his or her 
share, these instructions explain what to do. 

tep 1.  Find Your Child Support Order 

Read  the  section  of  your  child  support  order  that  explains  how  the  parents  must 
divide the cost of the children’s health care expenses that are not paid by insurance. 
In  current  Alaska  orders  (form  DR-300),  this  is  paragraph  10,  “Uncovered  Health 
Care Expenses.” 

This paragraph will tell you what percent each parent must pay if insurance does not 
pay a child’s health care bill.  You need to know this in order to tell the other parent 
how much he or she owes you. (See step 2 below.) 

If  your  child  support  order  does  not  include  such  a  section,  you  need  to  ask  the 
court  for  an  order.    You  can  use  the  “Motion”  form  in  this  packet  (form  DR-352) 
described in Step 4.a below. (When you fill out the Motion form, check the second 
box in paragraph 2.) 

tep 2.  Tell the Other Parent What Is Owed 

Within  a  reasonable  time  after  you  pay  the  bill,  you  must  notify  the  other  parent 
about  the  expense.  Your  letter  or  e-mail  should  explain  what  the  expense  was  for 
and  how  much  the  other  parent  owes  you.    You  must  attach  the  following 
documents to your request for payment (if you have them): 

a. 

the bill from the service provider, 

proof of any amount you paid (such as the doctor’s bill showing what was paid 
or a copy of your check or credit card receipt), and 

if  the  service is  partly  covered  by insurance,  an  insurance  statement  showing 
the amount the insurance company paid and the amount (if any) still owed to 
the  service  provider.    This  statement  is  usually  called  an  “Explanation  of 
Benefits” (EOB).  

If  you  did  not  receive  the  EOB  from  the  insurance  company  because  you  do 
not own the policy and the other parent owns the policy, ask the other parent 
for a copy of the EOB. 

b. 

c. 

 

 

Keep a copy of your letter and all attachments.

Step 3.  Wait 30 Days 
 

 

 
Step 4. 
 

Generally, the other parent is required to pay you the amount owed within 30 days 
after receiving the paperwork described in Step 2.1  

If the other parent disagrees about the amount owed, he or she should contact you 
to explain the disagreement. 

If No Payment, Fill Out Forms 

If the other parent does not pay his or her share within 30 days after receiving your 
letter,  you  may  ask  the  court  to  order  the  parent  to  make  the  payment.    You  can 
wait  until  you  have  several  unpaid  bills  before  filing,  but  file  within  a  reasonable 
time. Fill out the forms listed below and attach the required documents. 

Fill in the top of the front page of each form the same way your child support order 
is filled in (the same court location, case number and parties’ names).  You can also 
fill out the forms online on the court website, although you will have to print them 
out to file them. 

a.  Motion & Affidavit Requesting Payment for Children’s Health Care 

Expenses  (form DR-352)   

 

 

 

 

This  motion  asks  a  judge  to  order  the  other  parent  to  pay  the  amount  you 
believe you are owed. You must attach several documents to the Motion.  Be 
sure to check the box in paragraph 7 next to each item you attach. 

You must sign the motion in front of a notary public.  A court clerk can provide 
this  notary  service  for  you  (at  no  charge)  when  you  bring  the  documents  to 
court.  You must bring a photo ID with you for the notarization. 

Be sure to fill out the "Certificate of Service" on page 3 of the form, describing 
how you will give a copy of everything to the other parent. (See Step 5 on the 
next page about sending copies to the other parent.) 

b.  Statement of Health Care Expenses  (form  DR-353).   See  the instructions 

on the form, including the list of documents you must attach. 

One  of  the  documents  you  must  attach  is  a  copy  of  each  Explanation  of 
Benefits statement (EOB) from an insurance company.  If you did not receive 
an  EOB  from  the  insurance  company  (because  you  are  not  the  owner  of  the 
policy), ask the parent who owns the policy for a copy of the EOB. If you are 
not able  to  attach a  copy  of the  EOB, you must  explain  why  in  the space  for 
this in paragraph 7 of the DR-352 motion form.

c.  Notice of Motion Requesting Payment for Children’s Health Care 

Expenses (form DR-354) 

d.  Order for Reimbursement of Health Care Expenses (form DR-355)  

Prepare this proposed order for the judge’s signature. In the first paragraph, fill 
in the date you plan to file your motion with the court.   

In  paragraph  #1,  fill  in  the  other  parent’s  name,  your  name  and  the  amount 
you believe you are owed (the total amount in column “h” on the Statement of 
Health Care Expenses).  Do not fill in the last line (the deadline for making the 
payment). 

Paragraph  #3  allows  the  court  to  order  the  parent  who  has  the  insurance 
policy to sign a release form allowing the insurance company to give copies of 
EOBs (Explanations of Benefits) concerning the children to the other parent.  If 
you want this, fill in the name of the parent who has the insurance on the first 
line and the name of the other parent on the second blank line. 

 

 

 

Step 5.   Send Copy of Motion and Other Documents to Other Parent 
 

Mail the following documents to the other parent by first class mail (or hand-deliver 
them): 

a. 

A  copy  of  each  of  the  documents  listed  in  Step  4  (the  motion  with  its 
attachments, the statement of expenses with all its attachments, the notice of 
motion and the proposed order).  Put the Notice of Motion on top. 

b.  A blank Response Packet (DR-356).   

Step 6.   Send Copy of Motion and Other Documents to Other Parent’s Attorney – If 

Previously Represented. 

If the other parent was represented by an attorney within the last year, also send to 
that attorney a copy of everything listed in Step 5 except the Response Packet. 
You can find the attorney’s name and address in the court case file.  

tep 7.  Keep a Copy. 

Keep a copy of all documents and attachments for yourself. 

tep 8.  File Motion With the Court  

Mail  or  hand-deliver  the  originals  of  all  the  documents  to  the  court  that  entered 
your child support order.  (See page 4 of the instructions in the Response Packet for 
a list of court mailing addresses.)

holidays) 

If  delivered  by  first  class  mail:    13  days  from  the  date  of  mailing  (counting  weekends 
and holidays) 
 

The other parent must send you a copy of any response he or she sends to the court. 

f you  receive  a  response, you can  file  a  "reply."   The time  limit  for  filing  a reply  depends on 
how the response was delivered to you.3 

If  delivered  in  person:    5  days  from  the  date  of  delivery  (not  counting  weekends  or 
holidays) 
If delivered by first class mail:  8 days from the  date it was postmarked (not counting 
weekends or holidays)

our Reply must be signed in front of a notary (available at the court at no charge).   

ile the original of your reply (including the certificate of service on page 2) with the court.

EARING  

he judge may order a hearing if one is needed to decide any disputes about the evidence in 
your  case.    You  will  be  notified  if  a  hearing  is  scheduled.    If  you  are  not  able  to  attend  the 
hearing  in  person,  contact  the  court  to  ask  if  you  can  participate  by  telephone.  You  can  use 
form SC-31 (available on the court’s website) to ask to participate by telephone. 

t the hearing, you will have the burden of proving the reasons to grant the motion.  You must 
present  evidence,  which may  include  your  own  testimony or  other  witnesses'  testimony.   The 
other parent may present similar evidence (testimony) in opposition.

JUDGE’S ORDER 

If the judge signs an order requiring the other parent to pay you money, the court will send a 
copy of the order to both you and the other parent. 

IF THE OTHER PARENT DOES NOT OBEY THE ORDER TO PAY 

If the other parent does not pay the amount ordered by the deadline stated in the order, you 
can either: 

1.

Ask  the  Child  Support  Services  Division  (CSSD)  to  collect  the  amount  due  for  you.
CSSD is not part of the court system.  You can contact CSSD as follows:

Mail:  

550 West 7th Ave., Suite 310, Anchorage AK 99501-6699

Telephone:  (907) 269-6900 (in Anchorage) or (800) 478-3300 (toll free in Alaska). For

TTY help, call (907) 269-6894 or (800) 370-6894 (toll free in Alaska). 

Website:    http://childsupport.alaska.gov 

Offices:  

CSSD has offices in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau and Wasilla. 

Or 

2.

File  a  motion  asking  the  court  for  a  judgment  against  the  other  parent.    If  the  court
grants  your  request  and  signs  a  judgment,  you  can  get  a Writ of Execution  from  the
court and use that writ to seize the other parent’s assets to collect the debt.

If you need help preparing and filing this motion, contact the court system’s Family Law
Self-Help Center:

Telephone Helpline Hours: Monday – Thursday, 7:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
Anchorage Phone No.:  264-0851
Outside-Anchorage Phone No. (Toll Free in Alaska):  (866) 279-0851

Collecting the Money Ordered in the Judgment.  After you get your judgment, you can
go  to  the  court  clerk’s  office  and  request  a Writ of Execution  to  help  you  collect  the
money.  In order to decide which type of writ you need, the court will ask you what you
plan  to  seize  from  the  debtor  (the  other  parent).    For  example,  do  you  want  to  seize
his/her Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend or bank account or wages?  For an explanation
of this and what you will need to do next, see the CIV-550 Judgment Creditor Booklet,
available at the court and on the court system’s website.
