Chapter I 
 
INTRODUCTION TO SMALL CLAIMS 

A small claims case is a simplified type of court case  for a person to try to recover money or 
personal property worth $10,000 or less.  If your claim is over $10,000, you can still use small 
claims  court,  but  you  must  give  up  the  right  to  collect  any  amount  over  $10,000.    You  may, 
however,  recover  interest  on  any  money  you  are  awarded  and  court  costs  over  the  $10,000 
maximum. 

The person who starts the case by suing someone is called the “plaintiff.”  The person who is 
sued is called the “defendant.”  The plaintiffs and defendants are called “parties” in the case. 

You do not need a lawyer in a small claims case, although you may have one if you wish.  Small 
claims court can only be used if all parties agree to use this simplified procedure. 

Small claims procedure cannot be used for: 
•  disagreements about title to real property (land or buildings) 
•  actions to recover possession of real property (land or buildings) 
•  evictions 
•  claims against the State of Alaska or the United States government 
• 
•  actions to foreclose or enforce statutory, common law, or possessory liens 

injunctive relief (a court order requiring a person to do or not to do a specified act) 

This handbook explains small claims procedure. It is based primarily on the District Court rules 
established by the Alaska Supreme Court.  A copy of these rules is included in Appendix A. 

.  THE CHOICE:  SMALL CLAIMS PROCEDURE OR FORMAL PROCEDURE. 

 

 

 B

 

There are two different court processes to sue in district court: 
(1) Small Claims: an informal process for claims up to $10,000.  See the flowchart on page 5. 
(2) Formal Rules Case: may be used for claims up to $100,000, including claims for less than 

$10,000 if one of the parties so chooses.1   
See flowchart at: http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/debt/docs/debt-flowchart.pdf. 

For a comparison of these differences and others described below, see the table on page 4. 

Formality of Procedure:  In small claims court, pleadings and other documents you file with the 
court are brief and do not need to follow all the conventions required under formal rules.  The 
court  also  provides  forms  for  small  claims  court,  rather  than  you  having  to  create  your  own 
pleadings from scratch.   

In a small claims trial, the judge can generally consider anything (with a few small exceptions) 
that relates to the facts and will help the judge decide the case.  In a formal trial, the judge will 
apply the Alaska Rules of Evidence to decide what can be considered as evidence.  If one side 
doesn’t follow the Rules of Evidence, the other side can object to it.  If the judge agrees with the 
objection, the judge or jury can’t use that evidence to help make a decision.   

There are also stricter rules about questioning witnesses in a formal trial, and the judge usually 
will not ask any questions.  In a small claims trial, there are no rules about the format of your 
questions and the judge often takes a more active role in asking questions.  

In a small claims case, the judge is allowed to investigate the claim on the judge’s own initiative, 
in court or outside of it, as long as all the parties are present during the investigation.  In a formal 
case, the judge is only allowed to consider evidence that the parties themselves bring to court.

  Attorney Fees: If you win your case, the court can order the other party to reimburse you some 
of your attorney fees if you had an attorney representing you.  In small claims court, the most 
you can get for attorney’s fees is $1000.2  In formal civil cases, you can usually get between 3-
30% of your actual, reasonable attorney fees, although there is no maximum.3  Keep in mind that 
in both types of procedure, if you lose your case, you would likely have to pay this same portion 
of the attorney fees to the other party if the other party is represented by a lawyer. 
 
Jury Trial and Judge: In a formal case, you have the right to “pre-empt” the assigned judge, as 
long  as  you  follow  the  correct  procedure  to  do  so.    To  pre-empt  a  judge  means  that  you  can 
demand a different judge (one time only) without giving a reason.  In a small claims case, you do 
not have the right to pre-empt the assigned judge or magistrate judge. 

 
 

In a small claims case, your trial will be heard and decided by a judge or magistrate judge.  You 
do not have a right to a jury trial in small claims cases.  In a formal trial, you can demand a jury 
trial if you follow the correct procedure to request one.  A jury trial can greatly increase the legal 
fees and costs in a case. 
 

 

 

C.  WHO CAN FILE A SMALL CLAIMS CASE. 
 

Anyone 18 years of age or older may file.4  A person under age 18 is allowed to file only with 
the assistance of a parent or guardian.  Partnerships, unincorporated associations, limited liability 
companies, and corporations may also file small claims cases.   

.  WHO CAN BE SUED IN A SMALL CLAIMS CASE. 

You can sue: 
•  Persons 18 years of age or older. 
•  Persons under 18, through their parent or guardian. 
•  Partnerships,  unincorporated  associations,  limited  liability  companies,  and  corporations 

•  A landlord residing outside Alaska (see AS 34.03.340). 
•  A nonresident owner or operator of a motor vehicle involved in an accident in Alaska (see 

doing business in Alaska. 

AS 09.05.020). 

If a person is outside Alaska, the person usually cannot be sued in small claims court unless a 
district court judge, rather than a magistrate judge, hears the case.  This is because a magistrate 
judge may not hear a small claims case if the documents opening the case are delivered to the 
defendant outside the state, except in the last two situations in the bullet points listed above.5 

.  HOW TO START A SMALL CLAIMS CASE. 

Procedures for the plaintiff are in Chapter II. 

.  HOW TO RESPOND TO A SMALL CLAIMS COMPLAINT. 

Procedures for the defendant are in Chapter III. 

.  FORMS. 

Small claims forms are available at: http://www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#sc or in 
paper copy from your local court clerk. 

 

 
2   District Court Civil Rule 20(c).  The maximum may be less if you win a default judgment. 
3   Civil Rule 82. 
4   District Court Civil Rule 14 and AS 25.20.010.  This age limitation does not apply to children who have gone through 
court emancipation proceedings  under AS 09.55.590 or who are considered to have reached the age of  majority 
under AS 25.20.020.

Most people who file or defend small claims cases do not use lawyers.  Small claims procedures 
are designed to be used without a lawyer, but you can be represented by a lawyer if you wish. 

Sometimes it is difficult to decide whether you should hire a lawyer.  Some cases involving only 
small amounts of money or property can be complicated.  If you are unsure about whether you 
should hire a lawyer, it is a good idea to talk to one about your case before you decide whether 
you can handle it alone.  You can get information about finding a lawyer on the court’s website: 
http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/shclawyer.htm.  You can also call or write:

https://alaskabar.org/for-lawyers/lawyer-referral-service/ 

If any party in a small claims case requests formal rules, you may want to talk to a lawyer. 

.  A SPECIAL SITUATION WHEN LAWYERS ARE NECESSARY. 

The small claims rules require that the plaintiff be represented by a lawyer in a case to collect an 
“assigned claim.”6  An assigned claim is when a person with the right to collect the claim has 
assigned (given or sold) this right to another person or to a collection agency.  The defendant is 
not required to have a lawyer in this type of case. 

If you are suing a person under age 18, a mentally incompetent person, or a person in the active 
military service, it is a good idea (though not required) to talk to a lawyer.  There are special laws 
protecting these persons from  default judgment, and it may be harder to  represent  yourself in 
these types of cases. 

J.  CAN SOMEONE OTHER THAN A LAWYER REPRESENT YOU IN A SMALL CLAIMS CASE? 

  No.  Only  lawyers  (and  some  legal  interns)  may  represent  other  people  in  court.    The  one 

exception is that a person under age 18 may be represented by a parent or guardian.  

owers of attorney cannot be used to authorize someone to represent you in small claims court.  
A power of attorney may authorize you to start a small claims case on behalf of another person, 
but you must hire a lawyer to represent the other person in the case.7

It is usually a good idea to ask the defendant for what you want before you sue.  It helps if your 
request  is  in  writing.8   Your problem  may  be solved if the defendant  decides to  give  you the 
money you are owed or return the personal property rather than face a lawsuit.  

t is not expensive to file a small claims action.  However, if you lose, you will lose the filing fee 
and any other court costs, and you may also have to pay the defendant's court costs.  Lawsuits 
should not be used merely to harass people.  

f you believe you have a good claim and can prove your case, you may file a case.  Ask yourself 
whether you can show or tell the judge facts (called “evidence” in court) that will prove your 
case.  Evidence can be your own testimony, the testimony of other people, documents, pictures, 
and even the testimony of the defendant (you can ask the defendant questions during trial, and 
the defendant must answer them under oath). 

e aware that the court will not actually give you your money if you win.  All the court will give 
you is a judgment saying that you are entitled to collect the money from the defendant.  If the 
defendant  does  not  pay  voluntarily,  you  must  use  another  court  procedure  called  “execution 
procedure” to try to enforce the judgment.  Execution procedure will only be successful if the 
defendant has money or property that can be seized to pay the judgment.  For more information, 
see  https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/debt/collection.htm  or  ask  the  court  clerk  for  a  copy  of 
Execution Procedure: Judgment Creditor Booklet (form CIV-550).

.  If the defendant caused you personal injury or damaged your property, you can file in 

the district court nearest to where the injury or damage occurred. 

.  If you are suing a business, you can file in any district court where it does or solicits 

business (for example, where it has a store or an office or sends salespeople).

1.  The district court nearest where the defendant lives or works. 

You  must  file  your  case  "at  a  place  which  will  not  cause  unnecessary  expense  or 
inconvenience to the defendant."9  You must choose at least one of these options: 

 

2.  How to File. 

STEP  ONE:  Get

these 
http://www.courts.alaska.gov/ forms/index.htm#sc: 

forms 

local  court  clerk  or  online  at 

1.  COMPLAINT (form SC-1) 
2.  SUMMONS (form SC-2) 
3.  ANSWER (form SC-3) 

STEP TWO: Fill out these three forms as explained in section C on the next page.   

STEP THREE: File the Complaint and Summons with the court (you do not need to file the 
Answer).  Pay the filing fee according to Administrative Rule 9.  If you cannot afford the 
filing fee, you may request a waiver of the fee by filling out a Request for Exemption from 
Payment of Fees (form TF-920), available online or from your local court clerk.

In some cases, the law requires you to make a written request.  For example, the statute that creates civil penalties 
for issuing bad checks requires the plaintiff to make a written demand (as defined in the statute) for payment at 
least 15 days before filing suit.  AS 09.68.115.

STEP FOUR: After the court clerk has finished filling out the forms with the case information 
and  signed  the  summons,  you  must  serve  all  three  forms—the  Complaint,  Summons,  and 
Answer—on the defendant.  Section D of this chapter explains service.  

C.  HOW TO FILL OUT THE FORMS. 

1.  Complaint 

See the sample Complaint (form SC-1) on the next page.  Please type or print when filling 
out the form.  Use black ink. 

a  Write the name of the city where the court is located. 

b  Write your name.  See NOTE ABOUT NAMES below. 

c  Write defendant's name.  See NOTE ABOUT NAMES below. 

NOTE ABOUT NAMES:  It is very important to name the plaintiff and defendant correctly.  
If you list the defendant's name incorrectly, you may not be able to collect any money even 
if you win your case. 

To decide how to list the defendant's name, first decide who owes you money or is responsible 
for the injury to you.  It may be an individual person, or several persons, or a business, or 
both a business and one or more individuals. 

If you decide to sue more than one defendant, you must name each defendant separately.  For 
example, if you intend to sue both John Smith individually and XYZ corporation, you must 
list both as defendants. 

Example: JOHN R. SMITH, individually; and XYZ, INC., an Alaska corporation 

If you decide to sue a business, you must find out whether the business is a corporation, a 
partnership, or another form of business.  You need to know this in order to name the business 
correctly on the complaint. 

 

1)  PERSONS 

You must list a first and last name for each party.  Include middle names or initials if 
known.  Spelling must be accurate. 

NOTE: If you want to sue a husband and wife, name each one separately.  Do not name 
them "Mr. and Mrs.....” 

Example:  JEFFREY T. WILSON and MARY J. WILSON  

2)  CHILDREN 

If the plaintiff or defendant is under age 18, both the minor and a parent or guardian must 
be  named  on  the  complaint.10    Minors  must  appear  through  their  parents  or  other 
guardians.11 
Example:  TOM SMITH, a minor, through his parent, JOHN R. SMITH 
NOTE:  If  you  are  suing  both  a  minor  and  the  minor's  parent,  you  must  name  them 
separately: 
Example:   TOM SMITH, a minor, through his parent, JOHN R. SMITH; and  

JOHN R. SMITH, individually 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 
 

  

 

 

 

 
 

  

 

  

  

 

 
 

   

10   This does not apply to children who have gone through court emancipation proceedings under AS 09.55.590 or 

 

 

 

 

who are considered to have reached the age of majority under AS 25.20.020.

f  Write the full amount you believe the defendant owes you and the reason why, even if 
it is over $10,000.  You will have to give up your claim to any amount over $10,000, 
but it is important to state the full amount on this line so the judge will understand your 
claim.  

If  you  are  asking  for  a  penalty  listed  in  an  Alaska  statute  (for  example,  bad  check 
penalties  under  AS  09.68.115,  or  penalties  for  failure  to  refund  a  tenant's  security 
deposit under AS 34.03.070(d)), you must write that in your complaint. 

If you are asking for the return of personal property, write on the dollar amount line the 
approximate  value  of  the  property.    The  court  needs  to  know  this  so  it  can  decide 
jurisdiction (authority) to hear the case.  If you want the property back (instead of money 
for the value of the property), be sure to state this clearly.  Be aware, however, that if 
the property is gone and cannot be recovered, the only thing the court will be able to 
give you is a judgment for money. 

If you are afraid the defendant will get rid of, sell, or misplace the item you want back—
and it is very important to you that you get that exact item—it is a good idea to talk to 
a lawyer.  In a formal civil trial, the judge could enter an order to protect the property 
early in the case; this is not possible in a small claims case.12   

Check the appropriate box. 

Read the first sentence in this paragraph to be sure you agree with it. 

Read the second sentence and then check one or more of the boxes.  You must be able 
to check at least one of these boxes.  In this section, you are affirming that you have 
complied with the rule described in section B on page 6 about where small claims cases 
can be filed. 

Fill in all the contact information in this section.  If you would like to get all your court 
documents sent to you by email instead of regular mail, check the box at the bottom 
next to the asterisk.  Print or type everything except your signature.  Be sure to include

Attach to the complaint any documents that support your claim (for example: cancelled 
checks, bills, promissory notes, credit card agreement, etc.).  You will need: 

1)  the original (or a copy) for the court and 
2)  a copy for each defendant and 
3)  a copy for your own records (if you are sending the originals to the court) 

If you do not want to file your originals, you can attach copies.  However, in some cases 
you will have to give the court the original document before the court can give you a 
judgment (for example: promissory notes, NSF checks, etc.)  If you don’t attach these 
documents now, your case may be delayed.

SUMMONS 

 
 
 

 

The plaintiff has filed a small claims action against you.  You are required to answer the 
Complaint attached to this Summons.  If you do not answer the Complaint, the court may enter 
a judgment against you for the amount claimed plus interest and court costs.  This is a civil 
case.  You are not accused of a crime.  If you lose this case, the plaintiff can ask that the court 
take some of your wages, money, or property to pay the judgment. 

This case has been filed under the rules of small claims procedure.  You may choose to continue 
to  use small  claims  rules (Part  II  of the District  Court Rules of Civil  Procedure)  or  you may 
choose to use the formal civil rules (Part I of the District Court Rules of Civil Procedure).   

For more information, read Alaska Small Claims Handbook (form SC-100). It is available:  
•  online at https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/sc-100.pdf

Once you file the forms with the court and pay the filing fee to start your case, the court 
clerk will complete the rest of each summons and assign a case number.  Write this case 
number on line  d  of the complaint, each summons, and the answer if the court clerk did 
not already do so.   

HOW TO GIVE NOTICE TO A SMALL CLAIMS DEFENDANT. 

1.  The following must be given to (“served” on) each defendant to notify them about the case: 

a.  the summons addressed to that defendant 
b.  a copy of the completed complaint  
c.  a copy of any supporting documents filed with the complaint 
d.  an answer form with the top filled out as described above 

Your case will not proceed any further in court until you serve all of the defendants.  There 
are two steps you must complete to move your case forward: 

STEP ONE: Serve the documents listed above to each defendant.  “Service” is a legal 
term  for  giving  them  the  documents  in  a  specific  way.    Section  2  on  the  next  page 
describes how to serve the defendant(s). 

STEP TWO: File proof with the court that you served the documents.  Section 3 on the 
next page describes how to file proof of service. 

You  have  120  days  from  the  date  you  file  your  small  claims  case  in  court  to  serve  the 
defendant(s).   If  you do  not  complete the steps  above within  120 days,  your case  may be 
dismissed.13 

n cases being heard by a magistrate judge, defendants can only be served if they are within 
the State of Alaska.  The only exceptions to this rule are: (1) out-of-state landlords may be 
served outside Alaska under the Landlord-Tenant Act (AS 34.03.340), and (2) an out-of-state 
person who owns or operates a motor vehicle involved in an accident in Alaska may be served 
as described in AS 09.05.020.  In cases being heard by a district court judge, any small claims 
defendant may be served out-of-state.

2.  There are two main methods of service: certified mail and process server.  This handbook 
describes the basics of each.  You can find more detail on each of these methods in How to 
Serve a Summons (form CIV-106), available online or as a booklet at your local court.  There 
may be special rules that apply to service on the following types of defendants: 

•  minors  
•  mentally incompetent persons  
•  persons in jail 
•  persons in the military 
•  a deceased person’s estate 
•  businesses, partnerships, associations, or corporations  
•  defendants being served outside Alaska 

It is a good idea to read the How to Serve a Summons booklet if you are trying to serve one 
of these types of defendants.  You need to make sure that you are not overlooking any extra 
steps and that you are serving all of the correct representatives. 

Certified  Mail: This is  the less expensive option to  serve the required documents to  start 
your  case.    Your  local  post  office  should  be  able  to  direct  you  to  the  proper  forms  and 
envelopes.  Service by certified mail must be restricted delivery to the “Addressee Only” and 
“Return Receipt Requested.”   Make sure  you pay for these specific items so that only the 
defendant signs for the mail and you get the green card sent back to you when the defendant 
gets the documents.   

Important: Save the green card when you receive it back from the defendant.

Process Server: Hiring a process server is more expensive than certified mail, but sometimes 
is a better option if the defendant  refuses to sign for the certified mail.  Choose a process 
server 
here: 
https://courts.alaska.gov/trialcourts/docs/process-servers.pdf.    You  can  also  find  a  list  of 
licensed process servers on the Department of Public Safety (Alaska State Troopers) website: 
https://dps.alaska.gov/Statewide/R-I/PermitsLicensing/Home  (click  on  “Civilian  Process 
Server List”).  If there are no private process servers in your area, peace officers (usually state 
troopers) will serve process.  It is up to you to choose a process server and arrange to pay for 
their services.14  Fill out the Service Instructions (form CIV 615) and give it to the process 
server along with the documents to be served.  After the process server completes service, 
they will send or give you a proof of service document.

list, 

Important: Save the Proof of Service when you get it from the process server. 
3.  Once service is done, you must file an Affidavit of Service (form SC-4) with the court, 

describing what you did.  You can use one SC-4 form for multiple defendants.  Attach proof 
of service, such as certified mail receipts (green card) and documents you got back from the 
process server.  Make a copy of this form and all attachments for your records, then file the 
original with the court. 

.  WHAT TO DO IF YOU CAN’T SERVE THE DEFENDANT. 

Sometimes, you may believe that the defendant is avoiding service, such as refusing to sign for 
the  certified  mail  or  hiding  from  the  process  server.    Or  perhaps  you  do  not  know  where  the 
defendant lives or can be found, even after doing research.  In these cases, you may ask the court 
for  permission  to  do  an  alternate  service  method,  such  as  by  posting  on  the  court  website  or 
sending electronic documents to the defendant through social media.  There are many extra steps 
involved before a judge is likely to allow you to do alternate service, and this handbook does not 
cover them.  Good starting places for more detailed information are Civil Rule 4(e) and How to 
Serve a Summons (form CIV-106), available online or from the court clerk.

14   Fees are set by the individual process server.  However, the maximum amount you may recover as costs from the 
defendant (if you win your case) is set by Administrative Rule 11.  The current amount recoverable is $45.00 for 
each person on whom service is made.  Additional amounts may be recovered for extra mileage or extra time spent 
serving the documents.

Once  the  defendant  is  served,  you  must  wait  at  least  20  days  to  see  if  the  defendant  files  an 
answer. 
1.  No Answer. 

If the defendant does not file an answer within 20 days (40 days if the defendant was served 
outside the United States) after the date of service, you may ask the court to enter a default 
judgment in your favor.  Fill out the Default Affidavit and Request for Judgment (form SC-
8).  File it with the court and mail it to the defendant (regular mail to the address where the 
summons was served is acceptable—you do not need to use certified mail or a process server).  
The court may still allow the defendant to file an answer after the deadline has passed if the 
court has not yet entered the default judgment.  The court must wait at least seven days after 
you make the default request before entering a default judgment.15 

You  may  also  have  to  give  the  court  more  information.    For  example,  if  the  documents 
attached to your complaint do not fully prove the dollar amount of your claim, the court may 
have to hold a hearing to establish the amount of money you are owed.  Also, if your case is 
to collect a promissory note, NSF check, or other negotiable instrument, you must give the 
court the original note or check or other document if you have not already done so.  The rules 
require the court to cancel such instruments before judgment may be entered. 

f the defendant is under age 18, in the active military service, or mentally incompetent, you 
may not be able to get a default judgment, because there are special laws protecting these 
persons.  These laws may require appointing a lawyer or guardian for the defendant at your 
expense or may prevent you from getting a default.  

2.  Answer on Form SC-3. 

By filing the answer on form SC-3, the defendant has agreed to use small claims rules. 

a.  If the defendant agrees about owing you the money, the court will enter a judgment in 
your favor.  If you are suing to collect a negotiable instrument, you must give the original 
to the court before the court will give you your judgment. 

.  If the defendant denies owing you the money and/or states a counterclaim, the court will 
schedule a trial and notify you and the defendant in writing of the place, date, and time of 
the trial. 

.  Counterclaim (see section 3 of form SC-3).  If the defendant states a counterclaim against 
you, the judge will listen to and decide both the counterclaim and your original claim at 
the  trial.    If  the  defendant's  counterclaim  is  for  more  than  $10,000,  the  defendant  has 
waived (given up) the claim to any amount over $10,000 to keep the case in small claims 
court.   

 I

 b

 c

 

If you want to stay in small claims court, you do not have to file a reply. The counterclaim 
is automatically denied by you, and the court will schedule a trial date.16   

f you decide that you do not want to keep the case in small claims court after seeing the 
counterclaim, you can request formal rules instead of the small claims rules.  The deadline 
to do this is 13 days from the date the defendant mailed the answer to you, or 10 days 
from the date you actually received it by hand-delivery, fax, or email.  The court does not 
have any forms for this request.17 If you request formal procedures, all prior waivers of 
jury trial, formal procedure, and amounts in excess of $10,000 will no longer be in effect.  
The case becomes a whole new case under different rules.18

.  Change of place of trial (see section 2 of form SC-3).  If the answer requests a change of 
place of trial, you can oppose the move by filling out Plaintiff’s Response to Request for 
Change of Place of Trial (form SC-5) and sending it to the court within 20 days from the 
date you received the answer.  The court will consider both parties' statements and decide 
where the trial will be held.  You will be notified of the court's decision.

3.  Formal Answer and Request for Formal Rules 

If the defendant (1) asks for the formal Rules of Civil Procedure instead of the small claims 
District Court Civil Rules, or (2) has a counterclaim in excess of $10,000 and does not want 
to  waive  the  excess,  the  defendant  cannot  use  the  Answer  (form  SC-3)  provided  with  the 
summons.    Instead,  the  defendant  must,  within  20  days  (40  days  if  defendant  was  served 
outside the United States): 

• 

file with the court (1) a written request for the formal rules, and (2) a formal answer 
to the complaint; and 

•  serve a copy of these documents on you; and 
• 

file with the court proof that the documents were served on you.

excess of $10,000 will no longer be in effect.  The case becomes a whole new case under

as 

Important: If the defendant's formal answer includes a counterclaim against you, you must 
file a reply to that counterclaim (and serve a copy of your reply on the defendant) within 20 
days after you receive the defendant's answer.20  You can use Answer to Counterclaim (form 
CIV-482) or create your own reply following the formal rules.  If you don’t file a reply, a 
default judgment may be entered against you on the counterclaim.  This is different from the 
small claims rules, which do not require you to reply to a counterclaim.   

G.  CHANGE OF ADDRESS, EMAIL, AND TELEPHONE NUMBER. 21 
  Once the case is started, the court considers that you have received everything it mails (or emails, 
if you chose email service) to you at the address you provided.  Similarly, the defendant only has 
to mail (or email)  you documents to the address  you provided to the court.  Check  your mail 
and/or email frequently to make sure you get copies of these important documents in a timely 
manner.  Many court documents have strict deadlines for you to respond.   

f  you  change  your  mailing  address,  email  address,  or  telephone  number  while  the  case  is 
pending, you must notify both the court and the defendant in writing.  Use Notice of Change of 
Contact Information (form TF-955).   If  you want to change whether or not  you receive  court 
documents by email, file Electronic Delivery of Case Documents (form TF-820).  

H.  SETTLEMENT PRIOR TO TRIAL. 

If at any time prior to trial the claim is settled between you and the defendant, you must file a 
Dismissal (form SC-9). 

• 

• 

If the claim is settled before the defendant files an answer, you must sign the section titled 
“Dismissal by Plaintiff.” 
If the claim is settled after the defendant files an answer, both you and the defendant must 
sign the section titled “Dismissal by Stipulation.”

Chapter III 
 
WHAT TO DO IF SOMEONE SUES YOU 
IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT 

f someone sues you in small claims court, you are called the “defendant.”  The person suing you is 
called the “plaintiff.”  The plaintiffs and defendants are called “parties” in the case. 

he plaintiff must give you a copy of the complaint, the summons, and a small claims Answer (form 
SC-3),  as  well  as  any  attachments  filed  with  the  complaint.    The  plaintiff  fills  out  the  top  of  the 
answer and you fill out the rest if you agree to stay in small claims court. 

 small  claim  is  not  a criminal  action.  The plaintiff is  not  seeking to  have  you put  in  jail.   The 

plaintiff wants the court to order you to pay money and/or return personal property. 

.  WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE SERVED WITH A SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT. 

1.  Do not ignore the complaint and summons.   

f  you  do,  the  court  may  enter  a  default  judgment  against  you.    Then,  if  you  do  not  pay  this 
judgment,  the  plaintiff  may  get  other  court  orders  to  seize  your  money  or  property.    If  this 
happens, there will be extra costs that you will have to pay. 

ou have 20 days (40 days if you were served outside the United States) from the date you receive 
the summons to file your answer with the court.  If you do not file an answer by the deadline, the 
plaintiff can ask the court for a default judgment against you at any time after the deadline passes. 

.  Decide if you want to continue in small claims court or choose formal procedures.  

ead  Chapter  I  of  this  handbook  for  more  information  on  the  differences  between  these 

procedures.  Form SC-95 summarizes these differences on a chart. 

f you decide to continue with small claims rules, complete the rest of the Answer (form SC-3) 
that was served on you with the complaint and the summons.  You can also find a completely 
blank copy of this form online or ask for a new paper copy from your local court clerk.  More 
information on how to fill out form SC-3 is in paragraph C(1) on page 21.  

f you want to move the case from small claims to formal rules, you cannot use the SC-3 Answer 
form that the plaintiff sent you.  For more information on how to answer under formal rules, see 
paragraph 2 on page 24. 

.  File an answer, even if another defendant filed one.   

o not rely on someone else's answer.  If you are named as a defendant in the complaint, you 

must file an answer.  See the chart on the next page for who must sign the answer. 
 

  Read  the  complaint  carefully.    Try  to  remember  everything  you  can  about  the  incident  or 
transaction that caused the plaintiff to sue you.  Although you must file your answer within 20 
days (40 days if you were served outside the United States), you may want to wait a few days 
before  answering  so  that  any  emotional  response  has  cooled,  and  you  can  write  calmly  and 
logically.  Make sure your answer is a clear and direct response to the plaintiff's claim.  Include 
any counterclaims  you have against the plaintiff.  If  you want to talk to a lawyer, do so right 
away, so you still have enough time to file your answer with the court by the deadline.

.  Settle the case. If you agree with what the plaintiff says, you may want to contact the plaintiff 
to settle the matter between yourselves.  If you settle the matter with the plaintiff, the small 
claims case can be dismissed.  A Dismissal (form SC-9) must be signed by both of you and 
filed with the court by the plaintiff. 

.  Admit to the court.  If you agree with what the plaintiff says, but have not settled the claim 
with the plaintiff, mark the box on the answer form that says:  "I agree with what Plaintiff 
claims."  This will end your case, you will not have a court date or a trial, and the judge will 
award the plaintiff a judgment in the amount the plaintiff asked for, plus costs and interest. 

o not fill in any other check boxes or numbered sections.  Sign and date the form. Fill out 
the certificate of service for how and when you are giving a copy to the plaintiff.  Make two 
copies.  Keep one copy.  Return the original to the court and send or give the second copy to 
the plaintiff within 20 days (40 days if you were served outside the United States) from the 
date you received the summons.   

You must wait for the court to issue the judgment before  you can  make the full payment.  
This is because the judge first needs to decide how much you owe in court costs and interest 
on top of the principal amount.  Once you receive the judgment, you can pay the plaintiff 
directly (make sure to get a receipt or acknowledgment) or send or give your payment to the 
court.  If you send it to the court, make your check payable to “Clerk of Court” and write 
your case number on the memo line of the check.

B.  IF YOU AGREE WITH WHAT THE PLAINTIFF SAYS 

C.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH WHAT THE PLAINTIFF SAYS. 
 

If you disagree with what the plaintiff says, you must file an answer with the court.  First, decide 
whether you want the small claims rules (Part II District Court Civil Rules) or the formal rules 
(Part I District Court Civil Rules) to apply to your case (read Chapter I of this handbook for more 
information on the differences between the two).  If you want the small claims rules, fill out the 
rest of the Answer (form SC-3) the plaintiff sent you, as explained in paragraph 1 below.  If you 
want the formal civil rules, you must draft a formal answer as described in paragraph 2 on page 
24.  You may not use the SC-3 Answer form if you choose formal rules.  If you want to talk to a 
lawyer to help you decide what to do, you must do it quickly, because you must file either your 
small claims or your formal answer within 20 days (40 days if you were served outside the United 
States). 

 

1.  Draft your Answer under Small Claims Rules. 

See the sample Answer (form SC-3) on the next page.  Please type or print when filling out 
the form.  Use black ink. 

a  These sections should have already been filled out for you.  If they are not (or if you’d 
rather fill them out yourself), write the information exactly the same as it appears on your 
summons. 

If you check this box, skip down to section  g .  See section B(2) above for more details. 

If you disagree with what the plaintiff is asking for, check this box and explain why.  Also 
fill out the section for what you do believe that you owe the plaintiff.  If you don’t believe 
that you owe the plaintiff anything, write $0.  If you are agreeing to return a specific item 
of personal property that the plaintiff is asking for, write the approximate value of the 
item on the dollar amount line.

If you believe the plaintiff owes you money, check this box and write the amount you 
believe the plaintiff owes you and the reason why.  Write the full amount the plaintiff 
owes you, even if it is over $10,000.  You will have to give up your claim to any amount 
over $10,000, but it is important to state the full amount on this line so the judge will 
understand your claim.  

If you are seeking a penalty listed in an Alaska statute (for example, bad check penalties 
under AS 09.68.115, or penalties for failure to refund a tenant's security deposit under AS 
34.03.070(d)), you must write that in your counterclaim. 

If you are asking for the return of personal property, write on the dollar value line the 
approximate  value  of  the  property.    The  court  needs  to  know  this  so  it  can  decide 
jurisdiction (authority) to hear the case.  If you want the property back (instead of money 
for the value of the property), be sure to state this clearly.  Be aware, however, that if the 
property is gone and cannot be recovered, the only thing the court will be able to give you 
is a judgment for money. 

If you are afraid the plaintiff will get rid of, sell, or misplace the item you want back—
and it is very important to you that you get that exact item—it is a good idea to talk to a 
lawyer.  In a formal civil trial, the judge could enter an order to protect the property early 
in the case; this is not possible in a small claims case.22 

If you believe the trial should be held in another location, complete this section.  You may 
request  a  change  of  place  of  trial  if  you  will  be  put  to  unnecessary  expense  or 
inconvenience if the trial is held where the case is filed.  You may also request a change 
in the place of trial if the case was filed in a court location that is none of the following: 

• the residence or place of employment of any defendant 
• where a defendant's alleged wrongful conduct caused personal injury to the plaintiff 

• where any defendant does or solicits business (for example, where it has a store or an 

or damage to the plaintiff's property 

office or sends salespeople). 

If you request a change of place of trial, the plaintiff has 20 days to respond.  The court 
will consider both parties' statements and decide where the trial will be held.  You will be 
notified of the court's decision. 

f  Read  this  paragraph  and  make  sure  you  agree  with  it.    If  you  do  not  agree  with  this 
paragraph, then you cannot use this form and must file an answer under the formal rules 
(see section 2 on the next page).  

 

 

  Fill in all the contact information in this section.  If you would like to get all your court 
documents sent to you by email instead of regular mail, check the box at the bottom next 
to the asterisk.  Print or type everything except your signature.  Be sure to include your 
title if you are answering for a business defendant. 

If  you  have  documents  supporting  your  defense  or  your  counterclaim  (for  example: 
checks, receipts, bills, credit card agreement), you must attach them to the answer.   

  You must serve the plaintiff with a copy of your answer and all attachments.  Fill out the 
certificate of service with the date that you will mail, email, or give your documents to 
the plaintiff; select the method you used; and sign it. 

File and Serve: Make two copies of your answer and all attachments in  h . Keep one set of 
copies for your records.  File the original answer and attachments in the court where the case 
was opened (even if you are asking to change court locations).  Send the second set of copies 
to the plaintiff at the mailing address (or email address, if the plaintiff agreed to email service) 
provided on the complaint.  The court will then schedule the case for trial and notify you and 
the plaintiff in writing of the place, date, and time of the trial. 

 

 
 
22   For example, in a formal trial a judge could (1) order the item seized prior to trial (prejudgment attachment) or (2) 

 

 

 

issue a prejudgment restraining order requiring the plaintiff not to dispose of the item.

2.  Draft your Answer under Formal Rules. 
 
 

 
If you want to move the case from small claims to formal rules, you cannot use the SC-3 
Answer form that the plaintiff sent you.  Instead, you must file with the court (1) a written 
request for formal rules and (2) a formal answer to the complaint.   

In debt collection cases, you may cover both of these steps by filing Answer & Counterclaim 
to Complaint to Collect a Debt (form CIV-481), available online or from your local court 
clerk.  Check the first box on the form that states you want to move to District Court and use 
the formal rules  and procedure.  By checking this box, you are agreeing to the case being 
heard as a civil case to collect a debt according to the formal Rules of Civil Procedure and 
Evidence instead of the more informal small claims process.  

In other types of civil cases besides debt collection, the court does not provide specialized 
forms to opt into formal rules or answer the complaint under formal rules.  You will have to 
draft your own document in compliance with Civil Rules 7 through 16, 76, and 77.  You may 
want to seek the assistance of a lawyer in this situation. 

Serve your original answer and attachments with the court, serve a copy on the plaintiff, and 
file proof of service with the court.  You must do all this within 20 days (40 days if you were 
served outside the United States) after you receive the summons and complaint, or risk having 
a default judgment entered against you. 

By choosing to open the case as a small claim, the plaintiff gave up (waived) the right to a 
jury trial, formal procedure, and amounts in excess of $10,000.  This waiver is no longer valid 
if you file an answer under formal rules.  Under formal rules, either party may request a jury 
trial, may ask the court to award more than $10,000, and formal procedure will apply.   The 
case becomes a whole new case under different rules.23 
 

D.  REPLY TO COUNTERCLAIM. 
 

If you filed a counterclaim in your small claims answer, the plaintiff has the option to ask for 
formal rules.    To do this, the plaintiff must file in court (and serve  you  with  a copy of) (1) a 
written request for formal rules, and (2) a reply to your counterclaim within 10 days of receiving 
your answer.  If the plaintiff does this, the court will automatically grant the request and send you 
an Order for Formal Procedure.  Prior waivers by both you and the plaintiff of jury trial, formal 
procedure, and amounts in excess of $10,000 will no longer be in effect.  The case becomes a 
whole  new  case  under  different  rules.24    The  court  does  not  provide  forms  or  other  special 
assistance for civil cases under formal rules (except for debt collections cases, which you can 
read more about at http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/debt/index.htm).  You may wish to speak 
to a lawyer if the plaintiff chooses formal rules in the reply. 
 

E.  CHANGE OF ADDRESS, EMAIL, AND TELEPHONE NUMBER. 25 
 

nce you file your answer, the court considers that you have received everything it mails (or 
emails, if you chose email service) to you at the address you provided. Similarly, from then on, 
the plaintiff only has to mail (or email) you documents to the address you provided to the court.  
Check your mail and/or email frequently to make sure you get copies of these important 
documents in a timely manner.  Many court documents have strict deadlines for you to respond.   

f you change your mailing address, email address, or telephone number while the case is 
pending, you must notify both the court and the plaintiff in writing.  Use Notice of Change of 
Contact Information (form TF-955).  If you want to change whether or not you receive court 
documents by email, file Electronic Delivery of Case Documents (form TF-820).

Chapter IV 

PREPARING FOR TRIAL 
Once the complaint and the answer are filed, most small claims cases are ready for trial.  The court 
will send you a Notice of Trial, telling you when and where the trial will happen.  You must appear 
on that date and be prepared to present your side of the dispute.  Do not miss your trial date.  If the 
plaintiff fails to appear at the trial, the court may dismiss the case.  If the plaintiff is there and the 
defendant fails to appear, the court may grant a default judgment against the defendant.26   
A.  COLLECT EVIDENCE. 

The most important thing to do while waiting for trial is to get your evidence together.  Collect 
any papers, legal documents, photographs, or other physical evidence supporting your claim and 
bring them to your trial.  Examples are:  

letters, text messages, or emails from the opposing party  

•  contracts, bills/invoices, receipts, cancelled checks, money orders 
•  medical records in personal injury cases 
• 
•  an estimate of repair costs (it is best to have more than one estimate if possible)  
• 
the actual damaged item (if it is small enough to bring to court) 
•  pictures of larger items such as a damaged car, boat, or building  
•  photos or videos of injuries or an accident scene 

If  you have electronic evidence, it is best to print it out if you can, or have a plan on how to 
display it in court on a larger screen than a cell phone. The court will not upload files to its own 
equipment. 

B.  CONTACT WITNESSES. 

Witnesses are another source of evidence.  Examples are:  

•  a person who saw how you got injured or how your property was damaged  
•  a person who heard statements made to you by the other party  
•  a person who saw damaged goods when they were delivered 
•  a person who sold you something or accepted your payment  

Sometimes you may want to have a witness such as a mechanic or appliance repairman tell the 
judge how much something is damaged or whether it is defective.  You should let this witness 
examine the damaged or defective object ahead of trial if possible. 

Bring your witnesses with you to the trial.  If your witness has a good reason for not being able 
to be there in person, file a Request for Telephonic Participation (form SC-31).  If all you have 
is a written statement from a witness, the judge may consider it.  However, it is much better if 
the witness can testify live and answer questions. 

C.  SUBPOENA WITNESSES IF NECESSARY. 

If you believe a witness may not come to court when you ask, you can get a “subpoena” from the 
court clerk.  A subpoena is a court order requiring a person to appear and testify in court.  If a 
witness does not appear at trial, and you did not get a subpoena ahead of time, you must continue 
without that witness.  For more information, read How to Subpoena a Witness (form CIV-109).  
You will have to pay the witness a small fee if the witness is under subpoena. 

D.  PREPARE OUTLINE AND PRACTICE. 

Organize your evidence and make an outline of the main points.  Decide what order you 
want your witnesses (including yourself) to testify.  You can check off each point on your 
outline during trial to make sure you remember to tell the judge all the important facts.  Focus 
on the most relevant evidence that will help the judge understand your claim.  An outline will 
also help you not get sidetracked from the main issues.  Practice by presenting your case to a 
friend or family member.  If possible, go to court on a day before your trial to watch another 
small claim trial, so you are more familiar with the process.

Chapter V 
TRIAL 

 

If you have difficulty hearing, tell the clerk and ask to use the 
assisted listening equipment available in the courtroom. 

.  BEFORE TRIAL. 

Get to court a little early on the day of your trial.  This will give you time to get familiar with the 
courtroom.  In larger court locations, make sure to leave enough time to find parking and to go 
through security.  There are no strict rules of dress, but you should be neat and clean.  Do not 
wear any clothes with words or pictures on them that might be considered offensive.  Bring a pen 
and paper in case you need to take notes during your trial. 

In small towns and villages, the court may be only a single room and yours may be the only case 
scheduled.  In cities, there will be a courthouse with several courtrooms.  There may be several 
cases scheduled for the same time as yours.  If you cannot tell from your notice of trial which 
courtroom your trial will be in, ask the court clerk or receptionist for directions. 

You may have to wait before your case is called.  The judge may announce all the cases to be 
heard on that date, or there may be a printed "calendar" of cases posted outside the courtroom or 
at the clerk's office. 
 

B.  SUGGESTIONS ABOUT SETTLEMENT. 
 

Before trial, the judge may suggest that you and the other party try to mediate the case.  Some 
courts have volunteer, neutral mediators that can help you settle a case without trial.  Sometimes, 
a different judge from your trial judge will be willing to do a settlement conference.  Or the parties 
can  try  one  last  time  to  talk  between  themselves.    Mediations  and  settlement  conferences  are 
private and confidential, and if the case does not settle, nobody can use what  you said during 
them against you at trial.  The trial judge may also suggest some terms of settlement during the 
trial.  You are not required to settle the case, but often the judge's suggestions will be helpful. 

ne of the benefits of settlement is that you have a certain outcome that you can comfortably live 
with, even if it is not 100% what you wanted.  Trials are uncertain, and even if you think you 
have a strong case, you may lose and get nothing (if you are the plaintiff or have a counterclaim) 
or have the full judgment entered against you (if you are the defendant). 

ome other benefits of settlement include: 

•  For the plaintiff: The defendant is much more likely to be willing and able to pay the money 
if  the  defendant  agreed  to  it.    It  can  be  costly  and  time-consuming  (and  sometimes 
unsuccessful)  to  execute  a  judgment  against  a  defendant  who  won’t  pay  voluntarily  (see 
Chapter VI for more information on execution of judgments). 

•  For the defendant: You are able to avoid having a court judgment against you (judgments can 
lower  your  credit  rating  and  even  make  it  harder  to  get  certain  kinds  of  jobs).    Also, 
settlements often include payment terms (such as monthly payments or lower interest) that 
are more favorable than a judgment would be. 

•  For both parties: You may prefer a private settlement over having all of the details of your 
dispute on the public record at trial.  Trials can often (though not always) be more contentious 
and emotionally draining than mediations or settlements.  You may decide it is worth it to 
give up some of what you want to avoid that experience.   

he court will never force  you to mediate or settle  your case, but it is a good idea to at least 

consider it.

Each party in the case gets a chance to present evidence under the guidance and direction of the 
judge.  The plaintiff will go first, then the defendant.  Sometimes, the judge will give either or 
both parties a chance to go again, called “rebuttal.”  You should not assume that you will get a 
second chance though, so you should present all of the evidence you think is important on your 
first turn. 

You must present your own case at the trial or have your lawyer present it for you.  No one except 
you, your lawyer, or a qualified legal intern (or your parent or guardian if you are a minor) can 
represent you in court.  Powers of attorney do not allow a non-lawyer to represent someone in a 
small claims case. 

.  Then describe in more detail what happened and when it happened.  Usually it is best to tell 
your story in chronological order.  Stay on the subject.  Try not to ramble or get sidetracked. 

.  If you have documents, photos, or other physical items, show them to the judge while you 
testify (or during the testimony of another witness who can describe the items).  It is usually 
not very effective to give the judge a pile of papers or photos without explanation.  Instead, 
use these items as support for what you are testifying about. 

.  If you have witnesses, tell the judge you would like to call them to the witness stand.  All 
witnesses (including yourself and the opposing party) must take an oath to tell the truth before 
they testify.  Ask your witnesses questions to get them to tell the judge what they know about 
your claim.  When you are done asking questions, the opposing party has a chance to ask 
your witnesses questions (you will have the same chance to ask questions of the opposing 
party’s witnesses).  The judge may ask questions at any time.   

.  You and the opposing party will also have a chance to ask each other questions.  Do not get 
into an argument with the opposing party.  Listen carefully to the question and just answer it.  
If  you  want  to  explain  more,  you  can  do  so  after  the  opposing  party  is  done  asking  you 
questions.  It is difficult for most people to ask questions of the opposing party, because the 
person may not answer the question in the way you expect or want.  This can be frustrating 
and is  often not  the best  way to  get  information  to  the judge.    It  may  be  easier  and more 
effective for you to just tell the judge during your own testimony why you disagree with what 
the other party said. 

.  When the judge, other witnesses, or the opposing party are speaking, sit quietly at your table.  
Do not interrupt, even if you hear something upsetting or that you believe is untrue.  Take 
notes  so  you  will  remember  to  respond  to  what  you  heard  when  it  is  your  turn  to  speak.  
Comments and questions are not proper until the judge gives you permission.

Some suggestions for presenting your case: 

1.  Start with a sentence or two summarizing what your case is about. 

.  END OF TRIAL. 

At the end of the trial, the judge will decide the case based on the evidence presented.  The judge 
may do this immediately.  Or the judge may want to think about it some more and make a decision 
later (this is called "taking the case under advisement"). 

The court will either give you a copy of its final judgment at the end of trial or mail it to you. 

The court may keep any items of evidence used during trial for at least 30 days in case either 
party appeals.  You can ask for it back after this time.  Alternatively, the court may give you back 
your evidence right away.  You should keep it safe for at least 30 days in case of appeal.

Chapter VI 
AFTER TRIAL 
The judge will decide who wins the case.  The judge may award either party all, part, or none of the 
party's claim.  The judge's decision is called a "judgment."  The judge will fill out a Judgment form 
and either give it to the parties or mail it to them.  The party who wins a money judgment is called 
the “judgment creditor,” and the losing party is called the “judgment debtor.” 

If you are the debtor, you can pay the creditor directly.  Be sure to get a receipt.  If for any reason 
you cannot make payment directly to the creditor, you may pay the court.  If you pay the court, 
make your check payable to "Clerk of Court" and write your case number on your check.  The 
court will forward the money to the judgment creditor. 

After you have paid the judgment and all your checks have cleared the bank, ask the judgment 
creditor to  sign a  Satisfaction  of  Judgment (form SC-17).  This form is available  online  or in 
paper  copy  from  your  local  court  clerk.    The  judgment  creditor  must  give  you  (the  judgment 
debtor)  a  written  acknowledgment  that  the  judgment  has  been  satisfied  (unless  the  payment 
comes  from  executing  upon  your  earnings  or  property).27    The  creditor  must  also  file  this 
Satisfaction of Judgment with the court.28 

If the parties agree that payments may be made in installments, both parties must complete and 
file with the court a Stipulation to Pay Judgment in Installments (form SC-18). 

Stipulation to Pay Judgment in Installments: 

1.  Allows the judgment creditor to receive payments on a regular basis without incurring costs 

of execution. 

.  Allows the judgment debtor to make a series of partial payments without incurring additional 
costs.  As long as the debtor makes the payments as agreed, the court will not issue a Writ of 
Execution (defined in section C below) against the debtor's wages, property, or bank accounts. 

f the debtor fails to pay as agreed, the court will issue a Writ of Execution against the debtor's 
wages, property, or bank accounts at the request of the creditor.  To make this request, the creditor 
must  file  with  the  court  an  affidavit  stating  the  debtor  has  not  complied  with  the  installment 
payments agreement. 

 2

 I

.  JUDGMENT DEBTOR REFUSES TO PAY JUDGMENT. 

If the judgment debtor will not pay voluntarily, the judgment creditor may ask the court to issue 
a Writ of Execution, which is a court order directing a peace officer or process server to take 
property of the debtor to pay the judgment.  Property can include money, bank accounts, wages, 
personal and real property, or any other asset belonging to the debtor that has value. 

For  more  information,  see  Execution  Procedure:  Judgment  Creditor  Booklet  (CIV-550).    For 
information  about  the  rights  of  the  debtor,  see  Judgment  Debtor  Booklet  (CIV-511).    Both 
booklets are available online or from the court clerk.

If you think a default judgment was improperly entered against you, you can ask the court to 
set aside the judgment.  No more than one year must have passed since the date of the default 
judgment.29    To  do  this,  complete  and  file  with  the  court  a  Request  to  Set  Aside  Default 
Judgment (form SC-24).  You must show two things: 

1.  You have evidence that could win the case if there were a trial; and 

2.  You had a valid reason for failing to file an answer or appear at trial. 

The other party  gets  an opportunity to  respond  in  writing to  your request.   The court will 
review both statements and notify you in writing of its decision.  The court will not set aside 
a default judgment unless you give a good reason. 

Filing a  Request  to  Set  Aside Default  Judgment does  not automatically stop  the judgment 
creditor from collecting on the judgment.  If you wish to keep the creditor from having a Writ 
of Execution issued against you, you must (1) file a motion requesting a stay of execution, 
and (2) file a bond or make a cash deposit with the court in the amount of the judgment, plus 
interest.  The court does not have forms for this.  Contact the court for further information on 
how to post a bond. 

2.  Appeals 

If either party believes the court applied the law incorrectly or made a decision that was not 
supported by the evidence, that party may  appeal  the judgment  to  the superior  court.   An 
appeal does not automatically give you a new trial. 

The  superior  court  will  not  look  at  or  hear  any  new  evidence.    The  only  information  the 
superior court will consider on appeal is (1) the audio recording of the trial (including witness 
testimony),  (2)  any  physical  or  electronic  items  presented  as  evidence  at  the  trial,  (3)  the 
documents in the court file, and (4) legal memoranda. 

To appeal, you must file a Notice of Appeal (form AP-100) in the superior court within 30 
days from the date the judgment is sent or given to you.  Filing a Notice of Appeal does not 
prevent the creditor from enforcing (collecting) the judgment.  Appeals are complicated, and 
you should consider seeing a lawyer if you want to appeal. 

For  more  information  about  how  to  appeal  your  case,  see  Appellant  Instructions:  District 
Court to Superior Court Appeals (form AP-200), available online or from the court clerk.

SMALL CLAIMS STATUTE 

ec. 22.15.040. Small claims.  

a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, when a claim for relief does not exceed $10,000, 
exclusive of costs, interest, and attorney fees, and request is so made, the district judge or magistrate 
shall hear the action as a small claim unless important or unusual points of law are involved or the 
state is a defendant.  The Department of Labor and Workforce Development may bring an action as 
a small claim under this subsection for the payment of wages under AS 23.05.220 in an amount not 
to exceed $20,000, exclusive of costs, interest, and attorney fees.  The supreme court shall prescribe 
the procedural rules and standard forms to assure simplicity and the expeditious handling of small 
claims. 

b) All potential small claim litigants shall be informed if mediation, conciliation, and arbitration 
services are available as an alternative to litigation. 
 

DISTRICT COURT CIVIL RULES 

ULE 8.  SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY. 

(a)  The following procedure applies to a small claim action: 

 

 

(1) When  all  parties  elect  small  claims  procedure,  a  small  claim  action,  as  defined  by  AS 

22.15.040, is governed by: 
(A) this Part (Part II of the District Court Rules of Civil Procedure, Small Claims Rules); 
(B) applicable portions of Civil Rules 5, 5.1, 5.3, and 6; and 
(C) other rules specifically referenced in this Part (Part II of the District Court Rules of Civil 

Procedure, Small Claims Rules).   

(2) When the parties do not elect small claim procedure, a small claim action is governed by Part 

I of the District Court Rules of Civil Procedure. 

b) A party having a claim or claims exceeding the maximum amount of a small claim as defined by 
AS 22.15.040 may waive the right to recover the excess amount and elect to proceed under this 
Part II, by filing a written waiver of the excess amount. 
 

(c)  Actions  to  foreclose  or  enforce  statutory,  common  law  or  possessory  liens  and  actions  for 
recovery of real property may not be brought as small claims actions.  The court may, on its own 
motion, order the rules in Part I to apply in any other action when important or difficult questions 
of fact or law are involved. 
 

RULE 9.  INFORMALITY. 

ormality in pleadings, motions, and the introduction of evidence is not required.  A writing filed as 

a complaint, answer, or application shall be legible and brief. 

ULE 10.  PLEADINGS. 

a)  A small claim action is commenced by filing a complaint on the form provided by the Alaska 
court system.  The complaint is a short, plain written statement showing the nature of the claim 
for relief, signed by the plaintiff.  The complaint shall contain a statement that the plaintiff elects 
to have the claim treated as a small claim and waives the right to jury trial and the right to proceed 
formally.    A  complaint  which  does  not  contain  a  waiver  of  the  right  to  jury  trial  and  formal 
proceedings is governed by Part I of the District Court Rules of Civil Procedure.  The plaintiff's 
mailing address shall be shown on the complaint. When the complaint is based upon a written 
document, the document or a copy of it shall be attached to the complaint.

b) A party defending against a claim shall file an answer on the form provided by the Alaska court 
system.  The answer is a short, plain statement showing the nature of the defense and any claim 
that the defendant has against the plaintiff arising from the same transaction or occurrence and 
shall conform with Rule 12 of these rules.  The answer must be filed with or mailed to the court 
where  the  action  was  commenced  and  be  signed  by  the  defendant.    When  the  answer  or 
counterclaim is based upon a written document, the document or a copy of it shall be attached to 
the answer.  The defendant's mailing address shall be shown on the answer.  The defendant shall 
serve a copy of the answer on the plaintiff. 

c)  An answer form shall be served with the complaint and shall advise the defendant of the right to 
proceed  informally  under  this  Part  II  or  formally  under  Part  I  of  these  rules.    The  form  shall 
contain a statement that when the defendant requests informal proceedings, the defendant waives 
the right to trial by jury and to proceed formally.  A plaintiff against whom a counterclaim is filed 
shall have ten days after such claim is mailed to the plaintiff to withdraw the plaintiff's election 
to proceed under Part II, and failure to withdraw the election waives the plaintiff's right to trial 
by jury and formal procedure as to the counterclaim. 

d) A defendant who does not wish to contest the claim may default by failing to file an answer or 
may file an answer agreeing with the complaint.  The latter shall be sufficient basis for entry of 
judgment  on  the  pleadings  by  the  court  or  clerk  when  the  claim  is  for  a  specific  amount  of 
damages. 
 

RULE 11.  PROCESS. 

a)  The  summons  shall  be  issued  and  the  summons  and  complaint  served,  according  to  the 
procedures of Civil Rule 4, except that service on a defendant who is outside the state shall be 
allowed 

(1) 
(2) 

in accordance with AS 34.03.340 of the Landlord-Tenant Act; 
in accordance with AS 09.05.020, entitled Service of Process on Nonresident Owner or 
Operator of Motor Vehicle; or 

(3)  as otherwise permitted under Civil Rule 4. 

 

(b) The summons shall include instructions for accessing the Alaska Small Claims Handbook on the 
Alaska Court System’s website or requesting a printed copy from the clerk.  A blank answer form 
shall be served with the summons and complaint. 

c)  All parties shall inform the court and other parties of any change in mailing address during the 
pendency of the action.  The parties are deemed to have received all documents mailed to them 
at the addresses furnished by them. 

d) Civil Rule 45(a), (b), (c), (e), and (f), concerning subpoenas is incorporated in these rules for the 
purpose  of  securing  the  attendance  of  witnesses  at  trial,  except  that  the  fee  tendered  with  a 
subpoena need only cover the fees for mileage and for one-half day's attendance if the person's 
attendance, including travel time, requires no more than three consecutive hours. 

ULE 12.  VENUE. 

a)  The action shall be filed and the complaint shall contain a statement that it is filed: 

(1) At the nearest place to the residence or place of employment of an individual defendant; or 
(2) At  the  place  where  the  defendant's  alleged  wrongful  conduct  caused  personal  injury  or 

damage to the plaintiff's property; or 

(3) At a place where the defendant does or solicits business; and 
(4) At a place which will not cause unnecessary expense or inconvenience to the defendant.

(b) The answer shall contain any application of the defendant for change of place of trial.  The change 
shall be granted if the action is not filed in accordance with Rule 12(a).  An effective waiver of 
Rule 12(a) can be made only after the commencement of the action. 

c)  The  plaintiff  shall  have  twenty  days  from  service  of  the  answer  by  the  defendant  to  file  a 
statement  opposing  an  application  for  change  of  place  of  trial.    The  court  shall  consider  the 
application upon the statements of the parties, and shall issue an order granting or denying the 
application.  A copy of the order shall be sent to the parties by first class mail at the addresses 
shown on their pleadings.  When the application is granted, the file shall be transferred.  When 
the application is denied, the court shall set the action for trial. 

ULE 13.  DEFENSES AND OBJECTIONS --- WHEN AND HOW PRESENTED. 

a)  A  defendant  shall  file  or  state  an  answer  within  20  days  after  service  of  the  summons  and 

complaint upon the defendant.  A counterclaim shall be deemed denied by the plaintiff. 

b) When an answer is plainly insufficient to state a defense, the court may on its own motion enter 
judgment on the pleadings without trial.  A judgment on the pleadings shall state the reasons for 
its entry. 

ULE 14.  JOINDER OF PARTIES AND CLAIMS. 

a)  Minors and other persons under legal disability may appear only through guardians, guardians 

ad litem, or conservators. 

b) Any person having a claim or against whom a claim is made arising from the same transaction 

or occurrence which gave rise to the complaint may be joined as a party to the action. 

c)  Persons  having  a  joint  interest  in  the  subject  matter  of  the  action  and  other  persons  whose 
participation is necessary for the court to give complete relief to those already parties shall be 
joined in the action if the court can obtain jurisdiction over them. 

d) Parties may be added or dropped by order of the court on application of any party or on its own 
motion at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just.  A person not already a party to 
the action added by the court shall be served copies of all pleadings and a summons in the manner 
provided by these rules unless such service is waived. 

e)  A party may join any number of claims arising from any number of transactions and occurrences 
against an opposing party, so long as the total amount of the claims does not exceed the small 
claim jurisdictional limitation. 

f)  The court may order any claim against any party to be severed and proceed to try it separately. 

ULE 15.  ATTORNEYS -- INTERNS. 

a)  A corporation or other public or private organization may be represented in any stage of a small 
claims  proceeding  including  an  appeal  by  any  officer  or  employee  authorized  in  writing  to 
represent it, AS 22.20.040 notwithstanding. 

b) Any party to  a small  claims action may be represented at  any stage of the proceedings by an 

attorney at law or a legal intern. 

c)  Any  party,  except  an  attorney  at  law,  asserting  a  claim  as  an  assignee  thereof,  whether  for 
collection,  fee,  or  value,  shall  be  represented  at  all  stages  of  an  action  upon  the  claim  by  an 
attorney at law, or a legal intern.  On application of a party or on its own motion, the court shall 
dismiss without prejudice any action filed or proceeded with in violation of this rule. 

d) Representation of a party by a legal intern at any stage of an action shall be governed by Part IV

RULE 16.  TRIAL. 

a)  Every  small  claims  action  shall  be  tried  by  the  court  without  a  jury.    A  judge  may  not  be 

peremptorily challenged either under Civil Rule 42(c) or AS 22.20.022. 

b) The court may admit any evidence that is relevant and material, despite the fact that such evidence 

might be inadmissible under formal rules of evidence. 

c)  The  court  may  investigate  the  controversy  between  the  parties  either  in  or  out  of  court.    The 
investigation must be made in the presence of the parties and the findings of fact resulting from 
the investigation must be stated on the record or reduced to writing and placed in the case file by 
the court. 

d) Testimony shall be given under oath and may be given in narrative fashion, and the examination 
of witnesses shall be informal.  An adverse party has the right to cross-examine a party or witness.  
The court may take an active role in the examination of witnesses. 

e)  The court may, at any time, consult with the parties on the record for the purpose of reaching a 

compromise or conciliation. 

f)  The date set for trial shall be not less than 15 days from the date the court mails notice of the trial 

a)  If the defendant fails to answer the complaint within 20 days after service of process or fails to 
attend  the  trial,  the  defendant  is  in  default.    Default  judgment  shall  be  entered  only  after  the 
plaintiff  files  an  affidavit  made  upon  good  faith  belief,  after  diligent  inquiry,  stating  that  the 
defendant is not an infant or otherwise incompetent, and that the defendant is not in the active 
military  service  of  the  United  States  or,  if  the  plaintiff  is  unable  to  determine  whether  the 
defendant is in military service, stating that the plaintiff is unable to determine that fact.  Unless 
proof of service has been previously filed with the court, the plaintiff must attach proof of service 
showing that the summons and complaint were served on the defendant.   The court shall also 
require proof under oath, made upon personal knowledge or based on business records, of the 
truth of every essential element of the claim for relief.  The clerk may enter a default judgment if 
the damages alleged are liquidated and no default hearing is required.  If the defendant answers 
but fails to appear at trial, the court may nevertheless consider any relevant and material evidence 
filed with the answer.  The court may allow an answer to be filed after the defendant is in default, 
but before judgment is entered, upon a showing of good cause.  The plaintiff may move the court 
to enter a default judgment if the defendant is in default.  Affidavits or exhibits necessary to the 
entry of default judgment under this rule shall accompany the motion.  The motion, including 
affidavits and exhibits, must be served on the defendant.  Default may not be entered less than 
seven days following service of the motion. 

b) Judgment on the pleadings may be entered pursuant to Rules 13(b) and 10(d). 

c)  If the plaintiff fails to attend the trial, the plaintiff is in default.  When neither party appears, the 
court may dismiss the action with prejudice.  When the defendant appears and the plaintiff does 
not, the court shall inquire of the defendant concerning the validity of the defendant's defense 
and the defendant's knowledge, if any, of the reasons for the plaintiff's absence.  The court may 
then, in its discretion, enter judgment dismissing the claim with prejudice.  If the defendant has 
asserted a counterclaim, it shall be disposed of according to paragraph (a) of this rule.

(d) When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, 
cross-claim, or third-party claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct the 
entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon 
an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for 
the entry of judgment.  In the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other 
form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all of the claims or the rights 
and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or 
parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry 
of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties. 

e)  A default judgment shall not be different in kind from or exceed in amount that prayed for in the 
demand for judgment.  Except as to a party against whom a default judgment is entered, every 
final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, 
even if the party has not demanded such relief in the pleadings. 

f)  Dismissal for Want of Prosecution.  Actions which have been pending in a court for more than 
six months without any proceedings having been taken may be dismissed as a matter of course 
for want of prosecution by the court on its own motion or on motion of a party to the action.  The 
clerk shall review all pending cases semi-annually, and in all cases in which no proceedings have 
been taken for more than six months, shall send notice to the parties to show cause in writing 
why the action should not be dismissed. If good cause to the contrary is not shown within 30 days 
of distribution of the notice, the court shall dismiss the action.  The clerk may dismiss actions 
under this paragraph if a party has not opposed dismissal.  A dismissal for want of prosecution is 
without prejudice unless the court states in the order that the case is dismissed with prejudice. 

g) A  claim  may  be  dismissed  with  or  without  prejudice  and  without  court  order  at  any  time  by 
agreement of the parties, or upon written notice by the plaintiff at any time before the defendant 
has  filed  an  answer.    A  dismissal  with  prejudice  bars  action  in  any  court  based  on  the  claim 
dismissed. 

h) Judgment  by  confession  may  be  entered  pursuant  to  Civil  Rule  57.    Judgment  pursuant  to  a 
compromise may be entered by written agreement of the parties or by oral declarations on the 
record at trial.  

i)  After trial, the court shall enter judgment.  The judgment need not be supported by findings of 

fact or conclusions of law.  The judgment shall specify the exact relief given. 

j)  If the judgment is entered upon a written instrument, the instrument shall be filed with the court 

and canceled by marks or writing across its face, unless the court orders otherwise. 

k) The  court  or  the  clerk  may  order  a  money  judgment  payable  in  installments  and  stay  levy  of 
execution  upon  stipulation  of  the  parties.    In  the  event  the  judgment  is  ordered  payable  in 
installments, it shall bear interest as provided by law.  If the terms of a judgment made payable 
in  installments  are  violated,  execution  may  issue  for  the  balance  of  the  judgment  remaining 
unpaid. 

l)  The clerk shall distribute a copy of every order or judgment entered to all parties to the action.  
Every order and judgment  shall include a clerk's certificate of distribution as defined in  Civil 
Rule 58.1(d). 

ULE 18.  APPEAL. 

ither party may appeal a judgment or an order refusing to relieve any party from a default.  The 
procedure on appeal shall be governed by the rules for appeal of judgments of the district court to 
the superior court, except that the superior court shall grant trial de novo if the proceedings in the 
district court were not of record.

RULE 19.  RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT. 

ivil Rule 60 applies to motions for relief from judgment in small claim actions. 

ULE 20.  REMEDIES. 

a)  A small claims judgment may be enforced in the same manner as other judgments.  No execution 
shall  issue  for  two  days  after  the  date  shown  in  the  clerk's  certificate  of  distribution  on  the 
judgment. 

b) No attachment or garnishment shall issue before judgment in a small claim action. 

c)  Costs shall be allowed as a matter of course to a prevailing party.  Allowable costs include the 
filing fee and other charges made by the court, the expense of service of process, and witness 
fees.  An award of attorney’s fees may also be made, but shall not exceed $1,000.  In cases where 
a default judgment is entered against a defendant, the clerk may enter the award of costs, as well 
as attorney’s fees of 10% of the judgment or reasonable actual fees, whichever is less. 

d) A party may deposit with the court all or any part of any sum of money or any other thing capable 
of manual delivery which is sought in the action or due under a judgment.  The party making the 
deposit shall inform all other parties to the action of the deposit.  The court shall be governed by 
Rule 5, Alaska Rules Governing the Administration of All Courts, and shall release the deposit 
to the party entitled to it when the party becomes entitled to it.  No interest shall accrue against a 
party making a deposit, to the extent of the deposit, after it is made. 

e)  When the judgment has been satisfied, the judgment creditor shall file an acknowledgment of 
satisfaction with the court.  The court may issue a satisfaction of judgment if the judgment debtor, 
by motion served on the judgment creditor, establishes that the judgment has been satisfied.  The 
clerk may issue the satisfaction if the motion is unopposed. 

ULE 21.  ASSISTANCE TO LITIGANTS -- HANDBOOK. 

he court system shall prepare the Alaska Small Claims Handbook and make it available on the court 
system’s website.  Courts must also have physical copies of the handbook available to the public.  
Magistrate judges and clerks of any district court are authorized, when necessary, to assist litigants 
in  the  preparation  of  complaints  and  answers  and  service  of  process  forms.  If  a  litigant  needs 
assistance, the clerk or magistrate judge should first refer the litigant to the handbook.  If a litigant 
needs  additional  assistance  because  the  litigant  cannot  read  or  write  the  English  language  or  is 
physically unable to write, and the litigant is unable to obtain assistance from a friend or relative, the 
clerk or magistrate judge shall write the litigant’s information and response on the appropriate form.  
A form written by the clerk or magistrate judge shall be signed by the litigant.  The clerk or magistrate 
judge shall note on the form that he or she wrote it for the litigant under this rule. 

ULE 22.  LEGAL EFFECT OF RULES. 

a)  The forms published by the Alaska Court System to accompany these rules are legally sufficient 

and are intended to indicate the simplicity and brevity which the rules contemplate. 

b) The Alaska Small Claims Handbook published by the Alaska Court System to accompany these 

rules is not a rule of court. 

c)  The forms for the complaint, the summons and the answer published by the Alaska Court System 

shall be used by the parties. All other forms are illustrative and not mandatory.
