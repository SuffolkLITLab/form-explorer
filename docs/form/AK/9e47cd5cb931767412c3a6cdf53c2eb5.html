      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR REQUESTING A PROTECTIVE ORDER 
AGAINST STALKING OR SEXUAL ASSAULT 

OTE: If you are the one asking for protection, you are called the “petitioner.”  The person you 

are filing against and asking for protection from is called the “respondent.” 

tep 1.  Fill out the following two forms: 

1.  Petition for Sexual Assault Protective Order (form CIV-750) or  

 

Petition for Stalking Protective Order (form CIV-752) 

2.  Confidential Law Enforcement Information Sheet (form DV-127) 

These forms are available online to  type out and  print, or in paper copy from your 
local court.  You can also use the Petition Wizard to create these forms—the link is 
available on the forms page at: www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#stalk 

tep 2.  File the forms in court.  You may bring them in person or send them by email.  If 
you are only requesting a long-term (one-year) order, you can also mail it in. 
Directory  of  addresses  and  open  hours:  www.courts.alaska.gov/courtdir/index.htm.  
Email directory: www.courts.alaska.gov/courtdir/efiling.htm. 
 
You must file at a court location that is in the same judicial district where (1) you 
live,  or  (2)  where  the  respondent  lives, or  (3)  where  the  sexual  assault  or  stalking 
occurred.  If you do not, the judge will not have the authority to grant the order. 

tep 3.  Ex Parte Hearing and Judge’s Decision on Request.  If you request a 20-day 
(“ex parte”) order, a judge will review your petition soon after you file it (usually the 
same  day)  and  decide  whether  to  issue  the  order.    You  may  have  to  attend  a 
hearing (in person or by phone) and answer questions.  If you are not available for 
this hearing, your petition could be denied.  Contact the court clerk for details about 
your local court’s procedures on hearings and how you need to be available. 

If the judge grants your request for a 20-day order, you will get a copy of the order 
to keep, and the court will give another copy to the local police or troopers to give to 
the respondent.1  If you also requested a one-year order, the judge will schedule a 
hearing on that request and put the date and time on your 20-day order.  Even if the 
judge denies your request for a 20-day order, the judge may still schedule a hearing 
to decide whether to grant a one-year order (if you requested one).   

tep 4.  Long-Term Hearing and Judge’s Decision on Request.  If you asked for a 20-
day order, the information about the long-term hearing should be on the order the 
judge already gave you.  If it is not listed or you can’t find it, call the court clerk.  If 
you only asked for the one-year order, the court will schedule a long-term hearing, 
usually in 2-4 weeks, and send or give you a notice of the specific date, time, and 
location.  The local police or troopers will give this same notice to the respondent.   

Both you and the respondent will have a chance to speak at the long-term hearing.  
You  must  attend  the  hearing  and  explain  why  you  want  the  order.    If  you  do  not 
attend (or call in if it is telephonic), the judge will deny your request. 

                                                 
1 If the respondent lives out of state, the troopers will coordinate service with out-of-state police.  Be 
sure to let the judge and/or court clerk know if this situation applies to you when you first file.

Frequently Asked Questions 

How do I know when the respondent has been served with the protective order? 

Some police agencies will notify you, but many do not.  You can call the non-emergency number 
for the police or troopers to find out if the respondent was served.  You can also check CourtView 
(available on  the  court’s website) or  call  the court.   There may be a  delay of  1-3  days  between 
when service actually happened and when it is reported to the court or shows up in CourtView.  

What do I do if the respondent violates the order? 

Call  your  local  police  or  troopers  to  report  violations.    They  are  the  ones  who  will  enforce  the 
order, not the court.  If there is enough evidence that a violation occurred, the respondent may be 
arrested and charged with a crime. 

What do I do to prepare for my long-term hearing? 

The most important thing is to show up (or call in) on time, so that you can testify and answer the 
judge’s questions.  If you have things like documents, photos, or text messages to show the judge, 
have  them  organized  and  ready  in  front  of  you.    If  you  are  not  going  to  be  at  the  hearing  in 
person, make sure that you send these documents or other files to the court at least three days 
before your hearing.   

How do I change something in my protective order? 

File  a Request to Modify Protective Order  (form  DV-131).    The  respondent  will  get  a  chance  to 
respond.  The court may schedule a hearing on your request.  It is important to attend this hearing 
or your request could be denied.  For 20-day orders, the modification hearing will be held within a 
few days.  For one-year orders, the hearing is usually 2-4 weeks from when you file the request. 

How do I extend the expiration date on my one-year protective order? 

If your order will expire in less than 30 days or if it expired less than 60 days ago, file a Request to 
Extend Long-Term Protective Order (form DV-132).   It is best to file at least 10 days before your 
current order expires, to avoid a gap in protection.  The court will schedule a hearing on your 
request.  It is important to attend this hearing or your request could be denied.  If your order 
expired more than 60 days ago, you will need to file a new petition instead. 

What if I don’t want the protective order anymore?  

File a Request to Dissolve Protective Order (form DV-133) to ask that the order be dismissed and 
end early.  Usually, the court will not hold a hearing on this request if it is filed by the petitioner, 
although in some cases, the judge may want to ask you questions to make sure that you are 
ending the protective order of your own free choice and are not being threatened or coerced. 

What if the respondent asks to change or end the order, and I disagree with that? 

You can file a Response to Request to Modify, Extend, or Dissolve a Protective Order (form DV-
140).  You should also attend the hearing on the request, if one is scheduled.  If you are unsure if 
there is a hearing scheduled, contact your court clerk and ask.  It is not required to file a response 
or attend the hearing, but since you are the person protected by the order, it is important for the 
judge to hear from you about why you disagree with the request.  This will help the judge make a 
more informed decision. 

For more information on the protective order process, see https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/shcdv.htm  

MPORTANT: Requests to modify, extend, or dismiss protective orders are not effective until 
and unless a judge approves them.  Parties must continue to follow the terms of all protective 
orders in effect until you get paperwork, signed by a judge, that changes them.  If you are not 
sure whether a judge has changed the order, contact the court clerk for a copy of the latest order.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
