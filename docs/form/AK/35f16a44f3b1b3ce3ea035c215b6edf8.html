Published by The Alaska Court System 
PUB-9  
(12/08)(goldenrod) 

What is a misdemeanor arraignment? 
A misdemeanor arraignment is a district court hearing.  At this hearing,  you will be told your rights and 
the charge against you; the judge will  ask you to plead not guilty, guilty, or no contest to the charges 
brought against you; and other court hearings will be scheduled, as necessary. 

hat will happen when I’m in the courtroom? 

You should be given a copy of  the complaint filed against you.  The  complaint is a document that 
tells you the charge against you.  It may  be brought by the State of  Alaska or by your local city or 
borough  government. 

When your case is called, the judge will ask you if  your name is spelled correctly and if  your date of  birth 
is correct on the complaint.  The judge  will tell you the crime with which you are charged. 

The judge will then tell you the maximum possible penalties for the  crime with which you are charged. 
The judge will also tell you if  there  are any mandatory minimum penalties for the crime – that is, the 
fine, number of  days in jail, and/or other penalties that must be imposed if  you are found guilty of  the 
crime. 

hat will happen if  I plead guilty or no contest? 

If  you plead guilty or no contest, the judge will convict and sentence you at the arraignment, or shortly 
thereafter. 

Jail Time:  If  the judge decides you must serve time in jail and  you are not presently in 
custody, the judge will tell you the day  and time when you must report to jail. 
Fine:  If  you are ordered to pay a fine, the judge will also tell  you when you must pay it.  If  you 
need more time, tell the judge immediately. 
If  you are referred to an alcohol program, you must go to the  program as directed by the 
court or you will be arrested and  brought back to court. 
For certain driving offenses, your driver’s license may be revoked. 
You may be required to make restitution, that is, pay for any  damage you caused and/or do 
community service. 
 

What if  I missed my arraignment? 
Call the court immediately and make arrangements to come to court  immediately.  There may have been a 
bench warrant issued for your arrest  when you did not show up. 

hat are my rights? 

Your rights are very important to you.  If  you do not understand the rights that the judge explains, tell 
the judge when your case is called. 

Silence:  You have a right to not say anything.  You do not have to make any statements or answer 
any questions.  Any statements  you make may be used against you. 

Lawyer:  You have a right to have a lawyer help you with your  case. A lawyer is a person who has 
studied the laws of  Alaska and  has passed a test to show that he or she understands these laws.

If  you want a lawyer but cannot afford to hire one, you have the  right to a court appointed lawyer. 
If  the court appoints a lawyer  for you, you will be required to repay part of  the cost of  the  lawyer 
if  you are convicted. 
If  a lawyer represents you, he or she will talk with you about the  facts of  your case, in private. 
Your lawyer is not allowed to tell  anyone else what you say about your case unless you want him or 
her to do so. 
Your lawyer will come to court with you and speak on your behalf.  Your lawyer may negotiate with 
the prosecutor regarding  the charges or sentence. 
Your lawyer will examine the charges that have been brought  against you to see if  they are in 
proper form.  Because your  lawyer has been trained in the law, he or she might see some  mistakes 
that you might not see in the legal papers, which have  been filed against you.  Your lawyer will 
prepare and file legal  papers for you. 

Presumption of  innocence:  You are considered innocent  unless you are proven guilty beyond a 
reasonable doubt at trial, or unless you plead guilty or no contest to the charges against you. 

Trial:  You have a right to have a trial.  A trial is a hearing at which it is decided if  you are 
guilty or not guilty. 
If  you decided to have a trial, you can have a jury trial or a trial  before a judge without a jury. 
At a trial, you have the right to  listen to and look at the people who testify against you and you 
can ask them questions about what they say. 
You have the right to call your own witnesses at trial to give your side of  the story.  If  they won’t 
come voluntarily, the court can  prepare a legal paper called a subpoena, which requires your 
witnesses to come to your trial.  You can either testify or stay  silent at trial.  The fact that you stay 
silent and don’t speak cannot  be used against you. 
You also have the right to a speedy trial, which means that your  trial must be held within 120 days 
from the date you were served  with the charging document.  However, if  you or your lawyer 
causes a delay in your trial, your case can still go to trial after 120  days have passed. 

Release before trial:  If  you plead not guilty and ask for a trial,  you will not necessarily have to 
stay in jail until your trial is held.  You may be released on your own recognizance, that is, on the 
basis of  your promise to come back to court for your future  court appearances or upon a 
reasonable bail while waiting for a  trial. 

hat are the pleas? 

You can choose a plea of  not guilty, guilty, or no contest to the charges  against you. 
1.  Not guilty:  This plea can mean any one of  the following four things: 

a.  You did not do what you are charged with doing, or 
b.  You want to raise a legal defense or excuse to the charge  against you, or 
c.  You want the prosecution to present the case against you in court and prove that you are guilty of 

the charge beyond a  reasonable doubt, or 

d.  You are not sure how you want to plead now and you want to  think about it some more. 

If  you plead not guilty, you will be given a trial.  If  you have decided that you want to have a 
lawyer help you with your case,  the judge will enter a not guilty plea for you at arraignment. 
Later, after you see your lawyer, you can decide whether or not  you want to change this plea.

Guilty:  If  you plead guilty, you will be admitting that you  committed the crime with which you 
are charged.  You will  also be saying that you don’t want to raise any defenses to the 
charges  against  you.  You  will  be  giving  up  your  rights  to  remain  silent  and  to  be  presumed 
innocent until proven guilty beyond a  reasonable doubt at trial.  If  you plead guilty at arraignment, 
you will be convicted and sentenced at that time or shortly thereafter. 

No contest:  If  you plead no contest, you will be saying you will  not fight the charge against you. 
You will be giving up all your  rights as if  you were pleading guilty, except that you do not give  up 
your right to remain silent.  A judgment of  conviction will be entered against you and you will be 
sentenced as if  you had  pleaded guilty to the charge. 

f you don’t understand the differences between the pleas after  reading this explanation and after 
listening to the judge, ask the  judge to explain further before you decide what plea you  want 
to make.

hat will happen if  I plead not guilty? 

If  you plead not guilty, the judge will tell you when you must come back  to court for your next court 
appearance. 

he judge will then decide the conditions under which you can be  released pending your next court 
appearance.  Depending on the  circumstances of  your case, the judge may decide to release you on the 
basis of  your personal promise to come back to court.  Or the judge may  decide that you must post bail 
money or agree to other conditions before  you can be released. 

mportant note: If  you want a lawyer to help you, or one has been  appointed for you, contact the 
lawyer immediately.  If  you wait, your  lawyer may not have time to prepare your case properly for you. 
Do not  wait!

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
