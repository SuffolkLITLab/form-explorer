      <pre>HOW TO GET A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROTECTIVE ORDER 

f you are in immediate danger, call 911.  You can also call the National Domestic Violence 
Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) and 1-800-787-3224 (TTY) or text “start” to 88788. 

ou can find resources to help you make a safety plan online, at the library, and at your local 

domestic violence and sexual assault shelter.  See https://andvsa.org/find-help/member-
programs/ to find local domestic violence resources and sexual assault shelters. 

f you have questions or if you need an interpreter, ask your local court for help. 

 
What is a Domestic Violence Protective Order? 

•  A protective order is signed by a judge and orders another person to do or not do certain 

things to keep you safe.  For example, protective orders commonly tell the other person to 
stay away from you and not contact you.   

•  You can file a petition in court to ask for a protective order if someone committed an act 

of domestic violence against you.  You can also file on behalf of your children or someone 
you are a legal guardian for.   

•  Asking for a protective order is not the same as reporting a crime to the police.  You have 

the right to report a crime to the police at any time.   

•  These instructions explain how to ask for a domestic violence protective order.  You can 

find more information at ak-courts.info/pub22. 

 
How do I ask the court for a protective order? 

•  File Petition for Domestic Violence Protective Order.  For one person, use form DV-100.  For 

more than one person (for example, you and your children), use DV-100M.  
•  All public domestic violence forms are available online at ak-courts.info/dvforms.  

Fillable PDF Forms 

Petition Wizard 

• 

Instead of filling out the petition form directly, you can use the Petition Wizard, an internet 
program that will guide you through the process.  At the end, you will receive a petition 
that you can file in court.   

•  Available online at ak-courts.info/dvwizard. 

How do I fill out the petition? 

Petitioner.  The “petitioner” is the person who will be protected by the protective order.  If 
you are filling out the petition for yourself, you are the petitioner.  If you are filling out the 
petition for a minor child, the child is the petitioner.  Write the child’s name, date of birth, and 
your relationship to the child.    

Respondent.  The “respondent” is the person you are asking to be protected from.  You must 
provide the respondent’s first and last name and, if you know it, date of birth.  If the 
respondent is a minor child, it is helpful to provide the name of the child’s parent, guardian, or 
other person who is legally responsible for the child.   

Case Number.  Do not write on this line - court staff will assign a number and fill it in for you.

Types of Protective Orders You Can Ask For. 

•  A Short-Term Protective Order (also called an “ex parte” order) gives you 

immediate protection.  It lasts for 20 days unless the judge extends it.  The judge is 
able to grant or deny the petition based only on what you write in the petition and 
what you testify about at the hearing, if there is a hearing.  The judge can grant this 
protective order without telling the respondent that you filed a petition, and without 
hearing from the respondent.  You do not have to tell the respondent that you are 
asking for a protective order, but if you did, check the box on the form and tell the 
judge how you tried to tell the respondent you were asking for the protective order.  

•  A Long-Term Order can last up to one year.  A judge can only grant a long-term 

order after a hearing.  The respondent must get at least 10 days’ notice of the court 
hearing and have a chance to speak at the hearing.  If the respondent had notice, but 
chose not to come to the hearing, the judge can still grant the order.  Police officers or 
troopers are responsible for notifying the respondent about the hearing. 

•  Both a Short-Term and a Long-Term Order.  If you want both types of order, check 
both boxes on your petition.  If you request both orders, and your short-term order is 
granted, the court will schedule a hearing when the judge will decide on the long-term 
protective order.  The respondent has an opportunity to attend the hearing and contest 
the order.  If the short-term order is not granted, the court may or may not schedule a 
long-term hearing.   

Relationship between the Petitioner and the Respondent.  To get a domestic violence 
protective order, you must have a certain type of relationship with the respondent.  There is a 
list of the qualifying relationships on page 5 of these instructions.  Check the box on the form 
that fits your relationship.  If you do not have one of these relationships, you may be eligible for 
a Sexual Assault or Stalking Protective Order.  See Instructions for Requesting a Protective 
Order against Stalking or Sexual Assault  (form CIV-751) for more information.   

Describe the Domestic Violence.  To issue a protective order, the judge must determine 
whether a crime of domestic violence has occurred.  You do not need to know the names of 
these crimes or which specific one happened to you, but you need to describe in detail what the 
respondent did to you or your children.  Try to include dates and places if you remember them.  
There is a list of domestic violence crimes at the end of these instructions.   

Protections Requested.  At a minimum, a protective order tells the respondent not to commit 
domestic violence, stalking, or harassment against you, or threaten to do so.  The petition form 
lists many examples of other protections you might want to ask for.  Some protections are only 
available in a long-term protective order.  Think about what would make you feel safe and what 
would allow you to resume your life.  If you want to ask the judge to order the respondent to 
pay the costs that resulted from the domestic violence, list the details of each expense and the 
specific amount of money.  Be sure to bring documentation about the costs (medical bills, 
receipts or estimates of the cost to replace damaged property, etc.) to the long-term hearing. 

Child Custody and Child Support.  If you and the respondent have children together, you 
can ask the judge to make some temporary orders about where the children will live.  Explain in 
detail when you think you should have the children and when the respondent should have the 
children, and how the children will be exchanged between you if a protective order is in place.  
You can also request that the respondent pay you child support.  If you ask for child support, 
give the judge as much information as possible about the respondent’s income.  Try to bring 
copies of tax forms and pay stubs for both you and the respondent to the long-term hearing.

Assistance from Law Enforcement.  If you need help from local police or troopers to return 
to your home, or to get your personal items, pets, or children, explain to the judge what you’ll 
need help with. 

Information about the Respondent.  This information will help law enforcement locate the 
respondent to give the respondent a copy of the protective order and notice about any long-
term hearing.  If law enforcement officers cannot find the respondent to do this service, then 
the protective order cannot be enforced, so it is very important that you provide as much 
specific information as possible.  The Confidential Law Enforcement Information Sheet (form 
DV-127) that is attached to the petition gives you space to provide more details.  Make sure 
that you also fill out form DV-127 as completely as you can. 

Information about the Petitioner.  The court must be able to contact you for court hearings 
and to provide paperwork, so it is very important to give the court your current phone 
number, an email if you have one, and a mailing address.  If you request it, this information 
can be placed in a special envelope that is only available to court staff and not to the 
respondent.  If you want to keep your contact information confidential, explain this to the court 
clerk when you file your petition. 

Sign and File the Petition.  Sign your petition in front of a notary or court clerk.  If there is 
no notary or court clerk available, sign the petition and attach Self-Certification (No Notary 
Available) (form TF-835).  When you sign the petition, you are swearing that everything you 
wrote in it is true.  If you file your petition electronically, save a copy of it if you can do so 
safely.  If you file the petition in person, the court clerk will make a copy for you, which you 
should also keep if you can do so safely.  You can file your petition by email (email directory: 
https://courts.alaska.gov/courtdir/efiling.htm#featured-content-1) or in person at your local 
court.  If you are only asking for a long-term order, you can also mail it in (list of addresses: 
https://courts.alaska.gov/courtdir/index.htm).     
 

 

What happens after I file my petition for a protective order? 

For requests for short-term protective orders, the judge will review it quickly, usually the same 
day that you file.  The judge may or may not hold a hearing.  You can ask the court clerk what 
the usual local procedures are.  Be prepared to wait and/or be available by phone for your 
hearing for several hours after you file.  The judge will then enter an order either granting or 
denying the protective order.   

If you only requested a long-term protective order, the court clerk will either give you or mail 
you a notice of when the long-term hearing will be.  The judge will decide whether to grant the 
order after the hearing takes place. 
 

What happens if the judge denies my petition for a short-term protective order? 

None of the things you requested in the petition are in effect.  In other words, everything will 
continue as if you never filed the petition.  If you requested a long-term order, the court may 
set a hearing (usually in 2-3 weeks) to hear from both you and the respondent about whether 
or not to grant the long-term order.

What happens if the judge grants my petition for a short-term protective order? 

Help from Law Enforcement.  If the judge ordered the police or troopers to help enforce the 
order (for example, to help you get property or children), contact your local law enforcement to 
arrange this. 

Serving the Respondent.  The court will immediately notify law enforcement about the 
protective order so that law enforcement can attempt to give the respondent a copy.  This is 
called “serving” the protective order.  A police officer, state trooper, or VPSO is responsible for 
serving the respondent with the protective order.  If you want to know whether the order was 
served, you can call the non-emergency number for law enforcement or check CourtView (it 
may take up to 72 hours for this information to be updated in CourtView).  Do not serve the 
respondent yourself.  This can be dangerous for you, and it does not count as service for 
legal purposes.  The order will only be enforceable after it is served by law enforcement.  

Violating the Protective Order.  Once the respondent has been served with the order, it 
may be a crime for the respondent to violate it.  Report violations of the protective order to 
your local law enforcement.  

Future Hearings.  If you asked for a long-term protective order, the court will set a hearing to 
hear from both you and the respondent about whether or not to grant the long-term order.  If 
you are not sure when the hearing is scheduled, call your local court and ask. 

Changing, Extending, or Ending a Protective Order.  After the judge issues the protective 
order, you can ask the judge to: 

•  change (modify) the order.  Use Request to Modify Protective Order (form DV-131 or 

•  continue (extend) a long-term order.  Use Request to Extend Long-Term Protective 

Order (form DV-132 or DV-132M) 

•  end (dissolve) the order.  Use Request to Dissolve Protective Order (form DV-133 or DV-

DV-131M). 

133M) 

These forms are available in paper copy at the court clerk's office, and they are available online 
at ak-courts.info/dvforms.

CRIMES INVOLVING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 

o qualify as a domestic violence crime: 

•  A crime must be committed or attempted; and 
•  The crime must have been committed by one household member against another 

household member; and 

•  The crime must be one of the crimes listed in the Alaska statute, or a violation of a 

similar law of another city or state. 

Definition of “household members” under the Alaska domestic violence laws: 

(1) Adults or minor children who are one or more of these: 

live together or have lived together in the past  

•  current or former spouses  
• 
•  are in a dating or sexual relationship (or have been in the past) 
•  are related by blood or adoption up to the “fourth degree of consanguinity”  
•  are related or formerly related by marriage 
•  have a child together 

(2) Minor children of a person in any of the relationships in section (1). 

ist of crimes that qualify for a domestic violence protective order: 

Assault is when one person physically injures another person, or when one person threatens to 
physically injure another person and could immediately carry out the threat.  If there was a 
threat, you may be able to get a protective order even if the respondent did not physically 
injure you.   

Burglary is when someone enters or remains unlawfully in a building planning to commit a 
crime in the building. 

Criminal mischief is when one person purposefully damages another person’s property.  
Criminal mischief may still occur if the person jointly owns the property that was damaged. 

Criminal trespass is when someone enters or remains unlawfully on land, in a home, or in a 
vehicle. 

Cruelty to pet is when someone knowingly kills or injures an animal that is a pet, with the 
intent to intimidate, threaten, or terrorize another person.   

Custodial interference is when a family member takes and keeps a child without any legal 
right to do so, and the person intends to keep the child from the lawful guardian for an 
extended period of time.  An example is a parent who takes a child out of state to keep the 
child away from the other parent for a long time, with no legal right to do so.  It is not 
custodial interference when a parent fails to return the child at the agreed-upon time. 

Extortion and coercion are crimes that are commonly called “blackmail.”  They involve 
someone causing or threatening physical injury or other types of harm to get another person’s 
property, or to make another person do something they do not want to do.  An example is 
someone threatening to post something embarrassing about you on the internet unless you 
give the person money.

Harassment is when someone, with the intent to harass or annoy another person: 

•  calls on the phone and will not hang up, so that the other person cannot make or 

receive calls; or 

•  makes repeated telephone calls at extremely inconvenient hours; or 
•  makes a call or electronic communication that is anonymous or obscene, or that 

threatens physical injury or sexual contact; or 

•  publishes or distributes photos, pictures, or videos that show the other person’s genitals, 

anus, or female breast, or that show the other person doing a sexual act. 

Kidnapping is when a person holds another person against that person’s will.  Usually, it also 
means the person is planning to physically or sexually assault the other person, creates a 
significant risk that the other person will be seriously injured, or conceals the other person so 
that there is a significant risk that the other person will not be found. 

Reckless endangerment is when a person’s actions create a high risk of serious physical 
injury to another person.  An example is when you are driving down the highway and the 
passenger grabs the steering wheel, trying to force you off the road and making it likely that 
you will get in a serious car accident. 

Robbery is when a person uses force, or threatens to use force, to take money or property 
from another person.  The money or property must be physically on or very near the other 
person when the force is used or the threat is made. 

Sexual crimes include all forms of sexual assault, sexual abuse of a minor, incest, and 
indecent exposure.  Sexual assault can occur even if the parties are married.  For purposes of a 
domestic violence protective order, crimes involving making or showing pornography are not 
included as domestic violence crimes.   

Stalking is when someone repeatedly contacts another person without that person’s consent, 
and the contacts would reasonably make the other person afraid of physical injury or death. 

Terroristic threatening is when someone claims that a life-threatening situation exists that 
places another person in fear of physical injury.  An example is calling you on the phone and 
threatening to shoot you when you leave the house.  It is also a crime if the threat causes 
evacuation of a building or similar serious inconvenience to a group of people. 

Violating a protective order is when a person does something that the person was 
prohibited from doing by a domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault protective order. 
 

What if the crime committed against me or my minor child is not listed above? 

If the crime committed is not listed above, then you will need to seek relief another way.  The 
following are not considered domestic violence crimes for purposes of getting a protective 
order: 

•  Theft 
•  Forgery 
•  Drug or alcohol abuse 
•  Child neglect 
•  Violation of court orders (except protective orders), including custody, visitation, and 

support orders 

•  Slander 
•  Threats to file a lawsuit or make reports to the police or other government agencies
