“THUNDERBIRD - KILLER WHALE”  
TOTEM POLE 
By Leo Jacobs, Sr.; Edwin Kasko; 
Clifford Thomas; and John Hagen 

This  is  a  two-figure  totem  pole  representing  the  two 
mythological  beings  who  guided  the  ancestors  of  the 
present  Tlingit  Indians  to  Alaska  from  their  homeland  in 
Hokkaido. 

This  migration  is  believed  to  have  occurred  about  5,000 
years  ago  after  the  disappearance  of  the  land  bridge  that 
once connected Alaska with Siberia. 

The people departed from Hokkaido in their great canoes 
and  were  guided  across  the  ocean  by  the  Black  Eagle 
which  flew  before  them  making  lightning  with  his  wings. 
This  also  caused  thunder,  for  which  he  was  called  the 
“Thunderbird.”    But,  as  days  went  by,  fog  closed  in  and 
the people could no longer see the Thunderbird and they 
became lost. 

Finally,  a  killer  whale  appeared  with  the  mystic  figure  of 
Gunara  riding  on  its  back.    Gunara  told  the  people  to 
follow  the  killer  whale,  which  led  them  to  the  Stikine 
Valley  near 
in 
Southeastern Alaska.

THE GREAT SEAL OF THE 
STATE OF ALASKA 

In  1884,  Congress  provided  for  a  civil  govern-
ment for Alaska,  and the first governor, “on his own 
motion,”  designed  and  had  a  seal  made  for  the 
District  of  Alaska.    The  seal  highlighted  Alaska’s 
icebergs, northern lights, and native people.  In 1910, 
Governor Walter E. Clark had a draftsman in Juneau 
draw a rough draft of a new seal, which incorporated 
the  original  features,  plus  symbols  for  mining, 
agriculture,  fisheries,  fur  seal  rookeries,  and  a 
railroad. 

The  design  was  approved  by  the  Acting  Attorney 
General  of  the  United  States.    A  “more  refined” 
drawing  was  made  by  an  unknown  person  in  the 
Department  of  the  Interior,  and  the  new  seal  was 
ready for use early in 1911. 

in  1912, 

After  Alaska  was  changed  from  a  District  to  a 
Territory 
the  new  designation  was 
substituted  on  the  seal.    The  Constitution  for  the 
State of Alaska provides that the Territorial Seal shall 
be  the  Seal  for  the  State  of  Alaska,  with  the  word 
“Territory” changed to “State.” 

At the time it was cast in 1973, it was the largest cast 
seal in the United States.

CEREMONIAL DANCE WALL 
PANEL 
By Larry Ahvakana 

This  sculpture  of  three  welded  steel  figures 
reflects  the  ageless  ceremonial  dance  of  the 
Utqiagvik Eskimos.   The dancing masks  are 
styled from 19th-century masks.  The dress of 
the  figures  is  contemporary.    The  back-
ground is acrylic paint on canvas, suggesting 
the  skyline  above  the  arctic  tundra.    It  also 
includes  an  etching  designed  from  Eskimo 
prehistoric art objects. 

Location:  Main Lobby 

 

WALL PANEL 
By Alaska Indian Arts, Inc. 

This Tlingit-designed, hand-carved, and painted-wood panel is derived 
from a Ceremonial House of a Raven Chief.  It is a split design of the 
Raven,  as  though  the  Raven  were  split  in  half  and  laid  flat.    The 
Raven’s eyes, body, and joint of the tail are faces.  The wings and the  
feet are eyes.

This 
short 
in  vertical 
individual  planks 
alignment  to  characterize  the  interior 
wall planking of an Eskimo sod house. 
The  notches  on  the  surface  form 
designs  that  are  stylized  versions  of 
19th-century  engravings  on  walrus  
ivory. 

The  placement  of  motifs  is  asym-
metrical, unrelated in size to  any other 
motif,  and  some  are  upside-down,  to 
follow  characteristics  of  prehistoric 
art.   Very subtle stains were  applied in 
the  notches,  using  conventional  colors 
seen on 19th-century dance masks.

Under the Eagle Crest 

1.  Grizzly bear: brave and of great strength. 
2.  Wolf (a sub-clan): great cunning and wisdom, 
known to have led the Tlingit people to a high 
mountain during the 40-day flood of the 
world. 

3.  Killer Whale: the tail is turned up and held in the 
mouth; the “grizzly bear of the sea” guided the 
ancestors from their homeland on the Japanese 
island of Hokkaido to a place now known as 
Wrangell. 

4.  Sometimes can be the sun, sometimes the moon. 
The Raven placed this in the skies for the benefit 
of all mankind.

CERAMIC TILES 
“Treaty of Cession” (1867) 

Prior to demolishing the original courthouse located  at 845 W. Fourth Avenue, the three ceramic mosaics were removed and restored by 
Dave  and  Rich  Welsh  of  W  &  W  Company  of  Alaska.  The  restoration  project  took  250  hours  to  complete.  The  original  design was 
conceived by Buell Nesbett, the court’s first Chief Justice. 

Scenes of native whale hunting, the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867, and statehood commemorate Alaska’s past.  The Venetian 
glass tiles were designed by Armond Kirschbaum and produced by Alaska Art Tile in 1963.

By Ronald W. Senungetuk 

The handles are made of rosewood and fossilized walrus ivory. 

DOOR PANELS 
By James Schrock 

The two 2’ x 6-1/3’ panels are made of joined 1’’ x 12” mahogany planks from Honduras.  The motifs intaglio form a genre 
composition that  is derived from 19th-century Eskimo  graphic art on ivory and wood objects.   Part of the composition is 
free interpretation of Northwest Coast Indian art and Athabascan graphic motifs on moose-hide garments.

STATE SEAL 
By Alaska Indian Arts, Inc. 

This  10-foot  hand-carved  seal  of  the  State  of  Alaska  was  developed 
under the  direction of  Carl  W.  Heinmiller,  the  founder of  Alaska  Indian 
Arts, Inc., located in Haines,  Alaska.  The  seal consists of  four  pieces of 
6-foot red cedar held together with three 10-inch bolts.

“ALASKA SKIES” 
by Suzanne Donazetti 

This series of seven copper tapestries depicts the interaction of the colors of  the Alaskan landscape and Alaska’s unique light 
conditions.  The artist created a complex abstract design flowing across the wall with gentle, harmonious curves.  It was intended 
to provide a visual focal point for the justices as they contemplate weighty matters brought before the court.   The artist used 
sheet copper—“painted” with gold leaf, transparent inks, and powders—to weave a design that enhances the experience, while 
honoring the serious nature of the business conducted within the room.

EAGLE CHIEF’S PANEL 
By Alaska Indian Arts, Inc. 

Ceremonial  tribal  houses  used  these  panels  on  the  four 
support posts that held up the main roof.  This panel or 
house post is from an Eagle Chief’s house. 

From top to bottom: 

1. Eagle: denotes the clan. 

2. Brown Bear: his great size and strength are a 

symbol of Alaska and its strength and 
greatness. 

3. Sea Bear or Wasco: mythical creature—half-
whale, half-bear—holding a halibut in his 
mouth.  He brought the halibut from the sea 
for the Tlingit people, as before that time they had 
only fished the rivers for salmon.

“GRIZZLY SOW WITH CUB” 
By Mike Sirl 

 

 

 

This  sculpture,  fabricated  from  Corten  steel,  celebrates  the  essence  of  family,  love,  and  protection.    The  artist  states  that  it 
examines  the  complexity  and  paradox  of  “man  in  nature”  and  is  an  example  of  hand-crafted  art  in  an  impersonal,  high-tech 
world.  The life-size animals are not sited on a traditional base, but in a landscape setting.  The bears invite touching, learning, 
conversation, and photography.
