      <pre>GUARDIANSHIP OF A MINOR 

INSTRUCTIONS 
FOR ACCEPTING AN APPOINTMENT MADE IN A WILL 
 
Introduction 

n a parent’s will, the parent may appoint a guardian for an unmarried minor child. This is called 
a “testamentary” appointment.   In order for this  appointment to become effective, the guardian 
must file an “acceptance” with the court as described in these instructions. 
 

Lawyers 

efore  starting  this  process,  it  may  help  to  talk  to  a  lawyer  who  is  familiar  with  guardianship 
procedure.  If you are unsure about whether you should hire a lawyer, it is a good idea to talk to 
one about  your case before you decide whether you can handle it alone.  If you do not know a 
lawyer, you can call or write: 
 

Lawyer Referral Service of the Alaska Bar Association 
P.O. Box 100279, Anchorage, AK  99510-0279 
Phone: 272-0352 or 800-770-9999 outside Anchorage (toll free within Alaska) 

Indian Children 
 
If the child is an “Indian child” (see definition below), you should talk to a lawyer about whether 
the federal Indian Child Welfare Act1 requires you to give notice of this proceeding to additional 
people  and  whether  those  additional  people  have  a  right  to  intervene  in  the  matter.    Note  that 
“Indian  child”  includes  children  who  are  members  of  an  Alaska  Native  village  or  eligible  for 
membership  in  a  village  as  well  as  children  who  are  members  or  eligible  for  membership  in 
Indian tribes outside Alaska. 
 

Definitions of Some Terms Used in These Instructions2 

ndian child: 

Any unmarried person who is under the  age of 18 and  who is either (a) a 
member  of  an  Indian  tribe,  or  (b)  is  eligible  for  membership  in  an  Indian 
tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe.3  

Indian tribe:  

 

Any  Indian tribe, band,  nation, or other organized group or  community of 
Indians  recognized  as  eligible  for  the  services  provided  to  Indians  by  the 
Secretary [of the Interior] because of their status as Indians, including any 
Alaska Native village as defined in section 1602(c) of Title 43.4  

                                                
1  25  U.S.C.  §  1901  –  1923.    The  Indian  Child  Welfare  Act  (ICWA)  is  a  federal  law  which 
establishes special procedures that must be followed whenever the placement of an Indian child 
is being decided.  For more information about this, see page 3 of the PG-605 instructions.

If  you  are  accepting  guardianship  of  more  than  one  child,  fill  out  a  separate 
Acceptance for each child. 

If two people (for example, a husband and wife) are appointed as guardian, you can 
both  fill  out  and  sign  the  same  Acceptance  form.    Be  sure  to  change  “I”  to  “We” 
throughout the form. 

Fill in the top of the form as shown in the following illustration: 

IN THE SUPERIOR COURT FOR THE STATE OF ALASKA 

AT  City Where Court is Located 

Court  Location.    At  the  top  of  the  form,  fill  in  the  location  (city)  where  the 
parent’s  will  was  filed  for  probate.    This  is  the  court  where  your  acceptance 
must be filed.   

Case No.  Leave this line blank.  The court will assign a new case number. 

Estate Case No.  Fill in the case number the court assigned when the will was 
filed for probate. 

In paragraph 6, check the box indicating whether both parents are deceased or 
just  one  parent  is  deceased.    If  one  parent  is  still  alive,  the  appointment  of  a 
guardian in the deceased parent’s will does not take effect unless there is a court 
order stating that the living parent is incapacitated6 or that his/her parental rights 
have been terminated.

  I

Paragraph  7  of  the  Acceptance  form  requires  you  to  read  Alaska  Statute 
13.26.167 about the duties and powers of a guardian of a minor.  This statute is 
printed on page 8. 

Signature.  Sign and date the Acceptance.  You will also need to complete the 
“Verification” section that follows your signature.  You must do this in front 
of a notary public.  A court clerk can provide this notary service for you (at no 
charge) if you bring the Acceptance to court.  You must bring a photo ID with 
you for the notarization. 

Certificate  of  Service.    See  Step  2  below  about  how  to  fill  out  this  section.  
You must send a copy of your Acceptance to everyone to whom you send the 
notice of your appointment. 

Step 2. 

 
Fill in all the lines on the attached Notice to Minor Ward of Guardian’s Appointment 
and Minor’s Right to Object (PG-653) and sign it.   

Fill  out  the  “Certificate  of  Service”  section  at  the  bottom  of  the  Notice,  showing 
when, how and to whom you are going to send the Notice. You must send it to:  
a. 
b. 

the child, and  
either 
(1) 
(2) 

the person who takes care of the child, or 
the child’s nearest adult relation. 

tep 3. 

If  the  child  is  age  14  or  older,  also  fill  out  the  top  of  the  Minor’s  Objection  to 
Appointment of Testamentary Guardian form (PG-654, attached).  Fill in the location 
of the court, the child’s name and the case number. Leave the rest blank. 
 

 
Step 4.  Make copies of the Acceptance form and the Notice form for yourself and for each of 
the people to whom you are required to send the Notice.  (You will file the original of 
both  forms  with  the  court.)    If  the  child  is  age  14  or  older,  also  make  a  copy  for 
yourself of the Minor’s Objection form that you prepared in Step 3.  (The original is 
for the child to use.)   
 

Step 5.  Mail or personally deliver7 copies of the Notice and the Acceptance to: 

the child (along with a Minor’s Objection form if the child is 14 or older), and  
either 
(1) 
(2) 

the person who takes care of the child, or 
the child’s nearest adult relation. 

roof That Notice Was Given.  After you send the Notice to everyone, you must file 
proof with the court that this has been done.  Your proof is the original  Notice form 
with your completed “certificate of service” at the bottom and your original signature 
at the bottom of the certificate.

page 7.)       You can deliver these documents to the court in person or by mail.  There 
is no filing fee. 

Note:  If the will was  filed for probate in  another state,  you must follow that state’s 
procedures for accepting the appointment. 

tep 7. 

If an Objection is Filed.   

If  the  child  is  age  14  or  older,  the  child  may  file  a  written  objection  with  the  court 
opposing  your  appointment  as  guardian.    The  child  must  file  the  objection  within  30 
days after the child receives notice of  your acceptance of the appointment.  The child 
should also send you a copy of the objection. 
 
If the child  files an objection, the court will schedule a hearing on the  matter.  The 
court clerk will notify you of the time and place of your hearing and the name of the 
judge or master who will preside. 

After you file your acceptance of the appointment, the court will issue a document called 
“Letters of Guardianship of a Minor” (form PG-635).  You can get certified copies of 
this document from the court and use them if you need to prove to someone that you are 
the child’s guardian (for example, schools, hospitals, government agencies, etc.) 

uring the proceeding, the judge can appoint an attorney to represent the child if the 

judge determines that the child’s interests are or may be inadequately represented.9

Termination of Guardianship 

  A

 

 

The guardianship will end when the child turns age 18 unless it is terminated earlier by court 
order.12    A  guardian  cannot  simply  stop  performing  the  guardian’s  duties  without  court 
permission  before  the  child  turns  18.    If  something  happens  that  leads  the  guardian  to 
believe  the  guardianship should  end,  the  guardian  must  first  file  a  request  with  the  court.  
Form PG-190, described in paragraph “B” above, can be used for this.  

The Alaska Statute concerning termination of appointment of guardians states: 

“A  guardian's  authority  and  responsibility  terminate  upon  the  death, 
resignation,  or  removal  of  the  guardian  or  upon  the  minor's  death, 
adoption,  marriage,  or  attainment  of  majority,  but  termination  does  not 
affect  the  guardian's  liability  for  prior  acts,  nor  the  obligation  to  account 
for  funds  and  assets  of  the  ward.  Resignation  of  a  guardian  does  not 
terminate  the  guardianship  until  it  has  been  approved  by  the  court.  A 
testamentary appointment under an informally probated will terminates if 
the will is later denied probate in a formal proceeding.” AS 13.26.171.

Alaska Statute 13.26.167 
Powers and Duties of Guardian of a Minor 

 guardian of a minor has the powers and responsibilities of a parent who has not 
been  deprived  of  custody  of  a  minor  and  unemancipated  child,  except  that  a 
guardian is not legally obligated to provide from the guardian's own funds for the 
ward and is  not  liable to third persons by  reason of the parental relationship  for 
acts of the ward. In particular, and without qualifying the foregoing, a guardian: 

must  take  reasonable  care  of  the  ward's  personal  effects  and  commence 
protective proceedings if necessary to protect other property of the ward; 

may  receive  money  payable  for  the  support  of  the  ward  to  the  ward's 
parent,  guardian  or  custodian  under  the  terms  of  any  statutory  benefit  or 
insurance system, or any private contract, devise, trust, conservatorship or 
custodianship;  the  guardian  also  may  receive  money  or  property  of  the 
ward paid  or delivered by  virtue of  AS  13.26.031;  any  sums so received 
shall  be  applied  to  the  ward's  current  needs  for  support,  care  and 
education; the guardian must exercise due care to conserve any excess for 
the  ward's  future  needs  unless  a  conservator  has  been  appointed  for  the 
estate of the ward, in which case excess shall be paid over at least annually 
to the conservator; sums so received by the guardian may not be used for 
compensation  for  the  guardian's  services  except  as  approved  by  order  of 
court  or  as  determined  by  a  duly  appointed  conservator  other  than  the 
guardian; a guardian may institute proceedings to compel the performance 
by any person of a duty to support the ward or to pay sums for the welfare 
of the ward; 

may facilitate the ward's education, social, or other activities and authorize 
medical or other professional care, treatment, or advice; a guardian is not 
liable  by  reason  of  this  consent  for  injury  to  the  ward  resulting  from  the

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
