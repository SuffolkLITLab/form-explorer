Your  call  to  jury  service  is  a  call  to  a  most  important  task.    If  you  are 
selected  to  be  a  juror,  you  will  be  asked  to  hear  evidence  presented  at  a 
trial,  decide  the  facts,  apply  to  the  facts  the  law  explained  to  you  by  the 
judge, and return a verdict.  The case you hear may be a criminal case, civil 
case, or a coroner matter. 

  criminal  case  is  an  action  in  which  a  defendant  is  accused  by  the 

government (the state or a city) of having committed a crime. 

 civil case is an action to enforce private rights.  It is a lawsuit involving 
either (a) one private party suing another private party, or (b) a private party 
suing or being sued by the government (other than in a criminal case).  The 
controversy could be about property rights, claims for damages, or matters 
generally dealing with money. 

here  are  two  types  of  coroner  matters:  inquests  and  presumptive  death 
hearings.  Inquests determine the cause and manner of a person's death (for 
example, homicide, suicide, accident, etc.).   Presumptive death hearings 
determine  if  a  missing  person  should  be  declared  dead.    These  coroner 
hearings  are  not  trials.    Therefore,  the  jury  selection  and  trial  procedures 
described in this handbook do not apply to coroner hearings. 

s  a  juror,  you  are  providing  an  important  public  service.    You  are  also 
helping to uphold an essential part of the American system of justice — the 
right to a trial by a jury made up of persons representing a fair cross section 
of  the  community.    The  right  to  trial  by  jury  is  guaranteed  by  both  the 
United States Constitution and the Alaska Constitution. 

ou do not need any special skills or knowledge to be a juror, but you do 

need to be fair, impartial, and willing to keep an open mind.

INTRODUCTION 

   

J-180 (7/22) 

ow was I chosen for jury service? 

otential  jurors  are  selected  randomly  by  a  computer  from  the  list  of  all 
adults  (18  years  of  age  and  older)  who  apply  for  the  Alaska  Permanent 
Fund Dividend. 

o I have to respond to the summons? 

es.  The summons to jury service is an official court summons.  If you do 

not respond, you could be held in contempt of court. 

hat is the purpose of the Jury Questionnaire? 

he information you provide on the questionnaire helps the court determine 
whether you qualify to serve as a juror.  The Alaska Statutes require jurors 
to be 
(1) 
(2) 
(3) 
(4) 
(5) 

citizens of the United States; 
residents of Alaska; 
at least 18 years of age; 
of sound mind; 
in  possession  of  their  natural  faculties  (normal  abilities  to  reason); 
and 
able to read or speak the English language.

PART I:GENERALINFORMATIONIn addition, a person is disqualified from serving as a juror if the person 
has been convicted of a felony and has not been unconditionally discharged 
for that offense (meaning the person is still in jail, on electronic monitoring, 
or on parole or probation for the offense). 

he  questionnaire  also  gives  you  an  opportunity  to  request  that  your  jury 

duty be postponed as explained later in this handbook. 

f  I  have  difficulty  hearing  or  seeing  or  have  another  disability, will  I 
be disqualified from jury service? 

o.   A person is not disqualified from serving as a juror solely because of 
the  loss  of  hearing  or  sight  in  any  degree  or  a  disability  that  substantially 
impairs  or  interferes  with  the  person's  mobility.    The  court  is  required  to 
provide  an  interpreter  or  reader  when  necessary  to  enable  a  person  with 
impaired  hearing  or  sight  to  act  as  a  juror.    The  court  is  also  required  to 
make its facilities accessible  to  persons  with  disabilities.  If you need 
any  assistance  because  of  a  disability,  you  should  immediately  notify  the 
jury clerk. 

f  jury  service  would  be  a  significant  hardship  because  of  your  disability, 
you can ask to be temporarily or permanently  excused as explained in the 
paragraphs below. 

an I postpone my jury service? 

t depends on which court you are doing jury service in.  If you are serving 
in a court that has service terms of one year, then you cannot postpone. 

f you are in a court with multiple terms of jury service during the year, and 
if jury service at the time for which you are summoned will cause hardship, 
you  may  request  deferral  of  service  to  another  time  within  the  next  ten 
months.    If  you  need  a  deferral,  ask  for  one  as  soon  as  possible.    Do  not 
wait  until  the  time  you  are  scheduled  to  appear.    To  reschedule  your  jury 
service, select a new term of service when asked if you wish to reschedule 
your  service  on  the  Jury  Questionnaire.    If  you  have  already  sent  in  your 
questionnaire, call the jury clerk as soon as possible for instructions.

an I be temporarily excused from jury service? 

he  Alaska  Statutes  and  court  rules  allow  the  following  persons  to  be 

temporarily excused from jury service: 

judicial officers; 

persons who can show that their health, the health or proper care of 
their family, a physical or mental disability, or other hardship makes 
it necessary for them to be excused; and 

teachers  in  a  school  that  is  designated  as  a  low  performing  school 
under regulations adopted by the state Board of Education and Early 
Development.    “Teacher”  means  a  person  who  serves  a  school 
district in a teaching capacity in a classroom setting and is required 
to  be  certificated  in  order  to  hold  the  position.    These  teachers  are 
only excused from jury service during the school term. 

o request a temporary excusal, you must write your request and reason on 
the Jury Questionnaire, in the Comments section.  If you have already sent 
in your questionnaire, call the jury clerk as soon as possible. 

f  your  request  is  granted,  you  will  be  excused  from  service  for  one  year 
(except  the  teachers  described  above,  who  are  only  excused  during  the 
school term).  However, you may be summoned for another term of service 
in the future.  To be permanently excused, see the next question. 

an I be permanently excused from jury service? 

he court rules provide that you may be permanently excused from all jury 

service if you: 
(1) 

are 70 years of age or older and request in writing to be permanently 
excused; or 
have  a  permanent  medical  reason  you  are  unable  to  serve  and 
provide written verification as described below.

To request a permanent excusal if you are 70 years of age or older, answer 
“yes” to the permanent excuse question on the Jury Questionnaire. 

o request a permanent excusal if you have a permanent physical or mental 

disability, you must 

answer “yes” to the question “I have a mental or physical reason that 
prevents me from serving”; 
explain  in  the  comments  section  of  the  questionnaire  that  you  are 
requesting a permanent excusal; and    
provide in writing, on business stationary or a prescription pad from 
a  medical  professional  (licensed  physician,  psychologist,  nurse 
practitioner,  physician's  assistant,  or  chiropractor),  that  you  are 
permanently unable to serve as a juror for medical reasons. 
 

If  you  are  permanently  excused,  you  should  not  receive  any  further  jury 
summonses. 

hat about my job? 

our  employer  cannot  fire,  demote,  or  otherwise  penalize  you  for 
missing  work  while  performing  jury  service.    Some  employers  will 
continue to pay your salary while you are in jury service even though they 
are  not  required  to  do  so.    Contact  your  employer  to  find  out  what  the 
policy is at your job. 

hat if my employer wants proof of my jury service? 

sk the jury clerk for a Certificate of Jury Attendance either at the end of 
each  day  of  trial  or  at  the  completion  of  the  trial.    The  certificate  will 
indicate the dates and times you served.

ill I be paid for jury service? 

ou will be paid $50 per day, starting with the second day you report to the 
courthouse during your period of jury service.  There is no payment for the 
first day you are summoned to the courthouse. 

xception: State employees are not paid for jury service (unless they serve 

on days that they are not scheduled to work for the state). 

ou  will  also  be  reimbursed  for  mileage  (at  the  rate  paid  to  state 
employees) if you live more than 30 miles from the court.  If you must fly 
or use the Marine Highway System, the court will make those arrangements 
for you. 

hen will I get paid? 

ury pay is processed twice  each  month.  The first pay period is the 1st to 
the 15th and the second is the 16th through the end of each month.  You can 
expect to receive your check about 15 days after the end of the pay period 
in which you served.  If you serve during two pay periods, you will receive 
two checks.  If you have not received  your check within 15 days after the 
end of your pay period, please contact the jury clerk. 

f my check is lost, can it be reissued? 

f  the  check  is  less  than  six  months  old,  contact  the  Administrative  Jury 
Office in Anchorage at (907) 264-8268.   The clerk will be able to re-issue 
the check for you. 

f the check is more than six months old, the court system cannot re-issue it, 
and if you find it, you will not be able to cash it.  After six months, the funds 
are automatically transferred to the State’s Unclaimed Property Division.  To 
request payment, call (907) 465-3726 or e-mail ucproperty@alaska.gov.

oes the court pay for meals for jurors? 

he court does not pay for juror meals during the jury selection process or 
during  the  trial  (unless  the  jury  is  sequestered).    However,  the  court  does 
pay for juror  meals  while  the  jury  is  deliberating (that is, after all the 
evidence has been presented and the judge has referred the case to the jury 
for decision). 

oes the court provide parking? 

ree parking is available at most courts.  If parking is an issue, there will be 
instructions  about  it  on  your  service  reminder  notice  and  on  the  Jury 
Services  website:  https://courts.alaska.gov/jury/ 
the  Parking 
Information & Contacts link). 

(under 

ow long must I serve? 

he time period during which you must be available to serve (called your 
"term  of  service")  depends  on  the  size  of  the  court  location  where  you 
serve.    During  your  term  of  service,  you  may  have  to  call  in  or  report  to 
court  periodically.    You  may  not  have  to  call  in  every  day,  but  you  must 
call on the days you are directed to do so. 

n Anchorage, where the population is large and many trials are held each 
day, the term of service is either 5 consecutive days or, if you are selected 
to serve on a jury, the length of the trial. 

he  term  of  service  in  other  court  locations  depends  on  the  population  in 

the area and can range from one week to a full year.

fter I complete my term of service, will I get a break from future jury 

service? 

es, but only if you had to appear in court during your term of service. 

nce  your  term  of  service  is  complete,  you  cannot  be  required  to  serve 
again for at least one year after your last day of actual court appearance (or 
two years after that date in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Palmer). 

ou will not get the one year off if you 

(1) 
(2) 
(3) 

called in, but did not have to come to court; 
never appeared in court, even though directed to appear; or 
came  to  court  when  you  were  not  instructed  to  do  so,  and  your 
service was not needed. 

hat if an emergency keeps me from coming to court? 

t is very important that all jurors report each day they are told to report and 
that  they  be  on  time.    Your  absence  may  delay  a  trial.    If  you  have  an 
emergency (such as a sudden illness or a death in the family), call the jury 
clerk immediately. 

hat hours will I serve? 

ou  should  report  to  the  court  at  the  date  and  time  shown  on  your  jury 
summons or as instructed when you call in.  At that time, you will be told 
the procedure for reporting to the court for the rest of the term.   

nce you are sent to a courtroom for jury selection, the judge will explain 
the  anticipated  schedule  for  that  trial.    On  occasion,  a  trial  will  continue 
beyond the court’s normal working hours.  If this happens, you may need to 
arrange your schedule to allow you to stay longer.

ill I be sequestered (not allowed to go home)? 

robably not.  Usually, jurors go home at the end of the day and return the 
next  morning.    However,  in  extremely  rare  cases,  a  jury  will  be 
sequestered during the trial or during deliberations. 

Sequestered”  means  that  instead  of  going  home  at  the  end  of  the  day, 
jurors  stay  in  a  hotel,  where  their  access  to  other  people  and  to  television 
news  and  newspapers  is  limited.    This  is  done  to  keep  them  from 
accidentally  hearing  something  about  the  trial  that  was  not  presented  in 
court,  or  from  being  influenced  by  news  reports.    This  is  important 
because  juries  must  reach  their  decisions  based  only  on  what  they  have 
heard in the courtroom during the trial. 

n almost all Alaska jury trials, however, the jury goes home at the end of 
each day and is  ordered by  the judge  not to  discuss the case with anyone, 
nor  to  watch,  read,  or  listen  to  news  reports  about  the  case.    The  law 
requires you to follow these instructions. 

s it true that jurors spend a lot of time waiting? 

es.    You  usually  will  have  to  wait  a  while  before  the  jury  selection 
process begins.  In addition, if you are selected to serve on a jury, the jury 
will be sent to the jury room whenever the judge and attorneys discuss legal 
issues that the jury is not allowed to hear. 

an I bring things to do while I wait? 

es.  Bring a book or other quiet activity, solve a crossword puzzle, write a 
letter, sketch a picture, or get to know your fellow jurors.  Of course, when 
the court is in session, you should not talk, read, or do other activities.  You 
need to devote your full attention to what is happening in the court.

Remember that as a juror you are a vital part of the justice system.  Part of 
the  job  of  many  court  employees,  such  as  the  bailiffs  and  the  clerks,  is  to 
help make your jury service comfortable and convenient.  Do not be afraid 
to ask them for help.   

an I bring my cell phone or other electronic device (laptop computer, 

tablet, etc.) to court when I am on jury duty? 

es.  However, you must turn off all such devices whenever you are in the 
courtroom or the jury deliberation room.  You must not use these devices at 
any  time  to  communicate  with  anyone  about  the  trial  or  to  investigate 
information about the trial.  Jurors must decide the case based solely on the 
evidence  presented  in  the  courtroom.    Jurors  must  not  conduct  any 
independent research about the case or the people involved in the case. 

lso, court personnel may collect these items and hold them for you when 

jury deliberation begins. 

re there things I should not bring to court? 

or security reasons, weapons of any kind are not permitted in 

courthouses.  Some examples of things you should not bring to court are: 
firearms or anything resembling a firearm; knives of any size or other sharp 
objects; chemical agents such as mace, bear spray, and other forms of 
pepper spray; ammunition; or explosives. For a complete listing of 
prohibited items, see the Alaska Court System Prohibited Items List at 
https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/adbulls/docs/ab85.pdf.  

dditionally, childcare is not available at the court.  Please do not bring 

children with you when you appear for jury service.

Jurors play an essential role in the trial of civil and criminal cases.  Although 
many people do not know what to expect from jury service, most look back upon it 
as a rewarding experience.  Jury service is a tangible, challenging, and 
indispensable contribution to our country.

f I report for jury duty, will I sit on a jury? 

ou may or may not sit on a jury.  The parties involved in a case generally 
seek  to  settle  their  differences  and  avoid  the  expense  and  time  of  a  trial.  
Sometimes, the case is settled just a few moments before the trial begins.  So 
even though several trials are scheduled for a certain day, the court does not 
know until that morning how many will actually go to trial.  But  your time 
spent  waiting is not wasted —  your very presence in the court encourages 
settlement. 

ow are jurors chosen to sit on a jury? 
 

There are several methods a judge may use to select a jury.  The following 
paragraphs describe the most common methods. 

hen a trial is ready to begin, a group of potential jurors will be called into 
the  courtroom.    The  clerk  will  ask  the  potential  jurors  to  swear  or  affirm 
that they will truthfully answer the questions about to be asked of them.   

Trials begin  with jury selection.  Names are randomly selected from those on jury 
service to form a panel from which the trial jury will be selected.  The judge excuses 
those on the panel whose knowledge of the people or the circumstances would affect 
their impartiality.

PART II:SELECTING JURIESFOR TRIALSYou will be told the names of the parties and their attorneys and the nature 
of  the  case.    You  will  be  asked  such  things  as  whether  you  know  or  are 
related to anyone involved in the case, have any financial  or  other interest 
in the outcome  of the  case, have formed or expressed an opinion, or have 
any personal bias or prejudice that might affect how you decide the case. 

epending  on  your  court  location,  one  of  two  methods  will  be  used  to 

select the first group of potential jurors to take seats in the jury box:  

Method #1: The names of all potential jurors will be placed on slips of 
paper  in  a  small  box.    The  clerk  will  then  draw  a  certain  number  of 
names from the box and ask those persons to take seats in the jury box.  
Method #2: A computer will produce a list of potential jurors in random 
order and the clerk will ask the first group of persons on that list to take 
seats in the jury box. 

he  judge  and  the  lawyers  for  each  side  will  ask  you  some  questions.    If 
you are reluctant to answer a particular question in public, you may ask the 
judge to be examined privately on that topic. 

he lawyers will be allowed to ask that certain potential jurors be excused 
“for  cause."    The  lawyer  must  explain  why  the  lawyer  believes  the  juror 
would not be a fair and impartial juror in the case.  The judge may or may 
not  grant  these  requests.    After  all  seated  jurors  have  been  “passed  for 
cause,"  the  lawyers  will  be  allowed  to  “peremptorily  disqualify”  a  certain 
number of jurors (this means to disqualify them without stating the reason 
why).  The number of peremptory disqualifications allowed depends on the 
type of case. 

fter  the  required  number  of  jurors  has  been  accepted,  the  jurors  take  an 
oath  swearing  or  affirming  that  they  will  hear  the  case  and  give  a  verdict 
based  solely  on  the  evidence  introduced  and  the  instructions  of  the  court.  
The trial is then ready to begin. 

   

hy can lawyers ask the judge to excuse potential jurors?  

llowing both sides to participate in selecting the jury gives both of them 
the opportunity to choose jurors that they believe will be fair and impartial.  
Being  excused  from  a  jury  in  no  way  reflects  on  your  character  or  your 
competence  as  a  juror.    The  law  does  not  permit  jurors  to  be  excused 
because of their race, sex, age, or religious background.

hat are alternate jurors? 

uries usually consist of six (6) or twelve (12) jurors, depending on the kind 
of  trial.    Frequently,  one  to  four  (1-4)  additional  jurors  will  be  chosen 
during  jury  selection.    This  is  to  ensure  that  if  one  or  more  jurors  are 
excused during the trial for an emergency, such as illness, there will be an 
adequate number of jurors at the end of the trial to decide the case. 

ome judges will designate which jurors are the "alternates" at the start of 
the  trial.    Other  judges  will  not  designate  which  jurors  are  the  alternates 
until the end of the trial.   

n some cases, the judge may release the alternate jurors at the time the trial 
ends  and  the  jury  begins  deliberations.    In  other  cases,  the  judge  may 
require that one or more alternate jurors remain on “stand-by” while the rest 
of  the  jury  deliberates.    While  the  alternates  are  on  stand-by,  they  do  not 
need to come to court, but must continue to follow the rules about avoiding 
outside information and about not discussing the case.  The judge may keep 
an  alternate  on  stand-by  in  case  a  deliberating  juror  cannot  complete 
deliberations, and the  alternate needs to fill in.  If an  alternate must fill in 
after  deliberations  start,  the  whole  jury  will  start  over  with  deliberations 
that include the alternate juror.  Once the jury reaches a verdict, the judge 
will notify and release any alternate jurors remaining on stand-by. 

Trial by jury – being judged by our fellow citizens – is at the very heart of American 
justice.  For the American citizen, there is no finer contribution to our democratic 
society than serving as a juror.

hat are my responsibilities now that I am part of a jury? 

n any trial, two kinds of questions will have to be decided at various times. 
These  are  questions  of  law  and  questions  of  fact.    The  judge  decides  the 
questions  of  law.    The  jury  decides  the  questions  of  fact.    After  you  and 
your  fellow  jurors  have  decided  the  questions  of  fact,  you  will  apply  the 
law  (as  directed  to  you  by  the  judge)  to  the  facts  that  you  decided.    The 
judge will give you more specific instructions at the end of the trial. 

hat is a “question of law”? 

uestions of law may be about procedural matters (what information can 
be  admitted  as  evidence,  what  kind  of  questions  can  be  asked,  which 
witnesses  can  appear,  and  what  they  can  testify  about).    Or  they  may 
involve substantive law, which creates, defines, and regulates what actions 
or behaviors  are legal, as well as what rights and remedies  exist for those 
who have been harmed by violations of the law. 

hat is a “question of fact”? 

uite  simply,  it  is  deciding  what  really  happened  in  a  case.    Do  not  be 
surprised  if  the  evidence  given  by  both  sides  is  conflicting  or  if  the 
testimony given by one witness contradicts another.  After all, if everyone 
was in agreement about what happened and what should be done about it, 
the dispute probably would not be in court, and a jury probably would not 
be  needed.    Your  job  is  to  listen  to  all  the  testimony,  consider  all  the 
evidence, and decide what you think really happened.

PART III:THE TRIALho else will be in the courtroom?  What will they be doing? 

  number  of  people  will  be  in  the  courtroom  other  than  the  j u d g e   a n d  
t h e   j u r y .    The  list  below  explains  who  they  are  and  what  they  will  be 
doing. 

laintiff.  In a civil case, the person who brought the case to court is called 
the  plaintiff.    In  a  criminal  case,  the  plaintiff  is  the  government  (state  or 
city). 

efendant.  In a civil case, the person being sued is called the defendant.   

In a criminal case, the person charged with a crime is the defendant. 

awyer.    A  lawyer  is  a  person  licensed  to  practice  law.    Other  words  for 
  In  criminal  cases,  the 

"lawyer"  include  "attorney"  or  "counsel." 
government’s lawyer is often called the "prosecutor." 

lerk.    The  clerk  works  for  the  court  and  keeps  the  official  record  by 
operating the audio recorder, which records every word spoken during the 
trial.    The  clerk  also  makes  a  written  log  of  the  recording,  keeps  track  of 
exhibits,  administers  oaths  to  jurors  and  witnesses,  and  performs  many 
other  duties.    The  clerk  is  sometimes  called  the  “in-court  clerk”  or 
“courtroom judicial assistant.” 

ailiff.    In  Alaska,  a  bailiff  is  in  charge  of  the  jury  when  the  jury  begins 
deliberations  or 
is  sequestered.  The  bailiff  makes  sure  no  one 
communicates with the jury during deliberations, acts as a messenger between 
the  jury  and  judge,  and  assists  the  jury  with  phone  calls,  meal 
arrangements, etc. 

itnesses.  Each side in a trial will probably have a number  of witnesses 
who  have  information  about  the  dispute.    Usually,  the  judge  will  ask  any 
witnesses to wait outside the courtroom until it is their turn to testify.  This 
is done so that they will not hear each other’s testimony and be influenced 
by it.

pening  Statements.    After  the  clerk  has  sworn  in  the  jury,  the  case  is 
ready  to  begin.    Both  attorneys  may  make  opening  statements  explaining 
their  clients’  positions  and  outlining  the  evidence  they  expect  to  present 
that will support their claims.  These statements are not evidence, but may 
help the jurors get oriented to the case and know what to expect. 

resentation of  Evidence.  The witnesses for the plaintiff are then called 
and questioned by the attorney for the plaintiff and cross-examined by the 
attorney for the defendant.  After cross-examination, the plaintiff’s attorney 
may  re-examine  some  of  the  witnesses  and  the  defendant’s  attorney  may 
then re-cross-examine them.  After all the plaintiff’s witnesses and evidence 
have  been  presented,  the  plaintiff’s  attorney  will  tell  the  judge  that  “the 
plaintiff rests.” 

he  defendant  may  then  choose  to  call  witnesses.    This  time,  the 
defendant’s  attorney  questions  the  witnesses  first,  then  the  plaintiff’s 
attorney  cross-examines  them,  followed  by  re-direct  and  re-cross-
examination.  When all the defendant’s witnesses and evidence have been 
presented,  the defendant will “rest.”   After the defendant has finished, the 
plaintiff has the option to present rebuttal evidence. 

losing  Arguments.    During  closing  arguments,  the  attorneys  try  to 
persuade  the  jury  about  what  the  evidence  proves  and  why  the  attorney’s 
client should win.  These closing arguments  may  help  jurors recall  details 
of  the  case  or  understand  how  the  various  pieces  of  evidence  fit  together, 
but they are not evidence.  The plaintiff’s attorney speaks first, followed by 
the defendant’s attorney.  Finally, the plaintiff’s attorney has the option to 
speak last and close the case. 

ury Instructions.  The judge may read some jury instructions throughout 
the case, but most of them are read at the end, just before jury deliberations 
begin.

ury instructions tell the jury what laws govern a particular case.  Although 
the  main  body  of  instructions  is  usually  given  at  the  end  of  the  case, 
instructions  may  be  given  at  any  time  during  the  trial.    Some  instructions 
may  be  read  more  than  once.    Regardless  of  when  they  are  given,  jurors 
must accept and follow the law as instructed by the judge.  Even if a juror 
has  a  different  idea  about  what  the  law  is  or  should  be,  all  jurors  take  an 
oath at the beginning of trial to follow the law as instructed.

n  a  civil  case,  the  jury  not  only  decides  on  a  verdict  for  one  side  or  the 
other,  but  also  awards  damages.    “Damages”  are  money  given  to  the 
winning  side  to  compensate  them  for  any  loss  or  injury.    If  the  jury 
determines that an award of money should be made, the jury decides how 
much the award should be. 

ho decides what happens to the defendant in a criminal case? 

he jury decides whether the defendant is “guilty” or “not guilty” on each 
criminal charge.  In Alaska, the judge decides what the sentence (jail time, 
fines,  etc.)  should  be  for  each  “guilty”  verdict.    The  judge  determines  the 
sentence  based  on  minimum/maximum 
terms  and  other  guidelines 
established in law.  Sentencing will happen in a separate court hearing after 
the  jury  is  released  and  may  occur  up  to  several  months  after  trial.    The 
jurors  must  not  consider  or  speculate  on  what  the  sentence  will  be  when 
deciding whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty.

hat are the two types of criminal cases? 

here  are 

two  basic  kinds  of  criminal  offenses: 

felonies  and 
misdemeanors.    A  felony  is  a  crime  where  the  defendant  has  the 
possibility  of  being  sentenced  to  more  than  one  year  in  jail.    A 
misdemeanor is a crime where the maximum sentence is one  year or less 
of jail time. 

hy do the attorneys object to certain statements or evidence? 

n important part of an attorney’s job is to make sure the client gets a fair 
trial.  This includes making sure that the only evidence presented during the 
trial is evidence that is proper, relevant, and allowed by law.  So if evidence 
is submitted that the attorney feels is improper, or if the attorney feels that 
the  other  side  is  asking  questions  that  are  unlawful,  the  attorney  will  call 
out  “Objection”  and  state  the  reason  for  the  objection.    By  doing  this, the 
attorney  is  asking  the  judge  to  determine  whether  the  law  allows  that 
particular piece of evidence or statement or question to be admitted.  If the 
judge determines that the evidence is proper, the judge will say, “Objection 
overruled.”    If  the  judge  determines  that  the  evidence  is  not  proper,  the 
judge  will  say,  “Objection  sustained.”    How  often  an  attorney  raises 
objections during the trial, and how the judge rules on the objections, must 
not bias you against either attorney’s case. 

hy is the jury sometimes asked to leave the courtroom? 

he judge may send the jury out of the courtroom during a trial.  While the 
jury is gone, the attorneys and the judge may discuss points of law, whether 
certain  evidence  can  be  admitted,  or  procedural/scheduling  matters.    The 
purpose  of  these  discussions  is  to  make  sure  that  the  jury  hears  only  the 
evidence that is relevant and legally valid before making its decision.

hy are jurors sometimes told to disregard testimony? 

ometimes the jury hears testimony that they should not have heard.  The 
judge  will  tell  the  jury  to  disregard  the  testimony,  that  is,  to  consider  the 
case as if they had never heard the improper testimony.  You must follow 
the judge’s instructions so that the parties in the case receive a fair trial. 

an I talk to anyone about the trial while it is going on? 

o.    As  long  as  the  trial  is  still  going  on,  do  not  discuss  the  trial  with 
anyone.    Do  not  even  discuss  the  case  with  your  fellow  jurors  until  you 
begin  your  deliberations.    When  the  trial  is  over,  you  can  discuss  it  with 
anyone if you want to, or you may keep silent if you prefer. 

an I watch or read news reports about the trial? 
 

No, not as long as the trial or jury deliberations are still going on. 

hat if I accidentally hear something about the case? 

f  you  hear  something  outside  the  courtroom,  if  someone  contacts  you 
about the trial while it is still going on, or if you realize during the trial that 
you  have  some  special  information  that  relates  to  the  case,  ask  the  clerk  or 
bailiff  to  tell  the  judge  immediately  what  has  happened.    Tell  no  one  else 
about the incident until you receive instructions from the judge.

hat happens after the closing arguments and jury instructions? 

fter  you  hear  the  attorneys’  closing  arguments  and  the  judge  gives  you 
instructions, you will leave the courtroom and go to the jury room to begin 
your  deliberations.    Deliberation  is  the  process  the  jury  uses  to  reach  its 
verdict.  During deliberations, the jury will discuss evidence and review the 
law and the facts to work toward a consensus (or agreement) on the verdict. 

ill anyone be in the jury room besides the jury? 

nly  the  jurors  and  any  interpreter  necessary  to  assist  a  juror  who  is 
hearing- or speech-impaired can be present while the jury is deliberating or 
voting. But, if you have any questions or need any help, the bailiff will be 
nearby to pass your written questions to the judge. 

hat is the first thing we do? 

he  first  thing  you  should  do  is  elect  one  member  of  the  jury  to  be  the 
foreperson.  The foreperson will preside over the deliberations, seeing that 
everyone has an opportunity to participate and that the discussions remain 
orderly.  The foreperson takes part in deliberations and votes on the verdict 
along with everyone else.

PART IV:DECIDING ON AVERDICThat if we do not understand the jury instructions? 

he judge will give the jury a written copy of the jury instructions.  If you 
do not understand the instructions, you may ask the judge to explain them 
to you.  You must put your questions in writing and ask the bailiff to give 
them to the judge.  Before the judge can answer a question, all the parties 
and  attorneys  must  return  to  court  to  discuss  it.    Thus,  it  may  take  some 
time for you to receive an answer. 
 

ow should we conduct our deliberations? 

ach  juror  may  have  a  different  opinion  at  the  start  of  deliberations.    To 
reach  a  verdict,  some  jurors  may  have  to  change  their  opinions.    You 
should  keep  an  open  mind.    Listen  carefully  to  other  jurors’  opinions  and 
the  reasons  for  their  opinions.    You  should  be  prepared  to  tell  the  other 
jurors what you think and why you think it.  Be fair and carefully consider 
what your fellow jurors are saying.  Do not let yourself be intimidated into 
changing  your  opinion,  and  do  not  intimidate  anyone  else.    Change  your 
opinion only if you genuinely agree with what another juror is saying.  
 

an I mention things I know that were not presented in court? 

o.    If  you  believe  you  know  information  about  a  party  in  the  case,  a 
witness,  or  a  subject  brought  up  at  trial,  you  cannot  discuss  it  with  any 
juror,  nor  can  you  personally  consider  it.   You  cannot  discuss  or  consider 
any  information  you  have  unless  the  information  was  also  presented  as 
evidence  at  trial.    Exception:    You  and  the  other  jurors  can  consider 
common information that is generally known by everyone, such as “rain is 
wet” or “the sun provides light.” 
 

an we listen to the recording of the testimony? 

ossibly.    You  can  make  a  written  request  to  the  judge  to  listen  to  the 
recording  of  part  or  all  of  the  testimony  of  any  witness.    The  judge  will 
discuss your request with the parties before deciding whether to grant it.

o we all have to agree on the verdict? 

t depends on the type of trial.  In criminal cases, every juror must agree on 
the  verdict.    In  civil  cases,  unless  otherwise  instructed  by  the  judge,  five-
sixths of the jury must agree on the verdict (5 of 6 or 10 of 12). 

hat should we do after we have reached our verdict? 

he foreperson will write down the jury’s verdict on a form provided by the 
judge, sign it, and notify the bailiff that a verdict has been reached (but not 
what  the  verdict  is).    The  bailiff  will  notify  the  judge,  who  will  call 
everyone, including the jury, back to the courtroom.  The judge will ask for 
the jury’s verdict, and either the judge, the clerk, or the jury foreperson will 
read it out loud.  At this point, the jurors may be  polled—this means they 
will be asked individually in open court if they each agree with the verdict. 

hat is juror counseling? 

or  criminal  cases  with  “extraordinarily  graphic,  gruesome,  or  emotional 
evidence  or  testimony,”  the  judge  has  discretion  to  allow  the  jurors  to 
receive  counseling  paid  for  by  the  court.    There  are  certain  restrictions 
under the law on the type of case and type of counseling that is covered, so 
the  judge  must  first  offer  the  counseling  and  explain  your  options  before 
you  can  expect  to  receive  reimbursement.    If  you  have  questions  about 
whether court-paid counseling is an option for you, you should speak to the 
judge or clerk once you are released from jury service.

PART V:GLOSSARYevidence — Any form of proof legally presented at a trial.  There are two 
main  types  of  evidence:  exhibits  and  testimony  of  witnesses.    The  jury 
decides what the exhibits and testimony prove or don’t prove, and the level 
of importance to attach to a piece of evidence.  Parties may also “stipulate” 
that a fact is true—this means the parties agree on it.  Finally, a judge may 
take “judicial notice” of a fact.  Jurors are required to consider that facts by 
“stipulation”  and  “judicial  notice”  have  been  proven,  but  they  can  still 
decide the relative importance of these facts in relation to other evidence.

presented to the court as evidence during a trial. 

rand jury — A jury  of 12 to 18 persons selected to inquire into alleged

witness is not truthful, accurate, or reliable. 

nadmissible — Testimony or exhibits that cannot be admitted or received 
as evidence under the law.

evidence.
