      <pre>What is mediation? 
Mediation is an informal way to resolve 
disagreements.  A neutral person, the mediator, 
helps those involved: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

determine the important issues, 
explain and understand each other’s proposals, 
clear up misunderstandings, 
explore creative solutions, and 
reach acceptable agreements. 

The mediator does not tell people what to do or 
decide who’s right or wrong.  The participants make 
the decisions.  
Why use mediation? 
People choose mediation for many reasons - some 
of them are: 

•  Mediation can be less confrontational and less 
stressful than arguing at trial in front of a 
judge. 

•  Mediation offers privacy and confidentiality.  
•  Mediation provides a non-adversarial 

environment for making important decisions. 

•  Mediation can save time and money. 

What can be mediated? 
Just about anything can be mediated when people 
are open to exchanging proposals. Some issues that  
  
are well suited for mediation are: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

parenting plans for children, which includes 
parenting time, communication, and making 
decisions about the children; 
property and debt division in divorce cases; 
disputes in small claims cases; 
disputes between landlords and tenants; 
concerns in Child in Need of Aid cases; and 
concerns in adult guardianship and 
conservatorship cases. 

 

Can we mediate before we file a 
court case? 
Yes.  In fact, many people avoid a contested case 
by going to mediation before filing a case with the 
courts. 
For example, a married couple planning to divorce 
might use mediation to discuss the division of their 
property or a parenting plan for their children.  If 
agreements can be reached on all issues, an 
uncontested case can be filed instead of a 
contested divorce. 
In another example, parents needing to modify 
a custody or support order from years ago may 
engage in mediation before filing a Motion to 
Modify.  This may help to reduce family stress 
and resolve the matter faster than a long court 
battle. 
If we have a court case open, 
does the judge need to know we 
are also in mediation? 
Yes.  Your judge may take the mediation into 
consideration when scheduling hearings and 
determining next steps. 
Is what we say in mediation 
confidential? 
Civil Rule 100 and Probate Rule 4.5 state that 
mediation discussions are confidential when the 
court orders mediation.  This allows open and 
honest communication without worrying that what 
you say will be used against you later. 
If mediation is not ordered by the court, 
Evidence Rule 408 prohibits parties from 
disclosing mediation discussions in a hearing or 
trial.  Additionally, most mediators have a 
written confidentiality agreement that is signed 
before starting mediation.  Ask your mediator to 
explain the confidentiality agreement and any 
limits to confidentiality.

The participants decide what issues to mediate.

How long does mediation take? 
It can take from one hour to many hours - one 
session or several sessions.  It depends on: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

the number of issues to mediate, 
how much you disagree, 
the participants’ willingness to brainstorm 
and accept different proposals, and 
how sensitive the topics are. 
What if one or both of us have 
attorneys? 
Mediation works well with or without attorneys.  
The participants will have to decide whether 
attorneys will attend. 
If you are representing yourself, it may be helpful 
to talk with a lawyer.  Legal advice before or after 
a mediation session can help you understand your 
legal rights and responsibilities.  A lawyer can also 
help you develop proposals for resolving your 
case.  Finally, a lawyer can review the agreements 
you are considering.  
What happens if we reach an 
agreement in mediation? 
The agreement is written down, all the participants 
sign it, and if it involves a court case, it is filed 
with the court. 
If you have a lawyer, ask the lawyer how this will 
be handled.  Usually, once the agreement is 
written and signed, the lawyer will file it in court. 
If you do not have a lawyer, ask the mediator how 
this will be handled.  You will need to decide who 
is responsible for filing the agreement if it involves 
a court case. 
Once the agreement is filed, the court will usually 
schedule a hearing to finalize the agreement.

What happens if we don’t reach 
agreement? 
If you did not reach an agreement, the judge will 
decide all the issues in the case.  
If  you  agreed  on  some  issues,  you  can  file  a 
partial agreement with the court.  The judge will 
decide the remaining issues.   
Mediation  can  be  helpful  even  if  you  do  not 
reach  an  agreement,  because  it  will  help  you 
identify the issues you will need to focus on at a 
hearing or trial.  
What  happens 
if 
domestic violence?  
Mediation may not be appropriate when there 
has been domestic violence between you and 
another person in the case. 
If you are considering mediation with a person 
who controls or attempts to control you 
through force, intimidation, or the threat of 
violence, you should request a private session to 
discuss this with the mediator. 
If you are a victim of domestic violence, you 
cannot be required to participate in mediation if 
you do not want to.  Mediation in cases 
involving domestic violence must be provided 
by a mediator trained in the dynamics of 
domestic violence to protect your safety and the 
safety of your household members.  As a victim 
of domestic violence, you may bring a support 
person or advocate to the mediation, including a 
lawyer (see Alaska Statutes 25.20.080 & .110). 
Does mediation cost anything? 
Mediators charge different rates, but you can 
ask about prices before deciding who to hire. 
The court offers free mediation in a variety of 
cases, including divorce with children, child 
custody, minor guardianships, adult 
guardianships, and child in need of aid. 

 

 

How do we get into mediation? 
Sometimes parties agree to mediate and agree to hire a 
mediator on their own.  You do not need to file a case 
before you mediate.  
If you have a divorce with children, child custody, adult or 
minor guardianship, or child in need of aid case, you can 
ask the court to refer you to one of the court-sponsored 
mediation programs.  Use the court mediation forms: 
http://www.courts.alaska.gov/forms/index.htm#med 

How do we find and choose a 
mediator? 
If you are participating in court-sponsored mediation, the 
court will assign you a mediator.  If you are agreeing to 
private mediation, call around and talk to mediators until 
you find someone you want to work with. 
Please note that in Alaska, anyone can act as a mediator.  
There are no state standards or licensing requirements.  
Mediator education, training, experience, and style vary.  
It is up to those involved to decide what they need in a 
mediator and to select the mediator with the necessary 
skills and approach.  To help parties choose a qualified 
mediator, the Alaska Judicial Council publishes a free 
guide to selecting a qualified mediator:  
A Consumer Guide to Selecting a Mediator 
(http://www.ajc.state.ak.us/publications/docs/guides/
MediatorGuide.pdf)
