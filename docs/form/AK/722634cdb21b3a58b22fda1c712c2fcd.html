HOW TO FILE IN SUPERIOR COURT 

INTRODUCTION 

What is this 
packet for? 

Use this packet: 

















If you want to appeal a health claim that Aetna or OptumRx denied or partially
denied, or a pre-certification request that Aetna or OptumRx denied; and

You already submitted a level 2 appeal and it was denied, or you submitted a
request for external review and it was denied; and

If the services were received after January 1, 2018, you already submitted a
Level 3 appeal and it was denied by the DRB; and

You are an active employee of the Alaska Court System or a dependent.

Do not use this packet: 

This packet is not for emergency appeals.  For help with emergency appeals,
refer to the health PLAN or e-mail the Healthcare Advocates.

This packet is not for dental or vision appeals.  For help with those, refer to
the health PLAN or e-mail the Healthcare Advocates.

This packet is also not for level 1 or 2 appeals to Aetna.  Use form HCA-100, 
Health Appeal Packet 1 or form HCA-200, Health Appeal Packet 2 for those.

This packet is not for Level 3 appeals.  Use form HCA-300, Health Appeal 
Packet 3, for those.

What are 
the basic 
steps for 
appealing? 

The active employee health plan for 2018 includes a new level of appeal.     
For services received on or after January 1, 2018, there are 4 levels of appeal. 
This includes 2 appeals through Aetna or OptumRx, 1 appeal to DRB, and
then 1 appeal to court.  (For services received before January 1, 2018, there 
are 3 levels of appeal.) You must go through each level of appeal in the 
correct order, and  on time. You may withdraw your appeal at any step.  

Step 1 is a LEVEL 1 APPEAL to Aetna or OptumRx. For level 1 appeals, use form 
HCA-100, Health Appeal Packet 1.  If your level 1 appeal is granted, then you won, 
and the process is finished.  If your level 1 appeal is denied, then go to step 2.   

Step 2 will be either a LEVEL 2 APPEAL or a REQUEST FOR EXTERNAL REVIEW, 
depending on the reason why your level 1 appeal was denied.  For step 2, use 
form HCA-200, Health Appeal Packet 2. 

Step 3 is only for services received on or after January 1, 2018, and will be 
a LEVEL 3 APPEAL to DRB. For step 3, use form HCA-300, Health Appeal Packet 3.  
If DRB denies your level 3 review, then go to Step 4. 

This packet 
is for step 4. 

Step 4 is filing an appeal to SUPERIOR COURT if you do not win at the earlier 
steps. For appeals to superior court, use form HCA-400, Health Appeal Packet 4. 

Page 2 | HCA-400, Health Appeal Packet 4 (4/19) | Alaska Court System | HealthcareAdvocates@akcourts.us 

FIND THE DENIAL LETTER 

Find your 
latest denial 
letter. 

If your services or initial pre-certification denial occurred on or after January 1, 
2018, you will have submitted a level 3 appeal to DRB.  DRB will mail you a letter 
explaining that your level 3 appeal was denied.  In that denial letter, DRB will 
explain the reason for denial.  Find the denial letter.  

If your services or pre-certification denial occurred before 2018, you will not 
have any level 3 denial from DRB.  Instead, you will have a level 2 denial from 
Aetna.  In the level 2 denial letter there will be a reason for the denial.  Find the 
denial letter.   

(If more than 50 days passed since you submitted your level 2 or 3 appeal, and 
you have not received a final decision, email HealthcareAdvocates@akcourts.us.) 

DEADLINE FOR SUBMITTING THE APPEAL TO COURT 

When is 
your court 
appeal due? 

IMPORTANT!!! You have 30 calendar days to file your appeal in superior court. 
Calculate 30 days from the date you received notice of the Level 3 denial from 
DRB (or level 2 denial from Aetna, if pre-2018 claim). 

PREPARE THE SUPERIOR COURT APPEAL

Prepare and 
file your 
superior 
court 
appeal. 

For detailed instructions about appealing an agency decision to superior court, see 
form AP-210.  Not all of the process described in the AP-210 will apply (for 
example, there is no agency hearing before filing in superior court), but there is 
some helpful detail.  For general steps, see below: 

1. FILL OUT FORM AP-101 TO PREPARE YOUR NOTICE OF APPEAL.  Fill out the
form and explain the reasons for your appeal.  Use more pages if needed.
Then sign and date the form, and give current contact information.

2. PAY THE $250 COURT FILING FEE OR ASK FOR A WAIVER.  If you cannot

afford the filing fee, you may ask the court to waive it.  To request a waiver,
file form AP-135 and a financial statement (such as form CR-206).

3. PAY THE $750 COST BOND OR ASK FOR A WAIVER.  In addition to the filing
fee, you will need to pay a cost bond of $750.  If you cannot afford a cost
bond, you may ask the court to waive or reduce it.  Use form AP-120 to ask
for a cost bond waiver or reduction. You should also file a financial statement
(form CR-206), and a draft order for the court to sign (form AP-130).

4. WHERE TO FILE THE CASE?  The health plan says to file your appeal in
Juneau Superior Court.  But if there is an Alaska superior court closer to
where you live, you can file in the closer superior court instead.

5. GIVE A COPY OF THE PAPERS TO THE OTHER SIDE.  You must give a copy of

everything you first file at court to the head of the DRB and the Alaska
Attorney General.  (Except, see paragraph 6 about medical records.) The DRB
is the “other side” of the case (the Appellee), and the Attorney General is the
DRB’s attorney.  When you give a copy of papers to the other side, it is called
“service.”  You will be “serving a copy.”

6. DO YOU WANT YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS KEPT CONFIDENTIAL? 

If yes, use court form HCA-405 to ask the court to order that your records be
kept confidential.  When you file this (usually at the start of the court appeal),
put your medical records in a sealed envelope for the Court’s review only.
After the court rules on your motion, then you can give the other side a copy.

See the “search cases” button and then search by case number or name.

FIX THE RECORD

What is “the 
record”? 

After you file your appeal in superior court, DRB’s attorney must put together “the 
record” about what happened during your level 1, level 2, and level 3 appeals.  
The record will be used by the superior court to review your claim. DRB sometimes 
makes mistakes when it puts the record together. For example: 







Sometimes DRB includes the wrong health plan, like the retiree plan instead
of the active employee plan.

Sometimes DRB forgets to include medical records or letters that you or
your doctor sent with your level 1, level 2, and level 3 appeals.

Sometimes DRB tries to keep your medical records out of the record on
purpose because they think the medical records do not apply to the decision
being made.  We have seen this happen, for example, with claims that
Aetna said were above the “recognized charge.”

If you think the record is wrong or missing something, ask the court to have it 
corrected by making a motion.  But first, you should try and work the problem out 
with DRB’s attorney.  You may use form HCA-410 to document your efforts: 

1. Make sure you and DRB both agree to an extension of time to file anything

while you try to work things out.  Either side may file a request for more time
from the court.

2. Keep notes about your discussions with DRB’s attorney while you try and work
things out.  This will help you prove to the court later on that you made a
good faith effort to get the record fixed.

What should 
I do if DRB’s 
record is 
wrong or 
incomplete? 

Page 4 | HCA-400, Health Appeal Packet 4 (4/19) | Alaska Court System | HealthcareAdvocates@akcourts.us 

3.

If you cannot get the record fixed by informal talks with DRB’s attorney, file a
motion asking the judge to fix it instead. You may use form HCA-415, Motion
to Supplement the Record or for Partial New Review.”

PREPARE YOUR BRIEF

This is just 
the basic 
outline of a 
brief. 

When the time comes, you will start preparing your “brief” for court.  Your brief 
will be your explanation to the court about what happened during the level 1,  
level 2, and level 3 appeals, and why you think DRB/Aetna/OptumRx was wrong.

MOTION TO SEAL OR MAINTAIN MEDICAL RECORDS CONFIDENTIAL 
(Alaska Const. Article 1, § 22; Alaska R. App. P. 512.5(b); Alaska R. Adm. P. 37.6) 

[Notice to Appellee:  Enclosed with this motion are my medical records in a sealed envelope for the 
Court only.  These records will be provided to the Appellee after the Court rules, and then they 
must be kept confidential (if so ordered).] 

I am the Appellant who brought this appeal.  I ask the court to let me file the enclosed medical 
records under seal, to keep the medical records confidential, and not let them be disclosed to the 
public.  I ask that the records only be viewed by the court, the parties in this case, and their 
attorneys.  In making this request, I am not waiving my right to keep this medical information 
confidential and private. 

Medical records include private information and are not open to public inspection under the 
Alaska Public Records Act.1  Also, the Alaska Constitution says that “[t]he right of the people to 
privacy is recognized and shall not be infringed.”2 Medical records are also considered 
confidential information under federal privacy rules set by HIPAA.3  

I am filing medical records for the court to review in this case because they are relevant to the 
question whether the Appellee Division of Retirement and Benefits (DRB) properly reviewed and 
considered them when DRB made its decision about [check all that apply]: 

the medical necessity of the procedures or medication at issue.  
calculation of  the “recognized charge” and/or “derived charge.”

DRB failed to include the medical records in the agency record despite the fact that DRB based 
the denial of medical benefits on those medical records.  In order for the Court to decide 
whether DRB properly evaluated those factors, it is necessary to have the records before the 
court.  Nevertheless, I believe that the specific medical information in the records should remain 
confidential to protect my privacy.   

When the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) decides similar appeals of DRB decisions 
about retiree benefits, OAH maintains the privacy of the medical records and of the names of 
the individuals whose medical claims are being decided.4  While my name is not confidential in 
this case,  I am entitled to this same degree of confidentiality and privacy regarding my medical 
records.   

I respectfully ask the Court to maintain confidentiality of these medical records and keep them 
under seal for the duration of this appeal.

SUBJECT:  LETTER TO AGENCY ATTORNEY ABOUT ERRORS IN THE AGENCY RECORD 

Dear agency attorney, 

The purpose of this letter is to ask you to fix some problems with the agency record in this case.   
The specific problems are described below.  If our differences about the agency record are not resolved 
within 10 business days after the date of this letter, I will ask the court to supplement the record or I 
will ask the court for a partial new review.  Any response from you about this letter should be sent to 
me by regular First Class US Mail, or by email to my email address at the top of this page.    

Problems with the agency record are as follows (check all that apply): 

Health Plan.  The agency used the wrong health plan in the agency record.  Please 
correct the record with the correct plan. 

Recognized Charge Data.  The agency says my health claim was denied at least in part 
because my provider’s charges were above the “recognized charge.”  In my appeal, I 
asked for data in the agency’s possession or control about actual prevailing charge 
rates for the same or similar procedure in the geographic area where my procedure 
was done.  The agency did not provide the information, or other requested information, 
and did not include it in the agency record. The agency says that the information I 
asked for was not part of, or relevant to, its decision whether to reimburse for my 
provider’s actual charges.  I disagree and ask that the data I requested below be 
included in the agency record. 

[continued on next page] 

HCA-410 (1/18) 
GOOD FAITH LETTER TO DRB’S ATTORNEY REGARDING THE AGENCY RECORD 

Medical Records.  The agency failed to include medical records about the denied claims 
in the agency record.  The agency says the medical records were not part of, or 
relevant to, its decision whether to reimburse for the claims.  In my appeal, I requested 
a copy of my medical records in the agency’s possession (whether or not reviewed or 
used in making the decision below).  I renew my request that the medical records be 
included in the agency record because they are relevant to the agency’s adverse benefit 
determination. 

Proprietary Documents.  The agency says my claim was denied because of information 
in proprietary documents, guidelines, or bulletins.  I asked for a copy of the documents, 
guidelines, and bulletins in my appeal, but the agency refused to release them to me 
and refused to include them in the agency record.  There are procedures (protocols) for 
releasing the documents or guidelines to patients like me who are adversely affected by 
them, but the agency refuses to follow those procedures.  Please include the requested 
documents, guidelines, and bulletins in the agency record. 

Other Problems with the Agency Record.

MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT THE RECORD  
or alternatively 
MOTION FOR PARTIAL NEW (DE NOVO) REVIEW 

Motion to Supplement the Record 
I am the Appellant who brought this appeal.  I ask the Court to supplement the record.  
Efforts between me and the attorney for the other side1 to agree on the accurate and 
complete record were not fully successful.  DRB failed to include or provide accurate and 
complete records of its underlying administrative decisions then and still today.  The result 
is a denial of due process.  For example [check all that apply]:  

Health Plan.  DRB used the wrong health plan in the agency record. 

Recognized Charge Data.  DRB says that my health claims were partially denied 
because my provider’s charges were above the “recognized charge.”  In my appeal, 
I asked for data in DRB’s possession or control about actual prevailing charge rates 
for the same or similar procedure in the geographic area where my procedure was 
done, but the agency refused to provide it and refused to include it in the agency 
record.  DRB also failed to provide other data about the recognized charge that I 
requested.  DRB says that the information I requested was not part of, or relevant 
to, its decision whether to reimburse for my provider’s actual charges.   

Medical Records.  DRB failed to include medical records about the denied claims in 
the agency record.  DRB says the medical records were not part of, or relevant to, 
its decision whether to reimburse for the claims.

The Appellee, Division of Retirement and Benefits (DRB).  Under DRB’s contract with Aetna Life 
Insurance Company (Aetna), Aetna administers health care claims and conducts administrative appeals 
on DRB’s behalf.  Reference to actions by DRB in this case include actions by Aetna in its role as claims 
administrator and fiduciary. See State of Alaska AlaskaCare Employee Health Plan at §7.9, §7.14, & 
§7.15.3 at http://doa.alaska.gov/drb/pdf/ghlb/akcare/SelectBenefitsEmployeeBooklet2017.pdf.

App. R. 604; 609 

Proprietary Documents.  DRB says that my claims were denied because of 
information in proprietary documents, guidelines, or bulletins.  I asked for a copy of 
the documents, guidelines, and bulletins in my appeal, but DRB refused to release 
them to me and refused to include them in the agency record.  There are 
procedures (protocols) for releasing these materials to patients who are adversely 
affected by them, but DRB refuses to follow those procedures. 

Other Problems with the DRB Record. 

[Use extra pages if necessary.] 

Supplementing the record with the requested information and other relevant material 
described in this motion is proper under the Rules of Appellate Procedure (RAP) 604 which 
allows supplementation of the record for material omissions on appeal. 

II.

Motion for Partial New (De Novo) Review
If my motion to supplement the record is denied, I ask for a partial new review of this
matter because the records missing from the agency record are crucial to this Court’s
review of the DRB decision.  A review of the DRB decision, supplemented by the relevant
and essential documents and information is necessary to give me due process in this
appeal.  The court has the discretion to grant a trial de novo in whole or in part per RAP
609(b)(1).  This motion is supported by my affidavit, exhibits, and the discussion below.
