entence Appeal.  If you are ordered to serve more than two years in jail, you may appeal the 

sentence to the court of appeals on the ground that it is excessive.  

NOTE: You may not appeal the sentence as excessive if it was imposed in accordance with a 
plea agreement that provided for a specific sentence or a sentence equal to or less than a 
specified maximum sentence.  If the sentence was imposed in accordance with a plea agreement 
that provided for a minimum sentence, you may appeal as excessive only the part of the sentence 
that is longer than the minimum sentence by more than two years.

petition for review in the Supreme Court.  To do this, you must file a notice of intent to file a 
petition for sentence review within 10 days of the date of distribution stated below.  See 
Appellate Rules 215 and 403(h) for more information on time limits, procedures, and possible 
consequences of seeking review of your sentence.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
