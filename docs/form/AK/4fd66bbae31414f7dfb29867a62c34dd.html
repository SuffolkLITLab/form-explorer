  Primary

(For divided custody, fill in both a and b.  For hybrid custody, fill in a, b, and c.) 

Primary Custody (child lives with this parent more than 70% of the year)

The child(ren) reside with

which equals  
following periods: 

 % of the year, and with 

 during the 

which equals

Failure  to  take  physical  custody  of  the  child(ren)  at  least  30%  of  the  year  is 
grounds for modification of this support order.  However, denial of visitation by 
the  custodial  parent  is  not  cause  to  increase  child  support.    Civil  Rule 
90.3(b)(1)(E) 

4.

Support Modification.  It is hereby ordered that the support order dated
is modified as follows:

The obligor,  
, shall pay child support as follows:
(Put the current number of children on the first line.  Subtract one number on each
subsequent line and do the calculations for each line.)

Except  as  provided  below,  as  each  child  reaches  the  age  of  18,  is  otherwise  legally 
emancipated or dies, the amount of support will change to the next lower amount.  

Support must continue while each child is 18 years old if the child is  (1) unmarried, 
(2) actively pursuing a high school diploma or equivalent level of technical or vocational 
training, and (3) living as a dependent with the obligee parent or guardian or a designee 
of the parent or guardian, unless the following box is checked: 
Child support will end when each child reaches age 18. 

The first payment is due no later than

Extended Visitation Credit (available only in primary custody situations).

Primary physical custody of the children listed in paragraph 3.a or 3.b has been given to
the non-obligor parent.  However, the obligor parent will have physical custody of these
child(ren) for the following periods of over 27 consecutive days:

If this visitation is exercised, child support is reduced for the above period(s) as follows: 

(This reduction may not exceed 75% of the amount owed for the period.) 

If this visitation is not exercised, child support is not reduced.  [Civil Rule 90.3(a)(3)] 

6.

Seasonal Income.

  The court finds that 

obligor’s income is seasonal, and







obligee agrees that, as long  as the total annual amount  remains the same, the
obligor  can  make  higher  payments  during  high  income  months  and  lower
payments during low income months as set forth below, and

the burden of budgeting for periods of unequal income should be placed on the
obligee rather than the obligor.

The annual support amount is: $  

The average monthly support amount is: $ 

Therefore,  it  is  ordered  that  the  monthly  support  amount  in  paragraph  4  will  be 
varied as follows: 

High Income Months.  Obligor must pay $ 

 per month in the following months: 

Low Income Months.  Obligor must pay $ 

 per month in the following months: 

If  this  support  order  takes  effect  in  a  low  income  month,  the  obligor  must  pay  the 
“average monthly amount” each month until a high income month is reached, at which 
time the unequal monthly payment schedule will begin. 

This order varying the monthly support amount applies only to the support amount for 
the number of children listed on the first line in paragraph 4.  When support is no longer 
owed for the first child, the seasonal variation in monthly support amounts 

must be recalculated.

Application of Civil Rule 90.3 Formula.

The amount of child support in paragraph 4 was determined pursuant to:
a.
b.
c.

The formula in Civil Rule 90.3(a) or (b). 
90.3(c)(2).  Obligor’s adjusted annual income is over $126,000.
90.3(c)(3).  Obligor’s calculated amount of support is less than $600 per year 
so the $600 minimum was ordered. Obligor’s income is low because obligor is: 

incarcerated. 
unable to work because 
other   

d. 

90.3(c)(1).    The  court  finds  good  cause  upon  proof  by  clear  and  convincing 
evidence  that  manifest  injustice  would  result  if  the  support  award  were  not 
varied.  Reason(s) for the variation: 

The amount of support that would have been required but for this 90.3(c)(1) 
variation is $ 
 children  per  month  to  be  paid  by 
Parent  B.    The  estimated  value  of  any  property  conveyed 
Parent  A 

 for 

instead of support calculated under 90.3 is $

8.

Medical  Support  Order.    AS  25.27.060(c)  and  Civil  Rule  90.3(d)(1).    This  order
concerns health insurance for the child(ren) covered by this child support order.  It does
not concern health insurance for  any other children or for the parents.

a. Current Coverage.

  obligor 

The 
  obligee  must  purchase  health  insurance  for  the 
child(ren)  because  such  insurance  is  available  at  reasonable  cost  through 
his/her employer, union or otherwise.  Name and address of employer/union 
through which insurance will be purchased: 

The insurance cost (currently $ 
between the parties equally unless a different division of the cost is ordered. 

 per  month)  will  be  divided 

The child support calculation in paragraph 4 includes: 

a credit of $ 
 per month (50% of the cost to the obligor) for 
health  insurance  purchased  for  the  child(ren)  by  the  obligor.    If  the 
obligor  fails  to  purchase  the  insurance,  the  monthly  child  support 
obligation  will  increase  by  this  amount,  without  further  order  of  the 
court,  until  the  obligor  purchases  the  insurance  and  provides  proof  of 
the  purchase  to  the  other  parent  and  to  the  Child  Support  Services 
Division (CSSD) if CSSD is handling collections. 

 per month (50% of the cost to the obligee) for 
an extra $  
health  insurance  purchased  for  the  child(ren)  by  the  obligee.    If  the 
obligee  fails  to  purchase  the  insurance,  the  monthly  child  support 
obligation  will  decrease  by  this  amount,  without  further  order  of  the 
court,  until  the  obligee purchases  the  insurance  and  provides  proof  of 
the  purchase  to  the  other  parent  and  to  the  Child  Support  Services 
Division (CSSD) if CSSD is handling collections.

DR-301 (11/18) (cs)
ORDER  MODIFYING  CHILD  SUPPORT 

AS 25.27.020, .062, .080 
Civil Rule 90.3 

If  the  cost  of  the  insurance  changes,  the  amount  of  the  child  support 
obligation  will  be  adjusted  accordingly,  without  further  order  of  the  court.  
The  parent  purchasing  the  insurance  shall  provide  documentation  of  the 
change to the other parent and to the Child Support Services Division (CSSD) 
if  CSSD  is  handling  collections.    If  either  parent  believes  the  cost  of  the 
insurance  has  become  unreasonable,  that  parent  may  file  a  motion  asking 
the court to suspend the requirement that insurance be purchased. 
The children are eligible for services through 

  the Indian Health Service 

  military medical benefits 

but  these  services  are  not  available  in  the  area  where  the  children  live.  
Therefore, insurance must be purchased as stated above until these services 
become available. 
The children are eligible for services through 

  the Indian Health Service 

  military medical benefits 

and  these  services  are  available  to  the  children.    Therefore,  no  additional 
insurance is required while these services are available. 
Health insurance for the child(ren) is not now available at reasonable cost or 
its availability is unknown. 

b. Future  Coverage.    If  there  is  no  health  care  coverage  for  the  child(ren)  and
insurance  becomes  available  to  a  parent  at  a  reasonable  cost,  that  parent  must
purchase  the  insurance  after  giving  notice  to  the  other  parent.  The  cost  of  the
insurance must be divided between the parents equally unless a different division of
the  cost  is  ordered.  Without  further  order  of  the  court,  the  monthly  child  support
obligation  will  increase  by  50%    of  the  cost  of  the  insurance      if  the  obligee
purchases  it  and  decrease  by  50%  of  the  cost  of  the  insurance  if  the  obligor
purchases it, unless otherwise ordered.   If the parents  disagree about whether the
cost of insurance is reasonable or about which insurance policy should be purchased,
either parent may file a motion asking the court to resolve the dispute.

c.

Information for Other Parent.  The parent purchasing the insurance must notify the
insurance  company  that  the  other  parent  can  apply  for  benefits  on  behalf  of  the
child(ren)  and  should  be  reimbursed  directly.    The  purchaser  must  also  provide
coverage information to the other parent and all forms and instructions necessary to
apply  for  benefits.    The  parent  with  insurance  who  receives  statements  or
Explanations of Benefits from the insurance company regarding any of the children
must send a copy to the other parent upon request.

9.

Uncovered  Health  Care  Expenses  (including  medical,  dental,  vision  and  mental
health counseling expenses).  Civil Rule 90.3(d)(2) and (f)(5).
The cost of the child(ren)'s reasonable health care expenses not covered by insurance
must be paid as follows, unless the expenses exceed $5,000 in a calendar year:

Obligor will pay half and obligee will pay half. 
Obligor will pay 
because 

 and obligee will pay 

A party shall reimburse the other party for his or her share of the uncovered expenses 
within 30 days after receiving the health care bill, proof of payment and, if applicable, a 
health  insurance  statement  showing  what  part  of  the  cost  is  uncovered.    The  bill  and 
other  materials  should  be  sent  within  a  reasonable  time.    If  the  uncovered  expenses 
exceed $5,000 in a calendar year, the expenses must be allocated based on the parties' 
relative financial circumstances when the expenses occur.

Travel Expenses.  Civil Rule 90.3(g)

Travel expenses which are necessary to exercise visitation will be allocated between the
parties as follows:

11.

INCOME WITHHOLDING ORDER.  Unless one of the following boxes is checked (or
CSSD later authorizes an exemption for one of these reasons), the obligor, any employer
of  the  obligor  and  any  person,  political  subdivision,  department  of  the  State,  or  other
entity  possessing  property  of  the  obligor  shall  immediately  withhold  from  the  obligor's
income  and  any  other money  due  the  obligor  the  amount  of  child  support  due  per  AS
25.27.062 and shall pay this amount to the Child Support Services Division.

The  previous  support  order  in  this  case  did  not  require  immediate  withholding 
and CSSD is not enforcing this order.  Therefore, income withholding shall not be 
initiated until the requirements of AS 25.27.062(c) are met. 
The  parties  have  agreed  on  the  alternative  arrangement  described  in  the 
attached document signed by both parties, and income withholding has not been 
terminated previously and subsequently initiated. 
The  court  finds  good  cause  not  to  require  immediate  income  withholding 
because it  would not be in the best  interests of the child(ren) for the following 
reason: 

The  court  further  finds  that  the  obligor  has  made  voluntary  support  payments 
under the previous order and has not been in arrears in an amount equal to the 
support payable for one month, as defined in AS 25.27.062(m)(2)(B). 

The  obligor  is  receiving  social  security  or  other  disability  compensation  that 
includes  regular  payments  to  the  child(ren)  at  least  equal  to  the  support  owed 
each month.  To the extent these payments to the child(ren) do not satisfy the 
monthly  amount  owed,  the  remaining  amount  due  shall  be  withheld  from  the 
obligor's income pursuant to AS 25.27.062. 

Even  if  one  of  the  above  boxes  is  checked,  exempting  the  obligor  from  immediate 
income  withholding,  such  withholding  may  be  initiated  under  AS  25.27.062(c)  through 
the court or through CSSD. 

12.

CSSD  Services.    All  child  support  payments  must  be  made  to  the  Child  Support
Services  Division  (CSSD)  if  one  of  the  parties  applies  for  the  services  of  CSSD.    In
addition,  if  the  above  income  withholding  order  is  served  on  the  obligor’s  employer  or
anyone  holding  money  belonging  to  the  obligor,  the  money  withheld  pursuant  to  the
order must be paid to CSSD.

An application for CSSD services was already submitted by one of the parties.
An application for CSSD services accompanies this order.



In  addition,  the  obligor  has  agreed  to  keep  the  obligee  (or  CSSD  if  CSSD  is  enforcing  the  order) 
informed of the obligor’s current employer and the availability of employment-related health insurance 
coverage for the children until the support order is satisfied.

When payments are made through CSSD: 
a.

No  application  for  CSSD  services  has  been  submitted,  but  one  or  both  parties

Neither party intends to apply for CSSD services. 

Payments must include the case number and names of both parties and must be
made  payable  to  the  CHILD  SUPPORT  SERVICES  DIVISION,  PO  Box  100380,
Anchorage, Alaska 99510-0380.  CSSD shall disburse the payments as required by
law after deducting any fee required by law.
CSSD shall maintain a record of support payments.
Interest will be imposed in accordance with AS 25.27.020 on payments which are
10 or more days overdue or if payment is made by a check backed by insufficient
funds.  No interest will be charged, except on arrearages more than 30 days past
due, if payments are made under an income withholding order.
The  parties  shall  notify  CSSD,  in  writing,  of  any  change  in  their  mailing  or
residence addresses within 5 days after any such change.
The  obligor  shall  keep  CSSD  informed  of  the  name  and  address  of  his  or  her
current employer.  Whenever employment changes, the obligor must notify  CSSD
in  writing  within  20  days.    This  employment  information  must  be  given  to  the
obligee instead of CSSD if CSSD is not enforcing the order.
The  party  ordered  to  provide  insurance  shall  provide  to  CSSD  proof  of  medical
insurance  coverage  for  the  children  within  20  days  of  this  order.    If  insurance
becomes unavailable, that party shall notify CSSD within 20 days.  When insurance
again becomes available, that party must, within 20 days, give CSSD proof that the
children  are insured.    The  above  proof  and  notice  of  insurance  must  be  given  to
the other party instead of CSSD if CSSD is not enforcing the order.
If a party applies for CSSD services:
(1)  CSSD  shall  take  whatever  enforcement  action  is  legally  proper,  including
recommending  contempt  proceedings  against  the  party  ordered  to  pay 
support.  Failure  to  pay  support  as  ordered  may  result  in  execution 
against the property of the obligor or arrest of the obligor. 

(2)  Either party may ask CSSD to review the amount of child support.  CSSD may 
require  that  the  request  be  made  in  writing  on  a  form  specified  by  CSSD. 
The  parties  shall  provide  income  information  requested  by  CSSD  in 
connection with a review of the amount of child support within 20 days after 
the date the request is mailed. 

(3)  Unless  the  box  below  is  checked,  CSSD  may  issue  a  withholding  order, 
pursuant  to  AS  25.27.062  or  AS  25.27.250,  to  attach  funds  owed  to  the 
obligor  by  any  corporation  created  by  the  Alaska  Native  Claims  Settlement 
Act  (ANCSA)  or  any  settlement  trusts  established  pursuant  to  section  39  of 
ANCSA,  codified  at  43  USC  1629e.    Upon  service  of  such  an  order,  the 
obligor's  dividends,  distributions  and/or  other  periodic  monetary  benefits  of 
ANCSA stock or benefits paid by a settlement trust shall be transferred to the 
child  support  obligee  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  withholding  order.    The 
ANCSA  corporation  or  settlement  trust shall  pay  the  funds so  transferred  to 
CSSD for distribution to the child support obligee.  The obligor is  prohibited 
from transferring, selling or otherwise alienating his/her ANCSA stock or trust 
benefits after CSSD issues a withholding order based on an arrearage. 
CSSD  is  not  authorized  to  issue  the  withholding  order  described  above

Effect of Assignment of Right to Child Support to State.  This order does not bind
the Child Support Services Division of Alaska or of any other state to the child support

Unless  the  following  box  is  checked,  the  party  ordered  to  pay  support  is  ordered  to
apply  for  an  Alaska  Permanent  Fund  Dividend  (PFD)  if  he or  she  is  an Alaska  resident
and is more than two months in arrears as of December 31 of the previous year.  The
party  shall  submit  a  complete  and  accurate  PFD  application  to  the  Permanent  Fund
Dividend Division by January 15 and shall timely submit any supplemental information or

eligible  for  a  dividend,  the  party  must  file  proof  of  non-eligibility  with  CSSD  if  CSSD  is
enforcing this support order.

The  party  ordered  to  pay  support  is  not  required  to  apply  for  an  Alaska 
Permanent Fund Dividend because:  

15.

Notice To Party Ordered To Pay Support (Obligor).

a.

b.

c.

d.

You must pay the amount of support stated in this order.  You cannot give gifts,
clothes, food, or other things instead of paying this money.

You  must  pay  support  on  time.    You  are  not  excused  from  paying  even  if  the
other party denies you visitation with the child(ren).  If you are denied visitation,
you can file a motion to enforce visitation with the court, but you must still pay
the child support.

You  must  pay  child  support  before  your  other  bills  and  debts.    Child  support
payments have priority over most other debts.

If you get married or take on an obligation to support someone else, you will still
be expected to make all the payments ordered in this order.  If you fail to do so
and a case is brought against you to enforce payment, your new obligations will
not excuse your failure to pay.

16.

Notice to Both Parties: If your situation changes, ask the court to change this
order right away.

This child support order is based on:



your current income, and
your current custody and visitation arrangement.

If  either  changes  significantly  (for  example,  if  a  child  starts  living  with  a  different 
parent), you can ask the court to change the custody order or child support order.  The 
court has forms to help you do this (the DR-700 Packet). 

It  is  very  important  to  ask  the  court  as  soon  as  a  change  occurs  because  child 
support cannot be changed retroactively (that is, a new order cannot cancel the amount 
ordered to be paid in the past).

ORDER  MODIFYING  CHILD  SUPPORT 

AS 25.27.020, .062, .080 
Civil Rule 90.3 

Past due amounts continue to remain due even if the person owed support does not ask 
for  payment  (except  in  the  special  situation  described  in  Civil  Rule  90.3(h)(3)).    With 
interest added, these past due amounts can grow into a substantial debt. 

Once  a  year,  either  party  can  ask  the  other  party  to  provide  documents  such  as  tax 
returns  and  pay  stubs  showing  the  party’s  income  for  the  prior  calendar  year.    The 
request must be in writing and the party making it must attach copies of his or her tax 
return and pay stubs to the request.  The other party must respond with documentation 
of his or her income within 30 days.
