box is checked:  

 Child support will end when each child reaches age 18. 

This  child  support  order  is  suspended  for  the  time  periods  when  the  child  is 
taken  into  State  custody  in  a  child  in  need  of  aid  case  or  juvenile  delinquency 
proceeding  and  one  of  the  following  two  conditions  exist:  (1)  the  State  places 
the  child  with  the  obligor  parent;  or  (2)  this  child  support  order  is  based  on 
shared,  divided,  or  hybrid  custody.    CSSD  may  redirect  or  administratively 
establish child support as necessary. 

6.

EXTENDED VISITATION CREDIT

Extended visitation applies to this case. (Primary custody cases only.) 

Primary  physical  custody  of  the  children  was  awarded  to  one  parent  or  custodian. 
The  other  parent  (the  obligor  parent)  was  awarded  visitation  with  the  children  for 
certain extended periods of time longer than 27 consecutive days as follows: 

If  and  when  the  obligor  parent  exercises  this  extended  visitation,  child  support  is 
reduced for the above period(s) as follows: 

This credit may not exceed 75% of the amount owed for the period (Civ. R. 90.3(a)(3)) 
and does not apply to shared, hybrid, or divided physical custody awards.  If the obligor 
parent’s  payments  are  based  on  seasonal  income,  this  credit  is  based  on  the  average 
monthly  support  amount.    If  extended  visitation  is  not  exercised,  child  support  is  not 
reduced. 

7.

SEASONAL INCOME

The court finds that: 



the obligor’s income is seasonal; and
the obligee agrees that, as long as the total annual amount remains the same,
the  obligor can make higher payments  during  high income months and lower
payments during low income months as set forth below; and
the obligee should be responsible for budgeting during unequal income periods.



Annual support amount is $ 
Therefore, it is ordered that the monthly support amount in paragraph (5)(b) will 
be varied as follows: 
High Income Months.  Obligor must pay $  

  Average monthly support amount is $ 

 per month in the months of: 

Low Income Months.  Obligor must pay $ 

 per month in the months of: 

If this support  order takes effect  in a low income month, the obligor must pay the 
average  monthly  amount  each  month  until  a  high  income  month  is  reached,  at 
which time the unequal monthly payment schedule will begin. 

This order varying the monthly support amount applies only to the support amount 
for  the  number  of  children  listed  on  the  first  line  of  the  chart  in  paragraph  (5)(b).  
When support is no longer owed for the first child, the seasonal variation in monthly 
support amounts  

 must be recalculated   

  will be as follows

VARIATION FROM CIVIL RULE 90.3 FORMULA
The amount of child support was determined pursuant to:
a.
b.
c.

The formula in Civil Rule 90.3(a) or (b). 
90.3(c)(2). Obligor’s adjusted annual income is over $126,000.
90.3(c)(3). Obligor’s calculated amount of support is less than $600 per year 
so $600 minimum was ordered.  Obligor’s income is low because obligor is: 

incarcerated  
unable to work because 
other  

d. 

90.3(c)(1).  The  court  finds  good  cause  upon  proof  by  clear  and  convincing 
evidence  that  manifest  injustice would  result  if the support  award were not 
varied.  Reason(s) for the variation: 

The  amount  of  support  which  would  have  been  required  but  for  this 
90.3(c)(1) variation is $ 
 children per month to be 
 for 
paid  by  the 
Parent B.  The  estimated  value  of  any  property
conveyed instead of support calculated under 90.3 is $

Health Insurance Available at Reasonable Cost  
Services through the Indian Health Service or the military are not available to 
the children, but health insurance is available at a reasonable cost.  
i.

The
obligee  must  purchase  health  insurance  for  the 
children  because  it  is  available  at  a  reasonable  cost  through  the 
employer, union, or otherwise.  Name and address of employer, union, 
or other entity through which insurance will be purchased:

ii.

The insurance cost to insure the children (currently $

division is ordered.  

 A different division is ordered as follows:

(OBLIGOR=person paying support)
(OBLIGEE=person receiving support)

AS 25.27.020, .062-.080 
Civil Rule 90.3 

iii.

The child support calculation in paragraph (5)(b) includes:

A credit of $  
 per  month  (50%  of  the  cost  to  the 
obligor)  for  health  insurance  purchased  for  the  children  by  the 
obligor.    If  the  obligor  fails  to  purchase  the  insurance,  the 
monthly  child  support  obligation  will  increase  by  this  amount, 
without further order of the court, until the obligor purchases the 
insurance and provides proof of the purchase to the other parent 
and  to  the  Child  Support  Services  Division  (CSSD)  if  CSSD  is 
handling collections. 
An extra $  
 per  month  (50%  of  the  cost  to  the 
obligee)  for  health  insurance  purchased  for  the  children  by  the 
obligee.    If  the  obligee  fails  to  purchase  the  insurance,  the 
monthly  child  support  obligation  will  decrease  by  this  amount, 
without further order of the court, until the obligee purchases the 
insurance and provides proof of the purchase to the other parent 
and  to  the  Child  Support  Services  Division  (CSSD)  if  CSSD  is 
handling collections. 

iv.

v.

If  the  cost  of  the  insurance  changes,  the  amount  of  the  child  support
obligation  will  be  adjusted  accordingly  without  further  order  of  the
court. The parent purchasing the insurance shall provide documentation
of  the  change  to  the  other  parent  and  to  CSSD  if  CSSD  is  handling
collections.  If  either  parent  believes  the  cost  of  the  insurance  has
become unreasonable, that parent may file a motion asking the court to
suspend the requirement that insurance be purchased.

The  parent  purchasing  the  insurance  must  notify  the  insurance
company  that  the  other  parent  or  custodian  can  apply  for  benefits  on
behalf  of  the  children  and  should  be  reimbursed  directly.    The
purchaser  must  also  provide  coverage  information  to  the  other  parent
and  all  forms  and  instructions  necessary  to  apply  for  benefits.    The
parent  with  insurance  who  receives  statements  or  Explanations  of
Benefits  from  the  insurance  company  regarding  any  of  the  children
must send a copy to the other parent or custodian upon request.

No Services or Insurance / Future Coverage 
Health  insurance  is  not  available  at  a  reasonable  cost  and  services  through 
the Indian Health Service or the military are not available, or their availability 
is  unknown.    If  Indian  Health  Service  or  military  services become available, 
no additional health insurance is required.  If insurance becomes available to 
a parent at a reasonable cost, that parent must purchase the insurance after 
giving notice to the other parent. The cost of the insurance must be divided 
between the parents equally unless a different division of the cost is ordered. 
Without  further  order of the court, the monthly  child support  obligation will 
increase by 50% of the cost of the insurance if the obligee purchases it, and 
decrease  by  50%  of  the  cost  of  the  insurance  if  the  obligor  purchases  it, 
unless otherwise ordered.  If the parents disagree about whether the cost of 
insurance is reasonable or about which insurance policy should be purchased, 
either parent may file a motion asking the court to resolve the dispute.

UNCOVERED HEALTH CARE EXPENSES
The  cost  of  the  children's  reasonable  health  care  expenses  (including  medical,  dental,
orthodontic, vision, and mental health counseling expenses), up to $5,000 in a calendar
year, not covered by insurance, must be paid as follows:

A party shall reimburse the other party for his or her share of the uncovered expenses 
within 30 days after receiving the health care bill, proof of payment and, if applicable, a 
health  insurance  statement  showing  what  part  of  the  cost  is  uncovered.    The  bill  and 
other materials should be sent within a reasonable time. 

Reasonable, uncovered health care expenses exceeding $5,000 in a calendar year shall 
be  allocated  based  on  the  parties'  relative  financial  circumstances  when  the  expenses 
occur.   [Civil Rule 90.3(d)(2) and (f)(5)]

INCOME WITHHOLDING ORDER
Unless one of the following boxes is checked (or CSSD later authorizes an exemption for
one of these reasons), the obligor, any employer of the obligor, and any person, political
subdivision, department of the State, or other entity possessing property of the obligor,
shall  immediately  withhold  from  the  obligor's  income  and  any  other  money  due  the
obligor  the  amount  of  child  support  due  pursuant  to  AS  25.27.062  and  shall  pay  this
amount to CSSD.

The  obligor  is  receiving  social  security  or  other  disability  compensation  that 
includes regular payments to the children at least equal to the support owed each 
month.  To the extent these payments to the children do not satisfy the monthly 
amount  owed,  the  remaining  amount  due  shall  be  withheld  from  the  obligor's 
income pursuant to AS 25.27.062. 
The  parties  agreed  on  the  alternative  arrangement  described  in  the  attached 
document signed by both parties 
 (For Modification Order) Income withholding 
has not been terminated previously and subsequently initiated.* 
The court finds good cause not to require immediate income withholding.  It would 
not be in the best interests of the children for the following reason(s): 

  In addition, the obligor agreed to keep the obligee (or CSSD if CSSD is enforcing the order) informed of 
the obligor’s current employer and the availability of employment-related health insurance coverage for 
the children until the support order is satisfied.

AS 25.27.020, .062-.080 
Civil Rule 90.3 

(For Modification Order)  The  court  further  finds  that  the  obligor  made 
voluntary  support  payments  under  the  previous  order  and  has  not  been  in 
arrears in an amount equal to the support payable for one month, as defined 
in AS 25.27.062(m)(2)(B). 

(For Modification Order)  The  previous  support  order  in  this  case  did  not  require 
immediate  withholding  and  CSSD  is  not  enforcing  this  order.    Therefore,  income 
withholding  shall  not  be  initiated  until  the  requirements  of  AS  25.27.062(c)  are 
met. 

Even  if  one  of  the  above  boxes  is  checked,  exempting  the  obligor  from  immediate 
income  withholding,  such  withholding  may  be  initiated  under  AS  25.27.062(c)  through 
the court or through CSSD. 

13.

CSSD SERVICES
All child support payments must be made to CSSD if one of the parties applies for the
services  of  CSSD.   In  addition,  if  the  above  income  withholding  order is  served on  the
obligor’s  employer  or  anyone  holding  money  belonging  to  the  obligor,  the  money
withheld pursuant to the order must be paid to CSSD.

An application for CSSD services was already submitted by one of the parties. 
An application for CSSD services accompanies this order. 
An application for CSSD services has not been submitted, but one or both of the 
parties intend to submit one.
Neither party intends to apply for CSSD services. 

When payments are made through CSSD: 
a.

Payments must include the case number and names of both parties and must be
made payable to

f.

CSSD  shall  disburse  the  payments  as  required  by  law  after  deducting  any  fee 
required by law. 
CSSD shall maintain a record of support payments.
Interest will be imposed  according to AS 25.27.020 on payments which are 10 or
more days overdue or if payment is made by a check backed by insufficient funds.
No interest will be charged, except on arrearages more than 30 days past due, if
payments are made under an income withholding order.
The  parties  shall  notify  CSSD,  in  writing,  of  any  change  in  their  mailing  or
residence addresses immediately after any such change.
The  obligor  shall  keep  CSSD  informed  of  the  name  and  address  of  his  or  her
current employer.  Whenever employment  changes, the obligor must notify CSSD
in  writing  within  20  days.    This  employment  information  must  be  given  to  the
obligee instead of CSSD if CSSD is not enforcing the order.
The  party  ordered  to  provide  insurance  shall  provide  to  CSSD  proof  of  medical
insurance  coverage  for  the  children  within  20  days  of  this  order.    If  insurance
becomes  unavailable,  the  party  ordered  to  provide  insurance  shall  notify  CSSD

within  20  days.    When  insurance  becomes  available  again,  the  party  ordered  to 
provide  insurance  must  give  CSSD  proof  that  the  children  are  insured  within  20 
days.  The above proof and notice of insurance must be given to the other party 
instead of CSSD if CSSD is not enforcing the order. 
If a party applies for CSSD services:
i.

CSSD  shall  take  whatever  enforcement  action  is  deemed  legally  proper,
including  recommending  contempt  proceedings  against  the  party  ordered  to
pay  support.    Failure  to  pay  support  as  ordered  may  result  in
execution  against  the  property  of  the  obligor  or  arrest  of  the
obligor.

ii.

iii.

Either party may ask CSSD to review the amount of child support. CSSD may
require  that  the  request  be  made  in  writing  on  a  form  specified  by  CSSD.
The  parties  shall  provide  income  information  requested  by  CSSD  in
connection with a review of the amount of child support within 20 days after
the date the request is mailed.

Unless  the  box  below  is  checked,  CSSD  may  issue  a  withholding  order,
pursuant  to  AS  25.27.062  or  AS  25.27.250,  to  attach  funds  owed  to  the
obligor  by  any  corporation  created  by  the  Alaska  Native  Claims  Settlement
Act  (ANCSA)  or  any  settlement  trusts  established  pursuant  to  section  39  of
ANCSA,  codified  at  43  USC  1629e.    Upon  service  of  such  an  order,  the
obligor's  dividends,  distributions  and/or  other  periodic  monetary  benefits  of
ANCSA stock or benefits paid by a settlement trust shall be transferred to the
child  support  obligee  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  withholding  order.    The
ANCSA  corporation  or  settlement  trust  shall  pay  the  funds  so  transferred  to
CSSD for distribution to the child  support obligee.  The obligor is prohibited
from transferring, selling or otherwise alienating his/her ANCSA stock or trust
benefits after CSSD issues a withholding order based on an arrearage.

CSSD is not authorized to issue the withholding order described above 
because

may issue a withholding order if obligor accrues arrears more than two 
times the monthly support obligation under this order.

EFFECT OF ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHT TO CHILD SUPPORT TO STATE
This  order  does  not  bind  the  Child  Support  Services  Division  of  Alaska  or  of  any  other
state to the ordered child support if the person receiving child support is receiving or has
currently  applied  for  public  assistance  and  assigns  his  or  her  rights  to  child  support  to
the  state.    AS  25.27.120-.130.    If  child  support  rights  are  assigned  to  the  state,  any
alternative  arrangement  for  immediate  income  withholding  will  not  be  allowed  unless
approved by CSSD.

APPLICATION FOR PERMANENT FUND DIVIDEND REQUIRED
Unless  the  following  box  is  checked,  the  party  ordered  to  pay  support  is  ordered  to
apply  for  an  Alaska  Permanent  Fund  Dividend  (PFD)  if  he  or  she  is  an  Alaska  resident
and  is  more  than  two  months  in  arrears  as  of  December  31  of  the  previous  year.
[AS  22.10.025(b)]  The  party  shall  submit  a  complete  and  accurate  PFD  application  to
the  Permanent  Fund  Dividend  Division  by  January  15  and  shall  timely  submit  any
supplemental information or documentation requested by the Permanent Fund Dividend

NOTICE TO PARTY WHO IS ORDERED TO PAY SUPPORT (OBLIGOR)

You must pay the amount of support stated in this order.  You cannot give  gifts,
clothes, food, or other things instead of paying this money.

You must pay support on time.  You are not excused from paying even if the other
party denies you visitation with the children.  If you are denied visitation, you can
file  a  motion  to  enforce  visitation  with  the  court,  but  you  must  still  pay  the  child
support.

You  must  pay  child  support  before  your  other  bills  and  debts.    Child  support
payments have priority over most other debts.

If you get married or take on an obligation to support someone else, you must still
make  all  the  payments  ordered  in  this  order.    If  you  fail  to  do  so  and  a  case  is
brought against you to enforce payment, your new obligations will not excuse your
failure to pay.

NOTICE TO BOTH PARTIES
If your situation changes, ask the court to change this order right away.
This child support order is based on:
your current income; and

your current custody and visitation arrangement.


If  either  your  income  or  your  custody  and  visitation  arrangement  changes  significantly 
(for  example,  if  a  child  starts  living  with  a  different  parent),  you  can  ask  the  court  to 
change  the  custody  order  or  child  support  order.    The  court  has  forms  to help  you  do 
this (the DR-700 Packet). 

It  is  very  important  to  ask  the  court  as  soon  as  a  change  occurs  because  child 
support cannot be changed retroactively (that is, a new order cannot cancel the amount 
ordered to be paid in the past). 

Past due amounts continue to remain due even if the person who is owed support does 
not ask for payment (except in the special situation described in Civil Rule 90.3(h)(3)). 
With interest added, these past due amounts can grow into a substantial debt. 

In addition, once a year either party can ask the other party to provide documents such 
as  tax  returns  and  pay  stubs  showing  the  party’s  income  for  the  prior  calendar  year. 
The request must be in writing and the party making it must attach copies of his or her 
own  tax  return  and  pay  stubs  to  the  request.    The  other  party  must  respond  with 
documentation of his or her income within 30 days. (Civil Rule 90.3(e)(2))
