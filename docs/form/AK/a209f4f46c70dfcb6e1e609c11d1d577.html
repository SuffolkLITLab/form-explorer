EXTENDED VISITATION CREDIT. Extended visitation . applies . to this case. . (Primary custody cases only. . ) Primary physical custody of the children was awarded . to one par. ent or custodian. . The other par. ent (the obligor parent. ) was awarded visitation with the children for . certain extended periods of time longer than 27 consecutive days as follows: . If and when . the obligor parent exercises this extended visitation, child support is . reduced for the above period (s) as follows: . This credit may not exceed 75% of the amount owed for the period (Civ. R. 90. 3 (a) (3) ) . and does not apply to. shared, hybrid, or divided physical custody awards. If the obligor . . based on seasonal income. , this credit is based on the average . monthly support amount. If extended visitation is not exercised, child support is not . reduced. . 7.

If this support order takes effect in a low income month, the obligor must pay the . . average monthly amount each month until a high income month is reached, at . . which time the unequal monthly payment schedule will begin. . This order varying the monthly support amount applies only to the support amount . . for the number of children listed on the first line of the chart in paragraph (5) (b) . . When support is no longer owed for the first child. , the seasonal variation in monthly . support amounts. must be recalculated. will be as follows . parent or guardian or a designee of the parent or guardian, unless the following . box is checked: . . Child support will end when each child reaches age . 18. This child support order is suspended for the time periods when the child is . taken into State custody in a child in need of aid case or juvenile delinquency . proceeding and one of the following two conditions exist: (1) the State places . the child with the obligor parent; or (2) this child support order is based on . shared, divided, or hybrid custody. CSSD may redirect or administratively . establish child support as necessary. . . . . 8. VARIATION FROM CIVIL RULE 90. 3 FORMULA. The amount of child support was determined pursuant to: . a. b. . c. . The formula in Civil Rule 90. 3 (a) or (b) . . adjusted annual income . is over $12, 000. . . . pport is less than $600 per year . so $600 minimum was ordered. . O. obligor is: . incarcerated . unable to work because . other . d. . 90. 3 (c) (1) . The court finds good cause upon proof by clear and convincing . evidence that manifest injustice would result if the support award were not . varied. Reason (s) for the variation: . The amount of support which would have been required but for th. is 90. 3 (c) (1) variation is . $ for children per month to be . paid by the . . The estimated value . of any property. conveyed instead of support calculated under 90. 3 is $ . . . 9. MEDICAL SUPPORT ORDER. This order concerns health insurance for the children covered by this child support. . order. It does not concern health insurance for any other children or for the parents. .

A different division is ordered as follows: . . . . iii. The child support calculation in paragraph (5) (b) includes: . A credit of $. per month (50% of the cost to the . obligor) for health insurance purchased for the children by the . obligor. If the obligor fails to purchase the insurance, the . . monthly child support obligation will increase by this amount, . . without further o. rder of the court, until the obligor purchases the . insurance and provides proof of the purchase to the other parent . . and to the Child Support Services Division (CSSD) if CSSD is . . handling collections. . An extra $ . per month (50% of the cost. to the . obligee) for health insurance purchased for the children by the . . obligee. If the obligee fails to purchase the insurance, the . . monthly child support obligation will decrease by this amount, . without further order of the court, until the obligee purch. ases the . insurance and provides proof of the purchase to the other parent . and to the Child Support Services Division (CSSD) if CSSD is . . handling collections. . iv. If the cost of the insurance changes, the amount of the child support. obligation will be adjusted accordingly without further order of the. . court. The parent purchasing the insurance shall provide documentation. . of the change to the other parent and to CSSD if CSSD is handling. . collections. If either parent believes the cost of the insurance has. . become unreasonable, that parent may file a motion asking the court to. . suspend the requirement that insurance be purchased. . v. The parent purchasing the insurance must notify the insurance. . company that the other parent or custodian can apply for benefits on. behalf of the children and should be reimbursed directly. The. purchaser must also provide coverage information to the other parent. . and all forms and instructions necessary to apply for benefits.

The cost of the insurance must be divided . between the parents equally unless a different division of the cost is ordered. . . Without further order of the court, the monthly child support obligation will . . increase by 50% of the cost of the insurance if the obligee purchases it, and . . decrease by 50% of the cost of the insurance if the obligor purchases it, . . unless otherwise ordered. If the parents disagree about whether the cost of . insurance is reasonable or about which insurance policy should be purchased, . either parent may file a motion asking the court to resolve the dispute. . . . . 10.

To the extent these payments to the children do not satisfy the monthly . . amount owed, the remaining amount du. e shall be withheld from the obligor's . income pursuant to AS 25. 27. 062. . The parties agreed on the alternative arrangement described in the attached . . document signed by both parties. (For Modification Order. ) Income withhol. ding . has not been terminated previously and subsequently initiated. . * The court finds good cause not to require immediate income withholding. .

(For Modification Order. ) The previous support order in this case did not require . immediate withholding and CSSD is not enforcing this order. Therefore, income . withholding shall not be initiated until the requirements of AS 25. 27. 062 (c) are . met. . Even if one of the above boxes is checked, exempting the obligor from immediate . income withholding, such withholding may be initiated under AS 25. 27. 062 (c) through . the court or through CSS.

This employment information must be given to the. obligee instead of CSSD if CSSD is not enforcing the order. . f. The party ordered to provide insurance shall provide to CSSD proof of medical. insurance coverage for the children within 20 days of this order. If insurance. becomes unavailable, the party ordered to provide insurance shall notify CSS. D (OBLI. GOR=person paying support) . AS 25. 27. 020, . 062-. . 080 . Page 9 . of 11 DR 303 () CHILD SUPPORT ORDER . (OBLIGEE=person receiving support) . Civil Rule 90. 3. within 20 days. When insurance becomes available again, the party ordered to . provide insurance . must give CSSD proof that the children are insured within 20 . days.

Act (ANCSA) or any settlement trusts established pursuant to section 39 of. ANCSA, codified at 43 USC 1629 e. Upon service of such an order, the. obligor's dividends, distributions and/or other periodic monetary benefits of. ANCSA sto. ck or benefits paid by a settlement trust shall be transferred to the. child support obligee pursuant to the terms of the withholding order. The. ANCSA corporation or settlement trust shall pay the funds so transferred to. . CSSD for distribution to the child support obligee. . The obligor is prohibited. from transferring, selling or otherwise alienating his/her ANCSA stock or trust. . benefits after CSSD issues a withholding order based on an arrearage. . CSSD is not authorized to issue the withholding order described above . because . . However, CSSD . may issue a withholding order if obligor accrues arrears more than two . times the monthly support obligation under this order. . 14. EFFECT OF ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHT TO CHILD SUPPORT TO STATE. This order does not bind the Child Support Services Division of Alaska or of any other. state to the ordered child support if the person receiving child support is receiving or has. currently applied for public assistance and assigns his or her rights to child support to. the state. AS 25. 27. 120-. 130. If child support rights are assigned to the state, any. alternative arrangement for immediate income withholding will not be allowed unless. approved by CSS. D. 15. APPLICATION FOR PERMANENT FUND DIVIDEND REQUIRED. Unless the following box is checked, the party ordered to pay support is ordered to. apply for an Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) if he or she is an Alaska resident. and is more than two months in arrears as of December 31 of the previous year. . [AS 22. 10. 025 (b) ] The party shall submit a complete and accurate PFD application to. the Permanent Fund Dividend Division by January 15 and shall timely submit any. supplemental information or documentation requested by the Permanent Fund Dividend. (OBLI. GOR=person paying support) . AS 25. 27. 020, . 062-. . 080 . Page 10 of 11 DR 303 () CHILD SUPPORT ORDER . (OBLIGEE=person receiving support) . Civil Rule 90. 3. Division. . If the party is not eligible for a dividend, the party must file proof of non-. eligibility with CSSD if CSSD is enforcing this support order. . The party ordered to pay support is not required to apply for an Alaska Permanent . Fund Dividend because: . 16. NOTICE TO PARTY WHO IS ORDERED TO PAY SUPPORT (OBLIGOR) . a. You must pay the amount of support stated in this order. You cannot give gifts, . clothes, food, or other things instead of paying this money. . b. You must pay support on time. You are not excused from paying even if the other. party denies you visitation with the children. If you are denied visitation, you can. file a motion to enforce visitation with the court, but you must still pay the child. support. . c. You must pay child support before your other bills and debts. Child support. payments have priority over most other debts. . d. If you get married or take on an obligation to support someone else, you must still. make all the payments ordered in this order. If you fail to do so and a case is. brought against you to enforce payment, your new obligations will not excuse your. failure to pay. . 17. NOTICE TO BOTH PARTIES. If your situation changes, ask the court to change this order right away. . This child support order is based on: . your current income; and. your current custody and visitation arrangement. . If either your income or your custody and visitation arrangement changes significantly . (for example, if a child starts living with a different parent) , you can ask the court to . . change the custody order or child support order. The court has forms to help yo. u do . this (the DR 700 Packet) . . It is very important to ask the court . as soon as a change occurs. because child . support cannot be changed retroactively (that is, a new order cannot cancel the amount . ordered to be paid in the past) . . Past due amounts continue to remain due even if the person who is owed support does . not ask for payment (except in the special situation described in Civil Rule 90. 3 (h) (3) ) . . . With interest added, these past due amounts can grow into a substantial debt. . In addition, once a year either party can ask the other party to provide documents such . . The request must be in writing and the party making it must attach copies of his or her . own tax return and pay stubs to the request. The other party must respond with . documentation of his or her income within 30 days. (Civil Rule 90. 3 (e) (2) ) . Page . 11 of . 11 DR 303 (3/19) . (OBLI. GOR=person paying support) .

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields and Utilization:<sup>*</sup></h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. New names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them.
