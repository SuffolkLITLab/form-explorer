EXECUTION  PROCEDURE 

he procedure described in this booklet can  only be used to seize the debtor's permanent fund 
dividend (PFD), not to seize other property of the debtor.    For information about seizing other 
property,  you  should  read  Execution  Procedure:    Judgment  Creditor  Booklet    (CIV-550), 
available from the court. 
 

Priority of Claims Against A Debtor's PFD 

he  Alaska  Statutes  give  certain  claims  against  the  PFD  priority  over  other  claims.    AS 
43.23.065(b).    For  example,  claims  for  child  support,  restitution  in  criminal  cases,  delinquent 
student loans, and criminal fines have priority (in that order) over other claims. 

laims based on a judgment in a civil or small claims case are processed after any higher priority 
claims have been satisfied.  If more than one claim with the same priority is received, they are 
processed on a first come first served basis. 
 

When Can A Writ Be Served? 

 writ of execution to seize a PFD cannot be served on the Department of Revenue before April 
1 of the dividend year.  Writs received before April 1 will be applied to the prior year's dividend.  
The Department recommends that writs of execution be received by the Department  by the end 
of  August  to  ensure  that  there  will  be time  to match  them  against  all  PFD  applications  before 
distribution of dividends begins.  

f you want to execute on the debtor's permanent fund dividend, do the following: 

TEP 1:   OBTAIN  IDENTIFYING  INFORMATION  ABOUT  DEBTOR 

efore the Department of Revenue can take money from a person's PFD, the Department must 
be  able  to  positively  identify  the  debtor.    The  Department's  regulations  require  a  three-point 
match  between  the  Department's  records  and  information  you  provide  about  the  debtor.    You 
must provide an exact match for any three of the following identifiers: 

  T

  T

  C

  A

  I

    S

  B

  1

.  first name, 

2.  date of birth, 

3.  social security number, or 

4.  last name. 

(The Department's regulation is 15 AAC 23.213(d).) 

CIV-503 (3/18)

STEP 2:   CHOOSE  TYPE   OF  SERVICE 

 

ou can use certified mail or a process server to serve a writ of execution on the PFD.  Certified 
mail  is  less  expensive,  but  you  cannot  be  sure  of  the  date  it  will  be  delivered  to  the  PFD 
Division.  If it is important to you that your writ be delivered to the PFD Division at the earliest 
possible time (April 1) in order to get priority over other possible claims, you will probably want 
to use a process server.  (Be sure to ask the process server if your writ will be served on April 1.) 

ell the clerk what type of service you plan to use so the clerk can give you the correct forms to 

fill out.   

TEP  2a:   CERTIFIED  MAIL 

f you want the writ served by certified mail, do the following: 

.  Complete  Form  CIV-506,  Information  for  Issuance  of  Writ  of  Execution  on  PFD  or 

Garnishment of Earnings. 

Please  type  or  print  clearly  when  filling  out  the  form.    USE  BLACK  INK.    Fill  out  entire 
form.  Be sure to include in the cost section the cost of serving this writ: the court's certified 
mail fee plus postage. The service by certified mail fee is listed in Administrative Rule 9. A 
writ fee will be charged for each writ issued.  You must file a separate writ request for each 
debtor.1 

.  Prepare a business-size white envelope for certified mail for each writ as follows: 

a.  Address the envelope to: 

  DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE 
 
 
 

PFD DIVISION ACCOUNTING AND COLLECTIONS UNIT 
PO BOX 110463 
JUNEAU AK 99811-0463 

b.  Put your return address in the upper left corner. 

c.  Fill out a Receipt For Certified Mail.  See example on page 7.  Attach the sticker portion 

next to your return address at the top of the envelope.   

d.  Beneath the certified mail sticker on the envelope, write "Return Receipt Requested."

CIV-503 (3/18)

●  In the "Article Addressed To" box, fill in the address of the PFD Division as noted in 

paragraph 2.a above.  Also, write the total postage amount.  
●  In the "Article Number" box, write the certified mail number.  
●  In the "Service Type" box, check "Certified Mail." 

  Do NOT attach the green card to the envelope. 

f.  Put  required  postage on the envelope to  pay for first class mail, the certified fee and the 

return receipt fee. 

See pages 6-7 for sample envelope and certified mail forms. 

.  Take the form, envelope with completed Receipt for Certified Mail, and green postal receipt 
card to the clerk.  You must pay  the certified mail fee to the clerk. The service by certified 
mail fee is listed in Administrative Rule 9. 

he  clerk  will  prepare  the  writ  of  execution  and  mail  it  to  the  Department  of  Revenue.    The 
green  postal  receipt  card  will  be  returned  to  you.    Be  sure  to  keep  the  card  as  proof  that  the 
Department of Revenue received the writ.    The Receipt for Certified Mail will be kept by the 
clerk of court with the writ. 

●  Fill in your name and address so the card will be returned to you. 
●  Write the case number in the lower left corner.

TEP 2b:   SERVICE  BY  PROCESS  SERVER 

f you want the writ served by a process server, do the following: 

.  Complete Form CIV-501, Information for Issuance of General Writ of Execution for service 

of process on the PFD office. 

Please type or print clearly when filling out the forms.  USE BLACK INK.  Fill out the entire 
form. A writ fee will be charged for each writ issued.2  

.  Choose a process server.  The Department of Public Safety has a list of all the process servers 
in the state.  You may choose any of them.   However, the PFD  Division has informed the 
Court  System  that  it  will  only  accept  writs  served  at  a  PFD  office  or  another  office 
specifically authorized to receive writs for the division.  The PFD Division only has full-time 
offices in Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau.  If you select a process server who charges more 
than $20 to travel to a PFD office, you will not be able to recover the additional travel costs 
from the debtor.  See paragraph 3 below.

CIV-503 (3/18)

If  the  process  server  is  not  in  your  community,  you  must  give  the  court  an  envelope 
addressed  to  the  process  server  with  sufficient  postage  so  the  clerk  can  mail  the  writ  and 
service instructions to the process server. 

.  Contact the process server to determine the service fee.  Pay the fee directly to the process 
server  unless  the  process  server  is  not  in  your  community.    In  that  case,  make  your  check 
payable to the process server but give it to the clerk to mail with the writ.  Fees are set by the 
individual process server.  However, the maximum amount you may recover as costs from 
the debtor is $65 ($45 for service plus $20 for travel).  Administrative Rule 11. 

.  Fill out Service Instructions (use either the court form CIV-560 or the process server's form) 
explaining  where  the  papers  should  be  served.    You  must  include  in  the  service 
instructions the identifying information about the debtor described in Step 1.  See page 
8 for sample filled-out form. 

.  Return the forms to the clerk.  The clerk will  prepare the writ and deliver it to the process 

server.  You will be notified by the process server when the writ has been served.  

TEP 3:   PROOF OF SERVICE 

.  Certified Mail 

If the writ is served by certified mail, the green postal receipt card will be returned to you.  
Be sure to keep the card as proof that the writ was served.  

If the envelope is returned to you (for example, because of insufficient postage or an error in 
the address), you must take it to the clerk with a new envelope so the clerk can reissue the 
writ.  

.  Process Server 

If  the  writ  is  served  by  a  process  server,  the  process  server  should  notify  you  when  it  is 
served.  You should contact the process server directly if you have any questions. 

TEP 4:   NOTICE  TO  DEBTOR  AND  COLLECTION  OF  MONEY 

ou will not know whether money is seized on the execution until the PFD checks are issued, 
which usually happens in October and November.   In some cases, you will have to wait several 
weeks after November to find out if your writ of execution was successful.  This is because the 
PFD  Division  will still be reviewing some applications to decide whether the applicant should 
get a dividend.  That review may take several months, and your writ will not take effect until the 
PFD Division decides whether the debtor gets a dividend.

The  Department  of  Revenue  will  send  the  seized  funds  to  the  court.    The  Department  will 
also  send  the  debtor  notice  of  the  seizure.    The  debtor  has  30  days  in  which  to  file  an 
objection with the court if a mistake has been made.  The court will notify you if a hearing is 
scheduled on the debtor's objection. 

If no objection is filed or if the court finds no mistake has been made, the court will send you 
a check for the amount received from the Department of Revenue. 

.  If No Funds Are Seized 

The  Department  gives  process  servers  and  the  court  system’s  administrative  office  lists  of 
writs of execution that were not paid.  The reason for non-payment is either because: 

●  The identifying information you provided about the debtor did not match any applicant 

for this year’s dividend, or 

●  There  is  no  money  available  from  the  debtor's  PFD  (for  example,  because  the  debtor's 

PFD has already been seized to pay another debt). 

The court system’s administrative office combines these “no-pay” lists with lists of payments 
received (“pay” lists) and produces a “Public List of PFD Attachments.” 

If your writ was served by a process server, contact your process server directly if you have 
any questions.  If your writ was served by certified mail and you do not receive any money 
by January, check the court’s website as described below. 

f  you  want  to  know  whether  the  court  received  any  money,  go  to  court  system’s  website  at 
www.courts.alaska.gov/trialcourts/pfd.htm to see the “Public List of PFD Attachments.”  The list 
for most of the current year’s attachments (those done in October and November) should be on 
the website by the end of December.  The list includes both successful and unsuccessful attempts 
to take PFDs.  Debtors are listed in alphabetical order by last name.  If your case is not listed in 
the  “Public  List,”  ask  to  see  your  case  file  so  you  can  look  for  information  about  attachments 
processed after the list was prepared. 

ecause of the large volume of  executions, most courts cannot respond to telephone inquiries.  

Please do not call the court for this information.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
