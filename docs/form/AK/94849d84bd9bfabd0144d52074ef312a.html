HOW TO CALCULATE CHILD SUPPORT 

Introduction 

n divorce and dissolution cases involving children, child support must be paid, even if the parents 
might agree otherwise.  Support is paid on behalf of the children, not for the benefit of the parent.   

n Civil Rule 90.3, the Alaska Supreme Court set the guidelines that courts must follow to 
determine the amount of child support.  The rule and its commentary are available online at  
https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/rules/docs/civ.pdf. 

o comply with the rule, each parent must provide information, under oath, about their income and 
must attach documentation verifying that information.  See Civil Rule 90.3(e).  In dissolution cases, 
the information must be provided in the Petition form, DR-105.  In divorce cases, it should be 
provided on form DR-305, Child Support Guidelines Affidavit. 

n both dissolutions and divorces, one more form must be attached if one of the following types of 
child custody is chosen: 
 

  Shared Physical Custody.  Attach DR-306, Shared Custody Child Support Calculation.  See 

  Divided  Physical  Custody.    Attach  DR-307,  Divided  Custody  Child  Support  Calculation.  

  Hybrid Physical Custody.  Attach DR-308, Hybrid Custody Child Support Calculation.  See 

pages 16-21. 

See pages 22-23. 

pages 24-27. 

See pages 7-8 for an explanation of the four different types of physical custody. 

.  Instructions for DR-305 Affidavit and child support section of DR-105 Petition 

See the sample, filled-out DR-305 form on pages 13-15. 

1.  Gross Income and Deductions. 

 

First, make copies of your most recent federal tax return (including W2) and paycheck stubs 
so you can attach them to your Petition or Affidavit.  If you have other documents that verify 
your income or deductions, attach copies of them too.  Delete your social security number 
and any financial account numbers from these documents.  If you need to identify financial 
accounts by number, use only the last three digits of the account number and the name of the 
financial institution. 

econd, check the box indicating whether the information you fill in will be monthly or 

yearly.  This is important in order to make the math calculations in the forms work correctly.  
If your work is seasonal, show yearly income. 

hird, fill in paragraphs A and B as follows: 

Paragraph A--Gross Income. 

In order to set child support, the court must try to predict the parents' income for the 
foreseeable future.  The best indicator of that is usually the parents' current income and most 
recent past income.  However, if you think your future income or the other parent’s future 
income will be significantly different from current income, you should state expected future 
income and attach an explanation justifying it to the court.

Be sure to include all sources of income, whether the type of income is listed on the form or 
not.  Please read section III of the commentary to the rule for a list of many of the sources of 
income you should consider.  Do not include ATAP (Alaska Temporary Assistance 
Program), SSI (Supplemental Security Income), or Food Stamps. 

"Gross wages" means wages before any money is deducted for taxes, retirement, or anything 
else. 

"Value of employer-provided housing/food/etc." means the dollar value of benefits like free 
housing, meals, use of a car, COLA, BAH, BAS, etc., that your employer gives you.   
It should be listed if the amount is significant and reduces your living expenses.  It does not 
include employer-provided health insurance benefits.   

Note that if a person is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed, the court may determine 
the person's potential income and use that to calculate child support.  See paragraph (a)(4) of 
the rule and section III.C of the commentary to the rule. 

Paragraph B--Deductions. 

Civil Rule 90.3(a)(1) allows only a limited and specific number of deductions.  See the 
discussion of this portion of the rule in section III.D of the commentary. 

Keep in mind that it is your expected future expenses that the court must predict and that 
these expenses may be different from your current expenses.  For example, your federal 
income taxes may be different because, rather than filing a joint return, you may be filing a 
separate return as a "single person" or as "head of household."  Also, child care expenses 
may increase if the custodial parent has to work full-time. 

Mandatory Deductions.  Most of the deductions are for mandatory items which reduce your 
income and that you have no choice about paying, like taxes, union dues, mandatory 
retirement contributions, and the Supplemental Benefits System (SBS) contributions that 
Alaska state employees are required to make. 

Voluntary Retirement Contributions.  A deduction is allowed for one optional, non-
mandatory item: “voluntary contributions to a retirement or pension plan or account in 
which the earnings are tax-free or tax-deferred, except that the total amount of these 
voluntary contributions plus any mandatory contributions [to a retirement or pension plan] 
may not exceed 7.5% of the parent’s gross wages and self-employment income.”  See 
section III.D of the commentary for examples of some plans that qualify for voluntary 
contributions.  Note that the maximum total deduction for voluntary contributions to a tax-
free or tax-deferred retirement or pension plan plus mandatory contributions combined is 
7.5% of gross wages (or self-employment income).  Do not include other sources of income 
(such as investment income) in this calculation.  

Parent’s Health Insurance Deduction. You may deduct a limited amount of your own out-of-
pocket health insurance premiums.  The total amount deducted may not be more than 10% 
of your gross wages and self-employment income.

Examples: 

Parent A has a mandatory retirement plan at work in which he is 
required to contribute 1.5% of his gross wages.  His gross wages are 
$40,000 per year, so his mandatory retirement contribution is $600 per 
year (.015 x 40,000).  He can list $600 on the “Mandatory retirement 
contribution” line.  Parent A also set up an IRA (Individual Retirement 
Account) to which he contributes $3,000 every year.  So, Parent A can 
also take a “voluntary retirement deduction” of $2,400 per year.   
Note:  This is because the $3,000 he contributes is more than the 
maximum amount of the deduction he is allowed.  (His maximum 
voluntary deduction is .075 x $40,000 = $3,000, minus the $600 
mandatory contribution.) 

Parent B’s employer has no mandatory retirement plan for employees, but 
does offer an optional 401(k) Plan (a qualified plan under the IRS Code). 
Parent B contributes $4,000 every year to her 401(k) account.  Parent B’s 
gross wages are $60,000 per year.  Therefore, Parent B can take a 
“voluntary retirement deduction” of $4,000 per year (because the $4,000 
she contributes is less than the maximum amount of the deduction she is 
allowed (.075 x $60,000 =$ 4,500)). 

pousal Support (Alimony) in Other Cases. 

One of the allowed deductions is for spousal support ordered in other cases and currently 
being paid. To claim this deduction, there must be a court order or administrative order 
requiring you to pay the spousal support and you must actually be paying it. 

hild Support for Prior Children.   

Another allowed deduction is for child support for prior children of a different relationship 
that was ordered.  This deduction may not be greater than the amount of support that would 
be calculated under Civil Rule 90.3(a)(2).  “Prior children” includes children from a 
different relationship who were born or adopted before the children in this case.   

In addition, a deduction is allowed for “in-kind” support for prior children of a different 
relationship calculated under Civil Rule 90.3(a)(1)(D).  “In-kind” means support contributed 
for the prior children that is not a direct payment to the other parent or an agency.  

For more information and some examples showing how the prior child deduction is 
calculated, see the diagram called Calculating Prior Child Deduction online at: 
https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-wfd-prior-child-deduct.pdf. 

Parent’s Health Insurance. 

Another allowed deduction is for a parent’s health insurance cost, up to 10% of wages and 
self-employment income.  The effective date for this deduction was April 16, 2018, and is 
authorized by Civil Rule 90.3(a)(1)(F).   

Paragraph C--Net Income. 

 

 

Fill in the totals from the above two sections, then subtract Total Deductions from Total

Find the Adjusted Annual Income for each parent which you calculated in the previous step. 
If you are using the DR-105 Petition, fill in that amount in section VIII.A.1.a.  Then, fill in 
VIII.A.1.b. as explained on the form.  To fill in section VIII.A.2 (or paragraph E on the DR-
305  Affidavit),  multiply  the  Adjusted  Annual  Income  by  whichever  one  of  the  following 
numbers applies to your situation:   

 
Example: 

If the Adjusted Annual Income for one parent is $20,000 and there are 
two children, multiply $20,000 by .27 to get the amount to fill in on that 
parent’s Annual Child Support line ($5,400). 

 

If there were four children in the above example, the number to multiply  
by would be: 

.33 plus .03 = .36 

The calculation would be:   

$20,000 x .36 = $7,200 

djusted Annual Income Over  $126,000  

In the above calculation, the Adjusted Annual Income is limited to $126,000.  However, the 
court may sometimes order a higher child support amount.  Civil Rule 90.3(c)(2) states that 
the court “may make an additional award only if it is just and proper, taking into account the 
needs of the children, the standard of living of the children and the extent to which that 
standard should reflect the supporting parent’s ability to pay.” 

f you believe the amount of child support should be increased above the amount calculated 
by using the $126,000 limit, you should use section VIII.A.6 on page 13 of the DR-105 
Petition to explain why this should be done and what the child support amount should be.  
Be sure to cross out the second sentence in the paragraph before writing your explanation.

If the result of the above multiplication is less than $600, write $600 on the “ANNUAL 
CHILD SUPPORT” line instead of the result of the multiplication.  Civil Rule 90.3(c)(3) 
states that the minimum child support amount that may be ordered is $50 per month ($600 
per year) with a few exceptions.  (The exceptions are:  during “extended visitation” months 
and in the final calculations in shared, divided and hybrid custody cases.)  Find Civil Rule 
90.3 and commentary VI.C. at: https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/rules/docs/civ.pdf 
 
Monthly Child Support Payment. 

You must check one of the four boxes (primary, shared, divided, or hybrid custody) and fill 
in the lines.  Which box you check depends on your agreement about who will have 
physical custody of the children. 
 
Deciding "physical custody" means deciding which parent the children will live with.1  

 

or purposes of child support, there are four possible physical custody arrangements: 

 
Primary physical custody means the children live with one parent more than 70% of 
the year.  Check the primary custody box if this is your arrangement. 

Shared physical custody means the children live with each parent for at least 30% of 
each year.  Check the shared custody box if this is your arrangement. 

Divided physical custody means each parent has primary custody (as defined above) 
of at least one child, and the parents do not share custody of any of their children.  
Check the divided custody box if this is your arrangement. 
 
Hybrid physical custody means at least one parent has primary custody of at least 
one of the children, and the parents share custody of at least one of the children.  
Check the hybrid custody box if this is your arrangement. 

Remember that it is physical custody (where the children live) that matters for child support, 
not legal custody.

1  Note that, as explained in your dissolution instructions, physical custody and legal custody are separate 

concepts. Legal custody refers to a parent who is awarded legal custody has the right and responsibility to 
decide questions regarding the child's best interests (decision making custody). Physical custody refers to a 
parent who has physical custody of a child when the child resides with that parent.

ox One:  Primary Physical Custody. 

In a primary custody arrangement, the parent who will pay is the one who will have physical 
custody of the children less than 30% of the year.  The monthly amount owed is the Annual 
Child Support amount for that parent (from the previous section) divided by 12 (months).   

Example: 

Parent B has primary physical custody of the three children of the 
marriage.  Parent A’s adjusted annual income is $25,000.   

Annual child support Parent A will pay = $25,000 x .33 = $8,250 

Monthly child support = $8,250  12 = $687.50 

ox Two:  Shared Physical Custody. 

If you check this box, you will need to fill out form DR-306, Shared Custody Child Support 
Calculation, before you can fill in the child support amount.  The instructions for this form 
begin on page 16. 

Box Three:  Divided Physical Custody. 

If you check this box, you will need to fill out form DR-307, Divided Custody Child 
Support Calculation, before you can fill in the child support amount.  The instructions for 
this form begin on page 22. 

Box Four:  Hybrid Physical Custody. 

If you check this box, you will need to fill out form DR-308, Hybrid Custody Child Support 
Calculation, before you can fill in the child support amount.  The instructions for this form 
begin on page 24.

The court is required by law to include a medical support order in the child support order if 
health care coverage is available for the children at a reasonable cost.  However, before 
ordering that health insurance be purchased, the court must consider whether the children 
are eligible for health care services from the Indian Health Service or some other entity 
(such as the military) at no charge.  Although one parent may be ordered to purchase the 
insurance, the cost of it must be shared between the parents.  This is done by adjusting the 
amount of child support upward or downward.  Civil Rule 90.3(d)(1). 

For more information about how to calculate the cost of the children’s health insurance for 
child support, see the diagram called Calculating the Cost of Child(ren)’s Health Insurance 
online at https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-wfd-child-health-ins.pdf. 

Health Insurance for the Children 

If the children are not eligible for services from the Indian Health Service or some similar 
health coverage, and if health insurance for the children is available to either parent at a 
reasonable cost (for example through your employer or union), the parent who has the 
insurance available must purchase it.  If both parents have such insurance available, you 
must agree (or the court must decide) which one of you will purchase it.  The cost must be 
divided equally between you unless you can show the court there is a good reason why it 
should be divided differently.  In section VIII.A.4.a on page 12 of the Petition (section G.1 
of the Affidavit), you must indicate who has such insurance available for the children, who 
will purchase it, and how the cost will be divided between you.

List only the cost to insure the children involved in this case.  Do not include the cost of 
insuring a parent or any other children who may live in the household.  If there is no extra 
cost to the parent to include the children in the parent’s insurance coverage, none of the cost 
can be allocated to the children.  If there is an extra cost to add dependants and the policy 
covers dependants in addition to the children and you do not know the cost for the children 
alone, calculate the amount to put on this line as follows:  Divide the monthly cost of the 
insurance (the extra cost for the dependants) by the number of dependants insured.  Then 
multiply that number by the number of children involved in this case.  See Civil Rule 
90.3(d)(1). 

or more information about how to calculate the cost of the children’s health insurance for 
child support, see the diagram called Calculating the Cost of Child(ren)’s Health Insurance 
online at https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-wfd-child-health-ins.pdf. 

 
xamples: 

There are two children who will be the subjects of this child support order. 
Parent A is paying support.  The children are covered by the insurance policy 
provided by Parent A’s employer. 

1. 

2. 

Parent A pays $70 per month and employer pays $900 per month for the 
policy that covers Parent A and all of Parent A’s dependents.  In this 
example, the cost does not increase if more children are added to the 
coverage, and it does not decrease if there are no dependents.  Parent A is 
required by the employer to have this insurance covering dependents.  
Parent A does not have the option to select insurance covering himself 
alone.  The $70 counts as towards Parent A’s own out-of-pocket health 
insurance expenses which can be factored into his adjusted income; 
however, Parent A cannot adjust for the $70 as part of the child’s 
healthcare expenses.  

Parent A’s employer lets him choose to buy either a policy covering just 
himself or a policy covering himself and all of his dependents.  The 
insurance costs Parent A $100 per month for just himself and $160 per 
month if any dependents are covered.  The cost for covering dependents 
does not change if dependents are added or subtracted.  Parent A selects 
the “dependents coverage” policy and lists both children and his new 
spouse as dependents (2 children + new spouse = 3 dependents).  The extra 
cost for dependents is $60. The amount attributable to the children is $40 
(2/3 x $60).  Parent A can deduct half of that ($20) from his monthly child 
support payment as part of his adjustment for the child’s healthcare 
expense.  (Note: Parent A may also deduct up to 10% of his gross wages 
and self-employment income for his own health insurance premium.) 

hildren’s Uninsured Health Care Expenses 

In section VIII.A.4.b on page 12 of the Petition (section G.2 of the Affidavit), you must 
describe your agreement about how you will share the cost of the children’s health care 
expenses that are not covered by insurance.  Braces are one example of this type of expense.  
Civil Rule 90.3(d)(2) requires the court to divide such expenses between the parents equally 
unless a good reason is shown for dividing them differently or unless the expenses are more 
than $5,000 in a calendar year.  The rule requires that reasonable expenses exceeding $5,000 
per calendar year must be allocated based on the parents' relative financial circumstances 
when the expenses occur.  If, in the future, the children's uninsured expenses exceed $5,000 
and you cannot agree on how to divide them, you will have to file a motion with the court.  
If you believe that uncovered expenses under $5,000 should be divided unequally, check the 
second box and explain why (for example, a substantial difference in the parents' financial 
circumstances).  See section VII of the commentary about reimbursement procedure.

Monthly  Child  Support  Payment  (after  adding  or  subtracting  the  children’s  health
insurance costs).

In section VIII.A.5 on page 13 of the Petition (section H of the Affidavit), you must either 
increase or decrease the amount of child support owed, depending on who is purchasing the 
children’s insurance and how the cost will be divided between you.   

For example, if the obligor (the person paying child support) will buy insurance for the 
children costing $100 per month and you have agreed that the obligor will pay half the cost, 
you should write $50 on line 5b and subtract it from the amount on line 5a in order to get the 
net amount due on line 5d.  If you instead agreed that the obligor will pay 70% of the cost, 
then the amount to subtract on line 5b would be $30. 

Civil Rule 90.3(d)(1) requires that child support be adjusted only for insurance payments 
that are actually made.  Therefore, the child support order will state that if these payments 
are not made, the monthly child support amount due will return to what it was before the 
adjustment. 

7.

Request for Different Child Support Amount.

This section applies to the DR-105 petition.  It does not apply to the DR-305 affidavit.  

You may fill in this section of the Petition if you believe the child support amount should be 
different from what is shown in section VIII.A.5 on page 13 of the Petition. 

As stated in Civil Rule 90.3(c)(1), the court may increase or decrease the amount of child 
support if the court finds that unusual circumstances exist that require the change "in order 
to award an amount of support which is just and proper for the parents to contribute toward 
the nurture and education of their children."  The following are the examples of "unusual 
circumstances" listed in the commentary to the rule: 

-  especially large family size 
-  significant income of a child 
-  health or other extraordinary expenses 
-  unusually low expenses 

See section VI.B of the commentary.  In deciding whether there are "unusual circumstances" 
which justify increasing or decreasing the amount of child support, the court must consider 
the custodial parent's income as well as the non-custodial parent's income. 

Before the court can change the child support amount based on unusual circumstances, the 
court must be shown "proof by clear and convincing evidence that manifest injustice would 
result if the support award" is not changed. 

Please read the discussion of the "Unusual Circumstances" exception in section VI.B of the 
commentary to Civil Rule 90.3. 

8. Seasonal Income

If the income of the parent who will pay child support is seasonal (such as income from 
commercial fishing), it may be easier for that parent to pay higher child support amounts 
during the high-income months, and lower amounts during the low-income months.  On the 
DR-305 Affidavit, check the “yes” or “no” box.  On the DR-105 Petition, fill out this section 
if both parents agree that you want to do this. Note that this does not change the total annual 
amount due.  It just allows different amounts to be paid in different months.  See Civil Rule 
90.3(c)(5) and commentary section VI.F.  

DR-310 (4/18) 

10 

The court must not order seasonal differences in payments unless it finds that the burden of 
budgeting for periods of unequal income should be placed on the obligee (the person 
receiving the payments) rather than the obligor (the person making the payments).  Also, the 
court must not order it unless the obligee agrees to it.  If unequal monthly payments are 
ordered, they must begin in a “high payment” month, not a “low payment” month.  Until a 
“high payment” month occurs, the obligor pays the average monthly amount. 

Example: 

The annual child support amount owed by Parent A (the obligor) is 
$7,200.  Parent A’s main income comes from commercial fishing, with 
most income earned during the months of April through September.  
Ordinarily, Parent A would be ordered to pay $600 per month ($7,200 
 12).  However, the parents agree that, because of the seasonal nature 
of Parent A’s income, Parent A should pay $1,000 per month from 
April through September and $200 per month from October through 
March (total annual amount = $7,200). 
Note:  If the order is entered during a low-payment month (October-
March), the court must order the average monthly payment ($600) 
through March, then $1,000 payments from April through September, 
and then $200 payments the following October – March. 

9.

Signature Section of DR-305 Affidavit.

After filling in section I of the Affidavit, you must sign it under oath in front of a notary 
public, court clerk, or other person authorized to administer oaths.  Remember that when 
you sign the affidavit under oath you are swearing that all the information you provided is 
the truth.  There is no charge when you get your affidavit notarized at the court.  Bring a 
photo ID with you to prove your identity.  The information on the DR-105 Petition is also 
being given under oath, but the signature section of that form is several pages later. 

10.

Extended Visitation Credit.  Civil Rule 90.3(a)(3).

If you checked box one, "primary custody," in section VIII.A.3 on page 11 of your Petition, 
you may be able to make the following additional change in child support.  In the primary 
physical custody situation, the parent paying child support may be allowed to reduce child 
support payments during any period when that parent takes physical custody of the children 
for over 27 days in a row (consecutive days).   

Example:  Parent A is the obligor parent (the one who pays support) and Parent A 
has physical custody of the children for the month of July (31 days).  This might 
allow Parent A to have an “extended visitation credit” for that time.  Note:  if the 
children spend brief periods of time with Parent B during this extended visitation 
period, including occasional overnights, the visitation credit may still be available to 
Parent A.  See section IV.B of the commentary for more information.  

The court may (but does not have to) allow a reduction in child support for that period to 
take into account the added expenses for the obligor parent and the reduced expenses for the 
non-obligor parent.   

Child support can only be reduced a maximum of 75% for an extended visitation period.  It 
cannot be eliminated because some expenses (such as rent) of the parent with primary 
custody will continue even when the children are not there.  Note that paragraph (c)(1) of 
the rule (allowing the court to make exceptions to the rule) applies to the calculation of this 
credit just like it applies to other calculations in the rule.   

DR-310 (4/18) 

11 

To qualify for the extended visitation credit, the parents must specify in section VII on page 
10 of their Petition the dates of the extended visitation period, and the obligor parent must 
actually take physical custody as agreed.  Also, the court's order must be specific about the 
amount of reduction allowed. 

If you want the child support payment to be reduced for a particular period of time because 
of this "extended visitation credit," you must tell the court the amount of the reduction and 
the months when it should occur.  You can use section VIII.A.10 on page 14 of the Petition 
to do this.

B.  Instructions for Form DR-306, Shared Custody Child Support Calculation 

You need to fill out this form only if you decide on a "shared physical custody" arrangement. 
This means that each parent has the children at least 30% (almost 4 months) of the year. 

A specific visitation schedule showing the 30% custody must be written in your petition (or 
divorce decree).  Ordinarily, for a day of visitation to count towards the required 30%, the 
children must remain overnight with that parent.  (30% would be 110 overnights.)  However, the 
court is allowed to use other methods of calculating the percentages of custody when counting 
overnights does not give an accurate picture of the costs of custody for each parent.  For 
example, a court might find that the 30% requirement is met if a parent has the children for 24 
hours on the weekend (noon Saturday to noon Sunday) and 9.5 hours each weekday (7:30 a.m. 
to 5 p.m.).  Although there is only one overnight each week in this example, the total number of 
hours per week (71.5) is over 42% of the total number of hours in a week (168 hours).  Please 
read about Shared Custody in section V of the Civil Rule 90.3 commentary. 

See the sample, filled-out DR-306 form on page 21. 

Line 1. 

Line 2. 

Fill in the adjusted annual income amounts for both parents from either: 

-  
-  

form DR-305, page 2, section D; or 
form DR-105, page 4, section II.D 

Note:  If the income amount is over $126,000, use $126,000 as the amount. 

On the "x

Then calculate the "annual child support" amount for each parent by multiplying the amount 
on line 1 by the decimal number you just filled in. 

Note:  If the result is less than $600, write $600 on the line instead of the amount calculated. 

Example:   Father’s adjusted annual income is $30,000. 
Mother’s adjusted annual income is $20,000. 
They will share custody of their one child.

Fill in the percentage of time the father will have physical custody and the percentage of 
time the mother will have physical custody.  In order to show how you arrived at these 
percentages, you will have to specify in section VII (the visitation section) on page 10 of 
your Petition for Dissolution the dates when the children will reside with each parent. 

DR-310 (4/18) 

16 

Example:   Father has physical custody the first week in April (7 days), June 1 

through August 31 (92 days) and December 26 through January 5 (11 
days).  Total = 110 days or 30% of the year.  (110  365 = .3013)   

  Mother has physical custody the rest of the year (70%).   

 

Fill in 70% on mother's line and 30% on father's line.   

 
Note:  These percentages can be changed by the court if the court finds that "the percentage 
of time each parent will have physical custody will not accurately reflect the ratio of funds 
each parent will directly spend on supporting the children."  Civil Rule 90.3(b)(1)(B).  If you 
think the percentages should be changed in your case, please bring this to the court's 
attention by attaching a sheet to your form DR-306 explaining why they should be changed.  

On the father's line, write the percentage of time the mother will have custody. 

On the mother's line, write the father's percentage.

time the children live with the second parent.) 

Example:  Assume the following:

of the time. 

Mother's annual child support amount is $4,000 and she has custody 
70% of the time.

Subtract the smaller amount on line 5 from the larger amount.  Write the difference on line 6 
in the column with the larger line 5 amount.  Leave the other column blank. 

The person with the larger line 5 amount is the person who will pay child support.  The 
amount to be paid will be calculated in the next step. 

Example:  Using the figures in the above example: 

 

 

   FATHER 

   MOTHER 

Line 5.  

    $4,200    

   $1,200    

 

 

Line 6.  
 
 

    $3,000  
 
(4,200 - 1,200) 

              

 

  

Multiply the amount on line 6 by 1.5.  The line in one column will be blank. 

As explained in section V.B of the commentary, the reason the rule requires you to multiply 
by 1.5 is because it is assumed that the total funds of both parents necessary to support the 
children will be substantially greater when physical custody is shared than when it is not. 

Example:  Using the figures in the above example: 

 

   FATHER 

  MOTHER 

 

 

    $3,000     

    $4,500      
 
($3,000 x 1.5)

Line 7. 
   

      

 

   

 

 

 

  

The person with an amount written on line 7 is the person who will pay child support (the 
"obligor").  However, the rule requires that the support amount not exceed the amount the 
obligor would have owed if it was a “primary custody” situation.  Therefore, you must 
compare the line 7 amount with the amount on that person's line 2 (the "primary custody 
amount").  Write the smaller of line 7 or line 2 on line 8.

ote: For this comparison, you can reduce the actual amount on line 2 by whatever 
"extended visitation credit" would be appropriate if you had elected primary custody 
instead of shared custody.  The "extended visitation credit" is explained in section 10 on 
page 11.

Example: 

In the example above, the amount for the father on line 2 is $6,000. 
However, the father will have physical custody of the children for the 
entire months of June, July and August.  If these parents were calculating 
child support as if the mother had primary custody rather than using the 
shared custody calculations, the father would have been entitled to an 
extended visitation credit up to 75% of the amount owed for the 3 months. 

 
 

 

 

 

The monthly amount owed would have been: 

 

$6,000  12 = $500 

The maximum credit the court might allow per month is $500 x .75 = 
$375.  So, the credit for the 3 months = 3 x $375 = $1125. 

Therefore, for purposes of this comparison of line 2 and line 7, these 
parents could use a revised line 2 amount of $6,000 - $1125 = $4875. 

In this example, the credit will not make a difference because line 7 
($4,500) is still smaller than the reduced line 2.  

 
 

 

 

 
The extended visitation credit cannot be used for any other purpose if shared custody 
is elected. 
Line 9. 

Fill in the number of months in which payments will be made.  This will be 12 unless the 
obligor parent (the one who must pay support) will have physical custody for periods of 30 
consecutive days or more.  If the obligor will have such periods of “extended custody,” the 
obligor can choose to either make payments in all 12 months or make payments only in 
those months when he/she does not have “extended custody.”  The annual amount due does 
not change.  So, if the obligor chooses not to make payments during the “extended custody” 
months, he/she will pay more during the other months.  (The annual amount due will be 
divided by a smaller number of months, so each payment will be higher than it would have 
been if the annual amount were divided by 12.)  If the obligor chooses to do this, fill in on 
line 9 the number of months when the obligor parent will not have extended custody 
(custody for periods of 30 consecutive days or more).

Example: 

The father in the above example has physical custody for an extended 
period from June 1 through August 31 in addition to two other shorter 
periods.  He will not pay child support during the three months (June, 
July and August) the children live with him.  Therefore, the number of 
monthly payments on line 9 will be 12 - 3 =  9 . 

Fill in the months, if any, when payments will not be made because the obligor parent has 
custody for a 30 or more consecutive day period.   

Then fill in the monthly amount to be paid.  Calculate this by dividing the annual amount the 
obligor owes (line 8) by the number of months in which payments will be made (line 9).   

Then check the box indicating who the obligor is:  mother or father (Parent A or Parent B).   

Example:  Continuing the example used above, the months in which payments will 

not be made are:  June, July & August   

The monthly amount to be paid is:  the annual amount from line 8 
($4,500) divided by the number on line 9 (9 months).   

$4,500  9 =   $500   

The $500 is to be paid by the father each month except June, July and 
August. 

ailure to Take Custody at Least 30% of the Time. 

 
If a parent does not take physical custody of the children at least 30% of the year, as agreed, 
the other parent can file a motion with the court to modify the support order.  The 
commentary to the rule indicates that in this circumstance, the support amount should be 
recalculated using the formula applicable in primary physical custody situations.  See 
section V.C. of the Commentary.  Usually, the motion will request a change in both the 
custody order and the support order.  But, even if the court does not change the custody 
order, it should change the support order and explain the reason for it.  However, both the 
rule and the commentary make it clear that child support should not be modified if the 
reason for failing to take physical custody was because the other parent refused to permit it. 

The DR-700 Motion Packet can be used to file this motion.  The packet is available at the 
court and on the court system’s website.

Instructions for Form DR-307, Divided Custody Child Support Calculation 

You need to fill out this form only if you decide on a “divided physical custody” 
arrangement (meaning each parent has primary physical custody of at least one of the 
children and you do not share custody of any of the children). 

You have “primary” physical custody of a child if the child lives with you more than 70% of 
the year. 

The rule on calculating support in a divided custody situation is Civil Rule 90.3(b)(2).  See 
the commentary about the divided custody rule (section V.D). 

In a “divided” custody situation, support is calculated by doing two “primary custody” 
calculations to determine what each parent owes the other and then subtracting the smaller 
amount from the larger.  (See the explanation of primary custody calculations on pages 7-8.) 

The sample, filled-out DR-307 form on page 23 assumes the following facts: 

There are three children in the family.

Father will have primary custody of Jason (age 5), and Jessica (age 7).

Mother will have primary custody of Joshua (age 2).

Father’s adjusted annual income is $20,822.









Note:  If Father’s adjusted annual income was more than $126,000, the amount to
write on line 1 for father would be $126,000.  According to Civil Rule 90.3(c)(2),
income is usually capped at $126,000 for child support calculations, even if the
parent earns more than that.



Mother’s adjusted annual income is $36,960.

Note:  The minimum amount of annual support that may be ordered is $600.  If the
amount of support as calculated under the primary custody rule (Civil Rule 90.3(a))
is less than $600, the minimum annual support amount under Rule 90.3(c)(3) would
be $600.  If that were true in this case, $600 would be written on line 4.  In this case
however, mother’s annual support would be $9,979, which is well above the
minimum amount.

After calculating the child support amount on the DR-307 form, the last step is to decide 
whether this result is “just and proper.”  The rule on divided custody states that divided 
custody is an “unusual circumstance” and, therefore, the court must consider whether the 
support amount should be varied under paragraph (c)(1) of the rule.  If you believe the 
amount is not “just and proper,” you must explain your reasons for believing this to the 
court.  You can do this in section VIII.A.6 on page 13 of the Petition for Dissolution.  See 
the discussion of the “unusual circumstances” exception in paragraph 7 on page 10 of this 
packet.

You need to fill out this form only if you decide on a “hybrid physical custody” arrangement 
(meaning at least one parent has primary physical custody of at least one child of the 
relationship and the parents share physical custody of at least one child of the relationship). 

A parent has “primary” physical custody of a child if the child lives with that parent more 
than 70% of the year. 

Parents “share” physical custody of a child if the child lives with each parent “for a period 
specified in writing in the custody order” of at least 30% of the year.  Civil Rule 90.3(f). 

The rule on calculating support in a hybrid custody situation is Civil Rule 90.3(b)(3).  

The “hybrid” calculation includes both “primary” custody calculations, and “shared” 
custody calculations (discussed in the previous pages of this booklet), but does not use the 
standard percentages from paragraph (a)(2) of the rule. 

Read section V.E. of the commentary for a step-by-step explanation of the calculation and a 
sample calculation. 

The sample, filled-out DR-308 form on pages 25-27 assumes the following facts: 

There are three children in the family, Jason, Joshua, and Jessica. 

Father will have primary custody of Jason (age 5). 

Mother will have primary custody of Joshua (age 2). 

The parents will share custody of Jessica (age 7).  The shared child (Jessica) will be 
in mother’s physical custody 40% of the time and in father’s 60% of the time. 

Father’s adjusted annual income is $20,822. 

Mother’s adjusted annual income is $36,960.

court.  You can do this in section VIII.A.6 on page 12 of the Petition for Dissolution.  See 
the discussion of the “unusual circumstances” exception in paragraph 7 on page 10 of this 
packet.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
