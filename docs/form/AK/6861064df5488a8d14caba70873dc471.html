Appeal from Administrative Agency 
to Superior Court* 
(except for Workers’ Compensation Board decisions) 

Court  staff  can  usually  answer  questions  about  court 
procedures,  court  rules,  court  records,  and  forms.    Court  staff 
must  remain  neutral  and  impartial.    They  are  not  allowed  to 
give legal advice.  Court staff cannot: 

 
advise you how statutes and rules apply to your case 
tell  you  whether  you  presented  your  case  properly  and 
with the best evidence and arguments 
tell you which procedures are the best ones to use in your 
case 
interpret laws for you 

• 
• 

• 

• 

 

If you need help with your case, you should talk to a lawyer. 

*For appeals from decisions of the Workers’ Compensation Board, 
contact the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Commission at 3301 
Eagle St. #304, Anchorage, AK 99503, or call (907) 269-4980.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILING AN APPEAL 
FROM AN ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY  
TO THE SUPERIOR COURT 

Appellate Rules 601-612 govern appeals to the superior court.  
AS 44.62 (the Administrative Procedure Act) has more 
information about administrative appeals.  You can also read 
the statutes, regulations, and case law cited in the agency 
decision you are appealing.  Appeals are complicated, and you 
may want to talk to a lawyer before you start this process. 

DEFINITIONS 

A. 

 
 
 
 

B. 

C. 

ADMINISTRATIVE  APPEAL.    In  an  administrative  appeal,  the  superior  court 
reviews  the  final  decision  of  a  state  or  local  government  agency,  board,  or 
commission.  An appeal is not a new hearing or a trial.  You cannot present any 
new evidence to the superior court.  The only information that the superior court 
will consider on appeal is: 

1. 

2. 
 
3. 
4. 

transcript  (or 

in  some  cases,  electronic  recording)  of 

the 
administrative hearing, including witness testimony; 
any exhibits (documents, photographs, videos, or physical items)   
offered as evidence at the administrative hearing; 
the documents and depositions in the agency file; and  
legal briefs filed in the appeal.1 

the 

APPELLANT.  The appellant is the party who files the appeal. 

APPELLEE.  The appellee is the party who defends against the appeal. 

I. 

COPIES TO OTHER PARTIES 

The court rules require each party to  give a copy  of any document that the party  files 
with the court to all other parties.2  You can give the documents to the other party by 
hand-delivering or mailing the documents.  You can also email or fax a copy if the other 
party agreed to this type of service.  For every document that you file, you must include 
a signed statement that you gave a copy  to the other parties.  This  is called  “proof of 
service.”    The  court  forms  include  a  certificate of  service  section.   Make  sure  that  you 
always complete this section before you file the form with the court.  If another party is 
represented by an attorney, you must serve the attorney instead of the party.  Agencies 
are usually represented by an attorney.   Contact the agency to find out the name and 
address  of  the  attorney  representing  it  on  appeal,  or  wait  to  see  the  attorney’s 
information when the attorney  files an Entry of Appearance.   For appeals from a state 
agency,  see  section  III(C)(4)  on  page  4  about  where  you  must  send  copies  of  your 
notice of appeal.

III.  TO FILE AN APPEAL 

A. 

Who May File.   

Any  party  to  an  administrative  hearing  may  file  an  appeal  when  that  party 
believes  that  (1)  the  hearing  officer  applied  the  law  incorrectly,  and/or  (2)  the 
hearing officer’s decision was not supported by the evidence presented.  Appeals 
from  Workers’  Compensation  Appeals  Commission  decisions  cannot  be  filed  in 
the superior court. 

B. 

When to File. 

You  can  only  appeal  to  the  superior  court  after  all  administrative 
proceedings  have  been  completed,  including  any  available  appeal  or 
review proceedings within (internal to) the agency. 

You must file a notice of appeal within 30 days from the date the order 
appealed  from  is  mailed  or  otherwise  distributed  to  you.3    If  you  file  a 
timely request for reconsideration with the agency, the time for filing the 
notice of appeal may be extended for the hearing officer to rule on that 
request.   

If you want to file a notice of appeal after the 30 days, you must ask the 
court for permission to accept it.  You can use Request and Order (form 
AP-135)  for  this.    Your  request  must  explain  why  your  appeal  notice  is 
late.  File your request to accept the late notice at the same time you file 
your notice of appeal. 

C. 

How to File. 

Notice.   

1. 

 

2. 

Filing Fee.   

File  Notice of Appeal  (form  AP-101)  with  the  superior  court.    Attach  a 
copy of the agency’s decision that you are appealing.4  Unless otherwise 
provided for under the law, you must file in the location that would “best 
serve the convenience of the parties.” 5 

a. 

b. 

-OR- 

When you file, you will be required to pay a $250 filing fee.  Make 
your check or money order payable to "Clerk of Court." 
 
If  you  cannot  afford  to  pay  the  filing  fee,  file  Request for 
Exemption from Payment of Fees (form TF-920) asking the court 
to waive it.     

NOTE:  There  is  no  filing  fee  if  you  are  appealing  a  decision  by  the 
Department of Labor under AS 23.20 (Employment Security Act).6

3  Appellate Rule 602(a)(2).  For the 30-day time limit to apply, an agency must clearly indicate that its 
decision  is  a  final  order  and  that  the  claimant  has  30  days  to  appeal.   Manning v. Alaska Railroad 
Corporation, 853 P.2d 1120, 1124 (Alaska 1993).

Bond.   

3. 

 

You do  not  need to file a bond  for appeals  from  a denial of a claim for 
benefits under AS 23.20 (Employment Security Act).7  In all other appeals 
from  administrative  agencies,  you  must  file  one  of  the  following  at  the 
time you file your notice of appeal: 

•  a $750 cost bond 
•  a motion to waive or reduce cost bond 

a.  $750 Cost Bond.  

The purpose of this bond is to make sure the appellee's appeal costs 
will be  reimbursed  by  you if  you lose your appeal or if  the appeal is 
dismissed.  To meet the cost bond requirement, you can either file a 
surety bond or make a cash deposit: 

b. 

 

(1) 

(2) 

Surety Bond.  This is a document that guarantees payment 
of money if certain things occur.  The person or company 
that  writes  the  bond  is  called  the  surety.    The  surety 
guarantees  the  payment  by  becoming  responsible  for  it.  
Such  bonds  are  generally  available 
insurance 
companies or third parties qualified to write surety bonds. 
There  will  be  a  fee.    The  court  system  does  not  provide 
forms for surety bonds.  

from 

Cash  Deposit.    If  you  want  to  make  a  cash  deposit  with 
the  court  instead  of  filing  a  surety  bond,  complete  Cash 
Deposit on Appeal  (form AP-110).  Check the first box on 
the  form,  fill  out  the  rest  of  it,  acknowledge  it  before  a 
court  clerk or notary public,  and give it to the clerk along 
with your money. 

 

Motion to Waive or Reduce Cost Bond. 

     

The  cost  bond  is  $750  unless  the  superior  court  fixes  a  lesser 
amount.8    If  you  think  this  amount  is  too  high  because  the 
expected  appeal  costs  (including  attorney  fees)  for  the  appellee 
will be a lot less than $750, you may file: 
(1) Motion to Waive or Reduce Cost Bond (form AP-120). 
(2) Order Re Cost Bond (form AP-130).  Only fill out the top part 

of the AP-130 (the case caption).  The judge will out the rest. 

If  you  believe  you  cannot  afford  to  post  a  $750  cost  bond,  you 
may file:  
(1) Motion to Waive or Reduce Cost Bond (form AP-120).  
(2) Order Re Cost Bond (form AP-130).  Only fill out the top part of 

the AP-130 (the case caption).  The judge will fill out the rest.  

(3) Financial Statement (form CR-206).  

The court will notify you of its decision.  If the court orders you to 
post  a cost  bond, you must  file a surety bond or cash deposit in 
the amount set by the court or your appeal will be dismissed.

c.  Return of Bond.  

After the appeal is decided, the court will send all parties a notice that 
the  bond  will  be  released  unless  there  is  an  objection.    If  you  lose 
your appeal, the appellee may file an objection and request that the 
bond  be  applied  to  appellee's  appeal  costs.    If  the  appellee  doesn’t 
file an objection, the court will return your cash deposit to you. 

4. 

Copies  to  Agency  and  Others.  You  must  send  a  copy  of  your  notice  of 
appeal and all attachments to: 
a.  In all types of agency appeals, the head of the agency 
b.  If  you  are  appealing  from  a  state  agency  decision,  the  Attorney 

General of Alaska, P.O. Box 110300, Juneau, AK 99811-0300 

c.  If  the  Office  of  Administrative  Hearings  heard  the  case,  the  Chief 

Administrative Law Judge 

V. 

PREPARATION OF RECORD 

In  addition to  the  documents  you  file,  the  court  needs  the  agency’s  records  about  the 
hearing and decision in your case.  The record on appeal will include all original papers 
and exhibits filed with the agency, and a typed transcript of all proceedings before the 
agency.9 

The court  will notify  the agency  to prepare the agency  file by a certain deadline.  The 
agency  must  number  the  pages  in  its  file,  make  a  copy  of  the  file,  and  send  it  to  the 
court.  Unless you and the agency agree otherwise, or the court orders otherwise, you 
must pay the agency to do this (usually in advance).10  The agency will notify you when 
it  is  ready  to  accept  payment  and  how  much  it  will  be.    Within  30  days  after  this 
notice,  you  must  pay  the  agency  for  preparation  of  the  record.    If  you  do  not,  your 
appeal may be dismissed.11   

You must also pay to have a transcript of the agency hearing or hearings typed.12  You 
will  need  to  get  an  electronic  recording  of  the  hearings  from  the  agency  and  hire  a 
transcriber.    Contact  the  agency  about  this  after  you  file  your  notice  of  appeal.    You 
must  file  the  original  transcript  with  the  agency  within  40  days  after  you  file  your 
notice of appeal.  If you need more time to get the transcript typed, ask the court for an 
extension of time.  You may use Request and Order (form AP-135) to do this. 

STAY OF ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER 

The  filing  of  your  appeal  does  not  automatically  “stay”  (stop)  any  seizure  of  your 
property  or  loss  of  a  license  that  results  from  the  agency  decision,  however,  you  may 
ask the court for a stay of enforcement of the agency decision.  You may use Request 
and Order (form AP-135) to do this.  The court may require an additional bond, called a 
supersedeas bond, before allowing the stay.

9   Exception:  In an appeal from a driver's license revocation by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or from 
a prisoner disciplinary decision of the Department of Corrections, the record will include electronic 
recordings instead of transcripts.  Appellate Rule 604(b)(1). 

 

 

 

10   Appellate Rule 604(b)(1)(B)(iv). 
11   Appellate Rule 606(b). 
12   For exceptions, see footnote 9 above. 
AP-210 (4/22) 

4 

If you file a request for a stay at the same time you file your notice of appeal, include a 
copy  of  the  request  in  the  packet  that  you  send  to  the  head  of  the  agency  (and  any 
others required to be served with notice; see section III(C)(4) on the previous page).  If 
you file this request later, you must instead send a copy to the agency’s attorney.  You 
can find out who the attorney is by calling the agency. 
 

VI.  WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOUR APPELLATE CASE IS OPENED 

A. 

Assignment of Judge.   

After you have opened your appellate case, the court will notify you of the name 
of the judge assigned to hear it.  You have the right to a “peremptory challenge” 
(to ask for a different judge) one time only, without giving a reason.  If you do 
this, you will be randomly  assigned  a different  superior court judge to hear the 
appeal.  Use Notice of Change of Judge (form TF-935).  You must file this notice 
within five days of being notified of the assigned judge.   

B. 

Briefing Schedule.  

 

 

A  “legal brief”  is a document  that  you write to explain  your side of the case to 
the judge.  When the case is ready for briefing, the court will send you and the 
appellee Notice Setting Appeal Procedure (form AP-307).  This notice will tell you 
the time schedule for filing legal briefs and requesting oral argument.   

You must  file  a brief  within  the  time  limit  set  by  the  court’s  notice.   If you  do 
not, your appeal may be dismissed.  If you cannot file within the time limit, file 
Request and Order (form AP-135) asking the court for more time.  

Along with your brief, you must prepare an "excerpt of record."  Instructions for 
preparing an excerpt are in paragraph 2 on the next page. 

1. 

Legal  Brief.    The  full  rules  for  what  your  legal  brief  must  include  and 
what  format  it  must  be  in  are  in  Appellate  Rules  605(a),  212(c),  and 
513.5.  These instructions only provide a summary of these rules.  Read 
the  full  text  of  the  rules  to  make  sure  you  are  complying  with  all 
requirements.   

The  substance  of  your  brief  must  include  the  following  sections,  in  the 
following order: 

a.  a table of contents 
b.  a  table  of  all  legal  authorities  cited  to  in  your  brief  (case  law, 
statutes,  and  regulations)  and  the  text  of  the  primary  laws  you 
are relying on 

c.  a “jurisdictional statement”13 
d.  a statement of the issues you want the court to review 
e.  a summary of the facts of the case and the agency proceedings  
f.  a  discussion  of  the  law  and  its  application  to  the  facts  (this  is 

where you discuss your appeal arguments in detail) 

g.  a short conclusion explaining what you want the court to order 

 
13   The includes a statement about the date of the final agency decision, whether the decision is final on 
all issues, and the legal authority of the superior court to hear the appeal (this authority can be found 
in the rules and statutes referred to in the beginning of these instructions). 

 

 

 

AP-210 (4/22) 

5 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 

Sections e and f must include citations to the record for each argument or 
statement you make.  See “Citation Guidelines” below for how to do this. 

Your brief must  be typed  or  written  (using black  ink),  double-spaced on 
8.5" x 11" white paper.  Number all of the pages except for the cover, the 
table of contents, and the table of legal authorities.  Only type or write on 
one side of each page.  Your initial brief must be no longer than 50 pages 
(excluding the cover, table of contents, and table of legal authorities).  If 
the  appellee  files  a  brief  in  response,  you  have  the  option  (but  are  not 
required)  to  file  a  reply  brief,  addressing  any  new  points  brought  up  in 
the appellee’s brief.  Your reply brief must be no longer than 20 pages.   

Appellant Brief Cover Sheet  (form  AP-162) may be used  as the cover of 
your brief.  It is available as a fillable form online.  It is also included as 
the second-to-last page of these instructions, which you may detach and 
fill out by hand. 

 

Citation Guidelines.   In your brief, you must refer to specific pages in 
the  excerpt  of  record,  the  transcript,  or  a  deposition  that  support  your 
arguments  or  statements  about  the  facts.14    After  each  argument  or 
statement of fact, place the referral citation in parenthesis at the end. 

a.  To cite to the excerpt of record, write “(Exc. ___)” -- write the 

appropriate page number of the excerpt on the blank line. 

b.  To  cite  to  the  transcript,  write  “(Tr.  ____)”  --  write  the 

appropriate page number of the transcript on the blank line. 

c.  To  cite  to  a  deposition,  write  “(Dep.  of  ___,  page  __)”  --  write 
the name of the person who gave the deposition on the first blank 
line, and the page of that deposition on the second blank line. 

Examples: 
 
 
 

Documents in an Excerpt of Record: (Exc. 26) 
Transcript: (Tr. 14)   
Deposition: (Dep. of Tom Davis, page 20) 

2. 

Excerpt of Record.  In addition your brief, you must prepare an excerpt 
of record.  You must include copies of the following in your excerpt: 

• 
• 

• 
• 

• 

• 

the complaint, petition, or other document that started the case 
your  answer  or  the  answer  filed  by  the  other  party    (if  an 
amended  answer  was  filed,  you  only  need  to  include  the 
amended answer) 
the decision or order of the hearing officer that you are appealing 
any other orders or rulings the hearing officer made in your case 
that you want the court to review 
any  written  opinion,  findings,  or  other  statements  issued  by the 
hearing officer to explain the reasons for the officer’s decision 
any  other  documents  in  the  agency's  file  that  you  cite  in  your 
brief, or that you think the court must look at to properly review 
the case 

 
 
14   For purely legal arguments, you may cite to a statute, a regulation, a constitutional provision, or case 

 

 

law instead. 

AP-210 (4/22)

Do  not  include  pages  of  the  transcript  of  the  agency  hearings  in  your 
excerpt.  If you want the court to look at a specific part of the transcript, 
see the "Citation Guidelines" on the previous page for how to refer to it in 
your brief.  

Do not simply use the entire agency file or include extra documents that 
are  not  listed  above.    The  court  needs  to  be  able  to  easily  locate  the 
relevant parts of the record that support your statements, and not search 
through a large stack of papers.  

Do  not  include  anything  in  your  excerpt  that  was  not  presented  in  the 
original  agency  proceeding.    You  cannot  present  new  evidence  in  the 
appeal.   

To prepare your excerpt: 

a.  Look  through  the  agency  file  that  was  prepared  after  you  filed 
your notice of appeal (see section IV of these instructions).   The 
agency gives the file to the court, so if the agency did not provide 
you  a  copy,  it  is  also  available  at  the  court  where  you  filed  your 
appeal.  Make copies of all of the pages that you need need from 
the file (or pull them out from your own copy).  Consult the list on 
the  previous  page  to  make  sure  you  are  including  just  the 
documents that you need, and are not leaving any required ones 
out.   

b.  Arrange  the  documents  in  chronological  order  by  the  date  they 

were signed, with the oldest one on top.   

c.  Put page numbers on the bottom of each page, starting with "1" 
and  numbering  each  new  page,  until  the  last  page  is  numbered.  
Do not start over the numbering for each document. 

d.  Create  a  table  of  contents.    List  the  title  of  each  document,  the 
date it was signed, and the page number (from c above) on which 
it begins.  Put the table of contents on top. 

e.  Prepare a cover page.  Excerpt of Record Cover Sheet  (form AP-
165) may  be used.  It  is available as a fillable form online.  It is 
also  included  as  the  last  page  of  these  instructions,  which  you 
may detach and fill out by hand. 

f.  Staple the excerpt separately from your brief.   

Service.    Send  a  copy  of  both  your  brief  and  your  excerpt  to  the 
appellee.  You must show proof that you did this by filling out  and filing 
a  certificate  of  service.    These  certificates  are  already  included  on  the 
sample cover sheets (forms AP-162 and AP-165).   

File with the Court.  After you have given copies to the appellee, file both 
your brief and your excerpt of record with the court by the deadline in the 
notice that the court clerk previously sent to you. 

Reply Brief.  If you choose to file a reply brief, you may also include an 
additional excerpt of record.  Only do this if there are new excerpts that 
you want to refer to that were not already included in your initial excerpt 
or in the excerpt that the appellee filed with the appellee’s brief.

C. 

Oral Argument.   

“Oral argument” is when you explain your side of the case to the appellate judge 
and try to persuade the judge why you should get what you are asking for.  Oral 
argument is not a new trial or a chance to present more evidence.  You cannot 
call  witnesses  to  testify.    You  are  limited  to  explaining  in  more  detail  the 
arguments  you  made  in  your  legal  brief.    Sometimes,  the  judge  will  ask  you 
questions  about  what  you  say  during  oral  argument  or  what  you  wrote  in  your 
brief.  Each side gets 15 minutes to speak, unless otherwise ordered.15 

The deadline to request oral argument is: 

(1) 

(2) 

If  the  appellee  files  a  brief,  then  within  10  days  after  the  date 
your reply brief is due; or 

If the appellee does not file a brief, then within 10 days after the 
due date for the appellee’s brief expired.   

If  the  appellee  timely  requests  oral  argument,  you  may  not  object  to  the 
request.16   As  long  as  at  least  one party  makes  a  timely  request,  the  court  will 
automatically schedule oral argument.  The request must be in writing, but does 
not need to explain why oral argument is necessary.  You may use Request and 
Order (form AP-135) to ask for oral argument. 

If  your  request  for  oral  argument  is  filed  after  the  deadline,  you  must  also 
include a request for the court to accept your late filing.  You may use Request 
and Order (form AP-135) to both ask for the oral argument to be scheduled, and 
to explain why the court should accept your late request. 

If you file a request for oral argument, you must serve a copy of your request on 
the appellee.  Make sure to fill out the certificate of service showing that you did 
this. 

II.  DECISION 

The superior court  will decide the appeal based on the record,  the briefs and  excerpts 
submitted, and oral arguments (if held).  The court will send you a copy of the decision.  
The decision may: 

• 
• 
• 
• 

affirm (agree with) the hearing officer’s decision, 
remand (send the case back for additional action by the agency), 
reverse the decision made by the hearing officer, or 
dismiss your appeal. 

There may also be a combination of these results if there are multiple issues on appeal.   

5   An exception is if the appellee does not file a legal brief, the appellee waives (gives up) the right to 

 

 

speak at oral argument.   

16   Appellate Rule 605.5.

VIII.  ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS 

In administrative appeals, Appellate Rule 508 determines who may apply for costs and 
attorney  fees  at  the  end  of  the  appeal.    Generally,  you  (the  appellant)  may  apply  for 
costs and attorney fees if the administrative hearing officer’s decision is reversed.17   

Costs.    The  clerk  will  send  the  parties  Notice Re Costs and Attorney Fees on Appeal 
(form AP-333) along with a copy of the appeal decision.  If you won the appeal, and you 
want  to  recover your  costs,  file  a  verified18  and  itemized  bill of  costs  within 10  days 
after the date shown in the clerk's certificate of distribution on the appeal decision.   If 
the decision was mailed to you, you have an additional three calendar days to file your 
bill of costs.   

The only costs you may ask for are: 

1. 
2. 
 
3. 
4. 
5. 

the filing fee 
the cost of preparing the transcripts or electronic recordings and paying  
the transcriber 
the cost of copying and mailing briefs and excerpts of record 
extra costs related to bonds, such as surety fees or bank fees 
the fee charged by the agency for preparing the agency file for the court 

You must serve a copy of your bill of costs on the appellee, who has seven days to file 
objections.  The clerk will then decide what costs to award and send both parties a copy 
of the decision. 

Attorney Fees.  File a request for attorney fees within 10 days after the date shown in 
the clerk’s certificate of distribution on the appeal decision.  You may use Request and 
Order (form AP-135) to do this.  Be sure to attach a detailed invoice showing your actual 
attorney fees.  Non-attorneys cannot request attorney fees for representing themselves.  
Include an explanation of why you are allowed to recover attorney fees under Appellate 
Rule 508(e).  You must send a copy of the request to the appellee, who has seven days 
to file objections.  The court will send you a copy of the judge's decision on the request.   

 

 

 

If the decision is affirmed or if the appeal is dismissed, then the appellee may ask the court to award 
costs and attorney fees against you.  If the decision is remanded, or if only some parts were reversed 
or affirmed, then the superior court will have to decide which side, if any, is awarded costs and fees. 
18   “Verified” means your cost bill must include a statement signed by a court clerk or notary public that 
you have sworn or affirmed that the information in the cost bill is true.  See Alaska Statute 09.63.030 
for the wording of a verification.
