Introduction 

he contents of this manual are intended to be adapted by state personnel to reflect the 
state’s specific policies and procedures concerning state court interpreter certification oral 
examinations. 

his document has been prepared to help persons aspiring to become approved court 
interpreters understand what the oral examination measures, how it is administered and 
scored, and how to prepare for taking the examination.  Each examinee should study this 
overview thoroughly in order to be more fully prepared for the oral performance examination. 

he oral examination is only one part of the process for becoming an approved or certified 
court interpreter.  There may be other requirements you will need to fulfill before your state 
considers you eligible to participate in this examination.  Passing this test will demonstrate that 
you are considered minimally competent to interpret in your state’s court system.  Passing 
scores on this examination may or may not be recognized by other states’ court systems. 

 

 
Background 

 
Court interpreting is a sophisticated and demanding profession that requires much more than 
being bilingual.  One must possess high levels of knowledge and fluency in English and the non-
English language, a level generally equivalent to that of an educated native speaker of the 
language.  Court interpreters must also possess specialized cognitive and motor skills, have a 
firm understanding of court procedure and basic justice system concepts and terminology, and 
be thoroughly familiar with the ethical and professional responsibilities of interpreters in the 
judiciary. 

ourt interpreters play a vital role in court proceedings that involve non-English speaking 
individuals as litigants or witnesses.  Your state should have adopted a code of professional 
responsibility that describes the expectations of the judiciary with respect to what court 
interpreters must know and be able to do during interpreted proceedings.   

t is important that judges have timely access to appropriately qualified interpreters to assist 
them in conducting court proceedings involving individuals who do not speak English, or who 
have a limited ability to speak or understand English.  The objectives of the court interpreter 
testing program, therefore, are: 
 

• 
• 

to identify individuals who possess the required knowledge and skills; and,  
to expand the pool of qualified interpreters available to assist the court in the conduct 
of interpreted proceedings.

Exam objectives, design, and structure 

ral performance examinations are tests designed to determine whether candidates possess 

the minimum levels of language knowledge and interpreting skills required to perform 
competently during court proceedings.  The tests are substantially similar in structure and 
content to tests that have been developed by the federal courts.  The tests are designed and 
developed by consultants who have extensive knowledge of courts and court proceedings, the 
job requirements for court interpreters, and/or advanced training or high levels of fluency in 
English and the non-English language.  These experts may include federally certified court 
interpreters, judges and lawyers, linguists, scholars, and/or legal professionals.   

 

What does the exam measure? 

he test measures language knowledge and fluency in both languages and the ability to 
successfully render meaning from target to source language in each of the three modes of 
interpreting that are required of court interpreters.  The three modes of interpreting include: 

•  simultaneous interpreting; 
•  consecutive interpreting;  
•  sight translation of documents. 

n short, the test measures what a court interpreter should and must be able to do to meet 
minimum professional requirements.1    In all three modes of interpreting the interpreter must 
demonstrate the following abilities:   

•  Ability to speak the non-English language and English fluently and without hesitation;  
•  Ability to transfer all meaning faithfully from the source language to the target language 
while interpreting in both the consecutive and simultaneous modes, and while sight 
translating documents (sometimes called sight interpreting);  

•  Ability to pronounce the non-English language and English in a way that does not 

systematically interfere with meaning and understanding. 

 

What is the structure of the oral exam? 

he entire exam consists of four parts.  All four parts are based on actual transcripts or other 
court documents and simulate in many respects, actual court interpreting.  The four parts of 
the exam are:

•  Sight translation of a document written in English interpreted orally into the non-English 

•  Sight translation of a document written in the non-English language interpreted into oral 

language 

English 

•  Consecutive interpreting from English into the non-English language and from   

the non-English language into English 

•  Simultaneous interpreting from English into the non-English language 

ight translation: English to non-English language 
This part of the test simulates an interpreter reading an English document aloud to a non-
English-speaking person.  The document is about 225 words in length. After instructions are 
given, the examinee is allowed six minutes to complete this portion of the exam. 

ight translation: non-English language to English 
This part of the test simulates an interpreter reading a non-English language document 
aloud to an English speaking person.  This document is also about 225 words in length. After 
instructions are given, the examinee is allowed six minutes to complete this portion of the 
exam. 

onsecutive interpreting 

This is the appropriate form of interpreting for non-English speaking witnesses, and other 
question and answer situations involving non-English speaking persons.  During this portion 
of the test, the interpreter interprets English language questions (utterances) into the 
foreign language and foreign language answers into English.  Although the consecutive 
portion of the examination usually follows the format of “question – answer – question – 
answer,” there may be times when the cadence changes.   

he examinee may ask to have two of the utterances repeated.  The consecutive portion is 
administered by a test proctor who plays the prerecorded courtroom simulation on a CD 
player.   

his part of the examination is timed and will take between 22 and 30 minutes, depending 
upon the total length of the recording, excluding instructions.   

imultaneous interpreting 
Simultaneous interpreting is the appropriate mode of interpreting for many situations 
interpreters encounter in the courtroom; for example, interpreting for defendants during 
procedural hearings and trials.  This part of the exam consists of a CD recording of a 
simulated attorney’s opening or closing statement to a judge or jury.  It is 800 to 850 words 
in length, is recorded at an approximate speed of 120 words per minute, and is about seven 
minutes long.  One hundred and twenty words per minute is much slower than most 
ordinary courtroom speech.  Most of the passage is monologue speech by one voice,

representing an attorney.  A brief section of colloquy by voices representing the judge, 
other attorneys, or a witness may be included in addition to the monologue.   
During this portion of the exam, the examinee listens to the prerecorded English passage 
through headphones and, while listening, interprets aloud into the non-English language.  
The candidate’s interpretation is recorded on a tape recorder for later review and scoring 
by the test examiners.  This part of the examination takes approximately ten minutes, 
including instructions and preparation.   

 

Test rating and scoring 

ach exam will be assessed by the number of scoring units interpreted correctly.  

coring units are particular words and phrases that are selected to represent various features of 
language that interpreters encounter in their work, and that they must render accurately and 
completely, without altering the meaning or style of speech.  The examiners determine 
whether those scoring units are interpreted correctly or incorrectly.  When interpreting into the 
non-English language, the examiners will consider correct any rendering that would be 
acceptable in any appropriate spoken variety of the non-English language.   
 
It is important for examinees to understand that when the test is prepared, test reviewers try 
to make sure that the test does not include words or phrases that are used in a way that is 
peculiar to a particular country or region. 

 

he types of scoring units that are scattered throughout the test include the following:   

•  Grammar--words or phrases that might be interpreted incorrectly due to an inadequate 

•  False cognates—words that sound or look alike in both languages, but that have 

command of grammar 

different meanings  

•  General vocabulary—a range of nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. 
•  Legal/Technical vocabulary—special terminology frequently encountered in court 

• 

contexts, such as common legal terms 
Idioms and expressions—words or phrases in the source language which will usually 
result in lost meaning or nonsense if they are interpreted word-for-word into the target 
language 

•  Numbers, names, dates—these must be accurately preserved during the interpretation 
•  Modifiers, emphasis—adjectives, adverbs, exclamations, etc. in the source language 

that must be accurately preserved in the target language 

•  Register/style—words or phrases characteristic of a style of speech (formal, casual, 

informal) that must be preserved in the interpretation, for example, “yeah” and “yes” 
mean the same, but make a different impression on the listener 

[4]

  T

 
 

•  Position and special function—words or phrases that might be overlooked or left out 
because of their position in the sentence, such as embedded phrases or tag-ons, or 
because they are “fillers,” such as false starts, stalls, etc., and 

•  Slang/Colloquialisms—words or phrases that are slang or colloquial language. 
 

Each portion of the exam has a fixed number of scoring units.  There are 75 scoring units in the 
simultaneous, 75 or 90 units in the consecutive (depending upon what version of a test is used), 
and 25 units in each of the sights, for a total of 50 units.  The candidate must score at least a 
70% on each of the three2 scorable parts of the test in order to pass. 

 

Each candidate’s test is reviewed by two raters.  The raters independently score each scoring 
unit, and then compare their scores.  When a scoring unit is omitted or rendered incorrectly, 
the raters will place an “X” over that scoring unit (for example, if the scoring unit is June 16, 
2004 and the examinee said June 15, 2004, that scoring unit will be marked as “unacceptable”).  
When there is disagreement between the raters about the interpretation of a scoring unit, the 
raters consult a scoring dictionary.  The scoring dictionary includes a compilation of 
interpretations for that scoring unit that have been deemed “acceptable” or “unacceptable” by 
other teams of raters in the past.  If the scoring dictionary does not adequately address the 
disagreement, the raters will turn to reputable bilingual dictionaries and other resources to see 
if the interpretation would be acceptable in any country where the language is spoken.  When 
there is disagreement that cannot be resolved through discussion or by consulting the scoring 
dictionary or published resources, a third opinion may be sought.  The benefit of any doubt 
always goes to the candidate.  In other words, if after discussion and research, just one rater 
believes a scoring unit is interpreted correctly, the unit is marked as “acceptable”.   

nce the raters have rated and discussed an examination, they count the number of 

unacceptable scoring units and subtract that sum from the total number of scoring units in that 
section of the test.  The result is the total number of acceptable scoring units. The total number 
of acceptable scoring units and that number, expressed as a percentage, is reported to the 
examinee.  For example, if a candidate had 15 scoring units out of a possible of 75 marked as 
“unacceptable,” that number would be subtracted from the total number of scoring units, 
leaving 60 scoring units as “acceptable.”  The report to the examinee would illustrate 60 correct 
scoring units, and the percentage score (in this example, 60 divided by 75, or 80%). 

 

Procedural and mechanical aspects of the oral exam 

OTE:  Each state should ensure that this section conforms to the practice in that state. 

Candidates who have complied with all the state requirements can apply to take the test and 
pay any required registration fee (or comply with any other state requirements).  This is done 
well in advance of the test day.  If you have already applied to take the test and paid the fee (if

applicable), you should have received notice with this booklet telling you of the testing location, 
test date, and specific time of your appointment.  To take the test, you must show up on time 
and be prepared to confirm your registration information and your identity with photo 
identification that matches your registration form.  If you do not have a photo identification, 
you should make advance arrangements with the test coordinator from whom you received 
your registration form to agree on some other form of acceptable positive identification.   

Exam Day  

As noted above, you must appear on time at the test site with your identification and test 
registration confirmation forms.  In most cases, there will be a registration clerk or test proctor 
waiting to confirm your identity and your appointment.  Please report to the clerk or proctor as 
soon as you arrive.  After confirming your registration and completing the paperwork required 
to process your exam, you will be asked to take a seat in a waiting area until a test 
administrator calls your name.  Examinees will be taken to the test room in the order they 
arrive.  Appointments are generally made on a staggered schedule to limit the total sign in, 
waiting, and test time to no more than one hour.  Generally, you can expect to complete the 
entire process in 60 minutes or less.   

hen your name is called you will be escorted to the test room by a proctor.  You will not be 
allowed to bring any purses, handbags, or other similar personal belongings that have not been 
opened and examined into the test room. Tape recorders or any other mechanical devices will 
not be allowed inside the test room.  After you are seated, the proctor will give you further 
detailed instructions before the exam begins.  You should behave as you would if you were 
working in court.  

What will the examination room look like? 

he exam may be given in a room such as a courtroom, a jury room, or a conference room, 
boardroom, or office.  Only you and the test proctor will be present in the room during the 
exam.  Your consent is required for observers to be present. 

he administrator/proctor will have a list of individuals to be tested that day and a “script” that 
he or she will follow to read the instructions.  All examinees are given exactly the same 
instructions.  At your seat, there will be a fresh cup of water poured for you, a note pad, and 
pencils and pens for you to take notes if you wish.  On the table, there will be one Compact Disk 
player (or other playing device) and a recorder, either the cassette type or a digital recorder.  
The recorder will record your test and will be turned on as soon as you enter the room.  The 
player will be used to play the pre-recorded simultaneous and consecutive portions of the test.

What happens once I’m in the examination room? 

he following descriptions apply to the specific parts of the exam. 

ight Translations:    
First, the test administrator will hand you a document, written in English, which you must 
interpret into the foreign language. After that exercise is completed, the test administrator will 
hand you a second document, written in the foreign language, which you will interpret into 
English.  You will be given six minutes to read and interpret each document.  The administrator 
will inform you that you have two minutes to read the document to yourself to gain a 
perspective of the contents and the overall meaning.  Although you can begin your 
interpretation at any time, you are encouraged to use that time to familiarize yourself with the 
document and take notes if it will help you in your delivery.  If you haven’t begun to interpret 
the contents after two minutes, the test administrator will tell you that you should begin.  At 
that point, you have four minutes remaining to orally translate the document.  This procedure 
is identical for both documents.  The goal is to render an accurate rendition of the document in 
a fluid, smooth manner, avoiding hesitations, false starts, and constant repeats of passages that 
detract from the listener’s ability to comprehend the message. 

onsecutive:   

The consecutive portion of the exam will be played on a playing device.  The test administrator 
will play a segment of the test and then pause the device.  At the pause, you will interpret what 
was said into the other language.  For example if the utterance represents an attorney asking a 
question in English, at the pause, you will interpret that question into the foreign language.  The 
administrator will then play the next utterance and pause.  Again, you will interpret what was 
said into the other language.  For example, if the utterance is the witness answering in the 
foreign language, at the pause, you will interpret that answer into English.   

ou will be allowed to ask for two repetitions during the consecutive portion of the exam. The 
utterances will vary in length from one word to over forty words. You may not ask for a part of 
a segment to be repeated or for a segment to be split into two separate utterances.  If you ask 
for a repetition, the whole segment will be repeated for you (this can only occur twice during 
this portion of the exam).  You may not ask for clarification of any particular word or phrase.   

ou are encouraged to take notes to assist your memory.  It is in your best interest to keep up 
with the pace of the segments since this portion of the exam is timed.  If you take long, detailed 
notes, try to write everything that was said before you begin your interpretation, or if you 
deliver more than one rendition of your interpretation of utterances, you are likely to run out of 
time.  If you run out of time, all of the scoring units from the point where you ran out of time to 
the end of the consecutive portion will be counted as incorrect.  If you give more than one 
rendition, only the last rendition will be scored by the raters.

Simultaneous:   
The simultaneous passage has been pre-recorded.  After a brief introduction by the test 
proctor, you will put on a set of headphones.  You will hear a brief introductory message on the 
recording before the simultaneous portion begins.  As you listen to the introduction, you will 
have the chance to make sure the headphones fit comfortably and to adjust the volume.  Then, 
when the test begins you will interpret out loud in the simultaneous mode everything that is 
said into the non-English language. You may sit or stand during the test.  However, if you 
choose to stand, you should speak loudly and clearly so that your interpretation is recorded 
adequately, and bear in mind that your movement will be restricted by the length of the 
headphone wires.  Once the simultaneous portion of the exam begins, you are not permitted to 
stop the exam.  If you stop during the simultaneous portion, that will terminate the exam.  At 
that point, all scoring units that follow will be counted as wrong.  Once the simultaneous 
portion of the test is over, you will be permitted to take off the headphones and the test is 
concluded. 

 
After the examination 

fter the exam you will be asked to leave the testing area without returning to the waiting area.  

You are not allowed to discuss the exam with any other candidates.  One of the sign-in 
requirements is that you sign an oath, promising not to divulge any information about specific 
language or test items to any other person after you complete the examination. 

ou will be notified by mail of your exam results.  The exam administrator or proctor will give 
you an idea of how much time will expire between the time you take the test and the time you 
will receive the results.  Your test tapes, test scores, and test-rating sheet will be confidential.  
Only the test administrators, test raters, and personnel at the National Center for State Courts 
will have access to these materials.  The summary results – whether you pass or do not pass the 
test – are matters of public record and may be reported in response to any inquiry.  The details 
about your scores may be provided to an official representative of another state upon request, 
and may be provided to others if you submit a written request for that information to be 
released. 

 
Who scores my exam? 

or most languages, the exam is scored by teams of two interpreters who have themselves 
taken and passed a similar certification test, or, in the case of newly-developed examinations, 
are academic experts who have participated in the development of a test and who have been 
trained in the theory and practice of scoring oral examinations.  Raters receive specific training 
and usually have experience in test administration and test scoring.  All members of the teams 
are evaluated carefully to assure that they follow the testing standards established for the 
examination process.

Suggested “do’s and don’t’s” during the exam 

here are several tips that will be helpful to you if you keep them in mind while you are taking 
the examination.  Please study the following suggestions carefully. 

Perform throughout all parts of the oral exam as though you were interpreting in a 
courtroom.  The only times you should go out of this role is between exam sections. 
Concentrate on the source language and your rendition as you go through the various 
parts of the test. 
Try to interpret any words or phrases that may be unfamiliar to you, as long as you can 
make an educated guess about the meaning from the context given to you in the 
passage. 
Stick with it in the simultaneous.  If you find yourself getting frustrated, or feeling that 
you are unable to keep up, pause for a second or two to regain your composure and 
then keep trying!  (Remember that you cannot ask the proctor to stop the exam and 
then start over.) 
During the consecutive portion, use the same grammar “person” that is employed by a 
speaker.  For example, if the witness says in the foreign language the equivalent of "My 
name is Teresita Salazar," the proper interpretation into English would be, "My name is 
Teresita Salazar," NOT, "She says her name is Teresita Salazar." 
Conserve the intent, tone, and language level of the source messages you interpret.  If 
you encounter any impolite words or phrases, slang, or obscene language, interpret 
them as closely as possible into the target language just as they sound in the source 
language.  Do not attempt to clean up or change the language of any speaker. 

ON'T 

Guess wildly the meaning of a word or phrase that you don't know. 
Allow yourself to get frustrated when you don't know how to interpret a word or 
phrase.  Skip it and keep going. 
Give a string of synonyms for a given word or several interpretations for a particular 
phrase.  If you do this, only the last synonym or phrase you render will be graded, even 
if you said it correctly on the first try.

Suggestions for preparing for the test3 

ight Translations: 
Take any written materials (for example, newspaper and magazine articles, letters, books, birth 
certificates, etc.) and, speaking into a tape recorder, perform sight translations.  Evaluate your 
rendition against the source material.  Practice on a variety of subjects and vary the type of 
material that you use.  Continue practicing until you are able to comfortably translate at least 
225 words accurately within a six-minute time frame. 

onsecutive Interpretation: 

Practice your ability to repeat sentences and paragraphs of varying lengths, from one to fifty 
words.  You are likely to find a number of sources for practice materials.  For example, your 
local court reporter’s office may be willing to let you have draft copies of actual transcripts, or 
you may find practice materials on the World Wide Web.  If necessary, you can ask friends and 
family members to create samples of “question and answer” formatted transcripts.  Say a 
segment aloud in the source language (or have a friend or family member read the segment out 
loud for you), then interpret that segment into the target language.  Be sure to vary the lengths 
of the utterances and practice until you are able, with the use of notes if you are trained in 
notetaking skills, to interpret long passages.  Be sure to record yourself – you may be surprised 
by the fact that what you actually said was not what you thought you said. 

or many interpreters, note taking is extremely beneficial in all modes of interpretation, but 
especially in the consecutive mode.  If you find that you benefit from note taking, develop an 
efficient note taking system in order to remember relevant names, dates, places, and figures.  It 
is often essential to develop this skill under the direction of an experienced interpreter or 
teacher.   However, the skill you develop will be your own personal method of note taking.  
Notes might be recorded in the form of simple outlines, charges, diagrams, or graphs.  Listing 
information in the form of a diagram might be helpful while interpreting at a trial during which 
a particular scenario is repeatedly mentioned.  An effective note taking system allows you to 
concentrate on the ideas and concepts contained in the message, not on taking the notes.  It is 
important to adopt a strategy or strategies that work best for you.  Attend as many different 
kinds of court proceedings as possible.  As you listen, practice taking notes that highlight 
actions, specific information (dates, names, etc.) and legal concepts.  Develop your own 
symbols for the court, the district attorney, the public defender, etc. 

ractice consecutive interpretation until you are able to accurately interpret oral passages that 

are 850 to 900 words in length, with segments of varying lengths, within a 22-to-30-minute 
time frame.

Simultaneous  
Before the exam, practice your ability to listen through headphones and interpret out loud as 
you listen.  Practicing silently is not as effective as practicing out loud.   Being very comfortable 
with headphones and listening to a reader while interpreting out loud is important. 

You should practice in front of other people so that you become comfortable with someone 
else being in the room, listening to your interpretation.  It doesn’t matter if the other person is 
bilingual or not – chances are the test proctor will not be bilingual.  The goal is to become 
accustomed to having someone else listening. 

ttend as many different kinds of court proceedings as possible.  While you listen, render them 
silently to yourself simultaneously with the speaker.  When you run into a word or phrase that 
you cannot interpret, make a note of it.  When you return home, look up those words and 
phrases to determine their meaning and the appropriate interpretation of them.  

se television and radio broadcasts as interpreting materials.  Interpret them aloud while you 

are driving or performing another activity simultaneously.   

 

 

  A

  U

Practice will help you avoid being startled or “paralyzed” by what you don’t know or a word you 
cannot remember.  If you become “paralyzed” during the simultaneous portion of the exam, 
you will miss much of the incoming message. 

Shadowing 
Shadowing is a basic exercise that will help you strengthen your simultaneous skills.  It 
familiarizes the interpreter with performing two tasks simultaneously. 

•  Have someone record varied paragraph-length passages in English and in the non-

English language into a tape recorder. 

•  Listen to a passage.  Then play it again and repeat everything you hear in the same 

language, staying as close to the speaker as possible. 

•  Listen to the passage again, repeating it in the source language.   
 

When you reach a point where this exercise is somewhat “easy” for you, increase your capacity 
by repeating the exercise and writing the numbers 1 through 100 at the same time. 

When that becomes “easy” for you, repeat the exercises and simultaneously write the numbers 
100 to 1 backwards.  With progress, complete the following exercises: 
•  Repeat the exercise and simultaneously write 1-100 by 5’s. 
•  Repeat the exercise and simultaneously write 1-100 by 3’s. 
•  Repeat the exercise and simultaneously write out a poem you know from memory. 
•  Repeat the exercise and simultaneously write anything committed to memory such as 

the Pledge of Allegiance or the Preamble to the Constitution, or the names and 
telephone numbers of your family and friends.

o practice: 

  T

These techniques are excellent for stretching your ability to multi-task.  Multi-tasking is an 
essential part of interpreting.  Repeating these exercises will essentially provide your brain with 
a “workout.” 

ther exercises: 

Since effective court interpreting requires accuracy and speed, it is essential that you enhance 
your listening and concentration capabilities. 

istening:  Practice your ability to listen through headphones and other mechanical devices. 

istening:  Listen carefully to the meaning and concept of the communication rather than the 
separate words.  You can practice critical listening anywhere at anytime. 

oncentration:  Learn to concentrate on what the person for whom you are interpreting is 
communicating.  Concentrate only on the actual communication without being distracted by 
external factors such as physical appearance, gestures, etc.  Accurate interpretation relies on 
how well the interpreter understands a message.   

nderstanding a message requires intellectual listening, that is, listening for ideas.  An 

interpreter must listen to a message and simultaneously classify the information in the message 
into a hierarchy.  An interpreter makes instantaneous decisions about which ideas are central 
and which are supporting or minor.  The following is an exercise that may help build this skill: 

•  Have someone record several passages of approximately 15 words in English. 
•  Choose texts representing a variety of areas (a newspaper report about a local crime, a 

scientific report of the results of research, a passage from a book, etc.). 

•  Listen to each passage without taking notes.  Turn off the recorder.  Write down the 

main idea of the passage.  (For example:  “Language interpreting performance tests are 
oral tests designed to determine whether candidates possess the minimum levels of 
language knowledge and interpreting skills required to perform competently during 
court proceedings.”  Main idea of the passage:  oral interpreting tests determine if one 
has the minimal level of skill required to interpret in the courts.)   

•  Continue this procedure with all the passages.   
•  Then listen to each passage again, confirming that the main idea you recorded was, 

indeed, the main idea of the passage. 

•  Listen to the passage again.   
•  Turn off the recorder.   
•  Note additional specific information that supports the main idea you had originally 

taken down.  (For example:  performance exams are oral tests that determine if one has 
the language knowledge and interpreting skills required to interpret in the courts.) 
•  Continue the procedure, taking notes and adding to the information until you have 

written a complete summary for each passage. 

ou should practice these exercises with another person or a small group of people in order to 
receive immediate and constant feedback.  Practicing with others is a great way to increase

your vocabulary and to be aware when more than one interpretation is accurate and 
acceptable.  All of the exercises mentioned in this section and those that are suggested to you 
at training sessions are more beneficial when performed interactively.

List of resources 

 

A heartfelt “thank you” to Holly Mikkelson, who so kindly shared her comprehensive and 
valuable lists of resources for Spanish interpreters, including: 

Recommended References for Spanish Interpreters 
Regional Spanish Websites 
Recommended References on Regional and Colloquial Spanish 
English Slang References 

nd to the State of New Jersey, a founding member of the former Consortium for Language 

Access in the Courts, our appreciation and admiration for the collection of resources found at its 
Web site, many of which are included in this document. 

xaminees please note:  Many of the institutions listed below offer “academic certificates,” 
which are different from state or federal interpreter certifications.  If you receive academic 
certificates and are not state or federally certified, you should clearly identify the certificate 
in your resumes or biographies and not claim state or federal interpreter certification.  To do 
so would be unethical.
