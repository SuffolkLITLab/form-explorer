      <pre>Certification for Military Family Leave for 
Qualifying Exigency   
under the Family and Medical Leave Act 
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

U.S. Department of Labor 
Wage and Hour Division 

OMB Control Number: 1235-0003 
DO NOT SEND FORM TO THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. 
Expires: 6/30/2023 
RETURN THE COMPLETED FORM TO THE EMPLOYER. 
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

The  Family  and  Medical  Leave  Act  (FMLA)  provides  that  eligible  employees  may  take  FMLA  leave  for  a  qualifying 
exigency while the employee's spouse, child, or parent (the military member) is on covered active duty or has been notified 
of an impending call or order to covered active duty. The FMLA allows an employer to require an employee seeking FMLA 
leave due to a qualifying exigency to submit a certification. 29 U.S.C. §§ 2613, 2614(c)(3). The employer must give the 
employee at least 15 calendar days to provide the certification. 29 C.F.R. § 825.305(b). If the employee fails to provide 
complete and sufficient certification, the employee’s FMLA leave request may be denied. 29 C.F.R. § 825.313. Information 
about the FMLA may be found on the WHD website at http://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla. 

SECTION I - EMPLOYER 

Either the employee or the employer may complete Section I. While use of this form is optional, it asks the employee for 
the information necessary for a complete and sufficient qualifying exigency certification, which is set out at 29 C.F.R. § 
825.309. You may not ask the employee to provide more information than allowed under the FMLA regulations, 29 
C.F.R. § 825.309.

(Must allow at least 15 calendar days from the date requested, unless it is not feasible despite the employee’s diligent, good faith efforts.)

SECTION II - EMPLOYEE 

Please complete all Parts of Section II and sign the form before returning it to your employer. The FMLA allows an employer 
to require that you submit a timely, complete, and sufficient certification to support a request for FMLA leave due to a 
qualifying exigency. If requested by your employer, your response is required to obtain the benefits and protections of the 
FMLA. 29 C.F.R. § 825.309. Failure to provide a complete and sufficient certification may result in a denial of your FMLA 
leave request. A complete and sufficient certification to support a request for FMLA leave due to a qualifying exigency 
includes written documentation confirming a military member’s covered active duty or call to covered active duty status. 
You are responsible for making sure the certification is provided to your employer within the time frame requested, 
which must be at least 15 calendar days. 29 C.F.R. § 825.313.

member who assumed the obligations of a parent to the employee when the employee was a child. An employee may also take 
FMLA leave for a qualifying exigency related a military member for whom the employee has assumed the obligations of a 
parent. No legal or biological relationship is necessary.

documentation issued by the military which indicates that the military member is on covered active duty or call to covered 
active duty status, and the dates of the military member's covered active duty service. This information need only be

PART B: APPROPRIATE FACTS 

Under  the  FMLA,  leave  can  be  taken  for  a  number  of  qualifying  exigencies.  29  C.F.R.  §  825.126(b).  Complete  and

sponsored  by  the  military,  a  document  confirming  the  military  member’s  Rest  and  Recuperation  leave,  or  other 
documentation issued by the military which indicates that the military member has been granted Rest and Recuperation 
leave, or a document confirming an appointment with a third party (e.g., a counselor or school official, or staff at a care 
facility, a copy of a bill for services for the handling of legal or financial affairs). Please provide appropriate facts related
