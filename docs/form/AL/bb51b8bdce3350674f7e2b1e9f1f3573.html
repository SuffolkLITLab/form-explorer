HOW DOES IT WORK? 

MEDICAL.  Covered  employees  who  are 
injured  on  the  job  receive  medical  care 
specific  health  care  providers 
from 
(physician,  hospital  or  clinic).  SEICTF  is 
responsible  for  payment  to  the  medical 
care provider. The employees will not be 
charged for co-payments and deductibles.  

LOST TIME. Benefits received after 
employee is out of  work longer than 
three work days.  

1. Waiting Period. There is a three work
day period for which no lost time benefit 
is  paid.  Compensation  begins  on  the 
fourth  work  day  after  disability,  when 
excused  by 
a  physician/gatekeeper. 
Should the lost time reach  

twenty-one  calendar  days,  the 
initial 
three  day  period  is  then  paid.  The  em-
ployee  may  elect  to  use  sick  or  annual 
leave  to cover the  waiting period  or take 
leave without pay.  

2. Choice  of  Compensation  Options  for
Lost Time. 

SEICTF 2/3. When unable to work due to 
injury, employee is paid by SEICTF.  

You  receive  two-thirds  of  your  current 
wage  by  SEICTF  warrant,  subject  to  the 
minimum/maximum  compensation  rates 
in effect at the time of the accident. Pay-
ment  of  SEIB  dependent  health  care  cov-
erage  and  other  pre-authorized  payroll 
deductions  are  the  responsibility  of  the 
employee.  Direct deposit is not available. 

Leave is accrued at a 2/3rds rate.  Retire-
ment  credit  stops  while  2/3rds  benefits 
are being paid. 

OR 

Election to use accrued leave. 

You  receive  your  usual  net  pay  by  State 
Payroll  warrant.    Semi-monthly  payroll 
pay and deductions remain the same. 

Two-thirds  of  your  current  wage  would 
be  non-taxable  subject  to  the  minimum/
maximum  compensation  rate  amount  in 
effect at the time of your accident. 

You  continue  to  accrue  leave  and  retire-
ment  credit    in  accordance  with  State 
Personnel rules.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
