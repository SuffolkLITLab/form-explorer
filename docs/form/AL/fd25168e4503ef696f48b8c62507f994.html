Your withholding is subject to review by the IRS.

Personal 
Information

Address 

City or town, state, and ZIP code

Step 2:

(a) Reserved for future use.
(b) Use the Multiple Jobs Worksheet on page 3 and enter the result in Step 4(c) below; or 
(c) 
 

If there are only two jobs total, you may check this box. Do the same on Form W-4 for the other job. This 
option is generally more accurate than (b) if pay at the lower paying job is more than half of the pay at the 
.
higher paying job. Otherwise, (b) is more accurate

Multiply the number of qualifying children under age 17 by $2,000 $

General Instructions
Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code. 

Future Developments
For the latest information about developments related to 
Form W-4, such as legislation enacted after it was published, 
go to www.irs.gov/FormW4.

Purpose of Form
Complete Form W-4 so that your employer can withhold the 
correct federal income tax from your pay. If too little is 
withheld, you will generally owe tax when you file your tax 
return and may owe a penalty. If too much is withheld, you 
will generally be due a refund. Complete a new Form W-4 
when changes to your personal or financial situation would 
change the entries on the form. For more information on 
withholding and when you must furnish a new Form W-4, 
see Pub. 505, Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax. 
Exemption from withholding. You may claim exemption 
from withholding for 2023 if you meet both of the following 
conditions: you had no federal income tax liability in 2022 
and you expect to have no federal income tax liability in 
2023. You had no federal income tax liability in 2022 if (1) 
your total tax on line 24 on your 2022 Form 1040 or 1040-SR 
is zero (or less than the sum of lines 27, 28, and 29), or (2) 
you were not required to file a return because your income 
was below the filing threshold for your correct filing status. If 
you claim exemption, you will have no income tax withheld 
from your paycheck and may owe taxes and penalties when 
you file your 2023 tax return. To claim exemption from 
withholding, certify that you meet both of the conditions 
above by writing “Exempt” on Form W-4 in the space below 
Step 4(c). Then, complete Steps 1(a), 1(b), and 5. Do not 
complete any other steps. You will need to submit a new 
Form W-4 by February 15, 2024.
Your privacy. If you have concerns with Step 2(c), you may 
choose Step 2(b); if you have concerns with Step 4(a), you 
may enter an additional amount you want withheld per pay 
period in Step 4(c). 
Self-employment. Generally, you will owe both income and 
self-employment taxes on any self-employment income you 
receive separate from the wages you receive as an 
employee. If you want to pay income and self-employment 
taxes through withholding from your wages, you should 
enter the self-employment income on Step 4(a). Then 
compute your self-employment tax, divide that tax by the 
number of pay periods remaining in the year, and include 
that resulting amount per pay period on Step 4(c). You can 
also add half of the annual amount of self-employment tax to 
Step 4(b) as a deduction. To calculate self-employment tax, 
you generally multiply the self-employment income by 
14.13% (this rate is a quick way to figure your self-
employment tax and equals the sum of the 12.4% social 
security tax and the 2.9% Medicare tax multiplied by 
0.9235). See Pub. 505 for more information, especially if the 
sum of self-employment income multiplied by 0.9235 and 
wages exceeds $160,200 for a given individual.
Nonresident alien. If you’re a nonresident alien, see Notice 
1392, Supplemental Form W-4 Instructions for Nonresident 
Aliens, before completing this form.

Page 2

Specific Instructions
Step 1(c). Check your anticipated filing status. This will 
determine the standard deduction and tax rates used to 
compute your withholding.
Step 2. Use this step if you (1) have more than one job at the 
same time, or (2) are married filing jointly and you and your 
spouse both work. 

If you (and your spouse) have a total of only two jobs, you 

may check the box in option (c). The box must also be 
checked on the Form W-4 for the other job. If the box is 
checked, the standard deduction and tax brackets will be 
cut in half for each job to calculate withholding. This option 
is roughly accurate for jobs with similar pay; otherwise, more 
tax than necessary may be withheld, and this extra amount 
will be larger the greater the difference in pay is between the 
two jobs.

▲
!

CAUTION

Multiple jobs. Complete Steps 3 through 4(b) on only 
one Form W-4. Withholding will be most accurate if 
you do this on the Form W-4 for the highest paying job.

Step 3. This step provides instructions for determining the 
amount of the child tax credit and the credit for other 
dependents that you may be able to claim when you file your 
tax return. To qualify for the child tax credit, the child must 
be under age 17 as of December 31, must be your 
dependent who generally lives with you for more than half 
the year, and must have the required social security number. 
You may be able to claim a credit for other dependents for 
whom a child tax credit can’t be claimed, such as an older 
child or a qualifying relative. For additional eligibility 
requirements for these credits, see Pub. 501, Dependents, 
Standard Deduction, and Filing Information. You can also 
include other tax credits for which you are eligible in this 
step, such as the foreign tax credit and the education tax 
credits. To do so, add an estimate of the amount for the year 
to your credits for dependents and enter the total amount in 
Step 3. Including these credits will increase your paycheck 
and reduce the amount of any refund you may receive when 
you file your tax return. 

Step 4 (optional).

Step 4(a). Enter in this step the total of your other 

estimated income for the year, if any. You shouldn’t include 
income from any jobs or self-employment. If you complete 
Step 4(a), you likely won’t have to make estimated tax 
payments for that income. If you prefer to pay estimated tax 
rather than having tax on other income withheld from your 
paycheck, see Form 1040-ES, Estimated Tax for Individuals.

Step 4(b). Enter in this step the amount from the 
Deductions Worksheet, line 5, if you expect to claim 
deductions other than the basic standard deduction on your 
2023 tax return and want to reduce your withholding to 
account for these deductions. This includes both itemized 
deductions and other deductions such as for student loan 
interest and IRAs.

Step 4(c). Enter in this step any additional tax you want 

withheld from your pay each pay period, including any 
amounts from the Multiple Jobs Worksheet, line 4. Entering 
an amount here will reduce your paycheck and will either 
increase your refund or reduce any amount of tax that you 
owe.

Step 2(b)—Multiple Jobs Worksheet  (Keep for your records.)

If you choose the option in Step 2(b) on Form W-4, complete this worksheet (which calculates the total extra tax for all jobs) on only 
ONE Form W-4. Withholding will be most accurate if you complete the worksheet and enter the result on the Form W-4 for the highest 
paying job. To be accurate, submit a new Form W-4 for all other jobs if you have not updated your withholding since 2019.

Note: If more than one job has annual wages of more than $120,000 or there are more than three jobs, see Pub. 505 for additional 
tables.

Two jobs. If you have two jobs or you’re married filing jointly and you and your spouse each have one
job, find the amount from the appropriate table on page 4. Using the “Higher Paying Job” row and the
“Lower Paying Job” column, find the value at the intersection of the two household salaries and enter 
that value on line 1. Then, skip to line 3  .

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
