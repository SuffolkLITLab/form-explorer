ORDER OF COMMITMENT TO THE  
DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH  
(On Stipulation to the Report of Examiner) 

Case Number 

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF__________________________________________________________________, ALABAMA  

(Name of County)  

STATE OF ALABAMA v. ______________________________________________________________________ Defendant  

           The  defendant  has  been  evaluated  by  a  psychologist  or  psychiatrist  to  assist  the  court  in  determining  the  defendant’s    
ability  to  assist  in  his  or  her  defense,  by  consulting  with  counsel,  with  a  reasonable  degree  of  rational  understanding  of  the 
facts and the legal proceedings against the defendant pending before this court for the offense(s) of __________________________ 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________. 
After  the  court  has  reviewed  the  written  report  of  the  psychologist  or  psychiatrist  and  after  the  parties  have  stipulated  to  the    
findings  in  the  report,  the  court  hereby  finds  that  the  defendant  is  incompetent,  and  that  there  is  (cid:133)  substantial  probability    
(cid:133)  no  substantial  probability  that  the  defendant  will  become  competent  within  a  reasonable  period  of  time.  The  court  further 
finds  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence  that  the  defendants  is  mentally  ill  or  has  a  mental  defect;  that  as  a  consequence  of  such 
mental  illness  or  defect,  poses  a  real  and  present  threat  of  substantial  harm  to  himself  or  herself  or  to  others.  Also,  the  court    
finds  that  the  defendant  will,  if  not  treated,  continue  to  suffer  mental  distress  and  will  continue  to  experience  deterioration  of
the  ability  to  function  independently,  and  that  the  defendant  is  unable  to  make  a  rational  and  informed  decision  as  to  whether 
or not such treatment would be desirable.  
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:  

(1) The defendant be committed to the custody of the Alabama Department of Mental Health to receive such 
treatment  as  is  required  for  the  defendant  to  attain  competency  and/or  minimize  or  abate  the  risk  of  harm  threatened by the 

defendant’s being at large.  

(2) If the defendant is in custody, the person who has custody of the defendant shall make the defendant available for 
admission  at  such  times  and  locations  as  required  by  the  Alabama  Department  of  Mental  Health  and,  where necessary, the 

Sheriff’s Department shall be responsible for the custody, care, and transportation of the defendant.  

(3)  The dis trict attorney  s hall make availabl e  to  the  examining  psychologist/psychiatrist  information  concerning  the 
nature  and  circumstances  of  the  offense(s)  charged,  as  well  as  the  prior  criminal  history  of  the  defendant.  The  defense 

attorney  may  provide  such  information  as  may  be  in  his/her  possession  to  assist  the  examining  psychologist/psychiatrist  in 

the  evaluation  and  treatment  of  the  defendant’s  mental  condition,  including  records  of  prior  psychiatric  treatment.  All 

information provided to the psychologist or psychiatrist pursuant to this order shall be protected from discovery according to 

Rule 16, Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure.  

(4)  Upon  completion  of  the  examination,  the  Alabama  Department  of  Mental  Health  shall  prepare a written report 

and file the original report with the clerk of court, under seal, regarding the defendant’s mental status within ninety-one (91) 
days after admission and every ninety-one (91) days thereafter. Copies of the report shall be provided to the  circuit  judge,  the 
defendant’s  attorney,  the  district  attorney,  and,  upon  further  order  of  the  court,  to  others  having  a  proper interest therein.  
(5)  The  defendant  shall  appear  in  a  hearing  before  this  court  within  six  (6)  months  of  admission  to  the  Alabama 
Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, a date and time to be set upon receipt of the second status report. The 

Sheriff’s Department shall be responsible for the custody, care and transportation of the defendant to and from this hearing.  

(6)  Upon the defendant’s earlier restoration to competency  or  determination  that  the  defendant  no  longer  poses  a  real 
and present threat of substantial harm to himself or herself or to others, the original written report shall be filed with the clerk 

of  court,  under  seal.  Copies  of  the  written  report  shall  be  provided  to  the  circuit  judge,  the  defendant’s  attorney,  the 

district attorney and, upon further order of the court, to others having a proper interest therein, and shall include the following 

information.

proceedings against the defendant;

(b) If it is the opinion of the psychologist or psychiatrist that the defendant lacks sufficient present ability to assist in

his/her  defense,  by  consulting  with  counsel,  with  a  reasonable  degree  of  rational  understanding  of  the  facts  and

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
