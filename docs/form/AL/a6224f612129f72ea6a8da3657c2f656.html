Certification of Health Care Provider for 
 
Employee’s Serious Health Condition 
 

 

U.S. Department of Labor 
 
Wage and Hour Division 
 

 

 

nder the Family and Medical Leave Act 
 

 
DO NOT SEND COMPLETED FORM TO THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. 
 
RETURN TO THE PATIENT. 
 

 u

 

 

 

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides that an employer may require an employee seeking FMLA protections 
 
because of a need for leave due to a serious health condition to submit a medical certification issued by the employee’s 
 
health care provider. 29 U.S.C. §§ 2613, 2614(c)(3); 29 C.F.R. § 825.305. The employer must give the employee at least 
 
15 calendar days to provide the certification. If the employee fails to provide complete and sufficient medical certification, 
 
his or her FMLA leave request may be denied. 29 C.F.R. § 825.313. Information about the FMLA may be found on the 
WHD website at www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION I – EMPLOYER 
 

 

Either the employee or the employer may complete Section I. While use of this form is optional, this form asks the health 
 
 
care provider for the information necessary for a complete and sufficient medical certification, which is set out at 29 C.F.R. 
§ 825.306. You may not ask the employee to provide more information than allowed under the FMLA regulations,
29 C.F.R. §§ 825.306-825.308. Additionally, you may not request a certification for FMLA leave to bond with a healthy
newborn child or a child placed for adoption or foster care.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

Employers  must  generally  maintain  records  and  documents  relating  to  medical  information,  medical  certifications, 
 
recertifications, or medical histories of employees created for FMLA purposes as confidential medical records in separate 
files/records  from  the  usual  personnel  files  and  in  accordance  with  29  C.F.R.  §  1630.14(c)(1),  if  the  Americans  with 
Disabilities  Act  applies, and  in accordance  with  29  C.F.R.  §  1635.9, if  the  Genetic  Information  Nondiscrimination  Act 
 
applies.

(2) Employer name:  ________________________________________________ Date:  _________________ (mm/dd/yyyy)

      

 
(List date certification requested) 

(3) The medical certification must be returned by ________________________________________________ (mm/dd/yyyy)
(Must allow at least 15 calendar days from the date requested, unless it is not feasible despite the employee’s diligent, good faith efforts.)

Employee’s regular work schedule: __________________________________________________________________
Statement of the employee’s essential job functions: ____________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
(The essential functions of the employee's position are determined with reference to the position the employee held at the time the employee 
notified the employer of the need for leave or the leave started, whichever is earlier.) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION II - HEALTH CARE PROVIDER 

 

 

 

Please provide your contact information, complete all relevant parts of this Section, and sign the form. Your patient has 
 
requested leave under the FMLA. The FMLA allows an employer to require that the employee submit a timely, complete, 
and sufficient medical certification to support a request for FMLA leave due to the serious health condition of the employee. 
For FMLA purposes, a “serious health condition” means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that 
 
involves inpatient care or continuing treatment by a health care provider. For more information about the definitions of a 
 
serious health condition under the FMLA, see the chart on page 4. 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You may, but are not required to, provide other appropriate medical facts including symptoms, diagnosis, or any regimen 
 
of continuing treatment such as the use of specialized equipment. Please note that some state or local laws may not allow 
 
disclosure of private medical information about the patient’s serious health condition, such as providing the diagnosis and/or 
 
 
 
course of treatment.

Definitions of a Serious Health Condition (See 29 C.F.R. §§ 825.113-.115)
 

 

 

 

Inpatient Care 
 

• An overnight stay in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility.
 
•
 
 

Inpatient care includes any period of incapacity or any subsequent treatment in connection with the overnight stay.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Continuing Treatment by a Health Care Provider (any one or more of the following) 
 

 

 

Incapacity Plus Treatment: A period of incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days, and any subsequent treatment 
 
 
or period of incapacity relating to the same condition, that also involves either: 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 
o Two or more in-person visits to a health care provider for treatment  within 30 days of the first day of incapacity unless
 

 

 

 

extenuating circumstances exist. The first visit must be within seven days of the first day of incapacity; or,
 

 

 

 
o At least one in-person visit to a health care provider for treatment within seven days of the first day of incapacity, which
 
results  in  a  regimen  of  continuing  treatment  under  the  supervision  of  the  health  care  provider.  For  example,  the  health
 
provider might prescribe a course of prescription medication or therapy requiring special equipment.
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Pregnancy: Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or for prenatal care. 
 

 

 
Chronic Conditions: Any period of incapacity due to or treatment for a chronic serious health condition, such as diabetes, asthma, 
migraine headaches. A chronic serious health condition is one which requires visits to a health care provider (or nurse supervised by 
 
the provider) at least twice a year and recurs over an extended period of time. A chronic condition may cause episodic rather than a 
 
continuing period of incapacity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Permanent  or  Long-term  Conditions:  A  period  of  incapacity  which  is  permanent  or  long-term  due  to  a  condition  for  which 
 
treatment may not be effective, but which requires the continuing supervision of a health care provider, such as Alzheimer’s disease 
or the terminal stages of cancer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Conditions Requiring Multiple Treatments: Restorative surgery after an accident or other injury; or, a condition that would likely 
result in a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days if the patient did not receive the treatment.
