      <pre>Certification for Serious Injury or Illness of a 
Current Servicemember for Military Caregiver Leave 
under the Family and Medical Leave Act 

U.S. Department of Labor 
  Wage Hour Division 

DO NOT SEND COMPLETED FORM TO THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. 
RETURN TO THE PATIENT.  

OMB Control Number: 1235-0003 
 Expires:  6/30/2023 

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides that eligible employees may take FMLA leave to care for a covered 
servicemember with a serious illness or injury. The FMLA allows an employer to require an employee seeking FMLA leave 
for this purpose to submit a medical certification. 29 U.S.C. §§ 2613, 2614(c)(3). The employer must give the employee at 
least 15 calendar days to provide the certification. If the employee fails to provide complete and sufficient certification, 
his or her FMLA leave request may be denied. 29 C.F.R. § 825.313. Information about the FMLA may be found on the 
WHD website at www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla. 

SECTION I - EMPLOYER 

Either the employee or the employer may complete Section I. While use of this form is optional, it asks the health care 
provider for the information necessary for a complete and sufficient medical certification. You may not ask the employee 
to provide more information than allowed under the FMLA regulations, 29 C.F.R. § 825.310. Recertifications are 
not allowed for FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember. Where medical certification is requested by an 
employer, an employee may not be held liable for administrative delays in the issuance of military documents, despite 
the employee's diligent, good-faith efforts to obtain such documents. An employer requiring an employee to submit a 
certification for leave to care for a covered servicemember must accept as sufficient certification invitational travel orders 
(ITOs) or invitational travel authorizations (ITAs) issued to any family member to join an injured or ill servicemember at 
the servicemember’s bedside. An ITO or ITA is sufficient certification for the duration of time specified in the ITO or ITA. 

Employers  must  generally  maintain  records  and  documents  relating  to  medical  information,  medical  certifications, 
recertifications,  or  medical  histories  of  employees  or  employees’  family  members  created  for  FMLA  purposes  as 
confidential medical records in separate files/records from the usual personnel files and in accordance with 29 C.F.R. § 
1630.14(c)(1), if the Americans with Disabilities Act applies, and in accordance with 29 C.F.R. § 1635.9, if the Genetic 
Information Nondiscrimination Act applies.

First 

Last 

(2) Employer name:  ________________________________________________ Date:  ________________ (mm/dd/yyyy)

 (List date certification requested) 

(3) This certification must be returned by: _____________________________________________________ (mm/dd/yyyy)
(Must allow at least 15 calendar days from the date requested, unless it is not feasible despite the employee’s diligent, good faith efforts.)

SECTION II - EMPLOYEE and/or CURRENT SERVICEMEMBER 

Please complete all Parts of Section II before having the servicemember’s health care provider complete Section III. The 
FMLA allows an employer to require that an employee submit a timely, complete, and sufficient certification to support a 
request for FMLA leave due to a serious injury or illness of a covered servicemember. If requested by your employer, your 
response is required to obtain or retain the benefit of FMLA-protected leave.  

PART A:  EMPLOYEE INFORMATION

 Spouse

 Parent

Spouse  means  a  husband  or wife  as  defined  or  recognized  in  the  state  where  the  individual  was  married,  including  a  common  law 
marriage or same-sex marriage. The terms “child” and “parent” include in loco parentis relationships in which a person assumes the 
obligations of a parent to a child. An employee may take FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember who assumed the obligations 
of  a  parent  to  the  employee  when  the  employee  was  a  child.  An  employee  may  also  take  FMLA  leave  to  care  for  a  covered 
servicemember for whom the employee has assumed the obligations of a parent. No biological or legal relationship is necessary. “Next 
of kin” is the servicemember’s nearest blood relative, other than the spouse, parent, son, or daughter, in the following order of priority: 
(1) a blood relative as designated in writing by the servicemember for purposes of FMLA leave, (2) blood relatives granted legal custody
of the servicemember, (3) brothers and sisters, (4) grandparents, (5) aunts and uncles, and (6) first cousins.

SECTION III - HEALTH CARE PROVIDER 

Please provide your contact information, complete all Parts of this Section fully and completely, and sign the form below. 
The employee listed at Section I has requested leave under the FMLA to care for a family member who is a current member 
of the Regular Armed Forces, the National Guard, or the Reserves who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or 
therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list for a serious injury or illness. 
Note: For purposes of FMLA leave, a serious injury or illness is one that was incurred in the line of duty on active duty in 
the Armed Forces or that existed before the beginning of the member’s active duty and was aggravated by service in the 
line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces that may render the servicemember medically unfit to perform the duties of 
the servicemember’s office, grade, rank, or rating. “Need for care” includes both physical and psychological care. It includes 
situations where, for example, due to his or her serious injury or illness, the servicemember is not able to care for his or her 
own basic medical, hygienic, or nutritional needs or safety, or needs transportation to the doctor. It also includes providing 
psychological comfort and reassurance which would be beneficial to the servicemember who is receiving inpatient or home

a condition, treatment, etc. Your answer should be your best estimate based upon your medical knowledge, experience, and examination
