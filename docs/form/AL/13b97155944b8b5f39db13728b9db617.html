Should the District Attorney not file a forfeiture action pursuant to Sections 20-2-93(e)(3) and (f), Ala. Code 1975, after 90 days 
from the date of this  Order, if the  undersigned  judge  dismisses  the  case  due  to  inaction,  the  property  shall be made available by 
the seizing agency for  return  to  the  owner,  upon  documented proof of ownership,  within  14  days  after  the  dismissal  EXCEPT

underlying  investigation  or  case,  OR  (2)  if  the  property  is  contraband  in  which  case  it  shall  be  destroyed at  the  conclusion  of
the criminal case, should it not be needed or used as evidence pursuant to Sections 20-2-93(e)(3) and/or (f), Ala. Code 1975.

[    ] Upon request of the applicant, pursuant to Section 20-2-93(e)(2)b., Ala. Code, 1975, this filing, the case file and all contents
