RIGHTS YOU HAVE AND WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHTS 
TRIAL  

Under the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution and laws of the State of Alabama, you have a right to remain silent and you may not be 
compelled to give evidence against yourself. You attorney cannot disclose any confidential talks he/she has had with you. You are not required to answer any 
questions. If you do answer questions knowing that you have a right to remain silent, you will have waived this right. You have the right to enter, and continue 
to assert, a plea of “Not Guilty” or “Not Guilty by Reason of Mental Disease or Defect,” and have a public trial before a duly selected jury. The jury would 
decide your guilt or innocence based upon the evidence presented before them.  If you elect to proceed to trial, you would have the right to be present, you 
would have the right to have your attorney present to assist you, you would have the right to confront and cross examine your accuser(s) and all the State’s 
witnesses, you would have the right to subpoena witnesses to testify on your behalf and to have their attendance in court and their testimony required by the 
court, and you would have the right to take the witness stand and to testify, but only if you choose to do so, as no one can require you to do this. If you elect to 
testify, you can be cross examined by the State, just as any other witness is subjected to cross examination. If you decide not to testify, no one but your attorney 
will be allowed to comment about that fact to the jury. Your attorney is bound to do everything he/she can, honorably and reasonably, for you to obtain a fair 
and impartial trial. If you elect to proceed to trial, you come to court presumed to be innocent. This presumption of innocence will follow you throughout the 
trial until the State produces sufficient evidence to convince the jury (or the court if the trial is non-jury) of your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. You have no 
burden of proof in this case. If the State fails to meet its burden, you would be found not guilty. If you are entering a guilty plea to a charge for which you have 
not yet been indicted, you are waiving indictment by a grand jury and you will be pleading guilty to a charge preferred against you by a District Attorney’s 
Information filed with the court. If you are not a United States citizen, a guilty plea may subject you to adverse immigration consequences, including 
deportation (See 8 U.S.C. §1227), exclusion from reentry to the United States and amnesty, and that the appropriate consulate may be informed of the plea and 
conviction. 
 

DEPARTURE SENTENCE 
(Check if applicable) 

____You have the right to notice seven days prior to trial of any aggravating factor the state intends to assert in your case and you have the right to a trial by 
jury as to the existence of that factor.  The state bears the burden of proving sufficient evidence to convince the jury (or the court if the trial is non-jury) of the 
existence of that factor beyond a reasonable doubt.  You have the right to assert mitigating factors for presentation to the sentencing trial judge by giving the 
sentencing judge notice of such factors no less than 7 days prior to sentencing.  You bear the burden of proving by sufficient evidence to convince the court by 
a preponderance of the evidence that such factor exists. 
 

WAIVER 
If you plead guilty, (___ and admit the aggravating factors) there will be no trial. You will be waiving your rights outlined above, except your rights relating to 
representation by an attorney. The state will have nothing  to prove and you will stand guilty on your guilty plea. By entering a plea of guilty, YOU WILL 
ALSO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL, unless in appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeals or the Supreme Court (1) you have before entering the plea 
of guilty, expressly reserved the right to appeal with respect to a particular issue or issues, in which event appellate review shall be limited to a determination of 
the issue or issues reserved, (2) you have timely filed a motion to withdraw the plea of guilty after pronouncement of sentence on the ground that the 
withdrawal is necessary to correct a manifest injustice, and the court has denied your motion to withdraw your plea, or the motion has been deemed denied by 
operation of law. 
 

2 

IF YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO APPEAL UNDER ONE OF THE CONDITIONS ABOVE AND YOU ARE DETERMINED BY THE COURT TO BE 
INDIGENT, COUNSEL WILL BE APPOINTED TO REPRESENT YOU ON APPEAL IF YOU SO DESIRE AND IF THE APPEAL IS FROM A CIRCUIT 
COURT JUDGMENT OR SENTENCE, A COPY OF THE RECORD AND REPORTER’S TRANSCRIPT WILL BE PROVIDED AT NO COST TO YOU. 
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS OR THE CONSEQUENCES OF PLEADING GUILTY, PLEASE LET THE COURT KNOW 
NOW AND FURTHER EXPLANATION WILL BE MADE.

explained; that I understand the charge or charges against me; that I understand my rights, the punishment or punishments provided by law as they may apply

not been threatened or abused or offered any inducement, reward, or hope of reward to plead guilty other than the terms of the plea agreement which will be 
stated on the record. I further state to the court that I am guilty of the charge to which I am entering a plea of guilty, that I desire to plead guilty, that I made up 
my own mind to plead guilty and that I knowingly and intelligently, and voluntarily waive my right to trial in this case (___ and I admit the existence of the 
aggravating factors). I further state that I am satisfied with my attorney’s services and his/her handling of my case.
