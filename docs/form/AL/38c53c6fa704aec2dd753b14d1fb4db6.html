Other. . . RIGHTS YOU HAVE AND WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHTS . TRIAL . Under the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution and laws of the State of Alabama, you have a right to remain silent and you may not be . compelled to give evidence against yourself. You attorney cannot disclose any confidential talks he/she has had with you. You are not required to answer any . questions. If you do answer questions knowing that you have a right to remain silent, you will have waived this right. You have the right to enter, and continue . . and have a public trial before a duly selected jury. The jury would . decide your guilt or innocence based upon the evidence presented before them. If you elect to proceed to trial, you would have the right to be present, you . . would have the right to have your attorney present to assist you, you would have the right to confront and cross examine your accuser (s) a. . witnesses, you would have the right to subpoena witnesses to testify on your behalf and to have their attendance in court and their testimony required by the . . court, and you would have the right to take the witness stand and to testify, but only if you choose to do so, as no one can require you to do this. If you elect to . . testify, you can be cross examined by the State, just as any other witness is subjected to cross examination. If you decide not to testify, no one but your attorney . . will be allowed to comment about that fact to the jury. Your attorney is bound to do everything he/she can, honorably and reasonably, for you to obtain a fair . and impartial trial. If you elect to proceed to trial, you come to court presumed to be innocent. This presumption of innocence will follow you throughout the . trial until the State produces sufficient evidence to convince the jury (or the court if the trial is non jury) of your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. You have no . . burden of proof in this case. If the State fails to meet its burden, you would be found not guilty. If you are entering a guilty plea to a charge for which you have . . not yet been indicted, you are waiving indictment by a grand jury and you will be pleading guilty to a charge preferred . . Information filed with the court. If you are not a United States citizen, a guilty plea may subject you to adverse immigration consequences, including . . deportation (See 8 U. S. C. §1227) , exclusion from reentry to the United States and amnesty, and that the appropriate consulate may be informed of the plea and . conviction. . DEPARTURE SENTENCE . (Check if applicable) . . You have the right to notice seven days prior to trial of any aggravating factor the state intends to assert in your case and you have the right to a trial by . jury as to the existence of that factor. The state bears the burden of proving sufficient evidence to convince the jury (or the court if the trial is non jury) of the . . existence of that factor beyond a reasonable doubt. You have the right to assert mitigating factors for presentation to the sentencing trial judge by giving the . sentencing judge notice of such factors no less than 7 days prior to sentencing. You bear the burden of proving by sufficient evidence to convince the court by . a preponderance of the evidence that such factor exists. . . WAIVER . If you plead guilty, . ( and admit the aggravating factors) there will be no trial. You will be waiving your rights outlined above, except your rights relating to . representation by an attorney. The state will have nothing to prove and you will stand guilty on your guilty plea. By entering a. plea of guilty. , YOU WILL . ALSO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL. , unless in appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeals or the Supreme Court (1) you have before entering the plea . of guilty, expressly reserved the right to appeal with respect to a particular issue or issues, in which event appellate review shall be limited to a determination of . . the issue or issues reserved, (2) you have timely filed a motion to withdraw the plea of guilty after pronouncement of sentence on the ground that the . withdrawal is necessary to correct a manifest injustice, and the court has denied your motion to withdraw your plea, or the motion has been deemed denied by . operation of law. . IF YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO APPEAL UNDER ONE OF THE CONDITIONS ABOVE AND YOU ARE DETERMINED BY THE COURT TO BE . INDIGENT, COUNSEL WILL BE APPOINTED TO REPRESENT YOU ON APPEAL IF YOU SO DESIRE AND IF THE APPEAL IS FROM A CIRCUIT . . COURT . . IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS OR THE CONSEQUENCES OF PLEADING GUILTY, PLEASE LET THE COURT KNOW . . NOW AND FURTHER EXPLANATION WILL BE MADE. . . . The court. , having personally addressed the defendant, determines that the defendant has entered the plea voluntarily (. ) . and has voluntarily . admitted to the existence of the following aggravating factors. . . . . . . . Date. Judge . . . I certify that the above was fully read to the defendant by me; that I explained the penalty or penalties involved with the defendant; that I discussed in detail . . . and that he/she is knowingly, . voluntarily, and intelligently waiving his/her rights and entering a voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty. I further certify to the court that I have in no way . . forced or induced the defendant to plead guilty and to my knowledge no one else has done so. . . . Date . . Attorney . . I certify to the court that my attorney has read and explained the matters set forth above; that my rights have been discussed with me in detail and fully . . explained; that I understand the charge or charges against me; that I understand my rights, the punishment or punishments provided by law as they may appl. y to my case, and I understand the consequences of pleading guilty; that I am not under the influence of any drugs, medicines, or alcoholic beverages; and I have . not been threatened or abused or offered any inducement, reward, or hope of reward to plead guilty other than the terms of the plea agreement which will be . stated on the record. I further state to the court that I am guilty of the charge to which I am entering a plea of guilty, that I desire to plead guilty, that I made up . . my own mind to plead guilty and that I knowingly and intelligently, and voluntarily waive my right to trial in this case ( and I admit the existence of the . aggravating factors) . . . .
