      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF MORGAN COUNTY, ALABAMA . STATE OF ALABAMA, . PLAINTIFF, . CASE NO. CC . VS. . DEFENDANT. . NOTICE AND WAIVER OF INDIGENCY STATUS . NOTICE . Comes now the State of Alabama and serves notice upon the De. fendant that under Alabama law . and the applicable Rules of . Court, the Defendant is entitled to have a due process hearing for the purpose of determining whether he will be ordered to pay. restitution and, if so, in what amount. . At such a hearing, the Defendant would be entitled to be rep. resented by an attorney. The hear. ing would be before a judge and . without a jury. The Defendant would be entitled to be heard a. nd would be allowed to present evidence and call witnesses. The De. fendant . or his counsel would be permitted to confront and cross examin. e any witnesses called by the State of Alabama to testify against. him. The . Court would then be required to enter a written orde. r and findings of fact to support its decision. . Before the Court could order any restitution. to be paid, the financial resources a. nd obligations of the Defendant and the . burden that payment of court ordered restitution would impose on . him would be taken into consideration in determining how much, . if . any, restitution should be ordered. Where the imposition of a fi. ne is being considered by the Court, the trial judge is similar. ly required to . take into consideration, among other things, the financial status of the Defendant before it imposes such a penalty. Docket fee. s and other . costs of court are also required to be assessed upon conviction. . If the Court orders restitution, fines or costs to be paid, and the Defendant fails to pay as directed, the Court may cause an . investigation to be made into the Defendant's financial, employment and family standing and the reasons for non payment, includ. ing . whether non payment was willful and inte. ntional or due to "indigency" - the inability to pay as a result of poverty. . Before any remedial action could be taken by the Court, a due . process hearing, similar to the one described above, would be . held. The Court could, as a result of such a hearing, reduce the . amount of the obligation to a sum that the Defendant is able t. o pay, . continue or modify the schedule of payments, direct that the De. fendant be incarcerated until the . unpaid balance is paid (subjec. t to . Rule . 26. 11, Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedures) , . or order the Defendant's wages withheld. In . the case of fines and costs, the Defendant . could be released from the obligation altogether. If restitution, . fines or costs were ordered as a result of a traffic infracti. on, the . Defendant's privilege to drive . could be suspended until the obligation has been satisfied. . In addition, willful failure to pay could be punished by contempt. of court. Also, if payment of . restitution, fines or costs hav. e been . made a condition of probation or parole, the willful non payment of these obligations could result in the revocation of those p. rivileges, . the modification of those privileges or the extension of those privileges. . Indigency, or the financial inability to provide for one's own support, is both a factor in determining the amount of restituti. on, . fines and costs to be ordered and the conditions of payment. In addition, indigency or a plea of poverty is a defense to the no. n payment. In . Alabama, an indigent Defendant cannot be incarcerated for th. e inability to pay a fine, court costs, or restitution. . WAIVER . After discussion and negotiation between the parties, after a fu. ll explanation of rights has been given to the Defendant as . evidenced by the attached Explanation of Ri. ghts form, and after such disclosure of in. formation between the parties as each deem. s sufficient, it is agreed in this case, s. ubject to acceptance by the Court, that the Defendant knowingly and voluntarily agrees . to confess the . restitution claims made by the State in this cause and that . the Defendant knowingly and voluntarily agrees to waive his right t. o plead poverty or to assert a claim of indigency, should he subseque. ntly fail to honor the payment provisions of the agreement. This w. aiver is made a part of and is given in consideration of the plea agreement reached in this cause by the Defendant and the State of Alab. ama. In . addition, the Defendant agrees to fully and timely pay any fines . and court costs imposed in this case. The defendant understand. s and agrees . that payments will be deducted from any money or earnings that he receives, from any sou. rce whatsoever, during any term of . incarceration imposed as a result of the plea agreement reached . between the Defendant and the State of Alabama (this includes, . but is not . limited to, any earnings from work release or prisoner deposits, etc. ) . The Defendant agrees to pay over, deliver, convey, tran. sfer, or assign . any income or assets to which he is entitled while incarcerated to. the Clerk of the Court or to cause the same to be done in or. der to satisfy the . ) . ) ) ) . ) ) ) ) terms and provisions of his plea agreement. It is further agree. d that any restitution, fines or . costs ordered pursuant to the D. efendant's plea . agreement with the State of Alabama will be made a condition of any probation ordered by the Court, regardless of the position . taken by the . State of Alabama with reference to the granting of probation. Should probation be ordered and subsequently revoked, it is agree. d by the . parties that any restitution, fines or costs ordere. d shall be made a condition of any future parole. . The Defendant understands that by signing this waiver, he is giving up his right to assert an indigency defense in any future . contempt proceedings, probation revocation proceedings, or parole. revocation proceedings, the basis of which is non payment of . restitution, . fines or costs in the instant case. The Defendant acknowledges that. he would not only be barred from pleading poverty or indige. ncy as a . defense in such actions, but that attempts to raise such a defe. nse by him would act to make the plea agreement reached in the a. bove styled case voidable by the District Attorney. . IN MAKING THIS WAIVER, THE DEFENDANT UNDERSTANDS . THAT HE IS GIVING UP HIS RIGHT TO CLAIM . THAT HE IS UNABLE OR INCAPABLE OF COMPLYING WITH . THE PAYMENT PROVISIONS OF HIS PLEA AGREEMENT. . THE DEFENDANT UNDERSTANDS AND ANTICIPATES THAT ANY FAILURE ON HIS BEHALF TO HONOR THOSE . PROVISIONS OF HIS PLEA AGREEMEN. T WILL RESULT IN HIM BEING HELD IN CONTEMPT OF COURT, HAVING HIS . . PROBATION REVOKED, OR H. AVING HIS PAROLE REVOKED. HE ENTERS INTO THIS WAIVER FOR THE PURPOSE OF . RECEIVING THE BENEFITS OF THE NEGOTI. ATED PLEA, AND, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH . HIS ATTORNEY, OR, IF HE . IS ACTING . PRO . SE, AFTER HAVING HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH THE COURT REGARDING ANY . QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS WAIVER BASED UPON A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT HE WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT . FUNDS AVAILABLE TO HIM TO MEET THE TERMS OF THE P. AYMENT PROVISIONS OF HIS PLEA AGREEMENT WHEN . THEY BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE. The Defendant st. ates to the Court that he has read, or has had read to him, the matters and rights. hereinabove set forth, as well as those explained by the Court; th. at his attorney has discussed sa. id matters and rights with hi. m in detail, . or, if he is acting pro se, . the Court has afforded him an opportunity to ask any questions about this waiver, and the Defendant fully . understands its content and meaning; that he is not under the influence of any drugs, medicines, or alcoholic beverages and has. not been . threatened or abused or offered any inducement or reward to get him to execute this agreement. . Having read and understood the foregoing, I agree to: . waive my right to claim indigency or enter a plea of poverty in any subsequent proceedings resulting from . . the nonpayment of court costs in this case. . waive my right to claim indigency or enter a plea of poverty in any subsequent proceedings resulting from . the nonpayment of fines in this case. . waive my right to claim indigency or enter a plea poverty in any subsequent proceedings resulting from . the nonpayment of restitution in this case. . SHOULD YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WHATSOEVER CONC. ERNING THIS DOCUMENT, DO NOT SIGN IT UNTIL . YOU HAVE ADDRESSED THOSE QUESTIONS TO THE COURT. . Date . Defendant . I am the attorney for the above referenced Defendant, and I certify that the preceding notice and waiver were read by the . Defendant in my presence, or were read to him by me, that I disc. ussed such rights with the Defendant in detail and that a writt. en copy of the above rights were given to the Defendant by me. Having gone over his rights and the consequences of this waiver, I am of th. e opinion that . the Defendant under stands his right to plea. d poverty or to claim indigency and know. ingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive. s said right.
