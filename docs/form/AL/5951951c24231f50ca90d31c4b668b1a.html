ALABAMA'S  FOREIGN LANGUAGE  COURT INTERPRETER  PROGRAM

1. THE ALABAMA  ADMINISTRATIVE  OFFICE  OF COURTS

The Alabama  Administrative  Office  of Courts  (AOC)  is an office created by Alabama's
Constitution  with many responsibilities  including the general  administration  of Alabama's
Unified Judicial system  (uJS). The Aoc is located in Montgomery,  Alabama.

The  AOC,  under the direction of the Administrative  Director of Courts,  is responsible  for
providing centralized-administrative  support  for the proper operation  of Alabama's  state
court system.  This support includes the development  of procedures  and systems
necessary  for the state  court's efficient operation,  and the collections and dissemination
of information  needed  for the continued  development  of these  procedures  and systems.

The AOC carries  out these responsibilities through a network  of specialized divisions,
including  the AOC  Legal Division.  The  Legal Division  has been given the opportunity  to
develop and implement  the Foreign Language  Court lnterpreter  Program for Alabama's
Unified Judicial System.

2. ALABAMA,S  POLCIES  & PROCEDURES  FOR FOREIGN LANGUAGE  COURT  INTERPRETERS

Alabama's  laws and rules require Alabama's  courts to provide qualified  foreign  language
interpreters.

A. Criminal and Juvenile  Proceedings

The Alabama  law requires  the court to provide a "qualified"  interpreter  in all criminal  and
juvenile  proceedings.  This law states that the party or witness must inform  the court of
his or her need for an interpreter.  After  the court determines that an interpreter  if
required, the court shall appoint  a "qualified"  individual to interpret the proceedings  for
the party or witness requiring  such assistance.

Upon the court's appointment, an interpreter shall swear  under oath that he or she will
render a true and clear interpretation to the best of his or her skill and judgment.  After
providing this service for the court, the interpreter  shall submit his or her expenses  to the
judge for approval,  and upon approval,  the interpreter  shall forward his or her claim  form
to the state Comptroller  to be paid.

{s

B. Civil Proceedings

ln civil proceedings,  Rule 43(f) of the Alabama  Rules of Civil Procedure  state
that the court may appoint  a qualified  interpreter and determine the
interpreter's reasonable compensation. ln civil cases, the interpreter's  fees
and expenses are paid pursuant to Rule 43(f), and may be taxed as costs to
one or more parties.

ln 2008, the Administrative  Office of Courts adopted  Policies  and Procedures
for Foreign Language lnterpreters.  These  policies and procedures  are not
unlike those adopted and enforced by numerous  other states that are now
members  of the NCSC Consortium  for Language  Access  in the Courts.  These
Policies  and Procedures  are located on AOC's website www.Alacourt.gov and
are also on pages  9 - 64 of this presentation. They address  many foreign
la nguage cou rt i nterpreter issues, i ncl ud i ng el igi bi  I ity, registration,
certification,  appointment, responsibilities,  compensation,  conduct, ethics,
and discipline.

3. WHAT ARE 

FOREIGN  LANGUAGE  INTERPERTERS

,,CERTIFIED" 

Under Alabama law, Alabama's courts  are required  to appoint qualified foreign
language  court interpreters.  Alabama  Policies  and Procedures  for Foreign
Language lnterpreters  further identifies the method by which an interpreter
becomes certified,  outlines interpreter qualifications and responsibilities  and
gives best practices  for providing  foreign language  court interpreter service.

The first step for an individual to become a certified  court interpreter  for
Alabama's courts is to register with the AOC.

4. HOW DOES AN INTERPRETER  REGISTER  WITH THE AOC?

An individual  who wishes to provide foreign language  interpreter service in
Alabama's courts must first register with the AOC by completing and returning
the Foreign Language lnterpreter  Application  Registration Form to the AOC
(www.Alacourt.gov under the ICON  "INTERPRETERS").

{.

Registration also includes  the return of the authorization  form
(www.Alacourt.gov under the ICON "INTERPRETERS")  allowing  the AOC to
conduct a criminal background  check  and the E-Verify  Form
(www.Alacourt.gov under  the ICON "INTERPRETERS" - this form does have to
be notarized).

After an interpreter properly registers  with the AOC, the interpreter's name
and contact information is then listed on AOC's  Foreign Language lnterpreter
ln-House  Registry. Once an interpreter passes the written exam the
interpreter's name is then moved to AOC's  Foreign Language lnterpreter
Registry. This registry  is maintained on the AOC's website and is available  to
Alabama's  judges, to attorneys,  and to the general  public.

After registering,  dh interpreter  who must update  or change  any personal
information, including interpreter's mailing  address;  or who wishes  to be
removed from the AOC's  Registry,  must send this information or request in
writing to the AOC at the following  address:

interpreter  when, in the discretion of the court, an interpreter  is necessary.
(See Ala. Code (1975) S1s-1-3).

Section  3.2 Appointing and Scheduling

A. Registered  and Certified  lnterpreters

The AOC shall maintain  an AOC FLI Registry of individual authorized to provide
interpreting  services  in Alabama's  courts.  The appointment and scheduling  of
a qualified interpreter  remains  the function of the local court.

The court shall give prefurence  to an AOC certified  interpreter.

When a certified interpreter listed on the AOC FLI Registry is not reasonable
available,  the court may use a qualified interpreter of the court's own
selection. While an NES individual may request to use a volunteer  interpreteq
the court  shall not use this volunteer  to serve  as the court's interpreter unless
that person can otherwise  be qualified  by the court and no party expresses a
founded  objection.  When appointing  an interpreter, the court  should  consider
the following:

1. The interpreter's native  language;

2. How the interpreter learned  English or the foreign  language;

3. The interpreter's education and formal  study of English  and/or  foreign
language;

{.

4. The interpreter's mastery  of English and the foreign  language;

5. The interpreter's knowledge  of idioms,  slang,  and dialect  in both languages;

6. The interpreter's knowledge of legal or other specialized terminology;

7. Any training or experience  the interpreter  has in interpreting or translating  in other
contexts;

8. Whether  the interpreter  is familiar  with the Foreign Language  lnterpreters' Code of
Professiona I Responsibi  I ity;  a nd

9. Whetherthe  interpreter  is able to interpret  in the simultaneous and/or consecutive
modes of  i nterpretation.

The court shall advise any qualified  interpreter  not listed  on the AOC  FLI Registry to
immediately  register  with  AOC.

B. Foreign  Languages  OtherThan  Spanish

When an interpreter  is requested  to provide services in a foreign  language other than
Spanish,  the court may contact the AOC for information  that may  assist the court in
providing a qualified  interpreter;  and the court shall appoint  a qualified  interpreter
pursuant  to Ala.  Code  (1975)  5 15-1-3.  lf not listed  on the AOC  FLI Registry,  the
interpreter appointed  by the court  shall  immediately  register  with the AOC.

Section 3.3 Form for Payment

When  requesting payment  for interpreter services, interpreters  shall submit  each request
as required  by the AOC  and the state Comptroller. The interpreter's request  for payment
shall  be submitted, reviewed and approved pursuant  to Ala. code  (1975)  S 15-1-3.

Section 3.4 RemovalorWithdrawalof  an lnterpreterfrom  a Case

After an interpreter's appointment,  the court may determine  that an interpreter  is not
adequately competent, has engaged in misconduct, or is otherwise  unable to perform  the
requested necessary interpreting services, orthat  the interpreter  is not necessary.  The
court may in its discretion  remove the interpreter.  Similarly, a qualified  interpreter  should
immediately  notify  the court if unable to adequately perform  the interpreter services as

{.'

appointed.  Should such removal  involve interpreter misconduct,  the court
shall promptly report this misconduct  to the ADC in writing, and the ADC or
named designee  shall conduct an investigation  and take further action as may
be required.

Section  3.5 Oath

Pursuant  to Ala. Code (1975) S 15-1-3, the interpreter,  upon appointment,
"shall swear under oath that he or she will render a true and clear
interpretation to the best of his or her skill and judgment".

Examplei  "l,John Smith,  upon appointment by the court  as interpreter;  do
swear or affirm that I will, to the best of my skills and judgment, make a true
and clear interpretation of all court proceedings  into the foreign language
(party/witnessluror)  understands,  and that I will
which
interpret
into the English language.

's (party/witness/juror)  statements  for the court

tn addition to Ala. Code (1975) 5 15-1-3 that applies to all criminal and juvenile
court proceedings,  Rule 604 of the Alabama  Rules of Evidence addresses  an
interpreter's expert qualifications and requires the interpreter  to give
affirmation  for making a true interpretation. Also, Rule 43(f) of the Alabama
Rules of Civil procedure  addresses foreign  language  interpreters  requested in
civil proceedings.

Section  3.5 Need for More than One lnterpreter

The demands of courtroom interpreting, particularly simultaneous
interpreting, may cause  an interpreter  to need assistance.  Accordingly,  for
lengthy  cases or complex  litigation, the court may choose  to appoint  more
than one qualified interpreter.  The court should consider  securing more than
one interpreter  for such a proceeding.

{..

Section 3.7 Appointment by Docket

It is often known to the court that an interpreter has been requested  and/or
required in many  cases on a court's docket, and that a qualified interpreter
must be provided. Accordingly,  the qualified interpreter may provide  services
for each of these cases and be compensated  pursuant  to contractualterms
agreed upon by the interpreter and the Administrative  Office of Courts.

SEgflON  4 - CONDUST  AND FTHICS OF A FOREIGN  LANGUAGE  INTERPREIER

Section  4.1 General Conduct  and Responsibilities

At all times, the court interpreter shall act in a manner consistent  with the
following  general conduct and principals:

(a) lnterpreters  are officers of the court  and shall conduct themselves  in a
courteous, professional  and responsible  manner.

(b) lnterpreters  should know and observe the court's established  protocol,
rules, and procedures when delivering interpreting  services. When speaking
English, interpreters should  speak at a rate and a votume that enables  them to
be heard and understood throughout the courtroom, but the interpreter's
presence  should otherwise  be as unobtrusive as possible.

(c) lnterpreters  should  dress in a mannerthat is consistent with the dignity of
the court.

(d) lnterpreters  shall refrain  from making any type of referrats (e.g. to
bondsmen,  attorneys, etc.).

(e) lnterpreters  shall adhere to all instructions given by the court in which  their
services  are being used.

(f) lnterpreters  shall honestly  and
training  and certification(s).

accu rately represent  their ed ucation,

{s

(g) lnterpreters  shall adhere to the Foreign Language lnterpreters' Code of
Professiona I Responsi  bi  I ity.

(h) lnterpreters  shall continually seek to enhance and refine their skills and
knowledge  through  continued  interpreter education and training.

Section 4.2The Proper  Role of the lnterpreter

At all times, a court interpreter shall act in the following manner:

(a) lnterpreters  shall interpret completely and accurately.  lnterpreters  shall
not alter the meaning of the statements  they are interpreting.  lnterpreters
shall not interject personal words, phrases or expressions. lnterpreters  shall
not elaborate  or explain the statements  they are interpreting.  lnterpreters
shall not correct misstatements,  even when a misstatement is an obvious
error (e.g. should  a witness  answer an incorrect date of "L899" rather  than
"1ggg").

(b) lnterpreters  shall accurately convey the tone and register of the statements
they are interpreting.

(c) lnterpreters  shall inform the court immediately  if they become concerned
about their ability to interpret in accordance  with these policies and
procedures  in a particular  proceeding  or for a particular  person. (e.9., the
interpreter cannot understand  the defendant's language,  or personally  knows
the witness or defendant, or has strong opinions regarding the case.)

(d) lnterpreters  shall notifythe court if there is any environmental  or physical
limitation that impedes or hinders their ability to deliver interpreting  services
adequately  (e.g., the courtroom is not quiet enough for the interpreter to hear
or be heard by the non-English speaker; more than one person at a time is
speaking; or parties or witnesses  are speaking  at a rate of speed that is too
rapid for the interpreter  to adequately interpret).

{s

(e) lnterpreters  shall notify  the court of the need to take periodic  breaks in order to
maintain  mental and physical  alertness  or prevent interpreter fatigue.

(f) lnterpreters  are encouraged  to make inquiries as to the nature of a case  whenever
possible  before  accepting an assignment.  This enables interpreters  to match more closely
their professional  qualifications,  skills,  and experience  to potential assignments.

(g) lnterpreters  should refrain from accepting a case  when the language, dialect or subject
matter of the case is likely  to exceed  their skills or capabilities.

(h) lnterpreters  shall not give legal  advise or express  personal  opinions  to individuals  for
whom  they are interpreting.

(i) lnterpreters  may interpret  legal  advise  given by an attorney  to an individual  requiring
an interpreter.  An interpreter  may translate  language  n a form for an individual who is
completing  the form.

(j) lnterpreters  should initiate communications  during  a proceeding  when they find it
necessary  to seek assistance  in performing  their  duties, but should do so in third person
(e.9., "The interpreter  requests that the question  be repeated, clarified,  etc...").

(k) The interpreter  shall not perform acts that are the official responsibility of other court
officials.

Section 4.3 lmpartiality  and Confidentiality

Each  registered,  certified or otherwise  qualified  interpreter appointed  by Alabama's
courts shall agree to each of the following:

(a) lnterpreters  shall remain impartial.  lnterpreters  shall not engage in conduct that
allows the appearance  of partiality. lnterpreters  shall disclose to the court any possible
conflict of interest.  Any condition  that may interfere  with the objectivity of the
interpreter  may be considered  a conflict  of interest.

Examples  of actual and apparent conflicts of interest  include the following:

1. The interpreter  is a friend, associate, or relative of a party or an attorney  for a party
involved  in the proceeding;

{.

2. The interpreter  has served  in an investigative  capacity  for a party or attorney involved in
the proceeding;

3. The interpreter  has assisted  a law enforcement  agency in the preparation  of the
criminal  case at issue;

4. The interpreter or member  of the interpreter's family has a financial  interest  in the
case, or any other interest that could be affected  by the outcome  of the case;

5. The interpreter  has assisted  in a party's choice  of attorney  for the case.

(b) lnterpreters  shall disclose  to the court and any other parties  when they previously
have  been retained for private employment by a party or attorney in the case.

(c) lnterpreters  shall  not serve in any matter in which payment for their  services  is
contingent  upon  the outcome  of the case.

(d) Other than authorized  payment for court interpreter services, interpreters  shall not
accept money, favors or other consideration which  could be considered as an attempt to
influence the discharge  of their interpreter  duties.

(e) lnterpreters  shall not accept payment directly  from or on the behalf of a person for
whom  the interpreter  is being paid by the State to provide interpreting services.

(f) An interpreterwho  is also a licensed attorney shall not serve in both  capacities  in the
same legal matter.

(g) lnterpreters  shall notify the court of any personal  bias they may have in any aspect  of a
case.

(h) lnterpreters  shall preserve the confidentiality of any privileged or confidential
i nformation they  i nterpret.

(i) lnterpreters  shall not publicly discuss or comment  on a matter in which they are
providing interpreter service.  An interpreter shall  not allow  interviews with the media, or
otherwise  express  personal  opinions  regarding  a case.

U) lnterpreters  shall strive  for professional  detachment.  Verbal  or non-verbal displays of
personal  attitudes, prejudices,  emotions,  or opinions should be avoided  at all times. 

.#

(k) For the duration  of the proceedings, interpreters  shall neither  interact with
nor socialize with the parties, witnesses,  jurors, presiding officials  or friends or
relatives of one of these persons,  except when carrying  out their official
duties.

(l) lnterpreters  must also refrain from repeating  or disclosing information
obtained  by them in the course  of their employment  that may be relevant to
the legal proceeding.

(m) In the event that an interpreter becomes  aware of information  that
suggests imminent harm to someone  or relates  to a crime being committed
during the course  of the proceedings, the interpreter shall immediately
disclose the information  to an appropriate  authority within the judiciary who is
not involved  in the proceedings and seek advise in regard to the potential
conflict  in professional  responsibility.

(n) No court interpreter shall comment  or render an opinion  on the propriety
or impropriety of a verdict  in any matter  in which  he or she has served.

SECTION  5 - BEST PRACTICES  FOR  FOREIGN LANGUAGE  COURT  INTERPRETERS

Section  5.1 Effective  Preparation  for and Delivery  of lnterpreting Services

A. Pre-Hearing Activities

When possible,  the interpreter should meet with the NES individual and his or
her attorney  prior to the court proceedings. This will allow the interpreter  to
become familiar with the NES individual's  dialect  and manner  of speaking.
Also where  possible,  the interpreter should  determine  the type of case in
which  he or she will be providing interpreter services. This will allow the
interpreter  to identify  and study any specialized  terminology  that may be used
during the proceeding.

{j

B. Courtroom Protoco!

The judge or presiding  judicial official governs  the behavior  of the parties,
attorneys,  court employees,  and other persons in the courtroom. The
interpreter should  abide  by the instructions  and rules of this official at all
times. The following polices may also provide  the interpreter  with general
guidance:

Arrival: The interpreter should  arrive at least fifteen minutes prior to the start
of the proceedings  and notify the court  official.

Courtroom location: Unless the interpreter is using  sound equipment  that
allows interpretation  from any point in the courtroom,  the interpreter
interpreting  simultaneously  for an NES should be seated  with the party at the
counsel  table. When consecutively  interpreting  the testimony  of an NES
witness,  the interpreter should be close to the witness,  but in such a manner
that the judge, parties, attorneys and jurors  are able to view the witness. The
interpreter should interpret a witness's testimony  so that the judge, parties,
attorneys, jurors  and the court reporter are able to hear and understand  the
interpreter.  Still, the interpreter should be as unobtrusive as possible
throughout the proceedings.

Equal access:  The interpreter's purpose  is to place each NES individual in a
situation  equivalent  to that of any English-speaking  person. Accordingly, the
interpreter should interpret for each NES individual everything that an English
speaking person would hear.

Verbatim vs. complete  interpretation:  A verbatim  interpretation  is not
necessarily  a complete and accurate interpretation. Accordingly, an
interpreter should not provide a verbatim  interpretation  if the interpretation
would essentially rob the statement of its meaning.  This is particularly true for
idiomatic expressions. For example, a verbatim translation  of the phrase "we
kept tabs on him" may fail to convey the actual  meaning of the phrase to the
NES person.

{r

Problems with the interpretation:  lf the interpreter becomes concerned  about
his or her ability to interpret for a particular case or for a particular  person, or
if the interpreter becomes concerned  about a possible  conflict  of interest,  the
interpreter should notify the court immediately.  The interpreter should  also
inform the court of any material mistakes the interpreter realizes he or she has
made while interpreting.

Use of first and third person: lf it becomes necessary for the interpreter  to
address the court during the proceeding, the interpreter should  speak in third
person. For example, the interpreter should  say, "Your Honol The lnterpreter
was unable to hear counsel's question".

Howeve; the interpreter should  always render a witness' testimony  in first
person. For example, if a witness responds, "l saw the defendant around
10:00",  the interpreter should not interpret this as: "The witness  says she saw
the defendant around L0:00".

Observing these rules will allow the official court record to reflect clearly when
the interpreter is speaking  on his or her own behalf,  and when the interpreter
is rendering  the testimony  of a witness.

Departure: When the proceeding  concludes, the interpreter should not leave
the courtroom until the court  official  formally  excuses the interpreter.

SECflON  5 - BEST PRAgflCES FOR COURT  OFFICIAIS IN CASES INVOLVING
FOREIGN  I.ANGUAGE  I NTERPREfl  NG

Section  6.1 Coordination  of !nterpreter Services

Each presiding circuit judge may identify an individual to coordinate
interpreter services for the courts in that circuit.  (e.g., circuit clerk, assistant  or
deputy clerk of the court, judicial  assistant,  administrator; etc.)

{s

Section  5.2 Preparation  for and Delivery of lnterpreting Services

A. Pre-hearing Activities

The court may encourage the interpreter  to meet with NES individual prior to
the hearing  in order to become familiar with the person's dialect  and manner
of speech. The court  should  also encourage counsel to share with the
interpreter any documents  that the interpreter could be asked  to sight
translate during  the proceeding.

B. lnstructions

The court may introduce the interpreter and provide certain instructions to
the parties, the attorneys and the jury on the proper role of the interpreter.
Specifically, the court may want to provide  the following instructions:

1. The interpreter's role and purpose  is limited to facilitating  communication.
(The interpreter may not provide legal advise or assistance to any party).

2. Participants in the legal proceeding  should  speak directly to one another,
not to the interpreter. For example, an attorney should ask questions  to the
NES witness directly. The attorney should not ask questions by instructing the
interpreter: 'Ask the witness when she saw the defendant".  Likewise, the NES
witness  should respond  directly to the attorney  asking the question, not to the
interpreter.

3. The interpreter must render everything  that is said in the courtroom
completely and accurately. The interpreter  may not elaborate,  explain, clarify,
add to, or omit information  from the original statements.

4. The jury should not give any weight to the fact that a party or witness
requires the assistance of an interpreter;  and the jury should be so instructed.

{j

5. The court reporter records only the English spoken during the proceeding. ln the
verbatim  transcript of the proceeding,  the reporter should indicate when a witness or
party  is speaking through an interpreter.

The court may arrange  and docket cases requiring  interpreters  for efficient  case
management.  The court may appoint  one or more interpreters  to remain available  during
an entire  court docket.  (See section 3.7 Appointment  by Docket).

C. Calendar Efficiency

D. Courtroom  Environment

The court should attempt to ensure that all participants  speak  audibly and clearly, that all
participants  speak  at a reasonable  rate of speed, and that the participants  speak  only one
at a time.

Notepads  and Dictionaries: lnterpreters  should regularly use notepads  and bilingual
dictionaries  to assist them  in performing  their  duties.  The court should encourage
interpreters  to use these resources and may want to explain to the jury and the other
participants  why the interpreters  are using them.

lnterpreting  Equipment: lnterpreters  also may use wireless interpreting equipment  for
simultaneous  interpretation. The interpreter  speaks into a transmitter  and the
interpretation  is translated  to a receiver used bythe  NES individual.  The court may need
to explain to the jury or the other participants the nature of the equipment  and why the
interpreter  is using it.

Use of Audiotape  Back-Up: ln the more serious  cases, the court may want to order that
the proceedings  be recorded on audio  tape.  This will provide records of the original
statements  made  in the foreign  language. This may  assist in resolving  questions  that
could arise regarding  the adequacy  of the interpretation.

E. Team lnterpreting

For lengthy proceedings,  the court may appoint  a team of interpreters  to avoid fatigue
and loss of accuracy.  Team interpreting avoids  the necessity of calling for numerous
breaks  and moves  the case along at a more efficient pace.

{i

F. Oath

The court may want to use an oath similar to that set out in Section 3.5. lf an
interpreter provides  regular services  in a certain court, the court may want to
require  the interpreter to sign a written oath that the court keeps on file. ln all
cases, the record should reflect the interpreter's  oath and/or  the adequacy of
the interpreter's prior written oath.

G. Translated  Forms

Translating documents is not the same as interpreting.  However;  court officials
may want to ask the AOC for assistance when certain court forms  need to be
translated and made available.

SEgflON  7 - COMPENSATION  OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE  INTERPRETEN

Section  7.1 Payment for I nterpreter Services

A. lnvoice for Payment

lnterpreters  shall be paid at a rate and schedule established  by the ADC with
the advice and consent of the State Comptroller. lnterpreters  shall submit to
the State Comptroller the required request for payment for review and
approval  pursuant to Ala. Code (1975) 5 15-1-3.

B. Billable  Hours of Work

lnterpreters  shall be paid pursuant  to Ala. Code (1975) S 15-1-3.  lnterpreters
shall be paid for the time in court providing interpreter services  plus expenses

level of certification. (www.Alacou  rt.gov u nder lCON  "l NTERP RETE RS")

(s

Should a proceeding  requiring an appointed  interpreter be cancelled or
otherwise  continued  by the court, the court shall attempt  to provide the
interpreter at least 48 hours notice  of the cancellation.  Should  the court not
provide the interpreter  with such notice, the interpreter may submit to the
judge a claim for any associated  time at court, and for any related  expenses,
fees and travel.

C. Payment for Travel

An interpreter may be reimbursed  for travel  as allowed  for state employees.

D. Payment by Contr:act or Other Agreement

An interpreter may provide  court interpreter services  and be paid pursuant  to
contract or agreement  with the Administrative  Office of Courts and approval
by the State comptroller.  (see section  3.7 Appointment by Docket)

Section  7.2 Responsibility  for Payment

Foreign  language  interpreters  providing services  in criminal and juvenile
proceedings are paid by the state. However, the law does not prohibit  the
court from taxing the interpreter's  fees and expenses  as costs at the end of
the case to be paid by one or more  of the parties.

SEgflON  8 - CERTIFICATION  OF FOREIGN  LANGUAGE  INTERPREI'ERS

section  8.1 certification of Foreign Language  rnterpreters

Section 8.2 Certifi cation  Examination

The AOC will administer  court interpreter certification examinations developed in
accordance  with the test construction  standards  by the Consortium for State Court
lnterpreter  Certification.  The ADC may determine how often, at what locations,  and for
what languages  the AOC will administer  such examinations.  The  ADC may  also establish
rules and procedures  to determine persons eligible to take such examinations.

The  AOC will work with the Consortium for State Court lnterpreter Certification  to analyze
and verifythe test results and determine persons who have achieved  a passing  score.  ln
addition  to any practical skills examination  developed by the Consortium, the AOC may
also require applicants  to pass written examinations addressing general legal proficiency,
court-related  terms  and usage, ethics and professional  conduct. 

{,.

Section  8.3 Good Character and Fitness

Foreign  language  interpreters  are entrusted  by the court with a significant
degree of responsibility.  The good characterand  fitness of the applicant is
therefore  a crucial factor in determining  whether an applicant is eligible  for
certification. ln determining  whether an applicant has demonstrated good
character  and fitness, the AOC shall rely on information including  a criminal
background  of the applicant and recommendations  from individuals  who have
known and worked with the applicant. The determination  of whether a
person  has demonstrated good character  and fitness  sufficient to serve as a
certified interpreter rests with the AOC.

Section  8.4 Registry  of Certified lnterpreters

The AOC will list on its FLI Registry the interpreters who have registered,  and
interpreters  who have both registered and achieved one or more levels of
certification  as court interpreters.  The list will include the name,  telephone

SECTION  10 - UNIFORM  USE OF QUALIFIED  INTERPRETEN

10. 1 General  Proceedings

Each of the following may apply to court proceedings  in Alabama's  district,
circuit and juvenile courts  where  non-English  speaking parties or witnesses  are
in need of foreign language  interpreters.

(A) According to the law, an interpreter shall be appointed when the court,
after examination,  determines that: (1) the party cannot understand  and
speak  English  well enough to participate fully in the proceedings  a nd/or assist
counsel; and/or (2) the witness  cannot  speak  English  well enough to be
adequately  understood directly  by counsel, court, and the jury. When making
this examination,  the court should  examine  the party or witness  on the
record. The fact that a person for whom English is a second language  knows
some  English  should not prohibit  that individual  from being allowed  to have  an
interpreter.

(B) To determine  if an interpreter is needed, the court may include  questions
to the requesting  party or witness  addressing the following:

1. ldentification (for example:  name, address, birth date, age, place of birth);

{;

2. Active vocabulary  in vernacular English (for example: "How did you come to
the court today?', "What kind of work.do you do?", "Where did you go to
school?", "What was the highest grade  you completed?", "Describe what you
see in the courtroom",  "What have you eaten today?". Questions should be
phrased  to avoid "yes or no" replies; and

3. The court proceedings  (for example: the nature of the charge  or the type of
case before the court, the purpose  of the proceedings and function of the
court, the rights of a party or criminal defendant, and the responsibilities  of a
witness).

(C) After examination,  the court  should  state its conclusion  on the record;  and
the court file should be clearly  marked with data entered to ensure that  a
qualified  interpreter  will be provided by the court  at subsequent  hearings
when needed.

(D) For good cause,  the court may authorize a pre-appearance  interview
between  the interpreter and the party or witness.  Good cause may exist when
the interpreter  needs clarification on any interpreting issues,  including but not
limited to: colloquialisms,  culturalisms,  dialects,  idioms,  linguistic  capabilities
and traits, regionalisms,  register,  slang, speech patterns,  or technicalterms.

(E) When a certified interpreter has not been appointed, the court  should  give
instructions to the otherwise  qualified  interpreteL  either  orally or in writing,
that substantially  conform to the following:

1. Do not discuss  the pending proceedings with a party or witness,  outside of
professional  employment  in the same case.

2.Do not disclose  communications between counsel and client.

3. Do not attempt to give legal advice to a party or witness. Refer  legal
questions  to the attorney  or to the court.

{s

4. lnform the court if you are unable to interpret a word, expression, special
terminology, or dialect,  or have doubts about your linguistic  expertise  or ability
to perform  adequately in a particular case.

5. lnterpret all words, including  slang, vulgarisms, and epithets, to convey the
intended  meaning.

6. Use first and third person: lf it becomes necessary for the interpreter  to
address the court during the proceeding,  the interpreter  should  speak  in the
third person. For example,  the interpreter should  say, "Your Hono; The
lnterpreter was unable to hear counsel's  question".

However, the interpreter should  always render a witness' testimony  in first
person.  For example, if a witness responds, "l saw the defendant around
L0:00," the interpreter should not interpret this as: "The witness  says she saw
the defendant around 10:00". Observing  these rules will allow the official
court record to reflect clearly when the interpreter  is speaking  on his or her
own behall and when the interpreter is rendering  the testimony of a witness.

7. Direct all inquiries or problems  to the court and not to the witness  or
counsel. lf necessary,  you may request  permission  to approach the bench  with
counsel to discuss a problem.

8. Position  yourself near the witness  or party without blocking the view of the
judge, jury, or counsel.

9. lnform the court  should you become fatigued during the court proceedings.

10. When interpreting  for a party  at counsel table, speak loudly enough to be
heard  by the party or counsel but not so loudly  as to interfere with the
proceedings.

11. lnterpret everything including  objections.

{s

12. lf the court finds good cause,  you may hold a pre-appearance  interview
with the party or witness  to become familiar with speech patterns and
linguistic traits and to determine  whattechnical  orspecialterms may be used.
Counsel  may be present  at the pre-appearance  interview.

13. During  the pre-appearance  interview with a non-English speaking  witness,
give the witness  the following instructions  on the procedure  to be followed
when the witness is testifying:

(a) The witness must speak in a loud, clear voice so that the entire court  and
not just the interpreter can hear.

(b) The witness must direct all responses to the person asking the question,
not to the interpreter.

(c) The witness must direct all questions  to counsel or to the court  and not to
the interpreter. The witness may not seek advice from or engage in any
discussion  with the interpreter.

(d) During  the pre-appearance  interview with a non-English speaking party,
give the following instructions on the procedure  to be used when the non-
English  speaking party is not testifying:  (i)The interpreter  will interpret all
statements made in open  court.  (ii) The party must direct any questions  to
counsel.  The interpreter  will interpret all questions  to counsel and the
responses. The party may not seek advice from or engage in discussion  with
the interpreter.

(F)The  court  or the court's designee should give the following instructions to
counsel, either orally or in writing:

1. When examining a non-English speaking  witness,  direct all questions  to the
witness  and not to the interpreter.  (For example, do not say to the interprete6
"Ask him if . . !');

{.

2. lf there is a disagreement  with the interpretation, direct any objection to
the court  and not to the interpreter. Ask permission  to approach the bench to
discuss  the problem;

3. lf you have a question regarding the qualifications of the interpreter, you
may request  permission to conduct a supplemental examination regarding the
i nterpreter's  q ua I ifications.

LO.z Crimina I Proceedings

(A) Each non-English speaking  defendant or witness  should be provided  with a
qualified  interpreter at each step of the proceedings.  Within the judge's
discretion,  the interpreter's costs may be assessed  upon a defendant  when
appropriate.

(B) A non-English speaking person may waive  the right to a qualified
interpreter.  Howeve;  such a waiver must be in writing and approved  by the
court. The court should determine  on the record that the right to a qualified
interpreter has been waived knowingly  and voluntarily, utilizing  the services of
the most available  qualified  interpreter. Additionally, counsel may waive the
presence  of a qualified  interpreter in bond hearings.

(C) The court should provide a qualified  interpreter  to any non-English
speaking person  whenever the non-English speaking person is a party, or has
been subpoenaed,  or summoned or has otherwise  been compelled  to appear
in a court proceeding.  Within the judge's  discretion, costs can be assessed
upon  a defendant when appropriate.

10.3 Civil Proceedings

(A) Upon request,  each non-English speaking person should be provided  a
copy of the Foreign Language lnterpreter Registry maintained by the AOC.

{j

(B) Each non-English speaking party has the right to a qualified foreign
language  interpreter at the expense  of the non-English speaking person.
Notice of use of an interpreter must be provided  to the court  and to all
parties.  See Rule 43(f) ARCP.

(C) Should  the court  consider  and approve a pauper's  affidavit  in any civil case,
the person filing the affidavit and requiring a foreign  language  interpreter
should be provided a qualified  interpreter.

LO.4 Juvenile  Proceedings

(A) Each non-English speaking person in a delinquency proceeding  or whose
parental  rights to full custody  of any minor child  are challenged  by any
governmental  unit or agency, must be provided a qualified foreign language
interpreter at each step of the proceedings.

(B) The court must provide  a qualified foreign language  interpreter to any non-
English  speaking person whenever such person's rights to full custody  of any
minor child  are challenged due to dependency, delinquency or neglect.

(C) The qualified foreign language  interpreter must be available  when legal
counsel is not able to effectively  communicate  with the non-English speaking
party.

(D) A non-English speaking person  may waive the right to the use of a qualified
foreign language  interpreter. Such  a waiver should be in writing and approved
by the court. The court  shall determine,  on the record, that the right to such
an interpreter  has been waived knowingly  and voluntarily utilizing  the services
of the most available  qualified  interpreter.  ln no event  shall the failure to
request  a foreign language  interpreter  be deemed  to be a waiver.

10.5 Replacement of interpreter

The court  should  determine  whether the interpreter is able to accurately

{s

communicate  with the non-English  speaking person.  lf it is determined  that the
interpreter cannot adequately communicate  with the non-English  speaking person, the
court must terminate the services of the current interprete[  and appoint  a separate
q ua  I ified  i nterpreter.

10.6 lnterpretert  fees  and expenses

Qualified foreign  language interpreters'fees  and costs in any criminal  or juvenile
proceeding are established  by the ADC  pursuant  Ala.  Code (1975)  515-L-3.  An
interpreter's fees  and costs may be assessed by the court as costs at the end of such
proceeding.

SECflON  11- ETHICALSTANDARDS FOR INTERPRETERS

lnterpreters  have  an obligation  to maintain the integrity of Alabama's  Unified  Judicial
System.  With the court's  knowledge and approval, interpreters  may refer a particular  case
to another interpreter  as a result of technical  difficulties,  cultural biases or personal
interests. Also, while interpreters  are allowed to advertise, all statements as to the
interpreter's qualifications  must be truthful.  lnterpreters  may not guarantee  a specific
result, and an interpreter's statements  must be accurate,  clea6  truthful, and not
misleading.

lnterpreters must  abide by the Foreign Language  lnterpreters' Code of Professional
Responsibility.

requesting  assistance.  The interpreter  shall  also interpret testimony or
statements  of the defendant,  juvenile, complainant, petitioneq  or witness,
and, where applicable,  assist in communications  with counsel.

(4) lf the court has reason to believe  that the defendant,  juvenile,

speaking  and understanding  the English language, the court may require  that
the requestor provide reasonable proof to the court of his or her inability to
speak or understand  the English language.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
