(4) . After the calculation i. s made in accordance with (2) or (3) above (whichever is applicable) , the amount of the garnishment for the week is the LESSE. R amount. . Withho. ld this amount and pay it into Court as instructed in the ﬁWrit of Garnishmentﬂ on the front of this form. . (5) . THE . CLERK AND OTHER COURT PERSONNEL CANNOT GIVE YOU LEGAL ADVICE.

EXEMPTION FROM. GARNISHMENT. A process. of garnishment. has been. delivered. to you. . This means. that a Court. may. order. your. wages, . money. in a bank, . sums. owned to. you, . or other. property. belonging to you, to be paid into Court to satisfy. a judgment against. you. Laws of the State of Alabama and of the United States provide that in some circumstances. certain money and property may not be taken to pay certain types of court judgments, because certain money or property may be ﬁexemptﬂ from garnishment. For example, under tate law, in some circumstances, up to $7, 500. 00 in personal property, including money, . bank accounts, automobiles, appliances, etc. may be exempt from process of garnishment. . Similarly, under ederal law, certain benefits and certain welfare payments may be exempt from garnishment. Benefits and payments ordinarily exempt from garnishment include, for example, ocial ecurity payments. SSI payments, veteran™s benefits, (welfare) payments, unemployment compensation payments and workers compensation payments. . THESE EXAMPLES ARE FOR PURPOSES OF ILLUSTRATION ONLY. WHETHER YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO CLA. IM ANY EXEMPTION FROM THE PROCESS OF GARNISHMENT, AND, IF SO, WHAT PROPERTY MAY BE EXEMPT, WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE FACTS IN YOUR PARTICULAR CASE. IF YOU ARE UNCERTAIN AS TO YOUR POSSIBLE EXEMPTION RIGHTS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT A LAWYER FOR ADVICE. TO CLAIM ANY EXEMPTION THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO YOU, YOU MUST PREPARE A ﬁCLAIM OF EXEMPTIONﬂ FORM LISTING ON IT ALL YOUR WAGES AND PERSONAL PROPERTY; HAVE THE CLAIM OF EXEMPTION NOTARIZED; AND FILE IT IN THE CLERK™S OFFICE. ALSO, IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAIL OR DELIVER A CO. PY OF THE CLAIM EXEMPTION TO THE PLAINTIFF WHO HAS A JUDGMENT AGAINST YOU. YOU MUST INDICATE ON THE CLAIM OF EXEMPTION THAT YOU FILED IN THE CLERK™S OFFICE WHETHER YOU MAILED OR DELIVERED THE COPY TO THE PLAINTIFF AND THE DATE ON WHICH YOU MAILED OR DELIVERED IT. THE CLERK CANNOT GIVE YOU LEGAL ADVICE. IF YOU NEED ASSISTANCE, YOU SHOULD SEE A LAWYER. If you file a claim of exemption, the plaintiff will have approximately ten (10) days to file a ﬁcontestﬂ of your claim of exemption. If a contest is filed, a Court hearing will be scheduled and you will be notified of the time and place of the hearing. If the plaintiff does not file a contest, the property claimed by you as exempt will be released from the garnishment. If you do not file a claim of exemption, your property may be turned over to the ourt and to the plaintiff on the judgment against you. TO PROT. ECT YOUR RIGHTS, . IT IS. IMPORTANT THAT YOU. ACT PROMPTLY. . IF. YOU. HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, YOU. SHOULD. CONSULT A. LAWYER. NOTICE TO PLAINTIFF OF RIGHT TO CONTEST CLAIM OF EXEMPTION OF DEFENDANT If a ﬁClaim of Exemptionﬂ is filed in the Clerk™s office and mailed or delivered. to you by the defendant, you have approximately ten (10) days to file a ﬁContestﬂ to the Claim of Exemption with the Clerk of the Court. If a Contest is timely filed, a Court hearing will be scheduled within seven (7) calendar days. (or on the next business day thereafter if the Court is not open on the seventh day) . You and the defendant will be notified of the time and place of the hearing. If you fail to make timely Contest of the Claim of Exemption, after fifteen (15) calendar days from the filing of suc. h claim by the defendant, the Process of Garnishment and any writ of garnishment issued therein shall be dismissed or, where appropriate, modified to the extent necessary to give effect to the claimed. exemptions. . IF YOU ARE UNCERTAIN AS TO HOW TO FILE A CONTEST TO THE CLAIM OF EXEMPTION, YOU SHOULD CONSULT A LAWYER FOR ADVICE. THE CLERK AND OTHER COURT PERSONNEL CANNOT GIVE YOU LEGAL ADVICE. </div>
