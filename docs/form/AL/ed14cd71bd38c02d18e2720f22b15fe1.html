      <pre>OVERVIEW OF THE WRITTEN EXAMINATION
FOR REGISTERED INTERPRETERS

This overview is adapted from an original text prepared by the Consortium

for State Court Interpreter Certification. The written examination is a product of
the Consortium, and the Alabama Administrative Office of Courts administers the
written examination in a manner consistent with the Consortium’s guidelines.

Introduction

This document has been prepared to help persons aspiring to become

certified court interpreters understand what the written test measures, how it is
administered, and how to prepare for taking the exam. Each examinee should
study this overview thoroughly in order to be more fully prepared for the written
exam.

The written examination is only one part of the process for becoming a

certified or approved court interpreter. Passing this test does not mean a person
has become a “certified” court interpreter; rather, it means that the examinee
has met one of several requirements for certification.

The written test measures candidates’ knowledge of three areas central to

the work of a court interpreter at the level of a minimally qualified court
interpreter:

1. English Language. To function as a professional court interpreter, a

candidate must possess a high degree of proficiency in the English language.
Accordingly, the written examination assumes a high degree of literacy in the
English language and familiarity with a range of language constructions. It tests
comprehension of written English vocabulary and idioms.

2. Court-Related Terms and Usage. A successful candidate must also

be familiar with the terminology and procedures of the court system.
Accordingly, the written examination also measures recognition of common
court-related situations and vocabulary, especially in the area of criminal
procedure.

3. Ethics and Professional Conduct. The third area of knowledge
required of professional court interpreters is general knowledge of standards
guiding the performance of duties. Accordingly, the written exam includes
questions aimed at measuring candidates’ knowledge of ethical behavior and
professional conduct.

What does the test look like?

The examination contains 135 multiple-choice questions. Each question

has four choices, labeled A, B, C, and D. The candidate is instructed to select the
best choice and mark that choice on the answer sheet.

The test has two parts:

Part I: General Language Proficiency, and

Part II: Court-Related Terms & Usage, and Ethics & Professional
Conduct.

Within each part there are several sections, each of which contains a

particular category of questions. There are specific instructions for how to
proceed at the beginning of each section. A complete list of the sections,
including one or more sample questions for each, is provided in Appendix A.

How will the test be scheduled and what do I need to know
about the test in advance?

To be included on our mailing list, you must first register with the
Alabama Administrative Office of Courts. This registration form is on this
website, or you request this form by calling or writing to the Administrative
Office of Courts:

Alabama Foreign Language Interpreter Program 
Attention: Legal Division
300 Dexter Avenue
Montgomery, Alabama  36104
(334) 954-5014

Once you are on our mailing list, you will be notified when and where 

the test will be administered. You must complete and return the enclosed 
registration form by the due date in order to be permitted to take the test.

Arrive early. No one will be admitted after the test begins. Only small 
purses or wallets are allowed in the testing room. Leave everything else at home 
or in your car. Do not try to bring briefcases, palm pilots, dictionaries, gym bags, 
cell phones, calculators, paper, pens, pencils, or any other similar items into the 
test room, as you will not be admitted to the test room with them. Pencils will be 
provided in the test room.

There will be a registration area where you will sign in. You will need a
picture identification to verify your identity. In the testing room, there will be a
test administration supervisor, and there may be another test proctor present to
assist.

Also, use the restroom prior to entering the testing room. If you ask to
leave the testing room after the test has begun, you will be instructed to leave
all of your test materials with the test administration supervisor prior to leaving
the room. You may be escorted to the restroom to ensure that you do not use a
telephone or converse with other individuals while you are outside of the testing
room. No more than one candidate will be allowed to leave the testing room at
a time. No adjustments to the time allotted for completion of the exam will be
made for any time you are outside of the testing room.

What if I need special accommodation due to a disability?

If you have a disability recognized by the Americans with Disabilities Act

(ADA), you must request special accommodation in advance. In order to do that,
you should complete the attached Request for Special Accommodation and
submit it to Human Resources Division of the Alabama Administrative Office of
Courts as far ahead of the test date as possible. You must describe your
disability and describe the type or kind of accommodation you are requesting. In
addition, you must submit a statement from an appropriate professional
documenting the diagnosis or evaluation of your disability.

How will the test be administered?

The test will be given in a conference room to a number of candidates at

the same time. Seating will be assigned. Depending upon the seating
arrangements, some candidates may be asked to move from one seat and
occupy another. If this happens, it is for test security measures and the
candidates should not be troubled or concerned.

Security of the test materials is essential. Examinees may not take notes
or copy any portion of the exam. If an examinee is disruptive, attempts to copy
questions, or retain or record test materials, the examinee may be expelled from
the testing room and advised that his or her examination will not be scored.
Documentation of the expulsion and the reasons for it will be maintained by the
State.

Once all examinees are seated for the exam, the test administrator will
hand out materials packets and two pencils to each person. He or she will read
scripted instructions to the examinees in order to ensure that all candidates

receive the same instructions each time the examination is given. Then the
examinees will be directed to read and execute an Agreement and Oath Form.
Next, examinees will prepare their answer sheets by entering their name and the
last four digits of their social security number, the test date, and the test site.

Examinees must listen to the instructions carefully and must not begin the

examination until the test administration supervisor says, “You may begin.”
Candidates are allowed two hours and fifteen minutes to complete the
examination. A clock will be provided in each testing room to assist candidates
who do not bring their own timepiece. Fifteen minutes before the end of the
test, the test administrator will make the following announcement out loud: “You
have fifteen minutes remaining.” At the beginning of each section there are
instructions on how to answer the questions in that section. As examinees work
their way through the test, they should carefully read the instructions for each
section to be sure they understand how to answer that section’s questions. The
types of instructions you will find will be to select the answer that:

o
o
o
o
o

is closest in meaning;
most appropriately completes a sentence;
best answers a question or provides the best solution to a situation;
has the correct sequence of events; or
is opposite in meaning.

See Appendix A for sample questions from the various sections of the exam.

What is the score required for passing and how will I be
notified about the results?

In order to pass the test, 80 percent of the items must be answered

correctly. That means the examinee must answer at least 108 of the 135 items
correctly in order to pass. The examinees will be notified in writing of the results
of their tests. Remember, passing this test is the first step towards becoming
“certified” court interpreter.

What can I do to prepare for the test?

A list of possible activities and resources has been compiled to help you

identify actions you can take to help prepare for the exam. Some of the
resources may help you decide whether you are ready to participate in a test of
this nature. The list is attached and marked as Appendix B.

What if I do not pass the examination?

This written examination is constructed to measure entry-level knowledge of
each of the following:

English general vocabulary
common words and phrases likely to be heard in court
the typical progression of cases through the court system, and
provisions of a code of professional responsibility that a minimally
competent person entering the court interpreting field would need.

If you do not pass the exam, it is suggested that you resist the temptation

to simply register to retake the exam. Experience shows that retaking an
examination of this kind within a short time period will not substantially change
the results. Instead, you are encouraged to review the section of this Overview
entitled “What can I do to prepare for the test?” and Appendix B, and
engage in some reading and preparatory study before retaking the examination.

Appendix B

PREPARING FOR THE TEST

If you are not familiar with taking written, multiple-choice tests, you may find it
beneficial to:

1. Review instructions and suggestions on taking multiple-choice tests such as:

a. “General Strategies for Taking Written Examinations” (available at
www.cps.ca.gov/spb/2GenSTratWrit.asp).

b. “Information about the Written Examination,” Federal Court Interpreter
Certification Examination (www.cps.ca.gov/fcice-spanish/eh3.htm).

2. Study preparation material developed for similar exams, or even take the exams.

a. TOEFL: TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) Sample Test
(www.ets.org). There are many other publications available as well.

b. California Administrative Hearing Interpreter (www.cps.ca.gov/spb/).

c. California Medical Interpreter (www.cps.ca.gov/spb/).
With respect to Part I, General Language Proficiency, one needs to have a very broad
command of the English language. That is not something that is quickly or easily
acquired. However, some of the following activities might be helpful in expanding one’s
knowledge of the English language and preparing for the test:

1. Take upper-level English courses at a college or university.

2. Read widely such items as books and professional journals in many fields, American
literature, and editorials and articles in major newspapers.

3. Brush up on English vocabulary and lexical concepts (go back to the basics and
review antonyms, synonyms, and idioms).

4. Review sample tests from other interpreter certification programs:

a. California: Request the “practice written examination” which is available for
$15.00 (payable by money order or cashier’s check) from CPS-Human Resource
Services, Interpreter Division, 241 Lathrop Way, Sacramento, CA 95815.

b. Administrative Office of the United States Courts: For a description of the
written portion of the Federal Court Interpreter Certification Examination
(FCICE), go to www.cps.ca.gov/fcice-spanish/eh3.htm. The sample test is at
www.cps.ca.gov/test_registration/FCICE-Spanish/files/spwtest.pdf.

5. Consult other resources, such as:

a. The Idiom Connection, available online at:
www.geocities.com/Athens/Aegean/6720.

b. The ESL Idiom Page, (Dennis Oliver), available online at:
www.eslcafe.com/idioms.

c. The Synonyms Page, available online at:
www.manatee.k12.fl.us/sites/elementary/palmasola/synonyms.htm.

d. SAT and GRE workbooks.

e. Vocabulary-building books found in the reference section of libraries and
bookstores.

With respect to Part II, Court-Related Terms & Usage, and Ethics & Professional
Conduct, the following activities would be helpful in expanding or acquiring the
substantive knowledge pertinent to these fields:

Court-Related Terms & Usage

1. Read news items related to legal matters, law enforcement, and the courts in major
newspapers, consulting a dictionary to look up unfamiliar words.

2. Visit courthouses and observe court proceedings in civil, criminal, and family matters.

3. Take college/university courses in criminal justice and court administration.

4. Read any standard introductory textbook on the criminal justice system.

5. Read publications about the administration of justice such as the following documents
issued by the American Bar Association (www.abanet.org/abastore), which are available
for $2.50 each:

a. Law & the Courts, Volume I, The Role of the Courts, 2000.
b. Law & the Courts, Volume II, Court Procedures, 1998.
c. Law & the Courts, Volume III, Juries, 2001.

6. Study legal terms from the following sources:

a. Black’s Law Dictionary

b. Glossary of Commonly Used Court & Justice System Terminology (a publication of
the Consortium that is available at:
http://www.ncsconline.org/wc/publications/Res_CtInte_EnglishLegalGlossaryPub.pdf

Ethics & Professional Conduct

1. Become familiar Alabama’s Code of Professional Responsibility for Court Interpreters
and its Rules of Court pertaining to court interpreting.

2. Study the model code of professional responsibility, which is available at
http://www.ncsconline.org/wc/publications/Res_CtInte_ModelGuideChapter9Pub.pdf.

3. Join and participate actively in a professional association such as the National
Association of Judicial Interpreters and Translators (www.najit.org) or the American
Translators Association (www.atanet.org), studying their respective codes of ethics.

4. Read at least one of the classic texts in the field:

a. Berk-Seligson, Susan (1990). The Bilingual Courtroom: Court Interpreters in
the Judicial Process. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.

b. De Jongh, E.M. (1992). An Introduction to Court Interpreting: Theory and
Practice. Lanham, MD: University Press of America.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
