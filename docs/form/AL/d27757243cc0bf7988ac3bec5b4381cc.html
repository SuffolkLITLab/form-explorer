Additional Information:

________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Please be advised that where the law places limitations on the number of expungements, one expungement 

shall include all charges and convictions stemming from the same arrest or incident.  If the Court does not 

determine the Petitioner to be indigent and does not waive the $500.00 filing fee, when the Petitioner is 

seeking the expungement of multiple charges arising from one arrest, only one filing fee shall be paid. 

When the Petitioner is seeking the expungement of multiple charges arising from multiple arrests, a filing 

fee for each arrest shall be paid.

Records related to offenses and convictions may be disclosed to a criminal justice agency, a district 

attorney, or a prosecuting authority for criminal investigation purposes,  to a utility and its agents and 

affiliates, to the Department of Human Resources for the purpose of investigation or assessment in order to 

protect children or vulnerable adults, or to any entities or services providing information to banking, 

insurance, and other financial institutions as required for various requirements as provided in state and 

federal law.

Further, any criminal charges that are expunged or are pending expungement shall be available for use by 
any attorneys, officers of the Court, or the Court itself in any civil matters related to the criminal charges 
expunged or seeking to be expunged regardless of the outcome of the petitioned expungement. At the 
conclusion of the pending civil matter, all references to the criminal charges expunged or to be expunged 
shall be redacted in the event the criminal charges are expunged.

(Section 15-27-1 et seq., Ala. Code 1975) 

Court Case Number 

• The  Petitioner  must  fully  complete  the  entire  title  section

(above the solid black line) of the Petition.

• The first line refers to the circuit court of the county in which
the  Petition  is  to  be  filed—the  Petition  must  be  filed  in  the
county where the Petitioner was charged with the offense.  For
example: A municipal ordinance violation filed in Huntsville,
AL would be properly filed in the Circuit Court of Madison
County.

• The Petitioner’s name on the second line must match the title
of the underlying case—the case the Petitioner is petitioning
to have expunged.

PAGE 6 

• The  “Petitioner”  section  must  be  completed  with  the 

Petitioner’s name and CURRENT contact information.

• The  Petitioner  must  list  the  full  court  case  number  of  the 
underlying case—the case the Petitioner is petitioning to have 
expunged.  There may be more than one charge on any given 
case number, but each petition must be limited  to one charge. 
If the Petitioner seeks to have each charge expunged, the 
Petitioner must fill out a separate petition for each charge. 
Likewise,  a  separate  petition  must  be  filled  out  for  each 
qualifying conviction.

• Bottom Half of Page 1 through page 4

Sections  I  through  Section  V  provide  qualifying  questions 
about  the  underlying  case.  Cases  eligible  for  expungement 
must satisfy the options provided by each Section. 

apply and, if possible, why they do not apply.  The Petitioner 
must  include  an  address  for  each  agency,  department,  etc. 
listed.  Additional pages may be attached if necessary. 

• The final paragraph of page 5 relates to the disposition of the
underlying  case.    Any  and  all  conditions  of  the  court  of
disposition  must  be  satisfied  in  order  for  the  charge  to  be
eligible for expungement.  This includes ANY and ALL fines
fees or other payments to the court.

• Page 6 is an averment under oath that the entire Petition is
true  and  correct  and  that  the  Petitioner  is  eligible  for
expungement,  and  includes  information  from  the  Petitioner
about other expungement petitions.  Intentionally giving false
information to the Court may carry penalties.

• All  previous  petitions  for  expungement  must  be  disclosed.

Additional pages may be attached, if necessary.

• The  Petitioner  must  sign  this  document  under  oath  and  the
signature  must  be  verified  by  an  official  authorized  to
administer oaths or a notary public.

• At the bottom of page 6 is a section for information about the
Petitioner’s  attorney  and for  the  attorney’s  signature.  If  the
Petitioner  IS  represented  by  an  attorney,  the  attorney  must
sign where indicated.  If the Petitioner IS NOT represented
by  an  attorney,  the  box  next  to  “pro  se”  must  be  checked
under the Petitioner’s signature.

• The  first  paragraph  on  page  5  refers  to  attachments  to  the
Petition.  Section 15-27-3(b) Ala. Code (1975) requires, as a
minimum,  that  petitioners  include  BOTH  a  certified  record
relating  to  the  charge  from  the  local  entity  (either  law
enforcement or court) AND a certified criminal record from
the  state  agency  -  the  Alabama  Law  Enforcement  Agency
(ALEA).  Accordingly, this Petition will be processed even if
only  the  minimum  information  required  under  the  statute  is
supplied.  HOWEVER,  the  expungement  order  may  be
incomplete  if  the  Court  and  the  Alabama  Law  Enforcement
Agency  are not  made  aware of  the  location of  ALL  records
therefore,
relating 
recommended that the Petitioner attach to the Petition certified 
copies of arrest, booking, or incarceration records from ALL
law  enforcement  agencies  (city,  county,  and  state),  and
certified copies of case action summaries or dispositions from
ALL  court  clerks  (municipal,  district,  and  circuit)  who  may
hold records of any kind relating to the underlying case.

• The second paragraph on page 5 corresponds to a section of
the  statute  which  requires  that  petitioners  specify  the  listed
items.  A response is required as to each point.  If any of the
items do not apply, the Petitioner must specify that they do not

• Section 15-27-3(b) Ala. Code (1975) requires the Petitioner
to serve the “district attorney, the law enforcement agency,
and clerk of court of the jurisdiction for which the records are
sought  to  be  expunged.”  The  Petitioner  is  responsible  for
providing  the  Court  and  ultimately  the  Alabama  Law
Enforcement  Agency  with  all  the  information  necessary  to
contact every court, law enforcement agency or other entity
in  possession  of  records  the  Petitioner  seeks  to  have
expunged.

• The  Petitioner  must  certify  to  the  Court  that  each  of  the
courts, agencies, or other entities holding records relating to
the  underlying  case  has  been  served.    Page  7  contains  the
certification  form  for  the  courts,  agencies,  or  other  entities
served  with  this  Petition  and  their  addresses.    Additional
pages may be attached if necessary.

• NOTE:  Any  information  (including  mailing  addresses)
provided regarding courts, agencies, or other entities holding
records  relating  to  the  underlying  case  will  expedite  the
execution of an expungement order if one is entered.  Without
such information, it may not be possible to locate records.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
