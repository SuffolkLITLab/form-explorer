      <pre>INCOME WITHHOLDING FOR SUPPORT - Instructions 
 

   

The Income Withholding for Support (IWO) is the OMB-approved form used for income withholding in: 
 

•
•
•

Tribal, intrastate, and interstate cases enforced under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act
 
All child support orders initially issued in the state on or after January 1, 1994
 
All child support orders initially issued (or modified) in the state before January 1, 1994, if
 
 
arrearages occur

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

This form is the standard format prescribed by the Secretary in accordance with section 466(b)(6)(a)(ii) of 
 
the Social Security Act.  Except as noted, the following information is required and must be 
 
 
included. 

 

 

 

 

 

  
Please note: 

•
For the purpose of this IWO form and these instructions, “state” is defined as a state or territory.
• Dos and don’ts on using this form are found at www.acf.hhs.gov/css/resource/using-the-income-
 

 

 

withholding-for-support-form-dos-and-donts.

I. Sender Information: (Completed by the Sender) Check one box for fields 1a – 1d.

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
1a.  Income Withholding Order/Notice for Support (IWO). Check the box if this is an initial IWO. 

   

  

 

 

 

 

  

1b.  Amended IWO. Check the box to indicate that this form amends a previous IWO. Any changes to an 
IWO must be done through an amended IWO. 

   

 

 

  

1c.  One-Time Order/Notice For Lump Sum Payment. Check the box when this IWO is to attach a one-
time collection of a lump sum payment after receiving notification from an employer/income withholder or 
 
other source. When this box is checked, enter the amount in field 14, Lump Sum Payment, in the Amounts 
to Withhold section. Additional IWOs must be issued to collect subsequent lump sum payments.
  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 
 

 

1d.  Termination of IWO.  Check the box to stop income withholding on a child support order. Complete 
 
all applicable identifying information to aid the employer/income withholder in terminating the correct IWO. 
 
1e.  Date.  Date this form is completed and/or signed. 

  

  

  

 

 

 

 
1f.  Child Support Enforcement (CSE) Agency, Court, Attorney, Private Individual/Entity (Check 
 
one box). Check the appropriate box to indicate which entity is sending the IWO. If this IWO is not 
 
completed by a state or tribal CSE agency, the sender should contact the CSE agency (see 
www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/css/resource/state-income-withholding-contacts-and-program-requirements) 
 
to determine if the CSE agency needs a copy of this form to facilitate payment processing. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

NOTE TO EMPLOYER/INCOME WITHHOLDER: This IWO must be regular on its face. The IWO must be 
rejected and returned to sender under the following circumstances: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

•

•
•
•
•

IWO instructs the employer/income withholder to send a payment to an entity other than a state
disbursement unit (for example, payable to the custodial party, court, or attorney). Each state is
required to operate a state disbursement unit (SDU), which is a centralized facility for collection and
 
disbursement of child support payments. Exception: If this IWO is issued by a court, attorney, or
private individual/entity and the initial child support order was entered before January 1, 1994, or the
 
order was issued by a tribal CSE agency, the employer/income withholder must follow the payment
 
 
instructions on the form.
Form does not contain all information necessary for the employer to comply with the withholding.
 
Form is altered or contains invalid information.
 
Amount to withhold is not a dollar amount.
Sender has not used the OMB-approved form for the IWO.
A copy of the underlying order is required and not included. If you receive this document from an
attorney or private individual/entity, a copy of the underlying support order containing a provision
authorizing income withholding must be attached.

NOTE TO EMPLOYER/INCOME WITHHOLDER: The employer/income withholder may not withhold 
 
more than the lesser of: 1) the amounts allowed by the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act [15 USC 
 
 
§1673(b)]; or 2) the amounts allowed by the jurisdiction of the employee/obligor’s principal place of
employment (i.e., the amounts allowed by state law if the employee/obligor’s principal place of
 
employment is in a state; or the amounts allowed by tribal law if the employee/obligor’s principal place of
employment is under tribal jurisdiction).

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

If permitted by the state or tribe, you may deduct a fee for administrative costs. The combined support 
 
amount and fee may not exceed the limit on the IWO. 
 

 

 

 

 

State-specific withholding limitations, time requirements, and any allowable employer fees are available at 
 
www.acf.hhs.gov/css/resource/state-income-withholding-contacts-and-program-requirements. For tribe-
 
specific contacts, payment addresses, and withholding limitations, please contact the tribe at 
 
www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/programs/css/tribal_agency_contacts_printable_pdf.pdf or 
https://www.bia.gov/tribalmap/DataDotGovSamples/tld_map.html. 

 

 

 

Depending on applicable state or tribal law, you may need to consider amounts paid for health care 
 
premiums to determine disposable income and apply appropriate withholding limits. 

 

 

 

 

A federal government agency may withhold from a variety of incomes and forms of payment, including 
voluntary separation incentive payments (buy-out payments), incentive pay, and cash awards. For a more 
 
complete list, see 5 CFR 581.103. 

 

 

 

 

21. State/Tribe. Name of the state or tribe sending this document.

Code (field 24) that is different than the Sender’s SDU (see OCSE’s AT-17-07: Interstate Child Support 
 
Payment Processing, https://www.acf.hhs.gov/css/resource/interstate-child-support-payment-processing). 
 
The Remittance ID in field 1h must correspond with the SDU identified in field 22.

Institute of Standards and Technology. These were formerly known as Federal Information Processing
Standards (FIPS) codes.

 

 

 

 

 

 

25. Return to Sender Checkbox. The employer/income withholder should check this box and return the
IWO to the sender if this IWO is not payable to an SDU or Tribal Payee or this IWO is not regular on its
face as indicated on page 1 of these instructions.

State-specific withholding limit information is available at www.acf.hhs.gov/css/resource/state-income-withholding-
contacts-and-program-requirements. For tribe-specific contacts, payment addresses, and withholding limitations, please 
contact the tribe at www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/programs/css/tribal_agency_contacts_printable_pdf.pdf or 
www.bia.gov/tribalmap/DataDotGovSamples/tld_map.html.

 

 

 

 

You may not withhold more than the lesser of: 1) the amounts allowed by the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act 
(CCPA) [15 USC §1673 (b)]; or 2) the amounts allowed by the law of the state of the employee/obligor’s principal place of 
employment if the place of employment is in a state; or the tribal law of the employee/obligor’s principal place of 
employment if the place of employment is under tribal jurisdiction. The CCPA is available at www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/
 
files/WHD/legacy/files/garn01.pdf. If the Order Information section does not indicate that the arrears are greater than 12 
weeks, then the employer should calculate the CCPA limit using the lower percentage.

 

 

 

 

 

If there is more than one IWO against this employee/obligor and you are unable to fully honor all IWOs due to federal, 
state, or tribal withholding limits, you must honor all IWOs to the greatest extent possible, giving priority to current support 
before payment of any past-due support.

 

 

 

If the obligor is a nonemployee, obtain withholding limits from the Supplemental Information section in this IWO.  This 
information is also available at www.acf.hhs.gov/css/resource/state-income-withholding-contacts-and-program-

VI. Additional Information for Employers/Income Withholders:  (Completed by the Sender)

Priority:  Withholding for support has priority over any other legal process under State law against the same income 
(section 466(b)(7) of the Social Security Act). If a federal tax levy is in effect, please notify the sender. 

 

Payments:  You must send child support payments payable by income withholding to the appropriate State Disbursement 
Unit or to a tribal CSE agency within 7 business days, or fewer if required by state law, after the date the income would 
 
have been paid to the employee/obligor and include the date you withheld the support from his or her income.  You may 
combine withheld amounts from more than one employee/obligor’s income in a single payment as long as you separately 
identify each employee/obligor’s portion of the payment.  Child support payments may not be made through the federal 
Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) Child Support Portal. 

 

  

Lump Sum Payments:  You may be required to notify a state or tribal CSE agency of upcoming lump sum payments to 
this employee/obligor such as bonuses, commissions, or severance pay.  Contact the sender to determine if you are 
required to report and/or withhold lump sum payments.  Employers/income withholders may use OCSE’s Child Support 
Portal (ocsp.acf.hhs.gov/csp/) to provide information about employees who are eligible to receive lump sum payments and 
to provide contacts, addresses, and other information about their companies.  Child support payments may not be made 
through the federal OCSE Child Support Portal. 
 

 

 

Liability:  If you have any doubts about the validity of this IWO, contact the sender.  If you fail to withhold income from the 
employee/obligor’s income as the IWO directs, you are liable for both the accumulated amount you should have withheld 
and any penalties set by state or tribal law/procedure.  __________________________________________________________________ 

 

  

Anti-discrimination:  You are subject to a fine determined under state or tribal law for discharging an employee/obligor 
from employment, refusing to employ, or taking disciplinary action against an employee/obligor because of this IWO.
