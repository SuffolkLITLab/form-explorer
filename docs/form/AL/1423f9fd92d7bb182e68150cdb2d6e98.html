Certification of Health Care Provider for 
  
 
Family Member’s Serious Health Condition 
 
 
under the Family and Medical Leave Act 

 

 

 
U.S. Department of Labor 
Wage Hour Division 

 

             

  
DO NOT SEND COMPLETED FORM TO THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. 
RETURN TO THE PATIENT. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

OMB Control Number: 1235-0003 
 
Expires:  6/30/2023 
  
 

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides that an employer may require an employee seeking FMLA leave to care for a 
family member with a serious health condition to submit a medical certification issued by the family member’s health care provider. 29 
U.S.C. §§ 2613, 2614(c)(3); 29 C.F.R. § 825.305. The  employer  must give the employee at least 15 calendar days to provide the 
 
 
certification.  If  the  employee  fails  to  provide  complete  and  sufficient  medical  certification,  his  or  her  FMLA  leave  request  may  be 
 
denied. 29 C.F.R. § 825.313. Information about the FMLA may be found on the WHD website at www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla. 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION I - EMPLOYER 
 
   

Either the employee or the employer may complete Section I. While use of this form is optional, this form asks the health care provider 
 
for the information necessary for a complete and sufficient medical certification, which is set out at 29 C.F.R. § 825.306. You may not 
 
ask  the  employee  to  provide  more  information  than  allowed  under  the  FMLA  regulations,  29  C.F.R.  §§  825.306-825.308. 
Additionally, you may not request a certification for FMLA leave to bond with a healthy newborn child or a child placed for adoption 
 
or foster care. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Employers must generally maintain records and documents relating to medical information, medical certifications, recertifications, or 
 
medical histories of employees or employees’ family members created for FMLA purposes as confidential medical records in separate 
 
files/records from the usual personnel files and in accordance with 29 C.F.R. § 1630.14(c)(1), if the Americans with Disabilities Act 
 
applies, and in accordance with 29 C.F.R. § 1635.9, if the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act applies.

Middle 
 

First 
 

Last 
 

 

(2)  Employer name:  ____________________________________________________   Date: _________________ (mm/dd/yyyy) 

    

(List date certification requested) 

 

 

 

 

(3) The medical certification must be returned by _____________________________________________________ (mm/dd/yyyy) 
(Must allow at least 15 calendar days from the date requested, unless it is not feasible despite the employee’s diligent, good faith efforts.) 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION II - EMPLOYEE 
 
 

Please complete and sign Section II before providing this form to your family member or your family member’s health care provider. 
 
The FMLA allows an employer to require that you submit a timely, complete, and sufficient medical certification to support a request 
 
for FMLA leave due to the serious health condition of your family member.  If requested by your employer, your response is required 
 
 
to obtain or retain the benefit of the FMLA protections. 29 U.S.C. §§ 2613, 2614(c)(3). You are responsible for making sure the 
 
medical certification is provided to your employer within the time frame requested, which must be at least 15 calendar days.  29 
C.F.R. §§ 825.305-825.306. Failure to provide a complete and sufficient medical certification may result in a denial of your FMLA 
leave request. 29 C.F.R. § 825.313. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1)  Name of the family member for whom you will provide care: _________________________________________________ 

 

 

(2)  Select the relationship of the family member to you. The family member is your: 

 

 

 

 

 Spouse 
 Child, age 18 or older and incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability 

 Parent 

 

 

 
 Child, under age 18 
 

 

Spouse  means  a  husband  or  wife  as  defined  or  recognized  in  the  state  where  the  individual  was  married,  including  in  a 
 
common law marriage or same-sex marriage. The terms “child” and “parent” include in loco parentis relationships in which 
a person assumes the obligations of a parent to a child. An employee may take FMLA leave to care for an individual who 
 
assumed the obligations of a parent to the employee when the employee was a child. An employee may also take FMLA 
 
leave to care for a child for whom the employee has assumed the obligations of a parent. No legal or biological relationship 
is necessary.

SECTION III - HEALTH CARE PROVIDER 
 

 

 

Please provide your contact information, complete all relevant parts of this Section, and sign the form below. A family member of your 
 
patient has requested leave under the FMLA to care for your patient. The FMLA allows an employer to require that the employee submit 
 
a timely, complete, and sufficient medical certification to support a request for FMLA leave to care for a family member with a serious 
 
health condition.  For FMLA purposes, a “serious health condition” means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition 
 
 
that involves inpatient care or continuing treatment by a health care provider. For more information about the definitions of a serious 
 
health condition under the FMLA, see the chart at the end of the form. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  also  may,  but  are  not  required  to,  provide  other  appropriate  medical  facts  including  symptoms,  diagnosis,  or  any  regimen  of 
 
continuing treatment such as the use of specialized equipment. Please note that some state or local laws may not allow disclosure of 
 
private medical information about the patient’s serious health condition, such as providing the diagnosis and/or course of treatment.

Limit your response to the medical condition for which the employee is seeking FMLA leave.  Your answers should be your 
 
best estimate based upon your medical knowledge, experience, and examination of the patient. After completing Part A, complete 
Part B to provide information about the amount of leave needed. Note: For FMLA purposes, “incapacity” means the inability to 
 
work, attend school, or perform regular daily activities due to the condition, treatment of the condition, or recovery from the condition. 
Do not provide information about genetic tests, as defined in 29 C.F.R. § 1635.3(f), genetic services, as defined in 29 C.F.R. § 1635.3(e),

Definitions of a Serious Health Condition (See 29 C.F.R. §§ 825.113-.115) 
 

 

 

 

Inpatient Care 
 

•  An overnight stay in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility. 
  
 
•  Inpatient care includes any period of incapacity or any subsequent treatment in connection with the overnight stay. 
 
 
 

 

 

Continuing Treatment by a Health Care Provider (any one or more of the following) 
 
Incapacity Plus Treatment: A period of incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days, and any subsequent treatment 
 
 
or period of incapacity relating to the same condition, that also involves either: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

o  Two or more in-person visits to a health care provider for treatment  within 30 days of the first day of incapacity  unless 
 
 
 

 
extenuating circumstances exist. The first visit must be within seven days of the first day of incapacity; or, 

 

 

 

o  At least one in-person visit to a health care provider for treatment within seven days of the first day of incapacity, which 
 
 
 
results  in  a  regimen  of  continuing  treatment  under  the  supervision  of  the  health  care  provider.  For  example,  the  health 
 
 
provider might prescribe a course of prescription medication or therapy requiring special equipment. 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Pregnancy: Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or for prenatal care. 

 
Chronic Conditions: Any period of incapacity due to or treatment for a chronic serious health condition, such as diabetes, asthma, 
migraine headaches. A chronic serious health condition is one which requires visits to a health care provider (or nurse supervised by 
 
the provider) at least twice a year and recurs over an extended period of time. A chronic condition may cause episodic rather than a 
 
continuing period of incapacity. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Permanent  or  Long-term  Conditions:  A  period  of  incapacity  which  is  permanent  or  long-term  due  to  a  condition  for  which 
 
treatment may not be effective, but which requires the continuing supervision of a health care provider, such as Alzheimer’s disease 
or the terminal stages of cancer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Conditions Requiring Multiple Treatments: Restorative surgery after an accident or other injury; or, a condition that would likely 
result in a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days if the patient did not receive the treatment.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
