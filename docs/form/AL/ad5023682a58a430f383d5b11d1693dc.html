(cid:133) Other: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

RIGHTS YOU HAVE AND WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHTS 
      Under the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution and laws of the State of Alabama, you have a right to remain silent and you may  not 
be compelled to give evidence against yourself. Your attorney cannot disclose any confidential talks he/she has had with you. You are not required  to 
answer any questions. If you do answer questions knowing that you have a right to remain silent, you will have waived this right.  
       You have the right to enter, and continue to assert, a plea of “Not Guilty” or “Not Guilty by Reason of Mental Disease or Defect”, and have a public 
trial before a duly selected jury. The jury would decide your guilt or innocence based upon the evidence presented before them. If you elect to proceed  to 
trial, you would have the right to be present, you would have the right to have your attorney present to assist you, you would have the right to confront 
and cross examine your accuser(s) and all the State’s witnesses, you would have the right to subpoena witnesses to testify on your behalf and to have 
their attendance in court and their testimony required by the court, and you would have the right to take the witness stand and to testify, but only if you 
chose to do so, as no one can require you to do this. If you elect to testify, you can be cross examined by the State, just as any other witness is  
subjected to cross examination. If you decide not to testify, no one but your attorney will be allowed to comment about that fact to the jury. Your  attorney 
is bound to do everything he/she can honorably and reasonably do to see that you obtain a fair and impartial trial.  
         If you elect to proceed to trial, you come to court presumed to be innocent. This presumption of innocence will follow you throughout the trial until 
the State produces sufficient evidence to convince the jury (or the court if the trial is non-jury) of your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. You have no 
burden of proof in this case. If the State fails to meet its burden, you would be found not guilty. If you are entering a guilty plea to a charge for which you 
have not yet been indicted, you are waiving indictment by a grand jury and you will be pleading guilty to a charge preferred against you by a District 
Attorney’s Information filed with the court.  
       Pursuant to Section 15–22–27.3, Ala. Code 1975, if you are pleading guilty to a sex offense involving a child as defined in Section 15-20A-4,Ala. 
Code 1975, which constitutes a Class A or B felony, you will not be eligible for parole.

          IF  YOU  PLEAD  GUILTY,  THERE  WILL  BE  NO  TRIAL.  YOU  WILL  BE  WAIVING  THE  RIGHTS  OUTLINED  ABOVE,  EXCEPT  YOUR  RIGHTS 
RELATING  TO  REPRESENTATION  BY  AN  ATTORNEY.  THE  STATE  WILL  HAVE  NOTHING  TO  PROVE,  AND  YOU  WILL  BE  CONVICTED  AND 
SENTENCED BASED ON YOUR GUILTY PLEA.  BY ENTERING A PLEA OF GUILTY, YOU WILL ALSO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL, UNLESS 
(1) YOU HAVE, BEFORE ENTERING THE PLEA OF GUILTY, EXPRESSLY RESERVED THE RIGHT TO APPEAL WITH RESPECT TO PARTICULAR
ISSUE OR ISSUES, IN WHICH EVENT APPELLATE REVIEW SHALL BE LIMITED TO A DETERMINATION OF THE ISSUE / ISSUES RESERVED, OR
THE WITHDRAWAL IS NECESSARY TO CORRECT A MANIFEST INJUSTICE, & THE COURT HAS DENIED YOUR MOTION TO WITHDRAW YOUR
PLEA, OR THE MOTION HAS BEEN DEEMED DENIED BY OPERATION OF LAW.

  IF  YOU  HAVE  A  RIGHT  TO  APPEAL  UNDER  ONE  OF  THE  CONDITIONS  ABOVE  AND  YOU  ARE  DETERMINED  BY  THE  COURT  TO  BE 
INDIGENT,  COUNSEL  WILL  BE  APPOINTED  TO  REPRESENT  YOU  ON  APPEAL  IF  YOU  SO  DESIRE  AND  IF  THE  APPEAL  IS  FROM  A  CIRCUIT 
COURT JUDGMENT OR SENTENCE, A COPY OF THE RECORD AND THE REPORTER’S TRANSCRIPT WILL BE PROVIDED AT NO COST TO YOU.
 IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS OR THE CONSEQUENCES OF PLEADING GUILTY, PLEASE LET THE COURT  KNOW 

NOW AND FURTHER EXPLANATION WILL BE MADE.
