RIGHTS YOU HAVE AND THE WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHTS 

Under the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution and laws of the State of Alabama, you have a right to remain silent and you may 
not be compelled  to  give  evidence  against  yourself.  Your  attorney  cannot  disclose  any  confidential  talks  he/she  has  had  with  you.  You  do  not  have 
to  answer  any  questions. If you do answer questions knowing that you have a right to remain silent, you will have waived this right. 

You have the right to enter, or stand on if previously entered, a plea of “Not Guilty” or Not Guilty by Reason of Mental Disease or Defect,” or 
“Not Guilty and Not Guilty by Reason of Mental Disease or Defect” and have a public trial before a duly selected jury. The jury would decide your guilt 
or innocence based upon the evidence presented before them. If you elect to proceed to trial, you would have the right to be present, you would have 
the  right  to  have  your  attorney  present  to  assist  you,  you  would  have  the  right  to  confront  and  cross  examine  your  accuser(s)  and  all  the  State’s 
witnesses, you would have the right to subpoena witnesses  to  testify  on  your  behalf  and  to  have  their  attendance  in  court  and  their  testimony  required 
by  the  court,  and  you  would  have  the  right  to  take  the  witness  stand  and  to  testify,  but  only  if  you  chose  to  do  so,  as  no  one  can  require  you  to  do 
this.  If  you  elect  to  testify,  you  can  be  cross  examined  by  the  State  just  as  any  other  witness  is  subjected  to  cross  examination.  If  you  elect  not  to 
testify, no one but your attorney will be allowed to comment about that fact to the jury. Your attorney is bound to do everything he/she can honorably 
and reasonably do to see that you obtain a fair and impartial trial. 

If  you  elect  to  proceed  to  trial,  you  come  to  court  presumed  to  be  innocent.  This  presumption  of  innocence  will  follow  you  throughout  the  trial 
until  the  State  produces  sufficient  evidence  to  convince  the  jury  (or  the  court  if  the  trial  is  non-jury)  of  your  guilt  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  You 
have no burden of proof in this case. If the State fails to meet its burden, you would be found not guilty. 

If you are entering a guilty plea to a charge for which you have not yet been indicted, you are  waiving indictment by a grand jury and you will be 

pleading guilty to a charge preferred against you by a District Attorn ey’s Information filed with the court. 

If  you  are  not  a  United  States  citizen,  a  guilty  plea  may  subject  you  to  adverse  immigration  consequences,  including  deportation  (see  8  U.S.C.  § 

1227),  exclusion from reentry to the United States and amnesty, and that the appropriate consulate may be informed of the plea and conviction.  

 If you are convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, which has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the 
threatened use  of  a  deadly  weapon,  against  your  current  or  former  spouse;  your  child  of  whom  you  are  a  parent  or  guardian;  a  person  with  whom 
you  share  a  child  in  common;  a  spouse,  parent,  or  guardian  with  whom  you  are,  or  have  been,  cohabiting  or  to  whom  you  are  similarly  situated, 
and  you  ship  or  transport  in  interstate  or  foreign  commerce,  or  possess  in  or  affecting  commerce,  any  firearm  or  ammunition,  or  if  you  receive  any 
firearm or ammunition which has been shipped  or  transported  in  interstate  or  foreign  commerce,  YOU  ARE  SUBJECT  TO  BEING  PROSECUTED 
IN  FEDERAL  COURT  FOR  VIOLATING  18 U.S.C. 922(g)(9).  

Pursuant to Section 15–22–27.3, Ala. Code 1975, if you are pleading guilty to a sex offense involving a child as defined in Section 15-20A-4, Ala. 

Code 1975, which constitutes a Class A or B felony, you will not be eligible for parole.

If you plead guilty, there will be no trial. You will be waiving the rights outlined above, except your rights  relating to representation by an attorney. 
The state will have nothing to prove and you will stand guilty on your guilty plea. By entering a plea of guilty, YOU WILL ALSO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT 
TO  APPEAL,  unless  in  appeals    to  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  or  the  Supreme  Court  (1)  you  have,  before  entering  the  plea  of  guilty,  expressly 
reserved  the  right  to  appeal  with  respect  to  a  particular issue or issues, in which event appellate review shall be limited to a determination of the issue or 
issues  reserved,  or  (2)  you  have  timely  filed  a  motion  to  withdraw  the  plea  of  guilty  after  pronouncement  of  sentence  on  the  ground  that  the 
withdrawal  is  necessary  to  correct  a  manifest  injustice,  and  the  court  has  denied  your  motion  to withdraw  your plea,  or  the  motion  has  been  deemed 
denied by operation of law. 

IF  YOU  HAVE  A  RIGHT  TO  APPEAL  UNDER  ONE  OF  THE  CONDITIONS  ABOVE  AND  YOU  ARE  DETERMINED  BY  THE  COURT 
TO  BE  INDIGENT,  COUNSEL  WILL  BE  APPOINTED  TO  REPRESENT  YOU  ON  APPEAL  IF  YOU  SO  DESIRE  AND  IF  THE  APPEAL  IS 
FROM  A  CIRCUIT  COURT  JUDGMENT  OR  SENTENCE,  A  COPY  OF  THE  RECORD  AND  REPORTER’S  TRANSCRIPT  WILL  BE  PROVIDED 
AT  NO  COST  TO  YOU.  IF  THE  APPEAL  IS  FROM  A  MUNICIPAL  OR  DISTRICT  COURT  JUDGMENT  TO  CIRCUIT  COURT,  YOU  HAVE  A 
RIGHT TO DEMAND A JURY TRIAL IF YOU INDICATE YOUR WISH TO ASSERT THIS RIGHT ON THE NOTICE OF APPEAL. 

IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS OR THE CONSEQUENCES OF PLEADING GUILTY, PLEASE LET THE COURT 

KNOW NOW AND FURTHER EXPLANATION WILL BE MADE. 

The court having personally addressed the defendant determines that the defendant has entered the plea voluntarily.
