EXPLANATION  OF  RIGHTS  AND  PLEA  OF  GUILTY 
(Habitual Felony Offender – Circuit/District Court) 

 
RIGHTS YOU HAVE AND WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHTS 
 
     Under the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution and laws of the State of Alabama, you have a right to remain silent and you may 
not be compelled to give evidence against yourself. You attorney cannot disclose any confidential talks he/she has had with you. You are not required 
to answer any questions. If you do answer questions knowing that you have a right to remain silent, you will have waived this right. You have the right 
to enter, and continue to assert, a plea of “Not Guilty” or “Not Guilty by Reason of Mental Disease or Defect”, and have a public trial before a duly 
selected jury. The jury would decide your guilt or innocence based upon the evidence presented before them. If you elect   to proceed to trial, you would 
have the right to be present, you would have the right to have your attorney present to assist you, you would have the right to confront and cross 
examine your accuser(s) and all the State’s witnesses, you would have the right to subpoena witnesses to testify on your behalf and to have their 
attendance in court and their testimony required by the court, and you would have the right to take the witness stand and to testify, but only if your 
choose to  do  so,  as  no  one can require  you  to  do  this. If  you  elect  to testify,  you can  be  cross  examined  by  the  State, just  as  any  other  witness  
is subjected to cross examination. If you decide not to testify, no one but your attorney will be allowed to comment about that fact to the jury. Your 
attorney is bound to do everything he/she can honorably and reasonably do to see that you obtain a fair and impartial trial. 
     
      If you elect to proceed to trial, you come to court presumed to be innocent. This presumption of innocence will follow you throughout the trial until 
the State produces sufficient evidence to convince the jury (or the court if the trial is non-jury) of your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. You have no 
burden of proof in this case. If the State fails to meet its burden, you would be found not guilty. If you are entering a guilty plea to a charge for which 
you have not yet been indicted, you are waiving indictment by a grand jury and you will be pleading guilty to a charge preferred against you by a District 
Attorney’s Information filed with the court. 
     
     If you are not a United States citizen, a guilty plea may subject you to adverse immigration consequences, including deportation (See 8 U.S.C. 
§1227), exclusion from reentry to the United States and amnesty, and that the appropriate consulate may be informed of the plea and conviction. 

    If you plead guilty, there will be no trial. You will be waiving your rights outlined above, except your rights relating to representation by an attorney. 
The state will have nothing to prove and you will stand guilty on your guilty plea. By entering a plea of guilty, YOU WILL ALSO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT 
TO  APPEAL,  unless  in  appeals to  the  Court  of  Criminal Appeals or  the  Supreme  Court  (1)  you  have  before  entering  the  plea  of  guilty,  expressly 
reserved the right to appeal with respect to a particular issue or issues, in which event appellate review shall be limited to a determination of the issue 
or issues reserved, (2)  you have timely filed a motion to withdraw the plea of guilty after pronouncement of sentence on the ground that the withdrawal 
is necessary to correct a manifest injustice, and the court has denied your motion to withdraw your plea, or the motion has been deemed denied by 
operation of law. 

    IF  YOU  HAVE  A  RIGHT  TO  APPEAL  UNDER  ONE  OF  THE  CONDITIONS  ABOVE  AND  YOU  ARE  DETERMINED  BY  THE  COURT  TO  BE 
INDIGENT, COUNSEL WILL BE APPOINTED TO REPRESENT YOU ON APPEAL IF YOU SO DESIRE AND IF THE APPEAL IS FROM A CIRCUIT 
COURT JUDGMENT OR SENTENCE, A COPY OF THE RECORD AND REPORTER’S TRANSCRIPT WILL BE PROVIDED AT NO COST TO YOU. 
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS OR THE CONSEQUENCES OF PLEADING GUILTY, PLEASE LET THE COURT KNOW 
NOW AND FURTHER EXPLANATION WILL BE MADE. 

he court having personally addressed the defendant determines that the defendant has entered the plea voluntarily. 

ATTORNEY’S CERTIFICATE 
 
     I certify that the above was fully read to the defendant by me; that I explained the penalty or penalties involved with the defendant; that I discussed 
in detail defendant’s rights and the consequences of pleading guilty; and that, in my judgment, the defendant understands the same and that he/she is 
knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waiving his/her rights and entering a voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty. I further certify to the court that I 
have in no way forced or induced the defendant to plead guilty and to my knowledge no one else has done so.

DEFENDANT’S STATEMENT OF WAIVER OF RIGHTS AND PLEA OF GUILTY 

    I certify to the court that my attorney has read and explained the matters set forth above; that my rights have been discussed with me in detail and 
fully explained; that I understand the charge or charges against me; that I understand my rights, the punishment or punishments provided by law as 
they may apply to my case, and I understand the consequences of pleading guilty; that I am not under the influence of any drugs, medicines, or alcoholic 
beverages; and I have not been threatened or abused or offered any inducement, reward, or hope of reward to plead guilty other than the terms of the 
plea agreement which will be stated on the record. I further state to the court that I am guilty of the charge to which I am entering a plea of guilty, that I 
desire to plead guilty, that I made up my own mind to plead guilty and that I knowingly and intelligently, and voluntarily waive my right to trial in this 
case. I further state that I am satisfied with my attorney’s services and his/her handling of my case.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
