This  Notice  is  being  given  to  you  to  explain  that  a  portion  of  your  wages/salary/benefits  may  be  withheld  by  your 
employer/by the Department of Industrial Relations by Order of this Court, to enforce your obligation to pay child support and, in 
appropriate  cases,  spousal  support.  YOU  HAVE  CERTAIN  LEGAL  RIGHTS.  Your  employer  may  not  fire  you  solely  because 

your wages are subjected to this withholding order. If you are currently supporting a spouse or family, in addition to the one(s) 
for which this order has been entered, no more than 50% of your disposable earnings/benefits may be withheld. If you are not 
supporting an additional spouse or family, up to 60% of your disposable earnings/benefits may be withheld. These amounts can 
go up to 55% and 65% respectively, if your are more than three (3) months in arrears. Section 30-3-64, code of Alabama 1975, 
provides  that  you  may  ask  the  Court  to  modify  or  terminate  its  order  for  certain  limited  reasons.  If  you  feel  that  you  do  not 
understand the nature of these proceedings or you have any questions about your legal rights, contact a lawyer.

       THAT IS BEING TAKEN.

time.  YOU  SHOULD  MAKE  YOUR  SUPPORT  PAYMENTS  AS  ORDERED  BY  THE  COURT.  If  you  wish  to  have 

withholding  served  upon  your  employer/the  Department  of  Industrial  Relations,  you  may  file  with  the  clerk  of  court  a 
sworn affidavit stating the appropriate basis upon which service of the Withholding Order is now being sought.

to begin withholding the amount(s) ordered form your wages/salary/benefit and to pay them to the appropriate office on a 

monthly basis. Your employer/the Department of Industrial Relations is required by law to file an Answer with the Court 
and will begin withholding within fourteen(14) days of the service of this Order upon him. 

 

 

DO NOT DISREGARDED THIS NOTICE. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT LEGAL PROCEEDING. THIS IS A CONTINUING 

ORDER  AND  MAY  BE  SERVED  ON  YOUR  PRESENT  AND  ANY  FUTURE  EMPLOYER  AS  WELL  AS  THE 
IF  YOU  RECEIVED  (cid:133)UNEMPLOYMENT  COMPENSATION 
DEPARTMENT  OF 
BENEFITS. THEREFORE, IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP TRACK OF THE AMOUNTS APPLIED TO THE

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
