      <pre>Vendor Disclosure Statement Information and Instructions 

Act 2001-955 requires the disclosure statement to be completed and filed with all proposals, bids, contracts, or 
grant proposals to the State of Alabama in excess of $5,000. The disclosure statement is not required for 
contracts for gas, water, and electric services where no competition exits, or where rates are fixed by law or 
ordinance. In circumstances where a contract is awarded by competitive bid, the disclosure statement shall be 
required only from the person receiving the contract and shall be submitted within ten (10) days of the award. 

A copy of the disclosure statement shall be filed with the awarding entity and the Department of Examiners of 
Public Accounts and if it pertains to a state contract, a copy shall be submitted to the Contract Review 
Permanent Legislative Oversight Committee. The address for the Department of Examiners of Public Accounts 
is as follows: 50 N. Ripley Street, Room 3201, Montgomery, Alabama 36130-2101. If the disclosure statement 
is filed with a contract, the awarding entity should include a copy with the contract when it is presented to the 
Contract Review Permanent Legislative Oversight Committee. 

The State of Alabama shall not enter into any contract or appropriate any public funds with any person who 
refuses to provide information required by Act 2001-955. 

Pursuant to Act 2001-955, any person who knowingly provides misleading or incorrect information on the 
disclosure statement shall be subject to a civil penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the transaction, not 
to exceed $10,000.00. Also, the contract or grant shall be voidable by the awarding entity. 

Definitions as Provided in Act 2001-955

is a family member of the public official or public employee. 

Person - An individual, firm, partnership, association, joint venture, cooperative, or corporation, or any other

Public Official and Public Employee - These terms shall have the same meanings ascribed to them in 
Sections 36-25-1(23) and 36-25-1(24), Code of Alabama 1975, (see below) except for the purposes of the 
disclosure requirements of this act, the terms shall only include persons in a position to influence the awarding

shall also include the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, members of the cabinet of the Governor, and members of 
the Legislature. 

Section 36-25-1(23), Code of Alabama 1975, defines a public employee as any person employed at the state,

authorities, but excluding employees of hospitals or other health care corporations including contract employees 
of those hospitals or other health care corporations, who is paid in whole or in part from state, county, or 
municipal funds. For purposes of this chapter, a public employee does not include a person employed on a part-
time basis whose employment is limited to providing professional services other than lobbying, the 
compensation for which constitutes less than 50 percent of the part-time employee's income. 

Section 36-25-1(24), Code of Alabama 1975, defines a public official as any person elected to public office, 
whether or not that person has taken office, by the vote of the people at state, county, or municipal level of 
government or their instrumentalities, including governmental corporations, and any person appointed to a 
position at the state, county, or municipal level of government or their instrumentalities, including governmental 
corporations. For purposes of this chapter, a public official includes the chairs and vice-chairs or the equivalent 
offices of each state political party as defined in Section 17-16-2, Code of Alabama 1975.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
