      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF MORGAN COUNTY, ALABAMA . STATE OF ALABAMA, . PLAINTIFF, . CASE NO. CC . VS. . DEFENDANT. . NOTICE AND WAIVER OF RIGHT TO APPEAL . AND RIGHT TO SEEK POST CONVICTION RELIEF . NOTICE . Comes now the State of Alabama and serves notice upon the Defendant that under Alabama law and the applicable Rules of . Court, the Defendant has a right to appeal any judgment of conviction or the imposition of any sentence ordered by this Court. . The . right to appeal is, simply, the Defendant's right to have the proceedings in the trial court reviewed by an appellate court for the . purpose of correcting any reversible error that may have been made. The right to appeal is available to the Defendant whether h. e is . convinced after trial, as a result of a blind plea or as a result of a plea entered in accord with a valid plea agreement. . In addition to the right to appeal, a criminal Defendant has the right to be represented by an attorney during the appellate . process. Should the Defendant be unable to afford an attorney, the Court will appoint an attorney to represent him free of char. ge. . The Defendant is also entitled to obtain a copy of the official transcript of the proceedings in the trial court if he elects t. o exercise his right to appeal. Should the Defendant be unable to afford a copy of the transcript, one will be provided for him f. ree of . charge. . In most cases where the Defendant receives a sentence of 20 years or less, he is entitled to make an appeal bond, which . would permit him to be released while his case is being reviewed by the appellate court. The amount and terms of such a bond wo. uld be . left to the discretion of the trial court. . A criminal Defendant may also attack the validity of his conviction or sentence by the filing of certain post judgement . motions (i. e. , Motion for New Trial, Motion in Arrest of Judgment, . Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea, etc. ) or by filing with the t. rial court a . Petition for Post Conviction Relief under Rule 32, ARCr P, or seeking post conviction relief in Federal Court (i. e. , Habeas Corp. us) . . WAIVER . After discussion and negotiation between the parties, after a full explanation of rights has been given to Defendant as . evidenced by the attached Explanation of Rights form, and after . such disclosure of information between the parties as each deem. s sufficient, it is agreed in this case, subject to acceptance by the Court that the Defendant knowingly and voluntarily agrees t. o waive his . right to appeal or contest, directly or collaterally, his conviction or sentence on any ground, unless the Court should impose . a sentence . in excess of the statutory maximum or was wit. hout jurisdiction to enter the judgment or impose the sentence. This waiver is mad. e a . part of and is given in consideration of the plea agreement reached in this cause by the Defendant and the State of Alabama. It. is . intended to be a comprehensive and complete waiver of all appellate rights in this case. Defendant agrees not to seek an appeal. bond, not to give notice of appeal, not to request a transcript of the proceedings, and not to request the appointment of appel. late . counsel. In addition to agreeing that he will never attack this conviction or sentence, Defendant agrees to seek to have dismis. sed with . prejudice all pending post judgment motions and/or petitions (including, but not limited to, petitions filed pursuant to Rule 3. 2, ARCr P) . and will not appeal any denial or dismissal of any such motions or petitions. Defendant acknowledges that the initiation, . . reinstatement, commencement or continued pursuit of any post judgment attack upon his conviction or sentence, whether in the fo. rm . of a direct appeal or collateral attack (. i. e. , Rule 32, Habeas Co. rpus, Comm Nobis, etc. ) , except upon the grounds stated above, . would . be barred by this waiver and would act to make the plea agreement reached in the above styled case voidable by the District . . Attorney. . IN MAKING THIS WAIVER, THE DEFENDANT UNDERSTANDS THAT HE IS GIVING UP HIS RIGHT TO HAVE HIS . CONVICTION AND SENTENCE REVIEWED BY AN APPELLATE COURT. HE ENTERS INTO THIS WAIVER FOR THE PURPOSE OF . RECEIVING THE BENEFITS OF A NEGOTIATED PLEA, AND, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH HIS ATTORNEY, OR, IF HE IS ACTING . PRO SE, AFTER HAVING HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH THE COURT REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS . . WAIVER, HE BELIEVES THAT IF IT IS IN HIS BEST INTEREST TO EXECUTE THIS DOCUMENT. The Defendant states to the Court that he . . has read, or has had read to him, the matters and rights hereinabove set forth as well as those set forth in the attached Expla. nations of Rights . form: that his attorney has . discussed said matters and rights with hi. m in detail, or, if he is acting pro se, . the Court has afforded him an . opportunity to ask questions about this waiver, and the Defendan. t fully understands its content and meaning: that he is not und. er the . influence of any drugs, medicines or alcoho. lic beverages and has not been threatened or. abused or offered any inducement or rew. ard . to get him to execute document. . ) ) . ) ) ) ) ) ) Having read and understood the foregoing, I agree to: . I) waive m. y rights to a. ppeal this case directl. y to an a. ppellate court. ; Initials . 2) waive all my rights to challenge the conviction or sentence indirectly or collaterally by filing a separate . action; and . Initials . 3) dismiss, with prej. udice, any pending proceedi. ngs attacking this conviction or sentence. . Initials . SHOULD YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WHATSOEVER CONCERNIN. G THIS DOCUMENT, DO NOT SIGN IT UNTIL YOU HAVE . ADDRESSED THOSE QUES. TIONS TO THE COURT. . DATE . DEFENDANT . I am the attorney for the above referenced Defendant, and I ce. rtify that the preceding notice and waiver were read by the . Defendant in my presence, or were read to him by me, that I discu. ssed such rights with the Defendant in detail and that a writt. en copy of . the above rights were given to the Defendant by me. Having gone . over his rights and the consequences of this waiver, I am of th. e opinion that the Defendant understands his right to appeal an. d knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waives said right. .
