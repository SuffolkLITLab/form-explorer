RIGHTS YOU HAVE AND WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHTS  

Under the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution and laws of the State of Alabama, you have a right to remain silent and  you may 
not  be  compelled  to  give  evidence  against  yourself.  You  attorney  cannot  disclose  any  confidential  talks  he/she  has  had  with  you.  You  are 
not required to  answer any questions. If you  do answer questions knowing that  you have a  right to remain silent,  you  will have  waived this right.  
You have the right to enter, and continue to assert, a plea of “Not Guilty” or  “Not Guilty by Reason of Mental Disease or Defect”, and have a public 
evidence 
trial  before  a  duly  selected  jury.  The 
presented  before 
elect  to  proceed  to  trial,  you  would  have  the  right  to  be  present,  you  would  have  the  right  to  have 
your  attorney  present  to  assist  you,  you  would  have  the  right  to  confront  and  cross  examine  your  accuser(s)  and  all  the  State’s  witnesses,  you 
would  have  the  right  to  subpoena  witnesses  to  testify  on  your  behalf  and  to  have  their  attendance  in  court  and  their  testimony  required  by 
the  court,  and  you  would  have the right to  take the  witness stand and to testify,  but only if your choose to do  so, as no  one can require you  to do 
this.  If you elect  to testify, you  can  be cross examined by  the State, just as any  other witness is subjected  to cross examination. If you decide  not to 
testify, no one but your attorney  will be allowed to comment about that fact to the jury. Your  attorney is bound to do everything he/she can honorably 
and reasonably do to see that you obtain a fair  and impartial trial.

If you elect to proceed to trial,  you come to court presumed to  be innocent. This presumption  of innocence will follow you throughout the trial 
until the  State  produces  sufficient  evidence  to  convince  the  jury  (or  the  court  if  the  trial  is  non-jury)  of  your  guilt  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt. 
You have no burden of proof in this case. If the State fails to meet its burden, you would be found not guilty. If you are entering a guilty plea to a 
charge  for  which  you  have  not  yet  been  indicted,  you  are  waiving  indictment  by  a  grand  jury  and  you  will  be  pleading  guilty  to  a 
charge preferred against you by a Dis trict Attorney’s Information filed with the court.

If  you  are  not  a  United  States  citizen,  a  guilty  plea  may  subject  you  to  adverse  immigration  consequences,  including  deportation 
(See 8  U.S.C.  §1227),  exclusion  from reentry  to  the  United  States  and  amnesty,  and  that  the  appropriate  consulate  may  be  informed  of  the  plea 
and conviction.  

Pursuant to Section 15–22–27.3, Ala. Code 1975, if you are pleading guilty to a sex offense involving a child as defined in Section 15-20A-4, 

Ala. Code 1975, which constitutes a Class A or B felony, you will not be eligible for parole.

If  you  plead  guilty,  there  will  be  no  trial.  You  will  be  waiving  your  rights  outlined  above,  except  your    rights  relating  to  representation  by  an 
attorney. The state will have nothing to prove and you will stand guilty on your guilty plea. By entering a plea of guilty, YOU WILL ALSO WAIVE 
YOUR  RIGHT  TO  APPEAL,  unless  in  appeals  to  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  or  the  Supreme  Court  (1)  you  have  before  entering  the  plea  of 
guilty,  expressly  reserved  the  right  to  appeal  with  respect  to  a  particular  issue  or  issues,  in  which  event  appellate  review  shall  be  limited  to  a 
determination of the issue or issues reserved, (2)  you have timely filed a motion to withdraw the plea of guilty after pronouncement of sentence 
on the ground that the withdrawal is necessary to correct a manifest injustice, and the court has denied your motion to withdraw your plea, or the  
motion has been deemed denied by operation of law.  

IF  YOU  HAVE  A  RIGHT  TO  APPEAL  UNDER  ONE  OF  THE  CONDITIONS  ABOVE  AND  YOU  ARE  DETERMINED  BY  THE  COURT  TO  BE 
INDIGENT,  COUNSEL  WILL  BE  APPOINTED  TO  REPRESENT  YOU  ON  APPEAL  IF  YOU  SO  DESIRE  AND  IF  THE  APPEAL  IS  FROM  A 
CIRCUIT  COURT  JUDGMENT  OR  SENTENCE,  A  COPY  OF  THE  RECORD  AND  REPORTER’S  TRANSCRIPT  WILL  BE  PROVIDED  AT  NO 
COST TO YOU. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS OR THE CONSEQUENCES OF PLEADING GUILTY, PLEASE LET THE 
COURT KNOW  NOW AND FURTHER EXPLANATION WILL BE MADE

The court having personally addressed the defendant determines that the defendant has entered the plea voluntarily.
