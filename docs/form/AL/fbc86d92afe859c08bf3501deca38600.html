      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;">Here is the form text we found: State of Alabama . Unified Judicial System . Form JU- 4 (front) Rev. INFORMAL ADJUSTMENT Court Case Number IN THE JUVENILE COURT OF COUNTY, ALABAMA (Name of County) . In the Matter of , a child A complaint concerning the aboveŒnamed child has been filed and an . informal adjustment of this matter is hereby agreed . to, subject to the following term. s, conditions, and understandings: ** 1. That this court has jurisdiction to consider this matter, and. 2. That the child and his/her parents. , legal guardian, or legal custodian have been advised of their rights. ; and This Agreement will be in force for six months unless sooner terminated. . It is further understood that we will be notified upon termination or dismissal of this . Agreement. I acknowledge that . we have read, or have had read to us, the information which is printed on the reverse side . of this form and it has been explained to . us. Agreed : Signature of Child Signature of Parent / Legal Guardian/ Legal Custodian Recommended and Agreed : Date Signature of Juvenile Court Intake Officer** ** Note to Juvenile Court Intake Officer: In using this Agreement, you must explain Rule 15 of the Alabama Rules of . Juvenile Procedure. IN FULLand satisfy yourself that all conditions of this Rule are understood by all parties. (Rule 15 printed on the back of this form. ) . Rule 15, Ala. R. Juv. P; Ala. Code 1975, § 12 15 119 Original: INTAKE OFFICECopy: PARENT/LEGAL GUARDIAN/LEGAL CUSTODIAN Copy: CHILD (Name of C. hild) ALABAMA RULES OF JUVENILE PROCEDURE . Rule 15. Informal adjustment. (A) After receiving a complaint alleging that a child is delinquent or in need of . supervision and after determining that info. rmal adjustment is appropriate, a . juvenile probation officer who has been des. ignated as a juvenile court intake . officer may use the informal adjustment pr. ocess, with the cons. ent of the child . and his or her parent or parent. s, legal guardian, or lega. l custodian. Prior to any . informal adjustment, the child and his or . her parent or parents, legal guardian, or . legal custodian must be advised. of their rights, including . the right to counsel. Any . waiver of the right to counsel by the ch. ild and his or her par. ent or parents, legal . guardian, or legal custodian during the . informal adjustment process shall apply . only to that process and shall not constitute. a waiver of the right to counsel by . these persons for any subsequent . proceeding in the juvenile court. . Utilization of . the informal adjustment process shall susp. end the 21 day time frame for filing a . petition pursuant to Rule. 12 (E) of these Rules. (B) An informal adjustment shall in. clude counseling of and advising the . child and his or her parent . or parents, legal . guardian, or legal . custodian by the . juvenile probation officer. This func. tion may be performed by other appropriate . persons including the juvenile court jud. ge in the discretion of the juvenile . probation officer. An informal adjustment also may include the following: . . (1) Supervision of the child by the ju. venile probation offi. cer and temporary placement of the child wit. h persons other than the par. ent or parents, legal . guardian, or legal custodian . with the consent of t. he child and his or her . parent or parents, legal guardian, or legal custodian; and . (2) Referrals by the juvenile probat. ion officer to pub. lic and private agencies that may provide assistance or . services to the child and his or . her parent or parents, legal guardian, or legal custodian. . (C) The informal adjustment process shall not continue beyond a period of six months from the date the informal adjustment document is executed. . (D) If the child fails to comply with one or more conditions of the informal-. adjustment process, the process may be . terminated, and the juvenile probation . officer may deliver for filing a petition all. eging that the child is. delinquent or in . need of supervision. . . (E) If the child satisfactorily co. mpletes the requirements of informal-. adjustment, the process shall be terminat. ed. Upon termination of the informal-. adjustment process, the juv. enile probation officer shall . notify the child and his or . her parent or parents, legal guardian, or legal custodian. . . [Amended eff. 6 12 90, eff. 8 1-90; Amended eff. 11 2-2009; Amended 7 14 2011, eff. 10 1-2011; Amended . 5 1-2014, eff. 7 1-2014. ] . Comment Informal adjustment procedures allow t. he intake office to suspend formal . proceedings and proceed to adjustment satisf. actory to the parties. This rule . provides adjustment wit. hout the necessity of the filing of a petition. . ﬁCustodian, ﬂ as used in this and other rules, does not mean ﬁlegal . custodianﬂ as defined in Section 5 101 (. g) of Act No. 1205, Acts of Alabama, . 1975 Regular Session, and is intended to include the guardian of the child. . Comment to Amendment to Rule 15 Effective November 2, 2009 Subsection (A) was amended by substituting the language " [u] pon the receipt . of a complaint alleging that a child is del. inquent or in need of supervision" for the . language " [i] f there is sufficient. evidence to bring the child . within the jurisdiction of the . court, " because informal adjustment occurs . after the filing of a complaint and before . the filing of a petition. See Ala. Code 1975, § 12 15 119. Also, throughout this rule, the langua. ge "juvenile probation officer who has . been designated to be a juvenile court" was a. dded before the term "intake officer" to . clarify that the informal adju. stment process should be handl. ed by juvenile probation . officers who have been designated as juve. nile intake officers because juvenile . probation officers are better trained to deal . with this process than . are other employees . of the judicial branch. Other technical changes were made. Comment to Amendment to Rule 15 . Effective October 1, 2011 This rule was completely rewritt. en for purposes of clarification and . simplicity. Subsection (E) was amended to. delete the language "and report that . action to the juvenile court" because t. he informal adjustment process is handled . before a petition is filed in juvenile court; . thus, there is no me. chanism by which to . report such an action to the juvenile court. Comment to Amendment to Rule 15 . Effective July 1, 2014 . Subsection (A) of Rule 15 was amended to limit the application of a waiver of the right to counsel to the informal adjustment process. . Subsection (C) of Rule 15 was amended to provide a trigger date for the six month informal adjustment process. . Subsection (E) of Rule 15 was amended to delete references to a case being dismissed upon termination of the informal adjustment process because the case has never actually begun. .
