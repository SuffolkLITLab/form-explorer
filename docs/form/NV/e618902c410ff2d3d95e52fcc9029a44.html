I  did  not  notify  the  following  relatives  about  the  temporary  guardianship  because

39. 

I understand that if I am appointed a temporary guardian: 

  The  court  will  set  a  hearing  within  10  days  to  decide  whether  to  extend  the 

temporary guardianship. 

 

I  will  have  to  attempt  in  good  faith  to  notify  the  child’s  relatives  and  any  other 

required  person  of  the  temporary  guardianship  and  the  hearing  to  extend  the 

temporary guardianship.  If I do not, the court can terminate the guardianship. 

  The  court  can  extend  the  temporary  guardianship  only  if  there  is  clear  and 

convincing evidence that the child still needs a temporary guardian.  If extended, 

the guardianship usually can only be extended for two 60-day periods.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
