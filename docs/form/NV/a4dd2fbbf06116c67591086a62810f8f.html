MOTION 

(Your  name)  _________________________________,  moves  this  Court  for  an  Order 

granting permission to relocate to another state with a minor child. 

POINTS AND AUTHORITIES 
LEGAL ARGUMENT 
 

A parent must obtain court permission or the other parent’s written consent before 

relocating with a child outside of Nevada or to a place within Nevada that would substantially 

impair the other parent’s ability to maintain a meaningful relationship with the child.  When a 

parent with joint physical custody of a child wishes to relocate with the child, the parent must 

also petition for primary physical custody for the purposes of relocating.  NRS 125C.006; NRS 

125C.0065.  Child custody may be modified only when “(1) there has been a substantial change 

in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child, and (2) the modification would serve the 

child's best interest.”  Romano v Romano, 138 Nev. Adv. Op. 1 (2022). 

The relocating parent must prove to the court that the parent has a sensible, good-faith 

reason for the move that is not intended to deprive the other parent of his or her parenting time.  

The relocating parent must also prove that the move would be in the best interest of the child, 

and that the child and parent would both benefit from an actual advantage if allowed to move.  

NRS 125C.007(1). 

In considering the parent’s request to relocate, the Court must weigh various factors, 

including: 1) the motives of the relocating parent; 2) the motives of the non-relocating parent; 3) 

the extent to which the relocation would improve the quality of life for the child and parent; 4) 

whether the relocating parent will comply with substitute visitation orders; 5) whether there is a 

realistic alternate visitation schedule that will adequately foster and preserve the relationship 

between the child and the non-relocating parent; and 6) any other factor.   NRS 125C.007(2). 

In determining the best interest of the child, the court shall consider: a) The wishes of the child if 

the child is of sufficient age and capacity to form an intelligent preference as to his or her 

custody; b)  Any nomination of a guardian for the child by a parent; c)  Which parent is more 

   

 

 

 

       

 

Page 2 of 9 – Motion for Permission to Relocate 

likely to allow the child to have frequent associations and a continuing relationship with the 

noncustodial parent; d)  The level of conflict between the parents; e)  The ability of the parents to 

cooperate to meet the needs of the child; f)  The mental and physical health of the parents; g) 

The physical, developmental and emotional needs of the child; h)  The nature of the relationship 

of the child with each parent; i)  The ability of the child to maintain a relationship with any 

sibling; j)  Any history of parental abuse or neglect of the child or a sibling of the child; k) 

Whether either parent or any other person seeking custody has engaged in an act of domestic 

violence against the child, a parent of the child or any other person residing with the child; and l) 

Whether either parent or any other person seeking custody has committed any act of abduction 

against the child or any other child.  NRS 125C.0035. 

The court shall also determine or modify child support under NRS Chapter 125B and/or 

in accordance with the guidelines established by  the Administrator of the Division of Welfare 

and Supportive Services pursuant to NRS 425.620.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
