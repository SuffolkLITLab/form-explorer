I understand that if I am appointed a temporary guardian: 

  The  court  will  set  a  hearing  within  10  days  to  decide  whether  to  extend  the 

temporary guardianship. 

 

I  will  have  to  attempt  in  good  faith  to  notify  the  adult’s  relatives  and  any  other 

required  person  of  the  temporary  guardianship  and  the  hearing  to  extend  the 

temporary guardianship.  If I do not, the court can terminate the guardianship. 

  The  court  can  extend  the  temporary  guardianship  only  if  there  is  clear  and 

convincing evidence that the adult still needs a temporary guardian.  If extended, 

the guardianship usually can only be extended for two 60-day periods.  

36.  Certificate of Incapacity must be filed showing the need for a guardianship over the 

proposed protected person. For a temporary guardianship, the certificate must show that the 

proposed protected person faces an immediate and substantial risk of physical or financial 

harm, or needs immediate medical attention, and is unable to respond to the risk of harm or 

obtain the medical care.  The certificate must be completed and signed by one of the 

following: 

  A  physician  who  is  licensed  to  practice  medicine  in  this  State  or  who  is 

employed by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs; 

  A governmental agency in this State which conducts investigations; or 
  Any other person whom the court finds qualified to execute a certificate. 

37.  Confidential Information Sheet – Guardianship must be completed and filed. You must 

provide at least one form of identification (listed on the sheet) for each person. 

38.  Plan of Care must be completed and filed within 60 days of being appointed the guardian.

petition if you are requesting guardianship over the adult’s estate.  If you are appointed the 

Guardian, the Court will determine how to safeguard the protected person’s funds.  The 

Court will decide whether to: 

  Require the funds to be placed into a blocked account.   

  Require you to obtain a bond in an amount equal to the total amount of the 

proposed protected person’s liquid assets. 

42.  Attach any other documentation that supports your request for guardianship.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
