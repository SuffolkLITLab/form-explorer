When determining physical custody of a child, the sole consideration of the court is the 

best  interest  of  the  minor  child.    In  determining  the  best  interest  of  the  child,  the  court  shall 

consider:  a)  The  wishes  of  the  child  if  the  child  is  of  sufficient  age  and  capacity  to  form  an 

intelligent preference as to his or her custody; b) Any nomination of a guardian for the child by 

a parent; c) Which parent is more likely to allow the child to have frequent associations and a 

continuing  relationship  with  the  noncustodial  parent;  d) The  level  of  conflict  between  the 

parents; e) The ability of the parents to cooperate to meet the needs of the child; f) The mental 

and physical health of the parents; g) The physical, developmental and emotional needs of the 

child; h) The nature of the relationship of the child with each parent; i) The ability of the child 

to maintain a relationship with  any  sibling; j) Any  history of parental  abuse or neglect  of the 

child or a sibling of the child; k) Whether either parent or any other person seeking custody has 

engaged  in  an  act  of  domestic  violence  against  the  child,  a  parent  of  the  child  or  any  other 

person residing with the child; and l) Whether either parent or any other person seeking custody 

has committed any act of abduction against the child or any other child.  NRS 125C.0035. 

 

There  is  a  preference  that  joint  physical  custody  would  be  in  the  best  interest  of  the 

child  if:  1)  the  parents  have  so  agreed;  or  2)  a  parent  has  demonstrated,  or  attempted  to 

demonstrate  but  had  his  or  her  efforts  frustrated  by  the  other  parent,  an  intent  to  establish  a 

meaningful relationship with the child.  A court may award one parent primary physical custody 

if  it  determines  that  joint  physical  custody  is  not  in  the  best  interest  of  the  child.    NRS 

125C.0025. 

The court shall also determine child support under NRS 125B.080 and/or in accordance 

with the guidelines established by the Administrator of the Division of Welfare and Supportive 

Services pursuant to NRS 425.620. 

 

In  a  pending  divorce  case,  the  court  may  order  one  spouse  to  pay  temporary  spousal 

support  to  the  other  spouse.    NRS  125.040.    The  court  may  also  make  orders  affecting  the 

property  of  the  parties,  including  awarding  one  spouse  temporary  exclusive  possession  of  the 

community residence.  NRS 125.040.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
