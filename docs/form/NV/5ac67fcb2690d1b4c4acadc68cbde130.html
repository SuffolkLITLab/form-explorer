I understand that if I am appointed a temporary guardian:

temporary guardianship.

required  person  of  the  temporary  guardianship  and  the  hearing  to  extend  the 

temporary guardianship.  If I do not, the court can terminate the guardianship. 

  The  court  can  extend  the  temporary  guardianship  only  if  there  is  clear  and 

convincing evidence that the child still needs a temporary  guardian.  If extended, 

the guardianship usually can only be extended for two 60-day periods.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
