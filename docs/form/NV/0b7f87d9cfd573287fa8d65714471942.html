NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that pursuant to NRS 125C.0045(6): 
PENALTY FOR VIOLATION OF ORDER: THE ABDUCTION, CONCEALMENT OR 
DETENTION OF A CHILD IN VIOLATION OF THIS ORDER IS PUNISHABLE AS A 
CATEGORY D FELONY AS PROVIDED IN NRS 193.130. NRS 200.359 provides that

every person having a limited right of custody to a child or any parent having no right of 
custody to the child who willfully detains, conceals or removes the child from a parent, 
guardian or other person having lawful custody or a right of visitation of the child in 
violation of an order of this court, or removes the child from the jurisdiction of the court 
without the consent of either the court or all persons who have the right to custody or 
visitation is subject to being punished for a category D felony as provided in NRS 193.130. 

OTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that pursuant to NRS 125C.0045(7)(8):  

The terms of the Hague Convention of October 25, 1980, adopted by the 14th Session of 
the Hague Conference on Private International Law, apply if a parent abducts or wrongfully 
retains a child in a foreign country as follows:  

If a parent of the child lives in a foreign country or has significant commitments in a 

(b) Upon motion of one of the parties, the court may order the parent to post a bond if 

foreign country: 
 
(a) The parties may agree, and the court shall include in the order for custody of the 
child, that the United States is the country of habitual residence of the child for the purposes 
of applying the terms of the Hague Convention as set forth in subsection 7. 
 
the court determines that the parent poses an imminent risk of wrongfully removing or 
concealing the child outside the country of habitual residence.  The bond must be in an 
amount determined by the court and may be used only to pay for the cost of locating the 
child and returning the child to his or her habitual residence if the child is wrongfully 
removed from or concealed outside the country of habitual residence.  The fact that a parent 
has significant commitments in a foreign country does not create a presumption that the 
parent poses an imminent risk of wrongfully removing or concealing the child. 
 

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that the parties are subject to the relocation requirements 
of NRS 125C.006 & NRS 125C.0065. If joint or primary physical custody has been established 
pursuant to an order, judgment or decree of a court and one parent intends to relocate his or her 
residence to a place outside of this State or to a place within this State that is at such a distance 
that would substantially impair the ability of the other parent to maintain a meaningful 
relationship with the child, and the relocating parent desires to take the child with him or her, 
the relocating parent shall, before relocating: (a) attempt to obtain the written consent of the 
non-relocating parent to relocate with the child; and (b) if the non-relocating parent refuses to 
give that consent, petition the court for permission to move and/or for primary physical custody 
for the purpose of relocating.  A parent who desires to relocate with a child has the burden of 
proving that relocating with the child is in the best interest of the child. The court may award 
reasonable attorney's fees and costs to the relocating parent if the court finds that the non-
relocating parent refused to consent to the relocating parent's relocation with the child without 
having reasonable grounds for such refusal, or for the purpose of harassing the relocating 
parent. A parent who relocates with a child pursuant to this section without the written consent 
of the other parent or the permission of the court is subject to the provisions of NRS 200.359. 

OTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that pursuant to NRS 125C.010(1)(b), for purposes of 
visitation rights of a child, the State of Nevada or the state where the child resides within the 
United States of America is the habitual residence of the child.

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that the parent having the child support obligation is 

subject to NAC 425.025 and NRS 31A.010 through 31A.350, inclusive, regarding the 
immediate withholding or assignment of wages, commissions or bonuses for payment of child 
support, whether current or delinquent. 

OTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that pursuant to NRS 125B.145 and NAC 425.170, either 

party may request that the Court review the child support obligation every three years or upon 
changed circumstances. 

OTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that pursuant to NAC 425.165 and NRS 425.620, if the 
order pertains to more than one child and does not allocate a specific amount of the total child 
support obligation to each child, and if you want to adjust the amount of child support 
established in this order, you MUST file a motion to modify the order with or submit a 
stipulation to the court. If a motion to modify the order is not filed or a stipulation is not 
submitted, the child support obligation established in this order will continue until such time as 
all children who are the subject of this order reach 18 years of age or, if the youngest child who 
is subject to this order is still in high school when he or she reaches 18 years of age, when the 
child graduates from high school or reaches 19 years of age, whichever comes first. Unless the 
parties agree otherwise in a stipulation, any modification made pursuant to a motion to modify 
the order will be effective as of the date the motion was filed. 

OTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that each party shall submit the information required in 
NRS 125B.055, NRS 125.130, and 125.230 on a separate form to the Court and the Welfare 
Division of the Department of Human Resources within ten days from the date this Decree is 
filed. Such information shall be maintained by the Clerk in a confidential manner and not part 
of the public record. The parties shall update the information filed with the Court and the 
Welfare Division of the Department of Human Resources within ten days should any of that 
information become inaccurate.
