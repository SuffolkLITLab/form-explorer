“This disease turned our lives upside down. Alzheimer’s is not just impacting me, but 
also my husband, our children and their kids. It’s robbed me of my livelihood, my 
independence, and certainly, my memories.” 

 
hat is how a South Dakotan living with Alzheimer’s described the effects of this disease on a 
person, family and community. It is a stark example of the need for a statewide call to action. 

he numbers are staggering. In South Dakota alone, 17,000 people are living with an 
Alzheimer’s diagnosis. More than 38,000 people are serving as their unpaid caregivers.  South 
Dakota has the third highest death rate in America due to Alzheimer’s. But the numbers do not 
tell the whole story. Across South Dakota, families are struggling with the stress of caring for 
loved ones who are experiencing the debilitating effects of Alzheimer’s and other diseases that 
cause dementia. In addition, it impacts friends, neighbors and communities in ways that cannot 
be underestimated. 

o address this issue, a voluntary group of stakeholders – health care professionals, state 
agency officials, legal and financial experts, professional care providers and family caregivers – 
came together to form the South Dakota Alzheimer’s Disease and Other Dementias Work 
Group. Over the ensuing months, this group collected and analyzed data through a statewide 
needs assessment, held 15 town hall discussions, conducted research, and examined best 
practices in dementia care. This thorough evaluation by the Work Group culminated in the 
recognition of priority areas and development of action steps to prepare South Dakota to meet 
the immediate and future needs of people affected by these devastating diseases. 

outh Dakota’s State Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease and Other Dementias identifies six 
major areas that address the needs of individuals and families impacted by these diseases. The 
Work Group has also identified key partners necessary to assure success in achieving the goals 
outlined in this Plan. Collaboration and support from elected officials and state agencies will be 
critical to the Plan’s success. 

e acknowledge this Plan represents a “living document” that will evolve as our progress and 
further understanding of the disease also evolve. We invite you to read the Plan and consider 
how your contribution could help improve the lives of South Dakotans impacted by 
Alzheimer’s/dementia today, and in the future.

STATE PLAN OVERVIEW 

are for Alzheimer’s disease and Other Dementias (AD) is not what it needs to be nor 

everywhere it needs to be in South Dakota for people with dementia (PWD) and their family 
caregivers. Through the recently conducted, comprehensive statewide needs assessment, it 
was determined that services and resources are inadequate or missing throughout the state. 
Where services and resources do exist, they are constrained by high costs, insufficient 
workforce numbers, a lack of dementia-specific training, and a debilitating and limiting stigma. 
Needs assessment participants did not see this as a reality unique to South Dakota, but as a 
struggle throughout the country. 

hese same participants were encouraged to learn that other states have taken the initiative to 
improve the care of PWD through state Alzheimer’s plans. Participants believe creating a plan 
to meet the needs of South Dakotans connected to AD, while long overdue, is the right next 
step. They do not claim to have all the solutions but do share many common recommendations 
for improving the state of AD care in South Dakota based on the breadth and depth of their 
collective experience. They see the state plan as a road map and convener of influence, 
advocacy, and action. 

he South Dakota AD State Plan Work Group cited participant stories, recommendations, and 
hope for the future to develop six vetted goal topics accompanied by recommendations and 
rationale. Their work resulted in actionable items that merge needs assessment data with 
tactical knowledge on how to accomplish the work in the most efficient and impactful way. The 
Work Group recognizes that developing the state plan is just the first step, but a transformative 
first step that has the potential to positively change thousands of lives across the state.  

o assure the plan is implemented, monitored, measured, and sufficiently funded, the Work 
Group will work with state officials to establish the South Dakota Alzheimer’s State Plan Task 
Force. This task force will be responsible for overseeing state plan implementation and update 
efforts and will serve as a liaison to stakeholders and partners. The State Plan does not presume 
to address all aspects of an issue as broad and complex as AD. As benchmarks are reached and 
the content evolves, the task force will be responsible for assuring the work does not become 
stagnant, and that progress toward improving the lives of those living with and amongst AD is 
continuously being sought, either through a revised plan, new plan, or continued monitoring of 
implemented actions.  

ork has already begun to address the needs and build upon the assets that surfaced during 

the needs assessment. The most important measure to be taken in the next six months to 
assure the proposed work is accomplished, is to have the South Dakota legislature approve this 
state plan. Their approval will bring to light the critical needs of this underserved population.

South Dakota is one of four states without an AD state plan. Need for a state plan was 
identified in 2014 by a group of Alzheimer’s advocates. State plans have typically been pursued 
in one of three ways: through grassroots efforts, as directive from the governor to the state 
agency, or through a legislative mandate. 

hen stakeholders met with Department of Health officials in 2014, it was determined that an 

AD state plan would best be founded through a grassroots effort with the establishment of a 
formal work group and guidance from the Alzheimer’s Association’s South Dakota Chapter. 

rocess objectives: 

1.  Formalize the South Dakota AD State Plan Work Group. 

2.  Conduct a statewide needs assessment. 

3.  Create a comprehensive needs assessment report to enlighten the development of a 

4.  Develop South Dakota’s first state plan to address Alzheimer’s Disease and Other 

 

 

 

state plan. 

Dementias. 

BJECTIVE 1: FORMALIZE THE SOUTH DAKOTA AD STATE PLAN WORK GROUP. 

The South Dakota AD State Plan Work Group was established in 2015 with an Executive 
Committee and expanded to a larger group of stakeholders that began to formally convene in 
April 2017. The voluntary Work Group was comprised of 26 individuals determined to create a 
state plan that will work to meet needs, fill gaps in resources and services, and improve the 
overall quality of AD care in South Dakota for individuals living with the disease and their 
caregivers. 

riteria for work group selection included proximity to and experience with AD, degree of 

influence and/or expertise in the field, and commitment to seeing the work through. The Work 
Group met four times between April 2017 and February 2018. Members were tasked with 
contributing their experience with and perspective of AD, reviewing and approving 
methodology and materials, and ultimately engaging in state plan development under close 
guidance of the South Dakota AD needs assessment. 

ork group members represent health care providers and administrators, advocacy 

organizations, state agencies, and family caregivers. 

BJECTIVE 2: CONDUCT A STATEWIDE NEEDS ASSESSMENT. 

Comprehensive needs assessments are at the core of a state’s ability to effectively use 
information to develop, implement, and maintain state plans. The data gathered and presented 
is specifically related to AD in South Dakota, making for a focused data set to inform action and 
policy.

Planning: 
During the planning phase, the Work Group set priorities and goals to assure the needs 
assessment would be a representative snapshot of AD in South Dakota. The Work Group sought 
to gather and present information that would bring about new findings, update existing ones, 
and confirm “what we know to be true.” They were also interested in finding out what potential 
solutions would work best for South Dakota. 

he following priorities and goals guided needs assessment development: 

▪  Current availability, accessibility, affordability, and quality of services and resources. 
▪  What availability, accessibility, affordability, and quality should look like. 
▪  Gauge awareness of AD at all levels, including any stigma associated with AD. 
▪  The adequacy of education and training available for anyone associate with AD. 
▪  How AD is experienced by those living with it or working with it, and how that 

experience can be improved. 

he Alzheimer’s Association Needs Assessment Toolkit and existing AD state plans outside of 
South Dakota were also referenced during planning. 

ethodology: 

The needs assessment is based on a mixed-methods approach comprised of three key inputs: 

1.  Focus groups facilitated throughout South Dakota. 
2.  Online statewide needs assessment survey. 
3.  Secondary data collection and analysis. 

nput 1 |Statewide focus groups 
Focus groups sites were mapped out to be inclusive of both the urban and rural experience of 
South Dakota residents. The state’s population of nearly 860,000 was divided into five regions 
based on its 35 legislative districts. Each region represented between six and eight districts and 
between 120,000 and 200,000 people. The regions were also constructed with points of 
common experience in mind, such as urban vs. rural and proximity to major health care 
institutions. Three focus groups were held in each region, totaling 15 focus groups in 13 cities 
and towns. 

 purposive sample was sought by creating invitation materials—flyers, ads, and news 
releases— that explicitly stated what the focus groups aimed to do and who the ideal 
participant would be. A connection to AD, either personal or professional, was set as a 
condition of participation. An outreach strategy was created to ensure the invitations reached 
as many ideal participants as possible through established media resources and direct outreach 
by work group members. South Dakota legislators were invited via letter. 

he 90-minute focus groups were held on weekdays either over the lunch hour or early evening 
to accommodate participant schedules. A light meal was offered to thank participants for their 
time. Registration was capped at 20 for each session.

Focus groups were purposed with collecting firsthand accounts of what AD looks like in South 
Dakota. A set of 12 questions was developed to gather the stories and emotions that would 
make for a compelling case for statewide attention and action. Participants were asked to 
identify their needs and barriers, share their definitions of support and quality, and share their 
recommendations for improving the care of someone living in South Dakota with AD. A total of 
147 South Dakota residents attended a focus group. 

nput 2 | Statewide needs assessment survey 
An online statewide needs assessment survey was designed to a) complement the qualitative 
data of the focus groups; and b) reach a larger segment of the state’s population. Sampling 
methods included purposive and convenience techniques. A purposive survey sample was 
sought by putting the survey in front of individuals with an established connection to AD either 
through the Alzheimer’s Association’s South Dakota Chapter or through the professional and 
personal networks of work group members. All focus group participants were encouraged to 
complete the survey. The survey was available via an online link or paper copy. 

onvenience sampling took place through the circulation of paper surveys to places that those 

touched by AD might frequent, such as support groups, church groups, and rural health care 
clinics. 

he 17-question survey included open-ended and closed-ended questions. Respondents were 
asked to identify the three most pressing needs of persons impacted by AD in South Dakota, 
rate the quality of AD care, and share their recommendations for improving care. In total, 1,025 
South Dakota residents completed the needs assessment survey. 

nput 3 | Secondary data collection and analysis 
Secondary data provided an analysis of indicators for South Dakota, including population 
projections, social and economic factors, prevalence, health care workforce, and caregiving. An 
inventory of long-term care providers in South Dakota was included. Additional data sources 
were contributed to help frame the report. All data was housed in a database with the intent 
for it to be updated and used to support the state plan ongoing. 

pecial contribution: 
Work group member James Barker, M.D. sought to include underserved populations in the 
study. He designed a questionnaire that involved five basic questions about AD and 
administered it verbally to 20 people at the Bishop Dudley Hospitality House. From their 
responses, he provided the following generalizations: 

1.  Most of them knew someone who had some form of AD. 
2.  No one had been a personal caregiver for anyone with AD, though they knew caregivers 

or had relatives who had been caregivers. 

3.  They did not know of the related problems in the caregiver’s position. 
4.  They did not have suggestions for how state or local services could have made the 

situation better.

Dr. Barker concluded with acknowledging individuals without a place to sleep or roof over their 
heads are often not selected to be caregivers and are unlikely to think of organized system 
solutions that can help their friends or family. 

ith that said, he believes that the recommendations of the state plan will help these 

individuals and their family members who may now, or in the future, suffer from AD and need 
the coordinated and high quality of state services that will be advocated in the plan. 

imitations: 
The distribution strategy for the statewide needs assessment survey was intended to reach as 
many individuals who have a connection with AD as possible. The sample relied heavily on the 
distribution channels made available by work group members. Less than 2% of the 1,025 survey 
respondents reported being Native American or American Indian while the U.S. Census 
estimates 9% of South Dakota’s population was Native American in 2017. In an attempt to 
make findings more representative of the state’s demographics, an additional survey was 
designed to gather data from South Dakota’s American Indian population. 

his survey was intended to gather information and perspective on needs relating to the 
experience and care of PWD in South Dakota who identify as American Indian, either in an 
urban or tribal setting. It was sent out to work group member networks, organizations who 
work with the American Indian population, and tribal representatives. While criteria for survey 
respondents was articulated, only 11 of the 71 survey respondents reported being Native 
American or American Indian. The 11 respondents were somewhat to not familiar with what is 
available for AD care in South Dakota and identified the availability of services and resources as 
a pressing need. These limited findings were not admissible into the study’s findings. 

fter consulting with those well-versed in tribal community study inclusion, it was determined 
that the timeline did not allow for a revised inclusion strategy prior to state plan publication. A 
more formalized approach will be pursued at a later date, after which findings will be published 
and an action plan will be developed. 

BJECTIVE 3: CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY REPORT TO ENLIGHTEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A 

STATE PLAN. 
Maximizing Excellence, LLC (MELLC) developed survey and focus group content as well as 
accompanying distribution materials based on work group direction and feedback. MELLC 
conducted the statewide needs assessment survey and facilitated fifteen focus groups 
throughout the state. SLM Consulting, LLC collected and analyzed secondary data to support 
primary data findings. MELLC merged the three data sets to create a comprehensive statewide 
needs assessment report. The Work Group provided technical support throughout the process 
and were the recipients of the report.

OBJECTIVE 4: DEVELOP SOUTH DAKOTA’S FIRST STATE PLAN TO ADDRESS ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE AND 
OTHER DEMENTIAS. 
Upon completion and review of the needs assessment report, the Work Group added five 
additional members to assist with the development of state plan content. These members were 
selected for their subject matter and policy expertise.  

ix subcommittees were established to translate needs assessment findings into goals with 
supporting rationale and recommendations.  

▪  Public Awareness. 
▪  Access to Care. 
▪  Family Caregivers. 
▪  Training and Workforce Development. 
▪  Safety and Legal Issues. 
▪  Research and Data Collection. 

ll subcommittees created their own action plan, which were then reviewed by the full group 

for insertion in the state plan. The Work Group conducted a final review of the state plan 
document and granted approval for publication in December 2018.

STATEWIDE NEEDS ASSESSMENT: FINDINGS SUMMARY 

,172 South Dakota residents provided input on the state of AD care in South Dakota either by 

completing a survey or attending one of the fifteen focus groups held statewide. These 
individuals represent the full spectrum of how AD is experienced, from family caregivers to 
professional caregivers and from individuals living with the disease to those who have 
experienced firsthand the loss of a loved one to the disease. While each story was unique, there 
were five points of common experience and need. These points constitute the five key needs 
assessment findings that collectively detail a story of struggle and frustration experienced 
around AD care in South Dakota.  

IVE KEY NEEDS ASSESSMENT FINDINGS: 

1.  There is a need to increase the availability of quality services and resources to PWD and 

their caregivers in rural and urban settings. 

.  AD services and resources need to be more affordable for facilities to provide and for 

families to access. 

.  The current and projected South Dakota workforce needs to be adequately sized and 

skilled to meet the demand for care. 

.  Professional care providers and family caregivers need education, training, and 
emotional support to improve care quality and administrative efficiencies. 

.  South Dakota needs to reframe how AD is understood, perceived, and cared for 
throughout the state to reduce stigma and improve the quality of life a PWD 
experienced. 

ee pages 30-45 for an in-depth look at the five key findings from the needs assessment. 

Participants provided the following advice to anyone and everyone responsible for seeing 
through what they identified as important and necessary for South Dakota. 

▪  Make it a community effort. Incorporate and address the challenges of professions 

impacted by AD and then identify how they can all contribute. 
 

▪  Mindset is important. Consider what you would like to see for your own family. What do 

you want available when AD comes to your home? 
 

▪  Stay engaged and follow up with all the entities around the state because things can 

change quickly; (must be able to adapt). 
 

▪  Read the statewide needs assessment study! 

▪  Create an advisory committee that is assigned with manageable, incremental goals and 

held accountable to meaningful progress.

STATEWIDE NEEDS ASSESSMENT: IDENTIFIED REALITIES 

AD SERVICES AND RESOURCES ARE INADEQUATE OR MISSING THROUGHOUT SOUTH DAKOTA. 

▪  South Dakota’s moratorium on nursing home beds does not allow nursing home 

facilities to consolidate or add more beds in sites that have already met their quota. The 
moratorium prohibits adding beds where they are most needed, limiting PWD options. 

▪  Assisted living and nursing homes with memory care units exist, but not on the scale 

needed to meet growing demand. Many PWD have had to relocate to access memory 
care or settle with non-specialized care in their area. 

Memory Care or Alzheimer’s Special Care Unit (SCU): SCUs are designed to 
meet the specific needs of individuals with Alzheimer’s and other dementias. 
SCUs can take many forms and exist within various types of residential care. 
Including assisted living facilities, and they may or may not be locked or secure 
units. Such units most often cluster settings in which persons with dementia 
are grouped on a floor or a unit within a larger residential care facility. 
 

▪  Limited services and resources exist to care for higher-acuity PWD. Behavioral health 

and crisis intervention is virtually nonexistent. The only option for many participants is 
the Human Services Center (HSC) in Yankton. Also, many long-term care facilities evict 
or do not accept these high-acuity PWD, leaving families with few options. 

▪  Access to services and resources is significantly compromised for PWD in rural and small 
communities. Getting connected with primary care, specialty services, transportation, 
in-home care, care facilities, caregiver support, funding, and education was reported as 
difficult and discouraging. 

▪  AD caregivers cannot find the respite care, support groups, education, training, and 

continuous guidance they need to navigate their journey with the disease to the best of 
their ability. This was reported as a barrier for family members trying to access the 
appropriate level of care to keep their loved one at home longer and maintain their 
quality of life. Caregivers consistently reported not knowing where to go or how to 
access care and support. 

▪  Mandatory and/or standardized AD education and training is not in place for 

professional caregivers. Professional caregivers, and those that employ them, raised 
concern at their competency to meet the needs of patients and families. Family 
members shared many accounts of professional caregivers mishandling cases, 
attributing it in part to lack of dementia-specific training. They also shared that having 
trust in the ability, knowledge, and quality of their care providers is of great value (and 
concern) to them. 

▪  Training and education is not prioritized amongst indirect care professionals, including 

financial and legal advisors, police, and emergency medical technicians (EMTs). Without 
this expertise in place, decisions are often not made in the best interest of the PWD and 
their family.

WHERE AD SERVICES AND RESOURCES EXIST, THEY ARE CONSTRAINED BY HIGH COSTS, INSUFFICIENT 
WORKFORCE NUMBERS, A LACK OF DEMENTIA-SPECIFIC TRAINING, AND DEBILITATING STIGMA. 

▪  Memory care is more expensive for facilities to provide, and for a family to afford, than 
standard nursing care. Participants reported being forced to place their loved ones in 
long-term care facilities regardless of memory care needs due to affordability and a 
Medicaid reimbursement rate that works against having memory care as a viable 
option. Most memory care is private pay, which creates a financial barrier for many 
PWD. For some participants, their only viable option was to spend down their assets to 
qualify for Medicaid. 

▪  Long-term care facilities that offer memory care are not required to accept Medicaid 
residents. Participants have found that these facilities typically limit the number of 
Medicaid patients they accept. The Medicaid reimbursement rate for long-term care 
facilities, especially small facilities, offers a low return for memory care and does not 
account for the heightened costs associated with providing memory care, including a 
lower staff to resident ratio, continuing education for staff, a non-mixed population, and 
increased security. 

▪  PWD are often placed in settings that are ill-equipped for higher-needs/acuity residents 
due to personal reluctance to seek a diagnosis, delay of accurate diagnoses, and lack of 
knowledge on how to navigate services and resources for PWD. Assisted living facilities 
and home health agencies are often found too late in disease progression, prompting 
concern as to the quality of care such entities can provide to residents with dementia. 

▪  There are not enough direct care workers for AD service and resource providers to 
adequately staff their operations. Difficulty in finding and retaining qualified staff—
above and beyond quantity—compounds the issue. Participants think a shortage of 
health care professionals, and the noncompetitive pay scale of CNAs, are at the heart of 
the issue. 

▪  The training and education that exists does not adequately prepare care providers. This 
includes the baseline of what AD is, to the more complex—handling behaviors, crisis 
response, medication management, and therapies. Participants see provider proficiency 
on these topics leading to better coordination amongst services, more consistent 
quality, and overall improvement in how AD is approached in health care. 

▪  Participants reported that being a family caregiver often creates financial, emotional, 
and physical stress. 77% of survey respondents were somewhat or not familiar with 
available services and resources, and no primary point of access for information or 
referrals was identified. Access to adult day services and home health to ease such 
stressors are limited by few available options, and caps on the number of hours a 
caregiver can receive financial assistance to utilize the service. Caregiver support groups 
are hard to keep active in small communities. 

▪  AD are met with significant stigma throughout South Dakota. It is not a topic people are 
comfortable talking about or seeing, and therefore participants have seen PWD pushed 
to the periphery of society. It was reported that stigma stops people from accessing 
care, seeking support, and discourages PWD and their caregivers from staying engaged 
in community life.

POINTS OF PROGRESS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED: 

▪  The value of memory care on a PWD’s quality of life is being more widely accepted and 

▪  Trained professional caregivers have increasingly demonstrated a person and family-
centered care approach, treating PWD with dignity, spending one-on-one time with 
them, and incorporating personalized activities and family suggestions into care plans. 
 

▪  Churches and faith circles have been reliable sources of support and community 

 

endorsed. 
 

engagement. 
 

▪  The Alzheimer’s Association’s South Dakota Chapter is the most visible advocate for 

PWD and their caregivers and is where participants reported going first for information. 
 

▪  Participants rated the quality of AD care as good for hospice care, home health care 
services, adult day services, primary care involvement, non-physician health care 
professionals, auxiliary services, long-term care facilities, and community initiatives.

SOUTH DAKOTA AD STATE PLAN GOALS, 
RECOMMENDATIONS, AND RATIONALE 

.  PUBLIC AWARENESS 

Highlight dementia as a public health issue and raise public awareness and understanding 
about Alzheimer’s and other dementias throughout South Dakota. This includes educating 
the public and family and professional care providers about the importance of early 
detection and diagnosis, dementia risk factors and lifestyle interventions, and care 
resources available in the state. 

.  ACCESS TO CARE 

Ensure that people living with dementia have access to affordable care in all areas of South 
Dakota including home and community-based services, residential care facilities, and end-
of-life care settings. 

.  FAMILY CAREGIVERS 

Empower and support family caregivers to help people with dementia live in familiar 
settings, cutting costs for families and for the state. Reduce caregiver stress by developing 
and expanding ongoing community resources and enhancing education and training to 
prepare family and volunteer caregivers. Promote the availability of caregiver education and 
support systems in all communities. 

.  TRAINING AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT 

Support the development of an adequately prepared and dementia-capable 
interprofessional workforce, including direct care workers, aides, site administrators, 
nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, physicians, social workers, first responders, 
and other care providers. Dementia training standards should address the knowledge, skills, 
and attitudes necessary to meet the needs of people with dementia and their families in all 
care settings. Increase workforce capacity, particularly in underserved areas, to ensure that 
all parts of South Dakota are covered. 

.  SAFETY AND LEGAL ISSUES 

Implement protocols to preserve the safety and legal rights of people with dementia, and 
the people closest to them. 

.  RESEARCH AND DATA COLLECTION 

Establish data collection efforts that will increase the efficacy of service delivery to people 
with Alzheimer’s or other dementias in South Dakota.

PUBLIC AWARENESS 

OAL STATEMENT: 

Highlight dementia as a public health issue and raise public awareness and understanding 
about Alzheimer’s and other dementias throughout South Dakota. This includes educating the 
public and family and professional care providers about the importance of early detection and 
diagnosis, dementia risk factors and lifestyle interventions, and care resources available in the 
state. 

ECOMMENDATIONS: 

A.  Create a centralized online database of resources related to Alzheimer’s and other 

dementias housed on the Dakota at Home website (dakotaathome.org), formerly known 
as the ADRC. Form a work group to ensure the information is up-to-date and culturally 
appropriate. 

 

B.  Develop a long-term media campaign educating South Dakotans about Alzheimer’s and 
other dementias to reduce stigma and fear. The campaign should include information 
on the benefits of an accurate and early diagnosis, advance health care and financial 
planning, and resources available to those living with the disease and their caregivers. 
This should be spear-headed by the AD State Plan Task Force and accomplished through 
strategic public-private partnerships with the following: 

1.  State legislators and state agency officials. 
2.  Health care providers and organizations. 
3.  Non-traditional partners such as bankers, financial planners, lawyers and 
other private-sector businesses, emergency first responders, and other 
professionals who have contact with individuals with dementia. 

4.  The general public, including individuals at risk and youth. 
5.  Individuals with dementia, their caregivers, and family members. 
6.  Television and radio through earned media. 

 

 

C.  Coordinate culturally-appropriate public awareness campaign efforts with Native 

American communities, Tribal health agencies, and other underserved and minority 
population. 
 

D.  Adopt and publicize the 25 action items from the CDC’s Healthy Brain Initiative 2018-
2023 Road Map (released in October 2018) and the companion Road Map for Indian 
Country, which serves as a guide for public health officials. These action items promote 
brain health, improved care for people with cognitive impairment, and increased 
attention to caregivers. 

E.  Conduct a media campaign to educate the public about available care services, advance 
care directives, and end-of-life planning. Conduct a media campaign targeted towards 
health care professionals to educate them about additional dementia services available 
to their patients and about the CPT® Code 99483.

RATIONALE: 

1.  Respondents to the statewide needs assessment stated that stigma, matched with a 

lack of public awareness and support, can be detrimental to the person with dementia 
and family members.  
 

2.  Respondents expressed the need for a road map to help them navigate the disease.  

3.  Public awareness campaigns provide factual information about Alzheimer’s and 

highlight lifestyle interventions that can reduce the risk of developing the disease.  
 

4.  Early diagnosis offers personal benefits to individuals and caregivers and also decreases 

 

costs.  
 

5.  Dementia is a public health issue because the burden is large, the impact is major, and 

there are ways that public health can intervene. Shining a light on Alzheimer’s and other 
dementias and educating the public about them will inevitably reduce stigma.  
 

6.  Creating a centralized database for information will also ease the burden for South 

Dakota families impacted by this disease.

ACCESS TO CARE 

Ensure that people living with dementia have access to affordable care in all areas of South 
Dakota including home and community-based services, residential care facilities, and end-of-life 
care settings.  

A.  Partner with the state legislature to relieve the financial burden of care for families. 

Consider policies such as a caregiver stipend, tax credits, and grants used to fund care 
performed in the home and community. 
 

B.  Form strategic partnerships with public and private organizations to bring care services 
to low-access areas of South Dakota. Capacity-focused workforce development policies 
could be tailored to incentivize new healthcare professionals to practice in underserved 
regions. 
 

C.  Increase Medicaid reimbursement rates for long-term care facilities offering specialized 
memory services and community-based services, such as adult day centers, provided to 
people living with dementia and their families. 
 

D.  Enact policies that enhance dementia-friendliness and provide specialized memory care 

in long-term care facilities. 
 

E.  Readdress the moratorium on nursing home beds in South Dakota. 

F.  Support policies that expand and fund telehealth capacity in underserved and rural 

G.  Consult with representatives from Native American reservations to learn how to best 

meet the needs of their populations and enact the needed services. Additional guidance 
is available in the CDC’s Healthy Brain Initiative Road Map for Indian Country. 

 

areas. 
 

ATIONALE: 

  R

1.  The financial and emotional costs of caring for people living with Alzheimer’s or another 
dementia are often unduly burdensome for families. Many family caregivers must take 
time off from work or stop working altogether to provide care for their loved one. In 
some cases, residential care can be cost prohibitive. 
 

2.  People with dementia, according to needs assessment participants, feel most 

comfortable in a familiar, homelike setting. 
 

3.  Geographic regions, including Native American reservations, exist within South Dakota 

without access to certain care services.

FAMILY CAREGIVERS 

OAL STATEMENT: 

Empower and support family caregivers to help people with dementia live in familiar settings, 
cutting costs for families and for the state. Reduce caregiver stress by developing and 
expanding ongoing community resources and enhancing education and training to prepare 
family and volunteer caregivers. Promote the availability of caregiver education and support 
systems in all communities. 

ECOMMENDATIONS: 

A.  Provide education, training, and easily accessible information to family caregivers. 

Training should include printed materials, support groups, web-based resources and 
webinars, and in-person education sessions. 
 

B.  Enact policies that reduce the emotional burden on family caregivers, such as grants for 
partially reimbursing the cost of respite care and other home and community-based 
services. 
 

C.  Enlist and educate faith-based communities as resources that can help support families 

living with dementia. Invite faith leaders and parish nurses to applicable training 
opportunities and request their assistance in disseminating information and materials. 
 

D.  Work to develop dementia-friendly public spaces, possibly in coordination with 

community-based services such as adult day centers. 
 

E.  Establish a volunteer structure to provide companionship and help with activities of 

daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. 

ATIONALE: 

  R

1.  Family caregivers require comprehensive and continuous community-based services. 
Caregivers report needing quality care for their loved ones with dementia, emotional 
support, care coordination, and a sense of preparedness for disease progression. Nearly 
half of respondents to the needs assessment identified the need for education and 
training for caregivers and for ongoing guidance that is responsive to individuals, 
reporting that caregivers cannot find the respite care, support groups, education, 
training, and continuous guidance they require. 
 

2.  Community-based support groups are the most effective way to meet family caregivers’ 
ongoing needs. These groups are hard to keep active in small communities and require 
ongoing structure and training, as well as a dynamic membership. In addition to family 
caregivers, support group members would include former caregivers, friends and family 
of caregivers, health and medical personnel, faith-based community leaders, and 
concerned volunteers.

TRAINING AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT 

OAL STATEMENT: 

Support the development of an adequately prepared and dementia-capable interprofessional 
workforce, including direct care workers, aides, site administrators, nurses, nurse practitioners, 
physician assistants, physicians, social workers, first responders, and other care providers. 
Dementia training standards should address the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to 
meet the needs of people with dementia and their families in all care settings. Increase 
workforce capacity, particularly in underserved areas, to ensure that all parts of South Dakota 
are covered. 

ECOMMENDATIONS: 

A.  Advocate and support the inclusion of information on Alzheimer’s and other dementias 
in the training curriculum and continuing education requirements of physicians, nurses, 
and other allied direct care professionals to ensure the implementation of competency-
based dementia training standards. Curriculum development should include 
comprehensive information regarding early detection and diagnosis of cognitive 
impairment, dementia care interventions, management of dementia, person-centered 
care, end-of-life planning, and best practices for communicating with people with 
dementia and their loved ones. 
 

B.  Assess the distance learning capacity in the state as a means to provide competency-
based, dementia-specific education and training for individuals providing direct care 
services to people with dementia (i.e. adult day services, non-medical home care, home 
health care, assisted living, skilled nursing, memory care units, hospital), including family 
caregivers. Create an electronic system of verifying and tracking training progress. 
 

C.  Create and promote opportunities that encourage students and young adults to engage 
in work or volunteer experience with people with dementia to increase interest in 
careers in geriatrics/gerontology. One strategy is partnering with educational 
institutions and large service providers to highlight the benefits of a strong healthcare 
workforce and facilitate discussions about career mobility in the dementia sphere of 
healthcare. 
 

D.  Develop standardized training for professionals who provide indirect care to those with 
dementia, including, but not limited to, financial and legal advisors, law enforcement, 
emergency medical technicians, and fire fighters. 
 

E.  Incentivize advanced education for health care providers, especially in underserved 
areas, who specialize in geriatrics and dementia care, such as loan forgiveness or 
repayment options, stipends, scholarships, and relocation expenses. 

 

 

  G

  R

South Dakota Alzheimer’s Disease and Other Dementias State Plan  

|19 

RATIONALE: 

1.  Needs assessment participants believe that health care professionals at all levels of care 
are often unprepared to address dementia. The survey revealed numerous occasions 
where people with dementia and/or family members were frustrated by delayed 
diagnosis or misdiagnosis, and sensed discomfort on the part of health care 
professionals in providing patient education and disease management information. 
Efforts to enhance the knowledge and skills and alter unhelpful attitudes of practicing 
health care professionals have the most immediate impact upon provision of care for 
people with dementia and their families. 
 

2.  Support distance learning opportunities to overcome time and travel barriers to 

accessing dementia-specific training. 
 

3.  Workforce shortages currently exist. The shortage of available, trained workers will 

continue to increase with the aging of the Baby Boomer cohort. Long-term workforce 
development is essential. The increasing prevalence of dementia will impact the state’s 
ability to meet workforce needs. 
 

4.  Without appropriate training, indirect care providers make decisions that, according to 
needs assessment participants are not in the best interest of people with dementia or 
their families. 
 

5.  Service providers may not have the requisite knowledge to appropriately care for those 

with dementia, lowering quality of care and of life for those patients. 

 

 

South Dakota Alzheimer’s Disease and Other Dementias State Plan

SAFETY AND LEGAL ISSUES 

Implement protocols to preserve the safety and legal rights of people with dementia, and the 
people closest to them. 

A.  Provide educational resources in the form of safety tips and best practices to help family 

and friends protect people with dementia in their homes. 
 

B.  Create a flowchart or other tool to help people with dementia and their families through 

the process of assessing the ability to drive an automobile. 
 

C.  Actively promote awareness among first responders, employers, and the community to 

better recognize people with dementia and promote the use of evidence-based 
techniques to improve communication and interaction, including alternatives to physical 
restraints for first responders. 
 

D.  Establish a standard operating procedure for physicians and clinicians to engage with 

family caregivers through all stages of dementia. 
 

E.  Work with lawmakers and first responders to implement a “Silver Alert” when a person 
has wandered, both as a pedestrian and a driver, establishing dementia-specific criteria. 
 

F.  Implement laws that adopt uniform procedures and support legal documents protecting 
the beliefs, desires, and assets of people with dementia. These documents may include: 
Medical Orders for Scope of Treatment (MOST), Health Care Directives, Living Wills, 
Power of Attorney (POA) and/or guardianship. 
 

G.  Establish a POA registry to protect people with dementia and lessen the burden for 

those holding legitimate legal authority. 
 

H.  Support legal measures to further acknowledge, identify, and prevent abuse, neglect, 

and exploitation of people with dementia.  

People living with Alzheimer’s and other dementias have an increased risk of wandering, abuse, 
neglect, and exploitation, including financial exploitation. Educating families, care facilities, and 
first responders, helps reduce the risk associated with these issues.

RESEARCH AND DATA COLLECTION 

Establish data collection efforts that will increase the efficacy of service delivery to people with 
Alzheimer’s or other dementias in South Dakota.  

OAL STATEMENT: 

ECOMMENDATIONS: 

A.  In order to accurately assess the number of South Dakotans who are currently 

experiencing subjective cognitive decline, Alzheimer’s, or another dementia and identify 
trends among these individuals, the South Dakota Department of Health should 
establish a dementia registry. 
 

B.  Regularly include questions about cognitive health in South Dakota’s annual Behavioral 

Risk Fact Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. 
 

C.  In conjunction and coordination with the South Dakota State Medical Association 

(SDSMA) and the South Dakota Department of Health (SDDOH), amend death certificate 
completion to include information regarding diagnoses of dementia. 
 

D.  In conjunction with the SDSMA, disperse information regarding current national 

registries which may include an Alzheimer’s prevention registry, Alzheimer’s gene Match 
registry, the brain health registry, and Alzheimer’s prevention trials web study. 
 

E.  In conjunction with currently established research programs within the state of South 
Dakota, encourage local involvement in national clinical trials whose focus includes 
research into causation, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of Alzheimer’s and other 
dementias. 
 

F.  Promote access to the Alzheimer’s Association’s Trial Match clinical trial program. 

G.  Encourage a public/private partnership that helps to increase dementia-specific 

 

research funding. 
 

H.  In conjunction with the SDSMA, conduct at least an annual review of current research 

findings that has been peer reviewed for general acceptance and could be incorporated 
into existing workforce training programs. 

ATIONALE: 

1.  Public health efforts in South Dakota can be enhanced through more thorough data 

collection. Collection can be performed in several ways, including the BRFSS survey and 
a dementia registry modeled on existing disease or dementia registries.

2.  The primary cause of death in patients with Alzheimer’s or another dementia is typically 
another condition. Reporting dementia on death certificates in addition to primary 
cause of death enhances understanding of mortality, co-occurring chronic conditions, 
and risk factors related to dementia. 
 

3.  The current federal Omnibus budget recently passed and signed into law includes an 
additional $414 million to a total of $1.8 billion for research for Alzheimer’s and other 
dementias through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) which is a larger increase this 
year than was received by the National Cancer Institute. South Dakota has several 
established clinical research departments within the state that should be encouraged to 
apply for research grants or to become a secondary site for clinical trials involving those 
with Alzheimer’s and other dementias. 
 

4.  Despite the federal government’s encouraging position on the importance of funding 
clinical research into various aspects related to Alzheimer’s and other dementias, it is 
prudent to encourage all willing partners to become involved in the research efforts.

RATIONALE FOR A SOUTH DAKOTA AD PLAN 

his concern is driven in part by being closer to, or more aware of, the impact of AD than the 
average South Dakotan. 76.4% of respondents shared a primary connection of either being a 
son, daughter, or other family member of a person with dementia (PWD) or having worked with 
PWD in a professional capacity. Nearly 65% identified as a family member, friend, or 
professional caregiver to a PWD. 

ersonal concern was scaled to statewide concern when focus group participants defined the 
need for a state plan based on 1) increasing prevalence of AD in South Dakota and 2) increasing 
aging population in South Dakota. 

. INCREASING PREVALENCE OF AD IN SOUTH DAKOTA 
As one participant said, “Everyone is going to be touched by AD in some way.” Participants 
foresee an increase in the amount of AD cases diagnosed annually and with that, an increase in 
the number of people accessing care. Given their perception that AD care is already inadequate 
with the state’s current rate of diagnosis, participants believe that to get ahead of the issue and 
assure care is available for all of those who will come to need it, AD needs to be addressed at 
the state level. 

▪  18,000 South Dakota adults, age 65 or older, are projected to have Alzheimer’s Disease 
in 2020, with a projected number of 20,000 adults to be diagnosed by 2025; resulting in 
a 17.6% increase in prevalence from 2020 to 2025 (Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and 
Figures Report, 2018). 

▪  Alzheimer’s Disease was the fifth leading cause of death among South Dakota adults 
from 2011-2015. It was the third leading cause of death in adults aged 80-89 and the 
second leading cause of death in adults aged 90 and over (South Dakota Department of 
health, Office of Health Statistics, 2015). 

2. INCREASING AGING POPULATION IN SOUTH DAKOTA. 
Participants see South Dakota’s aging population increasing every day as Baby Boomers age. 
They believe South Dakota’s Baby Boomer population—born between 1946 and 1964—will 
only increase in coming years with an increase in transplant retirees attracted to South Dakota 
as a “best place to retire.” As more South Dakotans live longer, participants recognize their 
health care needs will increase. With an increase in the prevalence of AD and an increase in the 
majority age demographic (65+) most likely to be diagnosed with AD, a state plan on AD is 
deemed necessary to “take care of our own.”  

▪  The South Dakota population 45 years of age and older is projected to increase from 
356,306 in 2015 to 435,595 in 2035. Those 65 years of age and older are projected to 
increase from 139,749 in 2015 to 227,225 in 2035 (Department of Sociology and Rural 
Studies, SDSU, 2012). 

▪  Life expectancy in South Dakota is 82 years of age for females and 77.2 for males. From 
1990 to 2016 the population 85 years and older has increased by approximately 7,000 
persons (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 2016).

78.4% of needs assessment survey respondents reported being concerned to very concerned 
about how AD could affect themselves or their loved ones someday.

ONFUSION AND MEMORY LOSS IN SOUTH DAKOTA 

▪  13% of South Dakota adults in hospice had a primary diagnosis of Dementia in 2018. 

(Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures Report, 2018) 
 

▪  6.3% of adults 65 years or older, reported increased confusion or memory loss that is 
happening more often or is getting worse in the preceding 12 months.39.1% of older 
adults 65 years or older, who have experienced increased or memory loss who reported

Needs assessment participants painted a broad picture of all the services and resources 
involved in a PWD’s and their caregiver’s experience across three present but hard to discern 
stages of dementia. An interdisciplinary team leading both parties through a continuum of care 
was desired and seen as best practice. As it stands in South Dakota, many of the services 
displayed are uncoordinated, inconsistent in quality, and lack proper funding.

AN IN-DEPTH LOOK AT THE FIVE KEY FINDINGS 

1.  THERE IS A NEED TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF QUALITY SERVICES AND RESOURCES TO PWD 

AND THEIR CAREGIVERS IN RURAL AND URBAN SETTINGS. 

RURAL AND URBAN SETTINGS 
57% of the population in South Dakota live in urban areas, while 43% of the state’s population 
lives in rural areas. The majority of South Dakota’s 66 counties are designated as rural or 
frontier. (Decennial Census 2010, South Dakota) 

articipants spoke often of the rural-urban divide and the disparity in services and resources 
between the two was articulated when participants were asked to list what is available and 
missing in their community for AD care. The divide was identified as a source of difficulty for 
the state plan to address due to how similar the needs of the two populations are but how 
different service and resource delivery looks like for each. 

ERVICES AND RESOURCES = COMPREHENSIVE CARE 
Improving the care of PWD in South Dakota requires that all residents have access to a 
comprehensive suite of services and resources, ideally presented within a continuum of care 
framework. Participants are not satisfied with the services and resources available to them in 
their area.  

he following reflects how participants define comprehensive care for a PWD: 

▪  Long-term care: 

o  Assisted living, preferably with memory care. 
o  Skilled nursing, preferably with memory care. 
o  Hospice. 
o  Home health care. 
o  Home care. 

“It should be a priority to have 
the right care available to the 
right person at the right time.” 

▪  Health care supports and auxiliary services: 

o  Care providers: primary care, mental and behavioral health, geriatricians, etc. 
o  Access to AD expertise for diagnosis, treatment, and navigation. 

▪  Caregiver supports: 

o  Alzheimer’s Association. 
o  Respite care. 
o  Ombudsman advocate. 
o  Support groups for PWD and caregivers. 
o  Adult day services. 

▪  Community supports:

o  AD-friendly public spaces. 
o  AD-aware representatives from professions that work with PWD and their 

families, including emergency, financial, legal, and retail services.

LONG-TERM CARE IN SOUTH DAKOTA 
According to AARP’s 2017 Long-Term Services and Supports Scorecard, South Dakota needs to 
improve its long-term care options for residents. The national scorecard measures the care 
available in states based on accessibility, choice, and quality. It also assesses their support for 
family caregivers and the transitions between health facilities and home. South Dakota ranks 
32nd overall. The state ranks lowest in the categories of effective transitions and choice of 
setting for care.  

eeds assessment participants rated the quality of long-term care facilities a 3.6, on a scale of 
1-5, with 5 being excellent. Quality could be improved with increased consistency and quality 
assurance among care providers and facilities, and facilities that are designed to respond to the 
unique needs of PWD.  

or many, quality of care is second to what is available. When memory care in a long-term care 
facility is not an option, participants reported having to place PWD in general population 
facilities, which are not designed with AD symptoms in mind. Participants also spoke of 
difficulty in transitioning between care settings. Without a continuum of care guiding these 
transitions and a lack of direction from providers, participants reported PWD staying longer 
than they should in assisted living facilities and not being able to find nursing facilities with 
open memory care beds or general population beds close to home when the time comes. Home 
health was not a common option amongst participants and was not a top recommendation 
given by physicians when discussing care plans with caregivers. 

s stated by the South Dakota Department of Health, the levels of institutional care in South 
Dakota include nursing facilities, assisted living centers, adult foster care homes, residential 
living centers, congregate housing, and home health services. 

Nationally, ADRD is most prevalent among nursing 
home residents (50.4%). 44.7% of hospice residents, 
39.6% of residential living centers, and 31.4% of home 
health have a diagnosis of ADRD. It is least prevalent 
among adult day services center participants (29.9%). 
Over 75% of long-term care facilities do not solely 
serve PWD or offer an ADRD unit.

episodes, with just over 5 episodes per 100 elderly individuals. 

xisting state long-term care capacity was judged insufficient to meet the coming demand, with 
nursing homes needing to be replaced and rebalanced, and assisted-living capacity, home 
health care services, and home and community-based services (HCBS) additionally requiring 
expansion.

HEALTH CARE SUPPORTS AND AUXILIARY SERVICES 
Participants rated the quality of primary care physicians, non-physician health care 
professionals, and auxiliary services as good. However, they rated their satisfaction with 
services and resources available in their area as less than satisfactory and identified having 
more services and resources available as a pressing need for South Dakota. 

isparity in access to health professionals and medical services exists. Shortages are geography 

and income based. 

▪  Across South Dakota’s 66 counties, there are 47 medically underserved areas. 
▪  24.4% of the state’s population lives in a health professional shortage area. 
▪  As of January 2017, South Dakota has 200 health professional shortage areas—87 

primary care and 49 mental health. The rate of primary care physicians per 100,000 
population is 85.3; it is 183 for mental health providers. 

Participants report that limited access to health professionals and medical services negatively 
affect the quality of life a PWD and their caregiver experiences. 

articipants living in underserved and shortage areas reported having to travel more than one 
hour and up to three for initial and follow-up appointments. This frequency of travel is difficult 
to schedule for family caregivers who maintain employment and can agitate a PWD, as they 
thrive with consistency in settings. Even when placed in a residential setting, PWD are not 
guaranteed access to physicians or needed specialists because they often do not provide in-
person or telemedicine consultation to facilities, resulting in required travel. 

t is hard to find the right doctor to diagnose AD in South Dakota. Long wait times to see 
physicians who are generally not well versed in the different types of dementia typically leads 
to a string of referrals, delaying proper diagnosis far past onset and acknowledgement of 
symptoms.

Participants do not think PWD are provided the mental health care they need. Their loved ones 
have been admitted to the Human Services Center because the mental health care available in 
the community or in a residential facility was either nonexistent or ill equipped to manage the 
behavioral health issues of AD. 

ndiagnosed PWD have been sent to jail because first responders do not know how to identify 

the behavioral symptoms of AD. Treatment with medication can take away what was left of 
their family member’s personality. Participants see maltreatment of PWD directly linked to a 
lack of mental health care and an overall lack of proper crisis management—not having Plan B.

CAREGIVER SUPPORTS 
Nearly 65% of needs assessment participants—survey and focus groups—identified with being 
a family or professional caregiver for a PWD. Caregivers see themselves as primarily responsible 
for the wellbeing of PWD, more heavily involved in daily care than physicians, and carrying the 
voice of their loved ones and patients forward. Research supports this perception by asserting 
that family caregivers will provide the majority of hands-on care to PWD and that there is no 
practical alternative to the family caregiving workforce.  

hat family caregiving looks like in South Dakota… 

▪  There are 43 million hours of unpaid care in South Dakota. Unpaid care in South Dakota 

is valued at $4,385 (millions). (Alzheimer’s Facts & Figures Report, 2017) 

▪  Caregivers in South Dakota have higher health care costs at $27 million. (Alzheimer’s 

▪ 

Facts & Figures Report, 2017) 
In 2015, $770,572 was expended for caregiver’s respite care in South Dakota. 
(Administration for Community Living, 2017)  

▪  1 out of 5 needs assessment survey respondents indicated that their full-time 

employment status has been influenced by their caregiver status. 

articipants suggested that what is beneficial for a PWD is beneficial for a caregiver, and vice 
versa, because they are so intrinsically tied to—and dependent upon—each other’s health and 
quality of life. Caregiver support was defined as quality care, emotional support, community 
awareness, care coordination, accessibility, preparedness for disease progression, and crisis-
management plans. Participants stated access to caregiver supports like adult day services and 
support groups can ease caregiver stress and provide cost-savings to families by keeping PWD 
independent and in their homes longer. They defined access to caregiver supports as knowing 
what is available in their community, how to get connected with those supports, and having 
flexible availability. 

What participants said about the benefits of caregiver supports…

Adult Day Services and support groups are typically accessed through long-term care facilities 
and senior centers in South Dakota. It was reported that support groups are difficult to keep 
active in small communities. The state’s LTSS program is seen as a valuable program for 
administration of caregiver support but riddled with limitations on service area and use.

COMMUNITY SUPPORTS 
Participants defined adequate community support with the following statements: 

▪  Adequate services and resources in the community for PWD and caregivers. 
▪  Efforts to do away with the stigma associated with AD. 
▪  Knowledge, resources, and support needed are visibly present, and referrals to 

community supports are made. 

articipants reported being unsatisfied with the community support available for caregivers of 
PWD. They believe the quality of community-based initiatives—such as transportation to access 
health care services and public preparedness to proactively meet the needs of PWD—could be 
improved upon. 

uch of the community support participants have experienced has been through friends and 

family, and close-knit community groups that the PWD was involved in prior to being 
diagnosed. 

ommunity support reported to be already present in some South Dakota communities: 

▪  Ability to take community outings to places that welcome PWD with amenities like 

family restrooms. 

▪  Parish nurses help keep PWD in the home. 
▪  Exposure to community life is dependent upon the family’s willingness to take the 

patient out. Facilities are limited in their capacity to do so. 

▪  Facilities that support continued engagement in an individual’s likes, such as gardening. 
▪  Families come out and support local AD efforts. 
▪  Church groups and coffee groups that welcome their friends with AD. 
▪  The ministerial associations are supportive emotionally and spiritually. 
▪  Meals on Wheels keep AD patients living at home engaged. 
▪  Some non-medical home care providers will take patients out and about. 
▪  Some facilities try to bring as much community life into the walls, like inviting local 

schools to perform.

2.  AD SERVICES AND RESOURCES NEED TO BE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR FACILITIES TO PROVIDE AND 

FOR FAMILIES TO ACCESS. 

Coverage of costs for services and resources was identified as the most pressing need for 
persons in South Dakota impacted by AD. An AD diagnosis affects costs for both facilities and 
individuals.  

or the PWD and their family, the list of costs was described as “overwhelming.” They include 
primary physician and specialist visits, diagnostic tests, respite care, home health care, long-
term facility care, medications, lost wages from caregiving, and even transportation to access 
services. Participants spoke to how expensive everything about AD is and how difficult it can be 
to find affordable yet quality care options. For some, expense becomes their greatest concern 
as the disease progresses and a reason for drastic measures to cover costs, such as selling off 
assets to qualify for long-term care assistance. 

Points of greatest frustration: 

▪  Costs are not well articulated. It is difficult to find information on what costs are covered 

or where to go for financial assistance. 
▪  Strict criteria for financial aid eligibility. 
▪  Adult day, night care, and non-medical home care are often cost prohibitive. 
▪  Adult day and night care are often not covered by insurance and/or financial aid. 
▪  The care options that are affordable are not always the best quality or do not provide 

the level of care PWD needs, i.e., memory care. 

▪  More expensive care does not consistently equal higher quality care. 
▪  Limited options for facility placement due to some not accepting Medicaid. If private 

pay is not an option, families must seek care out of town or out of state. 

or long-term care facilities and home health, costs attached to payroll, staff training, and the 
resources needed to provide the intensive care that PWD require can prevent facilities from 
providing memory care. Low Medicaid reimbursement rates do not incentivize facilities to 
admit Medicaid patients or provide memory care. Participants who work in health care 
administration said it can be hard to keep the doors open, given the low Medicaid 
reimbursement rates. And as one participant said, memory care facilities that do accept state 
assistance are “terrible.” 

Points of greatest frustration: 

▪  Stagnant Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. Excess costs are passed on to 

residents, where the out-of-pocket costs of care exceed the financial means of PWD. 

▪  Cost of memory care—facility, staff, training—far exceeds reimbursement. 

Participants believe funding should support the creation of a model of care that can be easily 
replicated throughout South Dakota. This model would prioritize affordability, an availability to 
key resources and services that prioritize the PWD’s quality of life, standardized education and 
training for all professional caregivers, and guidance and support for family caregivers to 
effectively navigate their PWD’s journey with AD.

edicaid expenditures by provider type (2017) 

Providers with the largest percentage of total Medicaid expenditures in South Dakota in 2016 
were hospitals, nursing homes/assisted living providers, and DHS/Developmental Disability 
community support providers. 

outh Dakota is an income cap state, meaning that to be eligible for Medicaid long-term care 
benefits there is a hard income limit, no higher than 300% of the Federal Benefit Level of 
$2,205/month. (seniorplanning.org, 2017). 

edicaid provides funding for 55% of the individuals in nursing homes. Home and community-
based services (HCBS) waivers are available and allow Medicaid recipients to receive Medicaid 
funding for in-home care. Home and community-based services are instrumental in reducing 
nursing home utilization and improving the quality of independent living for seniors. To 
improve overall long-term services and supports in South Dakota to the highest performing 
states, it was found that $70,800,000 more would go to HCBS instead of nursing homes. (Long-
Term Services and Supports Scorecard, 2017)

EIMBURSEMENT RATES 

“As a professional caregiver, the reimbursement rates in this state have changed 
immensely. So much so that if you have someone coming in with dementia and someone 
with a hip fracture, you’ll take the hip fracture because the reimbursement rate is so much 
higher for that person. I know there are facilities doing this on a daily basis. So where do the 
people go, and what happens to the caregiver, if they stay in the home? I think there is a 
possibility for people to remain in the home longer, but the resources are not there because 
there’s limited assistance for that care. There’s a huge gap in this state.”

3.  THE CURRENT AND PROJECTED SOUTH DAKOTA WORKFORCE NEEDS TO BE ADEQUATELY SIZED 

AND SKILLED TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR CARE. 

CNAs, home health aides, social workers, and other frontline care workers have more direct 
contact with PWD and their caregivers than any other health care professions. They are 
responsible for the intensive, daily, hands-on care PWD require in the home and in a long-term 
care facility. Participants spoke of a gap between what South Dakota currently has for a health 
care workforce and what is needed to provide quality care. Despite the essential roles these 
professions play on the AD care team, participants described them as low-pay positions, with 
minimal AD education provided in the workplace, little opportunity for advancement, and high 
stress. They see these factors contributing to high burnout and turnover rates in the field, 
which result in inconsistent quality of care and interaction with PWD—factors that can 
compromise PWD’s wellbeing.  

f professional caregivers are valued through fair compensation for their work and learn how to 
skillfully handle the unique challenges of caring for a PWD, participants think these caregivers 
may be more inclined to see the value in their work. As a result, burnout and turnover rates 
could be mitigated. 

he absence of AD specialists and trained physicians throughout most of South Dakota also 
surfaced during discussion on workforce. The University of South Dakota offers the only 
baccalaureate gerontology program in the state, meaning that specialty presence in the state is 
largely dependent upon out-of-state recruitment. This expertise was identified as a need by 
caregivers who expressed needing professional AD or senior care expertise on their side upon 
diagnosis to help decide the appropriate level of care and for medication management.  

ithout accessible medical expertise on AD, diagnoses have been delayed and, in some cases, 
missed entirely. Delay in early and accurate diagnosis brings real consequences to the PWD and 
their family, such as increased difficulty in arranging necessary legal and financial matters, 
frustration with handling AD symptoms and behaviors without professional guidance or drug 
and non-drug interventions, and missed cost savings. 

ioux Falls has the most AD expertise within its health care community in South Dakota. Even 
so, participants see the need for a more AD educated and trained workforce. In smaller and 
rural communities, access channels to specialists that work with AD are particularly limited, 
such as for geriatricians, neurologists, psychiatrists, and primary care physicians with AD 
training. Attempts to rotate specialists amongst rural communities have not met participant 
expectations and the wait times for primary care and specialist appointments in larger 
communities have discouraged PWD from accessing care in a timely manner, making a 
continuum of care experience difficult to realize. 

he need for workforce development is statewide. Staffing of facilities is a problem that exists 
today. With more jobs open than people to fill across many industries—health care in 
particular—, participants see the demand for workers to staff home health agencies and long-
term care facilities well exceeding current capacity. Participants expressed concern as to what 
this gap in workforce means for South Dakota’s aging population in general and AD population 
especially.

ong-term care projections for the Health Care 
and Social Assistance Industry show a 10.6% 
change from 62,395 in 2014 to 68,992 in 2024. 

This industry will stand to be supported by 
technological advancements that may allow 
more adults to live longer in the home at a 
lower cost but will not be replaced by 
increased automation.

HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE: CURRENT AND PROJECTIONS 
In South Dakota, the level of health professional who often cares for older adults and those 
diagnosed with AD include nurses (RNs), licensed practical nurses (LPNs), certified nursing 
assistants (CNAs), home-health aides, physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. 
Participants refer to them as the Care Team. 

ome-health aides and CNAs are expected to be among the nation’s fasted growing in-demand 
occupations. The Department of Labor’s economists expect about a million more positions will 
be added from 2014 to 2024. The critical challenge at hand nationally is how to turn these 
minimum-wage, direct-care jobs into higher-quality and better-paid positions that can attract 
the millions of new workers who will be needed to meet the demand. (New York Times, 2017). It 
is suggested that South Dakota would need 3,101 more home health and personal care aides 
available to improve its performance to the level of the top-five-performing states. (Long-Term 
Services and Supports Scorecard, 2017)

With the projected increase in the South Dakota population 65 years of age or older in 2030, an 
estimated 55,519 (30%) will be most vulnerable. It is projected that 79 Geriatricians will be 
needed in 2030. Between now and 2030, 65 geriatricians need to be trained to meet the need 
and gaps in care. Just 6% of the 68 clinical nurse specialists and 1.8% of the 848 certified nurse 
practitioners practice in Gerontology in South Dakota. (South Dakota Center for Nursing Workforce, 
2017) 

GERIATRICIAN EDUCATION IN SOUTH DAKOTA 

▪  Physician: Geriatrics Fellowship Program through The University of South Dakota 

Sanford School of Medicine. 

▪  Nursing: 

o  Eight baccalaureate degree programs. 

▪  All include curriculum components guided by the American Association of 
the Colleges of Nursing, Recommended Competencies and Curricular 
Guidelines for the Nursing of Older Adults. 

▪  South Dakota State University undergraduate nursing curriculum include 

concepts related to neurological changes with aging, including AD. 
▪  Presentation College includes one theory course on Neurocognitive 

Disorders, including AD. Students spend at least six clinical hours working 
with patients in a long-term care or memory unit. 

o  Six practical nursing programs. 
o  Three associate degree programs. 
o  Seventeen approved nursing programs.

National limits on geriatric education include: shortage of time spent in training curriculums, 
low student demand, and lack of geriatric-trained educators. (Bardach, S. H., & Rowles, G. D.

4.  PROFESSIONAL CARE PROVIDERS AND FAMILY CAREGIVERS NEED EDUCATION AND TRAINING TO 

IMPROVE CARE QUALITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCIES. 

 

43.2% of survey respondents identified the education and training of health care professionals 
and caregivers as one of the most pressing needs for persons impacted by AD in South Dakota. 
In all fifteen focus groups, education and training—or lack thereof—was spoken of critically in 
the following ways: 

articipants believe that health professionals at all levels of care are unprepared to address 

AD—and resort to guessing much of the time. Whether it is the primary physician that 
addresses the first symptoms and diagnosis of AD, or the CNA or home health aide that is 
responsible for comfort care and behavior management as the disease progresses, participants 
are not confident in the level of education and training professionals possess. Participants who 
identified as health professionals working in the field of AD expressed doubt of their own care 
competencies and called for additional training through the workplace to become more adept 
for the sake of quality patient care and career longevity. 

articipants recognize the complexity and difficulty of providing AD care and propose a 

concentrated, ongoing AD curriculum that equips care providers to be competent, agile, and 
able to meet PWD and their caregivers where they are at. Participants also called for 
professions that have a more indirect connection to PWD—dentists, optometrists, pharmacists, 
financial advisors, lawyers—to at the very least be able to recognize symptoms and 
appropriately work with PWD. Training would include how to respond and adjust their practice 
to uphold the safety, dignity, and best interests of PWD. 

amily caregivers also need education and training. Participants who identified as family 
caregivers shared that they knew very little themselves and were educated very little upon 
diagnosis. They reported trouble in determining how best to care for the PWD in the home, 
when/if to transition to a long-term care setting, and how to make use of limited community 
services. They did not know enough to make informed care decisions in the PWD’s best 
interest. They were unprepared to handle the emotional, financial, and physical toll of 
caregiving. Without proper education and training available, the PWD under their care is not 
able to thrive to the best their condition allows. And caregivers report exhaustion and a decline 
in the quality of their own lives. 41.5% of survey respondents noted that caregiver education 
and training were the most helpful resources available to them. Financial support for caregivers 
to get the training they need was identified as a significant need. 

n addition to improving the quality of AD care and reducing frustration of professional and 
family caregivers, participants see increased education and training as a critical means to slow 
disease progression and extend a PWD’s quality of life. An AD competent caregiving community 
can lead to an increased rate of early diagnosis, appropriate care intervention, and help to 
minimize stigma by increasing awareness and understanding.

PARTICIPANT INPUT ON AD EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN SOUTH DAKOTA 
Participants set the priority of developing standardized education and training for professional 
and family caregivers. Education and training were top of mind for participants and discussion 
surfaced many recommendations as to who should be educated and trained, who should be 
responsible for its delivery, how it could be offered, and topics that need to be covered. The 
following are recommendations and ideas that were mentioned in two or more focus groups 
and in survey responses.

The public/community  
Families  
Caregivers  

Students

articipants did not focus on strategizing how to bring increased education and training to 

South Dakota, but did emphasize that it must be easily accessible, well-publicized, and 
affordable to be effective on a statewide scale and bring about meaningful improvement in the 
quality of care provided.

5.  SOUTH DAKOTA NEEDS TO REFRAME HOW AD IS UNDERSTOOD, PERCEIVED, AND CARED FOR 
THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO REDUCE STIGMA AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE A PWD 
EXPERIENCED. 

Survey respondents rated their satisfaction with public awareness a 2.7 (on a scale of 1-5) with 
room for improvement. Throughout focus group discussion, the call for increased community 
awareness and support was framed as a way reduce the stigma attached to AD in South Dakota 
and open the issue up for expanded discussion at all levels:  in the home, in the community, 
and at the state level. 

D stigma can be seen in many ways: 

  A

Individuals are reluctant to acknowledge memory concerns and related symptoms. 

▪ 
▪  Families are embarrassed and/or afraid of an AD diagnosis. 
▪  Family caregivers do not want to accept help and are slow in doing so. 
▪  Physicians delay evaluation/diagnosis. 
▪  Home health care is not touted as a viable, long-term care option. 
▪  Long-term care facilities are ill-equipped to provide the type of care PWD need. 
▪  Community services and resources are not well-known or sufficient. 
▪  The public chalks it up to “old age.” 
▪  Lack of public recognition of Disease status (not just “normal” aging). 
▪  State Officials have not prioritized the condition of AD, its diagnosis, or its care even 

though education opportunities exist annually during session and throughout the year. 

tigma—matched with a lack of public awareness and support—can be detrimental for PWD 
and their families and allows the disease to grow behind closed doors. Participants see an 
increase in public awareness and support as an essential part of improving the care of PWD in 
South Dakota and improving their overall quality of life.  

ith more awareness comes a larger network of support to aid in the care of PWD and reduce 

the burden on both family caregivers and the health care community. 

ooking forward, participants want South Dakota to understand AD and rally behind it by 
endorsing the need for public awareness and support. 

“One client told me, ‘this is embarrassing, I wish I had cancer.’ With other diseases, 
people wear pink and fight for the cause, but with this disease, people leave town, 
so no one has to see them with this disease. We do not have awareness or a road 
map for how this disease will progress and that can be scary.”

intermittent nursing care by a licensed nurse. May provide home health agency services for 
short term skill services for a specific medical reason. 

aregiver: Anyone who provides care to a person with Alzheimer's disease or other dementias. 

Caregivers can be family members, friends, or paid professional caregivers. Caregivers may 
provide full or part-time help to the individual with dementia. 

▪  Paid professional caregivers work in hospital, residential, and home settings. Depending 

on the level of care provided, they are direct care providers or professional 
practitioners. 

hronic disease: According to the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, a chronic disease is 

one persisting for a long time (usually three months or more) and generally cannot be 
prevented by vaccines or cured by medications, nor do the symptoms disappear on their own. 
Health-damaging behaviors—particularly tobacco use, lack of physical activity, and poor eating 
habits—are major contributors to chronic disease. 

ementia: Dementia is not a specific disease. Instead, dementia describes a group of symptoms 

associated with a decline in memory, thinking, and social abilities severe enough to reduce an 
individual’s ability to perform everyday activities. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type 
of progressive dementia in older adults, yet there are several types of dementia. 

eriatricians: Physicians concerned with the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease in 

older adults. They specialize in managing conditions specific to aging, including dementia.

ome health agency: certified by Medicare to provide nursing services in the home to persons 

who require intermittent nursing care. 

ospice: A hospice program offers support for dying individuals and their family members to

benefit. 

ong-term care facility: A long-term care facility is a nursing home or assisted living center 
designed to provide a variety of services, including both medical and personal care, to 
individuals who are unable to manage independently in the community. Many residents in 
long-term care facilities have dementia.
