      <pre>Instructions to Request Mediation  
on Parenting Time or Child Custody Disputes 
 
The term “visitation” was changed to “parenting time” by the South Dakota Legislature. “Parenting time” means 
the time a parent spends with a child regardless of the custodial designation regarding the child. 
 
READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS AND REVIEW THE FORMS BEFORE BEGINNING 
 
THESE FORMS ARE ONLY FOR A PARTY TO SEEK MEDIATION IF THEY HAVE A CHILD 
CUSTODY OR PARENTING TIME DISPUTE WITH THE OTHER PARTY IN AN EXISTING 
DIVORCE OR PATERNITY CASE (OPEN OR CLOSED). 

MPORTANT NOTICES: 

•  Review the requirements of the law below and the UJS  webpage on mediation to see if it is right 

for your issue: https://ujslawhelp.sd.gov/mediation.aspx . 
 

•  The judge expects every person who appears in court without an attorney to know and follow the 

law. The judge will not be able to give you any help in court. 
 

•  Court employees cannot help you fill out forms or give you legal advice. If you have questions, 

please consult an attorney. 
 

•  You must follow the instructions included in this packet. 

•  Type your answers or print neatly using black or blue ink. 

 

 

REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW: SDCL 25-4-56, 25-4A-23. You may use these forms IF: 
 

•  There is a custody or visitation dispute for your minor child(ren) between you (a parent) and the 

other parent; OR  
 

•  You and the other parent are having difficulty agreeing on an initial Order for Child Support (not 

a modification); OR 
 
If you and the other parent have submitted—or intend on submitting—to the court a joint physical 
custody petition for your minor child(ren). 

• 

Note that mediation will not be ordered if: 

1) One of the parents has been convicted of domestic abuse as defined in SDCL 25-10-1(1); 
(2) One of the parents has been convicted of assault against a person defined in SDCL 25-10-1(2), 
excluding assault of any person related by consanguinity and not living in the same household; 

(3) One of the parents has a history of domestic abuse; or 
(4) Mediation is not readily available or the court determines that mediation is not appropriate based 

on the facts and circumstances of the case. 

In order to seek mediation, you must file a Motion for Hearing form with the clerk of court’s office in the 
county where the existing divorce or paternity case is filed.
