TO THE CITIZENS OF SOUTH DAKOTA: 

 
 The South Dakota Constitution divides the powers of our governme nt among three 
independent branches: the executive branch led by the Governor; the legislative branch led by the 
President of the Senate and Speaker of the House; and the judicial branch supervised by the Supreme 
Court. 

The South Dakota Judiciary safeguards the rights of every citizen and assures due process of 

 
law.  Each of us in the Unified Judicial System assumes a special responsibility to ensure that our 
South Dakota courts are accessible and responsive to the state and its citizens for, ultimately, it is you 
the public that we serve. 

It is with pride and pleasure that we present this outline and description of your South Dakota 

 
court system.

UNIFIED SYSTEM 

outh Dakota’s courts are organized into a 

unified judicial system by the State 
Constitution.  There are two levels of courts in 
South Dakota, the Supreme Court and the 
circuit courts.  In addition, magistrate courts 
operate under the authority and supervision of 
the circuit courts. 
 

The judicial power of the state is vested in a 
unified judicial system consisting of a Supreme 
Court, circuit courts of general jurisdiction, 
and courts of limited original jurisdiction as 
established by the Legislature.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
