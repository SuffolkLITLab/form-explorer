      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR EVICTION ACTIONS 
 

IN ORDER TO BE PROPERLY PREPARED FOR THIS TYPE OF ACTION, PARTIES ARE STRONGLY 
ENCOURAGED TO REVIEW CHAPTER 21-16 AND CHAPTER 15-6 OF THE SOUTH DAKOTA CODIFIED 
LAWS AND TO CONTACT AN ATTORNEY. 
 

FOR THE LANDLORD/PLAINTIFF: 

ORMS THAT MAY BE NEEDED: 

•  Notice to Quit and Vacate, UJS Form-110 
•  Case Filing Statement, UJS Form-232  
•  Summons, UJS Form-111  
•  Verified Complaint, UJS Form-112 
•  Motion for Default Judgment, UJS Form-113  
•  Affidavit in Support of Motion for Default Judgment, UJS Form-114  
•  Affidavit of Mailing, (need multiple) UJS Form-115 
•  Notice of Hearing, UJS Form-116 
•  Default Judgment, UJS Form-117 
•  Notice of Entry of Default Judgment, UJS Form-118 
•  Judgment of Eviction and Damages, UJS Form-138 
•  Notice of Entry of Judgment of Eviction and Damages, UJS Form-139 

 

TEP 1 – NOTICE TO QUIT AND VACATE (This step MUST be completed before moving on to 

STEP 2): 

ORM NEEDED FOR THIS STEP:   

•  Notice to Quit and Vacate, UJS Form-110 

The Notice to Quit and Vacate is the informal process for evicting a current tenant. The 
landlord must notify all parties who signed the lease, in writing, that they have three (3) days to vacate 
the premises. This step must be completed before a formal court action may be initiated.  

To complete this step, the landlord must complete the Notice to Quit and Vacate and make 

at least two copies. The Notice must be delivered to the Sheriff’s office in the county where the 
property is located for service on the tenant/s (SDCL § 21-16-2.) The Sheriff’s Office will charge a 
service fee that the landlord is responsible for paying. Once service has been completed, the Sheriff’s 
office will provide the landlord with an Affidavit of  Service with the details of the service on the 
tenant. The landlord should keep this Affidavit of Service for possible use in a formal court action. 
After being served, the tenant has three (3) days, excluding the date of service, to remove their 
personal property and vacate the premises. If the tenant complies, no further eviction action is 
necessary. If the tenant does not comply, a formal court action must be initiated to remove the tenant 
(See STEP 2). 

TEP 2 – INITIATING THE FORMAL COURT ACTION: 

 

 
FORMS NEEDED FOR THIS STEP: 

•  Case Filing Statement, UJS Form-232

•  Summons, UJS Form-111 
•  Verified Complaint, UJS Form-112 (copies of the lease, the Notice to Quit and Vacate, and the 

 

Sheriff’s Affidavit of Service must be attached to the Verified Complaint). 
 
 
If a tenant fails to vacate the premises within three (3) days, the landlord must initiate a  
 
formal court action to have the tenant legally removed. To accomplish this, the landlord must complete 
a Case Filing Statement for each party (the landlord and the tenant/s), the Summons, and the Verified 
Complaint. Please note that the Verified Complaint MUST be signed in front of a Notary Public or the 
Clerk of Court. Copies of the Notice to Quit and Vacate and Sheriff’s Affidavit of Service for the 
notice to quit must be attached to the Verified Complaint. The landlord should make at least two (2) 
copies of the Summons and Verified Complaint (with attachments), one set for their own records and 
one set for service on the tenant. File the originals, along with the original Case Filing Statements, with 
the Clerk of Court’s Office in the county where the property is located. There will be a filing fee. If the 
landlord believes they are eligible for a waiver of the fee, they may file the waiver request found at 
https://ujslawhelp.sd.gov/WaiverofFees.aspx. Once the court has determined whether the landlord 
qualifies, the landlord will be notified. The case will not go forward until a determination is made that 
the landlord qualifies for the waiver, or the fee is paid. 

A copy of the Summons and Verified Complaint (with attachments) must be delivered to  the 
Sheriff’s office for service on the tenant. This is a very important step as service of the Summons and 
Verified Complaint is what starts the court eviction action. The Sheriff’s Office will charge a service 
fee that the landlord is responsible for paying. When service has been completed, the Sheriff’s Office 
will provide an Affidavit of Service verifying when and how the tenant was served. The landlord must 
file this affidavit with the Clerk of Court’s Office immediately upon receipt.   
 

Once served, the tenant has four (4) days, not counting the day served, to serve and file an 

Answer. Those four days will not begin to run until proper service is made. The landlord should also 
keep in mind that the tenant may serve the answer on the landlord by mail. In that case, service is 
completed upon mailing and an additional three (3) days for delivery are allowed (SDCL 15-6-6e). If 
the tenant answers skip STEP 3 and go to STEP 4. 

TEP 3 – DEFAULT JUDGMENT: (ONLY IF THE TENANT HAS NOT ANSWERED OR 

APPEARED WITHIN FOUR (4) DAYS OF SERVICE).  

   

  S

  F

ORMS NEEDED FOR THIS STEP: 

•  Motion for Default Judgment, UJS Form-113 
•  Affidavit in Support of Default Judgment, UJS Form-114 
•  Affidavit of Mailing, (will need at least 2) UJS Form-115 
•  Notice of Hearing, (if hearing is required) UJS Form-116 
•  Default Judgment, UJS Form-117 
•  Notice of Entry, UJS Form-118 

 
 
 
If the tenant fails to answer the complaint within four (4) days, the landlord may be entitled to 
default judgment. This means that the Court may find in favor of the landlord and order the tenant to 
vacate the premises immediately. To request default judgment, the  landlord must complete the Motion 
for Default Judgment and Affidavit in Support of Default Judgment. Please note the Affidavit MUST 
be signed in front of a Notary Public or Clerk. Once signed, the landlord should make two copies and 

Page 2 of 4  

FORM UJS-109 
REV. 02/2023 

 

mail one to the tenant. They next complete the Affidavit of Mailing, signing only in front of a Clerk or 
Notary, and file it and the original Motion for Default Judgment, and Affidavit in Support of Default 
Judgment with the Clerk’s office. Once these are filed the landlord will need to inquire as to whether 
that Court requires a hearing on the motion. If a hearing is required the landlord will request a hearing 
date from the Clerk’s office, or Court Administration, depending on the county. Once a date is 
scheduled, the landlord must then fill out the Notice of Hearing (check the Motion for Default 
Judgment box), mail a copy to the tenant at least seven (7) days before the hearing, and complete 
an Affidavit of Mailing, filing the originals with the Clerk’s office. At or before the time of 
hearing/default, the landlord should have the Default Judgment form available for the Court. If the 
Court finds the tenant is in default, the judge will sign the Default Judgment. After receiving a copy of 
the signed Judgment, the landlord must complete the Notice of Entry, mail a copy of the Judgment and 
Notice of Entry to the tenant, and file the originals with the Clerk along with a completed Affidavit of 
Mailing. 

TEP 4 - TRIAL (IF TENANT FILES AN ANSWER OR OTHER PLEADING)       

FORMS NEEDED FOR THIS STEP: 

•  Notice of Hearing, UJS Form-116 
•  Affidavit of Mailing, (may need two) UJS Form-115 
•  Judgment of Eviction and Damages, UJS Form-138 
•  Notice of Entry, UJS Form-139  

 

 
If the tenant does serve and file a response to the landlord’s complaint, a trial must be 
scheduled. As soon as they receive an answer, the landlord must contact the Clerk of Court’s office or 
Court Administration, depending on the county, to schedule a trial date. The landlord must then 
complete the Notice of Hearing (check the Eviction Complaint and Answer box) and mail it to 
the tenant at least seven (7) days before the trial date. Once mailed, they then complete the 
Affidavit of Mailing and file the original along with the original Notice of Hearing with the Clerk’s 
office. At the trial, the landlord should have the Judgment of Eviction and Damages form available for 
the Court. If the Court finds in favor of the landlord, the judge will sign the Judgment. After receiving 
a copy of the signed Judgment, the landlord must complete the Notice of Entry, mail a copy of the 
Judgment and Notice of Entry to the tenant, and file the originals with the Clerk along with a 
completed Affidavit of Mailing.     
 
 
landlord can take the signed Judgment of Eviction and Damages form to the Sheriff’s Office to have 
the tenant forcibly removed. 

 
If judgment is entered and the tenant/s fails to vacate the premises in the time ordered, the 

If, at any point, the landlord seeks to dismiss the eviction case, the landlord can file with the 

Court an Order of Dismissal (UJS-105).

If the tenant vacates the premises within three days after being served the Notice to Quit and 
 
Vacate, excluding the day of service, they do not need to do anything further. However, if the tenant 
does not vacate the premises and is then served with a Verified Complaint and Summons, the tenant 
must file and serve an Answer within four (4) days,  not counting the day of service. Failure to answer 
the complaint may result in default judgment against them, meaning they will not be given the 
opportunity to present evidence or make any argument against eviction to the court, and the court will 
likely rule in favor of the landlord.   

To prevent default judgment, the tenant must complete the Answer and mail a copy  to 

the landlord within four (4) days of receiving the complaint and summons. After they have mailed 
the Answer to the landlord the tenant must then complete the Affidavit of   Mailing Answer, sign it in 
front of a Clerk or Notary, and file it and the original Answer with the Clerk of Court’s office in the 
county where the court action was initiated. They must also complete and file a Civil Case Filing 
Statement. An answer filing fee is required to file. If the tenant believes they are eligible for a waiver 
of the answer fee, they may file a waiver request with the Clerk of Court’s office for the court to rule 
on. The form to request a waiver is found at the following link: https://ujs.sd.gov/uploads/forms/UJS-
137ApplicationWaiverFeeAnswerResponsivePleading.pdf.  It is very important that the tenant serve 
the Answer on the landlord within that four-day period. To properly serve the landlord, the tenant must 
mail the documents on or before that fourth day. Service is considered complete upon mailing.  

Once the landlord has received a copy of the Answer, they are responsible for scheduling a 

trial date. Once they have a trial date the landlord then completes the Notice of Hearing, mails a copy 
to the tenant, and files the original with the Clerk’s office. The landlord and the tenant must appear for 
the trial and bring any witnesses or evidence they wish to present. If the landlord fails to appear for the 
trial, the Court may direct the tenant to prepare an Order of Dismissal (UJS-105) for the Court to 
dismiss the case. 
 

After hearing evidence and argument presented during the trial from the landlord, the Court 

will seek the evidence and argument of the tenant. After the Court has heard from both sides, the Court 
will make its decision. If, the tenant does not appear for trial, the court will likely rule in favor of 
the landlord and award the damages requested.  

If the tenant fails to vacate the premises after a Judgment of Eviction and Damages has been 

entered the landlord can have the Sheriff’s office forcibly remove them from the property.
