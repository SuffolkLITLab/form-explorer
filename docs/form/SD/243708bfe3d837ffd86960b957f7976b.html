INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILING A PETITION FOR 
MODIFICATION OF CHILD SUPPORT OBLIGATION 

outh Dakota allows either the custodial or non-custodial parent to petition for modification of a South Dakota child support 
order. In limited circumstances, another state’s child support order may be modified if registered in South Dakota. Please 
contact the Division of Child Support or your attorney for more information regarding modification of out-of-state child 
support orders. You are the Petitioner, and the other parent/party is the Respondent.   

f the support order was established or last modified: (1) before July 1, 2022, or (2) more than three years have passed since 
establishment or modification of the order, you do not have to state any change in circumstances within the petition. If the 
order  was  established  after  July  1,  2022,  and  is  less  than  three  years  old,  you  must  state  a  substantial  change  in 
circumstances before modification is appropriate. (SDCL 25-7-6.13 and 25-7A-22) 

n  any  petition  for  modification,  state  law  provides  that  the  referee  and  court  may  consider  health  insurance  coverage, 
childcare expenses, and immediate wage withholding as part of any decision.   

ake certain you complete all sections within the petition and financial statement.   

•  The petition must be signed and dated.   
•  Signatures must be original and cannot be a photocopy.  
•  You must submit all necessary attachments with the Petition. See the Checklist for required attachments.   

Failure to  attach  the  required attachments  or  failure  to  indicate why  the  attachment is  not included  will 
result in the Petition being returned to you.    

•  All pages, including attachments and petition must be printed single sided.  If the petition or attachments are 

printed double sided (front to back), the petition will be returned to you.   

•  Petition and all attachments must be on 8 ½ x 11 size white paper. If on any other size of paper or on colored 

paper, the petition will be returned to you.   

•  You must use blue or black ink. If you use any other ink color or pencil, the petition will be returned to you.   
•  Please print the information legibly.  

 $50 filing fee is required to be paid to the Clerk of Courts by the petitioning party. However, the petitioning or moving 
party is not subject to the $50 filing fee if he/she is a recipient of assistance benefits pursuant to Title 28, Public Welfare 
and  Assistance  (i.e.,  Temporary  Assistance  to  Needy  Families,  Supplemental  Nutrition  Assistance  Program,  Medicaid, 
Child Care Assistance, Energy Assistance, etc.) (SDCL 16-2-29(4)(a)). The Petitioner may also file a motion requesting the 
court to waive the $50 filing fee by completing and submitting the enclosed Filing Fee Waiver Request form with this 
petition. If you are not a recipient of Title 28 benefits as indicated above, or if you do not submit the waiver request form, 
attach a $50 check or money order payable to the Clerk of Courts. DO NOT ATTACH CASH. If you wish to have the 
waiver  considered,  only  include  the  waiver.  If  you  include  both  the  waiver  and  $50  filing  fee,  the  waiver  will  not  be 
considered. If you are filing more than one petition, a separate $50 payment or waiver must be attached to each petition. If 
the payment is made out to an entity other than the Clerk of Court, the petition will be returned to you and will result in a 
delay in filing. 

ail your petition, financial statement, and supporting attachments to:  Division of Child Support, Attn: Modification 
Unit, 700 Governors Drive, Pierre, SD  57501-2291. If you have any questions, call the Modification Unit at (605)773-
4724. A brochure explaining the process is also available at any Division of Child Support or Department of Social Services’ 
office or online at https://dss.sd.gov/childsupport/modifysupportorder.aspx .

DCL 25-7A-22 provides for a process for the custodial parent, non-custodial parent, or an assignee to file a petition to 
increase  or  decrease  South  Dakota  support  orders  based  upon  a  change  in  circumstances.  This  process  involves  the 
Department of Social Services, referees appointed by the Unified Judicial System, and the Circuit Courts. The steps for the 
modification process are outlined below. 
 

1.  Petition, financial statement, a copy of the court order, and other attachments are filed with the Department of Social 

.  DSS submits the documents to the Clerk of Court in the county where the court order is filed. All documents become 

permanent part of the court file.   

Services (DSS).

MODIFICATION OF SUPPORT ORDERS 

3.  The Circuit Court judge appoints a referee to conduct a hearing on the Petition for Modification. NOTE:  The $50 
filing fee must be made payable to the Clerk of Courts (check or money order only – DO NOT send cash) before 
the Court will appoint a referee to conduct a modification hearing, unless the Petitioner is exempt from, or the court 
has waived, the filing fee. 

4.  The referee sends notice to the parties with a scheduled hearing date, and a request for the non-petitioning party to 
submit financial statement and other information. If the Petitioner does not appear at the hearing, the referee may 
dismiss the request for modification. Hearings are held in person or telephonically. Be sure to read the Notice of 
Hearing when received as it will contain important information.   

5.  The referee conducts a hearing, using the child support guidelines, to determine whether the child support order 
should be changed. The parties may provide testimony or evidence to the referee for consideration of deviations or 
other allowable factors. 

6.  Based upon the findings of the referee, the referee enters a report recommending the amount of the monthly support 
obligation. This report is filed with the Circuit Court, and a copy is served on the custodial parent, non-custodial 
parent, and the assignee, if applicable, within 60 days from date of hearing.   

7.  Any of the parties may file written objections to the referee’s report with the Circuit Court within ten (10) days 
from the date  of  service  (mailing)  of  the  report.  A transcript  of the  referee’s hearing is generally  required.  If  a 
transcript is desired, it must be ordered from the referee within ten (10) days of the day the referee mails the report.   

8.  If no objections are filed within ten (10) days, the Circuit Court may enter its order. If the Circuit Court modifies 
the  referee’s  recommended  order  without  a  court  hearing,  either  party  may  file  a  written  objection  to  that 
modification with the Circuit Court within ten days of service of the order.  

9.  If objections are filed within ten (10) days by one of the parties, the other party shall have an additional five (5) 
days from the date of service of the objections to file additional objections with the court. The Circuit Court then 
schedules a hearing to consider the objections to the referee’s report. After the hearing, the Circuit Court enters an 
order to adopt the referee’s report, modify it, or reject and remand it for further hearing by the referee. 

10.  After entry of the Circuit Court order, the Department of Social Services serves both parties with a copy of the order 

by certified mail, and files proof of service with the court. 

11.  Either party can appeal the Circuit Court order to the South Dakota Supreme Court within thirty (30) days of entry 

of the circuit court order.

n accordance with SDCL 25-7-6.10, I request deviations from the support guidelines for the following reason(s) 
and  will  produce  evidence  at  the  hearing  to  prove  the  claimed  deviation(s):  (Mark  those  you  wish  to  have 
considered.) 

 1.  Income of a subsequent spouse or contributions of a third party to the income or expenses of that parent  

but only if the application of the schedule works a financial hardship on either parent. 

 

 

 

 2.  Financial condition of either party that would make application of the schedule inequitable. If the total  

amount of the child support obligation, including any adjustments for health insurance and child care costs, 
exceeds 50% of the obligor’s monthly net income, it is presumed that the amount of the obligation imposes 
 
a financial hardship on the obligor.  

 

 

 3.  Any necessary education or health care special needs of the children. 
 4.  Agreements between parents for extra forms of support for the direct benefit of the child.  
 5.  Obligation of either parent to provide for subsequent natural children, adopted children, or stepchildren.  

However, an existing support order may not be modified solely for this reason. 

 6.  Voluntary and unreasonable act of a parent that causes the parent to be unemployed or underemployed,  

consistent with the provisions of SDCL 25-7-6.26.  

  request  the  following  factors  be  considered  in  this  modification  proceeding:  (Mark  those  you  wish  to  have 
considered.) 

 1.  Abatement of support for visitation purposes. (SDCL 25-7-6.14) (Attach copy of visitation order) 
 2.  Cross Credit for shared parental responsibility. (SDCL 25-7-6.27) (Attach copy of visitation order) 
 3.  Allocation of travel costs for visitation.  (SDCL 25-7-6.15) (Attach verification of costs, if available) 
 4.  Health insurance coverage for the child(ren).  (SDCL 25-7-6.16) (Attach verification of coverage and  

 5.  Child care costs due to employment, job search, training, or education. (SDCL 25-7-6.18) (Attach  

cost) 

verification of costs) 

 request the following relief: 
1.  Respondent be required to appear and answer in this proceeding; 
2.  The Court modify the support obligation as determined by the Court after the hearing taking into consideration 

the deviations and other factors identified in this petition; and  

3.  The Court grant other relief as deemed just and equitable. 

  declare  and  affirm  under  the  penalties  of  perjury  that  the  information  contained  herein  has  been 
examined by me, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, is in all things true and correct. 

ote:  A person who signs this document knowing the information to be false or untrue, in whole or in part,
