      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS 
Uncontested Name Change of a Minor Child 

The procedure for legally changing the name of a minor child is complicated. Some laws and rules 
regarding this process can be found at SDCL ch. 21‐37, SDCL 34‐25‐51, and ARSD 44:09:05:02. 
These authorities have also been interpreted by the South Dakota Supreme Court in various cases. 
It is up to you to decide whether and how you use a lawyer in your case. The law allows you to 
do the case without a lawyer, which is also known as proceeding pro se (pronounced “pro‐say”). 

THE USE OF THESE FORMS IS LIMITED TO UNCONTESTED CASES: 
Cases where the minor child’s other parent consents to the change of the minor child’s name 
and signs the consent form. The other parent will ideally appear at the hearing as well, although 
it is not required. 

YOU CANNOT USE THESE FORMS IF: 
You do not know if the minor child’s other parent will consent to the change of the minor child’s 
name; or you know the minor child’s other parent will contest the change of the minor child’s 
name. 

If the other parent appears at the hearing and contests the name change, the name change will be 
denied. 

There are no forms offered for a contested name change of the minor child action. That is a matter 
in which you are strongly encouraged to consult an attorney. 

REQUESTING A NAME CHANGE IN SOUTH DAKOTA 

• 

In South Dakota, a “minor” is a child who has not yet turned age 18. 

•  You may change the minor child’s first, middle and/or last name. 

•  Unless otherwise provided below, if you have more than one minor child in your custody, 
they have the same biological parents and you want to change their names at the same 
time, you may do so by including all of the children on the same verified petition. You 
need open only one file. 

• 

• 

If the parents of the minor children are NOT the same and/or you are requesting different 
name changes for more than one child, you will need to file a separate verified petition for 
each  child.  This  will  involve  paying  a  separate  filing  fee  for  each  child.  They  will  be 
considered separate actions. 

If,  for  example,  you  are  a  single  mother  who  has  more  than  one  minor  child  in  your 
custody whose names you want to change, but there is more than one father involved, 

Page 1 of 14 

FORM UJS‐029  
REV. 09/2022 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you will need to file a separate verified petition for each child. This will involve paying a 
separate filing fee for each child. They will be considered separate actions. 

•  Once you file the verified petition, the case will be assigned a case number. This number 
must be on all documents filed with the court. You should be aware that there may be 
additional costs associated with providing notice that you intend to change a minor child’s 
name. 

If  you file a Verified Petition for Name Change  of a Minor Child without the assistance of an 
attorney you must complete all the forms necessary. The Clerk of Court’s office cannot assist you 
in preparing any legal documents, or advise you of the process. However, you may contact the 
Legal Form Help Line at 1‐855‐784‐0004 or e-mail the UJS for help with forms at this link-
- https://ujslawhelp.sd.gov/emailstaff.aspx--if you have questions regarding completion of the 
forms. If you have any legal questions, please contact an attorney of your choosing.

COMPLETION OF FORMS 

READ ALL INSTRUCTIONS PRIOR TO FILLING OUT ANY OF THE FORMS. 

In  order  to  legally  change  a  name,  you  must  file  a  Verified  Petition  for  Name  Change  of  a 
Minor Child form (UJS‐030)  with the  Clerk of Court office  in the  county  where  you reside, 
provided you and the minor child have resided there for more than six months immediately before 
the filing of the verified petition. You will also be required to pay the civil case filing fee. You 
will be referred to as the petitioner in this name change proceeding. 

You must also submit a completed Civil Case Filing Statement form (UJS‐232) to the Clerk of 
Court’s office at the time of filing your verified petition. The case name should appear in the “In 
the Matter of” caption. For example, if John Smith is requesting to change his daughter’s legal 
name from Emma Doe to Emma Smith, he should print in the “In the Matter of” caption: John 
Smith’s Petition Regarding a Name Change of Emma Doe, Minor Child, to Emma Smith. Since 
you are initiating a civil action, you must check the Petitioner participant role box under the Civil 
case  type.  Please  provide  your  personal  information  as  requested  on  the  form.  If  you  have  an 
attorney representing you in the proceeding, provide their information as well. 

Captions: All of the forms for this proceeding have a caption at the top that, except the name of 
the form, appear as follows: 

 

Each form will be completed identically using the following instructions: 

•  On the top left, enter the name of the county where you are filing the Verified Petition. 
•  On the top right, enter the judicial circuit (First through Seventh) of the county. This 
information can be obtained from the Clerk of Court’s office or on the UJS website. 
•  Enter the name (first, middle, and last name) of the minor child as it appears on their 

birth certificate. 

•  Enter the proposed first, middle, and last name of the minor child. 
•  The  Clerk  of  Court’s  office  will  give  you  a  case  number  when  you  file  the  Verified 
Petition. You must include the case number on all papers you file, which is documented 
above the name of the form (File No. ___________).

that you have a good faith reason for your requests. If you are not telling the truth, if you are

court could find you in contempt or you could be prosecuted for not telling the truth. 

FORM UJS‐031: NOTICE OF HEARING FOR CHANGE OF NAME OF 
MINOR CHILD 

Pursuant to SDCL 21‐37‐5.1, if the following three items are true, you can skip this step and 
begin working on the section entitled “Service to the Other Parent”:

2.  The minor child’s parents or legal guardians give written consent to the name change. 
3.  If the minor child is twelve years or older, the minor child consents in writing to the 

at least six months. 

name change. 

If even one of the three items listed above is not true, than pursuant to SDCL 21‐37‐4, you must 
publish the Notice of Hearing on Change of Name of a Minor Child. The notice must state the 
time and place and object thereof with the current and proposed names of the minor child. It must 
be published one time each week for four successive weeks in any legal newspaper of the county

of petitioner’s residence. If you are unsure whether a newspaper is considered to be a legal 
newspaper for your county, contact the county Auditor’s Office. 

You need to contact the clerk of court or court administrator’s office and request that a hearing be 
scheduled approximately six weeks in the future. When scheduling, make sure you have a copy of 
your  filed  verified  petition  to  refer  to.  Additionally,  make  sure  you  allow  enough  time  for 
publication and the receipt of the Affidavit of Publication prior to the hearing. In order to do this, 
you should know the day of the week the newspaper has to  receive the  Notice of Hearing on 
Change of Name of a Minor Child to begin publication in the next circulation and in what form. 
It  is  suggested  you  ask  about  the  expense  of  publication  as  well  so  you  are  prepared  for  that 
expense in advance. 

If another hearing has to be scheduled because enough time was not allowed for publication, the 
Court may order that another Notice of Hearing on Change of Name of a Minor Child be 
published again. This would be an additional expense for you. You will not be refunded any 
fees or expenses. 

•  Complete the caption as set forth in the Instructions, beginning on page 3. 
•  Next, in the first blank, enter your name (first, middle, and last), as the petitioner. 
• 

In the second blank, enter the name (first, middle, and last) of the minor child, as it 
appears on the birth certificate. 
In the third blank, enter the proposed first, middle, and last name of the minor child. 
In the second sentence, enter the hearing date (day, month, year) and the time. Circle am 
or pm. Enter the name of the Judge who will be presiding over the hearing. Enter the 
name of the courthouse, the city and the county where the courthouse is located. 

• 
• 

A  Judge  or  the  Clerk  of  Court  must  date  and  sign  the  notice  of  hearing,  not  the 
petitioner. The Clerk of Court must put a seal on the document. 

PUBLICATION 
 
The original, signed Notice of Hearing for Change of Name of a Minor Child must be filed 
with the Clerk of Court. Keep a photocopy for your records. Once the forms have been filed, the 
clerk  will give  you  a  copy  of  the filed Notice of Hearing for Change of Name  of a  Minor 
Child. Keep a photocopy for your records. 

YOU must publish the filed Notice of Hearing for Change of Name of a Minor Child once 
each week for four successive weeks in any legal newspaper of the county of the petitioner’s 
residence. It cannot be just any newspaper. If you are unsure whether a newspaper is considered 
to be a legal newspaper for your court, contact the county Auditor’s Office. 

Upon  completion  of  the  publication,  the  newspaper  will  provide  you  with  an  Affidavit  of 
Publication. You must file the original signed affidavit with the Clerk of Court on or before the 
day of the scheduled hearing.

SERVICE TO THE OTHER PARENT 
 

A copy of the Verified Petition for Name Change of a Minor Child must also be sent to the 
other parent by certified mail a minimum of 10 days prior to the hearing. If  you had to do 
publication, the other parent must also receive a copy of the file‐stamped notice of hearing. 
If the  other parent pays child support, the  documents  must  be sent  to the other  parent at  the 
address last provided to the Clerk of Court or the Office of Child Support Enforcement, unless 
you are aware of a more current address. 

Service on the other parent may be accomplished in one of three ways, as provided below. You 
may choose which of the three methods of service you prefer: 

1.  HAND‐DELIVER with form UJS‐32B: NOTICE OF ADMISSION OF SERVICE 

OF VERIFIED COMPLAINT (Uncontested Name Change of a Minor). 

In an uncontested name change of a minor proceeding, the other parent will often agree to accept 
service, avoiding the need to have a Sheriff or private process server serve them. As the petitioner, 
you may choose to hand‐deliver copies of the Verified Petition for Name Change of a Minor 
Child to the other parent. That other parent then must sign the Admission of Service of Verified 
Complaint  (Uncontested  Name  Change  of  a  Minor)  (UJS‐32B).  The  other  parent  neither 
admits  nor  denies  the  contents  of  the  documents;  he/she  merely  admits  that  they  received  the 
documents on the specified date. 

This form must be filled out in black ink. Complete the caption (the top third of the form), where 
you will need to know the name of your county, judicial circuit (ask your Clerk of Court if you 
don’t know), the minor child’s legal name (as listed on the birth certificate), and the name you 
wish the minor child to have. Ask your Clerk of Court for the case filing number (that goes after 
“CIV.” in the blank). 

The other parent must fill in his/her full legal name in the body of the text of the form, as well 
as the city, county, and state of the place where said parent received documents by hand delivery. 
The other parent must also fill in the date with the month, day, and year the documents were 
received. 

The other parent must sign (as witnessed by a notary) and print his/her name, mailing address, and 
telephone number in the spaces provided at the bottom of the form. He/she should then make a 
copy of the completed Admission of Service for his/her own records, and then return the original 
document to you. You should then make a copy for your own records, and then file the original 
Admission of Service of Verified Complaint (Uncontested Name Change of a Minor) with 
the Clerk of Court. 

2.  BY  MAIL  with  form  UJS‐32A:  NOTICE  OF  ADMISSION  OF  SERVICE  OF 

VERIFIED PETITION (Uncontested Name Change of a Minor). 

Page 7 of 14 

FORM UJS‐029  
REV. 09/2022 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This form must be filled out in black ink. Complete the caption (the top third of pages 1 and 4 
in the Form packet). You will need to know the name of your county, judicial circuit (ask your 
Clerk of Court if you don’t know), the minor child’s legal name (from the birth certificate), and 
the name you wish the minor child to have. Ask your Clerk of Court for the case filing number 
(that goes after “CIV.” in the blank). 

As the petitioning parent, you need to add the other parent’s name to the first and second pages 
of the Notice and Admission of Service of Verified Petition (Uncontested Name Change of a 
Minor). You must add the date of mailing, the address of the other parent where you mailed the 
Notice and Admission, and then sign and date the form, including your address and telephone 
number. 

Also, on the Affidavit of Mailing (page 4 of the Form), fill in your name, the date you mailed the 
Notice and Admission along with the other documents listed (to perfect service), the full legal 
name of the other parent, and said parent’s mailing address where the copies of the documents 
were sent. You must fill in the date and the location from which the documents were mailed. 
You need to sign the Affidavit of Mailing in front  of  a notary.  Also include a  self‐addressed, 
stamped envelope to allow the other parent’s quick return of the signed Notice and Admission. 
Combine these documents with two copies of the Notice and Admission, and take them to your 
post office. 

When you go to the post office to mail the documents, ask the post office to send it by certified 
mail to the other parent. You do not need to send the documents by registered mail, nor do you 
need to insure it. Also, you do not need to have the other parent sign for the documents when it is 
delivered; it is ok if any adult signs for the documents when they are delivered. Keep the green 
card that the post office sends back to you in case the court wants to see it. 

Upon receipt of the Notice and Admission and enclosed documents, the other parent must fill 
in their name on the Admission of Service (page 3 of the Form), as well as the town, county, 
and state of the place where he/she received the documents. That parent must then enter in the 
Admission of Service the date the copies of the Verified Petition were received and sign and 
date the Admission, including his/her mailing address and telephone number. 

The other parent should retain a copy of the completed Notice and Admission for his/her own 
records  and  return  the  original  to  you‐  in  the  self‐addressed  stamped  envelope‐  all  four  pages 
containing his/her ink‐signed Admission of Service. Upon receipt, you should also make a copy 
of the document for your own records and then incorporate the ink‐signed Admission of Service 
(page 3) into the original Notice and Admission. Finally, file this completed document with all 
original signatures with the Clerk of Court’s office. Failing to file this document may result in 
a denial of the proposed name change. 

3.  If attempts  to  achieve  hand‐delivered or mail service  FAILED, you may  request that the 
Sheriff’s  Office  or  private  process  server  serve  the  Verified  Petition  to  the  other  parent. 
Under this scenario, you deliver one full copy of the Verified Petition for Name Change of a 
Minor  Child  to  the  Sheriff’s  Office,  along  with  a  document  containing  the  other  party’s 
Page 8 of 14

current physical address, telephone number, place of employment, and any other relevant 
information.  If  you  had  to  do  publication,  you  must  also  include  the  Notice  of  Hearing. 
Typically, the cost of service (the service fee and mileage reimbursement) is pre‐paid. After 
service, the Sheriff or process server has his/her own form that he/she uses to prove service 
and that form is usually mailed to you. Make sure you make a copy of this form for yourself 
and file the original with the Clerk of Court’s office. 

This form is to be completed by the consenting parent.

OBTAINING A NEW BIRTH CERTIFICATE 
 
If you require the birth certificate of the minor child to be changed, you will need to submit to the 
Vital Records Office with both a certified copy of the “Order for Name Change of a Minor Child” 
and the applicable filing fee for amending a birth certificate to the following address:  
 

Office of Vital Records 
South Dakota Department of Health  
211 W Capitol Avenue  
Pierre, SD 57501 

Page 12 of 14 

FORM UJS‐029  
REV. 09/2022 

 

 

 

 

 

In South Dakota, the Vital Records filing fee to amend a birth certificate is currently $8.00.  This 
fee does not include the amount necessary to obtain an informational copy or a certified copy. You 
can obtain those at any Register of Deeds Office in South Dakota once the amendment is complete. 

f the child was born in a state other than South Dakota, you need to check with the Vital 
Records Office of that state to determine the applicable fees associated with amending the 
birth certificate and obtaining a certified copy of the new birth record. 

If you have any questions regarding the name change forms, you may contact the Legal 
Form Help Line at 1‐855‐784‐0004. If you have any questions of a legal nature, you are 
strongly urged to contact an attorney of your choosing. 
 

HELPFUL HINTS FOR THE HEARING 

1.  As the Petitioner, you must attend the hearing and testify under oath about the issues 
raised in the Verified Petition for Name Change of a Minor Child. Make sure you are 
prepared. 

2.  Bring a copy of the minor child’s birth certificate with you to Court. The Judge may want 

to review it to ensure that your pleadings are consistent with the birth certificate. 

3.  It is ideal if the consenting parent appears at the hearing as well. The consenting parent 
should be prepared to testify that they do consent to the proposed name change and why. 

4.  Dress appropriately for court. 

5.  You should take a file stamped copy of the Affidavit of Publication to the hearing in case 
the Judge wants you to have it marked as an Exhibit at the hearing. If you did not have to 
provide notice of hearing by publication, please disregard this step. 

6.  Before the hearing date, you should also check with court personnel to see if the minor 
child will be allowed in the courtroom during the hearing and whether the Judge will want 
the minor child present during the hearing. Do not just assume that the Judge will allow 
the minor child to be present. 

7.  You should bring two copies of the Order for Name Change of a Minor Child to the 
hearing. The Judge may keep the original signed Order for the court file and will give 
you a copy for your records. 

8.  Refer to A Guide for Representing Yourself in South Dakota Courts or the UJS website for 
additional helpful hints before your hearing. The Guide can be found at any Clerk of Court 
office or on the UJS website in many spots. 

9.  If the  court grants  your  request for the minor  child’s  name change  and  has signed the 
Order for Name Change of a Minor Child, you should get 3 certified copies of the Order

from the Clerk of Courts office. One copy goes to Vital Records, one copy goes to the 
other parent, and one is for your records. There are still a few things to do after the hearing, 
ie. completing the Notice of Entry, sending documents to the other parent and completing 
the Affidavit of Service. Please refer to the instructions above.

      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
