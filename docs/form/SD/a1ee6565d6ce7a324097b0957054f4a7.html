Some day you may find you need to go to court – to settle a dispute with 
 
a business or a neighbor, to get a divorce, or collect child support.  Many people 
hire a lawyer to take their case to court.  It’s a good idea.   A lawyer has training 
and experience – and knows how the system works.  Even if you end up 
representing yourself in court, it’s good to start by talking to a lawyer about your 
problem.  Find out if your case is a simple matter or one that could get 
complicated.  Ask what it would cost to hire a lawyer to handle it for you. 

 

Of course, not everyone can afford a lawyer.  And others may decide to 

take their chances and go at it alone.  Going solo in the courthouse can be very 
scary.  Especially if everything you know about the law is from watching 
television.  Going to court isn’t as simple as they make it seem on TV.  That’s 
why the South Dakota Unified Judicial System has published this brochure for 
you. 

In this booklet you will learn how the South Dakota court system works.  

You will learn the process – step by step.  Take it home and read it.  It could 
save you time and headaches later.   

 

Keep in mind that this guide is meant to give you helpful information, 
not legal advice.  Additional helpful information about the court system and its 
processes is available on the South Dakota Unified Judicial System’s website at 
http://ujs.sd.gov and at the Frequently Asked Questions sections available at 
each Circuit’s webpage which can also be accessed through a link from the UJS 
homepage.

 Yes.  You have the right to represent yourself in state courts.  In fact, 
many people in South Dakota go to court without a lawyer.  Some 
people can’t afford to hire a lawyer.  Others decide that they would 
rather handle their legal problem on their own. 

hould I go to court without a lawyer? 

That is your decision to make.  This guide was developed by the South 
Dakota Unified Judicial System to help you make that decision.  Some 
cases are fairly simple and can be handled without a lawyer.  Others 
involve complicated procedures and legal issues that require the 
experience and training of a lawyer.  It is a good idea to talk to a 
lawyer about your case if possible.  Whether you decide to hire a 
lawyer or to go to court on your own, it helps to know how the court 
system works.

es.  There is a list of services on page 11 of this guide that 
may help you.  You might want to take a moment now, before 
you begin your case, to find out where you can get information 
or advice.

language barrier? 

“Can I get 
help with 
my case if 
I need it?” 

veryone has a right to come to court and participate in the  
legal system.  This includes people who are disabled, people  
who are hearing or vision impaired, and people who don’t speak English.  If you or anyone 
participating in your case needs special arrangements, first contact the Clerk of Court or Circuit 
Administrator where you filed the case.  They should be able to make proper arrangements for a 
courtroom that is accessible, a sign language interpreter, or a translator.  It is important to contact the 
Clerk of Court or Circuit Administrator just as soon as possible, so they have time to make the 
arrangements.   

s there a way to solve my problems without going to court? 

It’s possible.  You may be able to resolve your dispute through mediation without 
filing a lawsuit.  Mediation gives people a chance to sit down with a mediator in 
an informal setting to try and work out their conflicts.  The mediator is a trained 
problem-solver who will help the parties come to an agreement.  There is a list of 
court approved mediators on the UJS website at http://ujs.sd.gov.

SOUTH DAKOTA JUDICIAL SYSTEM

in most actions; appellate

decisions, except small claims decisions.

Supreme

    Conducts preliminary hearings for all   
   
        criminal cases and trials for criminal misdemeanor 
   cases, civil actions that involve property of $12,000 or less,  
          and small claims proceedings of $12,000 or less. 

 

 

           

 

   

   

 

 

 

How is the court system set up 
in South Dakota? 
        
 

   

 

 

he court system is like a pyramid.  
At the bottom of the pyramid are the 
Magistrate Courts, where 
misdemeanor criminal cases and 
small claims court cases are heard.  
Next in the pyramid are the trial 
courts called Circuit Courts.  The 
highest court in the state is the 
South Dakota Supreme Court.  If 
someone loses a case in the circuit 
court, they can appeal to the South 
Dakota Supreme Court. 

 

here are two kinds of legal cases:  criminal and civil.  A criminal case is when the state charges a 
person with a crime.  A civil case is when someone sues an individual or a business.  There are many 
kinds of civil cases.  Some examples of a civil problem that could end up in court are:  a divorce, a 
dispute with a landlord, a boundary disagreement with a neighbor, or a problem with a store that sold 
you a faulty product.  This guide covers only civil cases. 

o I file my case where I live? 

t depends.  You must decide which 
county or state is right for your case.  
This is called finding the right 
venue.  The case is usually filed 
where you live or where the action 
took place, but not always.  Where 

      D

you file your case could affect the outcome especially in divorce and child custody cases.  See SDCL ch. 
15-5 for statutes on venue of actions. 

ow do I know which kind of court to go to? 

hat will depend on the type of case and the amount of money involved.  If it is a family law matter, 
like divorce, child support, or custody, your case belongs in Circuit Court.  If it is another kind of civil 
case, you may go to Magistrate Court if the amount of the money involved does not exceed $12,000.  If 
it is more than $12,000, then you need to go to Circuit Court.

called the Petitioner or Plaintiff.  That person files a written statement, 
called the Complaint, telling the court what the case is about.  Then they 
arrange to have the Summons and Complaint delivered to the other side.  
This is called “service of process.”

Defendant or the Respondent.  That person files a written response telling 
their side of the story and delivers a copy to the plaintiff.  This is called an 
Answer. 

Prepare the case.  Both sides have time to gather evidence to prove their case.  Evidence 

could include documents, photographs or the testimony of witnesses. 

The judge holds a hearing.  This is when both sides appear before the judge to present their

es.  The court will charge a fee to file your case.  See SDCL 16-2-29, 16-2-45.  There are additional fees 

for copying and/or certifying copies, or issuing subpoenas.  There is also a $10.00 charge for a divorce 
forms packet if obtained from the Clerk of Court office, or you may download divorce forms from the 
UJS website for free and print them yourself.   

ow do I make sure I’ve done everything right? 
ake it one step at a time and don’t be afraid to ask for help.  The courthouse staff cannot give you legal 

advice about your specific case, but they will answer your questions about court procedure.  If you 
decide that there is too much at stake or your case is too difficult to handle on your own, you can always 
contact a lawyer at any time. 

 

 Angela wanted to get a divorce because her husband left her. She went to the Clerk of Court Office to get a “Divorce Packet” 
which contains most of the forms she needs to fill out to file for divorce. There is a $10 charge for the divorce packet. The Clerk 
explained that she needed to read the instructions carefully before starting to fill out the forms. She suggested she practice in pencil 
before making a final copy. 
 Bob was sued by his landlord. The landlord filed a Summons and Complaint stating that Bob had not paid his rent. The landlord 
asked the court to force Bob to move out. Bob received a copy of the Complaint and a Summons telling how long he had to 
respond. Bob went to the Clerk of Court Office and was told that he needed to file an Answer. If Bob did not file an answer by the 
deadline, his landlord could have asked the court to rule against him right away. This is a called a default judgment.  Bob filed an 
answer stating “A pipe broke in my basement. The landlord told my wife that we should get a plumber to fix it, pay him and 
deduct it from the rent, so we did. The plumber cost more than the rent so that’s why the landlord didn’t get a check from us last 
month.” When the pipe broke in Bob’s basement, it also damaged a rug. So, Bob filed a counterclaim to ask the court to order his 
landlord to pay him for it.

The following are two scenarios that we would like to provide relating to filing a case:

   FILING THE SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT 
Is there a Summons and Complaint form I can use?  You may 
purchase a packet of divorce forms from the Clerk of Court Office for  
$10 or you may download the forms for free from the SD UJS's  
webpage at http://ujs.sd.gov/.  Forms for service by mail are available  
at SDCL 15-6-4(j).

…. is there 
someone who  
can help me  
with the forms? 

 

If I have trouble reading, is there someone who 
can help me with the forms? 
Yes, you can ask someone in the Clerk’s office to help you or 
contact your local library.  You may also contact the South 
Dakota Literacy Council at 1-800-484-6690 Code 8585 or 
(605) 224-8212.  You have to tell the person helping you what 
to write.  The person helping you can only write down what 
you say.  You can also take the forms home and ask a friend 
to read them to you. 

 

How do I notify the other person that I have filed 
a Summons and Complaint against them?  Whenever you file a lawsuit, including a divorce, 
you have to arrange to have the Summons and Complaint delivered to the other side and provide the 
court with proof of how, when and where the papers were received.  This is called service of 
process.  There are several ways that you can legally serve someone.  The most common methods are 
listed below and are addressed in SDCL 15-6-4(a) – (j) and SDCL 15-6-5(a) – (i).  See also SDCL ch. 
15-39 for small claims procedures. 

ersonal Service:  The papers are hand delivered to the defendant or respondent.  This is 

often done by the sheriff’s office or, in some larger communities, a private process server.  Personal service can 
also be done by any credible person over the age of eighteen who is not involved in the case.  An Affidavit of 
Service form proving that the person received the papers must be filled out and filed at the Clerk’s office.  See 
SDCL 15-6-4(g) for proof of service requirements. 

cceptance of Service:  If the other side is willing to accept the papers, you can give them a copy, have them sign 

an Admission of Service form saying that he received them, and file that form with the Clerk. 

ervice by Publication:  This method is used only if the person you’re suing lives out of state or you don’t know 

how to locate them.  Putting an ad in the newspaper usually does it but it can be a little tricky.  Service by 
publication is explained in greater detail in SDCL 15-9-7 – 15-9-22.  A court order is needed before you may serve 
someone by publication.  Proof of such service is described in SDCL 15-6-4(g)(4).   

o I serve the papers the same way when filing an Answer? 

You can serve an Answer by mailing it to the person who sued you.  You will still need to file an Affidavit of Mailing 
Service with the court showing when and where you sent the papers.

My papers have been filed and served.  What do I do to 
get ready for the hearing?  Now is the time to prepare your 
case.  You need to gather the evidence that will help prove your 
case to the judge.  The evidence could be papers, like receipts or 
bills that you bring to court with you.  You could also use witnesses 
to tell the court what they know about your case.  Let’s look at how 
Angela and Bob prepared for their hearing.

ngela received a Divorce Packet by the Clerk of Court.  There are specific things that Angela 

needs to do before the hearing.  These are spelled out in a divorce packet and include: 
▪ Filling out a Financial Affidavit to help the judge make decisions about dividing property and 
providing child support and setting alimony.  The Court will need copies of financial records, like 
income tax returns, pay check stubs, monthly bills, deeds to property, bank account statements, and 
retirement or pension plan statements. 
▪ Filling out a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement.  This spells out plans to separate assets and 
debts and the parties’ plan to care for the children.  It is completed if both parents agree to the terms 
of the divorce.     
▪ Attending Parent Education Class, where required.

ob needs to figure out what evidence he needs to prove his case.  The kinds of things he 

should consider are: 
▪ The receipt from the plumber or a copy of his cancelled check.  The plumber’s testimony 
might also be helpful.  He could testify that he did the repair and identify the bill.   
▪ Testimony from Bob’s wife.  She can testify that the landlord told her to hire a plumber 
and deduct the cost from their rent. 
▪ A receipt showing what Bob paid for the rug. If Bob uses receipts or checks as evidence, he 
should make sure that he has three sets:  the original for the court, one copy for the landlord, 
and one copy to keep for his own records. 

f his wife or the plumber is going to testify, Bob needs to write out his questions and go over 
them with each witness before the hearing.  If the plumber does not want to come to court, Bob 
can get a subpoena forcing him to come to court.  The Clerk’s office can provide Bob with a 
subpoena form that includes instructions for service.  But he should be careful - a witness who 
doesn’t want to testify may hurt his case more than he helps it.

  I

an  I  find  out  what  the  other  side  is  going  to  say  and  bring  to  the 

hearing? 
It is possible to find out what evidence the other side is going to present through a 
process  called  discovery.    In  civil  cases,  you  have  the  right  to  get  information 
about  witnesses  and  copies  of  documents  before  the  hearing.    There  are 
complicated rules about what you can get through discovery and strict time limits 
apply.  In South Dakota, discovery rules are generally located at SDCL 15-6-26 
through 15-6-37.  If you need to use discovery, you may want to talk to a lawyer. 

an I try to settle my case before the hearing? 

Absolutely.    Many  cases  settle  out  of  court  without  a  hearing.    For  example:  
Bob’s case might  be just a simple misunderstanding and could  be settled with  a 
phone call to his landlord or the landlord’s lawyer.  He might also want to use a 
mediator to help Bob and his landlord reach a settlement or an agreement. 

n Angela’s case, it will be better for everyone if they can agree on the parenting 
plan  before  the  hearing.    If  the  parents  can’t  agree  on  how  the  children  will  be 
cared for, what arrangements will be made for custody and visitation, the Circuit 
Court Judge may appoint a mediator.  See SDCL 25-4-56 through 25-4-62.  The 
mediator  will  sit  down  with  both  parents  in  an  informal  setting  and  help  them 
resolve some or all of their differences in caring for the children.  A list of court 
approved mediators can  be found on the UJS website at  http://ujs.sd.gov  or  you 
may ask a circuit court administrator for a list in that circuit.  These mediators do 
charge  a  fee  for  their  services  and  the  parties  can  agree  on  how  to  pay  for  this 
service.

THE HEARING 

 

How do I get a hearing?  Will the court just schedule one?  
Ask the clerk of the court where your case was filed whether you need to request a hearing or whether 
the court will schedule one on its own. In most Magistrate and small claims court cases, the court will 
send  both  sides  a  notice  of  hearing  telling  them  when  and  where  the  hearing  will  take  place.  In 
Circuit  Court  cases,  the  hearing  will  be  scheduled  only  upon  request.  In  that  case,  it’s  up  to  you  to 
contact  the  Clerk  of  Court’s  office to  request  that  a  hearing  be  scheduled.  Then,  you must  send  out  a 
notice to the other side telling them the time and date of the hearing.  

’ve never been to court.  What should I expect? 
Each court is a little different.  Some courts use formal rooms like the ones you see on television.  But 
some  hearings  may  be  held  in  a  small  room  or  the  judge’s  office,  called  the  judge’s  chambers.    In 
general, this is what you can expect to see at your hearing.   

 

 

Magistrate Court 

 

  Magistrate Judge or Clerk  
  May be less formal setting 
  Court reporter and/or 
taped recording of 
proceeding 

  Clerk of Court, who keeps 
track of official court file 

Circuit Court 

 

  Judge in robe on bench 
  More formal 
  Court reporter and/or taped 
recording of proceeding 
  Clerk of Court, who keeps 
track of official court file 

hat will happen at the hearing? 

That will also depend on the kind of court and the judge.  The chart below describes what  you can usually expect to 
happen in each of these kinds of courtrooms. 
 

agistrate Court:  The judge will probably start off by asking you to tell the court what your case is about.  It will 
also be up to you to question your witnesses and present your evidence.  The judge will probably ask questions and 
each side has the right to question the other’s witnesses. 

ircuit Court:  There are strict rules for presenting evidence and questioning witnesses in Circuit Court.  You will 
be expected to know what those rules are and follow them.  The other side may be represented by a lawyer.  In cases 
tried without a jury, the judge decides the case.  In cases tried before a jury, the judge rules on what evidence may 
be considered by jurors in reaching their verdict.  The judge also instructs the jury on points of law pertaining to the 
case. 
 

hen will the judge decide my case? 

The judge may make a decision at the hearing.  But often judges will take additional time to consider the evidence and 
the law before deciding.

MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE 
The  South  Dakota  Unified  Judicial  System  hopes  that  this  guide  has 
given  you  a  better  idea  of  how  the  court  system  works.    If  you  ever 
decide  to  go  to  court,  you’ll  know  the  basic  steps.    You  can  decide 
whether  to  hire  a  lawyer  or  you  can  do  it  on  your  own.    You  also 
understand  the  risks  you  are  taking  if  you  go  to  court  without  a 
lawyer.  Some cases work fine with a “do-it-yourself” approach.  Some 
don’t.    Keep  in  mind  that  some  cases  are  better  left  to  a  trained 
professional – if you can possibly afford it.  Just be smart.  Decide what 
is best for you. 

 

8 
 

Be respectful to everyone in court, including 
the other side – and don’t argue with the judge.  Try to stay 
calm. 

You can ask court officials for information  
about the process and what type of information to put on the 
forms.  But remember, court employees cannot tell you 
what to write on the forms or what to say at the hearing. 

Arrive early.  Most judges like to start on time. 
But some cases take longer than expected, so be prepared to 
wait. 

Tell the judge in a few brief sentences what 
your case is about and how you plan to prove the facts of 
your case.  Lawyers call this an opening statement. 

Bring the original document and at least two copies of any  
evidence you plan to use.  Write out the questions you plan 
to ask and go over them with your witnesses before the 
hearing.
