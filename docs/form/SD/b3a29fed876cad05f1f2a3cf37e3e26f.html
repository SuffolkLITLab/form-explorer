Instructions for Implementing the  
South Dakota Parenting Time Guidelines  

  
The Term “Visitation” was changed to “Parenting Time” by the South Dakota Legislature. “Parenting Time” means 
the time a parent spends with a child regardless of the custodial designation regarding the child.   
  
READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS AND REVIEW THE FORMS BEFORE BEGINNING  
  

IMPORTANT NOTICES  

•  The Court expects every person who appears in court without an attorney to know and follow the 

law. The Judge will not be able to give you any help in court.   

•  Court employees cannot help you fill out forms or give you legal advice. If you have questions, 

please consult an attorney.    

•  You must follow the instructions included in this packet.  

•  Type your answers or print neatly using dark ink.  
  

PETITION Instructions for Implementing South Dakota  
Parenting Time Guidelines  
  
REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW: Read SDCL 25-4A-16.1.  
  

• If you have a visitation, support, or custody order from a court in South Dakota;   
  

AND  
  

• You would like the South Dakota Parenting Time Guidelines included into your court Order;  

THEN YOU MAY FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO FILE A PETITION AND ASK 
THE COURT TO INCLUDE THE GUIDELINES IN YOUR CURRENT COURT ORDER:  

Fill out the Petition for Order Implementing South Dakota Parenting Time Guidelines (Form 
UJS366) and the Notice of Petition for Parenting Time Guidelines (Form UJS-367). The 
information to fill in the top part of the forms (called the Caption) can be found at the top of your 
current support or custody Order. Be sure to copy the information exactly as it appears on your 
current custody or visitation Order.    
  
Note: This Petition cannot start a civil case.   If you do not have an existing Order, you will need  
to start a new civil file in which you are the Plaintiff.  You will also need to complete and file a

Civil Case Filing Statement (Form UJS-232). If you need assistance beginning a new civil file, 
you may want to consider consulting a lawyer.  

Sign the Petition in the presence of a Notary Public. By signing your name, you are telling the  
court that you are telling the truth and have a good faith reason for your request. If you are not 
telling the truth, are misleading the court, or serving or filing this document for an improper 
purpose, the court can impose penalties.  

File the Petition and the Notice of Petition with the Clerk of Court in the county where your 
current child support, custody, visitation, or spousal support Order is filed, making sure the 
case number of the record with the current Order is provided on both documents.     
  
Note: There is no filing fee for this particular court action.  
  
For a small copy fee, the Clerk of Court can make copies of all paper work for your file and for 
you to serve on the other party.  

You must serve the Petition and Notice of Petition on the other party, which means you must give 
all the documents to the other party and must provide proof to the Court that you gave all the 
documents to the other party.      

 

The Petition and Notice of Petition can be served in two ways:  

1) 
Mail a file stamped copy of the Petition and Notice of Petition with attachments and the 
Admission of Service (Form UJS-368) to the other party. The other party is not required to sign 
the Admission of Service but may choose to sign the Admission and mail it back to you.  If the 
other party signs and returns the Admission of Service, they are considered served;   

  
Or  

If you do not think the other party will sign the Admission of Service, or if the other party 

  
2) 
refuses to sign the Admission, take your paper work to the local sheriff’s office and pay the 
sheriff’s office to serve him/her. The sheriff’s office will provide Proof of Service for the Court.  

Once you have proof that the other party was served you must file the original Proof of Service  
(either the Admission of Service or the Sheriff’s proof of his service) with the Clerk of Court.   
 
Because this proceeding involves issues of parenting time, within sixty days of the service of the 
Petition, you must complete a Court-approved parenting course per SDCL 25-4A-32. This 
requirement is met if you and the other party to this case have completed a Court-approved course 
within the last five years. The Judge can also waive the requirement, but only for good cause 
shown. You must file an Affidavit on Court-Approved Parenting Course (UJS-364) with the Clerk 
to either provide proof of meeting the requirement or to seek waiver of the requirement. If you 
seek a waiver, file the Affidavit well in advance of the deadline.

Failure to file any of these documents with the Clerk of Court may result in the dismissal of your 
case.  
 
If the other party does not object within the allowed time from the date of service, you must 
submit the Order Implementing South Dakota Parenting Time Guidelines (Form UJS-370) to the 
Clerk of Court.  Based upon the information within the Petition and the prior support/custody 
Court Order, the Judge may order the standard guidelines to be implemented and will mail both 
parties a copy of the signed Order.   
  
If, within 10 days of Service, the other party does object to the Court ordering the standard 
guidelines the Court will order a hearing and both parties will be sent a Notice of Hearing, which 
will include the hearing date set by the Court.  

Once the Objection is filed with the Court, the Clerk of Court will schedule a hearing and send all 
parties a copy of the Notice of Hearing.  You must go to court on the date set for the hearing. Be 
sure to be on time. Bring copies of your documents with you to the hearing. Do not bring 
child(ren) to the hearing. Take any proof you have or witnesses who can verify your claims and 
explain why the standard guidelines should be implemented in part or whole to the hearing with 
you. The hearing is very formal. You should be polite to everyone in the courtroom and address 
the Judge as “your honor.” Remember to talk to the Judge, not the opposing party. Do not argue 
with the other party. The Judge may issue the Order at the end of the hearing or may send a copy 
of the Order to you in the mail.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
