  SOUTH DAKOTA 

   OFFICE OF 
    HEARING  
  EXAMINERS 

  GENERAL GUIDE TO 
  ADMINISTRATIVE 
  HEARINGS 

This brochure is issued for informational 
purposes only. Nothing contained herein  
shall be inferred to bind the presiding 
Hearing Examiner, Administrative Law  
Judge, or the Bureau of Administration  
as to any practice described herein. 

 Updated January 2020 

The  purpose  of  the  Office  of  Hearing 
Examiners  is  to  provide  for  fair,  prompt,  and 
objective hearings for persons affected by actions 
of state agencies. The Office of Hearing Examiners  
conducts  all  hearings  for  the  Department  of 
the 
Revenue, 
Department  of  Public  Safety,  as  well  as  other 
agencies  wishing  to  use  the  Office.  All  hearing 
examiners are licensed attorneys in South Dakota.   

the  Division  of 

Insurance, 

This  pamphlet  is  not  a  substitute  for  having  an 
attorney.  An  individual  may  represent  himself  or 
herself.  Individuals  may  also  choose 
to  be 
represented  by  an  attorney.  Note:  Corporations 
must be represented by an attorney. Information 
about  obtaining  low-cost  legal  representation  can 
be  obtained  by  calling  the  South  Dakota  Bar 
Association / Access to Justice at 1-855-287-3510. 

The  Office  of  Hearing  Examiners  (OHE)  is 
providing  this  pamphlet  to  help  you  prepare  for 
your  administrative  hearing.  The  procedures 
outlined below are designed to accommodate both 
the  short,  simple  case  and  the  complex  case. 
However, not all cases are the same, and yours may 
be  different.  Many  of the procedures  are  optional 
with each Examiner. All cases do not proceed along 
exactly the same path. 

We cannot tell you about all possible situations that 
might  arise.  But  we  hope  this  pamphlet  will  help 
you better understand the process and prepare for 
your hearing. 

Remember:  It  is  very  important  for  you  to  read 
carefully the documents sent to you by the OHE and 
the  agency.  Those  documents  tell  you  the  issues 
involved, or the charges brought against you by the 
agency,  what  deadlines  you  must  meet,  and  your 
rights. 

HOW  WILL  I  KNOW  IF  MY  CASE  HAS 
BEEN SENT TO THE OHE? 
When a case is sent to the OHE for a hearing, the 
case will be assigned to an Examiner. You will then 

be  notified  of  the  name  of  the  Examiner  and  the 
OHE docket number for your case. This number will 
appear  in  all  documents  you  receive  from  the OHE. 
You  must  use  this number on  all  correspondence or 
filings. 

WILL I HAVE A PRE-HEARING 
CONFERENCE? 
In some cases, the Examiner or one of the parties 
will  want  to  have  a  pre-hearing  conference  to 
discuss  the  issues  in  the  case  and  answer  any 
questions before the hearing. This can be done by 
telephone.  If  you  want  a  pre-hearing  conference, 
you may contact the OHE to schedule one.  

WHO WILL DECIDE MY CASE? 
In  some  hearings,  the  Examiner  alone  will  hear 
your case. In these cases, the Examiner’s decision 
will not be made until sometime after the hearing.  

In  most  cases,  the  Examiner’s  decision  will  be  a 
written Proposed Decision which will be mailed to 
both  parties.  The  Agency  will  issue  a  Final 
Decision after receipt of the Proposed. The Agency 
may  affirm,  reject  or  modify 
the  Proposed 
Decision. That Final Decision will be sent to you as 
well.  

In  some  hearings,  your  case  will  be  heard  by  a 
Board  or  Commission  that  is  sitting  with  the 
Examiner. In these hearings, the Board, and not the 
Examiner, will make the decision on your case. The 
Board’s decision, which is called the Final Order, 
will be made at the close of the hearing. 

CAN  I  CALL  THE  EXAMINER  AND  TALK 
ABOUT MY CASE? 
You  may  call  OHE  and  ask  general  questions 
about how the hearing will be conducted, but if you 
wish to discuss specific issues in the case, it will be 
necessary  to  include  the  agency  attorney  in  the 
conversation. The Examiner and the OHE may not 
give legal advice to parties.  

WHAT WILL MY HEARING BE LIKE? 
Your hearing will be very similar to a court trial, 
with witnesses, exhibits, and rules of evidence. An 
Examiner  or  Administrative  Law  Judge  will 
preside.  The  Examiner  is  employed  by  the  OHE, 
not by the agency involved in this action. Normally, 
an  attorney  represents  the  agency  involved.  You 
may  be  represented  by  an  attorney  or  you  may 
appear on your own behalf.  

When the hearing begins, each party may present 
an opening statement. This tells the Examiner what 
that  party  intends  to  prove.  Each  party  can  then 
offer relevant evidence to prove its case. Evidence 
can  be  sworn  testimony  taken  under  oath  at  the 
hearing  or  it  can  be  certain  kinds  of  documents, 
such  as  business  records.  You  must  prove  the 
accuracy  of  documents  you  submit.  It  may  be 
helpful  to  get  the  other  side  to  agree  to  the 
admissibility of your documents.  

The  Examiner  will  determine  which  side 
presents their case first. This is based upon which 
party has the burden of proof. Each side will have 
the  opportunity  to  call  their  witness(es)  and  ask 
questions (direct examination). The opposing party 
will  have  the  opportunity  to  cross-examine  the 
witness.  There  will  also  be  an  opportunity  for 
redirect and recross examinations.  

Remember:  Before  the  hearing  closes,  you  must 
submit all the evidence you want the Examiner to 
consider. 

After  all  testimony  has  been  heard,  each  party 
can make a closing argument.  
Closing  arguments  can  address  only  those  facts 
brought  out  in  testimony  of  witnesses  or  in 
documents received into evidence. In some cases, 
the  Examiner  may  want  the  parties  to  submit 
written argument after the hearing is over. 

IS THE HEARING LOCATION ACCESSIBLE 
TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES? 
The  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (ADA) 
prohibits  discrimination  against  any  qualified 
individual  with  a  disability.  The  OHE  does  not 
permit discrimination against any individual on the 
basis of physical or mental disability in accessing 
its  programs.  In  accordance  with  the  ADA,  if 
necessary, 
the  OHE  will  provide  reasonable 
modifications in order to access all of its programs, 
services, and activities to qualified individuals with 
disabilities. 

his notice is provided as required by Title II of the 
Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  of  1990.  If  you 
need assistance, have questions, or need additional 
information,  please  contact  OHE  at  (605)  773-
6811.

f you are appearing without an attorney, you 
must keep the OHE informed of your current 
mailing address and telephone number.  

WHAT IF I CAN’T BE THERE ON THE DAY 
SET FOR HEARING? 
You  must  show  good  cause  to  change  a  hearing 
date.  Most hearings  will  be  in-person  and held  in 
Pierre.  If  you  cannot  attend  on  the  date  and  time 
shown, you must contact the OHE as soon as you 
know of the problem. To request a change of date 
(continuance),  you  may  have  to  file  a  written 
request  stating  the  reasons  for  the  change.  Make 
your  request  as  far  in  advance  of  the  hearing  as 
possible. 

HAT IF I DON’T ATTEND? 

You will likely lose your case if you do not attend. 
If an emergency arises on your hearing date and 
you will be late for the hearing, telephone the 
OHE and explain the problem.  

S  THERE  A  WAY  TO  SETTLE  THIS 
WITHOUT A HEARING? 
Cases often settle without going to hearing. Contact 
the agency attorney to see if you can work your case 
out.  It  is  appropriate  for  the  parties  to  discuss 
settlement,  and  parties  may  agree  to  resolve  a 
contested case by settlement at any time. 

AN I WITHDRAW MY APPEAL? 

If you requested the hearing and later decide not 
to  proceed,  your  request  may  be  withdrawn  any 
time  before  the  scheduled  hearing  time.  Send  a 
letter by mail, fax, or e-mail to the OHE as soon as 
possible so the other party can be notified.  

AN I APPEAL THE FINAL ORDER OF THE 

AGENCY? 
You have thirty (30) days to appeal the agency’s 
Final Order to the Circuit Court.  

AN I OBTAIN A TRANSCRIPT (WRITTEN 

RECORD) OF THE HEARING? 
Yes,  but  you  must  pay  the  cost  of  preparing  the 
transcript. There are exceptions for certain cases.

WHAT KIND OF EVIDENCE WILL I NEED  
FOR THE HEARING? 
Depending on your case, you may want to bring    
witnesses who know about the issues involved. If 
there  are  documents,  such  as  contracts,  business 
records, or checks that help prove your side, try to 
bring the original and two copies. You may bring 
photographs or other items that are relevant to your 
defense.  Items  you  want  to  be  considered  as 
exhibits  must  be  left  with  the  Examiner.  Any 
document  you  want  to  be  considered  by  the 
Examiner  must  be  admissible  under  the  South 
Dakota Rules of Evidence. 

OW DO I GET A WITNESS TO COME TO 

THE HEARING? TO BRING RECORDS? 
A  witness  can  come  voluntarily  to  the  hearing. 
However, a subpoena protects your right to have the 
person  present.  Remember:  The  hearing  is  your 
chance  to  tell  the  Examiner  your  side.  It  is 
important to have witnesses present at the hearing 
to testify. 
You also have the right to subpoena individuals to 
bring relevant records to the hearing. You may have 
to pay a fee for copying the records you are seeking. 
Contact  the  OHE  well  ahead  of  the  hearing  to 
obtain  subpoenas  to  compel  the  attendance  of  a 
person whose testimony and/or records are relevant 
to your case.  

S IT OK TO BRING LETTERS INSTEAD OF 
WITNESSES? 
Ordinarily,  evidence  is  presented  through  the 
testimony  of  witnesses.  Some  letters  may  be 
admitted  into  evidence  for  limited  purposes,  but 
generally  it  is  better  to  bring  witnesses  who  can 
help present your side of the case and answer any 
questions raised. 

F I FORGOT SOMETHING, CAN I SEND IT 
TO THE EXAMINER LATER? 
Your chance to present evidence is at the hearing.  
Only in rare cases will the Examiner allow you to 
send evidence later.

WHAT IS THE BURDEN OF PROOF?   
WHO HAS IT? 
The  burden  of  proof  is  the  duty  of  a  party  to 
present evidence to demonstrate that an allegation 
or fact is true. Some cases require the burden to be 
only a preponderance of the evidence, which means 
the  greater  weight  of  the  evidence,  or  the  more 
probable conclusion based on the evidence. While 
other cases will have a higher burden of proof, clear 
and  convincing  evidence.  Which  means  that  the 
threshold of proof is more than a preponderance but 
less than beyond a reasonable doubt.   

 H

he burden of proof is generally assigned to the 
party  who  seeks  to  change  the  present  state  of 
affairs regarding any issue. Generally, if the agency 
is  seeking  to  take  disciplinary  or  enforcement 
action against you or your license, the agency will 
have the burden of proof. 

f you are applying for a license, permit, or other 
benefit,  you  have  the  burden  of  proving  that  you 
meet the qualifications for that license, permit, or 
benefit.

AN I SEE THE AGENCY’S EVIDENCE 
AGAINST ME BEFORE THE HEARING? 
information, 
You  have  the  right 
including  a  witness 
the  agency 
(discovery). Call or write the agency attorney and 
ask to see or copy the file and any other documents 
or relevant evidence the agency has regarding your 
case.  If  you  have  any  difficulty  obtaining 
information,  you  may  contact 
the  assigned 
Examiner for possible assistance. 

ou  are  also  required  to  send  a  copy  of  your 
evidence to the  agency  before the hearing.  If  you 
bring evidence to the hearing that has not been sent 
to  the  agency  prior  to  the  hearing,  the  Examiner 
may not consider the evidence.  The Examiner will 
give you the deadline for exchanging evidence.
