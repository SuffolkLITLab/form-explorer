Guidance for Clerks Answering Questions  
Regarding Guardianships and Conservatorships  
 

Question Quick Links: 

I need to change or terminate this guardianship/conservatorship.  What do I do? 
I am not sure how to be a guardian or conservator.  What do I do? 

  Why did I receive this guardianship/conservatorship letter? 
 
 
  What should a guardianship report or conservatorship accounting look like? 
  What are the grounds for terminating a guardianship or conservatorship? 
  Why should I file a certified copy of a death certificate to terminate the 

guardianship or conservatorship on account of death? 

Why did I receive this guardianship/conservatorship letter? 

This letter is a generic reminder to all ongoing guardianships and conservatorships.  This letter 
was designed to remind guardians and conservators to update their contact information and that 
of their minor or protected person.   

The letter also provided notice that you as the guardian/conservator may be required to file an 
annual report or accounting, depending on what the court ordered in your case.  If you are not 
required to file anything, or you have already filed what you needed to for this year, that’s great. 
The letter was only meant to provide notice to update your information and direct you to 
resources that might answer the guardianship or conservatorship questions you may have.

I need to change/terminate this guardianship/conservatorship.  What do I do? 

You should contact your attorney to professionally assist you with any petition to modify or 
petition to terminate.  That should always be your first choice.

But if you would like further information regarding how to modify or terminate a guardianship 
or conservatorship, take this document that contains some relevant statutes [offer the document 
“Relevant Statutes for Administering Guardianships and Conservatorships”] and read South 
Dakota Codified Law chapter 29A-5.  You can find an electronic copy of this chapter of our 
Code on the South Dakota Legislature website.  Instructions to find that webpage are also 
provided on the front cover of the document.  You will also likely need to make a request to the 
court to change your guardianship or conservatorship. 

Note, however, that an attorney would be able to explain any wording in statute that is confusing.  
An attorney may also be able to provide you with additional, specialized information that is 
unique to your case, which you may have otherwise missed on your own.

You should contact your attorney to professionally assist you with your duties and authority as a

are and tailor the explanation to your particular guardianship or conservatorship.    

But if you would like further information regarding your duties and authority as guardian or

Also, in the coming months, a handbook from the State Bar of South Dakota should be made 
available that explains in greater detail (and in less technical language) the duties and authority 
of guardians and conservators in South Dakota. 

Question:  
What should a guardianship report or a conservatorship accounting look like?

Updated 3-31-2016 

Answer: 

You should contact your attorney to professionally assist you with filing a guardianship report or 
conservatorship accounting.  An attorney will likely clarify whether you are required to file a 
report or accounting.   An attorney also will likely be able to compile all of the relevant 
information that statute and (possibly) court order require you to provide in a report or 
accounting.   

But if you would like further information regarding your duties and authority as guardian or 
conservator, including reporting and accounting requirements, take this document that contains 
some relevant statutes [offer the document “Relevant Statutes for Administering Guardianships 
and Conservatorships”] and read South Dakota Codified Law chapter 29A-5.  You can find an 
electronic copy of this chapter of our Code on the South Dakota Legislature website.  
Instructions to find that webpage are also provided on the front cover of the document. 

Annual guardianship report forms and annual conservatorship accounting forms are available 
on the Department of Human Services’ website, at https://dhs.sd.gov/gdn/Forms2.html.  You can 
find other guardian and conservator forms there as well.  The report and accounting forms are 
available here:  

 

 

(guardianship report) https://dhs.sd.gov/gdn/LegalForms/GuardianForms1/5-
403a1%20Guardians%20Annual%20Report.pdf  
(conservatorship accounting) 
https://dhs.sd.gov/gdn/LegalForms/Conservator%20forms1/5-
408b1Conservators%20Annual%20Accounting.pdf  

While we cannot provide you information on how to fill out these documents, the statutes that 
list the information you must file with the court are, for guardian reports, SDCL 29A-5-403, and 
for conservator accountings, SDCL 29A-5-408.  They are provided in the document I just handed 
you. Also, you will need to look at the court orders in the file to see if the court required you to 
report or account for any information in addition to what is required in these statutes.  The 
Clerk’s Office also requires that you file the report or accounting on 8½x11 in. white paper, with 
single-sided printing, no holes, legibly written, and with correct case title (caption) and case 
number. You may also need to serve these documents on individuals other than the court.  Read 
SDCL chapter 29A-5 for more information.   

[If they are a conservator or guardian/conservator]:  Now, it is also possible that the court 
waived your accounting requirement entirely.  Check your file to see whether the court noted 
either in your order of appointment or in another order in the file that your accounting 
requirement was waived.  If you serve as both a guardian and conservator, however, you may 
still have a guardianship reporting requirement that was not waived.

What are the grounds for terminating a guardianship or conservatorship? 

That depends on whether your guardianship or conservatorship is for a minor or protected 
person, as ordered by the court.  You may know which type you have.  If you do not, the order of 
appointment (and, often, the caption on all of your legal documents) will indicate whether this is 
for a minor or a protected person. 

Also, you should contact your attorney to professionally assist you with terminating the 
guardianship or conservatorship.  An attorney will have the knowledge to advise you and may be 
able to terminate the guardianship or conservatorship on your behalf.    

But if you would like further information regarding your duties and authority as guardian or 
conservator, including how to and on what grounds you can terminate a guardian or 
conservatorship, take this document that contains some relevant statutes [offer the document 
“Relevant Statutes for Administering Guardianships and Conservatorships”] and read South 
Dakota Codified Law chapter 29A-5.  You can find an electronic copy of this chapter of our 
Code on the South Dakota Legislature website.  Instructions to find that webpage are also 
provided on the front cover of the document. 

Statutes outlining the grounds for terminating a minor guardianship or conservatorship can be 
found at SDCL 29A-5-505 and 29A-5-506.  These grounds for termination include the minor’s 
death, attaining age of majority, transfer of jurisdiction over the minor to another state, 
emancipation and adoption (guardianships terminated only) or otherwise after a hearing on a 
petition to terminate.  The petition to terminate is further described in SDCL 29A-5-508. 

Statutes outlining grounds for terminating a protected person guardianship or conservatorship 
can be found at SDCL 29A-5-507, and include death of the protected person, transfer of 
jurisdiction over the guardianship or conservatorship to another state, or if ordered by a court on 
a petition to terminate.  Again, the petition to terminate is further described in SDCL 29A-5-508.

Question: 
Why should I file a certified copy of a death certificate to terminate the guardianship or 
conservatorship on account of death?

Updated 3-31-2016 

For non-attorney guardians & conservators]:  SDCL 29A-1-107 outlines the ways in which a 
determination of death can be established with a court.  The most straightforward of these is the 
certified copy of a death certificate, which you may already have.  If you do not have a certified 
copy of the death certificate, you can obtain one from the County Register of Deeds Office or the 
State Office of Vital Records (207 E. Missouri, Ste. 1-A, Pierre, SD 57501).  The cost of 
obtaining a certified copy of a death certificate is $15.00 (as of March 2016).  Please feel free to 
check SDCL 29A-1-107 to see if you can provide other formal proof of death. 

[For attorneys]:  Only certain documents provide proof of death per statute.  That statute is 
SDCL 29A-1-107.  See also SDCL 29A-6-101(11) (defining “proof of death” in the non-probate 
UPC chapter as requiring “a death certificate or record or report which is prima facie proof of 
death under § 29A-1-107”).  An attorney’s representation is not listed among the documents that 
formally indicate determination of death.  See SDCL 29A-1-107.  For instance, an attorney’s 
letter is insufficient—even if liberally construed as a certificate or affidavit—because 
terminating a guardianship or conservatorship on death is not “verify[ing] a pleading, [proving] 
the service of a summons, notice, or other process in an action, [obtaining] a provisional remedy, 
an examination of a witness, a stay of proceedings, or upon a motion, and in any other case 
permitted by law.”  See SDCL 19-4-2; see also SDCL 16-18-9 (powers of attorneys to execute 
“necessary and proper” instruments on behalf of clients). 

As further support for this interpretation, the relevant guardianship forms (specifically petitions 
to terminate—Forms 5-501A.1, 5-501B.1, and 5-501C.1 for protected persons, and Forms M5-
505A.1, M5-505B.1, and M5-505C.1 for minors) on Dakota Disc assume that the death 
certificate is attached.  But please feel free to check SDCL 29A-1-107 to see if you can provide 
other formal proof of death. 

If an attorney still insists after that analysis, have them contact SCAO.
