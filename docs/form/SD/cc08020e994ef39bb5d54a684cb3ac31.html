A Roadmap of South Dakota's  
Substance Use Involuntary Commitment  
For Family and Friends 

 

                             

Rev 05/2019 
  

 

       Page 1 of 5 

Purpose 

t is very difficult to watch a loved one suffer from a substance use disorder. In certain situations, an 
intervention may be needed on behalf of that loved as he or she may not understand they need help 
or are unable to make those decisions independently.  

his roadmap provides concerned family members and friends with information regarding 

substance use disorder treatment services and the process for involuntary commitment along with 
other related resources.  

f you have any questions in regards to services or resources within the community, please contact 
the Division of Behavioral Health at 1-605-773-3123 or 1-855-878-6057 or visit the website at 
https://dss.sd.gov/behavioralhealth/. 
 

What is a substance use disorder? 

A substance use disorder is a disease which occurs when the recurrent use of alcohol and/or 
drugs causes significant impairments. Impairments may include health problems, disability and 
failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school or home.   

ddiction is a disease and not a choice your loved one is making. The addiction causes an 

individual to make choices that they would not normally make or would not have made prior to 
the addiction. Their judgement becomes clouded and their drive for substances may be the most 
important thing in their lives, even more than family and friends. It can be very hard to watch the 
addiction take over but help is available in many forms. 
 

How are services determined? 
 

An addiction counselor will meet with your loved one to complete an integrated assessment. 
Treatment services will be determined based on the completion of the assessment to best meet 
the needs of the individual. Family members and friends should always try to talk to their loved 
one first to see if they would be willing to have an assessment completed by an addiction 
counselor prior to pursuing an involuntary commitment.  

pon completion of the assessment, individuals will be given the opportunity for feedback; this 

feedback will assist your loved one in helping them to understand the destruction surrounding 
their substance use.  Family and friends may participate in the assessment process by providing 
information to the addiction counselor in order to assist in identifying appropriate treatment 
services.  

he Division of Behavioral Health accredits and contracts with several community-based 
substance use disorder treatment providers across the state to provide quality services to both 
adults and youth. Services include screenings and assessments, early intervention, detoxification, 
outpatient and inpatient treatment services. Financial assistance for services is available.

Assessments: 
An assessment includes an interview with an addiction counselor to review a person’s substance 
use and its impact on the individual’s daily life.  

arly Intervention Services: 

Early intervention services offer outpatient services to individuals who may have substance use 
related problems, but are not diagnosed with a substance use disorder. 

Outpatient Treatment Services: 
Outpatient treatment services provide counseling services to individuals diagnosed with 
substance use disorders. 

Low Intensity Residential Treatment Services: 
Low intensity residential treatment services include residential, peer-oriented treatment programs 
for individuals with substance use disorders whose living situation or recovery environment is 
incompatible with recovery goals. To prepare the client to live successfully in the community, 
the program provides substance use disorder counseling along with case management services. 

npatient Treatment Services: 
Inpatient treatment services provide residential treatment with medically monitored intensive 
treatment for individuals with severe substance use disorders. 

Detoxification Treatment Services: 
Detoxification treatment services are residential treatment services delivered by trained staff that 
provides 24-hour supervision, observation and support for individuals who are intoxicated or 
experiencing withdrawal symptoms. The goal is to motivate the individual to seek further 
treatment services. 
 

How do I know if an Involuntary Commitment needed? 

After speaking to your loved one and they decide to not seek help, it may be painful to watch, but 
remember that not all individuals will benefit from treatment services if he or she is not willing or 
wanting to recover from their disease at that time. It also does not mean the individual’s judgement 
is wrong or that he or she is in need of an involuntary commitment.  

imilar to an individual who has heart disease or diabetes, the recommended course of treatment 
may include lifestyle changes that he or she is not wanting or willing to make. This can be the case 
as well for an individual with a substance use issue. He or she may be given the resources, tools and 
support to make the changes needed but may decide not to make those steps towards recovery. 

or an individual to be appropriate for an involuntary commitment to substance use treatment, you 

will need to provide information that supports that your loved one is a substance user who 
continually lacks self-control, in regards to their alcohol and/or drug use AND 

1.  Has threatened, attempted, or inflicted physical harm on self or on another, and unless

committed, is likely to harm self or others; 

2.  Is incapacitated by the effects of alcohol or drugs; 
3.  Is pregnant and using alcohol or drugs;

If your loved one is not willing to seek help on their own and is a danger to self or others, as 
listed above, there are steps to assist you in starting the process for an Involuntary Commitment. 

Involuntary Commitment Process 

Step 1: Petition 

a)  Who May Apply:  

b)  Where to Apply:  

c)  Application:  

Any responsible person, for example, spouse, relative, friend or physician 

Clerk of Courts in the county in which the person resides or is currently present. 
The clerk of courts in South Dakota can be found here and are listed by county: 
http://ujs.sd.gov/Contact/clerkcourts.aspx. 

•  The clerk of courts will take the written application that you completed to 
the Judge, who will appoint an attorney to represent, you, the applicant, 
referred to as petitioner.  

•  Within five days, the attorney completes and submits a petition, along 

with reports from an addiction counselor, to the courts alleging that your 
loved one to be committed referred to as the respondent.  

•  Completing a petition (application) and submitting it to the court is not a 
guarantee that your loved one will be committed. A person cannot be 
committed merely because he or she is a substance user. There will need 
to be a threat, attempt, or act of physical harm to self or others or the 
likelihood that harm may occur is necessary, before the court has the 
power to commit a person.  

d)  Addiction Counselor’s Certificate: An Addiction Counselor’s certification must be 
completed within two days prior to the filing of the petition; it must support the 
allegations in the petition.  The attorney will set up the appointment with the respondent 
and a counselor. The counselor will make treatment recommendations based on the 
individual’s needs. The services may include inpatient treatment, residential treatment or 
outpatient treatment. If the respondent refuses to meet with the addiction counselor for 
completion of the certificate this will be documented in the petition.  

Step 2: Hearing:  

a)  Right to Attorney:  

b)  Time frame: 

c)  Testimony:  

The respondent has the right to have his or her own attorney. 

The court has 10 business days to have a hearing.  

The petitioner and the counselor may be asked to testify at the court hearing. The respondent will 
be present in court unless his or her presence is likely to be injurious to them. 

d)  Decision:  

Rev 05/2019 
  

The Judge will determine if commitment criteria is met based on the testimony of 
the petitioner and the addiction counselor.  If so, the court will make an order of 

 

       Page 4 of 5 

commitment to an approved treatment facility that is able to provide appropriate 
and beneficial treatment.  

Step 3: Commitment 

a)  Treatment services: The treatment will be arranged by the counselor completing the 
substance use certificate based on their treatment recommendations. The addiction 
counselor completing the assessment can’t work at the agency your loved one is 
committed to for treatment. 

b)  Involuntary commitment: The commitment period is up to 90 days and this can include 
inpatient treatment, residential treatment or outpatient treatment services. The length of 
commitment is individualized for clients’ needs at the treatment agency. If it is found that 
the likelihood of harm of infliction of physical pain upon self or others no longer exists, 
or that no further treatment is appropriate, the individual may be discharged. 

c)  Payment: Please be aware that payment for treatment services, under the involuntary 

commitment, may be assessed to the individual committed, a legally responsible relative 
or guardian, the county of residence, or billed to the Division of Behavioral Health, 
through a contract, with an approved treatment facility.
