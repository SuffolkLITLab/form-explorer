      <div id="form_text" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;padding:20px;">Here is the text we could read: 
      <pre>Both the plaintiff and the defendant should be certain of 
the date, hour, and place of trial, and be there on time. 
Although some judges may allow special arrangements 
for  a  party's  absence  in  unusual  circumstances,  failure 
of  either  party  to  appear  may  result  in  a  judgment  for 
the  other  side.  If  either  party  is  unable  to  appear  as 
scheduled, he should contact the clerk of court immedi-
ately and make arrangements to reschedule the proceed-
ings. 

At the trial either party may bring in witnesses to testify, 
and introduce other evidence (receipts, documents etc.), 
in  support  of  his  claim.  Hearsay  is  not  an  acceptable 
form of proof.  Each party is responsible for the appear-
ance  of  his  own  witnesses.  In  some  cases,  it  may  be-
come  necessary  to  subpoena  unwilling  witnesses  to 
appear, or to subpoena materials into court. Upon   re-
quest  the  clerk  of  court  will  prepare  these.  Contact  a 
clerk  of  court  office  if  a  subpoena  is  needed.  The 
requesting  party  is  responsible  for  subpoena  fee  of 
$2.00 payable to the clerk of court and any fees related 
to serving the subpoena payable to the sheriff or process 
server. 

When  testimony  is  given  at  trial,  witnesses  are  placed 
under  oath.  As  this  testimony,  and  other  evidence  (pa-
pers,  etc.),  are  introduced  to  support  the  claims  made, 
the  judge  may  ask  questions  of  the  parties  and  their 
witnesses in order to clarify the facts. After he receives 
all  necessary,  available  testimony,  the  judge  usually 
announces his   decision. However, the judge may delay 
his  decision,  and put  the judgment  in  writing  at  a  later 
date. 

A small claims judgment cannot be appealed to a higher 
court.  The  judgment  may  be  renewed  within  ten  years 
from  the  original  date  of  entry  of  judgment.  You  will 
need to file a copy of the judgment and an affidavit that 
the  money  has  not  been  completely  collected  with  the 
clerk of court.  (see SDCL 15-16-33 & 34) 

HOW DO I GET MY 
MONEY IF I WIN? 

If you are awarded a money judgment, you may ask the 
other party to pay you immediately, unless the judge has 
provided a time period for payment.  

Note:  The award of a judgment does not guaran-
tee  payment  of  the  claim.  The  court  makes  the 
decision  and  records  the  judgment,  it  does  not 
enforce  collection.  While  the  entry  of  judgment 
does  create  a  recorded  lien  against  the  debtor,  it 
does not guarantee payment of the debt. 

If the other party does not pay, you may begin a collec-
tion process called an execution. An execution is a court  
order authorizing the sheriff to seize property belonging 
to the losing party and sell it to satisfy the judgment. The 
clerk  of  court  can  provide  you  with  the  necessary  form 
for this procedure. There is a fee for the issuance of the 
execution.   

Unless  there  is  a  default  judgment  or  a  special  court 
order (ask the clerk of court if either of these apply), an 
execution  may  not  be  issued  until  thirty  days  after  the 
entry  of  judgment.  After  that  period,  it  may  be  issued 
anytime within twenty years after the date of judgment. 
(see SDCL 15-18-1 and SDCL 15-16-33 for instructions 
on  renewal  of  money  judgments  prior  to  the  expiration 
of  ten  years  from  the  first  docketing  of  the  judgment.)  
After  the  proper  time  period  has  elapsed,  the  execution 
form is completed, signed by the clerk, and given to the 
creditor. You must take it to the sheriff's office and pay a 
fee  to  the  sheriff  to have  him  execute  on  the  judgment. 
The  sheriff  then  has  sixty  days  to  find  property  of  the 
debtor to execute on. 

There  are  some  types  of  property  that  are  exempt  from 
execution, and it is sometimes difficult for the sheriff to 
find  property  that  can be  used  to  execute  the  judgment. 
When  you  take  the  execution  form  to  the  sheriff,  you 
should provide him with the current address and place of 
employment  of  the  debtor.  Also,  if  you  know  of  any 
un-mortgaged  property  which  the  debtor  owns,  you 
should  provide  this  information  to  the  sheriff  or  officer 
to whom you give the execution form. 

The sheriff may not find property to satisfy the judgment 
(but  he  still  keeps  his  fee).  You will need  to  follow the 
statutory requirements regarding judgments.  

There  are  other  procedures  available  to  collect  on  the 
judgment,  but  they  are  often  legally  complex  and  the 
assistance of an attorney may be required. There is a fee 
and it may even require another trial. (see SDCL 21-18-1, 
SDCL 21-18-2.1 and SDCL 21-18-3) 

AFTER YOU RECEIVE PAYMENT: 

After payment for the full amount of the claim has been 
received,  the  creditor  receiving  payment  should  inform 
the  clerk  in  writing  that  full  payment  has  been  re-
ceived.  The clerk will then satisfy the judgment.  Upon 
receipt  of  a  claim  by  the  debtor  that  the  judgment  has 
been  paid  in  full  but  has  not  been  satisfied  by  the 
lienholder,  the  court  shall  issue  an  order  to  show  cause 
requiring the lienholder appear and show cause why the 
judgment should not be satisfied.  Provided that no good 
cause is shown, the clerk will then satisfy the judgment. 
There is no charge for this satisfaction. This filing of the 

satisfaction  of  judgment  will  release  the  lien  that  was 
created by the entry of judgment.

INTRODUCTION 
If you think that someone has negligently or intentional-
ly  caused  you  financial  loss  or  property  damage,  your 
first thought may be to "see him in court." Don't be too 
hasty to do this. Asking the court to resolve your prob-
lem can be time consuming and troublesome, and there 
is  still  no  guarantee  you  will  get  satisfaction  for  your 
loss. 
To save the time and trouble of a small claims lawsuit, 
you  would  be  well  advised  first  to  contact  the  other 
party in the dispute and try to discuss the problem calm-
ly and objectively. Make a serious effort to arrive at an 
agreement that will settle the matter fairly. A   reasona-
ble solution worked out to the mutual benefit of willing 
parties  will  eliminate  the  stress  of  the  courtroom  con-
frontation. It will also reduce or eliminate the long term 
personal      hostility  that often  results  from  this  type  of 
grievance. 

If  your  complaint  is  against  a  business  organization, 
there  are  agencies  such  as  the  Better  Business  Bureau 
that  may  help  you  get  satisfaction.  If  your  efforts  to 
produce  a  reasonable  settlement are  not  successful,  the 
small  claims  court  remains  a  practical  alternative. 
Generally, however, the best court action, even in small 
claims, is the one that is avoided. 

THE SMALL CLAIMS COURT 
The  small  claims  court  is  an  informal  court  which   
allows people to sue for small losses of money or prop-
erty. The procedures are simple enough so that an indi-
vidual can file and handle his own claim in court. 

The  limit  set  by  the  law  for  small  claims  actions  is 
$12,000.00  or  less.  (See  SDCL  16-12C-13)  However, 
since  this  limit  may  change  from  time  to  time,  it  is 
suggested  that  the  plaintiff  (that  is  the  person  bringing 
the  action  to  court)  verify  with  the  clerk  of  court  the 
maximum amount that can be claimed. 

The parties (plaintiff and defendant) of the action must 
be at least 18 years old. If one of the parties is under the 
age of 18, his parent or guardian must represent him in 
the  action.  If  there  are  a  number  of  plaintiffs  bringing 
action  against  one  defendant,  one  of  the  plaintiffs  may 
be authorized to act for all of them. A corporation may 
be  represented  by  one  of  its  officers,  and  a  collection 
agency  may  act  for  a  client  who  has  made  proper  as-
signment of a debt. 

STARTING THE SMALL 
CLAIMS ACTION 
The small claims action must be filed either in the coun-
ty where the defendant lives, or in the county where the 
loss  occurred.  In  some  cases,  this  may  mean  that  the 
plaintiff  is  required  to  start  the  small  claims  action  by 

mail,  and  travel  to  another  county  for  the  trial.  A  civil 
case  filing  statement  must  also  be  filed  with  the  small 
claims  action.    The  clerk  of  court  in  your  own  county 
can explain the process to you and will file the necessary 
papers in the proper court. 
To start the action, the plaintiff or his attorney, on a form 
issued  by  the  clerk,  must  provide  a  signed  written 
statement,  describing  how  the  loss  or  damage  occurred. 
This  statement,  along  with  supporting  documents  (re-
ceipts, cost estimates, etc.), and the address of the plain-
tiff  and  the  defendant,  must  be  filed  with  the  clerk  of 
court. The fee for starting the action, and the postage and 
service  cost  required,  may  be  added  to  the  damages 
claimed against the defendant. 
The  fee  and  court  costs  for  filing  a  small  claims  action 
vary,  depending  on  the  amount  of  loss  claimed  and  the 
number of defendants.  These are paid by the plaintiff at 
the  time  of  filing.    These  amounts  may  be  changed  by 
law, so the plaintiff should ask the clerk about the fees or 
visit the website at http://ujs.sd.gov/.  (see SDCL 14-6-1, 
SDCL 15-39-52 and SDCL 16-2-39)

 $36.76

When  the  clerk  accepts  the  statement  of  damages 
claimed and the necessary fees, the case will be entered 
on the small claims docket. The clerk will assign the date 
by  which  the  defendant  must  answer,  or  the  date  and 
time of the hearing. This is important information and it 
should be carefully noted for future reference. 

Once the papers are filed and the action is docketed and 
placed  on  the  court  calendar,  the  clerk  will  send  the 
proper notice to the defendant by certified mail, inform-
ing him of the lawsuit being brought against him. If the 
defendant does not receive the notice by certified mail, it 
may be necessary to have the sheriff serve the notice on 
him personally. The sheriff's service will cost the plain-
tiff an additional fee, and authorization by the plaintiff is 
required. 

After receiving the notice of lawsuit, the defendant may 
contact the plaintiff in an attempt to settle the action out 
of  court.  It  is  entirely  up  to  the  plaintiff  to  decide 
whether to accept the offer of the defendant. Reasonable 
out-of-court settlement is advisable, but the plaintiff will 
not  receive  a  refund  of  the  filing  fee  or  other  costs 
should he settle out of court. If the plaintiff agrees to an 
out-of-court settlement, he must inform the clerk of court 
immediately of the settlement and cancel the lawsuit. 

WHAT SHOULD THE 
DEFENDANT DO? 
If  the  defendant,  after  receiving  notice  of  lawsuit, 
wishes  to  settle  the  dispute  without  going  to  trial,  he 
should  contact  the  plaintiff  and  try  to  arrange  a 
settlement  before  the  trial  date.  If  a  settlement  is 
reached and full satisfaction is given to the plaintiff at 
the time of agreement, the defendant should need only 
a  receipt  from  the  plaintiff.  If  the  settlement  is  ar-
ranged  for  a  future  date,  the  agreement  should  be  in 
writing and signed by both parties. 

Although, in the event of an out-of-court settlement, it 
is  the  plaintiff's  responsibility  to  contact  the  clerk  of 
court  and  cancel  the  lawsuit,  the  defendant  is  advised 
to contact the office of the clerk of court to verify the 
cancellation. 
If the defendant wishes to contest the plaintiff's claim, 
he must file an answer with the court according to the 
notice served on him. If the defendant fails to comply 
properly  with  the  notice,  he  may  lose  the  case  by 
default  and  have  a  judgment  entered  against  him  in 
favor of the plaintiff. 

The  answer  by  the  defendant  should  be  filed  in  the 
court  clerk's  office  within  the  time  limit  specified  in 
the court's notice. The defendant's answer to the notice 
should be written clearly and in plain language. It may 
deny all or any part of the claim of the plaintiff, but it 
must  specify  the  basis  for  the  denial.  In  addition,  the 
defendant's  answer  may  even  "counterclaim"  that  the 
plaintiff owes the defendant money, however, a coun-
terclaim  must  be  filed  within  the  time  frame  for  an-
swer.    (See  SDCL  15-39-66)  The  clerk  of  court  can 
explain  the  counterclaim,and  answer  any  other  ques-
tions about the required response by the defendant. 

The defendant may wish to have the action transferred 
to circuit court. The procedure for this can be found in 
the South Dakota Codified Laws. 

WHAT HAPPENS AT THE TRIAL 
Small  claims  court  provides  a  low-cost  process  for  a 
citizen  to  obtain  reasonable  compensation  for  certain 
damages  through  the  binding  decision  of  an  impartial 
judge. Each party involved has a right to tell his story 
in his own words, present testimony of witnesses, ask 
questions,  and  receive  the  courts  judgment  on  the  is-
sues presented. Either party may be represented by an 
attorney at the trial. However, because the procedures 
of  the  court  are  informal  and  the  judge  will  explain 
legal procedures, hiring a lawyer is not necessary.
