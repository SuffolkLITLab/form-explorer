      <pre>INSTRUCTIONS FOR ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE FORMS 
 
READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS AND REVIEW THE FORMS BEFORE BEGINNING 
 

YOU CAN USE THESE FORMS IF…

  You have a divorce decree, temporary order, or other civil order from a Court in South Dakota, 

or have registered your court order from another jurisdiction with a South Dakota Court. 

  The other party is aware of and has willfully disobeyed the decree, temporary order, or other 

order issued by the Court;  

MPORTANT NOTICES 

  I

 

ND 
 

  A

  The person requesting that the court issue an order is the Petitioner. The person being filed 

against is the Respondent, however, the caption of this case must appear exactly the same as it 
is on the original court order you are requesting be enforced. 
  

  An Order to Show Cause is a directive issued by the Court at a Petitioners request requiring a 
Respondent to appear and show cause as to why they have not complied with an order of the 
Court. The Motion and Affidavit for Order to Show Cause is the Petitioner’s sworn statement 
requesting the Court to issue the Order. If the Judge finds that there is not sufficient cause 
presented in the Motion and Affidavit for Order to Show Cause, the Motion and Order will be 
denied and no further action will be taken. 
 

  These forms can only be used if there is an existing court order that the Respondent is aware of 
and has willfully refused to comply with. These forms cannot be used to modify an existing 
order or request the Court issue a new one. 
 
If you do not already have one you will need to get a certified copy of the final Judgment and 
Decree of Divorce, or other civil order that you are trying to enforce, and attach it to these 
forms. You would get a certified copy from the Clerk of Courts office in the county your case 
is filed in. 
 

 

  Court employees cannot help you fill out forms or give you legal advice. If you have questions 
please consult an attorney or call the Legal Form Help Line. Type or print using dark ink. 
 

  The Court expects every person who appears in court without an attorney to know and follow 

the law. The Judge will not be able to give you any help in court.    

OLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO FILE FOR AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE. 

Fill out the caption (top part of the form) and Section 1 of the Motion and Affidavit for Order 
to Show Cause (UJS-  ). The information to fill in the caption - case name and number, 
County, and Circuit - is at the top of your current Order. Be sure to copy the information 
exactly as it is on your court order. Stop when you get to Section 2.

UJS-356 
REV. 05/2016 

DO NOT fill in Section 2 until you are in the presence of a Notary Public or a Clerk of Court. 
By signing your name you are telling the court that you are telling the truth and that you have a 
good faith reason for your requests. If you are not telling the truth, or if you are misleading the 
court, or if you are serving or filing this document for an improper purpose, the court can 
impose penalties upon you. 
 
Attach a certified copy of your current court order to the Motion and Affidavit for Order to 
Show Cause. 

Fill out only the top portion (caption) of the Order to Show Cause (UJS-    ) exactly like on 
your other orders. The Judge will complete and sign the Order to Show Cause if they order a 
hearing. 

Make copies of all paper work to keep for your files. You can also pay the clerk for copies. 

File the original Motion and Affidavit for Order to Show Cause with the certified copy of 
your court order attached, and the proposed Order to Show Cause with the Clerk of Court. The 
Clerk will file stamp your documents and give them to the judge to review. This may take a 
few days. 

Based upon the information within the Motion and Affidavit for Order to Show Cause and the 
prior court order you attached, the Judge may sign the proposed Order to Show Cause and set a 
hearing date.  If the Judge signs the order, the clerk will notify you that a date for a hearing has 
been set. The clerk will also notify you if the Judge denies your motion. You must be sure to 
include your phone number on the Motion and Affidavit for Order to Show Cause so the clerk 
will be able to contact you. If you have not heard from the clerk in 5 business days you should 
call their office back and inquire as to the status of your case. 

As soon as a hearing date has been set, you will need to come back to the Clerk’s office and get 
certified copies of all the paperwork filed for service on the other party. You will need $4 to 
pay for the certified copies.   
 
The respondent must be served with all the documents filed in the case at least 10 days before 
the hearing date, and you must provide proof to the Court that they were served. To do this you 
will take your certified paperwork to your local Sheriff’s office and pay the Sheriff to serve the 
other party. Once they have served the other party the Sheriff will give you a Proof of Service 
that you must file immediately with the Clerk of Courts office. If you cannot afford to pay for 
the service fee to the Sheriff you can ask the Clerk for a waiver form and the court may waive 
the fee. 

Failure to file proof of  service will most likely result in the dismissal of your petition.   

You must go to court on the date and time set for the hearing. Bring copies of all your 
documents with you to the hearing. Bring any proof you have or witnesses who can verify your 
claims to the hearing. If

you need a subpoena for a witness the clerk will issue one for you. Fees apply. Subpoenas 
should be issued as soon as you have filed the completed proof of service to ensure adequate 
notice. Court hearings are formal. Do not bring children to the hearing. You should be polite to 
everyone in the courtroom and address the Judge as “your honor.” Speak to the Judge only 
when directed. Do not talk or argue with the other party during the hearing. If you and the 
respondent have resolved the issue before the hearing, call the Clerk and cancel the hearing.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
