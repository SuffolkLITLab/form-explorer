found at SDCL §§ 25-7-37 & 25-7-38.  It is up to you to decide whether and how you use a lawyer 
in your case.  The law allows you to represent yourself without a lawyer, which is also known as 
proceeding pro se (pronounced “pro-say”). 

f you choose to proceed in this manner without the assistance of an attorney you must complete all 
the forms necessary.  The clerk of court’s office cannot assist you in preparing any legal 
documents, or advise you of the process.  However, you may contact the Legal Form Help Line at 
1-855-784-0004 if you have questions regarding completion of the forms.

month consecutive period, payments were ten or more days delinquent in three or more months or 
the payment was less than ninety percent of the ordered child support in three or more months.   

ou will file this action in the same file in which the last child support order was issued.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
