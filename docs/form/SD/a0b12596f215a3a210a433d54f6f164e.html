eneral Information 

  G

South Dakota judges are governed by high standards of conduct which 
define proper and improper conduct for judges in both their professional and 
personal capacities. These standards are set forth in the South Dakota Code 
of Judicial Conduct, SDCL ch. 16-2, Appx. Under these standards of conduct, 
judges must: 

•  Uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary; 
•  Avoid impropriety and appearance of impropriety in all of their 

activities; 

•  Perform the duties of judicial office impartially and diligently; 
•  Conduct their extra-judicial activities as to minimize the risk of conflict 

with judicial obligations; and 

•  Refrain from inappropriate political activity. 

Discipline of judges in South Dakota is conducted by the Judicial 
Qualifications Commission pursuant to South Dakota Constitution, Article V, 
section 9 and SDCL ch. 16-1A. The rules governing judicial disciplinary 
proceedings are provided in the Appendix to SDCL ch. 16-1A at section III. 

he Judicial Qualifications Commission receives, investigates and evaluates 

allegations of judicial misconduct. Although the Judicial Qualifications 
Commission reviews complaints about judges, it is an independent entity, 
separate from the South Dakota Judicial Branch. 

he Commission on Judicial Qualifications consists of seven members: 

•  Two judges of the circuit court, elected by the judicial conference; 
•  Three members of the bar practicing law in this state, no more than 
two of whom may be of the same political party, appointed by a 
majority vote of the state bar commissioners; and 

•  Two citizens who are not of the same political party, appointed by the 

Governor. 

The term of office for a commission member is four years. No person may 
serve more than two terms as a member of the commission.  

iling a Judicial Application 

Judicial announcements are published in the State Bar Newsletter. 
Applications may be obtained from either the UJS website or from the 
Secretary of the Commission. The commission shall require completion of a 
questionnaire which shall include questions relating to the background and 
qualifications of the applicant, a waiver of confidentiality of all materials 
necessary to adequately investigate each applicant, including, but not 
limited to, disciplinary records of the South Dakota State Bar Disciplinary 
Board, any other bar association disciplinary records, and records 
maintained by any law enforcement agency. The investigation will be 
conducted in a professional manner but may not be entirely confidential. 
There may be additional investigations and contacts made by JQC members 
if deemed appropriate. In addition to the application, an applicant will be 
required to submit two examples of legal articles, books, briefs, or other 
legal writings, which reflect his/her personal work. Finally, a credit report 
with credit score not more than 30 days old will need to be submitted.  

hereafter, Commission will schedule interviews and will interview all 
candidates. By majority vote, the commission shall select two or more 
qualified persons to fill each judicial vacancy from the list of those persons 
interviewed who meet the requirements of the South Dakota Constitution, 
these Rules, and all other legal requirements for the judicial office. 

he names of such nominees selected by the commission shall be submitted 

to the governor in alphabetical order along with a copy of all investigative

information and documents relating to each nominee. 

iling a Complaint 

The procedure for filing a complaint for misconduct against a judge in South 
Dakota is described in SDCL ch. 16-1A, Appx.III(2). 

lease use the complaint form which may be downloaded from this site. Any 

person wishing to file a complaint against a judge should state the facts of 
his or her particular situation as clearly and as specifically as possible. Under 
the rules, the complaint must allege facts which would demonstrate: 
 

•  A violation of the Judicial Code of Conduct (Appendix to SDCL ch.16-2) 

•  Willful misconduct in office; 
•  Habitual intemperance; 
•  Disability that seriously interferes with the performance of the judge’s 

(see above); 

duties; or 

•  Violation of any constitutional provisions or statutes or conduct that is 
prejudicial to the administration of justice and brings a judicial office 
into dispute. 

Complaints filed against judges must be written and may be directed to: 

Secretary 
Judicial Qualifications Commission 
500 E. Capitol Ave. 
Pierre, SD 57501 

-mail complaints are not allowed.  

f you choose to submit an anonymous complaint, your complaint may not 
be able to be investigated by the Judicial Qualifications Commission if the 
complaint is incomplete or if more information is needed from you in order 
to proceed. 

nvestigation and Hearings 
The Secretary of the Judicial Qualifications Commission will distribute the 
written complaint to all members of the Commission. You will receive notice 
from the Secretary that your complaint was received. Review and 
investigation of the complaint will be conducted according to the rules 
governing judicial disciplinary proceedings.

nder these rules, the complaint may be forwarded to the judge complained 
against. You will receive notice from the Secretary if this happens. The judge 
is given ten days to respond, and you will receive a copy of the judge’s 
response and be given an opportunity to reply. The response and your reply 
will be provided to all Commission members. 

f the Commission decides to issue a private reprimand, you will receive 
notice that no formal disciplinary action will be taken. A private reprimand is 
a written reprimand of the judge by the Commission. However, the 
Commission may proceed to formal disciplinary proceedings which may 
include a hearing. You will be notified by the Secretary of the final outcome 
of any formal disciplinary proceeding.  

he Commission dismisses unfounded complaints. 

urpose for Judicial Discipline 

The purpose of a disciplinary action involving a judge is, first and foremost, 
to protect the public. Under the rules, disciplinary proceedings are 
confidential until they reach the point of the Commission’s filing its 
recommendation with the Supreme Court or the accused judge requests that 
the matter be made public. The matter is also public if the disciplinary 
investigation is based upon conviction of a judge for commission of a crime 
that is a felony under state or federal law, or is one involving moral 
turpitude. 

n honest disagreement about the outcome of a case is not cause for 

discipline. A mistake or error of judgment is also not cause for discipline. In 
those matters, the litigants may file an appeal of their case in the 
appropriate court.  

requently Asked Questions 

1. Will my identity be revealed to the judge? 

  U

  I

  T

  P

  A

  F

Generally, yes. The Judicial Qualifications Commission notifies judges 
about complaints unless there is an overriding reason to withhold this 
information. 

2. Will my complaint be made public? 

Usually, no, although a complaint may become public if the Judicial 
Qualifications Commission files formal charges against the judge with 
the Supreme Court or if the judge requests the matter be made public. 

3. Will filing a complaint with the Judicial Qualifications Commission 

change the decision in my lawsuit? 

No. Judicial Qualifications Commission proceedings have no effect on 
decision or appeals. 

4. Will my complaint automatically disqualify the judge from further 

involvement in my case? 

No. The Judicial Qualifications Commission will only review your 
complaint to determine whether or not misconduct has occurred. 
Disqualification is determined in court proceedings by a judge. 

5. Does the Judicial Qualifications Commission act on all complaints? 

Yes. Every complaint is reviewed by the staff and the Judicial 
Qualifications Commission. 

6. Should I delay any appeal until this request for disciplinary action is 

concluded? 

No. The Commission reviews only questions of ethical conduct. It does 
not have authority to review the merits of a judicial decision. If the 
substance of your complaint is about the merits or outcome of your 
case or a particular ruling, you should talk with your attorney about 
the proper course of action, including whether or not to file an appeal. 
If you seek to change the outcome of your case, discuss this with a 
lawyer without delay. 

7. If my complaint is justified, will the Judicial Qualifications Commission 

tell me how the judge was disciplined? 

Yes. At the close of the case you will receive a letter describing the 
action taken. 

8. What are some examples of judicial misconduct? 

Some examples are: 

• 

Improper courtroom demeanor or improper treatment of parties, 
counsel, witnesses, jurors, court staff and others. 

•  Failing to promptly dispose of judicial business. 
•  Conflict of interest. 

•  Chemical abuse. 
•  Engaging in improper election campaign activities. 
•  Receipt of information about a case outside the presence of a party. 
•  Failure to be impartial. 

9. What if I think the judge’s ruling was wrong? 

A judge’s error in a decision or ruling – by itself – is not misconduct. 
Appeal may be the only remedy for such an error, or there may be no 
remedy. Orders as to custody, visitation and setting child support, as 
well as fines and sentences in traffic or criminal cases – if not outside 
the parameters set by law – are generally within the discretion of the 
trial court and are not usually matters for the Commission.  

he Commission does not have the authority to direct a judge to take 

legal action, or to review a case for judicial error, mistake or other 
legal grounds. These functions are for the State’s appellate courts. 

llegations stemming from a judge’s rulings or exercise of discretion 

do not provide a basis for the Commission’s action, and personal 
dissatisfaction alone cannot be grounds for judicial investigation. 

  T

  A

10. What can’t the Commission do? 

The Commission is not an appellate court. The Commission’s authority 
is limited by law to investigating the complaint and, if appropriate, 
disciplining the judge. The Commission does not have the authority to 
issue orders in any case, including ordering anyone to be released 
from jail, granting a new trial, disqualifying a judge from hearing a 
case, assigning a new judge to a case or granting or changing custody, 
visitation or child support orders. Neither the Commission nor its staff 
is authorized to give legal advice or respond to requests for assistance 
with individual legal matters. 

Members of the Judicial Qualifications Commission and the South Dakota 
Supreme Court appreciate your interest in our state judges and the high 
standards of professional conduct set forth for them by the South Dakota 
Code of Judicial Conduct.
