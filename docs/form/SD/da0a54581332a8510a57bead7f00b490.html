nforcement. 
These Guidelines are required to be served with the Summons and Complaint in a divorce, paternity 
action or any other custody action or proceeding.  See https://ujslawhelp.sd.gov/onlineforms.aspx under 
divorce or paternity actions for instructions on how to initiate an action (service of summons).   

f the parents are able to agree to a schedule other than the guidelines, these Guidelines should be used 
as a minimum direction in creating the parenting time plan.  Parents should agree to parenting times 
that they find reasonable and in the best interest of their children and the Parenting Guidelines are not 
intended to prevent such agreements. 

f the parents are unable to agree on a parenting plan, these Guidelines become mandatory as the 
parenting plan and are enforceable as a court order upon initiation of a divorce or court action 
involving custody.  SDCL 25-4A-11.  If you disagree with the use of these Guidelines as your parenting 
time plan, either parent has the right to object.  Your written objection shall be filed with the Clerk.  
After it is filed, a hearing will be held and the Judge will determine your parenting time schedule.  
Instructions and this objection form can be found at https://ujslawhelp.sd.gov/defendants.aspx.

Newborns (birth to 3 months) and infants (3 – 6 months) have a great need for 
continuous contact with their primary caregiver, but also frequent contact with both 
parents who provide a sense of security, nurturing and predictability.   

Generally, overnights for very young children is not recommended unless the parents are 
both very closely attached to the children, are able to personally provide primary care, 
the children are adaptable, and the parents are cooperative.   

Older children are able to tolerate more and longer separations from one parent or the 
other.

The following Guidelines for children under age 5 are designed to take into account childhood 
developmental milestones.  Since children mature at different rates, these may need to be adjusted to 
fit the children’s individual circumstances.   

.2. Birth until 3 Months.  Three, 2-hour parenting time periods per week and one weekend parenting 
time period for 6 hours.  In situations where both parents have been engaged in an ongoing caregiving 

nstructions and forms regarding enforcement can be found at

routine with a nursing child, overnights are allowed to continue as much as possible to provide the same 
caregiving arrangement to the child and maintain stability for the child.  If applicable, breastfeeding shall 
be accommodated, but the parents must cooperate in working out alternatives.  See 1.8 below. 

.3.  3 – 6 Months. Recognizing the amount of time each parent spent with the children prior to the 
parents’ separation and/or since that time, alternative parenting plans are recommended: 

Three, 3-hour custodial periods per week and one weekend day for 6 hours.  If applicable, breast 
feeding shall be accommodated but the parents must cooperate in working out alternatives; or 

Three, 3-hour custodial periods per week and one overnight on a weekend not to exceed 18 
hours, if the parent is capable of personally providing primary care.  See exceptions in Section 1.8 
below; or 

In situations where both parents have been engaged in an ongoing caregiving routine with a 
child, overnights are allowed to continue as much as possible to provide the same caregiving 
arrangement to the children and maintain stability for the children.   

.4.  6 – 12 Months. Recognizing the amount of time each parent spent with the children prior to the 
parents’ separation and/or since that time, alternative parenting times are recommended: 

Three, 4-hour parenting time periods per week and one weekend day for 6 hours; or 

Three, 4-hour parenting time periods per week and one overnight on a weekend not to exceed 
18 hours, if the child is not breastfeeding and the parent is capable of personally providing 
primary care; or 

Children spend time in alternate homes, but spends significantly more time in one parent’s home 
and no more than 1-2 overnights spaced regularly throughout the week at the other parent’s 
home; or 

In situations where both parents have been engaged in an ongoing caregiving routine with a 
child, overnights are allowed to continue as much as possible to provide the same caregiving 
arrangement to the children and maintain stability for the children.   

.5.  12 – 36 Months.  Recognizing the amount of time each parent spent with the children prior to the 
parents’ separation and/or since that time, alternative parenting times are recommended:

Children spends time in alternate homes, but with significantly more time in one parent’s home 
with 1-2 overnights spaced regularly throughout the week.  This arrangement requires adaptable 
children; or 

In situations where both parents have been engaged in an ongoing caregiving routine with the 
children (nursing or otherwise), overnights are allowed to continue as much as possible to 
provide the same caregiving arrangement to the children and maintain stability for the children.   

.6.  3 Years – 5 Years. Recognizing the amount of time each parent spent with the children prior to the 
parents’ separation and/or since that time, alternative parenting times are recommended: 

One overnight parenting time period not to exceed 24 hours and two additional 8-hour parenting 
time periods each week, separate from the overnight, with the children returning to the other 
parent’s home at least 1 hour before bedtime; or 

Two to three overnights at one home, spaced throughout the week, the remaining time at the 
other parent’s home.  This arrangement requires adaptable children; or 

In situations where both parents have been engaged in an ongoing caregiving routine with the 
children, overnights are allowed to continue as much as possible to provide the same caregiving 
arrangement to the children and maintain stability for the children.   

f the parents cannot agree on which provision shall apply in sections 1.2 through 1.6, the parties shall 
use option 1 until further order of the court.  Absent special circumstances as determined by the court,  
parenting time shall not decrease from one age category to the next.  

.7.  Children in Day Care.  In families where children are in day care before and/or after parental 
separation, the children may be able to tolerate more time with each parent earlier than their specific 
age group indicates above because the children are accustomed to separations from both parents.   

.8.  Breastfeeding Children. – Parents must be sensitive to the special needs of breastfeeding children. 
Children’s basic sleeping, feeding, and waking cycles should be maintained to limit disruption in the 
children’s routine. Forcibly changing these routines due to the upheaval of parental disagreement is 
detrimental to the physical health and emotional well-being of the children. On the other hand, it is 
important that the children be able to bond with both parents.  

 

a.  For children being exclusively breastfed, the nursing child can still have frequent 

parenting time with the other parent. The amount of time will be guided by/subject to 
the infant’s feeding schedule, progressing to more time as the child grows older. Both 
parents should be mindful that a feeding may occur, and the child may return to time 
with the other parent after the feeding.

b.  Where both parents have been engaged in an ongoing caregiving routine with a nursing 
child, the same caregiving arrangement should be continued as much as possible to 
maintain stability for the children.  
 

c.  If the other parent has been caring for the children overnight or for twenty-four hour 
periods while the nursing mother sleeps or works, that arrangement should/shall 
continue.  
 

d.  A mother may not use breastfeeding to deprive the other parent of time with the 

children. If, for example, a nursing mother uses day care or a babysitter for the children, 
the same accommodations (i.e., bottle feeding with breast milk or formula, or increased 
time between breast feeding sessions) used with the day care provider or babysitter will 
be used with the other parent, if the other parent is capable of personally providing the 
same caregiving.  

.9.  Holidays.  For children aged 0-5 years, when the parents live and/or celebrate the holiday in the 
same or a nearby community, the parents shall alternate the following holidays in the chart below.  Prior 
to a child’s 5th birthday, holiday parenting time shall not exceed the longest period of parenting time 
currently being exercised and shall be scheduled by the parent exercising holiday time.  If the parents 
cannot otherwise agree, the holiday time shall be exercised within the time frames provided in the chart 
below not to exceed the longest period of parenting time currently being exercised.  It is recommended 
that the parents communicate two weeks in advance about who is exercising what time period for the 
holidays set forth below.   Parenting time, however, shall not be withheld solely for failure to abide by 
this two-week recommendation.

.10.  Vacation With Children 3 – 5 Years Old.  Upon 30 days advance written notice (by mail, email or 
text message), each parent is entitled to two separate periods of uninterrupted time for up to 5 days 
each with their children each year, not to conflict with the other parent’s holiday parenting time. 
Parents are encouraged to coordinate vacation plans.  The parents shall consider extending the 5 day 
time periods to 7 days if the children are adaptable and accustomed to spending time with both parents. 

.11.  Long-Distance Parenting.  When substantial distance between the parents exists, the ability to 
exercise these Guidelines is compromised. The parents will need to create a developmentally 
appropriate parenting plan for their unique situation.  When parenting time is unable to be frequent, 
parents are encouraged to use video/audio contact to build and/or maintain the bond between the 
children and parent who lives afar.  

uideline 2. For Parents Who Have Children Age 5 and Older And Reside No 

More Than 200 Miles Apart.  

.1.  Weekends.  In most cases, it is a positive experience for the children to have both parents involved 
in taking the children to and from school.  Parenting time shall consist of alternate weekends starting 
Friday upon the release of school or 3:15 p.m., whichever is applicable, and continuing until the return 
to school Monday or 8:00 a.m., whichever is applicable.  Parenting time shall be an equivalent period of 
time if a parent is unavailable on weekends and the children do not miss school.

2.2.  Mid-Week.  If time and distance allow, parenting time shall include one mid-week overnight every 
week, in addition to the weekends in 2.1 above, with the children.  If the parents cannot otherwise 
agree, this mid-week time shall be on Wednesdays and shall start when the children are released from 
school or at 3:15 p.m., whichever is applicable, and concludes when the children are returned to school 
the next day or at 8:00 a.m., whichever is applicable.  All transportation for the midweek parenting time 
is the responsibility of the parent exercising the parenting time. 

.3.  Summer Break.  The children shall be with each parent for one-half of the school summer break.  
Summer break begins the day after school is released and ends the day before school commences.  The 
parent with whom the children reside the majority of the time during the school year has priority to 
have the children the week before school resumes, which counts as part of that parent’s summer break.  
At the option of the other parent, his/her parenting time during summer break may be consecutive or it 
may be split into 2 or more blocks of time.  This parent shall provide a minimum of 30 days advance 
notice of the dates selected.   

f the children go to summer school and it is impossible for a parent to schedule time other than during 
summer school, the parent may elect to take the time when the children are in summer school and 
transport the children to the summer school sessions at the children’s school or an equivalent summer 
school session in that parent’s community. 

he parent with whom the children reside for the majority of the school year shall have the weekend 
before the beginning and the weekend after the end of the other parent’s summer period, regardless of 
whose weekend it may be.  This weekend time will not be made up.    

uring any summer vacation parenting times of three or more consecutive weeks, the parent exercising 
parenting time shall arrange for a mutually convenient 48-hour continuous period of time for the other 
parent to spend with the children. 

.4.  Holidays. The following chart shows the allocation of the holidays between parents.  School breaks 
and release times may be different from school to school and district to district. The school calendar is 
published on your children’s school’s website before each school year starts.  It is important to know 
these dates / times as they pertain to your children.

parenting time shall be with all of the children not just 
the one who has the birthday. 
Starts 8:00 a.m. on date of birthday – 8:00 a.m. the next 
day (If the birthday falls on a holiday, the parenting 
time for the birthday shall take place the day before). 
Starts 8:00 a.m. on date of birthday – 8:00 a.m. the next

.5.  Conflicts Between Regular and Holiday Weekends.  When there is a conflict between a holiday 
weekend and the regularly scheduled weekend time, the holiday takes precedence.  Unless mutually 
agreed in writing, there will be no makeup parenting time in conflicts between holiday weekend and the 
regularly scheduled weekend time. This may result in one parent having the children for three weekends 
in a row; however, neither parent shall have the children for more than 3 weekends in a row. 

.6.  Parent’s Vacation with Children Age 5 and Older.  Each parent is entitled to a vacation with the 
children totaling up to 14 days, with 7 days being the most that may be exercised at one time.  When 
possible, each parent shall provide the other with 30 days advance notice of their intent to utilize their 
vacation time.  Parents are encouraged to coordinate vacation plans.  In the event there is a dispute, the 
mother gets priority in choosing her vacation periods first in even-numbered years and the father gets 
priority in choosing his vacation periods first in odd-numbered years. 

.8.  Precedence.  The allocation of holidays listed in the above chart shall take precedence over 
vacations.  In other words, a parent cannot exercise their vacation with the children when it is the other 
parent’s holiday.  But vacations shall take precedence over the regular parenting time schedule. 

.9.  Notice of Canceled Time With the Children.  Whenever possible, each parent shall give a minimum 
of three days’ notice of intent not to exercise all or part of the scheduled time with the children.  When 
such notice is not reasonably possible, the maximum notice permitted by the circumstances, and the 
explanation, shall be provided to the other parent.  

.10. Pick Up and Return of Children.  When the parents live in the same area/community, the 
responsibility for picking up and returning the children shall be shared. The parent who receives the 
children for his/her parenting time will pick the children up from the other parent.  Both parents have an 
obligation to be punctual and to arrive at the agreed upon time, not substantially earlier or later. 
Repeated, unjustified violations of this provision may subject the offender to court sanctions.

.2.  Summer Break.  The parent with whom the children do not reside during the school year shall have 
the children for the children’s summer break as follows:  summer break begins 3 days after school is 
released and ends 7 days before school recommences. This allows 10 days of parenting time during the 
summer with the parent with whom the children reside during the school year.  Additionally, the parent 
with whom the children reside during the school year shall be entitled to exercise a 48 hour period of 
parenting time with the children every three weeks during the summer break; to be exercised at the sole 
expense of the parent with whom the children reside during the school year. 

.3.  Priority of Summer Time With Parent.  Parenting time in the summer with the parent who lives 
more than 200 miles away takes precedence over summer activities (such as sports) when the parent’s 
time cannot be reasonably scheduled around such events. Even so, the conscientious parent will often 
be able to enroll the children in a similar activity in the parent’s community. When each child reaches an 
age and maturity where activities are very important to them, the parents should reach an agreement 
that works best for the child.  

.4.  Notice.  At least sixty (60) days’ notice (recommended to be by mail, email, or text message) shall 
be given by the parent who lives more than 200 miles away from the children of the date for 
commencing extended summer parenting time with the children so that the most efficient means of 
transportation may be obtained and the parents and the children may arrange their schedules. Failure to

give the precise number of days’ notice does not entitle the parent with primary residence of the 
children the right to deny the other parent parenting time with the children. 

.5. Additional Time With the Parent Who Lives More Than 200 Miles Away.  The parent who resides 
more than 200 miles away from the children shall have the following parenting time: 
 

If the parent who lives more than 200 miles away wants to travel, at his/her sole expense, 
to visit with his/her children, this parenting time shall be accommodated for a reasonable 
time period of no less than 48 hours.  However, this is not intended to be exercised more 
than every other weekend; 

Where distance and finances permit, additional parenting time for the parent residing 
more than 200 miles away from the children, such as holiday weekends or special events, 
is encouraged.  Parents are encouraged to reference the holiday schedules set forth in 
Section 2.4 when determining the allocation and duration of other holidays; and 

When the parent who lives 200 miles away is in the area where the children reside, or the 
children are in the area where this parent resides, liberal time with the children based on 
the circumstances must be allowed.  Circumstances will vary and may only allow for a 
quick visit or may allow for overnight parenting time.   

The children may miss some school to spend time with the parent who lives 200 miles away, so long as it 
does not substantially impair the children’s academic progress.  However, additional time with the 
parent who lives more than 200 miles away from the child shall not interfere with the alternating 
holiday schedule set forth in Section 3.1 herein. 

arents are encouraged to communicate with each other and cooperate in creating additional parenting 
times for the children.  If the additional parenting time exceeds 4 hours, the parent who lives more than 
200 miles away shall provide as much advance notice as possible, preferably 30 days.  Failure to provide 
notice shall not be the sole reason for denial of additional parenting time.   

uideline 4.  General Rules Applicable to All Parents 

.1.  Rules of Conduct. A parent shall always avoid speaking negatively about the other parent and must 
firmly discourage such conduct by relatives or friends.  Each parent should speak in positive terms about 
the other parent in the presence of the children.  Each parent shall encourage the children to respect 
the other parent.  Children should never be used by one parent to spy or report on the other parent.   

.2.  Relatives.  Children will usually benefit from continued contact with all relatives on both sides of 
the family.  Such relationships should be protected and encouraged.  But relatives, like parents, need to 
avoid being critical of either parent in front of the children.  Parents should have their children maintain 
ties with both the maternal and paternal relatives.  Usually the children will visit the paternal relatives

during times when the children are with their father and the maternal relatives during times when they 
are with their mother.  This may include allowing the children to spend time with these relatives even 
when the parent is not present. 

.3.  Relocation. Relocation is governed by South Dakota state law.  See SDCL 25-4A-17.  Instructions and 
forms on how to comply with the requirements surrounding relocation, as well as how to object to a 
parent’s notice of relocation, can be found at www.ujslawhelp.sd.gov.  

.4.  Communication between Parents.  Parents must always keep each other advised of their home 
and work addresses and telephone numbers.  Whenever possible and unless otherwise stated herein, all 
communication concerning the children must be conducted directly between the parents (i.e., in person, 
by telephone, email, text message, communication notebook, a designated third party or co-parenting 
tool).  Absent an emergency, communication should not occur at a parent’s place of employment. 

.5.  School and Medical Information.  Both parents shall keep the other parent informed with the 
name, address and telephone number of the school where each of their children attends and each 
parent is authorized to communicate concerning the children directly with the school and with the 
children’s doctors and other professionals, outside the presence of the other parent.  Each parent has an 
obligation to contact the school to ensure receipt of class schedules, school report cards, notices, etc. so 
that they can remain involved with their children’s education.  Both parents shall be listed as a parent 
and emergency contact on all of the children’s records, forms, registrations, etc.  Attendance at 
academic or disciplinary meetings pertaining to the minor children shall be limited to the parents and 
the respective school professional(s). Others may not attend such meetings without advance mutual 
parental agreement or court order.   
 

Each parent shall immediately notify the other parent of any medical emergencies or serious 

illnesses of the children.  Access to records and information pertaining to minor children, including, but 
not limited to, medical, dental, therapy, counseling, orthodontia and similar health care and school 
records must be made equally available to both parents.  The parents must make reasonable efforts to 
ensure that the name and address of the other parent is listed on all such records.  If children are taking 
medications, both parents shall have access to a sufficient amount for their parenting time as well as the 
instructions.  

he parent who has medical insurance coverage on the children shall supply to the other parent 
an insurance card or copy thereof and, as applicable, insurance forms and a list of insurer-approved or 
HMO-qualified health care providers in the area where the other parent is residing.  Except in 
emergencies, the parent taking the children to a doctor, dentist or other provider not so approved or 
qualified may be required to pay the additional cost for that provider.  However, when there is a change 
in insurance, which requires a change in medical care providers and a child has a chronic illness, 
thoughtful consideration shall be given by the parents to what is more important, i.e., allowing the child 
to remain with the original provider or the economic consequences of changing carriers.  When there is 
an obligation to pay medical expenses, the parent responsible for paying shall be promptly furnished 
with the bill, and where applicable, the explanation of benefits, by the other parent.  The parents shall

SOUTH DAKOTA PARENTING GUIDELINES 

Page 13 of 17 

Rev. 10/2021 – Form UJS 302 

 
 

 
cooperate in submitting bills to the appropriate insurance carrier.  Thereafter, the parent responsible for 
paying the balance of the bill shall make arrangements unless previously paid by the other parent.  
Insurance refunds shall be promptly turned over to the parent who paid the bill for which the refund 
was received. 

.6.  Extracurricular Activities.  Both parents shall consult the other parent prior to enrolling the 
children in any event that may affect the other parent’s parenting time.  Both parents shall be listed as a 
parent and emergency contact on all of the children’s records, forms, registrations, etc.  Both parents 
shall be provided access to the name of the coach, director, and organization providing the activity for 
each child along with their contact information.  Both parents shall have the obligation to contact the 
activity director to ensure receipt of information such as practice schedules, games, parental 
participation, etc. 

.7.  Clothing.  In situations where the children reside primarily with one parent, that parent shall send 
an appropriate supply of children’s clothing with the children for the other parent’s parenting time.  At 
the conclusion of his/her parenting time, this clothing shall be returned clean (when reasonably 
possible).  Parents must advise, as far in advance as possible, of any special activities so that appropriate 
clothing for the children may be sent.  It is recommended that both parents have some basic clothing 
available in their home to ensure that all of the children’s basic needs are met.   

.8.  Withholding Support or Time with the Children.  Neither time with the children nor child support is 
to be withheld because of either parent’s failure to comply with a court order.  Only the court may enter 
sanctions for non-compliance.  Children generally have a right both to support and, time with both 
parents, neither of which is dependent upon the other.  In other words, if the parent ordered to pay 
child support fails to do so, he/she is still entitled to their parenting time.  Likewise, if one parent denies 
the other parent parenting time, child support payments must still be made.  
 

Forms and instructions on how to enforce your parenting time can be found on the  
South Dakota Legal Self-Help Center at https://ujslawhelp.sd.gov/onlineforms.aspx. 

.9.  Adjustments in Parenting Plan.  Parents are expected to fairly modify the parenting plan as family 
necessities, illnesses, weather or commitments reasonably so require.  The parents must work together 
in good faith to get any missed parenting time rescheduled to occur within a reasonable period of time, 
usually within 30 days.  When possible, each parent must timely advise the other when scheduled 
parenting time with the children cannot be exercised. 

.10.  Children of Different Ages.  It usually makes sense for all the children to share the same schedule 
of parenting time.  Having brothers or sisters along can be an important support for children.  Because it 
is intended that parenting time with the children be a shared experience between siblings and, unless 
these Guidelines or a court order provides otherwise, all the children shall enjoy parenting time 
together.  Parents shall consider the children’s best interests when scheduling parenting time especially 
for newborns and infants who may have developmental needs that may prevent them from immediately 
experiencing the same schedule as their older siblings.  Additionally, older teenagers’ special needs for

Rev. 10/2021 – Form UJS 302 

 
 

 
peer involvement and for some control of their own lives may place them on different schedules from 
their younger brothers and sisters.   

.11.  Communication with Children.  Unless prohibited by a court order, either parent may mail, call, 
text, email, FaceTime or skype (or use similar technology) to communicate with the children at 
reasonable times and with reasonable frequency during those periods the children are with the other 
parent.  The children may, of course, mail, call, text, email, FaceTime or skype (or use similar technology) 
to communicate with either parent, at reasonable hours or with reasonable frequency.  

  Parents are cautioned that communication between the parent and the children should not be so 
excessive as to interfere with the other parent’s time, nor used to undermine the other parent’s 
authority.  

  During long vacations, the parent with whom the children are on vacation is required to make 
the children available for telephone calls with the other parent at least every three days.  

  At all other times, the parent the children are with must not refuse to answer the other parents 
telephone calls or turn off their telephone in order to deny the other parent telephone contact.  
If a parent uses an answering machine or cell phone voicemail, messages left should be returned 
to that person as soon as possible.  

 

  Parents should agree on a specified time for calls to the children so that the children will be 

made available no less than three days a week.  

  Either parent may provide the children with a cell phone subject to each parent’s ability to set 

restrictions in their home. A parent shall not prohibit contact between the children and the other 
parent; nor shall they impede the children’s ability to contact the other parent during reasonable 
times and at a reasonable frequency.   

  Communication between a parent and the children must not be censored, recorded, or 

monitored, absent a court order.  

  Each parent shall have an unrestricted right to send cards, letters and/or packages to their 

children.  The children shall also have the same right to receive and send items to their parents.   
 

4.12. Social Media.  Each parent shall have full access to monitor the social media accounts of the 
children, but neither shall open or read communications between the children and the other parent.  

.13.  Privacy of Residence.  A parent shall not enter the residence of the other parent except by 
express invitation, regardless of whether a parent retains a property interest in the residence. Unless 
otherwise indicated herein, the children shall be picked up and returned to the front entrance of the 
other parent’s residence. The parent dropping off the children shall not leave until the children are 
safely inside the other parent’s residence. Parents must refrain from surprise visits to the other parent’s 
home.  

.14.  Refusal / Hesitation by Children.  Parents should always encourage the children to attend 
parenting time with the other parent absent circumstances outlined in the “Scope of Application” 
provision on page 3.  Parents shall not deny parenting time with the other parent solely based on the 
refusal of the children.

4.15.  Special Considerations for Adolescents.  While children never get to choose where they live, the 
parents should honestly and fairly consider their teenager’s wishes regarding time with a parent.  
Neither parent shall attempt to influence their teenager’s wishes on parenting time.  Teenagers should 
explain the reason for their wishes directly to the affected parent, without intervention by the other 
parent.  

.16.  Daycare Providers.  When parents reside in the same community, they should use the same day 
care provider. To the extent feasible, the parents should rely on each other to care for the children when 
the other parent is unavailable. 

.17.  Parents in the Armed Services.  When one or both parents are serving in the military, it is 
important to create a parenting time schedule that focuses on sharing the children when the parents 
live close to each other and allowing for temporary duty assignment (TDY) possibilities.  Military families 
should also consider what parenting time would look like if TDY’s or overseas commitments were 
engaged requiring one parent to live more than 200 miles from the children.  The residential parent shall 
support the children’s relationship with the other parent by having a consistent plan of communication 
with the military parent.   

egal Notice. 
These Guidelines do not provide legal opinions or legal advice and are not intended to serve as a 
substitute for the advice of licensed, legal professionals.  

aws and interpretations of laws change frequently, and the material contained in these Guidelines have 
important legal consequences.  In using these Guidelines, parents are responsible for determining the 
applicability of any information contained in this document to their situation and are strongly 
encouraged to seek professional legal and other expert assistance in resolving their parenting time 
issues.  Parents will often benefit from getting advice from mediators, counselors, therapists, parenting 
coordinators and lawyers to help them make a parenting time schedule. 

efinitions. 

Any custody proceeding involving children is going to involve a determination of both legal and physical 
custody.   

Legal Custody” refers to the legal authority to make major decisions for your children.  There are 2 
options when it comes to legal custody: 
 

Joint Legal Custody – “[B]oth parents retain full parental rights and responsibilities with respect 
to their child[ren] and so that both parents must confer on, and participate in, major decisions 
affecting the welfare of the child[ren].”  See SDCL 25-5-7.1. 

Sole Legal Custody – one parent shall have the right and responsibility to make the decisions 
related to health, education and welfare of the children.

Physical Custody” refers to how parenting time is divided between 2 parties.  Parents may agree on the 
amount of time the children spend with each parent. If parents do not agree, the parenting time  
schedule set forth herein shall remain in place until a court orders otherwise.  

hared Parenting. 
These Guidelines do not address shared parenting, which is defined as “a detailed shared parenting plan 
which provides that the children will reside no less than 180 nights per calendar year in each parent’s 
home and that the parents will share the duties and responsibilities of parenting the children and the 
expenses of the children in proportion to their incomes[.]”  SDCL 25-7-6.27.  If you are interested in this 
arrangement, you are strongly encouraged to consult with an attorney of your choosing.  More 
information and sample schedules can be found at https://ujslawhelp.sd.gov/. 

cope of Application. 
General.  These Guidelines are applicable to all custody situations, including divorces with minor 
children, paternity actions and cases involving joint legal custody where one parent has primary physical 
custody.  These Guidelines are not applicable to situations where the court reasonably believes the 
children’s physical health or safety is in danger or the children’s emotional development could be 
significantly impaired.  These situations may include, but are not limited to, the following: 

- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 

Family Violence (physical, verbal or otherwise); 
Substance Abuse; 
Mental Illness of Parent or Child; 
Risk of Flight with Children; 
Long Interruption of Contact Between Parent and Children; 
A Parent’s New Relationship; 
Religious & Cultural Holidays; or 
An Incarcerated Parent. 

n such cases one or both parents may have legal, psychological, substance abuse or emotional problems 
that may need to be addressed before these Guidelines can be used.  The type of help that is needed in 
such cases is beyond the scope of these Guidelines. 

 parent who believes one or more of the above situations exists should file an Objection to the 

Implementation of the South Dakota Parenting Guidelines (UJS Form 372).  This form can be found at 
https://ujslawhelp.sd.gov/defendants.aspx.  The opposing parent should also file a response to this 
Objection and should appear at the hearing. 

xisting Parenting Time Orders.  Existing parenting time orders on the date of adoption of these revised 
Guidelines shall be enforced according to the parenting time guidelines that were in effect on the date 
the parenting time order was issued.  Changes to the South Dakota Parenting Time Guidelines do not 
alone constitute good cause for modifying an existing parenting time order; however, a court or parties

the effective date of the Guidelines. 

rotection Orders.  If a protection order has been established regarding the minor children, that order 
would prevail over these Guidelines, until a court specifically orders otherwise.  If an active protection 
order prohibits contact between the parents or between one parent and the children, parents are 
cautioned that the parent who is the subject of the protection order will violate the order if he/she has 
contact with the other parent and makes agreements as suggested in these Guidelines without 
permission for contact from the court that issued the protection order.

There are several resources available to parents who need help in creating, enforcing or improving their 
parenting plan.  Visit https://ujslawhelp.sd.gov/ (under the “Parenting” tab) for additional information
