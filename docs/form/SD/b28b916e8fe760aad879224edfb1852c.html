      <pre>SOUTH DAKOTA PROTECTION ORDER FROM ACTS OF DOMESTIC 
ABUSE, ACTS OF STALKING OR PHYSICAL INJURY, AND ACTS 
OF VULNERABLE ADULT ABUSE 
READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS AND REVIEW THE FORMS BEFORE FILLING THEM OUT

APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE VICTIM OF 
DOMESTIC ABUSE, STALKING/PHYSICAL INJURY, OR VULNERABLE ADULT ABUSE 

REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW. You may seek a protection order from “domestic abuse,” from 
“stalking”/“physical injury,” or from “vulnerable adult abuse.” If you do not qualify for a domestic abuse 
protection order, you may still qualify for a protection order for stalking/physical injury or vulnerable adult 
abuse. In order for the judge to grant a protection order, you must meet certain criteria. 

RESIDENCE REQUIREMENT. You should file in the county where you, the respondent, or another party 
you seek to protect with the protection order resides. 

IF YOU ARE SEEKING A PROTECTION ORDER
FOR DOMESTIC ABUSE 

YOU MUST HAVE A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RESPONDENT. You must have a 
personal relationship with the individual against whom you are seeking an order of protection (the alleged 
abuser). An alleged abuser can be a (1) spouse or former spouse; (2) person in a significant romantic 
relationship with you or has recently been in one during the past twelve months; (3) person with whom you 
have a child or are expecting a child with; (4) a parent or child, including a relationship by adoption, 
guardianship, or marriage; or (5) a sibling, including whole or half blood, adoption or marriage. If your
relationship is not one of the above, you cannot seek a protection order for domestic abuse.  You may, 
however, be able to receive a protection order for stalking as defined later in these instructions. 
The person against whom you seek an order: (1) must have caused you physical injury or harm; (2) must 
have attempted to cause you physical injury or harm; or (3) you  are afraid that the person is about to cause 
you physical injury or harm. You may also be eligible for a domestic abuse protection order if the person 
has: (1) violated a protection order or no contact order; (2) has participated in stalking/harassment; or (3)
has committed a crime of violence against you. If the person has not done any  of these things, or you do not 
have a personal relationship with them, you cannot seek a protection order for domestic abuse. You may, 
however, be able to receive a protection order for stalking or for vulnerable adult abuse as defined later in 
these instructions. 

IF YOU ARE SEEKING A PROTECTION ORDER
FOR STALKING OR FROM PHYSICAL INJURY 

YOU MUST ALLEGE STALKING. The person's acts of harassment must seriously alarm, annoy or 
harass you. The person against whom you seek a stalking order must have: (1) followed or harassed you 
in a  willful and malicious manner and have done so more than once; or (2) made believable threats against 
you with the intent to make you fearful of great bodily injury; or (3) harassed you in a willful and 
malicious manner by means of verbal, electronic, digital media, mechanical, telegraphic, or written 
communication and have done so more than once.  The person must intend to carry out the threats and have 
the apparent ability  to do so, or (4) you, as the petitioner, have suffered physical injury because of an 
assault or a crime of  violence. 

A crime of violence is murder, manslaughter, rape, aggravated assault, riot, robbery, burglary in the first or 
second degree, arson, kidnapping, felony sexual contact or any other felony in the commission of which  the 
perpetrator used force, or was armed with a dangerous weapon, or used any explosive or destructive device. 
It also includes an attempt or conspiracy to commit the above-described crimes.

Form UJS-090A (Instructions) 

Rev. 10/17 

IF YOU ARE SEEKING A PROTECTION ORDER
FOR VULNERABLE ADULT ABUSE 

THERE MUST BE AN ADULT WITH A DISABILITY OR AN ELDER (AGE 65 AND OLDER) WHO 
IS UNABLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM ABUSE.  Such abuse can include (1) physical abuse or 
attempted physical abuse, (2) repeated emotional and psychological abuse by a caretaker (such as sexual 
exploitation, unreasonable confinement, threats of harm or harm to the property of the vulnerable adult, and 
harassment or ridiculing/demeaning conduct), or (3) financial exploitation by a caretaker, family member, or a 
person who is in a confidential relationship with the vulnerable adult (such as a guardian, conservator, or agent). 

IF YOU MEET THE LEGAL CRITERIA STATED ABOVE, YOU MAY
COMPLETE THE FORMS WITH THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS 

1.

2.

3.

4.

5.

6.

7.

8.

FILL OUT THE PETITIONER AND RESPONDENT INFORMATION SHEETS AND THE
PETITION AND AFFIDAVIT FOR A PROTECTION ORDER (please print names). You are
the PETITIONER; the person against whom you seek a protection order is the RESPONDENT.

THE PETITION AND AFFIDAVIT MUST BE THE TRUTH. Do not sign your name at the end
of the form. You will need to sign it before a court clerk and swear to its truth or if you are unable to
take it to the Clerk’s Office yourself, you may sign it before a notary.

REQUIREMENT FOR AN IMMEDIATE ORDER. If you are requesting that the judge grant you
an immediate temporary protection order without the Respondent having notice of your request or an
opportunity to be heard, YOU MUST BE ABLE TO CLAIM THAT IMMEDIATE AND GREAT
INJURY, LOSS OR DAMAGE WOULD OCCUR IF YOU HAD TO WAIT UNTIL A
HEARING.

JUDGE MUST SIGN THE ORDER. The judge will review your petition and affidavit. If the
judge grants you a temporary protection order and/or a hearing, the clerk will prepare certified copies
of the orders.  You will need to pick up the copies of the orders at the Clerk of Courts Office where
you filed.

DELIVER FORMS TO THE SHERIFF. Take two copies of the forms to the Sheriff Office, in the
County where the petition is filed.

KEEP ONE COPY OF THE SIGNED FORMS WITH YOU AT ALL TIMES.

YOU MUST ATTEND THE HEARING FOR THE PROTECTION ORDER.

THE HEARING IS THE TIME SET FOR YOU TO PROVE YOUR CASE. You will need to
bring with  you  to  the  hearing  any witnesses that  have first-hand  knowledge  of the incidents that
have  occurred,  any documentation  such  as  pictures,  phone  logs,  email  messages,  text  messages,
etc.

IF THE RESPONDENT VIOLATES ANY PROTECTION ORDER, 
CALL THE POLICE IMMEDIATELY

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
