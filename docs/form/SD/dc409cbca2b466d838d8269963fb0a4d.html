Law enforcement officers and clerk magistrates are reminded that a defendant 

 
is required to appear before a magistrate judge if the defendant is charged with a 
violation of a Class 2 misdemeanor that is not included on this schedule. Also, all Class 
2 misdemeanor state traffic offenses (SDCL title 32) not included on this schedule for 
which citations are issued must be supported by an SDCL code that clearly states the 
violation is a Class 2 misdemeanor.    

Law enforcement officers are advised that, according to SDCL 32-12-52.3 and 

32-12-52.4, when any of the following violations are charged and the defendant was in 
a motor vehicle (whether driving or as a passenger) at the time of the alleged offense, 
the officer must note on the citation that the offense occurred while the accused was in 
a motor vehicle, and specify whether the accused was a driver or a passenger.  The 
offenses involved include SDCL 35-9-2 (underage purchase, possession, consumption of 
alcoholic beverages); SDCL 22-42-5 through -11; and 22-42A-3 or 22-42A-4, which 
include a variety of drug charges.   

Fines and appearances required for violation of municipal/county ordinances 
shall be the same as those required for violation of similar state statutes. For other 
traffic offenses not covered by ordinance, the fines are the same as the state schedule.

ote:  A magistrate court with a clerk magistrate presiding has concurrent 

jurisdiction to accept an overweight truck civil penalty imposed pursuant 
to SDCL 32-22-55 only if the civil penalty is paid in full as part of a guilty 
plea.  If the driver cannot pay the penalty in full as part of the guilty plea, 
the clerk must contact the magistrate or circuit court judge to set the bond. 

he overweight violation cited under § 32-22-52 is a Class 2 misdemeanor, the penalty 

for which is a $104 fine, 30 days in jail, or both. 

n additional cash penalty, not subject to suspension, shall be assessed on the total 

overweight at one of the rates set forth below (§ 32-22-55): 

)  For one thousand to three thousand pounds total overweight, the additional 

penalty is five cents per pound on all overweight exceeding one thousand pounds. 

)  From three thousand-one pounds, up to and including four thousand pounds total 

overweight, the additional penalty is fifteen cents per pound on the total 
overweight. 

)  From four thousand-one pounds, up to and including five thousand pounds total 
overweight, the additional penalty is twenty-two and one-half cents per pound on 
the total overweight. 

)  For total overweight of five thousand-one pounds, up to and including ten thousand 
pounds total overweight, the additional penalty is thirty-seven and one-half cents 
per pound on the total overweight. 

)  For total overweight of ten thousand-one pounds and over, the additional penalty is 

seventy-five cents per pound on the total overweight. 

o the above-determined amount of fine and additional cash penalty, liquidated costs 

and surcharges in the amount of $78.50 should be added. A circuit judge may waive 
any or all of this $78.50 amount. 

ny portion of the fine (or $78.50 liquidated costs and surcharges) that is suspended 

shall be deducted from the above computation. No part of the cash penalty can be 
suspended.

      <h3><a name="fields" href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>Identified Data Fields:</h3>
      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
