Frequently Asked Questions 

How much will my fine be?  

he maximum fine amounts are established by the legislature.  For cases 

heard in court, the judges can use their discretion to set fine amounts based 
on the seriousness of the offense.  For some of the more common offenses 
(for example, speeding or failing to stop at a stop sign) that don’t have court 
appearances required, standard amounts are set by a fine and bond 
schedule and should be indicated on the ticket at the time of the offense. 
The fine and bond schedule can be found at 
https://ujs.sd.gov/uploads/docs/Fine_and_Bond_Schedule.pdf 
      

an I get an extension to pay my fines?  

ll fines and costs are due by the date indicated on the ticket, or the date of 

sentencing if it was a court appearance.  If you are unable to pay your fine 
in full the day it is due, you can ask the judge to allow for an extension.  If 
an extension is granted, you will need to visit the clerk of courts to set up 
and sign a payment plan. 

ow much will my license tags cost this year?  

icense plate renewals and registrations are not processed by the courts. 
You should contact your local county Treasurer’s office with this question. 

ow can I get a copy of my birth certificate?  

he courts do not maintain birth certificates or other vital statistic records 
(such as marriage or death certificates). You can contact your local county 
Register of Deeds office or the South Dakota Department of Health and Vital 
Records office for this information.

What do I need to get a judgment against a person?  

ou must start a court action in either small claims or civil court in order to 
get a judgment.  The judge who hears the case must agree that your claim 
is valid and rule in your favor.  If your claim is $12,000 or less, you can use 
the small claims process which is informal and can be done without an 
attorney.  Instructions and all necessary forms can be found at ujs.sd.gov.  
For larger amounts, you would need to go through civil court. 

How do I file a small claims suit?  

 small claims action must be filed in either the county where the defendant 
lives, or the county where the loss occurred. To start an action, the plaintiff 
or his/her attorney must provide a written and signed statement describing 
the loss amount and how the loss or damage occurred.  This statement, 
along with supporting documents (receipts, cost estimates, contracts, etc.), 
a Case Filing Statement, and the filing fee are required to start the case. 
Visit our website at ujs.sd.gov for forms and instructions. 

ow that I have a judgment, when do I get my money?  

Obtaining a judgment does not guarantee payment and the court does not 
enforce collection.  What it does do is place a lien against the debtor for 10 
years which can be renewed for an additional 10 years if it remains unpaid.  
Some defendants (debtors) are able to and do pay right away. Others make 
arrangements to pay you over time. Some situations may require you to 
enforce the judgment by other legal means such as an execution.  There are 
other procedures available to collect on a judgment, but they are often 
legally complex and the assistance of an attorney may be required.  

ow do I garnish wages to collect my judgment?  

arnishing wages is a complex process and would be best to visit with an 

attorney.

How do I file for a divorce?  

outh Dakota does have instructions and forms available to use in filing your 
own divorce case in court if it will be simple and non-contested. These forms 
can be obtained from any Clerk of Courts office for $10, or online at no cost 
at ujslawhelp.sd.gov. You are strongly encouraged to consult with an 
attorney before filing for divorce as many of the laws regarding marital 
assets and child custody can be complex.   

hat do I need to get a marriage license?  

arriage licenses are issued by the local county Register of Deeds office, not 

by the courts. You should contact them with specific questions. At a 
minimum, you should be prepared to provide identification and pay a fee. 
We can tell you that once a license is issued, the wedding must take place 
within 90 days or the license becomes void. 

ow do I get a passport?  

assport acceptance facilities in South Dakota are located in some post 

offices and insome county Clerk of Court, Register of Deeds, Treasurer and 
Auditor offices.  Visit the US Passport Service Guide site at https://www.us-
passport-service-guide.com/south-dakota-offices.html to find local locations. 

hat is the number for Driver Improvement?  

-800-952-3696 in South Dakota. 

an I talk with a judge directly outside of court or write a letter?  

enerally, no, but it depends. All contact with a judge regarding any matters 

related to court cases (pending or not) should occur through your attorney. 
This ensures that the proper rules and laws are followed regarding 
communications with a judge and notice to the other parties in a case. If you 
are not represented by an attorney, your best option is to write a letter to 
the judge, in care of the Clerk of Courts office for the county where your 
case is pending, with a copy to all other parties. This will help keep the 
judge from having one-sided communication (called ex parte) or creating a 
conflict of interest for the judge by having access to information that may 
not be appropriate.

How do I get copies of documents from court files?  

ot all documents in court files are available to the public; some have 

limited access according to South Dakota laws. You can check with the Clerk 
of Courts in the county where the case is pending to find out if what you 
want is open for copying. There may be a fee for copies; that fee depends on 
whether you want a regular copy, a certified or authenticated copy, and how 
many pages there are in the document you are requesting. Generally, all 
requests for copying and/or searches of records must be accompanied by 
payment. 

or CIVIL record searches and questions regarding criminal and civil record 

searches, send an email with a completed Record Search Request form 
to:  UJSPARSsupport@ujs.state.sd.us

credit card payment search, use the Search as Guest option). 

here is a $20 fee to run a complete Civil and/or Criminal search on a party. 

ow do I find an attorney to handle my case?  

either the Clerk nor the judge can recommend an individual attorney to 
help you, although in some criminal cases, the court may appoint specific 
counsel for you if you qualify by meeting certain financial guidelines. If you 
cannot get a reference from a friend, or cannot find someone by using the 
Yellow Pages of the phone directory, you might check with the Lawyer 
Referral Help Line of the State Bar of South Dakota in Pierre. That number is 
1-800-952-2333, and their web site is www.sdbar.org. 

hat if I have a complaint about my attorney?  

t depends on the nature of your complaint and whether the attorney was 
chosen by you or appointed by the court. Discussing your concerns with the 
attorney may resolve your issues. If your attorney was court appointed, you 
may ask the court to consider appointing someone else.  There is a 
grievance process available through the State Bar of South Dakota.  Visit 
their website at www.sdbar.org.

pending for specific information and fax number. 

ow do I contact the clerk of courts? 

Here is a link to the phone numbers for each office: 
https://ujs.sd.gov/media/odyssey/Clerk_Contact_List.pdf 

ow do I get a hearing before a judge or how do I get a hearing date 

changed?  

our attorney will arrange for the necessary hearings. However, if you are 
not represented by an attorney, you should contact the Clerk of Courts office 
in the county where you case is pending. The clerk will be able to tell you if 
those arrangements can be made through that office, or if the judge will 
need to be consulted. The answer will depend on the kind of case you have, 
the nature of hearing requested, how much time might be needed, and 
availability of the judge. 

ow do I get a transcript of a court hearing?  

ranscripts are prepared by an official court reporter or court recorder.  Most 

transcripts will have to be requested directly from the court reporter 
originally attending the court hearing. The Clerk of Courts office can tell you 
who the reporter is and how to contact that person. Depending on the kind 
of hearing and whether it was digitally recorded or stenographically 
reported, the fees for a transcript will vary, as will the time it may take for 
the transcription.
