ORDER FOR ISOLATION OF INDIVIDUAL 
PURSUANT TO 902 KAR 2:030

AOC-1025.4 
Rev. 3-20 
Page 1 of 3 

Doc. Code: OFIS

Commonwealth of Kentucky 
Court of Justice 

www.kycourts.gov 

KRS 212.245; 902 KAR 2:030, 050

IN RE: ISOLATION OF ___________________________________________________________, 

[Individual's Name]

The COURT, having received evidence in this matter, and being otherwise sufficiently advised, now FINDS:

1.  The _______________________________________________ has received reports of increasing numbers of ill people 

[local health department name]

  exhibiting symptoms of a disease that has in its common course severe disability or death.

2.  That since ______________________, 2_____ until the date of this Order, over ____________ people have been 

[date of first case report]

[applicable number]

 

stricken with this disease in Kentucky and ____________ people have died.

[applicable number]

3.  2019-novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a new communicable disease that has not been previously identified in the 
  world. 2019-nCoV meets the definition for “severe acute respiratory syndromes” as set forth in federal Executive Order 
  13295, as amended by Executive Order 13372 and 13674, and is a federally quarantinable communicable disease. It is 
 
characterized  by  fever,  cough,  and  shortness  of  breath  and  can  progress  to  severe  respiratory  illness  requiring 
  hospitalization and mechanical ventilation and can lead to death.

4.  2019-nCoV is spread from person-to-person among close contacts. According to the Center for Disease Control and 
  Prevention, person-to-person spread is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected 
  person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can be inhaled into the lungs and in the mouths or noses of people who are 
 

in close contact. Further, this disease may be spread from contact with contaminated surfaces or objects.

5.  Clear and convincing evidence shows that those people who are in physical contact with or in the proximity of less than 
  6 feet of an individual infected with this disease, or have had contact with a surface or object that is contaminated with 
  2019-nCoV, are likely to exhibit symptoms within 2 to 14 days, which period of time is referred to herein as the “incubation 
  period”. Thus, the clear and convincing evidence suggests that this disease is easily transmissible from person-to-person.

6.  There are no known preventive medications for this disease at this time.

7.  The most effective method currently known to medical science to contain and curtail the spread of this disease is the 
 
isolation of anyone who has the symptoms identified above at Paragraph 3, and the quarantine of those who have been  
  exposed to a person infected with this disease for the duration of the incubation period, as identified above at Paragraph 5.

8.  The affidavit and/or testimony of qualified witnesses, including ___________________________________________ 

[names and titles of relevant witnesses]

  ______________________________________________________________________________, has indicated that 

[names and titles of relevant witnesses]

  ________________________________________ has tested positive for 2019-nCoV.

[individual's name]

9.  The affidavit and/or testimony of qualified witnesses, including ___________________________________________ 
[names and titles of relevant witnesses and describe their association with the individual]
  ________________________________________________________________________________,  has  indicated 

[names and titles of relevant witnesses and describe their association with the individual]

 

that  ________________________________________  comes  into  contact  with  numerous  individuals  on  a  regular 

[individual's name]

   basis  through  his/her  activities  as  _________________________________________________________________ 

[list applicable profession or personal undertakings]

  and that ________________________________________ has undertaken these activities since becoming infected 

  with this disease.

10.
 

Due to 

______________________________________

’s positive test results for 2019-nCoV recited above at Paragraph

 

8, ________________________________________

requires isolation in an appropriate medical facility or at home.

11.
 

Isolation of ________________________________________

 
in a medical facility or at home will reasonably protect 

those with whom 

________________________________________ 

would otherwise come in contact from acquiring

 

this disease from 

________________________________________

.

2.
 

The _______________________________________________

[local health department name]

of infectious diseases and the responsibility to provide medical care and supervision for 

_______________________ 
[individual's name]

_________________

pursuant to exercises of such authority.

13.
 

Pursuant to such authority and in an attempt to prevent ________________________________________

from undertaking

activities potentially harmful to the public’s health, the 

_______________________________________________

issued 

an  order  of  isolation  to 

________________________________________ 

on 

_________________________
[date of order’s issuance]

,  2020,

which the COURT has received as Exhibit 

[individual's name]

____________
[exhibit number]

. 

[individual's name]

[local health department name]

14.
 

The affidavit and/or testimony of qualified witnesses, including 

___________________________________________ 
[names and titles of relevant witnesses]

______________________________________________________________________________

,  has  indicated  that

[individual's name]

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
.

 [list activities demonstrating noncompliance in detail]

The COURT now MAKES the following conclusions: 

.

 

The  _______________________________________________ 

had  the  authority  to  issue  an  order  of  isolation  to 

 

________________________________________ pursuant to KRS 212.040, 212.245(5), and 902 KAR 2:050. 

[local health department name]

[individual's name]

 2. This CIRCUIT COURT has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to KRS 212.245(6).

3.

 

Pursuant to KRS 212.245(6), this COURT has the power to issue an injunction compelling _____________________ 

[individual's name]

___________________  to  comply  with  the 

_______________________________________________

 
’s  isolation

[local health department name]

order.

4.

 

The nature of the disease at issue (as recited above at Paragraph 1), 

___________________________________

 
’s 

positive test results for 2019-nCoV (as recited above at Paragraph 8), and the conduct of 

___________________ 

(as  recited  above  at  Paragraphs  9  and  14),  constitute  clear  and  convincing  evidence  that

________________________________________

must  be  placed  under  an  order  of  isolation  so  as  to  protect  the

public’s health.
