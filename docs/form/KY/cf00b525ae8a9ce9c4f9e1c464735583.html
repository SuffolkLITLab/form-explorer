TO JUDGMENT DEBTOR:

Amount Due: $

Probable Court Costs: $

Judgment Date:

Creditor's Attorney:

	
The	Judgment	Creditor	is	garnishing	a	portion	
of  your  wages  to  satisfy  a  judgment  entered  against 
you, which includes the Amount Due shown above, plus 
interest  and  costs.    You  may  have  a  right  to  recover 
all  or  part  of  the  money  your  employer  will  withhold, 
but  you  must  follow  the  instructions  given  below.

The Garnishee (Employer) is:                              

IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE OF
RIGHTS TO ASSERT EXEMPTION

 
Attorney  (or  the  Creditor  if  no  attorney  is  named  above)  to  avoid  garnishment,  or  request  a  hearing  from  the  Court  (see  below).

If you are not the actual Judgment Debtor named above, or if the judgment has been paid, immediately notify the Creditor's 

	
You	are	entitled	to	receive	a	copy	of	the	first	Affidavit	and	Answer	of	Garnishee	(Employer)	to	be	prepared	by	your	employer	
in  response  to  the  garnishment  of  your  wages.  Read  it  carefully.  Your  employer  is  required  to  send  you  a  copy  of  the  form  on  the 
back of this notice each time garnished funds have been withheld from your paycheck if the amount withheld is different from the 
amount  previously  withheld  from  your  last  paycheck.    If  you  do  not  receive  a  copy,  request  one  from  your  employer.  If  refused, 
request a hearing from the Court (see below). The percentage of disposable earnings exempted from each garnishment, where 
the  pay  period  is  weekly,  is  the  greater  of  (A)  75%  of  disposable  earnings  or  (B)  for  wages  earned  after  7/24/09  $217.50  (30 
times  the  federal  minimum  hourly  wage  of  $7.25).

If  you  believe  that  your  employer  has  completed  the  form  incorrectly  and  withheld  wages  which  are  properly  exempt,  you 
 
must take the following steps:  (1) Within thirteen (13) days of the date on the payroll check from which funds have been withheld 
as a result of this garnishment,	go	to	the	Circuit	Clerk's	office	which	issued	this	garnishment;		(2)	complete	an	Affidavit	to	Challenge	
Garnishment;	 (3)	 file	 the	 original	 of	 the	Affidavit	 with	 the	 Clerk	 and	 keep	 a	 copy.	 The	 Clerk	 will	 set	 a	 hearing	 for	 you	 to	 appear	 in
court to contest the garnishment of your wages.  The Clerk  cannot give  you legal advice.   See a lawyer  if you need legal advice.  
If  you  do  not  appear  in  court  for  the  hearing,  you  will  lose  your  right  to  challenge  that  particular  withholding.   At  the  hearing,  the  judge
will check the withholding made by your employer to determine if a mistake has been made. If a portion of your wages was improperly 
seized,  the  judge  will  order  that  it  be  returned  to  you.  Otherwise,  the  judge  will  order  that  the  garnishment  proceed  as  planned.    If 
you  do  not  request  a  hearing  within  thirteen  (13)  days  of  the  date  on  the  payroll  check,  the  wages  withheld  will  be  later  sent  to  the 
Judgment	 Creditor.	 	 The	 Creditor's	Attorney	 or	 the	 Clerk	 (if	 there	 is	 no	 Creditor's	Attorney)	 will	 hold	 the	 garnished	 money	 received	
from	your	employer	for	15	days	from	the	issuance	date	on	the	employer's	garnishment	check.		This	is	to	allow	you	to	assert	any	exemption.

ADDITIONAL  REQUIREMENTS  AND  INSTRUCTIONS
TO  GARNISHEE  (EMPLOYER)

Note:	 You	 should	 make	 copies	 of	 the	 front	 of	 this	 Order	 and	 keep	 them	 for	 future	 use.	 Go	 to	 the	 Circuit	 	
	

Clerk's	 office	 for	 additional	 copies,	 if	 needed.

YOU	 ARE	 SUMMONED	 AND	 ORDERED	 TO	 DO	 THE	 FOLLOWING:

1.  Complete  the  Affidavit  and  Answer  on  the  front  of  this  Order  under  oath  and  send  copies  as  directed 
	

in	 paragraph	 2	 below:

(a)  within  20  days  (30  days  if  the  judgment  debtor  is  a  federal  government  employee)  from  your  receipt
	

of	 this	 Order;	 AND

(b)	 when	 you	 first	 withhold	 as	 required	 by	 this	 Order;	 AND

(c)  whenever  the  amount  withheld  from  any  later  paycheck  differs  from  the  amount  withheld  from  the   
 

last  paycheck.

2.	 Send	 copies	 of	 each	 completed	 Affidavit	 and	 Answer	 to:

(a)	

the	 Judgment	 Debtor-Employee;	 AND

(b)	

the	 Judgment-Creditor's	 Attorney	 or	 to	 the	 Creditor	 (if	 no	 attorney	 is	 named);	 AND

(c)	

the	 Circuit	 Clerk;	 AND

(d) 

retain  a  copy  for  your  records.

3.	
 

The	 following	 provisions	 apply	 to	 money	 or	 property	 of	 the	 Judgment	 Debtor	 consisting	 of	 earnings	 (compensation	 	
for  personal  services):

(a)	 This	 Order	 creates	 a	 lien	 on	 all	 non-exempt	 earnings	 of	 the	 Judgment	 Debtor	 earned	 during	 the	 pay
period  in  which  this  Order  is  served  and  during  all  succeeding  pay  periods  until  the  entire  judgment
 
balance  is  paid  in  full  or  for  the  pay  periods  designated  on  the  front  of  this  Order.    At  a  later
 
date,  the  Creditor  or  Creditor's  Attorney  may  provide  you  with  notice  of  any  remaining  unpaid  principal, 
 
interest  and  court  costs  due.
 

(b)	 Orders	 of	 Wage	 Garnishment	 shall	 have	 priority	 according	 to	 the	 date	 of	 service	 on	 you.	 	 If	 you	 receive	
more	 than	 one	 Order	 of	 Wage	 Garnishment	 against	 a	 Judgment	 Debtor,	 honor	 the	 first	 Order	 you	 receive	
	
until  the  amount  due,  plus  interest  and  costs,  is  paid  in  full  (or  for  the  pay  periods  designated  on  the
 
front	 of	 that	 Order).	 The	 second	 Order	 received	 then	 automatically	 takes	 effect.
	

(c)	 You	 may	 be	 notified	 by	 the	 Creditor's	 Attorney,	 the	 Judgment	 Creditor,	 or	 the	 Court	 to	 discontinue	
withholding	 pursuant	 to	 this	 Order.	 	 The	 second	 Order	 received	 then	 automatically	 takes	 effect.
	

(d)  Calculate  the  amount  of  non-exempt  earnings  on  the  front  of  this  Order  or  on  a  copy  of  it.    It  is 
 

based  on  a  certain  portion  of  disposable  earnings,  determined  as  follows:

	
 
 
 

	
 
	
	
	
	
 
 

i.	
 
 
 

ii.	
 
	
	
	
	
 
 

"Disposable	 Earnings"	 means	 that	 part	 of	 the	 earnings	 of	 any	 individual	 remaining	 after	 the	 deduction	
from  those  earnings  of  any  amounts  required  by  law  to  be  withheld.    Amounts  required  by  law
to  be  withheld  include  income  taxes,  occupational  license  taxes,  social  security,  railroad  retirement 
and  retirement  for  teachers  and  state  and  county  employees.

The	 percentage	 of	 disposable	 earnings	 exempted	 from	 this	 Order	 where	 the	 pay	 period	 is	 weekly	
is  the  greater  of  (a)  75%  of  disposable  earnings  or  (b)  30  times  the  current  federal  minimum
hourly	 wage	 (see	 Affidavit	 and	 Answer	 of	 Garnishee	 paragraph	 F.4.(b)	 on	 reverse).	 	 The	 amount	
to	 be	 withheld	 from	 weekly	 earnings	 shall	 be	 25%	 of	 the	 disposable	 earnings	 or	 the	 amount	 by	
which	 the	 disposable	 earnings	 exceeds	 the	 figure	 set	 forth	 in	 paragraph	 F.4.(b)	 of	 the	 Affidavit
and	 Answer	 of	 Garnishee	 on	 the	 reverse	 of	 this	 page,	 whichever	 is	 less.	 	 (The	 exempt	 earnings	
are  to  be  paid  to  the  employee  in  the  usual  manner.)  Please  notice  that  the  federal  minimum 
hourly  wage  is  $7.25  for  wages  earned  after  7-24-09.

(e)	 Pursuant	 to	 KRS	 425.516	 an	 employer	 is	 allowed	 his	 costs.

The	 following	 provisions	 apply	 to	 money	 or	 property	 of	 the	 Judgment	 Debtor	 consisting	 of	 earnings	 (compensation

(a)	 This	 Order	 creates	 a	 lien	 on	 all	 non-exempt	 earnings	 of	 the	 Judgment	 Debtor	 earned	 during	 the	 pay
period  in  which  this  Order  is  served  and  during  all  succeeding  pay  periods  until  the  entire  judgment

The	 following	 provisions	 apply	 to	 money	 or	 property	 of	 the	 Judgment	 Debtor	 consisting	 of	 earnings	 (compensation	 	
for  personal  services):

(a)	 This	 Order	 creates	 a	 lien	 on	 all	 non-exempt	 earnings	 of	 the	 Judgment	 Debtor	 earned	 during	 the	 pay
period  in  which  this  Order  is  served  and  during  all  succeeding  pay  periods  until  the  entire  judgment
 
balance  is  paid  in  full  or  for  the  pay  periods  designated  on  the  front  of  this  Order.    At  a  later
 
date,  the  Creditor  or  Creditor's  Attorney  may  provide  you  with  notice  of  any  remaining  unpaid  principal, 
 
interest  and  court  costs  due.
 

(b)	 Orders	 of	 Wage	 Garnishment	 shall	 have	 priority	 according	 to	 the	 date	 of	 service	 on	 you.	 	 If	 you	 receive	
more	 than	 one	 Order	 of	 Wage	 Garnishment	 against	 a	 Judgment	 Debtor,	 honor	 the	 first	 Order	 you	 receive	
	
until  the  amount  due,  plus  interest  and  costs,  is  paid  in  full  (or  for  the  pay  periods  designated  on  the
 
front	 of	 that	 Order).	 The	 second	 Order	 received	 then	 automatically	 takes	 effect.
	

(c)	 You	 may	 be	 notified	 by	 the	 Creditor's	 Attorney,	 the	 Judgment	 Creditor,	 or	 the	 Court	 to	 discontinue	
withholding	 pursuant	 to	 this	 Order.	 	 The	 second	 Order	 received	 then	 automatically	 takes	 effect.
	

(d)  Calculate  the  amount  of  non-exempt  earnings  on  the  front  of  this  Order  or  on  a  copy  of  it.    It  is 
 

based  on  a  certain  portion  of  disposable  earnings,  determined  as  follows:

	
 
 
 

	
 
	
	
	
	
 
 

i.	
 
 
 

ii.	
 
	
	
	
	
 
 

"Disposable	 Earnings"	 means	 that	 part	 of	 the	 earnings	 of	 any	 individual	 remaining	 after	 the	 deduction	
from  those  earnings  of  any  amounts  required  by  law  to  be  withheld.    Amounts  required  by  law
to  be  withheld  include  income  taxes,  occupational  license  taxes,  social  security,  railroad  retirement 
and  retirement  for  teachers  and  state  and  county  employees.

The	 percentage	 of	 disposable	 earnings	 exempted	 from	 this	 Order	 where	 the	 pay	 period	 is	 weekly	
is  the  greater  of  (a)  75%  of  disposable  earnings  or  (b)  30  times  the  current  federal  minimum
hourly	 wage	 (see	 Affidavit	 and	 Answer	 of	 Garnishee	 paragraph	 F.4.(b)	 on	 reverse).	 	 The	 amount	
to	 be	 withheld	 from	 weekly	 earnings	 shall	 be	 25%	 of	 the	 disposable	 earnings	 or	 the	 amount	 by	
which	 the	 disposable	 earnings	 exceeds	 the	 figure	 set	 forth	 in	 paragraph	 F.4.(b)	 of	 the	 Affidavit
and	 Answer	 of	 Garnishee	 on	 the	 reverse	 of	 this	 page,	 whichever	 is	 less.	 	 (The	 exempt	 earnings	
are  to  be  paid  to  the  employee  in  the  usual  manner.)  Please  notice  that  the  federal  minimum 
hourly  wage  is  $7.25  for  wages  earned  after  7-24-09.

(e)	 Pursuant	 to	 KRS	 425.516	 an	 employer	 is	 allowed	 his	 costs.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
