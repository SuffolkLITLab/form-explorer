MOTION TO ENTER GUILTY PLEA
PURSUANT TO
NORTH CAROLINA VS. ALFORD

AOC-491.2 
Rev. 8-16
Page 1 of 2

Doc. Code: EGPA 

Commonwealth of Kentucky
Court of Justice     www.courts.ky.gov

RCr 8.08, 8.10; KRS 17.169; 17.170; 
532.050(1)

COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY 

 

 

 

PLAINTIFF

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

_______________________________________________ 

DEFENDANT

Comes the Defendant, in person and with aid of counsel, and respectfully moves this Court to allow him/her to withdraw 
his/her former plea of “NOT GUILTY” and enter a plea of “GUILTY” as set forth below.  In support of this motion, the 
Defendant states as follows:

My full name is ____________________________________________________________________________. 
I am the same person named in the indictment.

My judgment is not now impaired by drugs, alcohol or medication.

I have reviewed a copy of the indictment and told my attorney all the facts known to me concerning my charges.
I believe he/she is fully informed about my case.  We have fully discussed, and I understand, the charges and 
any possible defenses to them.

I understand that I may plead “NOT GUILTY” or “GUILTY” to any charge against me.  

I further understand the Constitution guarantees to me the following rights:
(a)  The right not to testify against myself;
(b)  The right to a speedy and public trial by jury at which I would be represented by counsel and the
      Commonwealth would have to prove my guilt beyond a reasonable doubt;
(c)  The right to confront and cross-examine all witnesses called to testify against me;
(d)  The right to produce any evidence, including attendance of witnesses, in my favor; and,
(e)  The right to appeal my case to a higher court.

 I understand that if I plead “GUILTY,” I waive these rights.

I understand that if I plead “GUILTY,” the Court may impose any punishment within the range provided by law 
and that although it may consider the Commonwealth’s recommendation, the Court may reject it.  The legal 
penalty ranges are set forth on the attached “Commonwealth’s Offer on a Plea of Guilty (AOC-491.1),” which I 
have reviewed and signed.

I understand that if the Court rejects the plea agreement, it must so inform me.  If this occurs, I may either persist 
in my guilty plea and possibly receive harsher treatment than I bargained for, or I may withdraw my guilty plea 
and proceed to trial.  I further understand the Court shall not impose a sentence for a felony, other than a capital 
offense, without first ordering a presentence investigation.  The Court will consider a written report of the 
presentence investigation before it informs me whether it will accept the plea agreement.

In return for my guilty plea, the Commonwealth has agreed to recommend to the Court the sentence(s) set forth 
in  the attached “Commonwealth’s Offer on a Plea of Guilty.”  Other than that recommendation, no one, including 
my	attorney,	has	promised	me	any	other	benefit	in	return	for	my	guilty	plea	nor	has	anyone	forced	or	threatened	
me to plead “GUILTY.”

Pursuant to North Carolina vs. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970), I wish to plead “GUILTY” in reliance on the  
attached “Commonwealth’s Offer on a Plea of Guilty.”  In so pleading, I do not admit guilt, but I believe the  
evidence against me strongly indicates guilt and my interests are best served by a guilty plea.

I understand that if I am convicted of a methamphetamine related offense or offense related to anhydrous 
ammonia found in KRS Chapter 218A, 250 or 514, it shall be unlawful for me to possess ephedrine, pseudoephedrine,   
phenylpropanolamine,	their	salts	or	optical	isomers,	or	salts	of	optical	isomers	until	five	years	following	my		
conviction, discharge from incarceration or release from probation, shock probation, parole, or other form of 
conditional discharge, whichever is later. KRS 218A.1446.

I declare my plea of “GUILTY” is freely, knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made; that I have been 
represented by counsel; that my attorney has fully explained my constitutional rights to me, as well as the 
charges against me and any defenses to them; and that I understand the nature of this proceeding and all 
matters contained in this document.

I understand that a judgment of conviction for any degree of rape, sodomy, sexual abuse, or stalking shall operate 
as an application for an interpersonal protective order issued under KRS Chapter 456 and may result in such an 
order being issued.

I understand that if I am convicted of a felony offense under the Kentucky Revised Statutes, a sample of my DNA 
shall be collected by authorized personnel pursuant to KRS 17.170.

14. 

I understand that the charges I am convicted of today may be eligible for expungement pursuant to KRS Chapter 431.

I understand that, because of my conviction here today, I may be subject to greater/enhanced penalties  
if found guilty and/or convicted of any future criminal offenses.  I understand that, if I am not a United  
States citizen, I may be subject to deportation pursuant to the laws and regulations governing the United States  
Immigration and Naturalization Service.  I understand the complete terms of this plea and all the obligations  
imposed upon me by its terms.  

Signed in open court in the presence of my attorney this ________ day of _____________________, 2_____.

To the best of my knowledge and belief, the defendant understands the allegations contained in the indictment 
and/or any amendments thereto.  I have fully discussed with the defendant the charges any any possible 
defenses to them and I believe he/she fully understands the charges and possible defenses.  I have reviewed 
with the defendant the attached "Commonwealth's Offer on a Plea of Guilty" and the forgoing "Motion to Enter 
a Plea of Guilty," and I believe he/she understands these documents.

To the best of my knowledge and belief, his/her plea of "GUILTY" is made freely, knowingly intelligently and 
voluntarily.  I have fully explained the defendant's constitutional rights to him/her and I believe that he/she 
understands them.

The plea of "GUILTY" as offered by the defendant is consistent with my advice to him/her, and I recommend 
to the Court that his/her plea be accepted.

Signed by me in open court in the presence of the defendant this _______ day of _________________, 2_____.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
