This information is not binding on the Court if incorrect or misunderstood. The sample form and instructions are 
illustrative only and may or may not apply to the specific facts of your case.) 

The sections of the sample complaint will be identified by capital letters in parentheses, i.e., (A), (B). These 

do not appear on the actual complaint but are used to help you follow the instructions to the sample form. 

(A)  Fill in the County, Court No. and Court Address. You should leave blank the space for "Civil Action No." 
The Court will assign a case number for a new filing. 

(B) 
In the section marked PLAINTIFF(S), you must fill in your name, address, telephone number and email. If 
you are not the only plaintiff, you must include the same information for all other plaintiffs in the case. Each party 
must be listed separately. If you have filed a case before, you may include previous System ID # created   by the

additional parties. If any of the parties address’ have changed check the box under their name that indicates an 
address change. 

(C) 
In the section marked DEFENDANT(S), you must fill in the name, address, phone number and email of each 
defendant. It is extremely important that the addresses given the Court are complete and correct. If the party 
you are suing has a post office box, you must include their street address as well as their post office box. If you are 
suing a husband and wife, you must list the name of each spouse. If you have filed against defendant before, you 
may include previous System ID # created by the  Court under Defendant information. If you have more than 2

(F)  You must state whether you are an individual or corporation or other artificial entity. If you are suing as an 
artificial entity and are not represented by an attorney, a valid Form 50 must be attached to the complaint. A Form

do not have a valid Form 50, you must obtain one from the Chief Magistrate’s office. 

(G)  You must indicate whether the party you are suing, is an individual,  corporation, or other artificial entity. 
(The defendant will also be required to file a Form 50 if it is an artificial entity and does not wish to be represented

wish to hire a special process server (SPS). A Special Process Server (SPS) is an individual approved by the Court 
to serve documents in lieu of the Court. If selecting a Special Process Server (SPS), be sure to indicate the name and 
phone number of the Special Process Server (SPS) next to your selection. You should contact a Special Process

(I)  Alternate Address. This should be left blank. 

(J)  Type of Action. Check Debt. 

(K)  Concise Statement of Facts. Although only a very short statement of the facts is required, it is important that 
you include sufficient information. Information in this section should show: 

explained.  For example, in the attached sample, the complaint states that the plaintiff and defendant  
contracted on June 1, 2019, for the defendant to build a deck in the plaintiff's back yard. The terms were  
that the plaintiff would put $500 down and work would be completed within 30 days. Final payment of $500  

1.  What the agreement was between the parties. The relevant terms of the agreement should be  
 
 
 
  was to be paid upon completion of the work. 
2.  That the plaintiff has met the requirements of the agreement. For example, the sample form states that  
  work was completed on June 19, 2019 (within the 30-day period specified in the contract) and invoices  
  were given to the defendant requesting the amount due. 
3.  That the defendant has not paid the money owed and how much money is owed. If the defendant has  
paid some, but not all of the money owed, the complaint should state how much was paid. For  example,  
 
the sample form states that the defendant paid the initial $500 but has not yet paid the balance  of $500  
 
due. 
 

(L)  Relief Sought. This section asks you to indicate what you want to obtain because of your suit. In the sample 
complaint, the relief sought is the $500 balance due, prejudgment and post judgment interest at the legal rate and 
court costs. In filling out this section: 

*  The amount of money being claimed should be put on the first line and should not include interest. 

*  Be sure to complete all other relief which you are seeking. 

* 

If interest is sought at a contractual rate, which is higher than the legal rate, a copy of the contract 
must be attached to the complaint. Interest cannot be compounded. 

(M)  Finally, be sure to date and sign your complaint. All Plaintiffs listed must sign the complaint. Once completed 
submit your complaint form along with the filing fee to the Court.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILING COMPLAINT 
FOR RETURN OF SECURITY DEPOSIT 
(DEBT ACTION) 

Before initiating a case, you should review the booklet entitled How to File and Defend a Civil Case in the 
Justice of the Peace Court of the State of Delaware.  This booklet will explain the process involved. In order to 
initiate a case, you must fill out the Complaint (J.P. Civil Form No. 1) and submit it, along with the filing fee, to 
the Court. The attached form may be used as an example to help fill out a complaint for the return of a security 
deposit. . More information is available at https://courts.delaware.gov/jpcourt/ including interactive forms. 

(The following information is not legal advice and is not a substitute for seeking legal advice from an attorney. 
This information is not binding on the Court if incorrect or misunderstood. The sample form and instructions are 
illustrative only and may or may not apply to the specific facts of your case.) 

The sections of the sample complaint will be identified by capital letters in parentheses, i.e., (A), (B). These 

do not appear on the actual complaint but are used to help you follow the instructions to the sample form. 

(A)  Fill in the County, Court No. and Court Address. You should leave blank the space for "Civil Action No." 
The Court will assign a case number for a new filing. 

(B) 
In the section marked PLAINTIFF(S), you must fill in your name, address, telephone number and email. If 
you are not the only plaintiff, you must include the same information for all other plaintiffs in the case. Each party 
must be listed separately. If you have filed a case before, you may include previous System ID # created by the 
Court under Plaintiff information. If you have more than 2 plaintiffs, please use the Civil Form CF01AP for the 
additional parties. If any of the parties address’ have changed check the box under their name that indicates an 
address change. 

(C) 
In the section marked DEFENDANT(S), you must fill in the name, address, phone number and email of each 
defendant. It is extremely important that the addresses given the Court are complete and correct. If the party 
you are suing has a post office box, you must include their street address as well as their post office box. If you are 
suing a husband and wife, you must list the name of both spouses. If you have filed against defendant before, you 
may include previous System ID # created by the Court under Defendant information. If you have more than 2 
defendants, please use the Civil Form CF01AP for the additional parties. 

(D) 

If you are represented by an attorney, the attorney must submit the filing  electronically. 

(E)  You should also fill in the name of the defendant's attorney, if any, and the attorney's address and phone 
number, if known. You may leave this blank or write unknown if you do not know if the defendant has an attorney. 
The defendant’s attorney is required to enter their appearance with the court. 

(F)  You must state whether you are an individual or corporation or other artificial entity. If you are suing as an 
artificial entity and are not represented by an attorney, a valid Form 50 must be attached to the complaint. A Form 
50 permits a person who is not an attorney to represent an artificial entity in the Justice of the Peace Court. If you 
do not have a valid Form 50, you must obtain one from the Chief Magistrate’s office. 

(G)  You must indicate whether the party you are suing, is an individual,  corporation, or other artificial entity. 
(The defendant will also be required to file a Form 50 if it is an artificial entity and does not wish to be represented 
by an attorney). 

(H)  Type of Service. The Court will attempt to serve (deliver to) the defendant unless you tell the Court that you 
wish to hire a special process server (SPS). A Special Process Server (SPS) is an individual approved by the Court 
to serve  documents in lieu of the Court. If selecting a Special Process Server (SPS), be sure to indicate the name and 
phone number of the Special Process Server (SPS) next to your selection. You should contact a Special Process

(I)  Alternate Address. This should be left blank. Type of Action. Check Debt. (Since possession of the rental 
unit is not claimed, this is a debt rather than a summary possession action.) 

(J)  Concise Statement of Facts. A debt action is a claim for a sum of money – in this case, for the return of a 
security deposit. Although only a very short statement of facts is required, it should state: 

1.  when the unit was leased from the defendant and when the lease ended. 
2. 
the date that the landlord was asked in writing for the deposit; and 
3.  either that the defendant has not returned the security deposit or an itemized list of the damages or that the 
defendant  has  returned  a  list  of  itemized  damages  and  that  the  plaintiff  disputes  some  or  all  of  these 
damages. 

4.  Specify the rental unit address for which you are seeking the return of the security deposit. 

If the landlord fails to remit the security deposit or the difference between the security deposit and the amount 
set forth in the list of damages within 20 days from the expiration or termination of the lease, the tenant shall be 
entitled to double the amount wrongfully withheld. 25 Del.C. § 5514(g)(1). However, a doubling of the amount 
due may be awarded only if a forwarding address is provided to the landlord at or prior to the termination 
of the rental agreement. For those seeking double the security deposit, the complaint should state the date 
of  the  expiration  or  termination  of  the  lease  and  the  date  the  forwarding  address  was  provided  to  the 
landlord. 

(K)  Relief Sought. In this section, you should state what you want to obtain as a result of the suit. 

*  The amount of money being claimed should be put on the first line and should not include interest. If 
double the security deposit is being sought, that amount should be specified on the first line. 
*  Be sure to complete all other relief which you are seeking. 

(L)  Finally, be sure to date and sign your complaint. All Plaintiffs listed must sign the complaint. Once completed 
submit your complaint form along with the filing fee to the Court

I am a former tenant of Ms. Doe’s the lease ended on 8/31/2021. I moved out on 8/27/2021 and gave 
her my forwarding address on that day. Despite having my new address, Ms. Doe has not sent me 
either a list of damages or my security deposit, pursuant to the Landlord Tenant Code 
(25Del.C.Sec.5514). I had a forward of mail set up with the Post Office and she did not send it to my 
old address either. I have attempted to contact her, but she has not returned my calls. Because more 
than 20 days have passed since the termination of my lease, I am seeking the return of double my 
  $500.00 Security Deposit ($1000.00).

INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILING COMPLAINT SUMMARY POSSESSION ACTION 

Before initiating a case, you should review the booklet entitled How to File and Defend a Civil Case in 
the Justice of the Peace Court of the State of Delaware. This booklet will explain the process involved. In order to 
initiate a case, you must fill out the Complaint (J.P. Civil Form No. 1) and submit it, along with the filing fee, to 
the Court. If you determine that your case is a SUMMARY POSSESSION action, you may use the attached form 
as  an  example  and  follow  the  directions  below  for  filling  out  the  complaint.  More  information  is  available  at 
https://courts.delaware.gov/jpcourt/ including interactive forms. 

(The following information is not legal advice and is not a substitute for seeking legal advice from an attorney. 
This information is not binding on the Court if incorrect or misunderstood. The sample form and instructions are 
illustrative only and may or may not apply to the specific facts of your case.) 

The sections of the sample complaint will be identified by capital letters in parentheses, i.e., (A), (B). 

These do not appear on the actual complaint but are used to help you follow the instructions to the sample form. 

(A)  Fill in the County, Court No. and Court Address. You should leave blank the space for "Civil Action No." 
The Court will assign a case number for a new filing. 

(B) 
In the section marked PLAINTIFF(S), you must fill in your name, address, telephone number and email. If 
you are not the only plaintiff, you must include the same information for all other plaintiffs in the case. Each party 
must be listed separately. If you have filed a case before, you may include previous System ID # created by the 
Court under Plaintiff information. If you have more than 2 plaintiffs, please use the Civil Form CF01AP for the 
additional parties. If any of the parties address’ have changed check the box under their name that indicates an 
address change. 

(C) 
In the section marked DEFENDANT(S), you must fill in the name, address, phone number and email of each 
defendant. It is extremely important that the addresses given the Court are complete and correct. If the party 
you are suing has a post office box, you must include their street address as well as their post office box. If you are 
suing a husband and wife, you must list the name of each spouse. If you have filed against defendant before, you 
may include previous System ID # created by the Court under Defendant information. If you have more than 2 
defendants, please use the Civil Form CF01AP for the additional parties. 

(D) 

If you are represented by an attorney, the attorney must submit the filing electronically. 

(E)  You should also fill in the name of the defendant's attorney, if any, and the attorney's address and phone 
number, if known. You may leave this blank or write unknown if you do not know if the defendant has an attorney. 
The defendant’s attorney is required to enter their appearance with the court. 

(F)  You must state whether you are an individual or corporation or other artificial entity. If you are suing as an 
artificial entity and are not represented by an attorney, a valid Form 50 must be attached to the complaint. A Form 
50 permits a person who is not an attorney to represent an artificial entity in the Justice of the Peace Court. If you 
do not have a valid Form 50, you must obtain one from the Chief Magistrate’s office. 

(G)  You must indicate whether the party you are suing, is an individual, corporation, or other artificial entity. 
(The defendant will also be required to file a Form 50 if it is an artificial entity and does not wish to be represented 
by an attorney). 

(H) 
) Type of Service. The Court will attempt to serve (deliver to) the defendant unless you tell the Court that 
you wish to hire a special process server (SPS). A Special Process Server (SPS) is an individual approved by the 
Court to serve  documents in lieu of the Court. If selecting a Special Process Server (SPS), be sure to indicate the 
name and phone number of the Special Process Server (SPS) next to your selection. You should contact a Special 
Process Server (SPS) prior to  filing your complaint. There is a list of Court Approved Special Process Servers 
(SPS) available at any JP Civil Court location.

(I)  Alternate Address. Select rental and fill in the street address of the unit for which you are seeking summary 
possession. 

(J)  Type of Action. Check Summary Possession. Check the appropriate box to indicate if the rental unit is a 
commercial or residential unit. 

(K)  Concise Statement of Facts. Although only a very short statement of facts is required, it is important that you 
include essential information. You may attach additional pages if necessary. The following must be included in a 
complaint for Summary Possession. 

1) The relationship of the plaintiff and defendant with regard to the rental unit (e.g., landlord and tenant). 
2) The address of the rental unit, including the unit number. 
3) A statement of the facts upon which the claim is based. A copy of any written notice of the basis of the 
claim must be attached. For example, if you are seeking possession of a rental unit for failure to pay rent, 
the 5-day notice required by 25 Del.C. § 5502 should be attached. 
4) A statement of what you seek in the action. 

In addition, for a landlord seeking possession because the tenant has violated a rule relating to the tenant’s use of 

the rental unit, the following information must also be included: 

1) The rule or provision of the rental agreement allegedly broken, the date the tenant was told of the rule, 
and the way in which the tenant was told about the rule (e.g., handed to tenant, mailed). A copy of the rule, 
as originally provided to the tenant must be attached. 
2) Facts showing that the rule was broken and that notice as required by law was given to the tenant. 
3) Facts showing a continued or recurring violation of the rule. 
4) A statement of the purpose served by this rule. 
5) If the rule did not exist when the tenant entered into the rental agreement, a statement that it does not 
work a substantial modification of the tenant’s bargain, or if it does, that the tenant consented knowingly in 
writing to the rule. 

The requirements of the complaint are specified in 25 Del.C. § 5707 and 5708 (if applicable). 

(L)  Relief Sought. This section asks you to indicate what you want to obtain as a result of your suit. In the sample 
complaint, the relief sought is possession plus back rent and late fees. 

*  The amount of money which is being claimed should be put on the first line and should not include 
interest. Any claim for late fees should be included in this amount. 
*  Be sure to complete all other relief which you are seeking. 
*  Be sure to check the box indicating that you want possession. 
*  Be sure to indicate whether you wish to have a jury trial or not. 

(M)  Finally, be sure to date and sign your complaint. All Plaintiffs listed must sign the complaint. Once completed 
submit your complaint form along with the filing fee to the Court.

1.  Concise Statement of Facts: (Who, What, When, Where, How?) 
Jane Doe signed lease with me (landlord/Plaintiff) to rent the above listed apartment in May of 2019. 
The lease called for a rental payment of $450.00 per month to be paid on the 1st of each month, with 
a late fee of $20.00 if rent is paid after the 5th of the month. Ms Doe failed to pay rent for August 
2021. Pursuant to the Landlord-Tenant Code, I sent a 5-day letter certified mail. (See copy enclosed) 
She failed to respond, so I am seeking rent plus possession..

(The following information is not legal advice and is not a substitute for seeking legal advice from an attorney. 
This information is not binding on the Court if incorrect or misunderstood. The sample form and instructions are 
illustrative only and may or may not apply to the specific facts of your case.) 

The sections of the sample complaint will be identified by capital letters in parentheses, i.e., (A), (B). These 

do not appear on the actual complaint but are used to help you follow the instructions to the sample form. 

(A)  Fill in the County, Court No. and Court Address. You should leave blank the space for "Civil Action No." 
The Court will assign a new case number for a new filing. 

(B) 
In the section marked PLAINTIFF(S), you must fill in your name, address, telephone number and email. If 
you are not the only plaintiff, you must include the same information for all other plaintiffs in the case. Each party 
must be listed separately. If you have filed a case before, you may include previous System ID # created by the 
Court under Plaintiff information. If you have more than 2 plaintiffs, please use the Civil Form CF01AP for the 
additional parties. If any of the parties address’ have changed check the box under their name that indicates an 
address change. 

(C) 
In the section marked DEFENDANT(S), you must fill in the name, address, phone number and email of each

(G)  You must indicate whether the party you are suing, is an individual, corporation, or other artificial entity.

1.  Concise Statement of Facts: (Who, What, When, Where, How?) 
I, John Smith, own the property located at 458 Nemo Avenue, next door to Ms. Doe. On Saturday 
8/7/2021, Ms. Doe was cutting down a large pine tree in her back yard. When the tree dropped, it 
landed on my lawn mower that I let my tenants use to cut the grass. I replaced the mower with a 
similar model from Sears, as the old one was destroyed. The new mower costs $189.00. Despite a 
  written demand, Ms. Dow has refused to reimburse me for the cost of the mower.
