Preparation 

Form  192  is  one  of  two  documents  that  must  accompany  a  motion  at  the  time  it  is  filed  in 
Family  Court  in  accordance  with  Family  Court  Rule  7(b)(1).    Its  purpose  is  to  act  as  an 
informational cover sheet which the movant attaches to the copy of the motion that he/she is 
sending to the other party(ies) in the matter.  In this way, the other party(ies) are notified that 
a motion has been filed in Family Court on a matter in which they have an interest. 

Form  192  is  prepared  by  the  movant,  or  party  filing  the  motion.    The  original  is  submitted 
along with the motion (Form 191) and the form of order (Form 193) at the time of the filing of 
the motion in Family Court.  It is the responsibility of the movant to send a copy of all three 
forms,  completed  as  appropriate,  to  the  other  party(ies).    Once  it  has  been  filed  with  the 
Court, the motion package is sent to Case Processing and then to a judge/commissioner for 
review.  The notice of motion must be served according to Family Court Civil Rule 5(c).

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
