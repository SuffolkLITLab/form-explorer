      <pre>DELAWARE SUPREME COURT INTERNAL OPERATING PROCEDURES 

   I.  Introduction. 

 

These operating procedures are intended to provide a general understanding to the public, 

the practicing bar, other  courts,  and the Supreme Court’s  own  staff  of  how the Supreme Court 

typically operates.  As should be expected, the operating procedures are subordinate to the Court’s 

duty  to  comply  with  the  Constitution,  statutes,  and  the  Court’s  Rules,  and  its  overarching 

commitment to doing justice in the diverse procedural circumstances in which cases arise.  When 

the need to do justice requires, the Court may deviate from these procedures, but they are intended 

to represent how the Court operates in the ordinary course.   

 

Consistent with their purpose, these operating procedures are not intended to cover the key 

procedures that litigants in the Supreme Court must follow.  Those are primarily incorporated in 

the Court’s Rules and in relevant constitutional and statutory provisions.  Rather, these operating 

procedures  are  intended  to  supplement  the  Court’s  Rules  and  governing  statutes,  so  as  to  give 

greater insight into the Court’s typical operations. 

  II.  Court Administration. 

(1) Supervisory powers.  The Chief Justice is the “administrative head of all the Courts in 

the State” with “general administrative and supervisory powers over all the Courts.”  Del. Const. 

art. IV, §  13.  Approval  by a  majority  of the Justices of the  Supreme  Court is  required for the 

adoption of rules for  the administration  of justice  and the conduct  of the  business  of all of the 

courts of the State. 

(2) Administrative meetings.   The Justices shall  meet at  the call of  the Chief Justice on 

administrative  matters.    Any  Justice  may  request  that  an  item  be  placed  on  the  agenda  for  an 

administrative meeting or that an administrative meeting be scheduled to discuss an item. 

 

Page 1 of 24 

(3)  Liaison  Justices.  The  Chief  Justice  has  the  discretion  to  appoint  Justices  to 

administrative committees, and can designate Justices to act as liaisons to other courts and boards 

established by the Supreme Court.  Some examples of such boards have traditionally included: 

(a) the Board of Bar Examiners; 

(b) the Board on Professional Responsibility; 

(c) the Permanent Advisory Committee on the Supreme Court Rules; and 

(d) the Trustees of the Lawyers’ Fund for Client Protection. 

(4) Administration of the Supreme Court.  The administrative head of the Court is the Chief 

Justice.  The Chief Justice administers the Court’s operations in consultation with the other Justices 

and oversees the Court’s administrative staff.  Subject to the direction of  the Chief Justice, the 

Court  Administrator  is  responsible  for  all  administrative  matters  for  the  Court.    The  Court 

Administrator also acts as the Chief Public Information Officer for the Court, with assistance from 

the Administrative Office of the Courts. 

Court.  Its responsibilities include: 

(5) Clerk’s Office.  The Clerk’s Office is responsible for processing all cases filed in the 

(a) maintaining the automated docket that records each filing in each case; 

(b) conducting a preliminary review of the jurisdictional basis for all appeals; 

(c) reviewing all filings for compliance with Court rules; 

(d) coordinating requests for extensions of time by parties or court reporters; 

(e) acting as custodian of the Court’s records; 

(f) circulating filings for action by the Justices; 

(g) under the direction of the Chief Justice and with input from the Chief Staff Attorney, 

scheduling cases for oral argument or decision on the briefs; and 

 

Page 2 of 24 

(h) acting upon motions as authorized by the Court. 

(6) Chief Staff Attorney.  Under the direction of the Chief Justice, the Chief Staff Attorney 

supervises a staff of attorneys who assist the Court in carrying out its constitutional responsibilities.  

The Chief Staff Attorney also serves as Counsel to the Chief Justice and advises and assists the 

Chief  Justice,  as  requested,  on  matters  of  policy  arising  from  the  Chief  Justice’s  role  as  the 

administrative head of the Supreme Court and of all of the courts in the State. 

III.  Caseload Management. 

(1) Judicial assignments.  The Clerk’s Office traditionally maintains a confidential list of 

the current caseload of each Justice.  This list shows the pending cases that have been decided and 

assigned to each Justice for preparation of opinions or orders.  The list is maintained electronically 

and  is  available  to  Court  staff  only.    The  list  is  taken  into  consideration  in  determining  the 

allocation of additional assignments. 

(2) Dispositions.  Each Justice is obligated to decide all assigned matters within 90 days of 

submission.  If any matter is pending before a Justice beyond 90 days, that Justice must file a report 

with the Chief Justice by the 10th day of the next month with an explanation for the delay.    For 

cases where oral argument is scheduled, a matter is deemed submitted on the later of the date of 

the oral argument or the completion of supplemental briefing.   For cases  decided  on  the briefs 

without oral argument, a matter shall be deemed submitted on the date the Court schedules the 

(3) Docket control.  The Clerk maintains, and makes available electronically to the Justices, 

lists helpful to ensuring the timely disposition of the Court’s docket.  Such lists have traditionally 

matter for submission. 

included categories such as: 

(a) all pending motions; 

 

Page 3 of 24 

(b)  cases  that  have  been  presented  orally  or  submitted  on  the  briefs  that  are  awaiting 

(c) cases at issue but not yet scheduled for oral arguments or assigned to a panel for decision 

decision; 

on the briefs; 

(d) cases that are stayed;  

(e) cases that were remanded with jurisdiction retained; 

(f) pending Board on Professional Responsibility cases; 

(g) pending death penalty cases; and 

(h) pending termination of parental rights cases. 

IV.  Communications With And By The Court. 

Although the Court Administrator acts as the Chief Public Information Officer of the Court, 

contact outside the courtroom with counsel or the public may be conducted by the Court Clerk, a 

Deputy Clerk, the Chief Staff Attorney, or the Court Administrator.  Speaking for the Court in this 

capacity does not authorize any of these individuals to waive the requirements of any statute or 

rule. 

V.  Communication Within The Court Regarding The Resolution of Cases. 

  

(1) Internal communications.  Because the Supreme Court is a collegial body, the Justices 

typically endeavor to confer with each other simultaneously about cases, either in writing, by joint 

telephone conference, or in person. 

(2)  Typical  pre-submission  communications.    Before  scheduled  sittings,  each  Justice 

independently reviews the briefs and appendices unless specifically agreed otherwise in a given 

case.  Neither the Justices nor their law clerks discuss the merits of a matter between chambers 

before oral argument or the date of submission for cases submitted on briefs. 

 

Page 4 of 24 

 

In particular situations, however, the Justices assigned to decide a case may determine it 

would be useful to confer in advance of oral argument or the date of submission of a case to be 

decided without argument on the briefs.  For example, in an expedited case where a decision is 

required at or shortly after oral argument, the Justices may determine that it is advisable to circulate 

preliminary thoughts and key questions based on their reading of the briefs and record on appeal, 

so that the Justices can best prepare for oral argument, oral argument can be the most helpful to 

reaching a sound decision, and the Justices can issue their decision with the requisite speed.  In 

these circumstances, all of the Justices assigned to decide a case should discuss the approach to 

communication and endeavor to reach consensus. 

  

(3)  Typical  post-submission  practices.    After  the  primary  responsibility  to  propose  a 

resolution of a case has been assigned to a Justice, the Justices assigned to decide the case typically 

will consider any change in the agreed resolution of the case by communicating simultaneously 

with each other in writing or by an in-person or telephonic conference.  In any situation where 

there is going to be a discussion that involves consideration of whether a Justice assigned to the 

matter will change her view as to the ultimate resolution of the appeal, the Court’s tradition as a 

collegial, deliberative body counsels for the inclusion of all Justices assigned to the matter.  Thus, 

if  there  is  going  to  be  a  discussion  of  changing  the  resolution  agreed  upon  at  the  decisional 

conference, all Justices assigned to the case should be included. 

  

(4)  Post-submission  conferences.    The  Court’s  general  policy  supporting  discussions 

among all Justices assigned to hear a case does not mean, however, that the Justice assigned to 

draft a decision may not confer with a colleague to get that colleague’s help during the drafting 

process, when that consultation only involves how to implement the decision reached by all of the 

Justices assigned to the case at conference.  It is common in any business or law firm that everyone 

 

Page 5 of 24 

involved in a matter may not be able to confer at all times.  Consistent with the Court’s collegial 

tradition,  collaboration  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  Court’s  decisions  is  appropriate  and  an 

important part of its effectiveness as an appellate court. 

VI.  Timing Of Issuance Of Opinions To Be Courteous To Counsel And Clients. 

 

The Supreme Court realizes that its decisions are important to the parties involved and that 

when attorneys receive decisions, they then have a duty to forward them to their clients and to 

confer with their clients about the effect of the Court’s resolution of the matter.  Accordingly, the 

Supreme Court endeavors to issue its decisions at a time of day that does not impose an undue 

burden on counsel to have to consult with clients after normal business hours, or the hours leading 

to the weekend.    

 

Thus,  on  Monday  to  Thursday,  the  Court  will  endeavor  not  to  issue  decisions  in  non-

expedited cases after 4:30 p.m., and on Friday, after 2:00 p.m.   

VII.  Briefs And Preparation. 

The  Clerk’s  Office  distributes  briefs  and  appendices  sufficiently  far  in  advance  of  a 

scheduled submission or argument date to afford several weeks of study in chambers before the 

panel is scheduled to sit or convene.  In special circumstances, such as expedited cases, the panel 

may agree to a shorter reading period.  Two sets of briefs and appendices are furnished to each 

chambers. 

VIII.  Oral Argument. 

(1) Selection of cases.  

(a) Scheduling generally.  The Clerk and Chief Staff Attorney schedule arguments under 

the  direct  supervision  of  the  Chief  Justice.    The  Clerk,  in  consultation  with  the  Chief  Staff 

Attorney, prepares a draft oral argument list and schedule of decisions to be made on the briefs.  

 

Page 6 of 24 

After the Chief Justice has approved the oral argument list, it is circulated by the Clerk to all of 

the Justices.  The list is updated periodically throughout the month and redistributed as needed. 

(b)  Counsel  requests.    Consideration  is  given  to  written  requests  by  counsel  for  oral 

argument, but such requests are not binding on the Court. 

(c) Justice requests.  Upon the request of any Justice, a case not already recommended for 

oral argument may be added to the oral argument list. 

(2) Suggested criteria for oral argument.  

(a) Argument unnecessary.  The Justices usually will dispense with oral argument when: 

(i) The issue is not novel and the briefs adequately cover the arguments; or 

(ii)  The  outcome  of  the  appeal  is  clearly  controlled  by  a  decision  of  the  United 

States Supreme Court or this Court; or 

(iii) The factual state of the record will determine the outcome and the sole issue is 

either  sufficiency  of  the  evidence,  the  adequacy  of  jury  instructions,  or 

discretionary rulings, and the briefs refer to the record adequately. 

(b) Argument desirable.  The Justices usually request oral argument when: 

 

(i) The appeal presents a substantial or novel legal issue; 

(ii) The resolution of an issue presented  by the appeal will be  of institutional  or 

precedential value; 

procedural points; 

(iii)  The  Justices  have  questions  to  ask  counsel  to  clarify  legal,  factual,  or 

(iv) A decision, legislative act, or another event that occurred after the filing of the 

last brief filed may significantly bear on the case; or 

 

(v) An important public policy issue is implicated. 

 

Page 7 of 24 

The foregoing criteria are illustrations and not limitations on any Justice’s discretion in 

voting for oral argument. 

(3) Notice to counsel.  The Clerk provides timely advance notice to counsel in each case 

whether the case is to be argued orally or submitted on the briefs.  The composition of the panel is 

not disclosed to counsel before oral argument.  If the case is submitted for consideration on the 

briefs, counsel are notified in writing of the submission date but not the panel composition.  The 

panel composition is available, however, upon request after the submission date.  Unless otherwise 

specified, oral arguments are held in Dover on Wednesdays, as scheduled by the Court. 

IX.  Panel Hearings. 

three Justices. 

(1) Panels.  Except in death penalty appeals or other cases where the Court has determined 

that en banc consideration is desirable, cases are typically assigned for consideration to a panel of 

(2) Composition of panel.  The composition of a panel is typically random. Unless there 

are disqualifications, vacancies, or other scheduling conflicts by three or more Justices, each panel 

includes only active Justices of the Court.  Other than hearings by the Court en banc, a rotating 

schedule  automatically  designates  the  three-Justice  panels  to  hear  each  case,  taking  into 

consideration any notices of disqualification which have been filed.  The Court also seeks an even 

distribution of the judicial caseload between all panels and Justices.  Panels are not composed with 

a  view  to  the  matter  in  dispute.    There  is  thus  no  consideration  of  developing  subject  matter 

specialists among the Justices when making case assignments. 

(3) Identity of panel.  The composition of a panel for a given case is not announced before 

oral  argument.    When  cases  are  considered  on  the  briefs  without  oral  argument,  counsel  are 

informed that such submission on the briefs has taken place.  The names of the panel members are 

 

Page 8 of 24 

not  disclosed  unless  requested  by  counsel  for  any  party  after  a  submission  on  the  briefs.    The 

Clerk’s office does add the panel’s identity to the docket sheet after the date of submission on the 

briefs. 

(4) Presiding Justice.   The Chief Justice is the  presiding Justice.    In  the  absence of the 

Chief Justice, the presiding Justice is that Justice of the Court in active service next in seniority. 

(5) Seating in Court.  The panel assembles in the robing room before the opening of Court.  

The next-ranking Justice sits to the right of the presiding Justice facing the courtroom from the 

bench.    Seating  of  the  Justices  continues  from  left  to  right  in  order  of  the  seniority  of  their 

commissions, followed by visiting active or retired jurists. 

(6) Conflict of precedent.  The holding of the Court en banc or a panel in an opinion or 

order is binding on the  entire  court and  on subsequent  panels.    Thus,  no subsequent panel  can 

overrule a prior holding of the Court without consideration by the Court en banc. 

X.  En Banc Hearing. 

The Chief Justice may order any matter to be determined by the Court en banc upon the 

briefs or upon oral argument.  In addition, there shall be a determination by the Court en banc upon 

the briefs or upon oral argument in the following circumstances: 

(1) upon direct appeal in death penalty cases; 

(2) upon a motion for postconviction relief in death penalty cases; 

(3) when a panel of this Court indicates possible disagreement; 

(4) when there is a reasonable likelihood that a prior decision of this Court may be modified 

or overruled; 

(5) upon the affirmative vote of two or more Justices; and 

(6) in such other cases as the Court by rule or the General Assembly by two-thirds vote 

 

Page 9 of 24 

shall determine.  See Del. Const. art. IV, § 12. 

XI.  Opinion Of The Justices Sought Under 10 Del. C. § 141. 

(1) Hearing.  By custom, the Chief Justice has convened the Justices to sit en banc when 

the “opinion of the Justices” is sought by the Governor or the General Assembly under 10 Del. C. 

§ 141.  See Supr. Ct. R. 44. 

questions presented to the Justices. 

(2) Counsel.  The Court will appoint pro bono counsel to brief and argue each side of the 

(3) Opinion format.  Although each Justice is asked for an “opinion,” the Justices may join 

in signing one opinion, as has frequently been the custom. 

XII.  Decisional Conference Procedure. 

(1) Post-argument.  As previously discussed in Section V, in cases where oral argument is 

held, the first time the Justices exchange opinions concerning the merits of a case is ordinarily at 

a post-argument conference held immediately after, or closely following, the oral argument.  The 

Justice who presided at the argument initiates the discussion.  That senior Justice invites comments 

on the case and a tentative vote by each of the other Justices.  The Justices ordinarily comment and 

cast tentative votes in reverse order of seniority. 

(2) Submission on briefs.  A corresponding decisional conference, in person, by telephone, 

or  in  writing,  is  held  in  cases  heard  on  the  briefs,  generally  on  the  same  day  those  cases  are 

submitted or closely following the submission date.  

(3) Assignment of disposition.  If the Justices are in agreement, the panel then decides how 

the decision of the Court should be announced: i.e., through a signed opinion, per curiam opinion, 

or order.  The presiding Justice then assigns the case to a member of the panel for preparation of a 

proposed order or opinion.  If there is a dissent or potential dissent in a case heard by a three-

 

Page 10 of 24 

Justice  panel,  the  Chief  Justice  is  notified  by  the  presiding  Justice,  the  case  is  put  down  for 

rehearing en banc, and no assignment is made. 

(4) Tentative views.  Any of the Justices, including the Justice assigned to write the order 

or the opinion, may change her mind while the opinion or order is being prepared or after a draft 

has been circulated.  Continuing written or oral communications among the panel about the opinion 

or order while it is being drafted are common.  If at any time before the release of the opinion or 

order, the three Justices cease to be unanimous  in their  view of  the  resolution  of  the  case or it 

becomes apparent that a prior precedent may be modified or overruled, an en banc rehearing is 

ordered. 

(5) Issuance of decision.  

(a) Notifying counsel.  The opinions and orders containing  final decisions issued under 

Supreme Court Rule 17 are electronically filed, and counsel receive the decisions through File and 

Serve Xpress.  Pro se litigants who do not have a File and Serve Xpress account receive copies of 

court decisions by first class mail.  Telephone notification may also be made by the Clerk’s office, 

the Chief Staff Attorney, or a Justice’s chambers staff. 

(b) Notifying trial court.  The named author of the decision provides a copy of the final 

decision through File and Serve Xpress to the trial judge. 

(c) Notifying public.  Copies of all final decisions are provided to the Court Administrator’s 

assistant for posting on the Court’s website.  

(6) Issuance of mandate.  

 (a) Unless a motion for reargument or a motion for rehearing en banc is filed, a mandate 

shall issue upon the expiration of the 15-day period allowed for such motions. 

(b)  Immediately.    The  Court  sitting  as  a  panel  or  en  banc  routinely  issues  the  mandate 

 

Page 11 of 24 

“forthwith,”  immediately  following  the  announcement  of  an  oral  decision  in  an  expedited 

proceeding.  See, e.g., Paramount Commc’ns, Inc. v. Time, Inc., 571 A.2d 1140 (Del. 1990); Mills 

Acquisition Co. v. Macmillan, Inc., 559 A.2d 1261, 1265 n.2 (Del. 1988). 

(c) Expedited.  The Court has the authority to reduce the time in which the mandate will 

issue for other reasons, such as the retirement of a Justice.  

XIII.  Opinions. 

(1) Form of opinions.  

(a) Identified author.  The primary author is identified on the first page of the opinion.  

(b)  Per  curiam  opinions.    A  per  curiam  opinion  may  be  used  for  affirming,  reversing, 

remanding,  or  dismissing  an  appeal.    Per  curiam  opinions  are  generally  used  when  the  Court 

wishes to speak with one voice, especially in disciplinary matters. 

(c) Special contents.  Each written opinion of the Court shall include immediately under 

the caption of the case: 

(i) the date of submission of the matter for decision;  

(ii) the date the opinion is filed; and 

(iii) the name of the attorneys appearing on the briefs for each party and, if the case was 

argued, who presented the oral argument by a parenthetical to that effect after their names. 

(2) Circulation of opinions for approval.  

(a) Review of a draft is given priority.  After the draft opinion or order has been prepared, 

the Justice who was the named author circulates it to the other members of the panel only, with a 

request for approval or suggestions.  Answering this request is given the highest priority by the 

other Justices, who shall communicate in writing their approval, disapproval, or suggestions within 

a few days of receipt of the draft opinion or order. 

 

Page 12 of 24 

(b) Suggestions for modification.  Because it is the decision of the Court, other members 

of  the  panel  are  free  to  make  any  suggestions  relating  to  the  modification  of,  addition  to,  or 

subtraction from the proposed text.  A Justice proposing a textual revision or addition typically 

submits modifications  in specific language capable of being  inserted  into  the  opinion or  order.  

When the other Justices approve the suggestions, the draft becomes the opinion or order of the 

Court. 

(3) 90-day period and draft decision-writing.  The Justice who will be the named author is 

expected to transmit to the panel a draft opinion or order sufficiently far in advance to permit the 

final  opinion  or  order  to  issue  within  ninety  days  after  submission  or  after  any  supplemental 

briefing has been filed or other factors that suspend the drafting process. 

(4) Procedure for approval.  The Justice assigned to prepare the opinion furnishes each 

member  of  the  panel  with  a  copy  of  the  proposed  opinion.    The  panel  members  indicate  their 

approval, disapproval, or comments in writing. 

(5) Concurring and dissenting opinions.  If a member of a three-Justice panel desires to 

concur  separately,  the  Justice  not  joining  in  the  opinion  or  order  notifies  the  writing  Justice 

promptly and transmits those separate views to the panel.  Panel opinions shall not be issued until 

each member has had an opportunity to respond to the other panel members in writing.  The same 

procedure is followed for concurring and dissenting opinions in an en banc proceeding. 

(6)  Filing  of  opinions  and  orders.    Opinions  and  orders  of  the  panel  that  unanimously 

affirm or reverse the trial court or dismiss the appeal are filed with the Clerk by the Justice who is 

the named author.  

(7)  Publication  of  opinions  and  orders.    The  Clerk’s  office  promptly  forwards  to  any 

publisher  designated  by  the  Court  all  opinions  and  case-dispositive  orders  designated  for 

 

Page 13 of 24 

publication and also ensures that a copy of the decision is available on the Court’s website.  

XIV.  Judgment Orders. 

unanimous decision of the panel. 

(1) Panel unanimity.  A case may be terminated in this Court by a judgment order upon the 

(2) Criteria for disposition by order.  A case may be finally determined or terminated by 

written order, among other reasons, if: 

(a) the issue on appeal is controlled by settled Delaware law; 

(b) the issue on appeal is factual and there is sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict 

or findings of fact below;  

(c) the issue on appeal is one of judicial discretion and there was no abuse of discretion; or 

(d) the trial judge’s determinations of fact and law are correct and there is no reason for the 

Supreme Court to repeat the reasoning articulated in support of them.  

(3) Form of order.  

(a) An order  affirming the trial court usually includes a brief statement of the facts, the 

issues raised by appellant, and the reasons for the panel’s decision. 

(b) Alternatively, an order may state that the case is affirmed by reference to the opinion 

of  the  trial  court  or  the  decision  of  the  administrative  agency  and  may  contain  one  or  more 

references to cases or other authorities. 

and the date the order is issued. 

(c) Each dispositive order of the Court shall include the date of submission of the matter 

(4)  Procedure  for  approval. 

  The  procedure  for  approving  orders  by  written 

acknowledgement is the same procedure which is used to approve opinions.

XV.  Remand Orders. 

(1) Assignment following remand.  When a report is filed in a case that has been remanded 

with  jurisdiction  retained  under  Rule  19(c),  the  Clerk  will  assign  the  appeal  to  the  same  panel 

unless directed otherwise by the Chief Justice. 

(2) Reversal and remand.  In those instances when a panel reverses and remands a case, 

jurisdiction is generally not retained, and a mandate issues for further proceedings in accordance 

with this Court’s decision. 

XVI.  Reargument by Panel. 

(1) Distinguished  from rehearing en banc.   A  motion for rehearing  before  the Court en 

banc is to be distinguished from a motion for reargument by a panel.  The former is a request for 

de  novo  consideration,  whereas  the  latter  seeks  reconsideration  by  the  same  panel  which  has 

already made a ruling. 

(2) Request for answer.  If any member of the panel timely notifies the other members of 

the panel that an answer is desired, the named author of the original decision instructs the Clerk to 

direct that an answer be filed and the time period for its filing.  The Clerk forwards the answer to 

the panel members. 

(3) Internal process of motion.  

(a) Consideration.  If a motion for reargument before the panel is filed simultaneously with 

a motion for a rehearing en banc, the motion for reargument is processed first. 

(b) Circulation.  The motion is circulated to the entire panel by the Clerk’s office. 

(c) Lead Justice.  The lead Justice (the named author of the opinion or order) circulates a 

memorandum setting forth the author’s position to the other two panel members only.  The other 

panel members respond to the suggested disposition in writing. 

 

Page 15 of 24 

(4) Disposition.  Two members of a panel must vote in favor of reargument for it to be 

granted. 

XVII.  Rehearing En Banc. 

(1) Circulation of motion for rehearing en banc.  

(a) Reargument granted.  If a motion for reargument is granted, a simultaneous motion for 

rehearing en banc is implicitly denied. 

(b) Reargument denied.  If the motion for reargument is denied and a simultaneous motion 

for rehearing en banc has been filed, the latter motion is circulated. 

(c) Recommended disposition.  A memorandum is then circulated to the other qualified 

members of the Court by the author of the opinion or order, stating that the panel has denied the 

motion for reargument, and attaching a copy of the motion for rehearing en banc with the panel’s 

recommended disposition of the motion for rehearing en banc. 

(d) En banc motion only.  If only a motion for rehearing en banc is filed, the Justice who 

was the named author of the opinion or order typically takes the lead by circulating the motion 

with a suggested disposition to the other qualified Justices, in the same manner that a motion for 

reargument is processed.  The other Justices respond to the suggested disposition in writing. 

(2) Qualified Justices only.  Only those Justices who are qualified and available to hear a 

case will vote on the motion for rehearing en banc.  Except in capital cases, if only three Justices 

are qualified and available, other state Judges or former Justices are not called to complete the 

Court en banc in disposition  of the motion.  Therefore,  if only three  Justices are  available and 

qualified, the original panel is, in effect, the Court en banc for purposes of the motion.  If only one 

Justice is disqualified, only the four remaining qualified and available Justices will constitute the 

Court en banc and consider the Motion for Rehearing.  

 

Page 16 of 24 

(3)  Rehearing  denied.    If  the  motion  for  rehearing  is  denied,  a  written  disposition  is 

prepared by the Justice who was the named author and then circulated for approval.  If there is a 

dissent  from  the  denial  of  rehearing,  a  notation  will  be  added  to  the  dispositive  order,  at  the 

affirmative request of the dissenting Justice, that “Justice ____ would grant rehearing by the Court 

en banc.”  

(4) Rehearing granted.  If a majority of the active justices of the Court vote for rehearing 

en banc, the named author or ranking active Justice of the majority enters an order which grants 

rehearing, vacates the panel’s opinion and the judgment entered thereon, and assigns the case to 

the calendar for rehearing en banc on a priority basis. 

(5)  Supplemental  authorities.    Rehearing  en  banc  addresses  all  issues  presented  in  the 

original briefs.  The Chief Justice or the next senior available Justice if the Chief Justice is not 

sitting on the matter, upon the request by a majority of the en banc Court, may direct the Clerk to 

advise counsel to submit supplemental briefs on specific issues or to be prepared to discuss at oral 

argument any other relevant issues designated by the majority of Justices. 

XVIII.  Motion Practice. 

(1) Motion Justice.  

(a) Monthly rotation.  For each month of the year, the Chief Justice designates a “motion 

Justice.”  The motion Justice assignment is typically rotated among all five Justices in order of 

seniority.  All applications by motion, however, must be made to the Court. 

(b)  Circulation  by  Clerk.    The  Clerk  will  refer  the  matter  to  the  current  motion  Justice 

unless the motion Justice has entered  a disqualification  or the  Clerk  receives  other instructions 

from  the  Court,  e.g.,  the  motion  relates  to  a  matter  with  which  one  Justice  has  already  been 

substantially involved. 

 

Page 17 of 24 

(2) Motion panels.  A panel of three Justices is available to receive motions at all times.  

The  motion  panel  is  composed  of  the  current  motion  Justice  and  the  motion  Justices  from  the 

preceding  and  succeeding  months.    If  a  member  of  the  motion  panel  is  disqualified,  the  next 

qualified Justice in rotation is added to the panel.  The motion panels act in cases that have not 

already been assigned to a panel for disposition on the merits. 

(3) Routine motions.  During a given month, all newly filed routine motions are handled 

by, or under the supervision of, the motion Justice unless the motion Justice is disqualified in a 

particular case, or the case is being handled by another Justice. 

(4) Extraordinary writs.  The motion Justice also processes (to the extent judicial attention 

is required) those proceedings which may be filed in the first instance in the Supreme Court.  The 

motion Justice also determines whether briefing  or  a hearing  is  required.   See  Supr. Ct. R. 43.  

Usually the State is directed to file a response to these motions.  The Clerk’s office is directed to 

ascertain whether the judicial officer wishes to be heard or represented. 

(5) Procedure.  

(a) Written requirement.  All motions must be made in writing with the required notice 

provided to the opposing party.  Any other contact with the Court regarding motions is confined 

to the Clerk’s office or Chief Staff Attorney. 

(b)  No  conference.    Motions  are  routinely  handled  by  the  motion  Justice  without  a 

conference or hearing. 

(c) Special problems.  When emergencies or other special problems arise, however, it is 

not inappropriate for an attorney to seek to set up a conference so that the attorney and opposing 

counsel may meet with the motion Justice.  The request for such a conference should be made 

through the Clerk’s office.  

 

Page 18 of 24 

(6) Clerk of the Court.  The Clerk is authorized, on behalf of the Court, to approve several 

types of motions, including unopposed motions to proceed in forma pauperis in criminal matters.  

(7) Single Justice motions.  The motion Justice is authorized to approve the following types 

of motions: 

in capital cases; 

(a) automatic stay of execution required by statute or consistent with a prior en banc order 

(b) certificate of reasonable doubt; 

(c) changing the caption of an appeal, e.g., assigning pseudonyms; 

(d) consolidating appeals; 

(e) denying motion to affirm.  Denial of such a motion simply puts the case back into the 

routine  briefing  schedule.    Per  Supreme  Court  Rule  25(a)(iii),  the  appellee’s  brief  is  then  due 

within 20 days of the denial; 

(f) expedite appeal upon consultation of others for availability; 

(g) motion to proceed in forma pauperis; 

(h) motion to proceed pro se.  These motions are remanded for initial consideration by the 

trial court under Watson v. State, 564 A.2d 1107 (Del. 1989); 

(i) motion for stay or supersedeas in a civil case; 

(j) type-volume extensions of no more than 4,000 words for an opening or answering brief 

and  1,900  words  for  a  reply.    For  unrepresented  parties  without  access  to  a  word  processing 

program, page limit extensions of no more than 15 pages for an opening or answering brief and 7 

pages  for  a  reply.    Motions  for  type-volume  and  page  limit  extensions  are  disfavored  and  will 

usually not be granted by the Court en banc beyond these limits in total; 

(k) pro hac vice admission; 

 

Page 19 of 24 

(l) seal records; 

(m) substitution of parties; 

(n) extension of time;  

(o) unopposed rule to show cause; and 

(p) motion to withdraw other than with a Rule 26(c) brief. 

(8)  Three-Justice  motions.    A  single  Justice  may  act  on  any  motion  that  is  not  case-

dispositive, including the motions specified above.  But certain non-dispositive motions will also 

only be acted upon by a panel.  Whenever a matter requires the affirmative vote of three Justices, 

the motion Justice circulates a proposed disposition in writing.  Three-Justice matters include the 

following: 

(a) amicus curiae status—granting or denying; 

(b) certified questions—accepting or refusing; 

(c) extraordinary writs—granting or denying; 

(d) granting motions to affirm.  Motions to affirm under Rule 25 are made after the opening 

brief is filed.  Since such motions may result in a final ruling on the merits before full briefing is 

completed, they are screened by the motion Justice.  Acting alone, the motion Justice may deny 

the motion.  But motion to affirm the trial court under Rule 25 may be granted only if three Justices 

vote to grant it.  See Supr. Ct. R. 3(a); 

(e)  interlocutory  appeals.    If  the  trial  court  has  not  acted  upon  the  request  for  an 

interlocutory appeal, the Clerk is directed to notify the parties that no action will be taken until the 

trial court acts and a supplemental notice of appeal is filed.  Whether such a motion is granted or 

denied,  it  is  acted  upon  by  three  Justices.    Either  order  is  electronically  filed  and  provided  to 

counsel and the trial court through File and Serve Xpress. 

 

Page 20 of 24 

(f) motion to intervene—granting or denying. 

(g) motion for reargument—granting or denying (same panel); 

(h) stay of execution, other than automatic (only en banc); and 

(i)  motion  to  withdraw.    When  filed  with  a  Rule  26(c)  brief,  such  a  motion  is  held  in 

abeyance and is dismissed as moot if the State’s motion to affirm is granted. 

(9) Summary action.  

(a) Sua  sponte initiation. The  Court, sua sponte or  upon a motion by  a party, may take 

summary action affirming, enforcing, or reversing the judgment or order appealed from if it clearly 

appears  that  no  substantial  question  is  presented  or  that  subsequent  precedent  or  a  change  in 

circumstances warrants such action. 

(b) Parties’ positions.  Before taking summary action, the Court will afford the parties an 

opportunity to submit argument in support of or in opposition to such disposition if briefs on the 

merits have not already been filed. 

(c) Panel unanimity.  Summary action may be taken only by a unanimous vote of the panel.  

If a motion panel determines that summary action is not appropriate at that time, it may, in lieu of 

denial, refer the matter to the merits panel without decision and without prejudice. 

(10) Motions related to cases assigned to merits panels.  Motions related to cases assigned 

to merits panels are generally granted or denied by the presiding Justice of the panel if they are 

merely  administrative  and  unrelated  to  the  disposition  of  the  case,  unless  the  presiding  Justice 

believes a discussion by the entire panel is appropriate. 

(11) Post-decision motions.  

(a) A motion for extension of time for filing a petition for rehearing or for leave to file out 

of time is  referred to the named  author of the opinion or  order, who  has  authority to  grant the 

 

Page 21 of 24 

extension.  If the author votes to deny, the motion is referred to the entire panel for disposition. 

(b) A motion for stay of mandate or for the recall of the mandate, or certified judgment in 

lieu thereof, is processed by the presiding Justice. 

(c) A motion to amend the judgment of the Court is referred to the panel. 

XIX.  Recusal Or Disqualification Of Justices. 

(1) Procedure.  

(a) Generally.  Each Justice may submit to the Clerk in writing those circumstances which 

would generally require recusal, including the names of businesses in which the Justice or family 

members have a financial interest, the names of relatives whose names may appear as counsel in 

appeals, and the names of law firms on whose cases the Justice does not sit. 

(b) Before submission.  When cases are electronically filed, an alert is sent to each Justice’s 

File  and  Serve  Xpress  mailbox  informing  them  when  disclosure  statements  are  filed  in  a  case.  

After reviewing the disclosure statements, the Justice will promptly inform the Clerk if the Justice 

is disqualified from sitting in the case. 

(c) After submission.  A Justice who finds it necessary to recuse herself after distribution 

of the briefs or a motion immediately notifies the other members of the panel and the Chief Justice 

or the active Justice  next  in  seniority if the Chief Justice is recused.  The Chief  Justice, or the 

Justice next in seniority if the Chief Justice is recused or otherwise unavailable, names a substitute 

to reconstitute the panel.  A written order is not necessary for the reconstitution of any panel before 

submission for disposition. 

(d) Disclosure.  The reasons for disqualification are not disclosed to the parties. 

(2)  Rule  of  necessity.    The  rule  of  necessity  is  an  exception  to  the  principle  that  every 

litigant is entitled to be heard by a judge who is not subject to any disqualifications which might 

 

Page 22 of 24 

reasonably cause the judge’s impartiality to be questioned.  See Delaware Judges’ Code of Judicial 

Conduct R. 2.11.  The rule of necessity has been invoked where disqualifications exist as to all 

members of the state judiciary who would normally hear a matter.  Rather than deny a party access 

to court, judicial disqualification yields to the demands of necessity.  

XX.  Visiting Jurists. 

(1) Selection.  When it is necessary to provide a quorum because of the disqualification or 

unavailability of a Justice in en banc hearings or in panels normally consisting of three Justices, a 

retired Justice or active trial court judge is called upon to sit.  See Del. Const. art. IV, §§ 12 and 

38;  Supr.  Ct.  R.  2(a)  and  4(a).    The  Chief  Justice  or  next  senior  available  Justice  selects  and 

ascertains a jurist’s availability to sit. 

(2) Assignment.  A visiting jurist is not assigned to sit on an appeal from the visiting jurist’s 

own Court.   

XXI.  Law Clerks. 

Clerks. 

XXII.  Death Penalty Cases. 

(2) Stay of execution.  

Delaware Supreme  Court  law clerks  hold major,  non-tenured  advisory positions for the 

Justices of the Court.  All judicial law clerks are bound by the Delaware Code of Conduct for Law 

(1) Docketing.  An automatic appeal is docketed by the Clerk’s office after a death sentence 

is imposed.  If the defendant files a separate notice of appeal, the cases are consolidated. 

(a) Automatic.  In all automatic appeals, the motion Justice enters a stay of execution sua 

sponte, which remains in effect for the duration of this Court’s consideration. 

(b) Other requests.  Any other request to stay a death sentence is considered en banc. 

 

Page 23 of 24 

(3) Procedures.  The following standards govern proceedings in the Supreme Court unless 

otherwise directed by the Court: 

(a) Compliance with briefing schedules in the Supreme Court will be strictly enforced and 

only in extraordinary circumstances will this Court grant extensions totaling more than sixty days. 

(b)  Oral  arguments  shall  be  scheduled  within  forty-five  days  after  the  prosecution’s 

answering brief and appendix have been served and filed. 

(c) This Court will issue its decision within ninety days after the case has been submitted 

for decision.  The Court will determine motions for reargument within thirty days after their filing. 

(4) Hearings en banc.  All substantive matters relating to a capital case are considered en 

banc. 

(5) Notices to other courts.  The Clerk’s office receives from and distributes filings to the 

Superior Court,  District Court, Third  Circuit  Court of  Appeals, and the  United  States  Supreme 

Court when an execution is imminent.
