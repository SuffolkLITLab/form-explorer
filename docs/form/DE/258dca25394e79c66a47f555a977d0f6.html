      <pre>HOW TO FILE AND DEFEND A SUMMARY POSSESSION ACTION 
 IN THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE COURT OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE 

This information is not binding on the court if incorrect or misunderstood.  This information is not legal advice and is not a 
substitute for seeking legal advice from an attorney.  If you need help in obtaining an attorney, you may contact the Legal  Help 
Link  at  (302)  478-8850  or  at  https://delegalhelplink.org.

  A  copy  of 

this  booklet 

HAT DOES THIS BOOKLET EXPLAIN? 

This booklet explains the special procedures which apply in an action to  obtain possession of a 
rental unit, known as an action for summary possession.  A summary possession action should only be 
filed if possession alone is sought or if both possession and money (such as back rent) are sought.  If 
only money is sought from the other party in a landlord-tenant case (for example, the return of a security 
deposit),  a  debt  action  should  be  filed  and  different  procedures  will  apply.    Before  filing  an  action  for 
summary  possession,  it  is  important  that  you  decide  whether  you  want  to  ask  the  Court  to  give  you 
possession of the unit. 

HAT OTHER RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE? 

This booklet is intended to help only with Court procedures in summary possession actions. For 
further information on summary possession, and for information on the substantive rights and obligations 
of landlords and tenants, you should consult the Residential Landlord Tenant Code (contained in Part III 
of Title 25 of the Delaware Code). A summary may be obtained from the Consumer Protection Unit of the 
Attorney General’s Office or a copy of the Code may be  obtained by contacting  Legislative Council in 
Dover. The Code is contained at any public library in the State and on the internet at https://delaware.gov. 
Under “Government & Services” select “General Assembly”; select “Delaware Laws” from the ribbon at 
the top of the screen then select “Landlord Tenant Code”.  

If you are a landlord or tenant of a manufactured home or manufactured home lot, you should also 
consult the Manufactured Home Owners and Community Owners Act (contained in Chapter 70 of Title 
25 of the Delaware Code) for further information.  You may obtain this from the sources listed above for 
the Residential Landlord Tenant Code.  The substantive rights and obligations of commercial landlords and 
tenants are usually governed by general contract law.   

It is also important to consult your  rental agreement to determine any specific rights or duties 
which are included in it.  Tenants of federally subsidized housing have additional rights  and obligations 
beyond  those  created  by  State  law  and  should  check  their  rental  agreements  for  further  information.  
Another booklet, entitled How to File and Defend a Civil Claim in the Justice of the Peace Court, may 
be obtained at any Justice of the Peace Civil Court to help with general Court procedures, including the 
filing of a debt action (if you are seeking money only).  You may also wish to ask the Court for the booklet 
containing sample complaints (one of which is for a summary possession action.) In addition, you may visit 
a law library to review case law, Court Rules, and other statutes which may be relevant to your case.  Court 
booklets, forms, rules, and other materials may be downloaded from the Justice of the Peace Court website 
at https://courts.delaware.gov/jpcourt. 

 An option all parties should consider in any landlord-tenant dispute is mediation.  It is free, 
and  a  quick  way  for  the  parties  to  reach  a  mutually  acceptable  result  if  they  want  to  avoid  litigation. 
Mediation is informal and can be quickly scheduled and heard.  It often helps a situation where the parties 
hope  or  expect  to  continue  an  agreement  or  relationship.    Trained  mediators  are  available  in  all  three 
counties at no charge for all types of landlord-tenant disputes.  For more information on mediation contact: 
  
   New Castle County:  Delaware Center for Justice (302-658-7174)  
   Kent & Sussex Counties:  Center for Community Justice (302-424-0890) 

f you do decide to file a court action for possession of a rental unit, you should realize that 
summary possession cases may be complicated to present and parties are encouraged, though not required,

to have an attorney represent them.  (However, parties who are artificial entities, such as a corporation, 
must file a Form 50 if they choose not to be represented by an attorney.) 

HAT IS MEANT BY SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS? 

The  Residential  Landlord  Tenant  Code  and  the  Manufactured  Home  Owners  and 
Community Owners Act provide that landlords and tenants must do certain things and that if they do not, 
the other party has certain rights.  For example: 

A landlord has the obligation to supply hot water, heat, and electricity and a tenant may, if these 
are not supplied, after giving written notice to the landlord, seek to keep two-thirds of the daily rent 
for any period when these are not supplied. 

A tenant has the obligation to pay rent and a landlord has the right to charge a late fee if provided 
for in the rental agreement (not more than 5% of the monthly rent) when rent is not paid on time, 
to sue for back rent and/or to seek possession of the unit for unpaid rent. 

A tenant has the obligation not to damage the unit and the landlord has the obligation to return the 
security deposit or the difference between the security deposit and the amount set forth in a list of 
damages within 20 days of termination of the rental agreement.  If the landlord does not return the 
security deposit and/or a list of damages within 20 days of the termination, the tenant may seek the 
return  of  double  the  security  deposit,  but  only  if  the  tenant  has  provided  the  landlord  with  a 
forwarding address at or prior to the termination of the rental agreement. 

The substantive rights and obligations described above are examples of those provided by statute.  
Tenants  and  landlords  also  have  other  rights  and  obligations  which  do  not  relate  to  summary 
possession actions but which may be the basis of debt actions, or which, when specified in the statute, 
can be enforced directly without going to court.  You should consult the Residential Landlord Tenant 
Code and/or the Manufactured Home Owners and Community Owners Act for further information. 

HO MAY FILE AN ACTION FOR SUMMARY POSSESSION? 

An action for summary possession may be filed by either a tenant who has been wrongfully put or 
kept out of his or her rental unit; by the next tenant of the premises whose term has begun and the former 
tenant refuses to leave; by a landlord; or by an owner.  25 Del.C. § 5703.  The person or organization who 
files the action is known as the plaintiff and the person against whom the action is filed is the defendant.  

AY ACTIONS FOR SUMMARY POSSESSION BE BROUGHT FOR COMMERCIAL RENTAL 

AGREEMENTS? 

Summary possession procedures apply to commercial, as well as to residential, rental agreements. 
(However, the substantive rights and obligations of landlords and tenants will be determined by the rental 
agreement  and  general  contract  law  and  not  by  the  Residential  Landlord  Tenant  Code  Manufactured 
Home Owners and Community Owners Act.) In addition to those actions discussed elsewhere in this 
booklet, landlords of commercial properties may file a distress for rent.  (Distress for rent actions are not 
allowed for residential rental agreements.) This action permits a levy upon (i.e., a seizure, which may, or 
may not, include a physical removal) and sale of the tenant’s goods if back rent is owed and there is reason 
to believe that the tenant would dispose of the goods in the absence of the levy. 25 Del.C. Ch. 63.

HAT ABOUT MANUFACTURED HOMES OR MANUFACTURED HOME LOTS? 

A summary possession action may also be brought to recover possession of manufactured homes 
and manufactured home lots.  25 Del.C. § 7002(b). The residential Landlord Tenant Code also governs the 
renting of manufactured homes.  Chapter 70, Subchapter I governs issues pertaining to the rental of lots in 
manufactured home communities. 

RE  THERE  RENTAL  AGREEMENTS  FOR  WHICH  AN  ACTION  FOR  SUMMARY 

POSSESSION MAY NOT BE BROUGHT? 

Summary possession actions may not be brought for the following types of rental agreements: (1) 
nonrenewable rental agreements of 120 days or less in certain areas of Sussex County; (2) institutional, 
fraternal, or hotel-type lodgings; (3) rental agreements for ground upon which improvements were made or 
installed by the tenant and used as a dwelling where the tenant retains ownership or title thereto, or obtains 
title to the improvements; (4) rental of  ground  which  a  recreational  vehicle is  placed;  and  (5)  rental  of 
ground within the category of seasonal property. 25 Del.C. § 5102; 25 Del.C. § 7004. 

HAT ARE THE GROUNDS FOR SEEKING SUMMARY POSSESSION?  

Unless  otherwise  agreed  in  a  written  rental  agreement,  an  action  for  summary  possession  may 

generally be brought: 

) 

by a tenant because the tenant has been wrongfully removed from or kept out of the unit 
(for example, the landlord has changed the locks and kept the tenant out of the unit without a court 
order permitting this). 

by a new tenant because the old tenant is unlawfully continuing in possession of the unit. 
 
by a landlord because the tenant has: 

stayed  in  all  or  part  of  the  unit  after  the  expiration  of  the  rental  agreement  without 
permission of the landlord; 

wrongfully failed to pay the agreed rent; 

wrongfully deducted money from the agreed rent; 

breached a lawful obligation relating to the tenant’s use of the premises; 

stayed in the unit for more than 15 days after dismissal when the housing was supplied by 
the landlord as part of the compensation for labor or services; 

refused to give possession of a rental unit which has been damaged by fire or other casualty 
when the landlord needs to repair the unit; 

been  convicted  of  a  class  A  misdemeanor  or  any  felony  during  the  term  of  the  rental 
agreement which caused or threatened to cause irreparable harm to any person or property;  

) 

by an owner when the tenant has: 

stayed  in  the  unit  for  more  than  5  days  after  the  property  has  been  duly  sold  upon  the 
foreclosure of a mortgage.

or manufactured home lots may be brought for any of the grounds set forth in the Manufactured Home 
Owners and Community Owners Act.  25 Del.C. § 5702. 
SHOULD ANYTHING BE DONE BEFORE FILING FOR POSSESSION? 

Yes.    A  landlord  of  a  residential  unit,  or  of  a  manufactured  home  or  rental  of  lots  for 
manufactured  homes  should  notify  the  tenant  in  writing  that  the  rental  agreement  is  being 
terminated or, if for cause, will be terminated, if corrective action is not taken.  The amount of notice 
which the landlord must give the tenant depends upon the reason for terminating the rental agreement and 
type of rental.  A complaint should not be filed until the time allowed in the notice has passed and the tenant 
has either not paid the amount due, or stopped the violation, as appropriate. 
 

For failure to pay rent – A written demand for payment and notice that payment for rent owed must 
be made within the time mentioned in the notice must be given or sent to the tenant before bringing 
an action for summary possession for failure to pay rent.  The time specified to make the payment 
must  be  at  least  5  days  after  the  date  of  the  notice  for  residential  units.  25  Del.C.  §  5502(a) 
(residential  units);  (See  25  Del.C.  §  7010  A  for  rental  of  lots  for  manufactured  homes).    For 
example, if the notice is given Friday, August 1, the landlord must give the tenant until at least 
August  8  to  pay  the  rent  before  filing  an  action  for  summary  possession.  (Weekends  and  legal 
holidays are excluded when a time period is less than 7 days). The court action could then be filed 
August 9th or later. 

For violation of rules – Advance written notice specifying the rule allegedly violated and providing 
an opportunity for the tenant to correct rule violations must generally be given or sent to the tenant 
before bringing a summary possession action for violation of rules. 
 

(a)  Residential units.  The notice must specify the rule allegedly violated and advise the 
tenant that, if the violation continues after 7 days, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement 
and bring an action for summary possession.  The notice may also state that it is given pursuant to 
25 Del.C. § 5513 and that if the tenant commits a substantially similar violation within 1 year, the 
landlord  may  rely  upon  such  advance  notice  as  grounds  for  initiating  an  action  for  summary 
possession.  However, no advance notice is required if a breach by a tenant causes or threatens 
to cause irreparable harm to any person or property, or the tenant is convicted of a class A 
misdemeanor or felony during the term of the tenancy which caused or threatened to cause 
irreparable harm to any person or property.  25 Del.C. § 5513.   

(b)  Rental lots for manufactured homes.  The notice must specify the acts or omissions 
constituting the  violation, and  advise the tenant  that if  the  violation  continues 12  days  or  more 
following  receipt  of  the  notice,  the  landlord  may  terminate  the  rental  agreement.    25  Del.C.         
§7010 A.      

ermination at expiration of rental agreement –  Unless otherwise provided in the rental agreement, 
the tenant should be given or sent written notice of termination at least 60 days before the end of 
the rental term. If the rental agreement is for a manufactured home lot only (and does not include 
the  manufactured  home),  in  the  absence  of  tenant  misconduct,  the  landlord  may  only  refuse  to 
renew a rental agreement if there will be a change in the land use.  In that situation, the landlord 
must follow the special notification requirements contained in 25 Del.C. § 7010(b).  (Tenants of 
residential units must provide at least 60 days’ written notice of termination for residential units, 
manufactured homes, and manufactured home lots to avoid possible liability for additional rent, 
unless otherwise provided in the rental agreement.) 25 Del.C. § 5106 (c) (for residential units); 25 
Del.C. § 7007 (for manufactured homes and manufactured home lots). 

ermination of month to month rental agreements – The tenant must be given at least 60  days’ 
written notice with the 60-day period beginning the first day of the month following the day of

or federally subsidized units -  if there is any conflict in notice provisions between the Landlord- 
Tenant Code and any federal law, regulations, or guidelines covering subsidized units, the latter 
controls. 

 For commercial rentals - notice requirements are determined by the specific rental agreement. 
 

OW ARE THE TIME PERIODS MENTIONED COMPUTED? 

For all the time periods mentioned in this booklet, the day of the event from which the period of 
time runs is not included, unless specifically stated.  The last day of the period is included, unless it is a 
Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.  In that event, the time period will run until the end of the next day which 
is  not  a  Saturday,  Sunday,  or  legal  holiday.    When  the  period of time is less  than  7  days,  intermediate 
Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays are not included in calculating the period of time.  For example, a 
summary possession appeal must be filed within 5 days of the Court’s judgment.  If the judgment is entered 
on Friday granting possession to the plaintiff, the defendant has until the following Friday to file an appeal 
(5 days excluding the Saturday and Sunday).  If a party has the right or is required to take some act within 
a prescribed period after service by mail, 3 days are added to the prescribed period. 

OW DOES AN ACTION FOR POSSESSION BEGIN?  

(J.P.  Civ.  Form  No.  1)  which  you  can  obtain 

The action should be filed in the Justice of the Peace Court closest to the rental property.  “Filing” 
consists of filling out and returning to the Court the necessary papers. You will need to fill out a complaint 
the  Court  or  online  at 
form 
https://courts.delaware.gov/jpcourt/ .  If you are a corporation, partnership, or other “artificial entity” and 
do  not  wish  to  use  an  attorney  to  represent  you  in  court,  you  will  also  need  to  file  a  Certificate  of 
Representation (Form 50).  You may obtain the form 50 from the Court or online at the Justice of the Peace 
Court website listed above. (Both forms may be filled out online, but may not be filed with the Court online.  
The Complaint Form, along with the filing fee should be mailed or delivered directly to the Court which 
will hear your case.  A Form 50 is also required to be filed with the complaint form. The Form 50 should 
be mailed with a check or money order for the required fee to the Office of the Chief Magistrate  at the 
address listed on the form.) 

from 

The information which is required to be contained in/attached to the Complaint is described below.  
Once the Court receives your paperwork, it will serve the papers on the other party unless you wish to hire 
a special process server to serve the papers.  (The filing fee includes service by the Court.) 

Remember, that if the action is for money only, such as a claim for rent or return of a security 
deposit, a debt action, rather than a summary possession action, must be filed.  However, if seeking both 
money and possession, a summary possession action should be filed.

      F

The complaint form (J.P. Civ. Form No. 1) is used for all civil complaints in the Justice of the Peace 
Court and, therefore, does not specify what must be contained in a summary possession action.  However, 
the Landlord-Tenant Code (25 Del.C. § 5707) requires that certain specific information be included in a 
summary  possession  complaint.    Therefore,  in  all  complaints,  the  following  should  be  included  in  the 
section of the complaint entitled “Concise Statement of the Facts.” 
 

1.  The interests of the plaintiff and the defendant and their relationship to each other with regard 
to the rental unit (for example, landlord and tenant); 

2.  A statement of the facts upon which the action is based.  Example 1: “The tenant has failed to 
pay rent for the last two months, a written notice was sent to the tenant on September 15th, and the 
tenant has not paid any rent.”  Example 2: “The landlord changed the locks on September 15th and 
has unlawfully kept the tenant out of the rental unit since that date.  The rent per day is $15.75 and 
the tenant seeks three times the amount of the rent for the period the tenant has been kept out of the 
unit.” (See 25 Del.C. § 5313 for more information on tenants unlawfully kept out of a unit.)  
 

A copy of any written notice sent to the tenant must be attached to the complaint.  For 
example, if you are a landlord seeking possession of a residential unit, including a manufactured 
home or manufactured home lot, for failure to pay rent, you must attach a copy of the notice which 
you  gave  to  the  tenant  stating  that  unless  payment  is  made  within  the  time  specified  the  rental 
agreement will be terminated.  (See the discussion above in the section entitled “Should Anything 
Be Done Before Filing for Possession” for more information on the notice.) 

.  A statement of what the plaintiff seeks in the action (for example, possession of the unit or 

possession and back rent). 

n  addition,  you  should  be  sure  to  include  the  address  of  the  rental  unit  in  the  special  space 
provided on the complaint a few lines below the space for the defendant’s name and address. 
 

pecial Requirements for violations of rules or provisions of the rental agreement: 

A landlord claiming that the tenant has violated a rule or rental agreement provision relating to the 
tenant’s use of the rental unit must also include the following information in the complaint (25 Del.C. § 
5708):   
 

1.  The rule or provision of the rental agreement allegedly broken, the date the tenant was told of 
the rule, and the way in which the tenant was told about the rule (for example, handed to tenant, 
mailed).  A copy of the rule or provision as initially provided to the tenant must be attached.  

2.  Facts showing that the rule was broken and that the landlord gave the tenant the required notice.  
(See the notice requirements for breach of rules discussed earlier.) 

.  Facts showing a continued or recurring violation of the rule. 

4.  A statement of the purpose served by the rule. 

5.  If the rule did not exist when the tenant entered into the rental agreement, a statement that it 
does  not  work  a  substantial  modification  of  the  tenant’s  bargain,  or  if  it  does,  that  the  tenant 
consented knowingly, in writing, to the rule.

Unlike other actions in the Justice of the Peace Court, jury trials may be held in summary possession 
actions.  To have a jury trial, you must be sure to check the “trial by jury” box on the complaint.  
Parties are particularly encouraged (though not required) to have an attorney represent them when there is 
a jury trial. 

HAT HAPPENS AFTER I FILL OUT THE PAPERS? 

Your action for possession will be scheduled for trial and the defendant will be served with the 
complaint and summoned to appear at trial. You will receive a notice in the mail giving the date and time 
of the trial.  It may take several weeks before your trial will be held, depending on the number of cases filed 
in that court. 

OW ARE THE COMPLAINT AND SUMMONS SERVED? 

If possible, the complaint and summons will be served by the constable handing these papers to the 
defendant.  If not, the constable will leave the papers with a person of suitable age and discretion who 
resides or is employed in the rental unit.  If neither of these methods is  possible, and the defendant is a 
person, the papers are posted on a conspicuous part of the rental unit and sent by either certified or first 
class mail with certificate of mailing to the rental unit or any other address known to the plaintiff at which 
it is likely the defendant will receive the papers.  If the defendant is an artificial entity, such as a corporation 
or partnership, after posting, the papers must also be sent by certified or first class mail with certificate of 
mailing to the principal place of business of the defendant, if known, or to any other place known to the 
plaintiff at which it is likely the defendant will receive the papers.  25 Del. C. § 5706. 

  

O  I  HAVE  TO  WAIT  SEVERAL  WEEKS  FOR  A  TRIAL  IF  THE  OTHER  PARTY  IS 

DAMAGING MY PROPERTY? 

If a landlord or tenant has substantial evidence that the party from whom summary possession is 
being sought is causing substantial or irreparable harm to the other’s person or property, the injured party 
may apply to the Court for a forthwith summons so that the case will be heard at an earlier date.  25 Del.C. 
§ 5115. 

HAT DO I DO IF I AM THE DEFENDANT IN AN ACTION FOR SUMMARY POSSESSION? 

. 
A  defendant  does  not  have  to  file  any  written  answer  in  a  summary  possession  case,  but  a 
defendant must appear in court at the time and place specified in the summons or the defendant will 
lose by default.  (However, a defendant in a case in which only money is being sought, such as an action 
for back rent or for the return of a security deposit, i.e., a debt action, will receive an answer form (J.P. Civ. 
Form No. 7) and this answer must be filed within the time specified or the case will be lost by default.)  
2. 
To have a jury trial, a demand for a trial by jury must be made within 10 days of being served 
with the papers.  There is no special form for this.  The demand should be made by stating on a piece of 
paper, which includes the name of the case and its case number, that a jury trial is demanded.  The demand 
should be signed and dated and filed with the Court.  The defendant must make the demand for the jury 
trial within 10 days of being served with the notice of the suit.  Parties are particularly encouraged (though 
not required) to have an attorney represent them when there is a jury trial. 
3. 
The defendant may file a counterclaim.  A counterclaim is a claim by the defendant against the 
other  party.    For  example,  if  the  landlord  is  suing  for  possession  and  back  rent,  the  tenant  may  file  a 
counterclaim for the value of furniture ruined when the roof leaked if it was the landlord’s responsibility to

fix the roof and the landlord failed to do so.  Generally, counterclaims must be filed at least 5 business days 
before the trial. 
 
The Justice of the Peace Court cannot award more than $25,000 on any claim or counterclaim.  If 
more than $25,000 is sought, the counterclaim may be filed in the appropriate court within 60 days of the 
entry  of  judgment  in  the  summary  possession  action.    25  Del.C.  §  5711(b).    Alternatively,  if  the 
counterclaimant  is  willing  to  accept  an  award  limited  to  $25,000,  the  counterclaim  may  be  filed  in  the 
Justice of the Peace Court.

OW SHOULD I PREPARE FOR TRIAL? 

The booklet, How to File and Defend a Civil Claim in the Justice of the Peace Court of the State 
of Delaware, provides general information on preparing for trial and what you may expect at trial.  This 
information is also available on the internet at https://courts.state.de.us/jpcourt under the Civil (General) 
section. Also, remember, that summary possession cases may be complicated to present and the parties are 
encouraged to have an attorney represent them in court. 

A few points to remember which are specific to Summary Possession cases are: 

.  A copy of the rental agreement should be brought to court.  

2.  A landlord seeking possession should bring a copy of the notice of rental agreement termination which 
was given or sent to the tenant. 
3.  Any dates that may be important to your case (for example, the date you discussed the rental, the move 
in date, the date the first payment of rent was made, etc.) should be noted for easy reference in court. 
4.  Tenants and landlords should be sure to review the Residential Landlord-Tenant Code or Manufactured 
Home Owners and Community Owners Act, as appropriate, and the rental agreement to determine whether 
there is anything the other party is required to do that he or she hasn’t done.  If it can be proven that the 
landlord or tenant has failed to fulfill his or her duties, this failure can be part of the other party’s claim or 
defense.  
5.  Each party (tenant and landlord) should think, in advance, about what they want and how they will 
explain and prove that to the judge at trial.  Also, each party should think about what the other party might 
want and how they would respond at trial. 

AN I RECOVER THE COSTS OF MY SUIT FROM THE OTHER PARTY? 

When the Court enters judgment in the case, the Court will order the losing party to pay the court 
costs of the suit.  However, attorneys’ fees, by law, may not be awarded with regard to residential units in 
summary possession cases.

A  non-suit  judgment  is  a judgment against  a plaintiff  which is entered  when  the  plaintiff,  after 
proper notice, fails to appear at the date and time for trial.  A default judgment is a similar judgment against 
a defendant when the defendant fails to appear.  

In summary possession cases, a party may file a motion to vacate a non-suit or default judgment.  
In most cases, this motion must be filed within 10 days of the entry of the judgment.  25 Del.C. § 5712.  In 
seeking to vacate a non-suit or default judgment, a party should explain why he or she let the judgment go 
to a non-suit or default.  

OW DO I APPEAL A DECISION? 

A written request to appeal the decision must be made  within 5 days after the judgment of the 
Justice of the Peace Court in which your case was heard.  The appeal will be heard by a special panel of 3 
justices of the peace which will not include the justice of the peace who originally heard the case.  If the 
original trial was a non-jury trial, a new trial before the special panel will be held.  When a new trial is held, 
the appeal may also include claims and counterclaims which were not raised in the original proceeding.  
However, to have new claims or counterclaims considered, the claimant must file, within 5 days of 
filing the appeal, a bill of particulars identifying the new issues which the claimant intends to raise at 
the  hearing.

Court.  In addition to the appeal fee, a cash bond may be required to prevent eviction from taking place 
during the appeal. 
 
 
 
In a case in which the judge has ruled that failure of the tenant to pay the rent arose out of a 
good faith dispute, the tenant may usually stay all proceedings on the judgment by paying all rent due at 
the date of the judgment and the court costs.  Alternatively, the tenant may stay the proceedings by filing a 
statement and such security as the Court orders that all rent and costs will be paid within 10 days of the 
judgment.  If payment is not made within ten days, a writ of possession may be requested by plaintiff and 
issued by the Court.  25 Del.C. § 5716.  A good faith dispute means one in which there was an honest 
difference of opinion relating to the rights of the parties pursuant to the rental agreement or the Residential 
Landlord Tenant Code.  25 Del.C. § 5141. 
  

HAT  IF  I  CAN’T  AFFORD  THE  FEES  TO  FILE  A  CASE  OR  AN  APPEAL  OR  I  CAN’T 

AFFORD THE COSTS OF A BOND? 

An application (called an “in forma pauperis” application) may be made to the Court for these costs 
to be waived for persons the court determines are unable to pay.  The clerk can provide the necessary forms.  
25 Del.C. § 5718. 

OW DOES A WINNING PLAINTIFF ACTUALLY GAIN POSSESSION OF THE UNIT? 

If the party in possession of the unit does not vacate it on his or her own, the plaintiff may ask the 
Court to issue a writ of possession. There is an additional fee for issuing this writ. The writ of possession

is an order to the constable to remove all persons who have been found to be wrongfully in the unit. The 
Court will not issue the writ of possession until 10 days from the date of the judgment have passed. In 
addition, if the defendant has appealed and has posted a bond and/or any other assurances required by the 
Court, the Court will wait to order the eviction to determine whether or not the plaintiff is successful upon 
appeal. 25 Del.C. § 5715.  If the defendant has appealed but has not filed a bond or assurances, the Court 
may  issue  the  writ  of  possession  upon  the  plaintiff’s  request.    However,  if  the  tenant  is  evicted,  but  is 
ultimately successful on appeal, the plaintiff will be responsible for reasonable damages for the period while 
the  tenant  was  evicted  from  the  unit  (including  but  not  limited  to  the  costs  of  substitute  housing  and 
moving), plus court costs and fees.   
 

If an eviction is ordered, the person(s) to be removed will be given at least 24 hours’ notice that 

they must vacate the premises.  25 Del.C. § 5715 (b). 

HAT IF THE PERSON EVICTED LEAVES HIS OR HER PERSONAL PROPERTY IN THE 

If an evicted tenant leaves his or her personal property on the premises, the landlord may remove 
and store such property at the evicted person’s expense.  Such property shall be stored for 7 days by the 
landlord if no appeal of the summary possession action is taken and for 7 days after the decision on the 
appeal, if there is an appeal.  Following that time, if the person whose property has been stored has failed 
to claim it and to provide reimbursement for the expense of removal and storage, such property will be 
deemed to be abandoned.  25 Del.C. § 5715(e) and (f). 

F THE LANDLORD IS AWARDED POSSESSION OF A MANUFACTURED HOME AND THE 
MANUFACTURED HOME IS NOT LEASED FROM THE LANDLORD, MUST THE TENANT 
REMOVE THE MANUFACTURED HOME WITHIN 24 HOURS? 
 

The Court may extend the time for removal from 24 hours to 7 days if the tenant prepays a storage 
fee for the manufactured home to the landlord in an amount equivalent to 7 days’ rent.  However, the tenant 
may not inhabit the home after the first 24 hours of the notice period. 

HAT IF THE TENANT DOES NOT REMOVE THE MANUFACTURED HOME FROM THE 

LOT WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIME? 
 

If the tenant does not remove the manufactured home during the 7-day period (or during the original 
24-hour period if no storage fee is paid), the landlord may remove the unit.  The landlord must store the 
unit (at the tenant’s expense) for a period of 30 days before disposing of it through further legal action.  The 
tenant  may  remove  the  manufactured  home  from  the  storage  location  only  if  the  tenant  reimburses  the 
landlord for any judgment amount and the reasonable cost of removal and storage of the  manufactured 
home.  25 Del.C. § 5715.
