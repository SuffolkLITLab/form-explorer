Construction.  --  This  section  is   modeled 
closely upon  21 U.S.C. 881; therefore, it  is 
appropriate   to   apply   the   civil   forfeiture 
in   the    federal 
standards   as   set   forth  
decisions construing  21 U.S.C. 881.  In  re 
One 1987 Toyota, Del. Super. Ct., 621 A.2d 
796 (1992). 
This  section  is  modeled  closely  upon  the 
parallel federal statute,  21U.S.C. §§ 881(a); 
since  Delaware  has 
law 
interpreting   this  section,  Delaware   courts 
have previously looked to the federal  courts 
for  guidance.  In  re  One  1985    Mercedes

control. Certificate of title to a motor  vehicle 
is  generally  presumptive   evidence   of 
ownership; however,the  possession of bare 
title   to   the   res   may   be   insufficient    to 
establish  ownership.  In  re   One   1985 
Mercedes Benz Auto., Del. Super.  Ct., 644 
A.2d 423 (1992). 
Although the  vehicle and the motor   vehicle 
registration  card  were  in  claimant's  name, 
there  was  sufficient  evidence  adduced   at 
trial  that  the  defendant  aCtually controlled 
the  vehicle; this  rebutted  the  presumption 
invoked by claimant of  ownership  based on 
the  certificate  of  title  and other  documents 
bearing claimant's name  for  the  purpose  of 
avoiding forfeiture  as an innocent  owner. In 
re  One  1985  Mercedes  Benz  Auto.,  Del. 
Super. Ct., 644 A.2d 423 (1992). 

eturn   of    property.    --    Evidence    held 

 R

Double  jeopardy  not  implicated.  --  The 
imposition of in rem civil forfeiture  pursuant 
to this section, either prior  to or subsequent 
to  a criminal proceeding involving  the same 
party  and  the  same  subject  matter,  does 
not  offend  the  double  jeopardy  provisions 
of  either  the  state  or  federal  constitutions. 
In  re  1982  Honda, Del.  Supr.,  681  A.2d 
1035 (1996). 

"Probable  cause."  --  Generally,  probable 
cause in  a forfeiture  action  is  a reasonable 
ground  for  belief of  guilt  supported by  less 
than prima facie proof, but  more  than mere 
suspicion; therefore,  the  State  must  prove 
that  a  reasonable  ground  exists  for  the 
belief   that   the   property    was   used   to 
facilitate the sale, transportation  or  delivery 
of  an  illegal  substance.  In  re  One  1985 
Mercedes Benz Auto., Del. Super. Ct., 644 
A.2d 423 (1992). 

Requirement of  probable  cause implicit.  -  
While  subsection (a)  does  not  specifically 
indicate the req·uirement  of probable cause, 
such requirement is clearly implicit  from the 
General  Assembly's  virtually 
  verbatim 
adoption of 21 U.S.C. 881. In re  One 1987 
Toyota,Del. Super. Ct., 621A.2d 796 (1992). 

The  test  for  forfeiture  of  an  automobile  is 
whether there was a reasonable ground  for 
belief  that  the use of  the  automobile  made 
the  sale  less  difficult  and  allowed  it  to 
remain  more  or  less free  from  obstruction 
or  hindrance.  In  re  One 1987  Toyota, Del. 
Super. Ct., 621 A.2d 796 (1992). 
Forfeiture  is not  limited  to  those  situations 
where drugs are found  in  the  vehicle itself; 
rather, it  is sufficient  if  the  vehicle is  used 
purchase,  sale  or 
to 
transportation  of  a  controlled  substance or 
if  it is  intended  to  be  so  used. In re  One 
1985 Mercedes Benz Auto., Del. Super. Ct., 
644 A.2d 423 (1992). 
Where the vehicle confiscated was used by 
the defendant to get  to the  meeting place, 

facilitate 

the 

  

 

 

 

insufficient  to  support  a  petition  for  the 
return  of  property.    In  re  $5,662  United 
States Currency, Del. Super. Ct., 714 A.2d 
106 (1998). 

 

 

 

Innocent co-owner defense.--  The innocent 
owner   defense  provided   by   this  section 
applies equally to an innocent  co-owner  of 
property  to  the  extent  of  the  co-owner's 
interest    in    the   property.   Where    an 
ownership  interest  is  partial,  in  devising a 
forfeited 
method     of     distributing   
property, the trial court can either allow the 
State- to  retain  the  vehicle  but  order  the 
fair 
 the  
State  
consideration, or  order  the  State to return 
the vehicle and require the co-owner to pay 
the fair value of the forfeited  interest. In  re 
One 1986 Pontiac Firebird, Del. Supr., 687 
A.2d 190 (1997).

Proof  of  knowledge  of  illegal  activity  can 
appropriate

imply 
circumstances; thus, where  petitioner  failed 
to  take  any  reasonable  steps,  given  her 
knowledge of her son's drug-related history, 
illegal  use  of  vehicle, 
to  prevent  his 
petitioner  did  not  establish 
innocent 
ownership  of  the  vehicle. In re  One 1984 
Chevrolet Blazer, Del. Super. Ct., --  A.2d -  
(July 24, 2000). 

Forfeiture held proper.  --A  convict's motion 
for  the return  of$ 1,800.00  seized during  a 
drug  investigation  was  denied,  given  that: 
all  moneys  found  in  close  proximity  to 
forfeitable 
  controlled  substances  were 
presumed to  be  forfeitable;  the money was 
found 
to  drugs  and 
paraphernalia;  and  the  convict's  claim that 
he  won the money  while  gambling  failed to 
rebut  the  presumption  for  forfeitability.  In 
re  $1,800.00  in  U.S. Currency,  Del. Super. 
Ct., --  A.2d --  (Mar. 13, 2002).
