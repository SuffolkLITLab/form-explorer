GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION OF PARENTAL RIGHTS 

omplete a separate Grounds for Termination of Parental Rights form for each child named 
in the Petition for Termination of Parental Rights.  If there are 2 children, then 2 Grounds for 
Termination of Parental Rights forms MUST be completed and attached to the Petition. 

HILD’S NAME: 

           

ndicate the grounds for Termination of Parental Rights (Place an “X” next to the grounds that apply). At 
least one of the boxes numbered 1 through 9 must be checked. 

CONSENT: 

1. 

  A  parent  of  the  child,  or  a  person  or  organization  holding  parental  rights  over  the  child,  agrees 
(consents) that this Petition should be granted.   

 A Consent to Termination and Transfer of Parental Rights (Form 140) is attached to the Petition.  

NTENTIONAL ABANDONMENT: 

2. 

  Respondent(s) have intentionally abandoned the child as evidenced by the fact that (If you check 
box 2, you must place an “X” next to at least one of the following that apply): 

a. 

b. 

c. 

  The child  is  younger than  6 months  old  at  the time  of filing  this  Petition  and  Respondent(s) 
FAILED to: 
  Pay reasonable prenatal, natal, and postnatal expenses for the child; AND  
  Visit regularly with the child or file a petition for visitation with the child; AND 
  Manifest  (show)  an  ability  and  willingness  to  assume  legal  and  physical  custody  of  the 

child (if the child was NOT in the physical custody of the other parent). 

  The  child  is  at  least  6  months  old  at  the  time  of  filing  this  Petition  AND  for  at  least  6 
consecutive months (6 months in a row) of the 12 months preceding the filing of this Petition, 
Respondent(s) FAILED to: 
  Communicate or visit regularly with the child; AND 
  Manifest  (show)  the  ability  and  willingness  to  assume  legal  and  physical  custody  of  the 

child (if the child was NOT in the physical custody of the other parent). 
 

  The  child  is  younger  than  6  years  old  at  the  time  of  filing  this  Petition  AND  Respondent(s) 
have placed the child in circumstances leaving the child in substantial risk of injury or death 
and,  therefore,  has  manifested  (shown)  the  unwillingness  to  exercise  parental  rights  and 
responsibilities. 

NINTENTIONAL ABANDONMENT: 

  Respondent(s)  have  unintentionally  abandoned  the  child  because  for  12  consecutive  months  (12 
months in a row) in the 18 months before filing this Petition, Respondent(s) FAILED to: 

  Communicate or visit regularly with the child; AND 
  File or pursue a pending Petition to establish paternity or to establish a right to have contact 

or visitation with the child; AND 

  Manifest (show) an ability and willingness to assume legal and physical custody of the child 

(if the child was NOT in the physical custody of the other parent).

AND  at  least  one  of  the  below  applies  (Place  an  “X”  next  to  at  least  one  of  the  following  that 
apply): 

 
  The child is not in the other parents’ legal and physical custody and Respondent(s) are not 
able  or  willing  promptly  to  assume  legal  and  physical  custody  of  the  child,  and  to  pay  for 
reasonable support for the child. 

  The child is in the legal and physical custody of the other parent and a stepparent, and the 
stepparent  is  the  prospective  adoptive  parent,  and  Respondent(s)  are  not  able  or  willing 
promptly to establish and maintain contact with the child and to pay reasonable support for 
the child in accordance with the Respondent(s)’ financial means. 

  Placing  the  child  in  Respondent(s)’  legal  and  physical  custody  would  pose  a  risk  of 
substantial harm to the child’s physical or psychological well-being.  Respondent(s) are unfit 
to maintain  a  relationship  of  “parent  and  child” with  the  child  because  of  at  least  one  (1)  of 
the following reasons: 

i.  The circumstances of the child’s conception; OR 
ii.  Respondent(s)’ behavior during pregnancy; OR 
iii.  Respondent(s)’ behavior after the child was born; OR 
iv.  Respondent(s)’ behavior with respect to another child. 

  Failure  to  grant  the  Petition  for  Termination  of  Parental  Rights  would  be  detrimental  to  the 
child. 

In determining whether failure to grant the termination of parental right would be detrimental to the child, the Court will 
consider all relevant factors, including the following: 

DETRIMENTAL TO THE CHILD 

A.   The respondent’s efforts to obtain or maintain legal and physical custody of the child. 
B.   The role of another person in thwarting the respondent’s efforts to assert parental rights. 
C.   The respondent’s ability to care for the child. 
D.   The child’s age. 
E.   The quality of a previous relationship between the respondent and child, and between the respondent and 

another child. 

F.   The duration and suitability of the child’s current custodial environment. 
G.   The effect on the child of a change of physical custody. 

ONVICTION OR ADJUDICATION: 

  Respondent(s) have been convicted or adjudicated of the following (or a substantially similar offense 
in  another  jurisdiction) (If  you  check  box  4,  you  must  place  an  “X”  next  to  at  least  one  of  the 
following that apply): 

  A felony level offense against the person under Subchapter II of Chapter 5 of Title 11, in which 
the victim was a child; OR 
  Aided,  abetted,  attempted,  conspired,  or  solicited  to  commit  a  felony  level  offense  against  the 
person under Subchapter II of Chapter 5 of Title 11, in which the victim was a child; OR 
  Dealing in Children or attempting to deal in children under § 1100A of Title 11; OR 
  Felony level endangering the welfare of a child under § 1102 of Title 11; OR 
  Murder or manslaughter of the other parent of the child who is the subject of the petition; OR 
  Aiding,  abetting,  attempting,  conspiring,  or  soliciting  to  commit  murder  or  manslaughter  of  the 
other parent of the child who is the subject of this petition.

  DSCYF  OR  LICENSED  AGENCY:  the  child  is  in  DSCYF  custody  or  placed  by  a  licensed  agency 
and the Respondent(s) are not able or have failed to plan adequately for the child’s physical needs 
or mental and emotional health and development; AND at least ONE (1) of the following conditions 
are met (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY): 

 

The child has been in DSCYF custody or placed by a licensed agency for at least 1 year. 
  The child has been in DSCYF custody or placed by a licensed agency for at least 6 months 
and the child came into care as an infant. 
  DSCYF previously had custody of the child or another child of the Respondent(s). 
  The Respondent(s) have a history of dependency, neglect, abuse, or lack of care of the child 
or another child. 
  The Respondent(s) are incapable of discharging parental responsibilities due to extended or 
repeated incarceration (the Court may consider the Respondent(s)’ postconviction conduct). 

  PRIVATE: at the time of the Termination of Parental Rights Hearing, the child will be a dependent 
child or neglected child in the Respondent(s)’ care and ALL of the following are true: 
 The Petitioner is the child’s parent, guardian, permanent guardian, or relative. 
 The child has resided in the Petitioner’s home for at least 1 year. 
  The  Respondent(s)  failed  to  discharge  parental  responsibilities  for  at  least  12  of  the  18 
months preceding the filing of the petition. 
 The Respondent(s) are unlikely to be able to remedy the dependency or neglect in the near 
future. *NOTE*:  in making this determination, the Court shall consider the Respondent(s)’ efforts to 
remedy the dependency or neglect. 

ou  must  also  include  a  detailed  statement  of  why  the  child  would  be  a  dependent  child  or 

neglected child in the Respondent(s)’ care:

➢  Manifest  (show)  an  ability  and  willingness  to  assume  legal  and  physical  custody  of  the 

child (if the child was NOT in the physical custody of the other parent). 

  The  child  is  at  least  6  months  old  at  the  time  of  filing  this  Petition  AND  for  at  least  6 
consecutive months (6 months in a row) of the 12 months preceding the filing of this Petition,

Read carefully and answer and check all boxes that apply 
 

AND  at  least  one  of  the  below  applies  (Place  an  “X”  next  to  at  least  one  of  the  following  that 
apply): 

 
  The child is not in the other parents’ legal and physical custody and Respondent(s) are not 
able  or  willing  promptly  to  assume  legal  and  physical  custody  of  the  child,  and  to  pay  for 
reasonable support for the child. 

  The child is in the legal and physical custody of the other parent and a stepparent, and the 
stepparent  is  the  prospective  adoptive  parent,  and  Respondent(s)  are  not  able  or  willing 
promptly to establish and maintain contact with the child and to pay reasonable support for 
the child in accordance with the Respondent(s)’ financial means. 

  Placing  the  child  in  Respondent(s)’  legal  and  physical  custody  would  pose  a  risk  of 
substantial harm to the child’s physical or psychological well-being.  Respondent(s) are unfit 
to maintain a  relationship  of  “parent  and  child” with  the  child because  of  at  least  one  (1)  of 
the following reasons: 

i.  The circumstances of the child’s conception; OR 
ii.  Respondent(s)’ behavior during pregnancy; OR 
iii.  Respondent(s)’ behavior after the child was born; OR 
iv.  Respondent(s)’ behavior with respect to another child. 

  Failure  to  grant  the  Petition  for  Termination  of  Parental  Rights  would  be  detrimental  to  the 
child. 

In determining whether failure to grant the termination of parental right would be detrimental to the child, the Court will 
consider all relevant factors, including the following: 

DETRIMENTAL TO THE CHILD 

A.   The respondent’s efforts to obtain or maintain legal and physical custody of the child. 
B.   The role of another person in thwarting the respondent’s efforts to assert parental rights. 
C.   The respondent’s ability to care for the child. 
D.   The child’s age. 
E.   The quality of a previous relationship between the respondent and child, and between the respondent and 

another child. 

F.   The duration and suitability of the child’s current custodial environment. 
G.   The effect on the child of a change of physical custody. 

ONVICTION OR ADJUDICATION: 

  Respondent(s) have been convicted or adjudicated of the following (or a substantially similar offense

obtained by fraud or duress; or 

(b) By a preponderance of the evidence, that a condition permitting revocation, as expressly provided
