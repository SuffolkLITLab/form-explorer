POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR 
APPOINTMENT AND PAYMENT OF COUNSEL 
IN FAMILY COURT CIVIL CASES 

APPOINTMENTS (OTHER THAN ATTORNEYS UNDER CONTRACT) 

Each judge appointing private counsel to represent an indigent litigant in a civil 
case (other than attorneys under contract) must promptly send a copy of the 
appointing order to the Family Court shared mailbox 
FC.Appointed.Attorneys@delaware.gov.   Each order of appointment must show 
the name of counsel, the name of the party being represented, a description of the 
nature of the representation and the reason the appointment is necessary, e.g. 
unavailability of all contract attorneys.   The order must also clearly indicate that it 
is a civil case. 

COUNSEL FEES AND EXPENSES (OTHER THAN ATTORNEYS UNDER 
CONTRACT) 

The following procedures will apply to requests for payment for counsel fees and 
expenses for all appointed counsel (other than attorneys under contract) in civil 
cases in Family Court: 

1.      All attorneys appointed in such civil cases should be made aware of the rate 
at which they will be compensated for fees (not to exceed $70 per hour) and at the 
time of their appointment should sign an agreement stating that they understand the 
rate and that only extraordinary expenses will be reimbursed.   Routine, expected 
out-of-pocket administrative expenses will not be reimbursed.  Form 537B – 
Appointment to Represent Civil Case should be used for purposes of appointment.  
Form 537B contains information for attorneys on proper billing procedures. 

2.      Each judge who receives an application for the payment of counsel fees or 
for the reimbursement of extraordinary expenses in an amount equal to or less than 
$2,000 may approve the request as long as the total request for payment of counsel 
fees and expenses in an individual case does not exceed $2,000 per case1 per 
attorney.  Once the $2,000 threshold has been reached in a case for a specific 
attorney appointment, all requests for payment of counsel fees and expenses in 

                                                 
1 Case is defined as a petition and appointment of a specific attorney.  Each attorney appointed to the petition would 
have his or her own threshold. 

excess of $2,000 per case require the prior written approval of the Chief Judge of 
the Family Court.  This applies to both counsel fees and any request for 
reimbursement of extraordinary out-of-pocket expenses.    

3. 
The State Court Administrator has the authority to increase the threshold 
limit, with advance notice to the Family Court judges, in reasonable increments, 
based upon inflationary increases.  

4.      Each judge must forward an order authorizing payment, in conformity with 
Form 647 – Order Authorizing Payment attached hereto, together with the billing 
and documentation to the Family Court shared mailbox 
FC_AttorneySubmission@delaware.gov.  Orders authorizing payment for counsel 
fees or reimbursement of extraordinary expenses in excess of the $2,000 threshold 
per case per attorney will not be processed without the written approval of the 
Chief Judge of the Family Court.    

Applications for counsel fees and expenses may be submitted before 
5. 
completion of the representation.  If applications for counsel fees are submitted 
before completion of the representation, each Family Court judge should track the 
amounts submitted for payment to ensure that the necessary approvals are sought 
when the cumulative total counsel fees and expenses for an individual case exceed 
$2,000.   Fiscal Services in Family Court will track the total payments in each case 
to confirm that the necessary approval from the Chief Judge of the Family Court is 
obtained prior to giving final approval and processing payments beyond $2,000 per 
case.   

6.      Each approval for payment submitted must include a statement that the 
appointing judge concurs in the reasonableness of the time spent (at a rate not to 
exceed $70 per hour) and the extraordinary expenses incurred.  Only extraordinary 
out-of-pocket/administrative expenses of private attorneys are eligible for 
reimbursement.

ANCILLARY SERVICES (ALL APPOINTED ATTORNEYS, INCLUDING 
CONTRACT ATTORNEYS) 

All requests from appointed counsel and contract attorneys for permission to obtain 
transcripts or medical, forensic, investigatory services, or other ancillary services 
in all civil cases in the Family Court should be reviewed and given careful 
consideration by the judge assigned to the case.  Each judge to whom the request 
is made should review the request critically and only the most crucial services at a 
reasonable rate should be approved.  If a less costly alternative to providing the 
necessary services is available, that option should be used.  In cases where 
payment for ancillary services does, or is expected to, exceed $2,000 total per case, 
counsel must provide an explanation detailing the critical need for those services, 
what other alternatives have been explored, and why no other less expensive option 
is feasible. 

The following procedures will apply to requests for payment for ancillary services 
for all civil cases (involving appointed and contract attorneys) in Family Court: 

1.      Counsel must obtain approval before expenses are incurred.  Expenses 
incurred without a judge’s pre-approval will not be reimbursed. 

2.      Each judge who pre-approves a request from appointed counsel for 
permission to obtain transcripts, or medical, forensic or investigatory services at 
State expense, shall promptly send a copy of the order to the Family Court shared 
mailbox FC_AttorneySubmission@delaware.gov.   Each such order must show the 
name of requesting counsel, the name of the party being represented, a description 
of the nature of the representation, the name and address of the service provider, a 
maximum amount allowed for the service, and an explanation for the appointment 
consistent with the above.   

3.      Each judge who receives an application for payment for transcripts, or 
medical, forensic, or investigatory expenses in an amount within the $2,000 cap 
per case for indigent services may approve the request and forward an order 
authorizing payment in conformity with one of the following: 

Form 647 – Order Authorizing Payment to Attorney, attached hereto, must be 
utilized if costs for ancillary services are to be reimbursed to the attorney/law firm.  
A copy of the paid invoice must be included with the completed form. 

Form 645 – Order Authorizing Payment to Ancillary Service Provider, attached 
hereto, must be utilized if payment is to be made directly to the Service Provider.  

 

3 

A copy of the provider’s invoice to be paid must be included with the completed 
form. 

The appropriate form together with the billing and documentation shall be 
promptly sent to the Family Court shared inbox 
FC_AttorneySubmission@delaware.gov.  In order for payment to be made for 
transcripts, we must have the actual invoice and not an estimate of the cost. 

4.      Each judge who receives an application for payment for transcripts, or 
medical, forensic or investigatory services in excess of the $2,000 cap per case for 
indigent services must obtain the written approval of the Chief Judge of the Family 
Court before issuing an “Order Authorizing Payment” form. 

5.      All approvals for payment submitted, regardless of amount, must include a 
statement that the judge approving payment concurs in the reasonableness of the 
expenses incurred and that the services are consistent with the original authorizing 
order.
