      <pre>Questions and Answers about the Rules of Evidence 
in the Justice of the Peace Court 

This information is not a complete description of the Rules of Evidence. For complete information,  the 
Delaware  Rules  of  Evidence  (D.R.E.)  should  be  consulted.  These  can  be  found  in  the  Delaware  Rules 
volume of the Delaware Code. The following information is not legal advice and is not a substitute for 
seeking legal advice from an attorney. It is not binding on the Court if incorrect or misunderstood.) 

What is evidence?  

vidence is any form of proof presented to the Court to show the existence or nonexistence of a fact. It 
may include testimony (what a person says under oath during a trial), documents, photographs, recordings, 
or other things. 

hat are the Rules of Evidence?  

The Delaware Rules of Evidence determine whether various types of evidence are admissible (may be 
used), or are not admissible, in a Delaware court. Although the Justice of the Peace Court is less formal 
than the higher courts, the Rules of Evidence must be followed in the Justice of the Peace Court. The judge 
can consider only admissible evidence in making their decision about a case. 

ow does a party object to evidence?  

The  way  for  a  party  to  object  is  to  say,  "Objection."  When  a  party  objects,  the  judge  will  rule  on  the 
objection. Where the judge overrules the objection, the evidence will be admitted. Where the judge sustains 
the  objection,  the  evidence  will  be  excluded.  Frequently,  the  judge  will  listen  to  the  disputed  evidence 
before determining whether to receive or exclude it. 

hat makes evidence admissible?  

 basic requirement of admissibility is that the evidence must be relevant. (D.R.E. 402) This means that 
it must be helpful in deciding the action before the court. (D.R.E. 401) For example, in a case in which a 
roofer is suing a homeowner for failing to pay his bill, the bill sent to the homeowner would be relevant, 
but testimony that the homeowner had been convicted of shoplifting would not be relevant. 

However, even relevant evidence may not be admissible if it is repetitive (said more than once), confusing, 
or will unfairly influence the judge's decision as compared to what it adds to the case, or for certain other 
reasons. 

hat other reasons make relevant evidence inadmissible (not usable in court)?  

While there are a number of reasons why relevant evidence may be inadmissible, two of the most common 
reasons for not admitting evidence are that it is hearsay or has not been properly authenticated. 

hat is hearsay?  

Hearsay is a statement, other than one made by a person while testifying at trial, that is used to prove the 
truth of the statement. (D.R.E. 801) It is generally not admissible because there is no opportunity to cross-

examine the statement maker at trial (the person who made the statement is not at the trial). Examples of 
hearsay include: 

* Peter Plaintiff's offer of a letter (even if notarized) from his boss stating that Peter was working on Monday 
when used to show that Peter was working on Monday; 

* Donna Defendant's offer of a newspaper article about traffic light problems at an intersection when used 
to show problems with the traffic lights. 

* Larry Landlord's offer of a written statement by his wife about phone calls with Terry Tenant (and the 
wife is not in court to testify). 

* Pauline Plaintiff's testimony that Jim's auto repair told her it would cost $500 to repair the bad work of 
Defendant Auto Fix It. Pauline has no estimate (documentation) to show the court, just Jim's statement. 

What is not hearsay?  
A statement is not hearsay when it is used to show something other than the truth of what the statement 
says. Examples of statements which are not hearsay are: 

* Statements used to show why a person who heard the statement did or did not do something. For example, 
Don Defendant is charged with driving without a license. Don testifies that he drove his son Sam to the 
hospital because Sam complained of severe chest pains. Don's statements are not hearsay because they are 
used to explain why Don drove his car and not that he drove the car. 

*  Statements  by  a  party  or  party's  employees  (regarding  their  work)  offered  against  the  party  by  the 
opposing party. (D.R.E. 801(2)). For example, in plaintiff's suit against defendant Garage for improperly 
fixing her brakes, plaintiff may offer the statements of the Garage's owner and mechanics. Ordinarily, a 
plaintiff may offer anything a defendant says; a defendant may offer anything a plaintiff says. 

* A witness's previous statements which are inconsistent with the witness's testimony may be offered to 
show that the witness was lying. (D.R.E. 801(1)). For example, a witness's statement at the time of the 
accident that "the light was green" may be used to challenge the witness's testimony that "the light was red." 

re there any situations in which hearsay evidence is admissible?  

es. A hearsay statement is admissible if made under certain kinds of circumstances which make it more 
reliable (likely to be true). The following are examples of evidence which may be admitted without regard 
to whether the speaker or writer is in court to testify: 

* Bills, estimates - in Justice of the Peace Court civil cases only, a bill, estimate, receipt or statement of 
account which appears to have been made in the regular course of business may be admitted if the justice 
of the peace is satisfied that it is reliable. (D.R.E. 803(25)) 

* Certain other types of records - including, but not limited to: public records (these include records kept 
by courts, such as judgments and marriage/divorce records as well as records kept by other government 
agencies, such as birth and death records and tax records), records of religious organizations, judgments of 
previous convictions. (D.R.E. 803(6)-(16), (22)-(23)) 

* A statement relating to an event or condition made while the speaker saw, heard or experienced the 
event  or  condition  or  immediately  thereafter  or  while  still  affected  by  it.  (D.R.E.  803  (1)  and  (2)).  For 
example, Peter Plaintiff's daughter phones him to tell him that Donald Defendant is cutting down the tree 
in  Peter  Plaintiff's  yard  as  she  is  watching.  Peter  Plaintiff's  testimony  as  to  what  his  daughter  said  is 
admissible.

hat is authentication?  

Evidence, including photographs and documents must be properly authenticated before it can be admitted 
for the judge to consider. Authentication is proof that the evidence is what the person introducing it claims 
it to be. (D.R.E. 901). Most often, evidence will be authenticated by testimony of a witness that what they 
want admitted comes from their own memory - what they saw, heard, touched, smelled or tasted. They must 
recognize the thing they wanted admitted, or have marked it in some way, or kept it separate and secure to 
ensure that it was not changed. Examples of methods of authentication include: 

  Handwritten document (such as a letter) - a person familiar with the handwriting of the person who 

wrote  the  document  can  testify  that  this  is  the  person's  handwriting  or  the  person  who  wrote  the 

document can testify about when and where they wrote it. Also, a handwriting expert can compare 

the document with another writing by the person and state that they were written by the same person. 

  Photographs - testimony that the photograph fairly and accurately shows what the party introducing 

it claims that it shows. For example, if a photograph of a damaged car is shown, the owner may testify 

that it is a picture of his car as it appeared immediately after the accident and when and where and 

by whom the picture was taken. (Testimony by the photographer is not required.) 

re there any types of evidence which do not have to be authenticated?  

Yes. Examples of evidence which do not need to be authenticated are: public documents under seal (from 
a government agency or a court), or certified copies of public records, newspapers and periodicals, and 
inscriptions. (D.R.E. 902) 

hen must a document be shown to the Court?  

ocuments include writings, recordings and photographs. Generally, a witness is not permitted to testify to 

what a document says, shows, or means without showing it to the Court. However: 

1) Testimony is permitted where a document has been lost, has been destroyed by or is in the possession of 
the opposing party, or is not about an important issue in the case (D.R.E. 1004). 

2)  Testimony  about  the  same  information  contained  in  a  document  may  be  given  without  showing  the 
document if the witness is testifying from his or her memory of the event. For example, a witness may 
generally not testify as to what a receipt said without showing the receipt. However, a witness need not 
show the receipt if he is testifying from his memory that the item he purchased cost $125.00. 

an copies of documents, recordings, or photographs be used?  

es - most of the time. A duplicate, copy, computer printout, or enlargement is admissible in place of the 
original unless (1) there is a question as to whether it is an exact copy of the original, or (2) it would be 
unfair to admit it. (D.R.E. 1003)

ow are witnesses questioned?  

itnesses are questioned first by the party who called them. This is called direct examination. During the 
direct examination, leading questions generally may not be used. (D.R.E. 611) (A leading question is one 
which suggests to the witness the answer desired and the answer is usually "yes" or "no". For example, 
"You notified the contractor in writing, didn't you?" is a leading question.) 

After the direct examination, the witness may be cross-examined by the opposing side. The questions asked 
on  cross-examination  must  generally  be  about  statements  made  during  the  direct  examination.  (D.R.E. 
611(b)) Leading questions may be used on cross-examination. 

Leading questions may also be used whenever a party calls a hostile witness (one who shows a lack of 
cooperation or anger toward the party who has called him or her to testify), an adverse party (a party on the 
other side of the case), or a witness identified with an adverse party (a witness who has been called to testify 
on direct examination by the party on the opposite side of the case). (D.R.E. 611(c)) 

hat can a witness testify to?  

It depends if the witness is an expert or non-expert. Expert witnesses are persons who have been shown to 
the court to be qualified by their special knowledge, skill or experience (scientific, technical, or other) and 
can testify as an expert in a specific field. Expert witnesses may testify about their opinions based on such 
special knowledge or skill. (D.R.E. 701 and 702). For example, a building contractor may be qualified to 
be an expert witness as to whether building repair work was defective. 

Non-expert witnesses may testify only to (1) facts about which the witness has personal knowledge (what 
they saw, heard, smelled, etc.) (D.R.E. 602) or (2) opinions which do not require any special knowledge or 
skill (D.R.E. 701). Non-expert witnesses may testify as to such things as sobriety, age, distance, value of 
an item that the average person would know, or speed, but may not give an opinion as to fault. For example, 
a non-expert witness may testify to the speed a car was traveling but may not give an opinion as to whether 
the driver was at fault. (Comment to D.R.E. 701) 

In order for a witness to be able to testify as an expert, the witness must first explain to the Court what 
education, training, knowledge, skill or experience she or he possesses which make her or him more skillful 
in the field about which she or he will testify than the average person. For example, a building contractor 
who plans to testify that work was defective should briefly explain to the Court her experience and training 
in building which makes her able to determine that the work was defective. 

an a witness be required to testify?  

Yes. If a party is not sure that a witness will show up at court, the party may subpoena the witness (have 
the court order the person to appear at court to testify) by filing a request for a subpoena with the Court at 
least five days prior to the trial date. (There is a  nominal fee for each subpoena.) A judge or juror may 
usually not be called as a witness to testify with regard to a case he or she has heard. (D.R.E. 605 and 606 
and Justice of the Peace Court Policy Directive 98-168). Also, in certain cases, a privilege may be claimed 
so that a witness may not be required to testify. (D.R.E. 501-510). For example, a defendant may prevent 
his or her spouse (D.R.E. 504), attorney (D.R.E. 502) or physician (D.R.E. 503) from testifying.
