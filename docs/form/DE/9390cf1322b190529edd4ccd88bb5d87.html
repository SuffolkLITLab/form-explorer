A GUIDE TO EXPUNGEMENT OF ADULT RECORD 

EXPUNGEMENT OF AN  
ADULT RECORD 
FAMILY COURT OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE 
https://courts.delaware.gov/family 

 

What is an Expungement? 

n expungement is the way in which all law enforcement agency records 
and  court  records  relating  to  a  case  shielded  from  general  view.    If  an 
expungement is granted, you will not be required to disclose that you were 
arrested for, charged with, or convicted of an offense for which records have 
been expunged, except as provided in section 4376 of Title 11.    

n Delaware, Subchapter VII of Chapter 43 of Title 11 of the Delaware Code 
governs the process of petitioning for expungement of an adult record. 

wo Types of Adult Expungement:  

There  are  two  types  of  expungements.    The  first  type  is  a  Mandatory 
Expungement.  The second type is a Discretionary Expungement.     

Mandatory  Expungements  –  mandatory  expungements  are 
handled by the State Bureau of Identification (SBI).  For detailed information 
on the mandatory expungement process, please see page 8.     

Discretionary  Expungement  –  discretionary  expungements  are 
handled by Superior Court and Family Court.  If your case does not qualify 
for  a  mandatory  expungement,  you  may  still  qualify  for  a  discretionary 
expungement.  A  discretionary  expungement  means  that  the  Attorney 
General’s office will have an opportunity to respond to your petition, and the 
Court will weigh the facts of your case to determine whether the petition is 
granted. The Court may choose to hold a hearing to determine whether or 
not  an  expungement  will  be  granted.  For  detailed  information  on  the 
discretionary expungement process, please see page 9.  

 

In which Court do I file my discretionary expungement petition? 

If all the charges and convictions sought to be expunged were disposed of in 
Family Court, then you must file in Family Court in the county where your most 
recent case was terminated.  If you have any charges or convictions outside of 
Family Court, then you must file in Superior Court in the county where your most 
recent case was terminated for all charges and convictions.

re there reasons why I might be unable to request either a mandatory or discretionary 

expungement?  

  A

Yes, the law provides that you may not request either a mandatory or discretionary expungement if any 
of the following apply: 

  Provide an overview of pardons and expungements. 
  Guide you through the process. 
  Assist with obtaining documents and completing paperwork. 
  Offer preparation classes for Board of Pardons hearings. 
  Connect you to the Job Center's free employment classes and resources. 

1.  You have pending charges.   

(There is an exception if you are seeking an expungement related to an arrest for which no charges 
were filed in any Court within a year of that arrest.)  
Additionally, “pending charges” does not include alleged violations of the following: Section 904(e) or 
(f) of Title 4, Section 4764(c) of Title 16, or Title 21. 
 

2.  You are currently serving a term of incarceration, parole, or probation.  

.  You received an expungement of a prior conviction within the previous 10 years.   

(This limitation will not exclude a person from receiving a mandatory expungement if the mandatory 
expungement application relates to a case which was terminated in favor of the accused.  11 Del. C. 
§§ 4372(f)(4) and 4373(a)(1).)  

.  You received an expungement for a felony conviction, and you are seeking expungement of 

  3

a new felony conviction. 
 

5.  You owe fines, fees or restitution associated with your conviction. 

(If the fine is not yet satisfied for reasons other than willful noncompliance, the Court may waive the 
fines and fees or convert the obligation to a civil judgement.  An applicant would have to apply to 
the Court for this relief.)   
 

6.  You want to expunge Title 21 offenses.  A Title 21 offense is not expungable unless it is one 

of the following: 

a.  Driving after judgment prohibited (21 Del. C. § 2810) 
b.  Reckless driving (21 Del. C. § 4175) 
c.  Operation of a motor vehicle causing death (21 Del. C. § 4176A)

or 23 of the Delaware Code in any of the three following situations: 
 

1.  When a person is arrested or charged with 1 or more felony, misdemeanor or violation crimes 
and the case is terminated in the person’s favor.  “Terminated in favor” means any of the 
following:  

a.  The accused is acquitted of all charges related to the case. 
b.  A nolle prosequi is entered on all charges related to the case.  
c.  The accused is placed on probation before judgment, fulfills the terms and conditions

charges are dismissed by the entry of a nolle prosequi or otherwise.

the  last  12  months,  nor  can  the  case  include  any  other  charges  that  were  not 
terminated in your favor.

ow will the Court decide whether to grant my Petition for Discretionary Expungement?

continued  existence  and  giving  out  of  the  related  criminal  information  causes,  or  may  cause,  you  a 
manifest injustice.   

What is manifest injustice?  

Manifest injustice essentially means hardship.  Manifest injustice on the 
expungement petition refers to the harm caused by having a record, not the 
circumstances surrounding your arrest.   

hat do I have to explain to show manifest injustice?  
You must explain why having a record is causing you difficulties in your life or 
holding you back in some way, including but not limited to:

If I file a Petition for Discretionary Expungement, will the Court grant the expungement 
automatically?  

Not  necessarily.  Once  your  petition  is  filed,  a  copy  of  your  petition  will  be  provided  to  the  Attorney 
General’s Office. The Attorney General’s Office will then have 120 days to file an Answer. In its Answer, 
the Attorney General’s Office will have the opportunity to oppose your request. If the Attorney General’s 
Office files an Answer, you will then have 30 days to file a Reply. The Court will consider both your 
position and that of the Attorney General’s Office in deciding your petition.   

Will the Court hold a hearing regarding my Petition for Discretionary Expungement? 

The Court will hold a hearing only if the Court believes it is necessary. If the Court finds your petition is 
eligible for a discretionary expungement and that the continued giving out of the record causes you a 
manifest  injustice,  it  will  enter  an  order  requiring  the  expungement  of  the  police  and  court  records.  
Otherwise, it will deny the Petition.  Often this is done without a hearing. 

What if I qualify for both a mandatory expungement and a discretionary expungement? 

You  may  apply  to  both  SBI,  for  the  mandatory  expungement,  and  the  Court,  for  the  discretionary 
expungement. You may also include a case that is eligible for mandatory expungement in your petition 
for  discretionary  expungement.  The  Court  may  address  both  the  mandatory  and  discretionary 
expungement requests. 11 Del. C. § 4374(d)(2). 

hat will happen if my expungement is granted? 

If  the  Court  enters  an  Order  granting  your  Petition  for  Discretionary  Expungement,  then  all  law-
enforcement agency records and Court records relating to the case(s) and the charge or set of charges 
related to that case(s), including fingerprints and photographs, will be shielded from view.   

If a potential employer does a criminal background check through the State Bureau of Identification, 
there will be no evidence on record with the Court or other State agencies relating to the expunged 
case(s) and the charge or set of charges related to that case(s). 

What is a pardon? 

A pardon is an official statement of forgiveness of your offense issued by the Governor. A pardon does 
NOT remove the conviction from your official records; however, a pardon will generally restore your 
civil  rights,  such  as  the  rights  to  vote  and  hold  public  office.  A  pardon  may  remove  barriers  to 
employment, professional licensing, public housing, social services, education, and other opportunities. 

As  with  any  discretionary  expungement  petition,  the  Court  has  the  discretion  whether  to  grant  the 
expungement.

Rev 9/22 

I received a pardon from the Governor, am I eligible to apply for a discretionary expungement? 

If you received an unconditional pardon from the Governor, you are eligible to request a discretionary 
expungement unless you would be seeking to expunge any of the following: 

a)  Manslaughter (11 Del. C. § 632)  
b)  Murder in the second degree (11 Del. C. § 635) 
c)  Murder in the first degree (11 Del. C. § 636)

first degree (11 Del. C. § 778(1), (2), or (3)). 

As  with  any  discretionary  expungement  petition,  the  Court  has  the  discretion  whether  to  grant  the 
expungement.
