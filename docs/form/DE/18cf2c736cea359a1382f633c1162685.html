Rev 10/21 
 
GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION OF PARENTAL RIGHTS 

omplete a separate Grounds for Termination of Parental Rights form for each child named 
in the Petition for Termination of Parental Rights.  If there are 2 children, then 2  Grounds for 
Termination of Parental Rights forms MUST be completed and attached to the Petition. 
 

CHILD’S NAME: 

           

ndicate the grounds for Termination of Parental Rights (Place an “X” next to the grounds that apply). At 
least one of the boxes numbered 1 through 9 must be checked. 

CONSENT: 

1. 

  A parent of the child, or a person or organization holding parental rights over the child, agrees 
(consents) that this Petition should be granted.   

 A Consent to Termination and Transfer of Parental Rights (Form 140) is attached to the Petition.  

NTENTIONAL ABANDONMENT: 

2. 

  Respondent(s) have intentionally abandoned the child as evidenced by the fact that (If you check 
box 2, you must place an “X” next to at least one of the following that apply): 

a. 

b. 

c. 

 The child is younger than 6 months old at the time of filing this Petition and Respondent(s) 
FAILED to: 
➢  Pay reasonable prenatal, natal and postnatal expenses for the child; AND  
➢  Visit regularly with the child or file a petition for visitation with the child; AND 
➢  Manifest (show) an ability and willingness to assume legal and physical custody of the 

child (if the child was NOT in the physical custody of the other parent). 

 The child is at least 6 months old at the time of filing this Petition AND for at least 6 
consecutive months (6 months in a row) of the 12 months preceding the filing of this Petition, 
Respondent(s) FAILED to: 
➢  Communicate or visit regularly with the child; AND 
➢  Manifest (show) the ability and willingness to assume legal and physical custody of the 

child (if the child was NOT in the physical custody of the other parent). 
 

 The child is younger than 6 years old at the time of filing this Petition AND Respondent(s) 
have placed the child in circumstances leaving the child in substantial risk of injury or death 
and, therefore, has manifested (shown) the unwillingness to exercise parental rights and 
responsibilities. 

NINTENTIONAL ABANDONMENT: 

  Respondent(s) have unintentionally abandoned the child because for 12 consecutive months (12 
months in a row) in the 18 months before filing this Petition, Respondent(s) FAILED to: 

➢  Communicate or visit regularly with the child; AND 

➢  File or pursue a pending Petition to establish paternity or to establish a right to have contact 

or visitation with the child; AND 

➢  Manifest (show) an ability and willingness to assume legal and physical custody of the child 

(if the child was NOT in the physical custody of the other parent).

AND at least one of the below applies (Place an “X” next to at least one of the following that apply): 

 
  The child is not in the other parents’ legal and physical custody and Respondent(s) are not 
able  or  willing  promptly  to  assume  legal  and  physical  custody  of  the  child,  and  to  pay  for 
reasonable support for the child. 

  The child is in the legal and physical custody of the other parent and a stepparent, and the 
stepparent  is  the  prospective  adoptive  parent,  and  Respondent(s)  are  not  able  or  willing 
promptly to establish and maintain contact with the child and to pay reasonable support for the 
child in accordance with the Respondent(s)’ financial means. 

  Placing the child in Respondent(s)’ legal and physical custody would pose a risk of substantial 
harm to the child’s physical or psychological well-being.  Respondent(s) are unfit to maintain a 
relationship  of  “parent  and  child”  with  the  child  because  of  at  least  one  (1)  of  the  following 
reasons: 

i.  The circumstances of the child’s conception; OR 
ii.  Respondent(s)’ behavior during pregnancy; OR 
iii.  Respondent(s)’ behavior after the child was born; OR 
iv.  Respondent(s)’ behavior with respect to another child. 

  Failure to grant the Petition for Termination of Parental Rights would be detrimental to the child. 

In  determining  whether  failure  to  grant the  termination of parental  right  would  be  detrimental  to  the child,  the  Court  will 
consider all relevant factors, including the following: 

DETRIMENTAL TO THE CHILD 

A.   The respondent’s efforts to obtain or maintain legal and physical custody of the child. 
B.   The role of another person in thwarting the respondent’s efforts to assert parental rights. 
C.   The respondent’s ability to care for the child. 
D.   The child’s age. 
E.   The quality of a previous relationship between the respondent and child, and between the respondent and 

another child. 

F.   The duration and suitability of the child’s current custodial environment. 
G.   The effect on the child of a change of physical custody. 

 

 

4. 

CONVICTION OR ADJUDICATION: 

 

  Respondent(s) have been convicted or adjudicated of the following (or a substantially similar offense 
in another jurisdiction) (If you check box 4, you must place an “X” next to at least one of the 
following that apply): 

  A felony level offense against the person under Subchapter II of Chapter 5 of Title 11, in which the 
victim was a child; OR 
  Aided,  abetted,  attempted,  conspired  or  solicited  to  commit  a  felony  level  offense  against  the 
person under Subchapter II of Chapter 5 of Title 11, in which the victim was a child; OR 
  Dealing in Children or attempting to deal in children under § 1100A of Title 11; OR 
  Felony level endangering the welfare of a child under § 1102 of Title 11; OR 
  Murder or manslaughter of the other parent of the child who is the subject of the petition; OR 
  Aiding, abetting, attempting, conspiring, or soliciting to commit murder or manslaughter of the other 
parent of the child who is the subject of this petition.

  The Respondent(s) have a history of dependency, neglect, abuse, or lack of care of the child 
or another child. 
  The Respondent(s) are incapable of discharging parental responsibilities due to extended or 
repeated incarceration (the Court may consider the Respondent(s)’ postconviction conduct).

child or neglected child in the Respondent(s)’ care and ALL of the following are true: 
 The Petitioner is the child’s parent, guardian, permanent guardian, or relative.

future. *NOTE*:  in making this determination, the Court shall consider the Respondent(s)’ efforts to 
remedy the dependency or neglect.

threatening abuse.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
