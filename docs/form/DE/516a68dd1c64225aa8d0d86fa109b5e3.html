WHEREAS, the parties agreed to, and the Court entered on ________, 20__, 

a case scheduling order to govern the above-captioned action, which provides for 

the presentation of expert testimony; and 

WHEREAS,  the  parties  have  discussed  and  agreed  upon  the  proposed 

procedures to govern discovery in connection with expert witnesses in this action as 

set forth below. 

IT  IS  HEREBY  STIPULATED  AND  AGREED,  by  the  parties  hereto, 

through their undersigned counsel, subject to the approval of the Court, pursuant to 

Court  of  Chancery  Rules  26  and  29,  that  the  following  procedures  shall  govern 

discovery in connection with expert witnesses in this action:  

1.  With respect to any person whom a party to this action expects to call 

as a witness at trial or any hearing to present evidence under Rules 702, 703, or 705 

 

 
 

of  the  Delaware  Uniform  Rules  of  Evidence  (an  “Expert”),  the  party  shall,  in 

accordance with the deadlines agreed upon and ordered in the Stipulation and Order 

Governing Case Schedule, designate its Expert or Experts.  Such designation shall 

include, at a minimum, the following: 

(a)  The identification of each Expert by name and title;  

(b) The Expert’s curriculum vitae; and 

(c)  A  summary  of  the  subject  matters  on  which  each  Expert  will 

testify. 

2. 

Any report from an Expert (each an “Expert Report”) shall include, at 

a minimum, the following:  

(a)  A  complete  statement  of  all  opinions  to  be  expressed  by  the 

Expert and the basis and reasons therefor; 

(b)  A list of the documents, data, and other information on which the 
Expert  relied  in  forming  the  opinions  reflected  in  the  Expert 
Report; 

(c)  A list of the documents, data, and other information, other than 
that encompassed by subparagraphs (a) and (b) above, on which 
the Expert intends to rely upon in testifying in this matter; 

(d)  A list of any exhibits used in the Expert Report.  This shall not 
preclude  the  Expert  from  using  demonstrative  exhibits  when 
testifying  at  trial  so  long  as  such  demonstrative  exhibits  are 
provided to all parties in accordance with such schedule as may 
be agreed by the parties or established by the Court; 

(e)  A statement of the qualifications of the Expert;  

(f)  A  list  of  all  articles,  treatises,  books,  working  papers  or  other 
publications  authored  by  the  Expert  within  the  preceding  10 
years and, upon request, copies of all such (or relevant portions 
of such) publications so listed; 

 2 

 

 
 

(g)  A  list  of  all  articles,  treatises,  books,  working  papers,  or  other 
publications authored or co-authored by the Expert at any time 
relating to the subject matter on which the Expert is offering an 
opinion in the above-captioned action, and upon request, copies 
of  all  such  (or  relevant  portions  of  such)  articles  or  working 
papers so listed; 

(h)  A statement of the compensation paid or to be paid to the Expert 
by the party sponsoring that Expert or by any other individual or 
entity in connection with his or her work in the above-captioned 
action  (including  payments  by  or  to  outside  data  consultants 
reviewing work product to assist in the Expert’s analysis); and 

(i)  A list of any other litigation or any administrative proceeding, in 
which the Expert has submitted an expert report or has testified 
as  an  expert  in  a  deposition,  hearing  or  at  trial,  within  the 
preceding  five  years,  including,  to  the  extent  not  otherwise 
prohibited  by  confidentiality  obligations,  the  names  of  the 
parties, the court in which the action was filed, or, if transferred, 
the court where the action was transferred, the docket number, 
and any other information necessary to identify the litigation or 
proceeding. 

3. 

Notwithstanding  anything  in  Paragraph  2,  discovery  shall  not  be 

permitted into the following:  

(a)  Draft reports, draft studies, draft affidavits, or draft work papers; 
computations, 
preliminary  or 
analyses,  or  data;  or  other  preliminary,  intermediate,  or  draft 
materials prepared by, for, or at the direction of an Expert unless 
the Expert relies on the aforementioned as a basis for his or her 
opinion(s); 

calculations, 

intermediate 

(b)  Any notes or other writings taken or prepared by or for an Expert 
in connection with this matter, including, but not limited to, e-
mail  (or  other  electronic  communication),  correspondence  or 
memoranda  to  or  from,  and  notes  of  conversations  with,  the 
Expert’s assistants and/or clerical or support staff, other Experts, 
non-testifying  expert  consultants,  or  attorneys  for  the  party 

 3 

 

 
 

offering the testimony of such Expert, unless the Expert relies on 
the aforementioned as a basis for his or her opinion(s); 

(c)  Materials  or  information  that  may  have  been  reviewed  or 

considered but not relied upon by the Expert; and  

(d)  Written or oral communications between or among the Expert, 
any person at the Expert’s firm and any party or counsel or other 
agent  for  the  party  on  whose  behalf  the  Expert  was  engaged, 
except to the limited extent that an Expert expressly relies on a 
communication of a matter of fact from such counsel, agent, or 
party in the Expert Report or in testimony. 

4. 

Documents and other written materials referred to in Paragraph 2 shall 

be identified at the time the Expert Report is delivered to the opposing party by Bates 

number if such documents have been produced in this litigation, and otherwise shall 

be identified with reasonable particularity.  Copies of such documents, if they have 

not been produced in this litigation, shall be produced at the time the Expert Report 

is delivered to the opposing party; provided, however, that a party may prepare and 

use  additional  demonstrative  exhibits  during  the  course  of  any  trial  or  hearing 

(including recesses) so long as such demonstrative exhibits are provided to all parties 

in accordance with such schedule as may be agreed by the parties or established by 

the Court.   

5. 

In responding to the discovery required by Paragraphs 2 and 4 hereof, 

a party need not produce, but must nevertheless identify, (i) transcripts of depositions 

taken in this action, by name of deponent and date of deposition; (ii) exhibits from 

depositions,  by  exhibit  number,  taken  in  this  action;  and  (iii)  publicly  available 

 4 

 

 
 

regulatory filings.  Spreadsheets, data sets, and like supporting materials, which the 

Expert  relied  on  in  forming  the  opinions  reflected  in  the  Expert  Report,  shall  be 

produced in native electronic and fixed formats.  Native format documents may be 

stripped of their metadata, provided that formulae, hidden columns, and algorithms 

in native format documents that are required to derive the results displayed therein 

are preserved. 

6. 

Any fees charged by an Expert for responding to discovery, including 

time spent at depositions, shall be paid by the party who has retained the Expert; 

provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude or constitute a waiver of any 

party’s right to seek recovery of any fees or expenses paid in connection with the 

work  of  any  Expert  retained  in  connection  with  the  above-captioned  action, 

including in any fee and expense request made in connection with any settlement or 

final judgment in the above-captioned action, or any party’s right to oppose any such 

request. 

7. 

Nothing herein shall limit or waive any party’s rights to object for any 

reason to (i) the admission, in whole or in part, of any opposing party’s Expert Report 

into evidence, (ii) the qualification of any person to serve as an expert witness, or 

(iii) the admission of some or all of any Expert’s testimony. 

8. 

Nothing  herein  shall  be  deemed  to  authorize  or  permit  discovery  of 

facts  known  or  opinions  held  by  an  Expert  who  has  been  retained  or  specially 

 5 

 

 

 
 

employed by a party exclusively in anticipation of and connection with litigation or 

preparation  for  trial  or  any  hearing  and  who  the  party  will  not  call  as  an  expert 

witness at trial or any hearing. 

9. 

The  scope  of  a  party’s  rebuttal  Expert  Report  shall  be  limited  to 

rebutting  positions  taken  in  the  opposing  Party’s  opening  Expert  Report,  and  no 

party may submit a rebuttal report on a topic not addressed by the other party in an 

opening Expert Report. 

10.  No  subpoena  for  deposition  or  documents  need  be  served  on  any 

Expert.  Instead, the party who retained the Expert shall make the Expert available 

for  a  deposition  at  a  time  and  place  mutually  agreeable  to  the  parties  and  in 

accordance with the case scheduling order.  

11.  This  Stipulation  and  Order  applies  solely  to  discovery  of  or  from 

Experts in their capacity as experts and does not apply to discovery of fact witnesses.  

[None  of  the  individuals  or  entities  that  served  as  Defendant’s  legal  or  financial 

advisors in connection with any of the transactions that are the subject of this action 

shall constitute Experts or be subject to the terms of this Stipulation and Order.] 

12.  This  Stipulation  may  be  amended  only  by  a  subsequent  written 

stipulation between the Parties or upon order of the Court for good cause shown.

      <p>We have done our best to automaticly identify and name form fields according to our <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables/">naming conventions</a>. 
      When possible, we've used names tied to our question library. See e.g., <a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/question_library/names">user1_name</a>.
      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
