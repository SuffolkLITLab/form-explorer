      <pre>The Family Court of the State of Delaware 
 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHILD SUPPORT CALCULATION (2023) 

   

 

Effective February 1, 2023, the Family Court revised the Delaware Child Support Formula (“the 

Formula”) as stated within Family Court Civil Rules 500 through 510.  The revised formula applies to 

both prospective and retroactive calculations.  All monetary allowances will be adjusted no later than 

February 1st of every year in accordance with any changes in the United States Department of Health 

and Human Services (HHS) poverty guidelines. The entire formula will be reviewed again in 2026.  

These instructions are intended to assist in determining child support obligations but are not a 

substitute for the Rules or any applicable law. 

Form 509i 
Rev 1/23 
 

The Formula is a rebuttable presumption for establishing child support obligations in Delaware.  

This means the child support obligation indicated by the Formula should be adopted unless the Court 

finds the result contrary to the best interest of the child or unfair to the parties and chooses to deviate 

from the Formula. Every child support order, including consent orders negotiated outside of Court, 

must have one or more support calculations attached even if the parties agree to another amount.  An 

automated version of the Child Support calculation is available online at 

https://courts.delaware.gov/family/. 

REASONABLE EARNING CAPACITY 

  A Child Support Financial Disclosure Report (also known as Form 16A) must be submitted with 

supporting  documentation  at  any  mediation  conference  and  prior  to  any  hearing.    Documentation 

includes  a  parent’s  most  recent  tax  returns,  W-2  forms,  and  3  most  recent  pay  stubs  but  may  also 

include  documentation  of  Social  Security,  unemployment  compensation,  workers’  compensation, 

medical disability, childcare, and medical insurance.  Self-employed individuals and persons employed 

through a closely held corporation should be prepared with recent tax returns with all schedules, 1099 

forms, documentation of significant expenses categories, and recent bank statements. 

Child  support  is  calculated  upon  each  parent’s  reasonable  earning  capacity.  Delaware 

Department of Labor wage surveys (https://laborfiles.delaware.gov/main/lmi/publications) can be used 

to assess whether earnings are appropriate and to determine reasonable earning capacity. A parent 

employed at least 35 hours per week at a job appropriate to their training and experience, and earning 

   

 

 

   

 

reater than the “entry” level wage for their profession as reported in the wage surveys is presumed to 

have reached reasonable earning capacity.  A parent in an appropriate job but working fewer than 35 

hours per week must be imputed (treated as if they are working) at least 35 hours per week.  If income 

is undocumented, if a parent is un- or underemployed either voluntarily or due to their own misconduct, 

or if a parent fails to appear for a hearing or mediation, then reasonable earning capacity will be imputed 

at not less than “presumptive minimum income”.  Presumptive minimum income is $1960 per month 

(statewide entry level wage according to the DOL wage surveys at 150 hours per month and updated 

annually).  However, a parent who voluntarily or through misconduct has a decrease in income may be 

imputed their prior income or an income based upon their education, training, and experience. 

Form 509i 
Rev 1/23 

  g

For cases facilitated by the Division of Child Support Services (DCSS), quarterly wages earned by 

parents and reported to government agencies for unemployment compensation purposes (DOL and 

INQT  reports)  will  be  admitted  into  evidence.    Notices  for  hearings  and  mediation  conferences  to 

establish or modify support have contact information for parties to obtain their own wage reports prior 

to the hearing or mediation.  If credible evidence is presented to contradict a wage report, the court 

may provide a party 10 days to submit documentation resolving the discrepancy. 

Parents who receive unemployment compensation are presumed to have lost employment by no 

fault of their own.  A parent who loses employment involuntarily and through no fault of their own will 

be imputed the greater of one-half of their prior income, any unemployment compensation received, or 

presumptive  minimum  income.  However,  unemployment  that  exceeds  6  months  in  duration  is 

presumed to be voluntary.  Parents who don’t receive unemployment compensation are presumed to 

have  left  employment  voluntarily  or  been  fired  for  misconduct.  Parents  who  suffer  a  loss  of  income 

voluntarily or due to misconduct may have their obligation calculated upon actual current earnings if 

over a reasonable period they have earnestly sought to maximize their income capacity. 

Receipt of Social Security Disability (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is proof of a 

disability  which  may  limit  ability  to  work.    A  parent  receiving  SSI  will  not  be  assessed  an  obligation 

unless  the  parent  has  additional  income  or  resources  with  which  to  pay  support.    SSI  paid  to  a 

household  due  to  a  child’s  disability  is  also  not  considered  income  for  any  purpose.    Continuous 

incarceration of more than 180 days is also evidence of diminished earning capacity.  Most orders 

that issued after January 31, 2019, will automatically decrease to one-half of a “minimum order” on a 

parent’s 181st day of continuous confinement. 

   

   

 

 

NET AVAILABLE INCOME 

Net available income is determined by taking gross income and subtracting certain deductions and 

a self-support allowance, and accounting for each parent’s obligation to support other children, if any.  

If the party seeking support is not a parent, then support is calculated using only the income of the 

parent in the case before the Court and a primary share of 50% is utilized at Line 9.  All amounts must 

be monthly and rounded to the nearest whole number.  To convert from weekly, multiply by 4.333.  For 

biweekly, multiply by 2.167. 

Line 1--Monthly Gross Income is the combination of the following: 

ages: This includes salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses, and any other income (other than self-

employment income) that is subject to Federal Retirement and/or Medicare taxes including pre-tax 

compensation. 

econdary Income: Secondary income is income from second jobs and passive income from interest, 

dividends,  and  trusts.  Whether  to  include  secondary  income  is  determined  case  by  case.    It  is 

more likely to be included if it has been historically earned, raises the standard of living of the parent, 

or is necessary to meet the minimum needs of the child.  It is more likely to be excluded if it merely 

allows the parent to make ends meet, is used to pay extraordinary medical or educational expenses 

(including those of a dependent outside of the case), is necessitated by the nonpayment of support, 

or  the  job  substantially  conflicts  with  visitation.    Passive  income  may  also  be  excluded  if  it  was 

historically saved or reinvested. 

Overtime: Fluctuations in income or that overtime is not guaranteed is not a basis for exclusion.  

The Court must determine the average monthly income likely to recur.  Secondary income and 

voluntary overtime that is no longer earned will not be imputed if it has been over 2½ years since 

the  last  determination  of  support,  and  income  from  primary  employment  is  consistent  with 

reasonable earning capacity.

ther Income: All other income (including SSDI and SSR) otherwise includable on the parent’s federal 

income  tax  return  is  presumptively  considered  in  the  calculation.    Some  types  of  nontaxable 

resources  are  entered  under  “nontaxable  income”  as  described  below.  SSDI  (Social  Security 

Disability Insurance) paid into a household for the support of a child of the union due to a parent's 

disability are included in that parent's income but offset the Net Monthly Obligation (Line 24) dollar 

for dollar. SSI (Supplemental Security Income) paid into a household due to a child’s disability is will 

NOT be considered. 

elf-Employment:  All  income  from  self-employment  or  as  an  independent  contractor  and  typically 

reported on a 1099 Form and includable on a Schedule SE federal income tax return is considered 

for child support.  If actual payment of self-employment taxes is not provided, a 7% deduction is 

provided on Line 3.  But without documentation, it should be reported as “other oncome”.  

ontaxable Income: Alimony awarded or modified after 2018, nontaxable proceeds from a private or 

public entity paid to a parent due to an injury or disability, personal injury awards or settlements, 

military allowances, or any cash entitlement not based on need that enhances the standard of living 

of  a  parent  but  is  not  taxable  under  federal  law  shall  be  included.    This  includes  Veterans 

Administration  (VA)  benefits  but  does  not  include  any  payment  made  by  the  Social  Security 

Administration (SSA).  Nontaxable income is subject to a 25% surcharge on Line 2. 

While  all  military  allowances  (except  clothing)  are  included,  no  military  service  member  shall  be 

attributed a housing allowance (BAH) that exceeds BAH w/dependents at Dover AFB.

officers)

Exceptions  to  income:  Expense  reimbursements  or  in-kind  payments  received  in  the  course  of 

employment, self-employment, or operation of a business should be counted as income only if they 

are significant and reduce personal living expenses. A cost-of-living stipend given to an employee 

as  compensation  due  to  relocation  (whether  or  not  voluntary)  to  a  high-cost  location  will  not  be 

included as income if it is clearly identified on pay documents. Adoption subsidies pursuant to 42 

U.S.C. § 673 or a similar statute shall not be counted as income.

ine 2 – Nontaxable Income Adjustment – Multiply any nontaxable income include on Line 1 by 25% 

to  represent  the  taxable  earned  income  equivalent.    Other  than  payments  made  by  the  Social 

Security Administration, a parent shall be imputed an additional 25% of that nontaxable income in 

increased by 25% to estimate the taxable earned income equivalent. 

ine 3—Self Employment Tax Adjustment:  If a parent provides documentation of actual payment of 

self-employment  tax,  7%  of  the  parent’s  self-employment  income  will  be  deducted  from  gross 

income.  However,  the  deduction  is  only  available  to  the  extent  combined  wages  and  self-

employment income does not exceed the Social Security maximum (currently $13,350). 

ine 4--Allowable Deductions 

Pension:  All  mandatory  pension  contributions  are  deductible.  Voluntary  contributions  to  an  IRS 

approved retirement plans (for example, 401K, TSP, 457, 403(b), SEP) are deductible but only to 

the extent mandatory contributions do not exceed 5% of gross income.  The automated calculation 

on the Court’s website will automatically calculate the maximum allowable amount. 

Union Dues: Average monthly union dues. 

Disability Insurance: Disability insurance premiums withheld from pay or purchased privately for 

purposes of income replacement (but not to cover credit card or mortgage obligations). 

edical  Insurance  NOT  covering  these  children:  Medical  insurance  premiums  (including 

COBRA) covering the parent or their dependents BUT NOT THE CHILDREN OF THIS UNION are 

a deduction from gross income. Insurance premiums for policies that cover the children of this union 

are entered on Line 12(c). 

ther: Any court ordered alimony payments, or mandatory deductions included on pay stubs (such 

as uniforms or supplies) required by an employer. 

Line  5--Self  Support  Allowance:  The  self-support  allowance  is  the  minimum  amount  of  income 

necessary for a parent to remain productive in a workplace.  Each parent is given a self-support 

allowance of $1460. 

ine  6--Net  Income  after  Self  Support:  Subtract  the  self-employment  adjustment  (if  applicable), 

deductions, health insurance & the self-support allowance from gross income.

only to natural or adopted children who reside in  the parent’s household, or  for whom there is a 

court order for support or proof of a pattern of support.  It also includes adult dependents if there is 

a court order of support or written agreement between the parties before the Court. This does not 

include stepchildren.  If the person seeking support is a guardian, then indicate here whether the 

guardian has guardianship of any children other than in the pending case.

ine 9--Share of Total Net Available: Divide the Net Available for Primary Support for each parent 

(Line 8) by the Total Net Available (Line 8 Total).  Enter the results on Line 9.  If the party seeking 

support is a not a parent, then enter 50%. 

 

PRIMARY SUPPORT 

  Primary support consists of a Primary Support Allowance based upon the number of children of this 

union  in  each  household,  work  related  childcare  expenses,  private  school  expenses  (under  some 

circumstances), other ongoing special needs of a child and medical insurance premiums for policies 

covering the children. 

ine 10--Number of Children of this Union in each Household: Enter the number of children of this 

union who reside in each parent's household.  If a child resides equally (more than 163 overnights) 

in both households, assign ½ child or “.5” to each household.  Do not include children from other 

relationships.

support action required for the parent to work.  Hypothetical childcare costs are not permitted. 

 - Allowable Tuition or Other Primary Expenses:  Private or parochial school expenses may 

be included if the parents have adequate financial resources and upon consideration by the Court 

of all the equities especially: 

i.  Previous agreement to pay for child(ren)s’ attendance in private; or 

ii.  The child has special needs that cannot be accommodated in a public-school setting; or 

iii. Immediate family history indicates that the child likely would have attended private or 

parochial school. 

 - Medical Insurance Covering to the Children:  Any medical insurance premium for a policy that 

covers the children of this union is included on Line 12C.   Documentation is REQUIRED.  That 

amount is then multiplied by 75% if the parent has no other children to support (“No” on Line 7A), 

or  50%  if  the  parent  has  other  children  to  support  (“Yes”  on  Line  7A).    This  includes  insurance 

acquired through a stepparent’s or guardian’s employment but only if the stepparent’s or guardian’s 

own children are not covered by the policy.  If the cost to cover the both the parent and the children 

exceeds 10% of income, then it is presumed to be unaffordable. However, once acquired, coverage 

must be retained until further order of the Court or written agreement of the parties.

ine  25—Cash  Medical  Support:  Each  parent  is  required  to  contribute  to  each  child’s  medical 

expenses not covered by insurance.  The percentage is based on each parent’s Primary Share of 

Net  Available  on  Line  9.    If  the  percentage  is  not  already  a  multiple  of  10%,  then  round  the 

percentage to the next multiple of 10% that is closer to 50%.  For example, if Line 9 is greater than

arents should attempt to manage medical reimbursement issues privately.  Petitions may be filed 

for reimbursement for a past medical expense or contribution to an anticipated expense.  A petition 

for a past expense should be filed no later than December 31 in the 2nd year after the expense is 

incurred.  For example, reimbursement for an expense incurred in 2021 must be filed no later than 

December 31, 2023.  Later applications may be considered for good cause shown. 

Minimum Orders:  Unless the children reside in shared or split placement or the obligated parent is 

disabled, the Court will impose an obligation of not less than $150 for one child and $220 for more 

than one child.  The obligation, if any, of a disabled person with limited resources will be determined 

on a case-by-case basis.

epayment: If an obligated parent owes back support or arrears, the court will direct the balance to be 

repaid at an amount equal to 20% of current support but not less than $20 per month.  Furthermore: 

 

If  the  obligation  terminates  due  to  the  change  of  placement  of  the  children  to  the  obligated 

parent, then the presumptive repayment is 20% of the prior current support obligation.   

 

If an obligation terminates for any other reason, the obligation continues in the total amount 

until all balances are paid.

  Payment on arrears owed to the State of Delaware is limited to $20 per month if the parent 

owes current support or arrears to any other private individual or to another State.   

  A person is presumed to have the ability to pay at least 120% of what their obligation would 

have been under the Formula if current support had been ongoing.  When using the Formula 

for this purpose, a 50% “primary share” on Line 9 is utilized.  

  The standard repayment for genetic test costs is $20 per month. 

etroactivity: In a new support petition, 6 months of retroactivity prior to filing is presumed.  Each party 

may present evidence to persuade the Court to impose greater or lesser back support, but it cannot 

exceed 2 years.  Retroactivity in a modification petition cannot go further back than 3 days after the 

date the summons is mailed.  If a person seeking support affirmatively declined current support in 

a previous petition, then back support cannot go further back than that declination. 

odification:  Petitions for modification filed within 2½ years of the last order of current support must 

allege  “with  particularity"  a  substantial  change  of  circumstances  not  caused  by  the  Petitioner’s 

voluntary or wrongful conduct. An order will not be modified unless a change of more than 10% is 

indicated.  Beyond  2½  years,  neither  the  "particularity"  nor  the  "10%"  applies.    A  change  caused 

solely by a revision of the child support formula is not ground for modification.  Support orders may 

increase, decrease, or reverse the payer and payee regardless of who filed the petition.  The 2½ 

year ‘particularity’ requirement also applies to petitions to modify an arrears payment. 

hared  Incidental  Expenses:  If  a  child  resides  in  shared  placement,  the  parents  are  expected  to 

equally  share  in  all  incidental  expenses  that  would  otherwise  be  borne  by  a  primary  residential 

parent.  Failure to do so can result in sanctions including, possibly, calculating support as if the child 

resides primarily with the other parent. At a minimum, shared expenses include: 

  Haircuts 

  Enrollment/uniform and other mandatory fees 

  School lunches 

(but 

not 

equipment) 

associated  with 

 

Instrument rentals 

participating  in  local  recreational  sports  or 

extracurricular activities. 

  School supplies 

  Local 

field 

trips  not 

requiring  overnight 

  School project supplies 

accommodations or air transportation.   

Whether other expenses should be shared by the parents depends upon: 

  R

  M

  S

 

Form 509i 
Rev 1/23 
 

  Whether  the  parents  agreed  or  acquiesced  to  the  expense  being  incurred  (even  if  the 

parents did not agree how to divide the expense); 

  Whether the expense is customarily incurred by similarly situated families; 

  Whether both parents benefit from the expense; 

  The amount of the expense and the frequency with which it will be incurred; and 

  The parents’ respective abilities to contribute to the expense. 

ncarceration:  The  obligation  of  an  incarcerated  parents  will  be  based  upon  pre-incarceration 

circumstances  for  the  first  180  days  of  continuous  confinement.    If  the  incarcerated  parent  has 

insufficient resources to otherwise pay their full obligation, beyond 180 day the obligation is reduced 

to a one-half of a minimum order thereafter.  All orders that issued after January 31, 2019, contain 

a provision whereby this adjustment occurs automatically upon 181 days of continuous confinement.  

For obligations determined prior to 2/1/2019, the reduction requires the filing of a Petition for Support 

Modification. 

Exceptions still applicable - Orders issued between 2/1/2019 and 1/31/2023 include exceptions 

wherein the obligation will not be reduced if the support recipient or the children of the order were 

the victims of an offense for which the obligated parent is incarcerated, or if the parent is incarcerated 

for nonpayment of child support.  These exceptions will remain in force until the obligation is modified 

which  can  be  petitioned  for  by  either  party  upon  a  substantial  change  of  circumstances  or  the 

passage of 2½ years.  While the Formula has been modified to remove these exceptions in future 

orders, a change to the Formula is not in itself a basis for modification.
