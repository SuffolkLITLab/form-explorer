intention  to  appear,  identifying  the  name,  address,  and  telephone  number  of  the

a written statement of such person’s objections to any matter before the Court, (d)

served electronically via LexisNexis e-service, by hand, or by overnight mail upon 

the following counsel:

8. 

entitled to object to the Settlement, or to the Order and Final Judgment to be entered 

herein,  or  to  the  award  of  attorneys’  fees  and  expenses  to  Plaintiff’s  Counsel,  or 

otherwise to be heard, except by serving and filing written objections as prescribed 

in Paragraph 7.  Any person who fails to object in the manner provided above shall 

be deemed to have waived the right to object (including any right of appeal) and 

shall be forever barred from raising such objection in this Action or in any other 

action or proceeding. 

9. 

Plaintiff  shall  file  and  serve  its  opening  brief  in  support  of  the 

Settlement  and  its  application  for  attorneys’  fees  and  expenses  no  later  than  30 

business days prior to the Settlement Hearing.  Any objections to the application for 

attorneys’ fees and expenses shall be filed and served no later than 15 business days 

prior to the Settlement Hearing.  If any objections to the Settlement are received or 

6 

 

 

filed,  Plaintiff  and/or  Defendants  may  file  and  serve  a  brief  response  to  those 

objections no later than five business days prior to the Settlement Hearing. 

10. 

If  the  Court  approves  the  Settlement  provided  for  in  the  Stipulation 

following  the  Settlement  Hearing,  judgment  shall  be  entered  substantially  in  the 

form attached as Exhibit [C] to the Stipulation. 

11. 

In the event that:  (a) the Court declines, in any material respect, to enter 

the  Order  and  Final  Judgment  provided  for  in  the  Stipulation  and  any  one  of  the 

parties hereto fails to consent to the entry of another form of order in lieu thereof; 

(b) the Court disapproves the Settlement proposed in the Stipulation, including any 

amendments thereto agreed upon by all of the parties; or (c) the Court approves the 

Settlement proposed in the Stipulation or any amendment thereto approved by all of 

the parties, but such approval is reversed or substantially modified on appeal and 

such reversal or modification becomes final by a lapse of time or otherwise; then, in 

any  of  such  events,  the  Stipulation,  the  Settlement  proposed  in  the  Stipulation 

(including any amendments thereof), the provisional Class certification herein, any 

actions taken or to be taken with respect to the Settlement proposed in the Stipulation, 

and the Order and Final Judgment to be entered shall be of no further force or effect, 

shall be null and void, and shall be without prejudice to any of the parties hereto, 

who shall be restored in all respects to their respective positions existing prior to the 

execution of the Stipulation, except for the obligation of the Company to pay for any 

7 

 

 

expenses incurred in connection with the Notice and administration provided for by 

this Scheduling Order.  For purposes of this provision, a disallowance, modification, 

or reversal of the fees and/or expenses sought by Plaintiff’s Counsel shall not be 

deemed a disapproval, modification, or reversal of the Settlement or the Order and 

Final Judgment. 

12.  The  Stipulation,  and  any  negotiations,  statements,  or  proceedings  in 

connection therewith, shall not be construed or deemed evidence of, a presumption, 

concession, or admission by any Released Person or any other person of any fault, 

liability, or wrongdoing as to any facts or claims alleged or asserted in the Action or 

otherwise, or that Plaintiff or Plaintiff’s Counsel, the Class, or any present or former 

stockholders  of  the  Company,  or  any  other  person,  has  suffered  any  damage 

attributable  in  any  manner  to  any  Released  Person.    The  Stipulation,  and  any 

negotiations, statements, or proceedings in connection therewith, shall not be offered 

or admitted in evidence or referred to, interpreted, construed, invoked, or otherwise 

used by any person for any purpose in the Action or otherwise, except as may be 

necessary to enforce or obtain Court approval of the Settlement. 

13.  All proceedings in the Action, other than such proceedings as may be 

necessary to carry out the terms and conditions of the Settlement, are hereby stayed 

and  suspended  until  further  order  of  this  Court.    Pending  final  determination  of 

whether the Settlement should be approved, Plaintiff and all members of the Class, 

8 

and  any  of  them,  are  hereby  barred  and  enjoined  from  asserting,  commencing, 

prosecuting, assisting, instigating, or in any way participating in the commencement 

or  prosecution  of  any  action  asserting  any  Settled  Claims,  either  directly, 

representatively, derivatively, or in any other capacity. 

14.  The Court may, for good cause, extend any of the deadlines set forth in 

this Order without further notice to Class members.
