VOLUNTARY MEDIATION 
IN THE DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY1 

Preface 

The State of Delaware wishes to remain preeminent in its ability to meet the 

needs of its business community, including the needs of all business entities domiciled in 
Delaware. The mediation program available in Delaware's Court of Chancery is one way the 
State is attempting to meet these needs. Mediation is intended to provide the participants 
convenient access to dispute resolution proceedings that are fair, confidential, effective, 
inexpensive and expeditious. 

There are now two types of non-mandatory mediation2 available in the Court 

of Chancery: (i) mediation pursuant to Court of Chancery Rule 174, which provides for 
mediation in an ongoing case pending in the Court of Chancery ("Rule 174 Mediations"), and 
(ii) mediation pursuant to 10 Del. C. § 347 and Rules 93 to 95, which now provide for 
"mediation only" dispute resolution for certain types of business disputes where there is no 
pre-existing pending action (the "Mediation Only Program"). Mediation in both cases is 
voluntary and can only proceed with consent of the parties. 

Who May Participate In The Mediation Program? 

First, parties to an ongoing case pending in the Court of Chancery may 

agree to mediation pursuant to Court of Chancery Rule 174. 

Second, under the Mediation Only Program, parties who consent by agreement 
to mediation may have a business dispute mediated, so long as at least one party is a business 
entity (as defined in 10 Del. C. § 346), at least one party is a business entity formed or organized 
under Delaware law or having its principal place of business in Delaware and a consumer is 
not a party to the dispute. 

Who Will Serve As The Mediator? 

In Rule 174 Mediations, the Chancellor or Vice Chancellor presiding in a 

case, with the consent of the parties, may refer any case or issue in a case to any other judge 

                                                 

1 This pamphlet is intended to provide a general summary of the mediation process in the Delaware 

Court of Chancery. The Court's official rules should be consulted and govern in the case of any inconsistencies 
between statements contained herein and the rules. 

2 Mandatory mediation is required in certain guardianship and estate cases under Court of 

Chancery Rule 174.1. This pamphlet is intended to describe only the two types of non-mandatory mediation 
procedures in the Court of Chancery; it has no application to the mandatory mediation required by Rule 
174.1.

or master sitting permanently in the Court of Chancery who has had no involvement in the 
case or to another person agreed upon by the parties for voluntary mediation.  In the 
Mediation Only Program, a member of the Court of Chancery (or the Master in Chancery) 
will act as the mediator and the parties may request a particular member of the Court to act 
as mediator. 

What Types of Business Disputes Qualify for the Mediation Only Program? 

Only "business disputes" where one of the parties is a business entity formed 
in Delaware or having its principal place of business in Delaware, and no party to the dispute 
is a consumer eligible for the Mediation Only Program. In the case of business disputes 
involving solely a claim for money damages, the amount in controversy must exceed $1 
million. 

By rule, the Court of Chancery has defined business disputes that are eligible 
for submission as any complex corporate commercial or alternative entity dispute, including 
technology disputes, as that term is defined in 10 Del. C. § 346(c).  A "technology dispute" 
means a dispute arising out of an agreement and relating primarily to: the purchase or lease 
of computer hardware; the development, use, licensing or transfer of computer software; 
information, biological, pharmaceutical, agricultural or other technology of a complex or 
scientific nature that has commercial value, or the intellectual property rights pertaining 
thereto; the creation or operation of Internet web sites; rights or electronic access to 
electronic, digital or similar information; or support or maintenance of the above.  The term 
does not include a dispute arising out of an agreement (i) that is primarily a financing 
transaction, or (ii) merely because the parties' agreement is formed by, or contemplates that 
communications about the transaction will be by, the transmission of electronic, digital or 
similar information.

meaningful way. 

Is There A Filing Or Other Fee? 

Yes, local counsel must be present and prepared to participate in a 

Yes, for Rule 174 Mediations, if the mediator appointed is the Chancellor, one 
of the Vice Chancellors or Master, the mediator shall not be compensated. Instead, a filing fee 
shall be assessed against the parties as court costs in the amount of $5,000 for the first day of 
mediation and $5,000 for every additional day required.  See Ch. Ct. Rule 174(c)(2).   These 
fees shall be deposited into a separate account maintained by the Court of Chancery, which 
shall be used from time to time in the discretion of the Court for mediation training and/or 
refunds or any other purpose designated by the Chancellor.  This mediation filing fee and the 
fee for each additional day of mediation shall be divided between the parties and may be 
waived or modified in the discretion of the presiding Chancellor, Vice Chancellor or Master. 
For the Mediation Only Program, there is an initial filing fee of $10,000.  For each day after 
the first day that the Chancellor, a Vice Chancellor or a Master in Chancery is engaged, a fee 
of $5,000 per day shall be assessed.  The fee shall be divided equally among the parties.

Are Mediation Proceedings Confidential? 

Yes. The strict confidentiality provisions set forth in Rule 174(3)(c) apply with 

respect to both types of mediation. See Ch. Ct. Rules 94(a)(4), 95(b). Any communication 
made in or in connection with the mediation that relates to a controversy being mediated, 
whether made to the mediator or a party or to any person if made at a mediation conference is 
confidential. In Rule 174 Mediations, the mediator shall not discuss the substance of any 
mediation with the trial judge and shall treat all aspects of the mediation as confidential, 
unless otherwise agreed by the parties. A mediation agreement, however, shall not be 
confidential unless the parties otherwise agree in writing. 

Information disclosed to the Mediator by a party or counsel during the 

mediation session, including in any written submissions, is not disclosed to the other party 
without consent. All mediation proceedings are confidential, are not admissible as evidence in 
any other proceedings, and may not be recorded without prior consent of the parties and the 
Mediator. 

Who Must Attend? 

Rule 174(3)(b) governs participation in all mediation conferences. It provides 
that at least one representative with an interest in the issue or issues to be mediated and with 
authority to resolve the matter should participate in the mediation conference. Delaware 
counsel, as defined in Rule 170(a), must also attend the mediation conference on behalf of 
each party. This rule also applies in the Mediation Only Program. See Rule 95(a). In the 
Mediation Only Program the initial mediation conference will generally be scheduled 
between 15 and 60 days after the filing of the petition. Rule 94(c). 

If a person with authority to resolve the matter is unable to participate, that 

must be disclosed at the commencement of the mediation and must be set forth in the 
mediation order and approved by the mediator. Also, the method by which authority will be 
obtained must be set forth. 

What Documents Must the Parties Prepare? 

First, before the mediation commences, the parties must enter into a written 
consent  and  order  of  mediation  that  identifies  the  issues  to  be  mediated  and  specifies  the 
methods by which the parties shall attempt to resolve the issues. See Ch. Ct. Rules 93(d)(4), 
94(a)(3)  and  174(3)(c).  The  parties  should  attempt  to  identify  clearly  the  matters  to  be 
resolved. 

Second, a petition for mediation must be submitted to the Register in 

Chancery.  It must identify the issues to be mediated, the amount in controversy and a 
statement that all parties consent and that the jurisdictional requirements have been met. 
See Ch. Ct. Rule 94(a)(3). 

Third, a mediation statement will normally be required, which statement may 
not exceed 15 pages. Chancery Court Rule 171 (d) should be followed regarding form. The 
mediation statement is not to be shared with the other parties. The mediation statement should 
provide the following: 

 

4 

  A description of who the parties are, their relationship, if any, to each other 
and by whom each party is represented, including the identity of all 
individuals participating on behalf of a party during the mediation 
conference. 

  A brief factual background, clearly indicating those facts not in dispute. 

  A brief summary of the law, including applicable statutes, cases and 
standards. Any unreported decisions, including decisions from this 
jurisdiction, are to be included as exhibits. 

  An honest discussion of the party's claims and/or defenses, including the 

strengths and weaknesses of the party's position. 

  A brief description or history of prior settlement negotiations and discussions, 
including the party's assessment as to why settlement has not been reached, the 
party's proposed term(s) for a resolution and a description of how the party 
believes the Court may be able to assist in reaching an agreement. 

  The amount of attorneys' fees and costs listed separately that have been 

incurred by the party to date, with a fair estimate of such additional fees and 
expenses, including expert witness fees, if this matter is not settled. In the case 
of a contingency fee or non-hourly rate fee arrangement, the percentage of that 
fee, if applicable, the number of hours and costs incurred by the party to date, 
with a fair estimate of additional expenses, including expert witness fees, and 
the amount of hours if this matter is not settled. 

The original and a copy of the Statement shall be submitted to the Mediator 

at least 10 days before the Mediation Conference, shall not be filed with the Register in 
Chancery, shall not be exchanged with other parties, shall not be provided to the trial judge 
and shall not become part of the court record. 

Third, if the parties reach agreement with regard to the issues set forth in their 

mediation agreement, their agreement shall be reduced to writing and signed by the parties 
and the mediator. See Ch. Ct. R. 95(d) and 174(3)(c). The agreement will be binding on all 
parties to it and, upon filing by the mediator, will become part of the Court record. If, 
however, the parties choose to keep the terms of the agreement confidential, a stipulation of 
dismissal may be filed instead. See Rule 95(b) (A mediation agreement, however, shall not be 
confidential unless the parties otherwise agree in writing.) 

Parties are expected to prepare in advance for the mediation so that the 

mediator's time can be used most efficiently. 

What Happens If No Agreement Is Reached? 

The mediator shall officially terminate the mediation conference. The 

termination shall be without prejudice to any party in any other proceeding. No party shall be 
bound by anything said or done at the conference unless an agreement is reached. See Rule 
95(e). (The mediation in a mediation only matter is not eligible to adjudicate any matter
