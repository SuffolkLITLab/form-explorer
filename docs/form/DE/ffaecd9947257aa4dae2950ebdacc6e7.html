QUICK-PEEK STIPULATION AND [PROPOSED] ORDER 

WHEREAS, the Parties1 believe that it will promote the efficient, just, and 

economical resolution of this Litigation to supplement the existing Confidentiality 

Stipulation  by  entering  into  this  stipulation  and  order  (the  “Clawback  Order”) 

regarding the exchange of certain Discovery Material; 

WHEREAS, based upon a good faith belief that such procedures are likely 

to generate documents relevant and/or responsive to the discovery requests in this 

Litigation,  the  Parties  have  previously  agreed  to  limit  their  respective  document 

collection and production efforts to certain document custodians and repositories, 

 

1 Unless otherwise defined, capitalized terms herein have the meanings assigned in 
the Stipulation and Order Governing the Protection and Exchange Of Confidential 
And  Highly  Confidential  Material  entered  in  this  Litigation  (the  “Confidentiality 
Stipulation”). 

and further agreed to utilize electronic keyword search terms to identify potentially 

relevant documents from the foregoing document sources; 

WHEREAS, despite these limitations on the scope of discovery, the volume 

of documents that are likely relevant and/or responsive to the discovery requests in 

this  Litigation  is  of  a  magnitude  that  a  document-by-document  review  of 

documents prior to production would cause substantial delay and would be unduly 

burdensome on the Producing Parties; 

WHEREAS, the Parties believe that permitting the production of documents 

pursuant  to  this  Clawback  Order,  without  the  necessity  of  a  document-by-

document  review  by  the  Producing  Party  prior  to  production,  will  materially 

reduce the cost and duration of discovery, and the attendant burdens on the Parties; 

WHEREAS,  adopting  the  approach  set  forth  herein  may  result  in  the 

inadvertent disclosure of Discovery Material that is subject to a claim of attorney-

client,  work  product  and/or  other  applicable  privilege  or  immunity  (collectively, 

“Privileged  Discovery  Materials”),  as  well  as  the  disclosure  of  other  materials 

irrelevant to this Litigation (“Irrelevant Materials”); and 

WHEREAS,  pursuant  to  Delaware  Uniform  Rule  of  Evidence  510,  the 

Parties  understand  and  stipulate  that  disclosure  of  Privileged  Discovery  Material 

pursuant to this Clawback Order will not prejudice or otherwise constitute a waiver 

2 

   

 

of, or estoppel as to, any claim of attorney-client, work product, or other applicable 

privilege or immunity, under Delaware law; 

IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED, AGREED AND ORDERED: 

1.  Any  Party  may  designate  any  document(s)  (or  collection  of  documents) 

that  such  Party  produces  in  this  Litigation  as  “Clawback  Discovery  Material” 

under  the  terms  of  this  Clawback  Order,  if  counsel  for  such  Party  in  good  faith 

reasonably  concludes  that:    (i)  such  Clawback  Discovery  Material  is  likely  to 

contain documents or information responsive to the opposing Party’s requests for 

the  production  of  documents;  and  (ii)  a  document-by-document  review  by  the 

Producing  Party  prior  to  production  to  confirm  responsiveness  or  to  identify 

privileged materials is not practicable in light of the delay and/or burden associated 

with such a review.   

2.  A  Producing  Party  shall  not  be  obligated  to  conduct  a  document-by-

document review of Clawback Discovery Material prior to its production; provided 

however, that a Producing Party shall utilize keyword search terms (e.g., the names 

of counsel and law firms for the Producing Party), analytical software tools and/or 

other  reasonable  means  to  locate  and  exclude  potentially  Privileged  Discovery 

Materials  prior  to  the  production  of  Discovery  Material  as  Clawback  Discovery 

Material.    Any  potentially  Privileged  Discovery  Materials  so  excluded  shall  be 

reviewed  by  the  Producing  Party  and,  if  such  material  is  responsive  and  non-

3 

   

 

objectionable,  either  (i)  produced  (if  such  material  is  not  deemed  Privileged 

Discovery Material), or (ii) placed onto the Producing Party's privilege log (if such 

material  is  deemed  Privileged  Discovery  Material),  in  the  normal  course  of 

discovery,  consistent  with  the  rules  of  this  Court.    If  a  Producing  Party  complies 

with  this  paragraph,  such  Producing  Party  shall  be  deemed  to  have  implemented 

adequate precautions to prevent inadvertent disclosure of any Privileged Discovery 

Materials produced as Clawback Discovery Material. 

3.  Unless  otherwise  agreed  by  the  Parties,  the  designation  of  Discovery 

Material  as  Clawback  Discovery  Material  shall  be  made  in  a  manner  consistent 

with paragraph 5 of the Confidentiality Stipulation, and the Producing Party shall 

either  affix  an  appropriate  legend  or  utilize  a  separate  Bates  number  prefix  for 

Clawback Discovery Material. 

4.  Unless  otherwise  agreed  by  the  Parties,  Clawback  Discovery  Material 

shall  be  produced  in  an  electronically  searchable  format  (e.g.,  as  text  searchable 

PDFs  or  TIFFs,  native  format,  etc.),  and  shall  otherwise  comply  with  any 

production protocols agreed to by the Parties. 

5.  Clawback  Discovery  Material  shall  be  deemed  Highly  Confidential 

Discovery  Material  under  paragraph  2  of  the  Confidentiality  Stipulation,  and  the 

provisions  of  paragraphs  15  and  16  with  regard  to  objections  to  a  confidentiality 

designation shall apply; provided however, that Clawback Discovery Material shall 

4 

   

 

not be disclosed, summarized, described, characterized or otherwise communicated 

or made available in whole or in part to the persons identified in paragraph 6(f) of 

the Confidentiality Stipulation (i.e. “the Court, persons employed by the Court, and 

court reporters transcribing any hearing, trial or deposition in this Litigation or any 

appeal  therefrom”),  except  for  court  reporters  transcribing  any  deposition  in  this 

Litigation,  unless  the  Producing  Party  is  first  provided  with  reasonable  notice  of 

the  intent  to  use  the  document  and  an  opportunity  to  claim  that  the  Clawback 

Discovery Material in question constitutes Inadvertent Production Material. 

6.  Disclosure  of  Privileged  Discovery  Materials  in  this  Litigation  pursuant 

to this Clawback Order shall in no way prejudice or otherwise constitute a waiver 

of, or estoppel as to, any attorney-client, work product or other applicable privilege 

or  immunity.    Any  Privileged  Discovery  Materials  produced  as  Clawback 

Discovery Material shall be deemed to have been inadvertently produced. 

A.  A  party  who  receives  a  document  designated  as  Clawback 

Discovery Material that, upon review by such party, appears on its face to be 

Privileged  Discovery  Material  shall: 

  (i)  refrain  from  any  further 

examination  or  disclosure  of  such  document  pending  confirmation  by  the 

Producing  Party  that  such  document  is  not  Privileged  Discovery  Material; 

and  (ii)  provide  reasonably  prompt  written  notice  to  counsel  for  the 

Producing  Party  that  such  document  appears  to  be  Privileged  Discovery 

5 

   

 

Material.    Upon  receiving  a  written  notice  contemplated  by  the  preceding 

sentence, the Producing Party shall provide reasonably prompt written notice 

to  the  requesting  party  indicating  whether  the  document  in  question 

constitutes Inadvertent Production Material. 

B.  A Producing Party shall be obligated to make a reasonably prompt 

claim  of  inadvertent  production  with  respect  to  a  document  designated  as 

Clawback Discovery Material upon the earlier of:  (i) receiving notice under 

the  preceding  paragraph  concerning  such  document,  or  (ii)  otherwise 

becoming  aware  of  the  inadvertent  production  of  such  document.    If  a 

Producing Party complies with this paragraph, such party shall be deemed to 

have  acted  timely  and  adequately  to  rectify  any  inadvertent  disclosure  of 

Privileged Discovery Materials produced as Clawback Discovery Material. 

C.  The  procedures  set  forth  in  paragraph  21  of  the  Confidentiality 

Stipulation  shall  apply  to  any  Clawback  Discovery  Material  which  is 

claimed to be Inadvertent Production Material. 

D.  The  Producing  Party  shall  timely  log  any  Clawback  Discovery 

Material  that  is  claimed  to  be  Inadvertent  Production  Material,  consistent 

with the rules of this Court. 

7.  Each  Party  shall  have  the  right  to  demand  the  return  of  any  Irrelevant 

Material produced by such Party, and the Parties agree to meet and confer in good 

6 

   

 

faith to resolve any disputes that arise regarding Irrelevant Materials.  Once a Party 

receives  notice  that  a  document  designated  as  Clawback  Discovery  Material 

constitutes  Irrelevant  Material,  such  party  shall  refrain  from  any  further 

examination  or  disclosure  of  such  Irrelevant  Material,  other  than  as  agreed  to  by 

the Producing Party or to review to the limited extent necessary to engage in the 

meet and confer process with the Producing Party. 

8.  Nothing in this Clawback Order shall: 

A.  require any Party to produce or disclose any Privileged Discovery 

Materials; 

Discovery Material; 

B.  require  any  Party  to  produce  documents  or  data  as  Clawback 

C.  waive  any  Party’s  right  to  conduct  limited  pre-production  review 

of  Clawback  Discovery  Material  prior  to  production  of  such  materials, 

provided that such review is not inconsistent with the determination required 

by paragraph 1(ii); 

D.  prevent a Party from designating Discovery Material that has been 

subject to a limited pre-production review as Clawback Discovery Material, 

provided  that  such  review  is  not  inconsistent  with  the  requirements  of 

paragraph 1(ii); 

7 

   

 

E.  modify  the  Confidentiality  Stipulation,  unless  expressly  stated 

herein; 

F.  except  as  expressly  stated  herein,  modify  any  prior  agreements 

among  the  Parties  concerning  the  conduct  of  discovery  in  this  Litigation, 

including  but  not  limited  to  agreements  regarding  the  collection  of 

Discovery  Material  from  certain  custodians  or  the  use  of  search  terms  to 

identify potentially responsive documents; or 

G.  prevent any Party from arguing that a waiver of an attorney-client, 

work  product  or  other  applicable  privilege  or  immunity  has  occurred  from 

circumstances  other  than  disclosure  of  Clawback  Discovery  Material 

pursuant to this Clawback Order. 

9.  The Parties agree that any violation of this Clawback Order shall result in 

irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law.  The Parties further 

agree  that  any  Party  shall  be  entitled  to  injunctive  relief  to  enforce  the  terms 

hereof.    In  addition,  the  Parties  expressly  acknowledge  that  the  Court  may,  in  its 

discretion,  award  such  other  and  further  relief  as  the  Court  may  deem 

appropriate.This Clawback Order applies only to Discovery Material produced by 

the Parties, and does not apply to Discovery Material produced by non-Parties.  In 

the event additional parties join or are joined in the Litigation, they shall not have 

access to Clawback Discovery Material until the newly-joined party by its counsel 

8 

   

 

has executed and, at the request of any Party, filed with the Court its agreement to 

be fully bound by this Clawback Order. 

10.  The  Parties  agree  to  be  bound  by  the  terms  of  this  Clawback  Order 

pending  the  entry  of  this  Clawback  Order  by  the  Court,  and  any  violation  of  its 

terms shall be subject to the same sanctions and penalties as if this Clawback Order 

has been entered by the Court.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties shall not 

be  obligated  to  provide  any  Clawback  Discovery  Material  prior  to  entry  of  this 

Clawback Order by the Court, unless the production of such Discovery Material is 

expressly required by another Order of the Court. 

11.  Subject to any applicable rule of the Delaware Court of Chancery or the 

Delaware  Supreme  Court,  the  provisions  of  this  Clawback  Order  shall,  absent 

written permission of the Producing Party or further order of the Court, continue to 

be binding throughout and after the conclusion of the Litigation, including without 

limitation any appeals therefrom. 

12.  Nothing  in  this  Stipulation  and  Order  shall  preclude  any  party  from 

seeking  judicial  relief,  upon  notice  to  the  Parties,  with  regard  to  any  provision 

hereof.
