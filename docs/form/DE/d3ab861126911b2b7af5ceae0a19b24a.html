This  is  a  sample  one-tier  confidentiality  stipulation  referenced  in  Section 
C(7)(f)(iv) (“Confidentiality Stipulations and Orders”), page 27 of the Guidelines 
on Best Practices for Litigating Cases Before the Court of Chancery.  It should be 
modified to fit the circumstances and used in conformity with the Guidelines.  The 
parties shall advise the Court in a letter when filing a confidentiality stipulation of 
any  material  variations  to  these  forms,  and  shall  submit  a  marked/redlined 
versions to the Court indicating such changes. 
 

IN THE COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE 

STIPULATION AND [PROPOSED] ORDER FOR THE  
PRODUCTION AND EXCHANGE OF  
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION 

WHEREAS, the parties to the above-captioned action (the “Litigation”) 

will engage, or are engaged, in discovery proceedings, which may include, among 

other things, producing documents, responding to written discovery requests, and 

taking depositions; and 

WHEREAS, those discovery proceedings may involve the production 

of certain information that one or more of the parties to the Litigation (collectively 

the  “Parties,”  and  each  a  “Party”)  believe  to  be  confidential  and  sensitive 

commercial, financial, or business information;

IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED AND AGREED, by the Parties hereto, 

through their undersigned counsel, subject to the approval of the Court, pursuant to 

Court  of  Chancery  Rules  5.1  and  26(c),  that  this  Stipulation  and  Order  for  the 

Production  and  Exchange  of  Confidential  Information  (the  “Stipulation”)  will 

govern  the  handling  of  documents,  deposition  testimony,  deposition  exhibits, 

deposition transcripts, written discovery requests, interrogatory responses, responses 

to  requests  for  admissions,  and  responses  to  requests  for  documents  and 

electronically stored information, and any other information or material produced, 

given  or  exchanged,  including  any  information  contained  therein  or  derived 

therefrom  (“Discovery  Material”)  by  or  among  any  Party  or  non-Party  providing 

Discovery Material (each a “Producing Party”) in this Litigation. 

1. 

Any Producing Party may designate any Discovery Material as 

“Confidential” under the terms of this Stipulation if such Producing Party in good 

faith  and  reasonably  believes  that  such  Discovery  Material  contains  nonpublic, 

confidential,  personal,  business,  strategic,  proprietary,  or  commercially  sensitive 

information that requires the protections provided in this Stipulation (“Confidential 

Discovery Material”).   

2. 

The  designation  of  Discovery  Material  as  Confidential 

Discovery Material shall be made in the following manner: 

- 2 - 

 

 

a. 

In the case of documents or other materials (apart 

from depositions or other pre-trial testimony): (i) by affixing the legend 

“Confidential”  to  each  page  containing  any  Confidential  Discovery 

Material,  except  that  in  the  case  of  multi-page  documents  bound 

together by staple or other permanent binding, the word “Confidential” 

need only be stamped on the first page of the document in order for the 

entire document to be treated as “Confidential” Discovery Material; or 

(ii) in the case of electronically stored information produced in native 

format, by including “Confidential” in the file or directory name, or by 

affixing  the  legend  “Confidential”  to  the  media  containing  the 

Discovery Material (e.g., CD-ROM, DVD, flash drive), as applicable. 

b. 

In  the  case  of  depositions  or  other  pretrial 

testimony: (i) by a statement on the record, by counsel, at the time of 

such disclosure or before the conclusion of the deposition or testimony; 

or (ii) by written notice, sent to all Parties within five (5) business days 

of receipt of the rough or final transcript (whichever is received first) 

designating the entire transcript or portions thereof; provided that only 

those  portions  of  the  transcript  designated  as  Confidential  Discovery 

Material  shall  be  deemed  Confidential  Discovery  Material.    All 

depositions  and  other  pretrial  testimony  will  be  deemed  to  be 

- 3 - 

 

 

Confidential Discovery Material until the expiration of the 5th business 

day  after  counsel  receive  a  copy  of  the  rough  or  final  transcript 

(whichever  is  received  first),  after  which  such  deposition  and  other 

pretrial testimony will be treated in accordance with its confidentiality 

designation,  if  any.    The  Parties  may  modify  this  procedure  for  any 

deposition or other pretrial testimony, through agreement on the record 

at such deposition or testimony, without further order of the Court.   

c. 

In  the  case  of  any  other  Discovery  Material,  by 

written  notice  that  the  Discovery  Material  constitutes  Confidential 

Discovery Material, as applicable. 

3. 

The  designation  of  Discovery  Material  as  Confidential 

Discovery  Material  shall  constitute  a  representation  that  such  Discovery  Material 

has been reviewed by an attorney representing the Party making the designation, and 

that there is a good faith basis for such designation. 

4. 

Inadvertent 

failure 

to  designate  Discovery  Material  as 

Confidential Discovery Material shall not constitute a waiver of such claim and may 

be  corrected  promptly  upon  discovery  of  such  failure.    A  Producing  Party  may 

designate as “Confidential” any Discovery Material that has already been produced, 

including  Discovery  Material  that  the  Producing  Party  inadvertently  failed  to 

designate as Confidential Discovery Material, (i) by notifying in writing the Party to 

- 4 - 

 

 

whom  the  production  has  been  made  that  the  Discovery  Material  constitutes 

Confidential Discovery Material, or (ii) in a manner consistent with Paragraph 2.  

The  Party  making  the  designation  shall  mark  and  replace  previously  supplied 

Discovery Material. Upon receiving notice of the inadvertent failure to designate, 

the Parties shall thereafter treat the Discovery Material so designated as Confidential 

Discovery  Material  and  such  Discovery  Material  shall  be  fully  subject  to  this 

Stipulation from the date of such supplemental notice forward.  The Party receiving 

such notice shall make a reasonable, good faith effort to ensure that any analyses, 

memoranda,  notes,  or  other  such  materials  generated  based  upon  such  newly 

designated  information  are  immediately  treated  as  containing  Confidential 

Discovery Material.  In addition, upon receiving such supplemental written notice, 

any receiving Party that disclosed the Discovery Material before its designation as 

Confidential Discovery Material shall exercise its best efforts to ensure (i) the return 

or destruction of such Discovery Material by any person not authorized to receive 

the Confidential Discovery Material under the terms of this Stipulation, (ii) that any 

documents or other materials derived from such Discovery Material are treated as if 

the  Discovery  Material  had  been  designated  as  Confidential  Discovery  Material 

when originally produced, (iii) that such Discovery Material is not further disclosed 

except  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  this  Stipulation,  and  (iv)  that  any  such 

- 5 - 

 

 

Discovery Material, and any information derived therefrom, is used solely for the 

purposes described in Paragraph 9 of this Stipulation. 

5. 

Confidential Discovery Material may be disclosed, summarized, 

described, characterized, or otherwise communicated or made available in whole or 

in part only to the following persons for use in accordance with this Stipulation: 

a. 

The  Parties  and  the  directors,  officers,  general 

partners, limited partners, managers, members, and employees of the 

Parties  who  are  assisting  with  or  making  decisions  concerning  the 

Litigation,  to  the  extent  deemed  reasonably  necessary  by  counsel  of 

record for the purpose of assisting in the prosecution or defense of the 

Litigation; 

b. 

Counsel  who  represent  Parties  in  this  Litigation 

(including  in-house  counsel),  and  the  partners,  counsel,  associates, 

paralegals, secretaries, clerical, regular and temporary employees, and 

service  vendors  of  such  counsel  (including  outside  copying  and 

litigation support services) who are assisting with the Litigation; 

c. 

Subject  to  Paragraph  7,  experts  or  consultants 

assisting  counsel  for  the  Parties,  and  partners,  associates,  paralegals, 

secretaries,  clerical,  regular  and  temporary  employees,  and  service 

vendors  of  such  experts  or  consultants  (including  outside  copying 

- 6 - 

 

 

services  and  outside  support  services)  who  are  assisting  with  the 

Litigation; 

d. 

Subject to Paragraph 8, witnesses or deponents, and 

their  counsel,  only  to  the  extent  necessary  to  conduct  or  prepare  for 

depositions  or  testimony  or  to  prepare  and  submit  declarations  or 

affidavits in this Litigation; 

e. 

Any person indicated on the face of a document or 

accompanying  cover  letter,  email,  or  other  communication  to  be  the 

author, addressee, or an actual or intended recipient of the document, 

(or 

indicated 

as 

a 

blind 

copy 

recipient 

in 

such 

document/communication’s  metadata);  any  person  indicated  as  the 

custodian of the document/communication in corresponding metadata 

or  as  confirmed  by  the  Producing  Party;  or,  in  the  case  of  meeting 

minutes and presentations, an attendee of the meeting; 

f. 

The  Court,  persons  employed  by  the  Court,  and 

court  reporters  transcribing  any  hearing,  trial,  or  deposition  in  this 

Litigation or any appeal therefrom; and 

g. 

Any other person only upon (i) order of the Court 

entered  upon  notice  to  the  Parties,  or  (ii)  written  stipulation  of,  or 

statement  on  the  record  by,  the  Producing  Party  who  provided  the 

- 7 - 

 

 

Confidential  Discovery  Material  being  disclosed,  provided  that  such 

person signs an undertaking in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto. 

6. 

Subject to Paragraph 24, to the extent that testimony is sought 

concerning Confidential Discovery Material during any deposition or in any other 

pretrial venue, any Party may exclude any person from the deposition or other venue 

during such testimony if the Confidential Discovery Material may not be disclosed 

to such person under the terms of this Stipulation. 

7.  Notwithstanding  Paragraph  5(C),  Confidential  Discovery 

Material may be provided to persons listed therein only to the extent necessary for 

such expert or consultant to prepare a written opinion, to prepare to testify, or to 

assist counsel in this Litigation, provided that such expert or consultant (i) is not 

currently an employee of, or advising or discussing employment with, or consultant 

to  (aside  from  expert  services  provided  in  connection  with  this  Litigation),  any 

Party  or  any  known  Competitor  (as  defined  below)  or  potential  transaction 

counterparty  of  the  Producing  Party  designating  the  Confidential  Discovery 

Material, as far as the expert or consultant can reasonably determine, and (ii) is 

using  said  Confidential  Discovery  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  this  Stipulation;  and 

further provided that such expert or consultant agrees to be bound by the terms of 

this Stipulation by signing an undertaking in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto.  

Counsel  for  the  Party  showing,  providing,  or  disclosing  Confidential  Discovery 

- 8 - 

 

 

Material  to  any  person  required  to  execute  an  undertaking  pursuant  to  this 

paragraph shall be responsible for obtaining and retaining such signed undertaking 

before  the  provision  of  Confidential  Discovery  Material  to  such  expert  or 

consultant.    Under  no  circumstances  shall  an  expert  or  consultant  who  is  a 

Competitor  or  an  employee  of  a  Competitor  of  the  Producing  Party,  or  who  is 

providing  services  to  any  of  the  foregoing,  be  provided  access  to  Confidential 

Discovery Material absent further order of the Court or consent of the Producing 

Party.  “Competitors” are persons or entities engaged in the same or similar lines 

of business as the Producing Party. 

8.  Notwithstanding  Paragraph  5(D),  Confidential  Discovery 

Material  may  be  provided  to  persons  listed  therein  only  after  (i)  such  persons 

confirm their understanding and agreement to abide by the terms of this Stipulation 

by making such a statement on the record, and/or by signing an undertaking in the 

form attached as Exhibit A hereto, or (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction orders 

them  to  abide  by  the  terms  of  this  Stipulation.    Counsel  for  the  Party  showing 

Confidential Discovery Material to any person required to execute an undertaking 

pursuant  to  this  paragraph  shall  be  responsible  for  obtaining  and  retaining  such 

signed undertaking before the provision of such Confidential Discovery Material 

to such person. 

- 9 - 

 

 

9. 

Confidential  Discovery  Material  shall  be  used  solely  for 

purposes of this Litigation and shall not be used for any other purpose, including, 

without limitation, any business or commercial purpose; provided, however, that the 

foregoing  shall  not  apply  to  Confidential  Discovery  Material  that  is  or  properly 

becomes part of the public record; and further provided that the restrictions on the 

use of Confidential Discovery Material may be modified for good cause shown. 

10.  Every  person  to  whom  Confidential  Discovery  Material  is 

disclosed,  summarized,  described,  characterized,  or  otherwise  communicated  or 

made available, in whole or in part, shall be advised that the information is being 

disclosed  pursuant  and  subject  to  the  terms  of  this  Stipulation  and  may  not  be 

disclosed  or  used  for  purposes  other  than  those  permitted  hereunder.    Each  such 

person shall maintain the Confidential Discovery Material, or information derived 

therefrom,  in  a  manner  reasonably  calculated  to  prevent  unauthorized  disclosure.  

Any Party issuing a subpoena to a non-Party shall enclose a copy of this Stipulation 

and notify the non-Party that the protections of this Stipulation are available to such 

non-Party.  

11.  Any  pleading,  brief,  memorandum,  motion,  letter,  affidavit, 

exhibit  or  other  document  filed  with  the  Court  that  discloses,  summarizes, 

describes,  characterizes,  includes  or  attaches  or  otherwise  communicates 

Confidential  Discovery  Material  (a  “Confidential  Filing”)  must  be  filed 

- 10 - 

 

 

confidentially  and  not  available  for  public  access  (“Confidential  Treatment”)  in 

accordance with the provisions of Court of Chancery Rules 5.1 and 79.1 and the 

Administrative Directive of the Chancellor of the Court of Chancery of the State 

of  Delaware  Amended  No.  2003-1,  dated  March  15,  2007,  regarding  e-File 

Administrative Procedures, which may be accomplished by submitting documents, 

every page of which shall have a footer stating:

In addition, every Confidential Filing must be submitted with a cover page bearing 

the title of the Litigation, the title of the Confidential Filing, and stating: 

YOU ARE IN POSSESSION OF A CONFIDENTIAL 
FILING  FROM  THE  COURT  OF  CHANCERY  OF

If a public version of the Confidential Filing will be filed in accordance with Court 

of Chancery Rule 5.1(d), then the cover page shall also state:

CONFIDENTIAL 

FILED UNDER SEAL PURSUANT TO A 
PROTECTIVE  
ORDER DATED ____________, 20__, GOVERNING  
CONFIDENTIALITY OF DOCUMENTS AND 
INFORMATION 
 OBTAINED DURING THE COURSE OF THIS 
LITIGATION. 

THIS ENVELOPE IS NEITHER TO BE OPENED 
NOR THE CONTENTS THEREOF DISPLAYED 
OR REVEALED EXCEPT BY OR TO QUALIFIED 
PERSONS OR BY COURT ORDER. 

12.  A  Party  making  a  Confidential  Filing  must  comply  with  the 

provisions  of  Court  of  Chancery  Rule  5.1.  The  definition  of  Confidential  in  this 

stipulation may encompass Confidential Discovery Information that falls within a 

broader  range  of  material  than  is  covered  by  Rule  5.1.    Nevertheless,  when 

complying  with  Rule  5.1,  parties  must  file  a  copy  of  the  Confidential  Filing  for 

public inspection that omits only such Confidential Discovery Material as to which 

the  Producing  Party  reasonably  and  in  good  faith  believes  the  public  interest  in 

access to Court proceedings is outweighed by the harm public disclosure of such 

Discovery  Material  would  cause  because  it  contains  sensitive,  non-public 

information.  For avoidance of doubt, the Parties have no obligation to file public 

versions of any exhibits, affidavits, declarations or other attachments filed as part of 

a Confidential Filing, except as required by Court of Chancery Rule 5.1(f)(1) or if 

otherwise ordered by the Court or required by the Register in Chancery. 

- 13 - 

 

 

13.  All  materials  filed  pursuant  to  Paragraph  11  shall  be  released 

from  Confidential  Treatment  (as  defined  in  Court  of  Chancery  Rule  5.1)  by  the 

Register in Chancery only as provided in Court of Chancery Rules 5.1(d) and 5.1(g), 

as applicable, or upon further order of this Court.  When any Party receives a notice 

from  the  Register  in  Chancery  pursuant  to  Rule  5.1  concerning  the  release  of 

Confidential  Filings  that  were  filed  with  the  Court  by  such  Party  but  contain 

Discovery  Material  designated  as  Confidential  Discovery  Material  by  another 

Producing Party, the Party receiving the notice shall deliver a copy of such notice 

(by hand, email, or facsimile transmission) to counsel for the Producing Party (or 

Producing  Parties)  within  three  (3)  business  days  of  the  receipt  of  such  notice,  if 

such  notice  is  not  otherwise  sent  to  such  Producing  Party  by  the  Register  in 

Chancery, so as to enable the latter to seek further Confidential Treatment or to have 

the  documents  returned  or  destroyed.    The  provisions  of  this  Paragraph  may  be 

waived only with the prior written consent of the Producing Party. 

14.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Court  of  Chancery  Rule 

5.1(f), any Party who objects to the continued restriction on public access to any 

Confidential Filing, or any portion thereof, shall give written notice of the objection 

to the Producing Party.  If the Confidential Filing was a document for which the 

filing of a public version was not required under Rule 5.1(d), the Producing Party 

seeking to continue the restriction on public access to the Confidential Filing, or 

- 14 - 

 

 

any  portion  thereof,  shall  provide  the  notices  and  public  filings  within  the  time 

periods required by Rule 5.1(f)(1).  To the extent that the Producing Party seeks to 

continue the restriction on public access to the Confidential Filing, or any portion 

thereof,  to  which  a  public  version  is  available,  the  Producing  Party  shall  file  a 

motion with the Court within the five-day period mandated by Court of Chancery 

Rule 5.1(f)(2).  The filing of the motion constitutes a certification that the signer 

of  the  motion  personally  reviewed  the  Confidential  Filing  and  that  continued 

Confidential  Treatment  is  appropriate.    The  person  challenging  Confidential 

Treatment  shall  have  five  (5)  days  to  file  an  opposition.    The  Court  shall  then 

determine whether Confidential Treatment will be maintained, or whether a reply, 

hearing  or  further  proceedings  are  warranted.    If  a  motion  seeking  continued 

Confidential  Treatment  is  not  timely  filed,  then  the  Confidential  Filing  shall 

become part of the public record, and the Register in Chancery shall permit access 

to  the  Confidential  Filing  on  the  docket  system  to  the  same  extent  as  any  other 

public filing.  If an opposition to the motion is not timely filed, then the challenge 

shall be deemed withdrawn and the Confidential Filing shall continue to receive 

Confidential Treatment.  

15.  During the pendency of this Litigation, any Party objecting to 

the designation of any Discovery Material as Confidential Discovery Material may, 

after making a good faith effort to resolve any such objection, move on reasonable 

- 15 - 

 

 

notice for an order vacating the designation.  While such a motion is pending, the 

Discovery Material in question shall be treated as Confidential Discovery Material 

pursuant to this Stipulation.  The provisions of this Stipulation are not intended to 

shift any burdens of proof, including the burden of establishing that any Discovery 

Material  validly  constitutes  Confidential  Discovery  Material,  which  burden 

remains  on  the  Producing  Party  that  designates  such  Discovery  Material  as 

Confidential Discovery Material. 

16.  The Parties reserve the right to apply, upon short notice, for an 

order  seeking  additional  safeguards  with  respect  to  the  use  and  handling  of 

Discovery Material or to modify the terms of this Stipulation.  The Parties agree to 

meet and confer in good faith prior to moving the Court for any modifications or 

additional safeguards. 

17.  Entering into this Stipulation, or agreeing to and/or producing or 

receiving  Discovery  Material  or  Confidential  Discovery  Material  or  otherwise 

complying with the terms of this Stipulation, shall not: 

a. 

Prejudice in any way the rights of any Party to (i) 

seek  production  of  documents  or  information  the  Party  considers 

subject to discovery, or (ii) object to the production of documents or 

information it considers not subject to discovery; 

- 16 - 

 

 

b. 

Operate  as  an  admission  by  any  Party  that  any 

Discovery  Material  constitutes  Confidential  Discovery  Material  or 

contains  or  reflects  trade  secrets  or  any  other  type  of  confidential 

information; 

c. 

Prejudice in any way the rights of any Party to (i) 

petition  the  Court  for  a  further  protective  order  relating  to  any 

purportedly  Confidential  Discovery  Material,  or 

(ii)  seek  a 

determination  by  the  Court  whether  any  Discovery  Material  or 

Confidential Discovery Material should be subject to the terms of this 

Stipulation; 

d. 

Prevent any Party from agreeing in writing to alter 

or waive the provisions or protections provided herein with respect to 

any Discovery Material; 

e. 

Prejudice  in  any  way  the  rights  of  any  Party  to 

object to the relevance, authenticity, use, or admissibility into evidence 

of  any  document,  testimony,  or  other  evidence  subject  to  this 

Stipulation;  

f. 

Preclude any Party from objecting to discovery that 

it believes to be otherwise improper; or 

- 17 - 

 

 

g. 

Operate  as  a  waiver  of  any  attorney-client,  work 

product, business strategy, trade secret, or other privilege, immunity or 

protection. 

18.  This  Stipulation  has  no  effect  upon,  and  shall  not  apply  to,  a 

Producing Party’s use or disclosure of its own Discovery Material for any purpose.  

Nothing  herein  shall:  (i)  prevent  a  Producing  Party  from  disclosing  its  own 

Confidential  Discovery  Material;  or  (ii)  impose  any  restrictions  on  the  use  or 

disclosure  by  any  person  of  documents,  materials,  or  information  designated  as 

Confidential Discovery Material obtained lawfully by such person independently 

of  the  discovery  proceedings  in  this  Litigation,  and  not  otherwise  subject  to 

confidentiality restrictions. 

19. 

If Discovery Material that is subject to a claim of attorney-client 

privilege, attorney work product, or any other applicable privilege or immunity or 

ground on which production of that information should not be made to any Party 

(“Inadvertent  Production  Material”)  is  inadvertently  produced  to  that  Party  or 

Parties, such inadvertent production shall in no way prejudice or otherwise constitute 

a waiver of, or estoppel as to, any claim of attorney-client privilege, work product, 

or other applicable privilege or immunity; provided further: 

a. 

A claim of inadvertent production shall constitute a 

representation by that Producing Party that the Inadvertent Production 

- 18 - 

 

 

Material  has  been  reviewed  by  an  attorney  for  such  Producing  Party 

and  that  there  is  a  good  faith  basis  for  such  claim  of  inadvertent 

production. 

b. 

If  a  claim  of  inadvertent  production  is  made 

pursuant to this Stipulation, with respect to Discovery Material then in 

the  custody  of  another  Party,  the  Party  possessing  the  Inadvertent 

Production Material shall: (i) refrain from any further examination or 

disclosure  of  the  claimed  Inadvertent  Production  Material;  (ii)  if 

requested,  promptly  make  a  good-faith  effort  to  return  the  claimed 

Inadvertent  Production  Material  and  all  copies  thereof  (including 

summaries and excerpts) to counsel for the Producing Party, or destroy 

all such claimed Inadvertent Production Material (including summaries 

and excerpts) and all copies thereof, and certify in writing to that fact; 

and (iii) not use the Inadvertent Production Material for any purpose 

until further order of the Court. 

c. 

A  Party  may  move  the  Court  for  an  order 

compelling production of the claimed Inadvertent Production Material; 

and may retain a copy of the material on an attorney’s-eyes-only basis 

for the purpose of bringing such a motion;  however, while such motion 

is  pending,  the  Discovery  Material  in  question  shall  be  treated  as 

- 19 - 

 

 

Inadvertent Production Material, and such motion may not assert as a 

ground  for  entering  such  an  order  the  fact  or  circumstance  of  the 

inadvertent  production,  nor  shall  such  motion  include  or  otherwise 

disclose,  as  an  attachment,  exhibit,  or  otherwise,  the  Inadvertent 

Production Material (or any portion thereof) that is the subject of such 

motion 

20. 

 Nothing  herein  shall  be  deemed  to  waive  any  applicable 

common law or statutory privilege or work product protection. 

21.  In the event additional Parties join or are joined in this Litigation, 

they  shall  not  have  access  to  Confidential  Discovery  Material  until  the  newly 

joined Party by its counsel has executed and filed with the Court its agreement to 

be bound fully by this Stipulation. 

22.  The Parties agree to be bound by the terms of this Stipulation 

pending the entry by the Court of this Stipulation, and any violation of its terms 

shall be subject to the same sanctions and penalties as if this Stipulation had been 

entered by the Court. 

23.  Subject to the requirements of Court of Chancery Rules 5.1(g) 

and  any  applicable  rule  of  the  Delaware  Supreme  Court,  the  provisions  of  this 

Stipulation shall, absent written permission of the Producing Party or further order 

of  the  Court,  continue  to  be  binding  throughout  and  after  the  conclusion  of  the 

- 20 - 

 

 

Litigation, including, without limitation, any appeals therefrom, except as provided 

in Paragraph 24. 

24.  In the event that any Confidential Discovery Material is used in 

open court during any court proceeding or lodged as a trial exhibit, the material 

shall lose its confidential status and become part of the public record, unless the 

Producing  Party  applies  for  and  obtains  an  order  from  this  Court  specifically 

maintaining  the  confidential  status  of  particular  material.    Prior  to  any  court 

proceeding in which Confidential Discovery Material is to be used, counsel for the 

Parties  shall  confer  in  good  faith  on  such  procedures  that  may  be  necessary  or 

advisable  to  protect  the  confidentiality  of  any  such  Confidential  Discovery 

Material. 

25.  Within thirty (30) days after receiving notice of the entry of an 

order,  judgment,  or  decree  finally  disposing  of  this  Litigation,  or  any  other 

proceeding  in  which  Confidential  Discovery  Material  is  permitted  to  be  used, 

including the exhaustion of all possible appeals, and upon the written request of 

the Producing Party, all persons having received Confidential Discovery Material 

shall either (i) make a good-faith and reasonable effort to return such material and 

all copies thereof (including summaries, excerpts, and derivative works) to counsel 

for the Producing Party; or (ii) make a good-faith and reasonable effort to destroy 

all Confidential Discovery Material, and if so requested, to certify to that fact in 

- 21 - 

 

 

writing to counsel for the Producing Party.  However, counsel for the Parties shall 

be entitled to retain court papers, deposition and trial transcripts, and litigation files 

(including attorney work product and discovery material containing Confidential 

Discovery Material), provided that such counsel, and employees of such counsel, 

shall maintain the confidentiality thereof and shall not disclose such court papers, 

correspondence,  pleadings,  depositions  and  trial  transcripts,  and  litigation  files 

(including attorney work product and discovery material containing Confidential 

Discovery Material), to any person except pursuant to a court order, agreement by 

the  Producing  Party,  or  as  otherwise  required  by  law.    For  purposes  of  this 

Paragraph,  good  faith  reasonable  efforts  to  return  or  destroy  material  need  not 

include destroying Discovery Material residing on back-up tapes or other disaster 

recovery systems, so long as the person who has received such Discovery Material 

maintains the confidentiality of such material.  All materials returned to the Parties 

or their counsel by the Court likewise shall be disposed of in accordance with this 

Paragraph. 

26.  If  any  person  subject  to  this  Stipulation  in  possession  of 

Confidential  Discovery  Material  (the  “Receiver”)  receives  a  subpoena  or  other 

compulsory  process  seeking  the  production  or  other  disclosure  of  Confidential 

Discovery Material produced or designated by a Producing Party other than the 

Receiver  (collectively,  a  “Demand”),  the  Receiver  shall  give  written  notice  (by 

- 22 - 

 

 

hand,  email,  or  facsimile  transmission)  to  counsel  for  the  Producing  Party  (or 

Producing Parties) within three (3) business days of receipt of such Demand (or if 

a response to the Demand is due in less than three (3) business days, at least twenty-

four (24) hours prior to the deadline for a response to the Demand), identifying the 

Confidential Discovery Material sought and enclosing a copy of the Demand, and 

must  object  to  the  production  of  the  Confidential  Discovery  Material  on  the 

grounds  of  the  existence  of  this  Stipulation.    The  burden  of  opposing  the 

enforcement of the Demand will fall on the Producing Party.  Nothing herein shall 

be construed as requiring the Receiver or anyone else covered by this Stipulation 

to challenge or appeal any order requiring production of Confidential Discovery 

Material  covered  by  this  Stipulation,  or  to  subject  itself  to  any  penalties  for 

noncompliance with any legal process or order, or to seek any relief from this Court 

or  any  other  court.    Compliance  by  the  Receiver  with  any  order  directing 

production pursuant to a Demand of any Confidential Discovery Material will not 

constitute a violation of this Stipulation. 

27.  No Receiver shall reveal any Confidential Discovery Material, 

or  the  information  contained  therein,  to  anyone  not  entitled  to  receive  such 

Confidential Discovery Material under the terms of this Stipulation.  In the event 

that Confidential Discovery Material is disclosed to any person other than in the 

manner  authorized  by  this  Stipulation,  or  that  any  information  comes  to  the 

- 23 - 

 

 

Receiver’s  attention  that  may  indicate  there  was  or  is  likely  to  be  a  loss  of 

confidentiality of any Confidential Discovery Material, the Receiver responsible 

for the disclosure or loss of confidentiality shall immediately inform the Producing 

Party  of  all  pertinent  facts  relating  to  the  disclosure  or  loss  of  confidentiality, 

including, if known, the name, address, and employer of each person to whom the 

disclosure  was  made.    The  Receiver  responsible  for  the  disclosure  or  loss  of 

confidentiality  shall  also  make  reasonable  efforts  to  prevent  disclosure  of 

Confidential  Discovery  Material  by  each  unauthorized  person  who  receives  the 

information. 

28.  The Parties agree that the production of any Discovery Material 

by any non-Party shall be subject to and governed by the terms of this Stipulation. 

29.  To the extent of any conflict between this Stipulation and Rule 

5.1, Rule 5.1 shall control.   

30.  This Stipulation, and any dispute arising out of or relating in any 

way to this Stipulation, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall be governed 

by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without 

regard to conflict of laws principles.  Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably submits to 

the  personal  jurisdiction  of  any  state  or  federal  court  sitting  in  the  State  of 

Delaware, as well as to the jurisdiction of all courts to which an appeal may be 

taken from such courts, in any suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or relating 

- 24 - 

 

 

to  this  Stipulation,  (ii)  agrees  that  all  claims  in  respect  of  such  suit,  action,  or 

proceeding shall be brought, heard, and determined exclusively in the Delaware 

Court of Chancery (provided that, in the event that subject matter jurisdiction is 

unavailable  in  that  court,  then  all  such  claims  shall  be  brought,  heard,  and 

determined  exclusively  in  any  other  state  or  federal  court  sitting  in  the  State  of 

Delaware),  (iii)  agrees  that  it  shall  not  attempt  to  deny  or  defeat  such  personal 

jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such court, (iv) agrees not to 

bring any suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Stipulation in 

any other court, and (v) expressly waives, and agrees not to plead or to make any 

claim that any such suit, action, or proceeding is subject (in whole or in part) to a 

jury trial.  Each of the Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the 

maintenance  of  any  suit,  action,  or  proceeding  brought  in  accordance  with  this 

Paragraph.  Each of the Parties further agrees to waive any bond, surety, or other 

security that might be required of any other party with respect to any suit, action, 

or proceeding, including, without limitation, an appeal thereof.  Each of the Parties 

further consents and agrees that process in any suit, action, or proceeding may be 

served on such Party by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to such 

Party  or  such  Party’s  registered  agent  in  the  state  of  its  incorporation  or 

organization, or in any other manner provided by law.
