GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 

   

All  decisions  from  the  Justice  of  the  Peace  Court  civil  matters,  except 
 
landlord/tenant possession cases, may be appealed to the Court of Common 
Pleas  in  the  county  in  which  the  Justice  of  the  Peace  Court  is  located.    The 
landlord/tenant  cases  MUST  be  appealed  to  a  three  judge  panel  of  Justices  of 
the  Peace.    Appeals  to  this  Court  are  “de  novo,”  meaning  that  the  case  starts 
over in the Court of Common Pleas.  (Court of Common Pleas Civil Rule 72.3(a)) 

The party who is appealing the Justice of the Peace Court decision is the 
“Appellant.”    The  party  whose  role  it  is  to  respond  to  the  appeal  filed  by  the 
Appellant is the “Appellee.” 

The named parties and issues outlined in the appeal must be filed exactly 
as  it  was  in  the  Justice  of  the  Peace  Court.    Parties  must  comply  with  the 
requirements  of  Civil  Rule  72.3  of  the  Court  of  Common  Pleas  Rules  of  Civil 
Procedure.   

Corporations  must  be  represented  by  legal  counsel  in  the  Court  of 

Common Pleas. 

All filing fees filed with the Court are non-refundable.  

 

  

   

   

   

                                             

APPEALS FROM JUSTICE OF THE PEACE COURT CIVIL CASES 
 
PLAINTIFF BELOW INSTRUCTIONS 

To appeal a decision from a Justice of the Peace Court civil  matter, 

the Plaintiff Below must file within fifteen (15) days the following: 
 

  A Notice of Appeal.   This must be filed in the Clerk’s Office of 
the  Court  of  Common  Pleas  and  must  include  an  original  and 
one copy for each party to be served.   

  An original Praecipe and one copy.   A Praecipe is a document 

which tells the Sheriff where to serve the parties.   

  An original Summons on Appeal and one copy for each party to 
be  served.  The  Summons  on  Appeal  is  the  document  that  the 
Sheriff  will  serve  with  the  pleadings.  Pleadings  are  written 
statements in which a party to a lawsuit sets forth or responds to 
claims, allegations, denials and defenses.    

  An original Complaint with the Court plus one (1) copy for each 

party to be served. (See attached sample Complaint)  
 

t  the  same  time, or  within  ten  (10)  additional  days,  the  Plaintiff 

  A

   

Below must: 

  Pay  a  non-refundable  $135.00  filing  fee  (including  the  Court 
Security  Assessment.)  Payments  can  be  made  with  check, 
cash,  or  money  order.  Currently,  we  are  unable  to  accept 
credit/debit  card  payments at  the  Court.  All  checks  must  be 
made payable to the “Court of Common Pleas.”  

  Pay a separate non-refundable check made payable to “Sheriff.” 

Sheriff costs are as follows: 

If  you  are  serving  more  than  one  person,  the  costs  are 
$30.00  for  the  first  address  and  $30.00  for  each  additional 
address.    There  is  a  $5.00  fee  for  each  additional  person 
served at the same address. 

   

 

  The Appellant shall, within ten (10) calendar days, file a copy of 

the Notice of Appeal with the Justice of the Peace Court. 

Once  the  Defendant  Below  has  been  served  with  the  Complaint,  he/she 
shall  have  twenty  (20)  days  in  which  to  file  an  Answer.  If  the  Defendant  Below 
fails to file an Answer, see the “How to Prepare a Civil Motion” packet available in 
the Clerk’s Office and on the Court’s web site at the following link:  

http://courts.delaware.gov/forms/download.aspx?id=45678 

   

 

WHAT HAPPENS IF I FAIL TO FILE THESE DOCUMENTS 
 AND PAY ALL FEES? 
  

our appeal cannot proceed until you have complied with all instructions.  
If  you  fail  to  file  any  of  the  required  documents  or  you  fail  to  submit  the 
appropriate fees, your appeal will be dismissed by the Court.  

ll filing fees are non-refundable. 

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER I FILE MY DOCUMENTS  

AND PAY ALL FEES? 

 

Once all the pleadings above have been served on the Defendant Below, 

he/she  will  have  twenty  (20)  days  to  respond  in  writing  to  the  Complaint.   
Pleadings  are  written  statements  in  which  a  party  to  a  lawsuit  sets  forth  or 
responds  to  claims,  allegations,  denials  and  defenses.    Examples  of  pleadings 
are a “Complaint” and “Answer.”  If the Defendant Below responds within twenty 
(20)  days,  you  will  be  notified  by  the  Court  of  a  Pre-trial  Conference  with  the 
Judge and the other party.  
 

A party may call the Civil Clerk’s Office to determine if “service” has been 
made  on  a  party.    “Service”  or  “service  of  process”  is  the  formal  delivery  of  a 
legal notice.   You may have to make another attempt if no service is made within 
the prescribed time allotted.

WHAT IS A PRE-TRIAL CONFERENCE? 

If  the  Defendant  Below  answers  the  Complaint,  the  case  may  be 
scheduled for a pre-trial conference.  At the conference, the parties will meet with 
a  judicial  officer  in  an  attempt  to  narrow  the  issues,  determine  the  number  of 
witnesses  to  be  called,  the  length  of  the  trial,  and  to  discuss  the  possibility  of 
settlement. 

If a pre-trial conference is scheduled, you will receive notice by mail along 
with a pre-trial worksheet, which must be completed by both parties and returned 
to the Court at least three (3) days before the scheduled conference.

COMPLAINT 

Plaintiff is a citizen of the State of Delaware. 

Defendant  is  a  citizen  of  the  State  of  Delaware  residing  at  79  Whistful

On or about January 2, 20XX, Defendant borrowed from Plaintiff the sum 
of $5,000.00 promising to repay that amount within 120 days with interest 
at the rate of 10 percent.     

Defendant did not repay the loan. 
 
Plaintiff, therefore, asks the Court to award the Plaintiff that amount 
accrued with interest.

      If we think we've found a match to a question in our library, it is highlighted in green. Novel names are auto generated. So, you will probably need to edit some of them if you're trying to stick to the convention.
